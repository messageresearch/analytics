========================================

to her school and passed it amongst the teachers and um so in total the sales for the clothing and the shoes we raised 778 dollars so that was pretty awesome and then sister emily kolb made her delicious tamales i don't know if she's here right now but she's maybe out in the parking area still but she she alone made 152 dollars with the raising of sales from the sale of her tamales i think she's got back orders she's still working trying to fulfill that's a lot of work to make those things if you've never made them but uh we're going to continue to move forward with those type of events like to say praise the lord because he's been moving on the hearts of the individuals to give towards our cause to date we've had a lot of smaller contributions from our congregation for those on some of those online but we've had two very large offerings love offerings given towards our our building fund and we're at a total of thirty two thousand dollars as of today um maybe a little bit over brother jason said a little bit over thirty two thousand dollars um that being said i'd just like to thank all those that gave and um you know just pray a blessing upon those that gave and those that will give in the future if you've caught this vision for our church you know the need and the desire of our hearts is to to just grow as a church as lord has we don't want to build this church ourselves we want the lord to move on the hearts of the people and to bring them here as they feel that of the lord we've got two families here that have recently joined us in the last couple services brother ken johnson there in the back and um i'm gonna have to i wrote down how to pronounce um brother joe howdyshell is that did i say it right sister amen and his family so if if both you two families would wouldn't mind standing just so that people can recognize who you are because i don't even know myself [Applause] amen what a beautiful addition to bethel tabernacle and we're so happy to have you here with us sojourning joining us in worship as we progress in this great grandeur thing we call the rapture we're in progress of that catching away right now um so i just also want to you know i was the lord put on my heart last night something that something that was said by brother abraham i don't know what he said and i was trying to think about what he said that made me think about it but when he was preaching last night he mentioned something that made struck my heart about being a liberal giver and you know most of us as christians don't look at ourselves viewing life as liberals but we're more we're we're conservative christians for the most part not not being political just in our views and something he said last night made me think about the liberal in the context of being liberal in the context of giving and i looked up the scripture and i i wrote it down this morning and it's in uh proverbs 11 25 and you know this is the the new uh i think it's the new living translation but it says a generous person will prosper and whoever refreshes others will be refreshed and if i would have read the the um king james version probably about 90 percent of us wouldn't have got it including me um so i had to look up the a different translation but that puts it very clearly that and prosperity doesn't mean being wealthy prosperity means god's blessing us spiritually first and foremost he blesses us with our health he best blesses us with a congregation that loves us and and and a pastor and a ministry team that are servants so i just want you to think of all that when you're praying that this here is not a is not a our goal isn't to necessarily seek a blessing but it's if you remember back brother jason he preached a sermon on cause and effect and um so it's it's near it's in simple words it's a reaction god's reaction to our action and it's it's the cause and effect of god's word that if we are givers and we give liberally liberally even to the point of hurt sometimes that we will be prosperous so with that being said the 32 000 in the building fund um talking with brother mark and brother jason it looks like we have enough money to actually break ground and start the project if we so feel led um to start in the with the fellowship hall that's phase two excuse me isn't that phase two i think i talking to brother mark this morning i think the brothers maybe need to sit down and talk about that more my initial thought and talking to brother mark this morning was if we did start the fellowship hall first that we could actually move into the fellowship hall when we were doing the sanctuary so i may have that backwards but in the next um in the next update i'll definitely have that straight i think a lot of that depends on the costs that are associated with each phase of the project so our next event we're trying to plan will be the yard sale bake sale slash car wash and we're looking at hopefully getting that started sometime this summer and we don't want to get too late into the summer because we'll be starting our plans for the upcoming youth camp and we don't want those two to collide and either one get shortchanged so we want to try to try to maybe get started with some planning for sometime in july i know it'll be hot but uh if we do it early enough in the morning get started early enough in the morning hopefully the lord will bring all the buyers to us and and sell everything out before the heat really gets bad and we're thinking about maybe um brother jason is going to talk to the owner of the building of yama's japanese steakhouse it used to be over there on the corner by urban nest and they're basically adjacent to one another so we could have the car wash in one lot in the bake sale in the yard sale in the lot of urban nest i think i feel like because they're adjacent to one another um a lot of people would get uh they would get the benefit of doing both brother jason made the he made the um put the idea together for if we sold like some some kind of food people could eat the food while their car was being washed and they could sell or you know browse through the um the yard sale items while their cars are being washed so young people get your sponges ready and um so that would be part of the plan and it looks like with our two new families we got plenty of more help from the young people so praise the lord god knew right and these two new families are they're actually they may not have caught what i'm talking about um in the first initial launch of this but you all are walking in god's vision for this tabernacle here and um you may not even have known exactly but your children and you are going to reap the benefits of that walking by faith and being here because we're going to put you to work you're not visitors anymore amen the honeymoon's over we're going to put you to work here in july um [Music] let's see yeah and i really don't have anything else to announce but if if anyone that is has any ideas of any other um building fund events that we could do please bring it to my attention or even brother matt's brother jd's brother jason doesn't really need to be bothered but if it's something that you feel like you want to talk to him about then fine bring it to him too and we're just looking forward to seeing what god will do yes because this is really all him and we're just being vessels surrendered to him and and however he wants to use us right all right praise the lord are you ready for uh the worship now amen [Applause] do so [Music] [Music] um [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] oh because we do not care and breathing to god in prayer what a friend we have in jesus all our sins and grief to bear [Music] [Applause] one of privilege to care air breathing to

fractured ribs so he's the closest grandchild to them so he's been taking care of him he really wanted to come on saturday breakfast saturday night so we want to remember his grandfather today amen

that same high priest they can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities [Music] and we come to you sure knowing the lord you love us and you care for our welfare more better than we would do ourselves and you are more willing to help us than we ever can ever understand lord i'm praying that you'll come and speak to us and lord help us strengthen us heal every sick person for the price is already paid service sinners if they are here lord and lord take out any shadow of doubt and unbelief from our midis bringing us to the unit of faith the ultimate goal goal of our calling in such a time lord i thank you because you've always answered our prayers and i believe you'll do it this time again because we have vested believing in the unequaled and immature name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen well maybe before we see it i wanted just to read some scripture if you can open your bibles together with me we want to turn our bibles the book of second kings chapter four just some common scripture reading of course i know this must have been read and preached here many times second kings chapter 4 from verse 1 to verse 7 it says now they are cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets and to elijah saying thy husband i mean sorry thy servant my husband is dead thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be born men elijah said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what has thou in the house and she said the dying handmaid has not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go and borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors empty even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is food so she went from him and shut down and put her upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out came to pass when the vessels were full that he said unto her son bring me here a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel and the oil stayed then he came and told the man of god and say and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest and i wanted to read also in the book of exodus chapter 4 exodus chapter 4 the first four verses moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hacking unto my voice for they will they will say the lord has not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said the road and he said he cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and he became a serpent and moses fled from before it and the lord said and moses put further in hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and called it and became a road in his hand may god bless his word and bless you may be seated i salute you friends in the name of lord jesus christ this morning and i believe you've already been enjoying the princess of the lord such wonderful singing yeah i always tell the church i love singing more than preaching because preaching is something you know you'll have to answer for but singing you have nothing to answer for singing so i said i made a statement here one time i said i just preach because i like what i preach and because god told me to preach otherwise i don't like preaching but i like singing and i i've always told them if you can pray that god gives you a pastor i would just be comfortable being a songwriter because that is more comfortable for me so it has been a wonderful time having you i mean being with your friends and you know just fellowshipping around his word and of course you know we have been following something to do with bringing the bridegroom right into thy mother's chamber the final resting place and what a wonderful thought you know that like as we were talking about it with brother yesterday yesterday it's not time to flat around he was he was tired with flatting that's why he went away so he says this time if i'm coming i'm coming when you are ready to settle down and you are going to settle down as good as a dead body because i'm coming with anointing for the dead so that you don't have to you know i'm tired of the friendship you know boyfriend girlfriend kind of affair i want to settle down so this time he comes and he you know just like isaac took rebecca and placed her into the mother's house you know there's something about it here he she also brings him to the mothers house and now we found out that the mother's house is exactly you because that is the body because the mother is the holy spirit and the mother's house therefore is the temper of the holy spirit which is your body and that's the final resting place so that to me is is really wonderful i don't know about you so by maybe if i was not preaching to you then i was preaching to myself because this was the first time i was preaching that sermon so i was very happy i was very happy that i i i brought him to the final resting place glory oh god so now today i'm just wanting us to look at this story which is very common in the bible that there is a lady who has got a debt and the debt is demanding like the two sons will be taken maybe the man put them forth as some kind of collateral surety that if i fail to pay then you'll take my sons and here he has died and the debt has remained and the creditor has come and is taking these two sons and the woman goes to consult the prophet of course today we may not have the prophet physically percy to go and console him but you may go and consult him by way of listening to a temple reading the message book or even going to pray about what do i do blessed be the name of the lord and [Music] there's something interesting here because you realize that elijah doesn't say let me go and speak for you to the king you remember the other woman if we have to go back this one was a rich human in the book of second kings i think you know this woman was a rich one and but elijah promised was willing in second kings i think chapter 4 verse 13 if you look at that he says and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all his care what is to be done for thee would this thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she asked that i dwell among my only people so elisha wanted to speak for this woman who had a husband only that she was buried and elijah knew that the problem of buriedness could not be solved by the king so you see it's a little bit different he wants to speak for a rich human i mean you would only speak to the king for a ricky person i mean for a person who is poor that maybe the king would intervene and give her some money but this was a rich human this shulamite woman was rich she even offered to build for elijah a house a room and he put everything there now elisha is feeling so comfortable and he feels like he's he always deserving something and then he says what do you want he knows there is a need but he doesn't mention the need of that woman he doesn't talk about barriness he says who do you want me to speak for you to the king and the woman says i don't need anything from the king because i you know physically speaking she was well off she was a well to do my woman together with her husband she was no widow she was no refugee why would he want to speak up for her to the king and now here comes someone who'd actually fit that but he doesn't mention anything about speaking for her to the king because these are two different people but although both of them were believers if you can know but this one was the wife of a prophet this one was just a believer they are two different and you will realize that this tuna might woman was living in laodicea because he says i have no need of nothing so it was going to take the minister of elisha when it brings desperation one day when that child dies and things like that when he has he points out that this woman is barren and then the woman is given a child by the spoken word and eventually that child dies and eventually like that the story goes on until one day by the prophet's message he tells her to migrate god the land of the philistines and be there for seven years because there's going to be farming and then when she comes back she's needed because hala and her garden her her crops have been taken over and then she wants to be spoken for to the king but she doesn't know somebody because she turned it down in that elisha wanted to introduce her to the king but she by the laodicean anointing says i have no need of anything i don't need any support so she missed the golden chance of being introduced to the king before she could go to the philistines land and migrate and be there seven years a type of the seven church ages and then there was going to be a holy convocation of returning back to her promise and then that's when she remembered i wish i had been spoken for to the king because the king would have known me now i would have just gone and told the king this is my land but she had no connection so she went there she was waiting until the right time the opportunity came when the king was asking gehazi to relate to him all the miracles that he had witnessed in the ministry of elisha and when he has started talking about the a certain woman who was barren and then she she was spoken for i mean prayed for and she got a child and the child died and then eventually he was brought back to life that human springs up in that he says i am that woman i think i preached something about that the bride is mentioned ever positioned within the elijah ministry it's one of the summer the same way i preached now here we come we look at this human who actually needs to be spoken for to the king because she's poor she's in that she's a widow and elijah doesn't mention that glory be oh god because this woman is actually typing a need a church church in need and you know we are not going to be looking elsewhere because our help comes from above and i mean i want to tell you something today there is no problem there is no trial there is no sickness there is no you know complication in your health that takes you that comes upon you like it is surprising god god doesn't wake up from sleep and only to realize you have got cancer you have got diabetes you have got this you have got that there is this complication he is not surprised in other words in any case he puts into place a solution before he allows a problem to come the only difference that we have is we always look at the problem while god looks at the solution for according to god your problem is already solved according to you your problem is there and it's too much so god knows that you your problems are already catered for otherwise you would have called you and secondly that one would make him an a god who is not infinite in finite he's infinite he knows the end from the beginning and he's a provider and he cares for you and he knows you by name and the bible says your name is written on the palm of his hands every time he stretches for his hand your name is there and the bible says unto whom is the arm of the lord revealed it is revealed to you and is revealed to you every time he stretches forth his hand your name is there he knows you by name so how could he know you by name and he doesn't know and if the prophet says that even a little ba a little what he does is call it the smallest thing on earth he cannot die without him knowing now this widow goes to the prophet and he has she has a debt and a collateral to her sons and it is not her she is not the one who went to borrow the money it is just a car over and some of us are here suffering by things that we didn't actually do we are just being haunted by the past the sins of your father your mother your grandmother your grandfather all those things that he did they did haunting you spirits characters complexes that follow you and you are just a victim you have a debt to pay that you never encounter directly it's a debt but it's been carried over to you and then you are wondering how am i going to do this how am i going to solve this but now today i'm talking about something that i've titled in thy house lies the ultimate solution in thy house lies the ultimate solution to all your problems so what you have to do is just my subject is highlighting the little but also loving reality that lies within you so time has come for just to highlight it and that's what the preaching of the word does that's why god put here preachers to highlight what is new to highlight what is faith to highlight god's power to highlight his capabilities to highlight his love for you he's care for you to make it plain and if you have if you have eyes to see and if you have faith to grasp and if you know if i am a child of god and i know i'm a child of god and all that god god has his mind then you know that this is mine then you'll go and take it by faith come on let me hope i'm going to speak freely today and i'm speaking to god's children and somebody will help me and say amen if you don't i will say it myself because i'm not preaching only to you i'm preaching to myself glory be to god maybe the problem i have is not i'm not a good preacher that is the only problem glory be to god so now this particular widow is going to the prophet and you know what the bible says before we go that you know the prophet says you know the ministry that we have is dealing with a sickest body sickest the sickest and most needed body in the world is the church the blood of christ this is what he says in the message i think go awake jesus he says but there is more to the ministry than divine healing there's more to the ministry than just divine healing see and yet he comes down and says the sickest but i know of tonight is the so-called body of jesus christ it needs the spiritual healing ah spiritual healing will automatically bring physical healing not the other way around because i have seen people whom god has healed terrible terrible diseases but they are not even in the church i have seen and i know a man who was completing the lame you have had my testimony until his legs were twisted and were facing this part was facing his face dangling like this the hands could not hold anything and then i prayed for the man and the man was able to raise up as god told me and he rode the bicycle in three weeks and came to church and now he's not in the church he's out of church for more than 15 years he's there so it's not a physical healing that brings the spiritual healing it's the spiritual healing that brings the physical that settles everything that's why the greatest miracle is that miracle of the salvation of your soul as the prophet says so he says there is only one balm that i know that will heal and that is the word and that is this that is the sick body that we want to stand up in the strength and the vitamin power of the gospel and that's why i use much of the time now in trying to strengthen the church by the word so the sickest body the most in the body is the god of christ the church now this woman was in debt not exactly because she borrowed the money and gave the signs as collateral we have said that or security for the loan but it was inherited the debt and most of us are here suffering it's not what you do mostly it's what you inherited our father adam broke the word but we thank god the second adam second adam came to give us the victory over that blessed be the name of the lord and you know the scripture there is this interesting verse in romans chapter 13 verse 8 what does he say oh we no man anything or we know man anything but to love one another for he that loves another has fulfilled the law no so this woman had a debt and it had to be paid and she goes to the prophet and she didn't know that what you pay the debt is already in the house the prophet gave her nothing never gave her even a coin of money never even prayed for her come on come here i lay hands on you cast out the demon of poverty oh glory be to god you have a little pot of oil and a pot of oil of course stands for the holy ghost and the holy ghost is jesus christ and the holy ghost is the word the word is that spirit you have the word in you in your home that solves it and you are coming to me because you don't know the mystery the potentials that is within the world that you already have the man you took to your mother's house why is he there why would you run around looking for solutions from elsewhere when you have got that oil you've got the holy spirit and the other day i read you i think a quote where the prophet says when you have got the holy spirit you don't need the faith because the holy spirit is that faith the only thing that you need is to know how to operate the faith that's all so you brought him now in the house and he's in the house so the prophet says so what do you have in your house that's the question friends you have a problem you have this you have that i have stress i have depression i have this financial crisis i have this one i'm sick of this i'm i'm harming this pain i have this one this one is against me my neighbors my parents my wife my husband my children my this my dad okay what do you have in your house i'm not surprised that you have that problem there's something that i put in your house there is something that is in your house blessed be the name of the lord and and and you know the other day i was you know maybe let me wait a little bit let me not go into that let's go back to exodus chapter 4. moses wanted a sign and god didn't say go to the bush and cut some particular stick he says what is that already in your hand that which you already have is what i'm going to use not go and cut this get this go attend a certain revival somewhere go here and that no what is that in your hand moses my little old walking road glory to god can you throw it down man put down and when he throws it down what came out of it shocked him did you know when brother branham wanted some squirrel and god says speak it yes he spoke and the squirrels appeared but he could not even believe that he has created the squirrels by his mouth he could rub his face and say come on am i seeing a vision or reality he didn't know that he could create god didn't tell him to go and fast some three days some two days you have it already it's already in you as long as the need arises and is a genuinely need and you want it done you have what it takes you have the wherewithal the only thing is you have to be in constant connection with the one the offer the off of that and then when he just inspires you and tells you to speak it to do it it's gonna happen so the solution to all your problems you are not going to look for some kind of superman somewhere not some super preacher not some superman special man from europe from america from africa no what is that in your hand what is that in your hand what have you got what have you got well i have a little book a little book that i took from the angels and no you just take the book and eat it when you have eaten the book you become the book you become the final resting place of the book and then what happens whatever the book was all the full redemption rights and benefits you are able to get them by faith throw it down and oh i wish i would be powerful brother you are already powerful are we no man anything you have many debts that you cannot pay yeah how could you pay your great great great great great great great grandfather this grandmother this they did it this they killed they did this they died how could you pay that he that is in you is the one who came and paid it all jesus paid it all oh to him my oh glory to god so he came and paid all that i owed and then now i owe it all to him i am here for him he bought me by paying what i couldn't pay and now if i paid i'm free i am not demanded i mean certain you can now stand on that ground and say devil i owe you nothing glory to god i owe you nothing i have the receipt it's already paid i demand it it's mine jesus paid it and who wrote who wrote the receipt for you do you know that if the devil knew that by killing jesus he was giving you healing redemption and salvation he wouldn't have done it because he was shooting his own ugly foot he was maiming himself he didn't know that he's written by his stripes you are healed so he came and he was the one busy whipping jesus whipping jesus and there were stripes all over their body and he didn't know that he was writing the writing that sets you free he was writing the receipt on the blood of christ and those stripes on the blood of christ set you free and the devil cannot only do what he did because that jesus actually died and was buried he cannot and do it it's already done who wrote the receipt the devil himself using his people he wrote it on the word of christ by his stripes you are healed so he wrote there is the stripes himself he whipped jesus and the stripes ripped through all his body and he cannot deny it devil you cannot deny it you did it there is a receipt you are the one who wrote it i'm quoting what you did and you did it yourself sorry for you but i'm free for what you did blessed be the name of the lord i am not guilty devil you are guilty you are guilty because you are the one who wrote it and you signed it so i'm just here claiming my liberty let me he paid it what i couldn't pay lord oh god so he says i want to just go a little bit here this woman here coming to the prophet of course i said elijah didn't give her holy money he didn't speak for her to the king or even offer a prayer for her sometimes you don't even need prayer where where where that one is a new one you may not even need a prayer you just have to change your attitude to that which is in you some demons don't go by prayer by the way you just have to change your face from a gloomy one and you start smiling and that that funny spirit around your husband goes yes some people many people are dying because of lack of love just show him love show how love and those funny spirits will those you know and he called the four tantrums and you know you know chorus psalms just he doesn't even need sometimes prayer glory to god so now he didn't pray for her he just pointed back to what she has now let us ask ourselves a question what if she had decided i have nothing completely it may be so little but you have it don't always say me i have nothing how can you be here a believer you say i have nothing how could you come here and even be baptized in jesus name and you have nothing how can you sit here and listen to this one preacher and you say amen and you say i have nothing you have something there's something in you that's what brings you here that's why that's what makes you thirsty hungry and you love him and you are there's something there otherwise you don't be here no matter how little it is it's there but the devil wants to tell you you have nothing you are nothing you are going nuts you are nowhere you will achieve nothing but there is something there already oh i wish i could be a good preacher he would start preaching now on that one what if he had to say that i have nothing but she said well i only have a little borrow a little port of oil that's all it takes this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine this little faith of mine this little purchase of my this little and the urs of mine this little vat of mine glory oh god i'm going to let it spread its wings i'm going to let it shine i'm let go and set it free it was as long as it is in the pot it will do nothing little yes but that's where god wants to work the solution is in your house and you are crying you are running everywhere i need this i need somebody help me somebody pray for me somebody support me somebody cared for me somebody showed me love somebody the comforter is there the holy ghost is the comforter i think it's somewhere in the book of psalms that he says i communed with myself upon my bed you can commune with yourself have you found someone talking with himself and that's what we are believers you know you can look like you you are neurotic like you're complicated i mean you know you're confused like you are running crazy because you can even sometimes talk with yourself and i'm not crazy because i am 21. there is the bridegroom and there is the bride part of it so the two are communicating maybe sometimes it slips out and it's a bit louder than it's supposed to be but i'm not crazy the two are communicating so when this one is complaining the other one says but you're a believer you're a child of god you believe in god all is well he said yes lord i believe i'm i now repent you are talking to yourself this one is complaining this one is answering back this one is asking a question this one is giving a solution this one is crying this one is soothing this one is comforting there are two in one there is you and there is him he that is in you glory be to god blessed be the name of that i told brother yes and i just come here to chase the moves out of the forest so that he shoots now i think he can he better comes and shoot blessed be the name of the lord so he says what is that in your house and you know this puts me back to something that is very critical back then you can i think there is a minister who by now this week will be losing his house because they go and borrow the money from the banks from the learning groups and you don't have any way you think you're going to pay that money maybe for your employee then you have a salary coming but now you go and borrow money and you put your house or land whatever as a surety and you can imagine someone is ba is borrowing let's say the equivalent of four hundred dollars or five hundred dollars and it's posting as a surety land which is more than maybe two thousand dollars and i want us to go back and look at this scripture critically because there is a scripture which really rang so clearly to me when you go to matthew chapter 13 matthew chapter 13 i think verse 12. he says for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever has not from him shall be taken away even that which he has now how do you look at that verse he has he that he has shall be added he that has not even that which he has shall be taken away from him it means it depends on the confession of the two because how is it that he that has not he has something that is going to be taken away from him he had but he said or overlooked that what he had and he said i don't have so he went to look for that which he thinks he doesn't have like you go for a loan and you put what you have as a collateral and then the devil uses the loan to snatch what you have and then when you lose a land or a house that is more than three thousand dollars like in our place not here because of 400 then you begin to realize i had something after all which was better than what i went for why would i put my home as a collateral for two for hand for four hundred five hundred dollars when my home is five thousand dollars and then when i begin to fail to pay the bank now comes and sells my home why didn't i pick a piece of my land and sell a part of it and solve my problem and remain with my home now i overlooked the greta that i have and said i have nothing that's why i want to borrow [Music] and then the devil uses what i ha i what he has given me to hook what i have blessed be the name of the lord and this is what is you know everywhere brother my house is being taken rather my hou i always tell them brother why didn't you first of all look at what you have god is always able to use that wick you have but we always overlook what we already have and we go for what we don't have we overlook the healing you vacuuming us and you opt for some expensive treatment somewhere did you try what you have did you seek the interfere in intervention of that which is in you did you wait upon god no you went for some substitute glory be to god and that's why as we stay along on this time i mean on this earth we begin to overlook the importance the value the potentials the power of the world that is in us and we begin to look as if the world has better things to offer to us if the world had better things to offer to us why did god send his son all right and why are you saved why are you a believer why do you come to church why would you go to be on a certain expensive like you know natural hubs and so forth chinese made south african made american made european made you know they call them products natural products you have to take this product plus this product times this time with that and you become an expert in this and that to in order to deal with this problem have you tried that which is in you have you given it a try have you tried to deal with this one you have problem by he that is in you have you sold him have you tried to wake up your jesus said jesus i have this problem why do you believe in him why do you believe in him why do you say i'm a believer i believe of what what do you believe a believer does what what is the benefits of a believer okay now that you're a believer what are your benefits what did he what receipt did jesus give you what do you have faith is the substance yes okay what is something where is your substance faith is not a theory it's a fact but it's also an act so jesus i mean this prophet puts us puts the woman back to that which is in her that which is in her house to the man that is in your house the man you brought in the house the whole the oil that is in you can solve all your problems and even move not only your problems you can even bring your neighbors and fill the airports you can feel all the pots the vessels of the neighbors as long as they come with empathy that which is in you you remember the holy spirit that moved from moses and filled the 70 until they all prophesied and moses was not you know weakened they all listened because this his spirit has gone on these ones no so there is something going on blessed be the name of the lord so i'm not here to castigate you or to make you look like you are not believers but i'm just trying to shake our conscience to come to understand who we who are we so if jesus is in us what are the benefits what are we what are we getting from him what is he getting from us how are you how are we showing his glory why do we want to live on the same level like those who don't have him huh what is the difference we are putting between ourselves and them what is the difference between the word bride and the foolish virgins and their own denominations where is my difference in character in life in testimony power and anointing and revelation where is the difference time has come for the crying poor woman to unleash by revelation what has been lying dormant in her until the neighbors will come to know my pot my vessel was also filled by the little oil by the little pot in the woman's house go and burn the neighbors your body your vessels will not be enough amen blessed be the name i hope you are catching with me what i'm trying to talk about glory be to god the prophet says we have enough power let me come back here where i was you know when you come to this the prophet says one had just a vessel with a little oil in it she had nothing else apart from her her two sons was going to be solely for born men bodies men she had nothing else she could do with this little vest of oil wasn't very much she was at the end and elijah said raha said what have you got in your house she said just a little oil in a vessel said go to your neighbors and borrow plenty of them there look getting ready before it even happens getting ready before it even happens get ready david had the sound in the boundary mulberry bushes and i just saw a cloud just like this the size of a hand and he says i hear the sound of abundance of rain if god can only get some empty vessels right that's right he said fill the house full of them full of what empty vessels now glory be to god are we going to be afraid of people coming here empty this should be something here to fill them are we going to be afraid when they seek come here they let them come here they're paralyzed no there should be something here to help with him so we are here to invite glory to god but you know you are only very comfortable inviting your neighbor to dinner when you have something your table is spread isn't it you are sure of yourself that i look at her so you should first of all be sure is that some little oil in the house we shouldn't be presumptuous sure i mean for that reason so he says see what god wants elijah saw a little cloud like a man's hand i see a cloud like a manuscript and i know it's gonna rain this sound of abundance of rain a little cloud and that was the omega dynamics rain coming what am i talking about the omega dynamics rain coming five-fingered cloud talks about the five-fold ministry but it also talks about the five manifestations of the third pool little fish i give you a life that is resurrective sister had here that is redemptive storm wind that is authoritative speaking the squirrels into existence that was creative and then speaking the tumor out of his wife that was curative five fingers i see a cloud and he even tells this one he tells the nan unbeliever i make believe i say prepare her quickly rain is coming where are the clouds man i've seen a little cloud it never came from a big cloud to give you confidence canary that this big cloud is going to bring a lot of rain it was a little cloud like a man's hand blessed be the name of the lord so what he says he says god has got to have empty vessels listen we've had so much doctrine so much ecclesiastical nonsense until we are down at the end of the battle there's only one thing left turn to god and his word that is only one thing left did you see what happened recently when this this pandemic called corona came you were left with the god nurses themselves were scared to death doctors were scared like i was saying the other day you were not even supposed to your wife to come to you your children to come to you your pastor to come to you everybody to come cut off and you are being treated by people who are dressed up to kill you don't even look in their faces whether they are smiling or grinning you were there with only god that's where we are now we've had a lot of doctrines they are taking the church nowhere a classical nonsense until we are now coming at the end of the battle there's only one thing left turn to god and his what and if you do that get some empty vessels take out all the methods out of them and all a pentecostal out of them and all the baptism that is baptist doctrine out of them and just let them be vessels and set them into up in the house and then take this vessel he brings this vessel with a capital v which is now meaning that the vessel in the little woman's home was none other but jesus christ himself take up then take from this vessel and begin to power a man just to pour and he says she had enough to take care of her and her kids and everything else and pay off all the debts why why just what little she had consecrated to god and and following the word of this prophet she came out right you know what the devil is doing now making people uncomfortable with the word of the prophet so they don't follow the word the word instruction by the prophet [Music] you will only come out right when you follow the word instruction by the prophetic message and that's why the devil is targeting that now to destroy it from your life because who brought the revelation to solve the womanis the church's problem it was a prophet pointing her back to what he was in her house blessed be the name of the lord okay he says god send us a prophet that he will take the word of god that will not take some something else but just get empty vessels if god can just get empty vessels and take then take the word of god and pour in into the person not like some say oh i shook when i received it i spoke in drugs when i received i danced to the spirit forget it forget it see just stay there until it becomes that is all till the vessels are full that is it that's the way you do it yes sir blessed be the name of the lord now i'm just going to to be very fast today i'm not going to take a lot of time in other words you already have you already have whatever you will ever need between now and eternity you already have it let me read again this support for you if you didn't hear it he says here he says when you receive the holy ghost everything you've got need of between here and glory is right in you then it ain't faith that you need you've got faith if you've got the holy spirit for he is your faith but the thing you have to know is how to use that face see what i mean and if you just understand how to use it which we will try come this coming week to explain it that's the prophet saying just to see how to use the faith taking the prophetic instruction will pull you out through any problem we don't need any other remedy but the remedy that you need is already in you can you relax can you take your rest because it's resting like we were saying yesterday the daughters of jerusalem you tell them let him rest i'm not in a hurry i'm not going to allow the demon of anxiety they cover me i'm going to be still because i'm listening to this still small voice and a still small voice will unravel every mystery that i need anytime blessed be the name of the lord so he that hath but overlooked it will lose it to the one who values it moses what is that in your hand a stick throw it down let me give you an example one time i think around in matthew and mark also even look they talk about that story whereby i don't know whether you can get that verse but it is somewhere here if you come in the book of i think matthew chapter 15 let me read it because i have some time here matthew chapter 15 sorry chapter 14 from verse 15. sorry it is matthew chapter 14. matthew chapter 14 from verse 15. and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now passed send them out away and they may go into the villages and buy themselves victors this was a reasoning out of common sense isn't it disciples were spot on master it is evening time and this is a desert place you know it there's no water there's no lodging there's no food there's nothing so send them out to the way that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food and verse 16 what does jesus say jesus said unto them they need not depart give them to it you give them you have what it takes to feed them they don't need to go you have the solution and they looked i think at one another like wondering we give them to it past god me i'm a weakling i'm limited come on like god told gideon go then thy strength and serve israel me save israel the lord is with you you might a man of vera me a mighty man when i'm hiding here trying to hide my my my ballet from the midianites and you say i'm a mighty man yes i'm the one who has told you have i not sent you have i not told you that is the horror thing jesus is telling you you give them jesus the prophet is telling that woman borrow even the neighbors whatever versus you don't have even enough problems to deal with to deal with what is in you you don't even have enough space do you know that even he promised that when we pay our tithes when we pay our tithes and offerings what did he say he said that i'll even bless you and you lack a space yes he said son sorry he's telling the disciples they don't need to go you give them something to eat now listen and they say that to him we have here but five loaves and two fishes come on master you are not understanding properly our problem we have so little these are thousands of people if there are five thousand men what about women and children perhaps over fifteen thousand put together now we have only five pieces of bread and two little two fishes please understand us that's how sometimes we say lord i am not able lord you are giving me a task that i cannot handle and we want it you know always solved that's why she went to the prophet she wants someone to solve it that's why so many people have always asked me brother abraham you have a gift why don't you point people to yourself and and tell them you are a prophet you i said have you ever heard me say i'm a prophet i'm not a prophet i will never ever put myself as a solve of people's problems i can't i can't even solve the problem problem of me i can't solve my own problems why should i put another person to think i can solve that would be terrible and that's why these men with a little gift rising up and then they try to show as if they are powerful man look to me everybody look to me everybody look to me look to you and you can die tomorrow i don't point you to if i ever point you to myself then i will point you to that which is in me amen not me and then i'll tell you that which is in me can also be in you can be powered into your empty vessel so jesus is bringing the disciples to say you know we just have five loaves and two fishes and what does he say bring them here to me jesus did not ever say he is oh our treasurer judas can you give us some more shekels we go and buy some more oh bring here the man i multiply the man and you go and dive more food no bring that which you already have here that which you already have with you by default as i speak is what is going to feed these thousands of people so it will actually be you who would have given them the what the food because my work is i'm going to just multiply what you have i'm not going to give them you are the ones who is giving them me i'm just multiplying like you know the prophetic message to the church to that widow didn't create the oil it only multiplied the oil blessed be the name of the lord so this is where we are now friends you have in your house you have brought into your mother's house that bridegroom that pot of oil that can solve all your problems he's right in you and you don't have to look elsewhere you don't have to look elsewhere you are that bright just convince yourself that i am that bright start preaching to yourself now i am that bride i am that word bride i am that tabernacle that vessel that temple that body of him and no matter how little it appears like i mean let me tell you it is actually not the that jesus who is in his little it is you are thinking and feeling attitude about him that makes him appear like he's little but let there become a right atmosphere a right attitude a right thought a right face and you see him running emotion you'll see him begin to go into action blessed be the name of the lord this is the jesus i'm talking about and i've seen him many times sometimes in the weakest of the moments sometimes when i'm sick myself weak myself and you pray for someone and someone is instantly healed and you wonder i was thinking i was i'm very weak i was thinking i'm very sick why am i why is this person getting because greta is he that is in you but these sicknesses sometimes just come as trials every child of god has to be tested so when you are tested there is no evidence that he has left you when you are going through a trial that is not proof that you are now backslidden there is no proof that god has left you that is no proof that he has become a little so small no the bible says greater is he that is in you then he that is the whole world put together he that is greater than all the atomic bombs the nuclear bombs and so forth these ones that they are scaring one another with russia is speaking america speaking britain is speaking nuclear new korean nuclear we have something more powerful than ukraine can a nuclear create anything can you create a bomb just destroys so which is easier it is more easier to destroy than to do something to create something is always more hard but to destroy it even this house if you want to dis demolish it in a matter of 30 minutes if you bring here what what is that machine they call it what it will just roll it down but to build it you can't build it in one hour so the devil is a destroyer but for us ours is a creator he builds glory to god so greater is he that is so here he says bring here to me what you have and he commanded the maori to sit down on the grass and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven and blessed and broke and gave the loves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did all it all and they were filled and they took up the fragments and remained in 12 baskets now the fragments were more than what the original fish and bread was five thousand men with the women whom we don't know the number the children have eaten and now they have gathered fragments you know 12 baskets come on the original pieces of bread and fish could not even fill one basket but now the remainder is 12 baskets because he's giving the twelve tribes of israel a testimony he's also giving the twelve disciples a testimony and the next miracle he feeds seven thousand and what happens i mean four thousand out of seven pieces of bread what happens they pick seven baskets which is a type of a testimony for the seven church ages and eventually all that you see you get seven plus five those are twelve pieces of bread and that represented the number of the disciples each one and then the last time when jesus warns them about the living of the pharisees they just remember that they have one bread from five to seven to one so jesus himself becomes the bread of life so it's no longer seven it's no longer five this one in the boat blessed be the name of the lord so what are we looking at here he picks what they had not buying one extra that which you already have and what is god going to use to shake this community what is god god to use to heal your neighbors to open your neighbors their eyes to save them to deliver them that week is in your house that is which is already in your house that man that you brought from the wilderness [Laughter] it's just he's just wait you know that little woman she now came to a point that her mind stopped she could no longer think normally because she has to build believe that i have to borrow the vessels and she went around borrowing vessels borrowing borrowing borrowing borrowing borrowing borrowing and filled the house until there was no space and then that is point number one step number one taken step number two i was supposed to shut the door okay now it's not supposed to be a public show off come and see me i am the man of the hour i am the woman of the hour i have got faith you see there's going to be a miracle here today no okay shut your doors with you and your children no man no show off he's going to do it and then what happens she starts i think she must have closed their eyes and she held the pot and she was pouring a little pot pouring into the big one this is a vessel this is a little boat and then she's pouring and the children must have rubbed their eyes and then it goes [Laughter] it's full take it bring another one and it goes mama what is happening the children when they realize what their mother's faith is doing the faith in the prophetic message they will be converted because they they were redeemed from the they were already taken but now they are being redeemed by the faith of the mother amen the faith of the mother standing with the word of the prophet he's redeeming her children back like you see sister hattie she had nothing you remember sister she was so poor she was washing i mean for people you know cleaning homes and so forth like the prophecy until the prophet didn't even want to take her offering when he was taking offerings and conditioning for the church and then he wanted to take back the money discretely and god rebuked him said she is not doing that for you it's me she has got a reward waiting for her at the end of the day what was the reward the redemption of her sons so poor so limited maybe a widow another one with the two rowdy renegades in the form of sons taken already they are already taken by the dead are already bonus men of the devil and the devil said ah you came to serve god to serve god to you you are a dedicated believer you believe the message of the prophet why doesn't the prophet pray for your children to be saved i think she had prayed and prayed and prayed but all she had to do is say the right word and then she enters into the same anointing speak the word speak the word not go and fast go and bring all the man in your drawer go and join this church go and do this speak the word here it is going to be done spoken what is the original seed and it's going to be the final seed manifested now what happens she says lo brother branham they desire she was now a believer speaking with a prophet the the first desire of my heart is the salvation of my children and they were they were given blessed be the name of the lord she was limited she couldn't even train them she couldn't even spank them she couldn't do nothing it was beyond her like the other widow in the bible it was beyond her and maybe today you are in a situation that apparently is beyond you your husband his condition is beyond you your wife his condition is beyond you your parents condition is beyond you your sister your brother your children are beyond you you they can't listen they have gone beyond but you have a relationship with a prophetic message the little oil is there glory be to god your faith in the word will bring a difference and i'm not going to argue with the dev over that i think i remember one day i was praying for someone and then when i prayed and she says i'm not going i've refused to i said god never commanded me to go into the world and argue with the demons like you know what do you want like spend the cost to say what is your name what do you want what do you want what i said i don't even speak with davos i i just said one thing devil i know one thing that first of all you are a liar so you are telling me lies that you are going nowhere when you have already gone you have no ground to stand here two i cannot ask you what you want because you were saying tell let me tell you what i want i said stop i don't want to ask to hear even what you want jesus already paid the price and that was the end of the problem that that woman was healed i prayed for another one reason i think three months ago a crazy woman you know and and the demons you know they they managed to bring her but her father was also running mad and and then the demon says we are killing both of them so when they brought her it was a wednesday i just came and i prayed for her and then she said today we are going to kill today we are going to kill her i said me have already prayed and therefore you have no power to kill her and i have no time to argue neither do i even have time to pray for her again i've prayed it's enough i can't make myself repetitive just because the devil is saying enco anco anco so that i keep repeating after what the devil wants me to repeat no and that was the end the devil killed the father of the girl the man died because he was not here he was not a believer but i prayed for this one and she was she's still not in the church she's normal so what am i saying there's some situations that you feel like i have prayed but i think it's not enough i don't have enough faith i don't have enough this i think i'm not a real good believer you are just hearing voices from your own realm you have your mind and faith is a super sense super sense of the super rest by the super seed so you got beyond the five senses you got the sixth sense which is super super sense faith and when that one speaks everything else keeps quiet and you have to tell even yourself it's already done take your hands from me take your mind from it you have nothing to do with it you already committed it to the one who to handle it you have nothing whether it takes a day or two days or five days just leave it it's done that's faith blessed be the name of the lord so shut the door until it's done and then the next thing will be a testimony who gave the testimony not the woman not the children the one whose debt was paid the one whose debt was paid he's the one who gave the testimony the testimony was i wonder how that old weak poor limited widow managed to get the money to pay me i went there to grab her children but he says look here's your cheque check okay if you don't want to check here's cash if you think i'm giving you a bouncing check take the cash what is happening am i seeing stars am i seeing reality this widow is paying all the that that was that she had as a dead plus all the interests everything is there where did she get the solution from who which man can you tell me neighbors has she brought here certainly man is there a man a tycoon that he has already what who is staying here [Laughter] some business mogul came here and he's giving her the dollars no she has never had that we have never seen anything but there's only one thing for sure that we are wondering she borrowed our empty vessels she bought all the empty vessels and we saw her selling some of the things she called the dealers of oil and they came here and they were buying oil the only thing is we don't know where the oil comes from but she saw the oil in the plenty where did the oil come from from the house was it already there no she borrowed our vessels it is the vessels that were carrying the oil but where did the oil come from we don't know oh glory be to god the oil came it was something that god had put in this widow's room house to solve our problems so friend aren't we happy aren't we a blessed people to see that in our houses there is a little port of oil you've brought him to your mother's house he's there he's the pot of oil and he's the one that will solve all your problems all spiritual mental psychological financial physical all social problems all demons or spirits he is the one he's the elsa died he's the one that can take care of all of them glory be to god this is the god i'm serving i don't know about you but as the god that i'm talking about blessed be the name of the lord and that's why i was saying yesterday those men said we have found him we have phoned him him of of whom spoke all the prophets and the law and all referred to him for us we have found him and when they phoned him what did they say you remember the disciples that came from john he said master where do you dwell we want to go to your home we want to go home we want to go into heavenly places to be together with you to have more fellowship with you and jesus took them to where he dwells the two disciples who broke away from john the baptist when he introduced reality to them so today when we saw we have phoned him where is he we didn't leave him in the streets we didn't leave him in the wilderness he came and we were ready to die with him you know so that he leaves like paul says in the garage galatians 20 i'm crucified i'm i'm dead but i'm not the one living it's christ living in me although i'm living it's not me living it's christ living in me blessed be the name of that soul that's why in the seals he says don't hurt the little oil and wine that little oil don't hurt it don't frustrate it don't impede it don't limit it don't bog it down its capabilities let it do its work don't deny it a chance to solve your problems don't overlook it to go for another solution elsewhere when you have that little oil there don't hurt it because when you hurt it what happens when you hurt the holy ghost the dove he flies away he goes back to the wilderness the only way you can avoid hurting him is when you are feeling his emotions and so forth dies and that means you have to die that's why he came with the anointing of francis and mark an anointing for the dead because this time he gets married to someone who is dying who is dead then you are remaining a dead one as he lives in you so he takes care of you who takes care of a dead body it's not anybody taking care about itself [Laughter] glory be to god okay okay let me finish let me come to this the prophet says so when the devil was gone from the boy the disciple says why couldn't we do it jesus said because of your animal not lack of power excuse me not lack of power the church has got power enough tonight right in this here in this group of people to do anything can you say amen to that oh are you sleeping somebody help me say amen to that the church has power enough tonight not tomorrow not after fasting not after you know you know doing this doing that tonight right here in here this group of people to do anything but you haven't got faith enough to do it listen you have faith enough to walk sir he now points to his other man now can you imagine you have enough faith if you are learned to walk you have enough faith if you have cancer here to be healed you have enough faith but the only thing is to you know remove the lead of it pop it off and let the faith flow freely you are restraining it you are controlling faith you don't want faith to exercise its ability so he says you've got you have faith enough to walk sir you have power enough if you have faith you've got power enough too ready you who is seated in the court if you would believe but that's up to you so we see where the prophet leaves you up to you that little pot of oil in your house is all able to solve all your problems but it's up to you i'm not going to do it for you it is a diy [Music] do it yourself it's up to you rather if you want to remain sick until jesus takes you home it is up to you if you want that cancer to eat you up until you go and die with it no problem what will i do jesus always asked do you believe do you believe that i can do this do you believe this can be done do you believe that you can i can make you have it according let's be a according to you uh so he says you have power enough lady two in the court if you would believe but it's up to you see they finish the work i couldn't do nothing and in other words i am here i'm the prophet you are they need a person you have debts you have problems you have issues i wish i could help you i wish i could do i could do something for but i can't and that's the problem of us preachers you are a pastor you are looking at a sheep it is suffering she's in trouble he's in trouble you he's sick he's but you cannot believe for him you cannot exercise that faith for him he has to do it because he's here as a believer and let me tell you it's much more easier for me to pray for a non-believer and he gets healed and pray for a believer sorry is much easier because my faith god will just honor it straight and heals that person that personally cannot believe but for you it's not a miracle for you it's divine healing you have to exercise your own faith i cannot do religion for you and i cannot even pray for you no this is what is going on in the world today we want a church where they do everything for us they sing for us they clap for us while we are there just soothing our thighs while let others clap me i'm just others let them lift their hands up and worship the lord for me me i will never lift up my hands let others pray and you know you come to church and you go back home you have not said the word to god what did you come to do just to hear god speak did you speak back is that a communion communion is when the two commune what have you done you came to church god spoke did you answer back did you pray nothing we are in a religion where they want like back to catholicism you know they pray for you mary mother god of mother of god pray for us sinners joseph pray for us sinners so and so pray for us sinners so you don't pray they pray for you that's the problem if i was to even tell you now after this service let everyone talk to god not even two minutes everybody will be quiet they want the pastor to come and pray for them something's wrong why are you fearing to talk to your god who will pray for you why don't you pray why can't you even pray to god five minutes he is your god he is not just my god for you i mean i'm not a booster that you connect god through you have to have a connection direct because you are the bride which bride hires another person to speak for on her behalf to her husband which one hey i see you sitting with your husbands next i see very close okay if you want to speak to him you hire somebody no somebody come and speak for me to my husband i'm gonna come and tell him i need this i need to eat a candy i want who hires and if jesus is your husband is your bridegroom you come to church and what it is my house shall be called the house of prayer did you come in this house and pray can you deal with that question today you came to this house did you pray oh they prayed for you they prayed the opening prayer they prayed for prayer requests they prayed before they preached they prayed after preaching and then did you pray oh brother yesterday excuse me i'm not teaching here church order i hope i'm not breaking order here but i'm just simply reminding ourselves what did jesus say my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer so who prays only pastors only song leaders oh you pray and when did you pray oh i am going to judge to pray okay have you prayed so no one is going to do a religion for you amen if you want everything to be done for you then you are denying him he is not yours so how do you now relate with him when there is a meeting that's why you are in frantic search for somebody somebody somebody can't handle the situation somebody they have tried the pastor's numbers off i've tried brothers and so i've tried my husband's name why are you frantic why don't you have a direct connection to your savior to your god god doesn't have grandchildren at least brother branham told us that he has children who prays for you who should and what should you do that's why the prophet is he's putting a disclaimer he's saying you have enough faith you have got the word you believed the word your god is children you are here but if you have trouble it's up to you what to do about that even if you came here the lady has hands upon you but if your faith is not activated to receive it it's actually you to move the gift not the gift to move you that's what the prophet said uh-huh so that's why i told you it's much more more easier for me i've prayed for thousands of people but it's always much easier for me to pray for an unbeliever and they get their instant healing but it's always very hard when you're dealing with a believer because they know the word and if they have issues in their lives that they were supposed to put it right and they have not put it right it's a problem if they come to be prayed for as a second option but reluctantly it's not something that they are desperate that god should intervene then god will also take them in the same angle they have come but god is not the first option it's a reluctant going to be prayed for but i have my good doctor no problem have you a good doctor until the day when your doctor says it's beyond me now now what will you do then brother maher abraham i think you are becoming too tough well if you are tough you get going we shall keep going together with you it's not a mistake i'm just simply you know paraphrasing on what a prophet is saying he says it's up to you see because it's a finished work i couldn't do nothing now listen to this statement if christ was standing right here with his suit on if jesus was to be here with his suit all he couldn't do nothing for you think about it he could not do anything better than brother just on what he's doing now and what i'm doing now he can't do anything for you because he has already done it he's already finished his calvary so it is you to activate it it's you to borrow the empty vessels it is you to take the effort to pour the oil into the empty vessels it is you to go back and say now i have oil field everywhere what do i do go and sell and it's you to look for the market to sell the oil it's to you to get a man and take it back and pay not a profit not a god you aha some good food for thought isn't it he says what we need today is not to pray for more power you got enough power to make a new earth eh i need more power brother more anointing i needed this i needed this you don't need to pray for my power we you got enough power to make a new earth to create another one even if you had a trillions of goddess power in you what you need is the faith to use that power what you need is control that life control that life with life the life of the world control that life and live such a godly life live such a godly life so that when you ask god anything when you ask god anything you know he's going to do it unite because you live such a godly life you are like god to be godless to be like a god and how do you live like god living the life of the word of god when you live the life of the world because god is the word then you are godly so you what you need to do is control that life and live such a good life that when you ask god anything you know you know we have confidence in god of that we know if we keep his commandments he will withhold no good things from us if we will walk with him god walking with us oh my they had but one thing to do they had but one thing to do that is stay straight on the course be steady you know english is not my language so i don't have enough vocabulary to bring this very clear be steady i wish i was back in uganda i would be now bringing it in my language please steady don't be wandering meandering be focused not wander off here over here and wander off over there but stay on the course the church has got but one thing today to do stay on the course they had a pit of fire they had to keep themselves in the course by following that pill of fire that's what led them the objective they could see was that pill of fire they seen it walking through moses and they know it it was he was the leader and today we got the word we follow the word and this we see the word working in the believers and we know that is so then god working with us confirming the word with a sign is following we stay with the word and when we stay with the word the word produces the results she stayed with the word followed the word was led by the word the peer of fire she had respect to the prophet and she could take what the prophet says verbatim and believes it without question and it brought solution to her home and all her debts were paid and she had a surplus i want to tell you friends we have to pay all the debts and we shall have surplus before we go home all day all diseases all afflictions all torments all forces all those demons you inherited from your parents your the other characters she's like her mother she's gross i'm like how daddy was she's this she's very agitating she's this he's you know he is this he he looks like those you know look he has them squirrel eyes and he will always look down narrow on you and overlook you know all those kind of traits that you have inherited pay those debts let them all be paid away and then manifest the life of the word of jesus and when you manifest the life of the world you know what is going to happen he is going to produce the results would you now go back and tell that woman look you have been following a false prophet this message that you have believed is wrong i see a lot of errors in the elisha ministry i see a lot of errors could you convince her she knew where she was standing you know why some people are being convinced away because they have never had their hand on first-hand experience with the god of this message and why because they have not brought him in the house because when he comes in the house he's there in the airport and he's going to solve all your problems may god bless you let's stand up there is a song which says i can i will i do believe why shouldn't you believe when you're a believer why shouldn't you believe that your problems are going to be solved why shouldn't you believe that the little pot in your house will solve all your problems you can because you're already a believer you can because it's not even you it's him in you believing in his own word taking care of his own promises he cannot permit that his glory shares with anybody he cannot see you suffering and he just sits by and concerned but he wants you to be a believer to be a perfect perfected in that faith that's why he lets you take that step he's a diplomat he's a gentleman he honors his word the order that he gave that these things must be done like when he told this lady go and borrow she had to go and borrow and then feel she had to do it so do it they are certain there are certain things that are diys that you have to do he respects your part so when you do your part i want to assure you brother sister he's going to do his part [Music] [Music] i can [Music] i [Music] i'm trusting only in the lord trying me down well i'm trusting only in the lord trusting allah [Music] [Music] i do believe that jesus heals me now he heals you now not tomorrow don't you ever give yourself a tomorrow because when you say tomorrow next month this year you have put yourself out of it because one day with the lord means a thousand years so if you put yourself tomorrow that means you'll never get the promise you have to speak bible language bible language is now so even if it takes one year from now that's still now that's now that's today tomorrow is not yours tomorrow is a thousand years from now now is your time once more i can i will [Applause] that jesus we are going to pray now maybe you can speak to him in your heart tell him what you want tell him right now lord this is my problem this is the death this is the situation this is the condition this is the predicament that i'm faced with lord but you are here in this house you are that pot of oil that is in this house you are the one i picked that i looked for from the wilderness me i'm dead i can do nothing but i'm believing the lord god you can pay all my debts you can solve all my problems speak to him now as i pray lord jesus we are here as your children gathered in your house after your word has gone forth and lord god is all your children this is the little bride the white bride waiting on the prophetic message getting their advice their revelation they understand the solution to their issues to their hardships to the complexes from the prophetic word and now god you have already told us that which is in our house already has to be highlighted as the solution to all that we have as problems be it sickness be it torment affliction pains whatever demon lord we want to take our standing face we want to move any claim lay a hole over the promise and tell the devil you are a liar you have oppressed me psychologically spiritually mentally long time you have tormented me by telling me who will solve this who will hear this who will deliver you from this today i have understood today i have realized that he that is in me he that is in my house he that is already me is the solution to all my problems lord we claim the solution we claim the manifestation thereof we claim the testimony thereof we claim the glory thereof we claim the fruits thereof to be manifested lord and i pray lord god that your blessing will be upon your children that you are knowing to them that you are knowing the faith in them that you are going to the revelation in us that we shall be lord obedient to the prophetic message that's what delivered this all human that's what delivered that church like you said there is already people in the land who under their prophet shall be the final voice to the final five of age and lord god help us to be under that voice under the prophetic message to be subject to what the message tells us and that i know that everest problem every hardship every trial will be solved i commend them into your hands i believe that record you are here to transform the situation we can imagine the joy that filled in that family the thanksgiving that was in that family when their debts were paid when the children were redeemed thank you father i know that god when you bring this to pass and i know you have done it then we shall be careful to achieve all the glory and honor and praise and worship unto you bless the pastor brother jason bless all the ministers here bless all the deacons and trustees and all the believers achieve them the christ and bless your children around the world father that we shall understand the time that we are living in and how we are going to come out of the predicaments the trials the hardships the impediments the sicknesses the troubles that our lord god by faith in us grant is lord i commit them into your hands by faith in jesus name i pray amen listen i'm holding only on his promises i'm hoping only on his promises i'm holding [Music] and i will [Applause] that whatever it is friends mind body or soul he's your healer oh i can i will right now i can i will i do believe [Applause] you know some jesus never had a problem with demons they they presented no obstacle to jesus he just speaking cast them out left and right in droves he would just cast them out the only thing that ever presented with problems was people it was the people in the house of jarius trying to keep the girl from being raised it was it was the people of his own country in his own city where he's raised and his family members it was always people it was the it was the disciples in the boat lord don't you care that we perish those waves meant nothing to him those demons on every wave meant nothing he just spoke he just spoke he just spoke peace be still a man of few words but tremendous power he's not worried about a problem and all he's got to get used to say i can i will i do why will you because i can so i will oh you're here today what a privilege i can oh i can't i will glory is is me now oh glory to god friends blessed be the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] that means a great deal to me because i got all my problems and things i'm dealing with and i got all of yours too amen hallelujah i've got to say lord here's this brother with this situation here's a sister with this here's a teenager here's a marriage here's this i can i will i do believe i can i will i do every problem i got i can't everyone you got i do believe that jesus heals me now right now right now right now hallelujah oh the solution was there all the time friends oh i thought about you know i thought about that father who had gone that priest that he had been a priest and he had passed away i thought how thankful he must have been how you know that he may have not left him with a lot of wealth but he left them with oil he made sure oils and then oh i taste some i may leave my family tomorrow i may leave this church i may not leave you with a lot of wealth i may not leave my family with a lot of property but i'll leave him with the token i'll leave him with faith in god's presence in our lives and homes oh i think what a what a joyous what a happy feeling that father if he could have looked over the banister and said i left him with the most valuable thing hallelujah and you can tell they they saw that as the la as the most valuable thing the oil they'd already that was that that was the last thing they held on to they'd already lost everything else but they held on to the last thing held on to that oil because you know why that was the most valuable thing she doesn't mention what do you have she doesn't talk about furniture she doesn't talk about property she doesn't even talk about a garden or food or anything we could do she says well we have some oil oh hallelujah say i got this problem i got that problem i got this problem you know what all that problem is it's an empty vessel just get the oil poured into it and that problem will go away oh i think about satan because that's who that that creditor represented you know that you can see it in the scripture because he tried to make the boys a bond servant and that's illegal the law of moses that's strictly legal you can't make you can't make your fellow israelites bonds servants you could only make them hired servants that's the law of moses only allowed them to be hired servants they could not be a fellow jew couldn't be a bond servant so it proved it was the devil trying to break the word of god trying to make him bond servants but the devil came to a house that had oil in it the devil came to a house who had a daughter of zion who believed jehovah and had respect to his prophet oh glory to god oh my friends i can i will i do believe right now and i will i do believe i can i will i do believe that jesus mind body whatever it is oh i can i will i do believe [Music] i do believe that jesus heals [Music] oh what a what a what a what a uh three service trifecta of glory amen and for the brothers who were at the breakfast oh my we we just we just been in as brother eddie would say we've been in high cotton yeah amen there's honey in the rock my brother there's honey in the rock for you have you enjoyed god's presence among us today the lord's servant and the word that's came forth wednesday saturday saturday morning saturday night sunday morning amen i'd like to give the lord and his servant a round of applause amen oh my god oh you just identify the devil friends the word will identify him don't worry word will identify him see it identified that creditor that was that was a type of satan coming because he was trying to break the word what he was even suggesting was completely against god's law and so that identified him but you know he came to the wrong house [Music] you know what he came to he came to a house that valued the token above all other earthly things there was nothing more valuable in that home the last thing they held onto was the token and he come to a house that that that a father had taught them to value the most valuable commodity they own i just say fathers husbands preachers make sure you teach your congregations teach your families teach your wives teach your children to value the token above all other earthly considerations even all of them combined it wouldn't matter what she had ever had if she'd had everything she'd ever had none of it would have saved her but the oil saved her i have i you know i i i say now i know the lord's answer we have the devil's answer from the lord before he even showed up with the problem amen before that devil creditor showed up with a problem god already had the answer right now she just had to be made aware of it see and how did she get made aware of it because she had confidence in god's messenger so i don't know if i got confidence in god's messenger okay well go ahead and try that see what happens yeah and try that yeah see how that works out for you it ain't going to end well amen but here was a daughter of zion who had faith in god's word and confidence in his messenger she didn't argue she didn't second guess she didn't question she just went barred at all close the door and away and did and did the work and then she she had to go borrow it she had to fill it then she had to go sell it and she had to pay it and and at the end of the day the lord got all the glory because she allowed him to work through my my goodness my goodness so now we know now we know what it means to have to to for for her to have said i brought him back to my mother's chamber or for isaac to take uh the his rebecca and take it into his mother's tent because this is the invisible union friends that's whether it's whether it's him to her or her to him it's it's an invisible union and in there all things are possible that's that's that little room that's the third pool my that's where satan is already he already was already too late you know when that creditor showed up when satan shows up it's already too late he tells you he's going to take your children and make bond servants out of them so they can never go free don't you believe it don't you believe it they might have been born in sin they might be a hired servant well they might have to do whatever until until the master sets them free but don't you think don't ever let that devil tell you he can hang on to him because they're the heritage of the lord and they were given to you on purpose hallelujah oh my to say no i'm never going to surrender them there my children will never be bond slaves to the devil hallelujah they're going to need to get the holy ghost and i'll keep praying until god does it amen praise the name of the lord my life set you all down and preach for another hour wow hallelujah hallelujah oh it's been grand to be here and i was telling brother abraham half the church wants to come with me when i go to uganda so he's already plotting he's already plotting he's already plotting a solution how to figure that out amen so i don't know we'll see what the lord does i know one of these days i'll go see him and i won't need a 747 to do it oh man he won't he won't need to go to an embassy and apply for a visa amen we'll i'll
