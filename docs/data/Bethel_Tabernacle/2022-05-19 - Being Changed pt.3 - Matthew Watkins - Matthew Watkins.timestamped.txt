[43:23] i've went back i think twice and

[43:41] thank you god bless you
[43:43] i want you to turn to philippians
[43:44] chapter one if you have your bible
[43:46] amen philippians chapter one
[43:50] just have some announcements that we
[43:51] want to
[43:53] to read or to say
[43:55] before we begin
[43:56] um one thing is is that we've had a lot
[43:59] of requests for water uh we don't have
[44:01] really a vestibule lord willing and the
[44:03] remodel will have that but we don't
[44:05] really have a place for that right now
[44:07] and so uh we've we've put it out front
[44:09] here for tonight
[44:11] just for our own local assembly
[44:14] um
[44:15] to be able to have i know many times
[44:17] i've seen people raid the back office
[44:18] and break into the pastor's office
[44:20] there's still a water from the
[44:22] refrigerator and if they don't do that
[44:23] they go into the fellowship poll and
[44:25] i've seen people go up to walgreens and
[44:27] you're thirsty and so we get that so we
[44:29] want to try to meet that need so tonight
[44:32] the water table is there out front but
[44:35] that's just for tonight only
[44:37] going forward it will be under the
[44:38] pavilion so that same water table that
[44:40] you see out there we're going to have we
[44:42] can't promise that it'll be there every
[44:45] single service but at the time but we're
[44:46] going to do our best
[44:48] to get you some refreshments um and some
[44:51] water out there now let me just say this
[44:53] this is important that that's a trial
[44:55] that we're gonna try to run and the
[44:57] hesitation to do that is children little
[45:01] children making constant trips in and
[45:03] out of the church now that they know
[45:05] there's a water table there
[45:06] so the
[45:08] we're going to try it
[45:09] if it turns into more traffic and more
[45:12] people leaving the service during the
[45:13] preaching and during the singing and
[45:15] after service it's going to get nixed
[45:17] it's going to be canceled
[45:20] but uh so just do your best
[45:22] to just refresh yourself before you come
[45:24] in here if you absolutely have to leave
[45:26] and go out
[45:27] then you'll know where that's at
[45:31] and so yeah i think that was all for
[45:33] that brother joe good to see you sister
[45:35] becky your entire family here god bless
[45:37] you to the how to shells amen and we're
[45:39] missing a lot of people here tonight
[45:41] glad to see some uh some new faces but i
[45:44] think everyone might have thought church
[45:46] got cancelled again uh since the
[45:48] meetings that we had but we're in church
[45:50] we're in service so we miss you amen
[45:52] come back to service
[45:54] amen uh we also have uh we also have an
[45:58] announcement let me just say this that
[45:59] we're desperately trying to
[46:02] raise money for our uh youth group and
[46:05] it's specifically the senior youth we've
[46:08] got a lot of
[46:09] a lot of burdens and ideas and a vision
[46:13] that we're trying to accomplish even
[46:14] these meetings that we just had
[46:17] was really just a fruit of that burden
[46:19] that we've had
[46:21] to do something for the young people we
[46:23] have ideas that take them
[46:25] on trips into different meetings and
[46:27] different camps
[46:28] uh and we we've even have a trip that's
[46:30] planned um
[46:33] for
[46:34] july to byc and there's a lot of kids a
[46:37] lot of the young people that are
[46:38] registered to go to that and so we have
[46:40] a great need in our church we have a lot
[46:42] of young people and a great need and i
[46:44] don't believe that as i've said it and i
[46:47] just agree with it so much the youth is
[46:49] not the church of tomorrow they're the
[46:51] church of today
[46:52] and so we it's a it's a good thing to
[46:55] invest in and to give to i can tell you
[46:57] that the youth fund
[46:59] mostly stays depleted without anything
[47:02] um without any money in it very little
[47:05] offerings there are some who contribute
[47:07] very little up to this point has been
[47:08] given to it and so a lot of the expense
[47:11] just uh is paid um you know and and we
[47:14] just do our best to come up with you
[47:16] know a meeting like even this meeting
[47:18] that we just had last weekend i can just
[47:21] tell you that was thousands and
[47:23] thousands in excess of five to seven
[47:25] thousand dollars or probably more than
[47:27] that i don't have the exact figure just
[47:29] to run that meeting that we had and it
[47:31] was not paid for by the by the
[47:33] registration that was the little bitty
[47:35] 15 that we were charging and we allowed
[47:38] for donations and we're grateful for
[47:40] those donations that came in it helped
[47:43] uh offset some of the cost but it by no
[47:46] means covered the cost the offerings we
[47:48] took up by no means covered the cost
[47:51] and we don't i don't say that to
[47:53] complain in any way i just say that so
[47:54] that you know and you're aware those of
[47:57] you online that aren't here that are
[47:58] streaming those of you present
[48:01] you know when you give towards the youth
[48:03] fund we can i can promise you when you
[48:05] give towards that youth fund 100 of it
[48:08] goes into the bethel youth account that
[48:10] we have we have a separate account and
[48:12] it goes strictly to
[48:14] uh to meetings camps youth functions and
[48:18] i promise you our young people
[48:20] appreciate it so much and lives have
[48:22] been changed by the efforts that uh
[48:25] parents have got behind and and and uh
[48:27] i'm not in any way this is no in no way
[48:29] to make an appeal
[48:31] um to for money but just to say that
[48:33] just keep that in mind and remember that
[48:35] that there's a lot that we want to do to
[48:38] uh
[48:39] with the young people but we're limited
[48:41] to what we can do there's been meetings
[48:43] it's happened twice or we just couldn't
[48:45] there was not the money it wasn't there
[48:47] we couldn't go so our ch our kids didn't
[48:49] have a way to go and maybe some of them
[48:51] traveled individually and parents got
[48:53] behind that but we'd like to do things
[48:55] as a group we'd like to take a ve just
[48:58] our most upcoming meeting that we're
[49:00] having our upcoming trip is to byc we'd
[49:03] like to rent a 15 passenger van to take
[49:05] them we'd like to um you got gas with
[49:07] that you got the vehicle rental you got
[49:09] the expenses for those volunteers
[49:11] that'll travel
[49:12] and so
[49:14] um there's a lot that we're uh that
[49:16] we're wanting to do and we have some
[49:18] good ideas we want to stay proactive and
[49:21] uh to be able to raise money for the
[49:23] senior youth to be able to get together
[49:24] not just always we don't just plan
[49:27] things always for meetings or bible
[49:28] studies but we've planned some fun
[49:30] things just for them to get together i
[49:32] can promise you it's essential that your
[49:35] youth function and fellowship one with
[49:38] another it's who they've got and if you
[49:40] don't feel that
[49:42] social friendship connection with
[49:44] believers they'll fill it somewhere else
[49:48] and so we want to do everything we can
[49:50] the bible says that you know to have
[49:52] fellowship one with another though we
[49:54] say it all the time it's good to be with
[49:56] people of like precious faith and that
[49:58] couldn't be truer and more urgent and
[50:00] important than with our young people can
[50:02] i get an amen from the youth
[50:04] thanks guys i'm up here for you
[50:08] and so uh so we'll be we're gonna be
[50:11] doing uh some things to try to raise uh
[50:14] money myself my wife brother jason demar
[50:17] sister amy who work with the senior
[50:18] youth directly um are gonna start we've
[50:21] started we're gonna start doing
[50:23] something we're gonna start stalking
[50:25] snacks and drinks
[50:27] in the fellowship poll
[50:29] i want to make sure get this right for
[50:31] concessions to raise money for the
[50:33] senior youth
[50:34] we will be working out the details of
[50:36] what we're going to be getting and the
[50:38] prices this week but it will be there on
[50:40] sunday to purchase and so um
[50:43] it's a there will be no one there
[50:45] monitoring the concessions there will be
[50:47] a box there for you there'll be i think
[50:49] we have some iced coffees and snacks and
[50:52] drinks and different things there'll be
[50:53] no one there monitoring that taking your
[50:55] money we'll have a box there
[50:58] so scout's honor right make sure you do
[51:00] things
[51:01] above board
[51:02] we believe we're the body of christ and
[51:04] we don't do anything dishonestly so just
[51:06] make sure if you take something you give
[51:08] to it let me say let me encourage you to
[51:10] give above the the amount that we're
[51:12] charging there was a brother a young
[51:14] brother a a youth that visited our
[51:17] meetings and we were selling coffees
[51:19] that we purchased at the park we did
[51:21] that that helps offset some more cost
[51:24] and uh we were charging uh three or four
[51:26] dollars for the iced coffee and a
[51:28] brother came up and said i wanna i want
[51:30] a nice coffee and here's a hundred
[51:31] dollar bill to pay for it
[51:33] and that was a that was a way for a
[51:36] young person and i promise you that
[51:38] young person will be blessed
[51:40] for his effort and for what he did so
[51:42] give above above and beyond lord lay
[51:44] something special in your heart um to
[51:46] give to the youth then we'd encourage
[51:48] you to do that there'll be nobody like i
[51:50] said monitoring that so it's just on a
[51:52] just trusting a trust basis um you can
[51:55] pay what we're asking yeah there will be
[51:57] a way i think also
[51:59] um i think we're gonna do something so
[52:01] that we can accept cash app and vinmo or
[52:04] whatever paypal or whatever you want to
[52:05] use i think we're going to do that not
[52:06] positive yet but there will definitely
[52:08] be a way for you to pay with cash
[52:10] for those drinks and every all of the
[52:13] proceeds that we get from that will go
[52:15] to the youth account and it will be
[52:16] spent for youth functions to take them
[52:19] on trips to camps uh and things in our
[52:22] mo and as i said um i just don't believe
[52:25] we could do enough
[52:27] and we could ever labor tire ourselves
[52:29] enough for the next generation
[52:32] his brother aaron mcgarry said if we
[52:34] could accomplish anything it would be to
[52:36] propel them further than we've ever gone
[52:39] amen it says that even
[52:41] on your passport if you ever open up u.s
[52:43] passport it talks about that the
[52:44] responsibility of this generation is is
[52:48] the preceding generation is to further
[52:50] the next generation and our interest is
[52:53] not socially or monetarily or
[52:56] educationally those are all good but our
[52:58] interest is to further your children in
[53:00] the kingdom of god
[53:02] amen
[53:04] we all feel that way as parents amen
[53:06] praise the lord i think that's all that
[53:08] we had so again that will be ready uh
[53:11] for uh for you on sunday so you can uh
[53:14] you can purchase that there all right
[53:17] let's turn to our bibles philippians
[53:18] chapter one
[53:20] i would like to minister to you just on
[53:22] a third part gonna carry this
[53:24] uh being changed what we spoke on in two
[53:27] parts we're going to continue that now
[53:29] let's just begin reading here at verse
[53:31] 13. we're going to read in philippians
[53:34] uh let's begin with verse 12. but i
[53:37] would you should understand brethren
[53:39] that the things which happen unto me
[53:41] have fallen out he says the things which
[53:43] have happened unto me fallen out rather
[53:46] unto the furtherance of the gospel so
[53:48] that my bonds in christ are manifest in
[53:52] all the palace
[53:53] and in all and in all other places
[53:57] and many of the brethren and the lord
[53:59] waxing confident by my bonds are much
[54:01] more bold to speak the word without fear
[54:04] some indeed preach christ even of envy
[54:06] and strife and some also of good will
[54:09] the one preached christ of contention
[54:11] not sincerely supposing to add
[54:13] affliction to my bonds but the other of
[54:16] love knowing that i am set for the
[54:17] defense of the gospel what then
[54:20] notwithstanding every way whether in
[54:23] pretense or in truth christ is preached
[54:26] and i therein do rejoice yea and will
[54:30] rejoice
[54:31] for i know this is the scripture we want
[54:33] to key on
[54:34] for i know
[54:36] that this shall turn to my salvation
[54:39] through your prayer how important
[54:42] was the prayers of the saints
[54:44] to paul
[54:46] when he's in prison amen for i know that
[54:49] this shall turn to my salvation through
[54:51] your prayer and the supply of the spirit
[54:56] of jesus christ and the supply of the
[54:59] spirit of jesus christ lord we bow our
[55:02] heads now just before you
[55:04] lord we've waited on you and even lord
[55:07] to surrender in ourselves before we came
[55:09] out once again lord i raise my hands and
[55:12] invite anyone to do it with me to say
[55:14] lord i surrender my mind my body my soul
[55:18] my spirit i just surrender it now to
[55:20] your word lord i become subservient to
[55:23] this word this headship lord by your
[55:26] spirit lord i pray that you would take
[55:28] every spirit under your control now for
[55:30] the glory of god may your word go forth
[55:33] unhindered in the hearts of your
[55:36] children lord i pray god that you would
[55:38] speak what you want to speak lord and
[55:40] keep me from saying anything that you
[55:42] would want to be said we ask it now in
[55:45] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[55:47] the church said
[55:49] amen you can be seated
[55:51] jesus makes a statement and i've read
[55:53] this before and spoke an entire sermon
[55:56] on it it's the direction we're just
[55:57] going to go as we begin to speak about
[55:59] this thought here he makes this
[56:02] statement in matthew chapter 12 and i
[56:04] want you just to use if you could put it
[56:05] on the screen for me here and he begins
[56:08] to say this here in verse 5 of matthew
[56:10] chapter 12 or have you not read in the
[56:13] law how that on the sabbath day the
[56:15] priest and the temple profane the
[56:17] sabbath and are blameless but i say unto
[56:20] you that in this place
[56:23] is one greater than the temple it's
[56:26] amazing because when he uses this word
[56:28] temple this is a word that is uh
[56:31] extremely
[56:33] important and relevant to a jew it would
[56:36] be relevant then it would still have its
[56:39] relevance now when you say that word
[56:41] temple this is something that is very
[56:44] close to the jewish mind to the hebrew
[56:47] mind
[56:48] because it dates all and you say did it
[56:50] where did it come from well you see it
[56:52] didn't start in the hearts or the minds
[56:54] of jews but it actually started in the
[56:57] mind of god that even the lord would say
[56:59] i desire to have a temple a house
[57:05] a building a place where i can dwell
[57:07] somewhere where i can
[57:09] inhabit and so the word temple is very
[57:12] close to the heart and the mind of god
[57:15] and so he says here in the very in the
[57:17] book of exodus he tells moses uh i would
[57:21] i would that you would build me a house
[57:23] build me a temple a place that i can
[57:26] dwell a place that i can reside a home a
[57:30] dwelling place it's all the way in the
[57:32] book of corinthians and philippians and
[57:34] paul speaks about how that you are
[57:37] that your body know you not as the
[57:39] temple of the holy ghost it's the house
[57:42] or the habitation where the lord dwells
[57:45] even after when god comes and he and
[57:47] he's dwelling there in eden which we
[57:49] know was a place of an atmosphere prior
[57:52] to the fall the adam and eve experience
[57:55] and there's so much that is existing
[57:58] there uh in that perfect condition that
[58:02] doesn't exist in humanity today we heard
[58:05] ecclesiastes as brother aaron went
[58:07] through the current state of mankind and
[58:10] there there was there was attributes of
[58:12] the presence of god that they had every
[58:15] day that that was just automatic by
[58:17] default it was there so the atmosphere
[58:20] and the condition that they lived in in
[58:21] a perfection where there was the
[58:24] presence of god the air that they
[58:25] breathed wasn't polluted
[58:28] uh that the their minds were not
[58:30] polluted with the evil thoughts from an
[58:32] evil world because that eden was perfect
[58:35] it was a place where there was no fear
[58:37] that entered into the mind of adam or
[58:39] into the heart of adam or eve there was
[58:42] no anxiety there was no depression there
[58:44] was no uh hesitation there was no
[58:47] struggle it was just a perfect uh
[58:49] perfect place a perfect eden
[58:52] and we know that after from the very
[58:54] minute and i was even hearing brother
[58:56] aaron as he said that if you could just
[58:58] imagine if you could be in the body or
[59:00] the mind we can't we could only imagine
[59:02] but we can only imagine what it would be
[59:04] to be in the mind or the body of adam as
[59:07] when sin entered in and now all of these
[59:10] emotions and all of these feelings and
[59:13] all of this stress and all of this pain
[59:15] and sorrow that he never humanity had
[59:18] never experienced now they experience it
[59:21] for the first time
[59:23] had to be quite overwhelming to
[59:25] experience as the bible says he he even
[59:28] even the very first attribute of that
[59:31] fallen condition was fear
[59:34] because adam says i was afraid and so i
[59:37] hid myself this is something he had
[59:38] never experienced before to hide from
[59:41] the presence of the lord and now where
[59:43] there was a a magnetization to the
[59:47] presence and the atmosphere and the
[59:49] fellowship of god as brother branham
[59:50] says god would come down in the cool of
[59:52] the evening and fellowship now there was
[59:54] a detraction now there was a repelling
[59:57] now man is running from the presence of
[59:59] god and running from his creator
[1:00:02] and so god the one of the saddest
[1:00:04] scriptures in the bible is the bible
[1:00:06] says that so
[1:00:07] god drove out the man from the midst of
[1:00:10] the garden and he places at the entrance
[1:00:13] to cherubims with flaming swords to
[1:00:15] guard the way
[1:00:17] amen we know it wasn't to a geographical
[1:00:20] location that he's guarded it wasn't to
[1:00:22] a place somewhere over in africa and if
[1:00:24] we could just find where the first
[1:00:26] garden of eden was i'm sure that
[1:00:29] you know we would enter that atmosphere
[1:00:30] no it wasn't a it wasn't about a
[1:00:32] geographical location but it was about a
[1:00:35] condition of faith and a condition of
[1:00:39] the heart and the mind where there was
[1:00:40] perfection and there was there it was a
[1:00:43] condition of life and this is what god
[1:00:45] was guarding the way back to
[1:00:48] to that condition
[1:00:50] that adam and eve had in the beginning
[1:00:54] immediately after that the plan of
[1:00:55] redemption we know that all of this is
[1:00:57] according to the purpose of god
[1:01:00] all of this was predestinated as god
[1:01:02] says that
[1:01:03] that that god would it would necessitate
[1:01:06] that he would have to have someone who
[1:01:09] fell and someone who was fallen in sin
[1:01:12] to become a redeemer and to become a
[1:01:14] savior we know all of this it's all
[1:01:16] elementary to us
[1:01:18] but god immediately starts
[1:01:20] as he drives man from the garden and now
[1:01:23] he works towards his plan always moving
[1:01:26] towards
[1:01:27] something and if i don't get very far
[1:01:29] here tonight lord willing we'll pick it
[1:01:31] up
[1:01:32] on sunday so i'm not going to try to be
[1:01:34] in a hurry here as we got tonight and
[1:01:37] sunday to be able to express this
[1:01:39] but
[1:01:40] god's always his heart is always moving
[1:01:42] forward i want you to do this i know
[1:01:44] it's wednesday so i'm going to lay just
[1:01:46] some very simple principles not get too
[1:01:48] bogged down in teaching but just lay
[1:01:50] some simple principles that you could
[1:01:52] take and they would be an encouragement
[1:01:54] to you and you could you could just have
[1:01:56] them so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna
[1:01:57] lay some of this out in a very
[1:01:58] simplistic way and then we'll circle
[1:02:01] back to it but i want to say that one of
[1:02:03] the principles of god is that he's
[1:02:05] always moving forward
[1:02:08] he's never going backwards and he's
[1:02:11] never in neutral
[1:02:14] he's always moving forward
[1:02:16] and everything that you see all the way
[1:02:18] from the the order of the eden and then
[1:02:21] from the eden to the children of seth as
[1:02:23] the bible says they begin men became to
[1:02:26] call upon the name of the lord then
[1:02:28] through nimrod as we see destruction
[1:02:30] through babylon then it moved from there
[1:02:32] from the dispensation of kings and moves
[1:02:34] to prophets and and so all of those
[1:02:37] dispensations that go all the way
[1:02:39] through
[1:02:40] all the way to the advent of the first
[1:02:42] coming of christ remember god is always
[1:02:45] moving towards a vision he's always
[1:02:48] moving forward he's not making it up as
[1:02:52] he goes he's not up there just randomly
[1:02:54] as it comes at him and as as the
[1:02:56] challenges of the enemy comes and his
[1:02:58] man sort of does what they do than god
[1:03:01] is god let me say this god is not
[1:03:02] reactionary all right
[1:03:05] we're very reactionary kind of people
[1:03:08] we just react to something and then
[1:03:09] sometimes we have a good reaction and
[1:03:11] then other times we don't have so good
[1:03:12] of a reaction and we have to call and
[1:03:14] apologize and make it up god never does
[1:03:16] that
[1:03:18] he never has a sudden reaction but he's
[1:03:20] already pre-planned he's already
[1:03:23] premeditated he's already got a plan
[1:03:26] before the curse ever enters he's
[1:03:29] already has the entire course of mankind
[1:03:32] and the plan of redemption charted from
[1:03:35] the beginning all the way to the end
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:40] can you say amen
[1:03:42] and so he's moving towards something his
[1:03:44] heart is always moving towards a vision
[1:03:47] always one plan
[1:03:49] brother branham and christ the mister of
[1:03:51] god revealed you can go and pick that up
[1:03:52] and i'm sure you're familiar with him
[1:03:54] saying this that he had a three-fold
[1:03:57] purpose and he was always moving towards
[1:03:59] that three-fold purpose that god would
[1:04:02] be manifested in christ and then christ
[1:04:05] will be manifested in a people and he's
[1:04:07] always moving towards that plan he's
[1:04:10] always moving towards a purpose he's
[1:04:12] he's not aimless as we said
[1:04:15] figuring this out he wrote the script
[1:04:17] before the story started
[1:04:22] he wrote the movie before it ever you
[1:04:24] ever push play and start watching it
[1:04:26] he's already written and dramatized and
[1:04:29] played it all out in his mind
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:33] this is just a rehearsal this brother
[1:04:35] digs
[1:04:38] that's what it is
[1:04:40] and and and this is the plan that god we
[1:04:43] call it the revelation of god in first
[1:04:45] corinthians chapter two it's called the
[1:04:47] hidden
[1:04:48] wisdom
[1:04:49] you remember the scripture he says we
[1:04:51] speak of god in a mystery even the
[1:04:54] hidden wisdom of god
[1:04:56] and he says and if the princes of the
[1:04:58] world had known it they wouldn't have
[1:05:01] crucified the lord of the prince of
[1:05:03] glory the lord of glory but as as it is
[1:05:06] written eye hath not seen
[1:05:08] nor ear heard neither have it entered
[1:05:11] into the heart of man the things which
[1:05:13] god hath prepared
[1:05:17] for them that love him
[1:05:19] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[1:05:22] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:05:24] things yea
[1:05:26] the deep things of god so within this
[1:05:29] hidden wisdom
[1:05:31] was the mystery of christ revealed
[1:05:34] within this his wisdom was the mystery
[1:05:36] of redemption
[1:05:38] which includes why he allowed the fall
[1:05:41] it includes why he allowed sin and
[1:05:44] sickness and disease
[1:05:45] and paul says had they understood that
[1:05:48] it was a plan
[1:05:49] then they wouldn't have crucified the
[1:05:51] lord of glory but god had hidden this
[1:05:54] this revelation from the mind of satan
[1:05:56] remember satan does not know everything
[1:06:01] amen he only knows what the lord allows
[1:06:05] him to know brother branham even said
[1:06:07] god's prophets don't know everything
[1:06:10] they only know what the lord would allow
[1:06:12] them to know
[1:06:14] and so satan doesn't understand
[1:06:16] everything so satan is as we said uh the
[1:06:19] the the
[1:06:20] satan follows prophets
[1:06:23] satan follows the manifestation of the
[1:06:25] word right amen
[1:06:28] so here's what god says now mannis
[1:06:30] became separated from god and god tells
[1:06:33] moses i want you to build me a
[1:06:36] tabernacle
[1:06:38] that i may dwell among them i want you
[1:06:40] to look in the first slide there as
[1:06:42] moses gets this vision from the lord and
[1:06:46] that moses god tells them god doesn't
[1:06:49] just tell moses hey moses i want you to
[1:06:51] build me a house and i i want you to
[1:06:54] build me a tabernacle and uh you know
[1:06:56] moses i i want it to be nice
[1:06:58] you know you know i want it to be i
[1:07:00] don't know
[1:07:01] you know i think i make it large moses
[1:07:04] you know i'm a big god and so you know
[1:07:07] make it make it beautiful moses i you
[1:07:10] know i dwell in beauty and you know just
[1:07:12] make sure it looks nice you got that
[1:07:14] first slide brother josh if you could
[1:07:16] display that
[1:07:17] uh he says make it look nice you know i
[1:07:20] i want you to you know moses i don't
[1:07:22] know make it make it holy
[1:07:24] because i'm holy
[1:07:26] and however you want to interpret what's
[1:07:28] holy you know moses just whatever you
[1:07:30] think i mean
[1:07:31] you know i trust you moses you're my
[1:07:33] prophet you know make it holy and make
[1:07:36] it pure because i'm pure and and well
[1:07:39] how big should it be well you know moses
[1:07:41] i don't we're however whatever you think
[1:07:42] you know
[1:07:43] god doesn't ask moses to build a house
[1:07:47] for him based upon moses ideas or his
[1:07:51] thoughts
[1:07:52] remember a prophet of god has no thought
[1:07:55] of his own
[1:07:58] he's a eunuch he has no seed of his own
[1:08:01] he has no thought of his own he's he's
[1:08:03] an interpreter he's a communicator of
[1:08:06] the divine thoughts of god he's a
[1:08:08] conduit he's a channel that speaks his
[1:08:11] voice becomes the voice
[1:08:14] of god
[1:08:15] i know we've said it many times and i'll
[1:08:17] say it again that means that when you
[1:08:19] reject the voice of isaiah you were not
[1:08:22] rejecting isaiah you were rejecting
[1:08:24] jehovah
[1:08:25] when you questioned the word of jeremiah
[1:08:28] and you blasphemed the word of jeremiah
[1:08:30] you were not blaspheming jeremiah you
[1:08:32] were blaspheming jehovah
[1:08:36] and so god says moses i want you to
[1:08:38] build a house and and i want you and he
[1:08:41] says i want you to not deviate so god
[1:08:43] shows him a vision and he says i want
[1:08:45] you to build it exactly as i've shown
[1:08:47] you
[1:08:48] don't deviate from it at all moses
[1:08:51] because this earthly house is going to
[1:08:54] be a representation of my purpose and my
[1:08:58] home
[1:08:59] in heaven
[1:09:02] and so he builds this first and there's
[1:09:04] many facets to this tabernacle the
[1:09:06] colors are specific
[1:09:09] the curtains are specific the size is
[1:09:13] specific the height is specific the type
[1:09:17] of stones that he's going to use are
[1:09:20] very
[1:09:21] specific
[1:09:22] let me say it this way
[1:09:24] god
[1:09:25] is
[1:09:26] specific
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:29] hello
[1:09:31] god is not generic
[1:09:35] what he desires and what he wants and
[1:09:37] what makes him happy is very specific
[1:09:40] and what displeases him is very specific
[1:09:43] hello
[1:09:44] amen he tells us sir moses built it
[1:09:46] exactly
[1:09:48] as you've seen it
[1:09:50] you know engineered prince brother steve
[1:09:52] they're detailed they have details all
[1:09:54] over them when you go to bed a job
[1:09:56] you're you're looking at the engineered
[1:09:58] prince to make sure you don't miss a
[1:10:00] note you don't miss a detail but you you
[1:10:03] don't miss anything in the in the in the
[1:10:04] drawing you don't just make it up but
[1:10:06] you have a guideline that you're to
[1:10:08] follow and you're to follow it precisely
[1:10:11] to the teeth
[1:10:12] do you know why you're supposed to
[1:10:14] follow the engineer so that if anything
[1:10:18] goes wrong
[1:10:19] with the building
[1:10:21] you're not the one to blame
[1:10:25] but there's a man who has now put his
[1:10:27] stamp of approval oh hallelujah i hope
[1:10:30] you catch it here tonight there's a man
[1:10:32] who's now put his name and he's bonded
[1:10:34] his name and given an assurity that if
[1:10:37] this building fails you can blame the
[1:10:39] engineer oh and when god gave us the
[1:10:42] word it wasn't generic it was very
[1:10:44] specific and he put his own stamp on the
[1:10:47] word and said if you just build your
[1:10:49] house according to this
[1:10:52] then i'll take responsibility to whether
[1:10:54] it fails or succeeds
[1:11:00] and so he says build it exactly as i've
[1:11:02] seen it moses don't deviate from it
[1:11:06] it's going to be a house
[1:11:08] it's going to be a tabernacle
[1:11:10] and he says now notice here as we said
[1:11:13] god never moves backwards he always
[1:11:15] moves forwards this is god taking a step
[1:11:19] towards his ultimate vision
[1:11:22] it's god moving forward towards his
[1:11:24] ultimate plan his ultimate vision
[1:11:27] and he takes a step forward and he says
[1:11:29] i'll commune with thee
[1:11:31] from above the mercy seat
[1:11:34] i'll commune with thee from above
[1:11:37] so now communion has been restored
[1:11:40] now fellowship has been restored and god
[1:11:44] has got god says moses i want you to
[1:11:46] build it exactly as i've told you
[1:11:48] because this is going to serve a purpose
[1:11:50] it's moving towards something
[1:11:53] all the time god is changing god is
[1:11:56] moving
[1:11:57] god is developing
[1:11:59] god is building
[1:12:01] god is god is taking his plan and his
[1:12:04] program and he's implementing it exactly
[1:12:08] as he's drawn it out amen
[1:12:12] i'll commune with thee from above
[1:12:15] the mercy seat
[1:12:16] and you see this tabernacle
[1:12:18] and you see the outer cord and i love
[1:12:20] this picture
[1:12:21] all of the tribes of israel camped
[1:12:23] around but now in the middle of this
[1:12:25] place you have this dwelling place outer
[1:12:27] court inner court the holiest of holies
[1:12:29] and you see that great
[1:12:31] fire that pillar of fire that comes down
[1:12:35] inside of that holiest of holies and it
[1:12:37] fills the holiest of holies
[1:12:40] and in there you have the man and in
[1:12:42] there you have aaron's rod that buds
[1:12:44] under that presence of life
[1:12:47] what you have confined i want you to
[1:12:50] catch this
[1:12:51] what you have confined inside of the
[1:12:54] holiest of holies
[1:12:56] is the pillar of fire or the presence of
[1:12:58] god that permeated eden now is bottled
[1:13:02] up in one little room
[1:13:06] so what does that mean brother matt it
[1:13:08] meant all of the curtains and all of the
[1:13:10] diamonds and the barrel and the onyx and
[1:13:12] the sapphire and the carbuncle and all
[1:13:14] of the all of the beautiful gold and all
[1:13:16] of the curtains and all of the linen and
[1:13:18] everything that moses had did would have
[1:13:20] been for absolutely nothing right amen
[1:13:24] had god not tabernacled and put his
[1:13:27] approval
[1:13:28] by his presence coming down and filling
[1:13:30] that holiest place
[1:13:34] so god moves and takes another step
[1:13:36] we notice this here even then david's
[1:13:39] desires to build a house for god
[1:13:41] and solomon his son builds him a temple
[1:13:45] for the lord and i know we've shown
[1:13:46] these before i just want you to advance
[1:13:48] the sign it's a very great grand temple
[1:13:52] very similar to moses's tabernacle very
[1:13:55] similar
[1:13:57] but what is it
[1:13:58] it's a greater temple
[1:14:00] or a greater tabernacle or a greater
[1:14:03] expression of his plan than moses's
[1:14:05] tabernacle amen
[1:14:08] it's not greater in the sense of
[1:14:10] grandeur necessarily but it's greater
[1:14:12] because it moves closer and it furthers
[1:14:15] the plan that god had from the beginning
[1:14:19] so david solomon builds this tabernacle
[1:14:22] and we don't want to take the time to
[1:14:23] read it but he's moving towards
[1:14:26] something now remember
[1:14:28] solomon's tabernacle was great it was
[1:14:30] granulous it was beautiful to look upon
[1:14:33] but it was not
[1:14:36] the perfect fulfillment of god's plan it
[1:14:39] was only a step towards it
[1:14:43] hello you following
[1:14:45] it was only a step towards it it was
[1:14:49] only a signpost
[1:14:51] thank god for the signpost
[1:14:54] thank god for the for the signs but it
[1:14:56] wasn't the ultimate purpose that god had
[1:14:59] it was moving towards something
[1:15:02] it was moving towards a vision it was
[1:15:04] moving towards his purpose and every
[1:15:06] time god would bring a temple from moses
[1:15:09] to solomon and do away with the old the
[1:15:13] latter temple was always greater than
[1:15:17] the former amen
[1:15:20] remember the scripture that we read
[1:15:22] jesus is standing there
[1:15:24] and he says behold i say unto you
[1:15:26] there's one standing among you now
[1:15:29] that's greater than the temple
[1:15:33] so it's a greater in that it's not
[1:15:35] greater that it's larger it's not
[1:15:38] greater that it has more color or has
[1:15:40] more uh you know uh glitter or it glows
[1:15:43] better or it looks better it's not
[1:15:45] necessarily that at all
[1:15:46] but it's greater in that it's a greater
[1:15:49] progression
[1:15:50] the ladder the former the latter shall
[1:15:54] always be greater than the former
[1:15:57] and anytime god moves towards something
[1:16:00] it's always a greater expression
[1:16:03] of what's close closest
[1:16:05] to his heart
[1:16:07] he doesn't go backwards
[1:16:10] he doesn't even have the gear of reverse
[1:16:14] he can only go forward
[1:16:18] oh we could we could preach on that for
[1:16:19] the rest of the service here tonight
[1:16:21] we're thankful amen for all that god's
[1:16:23] sins
[1:16:24] uh let me say this to you there's
[1:16:26] there's great signs uh that we could
[1:16:28] even see right now you know we're on a
[1:16:31] progression we're on a journey you see
[1:16:33] brother matt where are we going back to
[1:16:34] are we going back to solomon's temple no
[1:16:36] we're going we're going before solomon's
[1:16:38] temple are we going back to moses's
[1:16:40] tabernacle no you got to go before that
[1:16:43] we're going all the way back to an eden
[1:16:45] condition where there's perfection and
[1:16:48] the air we breathe is the breath of the
[1:16:50] almighty god
[1:16:53] we're a people who's on our way back to
[1:16:55] it
[1:16:56] oh and let me say there's been great
[1:16:58] things god has sinned he sent us a
[1:17:00] prophet we're thankful for a prophet
[1:17:02] send us a message we're thankful for a
[1:17:04] message he sends signs and those signs
[1:17:07] are a signpost
[1:17:09] that we're getting closer
[1:17:11] we're getting closer but let me say this
[1:17:14] the sign is never the land the sign is
[1:17:17] never the destination
[1:17:19] it's only a sign pointing to the
[1:17:21] destination amen are you with me here
[1:17:23] tonight
[1:17:24] the sign always points us to the city
[1:17:27] but the sign is never the city
[1:17:31] amen amen amen amen
[1:17:34] we we watch things here the sign of
[1:17:37] sodom and we see the signs of luke 17 30
[1:17:40] as it was in the days of of of lot and
[1:17:42] we see that fulfilled we've seen it
[1:17:44] fulfilled literally before our very eyes
[1:17:46] what is it brother matt it's a signpost
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:50] it's a sign that's pointing towards
[1:17:52] something
[1:17:53] uh we see that the church is blind we
[1:17:55] see to russia you say what is russia
[1:17:58] russia's russia is not this listen this
[1:18:00] is in the fulfillment this isn't the
[1:18:02] finality it's just a sign pointing
[1:18:04] towards something that's why brother
[1:18:06] branham says watch russia
[1:18:09] we don't live our lives obsessed with
[1:18:11] russia we obsess ourselves on the
[1:18:13] promises of god's word
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:17] you say brother matt what is russia it's
[1:18:18] something i'm watching
[1:18:20] but my focus is right here
[1:18:22] [Applause]
[1:18:24] as part as the bible says abraham was
[1:18:26] salt he sees he was seeking a city whose
[1:18:30] builder and maker was god oh what is it
[1:18:33] even even the bride is a sign it's
[1:18:36] pointing towards something
[1:18:38] in fact the bride was the last of the
[1:18:41] word made flesh and a people would be
[1:18:43] the last sign post
[1:18:46] before we go to that land
[1:18:50] so the bride herself is a sign brother
[1:18:52] branham says in the identification of
[1:18:54] christ of in all ages it's god
[1:18:57] manifested in flesh now in the flesh of
[1:19:00] his bride
[1:19:01] for the bride and the husband is the
[1:19:03] self-same flesh these two are one
[1:19:07] and the church is becoming the bride all
[1:19:10] the time by believing the word amen
[1:19:15] so that the word in the church becomes
[1:19:18] the same
[1:19:19] the word in the church making it the
[1:19:21] bride the last sign god identify himself
[1:19:23] the word in the church
[1:19:27] so god was moving towards something even
[1:19:30] in solomon's temple he was moving
[1:19:32] towards a purpose
[1:19:34] and it's greater than moses tabernacle
[1:19:37] it's greater than what moses had built
[1:19:39] it's god taking another step yet
[1:19:43] solomon's tabernacle was not his goal
[1:19:48] but he's taken another step to his
[1:19:50] vision
[1:19:51] and every time god would bring and do
[1:19:53] away with we said the latter the later
[1:19:56] the next would always be greater than
[1:19:59] the previous
[1:20:01] let me just say this god as we said has
[1:20:04] no gear of reverse and no gear of
[1:20:07] neutral and if you want to stay with god
[1:20:09] you've got to progress when god moves
[1:20:14] and if you don't progress when god moves
[1:20:16] you're stuck
[1:20:18] left behind
[1:20:20] we got to progress i'll say lord i want
[1:20:22] to move on
[1:20:23] i want to move when you move do we have
[1:20:25] a church that feels that way say lord i
[1:20:27] want to progress when you progress i
[1:20:29] want to stay with the vision i want to
[1:20:31] stay with the lightest he is in the
[1:20:32] light i want to move with the light
[1:20:36] and so solomon's solomon praised this
[1:20:39] prayer in 2nd chronicles 6 you don't
[1:20:40] have to turn he prays this entire prayer
[1:20:43] and he and he says lord i've done
[1:20:44] everything according to how you've
[1:20:46] showed me i've not deviated from
[1:20:48] anything and he says now lord would you
[1:20:50] come and fill the house
[1:20:53] and the bible says that when solomon
[1:20:55] finishes praying
[1:20:57] that a great pillar of fire comes and a
[1:21:00] presence comes upon all of the priests
[1:21:02] and all the all of the ministers
[1:21:04] and the presence of god fills that
[1:21:07] tabernacle amen the same way he filled
[1:21:10] moses now he's filling solomon's giving
[1:21:13] his approval
[1:21:15] go to the next line if you could brother
[1:21:18] josh
[1:21:20] so just like he showed up in the
[1:21:22] tabernacle of moses
[1:21:24] it's the same pillar of fire that fills
[1:21:28] solomon's house this is a great
[1:21:31] picture a depiction of solomon's
[1:21:33] tabernacle it was beautiful it was grand
[1:21:35] just but let me just say this to you
[1:21:37] friends
[1:21:38] what made it glorious
[1:21:41] was it the lights
[1:21:43] was it the beauty was it the silver was
[1:21:45] it the diamonds was it the gold that's
[1:21:47] not what gave it the beauty
[1:21:49] god says man looks at the outward parts
[1:21:52] but i look at the inward parts the glory
[1:21:56] and the of the tabernacle was not the
[1:21:59] lights or the outward grange or the
[1:22:01] outward beauty or what you might think
[1:22:03] is success
[1:22:04] but the beauty laid within the person
[1:22:07] and the presence of that person coming
[1:22:09] and filling the tabernacle
[1:22:17] so now we know the story that after
[1:22:20] solomon's temple we know the jews
[1:22:22] backslide
[1:22:23] and god warns them through prophets
[1:22:25] amos comes and hosea comes and micah
[1:22:29] comes and isaiah nahum zephaniah
[1:22:32] habakkuk and jeremiah these are prophets
[1:22:35] warning them
[1:22:36] warning every time it seemed that god
[1:22:39] would bless them they'd backslide
[1:22:41] further
[1:22:42] and the more blessings the more carnal
[1:22:44] they became
[1:22:46] we know the story not to get into it but
[1:22:48] we know that they come and finally uh
[1:22:51] god
[1:22:52] there's a there's a point to where they
[1:22:54] cross a line and god sends a an evil
[1:22:58] nation and they come and deport all of
[1:23:00] the jews out of the kingdom
[1:23:03] they take them into babylonian captivity
[1:23:05] and now there's the northern tribes and
[1:23:07] the southern tribes and and they're
[1:23:09] they're they're there in babylon and
[1:23:10] then babylon's conquered by the persians
[1:23:13] just how daniel prophesied in this
[1:23:15] vision of that great giant statue that
[1:23:17] god would that gold that golden
[1:23:19] nebuchadnezzar kingdom would be replaced
[1:23:22] by the silver which was cyrus and now
[1:23:25] cyrus makes a decree and he gives a
[1:23:28] promise
[1:23:29] and he gives he gives a special
[1:23:31] opportunity to all of the deportees now
[1:23:33] remember it's not just jews
[1:23:36] who's in babylon but through
[1:23:38] nebuchadnezzar he had conquered nation
[1:23:40] after nation after nation and had taken
[1:23:42] captive
[1:23:44] nations from all over the world
[1:23:46] and so nebuchadnezzar makes this promise
[1:23:49] and cyrus makes this decree and says
[1:23:52] listen i'm going to let all of the
[1:23:53] illegals
[1:23:55] all of the aliens all of those who were
[1:23:57] deported all those who aren't from here
[1:23:59] i'm going to give you the chance to go
[1:24:01] free
[1:24:03] i'm going to allow you to leave here and
[1:24:06] return to your homeland
[1:24:08] and he says under one stipulation
[1:24:11] that when you go back to your home you
[1:24:15] rebuild your temple and when you rebuild
[1:24:17] that temple you make a sacrifice and
[1:24:19] pray for me
[1:24:23] pretty good idea right
[1:24:25] pretty smart guy
[1:24:26] tells all of the countries all of the
[1:24:28] nations all of the religions all of the
[1:24:30] people listen you're going to get to go
[1:24:32] free i have one stipulation go home
[1:24:35] build a tabernacle build a temple
[1:24:37] rebuild your temple and then make a
[1:24:39] sacrifice and when you make that
[1:24:40] sacrifice ask god to bless me you know
[1:24:42] what he sort of figured like you put
[1:24:43] enough shells in the in the gun
[1:24:45] eventually one would fire
[1:24:49] surely one of them's a real god surely
[1:24:51] one of the gods will answer my prayer
[1:24:52] pretty smart guy you know what they did
[1:24:54] they did it
[1:24:55] and now we know the story that they go
[1:24:57] back
[1:24:58] under ezra and nehemiah and joshua the
[1:25:02] high priest and they go back and they
[1:25:04] rebuild this temple and they start the
[1:25:07] work of rebuilding this tabernacle if
[1:25:09] you go to the next slide
[1:25:11] now now this is af this is afterwards
[1:25:13] but they rebuild this temple i want you
[1:25:15] to turn the haggy eye if you could haggy
[1:25:18] eye chapter 2 uh quickly in your bible
[1:25:21] and that you could keep this up so that
[1:25:23] they can turn in their in in the
[1:25:25] scripture
[1:25:27] they rebuild this tabernacle in this
[1:25:29] temple
[1:25:30] and this great move of ezra starts and
[1:25:33] nehemiah starts and they begin to
[1:25:35] rebuild the start of the work of the
[1:25:38] temple but you know what happens when
[1:25:40] they go back
[1:25:42] they go back and they leave babylon a
[1:25:44] place where they're increased where
[1:25:45] they're blessed where they have homes
[1:25:46] where they have people where they have
[1:25:48] lands
[1:25:49] and they go back to utter destruction
[1:25:52] and ruin there's been years that have
[1:25:56] elapsed you imagine
[1:25:58] years have went by since they dwelled
[1:26:01] there
[1:26:02] now
[1:26:02] you have all of the destruction
[1:26:05] all of the ruins where nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:07] had sacked the temple and destroyed the
[1:26:10] walls of jerusalem and they go back
[1:26:12] under all this revival and they go back
[1:26:14] under all this exuberant oh we're going
[1:26:15] to go we're going to go back we're going
[1:26:17] to rebuild
[1:26:18] you know sort of
[1:26:19] all that excitement from revival and
[1:26:21] excited for meetings and oh i'm going to
[1:26:23] get everything right i'm going to turn
[1:26:25] my life around i can hear that i feel
[1:26:27] the atmosphere of the preaching of the
[1:26:28] word you get all the other young people
[1:26:30] here and everyone's all happy and
[1:26:32] shouting on i'm going to make great
[1:26:34] changes and god's going to get a hold of
[1:26:36] me then you go back to reality on monday
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:41] and you come to jerusalem and you go
[1:26:43] whoa
[1:26:45] this is overwhelming
[1:26:47] there is no where are we going to wait
[1:26:49] do we even consider where are we gonna
[1:26:51] live there are no houses
[1:26:53] where we where are we gonna dwell i
[1:26:54] don't
[1:26:55] i mean i'm all for rebuilding the temple
[1:26:58] but
[1:26:58] ezra what were we thinking we had homes
[1:27:01] in babylon we had houses we had a roof
[1:27:03] over our head you know what happens
[1:27:06] the condition of the ruin and
[1:27:08] destruction overwhelmed them
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:13] you know one of the hardest works you
[1:27:14] can do the one of the hardest
[1:27:17] things you can do is to take something
[1:27:19] that is tattered
[1:27:21] and destroyed
[1:27:23] and rebuild it
[1:27:25] restoration is one of the hardest tasks
[1:27:29] you can do in building because you're
[1:27:32] starting
[1:27:34] not from scratch
[1:27:36] it's one thing to start from scratch
[1:27:38] you're starting from ruin
[1:27:40] and ruin can be discouraging
[1:27:44] ruin can be so discouraging
[1:27:47] let me just say this to you here today
[1:27:49] one of the hardest works that you'll
[1:27:51] ever do in your life
[1:27:52] is to take things that you've allowed in
[1:27:55] your life whether it was through sin or
[1:27:57] through a stage of backsliding or
[1:27:59] through a stage of infervency to the
[1:28:01] lord one of the hardest works you can be
[1:28:03] exuberated you can come under revival
[1:28:06] you can feel anointed but actually
[1:28:08] picking up the tools and starting to
[1:28:10] labor towards building one of the
[1:28:12] hardest struggles you'll ever have is to
[1:28:16] come back and to rebuild from a place
[1:28:18] you used to live
[1:28:21] amen
[1:28:22] and the struggles amongst them the
[1:28:25] struggles with them were so great when
[1:28:28] they're trying to rebuild and all there
[1:28:31] is is rubble
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] and all there is is chaos and it's
[1:28:36] destruction and there's vines growing
[1:28:39] over it and there's thorns growing you
[1:28:41] could sort of see what used to be in the
[1:28:43] life that used to be there and you know
[1:28:46] most people would just go you know what
[1:28:48] ah i just i think uh nah not not for me
[1:28:53] i mean it sounded good guys but this is
[1:28:56] just overwhelming and that's exactly
[1:28:58] what happened to him
[1:29:00] and after just a very short work after a
[1:29:02] very short time of rebuilding they all
[1:29:05] just throw their hammers down
[1:29:07] throw their shovels down and go you know
[1:29:08] what we're going back to babylon
[1:29:12] and complete discouragement sets in
[1:29:16] discouragement sets in in their heart
[1:29:18] because it's overwhelming to them to
[1:29:20] think
[1:29:22] it's overwhelming for them to think what
[1:29:24] used to be
[1:29:25] and it's and not not only is the
[1:29:28] struggle of of seeing what used to be
[1:29:30] there
[1:29:31] but the samaritans are there and they
[1:29:33] hate the jews and they don't want them
[1:29:35] back there and the bible records how
[1:29:38] they antagonize them and every other
[1:29:40] kind of read about sennacherib and all
[1:29:42] the different things that was the king
[1:29:44] the man's name that comes to discourage
[1:29:46] them while they're up on the wall trying
[1:29:48] to rebuild they're on the ground just
[1:29:50] mocking omen and you know and just doing
[1:29:53] everything they can to try to destroy
[1:29:55] the atmosphere and to try to destroy the
[1:29:58] spirit of rebuilding friends let me just
[1:30:00] tell you there is nothing the devil will
[1:30:02] fight harder than when you get a heart
[1:30:05] to say lord i want to rebuild the
[1:30:07] tabernacle of god in my life i want to
[1:30:10] restore what has been lost she will
[1:30:12] never fight the devil harder
[1:30:16] amen
[1:30:18] there will never be more critics of
[1:30:20] people to try to discourage you and try
[1:30:23] to mock you and try to destroy the
[1:30:26] atmosphere whenever you go to rebuilding
[1:30:29] what satan has destroyed you can
[1:30:32] guarantee all hell will be there to try
[1:30:34] to stop you
[1:30:39] because the devil
[1:30:40] doesn't
[1:30:41] want
[1:30:43] your tabernacle your temple your place
[1:30:45] of worship your place of fervency your
[1:30:48] place of dedication whether you know why
[1:30:51] because he knows that with that temple
[1:30:53] comes the presence of god
[1:30:56] and with that temple comes the comes a
[1:30:58] man who fills that house
[1:31:00] and so he'll do everything he can to
[1:31:02] stop you from rebuilding your temple
[1:31:04] he'll do everything you can let you come
[1:31:06] to church but let your worship be in
[1:31:08] ruins and tatters and destroy satan
[1:31:10] doesn't mind he'll keep you there but
[1:31:12] put your hand to rebuilding and every
[1:31:15] devil in hell will try to discourage you
[1:31:18] and depress you and to overwhelm you you
[1:31:20] know what you've got to have in order to
[1:31:22] restore something you've got to have a
[1:31:25] vision of the completed project
[1:31:28] and when you can catch a vision not of
[1:31:30] the ruin and the destruction but you
[1:31:32] catch a vision of what it could be then
[1:31:35] you have the energy and the spirit and
[1:31:37] the anointing to say i'm not gonna look
[1:31:40] at circumstances i'm not gonna look at
[1:31:42] what i don't see i'm gonna keep my eyes
[1:31:45] on the vision he's laid before me and
[1:31:47] i'm gonna put my hand to working on this
[1:31:50] template amen
[1:31:52] amen
[1:31:55] he doesn't want it
[1:31:56] rebuilt he hates
[1:31:58] restoration he'll let you call yourself
[1:32:00] a christian a name only this is what
[1:32:02] brother branham said
[1:32:03] he doesn't care about that he don't care
[1:32:06] if you if you call yourself a message
[1:32:07] believer he isn't afraid of a title
[1:32:13] isn't afraid of that that doesn't move
[1:32:15] anything that doesn't move the devil
[1:32:17] when you call yourself a believer you
[1:32:18] come to church that doesn't scare him
[1:32:20] either right brother branham says and he
[1:32:22] speaks about a man he says but you take
[1:32:23] a person who in spite of all of the
[1:32:26] trial and all the persecution and all of
[1:32:28] the hatred that's being thrown at them
[1:32:30] he says they'll just humbly humbly bow
[1:32:33] themselves
[1:32:34] and stay true and sincere and pure
[1:32:36] before the lord
[1:32:38] brother branham says that's the thunder
[1:32:40] that shakes the devil's kingdom
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:46] he hates
[1:32:49] he hates it
[1:32:51] but if you go to rebuilding the temple
[1:32:54] the praise the worship and spirit and
[1:32:57] truth that's what the devil can't stand
[1:33:00] that's why the bible says when david
[1:33:02] seen the ark restored
[1:33:04] he danced before the lord the devil
[1:33:07] hates restoration but the holy spirit
[1:33:10] loves it the holy spirit and the angels
[1:33:12] of god are there to back you up in the
[1:33:15] midst when you can look beyond the
[1:33:17] discouragement and say i'm going to
[1:33:18] press on any ways satan
[1:33:21] he ain't afraid let me just say this to
[1:33:23] you today he ain't afraid of dead
[1:33:25] churches that call themselves message
[1:33:27] churches he ain't afraid of your dresses
[1:33:29] he ain't afraid of your skirt seeing
[1:33:31] afraid of your long hair ain't afraid
[1:33:33] because you don't wear shorts because
[1:33:34] you don't cuss because you don't drink
[1:33:36] because you don't smoke he ain't afraid
[1:33:38] of all of your history in the message
[1:33:40] but what he is afraid of is that
[1:33:42] shekinah glory coming down into the
[1:33:45] church
[1:33:46] into the tabernacle and to the temple
[1:33:49] because he knows where the presence of
[1:33:51] god is
[1:33:52] there's the king
[1:33:54] who's in the camp
[1:33:57] and that's what the devil fights against
[1:34:00] he isn't afraid of the rebuilding of the
[1:34:02] structure or the shell
[1:34:05] and we build a lot of shells
[1:34:07] we build a lot of looks and images and
[1:34:09] we play the part satan ain't afraid of
[1:34:12] that he's only afraid when that heart is
[1:34:14] really changed on the inside and the
[1:34:17] presence of god tabernacles and takes
[1:34:19] his dwelling
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:24] hagia comes to them and he says here in
[1:34:26] hagia too
[1:34:27] in the seventh month in the year if you
[1:34:29] could read it in your bible haggai
[1:34:30] chapter 2 20 day of the month came the
[1:34:32] word of the lord haggai prophet haggai
[1:34:34] saying speak not of zerubbabel the son
[1:34:36] of governor of judah unto joshua the son
[1:34:38] of joseph the high priest of the
[1:34:39] resident of the people saying who's the
[1:34:41] left who is left among you that saw this
[1:34:44] house in her first glory and how do you
[1:34:45] see it now is it not in your eyes in
[1:34:48] comparison of it as nothing could you
[1:34:51] imagine
[1:34:53] could you imagine you know what happens
[1:34:56] it's not as big as it was before brother
[1:34:59] matt
[1:35:02] it's not like it was in our day
[1:35:04] man if you could just hear about the
[1:35:06] camp meetings and revivals we used to
[1:35:08] have
[1:35:08] you know what happened is the older
[1:35:10] people started criticizing the new
[1:35:13] temple yeah
[1:35:15] imagine
[1:35:16] they started criticizing saying
[1:35:20] that ain't nothing why it's literally
[1:35:22] what haggai says is it as of you of
[1:35:24] nothing
[1:35:26] oh you know that you know what happens
[1:35:28] they fell to see the vision they failed
[1:35:30] to see the plan they felt to see the
[1:35:32] promise that the latter
[1:35:34] shall always be greater than the former
[1:35:37] amen
[1:35:39] and you could never forget this whenever
[1:35:41] god does a work in your life the work
[1:35:44] that he's doing right now is always
[1:35:47] greater than anything he's done in the
[1:35:49] past
[1:35:50] and you could always live so long trying
[1:35:53] to get back to something and you don't
[1:35:55] realize the work that god is doing in
[1:35:57] your heart right now is greater than
[1:36:00] anything he's ever done before
[1:36:03] and it may seem smaller and it may seem
[1:36:06] not as large and it may seem not as
[1:36:08] great and as grand but always remember
[1:36:10] that's why haggai says don't despise the
[1:36:13] day of small things
[1:36:15] don't despise what god is doing right
[1:36:17] now because whatever god's doing in
[1:36:19] operation in your life the latter will
[1:36:22] always be greater than the former amen
[1:36:28] is it as of you look at hagia chapter 2
[1:36:30] who's left among you that saw this house
[1:36:33] in her first glory and how do you see it
[1:36:35] now is it not in your eyes in comparison
[1:36:38] as of nothing
[1:36:39] and here's his message
[1:36:41] to all of those discouraged believers
[1:36:44] who have became overwhelmed by the ruin
[1:36:48] yet now be strong
[1:36:50] amen oh zerubbabel saith the lord and be
[1:36:53] strong o joshua son of joseph deck the
[1:36:56] high priest and be strong
[1:36:57] all you people of the land saith the
[1:37:00] lord and here's something very very very
[1:37:02] very simple
[1:37:04] and if you read it in your bible
[1:37:07] if you're not just listen i'm going to
[1:37:08] read it to you
[1:37:10] he says be strong
[1:37:12] all you people of the land saith the
[1:37:14] lord and
[1:37:18] work and
[1:37:21] work
[1:37:23] there's something so
[1:37:25] powerful
[1:37:27] when you in spite of all of your
[1:37:28] discouragement
[1:37:30] and in spite of all of your all of the
[1:37:32] all of the circumstances around you and
[1:37:34] you don't feel like it and you don't you
[1:37:37] have no motivation to do it
[1:37:39] but you in spite of all of that
[1:37:42] pick up your hammer
[1:37:45] and you start to work
[1:37:48] and you start to labor
[1:37:51] in spite of all the criticism and in
[1:37:53] spite of all of the mockery
[1:37:56] in spite of all of the lack of energy
[1:37:58] that you have
[1:38:00] yet you pick up that pickaxe
[1:38:02] and you say in spite of all of it i'm
[1:38:04] gonna go to work
[1:38:07] and he says haggai says to them be
[1:38:09] strong
[1:38:10] and work for i
[1:38:13] am with you saith the lord of hosts
[1:38:16] for i am with you saith the lord of
[1:38:22] hosts
[1:38:23] look at verse 9 the glory of this latter
[1:38:27] house
[1:38:28] shall be greater than of the former
[1:38:31] saith the lord of hosts
[1:38:33] and in this place will i give peace
[1:38:36] saith the lord
[1:38:38] of
[1:38:39] hosts
[1:38:41] he says in verse 14. then answered haggy
[1:38:44] i so is this people and so is this
[1:38:47] nation before me saith the lord and so
[1:38:49] is every work of their hand of that
[1:38:51] which they offer there is unclean and
[1:38:53] now i pray you consider from this day
[1:38:55] and upward from before stone was laid
[1:38:57] upon a stone in the temple of the lord
[1:38:59] listen what he says here now consider
[1:39:01] this verse 18 consider now from this day
[1:39:04] and upward consider now from this day
[1:39:07] and onward don't look behind you don't
[1:39:10] look in the past but focus on the work
[1:39:13] that you've got here before you
[1:39:15] oh my brother my sister let me just say

[1:42:18] focus on the vision
[1:42:21] consider this and
[1:42:24] from this day and upwards
[1:42:28] so for every moment you take in every
[1:42:31] step that you take and every time you
[1:42:33] have to pick up that hammer and you have
[1:42:34] to pick up that block and you've got to
[1:42:36] lay that block
[1:42:37] and you start to get discouraged
[1:42:40] because work's taken longer than what
[1:42:42] you wanted it to take
[1:42:44] you know restoration's a process
[1:42:48] takes time
[1:42:51] takes time
[1:42:53] takes constant continual steady
[1:42:59] effort

[1:43:06] doesn't happen overnight

[1:43:10] know what you got to do
[1:43:11] you got to keep that vision of that
[1:43:13] project completed always before you
[1:43:16] and every time you go to get discouraged
[1:43:19] by what you don't see and by the ruin
[1:43:21] around you
[1:43:22] just stop in your mo in that moment and
[1:43:25] look to the word of god use your
[1:43:27] spiritual eyes
[1:43:29] say brother man do i have spiritual do i
[1:43:31] have a spiritual life brother branham
[1:43:32] said that faith is the sixth sense
[1:43:36] you don't just look at what you hear and
[1:43:37] what you see but you enter into faith
[1:43:39] that sixth sense and anytime you get
[1:43:42] discouraged and you get discouraged so
[1:43:44] much that you can't pick up the hammer
[1:43:46] pick up the hammer
[1:43:48] and consider the promises of god
[1:43:50] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:43:53] prosper
[1:43:54] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[1:43:56] where the righteous in times of trouble
[1:43:58] run into and are saved and i'm going to
[1:44:01] keep banging i'm going to keep working
[1:44:03] i'm going to keep hammering win brother
[1:44:05] man i'm going to keep the vision before
[1:44:06] me i'm going to look onward and upward
[1:44:09] not in my circumstances i'm going to
[1:44:11] look at what god said and i'm going to
[1:44:13] say that's the word of god and that's
[1:44:15] the only truth that i need to focus on
[1:44:18] i'm going to cast down all other
[1:44:19] imaginations
[1:44:22] what about the random call them blind
[1:44:24] vanities
[1:44:27] he says do you not see
[1:44:30] do you do you not see that the he says
[1:44:33] all of you that are looking upon this
[1:44:35] house right now he says the latter
[1:44:38] the later what i'm doing right now
[1:44:42] what i'm doing right now
[1:44:44] shall be greater than anything i've ever
[1:44:47] done before
[1:44:50] and he moves from there i love this so
[1:44:52] much
[1:44:54] he moves from that temple god's not done
[1:44:56] yet
[1:44:57] and they build another temple events
[1:44:59] that form me brother josh it moves it
[1:45:01] builds another temple you see the temple
[1:45:02] in the heritage day i know we've shown
[1:45:04] this before but it was too good just not
[1:45:05] to continue he show he builds the temple
[1:45:08] what are they always moving towards
[1:45:10] always moving towards the plan
[1:45:12] always moving towards the vision the
[1:45:14] latter shall be greater than the former
[1:45:17] not greater and grander not greater in
[1:45:19] statute
[1:45:20] but it actually might get smaller
[1:45:23] might get less granulous
[1:45:26] but it's going to be greater
[1:45:28] because it's a further fulfillment
[1:45:31] it's something further that i'm doing
[1:45:36] and so he moves from moses to solomon
[1:45:40] haggai that building under under
[1:45:42] zerubbabel build this temple under herod
[1:45:45] and now god
[1:45:46] go to the next slide brother josh takes
[1:45:49] his next temple

[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:52] and he says behold i say unto you
[1:45:54] there's one standing among you now
[1:45:57] that's greater than the temple
[1:46:00] hold on a minute wait what's happened
[1:46:02] god has taken another step
[1:46:05] towards his plan
[1:46:07] and it's
[1:46:08] the bible says it this way
[1:46:10] there was no beauty that we should
[1:46:12] desire right
[1:46:13] yeah
[1:46:15] there was no outward glitter or glamour
[1:46:18] sparkle that's why they missed it
[1:46:20] brother adam says god hides himself in
[1:46:22] simplicity you know who missed this all
[1:46:25] of the religious world completely missed
[1:46:28] it yeah amen
[1:46:31] because they're so focused on the la on
[1:46:33] the farmer that they miss what god's
[1:46:35] doing what brother adam say they're
[1:46:37] always thanking him for what he did
[1:46:38] always thanking him for what he's going
[1:46:40] to do but missing and failing to see
[1:46:42] what he's doing right now hallelujah
[1:46:47] he's moving towards something

[1:50:14] these other things but by simple holy
[1:50:17] unadulterated faith in the son of god
[1:50:20] and what he said in his word he's
[1:50:22] painting a picture
[1:50:23] he's painting a picture what is it a
[1:50:26] holy ghost filled church that he
[1:50:28] foreordained
[1:50:30] before the beginning of the world to
[1:50:32] appear yonder in his glory
[1:50:35] keep going
[1:50:36] he says that appeared yonder is that all
[1:50:38] brother josh that's wonderful he says to
[1:50:40] bear holy ghost filled church city for a
[1:50:42] day and before the beginning of the
[1:50:43] world to appear yonder in glory amen
[1:50:48] what was it he was moving taking a step
[1:50:51] towards his plan
[1:50:53] and he would take that vessel that was
[1:50:55] all of the fullness
[1:50:56] of god dwelled
[1:50:58] you think of that in christ dwelt the
[1:51:01] fullness of the godhead in a body
[1:51:05] all of the gifts
[1:51:06] all of the talents everything david was
[1:51:09] everything daniel was
[1:51:11] everything solomon was everything
[1:51:13] shadrach meshach and abednego everything
[1:51:15] all of the prophets were everything
[1:51:18] samson was everything shamgar had
[1:51:21] all of the power all of the gifts of the
[1:51:24] spirit all of the manifestations of the
[1:51:27] spirit dwelled in one human temple in
[1:51:31] one human
[1:51:32] tabernacle amen
[1:51:36] and god said i'm going to take
[1:51:37] everything that was inside of him and
[1:51:40] i'm going to like a like like like a
[1:51:42] because that's exactly what the
[1:51:43] scripture says he that believeth on me
[1:51:45] shall out of his belly flow rivers of
[1:51:47] living water
[1:51:49] and he says but he spoke john 7 he spoke
[1:51:52] of the spirit which had not yet been
[1:51:54] sent the holy ghost which had not yet
[1:51:56] been given he had not yet ascended but
[1:51:58] what was god's plan ultimately was it to
[1:52:01] bottle all of the presence of god in a
[1:52:04] man named christ jesus so that we could
[1:52:06] forever exalt and and speak of his
[1:52:08] crucifixion and speak of his miracles
[1:52:11] and speak of jesus of now oh i'm still
[1:52:13] testifying about jesus of nazareth he
[1:52:15] still means something to me i'm still
[1:52:17] testifying and preaching about his cross
[1:52:20] preaching about his resurrection but i'm
[1:52:21] not forgetting that his plan didn't stop
[1:52:25] with the man christ jesus
[1:52:27] but the christ is the mystery of god
[1:52:29] revealed would be a threefold purpose
[1:52:32] that he would then take the preeminence
[1:52:34] that he had in christ and he would get
[1:52:36] the preeminence
[1:52:38] and a many-membered body
[1:52:40] as he would take his spirit and he would
[1:52:42] pour it into a church
[1:52:46] and all of the great ocean and the great
[1:52:48] vastness of the spirit of god you
[1:52:50] imagine the spirit of god like a great
[1:52:52] ocean brother man says you bottle up and
[1:52:55] he says if you take that great ocean he
[1:52:56] says how could i ever get everything
[1:52:58] that was in that ocean he says but if i
[1:53:00] take a cup and i just dip my cup he says
[1:53:03] everything in that ocean everything that
[1:53:05] that ocean is made up is now in that cup
[1:53:08] amen
[1:53:09] you say how do i get all of god in me
[1:53:12] you take an empty vessel
[1:53:15] you empty out yourself
[1:53:17] and you say god fill me with your
[1:53:20] spirit yes
[1:53:22] he was without measure but now there's a
[1:53:24] mini-membered body
[1:53:27] and brother branham said it would be the
[1:53:28] fullness of christ in a mini-membered
[1:53:32] body
[1:53:33] that that spirit would so dwell and
[1:53:35] engulf a human being that god would get
[1:53:38] the total preeminence out of that vessel
[1:53:41] that that spirit would be so upon the
[1:53:44] believer that they would be the final
[1:53:46] voice to a final age
[1:53:50] that it wouldn't be their thoughts
[1:53:52] right say lord i don't need any of my
[1:53:54] thoughts
[1:53:55] how many want to say that here today
[1:53:56] empty me of all of my thoughts and all
[1:53:58] of myself and all of my opinions
[1:54:04] and once i'm empty lord don't keep me
[1:54:06] there but now fill me with the mind of
[1:54:08] christ
[1:54:11] with the intelligence brother branham
[1:54:12] says what was that headstone that comes
[1:54:14] to the body it was the intelligence the
[1:54:17] mind of christ
[1:54:21] or you don't think your own thoughts
[1:54:24] we've had enough let me just say it this
[1:54:26] way i have had enough of my own thoughts
[1:54:30] i've had enough of my own reactions
[1:54:32] i say lord give me your thoughts
[1:54:34] i've had enough of my own temperament
[1:54:36] now i'm ready for the spirit of the
[1:54:37] temperament of jesus
[1:54:39] to live inside of my vessel
[1:54:42] could you stand to your feet with me
[1:54:44] musicians could you come
[1:54:46] well we got to page one
[1:54:51] no i'm just kidding come back sunday we
[1:54:53] got we got through a lot of it
[1:54:56] we only got through page one where we
[1:54:58] gonna be at on sunday
[1:55:00] page two
[1:55:02] you love the lord amen
[1:55:04] prophet of god says this i wanted to
[1:55:06] read this quote just as the if you could
[1:55:07] just play something for me brother tony
[1:55:09] if you could come
[1:55:14] the voice of the sign in 1964 says
[1:55:16] hallelujah
[1:55:17] they were only waiting for god but god
[1:55:20] was waiting on them
[1:55:22] he had his prophet out there in the
[1:55:24] wilderness but he was only waiting for
[1:55:26] the people to call him
[1:55:29] into action
[1:55:31] and i believe he has got the same thing
[1:55:34] today
[1:55:35] waiting for his church to call it on the
[1:55:38] scene so he can act
[1:55:40] the promise of today is ready
[1:55:44] but he's got to get the people to
[1:55:46] praying and groaning like they were down
[1:55:49] there
[1:55:50] then it'll come on the scene that's
[1:55:52] right
[1:55:53] you say why why does the condition of
[1:55:55] the world and the condition that it's in
[1:55:57] right now this isn't what we would have
[1:55:59] expected but we got trials we got
[1:56:01] hardships how many's got them as paul
[1:56:04] said we're pressed on every side without
[1:56:06] he says above measure
[1:56:08] say brother matt why does god get us
[1:56:10] into that condition and that place
[1:56:11] inside of even the place of ruin and we
[1:56:13] come to places in our life where we feel
[1:56:15] like it's just total destruction
[1:56:18] so that something inside of the true
[1:56:20] heart of the believer a real believer
[1:56:22] won't be content there
[1:56:24] but a real believer will begin to call
[1:56:25] upon the name of the lord
