[1:04] first john chapter 2.
[1:06] we'll just begin reading that verse
[1:08] we'll just start here
[1:10] verse 18. amen god bless you
[1:14] good to be here in sunday school this
[1:16] morning i'd like to speak and teach on
[1:19] the antichrist spirit at work that's my
[1:21] title for today the antichrist spirit
[1:24] at work little children
[1:28] it is the last time and as you have
[1:31] heard the antichrist spirit shall
[1:33] come even now
[1:36] are there many antichrists
[1:40] whereby we know that it is the last
[1:43] time first john 4 verse 1.
[1:46] just turn two chapters over there one
[1:48] more scripture
[1:50] beloved believe not every
[1:54] spirit now this is tied in in
[1:56] conjunction with the scripture we just
[1:58] read
[1:58] little children it's the last time
[2:00] you've heard the antichrist shall come
[2:02] but
[2:03] even now there are many antichrists
[2:07] now listen to his his word here in verse
[2:10] 1. beloved believe not every spirit
[2:13] but try the spirits whether they are of
[2:17] god
[2:18] because many false prophets are going
[2:21] out into the world
[2:23] hereby know you the spirit of god
[2:27] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[2:30] christ has
[2:31] come in the flesh is of god
[2:34] and every spirit that confesseth not
[2:38] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[2:40] is not of god
[2:42] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[2:47] whereof you have heard that it should
[2:49] come and
[2:50] even now already is in the world
[2:53] you can be seated we're going to have
[2:57] some quotes here
[2:58] we'll save just for a moment
[3:02] we read just two scriptures but if you
[3:05] go through your bible
[3:07] and you study your bible you'll see a
[3:09] character in the bible who
[3:11] emerges uh constantly
[3:14] and he's called by different names but
[3:17] it's referring to the same
[3:19] individual and it's a person and we
[3:22] speak of a spirit that's what we're
[3:23] teaching on this morning but we first
[3:25] want to identify
[3:27] the person of that spirit so
[3:30] he's called in one place the son of the
[3:32] morning another the son of perdition
[3:35] another the prince of darkness and
[3:38] another the man of
[3:39] sin these are what he's this some of the
[3:42] titles that he's
[3:44] uh referred to and the book of
[3:46] revelation especially
[3:48] covers and speaks a lot about this
[3:50] individual
[3:51] and he's uh mystified in a lot of
[3:53] people's minds and there's been a lot of
[3:56] uh movies made about him and a lot of
[3:59] conspiracy about the antichrist spirit
[4:03] and it sort of falls and people
[4:04] sometimes lump those things into that
[4:07] category
[4:08] of uh people who are uh you know end
[4:11] time
[4:12] prophets of doom and gloom and
[4:15] destruction
[4:16] and conspiracy and it sort of all falls
[4:19] in that same exact category
[4:21] and so as as christians we have to be
[4:24] careful that we don't
[4:26] lose interest in what the the biblical
[4:30] teaching of what the spirit of christ
[4:31] and the spirit of antichrist is
[4:33] just because it's been polarized are
[4:36] misused
[4:38] by people and so the book of revelation
[4:42] reveals excuse me i'm very congested
[4:45] this morning
[4:47] that this man has had a huge part to
[4:50] play
[4:51] in the world and the history of the
[4:54] world
[4:54] and the entire framework of the world in
[4:57] fact
[4:58] this man was at the very beginning of
[5:02] of your bible you read in in the book of
[5:04] genesis
[5:06] we believe that jesus christ
[5:09] is living today
[5:13] we believe he's a real person now we
[5:15] know that we have the spirit the bible
[5:17] says
[5:17] you have the spirit of christ in your
[5:19] heart and that's why you cry abba father
[5:22] so we know that we have the spirit
[5:24] of christ living inside of us
[5:27] but just as much as there's the spirit
[5:30] of christ that dwells in you jesus is
[5:33] also
[5:34] a real person a real actual person
[5:38] and when we meet him that day we won't
[5:40] meet a spirit
[5:42] or a spirit that lives within us but
[5:44] we'll meet the real
[5:45] man christ jesus
[5:49] just as much as we believe that today
[5:50] there's a real person named the devil
[5:54] but if there's a person named the devil
[5:56] then there's also the spirit of the
[5:58] devil
[5:59] so if you have christ who's a real
[6:01] person and then this spirit that lives
[6:03] and
[6:03] works in the world and has been working
[6:06] since the new testament church since
[6:08] this day of pentecost
[6:10] then also we must realize that there's
[6:13] a spirit of the devil spirit of christ
[6:17] and a spirit of antichrist galatians 4 6
[6:21] you don't need to turn wit
[6:22] because you are sons god hath sent forth
[6:25] the spirit of his son
[6:26] into your hearts crying abba father so
[6:29] that spirit that's at work in the world
[6:31] the antichrist
[6:33] is a spirit and just as much as christ
[6:35] has given
[6:36] us the spirit and enable that spirit
[6:38] enables us
[6:40] to do what we do as christians to live a
[6:42] christian life that's the only way you
[6:44] can live a christian life
[6:46] is the spirit of christ anything outside
[6:49] of that
[6:49] is false and manufactured but the true
[6:53] true uh life of christ is by is led as
[6:56] lived by a spirit the same exact way
[6:59] that what operates in the world today
[7:02] to accomplish the purpose of the
[7:05] antichrist
[7:06] is a spirit that gets on people
[7:09] and it gets on churches and it gets in
[7:12] politics
[7:13] and it gets in religion and we have to
[7:16] be
[7:17] very careful that we always try
[7:20] the spirits as first john said beloved
[7:25] believe not every spirit but try the
[7:28] spirits
[7:29] because spirits are real and
[7:32] spirits are influential and spirits
[7:36] change your mind
[7:39] and they view they change your entire
[7:41] perception so
[7:42] we should always be aware that there's a
[7:45] spirit of christ that's at work
[7:47] in our lives and there's also a spirit
[7:50] of the antichrist
[7:52] at work in the world
[7:56] i'm just going to read it again this is
[7:58] that spirit of antichrist wherever you
[8:00] have heard
[8:01] that it should come and even now
[8:04] already is in the world
[8:09] and so the antichrist what we realize
[8:12] because people have looked at it as a
[8:14] man and the bible speaks of the man of
[8:17] sin
[8:18] that that that actual substantive
[8:22] person of satan incarnate uh
[8:26] they're looking for that man of sin to
[8:28] be revealed
[8:29] but what they miss is that the
[8:31] antichrist is not going to suddenly
[8:34] appear
[8:35] one day but he's on the scene right now
[8:40] in the form of a spirit
[8:44] and his spirit is mysteriously working
[8:47] setting up his kingdom and you say
[8:49] brother matt where is he setting up his
[8:51] kingdom
[8:52] in the hearts of cold
[8:56] lukewarm make believers
[9:01] that's where his kingdom is built in
[9:04] religion
[9:05] and so when the man of sin is revealed
[9:08] publicly just as when christ when all
[9:11] eyes shall see him and behold him
[9:14] when he's revealed publicly the hearts
[9:17] of of his people of the world the
[9:20] children of disobedience have
[9:22] already been prepared to receive him
[9:25] that's why they accept him because their
[9:27] hearts are already being prepared
[9:30] now and they don't even realize it the
[9:33] world doesn't even
[9:34] realize that they're that things uh
[9:37] in this world very real things very
[9:39] things that we interact with daily
[9:41] are being used by the spirit of
[9:44] antichrist to prepare
[9:46] the hearts of people
[9:49] paul warned of this and he said that in
[9:51] the last days
[9:52] false prophets would infiltrate the
[9:55] church remember brother bannon preaches
[9:56] the message the invasion
[9:58] of the united states and he's not
[10:01] talking about an army physical army or
[10:04] communism but he's talking about the
[10:06] spirit of
[10:07] antichrist invading the united states
[10:11] and paul says that false prophets would
[10:13] infiltrate the church
[10:14] preaching another gospel
[10:19] so what is his doctrine what is what is
[10:21] his purpose is it
[10:23] uh you know where where do we it's
[10:26] important that we identify
[10:27] where it's at it's a religion
[10:32] it's a false religion but it's a
[10:33] religion and it's
[10:35] it's it's it's uh it's mixed in
[10:38] with with uh with the church and so he
[10:41] said it would infiltrate the church
[10:43] preaching another gospel another jesus
[10:45] many such
[10:46] false prophets uh let me just read this
[10:49] here is paul speaking it says let no man
[10:51] deceive you
[10:52] by any means for that day shall not come
[10:55] except there come a falling away
[10:58] first and that man of sin be revealed
[11:01] the son of perdition who opposeth
[11:06] and exalteth himself above all that is
[11:09] called god
[11:10] or that is worshipped so that he
[11:14] as god sitteth in the temple of god
[11:16] showing himself that he
[11:18] is god so what is the spirit of
[11:20] antichrist doing it's opposing
[11:23] not the church it's not opposing
[11:26] religion
[11:26] the devil doesn't oppose religion he's
[11:29] not against church
[11:31] at all he's not against you saying
[11:34] you're a christian against people saying
[11:36] they're a christian or a christian
[11:37] nation
[11:38] we're a christian nation we're founded
[11:40] on christian principles judeo christian
[11:42] that the devil loves that
[11:45] loves it because it's it's his form of
[11:47] deception
[11:49] so he's not opposing religion he doesn't
[11:52] oppose religious music
[11:54] worship music he doesn't oppose
[11:56] religious
[11:57] christian gatherings he has no problem
[12:00] with that he loves that
[12:01] he doesn't oppose church growth
[12:05] he loves it he doesn't oppose churches
[12:08] mega churches getting bigger and larger
[12:10] and larger you think the devil's warring
[12:12] against that
[12:12] no it's the very foundation and
[12:15] framework
[12:16] that he's built and worked on
[12:19] since the garden of eden and now it's in
[12:22] its glory and so
[12:24] it says he opposes then exalteth himself
[12:27] above
[12:27] all that is called god or that is
[12:30] worshipped
[12:31] listen to some of this because i want to
[12:33] make sure we get to it we don't miss it
[12:35] um some of these quotes if you could
[12:37] just have that ready
[12:39] just for a moment and so we see that in
[12:42] genesis 3
[12:43] 15 there's a reference made the first
[12:46] reference
[12:46] made to the serpent seed and that
[12:50] doctrine is
[12:51] what we believe on the original sin and
[12:52] the serpent seed is not what we're
[12:54] referring to today
[12:55] but it's speaking about the you you'll
[12:58] find in genesis 3 15
[13:00] a reference made to the serpent seed
[13:03] that uh that seed that beginning
[13:07] was what we're speaking about when we
[13:09] say a
[13:10] spirit that would oppose the spirit of
[13:13] god
[13:14] and so it was in opposition to the seed
[13:16] of god
[13:17] it was the spirit of anti of the
[13:19] antichrist
[13:21] in the very beginning in the garden of
[13:24] eden that spoke to
[13:26] eve that was the spirit of antichrist
[13:30] opposing the whole word of god
[13:34] now listen to this very closely that's
[13:38] that serpent that was speaking to eve
[13:42] was the spirit of antichrist in a beast
[13:46] trying to uh trying to and notice what
[13:50] he was challenging
[13:52] not the word but the whole complete word
[13:54] of god
[13:56] so what is the devil against but the
[13:58] bible says just add one word or take one
[14:00] word away
[14:01] so to not believe every word of god is
[14:04] death
[14:04] spiritual death to take 99
[14:08] of it and leave out one percent
[14:11] is the spirit of antichrist
[14:15] and so it was in that spirit trying to
[14:17] question the authority the absolute
[14:20] authority of the whole word of god given
[14:23] to adam and eve in the garden
[14:25] it was that same spirit that spoken the
[14:27] beast to eve was the same
[14:29] spirit that was in cain opposing the
[14:32] revelation
[14:33] of the only god's only provided way of
[14:36] worship
[14:38] it was the same spirit that was in cain
[14:40] that killed his brother
[14:42] abel and opposed abel's sacrifice and
[14:45] his
[14:46] worship and brother branham says that
[14:47] spirit has followed the seed of god that
[14:50] false church and true church like two
[14:53] vines
[14:54] and he said like intermingled twined all
[14:57] throughout
[14:58] the biblical record and all throughout
[15:01] history
[15:02] it always follows that seed and so if it
[15:05] followed at the beginning
[15:06] you can guarantee it's following the
[15:08] true church today
[15:12] and so that spirit is always following
[15:15] that seed and always it always has a
[15:19] mission
[15:20] to not reject you see the devil is much
[15:23] more
[15:24] interested in getting to corrupt
[15:27] your understanding of the word of god
[15:31] he's much more interested in corrupting
[15:34] the church and what we believe
[15:37] than doing away with it he's much more
[15:40] interested in keeping it
[15:43] but corrupting what you believe
[15:47] and so he's always attempting to pervert
[15:49] it or brother branham would call it high
[15:51] bread
[15:52] hybrid religion and he's always
[15:55] attempting to take what's pure
[15:57] and hybrid it to lead people to
[16:00] influence
[16:01] lives and to destroy the holy spirit
[16:05] that's working in the church what is the
[16:07] devil's
[16:08] number one goal to destroy
[16:11] the holy spirit in the church he doesn't
[16:15] want to destroy the church
[16:17] he doesn't want to destroy the framework
[16:19] he just wants to remove the spirit of
[16:21] god
[16:22] out of it listen to some of these i'm
[16:25] going to read them now
[16:26] brother getting if you put that up
[16:30] the powerpoint that we had maybe the
[16:36] screen's not on
[16:37] i don't know
[16:41] no the screen's not on i can see it it's
[16:43] on okay good
[16:47] i'm okay
[16:55] the devil ain't gonna win
[16:58] we're gonna read it
[17:02] and so we see this it goes all the way
[17:04] just as they're pulling that up
[17:07] in revelation in this in the book of
[17:09] revelation chapter two
[17:10] uh and actually in chapter two and in
[17:12] chapter three
[17:14] uh there's a revealing of that spirit
[17:17] that's in the
[17:18] it's been at work in the church in the
[17:21] age of ephesus
[17:22] you'll read in the book of revelations
[17:24] chapter two we'll get that in a second
[17:26] in the in the book of ephesus in the
[17:29] book of revelation
[17:30] that spirit in the first church age this
[17:32] the ephesian church age
[17:34] the bible speaks about false prophets
[17:38] and and deeds let's just read it in
[17:40] revelations chapter 2 you can just turn
[17:42] in your bible
[17:43] revelations 2 chapter 2 unto the angel
[17:46] of the church of ephesus right these
[17:48] things
[17:49] saith he that holdeth the seven stars in
[17:51] his right hand who walketh
[17:53] in the midst of the seven golden
[17:55] candlesticks
[17:56] i know thy works this is revelations 2
[17:59] for those of you turning
[18:01] i know thy works and thy labor and thy
[18:03] patience and how thou
[18:04] can not bear them which are evil now has
[18:07] tried them which say they are apostles
[18:10] and are not and has found them liars
[18:14] and has borne in his patience and for my
[18:16] name's sake has
[18:17] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[18:20] i have somewhat against him because thou
[18:22] has
[18:22] left thy first love remember therefore
[18:26] from where thou art fallen and repent do
[18:28] the first works or else i will come
[18:30] quickly and remove that candlestick
[18:34] notice verse 6
[18:35] but this thou has that thou hate the
[18:37] deeds
[18:38] the deeds so notice that important word
[18:41] here if you go
[18:42] through your church age book you'll
[18:43] remember brother brandon points at this
[18:44] and says this is the beginning of the
[18:46] antichrist spirit
[18:47] it this is where it starts before it's a
[18:50] false prophet
[18:51] crowned in a before it's crowned than a
[18:53] false prophet
[18:54] it starts as a saying remember
[18:58] stars is just the saying in the church
[19:00] and then it moves from a saiyan to deeds
[19:02] and then it moves from deeds i think to
[19:05] works and then into a doctrine
[19:08] and then it's the and then it's the
[19:10] irrefutable
[19:11] uh uncompromisable unnegotiable that's
[19:14] what they call it
[19:15] then they call the unnegotiables that's
[19:18] what our church's big mega churches
[19:20] here in town preaches today the
[19:22] unnegotiables of the faith
[19:24] and nothing against the man or the
[19:25] pastor but the spirit that they're
[19:27] under is the spirit of revelations
[19:29] chapter 16
[19:31] when it speaks of the the three evil
[19:33] spirits that went out of the mouth of
[19:35] the dragon
[19:36] that's revelation 16 13 and i saw three
[19:40] unclean spirits like frogs
[19:43] come out of the mouth of the dragon and
[19:45] out of the mouth of the beast
[19:47] and out of the mouth of the false
[19:49] prophet where did this come from
[19:51] rome it came from romans the spirit of
[19:56] the antichrist that would create a
[19:58] doctrine
[19:59] called the trinity that would lock
[20:02] and bind all denominations
[20:06] though they not don't agree on much they
[20:08] agree on this one thing
[20:10] it's an unnegotiable and this is what it
[20:13] is in revelation 16
[20:15] it's spoken of and i saw three unclean
[20:17] spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
[20:18] of the dragon
[20:19] out of the mouth of the beast and out of
[20:20] the mouth of the false
[20:22] prophet so it's it's it's an it's it
[20:24] starts with a saying
[20:27] and then it's given a doctrine then it's
[20:29] unnegotiable doctrine then it's crowned
[20:31] in a false prophet
[20:33] and so we see it here as deeds in the
[20:36] beginning this is just the beginning in
[20:38] ephesus
[20:39] remember when the church falls away
[20:41] starts to fall away as in ephesus goes
[20:43] through
[20:43] seven church ages till it's restored in
[20:45] this last age
[20:47] through a vindicated prophet i'm glad we
[20:49] we have
[20:50] received a vindicated prophet to restore
[20:53] to us
[20:53] the original faith but in ephesus
[20:57] it's the beginning the deeds of the
[20:58] nicolaitans
[21:00] and it rises out of
[21:03] the church so important and it's
[21:06] remember it's just a perversion to to
[21:08] pervert the true
[21:10] gospel as just as satan did in the
[21:13] beginning
[21:14] he tried to pervert the true gospel to
[21:16] eve now he's perverting it through a
[21:18] doctrine
[21:18] the deeds and the second age smyrna and
[21:21] we won't take time to read it
[21:23] but in smyrna it speaks of the synagogue
[21:27] of satan so notice how it moves from
[21:30] deeds to now it's a church now it's a
[21:32] temple now it's a synagogue now it's in
[21:35] the church
[21:36] the synagogue of satan and so it's the
[21:38] beginning the forming and that
[21:40] submergent age
[21:42] satan now has a building natalie has a
[21:44] framework now that's more than a saying
[21:46] more than a deed
[21:47] corrupting through through through
[21:49] doctrine but now he's got a sin now
[21:51] that's the synagogue
[21:53] of satan it's the spirit of brother adam
[21:56] says
[21:56] within the framework of the true
[21:59] christian church there's two spirits
[22:02] within the framework of the church is
[22:04] two spirits
[22:06] the false false vine and the true vine
[22:09] judas and jesus
[22:10] jacob and esau twins
[22:13] cain and abel all throughout all the way
[22:16] till
[22:16] now listen to what brother adam says
[22:19] here i'm just going to read these
[22:21] and it's not this isn't working so if
[22:23] you can just advance the slide
[22:25] here's what it is listen this is in
[22:27] three witnesses in 1951 here's what it
[22:30] is
[22:30] the antichrist spirit is not the
[22:32] communistic
[22:33] spirit the antichrist spirit is a
[22:36] religious
[22:38] spirit go on
[22:42] demonology religious realm in 1953. you
[22:44] see what i mean about demons they are
[22:46] working they are very religious
[22:48] just as religious oh they go to church
[22:52] every sunday
[22:55] and they don't stop at bethel tabernacle
[23:00] no they come right in this building
[23:04] trying to influence the true church what
[23:06] what what
[23:07] why waste your time on a deceived church
[23:09] down the road
[23:11] why waste your time on deceived people
[23:14] and deceived churches that are already
[23:16] in the system
[23:17] but the spirit of antichrist comes to
[23:20] attack the true church and the true
[23:22] seed trying always to remove the spirit
[23:25] of god
[23:26] why do you think sometimes it's so hard
[23:28] and you feel that
[23:29] cold spirit or dead spirit always trying
[23:31] to creep into the church
[23:34] you think that's the spirit of christ no
[23:37] that's why we fight against it that's
[23:39] why we stand against it
[23:41] that's why we just keep singing even if
[23:43] we don't feel like keeping on singing
[23:45] that's why we just keep on worshiping
[23:46] even when we don't feel like it because
[23:48] we know that
[23:49] though we don't feel like it the spirit
[23:50] of christ in us wants to worship the
[23:52] lord
[23:54] he says they go to church every sunday
[23:55] let's go and let's move on
[23:57] uh to the next slide there brother
[23:58] branham you mean that's the truth
[24:00] that's the kind of spirit that brother
[24:02] madam says that's the kind of spirit
[24:04] that hung jesus christ to the cross what
[24:06] kind of spirit a religious spirit
[24:08] and jesus said you're of your father the
[24:10] devil
[24:11] keep going a little faster now now some
[24:14] of them said oh russia's the antichrist
[24:16] never russia is not the antichrist the
[24:20] antichrist is going to be
[24:21] so religious it will fool the very elect
[24:25] if possible
[24:28] next remember god takes his
[24:31] men but never spirit the devil takes his
[24:34] man but never his spirit
[24:35] now there they are suit yourself i'm
[24:37] only responsible for
[24:39] the truth this is the invasion of the
[24:41] united states 1954.
[24:44] don't you see how religious the devil is
[24:47] the devil is not no
[24:48] anti-great big thing like communism all
[24:51] against christianity
[24:53] that's not that's of oh well well of the
[24:55] devil sure
[24:56] but it's not the antichrist the
[24:59] antichrist
[25:00] is very religious
[25:03] very religious it was a religion
[25:07] it was a religious spirit that crucified
[25:10] jesus it's always been a religious world
[25:15] a religious
[25:16] people that crucifies it's the religious
[25:20] people that was against the true christ
[25:23] it was the religious prophets that was
[25:24] against maika
[25:26] it's the religious people of the day
[25:28] that's against the message of god
[25:32] you want to know who opposes what we
[25:34] believe religion
[25:36] religious people keep going that's fine
[25:39] and the mark of the and this is the
[25:40] junction of time 1956
[25:43] and the mark of the antichrist is to
[25:45] reject
[25:47] that holy ghost so
[25:50] simple my goodness
[25:53] what that's it after all this build up
[25:56] and all this teaching and all the
[25:58] antichrist and we're going to expose him
[25:59] we're going to reveal him and
[26:00] where's he at for the man let's find him
[26:02] let's play a video let's
[26:03] let's get into somewhere in the news or
[26:05] somewhere in the media somewhere in
[26:07] washington
[26:09] the mark of the antichrist is to reject
[26:13] the holy ghost just that
[26:16] simple and you don't reject it
[26:21] by saying i don't want it you don't
[26:23] reject it by saying i don't believe in
[26:25] it
[26:26] you don't reject the holy ghost listen
[26:28] friends it's not those who don't the
[26:30] antichrist is not
[26:31] not having the holy ghost you may not
[26:33] have the holy spirit you may never been
[26:35] born again
[26:36] born of the spirit of god by the baptism
[26:39] of the holy ghost we have a church and
[26:40] there's in a church there's people who
[26:42] are
[26:42] born of the spirit there's some living
[26:44] in justification who've never went to
[26:46] sanctification
[26:47] some have went to sanctification has
[26:48] never went to the filling of the holy
[26:50] ghost
[26:52] that's a fact and they're not just young
[26:55] some of them are old some of them
[26:57] are middle aged doesn't matter what your
[26:59] age is
[27:01] so it the antichrist is not not having
[27:04] the holy ghost
[27:05] it's rejecting the holy ghost and then
[27:07] rejecting it reject it and
[27:09] say i don't want it i don't believe in
[27:11] it i don't accept it it's
[27:13] it's rejecting the holy ghost it's
[27:15] simply
[27:16] not valuing or not putting importance
[27:20] or explaining away or saying it's not
[27:23] necessary
[27:24] that's rejecting the holy ghost
[27:28] why do you think that there would be
[27:29] this spirit that comes around the church
[27:31] that says oh
[27:32] we just been preaching on the holy ghost
[27:33] for years and get the holy ghost and get
[27:35] the holy ghost let's just move on beyond
[27:37] that
[27:37] hold on a minute let's not move on
[27:39] beyond that
[27:40] you can't move beyond that and the mark
[27:43] of the antichrist is to reject that holy
[27:45] ghost which you're sealed outside of the
[27:46] kingdom forever with no no
[27:48] way that will ever be forgiven the seal
[27:50] of god
[27:51] is the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[27:53] mark of the antichrist is to deny it
[27:57] now you're marked one way or the other
[27:59] don't you want to have the holy ghost
[28:01] today
[28:03] next slide that's it let's stand to our
[28:06] feet

[28:08] bit over time but i'm leading worship
