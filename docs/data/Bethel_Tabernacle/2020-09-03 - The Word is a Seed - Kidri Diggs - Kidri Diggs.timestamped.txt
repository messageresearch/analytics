[47:04] thing
[47:06] than the beginning thereof and the
[47:09] patient
[47:10] in spirit is better than the proud in
[47:13] spirit
[47:14] amen the lord of blessing reading of his
[47:15] word you can have your sees tonight
[47:25] thanks bro amen amen by the
[47:28] by the grace of god i want to use for a
[47:31] subject
[47:32] the word is a seed amen you know and
[47:36] that's
[47:36] kind of what i want to deal with tonight
[47:39] is the seed
[47:41] you know and um you know there's a
[47:43] parable where jesus
[47:45] talked about the different kinds of
[47:46] ground and he said that a soil went to
[47:48] sow and
[47:49] you know and as he sold some fell on
[47:52] good ground some fell on
[47:53] stony ground some failed by the wayside
[47:56] and so forth
[47:58] but then he came back in the parable he
[48:00] said you know this is what the soil was
[48:02] sowing
[48:03] the seed was the word hallelujah
[48:06] and he said that you know notice that
[48:09] there was nothing wrong with the seed
[48:12] the problem was the ground that it fell
[48:13] upon
[48:15] so i want to say that in in saying that
[48:18] church that
[48:20] you know whatever seed is in you is
[48:22] gonna only bring forth that life
[48:24] hallelujah you can't be good if evil is
[48:27] in you
[48:28] and you can be evil if good is in you
[48:30] hallelujah
[48:31] your tree can only bring forth what's
[48:33] inside of you hallelujah
[48:35] you know that's the bible and then he
[48:37] said you know in the book of genesis he
[48:39] said that
[48:40] you know god created the heavens and the
[48:42] earth and all these things and y'all
[48:43] know i'm
[48:44] paraphrasing you know and he said uh
[48:47] whose seed is in itself
[48:48] hallelujah you know so that that seed
[48:52] being
[48:52] inside that that tree or that branch or
[48:54] that animal or whatever god created
[48:57] that that life hallelujah is going to
[49:00] come from within that seed who's in
[49:02] itself hallelujah whatever that tree is
[49:05] whatever that animal
[49:06] is nothing can be added to it the life
[49:10] is already in the seed hallelujah so
[49:12] church let's just think about it if we
[49:14] call ourselves the children of god
[49:17] hallelujah
[49:18] if we are the seed of god the life of
[49:21] god
[49:21] what should we bring forth we should
[49:24] bring forth
[49:25] christ's very own life hallelujah
[49:28] we should bring forth the life of the
[49:30] seed hallelujah
[49:31] and he says the word is a seed amen
[49:35] so i want you to catch this tonight
[49:37] church you know that's why it's so
[49:39] important for god to come in our day
[49:42] and restore the word hallelujah restore
[49:46] everything that was lost because what he
[49:48] did was
[49:49] he was restoring original seed
[49:52] hallelujah
[49:53] he is restoring everything that he is
[49:56] hallelujah
[49:57] see the baptist only had a portion of
[49:59] the life
[50:00] but it couldn't bring forth a full
[50:02] mature tree hallelujah
[50:04] and so forth to all the other churches
[50:06] you know the anglo-saxon the
[50:08] the pentecostal the catholics or
[50:10] whatever you want to call it none of
[50:12] them could bring forth
[50:13] the fullness of that tree hallelujah
[50:15] although
[50:16] they had a portion of it church in our
[50:19] day
[50:19] hallelujah we should be seeing the full
[50:22] manifestation of the seed in our life
[50:25] hallelujah
[50:26] but i i i i want to illustrate something
[50:29] to you tonight
[50:33] by the grace of god you know as we talk
[50:35] about the seed we deal with a seed
[50:38] what i have in my hand tonight is a what
[50:40] talk to me
[50:43] i have a seed in my hand hallelujah
[50:47] now how many of you looking at this can
[50:50] tell what kind of seed it is see
[50:54] i see we got some sharp people out here
[50:56] brother said a pc
[50:58] i heard but jason said it's a pc and
[51:00] they are correct
[51:02] but they're identifying the seed by
[51:05] their own experience hallelujah
[51:07] obviously somewhere sometime in a life
[51:10] they've eaten a peach hallelujah
[51:14] and if you eat a peach it'll only come
[51:17] back down to what's inside of it
[51:19] hallelujah a peach seed holy but you
[51:22] know we look at the seed
[51:24] how do we get the life out of the seed
[51:27] first things first
[51:28] the seed has to be now we're thinking
[51:30] about life amen
[51:32] now we have a seed inside of us amen and
[51:35] we know that natural types are spiritual
[51:37] so how does god get life out of you oh
[51:40] my
[51:41] hooray think about it church think about
[51:44] the steps
[51:45] think about the stages that a seed goes
[51:48] through
[51:48] to bring forth life so i asked you the
[51:50] question tonight
[51:52] what's the first thing god does to get
[51:54] life out of you hallelujah
[51:56] if i wanted life out of this pc what was
[51:59] the first thing i got to do
[52:00] i got to bury it
[52:06] so you mean to tell me in order for god
[52:08] to get anything
[52:09] out of me he has to bury me harley but
[52:12] what i want you to understand
[52:14] you're not just buried you're placed in
[52:16] dirty dark
[52:18] filthy conditions hallelujah now
[52:21] remember
[52:22] that's the only way you can get life out
[52:24] of the seed
[52:25] is to put it in some dirt go away to god
[52:29] we ought to rejoice because your trial
[52:31] hallelujah
[52:32] your tribulation hallelujah your
[52:34] sickness your pain
[52:36] your heartache we consider all those
[52:38] things to be
[52:39] dirt but that's god
[52:42] bringing forth life hallelujah
[52:49] somebody rejoice with me hallelujah
[52:52] church i want you to look at your stages
[52:54] a little bit different tonight
[52:56] hallelujah because the only way
[52:58] hallelujah
[52:59] i can get hurry up peaches is for me
[53:02] first to plant the seed in a nasty
[53:05] condition
[53:06] [Music]
[53:08] amen you know if i go out here and i
[53:10] look at the ocean i don't know what
[53:12] ocean we
[53:13] got here on the east coast what is it

[53:17] i i wasn't too good with all that stuff
[53:18] at school
[53:20] all i knew it was with water holly
[53:23] but you know what if i take the seed and
[53:26] i
[53:27] throw it in the atlantic hallelujah
[53:29] there's no guarantee that it'll come
[53:31] forth
[53:32] huh it got water hallelujah but it needs
[53:35] more than water
[53:36] holly it needs some dirt
[53:40] all right you say brother jesus we're in
[53:42] the message there's a good anointing
[53:44] no good without dirt hallelujah
[53:47] you need a filthy condition holy a dark
[53:50] condition oh
[53:51] yeah so let me say this tonight church
[53:53] hallelujah
[53:54] you look at your situation you look at
[53:56] your trial your sickness
[53:58] of what you're going through god planted
[54:00] you in some dirt to bring forth
[54:02] life so let me say this to you tonight
[54:05] our dirt
[54:06] is good dirt
[54:11] all right it has to be good dirt in
[54:14] order for life to come forth
[54:15] but it's still dirt
[54:19] the dirt is no good only
[54:22] to smother the seed
[54:26] and for those of you who are farmers and
[54:28] got gardens and everything
[54:30] i challenge you go home take your seeds
[54:33] and just lay em on the car porch
[54:36] pour water on it let the sun put in a
[54:40] good place
[54:40] where you know the sun hits it all the
[54:42] time and just watch it
[54:44] and watch it and watch it i guarantee
[54:46] you nothing will come forth
[54:49] holy it'll even dry out but no life will
[54:52] come forth
[54:53] holy but in dirt hallelujah just see it
[54:56] and dry out
[54:57] and it'll begin to breathe forth life
[54:59] hallelujah in dirt
[55:00] it'll begin to go to its own
[55:04] metamorphosis
[55:07] they call it a photosynthesis
[55:10] amen
[55:13] i believe that's when light begins to
[55:15] hit the seed
[55:16] hallelujah and that's what happens to us
[55:19] church
[55:20] god allows us for the first stages in
[55:24] our life and we may not even understand
[55:25] why we go through certain things let me
[55:27] tell you god's trying to get the life
[55:29] out of the seed
[55:31] hallelujah and the only way you can get
[55:34] it hallelujah
[55:35] is the first thing for it to be planted
[55:37] in dirt harley
[55:39] in order for us to reap the benefit
[55:42] of the life of the seed the seed has to
[55:45] be put in the conditions
[55:47] where it doesn't even look like it'll be
[55:49] able to come forth
[55:52] and you know hallelujah there's good
[55:55] dirt and there's bad dirt honey
[55:57] but notice i want to say if you bring
[56:00] forth anything
[56:01] that your dirt is good dirt
[56:05] you say homeboy dicks i got this habit i
[56:07] got that habit
[56:08] good dirt if you're still in church good
[56:11] dirt hallelujah
[56:12] you said i'll bring dicks i told a lion
[56:15] i got caught if you're still in church
[56:17] good dirt hallelujah you say oh i got
[56:20] this problem and i watched this or i
[56:22] heard that if you're still in church
[56:24] good dirt you say oh bro dicks i gotta
[56:27] do sickness i got that sickness
[56:29] if you're still in church good dirt
[56:31] hallelujah oh
[56:32] yeah you need some dirt to come forth
[56:37] and you know sometimes hallelujah we
[56:40] don't even pray like we ought to
[56:42] till we feel like we in dirt
[56:46] you know what you say sometimes we like
[56:49] to have dirt on one another
[56:52] oh let me tell you about the dirt and
[56:54] they lie that's all right
[56:55] talk about my dirt because all my dirt
[56:58] doing is making me a better person
[57:00] hallelujah all my dirt doing is bringing
[57:03] forth a greater manifestation
[57:05] of the life of the city now let's dig
[57:08] into it a little bit deeper holiday
[57:10] i ain't gonna be long y'all know i'm
[57:11] about to close
[57:13] but look church holly you bury it
[57:16] and you place it in dirt hallelujah and
[57:19] you know
[57:20] it seems so it's insignificant
[57:23] because when we go home when we walk out
[57:26] of here
[57:27] most of us are going to walk on what
[57:29] dirt
[57:31] holy we walk on dirt almost every day of
[57:34] our life
[57:35] but do you even realize that you're
[57:38] walking on life
[57:45] it's so common to us that we don't even
[57:47] realize
[57:49] that we're walking on life that's
[57:51] already planted
[57:52] beneath us hallelujah amen and as you
[57:55] walk hallelujah
[57:56] you walk on different dirt different
[57:58] things in your life
[57:59] you're walking hallelujah on your
[58:02] growing process
[58:04] hallelujah the prophet of god even gave
[58:06] an illustration
[58:07] that you can take this seed and play
[58:09] concrete over it
[58:13] i know some people just uh got a piece
[58:16] of their yard paved
[58:17] you watch after luau the area that they
[58:21] got paved
[58:22] all around the grass gonna start to grow
[58:24] you know why because that's where grass
[58:25] used to be
[58:28] and let me tell you this church holy god
[58:31] has always been there with the believer
[58:34] in their dark trial god has always been
[58:38] with the believer
[58:39] in their dirt hallelujah was he there
[58:42] with abraham in his life
[58:43] was he there with rahab and her
[58:45] prostitution
[58:47] god was always there in the midst of the
[58:50] dirt
[58:50] he was there with the whoremongers he
[58:52] was there with the drunkards
[58:54] he was there with the liars and the
[58:55] cheaters god loves
[58:57] good dirt amen
[59:02] we ought to rejoice notice
[59:06] i'm not talking about sin
[59:10] i'm talking about the stages of growth
[59:12] holy
[59:14] see cuz because as that seed begins to
[59:16] grow what does it do
[59:18] it pushes out of the dirt
[59:24] so don't worry about your young people
[59:25] hallelujah don't worry about your
[59:27] children hallelujah
[59:28] look at they dirty and say that's good
[59:30] dirt because we got to realize that
[59:32] hallelujah
[59:33] we all came through some dirt holly i
[59:36] just did some of the same things
[59:38] that my children do and hallelujah so
[59:40] you know what it don't bother me
[59:42] because if god cleaned me up out of the
[59:44] dirt he can clean him up out of the dirt
[59:46] hurry up if he can wash the wash me he
[59:49] can wash them hardly
[59:50] because you know what you say why you
[59:52] say that because it's the same seed
[59:55] i'm not saying my children of the devil
[59:57] know they got the same seed i got
[1:00:00] so their dirt is good dirt we're gonna
[1:00:04] go to pentecost right now somebody say
[1:00:05] dirt
[1:00:06] somebody say good dirt somebody say i
[1:00:09] got
[1:00:10] good dirt
[1:00:16] see me personally i love to snatch the
[1:00:19] enemy's power away
[1:00:22] because what he tries to do is make us
[1:00:24] feel bad by our mistakes
[1:00:27] he tries to make us feel bad about our
[1:00:29] dark places earlier
[1:00:31] you know priya future somebody could be
[1:00:33] going through depression right now
[1:00:35] holly but that depression in the form of
[1:00:38] good dirt
[1:00:39] is only to show you that god can lift
[1:00:41] you out of it
[1:00:43] hallelujah you might say well brother
[1:00:45] jesus i got i'm seeking i got
[1:00:47] this problem in that problem that's good
[1:00:49] dirt hallelujah
[1:00:50] because god uses that sickness to show
[1:00:52] he's a healer
[1:00:54] so you ought to rejoice right now no
[1:00:57] matter how you feel hallelujah
[1:00:59] life is coming forth holy god needs that
[1:01:02] dirt
[1:01:02] to bring forth life oh i feel my helper
[1:01:06] coming on
[1:01:07] hallelujah
[1:01:14] let me tell you something rejoicing is
[1:01:16] in your seed
[1:01:19] it's a part of the life hallelujah you
[1:01:21] can't get here
[1:01:23] you can't get god without praise you
[1:01:26] can't get god without worship hallelujah
[1:01:28] it's a part of the seed hallelujah
[1:01:33] you say well brother jesus that ain't in
[1:01:36] me and i'll tell you
[1:01:37] that you don't have the seed of god in
[1:01:39] you
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:42] because god loves worship
[1:01:47] first thing he did was he created angels
[1:01:50] to do what to worship him
[1:01:53] hardly if you go a little deeper and job
[1:01:56] when asked job said job
[1:01:57] where were you hallelujah when when the
[1:02:00] sons of god shout in the morning started
[1:02:02] saying
[1:02:03] and we had a prophet come forth and tell
[1:02:05] us that we were in the mind of god
[1:02:07] hollywood amen what were we doing in the
[1:02:11] mind of god
[1:02:12] we were singing and worshiping
[1:02:16] wow so don't get mad remember i told you
[1:02:19] last time there was a rumor
[1:02:23] remember that rumor that scripture
[1:02:27] proves it wrong
[1:02:31] because that scripture says that we all
[1:02:33] were in the mind of god
[1:02:35] with the morning stars and the sons of
[1:02:37] god singing and shouting for joy
[1:02:40] so why is it so hard to do on this side
[1:02:45] because we get our own personalities in
[1:02:47] the way we don't want personality
[1:02:49] we want life that's what we want we want
[1:02:52] life hallelujah
[1:02:53] remember earlier the end of a thing
[1:02:56] is better than the beginning of a thing
[1:02:59] so you look at this right now
[1:03:01] this is no good hallelujah i can't eat
[1:03:04] this and be satisfied
[1:03:06] how many of y'all walk around eating
[1:03:08] seeds
[1:03:14] we're gonna pray for you brother
[1:03:18] because that's unnatural just to achieve
[1:03:21] honey
[1:03:21] what we're supposed to do is eat the
[1:03:23] fruit of the seed
[1:03:25] and you look at the church i'm running
[1:03:28] let me back up let me back up
[1:03:30] hallelujah let me back up whoa
[1:03:32] hallelujah
[1:03:33] i love a church that pulls hollywood
[1:03:37] and you know let's back up a little bit
[1:03:39] i want how you want the young people to
[1:03:40] be able to get this
[1:03:42] first things first first stage the seed
[1:03:44] is buried honestly
[1:03:46] it's put in a dark condition hallelujah
[1:03:49] and it can't get out the only way it can
[1:03:53] get out
[1:03:53] is to grow
[1:04:00] oh hallelujah
[1:04:03] i feel like i got my shout out now going
[1:04:05] tonight hallelujah
[1:04:08] hey the only way hallelujah that this
[1:04:11] seed can get out of darkness
[1:04:13] is to grow hardly so if you get healed
[1:04:16] that's a growing process
[1:04:18] if you come out of depression that's a
[1:04:19] growing process
[1:04:21] if you believe god for a certain
[1:04:23] substance or circumstance
[1:04:25] that is a growing process hallelujah
[1:04:28] when you overcome hurt and pain and
[1:04:31] loneliness and all these things
[1:04:32] what is it it's a growing process
[1:04:37] so if you ever get back in those
[1:04:39] conditions again
[1:04:40] you'll understand that it's a process
[1:04:43] and you won't be discouraged hardly
[1:04:46] first things first is
[1:04:47] it's in a dark dismal condition and and
[1:04:50] the only way hollywood but let's look at
[1:04:52] this condition a little bit more
[1:04:55] holly little condition of the seed
[1:04:59] church the seed is planted in dirt
[1:05:03] and that dirt it compacts it
[1:05:08] smothers the seed
[1:05:11] oh no water no sunlight
[1:05:15] it's smothered by dirt honey
[1:05:19] but that's what it needs
[1:05:22] that's the only way hallelujah that the
[1:05:25] processes
[1:05:26] within the genetic substance of the seed
[1:05:29] can come forth
[1:05:31] it's for it to feel like hallelujah is
[1:05:33] closed in
[1:05:36] i'm finna say something powerful right
[1:05:38] now i want you to catch it
[1:05:40] that seed has to feel like it has no
[1:05:44] choice
[1:05:49] think about it that seed in the ground
[1:05:52] surrounded by dirt
[1:05:53] smothered and compacted by dirt what
[1:05:55] choice does it has
[1:05:57] the only thing you can do is die
[1:06:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:05] and sometimes god will let us get in
[1:06:06] conditions when we're smothered
[1:06:08] hallelujah
[1:06:09] and we feel like we have no choice what
[1:06:12] does that do
[1:06:12] that causes us to doubt our ways and
[1:06:16] rely on god
[1:06:18] we say lord help me and the only thing
[1:06:21] we can do
[1:06:22] is die and right
[1:06:29] i know i ain't the only one y'all just
[1:06:32] good at holding y'alls
[1:06:35] and when you get home and you begin to
[1:06:36] recite what was said and you got your
[1:06:39] portion
[1:06:39] you're gonna be in the mirror like
[1:06:44] i know i know us i know what you do
[1:06:48] hallelujah you gonna be in the mirror
[1:06:50] trying to imitate me
[1:06:55] why because that happiness you feel is a
[1:06:58] part of the seed
[1:07:00] hallelujah it ain't something strange
[1:07:03] that's a part of the life hallelujah but
[1:07:06] church you look it's compacted
[1:07:08] it's smothered by dirt it only has one
[1:07:10] choice
[1:07:12] and that is to die
[1:07:15] but dying is good hallelujah because
[1:07:18] once that seed hallelujah
[1:07:20] in the ground smothered by dirt dark
[1:07:22] conditions
[1:07:23] heavy trials sickness heartache pain
[1:07:26] what happens
[1:07:27] the shell begins to pull back
[1:07:34] what is god trying to do he's trying to
[1:07:36] get rid of your flesh
[1:07:39] he's trying to get rid of the out with
[1:07:41] you so that the real
[1:07:42] end with you could come out hallelujah
[1:07:45] hallelujah
[1:07:46] so he'll put us in conditions as a seed
[1:07:49] that we have no choice
[1:07:50] but to die to our thoughts die to our
[1:07:53] desires
[1:07:54] die to our ways why so real original
[1:07:57] life can come forward hallelujah
[1:08:01] and then as that original life comes
[1:08:03] forth the sea
[1:08:04] the shell breaks open and the real
[1:08:07] dramatized sea
[1:08:08] inside church what we're seeing right
[1:08:10] now
[1:08:11] this right here is not the seed
[1:08:15] this is the shell hallelujah the life is
[1:08:18] on the inside
[1:08:20] but it takes a different condition to
[1:08:23] bring it forth
[1:08:27] you have to be more than just a church
[1:08:29] member
[1:08:31] hallelujah but you have to be in a place
[1:08:35] holy when you die right to your own
[1:08:38] thoughts your own desires
[1:08:39] and that shell begins to break back
[1:08:41] cuddling when the shell begins to break
[1:08:44] off
[1:08:44] you know that's a type of that's a type
[1:08:46] of you coming into the holy ghost
[1:08:51] because it's no longer you that liveth
[1:08:53] but it's christ
[1:08:54] inside that liveth in you hallelujah
[1:08:57] glory
[1:08:58] hallelujah listen let me read you
[1:09:01] something right quick
[1:09:03] this is the prophet of god saying you
[1:09:04] notice we started out and we were saying
[1:09:06] that the word is a seed
[1:09:08] church i want you to understand what
[1:09:10] you're hearing right now
[1:09:12] is a seed holy
[1:09:15] and what i'm doing by the grace of god
[1:09:18] i'm preaching the word but what i'm
[1:09:20] preaching
[1:09:21] is supposed to be planted on your ground
[1:09:24] hallelujah
[1:09:25] notice what i'm saying by the grace of
[1:09:27] god if i'm anointed
[1:09:29] and preaching by the holy spirit what
[1:09:31] i'm saying is truth
[1:09:34] so it has to bring forth the life behind
[1:09:37] it
[1:09:38] and if you receive it hallelujah you
[1:09:41] didn't take it hallelujah
[1:09:43] you succumbed what's being preached you
[1:09:45] will become the very thing
[1:09:47] that you're eating oh yeah
[1:09:50] so church when we think about the word
[1:09:52] or the message of the
[1:09:53] hour you know the prophet of god would
[1:09:55] say i got thus said the lord
[1:09:58] can i get a man he would say that all
[1:10:00] the time
[1:10:01] i got thus saying the lord i believe
[1:10:03] that this is thus saith the lord now how
[1:10:05] many of us
[1:10:06] believe that the prophet had thus had
[1:10:08] the lord and we
[1:10:09] have eaten the book so you and i have
[1:10:12] thus said the lord
[1:10:14] hallelujah we have the very same word
[1:10:17] life because it ain't a different seed
[1:10:24] it can only bring forth the same thing
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:30] listen again
[1:10:33] to get to this i had to eat the fruit
[1:10:39] so for us to get to the manifestation
[1:10:40] that we've seen
[1:10:42] in a prophetic ministry we have to eat
[1:10:44] the fruit
[1:10:46] oh yeah we have to eat the word
[1:10:48] hallelujah we have to eat this message
[1:10:51] we have to eat the bible we have to eat
[1:10:53] jesus christ holy
[1:10:55] that's the only way you're going to see
[1:10:57] the life within
[1:10:59] hallelujah if you don't get to that
[1:11:01] place all you got is shell
[1:11:06] and i'll tell you right now if anybody
[1:11:08] want a piece of this is a little piece
[1:11:10] broke off
[1:11:12] you wanna eat this i bet you nine times
[1:11:14] out of ten my brother eat seeds you
[1:11:16] won't taste
[1:11:20] i guarantee you that the fruit of this
[1:11:24] tastes way better than just the shell of
[1:11:26] this
[1:11:30] anything you plant earlier you're not
[1:11:33] trying to get
[1:11:35] the shell you want the fruit
[1:11:39] so what is god trying to get from us why
[1:11:41] did he give us a message with us says
[1:11:43] the lord
[1:11:44] he's trying to get the fruits of himself
[1:11:49] he's trying to get that word that of
[1:11:51] like oh my church look at it
[1:11:53] look at it good now if i plant this and
[1:11:56] it comes up and it produces fruit
[1:11:58] hallelujah and i get the fruit and it
[1:12:00] comes back to this
[1:12:01] what did i get when i get the fruit i
[1:12:04] get original seeds
[1:12:08] that's why i'm kind of leery of eating
[1:12:11] fruit
[1:12:11] with no seed
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:16] some of us will be eating
[1:12:20] no seed
[1:12:23] hybrid thank god for my brother he
[1:12:27] he graced with seeds amen
[1:12:31] phil pray hallelujah
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:34] you're a special breed holiday but you
[1:12:37] know church
[1:12:38] hallelujah if if if you eat fruit and
[1:12:41] you get back to the seed
[1:12:43] you get original so when you're eating
[1:12:46] honey
[1:12:47] watermelon or or or grapes or
[1:12:50] or apples or whatever you eat and
[1:12:52] there's no seed
[1:12:54] that means it's not original
[1:13:00] oh now what y'all gonna do y'all go home
[1:13:02] and eat your fruit and look at it
[1:13:05] let's see if he got a seed you better
[1:13:07] you better examine what you eating to
[1:13:09] see if he got
[1:13:10] life inside of it because if it don't
[1:13:12] have life inside of it
[1:13:14] it won't digest the same whoa
[1:13:17] not only it won't digest the same it
[1:13:19] doesn't have the same
[1:13:20] nourishment in it why because there's no
[1:13:23] life inside
[1:13:27] hallelujah there's no life inside of it
[1:13:30] because there's no seed
[1:13:35] now i ain't gonna say that i won't eat a
[1:13:37] watermelon without no seed
[1:13:42] cause sometimes they sweeter sometimes
[1:13:45] they're bigger
[1:13:46] but you know it just helps my conscience
[1:13:48] a little bit more
[1:13:50] when i can scrape them seeds off
[1:13:53] it just helps my conscience a little bit
[1:13:54] more when i can pluck them seeds out
[1:13:56] them grapes that need
[1:13:58] it just can you imagine eating a peach
[1:14:01] and never get down to the seed
[1:14:06] do you realize if you eat something like
[1:14:08] that you're eating science
[1:14:13] that's what you're eating you're eating
[1:14:15] scientific genetics
[1:14:19] but when we can eat fruit and we can
[1:14:21] come back to this
[1:14:22] we're eating the book of genesis eating
[1:14:28] original life
[1:14:30] original seed hallelujah original
[1:14:32] substance
[1:14:33] what did he say he said those are my
[1:14:36] children my sheep who know my voice
[1:14:38] he said i give unto him eternal life
[1:14:40] what is he giving us
[1:14:41] that word eternal means zoe he's giving
[1:14:44] us god's
[1:14:45] own very life so when we eat this word
[1:14:49] when we eat this unveiled holy
[1:14:51] just this bread that god has unveiled to
[1:14:54] us
[1:14:54] hallelujah in this end time what are we
[1:14:56] eating we're eating god's very own life
[1:14:59] so we eat god's very own life we become
[1:15:02] what we're eating and we begin to
[1:15:04] manifest
[1:15:05] god's very own life
[1:15:08] but what i love about that is i started
[1:15:11] out in dirt
[1:15:16] i started out looking like nothing
[1:15:21] i started out looking crazy i started
[1:15:24] out looking like i'd never be a benefit
[1:15:25] honey
[1:15:26] but god planned it that way holy
[1:15:29] because the end of a thing is better
[1:15:31] than the beginning of a thing
[1:15:33] let me finish hallelujah
[1:15:41] somebody say good dirt
[1:15:44] and i know i know some of y'all kids
[1:15:47] gonna try to use that against your
[1:15:48] parents

[1:16:04] i'm talking about when you're living and
[1:16:06] you've dedicated yourself to god and
[1:16:08] you may make mistakes in your growth
[1:16:10] processing you may do certain things
[1:16:12] that
[1:16:12] hollywood you don't want to do amen
[1:16:16] then you're good dirt because remember
[1:16:18] he said
[1:16:19] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[1:16:21] fruit
[1:16:22] hallelujah and a bad tree cannot bring
[1:16:24] forth good food hallelujah
[1:16:26] so if you are a child of god hallelujah
[1:16:29] when you go through things is for your
[1:16:31] good
[1:16:33] he did all things work together for good
[1:16:36] to those who love god are called to
[1:16:37] conscious purpose
[1:16:38] all right oh my holy luke

[1:16:51] supposed to
[1:16:52] oh hello this word

[1:18:19] because what is it doing is showing who
[1:18:22] really loves god
[1:18:27] and people find all kind of reasons not
[1:18:28] to come to church
[1:18:30] just remember there's a prophecy in the
[1:18:33] last days hallelujah

[1:19:00] they're ever learning but they'll never
[1:19:03] come to a surrender
[1:19:05] amen and they even fight you with the
[1:19:08] calls
[1:19:09] so they can stay home

[1:20:29] want you to think about
[1:20:31] a divine promise that you're believing
[1:20:33] god to fulfill hallelujah
[1:20:35] and if you believe that promise holier
[1:20:38] in seed form

[1:20:42] what you believe
[1:20:44] hallelujah all right if god is a healer
[1:20:49] holy and i believe that god is obligated
[1:20:53] to show me the manifestation
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:56] amen the prophet of god said
[1:20:59] if you're believing the word a certain
[1:21:00] way he said god is
[1:21:02] and it's the true way according to his
[1:21:04] promise he said god is
[1:21:06] guilty until he fulfills that in your
[1:21:08] life like you believe it
[1:21:13] i'm talking about truth now if you
[1:21:16] believe god is a healer
[1:21:17] and you are sick the power of god said
[1:21:19] god is guilty until he heals you
[1:21:22] he said the scriptures are guilty until
[1:21:24] they're manifest in your life
[1:21:26] if you believe them like they are amen
[1:21:30] he said the word is a seed but the seed
[1:21:33] won't grow
[1:21:34] unless it's placed in the right kind of
[1:21:36] ground
[1:21:37] no matter how much seed you got if
[1:21:40] you're
[1:21:41] afraid to sow it there's no good yeah
[1:21:45] church look now we take the seed
[1:21:48] hallelujah the stages hallelujah
[1:21:52] as this seed begin to grow i'm winding

[1:21:55] the punch line cause i don't have none
[1:21:58] i hope you ain't waiting on a special
[1:22:00] coat where you wow

[1:22:12] sniff
[1:22:15] hallelujah because then there's
[1:22:18] something hallelujah
[1:22:19] stopping the flow of water from hitting
[1:22:22] your plant
[1:22:23] because cause mothers and sisters you
[1:22:25] know and maybe some of you brothers who
[1:22:27] who have cultivated land you can take a
[1:22:30] plant hallelujah
[1:22:31] that's growing fine it's in a good spot

[1:22:35] and you move it and it starts to die
[1:22:38] hallelujah
[1:22:39] church let me tell you if you didn't
[1:22:41] stop growing you need to go back to that
[1:22:43] position
[1:22:44] hallelujah get back in that place where
[1:22:46] you were growing hallelujah
[1:22:48] get back in that spot holy where the sun
[1:22:50] is touching you
[1:22:51] where water is doing what it's supposed
[1:22:52] to do so you can grow
[1:22:54] it's unnatural for a seed not to bring
[1:22:57] full of life
[1:22:58] it's unnatural for a seed not to bring
[1:23:01] forth what's inside of it
[1:23:06] and if you are not bringing forth oh
[1:23:08] yeah the word of this hour
[1:23:10] her the restored scriptures of our day
[1:23:13] that means somewhere you've gotten out
[1:23:16] of position
[1:23:21] but you look at this and you take it all
[1:23:23] right let's look at it now
[1:23:25] are you with me where where do we stop
[1:23:27] the sea was
[1:23:29] breaking away because it was in so much
[1:23:30] darkness right
[1:23:33] y'all with me it was breaking away
[1:23:37] because it was just so much dirt but you
[1:23:40] know the shell
[1:23:42] it falls on this side falls on that side
[1:23:44] and it makes room
[1:23:46] for the real life to come out and it's
[1:23:49] that real life that pushes out of the
[1:23:52] dirt
[1:23:55] remember he said i give you a new spirit
[1:23:58] and then i'll put
[1:23:59] my spirit in you see it's his spirit
[1:24:03] that pushes us out of those conditions
[1:24:05] hallelujah
[1:24:06] we can't do nothing without the holy
[1:24:08] ghost
[1:24:09] hallelujah you think i'll say oh i can
[1:24:12] go here i'm all right
[1:24:13] i can do this i can listen to that i'm
[1:24:14] all right you can't do it with your
[1:24:16] spirit
[1:24:18] your spirit is still shale hallelujah
[1:24:22] your spirit is no good it has to fall
[1:24:24] away hallelujah
[1:24:26] and god will put his spirit inside of
[1:24:28] you honey
[1:24:29] and that is what gives you power to come
[1:24:31] out of the dirt hut
[1:24:33] and as that seed begins to grow what's
[1:24:36] causing it to grow
[1:24:37] sunlight and water let me say something
[1:24:39] real clear hey man
[1:24:40] i want to encourage you tonight hello if
[1:24:43] the
[1:24:44] seed here ever breaks out of the shell
[1:24:47] nothing can stop it from coming forth
[1:24:52] wow
[1:24:56] use as soon as you give your life to god
[1:24:58] you go through a hard trial
[1:25:00] nothing can stop it from coming forth
[1:25:04] once it touches water nothing
[1:25:07] can stop it from coming forth listen
[1:25:10] church
[1:25:10] when it comes to growing in god there is
[1:25:13] no reversal process
[1:25:18] if he ever circumcises you he can never
[1:25:21] find what he cut off
[1:25:27] it's not over here in some kind of
[1:25:28] holding block for you to mess up and
[1:25:30] then god said okay
[1:25:31] i uncircumcise you now no
[1:25:35] once the process starts there's nothing

[1:32:57] read it again he says everything
[1:32:59] that you have need of in this earth's
[1:33:01] journey
[1:33:02] is in you when you receive the holy
[1:33:04] ghost hallelujah

[1:33:30] we can leave out here as a church
[1:33:32] believing hallelujah
[1:33:35] not wanting believing
[1:33:39] because you know we have to change our
[1:33:42] language
[1:33:43] you know we walk out and say man i just
[1:33:45] want the lord to bless me with this
[1:33:47] i want the lord to bless me with this
[1:33:49] you say no i'm waiting for god to
[1:33:51] fulfill this in my life
[1:33:54] hallelujah i'm believing god to fulfill
[1:33:57] this
[1:33:59] according to his will it's a part of the
[1:34:01] seed holy
[1:34:03] amen he says
[1:34:07] but the only thing you have to do is
[1:34:09] keep drinking
[1:34:10] and drinking now i'm coming down i get
[1:34:12] nervous he said the people
[1:34:14] don't get thirsty enough see that tree
[1:34:18] that little branch it has to remain
[1:34:20] thirsty
[1:34:22] because if it doesn't get thirsty it
[1:34:24] won't drink
[1:34:25] and it'll be water all around of it
[1:34:27] sitting on top
[1:34:28] but you ever notice hallelujah it rains
[1:34:32] and then the rain goes away what
[1:34:33] happened to it it doesn't evaporate
[1:34:36] it goes in the ground amen
[1:34:44] what is it doing it's bringing forth
[1:34:47] more life
[1:34:51] thank god for my thunderstorm
[1:34:56] but you know what we do we have
[1:34:56] thunderstorms and some of us stop
[1:34:58] driving i can't see
[1:35:02] no keep riding keep riding
[1:35:06] because you stay the course long enough
[1:35:08] you'll drive yourself right out of the
[1:35:09] storm
[1:35:10] hallelujah hurray where it's dry amen
[1:35:14] he said the people don't get thirsty
[1:35:15] enough the bible says blessed are ye
[1:35:17] when you do hunger and thirst
[1:35:19] after righteousness when ye thirst when
[1:35:20] you're thirsty you can drink
[1:35:22] and the more you drink the more you can
[1:35:24] spread out the more grace you get
[1:35:26] the more power you have the more faith
[1:35:28] you have as you keep drinking
[1:35:32] that's why we read our bible that's why
[1:35:34] we study this message hallelujah
[1:35:36] because we get more power we get more
[1:35:38] grace we get more fame hallelujah
[1:35:40] amen keep drinking from christ who is
[1:35:42] the inexhaustible
[1:35:44] life hallelujah drinking the seed form
[1:35:48] he's an inexhaustible fountain
[1:35:52] hallelujah but you know what the key is
[1:35:57] in my closing this is the key what we
[1:36:00] have to do is that tree
[1:36:02] as it comes out of the dirt and some of
[1:36:05] you may not be in a dirt stage right now
[1:36:08] some of you may be you didn't pushed out
[1:36:10] of that
[1:36:11] now you're in the presence of the sun
[1:36:14] and now you just a bare tree
[1:36:17] with no fruit still ain't no good to us
[1:36:25] what good are you to me without the
[1:36:27] fruits of jesus christ
[1:36:28] being manifested out of your tree
[1:36:32] you just a big tree standing there
[1:36:35] let me tell you a little story i like
[1:36:38] telling the story
[1:36:40] there's a young preacher that people
[1:36:41] used to say man you need to study and
[1:36:43] and maybe god will use you and you'll
[1:36:45] become a preacher so he started studying
[1:36:47] and
[1:36:48] getting his life together and just like
[1:36:49] everybody was telling him he became a
[1:36:51] preacher
[1:36:52] but once he became a preacher he got
[1:36:54] conviction
[1:36:55] so all the people that encouraged him
[1:36:58] they didn't like him so much when he
[1:36:59] started preaching against him
[1:37:02] then they started coming against him and
[1:37:04] saying are you too young and you two
[1:37:06] you two that so one day he went to the
[1:37:08] past he's in the pastor's office
[1:37:10] he said pastor the people that once
[1:37:12] supported me
[1:37:13] they don't support me no more he said
[1:37:16] son come here let me show you something
[1:37:18] he said look at this wonder he said what
[1:37:20] do you see he say i see two trees
[1:37:22] he said what kind of tree he say one is
[1:37:24] an oak tree one is a pecan tree
[1:37:26] he said what you see at the bottom of
[1:37:27] that at that oak tree he said nothing
[1:37:30] he said what you see at the bottom of
[1:37:32] that pecan tree they say sticks
[1:37:34] shoes rocks
[1:37:38] all kinds of stuff he said see this is
[1:37:40] the difference of the two trees
[1:37:42] he says the oak tree doesn't have
[1:37:45] anything
[1:37:46] anybody wants so nobody throws at his
[1:37:49] fruit
[1:37:50] he says but the pecan tree everybody
[1:37:52] wants pecans
[1:37:53] so to get it you got to throw at it
[1:37:55] hallelujah
[1:37:56] so if you're being thrown out that means
[1:37:58] somebody you got what somebody wants
[1:38:00] hallelujah
[1:38:01] the only reason people are throwing at
[1:38:03] you the only reason they lie
[1:38:05] the only reason they talking about you
[1:38:06] because they see your fruit and they
[1:38:08] want it
[1:38:12] we got to let them eat
[1:38:16] hallelujah listen he said you are a
[1:38:19] covenant people of god
[1:38:21] god god took christ apart at calvary
[1:38:25] making the covenant swearing by himself
[1:38:27] and he took the body upon heaven
[1:38:29] which will return someday he says but
[1:38:31] the spirit he gave back
[1:38:33] to lead the church the same life
[1:38:37] hallelujah what we should realize what
[1:38:41] we have
[1:38:42] the holy ghost is the same life
[1:38:45] that was on the cross that ought to make
[1:38:49] you rejoice
[1:38:50] it in a different life hallelujah so if
[1:38:53] your patience
[1:38:54] is being tested trust me you should have
[1:38:56] the same patience
[1:38:58] christ had to die on that tree
[1:39:02] it ain't a different patience it'll
[1:39:04] produce the same patience
[1:39:08] oh my the same faith where you say we
[1:39:11] understand
[1:39:12] that the worlds will frame hallelujah
[1:39:14] all of that is the life of the seed
[1:39:16] amen all of that is in here
[1:39:20] hallelujah he said but he said but but
[1:39:23] he gave back the same
[1:39:24] to leave the church the same life in
[1:39:26] christ jesus
[1:39:27] is in the church tonight by the holy
[1:39:29] ghost doing and acting and performing
[1:39:32] the same thing he did when he was here
[1:39:35] on earth
[1:39:36] you received it
[1:39:40] so we believe we had to restore the
[1:39:42] original word
[1:39:43] we have the original life of christ
[1:39:46] hallelujah don't take that lightly we
[1:39:49] should be able to see the same things
[1:39:51] manifested
[1:39:52] that we saw in christ hallelujah and
[1:39:55] that shouldn't be strange hallelujah
[1:39:57] because remember after jesus was gone
[1:39:59] and the disciples went out doing
[1:40:01] signs warnings and miracles the people
[1:40:03] started taking knowledge of them
[1:40:05] the bible said to acknowledge them that
[1:40:07] they had been with jesus
[1:40:08] what did they see they saw the same life
[1:40:11] amen they asked john
[1:40:15] are you the christ what was it they saw
[1:40:17] the same life
[1:40:22] oh my so
[1:40:27] what's our end
[1:40:30] you say oh brother i got i got the
[1:40:31] message i got the message i got seat i
[1:40:33] got to see
[1:40:34] no good
[1:40:38] no good just seed form is no good
[1:40:43] what i really want amen
[1:40:50] that seed ain't no good but this right
[1:40:53] here
[1:40:55] you know what dusk can do
[1:41:04] this right here can satisfy me oh this
[1:41:06] ain't good too
[1:41:10] brother eating in church what else am i
[1:41:11] supposed to do in church
[1:41:14] huh don't we come to church to eat
[1:41:18] hallelujah but it's the same some of you
[1:41:20] starving yourself
[1:41:25] but the only way i can get back to
[1:41:28] christ
[1:41:29] listen to me good now i'm gonna put some
[1:41:31] weight on your shoulders
[1:41:33] if believers if if if if unbelievers
[1:41:36] come in here that don't know god but
[1:41:37] they are seed
[1:41:39] the only way they can get to christ is
[1:41:41] to eat your fruit
[1:41:45] because where's the seed where's the
[1:41:48] seed
[1:41:50] it's inside the fruit
[1:41:57] it's inside the fruit right
[1:42:01] so that's why the prophet would always
[1:42:03] say a dead church is no good
[1:42:05] right hallelujah because it's not
[1:42:07] manifesting life
[1:42:08] nobody's eating off your tree hallelujah
[1:42:11] but if your tree
[1:42:12] is bringing forth life we all can eat
[1:42:15] hallelujah and you know what this can do
[1:42:17] earlier
[1:42:18] this can give me enough energy to get to
[1:42:20] the next day
[1:42:22] hallelujah
[1:42:26] i need to go on clothes so i can finish
[1:42:27] eating this
[1:42:34] but church i want you to think about it
[1:42:37] where is the life of christ now
[1:42:41] he's living in the fruits of the
[1:42:42] believer
[1:42:44] yeah we got the seed i'm not saying
[1:42:46] nobody's not bribed
[1:42:48] hallelujah but is there life coming
[1:42:50] forward
[1:42:52] again what good is a seed
[1:42:55] with no fruit ain't no good
[1:42:59] i'll take this and throw it out in the
[1:43:00] yard so we won't do now
[1:43:02] but if it's planted it's bringing for a
[1:43:05] fruit
[1:43:06] huh fruit in my closing
[1:43:10] fruit is the reproduction of the seed
[1:43:17] hallelujah so when we see christ being
[1:43:20] manifested in your church
[1:43:22] it's the reproduction of his life
[1:43:26] when we see the quotes and and the
[1:43:28] message and the bible and all the
[1:43:30] scriptures
[1:43:30] hallelujah living amongst us what is it
[1:43:33] it's the manifestation of christ
[1:43:35] hallelujah not in seed form anymore
[1:43:40] but it's the reality of the life see
[1:43:43] this is the reality of the seed right oh
[1:43:46] yeah
[1:43:47] see at first i just had the potential
[1:43:53] you got the books you got the tapes you
[1:43:55] got all that you got the potential
[1:43:57] still no good but when i got this
[1:44:02] i got substance i got material
[1:44:05] i got the real deal harley i got
[1:44:07] something
[1:44:09] that can nourish me holy i got something
[1:44:11] that can even cause me to grow
[1:44:15] hallelujah so church let's just remember
[1:44:19] the word of god
[1:44:20] is a what
[1:44:23] and as you eat you become what you eat
[1:44:28] amen so after the service i'm going to
[1:44:31] become
[1:44:32] peach because that's what i'm going to
[1:44:36] eat

[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:44] come and quench
[1:46:49] this thirsting of
[1:46:52] my soul
[1:46:58] prayed of heaven

[1:47:16] fill it up and make me
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:32] i lift
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:40] come and quench

[1:47:49] soul
[1:47:54] bread of heaven
[1:48:00] feed me
[1:48:12] fill it up and make
[1:48:21] amen when do you
[1:48:25] think a plant stops needing dirt
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] think about that for a second i loved
[1:48:33] that
[1:48:33] type that tribulations trials
[1:48:37] difficulties pains representing dirt you
[1:48:40] think about that
[1:48:41] what he said at the end that everything
[1:48:44] that we have
[1:48:45] need of uh by the bat is in us by the
[1:48:49] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:48:51] all the fruit of the spirit is there
[1:48:54] but you know you look at romans 5
[1:48:58] it's tribulation that produces
[1:49:01] patience and so it takes
[1:49:04] that tribulation uh like soil
[1:49:08] has nutrients in it you know if you're
[1:49:10] gonna if you're gonna
[1:49:12] if you're gonna plant a garden you can't
[1:49:14] just
[1:49:15] uh you can't just throw in some topsoil
[1:49:19] it might grow but it's not going to be
[1:49:20] everything that it has need of you need
[1:49:23] you need compost you need manure
[1:49:27] messy smelly stuff
[1:49:30] but it brings it brings a nutrition a
[1:49:33] rotting
[1:49:34] something happens there and it begins to
[1:49:37] grow
[1:49:38] and that's that's those things that
[1:49:39] you're facing in your life those trials
[1:49:41] those difficulties those tribulations
[1:49:44] we don't like it we don't enjoy it but
[1:49:46] there's vitamins
[1:49:48] in there that's going to produce a fruit
[1:49:52] and i thought of the scripture um
[1:49:56] matthew 13 23 but he that received
[1:50:01] seed into the good ground is he that
[1:50:03] hears the word
[1:50:04] and understands it but it doesn't stop
[1:50:07] there
[1:50:08] which also bears fruit
[1:50:11] this is what god is looking for not just
[1:50:14] a dead seed in the ground
[1:50:16] not just a plant he's looking for
[1:50:20] that seed to produce something and not
[1:50:22] just one
[1:50:23] something multiplied it says which also
[1:50:26] beareth fruit
[1:50:27] and bringeth forth some 100 fold some
[1:50:30] 60 and some 30. you got one
[1:50:34] apple seed you plant that it grows
[1:50:38] it might take years depending on the
[1:50:41] apple tree
[1:50:42] four or five years before you get fruit
[1:50:45] but then
[1:50:46] it brings about fruit and fruit and
[1:50:48] fruit and fruit
[1:50:50] when does the apple tree stop needing
[1:50:52] soil
[1:50:55] it never stops but think about it this
[1:50:58] way when does the fruit stop
[1:51:00] meeting soil when it's harvested
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:04] the only time we stop needing these
[1:51:06] things in our life
[1:51:08] these trials these tribulations is when
[1:51:10] the rapture takes place
[1:51:11] when we're when the harvest comes so we
[1:51:14] haven't we have need of the word
[1:51:17] we have need of the spirit and we have
[1:51:20] need of tribulations and trials
[1:51:23] you know and it doesn't mean something's
[1:51:25] wrong or you've done something wrong if
[1:51:27] you're going through a trial
[1:51:29] in tribulation because i want to remind
[1:51:30] you
[1:51:32] jesus as a seed
[1:51:35] said he was made perfect
[1:51:38] he learned obedience through the things
[1:51:41] which he suffered
[1:51:44] he was sinless he was obedient and yet
[1:51:48] there was a maturity there was a growth
[1:51:50] there was there was
[1:51:51] a place of bringing him to the place
[1:51:53] that he needed to be
[1:51:55] in his life to be the sacrifice for you
[1:51:58] and me
[1:51:59] and it could only have come by trials
[1:52:02] and tribulation through his life
[1:52:07] so we thank the lord that he works it
[1:52:09] all for good
[1:52:10] there's good vitamins in that soil amen
[1:52:14] so thankful for that and we don't
[1:52:16] outgrow it
[1:52:18] you know i'll grow that need for that
[1:52:20] amen
