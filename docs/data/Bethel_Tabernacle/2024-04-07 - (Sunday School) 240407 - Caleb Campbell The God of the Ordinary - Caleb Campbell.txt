========================================

[Music] let's just stand to our feet sure is good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen let's all turn into our Bibles we're going to read two portions of scripture this morning we're going to start in Matthew's gospel we're going to read Matthew 1 if you want to turn to Matthew chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 18- 25 and it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while she thought on these things while he thought on these things pardon me behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and he shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which shall be interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from the sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus we're going to turn over into Luke's gospel we're going to read one more portion of scripture this morning Luke 1 and verse 26 Luke chap 1 and verse 26 it's the same story just a different angle here and then in the in the sixth month of the the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in under her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation should this be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this thing be seeing that I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold Behold thy cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her let's open with a word of prayer this morning dear heavenly father we're just thankful and grateful to be in your house this morning Lord with the breaking of bread I just pray that you'd open up your word to us father God anoint this service Lord anoint this speaker father God just give us ears to hear this morning we pray we just commit all these things into you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you this morning as you take your seats I'd like to take a thought this morning on the god of the ordinary the god of the ordinary um this this this portion of scripture struck my heart yesterday as I was listening to a message of of God's Prophet brother Brandon preaches the message in 1964 God is his own interpreter uh before we get into that quote I wanted to drop this in here because it really helped me um I don't know if it would help anybody else in here or maybe I'm the only one but sometimes I don't know if anybody else gets into a rut of not knowing exactly what they need to listen to or what they need to read next um you know this this may help you know when brother George Smith was here he had gave us some some just basic Spirit M maintaining the spiritual life and His Four daily tasks were pray as often as you can read a page of the church age book read a chapter of the Bible and I believe the last one was listen to a few minutes of a sermon and I think that's just an awesome thing uh sometimes I struggle with which year I need to listen to or which book next and and it's just something very basic maybe it'll help somebody here but um I do well with structure in my life and and to with reading and listening and I like to accomplish goals and things so what I've done is in the past is I pick a year any year and I'll just beginning at the beginning of that year and just go until the end and quality is always better than quantity so you just take your time as you go through it and as it comes to listening don't rush through anything um something else that I've recently started is I picked two years you know I'll pick something in the 50s and then I'll pick something in the 60s and I'll listen to a couple out of one and then a couple out of the other and and you know that way I'm getting a good variety there um and then if you're struggling to find where to read next in the Bible brother brandom always takes a text out of every one of his scriptures right or every one of his sermons so you know make that part of your reading you know whatever sermon you're listening to he has a text that he opens up with go read that chapter and maybe maybe if it's a short book like you know something in the New Testament go read that book and then just kind of kind of go off of that um if it's something in the Old Testament dive into learning more about that book um you know sometimes I think we can get caught up in you you know where to go next or what to read next or what even to study so you know hopefully if you ever get into that place this is just a little nugget to kind of bring back to um it's really it's such a neat thing how the message of the hour opens the Bible up and makes it a new book you know preachers say that and that's not there it's not a cliche term you know we're going to get into this quote in here in a minute and it opened this story up to me in a new way and that's what the message does it opens up things to us in a new way amen and those spirits of inspiration they're not reserved for preachers only they're you have anybody can get inspiration in the word amen God can Inspire anybody's heart if they're zealous and they're searching for scripture and they're hungry for Revelation amen getting into our thought this morning the angel Gabriel visits Mary and and he tells her Thou Art highly favored in the sight of the Lord You're Going to conceive a child it will be called The Son of God without knowing any man and it seemed like a a pretty incredible thing and I want you to notice this you know Mary and Joseph were Ordinary People and yet God chose to do something extraordinary in their life amen and Mary believed it and at the snap of a finger and the word of an Angel she said those famous words be it unto me according to Thy word you know but when you read about Joseph you know it took a a little bit of something further and it's not that he didn't believe God the Bible said he was a just man and I'm going to read this quote and as I go along with it I'm going to make some comments but I really want you to put yourself in Joseph's shoes for a minute brother Venom says and God is his own interpreter he said Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and she did now that was awful casual for see it was many hundred years later before this virgin conceived it was so unusual until a good man by the name of Joseph her husband being a just man and was not willing to make her a public example we read in the scripture that a good man in those days how it must have been with Joseph when he was engaged and espoused to Mary she was espoused and in that day to break that it was just the same as committing adultery and of course to Joseph it seemed like Mary was trying to use him for a blockade brother bom says or make him a shield for her wrong cuz here she was found to be a mother not being married only engaged and a trick like that would have gotten her stoned to death it had to be by the law so you look here and any human mind any human mind gets something presented to them and their reaction would be what Joseph's reaction was it's just the normal thought process well you know what happened Mary we loved each other we had a vow we made a vow to each other uh it it was it was unusual you know and he goes on to say Joseph her husband now remember in that time being engaged was like being married and that was a a consecrated vow amen and that was that was at that that time and we really you know we still have that in our hearts we still believe that you know once you make that vow you know that's that's a vow that you made to the Lord Jesus and to to that person and Joseph her husband he says was a just man a very just man he believed God and when she'd look at him with those lovely big soft eyes and say Joseph Gabriel the archangel visit me and told me that I was going to conceive not knowing no man now if Joseph would have just looked back in the scripture the prophet said she do that it was only God interpreting his own word see but it was too unusual now this next paragraph is what really struck me and what really brings out the reality of you and I the people here in this age in this day being like Mary was in that day be it unto me according to Thy word that's what's the matter in any age the word of God is foreign to people it's too unusual God always does the unusual it's unusual anywhere God is it's against the systematics of the world because that they've got the things the way that they think it should be but God comes in and he does the unusual amen the word of God is unusual it's against the systematics of our modern world you know because the modern world they've got things that they think that it should be this way or it should be that way but God comes in and he does it his own way because he's his own interpreter amen and I believe this I I love this because we are a bunch of common ordinary I am a common ordinary people that are like Mary and believe that when the seventh Angels said to us that it is the coming of the lord we believe it with all of our hearts amen and when the church age book said that he it's going to write another book of Acts with our lives we believe it because that's that's what we are we are merry in this day and I think one of the reasons it was such a difficult concept to you know such a difficult concept to grasp for Joseph was because him and Mary were common Ordinary People he was a just man and he was a godly man he said how he was just honest he said how how could this virgin conceive how could this thing be you know put yourself in that position how could these things you know bringing it today to this life how how can these things be in my life how can these how can these miracles happen how does it I mean I'm just a common person Lord you know I'm not a you know I'm not we're not bigname people you know we're just common people but God uses common people to do the unusual things he'll use you because that's what his scripture said that he would do he said that he would use you to do his Works amen so you got to put yourself in that place and we are just simple Believers of God's word you know we we're we're not anybody you know but see you look at at what we're doing is we're looking at ourselves from our Viewpoint and God is looking at us he was looking at Mary from his Viewpoint Mary was highly favored in his eyes not because she had some kind of great gift in her life or not because she you know had the ability to speak great or had this or had that she was highly favored because she was he looked into her life and he knew that she would believe the word of God he looked in your life and he knew that you would believe this word amen we are you know we're we're unusual people amen I'm unusual I'm an unusual person we come to church twice a week you know we spend our free time reading the scriptures and listening to messages you know we read the word and and we don't just read it we live it you know we eat it we we breathe it this word is everything to us we are I believe the manifestation of Revelation 19:7 the marriage of the Lamb has come and the bride hath made herself ready think of the natural type of that where a bride and a groom during I was just talking to Joy about this this morning during the preparation of of getting ready Caleb you know this about to happen the the bride is preparing things she she knows what the what the H the future husband likes she knows you know what what his tastes are she knows and so she's getting herself ready for that walking down the aisle you know because you're not supposed to see the Garment until you're walking down the aisle as as the as the groom you're not supposed to see the wedding dress until you walk down the aisle but until that point it's all about the preparation and right now as the bride of Christ we are in the preparation time we have the word of God we have the message we have what we know you know is is what God likes and what what what his word says and so we're doing what we what we know how to do because he's given us his Spirit that's the only way we can do it so he's given us his Spirit to to prepare ourselves for the marriage supper of the Lamb amen she she knows his desires you know they they've courted and they've been through this stage of getting to know each other and getting to understand the likes and and the dislikes and then when it comes down to to behold the bride when they walk down I remember that moment I just you know you just stand in all and and you maybe have a tear in your eye you're just so happy and you're just there's just such a a beauty to behold amen and that's that's you that's the natural in the spiritual sense what God God is is so excited about the marriage supper of the Lamb he is he is so excited about it you know and that's that's how I look at it when we look at preparing ourselves this is an exciting thing amen when when you're the common ordinary every day reading your Bible and listening to a message those things should be exciting in your life because you know that your groom is coming for you he he he wants to have this relationship so you you look at his his likes and his dislikes his taste and and you try to do everything to measure up to that amen just and you can only do it by him living in you amen I like the statistics I I like statistics um and I was I was doing doing math and you know out of the two message this is just you know unusual and talking about this I I was doing the math and out of the two message churches in our entire County between here and brother Samuel's down the road brother Blue's church is close but it's technically in another County it's in catton County which is right next door but in our County alone there is over 200,000 people living in just this County that's a lot of people over 200,000 people and I was probably maybe a little bit on the generous side with saying that 200 people between each both between both churches if you do the math on that you are in the 0.1 percentile of the county not the 1% the0 one% sometimes you can get yourself so wrapped up in how is this and how is that you're in the 0.1% of just our County and you know our county is a small County in accordance with other counties and with other states and with other regions amen God can use you God can use you don't stay Bott battled up in a mentality that you can't ever be be used because of your past or because of your failures or just because you're a common person that that loves the word of God that has no special abilities or skills but you can be used in the kingdom of God Amen you are who God chose amen Mary didn't have like I said these crazy credentials she just simply believed God's word amen and her life proved it she wasn't favored because she came to church every Sunday or because she knew the statute of every law you know the Pharisees knew those things and they had their own thoughts of how the scripture should be fulfilled but God looked at Mary in her Simplicity and knew that she would believe him and take his word there's such a beautiful uh uh just such a beautiful point in that and she was highly favored because her life proved that she love loved God what was she a common ordinary person that God chose to do something extra extraordinary in her life you got to put yourself in those shoes this morning saints of God God is using you to close out the end of the final age he is using people he's using men and women who are willing to stand upon God's word no matter how ridiculous the world thinks you are no matter how unusual it seems or how crazy he's using Believers to take to take him at his word amen and that's God's plan you know many times I I think in in looking at the scriptures and we can use types and shadows and things to address certain things in this particular case between Mary and Joseph I think sometimes we as Believers can fall into Mary shoes and also into Joseph's shoes amen you know God wants us to be like Mary be it unto me according to his word um willing to surrender and accept and Obey no matter how impossible it seems amen that's Faith right just totally accepting and believing on the basis of God's word alone you know that and that it had never happened before in history it would never happened before it would never happen again but she believed it amen that's uh for healing for salvation for your prodal believe it because that's God's word right and and but sometimes I feel like we can get into like what how Joseph how how Joseph was and brother brand or yeah brother brandom expounds further he says how could this virgin conceive brother bam says he was honest and he sought God about it catch it he was honest and he sought God about it he wasn't quick to throw Mary to the curb he wasn't quick to go out and tell all of his friends and and try to get advice from everybody but God but what did he do he was honest and he sought God what a Les lesson in that how many how often times could we save ourselves from confusion and chaos if we were just honest and we sought God about a situation we sought God about it honesty wasn't trying to prove anything to anybody Joseph wasn't trying to prove anything to anybody honesty was Joseph's heart being opened up to this situation in his life honesty was just being totally transparent with God Amen God I simply need you on this and I love how the in the Bible another story in the Bible when that man comes to Jesus he had already taken his child to his disciples to be prayed for and they couldn't cast The Devil out so he sought Jesus and Jesus said if you can only believe all things are possible all things so he sought Jesus and he and he said that and he lifted up his hands and his first statement was said Lord I believe and his second was help thou my unbelief look at the surrender there Lord I believe it I you know I believe it because I brought my I brought my child your disciples now I'm bringing it to now I'm bringing it to you I believe it but obviously there's hindrances in my mind and I there's things I can't get out of it but Lord I surrender to that I give it to you help thou my unbelief and Jesus met that Faith right there and he said thy son is made whole and he cast that Spirit out he didn't that man didn't want anything to hinder the moving of God in that situation especially himself sometimes we allow ourselves in our thought processes because we're in this bubble of our own selves and our own human nature to hinder the moving of God God does the unusual things he it's that's how God works that's how he's always going to work that's how he's always worked he's going to do unusual things and it sometimes isn't going to fit into our mental conception of how it should be done but it's going to be done amen he was honest and he sought God moving on in that quote brother Brom says and then God spoke to him in a dream and said Joseph thou son of David fear not to unto thee Mary thy wife we read this for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit God had foreshadowed her that's what's done it and he said did you ever notice how God dealt with Joseph there in a secondary way in the way of a dream now we know there's dreams and we believe in dreams he says I Believe In Dreams God's always dealt with people in dreams excuse me but dreams is secondarily see it could be right or wrong unless it's interpreted but he didn't need any interpretation it was God himself speak speaking directly to Joseph because there wasn't a prophet in the land in the in that time to interpret there there hadn't been a prophet in 400 years so the next best thing that God cared for the welfare of his own son was to speak to Joseph through a dream and without interpretation and he said the woman is right that Holy thing which is conceived of her is of the Son of God is the Son of God didn't need any interpretation and he says just finishing the quote he says God does his own interpreting to honest sincere Hearts men and women that looks upon the thing that's mysterious if you're honest and sincere and will believe God has a way of interpreting it to you amen God has a way of interpreting it to you if you're honest and you're sincere and brother vom says first find out if it's a promise if you have a need if you have anything in your life find out that's what that's what the common thing is to do to read the scripture that's why we read the Bible find out if it's a promise find out where the promise is find up and down look up and down scriptures quotes everything find out if it's a promise if Joseph would have just went back brother randam said and got away from the traditions and away from all of the thing and went back to the Bible and find out Isaiah said that she was going to do that amen first find out if it's a promise how do you do that John 5 search the scriptures for them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me if you are not willing to come to me so that you have that you may have life God will interpret his word to you and he is more than able and more than willing to reveal himself to us in a more personal way aren't you glad for that I'm so glad for that amen I know I know we've all heard it before but you are highly favored amen you are highly favored fear not little flock for it is the Father's good pleasure to to give you the kingdom he will fulfill scriptures in your life he will fulfill scriptures in my life he ordained it to happen his scripture said it would be so it will happen amen we we can't underestimate the the power of God moving in and through our lives because he takes the ordinary common right he takes us and then he does the extraordinary it's not us there's nothing about us but it's God working in us and through US amen he go he does his own interpreting to honest sincere hearts and I wanted to end on this going back to that quote you know it's it's against the systematics of the world because they've got the things the way that they think it should be but God comes in and does the unusual you know he'll he'll do the unusual things in our life and his outcome is always perfect amen if we can just remember that God's outcome is always perfect because he sees the end and the beginning he sees the middle all of it amen if we can get our own thoughts out of the way and step on the level of his thoughts and you know the only way to do that is just to have simple faith in God's word and this story had so inspired me because you know so often times I think we can look in I can look at myself look at my life wonder how could God use me or or use you know use me to do anything for him but God looks at you from a different Viewpoint amen God looks at us from a different Viewpoint he's looking at us like he was looking at Mary common ordinary yet Majestic and incredible because she was unusual because she took his she took God's word she believed when it seemed silly and impossible when she didn't have status or eloquent eloquent you know spiritual gifts or anything that wasn't what God was looking for Wow and it brings it brings a whole new meaning to the com things like what I talked about at the beginning like reading the word every day like listening to messages from God's Prophet with fervency with zealousness having having I for me I I like having structure however it works for you but having having a zealousness about it searching out the scriptures in them you'll find life amen first find out if it's a promise amen we are making ourselves ready for the marriage supper of the Lamb I just want to read those two scriptures it says Revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready amen Matthew 13 says blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them amen isn't that a wonderful thing yes we're blessed and highly favored let's all stand and we're just going to go to the Lord in prayer dear heavenly father Lord we're so grateful and so thankful Lord just for the opportunity to come into your house this morning Lord we just pray over lord the the worship here father in just a few moments we just pray that your atmosphere could come and Lord God rid us of all of our troubles and all of our our thoughts of Tomorrow Lord Jesus and just come and speak to us father we pray Lord we just commit the service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you amen
