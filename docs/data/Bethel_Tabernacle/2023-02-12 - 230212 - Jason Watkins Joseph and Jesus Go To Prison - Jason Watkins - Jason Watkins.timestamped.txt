[31:24] good job, Brother G. Poor guy. had to
[31:26] walk walk to church. Amen. [laughter]
[31:32] I'd be nervous, too. Amen. Praise God. I
[31:35] don't see uh any other visitors. There's
[31:37] a number of prayer requests we're going
[31:38] to get to um as we read our text. And
[31:42] there's um a number of people
[31:45] um families out of town uh traveling. We
[31:49] want to be remembering
[31:51] um brother Jason Demars and his family
[31:54] still uh dealing with that situation up
[31:57] there. Should be home later on in the
[31:59] week. Brother, Jason sent us a text
[32:01] yesterday into the minister's chat
[32:03] saying he was very tired and uh just
[32:05] taking the brunt of all that on and
[32:07] trying to navigate for his dad and uh it
[32:09] was unexpected and shock unexpected
[32:12] passing. Brother Joe's also uh still
[32:15] away dealing uh with the situation
[32:17] there. His mom passing away. You want to
[32:19] be in prayer, please, for Sister
[32:21] Debbie's mom. Um she just seems to be,
[32:24] you know, fading and fading. But hey,
[32:26] the Lord could still I mean, the rapture
[32:28] could still come before I get finished.
[32:30] Amen. So, we're not counting anything
[32:32] out. We're trusting the Lord. What we
[32:34] want is um is for everything to go
[32:37] peacefully, you know, the according to
[32:39] the will of the Lord. Amen. And let's
[32:42] just be praying for a number of families
[32:45] out of town and even some out of the
[32:47] country. Amen. Praise the Lord. Sister
[32:49] Rebecca asked if we could pray over a
[32:52] prayer cloth. And I'm going to do that
[32:54] now because I am so bad to get it at the
[32:57] end. Amen. And if my ministry team, the
[33:01] brothers who are here today, could just
[33:02] step forward. Sister Beck, why don't you
[33:04] come on up and receive this and pray
[33:07] with us. Amen. She says, "Um,
[33:10] could uh I'd like to ask prayer. Uh,
[33:13] this is for Ray Readington. Uh, pray
[33:17] over a prayer cloth that I can send.
[33:19] He's a close family member that has to
[33:22] have a heart ablation." Again, many
[33:24] health issues and most of all needs the
[33:28] Lord Jesus. Amen. I think that that's
[33:31] always the the greatest need ever.
[33:33] Amen.
[33:34] Amen. But you know what you want to
[33:35] realize is is that the same atonement,
[33:38] the exact same atonement that saves your
[33:41] soul heals your body.
[33:43] Salv salvation is just healing of the
[33:45] soul.
[33:46] And so it's all the same covenant that
[33:49] was made.
[33:54] Father, in the name of Jesus, Lord,
[33:56] we've seen such wonderful, miraculous
[33:58] things come about even so recently. Our
[34:02] heart is filled with faith as we for
[34:04] this prayer cloth according to the book
[34:06] of Acts. Lord, they taken these items
[34:08] from the body of St. Paul. And Lord,
[34:10] when it was laid on the people, demons
[34:13] fled and sick were healed, Lord. And so,
[34:15] we're not St. Paul, Father, but we are
[34:18] still your family with the same
[34:20] commission. So, we commit it to you.
[34:22] Now, let it be that when this prayer
[34:24] cloth comes to it, Lord, that he'll see
[34:26] his need of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[34:29] in doing so, he'll receive divine
[34:31] healing through his body. Commit to
[34:33] Jesus.
[34:36] God bless you.
[34:39] Praise the Lord.
[34:42] All right, we're going to um um while
[34:44] you're just still seated, let me read
[34:46] this and then we'll stand you up and get
[34:47] to our scripture. Um they can go ahead
[34:50] and put that up. Um brother Brad, we're
[34:52] going to go to Genesis 39, I believe. Uh
[34:55] this is from um brother David and sister
[34:58] Sharon and family. Uh for all of you
[35:02] wonderful people at Bethl Tabernacle. We
[35:05] are so grateful for all you did for us
[35:08] with the memorial service that you
[35:10] remember for sister Jan that was sister
[35:12] Sharon's sister. For all of us with the
[35:14] memorial service they the food was
[35:17] delicious and we appreciate all the hard
[35:19] work and expense that went into it. The
[35:23] fellowship was so uh uplifting and it
[35:26] was nice to meet new people too. You are
[35:29] all a treasure. God bless you Dave
[35:32] Sharon and family. Amen. That's from
[35:35] them. So praise the Lord. We want to you
[35:38] know continue the Lord to strengthen the
[35:39] family and Amen. through the trials of
[35:42] life. There's many, aren't there?
[35:44] Amen. But the Lord gives us victory in
[35:46] all of them.
[35:47] Praise the Lord. Let's stand to our feet
[35:49] and turn to Genesis 39. Now, I'm going
[35:52] to read the whole chapter. So, I won't
[35:54] leave you standing. We'll just catch the
[35:56] first maybe two verses and then we'll
[35:58] let you be seated, but keep your Bibles
[36:00] open and keep it on the screen so we can
[36:03] finish out the chapter.
[36:04] [snorts and clears throat]
[36:05] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:08] All right.
[36:10] Um,
[36:14] sure enough, Sister Phyllis, I'll catch
[36:15] that when I pray over the uh over the
[36:18] reading. That's right. I remember that,
[36:20] Tom. All right, Sister Emily, we've got
[36:22] this one as well. Amen.
[36:25] All right, [clears throat]
[36:28] so
[36:31] I've got a
[36:33] kind of a quirky little title this
[36:35] morning and uh again, I've been uh
[36:40] hijacked from getting my back to my
[36:43] series and not even going to apologize.
[36:45] I'm just going to say blessed be the
[36:47] name of the Lord.
[36:48] Amen. And a couple of mornings ago, I
[36:50] was sitting up in my 5:00 a.m. chair and
[36:52] I opened up my daily devotional
[36:55] collection of readings that I read from.
[36:58] And I never got past the first four
[37:00] words of the very first one because as
[37:03] soon as I read the first four four or
[37:05] five words, all of a sudden this whole
[37:08] sermon just just
[37:10] came like that. And every day I keep
[37:13] adding and adding and adding. And then
[37:14] in the fella in the back in the back
[37:16] office, I was still adding. So I know
[37:19] it's for it has helped me. I know it I
[37:22] believe it'll help you. Amen.
[37:24] But we're going to we're going to
[37:26] minister today with the Lord's help on a
[37:28] title. Joseph and Jesus go to prison.
[37:33] All right. Joseph and Jesus go to
[37:35] prison. Genesis 39.
[37:40] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt,
[37:42] and Piper, an officer of Pharaoh,
[37:46] captain of the guard, an Egyptian,
[37:49] bought him
[37:50] uh of the hands of the Ishelites, which
[37:54] had brought him down thither. And the
[37:57] Lord, I want you to notice how many
[37:58] times you're going to read these words
[38:01] right here. And the Lord was with
[38:03] Joseph.
[38:04] Amen.
[38:06] All right. So now maybe you're getting a
[38:08] little angle of my title already. The
[38:10] Lord was with Joseph and he was a
[38:13] prosperous man and he was in the house
[38:16] of his master the Egyptian.
[38:20] Let's bow our heads. Father, you know
[38:23] the request that we have before you.
[38:26] We're praying for our families
[38:28] traveling. We're praying for some of our
[38:30] ministry team away. Lord, dealing with
[38:32] family issues. We're asking for strength
[38:34] for them. Lord, keep our family, our
[38:36] traveling family safe. Lord, bring them
[38:38] back to us at your perfect appointed
[38:41] hour. We think of uh Sister Linda Tester
[38:44] just now. Lord, still on this side,
[38:46] Lord, but uh Lord, the the beautiful
[38:49] part is that I have known her uh so long
[38:53] in my life and I can say today she can
[38:56] never die. Lord, she has eternal life
[38:59] and I thank you for that. Now, we ask
[39:01] for your special grace for her, Lord,
[39:04] during this time. Father, you could lift
[39:06] her up again. It wouldn't, Father, she
[39:08] could carry right on. We're not going to
[39:10] limit the God of Israel by any means,
[39:13] but Lord, we just put her in your hands,
[39:15] master. We pray for Sally Duke, Lord. A
[39:18] request coming in, Lord, that asking
[39:21] prayer for Sam who's having stomach
[39:23] issues only uh seven uh th this is this
[39:26] has been about for seven months and also
[39:29] for sister Jeanie and also for Susie,
[39:32] our sister Phyllis's sister. Lord, we've
[39:35] been uh privileged to talk to her and
[39:38] witness to her a little bit and pray
[39:40] with her. And so, Father, our sister
[39:42] headed out to California to visit with
[39:44] her. I pray you'll be with Sister
[39:46] Phyllis, Lord, on the flight going and
[39:48] coming. Lord, may she just continue to
[39:51] shine a light, Lord, and and drive out
[39:53] all darkness and fear. We we commit
[39:56] these things to you now with the reading
[39:59] of the word, Lord, and the audience
[40:01] that's present. We ask your blessing on
[40:03] it all in Jesus wonderful name. Amen.
[40:07] God bless you. You can be seated
[40:11] and let's continue reading. Verse
[40:19] three. And his master saw that the Lord
[40:22] was with him, and that the Lord made all
[40:25] that he did to prosper in his hand. And
[40:28] Joseph found grace in his sight, and he
[40:30] served him, and he made him overseer of
[40:32] his house, and all that he had he put
[40:35] into his hand. And it came to pass from
[40:38] the time that he had made him overseer
[40:40] in his house, and over all that he had,
[40:43] that the Lord blessed the Egyptians
[40:45] house for Joseph's sake. And the
[40:47] blessing of the Lord was upon all that
[40:50] he had in the house and in the field.
[40:52] And he left all that he had in Joseph's
[40:55] hands. And he knew not all he had, save
[40:58] the bread which he did eat. And Joseph
[41:01] was a goodly person and wellfavored. And
[41:05] it came to pass after these things that
[41:07] his master's wife cast her eyes upon
[41:09] Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me." But
[41:12] he refused, and said unto his master's
[41:14] wife, "Behold, my master wattth not what
[41:18] what is with me in the house, and he
[41:21] hath committed all that he hath to my
[41:24] hand. There is none greater in this
[41:26] house than I, neither hath he kept back
[41:28] anything from me, but thee, because thou
[41:30] art his wife. How then can I do this
[41:33] great wickedness and sin against God?
[41:36] And it came to pass as she spake to
[41:38] Joseph day by day that he hearkened not
[41:41] unto her to lie by her or to be with
[41:45] her. Now, I just want you to catch that
[41:47] Joseph understood what it took to
[41:49] overcome temptation.
[41:51] He He wouldn't have anything to do with
[41:53] her. He wouldn't hang out with her. HE
[41:55] WOULDN'T EVEN STAY AROUND HER. HE
[41:57] ACTUALLY AVOIDED HER.
[41:59] SEE? SO, so overcoming is not rocket
[42:02] science.
[42:03] Amen.
[42:03] Joseph is showing you how to overcome
[42:05] even before the Holy Ghost was even
[42:07] given.
[42:08] See, so if you keep finding yourself
[42:11] stumbling at the same old uh you know,
[42:13] stepping in the same hole, then hey, GET
[42:16] A DIFFERENT PATH. GO A DIFFERENT WAY.
[42:18] All right, so let's carry on.
[42:21] And it came to pass
[42:24] about the time uh um and it came to pass
[42:27] about this time that Joseph went into
[42:29] the house to do his business and there
[42:31] was none of the men of the house there
[42:33] within and she caught him by his
[42:35] garment. See and he it was a surprise to
[42:38] Joseph. She caught him by his garment
[42:40] saying lie with me. And he left his
[42:41] garment out of her hand and fled and got
[42:44] him out. He literally just ran out of
[42:46] HIS LET HIS COAT GO AND TOOK OFF. SEE,
[42:48] and it came to pass when she saw that he
[42:50] had left his garment in her hand, and
[42:53] was fled forth, that she called unto the
[42:54] men of her house, and spake to them,
[42:56] saying, See, he hath brought in in
[42:58] Hebrew unto us to mock us. He came in
[43:00] unto me to lie with me, and I cried with
[43:02] a loud voice. And it came to pass when
[43:03] he heard that I lifted up my voice and
[43:05] cried, that he left his garment with me,
[43:08] and fled and got him out. It's funny, at
[43:11] his trial, none of the nobody testified
[43:13] they heard screaming. And she laid up
[43:16] his garment by her until his lord came
[43:18] home. And she spake unto him according
[43:21] to these words, saying, The Hebrew
[43:23] servant which thou hast brought unto us
[43:25] came in uh unto me to mock me. And it
[43:27] came to pass as I lifted up my voice and
[43:29] cried, he left his garment with me, and
[43:30] fled out. And it came to pass when his
[43:33] master heard the words of his wife which
[43:35] he spake unto him, saying after this
[43:36] manner, did thy servant to me that his
[43:39] wrath was kindled. And Joseph's master
[43:41] took him and put him into the prison, a
[43:44] place where the king's prisoners were
[43:46] bound. And he was there in prison.
[43:50] Did you just read that?
[43:52] And he was there where?
[43:55] And the Lord,
[43:57] but the Lord was with Joseph.
[44:01] All right.
[44:02] And showed him mercy and gave him favor
[44:05] in the sight of the keeper of the
[44:08] prison. And the keeper of the prison
[44:10] committed to Joseph's hand all the
[44:12] prisoners that were in prison. And
[44:14] whatsoever they did there, he was the
[44:16] doer of it. The keeper of the prison
[44:18] looked not to anything that was under
[44:21] his hand because the Lord was with him.
[44:25] And that which he did, the Lord made it
[44:28] to prosper.
[44:30] Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of
[44:33] his word.
[44:35] So,
[44:36] you know, when we when we come to
[44:38] Joseph, we are
[44:41] coming to kind of a conclusion. Thank
[44:43] you, brother Tony. Uh, of God is now
[44:46] establishing his kingdom in the earth.
[44:51] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and then
[44:54] Joseph. And you find that the whole plan
[44:58] of redemption is wrapped up in those in
[45:01] those men. And so this is the Christ
[45:06] line, the Christ seed line that was
[45:09] going to eventually lead to the son of
[45:12] God sitting on the throne in the
[45:13] millennium. And so, you know, you can
[45:16] see how that to get to Joseph, he first
[45:19] had to get to Abraham and he first then
[45:22] had to get to Isaac and then he he had
[45:24] to get to Jacob and he had to deal with
[45:26] Jacob. and Jacob. You know, Brother
[45:28] Brown talks about how that you really
[45:31] BOY, YOU REALLY GOT TO BELIEVE in the
[45:32] grace of God to include Jacob in the
[45:36] seed line of Christ. BUT HE WAS NOT JUST
[45:38] A A fit in or a squeeze in. He was a
[45:41] direct in the direct line. YOU COULDN'T
[45:44] GET TO JOSEPH WITHOUT GOING THROUGH
[45:46] JACOB.
[45:47] AMEN.
[45:48] AND GOD DOESN'T TRY TO GOD GOD DIDN'T
[45:51] NEED TO SET ANYTHING ASIDE TO GET TO
[45:54] YOU. GOD WAS ABLE TO FIND YOU. KNEW IT
[45:56] DIDN'T MATTER WHERE YOU WERE UNDER WHAT
[45:58] CONDITION, HOW YOU HAD BEEN BORN, WHAT
[46:00] YOUR FAMILY, WHAT YOUR PAST, WHAT YOUR
[46:02] UPS AND DOWNS AND FAILURES HAD BEEN,
[46:04] THAT GOD KNEW YOU AND FORAINED YOU
[46:07] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world.
[46:08] Thank you, LORD.
[46:10] SO GOD THEN HAS HAS WE'VE BEEN, YOU
[46:12] KNOW, IF I if I WAS ON MY SERIES TODAY,
[46:14] I'd carry on, YOU KNOW, WITH TALKING
[46:16] ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW THAT GOD IS
[46:19] CONTINUALLY UNVEILING himself and
[46:21] unfolding himself. And even you find
[46:23] that if you when you see in Genesis 32,
[46:26] we didn't read it today, but he's going
[46:29] to let Jacob know that you're no longer
[46:31] GOING TO BE CALLED JACOB. YOU'RE GOING
[46:33] TO BE CALLED ISRAEL. SO, SO WHAT HAD
[46:36] BROUGHT THAT ABOUT? AND NOW THIS WAS A
[46:38] VERY IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE JACOB WAS
[46:41] JUST ABOUT TO REENTER THE LAND, THE
[46:43] PROMISED LAND. HE HAD HE HAD TO HE HAD
[46:45] TO GO OUT OF IT BECAUSE OF HIS CARNAL
[46:48] SHENANIG SHENANIGANS. HE HAD to leave
[46:50] and run. AND HE GETS WAY OFF DOWN, YOU
[46:52] KNOW, WITH A FATHER LONG GETS HE'S HE'S
[46:55] CHEATING AND GETTING CHEATED.
[46:58] HE'S CROOKING PEOPLE AND GETTING
[46:59] CROOKED. HE'S LYING AND BEING LIED TO.
[47:02] AND SO, BUT YET HE'S THE SEEDLINE OF
[47:04] CHRIST, BUT NOW [screaming] HE'S GOT TO
[47:07] COME BACK FULL CIRCLE. HE KNOWS HE CAN'T
[47:09] STAY OUT THERE. OH, I THINK ABOUT THAT
[47:11] DAY THAT I KNEW I COULDN'T STAY OUT
[47:13] THERE ANY LONGER. I COULDN'T KEEP BEING
[47:15] ME. I HAD TO MOVE BACK INTO THE PROMISED
[47:17] LAND WHERE I WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE.
[47:20] YEAH,
[47:21] GOD CHANGED JACOB'S NAME TO ISRAEL
[47:23] BECAUSE JACOB HAD ACKNOWLEDGED God as
[47:26] the source OF LIFE. AND YOU KNOW, OH, IF
[47:29] THE LORD IF THE LORD COULDN'T BE HIS
[47:31] LIFE, THEN JACOB DIDN'T WANT TO GO ON.
[47:33] [screaming] HE DIDN'T WANT TO CROSS
[47:34] OVER. HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO FACE THE
[47:36] MUSIC. HE DIDN'T WANT TO. HE SAID, I
[47:38] WON'T LET YOU GO. IN OTHER WORDS, I'LL
[47:40] DIE RIGHT HERE ON THIS SIDE. I WON'T GO
[47:42] FORWARD. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO TO TO
[47:45] JOIN A CHURCH. I'M NOT GOING TO JUST TRY
[47:47] TO SAY A CATECHISM. I'M NOT JUST GOING
[47:49] TO TRY TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF. I GOT TO
[47:52] HAVE A WHOLE NEW LIFE.
[47:54] AMEN.
[47:56] AND SO, HE'S ABOUT TO REENTER THE
[47:58] PROMISED LAND. AND THE LORD HAD
[48:00] ACKNOWLEDGED HIM AS HIS SERVANT BY
[48:01] CHANGING his name. And and you see as I
[48:04] AS I WAS SAYING LAST WEDNESDAY HOW THAT
[48:07] JEHOVAH, YOU KNOW, HE THE BIBLE TALKS IN
[48:10] THE GENESIS, WE READ IT, HOW THAT GOD
[48:12] DID THIS AND GOD DID THAT. BUT THEN
[48:13] FINALLY AS HE ADVANCES AND NOW HE'S GOT
[48:15] A FAMILY, THEN IT SWITCHES TO THE LORD
[48:18] GOD. AND THEN WE WE SEE SATAN COMING TO
[48:21] EVE AND HE HE WATERS IT DOWN AND GOES
[48:24] BACK TO SAYING GOD. IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S
[48:26] TRYING TO POINT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF A
[48:28] PREVIOUS HOUR WITH ITS LIMITATIONS, AND
[48:31] HE'S NOT WILLING TO GO ON
[48:33] AND HE'S TRYING TO GET EVE TO REGRESS
[48:35] BACK AND NOT GO ON WITH THE MESSAGE. OH,
[48:38] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, DON'T REGRESS.
[48:40] DON'T BACK UP. GO FORWARD.
[48:46] SO, WE FIND THEN THAT, YOU KNOW, HE HE
[48:50] HE HE HE ALTERS AND TAKES ON NEW NAMES.
[48:53] HE SAID THAT TO ABRAHAM IN GENESIS 17.
[48:56] We're not taking the time to read any of
[48:58] this today, but he SAID TO ABRA, HE SAID
[49:01] TO ABRAM IN GENESIS 17:5, I'LL READ IT
[49:04] HERE. NEITHER SHALL THY NAME BE ANYMORE
[49:08] BE CALLED ABRAM, BUT THY NAME SHALL BE
[49:11] ABRAHAM. NOW, GOD had a reason FOR THAT.
[49:14] HE DOESN'T DO THINGS WITHOUT a purpose.
[49:16] And here's the purpose. FOR A FATHER OF
[49:19] MANY nations have I made thee. AND SO
[49:23] NOW BE NOW ABRAM HAS GOT TO HAVE A NAME
[49:28] ADVANCEMENT. HE'S GOT TO HAVE A
[49:31] SOMETHING ELSE MOVING FORWARD. HIS HE'S
[49:33] GOING TO GO FORWARD AND HE'S GOING TO
[49:35] GET ACKNOWLEDGED BY GOD AND GOD'S GOING
[49:38] TO GIVE HIM THAT NAME BEFORE THE
[49:40] FAMILY'S EVER ON THE EARTH.
[49:44] THE IT'S NOT EVEN MATERIALIZED YET. AND
[49:46] HE'S ALREADY CALLING HIM BY WHAT GOD
[49:48] KNOWS HE'S COMING TO.
[49:50] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS.
[49:52] ONCE ABRAHAM GOT THAT NAME, HE WAS
[49:53] UNSTOPPABLE. HE WAS UNKILLABLE. HE
[49:56] COULDN'T DIE. NOTHING COULD HAPPEN UNTIL
[49:58] THIS THING WENT FORWARD.
[50:00] I DON'T I KNOW THE WORLD IS FALLING
[50:02] APART AND I KNOW SIN IS ON EVERY HAND,
[50:04] BUT YOU'VE BEEN CALLED AS THE BRIDE OF
[50:07] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[50:09] AMEN.
[50:10] SEE, WE WENT FROM GOING TO BE WE WENT
[50:13] FROM GOING WHERE WE WERE CALLED CHURCH
[50:15] AND NOW WE'RE CALLED BRIDE. IT'S THE
[50:17] EXACT SAME THING.
[50:19] THE NAME CHANGE WAS A FURTHER
[50:20] development
[50:22] in the interaction,
[50:25] you know, THE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN
[50:27] GOD AND MAN AND HIS and his plan of
[50:29] redemption.
[50:31] AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY IT'S NOT POETIC
[50:33] LICENSE for a prophet in this day to
[50:36] say, "I'm not going to call you church
[50:38] anymore. I'M GOING TO CALL YOU BRIDE."
[50:40] THAT HAD SIGNIFICANCE.
[50:42] [snorts]
[50:42] THAT WAS THAT WAS GOD TESTIFYING THROUGH
[50:45] HIS SERVANT THAT SOMETHING HAS ADVANCED.
[50:48] THAT THIS ISN'T ANY LONGER JUST IN THE
[50:50] AGES.
[50:52] THAT NOW WE'RE COMING TO A A TRANSITION
[50:55] BECAUSE WE'RE WE WERE NEVER BUILDING A A
[50:57] WALL. WE'RE BUILDING A BUILDING.
[51:00] WE'RE BUILDING THE TABERNACLE OF THE
[51:02] LIVING GOD'S DWELLING PLACE.
[51:04] AND THAT AND AS WE RISE UP, WE'VE GOT TO
[51:06] COME IN HARMONY WITH THE CAPSTONE SO
[51:08] THAT IT CAN COME DOWN AND INVISIBLY
[51:10] UNITE A BRIDE. HALLELUJAH.
[51:12] THAT'S WHY WE COULD NEVER BE SETTLED
[51:14] WITH CREEDS AND DOGMAS OF MEN. THAT'S
[51:16] WHY IT WOULD NEVER WORK BECAUSE THAT
[51:18] STUFF CAN'T GO FORWARD. IT GETS IT IT
[51:21] GETS FIXED. IT STAGNATES. AND YOU CAN
[51:23] SEE THAT IN HISTORY. BUT I'M GLAD FOR A
[51:25] LIVING WORD IN THIS HOUR, FRIENDS.
[51:28] AMEN.
[51:31] SO EVEN IN THE TRANSITION OF JACOB, AND
[51:33] THIS IS ALL RELEVANT TO GET I'M GOING TO
[51:35] GET TO JOSEPH in a second. This is all
[51:38] relevant BECAUSE IN THAT IN THAT
[51:40] JACOB/ISRAEL,
[51:41] THE THE NATION of Israel actually gets
[51:44] its name
[51:46] BECAUSE IT NEEDS A A NAME
[51:50] TO FIT HOW GOD SEES IT.
[51:54] AMEN.
[51:54] ISRAEL WAS GOING TO VERY MUCH ACT LIKE
[51:57] JACOB,
[51:59] but God was going to see them as Israel.
[52:02] HALLELUJAH. THEY WERE VERY MUCH GOING TO
[52:04] BE A FAILURE, BUT GOD WAS GOING TO SEE
[52:06] ROYALTY. Oh my,
[52:08] I'm so glad.
[52:11] I'M SO GLAD TODAY THAT HE SEES ME AS
[52:13] FAILURE, BUT HE SEES ME AS ROYALTY.
[52:17] GOD'S NOT GOD DOESN'T TURN A BLIND EYE,
[52:20] YOU KNOW, TO OUR TO OUR UPS AND DOWNS.
[52:22] WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE
[52:23] AS WE GO. BUT THERE'S A COVENANT THAT
[52:26] GOD MADE. GOD HAD ALREADY MADE THE
[52:28] COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM. AND NOTHING THAT
[52:30] ISAAC DID OR JACOB DID OR JOSEPH DID,
[52:33] NOTHING COULD STOP THAT COVENANT.
[52:40] TWO PERSONS WENT TO PRISON that day.
[52:44] Joseph and the Lord.
[52:48] Bible says it. You read it with me.
[52:51] The Lord was with him. Didn't say the,
[52:53] you know, the Lord thought about him. It
[52:56] didn't just say the Lord was mindful of
[52:58] him. Joseph went to prison. The Lord was
[52:59] mindful of him. Said the Lord was with
[53:02] him. And said it again, the Lord was
[53:05] with him. Say it again. But his the but
[53:07] the Lord God was with him. And the
[53:10] evidence that God was with him was that
[53:12] everything he touched was blessed.
[53:15] Joseph could literally could do no wrong
[53:17] because that's now NOW YOU'RE
[53:20] UNDERSTANDING WHY PETER said that that
[53:22] if if your faith and your virtue and
[53:24] your temperance and meekness and
[53:25] brotherly kindness and godliness and all
[53:27] these things if you can get them to
[53:29] abound IF YOU CAN DAILY DIE OUT AND
[53:32] DAILY BE IN CONTACT WITH THE LORD IF YOU
[53:34] CAN PRESS TOWARD THE MARK YOU YOU'LL
[53:36] ACTUALLY GET TO WHERE YOU WILL NEVER BE
[53:38] BARREN NOR UNFRUITFUL AND IN FACT IS
[53:41] YOU'LL GET TO A PLACE WHERE YOU'LL NEVER
[53:43] FALL. I'M NOT SAYING WE WON'T STILL BE
[53:45] HUMAN AND IN OUR WEAKNESSES, BUT I'M
[53:47] HERE TO SAY YOUR FAITH IN GOD'S WORD
[53:49] WILL NEVER FALL. [screaming]
[53:52] IT'LL NO I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO
[53:54] YOU. YOU CAN'T STOP GOING FORWARD. IT'LL
[53:56] KEEP MOVING YOU FORWARD.
[53:59] That's right.
[54:00] Joseph kept going forward. I mean, look,
[54:02] by the time he goes to prison, a lot has
[54:04] already happened to him.
[54:05] Oh, yeah.
[54:08] We're going to talk about it.
[54:10] We see ourselves in this story.
[54:14] SO TWO PERSONS WENT TO PRISON THAT DAY.
[54:16] JOSEPH AND THE LORD. NOW I WANT TO POINT
[54:21] OUT TO YOU THAT ON THE VERY FIRST DAY ON
[54:22] THEIR VERY ON their very first day
[54:25] behind bars
[54:28] they were very much alike in in many
[54:31] ways but one particular way. Neither one
[54:35] deserved it.
[54:37] Amen.
[54:39] THEY WERE VERY MUCH ALIKE IN THAT both
[54:42] had been done wrong.
[54:45] BOTH HAD BEEN DONE PRETTY SEVERELY
[54:48] WRONG.
[54:50] SOLOMON GIVES US A WAY to to kind of
[54:54] read between the lines and surmise
[54:56] unwritten background and unwritten
[54:58] emotions and thoughts and feelings in
[55:01] the scripture where we we READ ABOUT GOD
[55:03] INTERACTING WITH HIS FAMILY. And we can
[55:06] WE CAN KIND OF KNOW IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
[55:08] HAVE TO BE WRITTEN, you know, THE BIBLE
[55:11] DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO DESCRIBE WHAT
[55:14] WHAT SOMEONE WAS THINKING, WHAT EVIL
[55:16] PEOPLE WERE THINKING IN A CERTAIN
[55:17] SITUATION. DO DO YOU KNOW HOW I CAN
[55:19] ALREADY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THEIR
[55:22] MINDS? BECAUSE I CAN SEE WHAT IT IS
[55:23] TODAY.
[55:24] MAN DOESN'T CHANGE.
[55:26] AND SO SOLOMON GIVES US THIS WAY BECAUSE
[55:29] MANKIND DOESN'T CHANGE. AND SOLOMON
[55:31] WOULD SAY THAT WHAT IS HAS ALL HAS BEEN
[55:34] ALREADY AND WHAT HAS BEEN WILL BE AGAIN
[55:39] AND THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN.
[55:42] SO, SO I CAN SEE THINGS IN THE PAST AND
[55:45] SURMISE THE FUTURE BY WHAT I SEE NOW.
[55:49] YES.
[55:49] AMEN.
[55:50] Does that sound fair?
[55:51] I I know what was going through
[55:54] Abraham's mind when he's God gives him a
[55:57] promise and HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT THE
[56:00] INTERNAL, you know, here I am this age.
[56:02] I MEAN, SARAH TRIPPED UP ON THAT.
[56:04] ME, AN OLD WOMAN. HOW I MEAN, COME ON.
[56:07] YOU KNOW, SHE'S GETTING AN UNCONDITIONAL
[56:08] [screaming] COVENANT AND IT'S ALMOST
[56:10] JUST TOO IMPOSSIBLE. I'M HERE TO TELL
[56:13] YOU, CAN'T WE RELATE TO THAT TODAY TO
[56:15] SAY, "BUT BUT YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[56:17] I'VE HAD TOO MANY FAILURES AND I GOT TOO
[56:19] MANY PROBLEMS AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
[56:20] WHAT I WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME. IT DOESN'T
[56:23] MATTER. HE KNOWS."
[56:25] [applause and cheering]
[56:26] HALLELUJAH.
[56:27] I KNOW THE BATTLE SARAH WAS FACING. I
[56:30] KNOW WHY SHE STUMBLED. I'VE STUMBLED.
[56:32] YEAH.
[56:32] I I'VE SAID IT CAN'T BE. IT'S TOO
[56:34] BEAUTIFUL. IT'S TOO WONDERFUL. IT CAN'T
[56:36] POSSIBLY BE ME. AND IT IS.
[56:38] YEAH.
[56:40] I know what it means for Abraham to have
[56:42] that dogged faith that every year that
[56:45] it kept going. HIS FAITH GOT STRONGER.
[56:47] I'VE HAD THOSE SAME KIND OF VICTORIES
[56:49] WHERE I JUST BECAME DOGGED ABOUT IT AND
[56:52] I JUST WOULD NOT LET IT GO. IT'S GOD'S
[56:54] PROMISE AND I'M GOING TO HAVE IT. AND IN
[56:56] FACT IS I ALREADY HAVE IT AND I'M GOING
[56:59] TO START THANKING GOD FOR IT. AND
[57:01] BECAUSE WHETHER IT COMES NOW [screaming]
[57:03] OR WHETHER IT COMES IN A YEAR FROM NOW,
[57:05] IT'S ALREADY DONE.
[57:08] AMEN.
[57:09] SO HE SAYS,
[57:12] YOU KNOW, THE THIS THIS ABILITY TO see
[57:15] the intentions of man, this is, you
[57:18] know, I I I I THIS IS VERY HELPFUL IN
[57:21] ACCEPTING, you know, natural and obvious
[57:24] things. And you're going to need TO I
[57:26] NEED TO SAY THAT TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE
[57:28] WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO SURMISE
[57:30] SOME THINGS OF WHAT JOSEPH NO DOUBT WENT
[57:33] THROUGH
[57:34] BECAUSE JOSEPH'S NO DIFFERENT THAN YOU
[57:35] AND ME.
[57:36] AMEN.
[57:36] DON'T MAKE HIM SOME SUPER saint
[57:39] that never had a problem.
[57:41] All right?
[57:43] Because the Bible says there's none
[57:45] good. Not one.
[57:47] Not one.
[57:47] That's right.
[57:48] They're all open sore. They're all just
[57:51] uh it's almost like a grave. See,
[57:53] THERE'S ONLY ONE GOOD, AND THAT'S GOD.
[57:56] SEE, and there's ONLY ONE PERFECT, AND
[57:57] THAT WAS CHRIST.
[57:58] AMEN.
[58:00] SO, I'LL GIVE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU MORE
[58:01] SCRIPTURE TO help you with that so that
[58:03] you can you can appreciate some of the
[58:06] surmising we're going to do this
[58:07] morning.
[58:09] AND IT'S NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND,
[58:13] you know, some things that WOULD HAVE
[58:15] BEEN NATURALLY OBVIOUS. YOU KNOW, TO ME,
[58:18] when I when I LOOK AT THE LIVES AND I
[58:20] SEE JOSEPH AND JESUS going to prison
[58:23] together AND I I CAN SEE THEM ON THAT
[58:27] FIRST DAY being very much alike, that
[58:29] they both had been done wrong. Neither
[58:31] one of them deserved it. BUT BUT YOU
[58:34] KNOW, THEY WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH ALIKE AS
[58:37] THEY AS THE DAYS WENT ON. THEY WOULDN'T
[58:40] BE AS MUCH ALIKE as they had been on
[58:43] that first day.
[58:45] DIFFERENCES ARE GOING TO APPEAR AND
[58:48] THEY'RE GOING TO BE APPARENT TO us as
[58:51] mortal HUMAN BEINGS. I'M NOT GOING TO
[58:55] HAVE A TEXT TO READ YOU TO SAY JOSEPH
[58:58] WAS AFRAID OR DOUBTED or had anxiety or
[59:00] worried about this or WORRIED ABOUT
[59:02] THAT. BUT I I DO HAVE SCRIPTURE TO SAY
[59:04] THAT THERE'S NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN
[59:06] AND WHAT HAS BEEN WILL BE AND IS NOW. I
[59:09] DO HAVE SCRIPTURE TO SAY THERE'S NONE
[59:10] GOOD NOT ONE. I DO HAVE SCRIPTURE TO SAY
[59:12] WE ALL HAVE OUR UPS AND DOWNS.
[59:14] [screaming] ELIJAH WAS A MAN OF LIKE
[59:16] PASSIONS.
[59:18] PAUL CONFESSES TO FIGHTINGS AND FEARS.
[59:21] We'll see here in A MINUTE. SO, I DON'T
[59:22] WANT YOU I WANT TO I JUST WANT TO LET
[59:24] YOU KNOW THAT THESE THAT WHAT I'M GOING
[59:26] TO SAY IS NOT JUST ME PRESUMING.
[59:29] SEE, SO YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING uh if
[59:35] you suffer, YOU KNOW, AND GOD COMES down
[59:40] and explains it to you, YOU KNOW, KIND
[59:42] OF LIKE HE DID PAUL WHEN PAUL HAD HIS
[59:45] AFFLICTION and and uh Paul God didn't
[59:48] explain everything to Paul. You know,
[59:49] Brother Bram said, "God don't tell his
[59:50] prophets everything and prophets don't
[59:52] tell the people everything." But but
[59:54] when you AND THIS WHOLE HUMANITY SIDE OF
[59:57] IT IS WHAT I IS WHAT HAS CAME SO CLEAR
[1:00:00] TO ME AS I'VE SAID TO YOU IN MY SERIES
[1:00:02] THE WHERE I want to you remember we took
[1:00:04] the caribou and the bear and and the the
[1:00:07] humanness
[1:00:08] OF THE INTERACTION. THIS WASN'T DIVINE
[1:00:11] HEAVENLY BEINGS CAUSING SOMETHING TO
[1:00:13] HAPPEN. THIS WAS TWO MEN WALKING
[1:00:15] BELIEVING IN A VISION AND YOU KNOW HE'S
[1:00:18] THERE IN THE WOODS WITH THE SQUIRRELS
[1:00:19] AND HE HE HE'S HEARING A VOICE AND IT'S
[1:00:22] IT'S STRESSFUL AND IT'S HE'S ANXIOUS AND
[1:00:25] HE'S AFRAID.
[1:00:28] AMEN.
[1:00:29] SO I I WANT YOU JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE
[1:00:31] BIBLE IS ABOUT REAL LIFE
[1:00:35] AND IT'S ABOUT A [screaming] REAL GOD
[1:00:37] WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND
[1:00:39] HAS A WAY TO HELP YOU.
[1:00:43] YOU DON'T WANT TO THINK OF IT AS SO
[1:00:45] ANISEEPTIC THAT I MEAN LOOK BROTHER
[1:00:48] WOULD MAKE A STATEMENT SHOCKS ME TO THIS
[1:00:50] day the Lord helped me to understand it
[1:00:52] some years ago but it's still an
[1:00:54] astonishing statement he says Jesus
[1:00:57] Christ is in every verse of the Bible
[1:01:01] and he says and if you can't read him in
[1:01:03] every verse in the Bible go back and
[1:01:04] read it you missed it
[1:01:06] NOW WHEN I GO BACK IN HERE I CAN READ A
[1:01:09] LOT OF GLORIOUS THINGS AND I SAY yeah
[1:01:10] that's easy but what about when I get to
[1:01:12] the heinous unspeak able things that you
[1:01:13] don't even you don't even hardly want to
[1:01:15] read it.
[1:01:16] Yeah.
[1:01:17] Of of terrible sins and terrible
[1:01:20] failures and heinous crimes against
[1:01:23] humanity and against God's word. YOU
[1:01:26] SAY, "HOW IS Jesus in those verses?"
[1:01:31] BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE YOU SAID BECAUSE
[1:01:33] YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY LIKE ME. BUT
[1:01:35] HE NEVER DID ANY OF THOSE THINGS. AND I
[1:01:38] SAID THAT TO THE LORD ONE I SAID, "LORD,
[1:01:39] I DON'T SEE HOW HE'S IN THOSE VERSES
[1:01:41] BECAUSE YOU YOU NEVER YOU NEVER DID
[1:01:44] THOSE THINGS." AND THE HOLY SPIRIT JUST
[1:01:46] COME RIGHT DOWN ON ME AND SAID, "YES,
[1:01:47] BUT YOU DID, AND I TOOK YOUR SIN UPON
[1:01:51] MYSELF, AND I I LET YOU GO SCOT-FREE.
[1:01:55] [applause]
[1:01:56] HE WHO KNEW NO SIN BECAME SIN
[1:02:00] AND TOOK ON THE SIN [screaming] OF THE
[1:02:02] WHOLE WORLD
[1:02:04] AND DIED
[1:02:06] UNDER THE JUDGMENT OF SIN AND WENT TO
[1:02:08] HELL SO THAT YOU AND I WOULD NEVER have
[1:02:10] to go. I'm glad it couldn't hold him.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:15] SO SOMETIMES WHEN GOD COMES DOWN AND
[1:02:17] EXPLAINS THINGS TO US, you know, LIKE HE
[1:02:20] DID PAUL WHEN he had this terrible trial
[1:02:23] and he kept praying for deliverance and
[1:02:25] God would deliver him and THEN SATAN
[1:02:27] BRING IT BACK ON HIM AND HE'D PRAY AGAIN
[1:02:29] AND GOD DELIVER HIM AGAIN. SATAN BRING
[1:02:32] IT BACK ON HIM AGAIN. THAT CAN HAPPEN.
[1:02:34] You're in a a body that's dying.
[1:02:37] and and UH GOD HEALED HIM AGAIN AND AND
[1:02:41] THEN SATAN BROUGHT IT A THIRD TIME AND
[1:02:43] PAUL GOES BACK LET'S PRAY AGAIN AND
[1:02:45] FINALLY AFTER THE THIRD TIME HE HASN'T
[1:02:47] QUITE LEARNED THE LESSON
[1:02:49] AND SO NOW GOD IN HIS MERCY IS JUST
[1:02:51] GOING TO SAY PAUL MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT
[1:02:54] for you in other words Paul I know what
[1:02:56] you're going through
[1:02:58] I'm responsible for it
[1:03:01] and when Paul REALIZED
[1:03:04] WELL HE SAID WELL [laughter] OKAY, now
[1:03:08] that I KNOW THAT, WELL, I'LL GLADLY
[1:03:10] ENDURE [screaming] IT. NOW THAT I KNOW
[1:03:13] IT, HE IT'S IT'S HIS HAND ALLOWING THE
[1:03:15] ENEMY TO DO IT SO THAT MY LIFE CAN BRING
[1:03:18] HIM GLORY.
[1:03:19] THAT WAS A WONDERFUL THING. BUT
[1:03:21] SOMETIMES GOD DON'T ALWAYS DO THAT. GOD
[1:03:23] DIDN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO JOSEPH.
[1:03:25] RIGHT?
[1:03:28] SEE, AND AS I SAID, DON'T IMAGINE
[1:03:31] HOWEVER MUCH A SAINT OF GOD AND FILLED
[1:03:35] WITH HIS SPIRIT that you are, you know,
[1:03:39] you're you're still a human.
[1:03:41] Amen.
[1:03:41] And Joseph is still a human. YOU SEE, BY
[1:03:44] DAY TWO, one of these convicts naturally
[1:03:47] didn't want to be there. Can you agree?
[1:03:50] Amen.
[1:03:51] It was all so unfair. I mean, after all,
[1:03:54] WHAT HAD JOSEPH DONE?
[1:03:57] BUT TRIED to be honest
[1:04:00] and decent AND MORAL, AND HE COMMITTED
[1:04:05] HIS WHOLE LIFE FROM A TEENAGE BOY TO
[1:04:07] SERVING THE LIVING GOD. WHAT HAD HE
[1:04:10] [screaming] DONE BUT HUMBLY SERVED EVEN
[1:04:13] HIS EGYPTIAN MASTER?
[1:04:15] YEAH.
[1:04:15] SEE,
[1:04:17] SIR, I mean, I WANT YOU TO I WANT YOU TO
[1:04:19] ABSORB THAT JUST FOR A MINUTE. HE
[1:04:21] LITERALLY WAS FAITHFULLY HAD SERVED
[1:04:25] PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED HIM
[1:04:29] FROM A SLAVE TRADER
[1:04:32] WHO PER WHO HAD PURCHASED HIM FROM
[1:04:35] PEOPLE HE LOVED WHO SOLD him into
[1:04:38] slavery.
[1:04:41] HIS OWN [screaming] BLOOD WHO HAD HATED
[1:04:44] him without a cause.
[1:04:46] Yeah. Amen.
[1:04:49] As brother Brandham says, Joseph
[1:04:50] couldn't help that he was spiritual. He
[1:04:53] couldn't help that. That God had placed
[1:04:56] his hand on his life and made him see
[1:04:58] visions and dreams. And
[1:05:02] what had he done but been loyal to God
[1:05:05] all his life from his youth?
[1:05:08] AMEN.
[1:05:09] SO, I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN I
[1:05:12] SAY THAT BY DAY TWO, ONE OF THESE TWO
[1:05:15] GUYS DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE ANYMORE.
[1:05:19] BUT THE OTHER ONE WANTED TO BE RIGHT
[1:05:22] THERE IN prison
[1:05:24] and he wanted Joseph to be there. If he
[1:05:28] didn't, Joseph wouldn't have been there.
[1:05:30] Amen.
[1:05:31] Can you say amen to that?
[1:05:35] The other one wanted TO BE RIGHT THERE
[1:05:37] AND HE WANTED JOSEPH THERE. IF IT WASN'T
[1:05:39] TRUE, JOSEPH WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.
[1:05:41] LISTEN, FRIENDS, SATAN DOESN'T GET TO
[1:05:44] MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT YOU. SATAN DOES NOT
[1:05:47] [screaming] GET TO DECIDE MY LIFE. MY
[1:05:50] LIFE AND MY TIMES ARE IN THE HANDS OF
[1:05:53] GOD [screaming] ALONE WHO IS MY FATHER.
[1:05:56] AND EVEN WHEN I'VE STRAYED AWAY AND EVEN
[1:05:58] IF IT'S MY [screaming] FAULT, I STILL
[1:06:01] BELONG TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
[1:06:05] AND HIM ALONE.
[1:06:06] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:06:07] I HAVE [screaming] NO DEALINGS WITH
[1:06:09] LUCIFER. I DON'T NEED A TREATY WITH HIM.
[1:06:11] I DON'T NEED AN ARMIST. I WANT TO
[1:06:13] DESTROY HIM. I WANT TO STAND FOR
[1:06:15] ALMIGHTY [screaming] GOD.
[1:06:18] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:19] IF I STRAY, THEN MY HEAVENLY FATHER WILL
[1:06:22] MEET OUT MY CORRECTION. IF I'M GOING THE
[1:06:24] WRONG WAY, IT WILL BE MY HEAVENLY FATHER
[1:06:28] WHO CHOOSES THE COURSE AND THE PATH THAT
[1:06:31] brings me back.
[1:06:33] I'm not here today to give credit to
[1:06:35] Lucifer at all.
[1:06:36] We do not live by the mercies of
[1:06:39] Lucifer.
[1:06:40] Amen. We live by the grace of the Lord
[1:06:43] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:46] David one time was given the choice to
[1:06:48] roll the dice with men or fall into THE
[1:06:51] HANDS OF GOD who loved him. And might I
[1:06:54] say who couldn't stop loving him. Oh my.
[1:06:57] NO MATTER THE LEVEL OF HIS GUILT. AND
[1:06:59] MAY I SAY THAT LEVEL WAS PRETTY EPIC.
[1:07:02] AMEN.
[1:07:02] COME ON.
[1:07:04] THAT LEVEL WAS WOW.
[1:07:06] BUT YET GOD COULDN'T STOP LOVING HIM.
[1:07:09] WHY? BECAUSE DAVID WAS THE SEED LINE OF
[1:07:12] CHRIST.
[1:07:14] OH, HE SAID, "I'LL FALL INTO THE INTO
[1:07:17] THE ARMS OF THE LORD." And he said,
[1:07:19] "Because he has often been merciful." HE
[1:07:21] WOULDN'T ROLL THE DICE WITH MEN. HE
[1:07:22] WOULDN'T ROLL THE DICE WITH HIS OWN
[1:07:24] STRENGTH. HE SAID, "LET ME FALL INTO THE
[1:07:26] HANDS OF GOD, FOR HE HAS OFTEN TIMES
[1:07:28] BEEN MERCIFUL." OH, I WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:07:30] TODAY, FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LORD.
[1:07:32] HE'S YOUR REDEEMER. CHOOSE [screaming]
[1:07:34] CHRIST. CHOOSE CHRIST. DON'T TRY TO FIX
[1:07:37] IT YOURSELF. CHOOSE THE LORD.
[1:07:43] And I don't know, I can't stand here
[1:07:45] today
[1:07:47] if if God is going to put you on a path
[1:07:50] and YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT IT TODAY AND
[1:07:52] SAY, "LORD, I'M OFF THE PATH and today
[1:07:55] I'm hearing this SERMON AND I TODAY I'M
[1:07:58] I'M GOING TO DECIDE THAT I WANT YOU TO
[1:08:00] PUT ME BACK ON THE PATH. I DON'T KNOW
[1:08:02] WHAT ALL THAT WILL ENTAIL, BUT I DO KNOW
[1:08:05] YOU'LL GET RESTORED.
[1:08:07] AMEN.
[1:08:08] OH MY. In a world of such uncertainty
[1:08:10] and so many confusing voices, I think
[1:08:13] that's one thing we can know for sure.
[1:08:17] He knows how to redeem you from sin and
[1:08:20] failure. He knows how to repair your
[1:08:22] life. He knows how to fix all the broken
[1:08:25] pieces. Oh, thank God. Thank God.
[1:08:30] BY DAY TWO, ONE WANTED TO BE OUT OF
[1:08:32] PRISON RATHER DESPERATELY,
[1:08:35] but the other one wanted very much to
[1:08:37] stay right where they were, want to
[1:08:40] guess which one was which.
[1:08:44] Little doubt, friends, that over those
[1:08:48] 10 long years, that was real.
[1:08:52] He didn't go into prison for 30 days.
[1:08:56] Over these 10 long years,
[1:08:59] I can tell you that one of these
[1:09:00] prisoners
[1:09:02] awoke many a mourning and bewilderment
[1:09:06] and despair.
[1:09:08] Amen.
[1:09:08] So, how do you know? Cuz I do. You do.
[1:09:11] David did. Moses did. Elijah did.
[1:09:13] Brother Brandham did. Paul did.
[1:09:15] Amen.
[1:09:17] Cuz remember, God's not even telling him
[1:09:19] what it's about. God hasn't explained
[1:09:22] one thing to him since the day he got
[1:09:23] thrown in a hole. left to die.
[1:09:27] Hasn't explained one thing to him. It's
[1:09:30] a LITTLE DOUBT. THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT IN
[1:09:32] MY MIND THAT ONE OF THESE ONE OF THESE
[1:09:34] BRETHREN cuz they're you're his brother,
[1:09:37] you know.
[1:09:37] Amen.
[1:09:38] ONE OF THEM WOKE MANY A MORNING IN
[1:09:40] BEWILDERMENT AND DESPAIR. BUT I WOULD
[1:09:42] SAY TO YOU THAT FOR EVERY BUT ALSO FOR
[1:09:44] EVERY ONE OF THOSE 10 YEARS, THE OTHER
[1:09:47] WAS IN PERFECT CONTROL OF HIS THOUGHTS,
[1:09:50] PERFECT CONTROL OF HIS FEELINGS AT ALL
[1:09:52] TIMES. HE WAS NEVER RATTLED BY ANYTHING.
[1:09:58] You see, the same former prisoner
[1:10:01] later in the gospels
[1:10:03] walked on humbly when they spit in his
[1:10:05] face and
[1:10:06] pulled his beard and smoteed him in
[1:10:09] Pilate's judgment hall.
[1:10:12] The same former prisoner
[1:10:15] would show the same kind of control and
[1:10:17] faith in his father here in prison with
[1:10:20] Joseph.
[1:10:22] He's in prison with Joseph and he's he's
[1:10:25] never HE'S NEVER OUT OF THE WAY. GOD'S
[1:10:28] NOT READY TO BURN ANYBODY UP. HE'S HOW
[1:10:30] DARE YOU THROW MY SERVANT IN PRISON. NO,
[1:10:33] actually God arranged it
[1:10:34] and God went in with him on day one. And
[1:10:38] you can see that he was with him because
[1:10:39] of all the blessings and the and the
[1:10:41] authority that they kept putting on
[1:10:42] Joseph. Amen.
[1:10:44] SO, SO THIS SAME FORMER PRISONER WALKED
[1:10:48] on humbly AS BROTHER RAM SAID, "IN IS
[1:10:50] YOUR LIFE WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL." OH,
[1:10:51] JUST remember
[1:10:54] Jesus humbled himself to death for you.
[1:10:57] I was sharing this with a good friend
[1:10:59] the other day. We were weeping and
[1:11:01] rejoicing over it. He was not fussy.
[1:11:05] WHEN THEY SPIT IN HIS FACE, he didn't
[1:11:07] spit back. When they pulled his beard
[1:11:10] out, he didn't pull it theirs. when they
[1:11:11] slapped him on one side of the face, the
[1:11:13] other, he never slapped them. He prayed
[1:11:15] for them, walked on humbly. He was an
[1:11:17] example of humility. He was full of
[1:11:20] faith. Why? He knowed his words couldn't
[1:11:24] fail.
[1:11:26] See, and so now you can hear a prophet
[1:11:29] saying that there's there's nothing to
[1:11:31] give you such prevailing power as a
[1:11:34] revelation of who you are.
[1:11:36] Amen.
[1:11:36] See, he was full of faith. Why? He
[1:11:40] knowed his words couldn't fail. He so
[1:11:43] lived by the word till he became the
[1:11:46] word.
[1:11:48] Say he became the word. Yeah, he he he
[1:11:50] became the manifestation. He was the
[1:11:52] word made flesh. He was always Isaiah's
[1:11:54] prophecy come to pass. That's not the
[1:11:56] point prophet is making. But Peter even
[1:11:58] stands up on the day of Pentecost. And
[1:12:00] when they ask him about it, he says,
[1:12:02] "You with wicked hands crucified THE
[1:12:04] LORD OF GLORY. I KNOW YOU DID IT. YOU'RE
[1:12:06] UNDER MISINTERPRETED THEOLOGY. YOUR
[1:12:08] LEADERS TOLD YOU WRONG." BUT DON'T IT'S
[1:12:10] OKAY. DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T FAINT
[1:12:13] BECAUSE IT WASN'T POSSIBLE THAT THE
[1:12:15] GRAVE COULD HOLD HIM BECAUSE DAVID HAD
[1:12:16] SAID HE'LL NOT SUFFER HIS HOLY ONE TO
[1:12:18] SEE CORRUPTION. HE WON'T leave his SOUL
[1:12:20] IN HELL. NEITHER WILL HE SUFFER him to
[1:12:21] see corruption. AND HE SAID, I'M HERE TO
[1:12:23] TELL YOU THAT THAT SAME JESUS WHOM YOU
[1:12:25] CRUCIFIED, CATCH THE LANGUAGE, GOD
[1:12:27] [screaming] HATH MADE him
[1:12:30] both Lord and Christ.
[1:12:32] SO HE SO LIVED BY THE WORD EVERY DAY OF
[1:12:36] HIS LIFE UNTIL HE BECAME THE WORD.
[1:12:38] THAT'S THE THAT'S YOUR PILGRIMAGE. HE
[1:12:41] WENT AHEAD OF YOU TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO
[1:12:42] IT. TO SHOW YOU HOW TO OBEY THE VOICE OF
[1:12:45] THE FATHER. TO SHOW YOU HOW TO STAY IN
[1:12:46] PRAYER. TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BE A HUMBLE
[1:12:48] LIFE AND A HUMBLE CHRISTIAN. AND GOD
[1:12:50] WILL HONOR THAT. [screaming]
[1:12:52] AND YOU AND AS YOU LIVE, YOU'RE BECOMING
[1:12:55] THE WORD. YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME IT SO
[1:12:56] MUCH. YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE EARTH.
[1:12:58] GRAVITY WILL LOSE ITS HOLD ON YOU.
[1:13:02] [applause]
[1:13:04] Oh God. He says, I love this this
[1:13:07] statement. Oh God, let me hold my I'm
[1:13:09] gonna raise up mine. Let me hold my both
[1:13:12] hands to God before this audience. Let
[1:13:13] me live like that.
[1:13:15] How many could say that today with a
[1:13:17] prophet? Raise up both hands. Say, "Oh
[1:13:19] God, let me live like that. Let listen
[1:13:22] now. Let this word so become that me and
[1:13:28] this word is the same thing. Let my
[1:13:31] words be his word. Let my the meditation
[1:13:34] of my heart, let let HIM BE ON MY HEART,
[1:13:36] ON MY MIND. TIE HIS COMMANDMENTS upon
[1:13:39] the post OF MY INTELLIGENCE. TIE THEM
[1:13:41] UPON THE POST OF MY HEART. Let me just
[1:13:44] see him. When temptation rises, LET ME
[1:13:47] SEE CHRIST. WHEN THINGS GOES WRONG, DO
[1:13:49] THEY? [screaming] DO THEY?
[1:13:50] WHEN THINGS GOES WRONG, LET ME JUST SEE
[1:13:53] HIM. WHEN I GET READY AND THE ENEMY TRY
[1:13:55] TO MAKE ME GET ANGRY, LET ME SEE JESUS.
[1:13:58] What would he do? [snorts]
[1:14:01] He was so much in the word till him and
[1:14:04] the word became the self-same thing.
[1:14:11] One of these prisoners
[1:14:14] very often didn't understand the purpose
[1:14:17] of God and all the suffering and
[1:14:20] confinement.
[1:14:21] But the other one had a perfect
[1:14:24] understanding of all things from the
[1:14:27] beginning.
[1:14:30] He understood everything before they
[1:14:33] ever went into prison together.
[1:14:38] This one had been perfectly willing
[1:14:42] to stand aside
[1:14:45] AND WATCH HIS LOYAL SERVANT BE DOUBLE
[1:14:48] CROSSED BY HIS OWN family and thrown
[1:14:51] into a pit to die.
[1:14:55] Of course, God was never going to let
[1:14:57] them kill him. That was the purpose of
[1:14:58] their heart. But God puts a ring in the
[1:15:00] nose of emperors and leads them around.
[1:15:03] Remember, he's not just the God of good
[1:15:04] men. He's the God of all men.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:07] See, so their purpose was to kill him.
[1:15:10] Of course, God was never going to allow
[1:15:11] them to kill him, though that's what
[1:15:13] they intended. God was God was going to
[1:15:15] keep HIM ALIVE. LISTEN, GOD WAS GOING TO
[1:15:17] KEEP HIM ALIVE. YOU KNOW WHY? So he
[1:15:20] could double cross him and let him be
[1:15:22] put in prison.
[1:15:25] So another master HE HE STEPS ASIDE AND
[1:15:29] LETS HIS FAMILY THROW HIM IN A hole and
[1:15:31] then he lets THEM SELL HIM TO Israelites
[1:15:34] and THEN HE HE PUTS HIM IN POTER'S HOUSE
[1:15:37] AND THEN AND THEN SATAN BRINGS IN A
[1:15:40] TEMPTATION WHICH JOSEPH IS TRIUMPHANT
[1:15:43] OVER
[1:15:45] AND IS VICTORIOUS.
[1:15:47] AND THEN A LIE IS TOLD AND NOW HE'S IN
[1:15:50] QUESTION AND LORD DEFEND ME. AND THE
[1:15:52] LORD JUST STEPS ASIDE.
[1:15:55] You're going into prison, JOSEPH. BUT I
[1:15:57] HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. DON'T BE
[1:15:58] WOR Don't worry. I'll be with you. I
[1:16:01] have a purpose in this. I know what I'm
[1:16:03] doing. Your life is in my hands. I've
[1:16:06] got a vision of you. I'm working it out.
[1:16:10] Oh, friends, I'm going to tell you
[1:16:11] something. Today, I don't know whether I
[1:16:12] want to cry or whether I want to shout.
[1:16:16] I think I want to do all of the above.
[1:16:18] And I I I just say, "Lord God, reign
[1:16:21] over my life and REIGN OVER MY HEART AND
[1:16:24] TAKE OVER MY EVERYTHING. I DON'T WANT
[1:16:27] NOTHING. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN CONTROL
[1:16:28] OF NOTHING.
[1:16:32] MY HE LITERALLY STEPS ASIDE AND LETS HIM
[1:16:35] GET DOUBLE CROSSED AGAIN AND THROWN INTO
[1:16:37] AN EGYPTIAN DUNGEON. MY MADE HIS HIS
[1:16:41] HOLE IN THE GROUND LOOK LIKE LOOK LIKE
[1:16:43] THE A NICE LAW A NICE RESORT."
[1:16:46] YOU SAY, "OH, I FEEL SO SORRY FOR
[1:16:49] JOSEPH."
[1:16:52] UM, I'd imagine you don't feel half as
[1:16:55] much sorrow as that brother did.
[1:16:59] We can sit here today in a in our nice
[1:17:01] clothes and a nice building with air
[1:17:03] conditioning and public address system
[1:17:06] and everything working. And this was a
[1:17:10] and we're we're all just a bunch of
[1:17:12] stinkers.
[1:17:13] And here comes a young man from his
[1:17:15] youth
[1:17:17] who had only ever been loyal to God. And
[1:17:19] prophet says even in the Bible, YOU
[1:17:21] CAN'T EVEN FIND NOTHING AGAINST HIM ONE
[1:17:23] little scratch where he tried to get his
[1:17:26] daddy to use guile and kind of tell what
[1:17:27] they call a little white lie
[1:17:29] to Pharaoh. And God protected his his
[1:17:33] father and it it when they called him
[1:17:35] in, it ended up being his brethren. And
[1:17:36] his daddy didn't really have to say
[1:17:38] anything. And and and the brothers said,
[1:17:40] "Oh, we're we're shepherds." because
[1:17:42] Joseph hadn't told them not to say that
[1:17:44] because God wanted Pharaoh to know they
[1:17:46] were shepherds. And Joseph told his
[1:17:48] daddy. Now his daddy's under pressure.
[1:17:50] And so God says, "That's easy. I'll just
[1:17:52] step you aside. Step in the brothers."
[1:17:53] No, they they didn't get the memo. What
[1:17:55] do you do for a living? We're sh We're
[1:17:59] here to tell you something. God knows
[1:18:00] how to direct you.
[1:18:02] God knows how to direct you.
[1:18:05] Oh my.
[1:18:07] Oh my. All this pity. BUT I'M GOING TO
[1:18:08] TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. ALL THAT
[1:18:10] PITY IS GOING TO turn to rejoicing one
[1:18:12] day when Joseph ascends to the throne to
[1:18:14] the right hand of Pharaoh. And then and
[1:18:17] then HE'S A AND THEN HE AND THEN HE'S
[1:18:18] ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND SAVE THOSE
[1:18:22] DOUBLE CROSSING EGYPTIANS AND SAVE HIS
[1:18:25] [screaming] DOUBLE CROSSING BROTHERS.
[1:18:28] AMEN.
[1:18:28] AND IT ALL TURNED OUT TO THE GLORY OF
[1:18:30] [screaming] GOD.
[1:18:34] OH MY. ONE OF THESE TWO PRISONERS OFTEN
[1:18:37] DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND ALL
[1:18:40] the sufferings and confinement as I said
[1:18:43] to you already, but the other one HAD A
[1:18:45] PERFECT UNDERSTANDING BEFORE THEY EVER
[1:18:47] WENT IN. DO YOU WANT TO GUESS WHICH ONE
[1:18:50] IS WHICH?
[1:18:53] Why is it important, brother Jason?
[1:18:54] Because you need to resolve today that
[1:18:56] wherever you go and whatever happens,
[1:18:58] he's promised to be with you always.
[1:19:04] I want to say to you today, you're not
[1:19:05] alone in that trial.
[1:19:08] You're not alone in that pain. HE WALKS
[1:19:11] BESIDE YOU DURING THE DAY. HE STANDS BY
[1:19:15] YOUR BEDSIDE AND WATCHES YOU SLEEP.
[1:19:19] YOU'RE NEVER ALONE. HE [screaming] SAID,
[1:19:21] "I'LL BE WITH YOU, EVEN IN YOU. I'LL
[1:19:23] NEVER LEAVE YOU."
[1:19:28] ONE OF THESE PRISONERS HAD TO FIGURE IT
[1:19:30] OUT day by day as he went along.
[1:19:33] [laughter]
[1:19:33] His cellmate knew the end from the
[1:19:35] beginning. FOR 10 LONG YEARS, ONE
[1:19:37] COULDN'T LEAVE, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE
[1:19:40] TRIED. AND FOR 10 LONG YEARS, THE OTHER
[1:19:43] COULD LEAVE ANYTIME HE WANTED TO, but he
[1:19:45] never wanted to.
[1:19:48] HALLELUJAH. ALL THOSE YEARS, HE COULD
[1:19:51] JUST LEAVE, BUT HE NEVER WANTED TO
[1:19:52] LEAVE. OH, HALLELUJAH. AND NOW LET ME
[1:19:55] GIVE YOU SOME EVIDENCE. JAMES 5:17,
[1:19:58] ELIJAH WAS A MAN SUBJECT TO LIKE
[1:20:01] PASSIONS as we are. [snorts]
[1:20:05] Brother Ram comes in this message in
[1:20:07] numerous places get the people to
[1:20:08] believe Elijah, listen to this now.
[1:20:12] Elijah was not an angel.
[1:20:15] He was a man.
[1:20:16] Amen.
[1:20:17] And he had his ups and downs and his
[1:20:21] troubles like we do.
[1:20:24] And he had his passions. The Bible said
[1:20:27] he was a man with like passions, subject
[1:20:29] to like passions as we are. He was just
[1:20:32] as a I hope you take some comfort in
[1:20:34] this today. He was just as apt to make a
[1:20:36] mistake as you or I am. He's just as apt
[1:20:39] to do something wrong as you or I am.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:43] AND NOT JUST ELIJAH, DAVID BEFORE HIM
[1:20:46] IN THINKING ON OUR WAY. YOU KNOW, DAVID,
[1:20:48] I'M TOLD AT THE TIME OF THE WRITING OF
[1:20:51] THIS PSALM THAT HE HAD BEEN IN TROUBLE.
[1:20:53] YOU SEE, SAUL WAS plotting against him
[1:20:56] to try to kill him, had his house staked
[1:20:58] out. AND DAVID WAS JUST A MAN LIKE ALL
[1:21:01] OF US, THAT HE HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS AND
[1:21:04] HIS DIFFERENCES. AND HE HAD BEEN VERY
[1:21:07] MUCH IN TROUBLE. You know, ups and downs
[1:21:09] are the most prevalent when when you're
[1:21:12] living in the outer court. Brother
[1:21:13] Brandham deals with that in the message
[1:21:15] supernatural. And he said where he uses
[1:21:17] that same term ups and downs. He says,
[1:21:19] "As long as you're walking around out
[1:21:20] there in in just the outer court,
[1:21:22] there's where your ups and downs are
[1:21:23] going to knock you out every day.
[1:21:26] That's what the holy of holy that's what
[1:21:27] the most holy place was given for so you
[1:21:29] could come beyond the veil into the
[1:21:31] shikina glory so THAT YOU COULD STAY ON
[1:21:34] TOP OF YOUR [screaming] UPS AND DOWNS.
[1:21:36] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM BECAUSE THIS
[1:21:37] BODY'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE STICKY. IT'S
[1:21:39] GOT TO BE CHANGED."
[1:21:41] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] I'M GLAD IT'S
[1:21:42] GOING TO BE CHANGED.
[1:21:45] GOD HAS NOT PROMISED TO GO THROUGH LIFE
[1:21:48] ANY BELIEVER TO GO through without
[1:21:50] troubles.
[1:21:51] But he has promised grace sufficient to
[1:21:55] take care of these troubles. That's what
[1:21:58] thrills my heart is to know that his
[1:22:01] grace is sufficient.
[1:22:03] Can you believe that? Because to know
[1:22:04] that his grace is sufficient, you got to
[1:22:06] suffer it. You might even be in the
[1:22:08] middle of suffering it TO KNOW THAT. AND
[1:22:10] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TALKING ABOUT YOU
[1:22:12] AND I OR HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF OF
[1:22:15] HARD, HOT, HEAVY TRIALS. AND YET HE
[1:22:18] SAYS, "HERE'S WHAT THRILLS MY HEART."
[1:22:20] OH, I WISH I COULD FEEL A THRILL IN MY
[1:22:22] HEART. THE TRIAL I'M IN, I WISH A THRILL
[1:22:24] COULD COME TO MY HEART. HERE'S YOUR
[1:22:25] THRILL. HIS [screaming] GRACE IS
[1:22:27] SUFFICIENT.
[1:22:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:31] ALL OF OUR DEPTHS AND TROUBLES AND
[1:22:34] FRUSTRATIONS. BOY, GOOGLE HATES that
[1:22:36] word. My goodness, Word hates it.
[1:22:38] Microsoft hates it. They want to change
[1:22:39] it, but I like Kentucky. He says, "And
[1:22:42] frustrations.
[1:22:44] I got them."
[1:22:47] All of our depths and troubles and
[1:22:49] frustrations are not shallow. They're
[1:22:50] pretty deep.
[1:22:53] Yet, God has promised to see us through.
[1:22:56] That's just as much as we could ask him,
[1:22:58] knowing that he knows the road. As
[1:23:00] Joshua said to Israel, "You have not
[1:23:02] traveled this way before. We haven't
[1:23:04] traveled it." So, he knows the way and
[1:23:06] can point it out. He says, "I can just
[1:23:09] see David." You still you you're good?
[1:23:11] He says, "I CAN JUST SEE DAVID. HIS
[1:23:13] HOUSE was being watched. Saul and his
[1:23:16] army was WATCHING HIS HOUSE TO KILL
[1:23:17] HIM." NOW, WATCH THIS. I CAN SEE David
[1:23:21] nervously ringing his hands.
[1:23:25] David, who killed Goliath?
[1:23:29] WHO KILLED A LION AND A BEAR?
[1:23:32] YEAH. Now he's walking through the house
[1:23:35] nervously ringing his hands. Glad a
[1:23:38] prophet could see things
[1:23:40] and walking back and forth and to and
[1:23:43] fro through his room, looking out the
[1:23:45] windows and watching every little move
[1:23:46] in the bush. For he didn't know here
[1:23:48] here's here's what here's his anxiety.
[1:23:50] He didn't know what at any time that an
[1:23:52] arrow might whistle through the air
[1:23:53] right into his own bosom and you're
[1:23:56] dead.
[1:23:58] And and and I MEAN HE'S HE'S A MAN LIKE
[1:24:01] PAUL
[1:24:03] WHO CONFESSED IN 2 CORINTHIANS 7:5 FOR
[1:24:06] WHEN WE WERE COME TO MACEDONIA OUR FLESH
[1:24:08] HAD NO REST BUT WE WERE TROUBLED ON
[1:24:11] EVERY SIDE WITHOUT WERE FIGHTINGS WITHIN
[1:24:14] WERE FEARS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU NO
[1:24:16] MATTER HOW SAINTLY A PERSON MIGHT BE
[1:24:18] THERE'S FIGHTINGS WITHOUT AND FEARS
[1:24:20] WITHIN. AND WE MIGHT NERVOUSLY RING OUR
[1:24:22] HANDS, BUT MY JOY IS IN THE [screaming]
[1:24:24] LORD
[1:24:26] AND THAT I'VE HAD I HAVE A COVENANT
[1:24:28] PROMISE UPON MY LIFE.
[1:24:31] AND IT WAS THEN THAT THESE WORDS CAME TO
[1:24:34] David as I thought on my ways, I turned
[1:24:37] my feet to thy testimony. See, there's
[1:24:39] where his anxiety was really coming
[1:24:41] from. There's why it was breaking
[1:24:44] through because David had his feet
[1:24:46] hadn't been following the Lord too
[1:24:48] closely and he had allowed a lot of
[1:24:50] carnality and a lot of weakness to enter
[1:24:53] his life and now he wasn't sure if God
[1:24:55] still had his back anymore. God did.
[1:24:59] David was still a seedline of Christ.
[1:25:02] See, so he says it's he says I I as I I
[1:25:08] thought on my ways I turned my feet to
[1:25:10] thy testimony. That's a great remedy,
[1:25:12] friends. That's a great remedy for fear
[1:25:15] and anxiety. You're not given the spirit
[1:25:17] of fear. Put your hope in the Lord.
[1:25:19] You're going to have a hard time doing
[1:25:20] that if your life's full of carnality.
[1:25:22] Amen.
[1:25:24] Three amens.
[1:25:29] You're going to have a hard time
[1:25:30] trusting God.
[1:25:32] You know, say, "Well, I'm trusting him."
[1:25:33] Fine. Wait till the temperature goes up.
[1:25:37] Wait till it keeps going when you
[1:25:39] thought you'd have been out of it by
[1:25:40] now. You're going to have a hard time
[1:25:42] trusting the Lord if your feet have
[1:25:45] walked away from the Lord or even turned
[1:25:46] out at the path. He says it's usually
[1:25:49] when a man is in trouble is when he goes
[1:25:51] to thinking about God. It's too bad
[1:25:54] that we have to wait to get in trouble
[1:25:57] before we think about him. And you know,
[1:26:00] David before Elijah,
[1:26:04] uh, Elijah before Paul, David before
[1:26:06] Elijah, Moses before David,
[1:26:09] at thy word. MOSES WAS A PROPHET. GOD
[1:26:11] MADE HIM A PROPHET. AND GOD TRUSTED
[1:26:13] MOSES BECAUSE HE WAS BORN TO BE A
[1:26:16] PROPHET. GOD FOR ordained that. And when
[1:26:18] he TOLD ABRAHAM HE' HE'D BRING HIS
[1:26:21] PEOPLE OUT, I believe Moses was ordained
[1:26:23] then. I never saw that because THE BIBLE
[1:26:25] SAYS HE WAS BORN A PROPER CHILD. SO GOD
[1:26:28] HAD ACTUALLY ALREADY ORDAINED MOSES WHEN
[1:26:30] HE GAVE THE PROMISE TO ABRAHAM. YOU CAN
[1:26:33] SEE NOW WHY FRIENDS. OH, YOU YOU DIDN'T
[1:26:35] BECOME A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD THE DAY
[1:26:37] YOU REPENTED. YOU FOUND OUT YOU ALWAYS
[1:26:38] HAD BEEN.
[1:26:42] SO HE SAYS HE HE WAS BORN A PROPER
[1:26:45] CHILD. HE HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS. NOW
[1:26:47] WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE at Paul. We're at
[1:26:49] Elijah. We're at David. WE'RE AT MOSES.
[1:26:52] HE HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS. BUT IN THE
[1:26:55] WILDERNESS, GOD TOLD MOSES, "GO SPEAK TO
[1:26:57] THE ROCK AND it'll bring forth water."
[1:26:58] Instead of Moses speaking to the rock,
[1:27:00] he smoked the rock. Now catch this. And
[1:27:02] that was one time. One time, this is a
[1:27:05] one-off. That was one time that God's
[1:27:08] complete program was broken.
[1:27:12] I've always felt sorry for Moses that he
[1:27:15] didn't get to cross over with the
[1:27:16] people. You have to understand [snorts]
[1:27:18] that what he done, I mean, you know,
[1:27:21] because he says Christ was only smitten
[1:27:23] once. We don't smite him anymore. We
[1:27:25] speak to him. No servant of God. Think
[1:27:27] about this. Man, that seems like a harsh
[1:27:29] punishment for Moses. But understand
[1:27:31] that there had never been a servant of
[1:27:33] God who had ever been loved, chosen, and
[1:27:36] trusted with so much, who had ever
[1:27:39] fallen so far.
[1:27:42] No wonder he had to wait to cross over
[1:27:44] into the promised land. This is a
[1:27:46] one-off time where a man that's more
[1:27:49] anointed, gifted, chosen, and the
[1:27:51] presence of God and more supernatural in
[1:27:53] his life than anybody.
[1:27:55] And yet he commits the greatest
[1:27:58] sin. He literally what he done was
[1:28:01] completely break the entire program of
[1:28:04] God in redemption.
[1:28:06] So no wonder he had to wait. AND OF
[1:28:08] COURSE HE EVENTUALLY did cuz he's
[1:28:10] spotted with Jesus on Mount
[1:28:11] Transfiguration along with Elijah
[1:28:14] who also had his ups and downs.
[1:28:17] HE SAYS BECAUSE REMEMBER ONE TIME THAT'S
[1:28:19] THAT God's complete PROGRAM WAS BROKEN.
[1:28:21] SO MOSES SO PAUL SO WE GOT MOSES, WE GOT
[1:28:25] DAVID, WE GOT ELIJAH, WE GOT PAUL AND
[1:28:27] ALL OF THEM ALL OF THEM WITH THEIR UPS
[1:28:30] AND DOWNS. BUT WITH ALL OF THEM AND WITH
[1:28:32] ALL OF THEIR UPS AND DOWNS, YET THEY
[1:28:35] WERE IRREVERSIBLY CHOSEN BY GOD.
[1:28:38] AMEN.
[1:28:39] IRREVERSIBLY, IT COULD NEVER BE TAKEN
[1:28:41] BACK. NOTHING COULD EVER BREAK THAT
[1:28:43] COVENANT THAT [screaming] GOD MADE TO
[1:28:45] ABRAHAM. [applause]
[1:28:47] HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:49] AMEN.
[1:28:49] EVEN WITH ALL OF THEIR WEAKNESSES, IT
[1:28:52] COULD NEVER SNAP THAT COVENANT. OH, CAN
[1:28:54] YOU REJOICE this morning because a
[1:28:56] mighty angel came down and he had a
[1:28:58] RAINBOW ON HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE WAS A
[1:29:00] COVENANT ANGEL.
[1:29:02] JOHN HAD SEEN HIM AS A WHITE WIGGED ONE
[1:29:04] BECAUSE IT'S THE DAY OF THE LORD. IT'S
[1:29:06] NOT THE DAY OF GOD IN THE NEW HEAVENS.
[1:29:07] IT'S THE DAY OF THE LORD. IT'S JUDGMENT.
[1:29:09] AND JOHN HAD SEEN HIM AS A WHITE
[1:29:10] [screaming] WIGGED ONE BECAUSE HE'S
[1:29:12] COMING IN JUDGMENT. BUT HE'S ALSO GOT A
[1:29:14] RAINBOW ON HIS HEAD BECAUSE [screaming]
[1:29:16] HE'S GOT GRACE FOR HIS FAMILY.
[1:29:19] HALLELUJAH. A TIME OF THE DAY OF THE
[1:29:21] LORD, THE JUDGMENTS OF THE [screaming]
[1:29:23] WORLD. BUT GRACE, GRACE, GRACE
[1:29:27] UNTO THE PEOPLE.
[1:29:30] Let's finish up with our prisoners
[1:29:35] just like Elijah and
[1:29:38] David and Moses
[1:29:41] and all men who ever lived
[1:29:44] for 10 years.
[1:29:47] One of these convicts
[1:29:49] had his ups and downs
[1:29:52] every day of his imprisonment.
[1:29:56] But for every one of those same 10
[1:29:58] years, the other one was always up.
[1:30:04] He never had ups and downs.
[1:30:07] Every day, one of them had ups and
[1:30:09] downs. And for every one of those days,
[1:30:12] one of them only had up. He was ALWAYS
[1:30:15] STEADY. HE WAS ALWAYS FAITHFUL. YOU WANT
[1:30:19] TO GUESS WHICH ONE WAS WHICH?
[1:30:23] You say, "Well, brother Jason, it's
[1:30:25] pretty easy because you keep repeating
[1:30:26] the same order." Well, what if I flipped
[1:30:29] the pattern and reverse the order of the
[1:30:31] two cellmates? It would go something
[1:30:33] like this. For 10 years, one was always
[1:30:35] certain, and for 10 years, the other was
[1:30:37] certain of him.
[1:30:41] That's me, friends. For 10 years, I'm
[1:30:44] not unc. uncertain, but he's very
[1:30:45] certain. But I'm very certain of him.
[1:30:48] FOR FOR ALL MY LIFE, I'VE GOT MY UPS AND
[1:30:50] DOWNS, BUT HE'S GOT UPS. HE'S ONLY GOT
[1:30:52] UPS. AND THE MORE I GET IN TOUCH WITH
[1:30:54] HIM, THE UPPER I GO. THE MORE THE
[1:30:56] HIGHER, THE HIGHER. UNTIL ONE OF THESE
[1:30:59] DAYS, I'M GOING TO GO UP AND NEVER COME
[1:31:01] BACK DOWN. [screaming]
[1:31:02] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:04] OH MY. I I I CAN STILL TELL WHICH ONE IS
[1:31:08] WHICH. I'LL BET YOU CAN, TOO. I'LL BET
[1:31:11] YOU CAN. [screaming] I'LL BET YOU CAN.
[1:31:13] NOT YOU CAN TELL WHICH ONE IS ALWAYS
[1:31:15] CERTAIN.
[1:31:16] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:18] OH, I thought about that old song. This
[1:31:20] house of flesh is but a prison.
[1:31:23] Bars of bone
[1:31:25] hold my soul.
[1:31:27] But the doors of clay
[1:31:29] are going to burst wide open.
[1:31:31] Hallelujah. Musicians, brother Tony,
[1:31:33] bring your team back. Amen. Everybody
[1:31:35] just stay seated. Stay right where you
[1:31:36] are. Come on back. Musicians. Don't run
[1:31:37] out on me. I want to make a few closing
[1:31:39] comments.
[1:31:50] want you to just bow your heads with me.
[1:31:54] Sister Ruth, where he leads me, I will
[1:31:56] follow.
[1:32:05] With all heads bowed and hearts bowed
[1:32:06] this morning,
[1:32:10] it's not lost on me that this has been a
[1:32:13] rather unusual sermon.
[1:32:17] Wasn't lost on me as I studied it,
[1:32:21] but I
[1:32:23] I think that I have passed the test to
[1:32:28] verify it to you in the scriptures.
[1:32:30] I think I've certainly given you enough
[1:32:33] indications in the Bible and I've given
[1:32:36] you verse after verse and quote after
[1:32:38] quote.
[1:32:40] This is your life friends.
[1:32:43] Sometimes we find ourselves exactly like
[1:32:46] Joseph. We all love the part about
[1:32:49] Joseph on the throne and Joseph in
[1:32:51] redemption. But what about what about
[1:32:53] what it took to make Joseph those
[1:32:55] things?
[1:33:00] I want the world to see a path to life
[1:33:06] in my life.
[1:33:09] When I meet people on this journey,
[1:33:14] I'm quite sure
[1:33:16] they see that I have my ups and downs.
[1:33:22] But I want to make sure I introduce them
[1:33:25] to my friend who doesn't have any of
[1:33:28] that.
[1:33:30] I may not always seem very certain
[1:33:32] friends, but let me introduce you to my
[1:33:36] fellow prisoner.
[1:33:39] Do you know him? Do you know my fellow
[1:33:43] prisoner? Do you know him at this level?
[1:33:45] NOT JUST NOT JUST KNOW ABOUT HIM. LISTEN
[1:33:47] TO THIS, YOUNG PEOPLE. Keep your heads
[1:33:48] bowed now. NOT JUST KNOWING ABOUT HIM,
[1:33:51] but do you know him? I MEAN, I I GET
[1:33:54] THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM. YOU WERE RAISED
[1:33:56] to know about him, but not just know
[1:33:59] about him, but do you know him? Do you
[1:34:02] know him in the power of his
[1:34:05] resurrection? What about it adults? What
[1:34:07] about it single? What about it married
[1:34:09] men, women, boys and girls?
[1:34:13] Do you talk to him in the evening as you
[1:34:15] [music] lay down to sleep? Do you greet
[1:34:16] him in the morning's light?
[1:34:22] I thought about that as I [music]
[1:34:25] was making my last and final notes this
[1:34:27] morning hurriedly in the back. And
[1:34:31] that's the last line I wrote.
[1:34:35] But I said, "Lord,
[1:34:37] I've known you in the power of your
[1:34:39] resurrection. I got my ups and downs.
[1:34:42] I'm often frustrated and wearied.
[1:34:46] I'm often times finding myself in the
[1:34:50] weeds [music] because I didn't follow
[1:34:51] your word exactly.
[1:34:54] But I can see in this story today of
[1:34:56] Joseph
[1:34:58] that there were two men in that prison
[1:35:01] and one of them never had any of these
[1:35:03] issues.
[1:35:05] If you want to know him today in a real
[1:35:08] and living way, maybe you say, "I've
[1:35:10] already known him." But maybe you'd be
[1:35:11] like me today and say, "I'd like to do
[1:35:14] like brother Brandon." Raise up both my
[1:35:15] hands and say, "I want to know him
[1:35:17] more." If you've never known him, raise
[1:35:19] up a hand. If you've IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
[1:35:21] HIM MORE, raise up a hand. IF YOU CAN
[1:35:23] IDENTIFY WITH WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IN THE
[1:35:25] SCRIPTURES today and what I AND WHAT
[1:35:27] YOU'VE SEEN IN THE QUOTES OF THE
[1:35:28] PROPHET, IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY, THEN SAY,
[1:35:30] "LORD GOD, OH, BE MY COMPANION IN THIS
[1:35:34] LIFE. LET ME LET ME SPEAK TO YOU EVERY
[1:35:36] EVENING AS I CLOSE MY EYES. LET ME GREET
[1:35:39] YOU EVERY MORNING. MAY YOU BE THE CENTER
[1:35:41] OF MY LIFE, OH GOD.
[1:35:44] FATHER, honest hearts, hands everywhere.
[1:35:49] This sermon dropped out of the heavens
[1:35:51] on me, Lord, several mornings ago.
[1:35:54] It was unexpected.
[1:35:56] And I just simply read a prophet saying,
[1:35:59] "God was with Joseph."
[1:36:02] And it all just like it just opened up.
[1:36:04] And as I sat there, another line and
[1:36:06] another line and another line and
[1:36:08] another line. And I I sit there for
[1:36:10] hours AS THE AS THE DAYLIGHT CAME UP,
[1:36:12] LORD, and the house began to stir, I was
[1:36:13] still writing.
[1:36:15] I know, Father, that you love us and you
[1:36:18] have this word. Not only those people in
[1:36:21] this building today, but those listening
[1:36:24] across the airwaves, those who might
[1:36:25] catch it at a later archive, it'll still
[1:36:27] be just as living and alive to them at
[1:36:30] that moment.
[1:36:33] I want to have that testimony, Lord God,
[1:36:36] of the song that we're [music] playing
[1:36:38] right now. Where He leads me, I'll
[1:36:40] follow. That's my desire
[1:36:43] for every day of my life. Lord, let me
[1:36:46] walk hand in hand someday. Someday I'll
[1:36:49] I'll ascend to the throne with you and
[1:36:52] I'll be seated with you on your throne.
[1:36:55] [music]
[1:36:56] Oh, lamb of God, hasten that day. But
[1:36:59] until then, until then, until that hour
[1:37:01] comes, uh for whatever else I have to
[1:37:04] walk and go through, Lord, then this
[1:37:06] will be my prayer. Let's stand and sing
[1:37:09] it.
[1:37:12] Where He leads
[1:37:15] me, I [singing]
[1:37:18] will follow. [music]
[1:37:24] Oh, where he leads [music]
[1:37:28] me, I
[1:37:32] will follow.
[1:37:34] Oh, you want to make a consecration to
[1:37:36] him today? Where [music] he leads
[1:37:42] me, I
[1:37:45] will follow.
[1:37:47] [music]
[1:37:50] I'll go with him.
[1:37:54] with him.
[1:37:58] Oh.
[1:37:59] Oh, if the Lord's dealing with your
[1:38:01] heart this morning, friends, don't be in
[1:38:03] a hurry. Respond [music] to him. I can
[1:38:05] hear my savior. I can hear
[1:38:10] my
[1:38:12] [music] Is that you today?
[1:38:15] Is that you, young person? You hear him
[1:38:16] calling you. You heard him in the word
[1:38:18] today. I
[1:38:20] I [music] can hear [singing]
[1:38:22] my savior
[1:38:26] [music]
[1:38:26] [singing] calling.
[1:38:29] Oh, do you hear his voice? I can hear
[1:38:35] my savior
[1:38:39] calling.
[1:38:42] Take thy cross.
[1:38:44] Take thy cross and
[1:38:49] follow.
[1:38:52] [singing]
[1:38:57] I like these last two verses. I'll go
[1:38:58] with him to the judgment. I'll go with
[1:39:04] him to
[1:39:07] the judgment.
[1:39:09] Yes, [music] Lord God. Are you willing?
[1:39:12] I'll
[1:39:13] I'll go with [singing]
[1:39:15] Are you willing today [music] to
[1:39:19] the judgement?
[1:39:23] Oh, I'll go with I'll go with you
[1:39:28] everywhere, Lord.
[1:39:29] That'll include the judgment, oh God.
[1:39:32] Oh, there Lord to be to be receive an
[1:39:36] abstract deed. I'll go with him.
[1:39:40] Oh, with him [music] no matter what it
[1:39:43] is, all
[1:39:46] the way. I love this. Now, last verse.
[1:39:49] He will give me grace and glory. He
[1:39:52] [music] will give. Come on, lift it up
[1:39:55] now. Me grace
[1:39:58] [music]
[1:39:59] and glory.
[1:40:03] Oh, [singing]
[1:40:04] he will give. Anybody want prayer today?
[1:40:07] I'd be happy to pray with [music] you,
[1:40:09] friends.
[1:40:11] my glory.
[1:40:13] Hallelujah. Maybe you need a
[1:40:15] rededication to the Lord. Maybe you need
[1:40:17] to KNOW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME. DON'T
[1:40:19] WAIT. Don't pass.
[1:40:22] An opportunity [music]
[1:40:23] and glory. He sent this word here today.
[1:40:28] Oh, and go [music] with me. Oh,
[1:40:33] with me.
[1:40:37] [singing]
[1:40:38] While we wait just a little bit now,
[1:40:40] where he [music] leads me, I'll follow.
[1:40:42] Lift it up now.
[1:40:44] Where he [singing] leads
[1:40:47] me.
[1:40:50] [music]
[1:40:52] Maybe you've had a hard time trusting
[1:40:53] him in that trial
[1:40:56] where he leads.
[1:40:58] You need strength today.
[1:41:00] Maybe you've stepped out of the way and
[1:41:02] you need forgiveness today. MAY MAYBE
[1:41:05] YOUR FAITH IS AT A LOW LEVEL AND YOU
[1:41:07] NEED A CHARGE FROM THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:41:10] Where he leads me, I
[1:41:15] [music] will follow. Maybe you just need
[1:41:17] courage to go forward.
[1:41:21] I'll go [music] with him. Is that what
[1:41:23] it is, friends? With.
[1:41:25] You need courage today. The Lord will
[1:41:28] give you that courage you need. Where he
[1:41:30] leads me, I'll follow. Let's sing it
[1:41:32] again, brother [music] Anthony. For
[1:41:34] where he leads
[1:41:38] [music and singing]
[1:41:39] me, I
[1:41:42] will follow.
[1:41:46] If you have a need today, you're [music]
[1:41:48] invited to come.
[1:41:51] me. I
[1:41:54] will follow
[1:41:59] [music]
[1:41:59] where he leads
[1:42:03] me. I
[1:42:06] [music] will follow.
[1:42:11] I'll go [music and singing]
[1:42:13] with him.
[1:42:16] With him.
[1:42:19] all
[1:42:22] the way [singing]
[1:42:25] to trust you just like
[1:42:27] I can hear
[1:42:31] my
[1:42:35] call [music]
[1:42:37] with your
[1:42:39] I can hear
[1:42:43] my savior
