[32:52] i'm going to continue on this subject
[32:53] knowing god
[32:55] and while you're standing we'll just do
[32:57] our opening scripture
[33:01] john chapter 4
[33:05] and verse 22
[33:09] through 24
[33:14] ye worship you know not what
[33:17] we know what we worship for salvation is
[33:20] of the jews
[33:22] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[33:24] true worshipers shall work worship the
[33:26] father
[33:27] in spirit and in truth for the father
[33:31] seeks such to worship him god
[33:34] is a spirit and they that worship him
[33:36] must worship him
[33:38] in spirit and in truth amen let's pray
[33:42] gracious heavenly father we're so
[33:43] thankful we ask that your spirit would
[33:46] just come now
[33:49] just give us rest in your presence lord
[33:53] pray i pray that you would take these
[33:54] words lord that it would be beyond words
[33:57] and that it would be spiritual
[33:59] revelation to the depths of our souls
[34:01] lord
[34:02] take it and make it alive to each one of
[34:05] us
[34:06] help us each to get ourselves out of the
[34:08] way the the cares of this world
[34:10] the frustrations of the day that may we
[34:12] lay him aside lord and just
[34:14] take a deep breath and focus our hearts
[34:17] upon you
[34:19] just for a few minutes here today lord
[34:22] help us give us strength give us the
[34:23] energy that we have need of the father
[34:26] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[34:28] god bless you you can be seated
[34:32] so of course this is jesus speaking to
[34:36] the
[34:37] samaritan woman and
[34:40] it's such an astounding verse there
[34:44] jesus comes and really messes up
[34:48] society and cultural norms and he comes
[34:52] and he sends his
[34:54] disciples away he went to some they were
[34:56] going to another place
[34:57] he needed to go to samaria before they
[35:00] went to that other place so we went way
[35:02] out of the way
[35:03] in order for to hit one
[35:07] rejected person and
[35:10] he he went there and he didn't mince
[35:11] words these were she was a samaritan
[35:15] her background was that they combined a
[35:18] little bit of
[35:19] worship of jehovah with a little bit of
[35:22] worship of
[35:23] pagan gods and so
[35:26] they knew about jacob they knew about
[35:28] the stories of the bible
[35:30] but they also had heathen superstition
[35:33] mixed in with their faith they knew
[35:36] about messiah coming as well
[35:39] even though they had various
[35:40] superstitions
[35:42] mixed in with that and he tells he tells
[35:45] he tells her straight you don't even you
[35:47] don't you're ignorant
[35:49] you don't even know who you're
[35:51] worshiping you
[35:53] and all your people are in ignorance
[35:56] he says we know what we worship
[35:58] salvation is from
[36:00] the jews we have the temple
[36:03] we have the law we have the promises etc
[36:07] but then he turns and give tells
[36:11] this is stunning because he didn't go
[36:12] and tell this to the public
[36:14] this is a samaritan woman
[36:17] and he tells her a secret something's
[36:19] changing
[36:21] something is going to be different the
[36:23] hour is coming
[36:25] and now is when the true worshipers they
[36:28] don't need to go to the temple
[36:30] they don't need to go to the synagogue
[36:33] they can worship him right here right in
[36:35] this place
[36:37] in spirit and in truth
[36:40] he says the father is seeking what was
[36:43] he doing with the
[36:44] samaritan woman the father was seeking
[36:48] her he was looking for her
[36:52] because god is spirit he's not limited
[36:55] to a building he's not limited to one
[36:58] space
[36:59] he'll meet you wherever the true
[37:03] sincere non-hypocritical
[37:07] heart will seek him
[37:12] and we must worship him in that spirit
[37:15] and in that truth
[37:17] and what we find today is a similar
[37:20] situation
[37:21] in america what is it
[37:24] what is it people don't know god
[37:28] they have a concept about god
[37:31] they have an idea about god today god
[37:35] is a grandfather god is
[37:40] oh it's okay i mean i don't like you to
[37:42] sin
[37:43] but it's okay if you do i just kind of
[37:46] wink at
[37:47] wink at your sinning just go on sinning
[37:49] because
[37:50] i'm so merciful that any sinner off the
[37:53] street is
[37:54] is saved it doesn't matter how much he
[37:56] drinks how much he smokes
[37:58] how much he curses god he has his
[38:01] funeral
[38:02] and now he's in heaven
[38:05] because he was baptized as an infant in
[38:08] the lutheran church or the catholic
[38:10] church or
[38:11] some nonsense and this is the god that's
[38:15] held over the people
[38:16] god is love god is mercy
[38:20] that's true that's absolute truth and we
[38:23] hang our
[38:24] souls on that but without presenting
[38:27] the other part of it that what is why
[38:30] does he need to be merciful
[38:32] god is just merciful and he just hands
[38:35] out mercy
[38:35] to everyone that's not how it works
[38:40] again we we spoke before we know god
[38:43] as he reveals himself in his word
[38:47] and also through the means which he has
[38:50] chosen
[38:51] to reveal himself through the ministry
[38:55] of the word that he's anointed and
[38:58] called and sent forth through his mess
[38:59] his chosen messengers he reveals himself
[39:03] that's what he's declared all through
[39:05] history we don't
[39:07] know him as our heart knows him our
[39:10] heart
[39:10] is deceitful
[39:14] we don't know him as popular culture
[39:16] declares him to be
[39:18] on the hallmark channel at christmas
[39:20] time
[39:22] we know god as he's revealed
[39:25] in his word and we don't just take the
[39:28] part of the word that we like
[39:30] that's easy easy to hear that's
[39:34] that tickles our senses if we do that
[39:37] we're not
[39:38] we don't know god we're not seeking god
[39:40] and what is
[39:41] what is what is it when we pervert the
[39:44] truth of god
[39:46] it becomes idolatry it's not just
[39:49] a little mistake it's not just well
[39:53] they're a little off on their theology
[39:55] but their heart is right
[39:57] um god is a god of his word
[40:01] god is just
[40:04] god will take vengeance on sin
[40:08] the the the bible says the wages of sin
[40:13] is death that's not a joke that's not
[40:16] hyperbole
[40:17] that's not a a punishment like parents
[40:20] will give out
[40:20] you you promise some huge terrible
[40:24] punishment to your child hoping to scare
[40:26] them out of that behavior so when you
[40:28] have to deal with
[40:29] giving them a spanking or whatever it is
[40:33] god is not doing that he is
[40:36] he says what he means and he means what
[40:38] he says
[40:40] and he is faithful to his word fulfill
[40:42] it
[40:43] when we sin we die the day
[40:46] you eat thereof that day you
[40:50] die brother branham in the token 1964
[40:53] says god is a good god that is true
[40:56] but he is a god of anger too he's a god
[40:59] of judgment he's a god of wrath
[41:00] we fail to get that you make him so good
[41:03] till you make him some old dodie grandpa
[41:06] he's not no dodie grandfather he's
[41:08] almighty god
[41:09] and he don't have no grandchildren
[41:15] think about these things he brought his
[41:17] judgment upon
[41:19] all of creation all of creation was made
[41:22] subject to vanity
[41:24] when adam sinned and it was not for
[41:27] multiple sins it was for
[41:29] one sin for one sin
[41:32] he cursed canaan in all his generations
[41:36] for one sin moses was excluded from the
[41:38] promised land
[41:39] for one sin elisha's servant was struck
[41:42] with leprosy
[41:44] for one sin usia was struck with leprosy
[41:48] and lived with it the rest of his life
[41:53] for one sin ananias and sapphira were
[41:55] struck down dead
[41:58] god commands saul to utterly destroy all
[42:02] the men women children animals and
[42:05] all possessions of the amalekites
[42:08] and he does most of that
[42:11] but not all of it and because of it god
[42:15] removes the kingdom from saul
[42:19] removes the anointing removes all of
[42:21] that from him
[42:22] korah dathan and abyram rebelled against
[42:25] moses
[42:26] and god didn't just say you're going to
[42:28] die one day and
[42:30] be judged he literally opened up the
[42:32] earth
[42:33] and it swallowed and they went alive
[42:36] into hell
[42:40] this is the god that declares himself
[42:44] in the bible
[42:47] it might be hard to hear it might be
[42:49] difficult
[42:51] to hear but if we don't hear it
[42:54] we don't understand who god is
[42:58] we don't understand the gospel we don't
[43:00] understand
[43:01] his mercy we don't understand what we
[43:04] are saved from
[43:05] because what are we we're saved from
[43:07] something
[43:08] the wrath of god
[43:12] luke 13 1-5
[43:16] that were present at that season some
[43:18] that told him of the galileans whose
[43:20] blood pilate had mingled with their
[43:23] sacrifices
[43:24] and jesus answered said unto them
[43:26] supposedly that these galileans were
[43:29] sinners
[43:30] above all the galileans because they
[43:32] suffered such things
[43:34] i tell you nay but except you repent ye
[43:38] shall all
[43:39] likewise perish for those eighteen upon
[43:42] whom the tower and siloam
[43:44] fell and slew them think he that they
[43:47] were sinners above all men that dwelt in
[43:49] jerusalem
[43:50] i tell you nay but except ye repent ye
[43:53] shall all likewise
[43:55] perish he didn't mince any words
[43:59] he spoke it just as it is
[44:03] that's a fact they died a terrible death
[44:06] and because they died a terrible death
[44:09] everyone assumed
[44:10] these were sinners and this was god's
[44:13] wrath poured out on
[44:14] upon them and jesus is saying your
[44:17] thinking is false
[44:19] you deserve the same death
[44:23] you we all deserve the same death don't
[44:26] get it wrong
[44:27] not just them you and i deserve the same
[44:30] death
[44:32] don't don't don't misunderstand this
[44:35] applies to you and me this is what we're
[44:37] worthy of
[44:38] if you want to get what you deserve this
[44:42] is what you and i deserve god's wrath
[44:45] and judgment
[44:51] we all we all sin
[44:54] and we are not struck dead instantly are
[44:57] we
[44:59] the whole world does the same and
[45:02] because of this they begin to take
[45:04] for granted the fact that with one sin
[45:07] we deserve to be
[45:09] struck dead immediately we take one more
[45:12] breath
[45:15] by god's purpose by god's will by god's
[45:18] mercy anyone that's still
[45:21] alive on this earth today after they've
[45:24] sinned
[45:25] god's mercy is still there for them
[45:28] what what do most do they
[45:32] trample it under their feet they
[45:35] they despise it they say they don't want
[45:38] it
[45:39] because how do they say they don't want
[45:41] it of course everyone at the end of the
[45:43] road says they want
[45:44] the mercy of god but god has a
[45:47] he has an offer for mercy and he has a
[45:50] way to receive mercy
[45:52] and the world doesn't want it that way
[45:55] they want to live any way they want and
[45:56] then
[45:58] get god's mercy at the very end and it
[46:01] doesn't work that way
[46:08] again this concept that
[46:11] we all have especially an american
[46:13] mindset
[46:14] we all think that we deserve mercy i was
[46:17] a good enough person
[46:19] that i deserve mercy mercy is not
[46:22] something
[46:23] you deserve it is the opposite of what
[46:26] you deserve mercy is god
[46:29] saying i freely release you from the
[46:32] punishment that you so richly deserve
[46:36] deuteronomy 32 39 through 42 see now
[46:40] that i even i
[46:41] am he and there is no god with me i kill
[46:44] and i make alive
[46:46] i wound and i heal neither is there any
[46:48] that can deliver out of my hand
[46:50] for i lift up my hand to heaven and say
[46:52] i live forever
[46:53] if i wet my glittering sword and my hand
[46:55] take hold on judgment i will render
[46:57] vengeance to mine enemies and will
[46:59] reward them
[47:00] that hate me i will make mine arrows
[47:02] drunk with blood and my sword shall
[47:04] devour flesh
[47:05] and that with the blood of the slain and
[47:07] of the captives from the beginning
[47:09] of revenges upon the enemy
[47:13] this is speaking of god's wrath
[47:17] and his wrath is eternal
[47:20] and his hatred of sin is
[47:24] eternal i should say let me put it this
[47:26] way god's
[47:27] wrath is his eternal hatred for sin
[47:33] his wrath only lasts for a moment i said
[47:35] i mis spoke
[47:36] said that wrong his wrath says his last
[47:40] only for a moment
[47:41] his wrath is not eternal but his hatred
[47:45] of sin
[47:46] is eternal
[47:49] his wrath is not a malignant
[47:53] or malicious anger poured out without
[47:56] consideration
[47:58] as though he's reacting to various
[48:01] outside forces
[48:02] that cause him personal damage we we
[48:04] sometimes get that misconception
[48:07] israel sins and moses
[48:10] moses is there and what he declares to
[48:12] moses my anger is burning against them
[48:14] i'm going to destroy them
[48:16] and so we get this picture that all of
[48:18] us god's just i'm so mad at you
[48:22] no that's not what's happening
[48:25] number one god is working in moses's
[48:28] life
[48:29] he's he is angry with them he's full
[48:32] he's full of anger his
[48:34] his anger was hot against them but it
[48:37] wasn't
[48:37] a reaction it was
[48:41] he saw them sin he knew that they were
[48:44] going to sin
[48:45] before the world was ever created but he
[48:47] saw them sin
[48:49] and he begins to act upon his wrath
[48:52] against their sin
[48:53] why because he wants moses to step in
[48:57] and request mercy why does he want moses
[49:00] to step in and request mercy
[49:02] because he's going to have a son that's
[49:05] born that will be the mediator
[49:07] and moses was a type of that
[49:10] so rather than it being god's just
[49:12] really mad
[49:13] and he's just oh i'm gonna beat you guys
[49:17] up
[49:17] no it's god purposed planned
[49:21] set things forward spoke to moses in
[49:24] such a way that would elicit
[49:25] moses to say lord
[49:30] take me don't take them
[49:34] why because he had it in his plan to put
[49:36] forth a type right there
[49:37] in the bible for us to see what the
[49:40] messiah would be
[49:41] all about and what kind of attitude that
[49:44] you and i should have
[49:45] towards sinners towards people around us
[49:52] god's wrath is his just equity or his
[49:55] just
[49:56] payment that he has towards sin and evil
[50:01] god is holy and so because god is holy
[50:05] he's morally perfect
[50:09] and his law the same
[50:13] he set forth the ten commandments
[50:16] and his expectation is that we keep them
[50:19] perfectly
[50:20] and when we don't we sin that's sin
[50:25] and when we sin when we go against
[50:28] god's moral perfections the result is
[50:32] his wrath when we sin
[50:38] we deserve death we deserve wrath
[50:41] that's what it's just the natural
[50:43] following one plus one equals two
[50:45] when you put forth an equation that's
[50:47] the depth of my
[50:49] equations i'm not up on algebra anymore
[50:53] or anything
[50:54] but some of you are good mathematicians
[50:57] and
[50:57] could write out a in-depth equations
[51:00] with a lot of steps
[51:01] but when you do this equation it always
[51:04] it always works out
[51:06] to this answer at the end the same thing
[51:08] is with god's
[51:10] god's uh god's word god's law
[51:13] because god is holy his law we break his
[51:16] law
[51:17] it equals this which is his punishment
[51:21] it always follows god is not wrathful
[51:24] because he's somehow choosing to be
[51:26] malignant
[51:27] it's a result of the actions
[51:30] of his creation
[51:36] god's anger is an attribute that is a
[51:38] result of his holy character
[51:41] meeting the with the evil character of
[51:43] his creation
[51:45] god's holiness activated against sin
[51:50] again we we go through these stories in
[51:52] the scripture
[51:53] the flood is a nice little story we have
[51:56] that we tell our children
[51:57] it's a bathtub like device that's filled
[52:00] with
[52:01] animals and it's just a really fun story
[52:03] about
[52:05] animals except that it's not
[52:10] and somehow the devil has inserted this
[52:13] into so many
[52:14] of children's books that it's a cute
[52:16] little story
[52:17] it's not a cute little story
[52:20] it should it should scare us to death
[52:24] this is god's wrath he literally
[52:28] destroys the whole
[52:29] everyone that's in existence and
[52:32] everything that's in existence on the
[52:33] planet
[52:35] up until that point with only a few that
[52:38] he saves to repopulate the earth
[52:40] billions of people perished in the flood
[52:44] amen why did they perish in the flood
[52:47] because god's holiness
[52:49] became active against wickedness we're
[52:52] living in an
[52:53] hour where his mercy is still extending
[52:56] his mercy is still there but there's
[53:00] coming a day when his fire
[53:02] it's not going to be water it's going to
[53:04] be fire that comes out
[53:07] and it's going to destroy just about
[53:09] everything
[53:12] romans 1 18 says this for the wrath of
[53:14] god is revealed from heaven
[53:16] against all ungodliness and
[53:18] unrighteousness of men
[53:20] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[53:24] god's wrath is revealed it's already
[53:27] revealed it's not
[53:29] in the future going to be it's already
[53:31] revealed and you can read that in
[53:33] in romans 1 18 through
[53:37] 32 verse 32 says who knowing the
[53:39] judgment of god
[53:40] that they which commit such things are
[53:42] worthy of death
[53:44] not only do the same but have pleasure
[53:46] in them
[53:47] that do them we've come to such an hour
[53:51] once again that wickedness is celebrated
[53:55] they have pleasure
[53:58] it's a good thing that which is evil is
[54:00] spoken of as
[54:02] a positive people are celebrated on the
[54:05] front of magazines as heroes
[54:07] for being perverts for for going against
[54:11] the will of god that's
[54:12] that's the state that we're in today and
[54:16] the wrath of god is already being
[54:19] revealed in fact in the fact that he's
[54:20] given them
[54:21] up to their lusts he said okay
[54:25] i was i was extending my mercy i was
[54:28] preventing
[54:29] you from doing these things but now i le
[54:31] i'll take my hand off
[54:32] you can do any i'll let you do any
[54:34] perversion that you want to do
[54:36] and they do and then what do they do
[54:39] they rejoice
[54:40] and they celebrate one another that's
[54:42] what this verse says that they do
[54:47] in all of this we have to be careful not
[54:49] to devise
[54:50] a picture of our god
[54:54] in our soul that's not based on
[54:56] scripture number one is
[54:58] people can take god being a wrathful god
[55:02] and totally use that in in a way
[55:06] to bring forth legalism to bring forth
[55:10] all kinds of manipulation control
[55:13] bad attitudes that's not what this is
[55:16] about
[55:18] this is about understanding who god is
[55:20] and the power
[55:22] of the gospel of jesus christ if we
[55:25] that's a perversion of understanding the
[55:28] wrath of god people will say that
[55:30] something bad happened to me because it
[55:31] was god was just angry at me
[55:35] and it's people say that i've i've heard
[55:38] it on the missions field i've heard
[55:41] even immature believers say that
[55:44] and it's completely
[55:47] perversion of understanding the wrath of
[55:51] god
[55:53] when you're when when you're a believer
[55:56] the wrath of god has been swallowed up
[55:59] in christ
[56:00] he's not pouring out his wrath on you if
[56:03] you experience
[56:04] something difficult in your life
[56:07] as a born-again spirit-filled person
[56:11] you're you're not experiencing the wrath
[56:13] of god you're
[56:16] you're experiencing his love
[56:19] in the form of what correction
[56:23] but not even that sometimes it's not
[56:24] even correction
[56:26] some sometimes it's simply you need this
[56:29] experience in your life to make you more
[56:32] like jesus christ
[56:33] has nothing to do with correction and
[56:35] it's simply that
[56:37] this is what you need to be more like
[56:39] him
[56:40] he was christ was perfected through the
[56:43] things the things that he suffered
[56:45] it wasn't correction it wasn't
[56:48] correction
[56:48] it was simply this is necessary for you
[56:51] to be in that state of maturity
[56:53] to go to gethsemane and calvary
[56:58] so don't get this misunderstood when we
[57:00] talk about the wrath of god
[57:03] rightly divide the word don't let the
[57:05] devil
[57:06] twist the scriptures the wrath of god
[57:10] is real the wrath of god
[57:13] is what we deserve
[57:16] but remember that was that's the blood
[57:19] of christ
[57:20] solves that completely we've passed
[57:24] for past from death unto life not
[57:27] because of anything that we've done
[57:29] but because of the blood of jesus christ
[57:31] and the gift
[57:33] that god gives to us which is faith
[57:37] faith in him alone so don't get it
[57:39] confused don't get it mixed up
[57:42] we must understand the wrath of god
[57:45] but we can't we rightly divide the word
[57:48] of truth
[57:54] the next one is it to me is so
[57:56] interesting the
[57:58] the one of his attributes speaking of
[58:00] the jealousy
[58:02] of god it's one we don't think about
[58:04] often
[58:06] but look at what he says about himself
[58:08] in
[58:09] exodus verse
[58:12] exodus 20 verse 5
[58:16] he says thou shalt not bow thy self down
[58:19] thyself to them nor serve them for i the
[58:22] lord thy god
[58:23] am a jealous god visiting the iniquity
[58:26] of the fathers upon the children unto
[58:28] the third and fourth generation of them
[58:30] that hate me
[58:31] so he says i'm a jealous god
[58:34] and then exodus 34 14.
[58:39] it says for thou shalt worship no other
[58:41] god
[58:42] for the lord whose name is jealous
[58:45] is a jealous god so here he's
[58:48] he says this is my name
[58:52] this is one of the why don't we have
[58:53] this as one of the compound names of
[58:55] jehovah
[58:56] in the old testament
[59:01] but he says my name is jealous
[59:06] in other words my character
[59:09] and my reputation is
[59:13] jealous because your name represents who
[59:16] you are right
[59:17] so here his name is jealous
[59:23] in our day and age jealousy is always
[59:26] associated with something
[59:28] negative right in our day
[59:32] and age jealous speaks of suspicious
[59:35] apprehensive of rivalship uneasy through
[59:38] fear that another has withdrawn or may
[59:39] withdraw from one
[59:41] the affections of a person he loves or
[59:44] enjoy some
[59:44] good which he desires to obtain etc
[59:49] so it's it's like a suspicion a
[59:52] suspicious type of thing and it's always
[59:56] negative and usually for us
[59:59] the characteristic of jealousy is it's
[1:00:02] a soul-robbing destructive character
[1:00:06] flaw
[1:00:07] that literally ruins everything in its
[1:00:09] path right
[1:00:12] but god not only says he's jealous but
[1:00:15] he again says his name
[1:00:17] is jealous so we need to be able to
[1:00:20] reconcile these two different things
[1:00:24] because we can't throw out the scripture
[1:00:26] because our culture says
[1:00:28] this thing is is not right and you'll
[1:00:31] even see
[1:00:32] people who are atheists railing against
[1:00:35] you know what kind of god says he's a
[1:00:37] jealous god
[1:00:38] this is just terrible
[1:00:43] but god delights in being jealous he's
[1:00:45] not ashamed he says it
[1:00:47] right there close to the ten
[1:00:48] commandments and then he repeats it
[1:00:50] again
[1:00:51] and says my name is jealous so he's not
[1:00:53] ashamed of it
[1:00:56] neither should we be ashamed of it god
[1:00:57] is a jealous god
[1:01:01] deuteronomy 4 24 says for the lord thy
[1:01:05] god is a consuming fire
[1:01:07] even a jealous god deuteronomy 6 15 says
[1:01:11] for the lord thy god is a jealous god
[1:01:13] among you
[1:01:14] lest the anger of the lord thy god be
[1:01:16] kindled against thee and destroy thee
[1:01:17] from off
[1:01:18] the face of the earth
[1:01:21] so let's consider jealousy in the
[1:01:24] context of scripture
[1:01:28] exodus 34 6-7
[1:01:32] you know we can't any of these
[1:01:34] attributes like if you just
[1:01:36] focus on the wrath of god but never look
[1:01:39] at the mercy of god
[1:01:40] the love of god you'll have things out
[1:01:43] of order
[1:01:44] you always have to have these attributes
[1:01:48] in their full picture not just one part
[1:01:51] of it
[1:01:52] and so exodus 34 6 and 7 says and the
[1:01:55] lord passed by
[1:01:57] before him and proclaimed the lord the
[1:01:59] lord god
[1:02:01] merciful and gracious long-suffering and
[1:02:03] abundant in goodness and truth keeping
[1:02:05] mercy for thousands
[1:02:07] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[1:02:09] sin and that will by no means clear the
[1:02:11] guilty
[1:02:12] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[1:02:14] upon the children and upon the
[1:02:15] children's trinity children under the
[1:02:17] third
[1:02:18] and fourth generation so god is merciful
[1:02:22] he's gracious long-suffering abundant
[1:02:25] and goodness abundant in truth
[1:02:27] forgiving iniquity transgression and sin
[1:02:31] punishing the guilty and he's also
[1:02:33] jealous
[1:02:35] so we can't we can't run away from it we
[1:02:39] can't say well let's let's dismiss that
[1:02:42] so that i guess the question comes down
[1:02:44] to this how can
[1:02:46] jealousy be a virtue in god
[1:02:49] when it is a moral vice in men
[1:02:54] so first of all the word jealousy
[1:02:58] used in the bible for god is really uh
[1:03:01] what we term as
[1:03:02] like an anthropomorphism in other words
[1:03:05] you're
[1:03:05] you're saying you're speaking about god
[1:03:09] in human terms that you and i
[1:03:12] can understand even though god really
[1:03:15] transcends
[1:03:16] these human terms that we're using
[1:03:21] in other words if we define if we if we
[1:03:23] take jealousy
[1:03:25] and define it the way our human
[1:03:27] understanding
[1:03:28] brings it then we'll be perverting god's
[1:03:31] word we need to define
[1:03:33] god's word based on god's word
[1:03:36] not based on what we think it might mean
[1:03:42] so the first thing is james 1 20 says
[1:03:45] for the wrath of man
[1:03:46] works not the righteousness of god
[1:03:50] but the wrath of god is the judicial
[1:03:53] outworking of god's righteousness
[1:03:56] so the wrath of man is does not
[1:03:58] accomplish god's rights
[1:03:59] our anger is not going to accomplish
[1:04:04] and set forth the righteousness of god
[1:04:08] it's only going to pervert it but
[1:04:12] the wrath of god actually establishes
[1:04:15] and goes out because of the righteous
[1:04:18] his righteousness
[1:04:20] so we have to look at this and see this
[1:04:23] that god's jealousy
[1:04:25] is actually a positive thing it's not a
[1:04:28] combination of
[1:04:30] anger and frustration envy and spite
[1:04:34] that's human jealousy
[1:04:38] god's jealousy is a praiseworthy zeal
[1:04:42] in fact if you look at one of the
[1:04:44] meetings in one of the translations of
[1:04:46] the word
[1:04:47] jealous it also speaks of zealous or
[1:04:50] zeal to burn
[1:04:51] hot so god's zeal or god's
[1:04:56] jealousy speaks of the preservation
[1:05:00] of something that is precious
[1:05:04] above all things number one and that's
[1:05:07] his glory his character
[1:05:11] so he's jealous because he wants to
[1:05:14] preserve the thing that is most precious
[1:05:17] in all the world it's him
[1:05:23] if we act that way we have a serious
[1:05:27] mental problem i think we have a
[1:05:30] president that kind of acts that way
[1:05:32] right now
[1:05:36] that everything is done for to preserve
[1:05:39] one's own standing character etc is bad
[1:05:44] for us
[1:05:45] for god to preserve himself and act
[1:05:49] to glorify himself is he's only doing
[1:05:52] the right thing that everyone should do
[1:05:56] so also there's two kinds of jealousy in
[1:06:00] humans
[1:06:01] really if you look at it closely there's
[1:06:03] a wicked jealousy which
[1:06:05] comes from a hatred for others a
[1:06:07] selfishness
[1:06:09] you want what someone has taken away
[1:06:12] from you or what you feel like
[1:06:13] it belongs to you but there is a godly
[1:06:16] jealousy
[1:06:18] that we would have for one another that
[1:06:20] a husband
[1:06:22] or a wife would have to their spouse i'm
[1:06:25] not talking about
[1:06:26] a spiteful jealousy i'm talking about
[1:06:29] the attitude that we have that we say my
[1:06:32] spouse
[1:06:33] is my spouse it's not your spouse
[1:06:37] don't touch my spouse don't touch my
[1:06:40] wife
[1:06:41] don't say bad things to my wife and i
[1:06:45] don't want my wife
[1:06:46] going with anybody else she doesn't want
[1:06:49] her husband going with somebody else
[1:06:52] that's that is a good
[1:06:55] form of jealousy now that can turn and
[1:06:57] be
[1:06:59] suspicion and anger and manipulation and
[1:07:02] control
[1:07:03] i'm not talking about that that's what
[1:07:04] we're talking about in the first time
[1:07:07] wicked jealousy that you want to control
[1:07:09] something
[1:07:11] because you're so scared of losing it so
[1:07:14] you'll
[1:07:14] you'll grab it and squeeze it to death
[1:07:18] and ruin it and ruin what you had in the
[1:07:20] process
[1:07:21] not talking about that i'm just talking
[1:07:23] about the basic
[1:07:24] agreement that a husband and wife have
[1:07:27] with each other
[1:07:28] we're exclusive and we watch
[1:07:31] and we're careful and we're we have a
[1:07:34] great amount of zeal
[1:07:35] to be sure that it stays that way
[1:07:39] in our relationships that's a good thing
[1:07:42] that's a godly thing
[1:07:44] and god's jealousy is the latter that
[1:07:47] what we're just talking about
[1:07:50] the second jealousy is a virtue and it
[1:07:53] shows a correct
[1:07:54] understanding of the marriage covenant
[1:07:57] and it's the same thing with god towards
[1:07:59] us
[1:08:02] he enters that covenant with us that
[1:08:04] marriage covenant with us
[1:08:06] and we belong to him he does not want us
[1:08:09] looking to another he
[1:08:10] doesn't want us to put anyone before him
[1:08:14] he says i'll have no other gods before
[1:08:16] me
[1:08:18] ezekiel 8 3 says and he put forth the
[1:08:21] form of a hand and took me
[1:08:22] by a lock of mine head and the spirit
[1:08:24] lifted me up between the earth and the
[1:08:25] heaven
[1:08:26] and brought me in the visions of god to
[1:08:28] jerusalem to do to the door of the inner
[1:08:30] gate
[1:08:31] that looks towards the north where was
[1:08:33] the seat
[1:08:34] of the image of jealousy which provokes
[1:08:37] to jealousy
[1:08:38] again these people are supposed to be
[1:08:40] worshipping god in the temple
[1:08:42] instead they they have idols up
[1:08:45] secretly worshiping and he calls it an
[1:08:48] image
[1:08:49] of jealousy that provokes to jealousy
[1:08:53] provokes who to jealousy him
[1:08:54] god so god's jealousy first starts
[1:08:59] with his love for his own glory
[1:09:03] and secondly for his love for us
[1:09:07] he seeks to preserve his love
[1:09:10] and he seeks to preserve his bride for
[1:09:14] himself and he goes to every length to
[1:09:17] be able to do that
[1:09:19] we understand though his love is
[1:09:21] elective
[1:09:22] it's not an emotion he's chosen us by
[1:09:25] his sovereign
[1:09:26] grace and because of that he's jealous
[1:09:29] over us
[1:09:32] not only that but it's god's jealousy is
[1:09:34] to fulfill
[1:09:35] his purpose to fulfill his righteousness
[1:09:38] and judgment isaiah 9 7 says of the
[1:09:40] increase
[1:09:42] of his government and peace there shall
[1:09:43] be no end upon the throne of david and
[1:09:46] upon his kingdom to order it and to
[1:09:48] establish it with judgment and with
[1:09:49] justice
[1:09:50] from henceforth even forever what does
[1:09:53] he say
[1:09:54] the zeal it's the same word the zeal or
[1:09:57] the jealousy of the lord
[1:09:59] of hosts will perform it
[1:10:02] ezekiel 5 13 says thus shall my anger be
[1:10:05] accomplished and i will cause my fury to
[1:10:07] rest upon them and i will be comforted
[1:10:10] and they shall know that i the lord have
[1:10:11] spoken it in my zeal when i have
[1:10:13] accomplished
[1:10:15] mine fury in them
[1:10:18] so god god has a zeal
[1:10:22] has a jealousy to accomplish his purpose
[1:10:25] in us and in the world in the world
[1:10:29] it speaks of a a red
[1:10:32] hot fervor well he wants us to have the
[1:10:36] same
[1:10:37] attitude towards him he's our husband
[1:10:39] right
[1:10:40] so we he wants us not to be
[1:10:44] lukewarm he doesn't want us to be cold
[1:10:46] he wants us to be
[1:10:48] on fire hot full
[1:10:51] of zeal for him
[1:10:57] i don't have it down here but there's a
[1:10:58] there's i believe it was
[1:11:02] elijah the lord asked where are you
[1:11:04] going elijah
[1:11:06] he said i've been very jealous
[1:11:09] for the lord my god
[1:11:13] and that should be our attitude
[1:11:16] we should be jealous for the same things
[1:11:19] he is jealous over we should have the
[1:11:21] same red
[1:11:23] hot zeal for his glory for his
[1:11:27] work to go forward for his purpose to be
[1:11:30] accomplished
[1:11:31] in the earth and it should move us to
[1:11:32] act to speak
[1:11:34] to pray to do something not just to sit
[1:11:38] but it should move us elijah wasn't just
[1:11:42] sitting
[1:11:43] someplace off in the distance he was
[1:11:46] praying he was seeking god
[1:11:49] and god moved him to do something and so
[1:11:53] as he's moving
[1:11:54] after this great great mighty
[1:11:57] work for god god asked him where are you
[1:11:59] going i've been very jealous with the
[1:12:01] lord god
[1:12:02] i love that
[1:12:08] isaiah 42 verse 8 says i am the lord
[1:12:12] that is my name and my glory will i not
[1:12:15] give to another neither my praise
[1:12:18] to great graven images and then
[1:12:21] isaiah 48 11 says for my own sake even
[1:12:23] for my known sake will i do it
[1:12:27] for how should my name be polluted and i
[1:12:29] will not give my glory
[1:12:31] unto another that's the basis of god's
[1:12:34] jealousy
[1:12:36] he wants to see his name first his name
[1:12:40] glorified he be the first one
[1:12:45] in our hearts and in our minds and he
[1:12:48] works
[1:12:49] continuously to make sure that is the
[1:12:52] case
[1:12:59] let's look a little bit at the couple
[1:13:02] different things they kind of blend
[1:13:03] together the supremacy of god
[1:13:06] and then the sovereignty of god
[1:13:09] we'll see if we get to the sovereignty
[1:13:11] of god but
[1:13:12] so the supremacy of god supremacy means
[1:13:15] the state or condition
[1:13:17] of being superior to all others in
[1:13:19] authority
[1:13:21] power or status first chronicles 29
[1:13:26] verses 11 and 12.
[1:13:32] thine o lord is the greatness and the
[1:13:34] power
[1:13:35] and the glory and the victory and the
[1:13:37] majesty
[1:13:38] for all that is in the heaven and in the
[1:13:40] earth is thine
[1:13:42] thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art
[1:13:45] exalted as head
[1:13:46] above all both riches and honor come of
[1:13:50] thee
[1:13:51] and thou rainest over all and in thine
[1:13:53] hand is power and might
[1:13:55] and in thine hand it is to make great
[1:13:58] and to give strength
[1:13:59] unto all god reigns
[1:14:03] overall now not
[1:14:06] in the future in the millennium he
[1:14:08] reigns over
[1:14:10] everything now whatever he
[1:14:13] desires to accomplish that's
[1:14:16] what he accomplishes because he's the
[1:14:17] supreme
[1:14:19] being he makes some rich he makes some
[1:14:22] poor
[1:14:23] he puts some in power he gives some to
[1:14:24] no power makes some strong he makes some
[1:14:27] weak
[1:14:28] second chronicles 20 verse 6 says and
[1:14:32] and said oh lord god of our fathers art
[1:14:34] not thou god in heaven
[1:14:36] and rule us not thou over all the
[1:14:39] kingdoms of the heathen
[1:14:40] and in thine hand is there not power and
[1:14:43] might so that none
[1:14:44] is able to withstand thee
[1:14:48] do you have troubles in your life do you
[1:14:50] have difficulties this is a
[1:14:52] great verse to speak over it because god
[1:14:54] is in
[1:14:55] control of everything and sometimes we
[1:14:58] just need to speak it over ourself
[1:15:00] to remember that god is in control of
[1:15:02] our circumstances
[1:15:04] nothing's happening out of chance this
[1:15:06] isn't some random act
[1:15:08] some random thing that's happened god is
[1:15:11] working mightily in
[1:15:14] your situation in what's going on with
[1:15:16] you
[1:15:18] job 42 verse 2 i know that thou canst do
[1:15:22] everything and that no thought can be
[1:15:25] withholding from thee
[1:15:26] you can do everything or in other words
[1:15:29] the way to say is you can do anything
[1:15:31] god can do anything that he pleases
[1:15:35] there's no one to stop him there's
[1:15:37] nothing
[1:15:38] that can prevent him
[1:15:41] jeremiah 32 17 says ah lord god behold
[1:15:45] thou has made the heaven and the earth
[1:15:47] by thy great power and stretched out arm
[1:15:50] and there's nothing too hard for thee
[1:15:54] proverbs 21 verse 1
[1:15:57] the king's heart is in the hand of the
[1:15:59] lord as the rivers of water
[1:16:01] he turns it whithersoever he will
[1:16:05] i just want to comfort you for a minute
[1:16:07] right here
[1:16:09] we look at what's going on today i i've
[1:16:11] just been ignoring
[1:16:13] politics i've been ignoring as best as i
[1:16:15] can
[1:16:17] election disputes and speeches of this
[1:16:20] one and that one
[1:16:21] because it just drags your heart to the
[1:16:25] wrong
[1:16:27] place time and i'm not saying stick your
[1:16:29] head in the sand
[1:16:30] not saying that at all but when you do
[1:16:33] update yourself be sure that you have
[1:16:37] the scripture right here written
[1:16:40] somewhere on your device or in front of
[1:16:43] you
[1:16:45] if joe biden as president we're not all
[1:16:48] going to die
[1:16:52] if joe biden is president god still
[1:16:55] provides for your needs it has nothing
[1:16:58] to do
[1:16:58] with trump trump didn't provide for your
[1:17:01] needs
[1:17:02] and neither will joe biden provide for
[1:17:04] your needs
[1:17:05] god will provide for your needs would i
[1:17:07] rather have trump as president
[1:17:10] yes does it make a difference to me as a
[1:17:13] christian
[1:17:14] not really and if it does
[1:17:17] god come please come to the altar and
[1:17:20] repent
[1:17:21] and let me repent because the reality is
[1:17:24] this is not this is not where our
[1:17:25] ultimate citizenship is
[1:17:27] yes we live here yes if you feel led to
[1:17:30] you should vote
[1:17:32] yes you should be a responsible person
[1:17:34] yes you should
[1:17:35] help in every way you can in this
[1:17:38] society
[1:17:39] and the people around you but remember
[1:17:41] that's not
[1:17:42] what you're called to do that's not your
[1:17:45] primary
[1:17:47] position in this world not even your job
[1:17:50] as your primary position
[1:17:51] your primary position is to be an
[1:17:53] ambassador for jesus christ
[1:17:56] and your god provides for you
[1:18:00] if we turn into a communist dictatorship
[1:18:02] overnight
[1:18:03] god will provide for you and our church
[1:18:05] will be a lot better for it i think
[1:18:07] because we will suffer and we'll
[1:18:10] actually share our faith and will
[1:18:12] actually
[1:18:12] begin to grow by leaps and bounds
[1:18:15] because of the suffering
[1:18:18] so i don't believe that's what's going
[1:18:20] to happen
[1:18:23] i'm just saying what if the worst thing
[1:18:25] that we as americans could think of
[1:18:28] happened what if and i say so what
[1:18:32] god has decreed that that happened what
[1:18:35] should my attitude be well
[1:18:36] we're americans we should have the
[1:18:38] second amendment and we should have this
[1:18:40] yeah we do we have those things and we
[1:18:41] thank the lord for that
[1:18:43] but nevertheless who is the one
[1:18:47] the kings the presidents the scotus
[1:18:53] the speaker of the house's heart is in
[1:18:55] the hand of the lord
[1:18:57] as the rivers of water he turns it
[1:18:59] however
[1:19:00] he wants to
[1:19:04] so don't fear because the one who loves
[1:19:07] you
[1:19:08] controls the hearts of the evil people
[1:19:12] of this world and he will provide for
[1:19:16] you
[1:19:17] if you're obedient to him if you follow
[1:19:19] his scriptural principles
[1:19:21] you will have food
[1:19:24] you'll have clothes and he'll take care
[1:19:28] of you
[1:19:30] so there's nothing to be afraid of
[1:19:33] there's nothing to get so worked up
[1:19:36] about
[1:19:38] okay i get worked up too right i'm not
[1:19:41] saying
[1:19:42] i don't i'm saying don't do that
[1:19:47] our eyes are getting my eyes your eyes
[1:19:50] they get on the wrong thing and it
[1:19:53] becomes a hindrance to the practice
[1:19:55] of your faith oh no it isn't
[1:19:58] yes it is because you're supposed to
[1:20:02] make a difference you're not supposed to
[1:20:03] wait for the president
[1:20:04] or the supreme court to make a
[1:20:06] difference in this world
[1:20:08] you're supposed to make a difference in
[1:20:09] people's lives right here
[1:20:13] the little things the small things
[1:20:14] around you the little
[1:20:17] things that you only can do to serve to
[1:20:20] help
[1:20:21] to show the love of christ to others
[1:20:23] that's what you're supposed to do
[1:20:25] you're not going to change who's
[1:20:26] president
[1:20:29] amen god has decreed that he is going to
[1:20:32] put that person in there i'm not saying
[1:20:35] you shouldn't vote but i'm saying
[1:20:38] you by taking thought by worrying
[1:20:42] are not going to change anything keep
[1:20:45] your eyes on
[1:20:46] things above not on things on the earth
[1:20:49] romans 11 36 for of him and through him
[1:20:53] and to him are all things to whom be
[1:20:55] glory forever
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:01] god is supreme
[1:21:05] all through history we do read about
[1:21:08] people that defy
[1:21:09] god even scripture says so and so
[1:21:12] defined god
[1:21:14] and we see it today in the world
[1:21:18] they're defying god
[1:21:21] but what they're doing is they're
[1:21:22] actually defying the external
[1:21:25] word of god they're not defying the
[1:21:30] sovereign decree or plan of god
[1:21:33] their very defiance is a fulfillment
[1:21:36] of that plan romans 9 22 says what if
[1:21:40] god
[1:21:41] willing to show his wrath and to make
[1:21:43] his power known endured with much
[1:21:46] long-suffering patience the vessels of
[1:21:49] wrath
[1:21:50] fitted for destruction
[1:21:53] and jude 1 4 says for there are certain
[1:21:56] men crept in unawares who were before of
[1:21:59] old ordained
[1:22:00] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:22:03] the grace of our god into
[1:22:04] lasciviousness and denying the only lord
[1:22:07] god
[1:22:08] in our lord jesus christ they were
[1:22:10] ordained
[1:22:11] before the world began to be people who
[1:22:15] are in defiance
[1:22:17] of the word of god
[1:22:20] god has a purpose in all that
[1:22:23] don't get worried about it don't get
[1:22:26] upset
[1:22:27] pray pray for them but ultimately we
[1:22:30] know the people that continue
[1:22:32] to resist and defy god's word
[1:22:35] will experience god's wrath
[1:22:39] but even jesus on the cross prayed for
[1:22:42] those who continually
[1:22:44] defied god and crucified him
[1:22:48] he still prayed for them
[1:22:54] i won't get through it all but i'm gonna
[1:22:56] gonna just
[1:22:57] start to speak on the sovereignty of god
[1:23:02] the sovereignty of god is the exercise
[1:23:06] of his supremacy so we read
[1:23:10] scriptures like this over and over again
[1:23:12] psalm 135 verse 6 says
[1:23:14] whatsoever the lord pleased that did he
[1:23:16] in heaven
[1:23:17] and in the earth and in the seas and in
[1:23:20] the deep
[1:23:21] places so god does what he pleases
[1:23:25] nothing can stop him from doing that i'm
[1:23:28] just going to skip
[1:23:29] some parts here
[1:23:33] just to look at the outworking of god's
[1:23:36] sovereignty
[1:23:39] proverbs 16 33.
[1:23:49] it says the lot is cast into the lap
[1:23:53] so that i'm going to re read from the
[1:23:54] esv
[1:23:56] the lot is cast into the lap but it's
[1:23:59] every decision
[1:24:00] is from the lord put it into modern
[1:24:03] terms
[1:24:04] dice are rolled but whatever they come
[1:24:06] up with it's from the lord
[1:24:10] so god is sovereign over every bit
[1:24:14] every small thing every small decision
[1:24:18] they used to cast lots in order to make
[1:24:20] decisions or say this is the right thing
[1:24:22] to do
[1:24:23] and this is the right day to do it on in
[1:24:26] other words god's saying
[1:24:27] it's from him god is
[1:24:31] sovereign over nature you know in jonah
[1:24:35] what did he do commanded the fish to
[1:24:38] swallow him
[1:24:39] he commanded a plant to grow and then he
[1:24:42] commanded a worm to destroy the plant
[1:24:45] that he commanded to grow
[1:24:49] so god is sovereign over worms
[1:24:53] god is sovereign over plants i tend to
[1:24:56] kill him
[1:24:58] too often he's sovereign over that
[1:25:02] he didn't give me that gift i'm trying
[1:25:04] to learn
[1:25:05] but i'm not gifted that way
[1:25:09] god is sovereign over the supernatural
[1:25:12] realm
[1:25:13] satan came before job
[1:25:16] or came before god regarding job and he
[1:25:19] was only given certain permissions he
[1:25:21] could only go
[1:25:22] so far
[1:25:26] exodus 4 11 and the lord said unto him
[1:25:30] who hath made man's mouth or who makes
[1:25:34] the dumb
[1:25:34] or deaf or the seeing or the blind
[1:25:38] have not i the lord this is a little
[1:25:41] tricky place but put it into our terms
[1:25:45] god is sovereign over who
[1:25:48] is born with disabilities who has
[1:25:51] disabilities
[1:25:53] and so maybe that sounds bad but i want
[1:25:55] to i want to bring it on the
[1:25:57] other hand is that if you're born with a
[1:26:01] disability
[1:26:01] god has purpose in it and through it
[1:26:05] and he will use it for his sovereign
[1:26:08] purposes
[1:26:10] in the lives of your family in the lives
[1:26:12] of others
[1:26:16] god knows what he's doing and he's not
[1:26:19] doing it out of
[1:26:21] anger or malice he's doing it out of
[1:26:23] love
[1:26:24] so those who have disabilities it's not
[1:26:27] outside of god's control
[1:26:29] god has a purpose in it
[1:26:33] because he says i'm the one that make
[1:26:34] them
[1:26:37] first peter 4 19 wherefore let them that
[1:26:42] suffer according to the will of god
[1:26:43] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[1:26:45] in well-doing as unto a faithful creator
[1:26:49] god is sovereign
[1:26:51] over our suffering
[1:26:55] again these things should bring
[1:26:58] comfort if you know god if you don't
[1:27:00] know god
[1:27:01] i doubt they'll bring comfort but if you
[1:27:04] know god
[1:27:06] it shouldn't say oh my goodness what is
[1:27:07] he talking about doesn't he know how
[1:27:09] much i hurt
[1:27:11] god loves you you know that you know him
[1:27:14] personally
[1:27:15] you know how he's led your life you know
[1:27:18] how he's been with you
[1:27:19] so if you're suffering you can rest
[1:27:23] in his sovereign hand
[1:27:27] amos 3 6 and i'm going to read from the
[1:27:30] esv to give a little bit
[1:27:34] deeper sense in this is a trumpet blown
[1:27:37] in a city and the people are not afraid
[1:27:40] does disaster come to a city
[1:27:43] unless the lord has done it god is
[1:27:46] sovereign over
[1:27:48] natural disasters
[1:27:51] and he has a purpose in them and he
[1:27:54] has a purpose to accomplish in them if
[1:27:57] he wants if he if he wants to he can
[1:28:00] quickly push a storm away make it
[1:28:03] disappear
[1:28:03] completely even from the radar
[1:28:07] everywhere but if he doesn't want that
[1:28:09] to happen he has another purpose
[1:28:12] he'll do that as well
[1:28:15] deuteronomy 32 verse 2 39
[1:28:21] see now that i even i am he and there is
[1:28:24] no god with me i kill and i make alive i
[1:28:26] wound and i heal neither is there any
[1:28:28] that can deliver
[1:28:29] out of my hand the grim reaper is not
[1:28:33] in control of of death god is in control
[1:28:37] of both life and death
[1:28:40] every breath that we take every
[1:28:44] time our heart beats god
[1:28:47] ordained how many that we have before
[1:28:50] the foundation of the world
[1:28:53] james 4 13-15
[1:29:02] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[1:29:04] we will go to such a city and continue
[1:29:06] there a year
[1:29:07] and buy and sell and get gain whereas
[1:29:10] you know not what shall be on the morrow
[1:29:12] for what is your life it is even a vapor
[1:29:14] that appears for a little time then and
[1:29:17] then vanishes away
[1:29:19] for that you ought to say if the lord
[1:29:21] will we shall live and do this or that
[1:29:23] god is sovereign over
[1:29:25] our financial situation amen
[1:29:29] the success or failure of our work
[1:29:32] or business ventures god is sovereign
[1:29:34] over that
[1:29:36] and he will accomplish his purpose for
[1:29:38] his glory whether that's failure
[1:29:41] he'll use that to help you to grow to
[1:29:44] help you to rely on him more
[1:29:47] whatever his purpose is through that or
[1:29:49] to direct you somewhere else
[1:29:52] that's okay we just say thank you lord
[1:29:55] and keep moving on
[1:29:58] matthew 10 29
[1:30:02] are not two sparrows sold for a farthing
[1:30:05] and one of them shall not fall on the
[1:30:06] ground
[1:30:07] without your father even of the smallest
[1:30:11] most insignificant animals
[1:30:14] god knows about their death and god took
[1:30:17] and put forth a plan regarding their
[1:30:20] life
[1:30:22] and their death it's just astounding to
[1:30:23] think you know you see
[1:30:25] the swarms of animals and birds and
[1:30:27] every single one of them
[1:30:29] god knows that bird
[1:30:32] more completely than any scientist
[1:30:36] could possibly know them and he not only
[1:30:38] knows that but he knows the individual
[1:30:40] traits of that bird and it's
[1:30:44] it's the same and yet it's different
[1:30:46] from all the birds that are
[1:30:48] just like it it's astounding to think
[1:30:51] about
[1:30:53] musicians if you come first timothy
[1:30:57] 5 21 i charge thee before god and the
[1:31:01] lord jesus
[1:31:02] christ and the elect angels
[1:31:06] god is even sovereign over who are the
[1:31:08] angels
[1:31:10] that fall and who are the angels that
[1:31:13] didn't fall
[1:31:14] completely sovereign over them
[1:31:18] and a verse that i can usually not
[1:31:20] really read without crying
[1:31:22] so i'm going to try for the first time
[1:31:24] to read it without crying
[1:31:27] but joseph and the circumstances of his
[1:31:30] life
[1:31:31] and he comes there his father has passed
[1:31:34] away and his
[1:31:36] brothers are afraid that joseph is now
[1:31:40] going to declare his true colors and
[1:31:42] kill them all
[1:31:44] torture them all just like they did to
[1:31:46] him
[1:31:48] and he comes to them and he says but as
[1:31:50] for you
[1:31:52] you thought evil against me
[1:31:55] just think about that think about the
[1:31:58] things that have happened
[1:31:59] think about the crooked schemes the
[1:32:02] devil has tried to play on you
[1:32:04] has played on you the suffering
[1:32:07] that you've gone through the things that
[1:32:10] people have done
[1:32:12] against you spoken against you says you
[1:32:15] thought
[1:32:15] evil against me but god meant it unto
[1:32:19] good
[1:32:20] to bring to pass as it is this i didn't
[1:32:22] make it
[1:32:25] to bring to pass as it is this day
[1:32:28] to save much people alive
[1:32:32] we look at things and we see things from
[1:32:34] the exterior and say
[1:32:36] joseph suffered a lot
[1:32:40] he was in a position to be a wealthy man
[1:32:42] in a
[1:32:43] wonderful uh a wonderfully wealthy
[1:32:47] family
[1:32:48] he was going to take over all of that
[1:32:49] and he had a life of comfort and ease
[1:32:51] just commanding people what to do and
[1:32:54] it was easy but god didn't want it easy
[1:32:56] for joseph
[1:32:58] he didn't ordain it to be easy for
[1:33:00] joseph
[1:33:01] and he it was god that allowed those
[1:33:06] men to do that to their
[1:33:09] brother it's terrible to think about
[1:33:13] what they did but god allowed it god had
[1:33:16] his hand over every situation
[1:33:17] they weren't going to kill him they had
[1:33:19] no there was no chance that they were
[1:33:21] going to kill him
[1:33:22] because god saw joseph
[1:33:25] basically on the throne in egypt in
[1:33:28] charge of everything
[1:33:29] they're administering by the wisdom of
[1:33:32] god
[1:33:33] and saving people alive in order for
[1:33:36] what
[1:33:37] god is moving the puzzle pieces
[1:33:40] everywhere in order that
[1:33:41] the children of israel would be in egypt
[1:33:44] so that god could manifest himself in
[1:33:46] such a
[1:33:47] incredible way by bringing them out by
[1:33:50] bringing egypt to its knees
[1:33:52] by crossing the red sea all of this
[1:33:56] good amazing good that happened
[1:33:59] everything really everything that
[1:34:01] followed in the plan of god
[1:34:04] really came down to this was joseph was
[1:34:07] thrown into a pit
[1:34:10] and he thought he was going to die save
[1:34:14] me
[1:34:14] save me somebody said oh let's sell them
[1:34:19] they sell them not knowing this set what
[1:34:22] it set forth
[1:34:23] something so marvelous so incredible
[1:34:27] stories uh that
[1:34:31] constantly daily touch people's lives
[1:34:34] and
[1:34:35] help them to walk more in faith
[1:34:39] and trust they thought it you thought
[1:34:42] evil against me but god meant it for
[1:34:43] good
[1:34:45] amen let's pray
[1:34:49] heavenly father we love you so much
[1:34:52] and it's so astounding to think lord
[1:34:56] this exercise of your
[1:34:59] sovereignty in the world and in our
[1:35:02] lives
[1:35:06] lord we let us just rest in that
[1:35:11] what's happening today is not out of
[1:35:13] your control
[1:35:15] it's not without purpose it might be
[1:35:19] upsetting our our minds and frustrating
[1:35:22] our plans and our our purposes
[1:35:25] but it's not frustrating you and it's
[1:35:27] not frustrating your purpose
[1:35:29] in our lives many things many things
[1:35:33] have been
[1:35:34] changed been blocked and and things that
[1:35:38] were normal for me i can't do anymore
[1:35:43] but you knew that lord
[1:35:46] and you purpose that all of these things
[1:35:51] that we see in our lives
[1:35:54] it's the working of your sovereignty
[1:35:59] and though some things are very
[1:36:01] difficult
[1:36:03] and very problematic and
[1:36:07] and bring suffering in our lives
[1:36:11] and yet you're working for good
[1:36:16] not only for our good but for the good
[1:36:20] within your entire plan of salvation
[1:36:24] we're coming to the very fruition
[1:36:28] of your plan of salvation and redemption
[1:36:32] and here we find ourselves in the midst
[1:36:35] of
[1:36:36] lockdowns and shutdowns and inability to
[1:36:39] travel internationally and all these
[1:36:41] things
[1:36:43] it's part of your plan lord we know that
[1:36:46] help us to see truly the place that you
[1:36:49] have us to be and help us to be
[1:36:52] all that we can be in christ just like
[1:36:55] what joseph was
[1:36:57] every situation
[1:37:01] he had success because he was walking in
[1:37:04] obedience
[1:37:06] walking with you lord let us continue to
[1:37:09] walk
[1:37:10] let us have lord a genuine
[1:37:15] red hot zeal as

[1:37:31] lord let's just let's just take this
[1:37:33] time help us lord to
[1:37:36] just search our hearts just as you are
[1:37:40] jealous over us
[1:37:41] lord would you cause us to be jealous
[1:37:45] over you

[1:37:50] lord jesus christ
