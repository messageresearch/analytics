[30:23] Father, we love you this morning.
[30:26] And Lord, when I think of those that are
[30:29] not feeling well, battling cancer,
[30:32] Father, it can be such a debilitating
[30:34] disease going through the medical
[30:36] process, Father. And I just pray that
[30:39] you would help them, Lord. Remember our
[30:41] brother Dawn this morning. Father, touch
[30:43] his body, Lord, and be with Sharon as
[30:47] she's with this woman, Sylvia she lives
[30:49] with. Father, I pray that you would work
[30:51] that situation out.
[30:54] And Lord, Melissa's friend,
[30:57] fellow teacher. Lord, the devil is just
[31:00] seeking whom he may devour. But we come,
[31:02] Lord, you said you would raise a
[31:04] standard in this last day. And Father,
[31:07] we raise the standard of the name of the
[31:09] Lord Jesus Christ against these things.
[31:11] Father, your word, you said you would
[31:13] keep it. We believe it. And that settles
[31:15] that, Father.
[31:17] We commit these requests into your hands
[31:19] today. And Lord, we are expecting to
[31:23] hear from you. We pray that you would
[31:24] bless the brother, move him aside. And
[31:27] Lord, that we would open our hearts to
[31:29] receive what you have for us today.
[31:32] Yesterday's gone, tomorrow may never
[31:34] come, Father. But here we are in present
[31:37] tense. Help us to receive what you have
[31:39] for us, Father. As we collect the tithes
[31:42] and offerings, I pray that you would
[31:44] bless the cheerful giver, Father.
[31:46] Lord, we thank you for the bounty that
[31:48] you give us and we thank you and we ask
[31:50] you that you would help us to be
[31:52] diligent with that for your kingdom. We
[31:56] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can move. You can have your
[32:00] seats as well. Thanks.

[32:57] [Music]
[32:59] What did your blood
[33:02] purchase, Lord,
[33:07] as it flowed down that old rugged tree?
[33:16] Was redemption's
[33:18] price paid but for part?
[33:25] For your intention
[33:27] to have all of me,
[33:33] [Music]
[33:34] I
[33:36] draw nigh
[33:38] to thee.
[33:41] [Music]
[33:43] Draw
[33:45] thou nigh
[33:47] to me,
[33:52] Lord.
[33:54] fill
[33:56] my life
[34:00] &gt;&gt; till Christ
[34:02] is all
[34:04] you see.
[34:10] If there be anything,
[34:14] Lord,
[34:15] [Music]
[34:17] that would hinder
[34:20] communion with thee.
[34:27] Help me to cast it aside
[34:32] [Music]
[34:34] for it is nothing
[34:39] to me.
[34:40] [Music]
[34:43] Oh, I want to give you my all
[34:50] [Music]
[34:52] and be what you'd have me to be.
[34:58] [Music]
[35:01] I just long to be near you, Lord,
[35:09] and taste of your presence
[35:13] so sweet.
[35:18] I
[35:20] draw nigh
[35:22] to thee.
[35:27] Draw
[35:29] thou nigh
[35:31] to me
[35:36] Lord.
[35:38] Fill
[35:39] my life.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Till Christ
[35:46] is all
[35:48] you see.
[35:53] Your presence falls down like rain.
[36:01] My soul
[36:03] rejoiceth
[36:05] to see
[36:09] your life as it blooms in my heart.
[36:16] [Music]
[36:18] Your nearness, oh God, changing me.
[36:27] I
[36:28] draw nigh
[36:31] to thee.
[36:35] Draw
[36:37] thou nigh
[36:39] to me,
[36:42] [Music]
[36:44] Lord.
[36:46] fill
[36:47] my life
[36:52] till Christ
[36:54] is all
[36:56] you see.
[37:01] Lord,
[37:03] fill
[37:04] my life
[37:07] [Music]
[37:09] till Christ
[37:11] is all
[37:13] you see.
[37:16] [Music]
[37:20] Amen.
[37:22] Appreciate that. Let's all stand to our
[37:24] feet this morning. Sweep over my soul.
[37:26] Sweep over my soul, sweet spirit. We
[37:28] want to turn our hearts now. Amen. To
[37:31] the Lord. Did you come with a need upon
[37:33] your heart? Maybe something you need the
[37:34] Lord to minister to. Amen. Why don't you
[37:37] raise that up and hold it up before the
[37:38] Lord? We come to see Jesus. Amen. That's
[37:41] why we gather. It's the only reason. We
[37:43] appreciate all of the the you know
[37:45] everybody here, but he's the he's the
[37:47] most important. He's the main thing as
[37:50] brother Brandham said. He's the main
[37:51] spring. So we we just want to make our
[37:53] brother Matthew feel welcome. Invite him
[37:55] to come at this time. Take his liberty.
[37:58] Sweep over
[38:01] my soul.
[38:04] Sweep over
[38:08] my soul.
[38:11] Sweet spirit,
[38:15] sweep over
[38:18] my soul.
[38:22] [Music]
[38:23] My rest
[38:27] is complete.
[38:30] While I sing
[38:33] at your feet,
[38:36] sweet spirit,
[38:39] sweep over
[38:42] my soul. Could you raise your hands and
[38:45] sing it like a prayer?
[38:48] Sweep over
[38:51] my soul.
[38:54] Sweep over
[38:57] my soul. Oh
[39:01] sweet spirit
[39:04] sweep overs
[39:06] that your prayer. Yes Lord.
[39:10] Oh
[39:13] my rest
[39:15] [Music]
[39:16] is complete
[39:18] while I sing
[39:22] at your feet.
[39:25] Sweet spirit,
[39:28] sweep over. One more time, let's tell
[39:32] him like a prayer.
[39:34] Oh, that is our Lord. Sweep
[39:40] my soul.
[39:43] Sweep
[39:46] my
[39:47] [Music]
[39:53] sweep over
[39:56] my soul.
[39:59] Oh my, what a song.
[40:02] I raise that truth.
[40:06] Oh hallelujah. While I sing
[40:10] at your feet,
[40:13] sweet spirit,
[40:17] sweep over
[40:20] my soul.
[40:24] Amen. God bless you today. Turn around,
[40:26] shake hands with somebody standing near
[40:27] you. Make them welcome. We got a number
[40:29] of visitors with us today. Amen. Happy
[40:32] to have all of you here in the house of
[40:35] the Lord. Amen. Always good to see a a
[40:39] church full of believers gathered around
[40:41] ready for the word of God. Are your
[40:42] hearts ready and prepared? Amen. I uh
[40:45] we're thrilled today. We got a banner
[40:47] day all day today. Wonderful time. Amen.
[40:50] Brother Matthew uh and Sister Gabrielle
[40:53] here with us with their family and we're
[40:55] happy to have them here with us. Amen.
[40:59] Our
[41:02] brother Matthew has actually preached
[41:04] with brother Matt McGary in services and
[41:07] u this will be today be my first time
[41:09] hearing him preach live as far as I
[41:11] remember. I'm pretty sure that's true. I
[41:13] think I've heard him speak before but uh
[41:16] as far as a full-on sermon expectations
[41:18] are high. I appreciate a brother who is
[41:22] well taught in the word and uh he said
[41:24] to me paid you all a nice compliment. He
[41:26] said, "I know I'm at a church who are
[41:28] well established in the word of God."
[41:30] Amen. So, we're thankful to God for
[41:32] that. Amen. Friends, if it wasn't for
[41:35] this message, we would have very little
[41:36] to say, very little to say. This would
[41:38] be just your average Sunday morning
[41:40] pullpit. And um there's value in that.
[41:43] But when you're when you're in the house
[41:45] of God and the true word and the full
[41:47] word is being proclaimed, you're
[41:48] guaranteed to hear things you won't
[41:50] normally hear in the average Sunday
[41:52] morning pull pit. So, we want to make
[41:54] Brother Matt feel completely welcome.
[41:56] Give him his complete liberty. I've
[41:58] already done that. I want you to have
[42:00] your hearts ready. Pull on the word of
[42:02] God. Amen. That you're the one, Brother
[42:04] Brandham said, you're the one operates
[42:05] the gift. See, the preacher gets himself
[42:07] out of the way. It's you pulling with
[42:09] your needs. Let's sing it again as we
[42:11] invite Brother Matt to the pull pit.
[42:13] Sweep over my soul. Sweep over
[42:19] my soul.
[42:21] Sweep over
[42:24] my soul.
[42:28] Sweet spirit.
[42:30] Oh yes. Sweet over
[42:34] my soul.
[42:37] [Music]
[42:39] &gt;&gt; My rest
[42:43] is complete.
[42:46] All I see
[42:49] at your feet,
[42:52] sweet spirit,
[42:56] sweep over
[42:58] my soul.
[43:01] Sing it again now. Sweep over my soul.
[43:05] Sweep over
[43:07] my soul.
[43:10] [Music]
[43:11] Sweep over
[43:14] my soul.
[43:17] Sweet spirit,
[43:20] sweep over
[43:23] my soul.
[43:26] [Music]
[43:28] For my rest
[43:32] is complete.
[43:34] Well, while I sit
[43:38] at your feet.
[43:41] [Music]
[43:44] sweep over
[43:47] my soul.
[43:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Is there anybody here
[43:53] that's ever felt his presence come by
[43:55] your way? And and you just say, "Lord, I
[43:59] want you to sweep over my soul once
[44:00] again." Just as we have the musicians,
[44:03] if they just continue to uh to play,
[44:07] maybe there's somebody here and you have
[44:08] a need,
[44:10] maybe in your body,
[44:12] maybe a lost loved one,
[44:15] and you want to be like Rahab and say,
[44:17] "I want to get them all in."
[44:20] &gt;&gt; It's going home time, church. I I I say
[44:23] uh the time of laying up treasures in
[44:26] this life should be over for the
[44:27] believer. You know, we get so focused on
[44:30] a new car and a new house and a better
[44:33] career and a better job and and we start
[44:35] to lose focus and and we get lulled to
[44:39] sleep by Lady Oia and and the grind and
[44:42] the race of everything. And I say, Lord,
[44:44] let's let's refocus this morning. And I
[44:47] want to say, you know, tomorrow's not
[44:49] guaranteed,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; but what we do have is right now.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say there's nothing
[44:56] like his presence.
[44:59] You have an uplifted hand, a request,
[45:03] and we'll pray that the Lord will just
[45:05] sweep by. Once again, I want to tell
[45:08] you, there's nothing like his presence.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like when he comes
[45:14] &gt;&gt; to you personally. Oh, it might be
[45:18] wonderful of the outp point of the
[45:19] blessings in a group setting, but when
[45:21] he comes down to your row and your aisle
[45:23] and your chair, he starts to wrap his
[45:26] arms around you and say, "It's going to
[45:27] be all right. I I've been there the
[45:30] whole time. I know what you're going
[45:31] through and and I just want to talk to
[45:33] you a little bit. I want to talk to you
[45:34] a little while. I want to let you know
[45:35] that I got it all under control." Lord
[45:38] Jesus, we're so thankful
[45:40] &gt;&gt; to live a to serve a a living God. Not a
[45:44] God that's just some God way off yonder
[45:48] out in the space somewhere, but you're a
[45:50] present God right here, present with us,
[45:53] Lord. And you said, "I'll not only be
[45:55] with you, but I'll be in you until the
[45:58] end, Lord. There's been many hands that
[46:01] have been lifted up,
[46:03] Lord. There's needs in our body and in
[46:06] our lives, Lord. And
[46:08] Lord, many times there's needs that we
[46:11] don't even know we have.
[46:13] But as your word comes, you start to
[46:15] minister and to deal with our heart
[46:18] because your word is a discerner of the
[46:20] thought and intent of the heart. So
[46:23] Lord, may we just start to look to the
[46:25] supernatural this morning and get out of
[46:28] the routine as the prophet would say.
[46:29] Sometimes we got to get out of the
[46:31] routine long enough to get saved, Lord.
[46:33] And Lord, I say, Lord, come come to my
[46:35] aisle. Come to my chair, Lord. Father,
[46:38] even I'm standing behind the sacred
[46:39] desk, Lord, but I need more of you,
[46:41] Lord. I need more, Holy Ghost. I need
[46:43] more revelation, Lord. I need answers. I
[46:46] need direction. I need your leadership,
[46:48] Lord. And Father, I know you're here to
[46:51] do exceedingly abundantly more than we
[46:53] could ever think or ask. So, we just
[46:55] commit the preaching of the word to you,
[46:56] Lord. Ask that you would come, Lord, and
[46:59] break the bread of life as only you can,
[47:02] Lord. But I'm always reminded of that
[47:04] little boy who come and the multitudes
[47:05] were there and he just had a little fish
[47:08] and some little loaves. How could that
[47:11] Lord feed the multitude? But when it was
[47:14] placed into your hands, Lord, a little
[47:16] was enough. And it was more than enough.
[47:21] Lord, may as we would go from this
[47:23] place, Lord, may your word be more than
[47:25] enough.
[47:27] and may they have plenty to go share
[47:30] with those they come in contact with.
[47:32] Lord, we love you. We ask these
[47:34] blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[47:37] Praise the Lord. Wow. Just good to be in
[47:39] his presence.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; My what a what an honor and privilege.
[47:42] We thank you musicians. If you have your
[47:44] Bibles, we'll be reading out of John. I
[47:47] just want to say what a what a an honor
[47:49] and a privilege it is to stand here
[47:51] before you. I I just want to let you
[47:53] know I love Brother Jason uh and his
[47:56] ministry.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; I I've I've just always cherished it and
[48:00] marveled at at the gift of God and and
[48:03] we're just so thankful that God would
[48:05] place uh uh gifts in the body. We know
[48:07] that the five-fold ministry is for the
[48:09] edifying and the perfecting of the
[48:11] saints and I've I've had opportunity to
[48:13] minister uh with brother Matt and and uh
[48:16] I just come to know and appreciate him
[48:18] and his family and it's just good to be
[48:21] here. Are y'all interested in the word?
[48:25] &gt;&gt; I say, why don't we just relax oursel in
[48:26] his presence?
[48:28] &gt;&gt; I I want to tell you, I believe the
[48:30] message.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I'm just going to preach the
[48:34] message. Is that all right?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz, uh, as as brother Jason said, I I
[48:38] mean, I I ain't even the prophet said, I
[48:40] ain't got a thought coming.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; So, I I ain't none of this is mine. I'm
[48:45] just going to rehearse some things
[48:47] that's maybe familiar to you and maybe
[48:49] by the grace of God, the Holy Ghost will
[48:50] come by and just start speaking to each
[48:52] individual. We're reading in John
[48:54] chapter 8
[48:57] and we'll read the first
[49:00] 12 verses there. I like to hear the the
[49:03] pages turning.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:10] All right.
[49:12] And early in the morning, he came again
[49:15] into the temple, and all the people came
[49:16] unto him, and he sat down and taught
[49:19] them. The scribes and the Pharisees
[49:22] brought unto him a woman taken in
[49:24] adultery.
[49:25] When they had set her in the midst, my
[49:29] could you imagine?
[49:32] They say unto him, Master,
[49:35] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[49:37] very act. Now Moses in the law commanded
[49:41] us that such should be stoned. But what
[49:44] sayest thou?
[49:46] This they said tempting him that they
[49:49] might have to accuse him. Oh my. Isn't
[49:52] Isn't Satan an accuser of the brethren?
[49:55] &gt;&gt; I say God forbid that we ever take up
[49:57] that spirit
[49:58] &gt;&gt; to be an accuser of our brothers and our
[50:00] sisters. Love covers a multitude of sin.
[50:03] Yeah.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; But Jesus stooped down and with his
[50:06] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[50:09] heard them not. I tell you, sometimes
[50:11] that's what we got to do.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; So when they continued asking him, he
[50:18] lifted himself up and said unto them,
[50:20] "He that is without sin among you, let
[50:23] him first cast a stone at her." And
[50:26] again he stooped down and wrote on the
[50:28] ground. And they which heard it, being
[50:30] convict convicted by their own
[50:32] conscience, went out. And one by one,
[50:35] beginning at the eldest, even unto the
[50:37] last,
[50:39] Jesus was left alone. And the woman
[50:42] standing in the midst. Isn't that
[50:45] amazing? All of her accusers were gone
[50:48] &gt;&gt; and she was just left standing alone.
[50:49] And there was only one. And when Jesus
[50:53] had lifted up himself and saw none but
[50:56] the woman, he said unto her,"Woman,
[51:01] where are those thine accusers?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Hath no man condemned thee?"
[51:08] She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said
[51:11] unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go
[51:15] and sin
[51:16] &gt;&gt; no more."
[51:18] Then spake Jesus again unto them,
[51:20] saying, I am the light of the world. He
[51:25] that followeth me shall not walk in
[51:27] darkness, but shall have the light of
[51:32] life. Amen. You may be seated.
[51:40] I hope it's all right to take off my
[51:41] jacket, but I I I I have come to know
[51:45] Brother Jason and brother Matt well, so
[51:47] I'm just going to make myself at home.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say this in
[51:52] shalom. He would say, "The Son is the
[51:55] word of God. In the beginning, God said,
[51:58] "Let there be light." And when the
[52:00] manifested word of God, when the word of
[52:02] God was manifested, there was light.
[52:04] First, God spoke it. What if it didn't
[52:06] manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. But
[52:10] when he spoke it and then it was
[52:11] manifested, vindicated, his word was
[52:13] vindicated. Light come into existence.
[52:16] And that's the only way it can be done
[52:18] now is when the word is vindicated.
[52:21] God's written word vindicated. Then it
[52:23] shows light. It it's it's a portion is
[52:26] lit or put out for each age. We find in
[52:29] the church ages. We find in the Old
[52:30] Testament church ages, each time that
[52:32] there come a time for a certain
[52:34] manifestation of the journey, there was
[52:36] a prophet come on the earth and the word
[52:38] came to the prophet and he made that
[52:40] word live. And when that word was
[52:43] identified, it reflected God and there
[52:45] was the age, there was the light and
[52:47] that's the way light comes today. And
[52:50] that's what I'd like to minister to you
[52:51] on is the way light comes today. So the
[52:54] word came to the prophet and he made
[52:57] that word live. It was light to the age.
[52:59] And in John 1 and6, it would say there
[53:02] was a man sent from God whose name was
[53:04] John. The same came for a witness to
[53:06] bear witness of the light that all men
[53:09] through him might believe. And then John
[53:11] uh Christ would come back in John 5:35
[53:13] and he would say speaking of John, he
[53:15] say he was a burning and shining light
[53:18] and you were willing for a season to
[53:20] rejoice in his light. And as we just
[53:23] moved to to lay in a foundation, brother
[53:26] Brandham says this further in shalom. He
[53:27] says John was the light. He was more
[53:31] light than Elijah and them had. Elijah,
[53:34] he wasn't Elijah's light, but he was
[53:36] Elijah in another form of vindicating
[53:38] the light. See, he was. And when Jesus
[53:41] come, he said he was a burn, a bright
[53:43] and shining light for a season. You love
[53:45] to walk in his light. See, and John
[53:47] said, "Now I must dim out. I must go
[53:49] out. My light's finished shining." Ain't
[53:52] that something? And he said, "I must go
[53:54] out. He must increase. He's the light."
[53:57] And he said, "I am the light of the
[53:59] world." Right? Amen. That's right. The
[54:01] same yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[54:03] still the light of the world. And what
[54:06] is he? In the beginning was the word,
[54:08] and the word was with God. Why? Why? Why
[54:11] was he the light of the world? If he'd
[54:14] come and said he was the Messiah, and he
[54:16] didn't do like the Bible said the
[54:19] Messiah would do, then he wasn't the
[54:21] light of the world. See, it's the
[54:23] vindicated word that makes it the light
[54:25] of the world. The prophet showing you
[54:27] that all the prophets and everybody that
[54:29] had spoke of what the Messiah would be,
[54:32] here come the word. In the beginning was
[54:34] the word and the word was made flesh and
[54:36] the word uh uh dwelt among us. And so if
[54:39] he was the Messiah, then he would be
[54:42] fulfilling the scriptures that was
[54:43] spoken of the Messiah to do. Yes.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And if he was the Messiah, then he would
[54:49] be doing and fulfilling that word that
[54:51] was spoken. And so, we're understanding
[54:53] the principle that he's throwing out
[54:55] here that the word of God made manifest
[54:57] is the light. And and we could take some
[55:00] time, we had to cut away from some
[55:02] things, but the prophet of God would
[55:03] talk about how Moses was the light of
[55:05] his hour. And a and just maybe just to
[55:07] throw this in there to anchor this down,
[55:09] the prophet of God would say Moses might
[55:11] have not even known himself. But he was
[55:14] the anointed word of the day. He was the
[55:16] anointed messenger. So if he was the
[55:18] messenger of the hour, he was the
[55:20] Messiah of the hour. He was the anointed
[55:23] one. So So I just showing in the
[55:25] principle just as the scripture said,
[55:27] I'll send a deliverer. And you know, as
[55:29] Abraham knew his people would sojourn
[55:30] for 400 years, but God would send a
[55:32] deliverer. So when Moses came, Moses now
[55:35] was the vindicated word. Moses was light
[55:38] to the people.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He was the anointed word. And brother
[55:41] Brandon would go so far to say that he
[55:43] was the Messiah of the hour because it
[55:46] was the word of God being manifested to
[55:49] the people. It was God's deliverance. It
[55:51] was God's life. It was God's provided
[55:54] way.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So we could we could run through types
[55:58] and shadows and and we laid in that
[56:00] quote talking about John. John was the
[56:02] life. Uh but what what ultimately was he
[56:04] doing? He was introducing the Messiah.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; So we know that Jesus was the anointed
[56:10] word,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; is the anointed word.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; He is the anointed Messiah.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; But I just maybe jumping because I I I
[56:19] uh I I I just want to move quickly. Now
[56:22] with all of this in mind, we we look at
[56:24] the types and the shadows in the Old
[56:26] Testament and and moving all the way up.
[56:28] And now uh uh uh Christ, he's fulfilling
[56:30] all that was spoken.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Right. Every prophecy, everything uh uh
[56:35] uh concerning as he came to the earth
[56:38] was being fulfilled in his earthly
[56:39] ministry.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Right. And now here here's here's Christ
[56:45] speaking to his disciples.
[56:48] And and like I said, I'm so thankful
[56:51] that you're well taught. So I I know I'm
[56:53] I'm jumping and jumping and and there's
[56:55] so much we could lay in there. Uh but uh
[56:58] now now think of this here here in John
[57:00] 16:7.
[57:03] Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It
[57:06] is expedient for for you that I go away.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; For if I go not away, the comforter will
[57:14] not come unto you.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; But if I depart, I will send him unto
[57:18] you.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; It's better. It's it's more profitable
[57:21] that I go away. Could you imagine
[57:23] sitting there? If we were standing here,
[57:25] here's the Lord Jesus and everything
[57:27] we've been believing for and looking
[57:29] for. My this this is the Messiah. All
[57:32] the prophets in Malachi and Isaiah and
[57:34] Moses, they all spoke of the one that's
[57:36] coming, our redeemer, our Messiah. He
[57:39] He's taken on flesh. He's standing in
[57:41] our midst. Here he is,
[57:43] &gt;&gt; but I got to go away.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; I I got to leave. And that's profitable.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; How is that a good thing, Lord?
[57:53] You're everything we've been looking
[57:54] for. You're you're everything that we
[57:56] ever needed. We left our jobs. We We
[57:59] left our careers. We left our family
[58:01] members. We left everything to follow
[58:04] you. And now you're telling me that
[58:05] you're going away. How is that
[58:07] profitable? Lord, I don't understand.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, what what are you wanting to do?
[58:14] What? I I I can't understand this
[58:20] because what is he wanting to do? It's
[58:24] profitable that I go away. It's a better
[58:27] thing.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; If I could say it like this,
[58:32] I see the Lord standing there. See this
[58:34] body that you see now,
[58:37] you're not going to see this body again
[58:40] until the meeting in the air, but I'm
[58:42] going away. But I am coming back to you.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that's in this body,
[58:48] this body's going away. But I want to
[58:49] come back and I want to use your body.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Look, I I've taken on on form and in
[58:56] this in this flesh and in this body, but
[58:58] I I want to go away because I just don't
[59:01] want to fulfill the word in this body. I
[59:03] want to fulfill the word in your body. I
[59:06] I want to come down in a many member
[59:08] bride body and I want to manifest the
[59:10] written word. I want to manifest the
[59:12] spoken word. It's profitable that I go
[59:14] away because I want to come again in
[59:15] you.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to lay this in there
[59:20] because the prophet of God would say
[59:22] this. He says, I challenge you to
[59:24] believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in
[59:26] the form of the son of man in human
[59:28] flesh in the bride's body accept his
[59:32] call. I say, Lord, I don't understand
[59:35] maybe how everything is going. And as
[59:37] those disciples were saying there, Lord,
[59:38] I don't know how that's profitable. But
[59:40] I say one thing, Lord. I want to accept
[59:41] your call.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; I I mean, hey, maybe maybe we've done a
[59:47] lot of learning and maybe we've been
[59:49] real educated. Maybe we know what the
[59:50] prophet said, but I say we want to
[59:52] accept his call and not just
[59:54] intellectually by a revelation, by a
[59:56] translation.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Now, then Jesus would say this. So, we
[1:00:04] understand that he is the light. But he
[1:00:07] comes and says in Matthew 5:14, "Ye are
[1:00:10] the light of the world." A city that is
[1:00:13] set on a hill cannot be hid. And I just
[1:00:16] as I was reading that scripture, I I got
[1:00:18] to thinking, "Oh my, a city that is set
[1:00:21] on a hill." And I got to thinking about
[1:00:22] the new Jerusalem. And and in
[1:00:24] Revelations, John would say, I saw the
[1:00:26] new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven
[1:00:29] like a bride adorned for his husband. I
[1:00:31] want to tell you, uh, you are that city.
[1:00:34] You are that new Jerusalem. And we have
[1:00:36] been set up on a rock of revelation. In
[1:00:39] the time of trouble, I shall set you up
[1:00:42] upon a rock. Oh, we have received the
[1:00:44] opening of the word, a revelation. You
[1:00:47] are that city.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; I say each one of you, you ought to
[1:00:51] accept his call that he wants to be
[1:00:53] Christ, the anointed word,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; the son of man ministry in your body.
[1:00:58] Oh, brother Matthew, that was just for
[1:01:00] the prophet. No, Jesus said it's
[1:01:02] expedient that I go away.
[1:01:05] That might have been a first one to
[1:01:07] maturity, but he ran his race. He ran
[1:01:09] his course. He He's already gone home to
[1:01:12] his reward. He's gone away. But now God
[1:01:14] is saying, just as I manifested myself
[1:01:17] in a first one to maturity, it was only
[1:01:20] testifying of the wheat field that I
[1:01:22] have planted.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; And you are that seed. You are that
[1:01:28] word.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; You are that new Jerusalem.
[1:01:35] You are You have been lifted up. You've
[1:01:38] been raised up out of Lady of Sea. Out
[1:01:40] of out of the dead traditions of
[1:01:41] denominations, you've been set up upon a
[1:01:44] rock.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not This bride is not
[1:01:48] wondering and and where am I going? What
[1:01:52] am I supposed to do? And uh who are we?
[1:01:54] And look, we know what we're doing.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; We know where we're going.
[1:02:00] We have thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; The word being vindicated in our lives.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; And when that word that was spoken
[1:02:11] takes on flesh in you,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; that's the vindicated word.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got too much. I got I got Christ
[1:02:20] the mystery of God revealed. I got the
[1:02:22] invisible union.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; When that word
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; takes on flesh in you, it is light.
[1:02:29] It's the vindicated word.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; And Jesus would say now in Matthew 5:16,
[1:02:38] "Let your light so shine before men that
[1:02:42] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:02:44] your father which is in heaven."
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Look, this book right here is not going
[1:02:48] to walk off the pulpit.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. This book right here is not
[1:02:52] going to walk off the pulpit and go to
[1:02:54] your job.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to take the book.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; You got to eat the book. And your life
[1:03:02] must prophesy again.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, it ain't good enough just to quote
[1:03:06] the quotes. You got to live this
[1:03:07] message. And I want to tell you, it
[1:03:08] ain't a bunch of rules and regulations
[1:03:11] and dos and don'ts and if you do this,
[1:03:13] I'll do that. Oh, I want to tell you I I
[1:03:15] just comes to mind. God made an
[1:03:17] unconditional covenant with Abraham. It
[1:03:19] wasn't about what Abraham could do. It
[1:03:21] was about what God promised. And God
[1:03:23] promised, I'll have a bride without spot
[1:03:26] or angel. It ain't about what I can do.
[1:03:28] It's about what I can surrender myself
[1:03:30] to and let him have his way.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You got to take the book and eat it up.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; We are written epistles known and read
[1:03:42] of all men.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "The real way to
[1:03:45] testify is not in the church.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; It's out in dark places.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Let your shine, let your light shine
[1:03:52] where it's dark. Go to the road houses
[1:03:55] and different places and where sin and
[1:03:57] things is heaping and then let your
[1:03:59] light shine. There is the place to do
[1:04:02] it.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; My we we want to be a good Christian on
[1:04:07] Sunday. We want to be a good Christian
[1:04:09] on Wednesday. We want to testify to the
[1:04:11] brothers. We want to testify to the
[1:04:12] sisters. But what about your coworker?
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; What about your neighbor? What about the
[1:04:17] store clerk at the gas station? See, we
[1:04:19] want to we want to let our light shine
[1:04:22] where it can't be seen. Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe according to the
[1:04:27] message of the hour, the pillar of fire
[1:04:28] is here this morning.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Because each one of us bring our licks
[1:04:32] of fire. We bring a portion of the
[1:04:34] pillar of fire and we all come together.
[1:04:36] There's a great burning light swirling
[1:04:38] right now in Buford, South Carolina.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; When I say right now, we sit in a place
[1:04:43] where all things are possible.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; But we live in a dying world, a dying
[1:04:48] generation. Darkness, gross darkness
[1:04:50] upon the people. But arise and shine.
[1:04:54] Thy light has come.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; You are the light.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; So how are they going to see the light?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Well, that might not be popular, but
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; you know, I I remember the prophet of
[1:05:09] God said, you know, how many how many
[1:05:12] have the Holy Ghost? How many have the
[1:05:14] Holy Ghost? Okay, h we'll see if you
[1:05:17] have it or not. How many sigh and cry
[1:05:18] for the abominations?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz the ink the the the writer with the
[1:05:24] ink rider is going around market. I
[1:05:25] said, "Oh, God, forgive me."
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; I I'm just I I don't even care for lost
[1:05:30] souls, you know? I I go to work and I
[1:05:32] just want my paycheck and I want to go
[1:05:34] raise my kids and go on a rapture.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if Jesus Christ came
[1:05:39] to this earth and he said, "Well, I come
[1:05:40] to do my job, so where's my cross?"
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Not even interested.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say we got to have the love of God
[1:05:50] shed abroad in our heart.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; The word manifested is light. You are
[1:05:57] the light of the world.
[1:06:00] Look, I I I don't I don't think he's
[1:06:04] just a savior.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; I know he's a savior.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I I don't think he's just a healer. I I
[1:06:13] I know that he's a healer. I I just
[1:06:16] don't think he is a deliverer. I know
[1:06:20] because I've been delivered.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I I tell you, you know, I you don't have
[1:06:27] to uh uh when it's become a reality to
[1:06:29] you, you're not just rehearsing
[1:06:31] something that you've heard.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Look, has anybody ever been shocked or
[1:06:36] electrocuted?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Now, what? Explain to me what that feels
[1:06:41] like.
[1:06:44] It's kind of hard to do it.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; But if you've ever been electrified, you
[1:06:50] know you've been electrified.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, if you ever been
[1:06:53] saved, you know you've been saved. If
[1:06:56] you've ever been delivered, you know
[1:06:58] you've been delivered. And I want to
[1:06:59] say, if you've ever been set free from
[1:07:01] sin, oh, it sets your soul on fire.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; The word says
[1:07:12] it is the spirit that quickenth.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; The flesh profiteth you nothing, but the
[1:07:16] words that I speak unto you, they are
[1:07:19] spirit and they are life. The prophet of
[1:07:21] God said, life comes only by the word of
[1:07:24] God made manifest. He said, as long as
[1:07:26] it's just in the book like this, it can
[1:07:30] still be questioned.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you a lot of times you can
[1:07:35] go witness to people and you can go out
[1:07:37] and and you can tell people uh that God
[1:07:40] sent a prophet and and you can you can
[1:07:42] give them a track and and I want to tell
[1:07:44] you but you know what they can always
[1:07:46] question that
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; but I tell you one thing they can't
[1:07:51] question
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I once was lost
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; but now I'm found. I once was blind but
[1:07:58] now I see. You can question a lot of
[1:08:00] things like that blind man on that day.
[1:08:03] They they said, "Oh, oh, give God
[1:08:05] praise.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Tell us. We we we know that man is a
[1:08:10] sinner."
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And he looked at them. He said, "Look, I
[1:08:13] I don't know whether he's a sinner or
[1:08:15] whether he's not a sinner." And
[1:08:17] nowadays, they're all trying to trying
[1:08:19] to raise questions. Well, is he a true
[1:08:21] prophet or is he a false prophet? Well,
[1:08:23] all I can tell to you is you can call
[1:08:26] them whatever you want to call them, but
[1:08:28] I once was lost, but now I'm found. I
[1:08:31] once was blind, but now I see. This book
[1:08:34] was once closed, but now it's open.
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; You can question a lot of things, but
[1:08:40] you qu can't question my revelation.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:08:49] That's why you want to you you know the
[1:08:50] best way to witness is tell your tell
[1:08:52] how your candle got lit.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Because you you can you can give them a
[1:08:58] bunch of information.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; But you know what somebody wants to see?
[1:09:02] They they they want to see something
[1:09:04] real.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; They want to see something genuine. They
[1:09:07] want to see something. Hey, if God did
[1:09:09] that for you,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; he can do that for me.
[1:09:14] But just it's good to give information
[1:09:16] and seow seed. I I say there's nothing
[1:09:18] wrong with that at all. But I say you
[1:09:20] ought to get to a place where you can
[1:09:22] let your light shine.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; You can't question that.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't think this message is
[1:09:33] Christ.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; I know this message is Christ.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I know it's the anointed word. I know
[1:09:41] it's God's provided way. I know it's
[1:09:44] taken me into my body change. I know
[1:09:46] it's taken me into a rat. Look, you can
[1:09:48] question a lot of things and a lot of
[1:09:51] men have fallen away because it's
[1:09:52] harvest time. Those seeds have to
[1:09:54] manifest who they are. But oh, there is
[1:09:56] another seed. There is the royal seed of
[1:09:58] Abraham and they have heard from their
[1:10:01] theophony and they also are manifesting
[1:10:04] the very spoken word of God and ye are
[1:10:06] the light. Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Now in 1 John 15 and 6 just speaking
[1:10:13] along those lines he says this then is
[1:10:15] the message which we have heard of him
[1:10:18] and declare unto you that God is light
[1:10:22] and in him is no darkness at all.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Friends, there's no darkness in the word
[1:10:28] of God.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; There is no darkness in the revealed
[1:10:32] word that we've received. There is no
[1:10:34] darkness in the the message of Malachi
[1:10:36] 4:5, Luke 17:30.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Look, you you might have questions and I
[1:10:42] want to say questions are good to have
[1:10:44] unless you're questioning its authority.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; You know, I I've witnessed to people and
[1:10:51] uh and they they they didn't have any
[1:10:53] questions.
[1:10:55] Uh that's actually kind of alarming.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; They're like they're just good with
[1:11:00] everything. I mean, yeah, you know,
[1:11:02] you're just

[1:11:07] searching,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; you Anybody ever look for a good
[1:11:10] restaurant to eat at?

[1:11:22] 4.5 4.6. Oh, but this one gots more
[1:11:25] reviews than that one. And and well, why
[1:11:27] what are some of the bad reviews in
[1:11:28] there? Oh, it's because of the weight.
[1:11:29] there. All the bad reviews are because
[1:11:30] they had to wait an hour for the food.
[1:11:32] That means that's good food.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's not a bad review. That's a good
[1:11:37] review. Hey man, the food's so good you
[1:11:39] can't even get in there.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; But you want to have if somebody's
[1:11:44] telling you, "Hey, take this. This is
[1:11:45] really good. Eat it. Eat eat it." Well,
[1:11:46] what has it done for you?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; How many times have you eaten there? Or
[1:11:51] every time in the air, I tell you what,
[1:11:52] that's actually a destin. I go out out
[1:11:54] of my way to eat there.
[1:11:58] Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's why you come this morning.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; While the rest of the world is sleeping
[1:12:04] in and watching their ball games, you've
[1:12:06] got a hold of some mana. You've come in
[1:12:09] behind the veil. You're shut away in a
[1:12:11] secret place in a hidden life. You say,
[1:12:12] "Lord, give me that hidden mana. I want
[1:12:15] more. I've tasted. Oh, taste and see
[1:12:18] that the Lord, I can't get enough of
[1:12:19] this.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Give me some more. Give me some more.
[1:12:26] You get people that are uh church
[1:12:27] hopping and bouncing all over the place
[1:12:30] expecting some man to feed them. I tell
[1:12:31] you what, if you can get past the veil
[1:12:33] just one time and come into his presence
[1:12:36] and the angel of the Lord come and start
[1:12:38] feeding your soul with the revealed word
[1:12:40] of the eye, it'll sustain your wants.
[1:12:42] It'll sustain your desires.
[1:12:44] [Applause]
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; then you can be God to a church.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; So many people just want to go to the
[1:12:51] church and have the church fix their
[1:12:52] problems. pastor, fix my life. Fix my
[1:12:56] marriage.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I got a bunch of problems. Well, praise
[1:12:59] God, we got God called Cold, man. But
[1:13:01] that's just a vessel.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And the only thing he wants to do is
[1:13:06] introduce you to Christ.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; And I've said it again. I I said it
[1:13:13] before and I'll say it again. You know,
[1:13:14] I don't think when those disciples
[1:13:17] busted out of the upper room on the day
[1:13:19] of Pentecost, they didn't need no
[1:13:21] counseling. Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They were so filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:26] they could stand there and say, "I am
[1:13:29] the light of the world. This is that
[1:13:31] which the prophet Joel spoke of. I will
[1:13:34] pour out my spirit upon all flesh." And
[1:13:36] I want to say, if that same spirit that
[1:13:39] raised up Jesus Christ from the dead,
[1:13:41] dwell in you, it will quicken your life.
[1:13:44] It will quicken your thoughts. It will
[1:13:45] quicken your marriage.
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] I haven't lost my mind. I know what I'm
[1:13:53] talking about.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; It ain't just in a book.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; It's in my soul. It's in my life. It's
[1:14:00] in my mind. It's in my thoughts. It's on
[1:14:03] my lips.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's in my car.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; It's on my computer. It's in my phone.
[1:14:10] It's in my marriage. It's in my kids.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; The only person that should need
[1:14:20] counseling around you is the devil.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; I got a quote
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; that a man could be so surrendered
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; till the devil don't know what to do
[1:14:31] with you
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; now. Quit acting like that's a challenge
[1:14:37] if you can do that
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and start recognizing it's a promise
[1:14:40] that you will. Wow.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Look, it was impossible for Abraham and
[1:14:46] Sarah to have a child,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; but he judged him faithful who gave the
[1:14:51] promise and he was strong in faith.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Giving glory unto God.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Well, then don't sherk back.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Devil,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; you're not going to know what to do with
[1:15:05] me
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; because
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; the word is becoming flesh
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; and the flesh is becoming word
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; and I'm becoming so much like the
[1:15:16] bridegroom.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; We are one.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; You have a ministry. Yes.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Now, if you come to church like that,
[1:15:28] it's like I tell people in situations,
[1:15:31] you know, somebody got to be God in the
[1:15:33] situation.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Well, brother said that and this brother
[1:15:36] said somebody somebody got to be the
[1:15:38] word.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Somebody somebody got to be God.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; No one wants to be God.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants everybody else to be
[1:15:45] God.
[1:15:47] Well, man, if they would just be a real
[1:15:48] message believer,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; if they really believed the message,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; if they really had a revelation,
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; if they really caught the opening of the
[1:15:58] word,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; well, praise God, the prophet didn't act
[1:16:02] like that.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; We got to let our light shine.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Give me something big
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; to shine my light in. Okay, I will.
[1:16:14] Children, sweep the floor.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, I got kids here.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Sweep the floor.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Do the dishes.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, preacher?
[1:16:25] That's shining your light.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Well, well, well, give me the big
[1:16:30] things.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't too big for the prophet
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; to come home.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; The wife's nervous and frustrated. Kids
[1:16:38] are all crying and everything.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; He come in and what did he do? He was in
[1:16:43] his position.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Oh. We We want the big great
[1:16:47] things to do,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; but we want our our wife to keep the
[1:16:50] home and fix all the problems. Honey, I
[1:16:52] worked all day. Will you Where's my
[1:16:55] dinner? Why the kids fussing?

[1:16:59] eight hours. She works 24/7.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Honey, I'm going hunting.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Where are we at? Let's get out of here.
[1:17:09] But no, you're called to be in your
[1:17:11] position and shine your light in the
[1:17:13] home.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Shine your light on them dirty dishes.
[1:17:18] Shine the light on them dirty floors.
[1:17:20] Make your bed. Pick up the trash. Mow
[1:17:22] the lawn. Be a real Christian. Clean
[1:17:24] your truck.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Act like what you got, God gave it to
[1:17:28] you. We treat the things that good
[1:17:30] that's been given to us like we got it
[1:17:32] from the devil. Like we got it from
[1:17:33] Lady. Like we we got it from the from
[1:17:36] from somewhere else. We treat it like
[1:17:37] garbage and throw it in the corner. Can
[1:17:39] I say, man, if God's blessed you with a
[1:17:41] car, if he's I don't care if it's an
[1:17:43] apartment in the hood, you ought to keep
[1:17:45] it so clean and spotless
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; that when somebody would come in there,
[1:17:49] they would say, "My it's a nice place to
[1:17:52] be." Oh, just like the prophet one day,
[1:17:55] there was a woman crying out for her
[1:17:56] boy. She said, "Oh, God, I I I was like
[1:18:00] that uh that woman that had that child
[1:18:03] that was dying, and she said, "Where's
[1:18:05] my Elijah?
[1:18:07] And he come down into the hood and he
[1:18:09] was walking down there and there as he
[1:18:11] was saying as your mother was hanging
[1:18:13] there on the fence said good morning
[1:18:14] parson he said when he come into that
[1:18:16] home oh that was a home where somebody
[1:18:18] knew how to pray
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you got a a 25,000 foot
[1:18:26] home if God ain't in it ain't a good
[1:18:28] place to be. But if you got a 5x5 sale
[1:18:31] and you've been locked up, if Jesus
[1:18:34] Christ is in there, that's a place I
[1:18:36] want to be.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know where we're at, but we're
[1:18:42] going to come. Let your light shine.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Take care of the things that God gave
[1:18:48] you.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Minister to your wife. Minister your
[1:18:50] kids. You kids, you ain't too young to
[1:18:52] minister to your parents.
[1:18:58] Your battlefield is in your home. Your
[1:19:00] battlefield is in school.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, we're going in a body
[1:19:05] change. We're going in a rapture.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And you young, you young men, this
[1:19:10] message is not above you.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; You are the message. You young ladies,
[1:19:14] God's interested in you. He wants to
[1:19:17] fill you and use you to sweep on the
[1:19:19] coming of the Lord. Look, I want to tell
[1:19:21] you I out there in the world, if it's
[1:19:24] gotten so dark and so grim that 10 year
[1:19:27] olds are committing murder.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; So much so 8-year-olds and
[1:19:31] six-year-olds, they're being possessed
[1:19:33] by devil spirits. I say if if the devil
[1:19:36] can do that out in the world, what about
[1:19:38] the revealed word of the hour? Have we
[1:19:40] not a message of the hour to get our
[1:19:42] family under the token where they can be
[1:19:44] born again and filled with the Holy
[1:19:46] Ghost? Our 5year-olds, our sixy olds,
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Look, if the devil's able to get him
[1:19:53] that young,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; there ain't no age too young.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; So much so that the Bible says that John
[1:20:05] the Baptist was filled with the Holy
[1:20:06] Ghost from his mother's womb.
[1:20:08] So, I don't know how it's going to
[1:20:10] happen, but I believe when that sweet
[1:20:13] comes, even if it's the baby in your
[1:20:15] womb,
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; in a moment, in a twinkling of eye,
[1:20:18] we're all going to be changed.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; We got to let our light shine. Church,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; let it shine in the community. Let it
[1:20:24] shine in your house. Let it shine in the
[1:20:26] dark places.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; You can question a lot of things, but oh
[1:20:31] my, when it's made real in you, there's
[1:20:35] no darkness in this word. Going on and
[1:20:37] reading that scripture, 1 John 1 and6.
[1:20:40] Now he says, "If we say that we have
[1:20:42] fellowship with him and walk in
[1:20:43] darkness, we lie
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and do not the truth."
[1:20:49] Well, I know we don't like that.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; But it's the word.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "If you don't
[1:20:55] have works with your faith, it shows you
[1:20:58] haven't got faith. You're just talking
[1:21:00] from your mouth."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I've met some of them.
[1:21:07] I I've met some people that are just
[1:21:08] talking from their mouth. You look, you
[1:21:10] you can you might be able to fool men,
[1:21:12] but you can't fool God.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I said, you might be able to fool men,
[1:21:17] but you can't fool God.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus would would even stand
[1:21:21] there and say, "Oh, you hypocrites."
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Well, did the prophet Isaiah say, "You
[1:21:27] draw nigh with your mouth. You honor me
[1:21:30] with your lips, but what? Your heart is
[1:21:32] far from me."
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know, I think maybe we
[1:21:36] need to deal some some heart trouble in
[1:21:37] the church this morning.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What is it? It's heart trouble.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Oh. What are you talking about,
[1:21:45] preacher? Well, let me tell you. In
[1:21:47] Jeremiah 17:9, it says, "The heart is a
[1:21:49] deceitful is deceitful above all
[1:21:51] things."
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And desperately wicked,
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; who can know it?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I the Lord search the heart. I try the
[1:22:00] reigns even to give every man according
[1:22:02] to his ways and according to the fruit
[1:22:04] of his doings. Look, people honor the
[1:22:06] message. They honor the prophet. They
[1:22:09] quote the quotes.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; They go to church.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you, where's the life?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Where's the good works?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Where's the fruit of the spirit?
[1:22:19] By this you will know that they are my
[1:22:23] disciples,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; by their backbiting,
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; by their gossiping,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; by their questioning one another, by
[1:22:33] their pointing fingers at one another,
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; by their their good deeds and how much
[1:22:38] uh they've given to charity.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; No. By their perfect record at church.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I get to church 20 minutes early. to
[1:22:48] have you to know.
[1:22:50] And I go to church three times a week.
[1:22:53] And little did you know that third one
[1:22:56] I'm talking about cuz we're only open uh
[1:22:58] Wednesday and Sunday, but I stream also
[1:23:00] for extra credit.
[1:23:04] I am a real message believer.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:23:13] By this,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; they will know
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; that ye have love one for another.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? Oh, if if if if I had
[1:23:25] the gift of prophecy, if I knew all the
[1:23:28] mysteries, if I had faith to remove
[1:23:30] mountains,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; but you don't have charity.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't profit you anything.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Jesus says. Oh,
[1:23:39] I shouldn't say exactly, but Jesus also
[1:23:41] says this in Matthew 7:20. He says,
[1:23:43] "Wherefore, by their fruits you shall
[1:23:45] know them."
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; By their fruits.
[1:23:50] Does anybody know what that means?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Means by their fruits.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You should know them.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; But see, I I it's not it's not just you
[1:23:59] can't make it, oh h just so uh uh
[1:24:02] structured and oh, we go to church and
[1:24:04] we believe the same thing.
[1:24:07] No, the Sadducees and Pharisees would
[1:24:08] have had us all beat
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; by their fruits. You know, I what I do
[1:24:14] for a profession is I'm a certified
[1:24:16] arborist, a tree doctor. You know, I I I
[1:24:18] cut trees, trim trees, plant trees,
[1:24:20] treat trees, you know, if they're sick.
[1:24:22] We we, you know, the people call the
[1:24:24] tree doctor. I go out there and look at
[1:24:25] the tree and and we try to diagnose and
[1:24:28] what's wrong with it. And, you know, and
[1:24:29] sometimes uh uh you know, there might be
[1:24:31] a tree that's uh sprouting up. You know,
[1:24:34] it can be very hard to tell what a tree
[1:24:36] is uh when it first starts to grow. You
[1:24:38] know, it could be a little sapling there
[1:24:39] and and you can see the see the leaves
[1:24:41] just starting to bloom out and it it can
[1:24:43] be very difficult, you know, to to try
[1:24:45] to to determine what it is. You're like,
[1:24:46] maybe that's an elm tree. Maybe that's
[1:24:48] an oak tree. I And you know, as you
[1:24:50] maybe can discern or you you learn more
[1:24:53] about plants, you can start to identify
[1:24:54] them even in their even in their uh seed
[1:24:56] form or even even in their infancy as
[1:24:58] they just start to sprout up, you can
[1:25:00] actually, oh, I know that that I know
[1:25:02] what that is. And and so I'll come out
[1:25:04] there on the job site and and I'll go
[1:25:06] around and and and I'll look at a tree
[1:25:07] and I'll say, "You're an apple tree." Or
[1:25:10] I'll say, "Uh, we don't got no apple
[1:25:12] trees out there, but uh you know, you
[1:25:14] got apple trees around here." Man,
[1:25:17] that's nice.
[1:25:19] We can't grow anything over there. No
[1:25:22] fruit trees. But you can tell them by
[1:25:23] their fruits. We got some pears out
[1:25:25] there. Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; If you can't identify it by its leaves
[1:25:29] and you can't identify it by its bark,
[1:25:32] you can identify it by its fruit
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; because you know them by their fruit,
[1:25:37] you know. And one one day I was just I
[1:25:39] was just thinking about that, you know.
[1:25:41] I was, you know, just thinking about how
[1:25:42] I'll go around and I and and and I'll
[1:25:44] I'll say you you you are an apple tree.
[1:25:47] And I'm there calling and and telling
[1:25:49] what that tree was and then it struck me
[1:25:51] because the trees are what? They're
[1:25:53] identified by their characteristics.
[1:25:55] Yeah.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going around and I'm saying
[1:25:57] and and then it struck me. I'm not
[1:25:59] telling that tree what it is.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I'm the tree doctor and you're an apple
[1:26:05] tree and and you're an oak tree. And
[1:26:07] then one day it struck me like, wait a
[1:26:09] second. I'm not the one telling what it
[1:26:11] is.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; The tree is declaring to me.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; It's telling me I'm an oak tree. Look at
[1:26:18] my big broad branches. Look at my my my
[1:26:20] the my the nuts and the fruit of the
[1:26:22] tree. I I I'm a I'm a live oak. Look
[1:26:25] over here. It's not like I'm not saying
[1:26:27] you're an apple tree. No, the apple tree
[1:26:29] is declaring I'm an apple tree. If you
[1:26:31] can't tell by my bark, if you can't tell
[1:26:33] by my limbs, if you can't tell by by the
[1:26:36] leaves, look at my fruit. I'm declaring
[1:26:38] to you, I'm an apple tree. Oh, and I say
[1:26:41] this message has come back to seed form
[1:26:43] again. You don't have to look at the
[1:26:45] bark. You don't have to look at the
[1:26:46] leaves. You can look at the fruit and
[1:26:48] you can say, "Hey, take a bite." The
[1:26:50] original word has come back to seed
[1:26:52] forth in the bride again. It's come back
[1:26:55] to fruit. It's come back to seed.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; This bride ought to be declaring,
[1:27:02] I am the bride. I am going in a rapture.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I am the word made flesh. I am
[1:27:09] justified. I am sanctified. I am filled
[1:27:13] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe my words,
[1:27:20] believe my works, they testify.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; But as long as it's in a book,
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; it can be questioned.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the way light comes
[1:27:33] today.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; When this word comes in you,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; you are the light.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; You know them by their fruits.
[1:27:49] The prophet of God said, "The world is
[1:27:51] one of the most chaotic times of
[1:27:53] darkness that it's ever stood in."
[1:27:56] And yet it's standing in again the most
[1:27:58] blessed light that ever did shine.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And there is the difference is just like
[1:28:04] it was in the beginning. Now watch
[1:28:06] closely. When there was gross darkness
[1:28:09] upon the earth and the spirit of God
[1:28:11] moved upon the face of the water and
[1:28:13] said, "Let there be light." And God
[1:28:16] separated the light from the darkness.
[1:28:18] And I believe that we are now living in
[1:28:21] that hour again. That when God is
[1:28:24] separating light from darkness and he's
[1:28:26] present to the other side of the world,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; that the light might be made manifest.
[1:28:34] I just want to maybe lay this in here.
[1:28:37] What he said, the spirit of God moved.
[1:28:39] And I believe the spirit of God is
[1:28:41] moving upon your life by the spoken
[1:28:43] word.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light of this message, the
[1:28:46] light of the revealed word is pressing
[1:28:48] the darkness out of your life. We we
[1:28:52] were reading first John in verse 7. It
[1:28:54] says, "But if we walk in the light as he
[1:28:56] is in the light, we have fellowship one
[1:28:58] with another, and the blood of Jesus
[1:28:59] Christ his son cleanses us from all
[1:29:02] sin."
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Our text said, "I am the light of the
[1:29:06] world. He that followth me shall not
[1:29:09] walk in darkness."
[1:29:12] Friends, I want to tell you, follow the
[1:29:14] message. Follow the light.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; You can walk right out of the darkness.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; You can walk right out of your prison.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; You can walk right out of your
[1:29:26] depression.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; I look, this isn't a dead letter. We
[1:29:31] ain't a bunch of uh organized
[1:29:33] denominational Christians and we got
[1:29:35] some tag called the message and we got
[1:29:38] some emblem that's the pillar of fire.
[1:29:40] Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, get that out of your mind. This this
[1:29:45] is a living word.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; This is a living savior. This is a
[1:29:49] living Christ. And I want to tell you,
[1:29:50] he's right here right now to meet you in
[1:29:52] your need that the light of God's word
[1:29:54] can shine into your home, into your
[1:29:57] marriage, into your heart, into your
[1:29:59] depression.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; What have we gotten so messageified that
[1:30:03] we ain't got no problems?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; We We just try to act like we're good
[1:30:08] Christians and we ain't battling the
[1:30:09] word. God knows what you're doing on
[1:30:11] your cell phone.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Some of you looking at pornography and
[1:30:15] some of you got Netflix and and you got
[1:30:17] all these apps and you're feeding on the
[1:30:19] things of the world and you come to
[1:30:20] church and say, "Bless God, we're going
[1:30:22] in the rapture." And you're living like
[1:30:23] the world. I say we need a real cleaning
[1:30:26] up from the pulpit to the back of the
[1:30:28] church. I want to go home. I want to go
[1:30:30] in a rapture. Lord, clean up my cell
[1:30:32] phone. Clean up my marriage. Clean up my
[1:30:35] home. I say, "Let's apply the token.
[1:30:38] Hallelujah.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; We got people taking communion.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to go there.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Many are sick among you cuz we're not
[1:30:49] discerning the Lord's body.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; This is a living word.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; A bleeding bloody word. Yes.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And when you catch a revelation,
[1:31:07] some of us just need to repent.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; We need to hear God Jesus Christ's first
[1:31:14] doctrine. Repent.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Be born again.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of people that believe the
[1:31:21] message and they ain't even been born
[1:31:22] again.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; We filled our churches with it. We Oh,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; our young people, they they they if they
[1:31:30] grew up, they'd just be a good buyer. I
[1:31:32] ain't trying to be negative.
[1:31:34] We'll turn it to the positive. But if
[1:31:36] we're not careful,
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; you young people, if you're not careful,
[1:31:40] it just becomes an idea or religion.
[1:31:42] Just like there's good Pentecostal kids.
[1:31:44] But I want to tell you, you got to get
[1:31:46] down in desperation. If you haven't,
[1:31:48] man, come to the altar. Pour your heart
[1:31:50] out. Say, I want to know the God of the
[1:31:51] Bible. I want to know the God of the
[1:31:53] message. I want to know the God of
[1:31:54] William Brandom. I want to know the God
[1:31:56] of my parents, of Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:31:58] Jacob. I want a real living God. I want
[1:32:02] to be changed. I want to be born again.
[1:32:04] I don't want to keep going through
[1:32:05] cycles of death and revival.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; The problem is that some of us like it
[1:32:14] too much.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; We kind of like
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; going to church and getting washed up
[1:32:21] and then going home and back to our
[1:32:23] dainties.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; It reminds me of Isaiah 4, you know.
[1:32:29] Oh,
[1:32:31] say it says seven women laid hold of one
[1:32:34] man
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; and said,
[1:32:37] "Let us eat our own bread,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; let us dress the way we want to,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; but only let us be called by your name.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Just call me a message believer, Brother
[1:32:47] Jason.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; But you know, my private time, don't go
[1:32:51] in there.
[1:32:55] No, don't don't tell me what I can and
[1:32:56] can't do on my cell phone.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me what I can and can't do in
[1:33:00] my marriage. And I ain't talking about
[1:33:02] the man standing behind the pulp. I'm
[1:33:03] talking about the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, you know, when the Holy
[1:33:07] Ghost is dealing with your heart. You
[1:33:08] know, the word is a discerner of the
[1:33:10] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[1:33:11] the very word is right now discerning
[1:33:12] your life. And you can either accept it
[1:33:14] or you can reject it. Yes. Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And if you know the way you're living is
[1:33:20] not right, you ought to just repent
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, oh, what was the zeal
[1:33:25] for the age?" Be zealous therefore and
[1:33:27] repent. The prophet of God said to say,
[1:33:30] "I am wrong." Oh, God, help us. If
[1:33:33] anybody needs to say, "Lord, I'm wrong.
[1:33:36] Lord, I've been wrong. I've been so
[1:33:38] wrong, but Lord, you're right. And I
[1:33:40] need your Holy Ghost. I need the pillar
[1:33:42] of fire just to come and change me. Wash
[1:33:45] me over, Lord. Change my thinking.
[1:33:47] Change my mind, my ideas. Lord, if there
[1:33:49] be any wickedness in me, Lord, you
[1:33:51] search the reigns of the heart. Lord,
[1:33:53] wash me up. Cleanse me up. Lord, I want
[1:33:55] to go in a rapture.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; It's too late of an hour. The death
[1:34:00] angel's passing.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:34:13] But God has given us a word
[1:34:16] that if you'll just surrender to that
[1:34:18] this morning, you can walk right out of
[1:34:20] the darkness, right out of the bondage,
[1:34:24] right out of your condition. God can
[1:34:25] restore your marriage,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; he can save your prodical sons and
[1:34:28] daughters.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; If you believe, I've been taught by a
[1:34:33] vindicated prophet, if you have enough
[1:34:34] faith for salvation, you have enough
[1:34:36] faith for your kids. Quit letting the
[1:34:38] devil haunt you about your sons and your
[1:34:40] daughters and stand upon the word and
[1:34:42] hit that devil with the word and say,
[1:34:44] "Satan, I got a promise. The same Jesus
[1:34:47] who saved me. The same Jesus that
[1:34:49] sanctified. He give me my babies. He
[1:34:51] give me my girl. He give me my boy. Back
[1:34:54] up, devil. You can't have him." And if
[1:34:56] the devil don't move, the prophet said,
[1:34:57] "Hit him again. Hit him again. Hit him
[1:35:00] again. My son will be saved. My
[1:35:02] daughters will be saved. I'm going to
[1:35:04] give my mama. I'm going to give my
[1:35:06] daddy. I'm going to get them all under
[1:35:08] the toe. Come on in to the message of
[1:35:10] the devil. You can't have a Hey, the
[1:35:12] prophet of God said, "This bride don't
[1:35:14] have a halfway religion." Moses stood
[1:35:16] before Pharaoh. Oh, if I can say it like
[1:35:18] this, I'll stand before the God of this
[1:35:20] evil age and say, "You can't have my
[1:35:22] family. You can't have my brothers. You
[1:35:25] can't have my sisters." We're all going.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; We ain't leaving a hoof behind.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I am of the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:35:36] Lord, I'm coming for you.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; The kings of this world might have taken
[1:35:40] you.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, ye men. Come on, ye servants.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; We're going in a rapture.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; We have a message.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; We are not pushed around
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; from pillar to post.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; We are not wondering. We are not
[1:36:05] wondering
[1:36:06] can I if I will I
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; you got the wrong one this time.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I am the gene seed of God.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; God said the gene that was in him at the
[1:36:19] beginning found me.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I come from God. I'm going back to God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said I've come to the
[1:36:29] spot. I believe that people don't even
[1:36:32] know what they're doing.
[1:36:34] It come to the time to where the human
[1:36:35] beings has looked like become such a
[1:36:38] subject to evil until it's a pathetic
[1:36:40] thing.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Seems like there's a shadow of darkness
[1:36:44] just over the people
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; that's oppressing them.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; So many times we want to put that out in
[1:36:50] Lady Osia.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; We want to put that out on that church
[1:36:53] or that family.
[1:36:56] Oh, but you can feel the pressure
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; in your home,
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; in your marriage,
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; when you wake up and you try to pray.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Pressure.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Pressing the people.
[1:37:12] There's gross darkness, a shadow of
[1:37:13] darkness over the land. Just over the
[1:37:16] people, pressing them to empty
[1:37:18] substitutes and drugs and lust and
[1:37:20] alcohol and music and entertainment and
[1:37:22] religious devils and religious spirits.
[1:37:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Religious spirits of hypocrisy hiding
[1:37:27] right in the framework of the message.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Coping with the darkness, coping with
[1:37:32] the pressure.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Too much pride.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't let pride hold you in a
[1:37:41] cycle of revival and death.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; There ain't going to be no pride on the
[1:37:46] day of judgment.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't no time for it there. And my Bible
[1:37:52] says we ought to have boldness in the
[1:37:53] day of judgment.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You ought to be zealous. Therefore,
[1:37:56] look, if you are going through a cycle
[1:37:58] and you can't get the victory over lust
[1:38:00] or you can't get the victory over
[1:38:02] entertainment or you delete the apps and
[1:38:04] you download them again,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I believe you can come be prayed for and
[1:38:09] be delivered this morning.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I believe in total
[1:38:15] deliverance.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I believe in total victory. Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I believe in being so one with the Lord
[1:38:22] Jesus Christ that I am he.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it where it's more
[1:38:27] familiar. She is him.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; I ain't the one that said it, Brother
[1:38:31] Jason.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; A vindicated prophet
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; said that you are him.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; I think it's time we start believing
[1:38:39] what a vindicated prophet said. I think
[1:38:42] a vindicated prophet told you, you are
[1:38:44] the bride of Jesus Christ. You are the
[1:38:46] spotless. Come on. Virtuous pride. Hey,
[1:38:49] I'm starting to feel pretty good. I feel
[1:38:50] like preaching. I think it's time we
[1:38:52] start believing who we are. You are the
[1:38:55] bride. You are justified. You can go on
[1:38:58] a rapture. You can put every devil under
[1:39:00] your feet. Every suicide devil, every
[1:39:03] depression, every lust devil. Hey, I've
[1:39:05] been called and raised up in this hour
[1:39:08] to put that devil under my feet
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; in my home, in my car, in my life, in my
[1:39:15] private life, in my church, in my
[1:39:18] family, in my marriage.
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just getting started, so
[1:39:28] forgive me.
[1:39:31] But to think in the midst of all this
[1:39:33] darkness
[1:39:36] and all this chaos and confusion of Lady
[1:39:40] Osia,
[1:39:41] God has a seed laying right there in the
[1:39:43] midst of all of it.
[1:39:46] And the prophet of God would say it like
[1:39:47] this. I should be closing, but it's all
[1:39:50] right. Y'all okay?
[1:39:53] You know, I know I'll call this my
[1:39:55] second home.
[1:39:57] It's like I tell the church back home,
[1:39:59] you know, this isn't mandatory,
[1:40:02] the same doors you came in are still
[1:40:04] right there.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; You you you know, you can come and go as
[1:40:10] you please.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Hope that's all right.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; But if you Hey,
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; if you want more, there's more for you.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "Well, now the
[1:40:21] seed was already upon the earth. I
[1:40:23] believe God had planted the seed and
[1:40:25] just as long as the sun could get to
[1:40:28] that seed.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Put yourself there, church.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, this Satan's trying to pile up so
[1:40:37] much chaos and darkness and confusion on
[1:40:40] your life, but just as long as the sun
[1:40:43] could get to that seed, it began to
[1:40:45] grow.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason it has only taken
[1:40:48] days to bring forth these things,
[1:40:49] because the seed was already in the
[1:40:51] earth. All it needed was light.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Look, the transforming powers already
[1:40:57] laying in you. No light, no life. I want
[1:41:01] to tell you church, this isn't a
[1:41:02] historical lesson. This isn't a history
[1:41:04] class. The prophet of God said, "This is
[1:41:06] what's happening in this day right now.
[1:41:08] God has predestinated seed that he's
[1:41:11] laid right into the age. And as long as
[1:41:13] the sunlight of this word can strike
[1:41:16] that seed, it will begin to grow."
[1:41:19] I want to tell you, he's right here,
[1:41:21] right now. I say, why don't you let him
[1:41:23] have his way? Open up your heart. Let
[1:41:26] the light of God's word shine into your
[1:41:28] heart. Don't reject him. I said it's
[1:41:31] time to rise and shine, church. He said,
[1:41:33] and that's the way God has it today. His
[1:41:35] seed is already here, his word. The only
[1:41:37] thing it needs is light on it.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; And he is that light. For he is the
[1:41:43] word. The word and the light is the same
[1:41:45] thing. The life in there is the light of
[1:41:48] the word. See, it's the life.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; That's why you can stand there and say,
[1:41:52] "Shalom,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; peace. It's light time for the
[1:41:57] believers."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; But I'm wanting to turn the corner just
[1:42:01] as you've experienced the light, the sen
[1:42:04] of God's word and this transforming
[1:42:06] power in your life.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Now you are the light.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; So then I'm preaching on the way light
[1:42:14] comes today.
[1:42:18] You are the light of the world.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; The way light comes today is in you.
[1:42:24] It's in you.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; How's your neighbor going to see the
[1:42:29] light?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Do Do men light a candle and hide it
[1:42:34] under a bushel?
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; We've been hiding.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Well, what are we afraid of? We afraid
[1:42:45] to lose our job.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; We afraid to not be able to go to the
[1:42:48] block party in the neighborhood cuz they
[1:42:49] know I'm a believer. They better already
[1:42:50] know you're a believer.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God for our wives.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Some of you brothers, the only reason
[1:42:55] people know you're a Christian is
[1:42:57] because they see your wife.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; It ain't because of your testimony. It
[1:43:00] ain't because of your life. Oh, glory to
[1:43:03] God. Help me now.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, some of you sisters, you've won
[1:43:06] more converts and you've shined your
[1:43:08] light more than some of us brothers.
[1:43:09] Because all we do is go to uh work with
[1:43:12] a tail tucked in and we don't tell
[1:43:13] nobody about it. But our wives when they
[1:43:15] go to the store and they go to the
[1:43:17] grocery store and they go into the
[1:43:19] highways and byways they're shining
[1:43:21] their light that Jesus Christ is the
[1:43:23] same yesterday today. I say if our
[1:43:25] sisters got enough Holy Ghost to not cut
[1:43:28] their hair and wear their dresses. Lord,
[1:43:30] you brothers got to have enough backbone
[1:43:32] to say I got your back. I'll go into the
[1:43:34] highways. I'll go in the valleys. I'll
[1:43:36] tell the whole world my God lives. He's
[1:43:39] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; I'll be like a John the Baptist and
[1:43:45] stand before our ro. It's not lawful for
[1:43:47] you to have her.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Cut my head off. Throw me in the
[1:43:52] dungeon.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Lock me up. But one thing, I will not
[1:43:55] bend. I will not pow. For I am like
[1:43:58] those Hebrew children.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Since when did we become pushovers?
[1:44:08] Hold out.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Quit ye like men.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; You are the light.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "Well, we're trying
[1:44:24] to come to a close."
[1:44:26] And the Messiah, he said, "Then when God
[1:44:28] was made flesh and become the Messiah,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; we okay for 10 more minutes? Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; In the Messiah, he said, "Then when God
[1:44:43] was made flesh and became the Messiah,
[1:44:45] then if we can yield ourselves
[1:44:49] to be anointed like he was,
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; we become Messiahs,
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; little lights,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; remember, it's expedient that I go
[1:45:01] away."
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Look, if Brother Brandon was still here,
[1:45:05] I'm sorry. I wouldn't be preaching.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; I'd be in his meeting somewhere.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And brother Jason probably might just be
[1:45:12] there, too.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Call me crazy.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Do Do you know what that ministry was?
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; It was the son of man ministry.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Christ veiling himself in human form.
[1:45:31] Yes.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; The same son of man ministry that came I
[1:45:34] hope that's all right. The same son of
[1:45:36] man ministry that came to the Jews
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; has come back to the gentile
[1:45:40] dispensation to prove that he's the same
[1:45:42] yesterday, today, and forever. And just
[1:45:44] as Jesus Christ told the disciples,
[1:45:47] "It's expedient that I go away because I
[1:45:50] want the son of man ministry to be in
[1:45:52] you." Christ come down in a first one to
[1:45:55] maturity in the office of a prophet
[1:45:57] proving he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:45:59] and forever. He has run his course. He
[1:46:01] was uh the the the light of the day. He
[1:46:04] was the anointed word. But now, where is
[1:46:07] that anointed word? It's in the bride.
[1:46:10] It's in the bride body.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And when the God was made flesh and
[1:46:15] became the Messiah, you are little, he
[1:46:16] goes on, you are little lights. That's
[1:46:18] what the church is supposed to be is
[1:46:20] lights, little anointed ones. That's
[1:46:23] God's church. Look friends, as long as
[1:46:25] it's just in the books and on the tapes,
[1:46:27] it can be questioned. But when that word
[1:46:29] is made manifested in you, then it is
[1:46:32] light to the age. Prophet of God said,
[1:46:34] "But when it's made manifest, then you
[1:46:37] see the product of what it spoke of
[1:46:40] being manifested. Then that is light on
[1:46:43] the word." Is that your heart's desire?
[1:46:44] We'll just call for the musicians as we
[1:46:46] move towards a close.
[1:46:49] Prophet of God said, "That's the way
[1:46:50] God's church is, his eagllets, his
[1:46:53] messiahs."
[1:46:54] Is it okay if you just sit there for a
[1:46:56] moment without playing? Is that okay,
[1:46:58] brother Jason?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; I have a bad habit of that. So, it
[1:47:02] reminds me though. I'll get to preaching
[1:47:03] for another 10 or 15 minutes and I'll
[1:47:04] look and see the musicians and be like,
[1:47:06] "Oh, yeah."
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "That's the way
[1:47:12] God's church is." Look, I'm talking
[1:47:13] about you now. We We've dealt in the
[1:47:15] negative, but we're bringing it to the
[1:47:16] positive. He said, he said, "That's the
[1:47:18] way God's church is. His eaglets, his
[1:47:20] messiahs."
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; They look like him. They act like him.
[1:47:26] They preach like him. They do the works
[1:47:29] that he did. The things that I do shall
[1:47:30] you do also. More than this shall you do
[1:47:32] because I go unto the father. These
[1:47:34] shines shall follow my eagllets.
[1:47:37] They'll do just as I do. If my spirit is
[1:47:40] in them, then they'll do the works that
[1:47:42] I do. If they don't do the works I do,
[1:47:44] that's because that spirit is not in
[1:47:46] them.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Uh don't be condemned.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Welcome the word and say, "Lord,
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; that's my portion.
[1:47:56] That's my promise. Look, your life
[1:47:58] declares what you are. And I want to
[1:48:01] say, maybe you don't look like what you
[1:48:03] will be, but there is a voice speaking
[1:48:05] out declaring what you are. Oh, I I got
[1:48:08] quotes I want to read. The prophet of
[1:48:10] God said, "You are the pure, virtuous,
[1:48:12] sinless bride of the son of the living
[1:48:14] God. Every man and woman that's born of
[1:48:17] the spirit of God and washed in the
[1:48:18] blood of Jesus Christ and believes every
[1:48:21] word of God stands as though you never
[1:48:24] sinned in the first place. You are
[1:48:26] perfect. There is a voice of God crying
[1:48:28] out to you. What you are, what you will
[1:48:31] be.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; If you start playing something
[1:48:41] softly, please
[1:48:44] in our text,
[1:48:49] here's this woman. She's brought before
[1:48:51] Jesus.
[1:48:54] She's dead concerning the law.
[1:49:00] She sinned,
[1:49:02] caught in adultery.
[1:49:05] Think of the condition maybe of the
[1:49:06] church age in the world and the
[1:49:08] denominations,
[1:49:10] adulterers.
[1:49:13] I think of my own life. We're born in
[1:49:15] sin and
[1:49:17] even raised in a message home. But
[1:49:23] I too was like this woman.
[1:49:27] I was guilty of the law.
[1:49:30] And I believe we're taught that if
[1:49:31] you're guilty of the least, you're
[1:49:32] guilty of the whole.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; And
[1:49:38] I I if I were standing there,
[1:49:41] there's no hope for this woman.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; The law of Moses is clear.
[1:49:48] There's not just one witness. There's
[1:49:50] multiple witnesses,
[1:49:53] hopeless situation.
[1:49:57] But the word
[1:50:00] took a hopeless situation
[1:50:05] and he shined his light.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Into the moment.
[1:50:14] And maybe you're in a situation right
[1:50:15] now and
[1:50:17] it looks hopeless. You're needing
[1:50:19] direction. You're needing deliverance.
[1:50:22] Maybe you've come to the altar and time
[1:50:25] and time again. I don't know.
[1:50:30] But you know that same one that stood in
[1:50:31] front of that woman and stooped down
[1:50:34] started to ride in the sand.
[1:50:38] He's here right now.
[1:50:42] And so many times we're worried about
[1:50:45] what the accusers will say.
[1:50:47] Or sometimes we make our brothers and
[1:50:49] sisters the jury.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; We're worried about what they'll think,
[1:50:53] what they'll say.
[1:50:56] Oh, if I go for prayer, if I go to the
[1:50:57] altar, I've been serving God 25 years. I
[1:51:00] got a position. If I tell brother Jason,
[1:51:02] I've been struggling with pornography.
[1:51:04] What will that do to my life? It'll set
[1:51:06] you free. Yes.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; It'll relieve you of the condemnation.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; It'll put you back in your position as a
[1:51:14] son of God.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Look, friend, it's too it's too late to
[1:51:17] be playing church. I didn't come here to
[1:51:20] preach a fancy sermon.
[1:51:22] I come that God might minister to you in
[1:51:24] your need
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; and prepare your heart and restore your
[1:51:28] heart because it's going home time. This
[1:51:31] ain't about how much message you can
[1:51:33] quote and and who's the best preacher
[1:51:34] and who got the best church. This is
[1:51:36] about sons and daughters of God
[1:51:38] recognizing that he's the same
[1:51:40] yesterday, today, and forever. That he
[1:51:42] can deliver you out of your bondage. He
[1:51:44] can save you from your sin. He can set
[1:51:47] you free from the darkness and the
[1:51:49] bondage. And the light of God's glorious
[1:51:51] gospel is here to shine into your
[1:51:54] situation.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Where are your accusers?
[1:52:05] None but you, Lord.
[1:52:09] I want to I wonder maybe with every head
[1:52:11] bowed,
[1:52:13] is there somebody that wants to come to
[1:52:15] Jesus?
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:20] Is there somebody that wants to make
[1:52:21] their life right?
[1:52:26] Is there somebody that wants to hear
[1:52:27] them words?
[1:52:30] I I I don't accuse you.
[1:52:34] I died for you. I carried your sins to
[1:52:38] Calvary
[1:52:40] that you might be forgiven. That you
[1:52:41] might be set free.
[1:52:45] Lord Jesus, we just
[1:52:50] just pray that you just come in a
[1:52:51] special way. Lord, I feel in my heart
[1:52:54] right now there's specific need.
[1:52:59] Lord, you went this way and I'm just
[1:53:00] trusting, Lord.
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:06] Lord, I
[1:53:09] I once was that woman.
[1:53:13] I was so
[1:53:15] bound in darkness,
[1:53:19] worthy to be killed and condemned.
[1:53:25] Lord, you stood there and said, "I don't
[1:53:28] accuse you.
[1:53:32] Go and sin no more."
[1:53:34] Lord, and I believe that you're here
[1:53:36] right now to set somebody free and to
[1:53:40] shine your light into their situation
[1:53:43] and start to deal with their heart.
[1:53:45] Lord, as we just
[1:53:49] just worship you in your presence, Lord,
[1:53:51] I just want to turn the service over to
[1:53:54] you, Lord, that
[1:53:56] you just walk up and down these aisles,
[1:53:58] Lord. And
[1:54:00] may there be a true surrender,
[1:54:05] Lord. You said it's expedient that I go
[1:54:07] away,
[1:54:08] Lord, because you wanted to come and
[1:54:10] tabernacle yourself in sons and
[1:54:13] daughters of God.
[1:54:16] Lord, we've allowed the things of the
[1:54:17] world to fill up our minds and our heart
[1:54:19] and our lives, Lord. But Lord, we just
[1:54:22] want to empty out this morning
[1:54:25] and ask that you would just come so fill
[1:54:27] us with the Holy Ghost. Lord, grant us
[1:54:30] revelation. I pray change my heart. Oh,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; change my heart, oh God.
[1:54:53] May I be like
[1:54:56] you.
[1:55:00] Change my heart, oh God. Let's all stand
[1:55:04] to our feet apart.
[1:55:07] Make it ever
[1:55:10] true.
[1:55:14] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:55:18] Oh, let the Lord deal with hearts today.
[1:55:21] May I be loved.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; This is why we come to church.
[1:55:26] Hallelujah.
[1:55:31] The power
[1:55:35] I am the
[1:55:41] Oh, let's give him some worship.
[1:55:44] Oh, me that made
[1:55:47] me.
[1:55:49] Oh, this is what I
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Anybody else want prayer today? Come on
[1:55:56] forward. This is your time. changed my
[1:55:58] heart. Oh, don't miss your opportunity,
[1:56:00] friend. Hallelujah. Come on, ministry
[1:56:04] team.
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God.
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:19] may
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:27] our sins right now forgive us of our
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:33] make it everlord
[1:56:37] [Music]
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; change my heart oh God
[1:56:47] May I be loved.
[1:56:53] You are seated in the name of the Lord
[1:56:55] Jesus Christ as the voice of God. Oh, we
[1:56:59] repent of our sins right now. I lay the
[1:57:02] hand upon God.
[1:57:07] Preach the gospel to lay hands on the s
[1:57:09] of
[1:57:11] tending a grave. I was called by name.
[1:57:17] Born and raised back to life again.
[1:57:23] I was made for more.
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:30] So why would I make a bed in my shame
[1:57:35] when I find enough? Grace is running my
[1:57:40] way. I know I am yours.
[1:57:44] I was made for more.
[1:57:50] I know who I am.
[1:57:56] I know who you are.
[1:58:01] The cross of salvation
[1:58:07] was only the storm.
[1:58:12] Now I am chos
[1:58:18] free and for
[1:58:22] glory and I have a future
[1:58:28] and it's worth
[1:58:30] living.
[1:58:42] Oh, hallelujah. Born in race back to
[1:58:46] life again.
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:58:53] Yes, Lord.
[1:58:56] So why would I make a my shame when a
[1:59:01] fountain of grace is running my way? I
[1:59:06] know I am yours and I was made for all.
[1:59:14] [Music]
[1:59:16] I know who I am.
[1:59:21] I know who you are.
[1:59:26] The cross of salvation
[1:59:31] was only the storm.
[1:59:37] Now I chose
[1:59:42] free and for
[1:59:46] [Music]
[1:59:53] this world
[2:00:00] I was made to be
[2:00:03] brave. I was strong by name
[2:00:08] and raised back to life again.
[2:00:12] But I was
[2:00:15] more
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:27] of
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:29] my
[2:00:34] I was made for
[2:00:42] I wasn't made to be
[2:00:45] brave. I was my name
[2:00:51] back to life again.
[2:00:55] I was faithful.
[2:01:03] So why would I make
[2:01:06] my shame when a fountain of grace is
[2:01:11] running my way? I know I am yours.
[2:01:16] I was for
[2:01:26] Hallelujah.

[2:01:32] your praise.
[2:01:35] Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] You buried my past and I'm not going
[2:01:43] back.
[2:01:50] You call out my name. I'll sing out your
[2:01:54] praise.

[2:35:01] that rod out of Moses' hand, they could
[2:35:03] have whipped him." Brother Brandham
[2:35:05] said, "But that rod is the name of Jesus
[2:35:08] to you today."
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; See, and it was that rod. He said,
[2:35:11] "Stretch out your rod. Do this. Do
[2:35:12] that." I'm here to tell you something,
[2:35:14] friends. I We don't have to carry around
[2:35:16] a rod, but we've got the name of Jesus.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just as powerful today as
[2:35:23] it has ever been. Amen.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; I so appreciate the Lord coming. It just
[2:35:28] goes to show you that the Lord can come
[2:35:30] in 2025 just like he did on the day of
[2:35:32] Pentecost
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; in an upper room 2,000 years ago. And
[2:35:37] the same God whips the same devil and
[2:35:39] the same family of God. Come to know
[2:35:41] him. Hallelujah. In a new and living
[2:35:44] way. I'm so appreciative of the Lord. My
[2:35:48] I think he deserves a wonderful hand of
[2:35:50] applause today for the Lord and his
[2:35:53] graciousness.
[2:35:59] You know, brother Matthew, I thought he
[2:36:01] might come to this quote as soon as he
[2:36:03] got started. I thought about this quote
[2:36:04] out of Feast of the Trumpets. And
[2:36:06] brother Brandham is talking about this
[2:36:08] very theme that this is the promise for
[2:36:11] this age. We're living in the age that
[2:36:14] his coming will be in. Think about that.
[2:36:17] You are the last generation that'll ever
[2:36:18] be on the earth. Amen. You're the
[2:36:21] generation, the Bible says, upon whom
[2:36:23] the ends of the world have come. I'm
[2:36:24] glad for me and you it's not ending.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says she must be identified in
[2:36:32] him. Any woman must be identified with
[2:36:34] her husband. The two are one. And Christ
[2:36:36] bride has to be identified with him for
[2:36:38] the two are one. He is the word, not a
[2:36:40] denomination, the word. We are to be the
[2:36:43] children of the light. The light is the
[2:36:46] word which is made light
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; for this age. Now, he's about to tell
[2:36:51] you what makes it. He said it's the Let
[2:36:53] me read it again. He said, "We're the
[2:36:55] children of light, and the light is the
[2:36:57] word which is made light for this age."
[2:36:59] How do we know light except it comes
[2:37:01] from the word? All right. The word made
[2:37:04] flesh is the light of the age. When you
[2:37:07] see it, the Bible said so. Now, it's
[2:37:10] interesting, you know, it's not just
[2:37:12] that when you see the message or when
[2:37:14] you see the truth, but when the people
[2:37:16] can see the word living in you and me.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's when it's the living
[2:37:21] word made flesh to the people. You can
[2:37:25] tell anybody about God sending a prophet
[2:37:27] and feed them all kinds of doctrine.
[2:37:28] That don't that won't the devil ain't
[2:37:30] afraid of that. See, he's not afraid of
[2:37:32] how religious you are, how right you are
[2:37:34] in your doctrine. He knows if you miss
[2:37:36] that life, you won't come up anyway. I
[2:37:38] want the life on display.
[2:37:41] Do you realize if you think about it,
[2:37:43] friends, I was talking to a sister here
[2:37:44] just recently and I and you know she's
[2:37:48] just just praying for her husband and I
[2:37:50] said sister I said you are actually your
[2:37:53] husband is more of a believer than he
[2:37:55] realizes because he's in love with the
[2:37:57] manifestation of the word and the
[2:37:59] manifestation of the word is a much
[2:38:01] better version of the word than a
[2:38:03] written book. Even this book
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; when Jesus came, was he the word?
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; That's not a trick question. He was the
[2:38:11] word. Did he come as a a scroll with
[2:38:14] words or did he come as a human being?
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; And that and Paul and Peter said, "We we
[2:38:19] have a more sure word of prophecy." They
[2:38:21] had the writings of Isaiah and Ezekiel
[2:38:23] and Daniel and all that, but Peter says,
[2:38:25] "We saw him. We went to the mountain
[2:38:27] with him. We have a more sure word." I'm
[2:38:30] here to tell you something, friends. The
[2:38:32] the earth has had a Bible for thousands
[2:38:34] of years. You are a more sure word of
[2:38:36] prophecy to the world. Brother Brandham
[2:38:39] said, "When the books are closed for the
[2:38:41] last time, the word will be fleshed."
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; I'm all for loving our Bibles. You
[2:38:46] should. It should be the most treasured,
[2:38:47] cherished item you possess. And I hope
[2:38:50] you possess one. But let me tell you
[2:38:52] something. God never intended to stay
[2:38:55] ink on paper in a book.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; He's intending to live behind flesh.
[2:39:01] your flesh, my flesh. Jesus was the
[2:39:05] beginning of the creation of God. And a
[2:39:08] prophet taught us and the word teaches
[2:39:10] us, you are a continuation of that same
[2:39:14] creation.
[2:39:16] Can you rejoice in that today?
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. There's no one loves,
[2:39:22] you know, sometimes, brother Brandham,
[2:39:23] he took his his old Bible and he laid it
[2:39:25] in a chair and he said, I just started
[2:39:28] walking around it, Brother Jack. He
[2:39:29] said, "I was in my office just walking
[2:39:31] around." And he said, "I just looked at
[2:39:32] that book laying there in that chair and
[2:39:33] I just kept walking around it." And he
[2:39:35] said, "I thought to myself," he said, "I
[2:39:36] pointed up my Bible." He said, "I
[2:39:38] thought to myself, God, there's life in
[2:39:41] there if the people will just receive
[2:39:43] it." Oh, no wonder you can become the
[2:39:46] light of the word of the world because
[2:39:48] you are the light of the word
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; made flesh and living in this dark
[2:39:55] impossible day. Amen. And do you know
[2:39:58] that it's all by design? You know God
[2:39:59] did it that way on purpose. He on
[2:40:02] purpose had you born in the darkest of
[2:40:05] all hours.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; And you say the devil beats me up so bad
[2:40:09] my mind battles and this and that.
[2:40:11] Listen, just remember God put you here
[2:40:14] on purpose because he knows you'll
[2:40:17] believe his word. And when you believe
[2:40:19] his word, friends, there's no devil, no
[2:40:22] power on earth that can stand against
[2:40:23] that. You believe God's word, Brother
[2:40:25] Brandham says, and that makes him love
[2:40:28] you and you get what you ask for. Amen.
[2:40:31] How many have enjoyed being in the
[2:40:32] presence of God today and enjoyed the
[2:40:34] word, enjoyed the ministry? Amen. Praise
[2:40:36] the Lord. I think I we'd like to have
[2:40:37] brother Matthew come back.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:45] [Music]
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you go. Amen.
[2:40:49] It's been wonderful to be in the house
[2:40:50] of God today. We'll have uh brother Matt
[2:40:52] and sister uh Gabrielle here and the
[2:40:55] kids all fellowshipping throughout the
[2:40:56] afternoon. You'd be welcome to shake
[2:40:58] their hand. Amen. Let them know how much
[2:41:00] you appreciated them being here with us.
[2:41:03] They're on their way through and we
[2:41:04] talked him into stopping here and Amen.
[2:41:06] coming to see us in Buford. I'm so glad
[2:41:08] you did, brother Matthew. Praise the
[2:41:10] Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Turn around
[2:41:12] and shake hands before you go. We're
[2:41:13] going to have brother Matt uh you got a
[2:41:15] Jubilee on on hand or what you going to
[2:41:17] say?

[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; Weapon may be formed, but it won't
[2:41:31] prosper.

[2:41:35] have had you here today.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; At your leisure, you can be dismissed.

[2:41:40] bless you.

[2:48:31] And it gets easier
[2:48:35] to
