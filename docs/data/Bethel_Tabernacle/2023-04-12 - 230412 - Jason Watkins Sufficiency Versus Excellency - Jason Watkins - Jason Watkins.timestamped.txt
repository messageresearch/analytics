[0:00] He displays [music] himself through his
[0:02] bride and many people can't see it.
[0:05] There's coming a day all we'll see.
[0:09] Amen. I want to be that bride. I want to
[0:11] reflect Jesus Christ in [music] my life.
[0:14] And I know you do, too. Otherwise, you
[0:16] wouldn't be here.
[0:18] Amen. Do you have a request upon your
[0:20] heart this evening?
[0:22] I know I have a request. I'm [music]
[0:25] My son is definitely struggling.
[0:28] I can't believe [music] it.
[0:30] But you know, God knows. Commit him to
[0:33] God and just leave it there and [music]
[0:36] it'll be all right.
[0:38] Amen. Let's pray.
[0:41] Father, I love you, Lord. As I stand
[0:44] here this evening, Father,
[0:47] how great. Listen to a sermon, Father,
[0:51] about [music] the infinity of God and
[0:54] how finite man is.
[0:57] And Lord, we see such a small portion,
[1:01] [music] but one day we will see as we
[1:04] are seen.
[1:07] Father, I [music] pray that you bless
[1:08] the people. You saw the hands that were
[1:10] lifted. You know the the burden upon my
[1:12] heart for my son.
[1:14] And Lord, I know you speak to me.
[1:16] [music]
[1:17] And I know that you
[1:20] tell me it'll be okay.
[1:23] And I thank you [music] for that.
[1:25] without that still small voice. Father,
[1:29] like Elijah [music] in the cave.
[1:33] We like the wind, we like the fire, we
[1:35] like the earthquake,
[1:38] but help us to just follow the leading
[1:40] of that still small voice. Bless your
[1:43] people this evening. Bless your tithes
[1:45] and [music] offerings.
[1:47] Lord, remember those that are streaming
[1:49] wherever we hear the word that comes
[1:51] forth [music] this evening. magnify it
[1:54] to our hearts, Father, Engs,
[1:58] Lord, that we [music] could just walk a
[2:00] little bit closer to you.
[2:03] I love your people. I love you. I thank
[2:05] you for your mercy and [music] grace,
[2:06] Father.
[2:08] Where would we be without it?
[2:11] I love you. And I pray in Jesus Christ's
[2:14] name. Amen.
[2:19] Y'all can be seated.
[2:44] Made of wood,
[2:49] built by man.
[2:54] There [music] it stood.
[2:59] Salvation's
[3:01] plan.
[3:04] Adam's fall
[3:07] [music] and my own sin.
[3:12] [music]
[3:13] It was all
[3:17] [music] placed [singing]
[3:18] on him.
[3:21] [music]
[3:22] Without the cross,
[3:26] [music] I would not know
[3:30] [music]
[3:31] redeeming [singing] love
[3:35] [music] that sought my [singing] soul.
[3:40] Without the blood,
[3:44] where [music and singing] would I be?
[3:48] I would be lost
[3:53] without [music] the cross.
[3:57] I would be lost
[4:02] without [music]
[4:03] the cross.
[4:08] [music]
[4:12] Mercy spilled
[4:16] love divine
[4:20] [music]
[4:20] on Calvar's hill
[4:25] for all menind [music]
[4:30] flowing [singing]
[4:31] through
[4:33] [music] the ages
[4:36] past
[4:39] destined [music and singing] to
[4:42] reach me at last.
[4:46] [music and singing]
[4:47] Without the cross,
[4:51] I would not [music]
[4:53] know
[4:56] redeeming love
[4:59] [music] that sought my soul.
[5:04] Without the blood,
[5:08] where would I be?
[5:12] I would be lost. [singing]
[5:16] Without [music]
[5:17] the cross,
[5:20] I would [music] not know.
[5:25] redeeming [music and singing] love
[5:29] that sought my soul.
[5:33] Without the blood,
[5:37] where would I be?
[5:42] I would [music] be lost.
[5:46] Without the cross,
[5:49] [singing]
[5:51] [music] I would be lost. Lo
[5:56] without the cross. [music]
[6:21] You you singing? Oh, I wasn't sure.
[6:38] Happy
[6:41] sisters.
[6:46] [snorts]
[7:03] [clears throat]
[7:03] try to be
[7:10] this came on my heart the other day and
[7:13] you know many times we'll hear the old
[7:14] hymns and
[7:24] the only inspiration to me was a
[7:25] different tempo. I just want to sing it,
[7:28] I guess, my way.
[7:35] [music]
[7:37] A wonderful Savior is Jesus, [music]
[7:42] my Lord. Oh, a wonderful Savior to me.
[7:49] [music] He hideth my soul in the cl of
[7:54] the [music and singing] rock where
[7:56] rivers of pleasure I see.
[8:02] He hideth my soul in the [music] cliff
[8:07] of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty
[8:12] land.
[8:14] Oh, he hideth my life in the depths of
[8:20] his love.
[8:22] Covers me there with his hand.
[8:25] [music and singing]
[8:27] Oh, and covers me there with his hand.
[8:40] [music]
[8:50] Oh, a wonderful Savior is Jesus [music]
[8:54] my Lord. He taketh my burden away.
[9:01] [music]
[9:02] He holdeth me up and I shall [music] not
[9:06] be moved. He giveth me strength as my
[9:12] day. [music]
[9:14] Oh, he hideth my soul [music]
[9:17] in the [singing] cliff of the rock that
[9:21] shadows a dry thirsty land.
[9:27] He [music] hideth my life in the
[9:30] [singing] depths of his love and covers
[9:35] me there with his hand.
[9:39] Oh, and covers me [music] there with his
[9:43] hand.
[9:50] [music]
[9:51] Oh, he hideth my soul in the cl of the
[9:57] rock that shadows [music] a dry thirsty
[10:01] land.
[10:04] Oh, he hideth my life [music] in the
[10:08] depths of his love that covers [music]
[10:12] me there with his hand
[10:16] [music]
[10:16] and covers me there with his Amen.

[14:01] Key of A.

[15:41] lifted
[15:43] me
[15:47] all my heart to [music] him I give
[15:54] to him I'll clean
[15:58] [music]
[16:00] in His blessed
[16:02] presence [music] there.
[16:06] Ever his praisees [singing and music]

[17:08] [music]
[17:13] Nothing else could [music] help
[17:18] love
[17:21] lifting
[17:24] me. [music]
[17:27] Amen. Let's all [music] stop standing.
[17:30] I'm going to change the order of the
[17:31] service. Invite the I believe it's
[17:34] believe it's the [music] pastor
[17:35] preaching tonight. Of course, we trust
[17:38] that it's not Brother Jason preaching.
[17:40] If it was Brother Jason preaching, we'd
[17:42] be in a world of hurt. [music]
[17:43] But it's the Lord Jesus preaching
[17:45] tonight, and that's why I'm here.

[23:40] James chapter 4. And um you can see my
[23:44] title here. Let's see. Uh where's my
[23:46] little
[23:48] Is this going to work here? Let's hope
[23:50] it worked last time, didn't it? Oh, it's
[23:52] already on. I better turn it off and
[23:53] turn it back on. Okay, I'm gonna give it
[23:55] a try. Josh,
[23:57] um
[23:58] ah it works. You can see my subtitle.
[24:02] I'm I want to speak to you tonight on
[24:04] sufficiency
[24:05] versus excellency.
[24:09] Sufficiency
[24:11] versus excellency. The battle against
[24:15] living lukewarm.
[24:18] There's almost nothing in the world that
[24:22] that that I mean I am just uh almost
[24:26] bulletproof to depression. Um I get that
[24:29] from brother Eddie. Thank the Lord.
[24:31] Amen. And uh I'm always a glass is half
[24:34] full kind of guy. To me, every dark
[24:37] cloud has a silver lining. Every last
[24:39] one of them. And uh I'm just that way.
[24:42] And if I something does get me down,
[24:45] it's usually gone by noon. Amen. But one
[24:48] of the things that will knock me down is
[24:52] if I find myself accepting sufficiency
[24:56] and not excellency.
[24:58] Amen. if I'm just just doing enough to
[25:01] get by and u you know especially God
[25:05] forbid living living lukewarm. Amen.
[25:09] Praise the Lord. James, let's go. I've
[25:11] got it right here for you, but you've
[25:12] got your Bibles open. Amen. We're going
[25:15] to just read these first um uh maybe the
[25:18] four first four verses.
[25:22] From whence come wars and fightings
[25:25] among you?
[25:27] Come they not hence even of your lust
[25:30] that war in your members. You remember
[25:32] Paul talks about that that in our
[25:34] members you know he said that that whole
[25:37] black dog white dog fight that goes on
[25:40] within us. And you know he said I find
[25:42] another law in my members that is my
[25:45] flesh waring against the the real me on
[25:48] the inside.
[25:51] So James is talking to people. It almost
[25:54] sounds like he's talking to people who
[25:55] have never even been born again, but
[25:57] that's not true. He's actually talking
[25:59] to people who are born again. But watch
[26:01] what he's saying here. From whence come
[26:03] wars and fightings among you. Come they
[26:06] not hence even of your lust lusts that
[26:11] war in your members. You lust and have
[26:14] not. You kill and desire to have.
[26:18] Doesn't mean you go murder somebody.
[26:20] Remember John his buddy
[26:23] had already said in his first epistle
[26:25] that to hate someone is to kill them. To
[26:29] hate them is to murder them. See? So you
[26:32] lust and have not. You kill and desire
[26:36] to have and cannot obtain. You fight and
[26:39] war. Yet you have not because you ask
[26:44] not. Isn't that amazing?
[26:48] Next. Next two. You ask and receive not
[26:53] because you ask a miss that you may
[26:56] consume it upon your lusts.
[26:59] Ye adulterers and adulteresses. Remember
[27:02] Jesus said to Peter, "Get behind me,
[27:04] Satan."
[27:05] Amen.
[27:05] Peter wasn't Satan. He's speaking to
[27:08] what was happening in Peter's mind. All
[27:10] right? You adulterers and adulteresses,
[27:13] know ye not, boy, look at this. Know you
[27:17] not that the friendship of the world is
[27:21] enmity with God? [clears throat] Enmity
[27:24] means that they're just they can't be
[27:26] reconciled. They're polar opposites.
[27:29] They don't they don't get along. They're
[27:31] not they don't live in the same space.
[27:34] All right? It's enmity with God. Whoever
[27:38] therefore will be a friend of the world
[27:41] is the say it with me enemy of God.
[27:46] Maybe you don't mean to be,
[27:48] right?
[27:49] But if you're a friend of the world, as
[27:51] far as God's concerned, you're his
[27:52] enemy.
[27:53] All right, let's pray. Father, we commit
[27:57] ourselves into your hands right now. And
[28:01] I ask, Lord, that as I feel your
[28:04] anointing settling down upon me to
[28:06] preach this sermon,
[28:09] Lord, this sermon has been quite
[28:11] something for me, Lord. At times I have
[28:14] felt so encouraged by it and and then
[28:19] I'll open up another chapter of it and
[28:21] I'll feel like I'm laid out flat and
[28:24] then I'll feel that you've picked me up
[28:26] and encouraged me again and then I feel
[28:27] laid out flat again. And Lord, it's been
[28:29] a an amazing little journey studying
[28:33] this. I've been looking at it for some
[28:36] number of days. And so I am just asking
[28:39] you to be mindful of us all tonight on
[28:42] this Wednesday night. Lord, seems like a
[28:44] perfect little sermon for a Wednesday
[28:46] night. And it's from my heart, Lord. And
[28:48] I'm I'm so identifying myself here. I'm
[28:51] like these believers, Lord. I I don't
[28:53] want to be friends with the world. I
[28:55] know that these believers were
[28:57] pricricked in their hearts, Lord,
[28:58] because they were they love you. And and
[29:00] and the apostle felt like he had to use
[29:04] some shock therapy, Lord. So I pray that
[29:07] you will be our helper tonight, Lord. As
[29:09] we stand in your presence, we commit
[29:12] ourselves in into in your purposes now
[29:14] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You
[29:17] can be seated.
[29:29] [clears throat]
[29:36] you know, the the language that we've
[29:39] read here [clears throat]
[29:41] is pretty rough.
[29:44] Pretty rough. And so I I just thought to
[29:47] myself, "Wow, James, you really I mean,
[29:50] this is this is Sister Debbie maybe her
[29:52] favorite book in the whole Bible, the
[29:53] book of James." And I say, "Wow, that
[29:56] language is really tough." Wow. It's
[30:00] almost I mean in in in I mean in in the
[30:03] woke Bible it don't say nothing like
[30:04] that.
[30:06] The liberals their Bible don't don't
[30:08] read like that. Their their Bible sees
[30:11] [clears throat] God as just you know
[30:14] having really no direct control over
[30:17] mankind. And when I read this I'm I'm
[30:20] pretty sure God has a lot or is
[30:22] intending to have a lot of control over
[30:24] our everyday lives. Our everyday walking
[30:27] talking walking around lives. Would you
[30:29] agree?
[30:30] [clears throat]
[30:31] Since James is so harsh here, I decided
[30:35] to switch translations and make it
[30:37] worse.
[30:40] That's what the Amplified Bible does.
[30:42] Whenever you read something in the
[30:43] Amplified, if it's good, it amplifies it
[30:44] to great. But if you read something
[30:46] tough, it really gets tough. All right.
[30:49] What leads to strife, discord, and
[30:52] feuds? And how do conflicts, quarrels,
[30:55] and fightings originate among you, you
[30:58] believers? How can this happen?
[31:00] Do they not arise from your sensual
[31:03] desires that are ever waring in your
[31:06] bodily members? I know you're born
[31:08] again. I know you love the Lord. THAT'S
[31:10] NOT IN QUESTION. WE'RE NOT This isn't an
[31:14] an outreach where we're where this is uh
[31:16] where we're trying to reach the sinner.
[31:18] I'm preaching tonight always to sinners,
[31:20] but we're preaching largely tonight to
[31:22] believers like me, like you.
[31:24] AMEN.
[31:25] AND WE SAY, I BUT I LOVE THE LORD. SO DO
[31:27] THESE PEOPLE. So did James.
[31:30] Say, WELL, DON'T YOU LOVE US, BROTHER
[31:31] JASON? I DO. SO DID JAMES.
[31:34] AMEN.
[31:34] WATCH.
[31:36] These are things that are waring in your
[31:38] bodily members. This is what keeps you,
[31:41] if you let it, from excellency.
[31:46] you are jealous and covet what others
[31:48] have.
[31:50] I mean, even if you say, "Well, wow,
[31:54] that's pretty broad." If you can say
[31:56] tonight and say, "You know, none of that
[31:59] stuff's true about me." Understand this
[32:02] that it all can be.
[32:04] Amen.
[32:05] Amen.
[32:06] It can be.
[32:07] Let your guard down and it will be.
[32:09] Yeah.
[32:10] See,
[32:11] you are jealous and covet what others
[32:13] have and your desires go unfulfilled. So
[32:17] you become murderers. To hate is to
[32:19] murder as far as your hearts are
[32:21] concerned. You burn with envy and anger
[32:24] and are not able to obtain the
[32:25] gratification, the contentment and the
[32:28] happiness that you seek.
[32:30] So you fight and war. Do you not have?
[32:34] YOU DO NOT HAVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT ASK.
[32:38] AMEN.
[32:39] Or you OR YOU DO ASK GOD FOR THEM AND
[32:44] YET FAIL TO RECEIVE THEM BECAUSE YOU ASK
[32:46] WITH WRONG PURPOSE and evil selfish
[32:49] motives. LOOK, BEFORE I MOVE ON, I I
[32:52] think that what the Bible IS TRYING TO
[32:54] GET US TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ALL IT
[32:57] TAKES IS a little abandonment of your
[32:59] prayer life, a little too much uh
[33:02] friendship with THE WORLD, AND YOU'LL
[33:05] FIND THAT OLD NATURE THAT YOU THOUGHT
[33:07] THE HOLY GHOST HAD HAD COMPLETELY
[33:09] ANNIHILATED. WHAT HE ANNIHILATED WAS NOT
[33:11] YOUR FLESH
[33:13] AND NOT YOUR SPIRIT. IT WAS THAT FALLEN
[33:15] NATURE. SO THAT YOU NOW AT LEAST YOU
[33:18] HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LOVE GOD.
[33:20] AMEN.
[33:21] SEE, YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM NOW to choose.
[33:24] PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GET AWAY
[33:27] FROM THE WORD OF GOD SO I CAN MAKE MY
[33:29] OWN CHOICE. THERE'S NO CHOICE. THERE'S
[33:31] ONLY IN CHRIST DO YOU HAVE A CHOICE.
[33:33] AMEN.
[33:35] THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU GET A CHOICE.
[33:36] OTHERWISE, YOU'RE A PRISONER
[33:39] TO your sin and you can't CHOOSE
[33:41] OTHERWISE. I JUST SAY, LORD, I'M SO GLAD
[33:43] FOR THE HOLY GHOST.
[33:46] BECAUSE NOW I GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE.
[33:49] HALLELUJAH. I MIGHT GET DOWN AND I MIGHT
[33:51] FIND MYSELF IN MEDIOCRITY, BUT I I DON'T
[33:54] HAVE TO STAY THERE. I MIGHT BE LOOKING
[33:56] LIKE A LUKEWARM CHRISTIAN, BUT I CAN
[33:58] COME TO CHURCH AND HEAR THE WORD AND
[34:00] FEEL THE SPIRIT AND GET WASHED CLEAN,
[34:03] AND I CAN GO OUT OF HERE IN VICTORY.
[34:05] HOW MANY WANT TO GO OUT OF HERE IN
[34:07] VICTORY TONIGHT?
[34:13] ARE you see he HE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY I
[34:17] MEAN LOOK LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE YOU DO
[34:19] NOT HAVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT ASK. SO THIS
[34:21] IS A PERSON WHO'S NOT USED TO PRAYING
[34:24] for a while.
[34:26] You see that
[34:28] OR YOU DO ASK GOD FOR THEM. YOU TREAT
[34:31] HIM LIKE SANTA CLAUS. SEE, YOU FAIL YET
[34:34] FAIL TO GET BECAUSE YOU ASK WITH THE
[34:36] WRONG PURPOSE AND EVIL SELFISH MOTIVES.
[34:38] YOUR INTENTION IS WHEN YOU GET WHAT YOU
[34:41] DESIRE TO SPEND IT IN sensual pleasures.
[34:43] Can you believe an apostle would talk
[34:45] like this? You are like
[34:48] you're like unfaithful WIVES HAVING
[34:52] ILLICIT LOVE AFFAIRS with the world AND
[34:54] BREAKING YOUR MARRIAGE. VOW TO GOD. I
[34:56] TOLD YOU IT'S GOING TO get worse.
[34:59] DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT BEING THE WORLD'S
[35:03] friend is being God's enemy? Young
[35:06] people, PLEASE READ THAT CAREFULLY.
[35:09] THIS IS HOW GOD FEELS ABOUT IT. DO YOU
[35:12] NOT KNOW THAT BEING THE WORLD'S FRIEND
[35:16] IS BEING GOD'S ENEMY? SO, WHOEVER
[35:18] CHOOSES TO BE a friend of the world
[35:23] takes his stand as an enemy of God.
[35:27] Amen.
[35:28] I would hate to think that I took my
[35:31] stand and my stand is an I'm an enemy of
[35:35] God.
[35:36] I'm an enemy of God. Here I stand. Wow.
[35:40] Or do you suppose that the scripture is
[35:45] speaking to no purpose that says THE
[35:47] SPIRIT WHOM HE HAS CAUSED TO DWELL IN US
[35:50] YEARNS over us and he yearns for the
[35:54] spirit to be welcome with a jealous
[35:57] love. DO YOU REALIZE THAT GOD IS JEALOUS
[36:01] OVER YOUR HEART?
[36:02] HE'S JEALOUS OVER YOUR AFFECTIONS. HE'S
[36:05] VERY JEALOUS OVER YOUR LOVE. AND HE'S
[36:08] OFFERING YOU THE WORLD
[36:10] NOW AND THE [screaming] WORLD'S TO COME.
[36:12] AND ALL HE SAYS IS, "LET ME LIVE IN YOUR
[36:15] HEARTS."
[36:15] AMEN.
[36:16] SEE,
[36:19] but he gives us, I love this, he finally
[36:21] throws us some encouragement. But he
[36:24] gives us more and more grace, power of
[36:27] the Holy Spirit to meet this evil
[36:30] tendency
[36:32] and all others fully. Now you know where
[36:35] you know where you find that principle
[36:37] in the scripture that the grace of God
[36:40] people say what is grace and they have
[36:42] this they have this really almost a
[36:45] nauseating idea of grace that God just
[36:49] is an old dirty grandpa who loves his
[36:51] grandkids and who will let him get AWAY
[36:53] WITH OLD DIRTY GRANDPAS WILL DO THAT God
[36:56] won't do that
[36:58] THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF LOVE BROTHER
[36:59] BRANDHAM SAID IT'S NOT LIKE THE CARE OF
[37:01] A BABY IT'S NOT THAT KIND of love
[37:04] THAT THAT THAT THAT THE BIBLE SAYS THAT
[37:07] GRACE TEACHES US TO DENY UNGODLINESS.
[37:13] HOW HOW DID I KNOW TO DENY UNGODLINESS?
[37:15] GRACE.
[37:17] OH WELL. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED IF YOU
[37:19] DIDN'T DO IT? THEN HE CAME AFTER ME LIKE
[37:20] A FAITHFUL FATHER WOULD GO AFTER ANY
[37:23] CHILD. AND I LOVE HIM FOR IT.
[37:27] OH, I thought he would just let me do
[37:29] anything. No, no, no, he won't. BUT HE
[37:33] GIVES US MORE AND MORE GRACE, POWER OF
[37:36] THE HOLY SPIRIT TO meet this evil
[37:38] tendency and all others fully. Do you
[37:40] believe that? Do you believe that? All
[37:42] others fully. Do you believe that Peter
[37:44] said you can reach a point where you
[37:46] never fall? You'll never be unfruitful.
[37:48] YOU'LL NEVER BE BARREN. OH, THAT'S THE
[37:50] LIFE I WANT.
[37:52] THAT'S THE LIFE I CRAVE. THAT'S MY WHOLE
[37:55] EVERYTHING. I'M I'M STRIVING FOR THAT.
[37:59] MY ONLY ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION COMES
[38:01] WHEN I FIND MYSELF SHORT OF THAT MARK.
[38:07] Oh my, you can tell this sermon has been
[38:10] rolling around in my soul for days.
[38:14] THAT IS WHY HE SAYS GOD SETS HIMSELF
[38:18] AGAINST THE PROUD AND HOTTY BUT GIVES
[38:21] GRACE HOW OFTEN continually to the
[38:24] lowly. Those who are humble enough to
[38:28] receive it. Those who are humble enough
[38:33] to receive it.
[38:35] See, that's what it means to humble
[38:37] yourself to the word of God.
[38:40] That's that's how sincerity is achieved
[38:43] because otherwise I MEAN IF IT'S NOT
[38:45] THAT then
[38:47] then sinc then be more you must you've
[38:50] got to be more sincere is a conundrum
[38:53] because wait a minute if I make myself
[38:56] sincere then that's not sincere
[39:00] and that's true you you'd just be you'd
[39:03] just be a blackbird trying to stick
[39:04] peacock feathers in your tail. Amen.
[39:06] SO, SO, SO THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD JUST
[39:09] HAVE TO SAY, "LORD, VERY WELL. I AGREE.
[39:12] WHATEVER, WHATEVER NEEDS TO HAPPEN, THEN
[39:14] BRING IT. BRING IT. LET IT HAPPEN. MAKE
[39:16] ME, CAUSE ME TO BE WHATEVER THAT
[39:19] REQUIRES." SAY, "WHAT DOES IT REQUIRE IN
[39:20] MY LIFE? IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
[39:21] THAN WHAT REQUIRES OF ME. I MIGHT HAVE A
[39:24] DIFFERENT KIND OF AN ISSUE THAN YOU, BUT
[39:25] GOD KNOWS US FROM TOP TO [screaming]
[39:28] BOTTOM."
[39:29] HALLELUJAH. I'M SO GLAD TO KNOW THAT.
[39:34] OH MY.
[39:37] Watch now.
[39:40] SO BE SUBJECT TO GOD. RESIST THE DEVIL.
[39:45] STAND FIRM AGAINST him and he will flee
[39:50] from you.
[39:51] See,
[39:53] SO THE KING JAMES SAYS, "SUBMIT
[39:55] yourselves to God. Resist the devil."
[39:58] You've heard me quote brother Bosworth
[40:02] many times
[40:04] that no one ever successfully resisted
[40:08] the devil until first they submitted
[40:12] themselves to God.
[40:13] Amen.
[40:14] Submit yourselves to God. Resist the
[40:17] devil and he will flee from you. One,
[40:21] two, three. A B C.
[40:25] Praise God.
[40:26] Not rocket science. It's ABCs.
[40:29] All right.
[40:32] All right. Wherefore, my brethren?
[40:35] Whoa, I'm in the wrong. What happened?
[40:38] Oh, here. Okay, we got to go back. We
[40:39] got to go back here. We got to go back
[40:41] one more. SO, BE SUBJECT TO GOD. RESIST
[40:45] THE DEVIL. STAND FIRM AGAINST HIM. LORD,
[40:50] HELP US TO stand firm against him. I
[40:54] JUST GOT TO STOP THERE AND SAY, "LORD,
[40:57] HELP ME RIGHT NOW." JUST SAY, "LORD,
[40:59] HELP ME TO STAND FIRM AGAINST HIM."
[41:04] HALLELUJAH.
[41:06] AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU. Come close to
[41:10] God. That's not hard, is it? You're
[41:12] doing it right now.
[41:14] COME CLOSE to God and he will come close
[41:18] to you. It's like, you know, Brother Ram
[41:20] said, "He careth you care." He'll care.
[41:23] Oh, does he care? But you got to care
[41:26] first.
[41:27] See, that's scripture. Come close to God
[41:30] and he will come close to you.
[41:32] Recognize that you ARE SINNERS. GET YOUR
[41:36] SOILED HANDS CLEAN. REALIZE THAT YOU
[41:39] HAVE BEEN DISLOYAL, WAVERING INDIVIDUALS
[41:43] WITH DIVIDED INTEREST. I FEEL LIKE
[41:45] ROLLING around on the ground SAYING,
[41:46] "GOD, HAVE MERCY ON ME." WITH DIVIDED
[41:49] INTEREST. AND PURIFY YOUR HEARTS OF YOUR
[41:52] SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. WOW, THAT'S A
[41:55] STINGER.
[41:57] That's a stinger. BUT BUT IT BUT IT'S
[42:00] FOR OUR GOOD. YOU BELIEVE THAT
[42:03] IT'S FOR OUR GOOD. WATCH.
[42:07] AS YOU DRAW NEAR TO GOD, be deeply
[42:10] penitent and grieve.
[42:13] Even weep over your disloyalty.
[42:16] Let your laughter be turned to grief and
[42:19] your mirth to dejection and heartfelt
[42:23] shame for your sins. BROTHER BRANDON
[42:26] talks about he said can you imagine me
[42:30] you know of breaking a vow to my wife
[42:33] AND JUST COME TO HER in some nonchalant
[42:37] flippant way. Hey sweetheart uh UH LOVE
[42:42] OF MY HEART. HEY MY HEY OLD GIRL. HOW
[42:44] ABOUT IT? WHAT DO YOU SAY? FORGIVE ME.
[42:46] WHAT DO YOU SAY? COME ON. YOU KNOW, I
[42:47] DIDN'T MEAN IT. COME ON, OLD GIRL.
[42:48] Forgive me. And he said, she'd look at
[42:51] me like, "What has happened to my
[42:52] husband?"
[42:53] And he said, "WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME
[42:54] TO GOD, YOU NEED TO REALIZE WHO YOU'RE
[42:56] TALKING TO.
[42:57] THIS THING AIN'T SOME JUST CASUAL THING.
[43:00] IT'S NOT, LORD, I I SLIPPED UP. SORRY,
[43:03] PAL. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S IT'S GET
[43:05] DOWN ON MY KNEES. I I HAVE A PERSONAL
[43:07] BELIEF AND I I DON'T VIOLATE IT. I
[43:09] BELIEVE IF A MAN'S GOING TO REPENT, HE
[43:11] OUGHT TO BE ON HIS KNEES SOMEHOW, UNLESS
[43:13] HE CAN'T GET THERE."
[43:15] AMEN. IF YOU CAN'T FIND, YOU MIGHT BE IN
[43:17] A YOU MIGHT BE STANDING UP LOCKED IN
[43:19] CHAINS. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I I BELIEVE
[43:21] THAT IN YOUR HEART, YOU COULD BE
[43:22] KNEELING IN HUMILITY AND SAYING, "LORD,
[43:25] FORGIVE ME. FORGIVE ME. FORGIVE ME AND
[43:29] CLEANSE ME. CLEANSE ME. CLEANSE ME. SET
[43:32] ME [screaming] UP HIGHER. I DON'T WANT
[43:34] TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN." YEAH.
[43:38] SEE,
[43:40] SO HUMBLE YOURSELVES
[43:43] FEELING VERY INSIGNIFICANT in the
[43:46] presence of the Lord. Here's the good
[43:48] news. And he will exalt you. He will
[43:53] lift you up and make your lives
[43:58] significant.
[44:00] I think that's shocking. He will lift
[44:03] you up and he will make your lives
[44:07] significant.
[44:08] Amen.
[44:10] Sufficiency
[44:12] versus excellency.
[44:15] YOU REMEMBER THE STORY BROTHER BRADAM
[44:17] TELLS about in in South Africa and he
[44:22] was um I I think it was with one of one
[44:25] of the men there, one of the Oh, his
[44:27] brother brother Zadcliffe. He's with
[44:29] George Zadzcliffe. That's the guy I
[44:31] interviewed. wrote that book, A Prophet
[44:33] Visits South Africa. I interviewed him
[44:34] before he passed away to get the
[44:36] certainty of his accounting. And boy,
[44:38] was he ever certain.
[44:40] And and he he and and that he brother
[44:44] Brandham kept seeing these people who he
[44:46] had saw come into the meeting and
[44:50] receive Christ and it was for real. BUT
[44:53] HE SAW THEM IN TOWN OR IN THE BUSH
[44:56] carrying their idol.
[44:57] Yeah. Amen.
[44:58] He thought that's weird. And he says,
[45:00] "What? what's going on with that? He
[45:01] says, he says, "Well, Brother Brandham,
[45:03] let's go ask him." And so they, HERE'S
[45:05] ONE WALKING ACROSS AND THEY come up,
[45:07] they recognize him as being in the
[45:09] service. Excuse me, sir. Weren't you in
[45:12] the service? Yes. Thank you. The word
[45:14] was wonderful. Well, Brother Vim is
[45:16] saying, "Well, I'm just wondering." He
[45:17] said, "I I noticed that you accepted the
[45:20] Lord Jesus." Yes. Praise God.
[45:21] Hallelujah. I have Jesus in my heart. He
[45:24] says, "Well, then why are you carrying
[45:25] your idol?" And the the man very
[45:29] honestly said, "Well, if a lion comes
[45:32] after me in the bush, he said, "If if
[45:36] Jesus fails, then I will build a a a
[45:40] sacred fire to my idol, and he will
[45:43] protect me from the lion." And brother
[45:46] Brandham said, "Look, the only thing
[45:47] protecting you from the lion is the
[45:49] fire.
[45:50] You're building a fire, and that's why
[45:51] he won't come after you. Has nothing to
[45:53] do with that piece of wood."
[45:55] Amen. But but the problem was that that
[45:58] you know IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF LIKE YOU
[46:00] KNOW I I I FIND THAT THAT SATAN IS
[46:03] ALWAYS WORKING. HE'S ALWAYS WORKING TO
[46:06] TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN your
[46:08] reasoning and your faith. Now they ought
[46:10] to be miles apart.
[46:12] THEY OUGHT TO BE SO FAR APART YOU DON'T
[46:14] EVEN OPERATE IN REASONING WHEN IT COMES
[46:16] TO God's word.
[46:18] AMEN. IF I'M GOING TO CLIMB A LADDER,
[46:20] I'M GOING TO USE REASONING. BUT IF I'M
[46:22] GOING TO BELIEVE GOD'S PROMISE, I GOT TO
[46:24] GET AWAY FROM REASONING.
[46:26] SEE, SO SATAN IS ALWAYS WORKING TO CLOSE
[46:29] THAT DISTANCE. HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO
[46:32] INSERT LINKAGE UH UH BETWEEN THEM. AND
[46:36] HE DOES THIS TO TO LIMIT YOUR FAITH
[46:39] FROM, YOU KNOW, TO TO OPERATING AS IT
[46:43] WERE O ONLY YOUR HE WANTS TO LIMIT YOUR
[46:46] FAITH TO ONLY OPERATE THE PROMISES OF
[46:50] GOD THAT ARE REASONABLE,
[46:54] the ones that make sense to you. And
[46:56] then you SAY, "YEAH, I GOT FAITH IN THAT
[46:58] ONE. I'm not so sure."
[47:00] You got a lot of reasoning.
[47:02] I'm not so sure if you have faith. SEE,
[47:05] LIKE JUST LIKE THE NATIVE, IF JESUS
[47:08] FAILS, WELL, I ALWAYS HAVE MY IDOL.
[47:10] WELL, IF JESUS FAILS, WELL, I ALWAYS
[47:13] HAVE MY MEDICINE AND I ALWAYS HAVE
[47:15] DOCTORS.
[47:17] IF JES I'M NOT AGAINST DOCTORS AND
[47:18] MEDICINE. I USE BOTH OF THEM IF I need
[47:20] to. Brother Brandham said God gave us
[47:22] that. It's a it's it's God's compassion
[47:24] for suffering humanity trapped in sin
[47:27] and he's got diseases and the devil's
[47:29] trying to wipe out humanity. So, God
[47:30] gives him doctors and medicine. Don't be
[47:32] afraid of that. See, BUT BUT ONCE WHAT
[47:35] HAPPENED? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN
[47:36] IT GETS BEYOND MEDICINE AND BEYOND A
[47:38] DOCTOR?
[47:39] SEE, OH, I YOU KNOW, IF IF JESUS FAILS,
[47:43] WELL, I GOT PLENTY OF MONEY IN MY BANK.
[47:47] Why don't you just go ahead and get you
[47:49] an idol?
[47:51] Well, you know, IF IF JESUS FAILS, WELL,
[47:53] I I I I GOT THIS REALLY LUCRATIVE
[47:56] OPPORTUNITY OF A JOB, A CAREER, YOU
[47:59] KNOW, AN INVESTMENT. I GOT THIS, I GOT
[48:01] THAT. YOU KNOW, I I I I'M HERE TO TELL
[48:04] YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS, THAT I CAN'T
[48:06] RECONCILE
[48:07] WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT.
[48:10] THOSE AT THE END TIME WHO KNOW THEIR GOD
[48:12] WILL DO GREAT EXPLOITS. I CAN'T
[48:14] RECONCILE GREAT EXPLOITS WITH
[48:16] SUFFICIENCY.
[48:18] GREAT EXPLOITS SEEMS LIKE EXCELLENCY TO
[48:20] ME. I CAN'T I CAN'T GET IT IN MY MIND
[48:23] THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AROUND OPERATING
[48:26] EXPLOITS OF GOD, JUST OPERATING AS SOME
[48:29] MEDIOCRE, BARELY MAKING THE GRADE. OH,
[48:32] I'M SO DONE WITH BARELY MAKING THE
[48:34] GRADE. I GOT SO DONE WITH THAT YEARS AGO
[48:36] IN MY LIFE. AND SINCE THEN, I'VE BEEN ON
[48:38] A QUEST. I'VE BEEN ON A QUEST TO GO
[48:40] BEYOND IT AND SAY, "LORD, WHEN I GET
[48:42] BEYOND THAT LEVEL, I WANT TO GO TO THE
[48:44] NEXT LEVEL AND THE NEXT LEVEL." SAY,
[48:46] "HOW HIGH DO YOU WANT TO GO?" I DON'T
[48:47] KNOW. ENOCH WENT ALL THE WAY TO HEAVEN.
[48:50] AMEN.
[48:51] AMEN.
[48:53] BUT I CAN'T RECONCILE GREAT EXPLOITS
[48:56] with mediocrity.
[48:58] No way.
[49:02] SO PAUL SAYS HERE,
[49:04] watch this. NOW
[49:07] PAUL SAYS IN ROMANS 7, "WHEREFORE MY
[49:09] BRETHREN,
[49:11] ye also
[49:13] ARE BECOME DEAD TO THE LAW
[49:17] BY THE BODY OF CHRIST. THAT YE SHOULD
[49:20] that ye should BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER,
[49:22] EVEN TO HIM WHO IS RAISED FROM THE
[49:24] DEAD." THAT WE SHOULD HERE'S WHY. THAT
[49:27] WE SHOULD BRING FORTH FRUIT UNTO GOD. I
[49:31] I'M NOT MARRIED TO A DEAD DENOMINATIONAL
[49:36] HUSBAND.
[49:37] AMEN.
[49:38] YOU WONDER WHY THEY DON'T BRING FORTH
[49:41] THE FRUITS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS? BECAUSE
[49:43] IT'S A DEAD HUSBAND. UH YOU DON'T
[49:46] THERE'S NO WIFE IN HERE WHO'S GOING TO
[49:49] BRING FORTH FRUIT OF A MARRIAGE UNION
[49:52] FROM A DEAD HUSBAND.
[49:54] HE'S GOT TO BE ALIVE. YOU UNDERSTAND?
[49:57] AND THAT AND AND THAT'S WHY PAUL IS
[49:59] [screaming] SAYING NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE
[50:00] FREE FROM THE LAW. YOU'RE FREE FROM SIN
[50:03] TO BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER. THAT'S CHRIST.
[50:06] SO THAT YOU CAN BRING FORTH FRUIT OF HIS
[50:08] LIFE. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN.
[50:10] THAT'S WHY THE HOLY GHOST CAME. THAT'S
[50:11] WHY THERE'S A MESSAGE.
[50:14] AMEN.
[50:15] OH MY.
[50:18] FOR WHEN WATCH HIM think back. He's
[50:22] going to think back with you. Think back
[50:23] with Paul here.
[50:26] This is sensible. For when we were in
[50:28] the flesh, the motions of sin which were
[50:31] by the law did work in our members to
[50:34] bring forth fruit unto death.
[50:36] Yeah. Amen.
[50:39] I need some more nods.
[50:40] Amen.
[50:43] Look at your neighbor and go,
[50:47] it's true.
[50:48] I That's true. I remember that.
[50:51] I USED TO BE THAT. YES,
[50:54] BUT I BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT THAT ANYMORE.
[50:56] I'M UP HERE. I'M TRYING TO BRING FORTH
[50:58] FRUIT UNTO GOD JUST LIKE I BROUGHT FORTH
[51:00] FRUIT UNTO DEATH. IF I DID IT FOR DEATH,
[51:02] WHY WOULD I THINK I CAN'T BRING IT FOR
[51:04] LIFE?
[51:07] SEE, WATCH.
[51:09] BUT NOW,
[51:11] NOW WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THE LAW
[51:14] THAT BEING DEAD WHEREIN WE WERE HELD.
[51:17] SEE, YOU HAD no freedom. You had no
[51:18] choice. You thought it was a choice. You
[51:19] had no choice. you were held that we
[51:22] should serve in newness of spirit AND
[51:27] NOT IN THE OLDNESS of the letter.
[51:30] Amen.
[51:31] See,
[51:33] I I WENT BACK AND PULLED I DON'T KNOW IF
[51:35] I EVER READ THIS particular I've read
[51:37] every once in a while I'll read uh uh uh
[51:40] some verses out of my own translation
[51:41] when I re-ransated the book of Romans or
[51:44] the most part of it. Anyway,
[51:46] here is the those two three verses from
[51:49] the translation I did some years ago.
[51:51] So, this is the point.
[51:54] Death ended your relation to the law
[51:57] because YOU DIED TO ITS POWER when you
[51:59] DIED WITH CHRIST ON THE CROSS. AND NOW
[52:03] YOU HAVE A SPIRITUAL UNION WITH CHRIST
[52:05] WHO RAISED FROM THE DEAD AND YOU WITH
[52:08] HIM. GLORY. HALLELUJAH.
[52:11] AS A RESULT, [screaming] YOU CAN
[52:13] REPRODUCE THE FULL LIFE OF GOD. GOOD
[52:16] NEWS.
[52:18] You can produce the full LIFE OF GOD.
[52:21] FOR WHEN WE WERE SAY, IS ARE IS THAT
[52:23] RIGHT? WELL, JUST JUST LOOK AT THE FLIP
[52:25] SIDE. FOR WHEN WE WERE CONTROLLED by the
[52:27] SINFUL NATURE, THE SINFUL PASSIONS AND
[52:29] APPETITES AROUSED BY THE LAW WERE AT
[52:31] WORK IN OUR BODIES. YEP. SO THAT WE BORE
[52:33] FRUIT UNDER DEATH. YEP. WELL, IF THAT'S
[52:36] TRUE, THEN THE THE TOP VERSE IS TRUE.
[52:39] SEE? SO PAUL CONCLUDES, "BUT NOW THAT WE
[52:42] HAVE DIED WITH CHRIST, HAVE YOU DIED
[52:44] WITH CHRIST?"
[52:46] THE LAW WHEREIN WE WERE HELD FAST HAS
[52:49] LOST ITS [screaming] HOLD UPON US SO
[52:52] THAT WE ARE NO LONGER I WANT THE DEVIL
[52:54] TO HEAR THAT I'M NO LONGER IN THE OLD
[52:58] BONDAGE OF THE LETTER, BUT IN THE NEW
[53:01] SERVICE OF THE SPIRIT.
[53:04] I CAN HAVE EXCELLENCY.
[53:07] I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN MEDIOCRITY.
[53:11] SEE, it's not necessary anymore.
[53:21] When we read in our Bibles
[53:24] that we should serve in newness of
[53:26] spirit
[53:28] and not in the oldness of the letter,
[53:34] I wonder sometimes.
[53:37] Now, let me just get real close. Is that
[53:40] okay?
[53:41] I wonder sometimes
[53:44] if the devil can get us to a point where
[53:46] we just feel resigned to failure.
[53:52] I just have this thing I can't get past,
[53:54] Brother Jason. I keep falling to it over
[53:59] and over again. I I can never reach
[54:03] those heights of great exploits.
[54:09] You will get there.
[54:13] I'm sorry I made that sound like an
[54:14] encouragement, but it's a warning.
[54:21] You will get there.
[54:25] You've already been called to it by the
[54:28] word.
[54:30] And the word never fails.
[54:35] The Holy Ghost always gets his man.
[54:39] You can run. You actually can. But you
[54:41] can't hide.
[54:44] See,
[54:47] I agree, Brother Joe. I just say, "Thank
[54:50] you, Lord."
[54:51] Amen.
[54:53] The first thing
[54:55] that God may need to show you here
[54:58] tonight, even in this service,
[55:00] is just how sure he is that he will get
[55:04] you there.
[55:07] One of Satan's primary goals for God's
[55:11] family, this family who's now free from
[55:13] the law,
[55:14] one of his primary goals for God's
[55:17] family,
[55:18] devastating to your operation of perfect
[55:21] faith, is to get you to doubt.
[55:25] get you to doubt that all of your
[55:30] mistakes in life
[55:33] are met fully in the death, burial, and
[55:37] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:43] He's always trying to defeat you there.
[55:46] If he can defeat you there, you'll never
[55:48] get on up the ladder. You'll never move
[55:50] on up the pyramid. You'll never You'll
[55:52] be so discouraged. if he can just hold
[55:54] you right there. But but but we find
[55:57] that THAT THE HOLY GHOST WHOSE PRIMARY
[56:01] work in in THIS LIFE IN YOUR LIFE AS HE
[56:05] AS HE MOVES WITH YOU THROUGH LIFE, HIS
[56:08] PRIMARY WORKING is to continually LEAD
[56:12] YOU AND GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. DO YOU
[56:15] BELIEVE THAT? AND AS SUCH, THE SPIRIT IS
[56:18] CONSTANTLY, THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS
[56:21] CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DISTANCE YOU FROM
[56:24] YOUR REASONING. SATAN IS ALWAYS TRYING
[56:27] TO BRING REASONING AND FAITH TOGETHER.
[56:29] THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS TRYING TO LEAD
[56:31] YOU TO TRUTH AND GET YOU [screaming]
[56:33] AWAY FROM REASONING. GET YOU TO BELIEVE
[56:36] THE WORD OF GOD. THE ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE
[56:41] BUT TRUE PROMISE OF THE GOSPEL IS THAT
[56:44] ALL YOUR FAILURES, PAST, PRESENT, AND
[56:48] FUTURE, HAVE INDEED BEEN FULLY AND
[56:51] COMPLETELY ABSORBED AND MET IN THE
[56:54] DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS
[56:56] CHRIST.
[56:58] AMEN.
[56:59] THEY HAVE EVERYONE PAST, PRESENT, AND
[57:02] FUTURE, EVEN THE ONES YOU HAVEN'T
[57:04] STUMBLED AT YET, ARE COMPLETELY
[57:07] DISCHARGED IN THE TRIUMPH OF CHRIST OVER
[57:11] SATAN.
[57:12] AND YOU GOT TO GET THAT FIRST TONIGHT
[57:15] AND SAY, "I BELIEVE THAT, AND I'M NOT
[57:18] GOING TO BELIEVE THAT I [screaming] HAVE
[57:20] TO BE A FAILURE, AND I'M NOT GOING TO
[57:22] BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
[57:24] I I AM FREE FROM THAT.
[57:27] HALLELUJAH.
[57:30] SO COMPLETE WAS HIS VICTORY. I I I
[57:33] [screaming] THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, YOU
[57:35] KNOW, TODAY AS I WAS WRITING THESE
[57:38] NOTES. I THOUGHT SO complete a victory.
[57:43] So total THAT HE LITERALLY HOLDS the
[57:47] keys of death, hell itself, and the
[57:52] grave.
[57:52] Amen.
[57:53] Brother Brown said he Satan don't have
[57:54] keys to his own house.
[57:56] that Jesus completely
[57:59] triumphed over him. WE'RE TALKING
[58:03] COMPLETELY
[58:05] THAT HE LEFT NO SO FINAL IS YOUR VICTORY
[58:09] IN CHRIST THAT [screaming] NO
[58:12] CONDEMNATION OF YOU BEFORE GOD IS EVEN
[58:16] POSSIBLE. [screaming]
[58:18] THAT'S HOW COMPLETE YOUR VICTORY IS
[58:22] TONIGHT. THAT'S [screaming] HOW
[58:23] THOROUGHLY CHRIST DEFEATED SATAN. AND
[58:26] YOU NEED TO GET THAT AND OWN IT AND SAY
[58:29] AND SAY, "IN CHRIST, I AM WEAK, BUT HE
[58:32] IS STRONG. IN [screaming] CHRIST, I CAN
[58:33] DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO
[58:36] STRENGTHENS ME. I DON'T HAVE TO BE A
[58:39] VICTIM OF THE DEVIL ANYMORE. THERE WAS A
[58:42] DAY I COULDN'T PREVENT IT, BUT NOW
[58:44] [screaming]
[58:45] I'M FREE. I'M IN THE LIBERTY OF THE LOVE
[58:47] OF GOD." AMEN.
[58:50] HALLELUJAH.
[58:54] YOU KNOW, GOD SPOKE TO Job
[58:57] [snorts]
[58:58] and then he very very much like I was
[59:01] thinking about one of the ways that God
[59:03] spoke to Job
[59:05] very much like the way he spoke to
[59:06] brother Brandham in those Kentucky woods
[59:10] with the you know he's he's asking him a
[59:13] question
[59:15] with the answer hidden in the question
[59:19] you know you know and brother Brandon
[59:21] can't figure out Mark 11 until finally
[59:25] the Lord just start brother Rams is like
[59:27] losing it and finally the Lord just says
[59:31] okay you are so hung up on you're
[59:35] worried it's going to be you operating
[59:38] it and you can't figure out how that's
[59:40] under the covenant. Okay, I'm going to
[59:43] ask you a question and the answer is
[59:45] hidden within the question. When you
[59:48] know the secrets of people's hearts, you
[59:49] think that's you.
[59:52] All those miracles that are happening,
[59:54] you think that's you doing that? You
[59:56] think ALL OF THOSE PROPHECIES AND THUS
[59:58] SAYETH THE LORD AND THEY all come to
[1:00:00] pass perfectly, you really think that's
[1:00:03] you doing it?
[1:00:04] And brother Brandham saw the answer. No,
[1:00:07] it's not me. It's him.
[1:00:10] It's always been him.
[1:00:12] Amen. See, I mean, YOU KNOW, THE THE
[1:00:16] BIZARRE WAY OF ASKING, OF COURSE, IS
[1:00:18] IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE, YOU KNOW,
[1:00:21] BE BECAUSE IT IT WHAT IT DOES IS IT IT
[1:00:23] MAKES ROOM FOR THE OPERATION of divine
[1:00:26] revelation. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD'S AFTER
[1:00:28] CUZ HE'S NOT JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE
[1:00:30] YOUR HEAD. HE'S TRYING TO GET A REALITY
[1:00:33] DOWN INSIDE YOUR HEART.
[1:00:35] YOU'LL FORGET WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.
[1:00:36] YOU'LL DOUBT IT. THAT'S WHERE REASONING
[1:00:37] IS. GOD'S TRYING TO COME DOWN INTO YOUR
[1:00:39] HEART. I STAND HERE TONIGHT AND MY HEAD
[1:00:41] KNOWS I'M I'M PROBABLY NOT EVEN WORTHY
[1:00:43] TO STAND HERE, BUT MY HEART KNOWS I LOVE
[1:00:46] GOD.
[1:00:47] MY HEART KNOWS HE LOVES ME. MY HEAD
[1:00:49] WOULD SAY, "BUT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:00:50] KICKED ASIDE." THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE, BUT
[1:00:53] HE LOVES ME.
[1:00:55] AND MY HEART TELLS ME THAT
[1:00:58] GOD COULD SAY TO ME, HE COULD SAY TO YOU
[1:01:00] TONIGHT, "DO YOU THINK THAT WAS YOU WHO
[1:01:02] CAME OUT [screaming] OF THAT BARROOM AND
[1:01:04] DECIDED TO BE A CHRISTIAN? DO YOU THINK
[1:01:06] THAT WAS YOU WHO ONE NIGHT YOU FELL AT
[1:01:08] AN ALTAR AND YOU GAVE YOUR WHOLE
[1:01:10] [screaming] HEART? YOU THINK YOU DID
[1:01:11] THAT? NO, LORD. THAT WAS YOUR GRACE ON
[1:01:15] MY LIFE.
[1:01:18] TRACKED ME DOWN.
[1:01:20] SEE, IT MAKES ROOM FOR THE OPERATION OF
[1:01:22] DIVINE REVELATION WHERE YOU LITERALLY
[1:01:25] COME TO THE ANSWER BY FOCUSING ON THE
[1:01:26] QUESTION. THAT'S WHAT GOD DID TO JOB.
[1:01:29] Job just lamenting everything AND GOD
[1:01:31] JUST HE'S GONNA HE'S GOING TO GIVE HIM A
[1:01:33] REVELATION. And Job,
[1:01:35] where were you when morning stars sang
[1:01:38] together
[1:01:39] and sons of God shouted for joy?
[1:01:42] Amen.
[1:01:44] Job, you really think you started here?
[1:01:47] You really think this life is about this
[1:01:49] life?
[1:01:50] You really don't remember, do you? When
[1:01:53] morning STARS SANG TOGETHER, JOB, you
[1:01:56] were there.
[1:01:57] YOU'LL BE THERE AGAIN. YOU CAN'T NOT BE
[1:02:00] THERE BECAUSE YOU WERE ALREADY THERE.
[1:02:02] YOU ALREADY MADE YOUR DECISION LONG AGO.
[1:02:05] YOU MADE A DECISION. YOU DECIDED AGAINST
[1:02:08] LUCIFER AND [screaming] YOU SIDED WITH
[1:02:09] MICHAEL AND THAT SEALED YOUR ETERNAL
[1:02:12] DESTINATION BEFORE YOU EVER CAME INTO
[1:02:15] THE EARTH AS A HUMAN BEING.
[1:02:17] SO, OH, LET LIFE COME WITH ITS UPS AND
[1:02:20] DOWNS. LET IT HAVE ITS ITS ITS
[1:02:22] DISAPPOINTMENTS. BUT I KNOW MY REDEEMER
[1:02:25] LIVING. [laughter]
[1:02:26] HALLELUJAH. NOTHING CAN KEEP ME HERE.
[1:02:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:30] LIKE I SAID TO YOU SUNDAY, YOU'RE GOING
[1:02:32] TO BE ALIVE FOR A [screaming] LONG TIME.
[1:02:34] AMEN.
[1:02:35] THIS LIFE IS MEAN, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:02:37] THAT THIS LIFE MEANS VERY little
[1:02:40] once you start realizing God's great
[1:02:42] purpose
[1:02:44] and that you're a part of it.
[1:02:47] The stress, the pressure, the anxiety of
[1:02:50] present distresses, we get them, don't
[1:02:51] we?
[1:02:52] Oh, yeah.
[1:02:53] Amen.
[1:02:54] I don't I'm not standing here tonight
[1:02:57] under any certain particular one. You
[1:02:58] may not may may not be maybe somebody is
[1:03:01] I'm I'm not aware that but that's beside
[1:03:04] the point that doesn't change the
[1:03:06] principle of God's word that the stress
[1:03:09] or whatever it is or pressure that WE GO
[1:03:11] THROUGH. REMEMBER I SAID TO YOU YOU'RE
[1:03:13] GOING TO BE THERE AND THAT'S NOT AN
[1:03:15] ENCOURAGEMENT. That's a warning.
[1:03:18] That's a warning. SEE, BECAUSE GOD KNOWS
[1:03:22] HOW TO GET YOU THERE. HIS WORD HAS
[1:03:25] ALREADY FORESEEN IT AND IT'S COMING TO
[1:03:28] PASS. You're literally living out
[1:03:30] prophecy, YOU KNOW, AND BECAUSE WHETHER
[1:03:33] IT'S STRESS, WHETHER IT'S PRESSURE,
[1:03:35] WHETHER IT'S ANXIETY, NO MATTER WHAT
[1:03:37] KIND OF DISTRESS IT IS, YOU KNOW, BUT
[1:03:39] BUT YOU YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IT IS
[1:03:43] THE ANXIETY AND THE PRESSURE THAT WE ARE
[1:03:46] UNDER THAT LITERALLY RELEASES THE WORD
[1:03:49] OF GOD TO GO TO WORK.
[1:03:52] AMEN. DO DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN BROTHER
[1:03:54] BRANDHAM SAID PAUL KEPT SAYING LORD HEAL
[1:03:56] MY EYES AND THE LORD WILL HEAL HIM? He
[1:03:58] get devil put it back ON HIM. LORD HEAL
[1:04:00] MY AND THE LORD WILL HEAL HIM. DEVIL PUT
[1:04:02] IT BACK ON HIM. LORD PLEASE HELP ME. THE
[1:04:03] LORD WILL HEAL HIM AND THE DEVIL PUT IT
[1:04:05] BACK ON HIM. AND THE LORD PLEASE HEAL ME
[1:04:07] AGAIN. FINALLY BROTHER SAID GOD JUST
[1:04:09] SAID Paul my grace alone all by itself
[1:04:13] that's sufficient. THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU
[1:04:15] NEED. YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ALL
[1:04:17] THIS STUFF. AND BROTHER R SAID, WHEN
[1:04:18] PAUL CAUGHT THAT, HE SAID, "WELL, THEN I
[1:04:22] WILL [screaming] GLORY IN MY AFFLICTION.
[1:04:24] FOR WHEN I'M WEAK, I'M STRONG." THAT
[1:04:28] SOUNDS RIDICULOUS. WHEN YOU'RE WEAK,
[1:04:30] YOU'RE STRONG. WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN?
[1:04:32] UH BECAUSE [screaming] WHEN I'M WEAK,
[1:04:33] THEN HE'S IN CHARGE.
[1:04:35] AND WHEN HE'S IN CHARGE, THERE'S NOT
[1:04:37] ENOUGH DEVILS TO STOP ME
[1:04:40] CUZ THEY COULDN'T STOP HIM. [screaming]
[1:04:44] SO LITERALLY THE THE DISTRESSES THAT'S
[1:04:47] LITERALLY WHAT RELEASE. DON'T LAMENT
[1:04:48] THAT. DON'T DON'T LET THE DEVIL BEAT YOU
[1:04:51] ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH THAT. YOU
[1:04:53] UNDERSTAND FRIENDS? THAT'S WHY PETER
[1:04:54] SAID, "DON'T EVEN THINK OF FIERY TRIALS.
[1:04:57] IT'S NOT UNFAIRNESS. IT'S GOD'S LOVE.
[1:04:59] GOD RICH IN MERCY." EVEN JESUS LEARNED
[1:05:02] OBEDIENCE.
[1:05:04] AMEN.
[1:05:05] By the things he suffered.
[1:05:08] THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT REALLY RELEASE
[1:05:11] THE POWER IN THE WORD for the hour that
[1:05:13] we live in. You release it.
[1:05:16] You release God's power in his word
[1:05:19] because your distress brings a
[1:05:22] desperation. And desperation is a
[1:05:24] manufacturing plant that produces one
[1:05:26] thing, faith.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:28] Hallelujah. And brother BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:05:30] IT'S TOO BAD THAT WE CAN'T, you know,
[1:05:32] MAKE OURSELVES DESPERATE. LIKE YOU
[1:05:34] THINK, MAN, I'LL JUST I'LL JUST TURN
[1:05:35] THAT FACTORY ON. AND I'LL JUST GET
[1:05:37] DESPERATE AND PRODUCE ALL THE FAITH I
[1:05:38] NEED. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.
[1:05:41] YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE A LOWLY HUMAN. SO,
[1:05:43] GOD HAS TO COME DOWN WITH DISTRESS AND
[1:05:45] STRESS AND PRESENT DISTRESSES AND
[1:05:47] ANXIETIES AND TROUBLES AND ALL KINDS OF
[1:05:49] THINGS. WHY? BECAUSE THEN YOU START
[1:05:51] FEELING A DESPERATION. AND WHEN YOU
[1:05:53] START FEELING A DESPERATION, THE WHEELS
[1:05:55] OF FAITH START TURNING AND YOU LITERALLY
[1:05:57] BEGIN TO CALL ON GOD'S WORD. AND NOW YOU
[1:06:00] YOU BECOME THE ONE WHO'S CALLING THE
[1:06:02] WORD INTO ACTION. AMEN.
[1:06:05] AND THAT IS GOD'S DESIGN. [screaming]
[1:06:09] SEE, YOU RELEASE IT. THAT'S EXACTLY
[1:06:13] GOD'S design and allowing the trial in
[1:06:16] the first place. THAT'S GOD'S DESIGN IN
[1:06:18] ALLOWING THE HARDSHIP. SEE, and I want
[1:06:21] to SAY TO YOU TONIGHT that he won't
[1:06:24] allow you to avoid it.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:27] Or go around it. So, I want to say to
[1:06:30] you tonight, take courage because you're
[1:06:33] gaining.
[1:06:35] I don't care what might be happening to
[1:06:37] you tonight or what might be happening
[1:06:39] to me tomorrow. We're gaining.
[1:06:42] I didn't I DIDN'T SAY THE TRIAL IS NOT
[1:06:44] HARD. I'm not MINIMALIZING YOUR TRIAL.
[1:06:47] I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE NOT
[1:06:49] SUFFERING. WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU ARE
[1:06:53] GAINING. AMEN.
[1:06:54] OH, IF I I I I COULD JUST ALMOST CLOSE
[1:06:57] RIGHT THERE AND JUST SAY THIS IS THE
[1:06:59] LAST THING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT
[1:07:01] IS YOU'RE GAINING. YOU'RE WINNING. THE
[1:07:03] WORLD THINKS THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS.
[1:07:04] THEY HAVE KNOWN NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT
[1:07:06] MEANS TO WIN OR TO GAIN. I'VE WON THE
[1:07:09] GREATEST PRIZE. I FOUND A PEARL OF GREAT
[1:07:11] PRIZE. I FOUND ETERNAL LIFE. I FOUND
[1:07:15] EVERYTHING.
[1:07:17] HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:19] SEE, IT'S GOD'S CONFIDENCE IN YOU. CAN
[1:07:22] YOU ACCEPT THAT?
[1:07:24] AMEN.
[1:07:25] FRIENDS, I brought this sermon to you
[1:07:26] tonight to say that I want
[1:07:29] I want and I hope you want with me. I
[1:07:32] want to excel.
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:37] I want the position of the first
[1:07:42] resurrection.
[1:07:44] I want to go in the rapture.
[1:07:48] Amen.
[1:07:49] Amen.
[1:07:49] Does that shock you?
[1:07:52] It shouldn't SHOCK ANYBODY. I WANT TO GO
[1:07:54] IN THE RAPTURE.
[1:07:56] I WANT TO BE ALIVE AND REMAIN WHEN THE
[1:07:58] SAINTS COME BACK.
[1:08:01] I WANT TO LIVE IN THAT NEW CITY. I WANT
[1:08:03] TO BE A PART OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.
[1:08:06] I'M SORRY IF THE WORLD THINKS THAT'S
[1:08:08] SELFISH. IT'S NOT. I'M TRYING TO TAKE
[1:08:10] EVERYBODY WITH ME. I CAN. WHOEVER WILL
[1:08:12] COME ALONG WITH ME. COME ON. COME ALONG.
[1:08:14] [screaming] HOW MANY WANT TO COME ALONG
[1:08:16] WITH ME TODAY?
[1:08:18] OH, THOSE ARE [screaming] MY GOALS. BUT
[1:08:20] LISTEN FRIENDS, I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
[1:08:22] TODAY. THOSE ARE MY GOALS FOR THERE. TH
[1:08:25] THAT'S WHAT I LONG TO ENJOY in that new
[1:08:28] world.
[1:08:30] But I long to experience these high
[1:08:34] realities of the living God now. Right
[1:08:38] now IN MY LIFE, I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE
[1:08:41] REWARD. I'M GRATEFUL THAT MY FUTURE IS
[1:08:44] BRIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU, I DON'T CARE
[1:08:46] WHAT'S HAPPENING. IF YOU'RE A BELIEVER
[1:08:47] IN THE WORD, YOUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT.
[1:08:50] YOUR FUTURE IS ALREADY SECURED.
[1:08:53] [screaming]
[1:08:54] HALLELUJAH. AND I I SO I DON'T HAVE TO
[1:08:57] WORRY ABOUT MY FUTURE. WHAT I GOT TO DO
[1:08:59] IS SAY, LORD, I WANT TO BE A PART OF
[1:09:01] THAT GROUP DOING GREAT EXPLOITS. I WANT
[1:09:03] TO HAVE EXCELLENCY. I WANT TO I WANT TO
[1:09:05] SUPERABOUND.
[1:09:08] I WANT TO EXPERIENCE THEM. I WANT TO
[1:09:11] KNOW HIM IN THE POWER OF HIS DEATH AND
[1:09:12] RESURRECTION.
[1:09:15] I want to be related to that ram caught
[1:09:17] in the thicket.
[1:09:19] Amen.
[1:09:19] I remember years ago
[1:09:22] the Lord just just a young minister and
[1:09:25] I began to study that and I just
[1:09:26] thought, "Wow, there's so much types and
[1:09:29] symbols there and I began to search
[1:09:31] through the message and cross reference
[1:09:33] scripture and break down. I remember is
[1:09:36] when I had my very first Hebrew and
[1:09:38] Greek uh Bible and and I would study
[1:09:41] from it and I and brother Brandham would
[1:09:45] would go into that ram because it was a
[1:09:47] perfect it was perfectly Christ
[1:09:50] and and because Abraham remember we
[1:09:52] preached on that Abraham needed a
[1:09:54] sacrifice other than his son and God and
[1:09:58] he said God shall provide himself a
[1:10:00] sacrifice and literally it was a spoken
[1:10:03] word creation.
[1:10:05] And if you'll notice, I remember I
[1:10:07] remember years ago when I was looking at
[1:10:08] that and I I began to break down the the
[1:10:11] types because because you remember that
[1:10:14] he's caught by his his horns
[1:10:16] right
[1:10:17] in the in the thicket
[1:10:20] and the the the the word the Hebrew word
[1:10:23] first of all the horns meant his
[1:10:25] strength. The horns of a ram are his
[1:10:28] strength. Brother Ram talks about that
[1:10:30] the the horns are the strength. AND AND
[1:10:32] SO AND WHAT IS THE STRENGTH? IT WAS
[1:10:34] CHRIST. SO WHAT'S THE STRENGTH OF
[1:10:35] CHRIST? HIS CHARACTER. WHAT KEPT HIM ON
[1:10:37] THE CROSS? HIS CHARACTER. You think THAT
[1:10:41] THOSE PEOPLE COULD HAVE KEPT HIM THERE?
[1:10:44] HE SAID, "DON'T YOU KNOW I COULD
[1:10:46] PRESENTLY RIGHT NOW CALL FOR 12 LEGIONS
[1:10:49] OF ANGELS AND MY HEAVENLY FATHER WOULD
[1:10:52] SEND HIM. HE'D DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD
[1:10:53] AND START OVER WITH ME. AMEN.
[1:10:57] NO MAN TAKES MY LIFE. I LAY IT DOWN. I
[1:11:01] WILL PICK IT UP.
[1:11:03] BUT WHAT HELD HIM ON THAT? WHAT WHAT
[1:11:05] THEY SAID, "COME DOWN AND SAVE YOURSELF
[1:11:08] AND SAVE US." BUT WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW
[1:11:10] IS WHAT HE KNEW THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IS
[1:11:13] THAT IF HE CAME DOWN, HE COULD SAVE
[1:11:15] HIMSELF, BUT HE COULDN'T SAVE THEM.
[1:11:18] AND HE WANTED TO SAVE ME AND HE WANTED
[1:11:20] TO SAVE [screaming] YOU. AND HIS
[1:11:22] CHARACTER HELD HIM THERE.
[1:11:25] NO ONE COULD FORCE HIM TO STAY THERE.
[1:11:28] OH, NATURE WOULD HAVE RELEASED HIM.
[1:11:30] HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:32] SEE, BUT SO HIS HORNS WERE HIS CHARACTER
[1:11:35] AND THAT'S WHAT HE WAS CAUGHT BY.
[1:11:38] AMEN.
[1:11:38] AND THE THICKET THAT THE HORNS WERE
[1:11:40] CAUGHT IN, IT'S A HEBREW WORD THAT MEANS
[1:11:43] LIKE IT'S IT'S LIKE ME, LIKE MESH, LIKE
[1:11:46] WEAVING, LIKE A BASKET,
[1:11:48] LIKE THEY WEAVE. IT'S LIKE MESHED
[1:11:50] TOGETHER AND WEAVE. YOU SEE, WHEN HE
[1:11:52] CAME TO MELZDC, ALL HE DID WAS TAKE SOME
[1:11:56] SOIL, GRABBED SOME COSMIC LIGHT, SOME
[1:11:58] POT ASH, SOME CALCIUM, AND BROTHER
[1:12:00] BRANDHAM SAID HE BLEW A BODY AND STEPPED
[1:12:02] INTO IT AND went and MET ABRAHAM AND
[1:12:05] BLEW ANOTHER BODY, ANOTHER BODY, AND
[1:12:07] HERE'S HIS ANGELS. AND THEY GO WALKING
[1:12:09] DOWN AND AND WHEN WHEN AND WHEN HE WAS
[1:12:12] DONE WITH THAT BODY, HE JUST STEPPED
[1:12:13] BACK OUT OF IT, DISASSEMBLED IT BACK TO
[1:12:15] ITS PARTS. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[1:12:17] "WE DON'T NEVER HEAR NO MORE ABOUT
[1:12:20] MELZDC BECAUSE HE BECAME JESUS CHRIST."
[1:12:25] BUT JESUS DIDN'T JUST IT WASN'T LIKE HE
[1:12:28] COULD JUST STEP IN A BODY AND STEP OUT.
[1:12:31] HE WAS THE ONLY BEGOTTEN. HE WAS BORN OF
[1:12:34] A WOMAN. HE HAD CRISSCROSSED HIMSELF.
[1:12:38] GOD [screaming]
[1:12:39] CROSSED HIMSELF WITH HUMANITY AND HE
[1:12:42] COULDN'T JUST STEP OUT OF IT. HE SAID,
[1:12:45] "IT'S WRITTEN IN THE BOOK CONCERNING ME.
[1:12:48] I HAVE COME TO DO THY WILL, OH LORD.
[1:12:51] I'M NOT GOING TO EVACUATE. I'M NOT GOING
[1:12:53] TO LEAVE. I'M NOT GOING TO DESERT MY
[1:12:55] FAMILY. I'M GOING TO [screaming]
[1:12:56] CALVARY. I'M GOING TO JERUSALEM." AND
[1:12:59] THEY'LL THEY'LL THEY'LL CRUCIFY ME.
[1:13:01] LORD, IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU. GET
[1:13:02] BEHIND ME. [screaming] NOTHING'S GOING
[1:13:04] TO STOP ME FROM GIVING MY LIFE.
[1:13:09] HE WAS CAUGHT BY HIS HORNS AND THE
[1:13:12] THICKET. His character as a man held him
[1:13:18] there
[1:13:19] and he he didn't want to die as a human.
[1:13:23] See, surrendering to God, like brother
[1:13:26] Brandham says,
[1:13:29] you got to be neutral. If you want to
[1:13:31] know the will of God, important matters,
[1:13:33] get neutral.
[1:13:34] Yeah.
[1:13:35] Before you pray, pray to get neutral.
[1:13:37] Because otherwise, if you're not
[1:13:39] neutral,
[1:13:40] you'll pray leaning toward your desire.
[1:13:43] Amen.
[1:13:43] And you can't help it.
[1:13:45] Yeah.
[1:13:46] So he said first you got to get neutral.
[1:13:48] That's what Jesus did.
[1:13:51] Neutrality doesn't mean the absence of
[1:13:53] will cuz Jesus said not my will.
[1:13:58] Yeah.
[1:13:59] He had a will. Brother Brham said he was
[1:14:01] young. He wanted to live. He had his
[1:14:03] brother and he didn't want to die a
[1:14:05] cruel, horrible death. He loved life. He
[1:14:08] loved his father.
[1:14:10] He loved doing miracles. But but but he
[1:14:13] comes and he SAYS IF IT'S POSSIBLE LET
[1:14:15] IT PASS. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. Very well.
[1:14:18] Then not my will today I surrender.
[1:14:21] That's what Gethsemane was all about.
[1:14:22] Friends what we need is a fresh
[1:14:23] Gethsemane.
[1:14:25] We talk about following him to Calvary.
[1:14:26] You understand that starts with
[1:14:28] Gethsemane.
[1:14:29] That's where you got to surrender and
[1:14:31] say, "Lord, no more me. I just want you.
[1:14:34] I'm done with me. I just want to be
[1:14:36] you." And whatever it takes, Lord God,
[1:14:40] you were held to that cross by your
[1:14:42] character. Nobody could have brought you
[1:14:44] down. The Bible said he will see his
[1:14:47] seed and be satisfied.
[1:14:50] When he was ON THE CROSS, I WAS ON HIS
[1:14:54] MIND. WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS, YOU
[1:14:57] [screaming] WERE ON HIS MIND.
[1:15:00] Oh my.
[1:15:02] I want to say tonight that my life is
[1:15:05] written. It's written in the scrolls
[1:15:07] concerning me. It's written in the
[1:15:09] scrolls concerning you. Your your
[1:15:12] liberty tonight is to say, "I have come
[1:15:16] to do thy will, oh God."
[1:15:18] Amen.
[1:15:19] That's real freedom.
[1:15:22] Give me liberty or give me death.
[1:15:27] If I can't have the liberty to say
[1:15:30] whatever is written in the scrolls
[1:15:32] concerning me, I have come to do thy
[1:15:35] will
[1:15:37] for me. There's no other purpose in
[1:15:40] life.
[1:15:40] That's right.
[1:15:41] Yep. I'll I'll pay bills and I'll take
[1:15:44] vacations and I'll preach the gospel and
[1:15:46] I'll buy new vehicles, but none of that
[1:15:48] stuff matters. It's all going to ash and
[1:15:51] cinder. You understand? It's all going
[1:15:53] to ash and cinder. I'm not worried about
[1:15:55] an idol if Jesus fails. I'M NOT WORRIED
[1:15:57] ABOUT A DOCTOR OR A BANK ACCOUNT IF
[1:15:59] JESUS FAILS. JESUS WON'T FAIL.
[1:16:03] HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LEFT
[1:16:04] HOLDING THE BAG. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
[1:16:06] BE ASHAMED. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE NOT
[1:16:08] GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED AT THE END TIME,
[1:16:10] FRIENDS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:13] OH, my life is written in the word.
[1:16:17] For me, there is no curtain be.
[1:16:21] It's just whatever's written about me in
[1:16:24] the word.
[1:16:26] Let me finish right here.
[1:16:30] Brother Brandham,
[1:16:33] being a human being,
[1:16:36] you remember how that he he said to the
[1:16:39] Lord, he said, you know, I'm I've been
[1:16:41] preaching this long. I've went around
[1:16:43] the world and people's rejected my
[1:16:45] message. And look, I I just want to can
[1:16:48] I just go back into the mountains? You
[1:16:50] said I was a prophet. Everybody said I'm
[1:16:53] a prophet. I've never called myself
[1:16:55] that. But the people have called me
[1:16:57] that. And I know what you said on the
[1:16:58] river. And I know the commission. I know
[1:17:01] I I know what I'm called to do. But you
[1:17:04] called me to be a prophet. So I just
[1:17:06] want to go into the wilderness. And
[1:17:07] listen, if you have something you want
[1:17:09] to tell the people, just come tell me.
[1:17:10] And I'll stomp out of the wilderness
[1:17:12] like Elijah and I'll go tell the people.
[1:17:14] And then I'll go back to my trapping and
[1:17:15] my fishing and my hunting. I just want
[1:17:17] to be left alone.
[1:17:20] See, don't don't deny William Brandham
[1:17:23] being a human.
[1:17:25] Don't deny him the privilege of being a
[1:17:28] human.
[1:17:30] See,
[1:17:31] that's why that deity spirit is so
[1:17:34] acidic.
[1:17:35] That's why it's so poisonous.
[1:17:37] It takes away a a God-given privilege to
[1:17:40] say, just like David, Lord, remember I
[1:17:44] am but dust.
[1:17:47] You don't know how many times that's
[1:17:48] been my refuge when I couldn't think of
[1:17:50] anything else to say to explain my
[1:17:52] terrible weakness. I just say, "Lord,
[1:17:56] remember I'm but dust." And David said
[1:17:58] that and you honored it, so I'm saying
[1:18:00] it, too. Oh my. AND HE HE WHAT WHAT DID
[1:18:06] HE WANT? HE HE ACTUALLY HE HE WANTED TO
[1:18:10] LIVE A noble
[1:18:12] and sufficient
[1:18:15] life of a prophet. Just a just a
[1:18:20] sufficient
[1:18:22] barely making the grade. I'm already
[1:18:24] tired and worn out. I just want to go
[1:18:27] into the wilderness and I just want to
[1:18:29] be a sufficient prophet's life. But God
[1:18:34] told him,
[1:18:36] God didn't deny his reasoning
[1:18:39] because he said, "Look, they did that.
[1:18:41] Elijah did that. They all did that.
[1:18:43] Isaiah, Jeremiah, they lived. Micah,
[1:18:45] they lived out there." And you'd send
[1:18:46] them, they'd come in with a message and
[1:18:47] go back. They didn't have to
[1:18:51] constantly, you know, fend off these
[1:18:53] things. But the Lord said to him, "But
[1:18:57] you have been called to more than that.
[1:19:02] Amen.
[1:19:04] So no,
[1:19:05] YOU CAN'T JUST GO BE A SUFFICIENT
[1:19:08] PROPHET.
[1:19:09] AMEN.
[1:19:10] NO, BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO MORE
[1:19:15] than that. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT
[1:19:17] WOULD ALMOST WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WAS
[1:19:20] ESSENTIALLY SAYING
[1:19:22] WOULD BE LIKE AS IF I SAID, "LORD, you
[1:19:25] know, living at the level of a bride,
[1:19:28] [sighs]
[1:19:29] man, the world is 2023 and oh my
[1:19:32] goodness, it's so difficult. How about
[1:19:34] this, Lord? How about you just let me
[1:19:36] live like a foolish virgin and I'll get
[1:19:37] eternal life at the judgment bar?" And
[1:19:40] okay, you know, you know what the Lord
[1:19:42] would say to me? But you've been called
[1:19:44] to more than that.
[1:19:46] DO YOU UNDERSTAND TONIGHT? YOU CAN'T
[1:19:49] GIVE GOD SOME SAD, SORRY
[1:19:52] TO SAY, I'M JUST TOO TIRED. I CAN'T
[1:19:54] PRESS ON. AND THE LORD WOULD SAY BACK TO
[1:19:57] YOU, THAT MIGHT BE FINE FOR OTHERS. BUT
[1:19:59] YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO MORE THAN THAT.
[1:20:02] YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU'VE BEEN CALLED TO MORE
[1:20:05] THAN THAT. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO
[1:20:06] [screaming] JUST TO JUST BE ON SOCIAL
[1:20:08] MEDIA AND HAVE LIKES AND FRIENDS. YOU'VE
[1:20:10] BEEN CALLED TO MORE THAN THAT. WE'VE
[1:20:13] BEEN CALLED HIGHER AS A CHURCH. WE'VE
[1:20:14] BEEN CALLED HIGHER AS A MINISTRY TEAM.
[1:20:17] WE'VE BEEN CALLED MORE [screaming] AS
[1:20:18] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:20:20] AND I WANT I DON'T WANT MEDIOCRITY. I
[1:20:22] DON'T WANT SUFFICIENCY. I WANT
[1:20:24] EXCELLENCY.
[1:20:26] I WANT TO PRESS TOWARD THE MARK OF A
[1:20:28] HIGH CALLING. THERE'S A GREAT PRIZE
[1:20:30] THERE.
[1:20:32] OH, I'VE BEEN CALLED TO A HIGHER ORDER.
[1:20:35] ONE THAT CAN FILL ME WITH ALL THE
[1:20:37] FULLNESS OF HIM, WITH ALL OF his
[1:20:39] knowledge, with all of his character,
[1:20:41] with all of his power and order. And and
[1:20:45] and I just tell you something, friends.
[1:20:47] I I JUST SAY TONIGHT THAT I'M WILLING to
[1:20:50] press harder. I'm willing to fight
[1:20:52] longer. I'm willing to live higher. How
[1:20:55] many are in here TONIGHT WITH ME SAY,
[1:20:57] "I'LL TAKE THAT WAY. I'M WILLING TO
[1:20:59] PRESS HARDER. I'M WILLING TO FIGHT
[1:21:01] LONGER. I'M TIRED, [screaming] BUT I'M
[1:21:03] GOING TO FIGHT ON. I'M I'M WEARY, BUT
[1:21:05] I'M GOING TO PRESS THE BATTLE. I'M GOING
[1:21:07] TO LIVE HIGHER. I'M GOING TO LIVE HIGHER
[1:21:09] TODAY THAN I DID YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW.
[1:21:11] I'M GOING TO LIVE HIGHER STILL.
[1:21:14] HALLELUJAH. ARE [screaming] WE WILLING,
[1:21:15] FRIENDS, EVERY ONE OF US IN HERE TONIGHT
[1:21:17] TO SAY, "I'M WILLING TO DO IT, LORD GOD.
[1:21:21] I'M WILLING TO CARRY THE EXTRA WEIGHT
[1:21:23] AND THE RESPONSIBILITY
[1:21:25] THAT IT REQUIRES." Are we willing to You
[1:21:28] say, "I DON'T I DON'T KNOW, PASTOR. I
[1:21:32] DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I'M WILLING TO DO
[1:21:33] THAT. THEN THEN ARE YOU WILLING TO BOW
[1:21:36] YOUR HEAD WITH ME RIGHT now all across
[1:21:38] this building? Are you willing to ask
[1:21:40] the Lord to make you willing? Are you
[1:21:43] willing tonight to say, "Lord, very
[1:21:46] well, make me more sincere.
[1:21:49] Make me more sincere, Lord. Make me
[1:21:52] willing, OH GOD, TONIGHT. MAKE ME, LORD,
[1:21:56] MAKE THIS AUDIENCE, FATHER, HANDS UP
[1:21:59] GOING OVER THE BUILDING. LET'S STAND UP
[1:22:01] TO OUR FEET, FRIENDS. LET'S RAISE UP
[1:22:03] HANDS TO HIM RIGHT NOW AND SAY, "LORD
[1:22:05] GOD, I I WANT TO BE WILLING, LORD.
[1:22:07] SOMETIMES I I FEEL MAYBE I'M NOT WILLING
[1:22:10] TO PAY THAT [screaming] PRICE OR BEAR
[1:22:12] THAT RESPONSIBILITY. SO, I'M ASKING YOU,
[1:22:14] MAKE ME MORE WILLING, OH GOD, MAKE ME
[1:22:17] MORE SINCERE. FATHER, HELP ME. GIVE ME A
[1:22:20] FRESH STRENGTH TO HAVE A FRESH
[1:22:22] SURRENDER." OH, may you grant it to us,
[1:22:25] Lord, tonight. We're just humble people.
[1:22:28] Oh friends, why don't you just raise up
[1:22:30] a hand to him? Say, "Lord, we're but
[1:22:32] dust tonight." But Lord, we're called.
[1:22:35] It's written and [clears throat] my life
[1:22:37] is recorded in the scrolls. IT'S WRITTEN
[1:22:39] ABOUT ME. I CAN'T ESCAPE IT. I'M HERE TO
[1:22:42] DO thy will, oh God.
[1:22:45] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:22:48] Thank you, Father. Thank you for these
[1:22:50] honest hearts tonight. Is there another
[1:22:52] tonight? Anybody want to raise their
[1:22:54] hand? Say, "Lord, remember me, preacher.
[1:22:56] Remember me, pastor." Ask God to give it
[1:22:58] to me too. Hallelujah. God bless you
[1:23:01] friends. God bless you.
[1:23:04] You know I I remember Come musicians.
[1:23:08] Come please. I remember
[1:23:11] uh one of the brothers on our our
[1:23:14] call-in. I think it was brother Joshua I
[1:23:15] believe. Tremendous brother, tremendous
[1:23:18] preacher. I want to try to get him down
[1:23:20] here sometime.
[1:23:23] And
[1:23:25] he was talking about
[1:23:27] he made an astonishing statement. He
[1:23:29] says llukewarmness can be a great place
[1:23:30] to be in
[1:23:33] what? And he said because you see he
[1:23:36] said that's where God can come and get a
[1:23:38] hold of your heart and lift you up out
[1:23:41] of there and make you want to come up
[1:23:43] higher. So I thought to myself, wow,
[1:23:47] that being the case, then the devil
[1:23:50] really can't win.
[1:23:52] He really can't win. Even if he pulls me
[1:23:56] down into low altitudes, you know all
[1:23:59] that'll do? That'll just turn me and
[1:24:01] I'll start crying out to God because
[1:24:04] there's something down inside of me. I
[1:24:06] wonder if there's a witness here
[1:24:07] tonight. Say, there's something won't
[1:24:09] let me live in those low altitudes. I'm
[1:24:12] an eagle. I got to soar high. I got to
[1:24:15] feel the breezes. I got to fly into the
[1:24:17] sun. Oh, I got to feel those currents
[1:24:20] under my wings. I I I wasn't born to
[1:24:22] live here uh a a as dumb driven cattle
[1:24:26] of the earth. God has called us to more
[1:24:29] than that. I thought about Abraham
[1:24:32] looking for that city. Brother Brandon
[1:24:34] said
[1:24:36] he didn't even know right where he was
[1:24:38] building his altar. It was just above
[1:24:40] him.
[1:24:42] Amen.
[1:24:43] It was just above him.
[1:24:46] You know, tonight
[1:24:48] a lot of times we can find ourselves
[1:24:52] in a low estate.
[1:24:55] And I I don't I I fully don't know fully
[1:24:59] why I'm preaching this sermon tonight.
[1:25:03] Maybe it's somebody in this building.
[1:25:04] Maybe it's somebody on the stream. Maybe
[1:25:06] it's somebody on archive. Maybe it's all
[1:25:08] of the above.
[1:25:09] Amen. I'd like to think it's all of the
[1:25:11] above starting right here.
[1:25:15] And and maybe we all need to have a
[1:25:17] fresh realization.
[1:25:19] Listen,
[1:25:20] that joy you've been looking for, it's
[1:25:23] just above you.
[1:25:25] [sighs] That peace you've been wanting.
[1:25:27] Like you're like Abraham. You're
[1:25:29] offering a sacrifice. You're praying.
[1:25:31] You're He was looking for something. You
[1:25:33] say, "I'm looking for peace. I'm looking
[1:25:34] where's MY JOY, MY SALVATION. WHERE'S
[1:25:36] THE PEACE? WHERE'S THE FAITH? WHERE'S
[1:25:38] THE HAPPINESS I ONCE HAD? IT MIGHT BE
[1:25:40] LIKE ABRAHAM. IT MIGHT BE JUST ABOVE
[1:25:42] YOU. I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, YOU
[1:25:45] HAVE THE GRAND PRIVILEGE TO RISE UP
[1:25:47] HIGHER.
[1:25:48] GET UP INTO THAT SHIKINA GLORY. YOU'LL
[1:25:50] FIND YOUR JOY THERE. YOU'LL FIND YOUR
[1:25:52] PEACE THERE. YOU'LL FIND YOUR STRENGTH.
[1:25:54] YOU'LL FIND YOUR FAITH THERE.
[1:25:57] AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN? THEN
[1:25:59] GOD WILL START moving things around your
[1:26:02] life and bringing you out of that. You
[1:26:04] know what the beauty of that will be? is
[1:26:07] that you'll get victory and there won't
[1:26:12] be one thing yet that has changed. It'll
[1:26:16] be you that changed.
[1:26:18] Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] It It doesn't require one thing to
[1:26:22] change to go up higher into God. It'll
[1:26:26] be you that changes. And then when that
[1:26:30] happens, that's when God will come on
[1:26:31] the scene and start moving those things
[1:26:34] around that you were so worried about.
[1:26:37] Don't don't fear. That's the first thing
[1:26:40] the angel would say to [music] brother
[1:26:41] Brandham. So the first thing out of his
[1:26:43] mouth, fear not.
[1:26:45] Oh friends, get away from reasoning.
[1:26:48] Don't let the devil pull you into
[1:26:51] [music] reasoning. Oh my my my my. Amen.
[1:26:55] Amen. Brother Matt, uh, I'm going to
[1:26:58] jump you here. That song you sung and
[1:27:00] you brought me forward with.
[1:27:03] Yeah. I want to sing that. Yeah.

[1:30:47] What words? My my my my. I only have uh
[1:30:51] one request that came in from brother
[1:30:53] Bruce. I've gone actually I just thought
[1:30:54] of a second one. Um brother Bruce Paris
[1:30:57] says, "I have a prayer request for
[1:30:58] Sister Linda.
[1:31:00] As I mentioned in previous text, she had
[1:31:03] injections in her hips which has been
[1:31:06] very beneficial. On Monday, Wow. She had
[1:31:09] six injections in her lower spine.
[1:31:11] However, it hasn't shown any pain
[1:31:14] reduction to date. We recognize the Lord
[1:31:17] can use any method he chooses to bring
[1:31:19] about healing or relief. So, we're
[1:31:22] holding on to his promise that by his
[1:31:25] stripes, we're healed regardless of the
[1:31:27] symptoms. Looking forward to this
[1:31:30] evening's [music] service. Amen. Uh God
[1:31:32] bless you, Brother Bruce. Brother Bruce,
[1:31:34] take courage. Tell sister Lynn, take
[1:31:36] courage. Sister Jean had the exact same
[1:31:38] thing and it took it took a little
[1:31:40] while. Amen. For that to begin to work.
[1:31:42] It's God's mercy. Amen. How many be
[1:31:43] praying for our sister? I say, Lord, let
[1:31:46] this medication have its designed
[1:31:47] effect. It came out of God's laboratory.
[1:31:50] He allowed mankind [music] to discover
[1:31:52] it. Amen. To care for his hurting
[1:31:54] children. Amen. My son Chris and Katie,
[1:31:57] man, their flight has been terrible
[1:31:59] trying to get home and uh they got
[1:32:02] delayed in customs. Tried to get a
[1:32:04] flight, missed it. Looks like they're
[1:32:06] going to try to get in in Atlanta very
[1:32:08] late tonight and then and either they
[1:32:11] have to spend the night and fly out the
[1:32:12] next morning or knowing Chris, he'll
[1:32:14] grab a car and try to drive 5 hours in.
[1:32:17] So, I just want the Lord's mercy. Amen.
[1:32:20] Will you all join me for him and Katie?
[1:32:22] Amen. Amen. Join hands with somebody
[1:32:24] near you or put your arm around him.
[1:32:26] Let's pray. Father, we're asking in the
[1:32:29] name of the Lord Jesus for these
[1:32:30] requests, Lord God, whe they're
[1:32:33] important, Father. And we our heart now,
[1:32:35] Lord, we we're joining together, Lord,
[1:32:38] to believe that you are going to allow
[1:32:40] Sister Linda to come to relief, Lord
[1:32:42] God. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:32:45] Lord, that you speed the effects, LORD
[1:32:47] GOD. FATHER, THAT THAT SHE DIDN'T GO
[1:32:49] THROUGH those injections for nothing,
[1:32:52] LORD. I PRAY THAT YOU WILL ALLOW IT TO
[1:32:54] WORK ACCORDING, FATHER, TO YOUR PERFECT
[1:32:56] WILL. MAY OUR SISTER be painfree. I pray
[1:33:01] you'll grant it to her, Lord, in
[1:33:03] tenderness and with love. We ask this
[1:33:05] favor of thee. Lord, may your blessing
[1:33:07] be upon her and sister Bruce [music] and

[1:33:34] Lord Jesus Christ upon him. Even right
[1:33:36] now, Lord God, do all things according
[1:33:38] to thy supernatural power, [music] thy
[1:33:40] great love for them. His great desire,
[1:33:43] Lord, he was so thrilled to realize he
[1:33:45] could be back for the week, for the
[1:33:47] meetings this weekend, and the devil has
[1:33:49] fought that tooth and nail. But Lord, I
[1:33:51] I you're going to grant it to him. And
[1:33:53] it's the desire of his heart to be here.
[1:33:55] Father, we commit it now. But Jonathan
[1:33:57] and Martha who are still abroad, I pray
[1:33:59] for your great blessing upon them, upon
[1:34:02] Uriah. Lord God, we we ask for your
[1:34:04] great mercy, Lord, on these things in
[1:34:07] Jesus name. Amen. I apologize if
