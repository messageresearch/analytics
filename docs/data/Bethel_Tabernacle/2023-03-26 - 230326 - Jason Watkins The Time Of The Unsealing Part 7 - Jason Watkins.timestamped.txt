[44:58] earth and the top of it reached to
[45:00] heaven and behold the angels of God
[45:03] descending ascending and descending
[45:07] on it
[45:08] and the Lord stood above it and said I
[45:12] am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[45:14] and the god of Jacob I'm sorry the god
[45:17] of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to
[45:21] thee will I give it and to thy seed
[45:25] and thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[45:28] earth and thou shalt spread abroad to
[45:30] the West love this Thou shalt spread
[45:33] abroad to the west and to the East and
[45:35] to the north and to the South and in
[45:37] thee and in thy seed shall all the
[45:40] families of the earth be blessed
[45:43] and behold I am with thee and will keep
[45:46] thee in all places whether thou goest
[45:48] and will bring thee again into this land
[45:50] for I will not leave thee until I have
[45:53] done that which I have spoken to thee of
[45:57] we had a request I can't get to it here
[46:00] but sister Elizabeth sent in a request
[46:02] for a friend we want to pray over that
[46:05] and then we had an internet request
[46:06] prayers for a family I apologize if
[46:09] you're listening
[46:11] um not set up to get it here I was and I

[46:31] I'm asking for your mercy in that case
[46:33] for our dear sister Elizabeth Lord the
[46:36] request that she has sent in how you've

[46:59] we commit ourselves into your hands
[47:01] bodily Lord in Jesus name amen God bless
[47:05] you friends you can be seated
[47:10] so Ethan I emailed the PowerPoint I
[47:12] imagine you've got it oh you're the man
[47:14] all right
[47:17] amen like having Dependable people
[47:19] praise the Lord
[47:24] and you just uh forgive me if I'm just
[47:27] compelled to move as quickly as I
[47:29] possibly can but I do want to get to
[47:32] everything this will be part seven
[47:33] there'll definitely be a part eight
[47:35] because that's more of a high octane
[47:38] version and I didn't have the the the
[47:41] gears for that today so uh this just
[47:44] came to me almost I I told Brother Matt
[47:47] I said I could almost call this part 6B
[47:49] because it really is still very close to
[47:53] my heart and whenever that happens when
[47:56] things get real close to my heart I know
[47:57] it's the Lord wanting me to come back
[48:00] and re-emphasize it and re-emphasize it
[48:02] and re-emphasize it in fact is it's uh
[48:05] it's been the most I would say the most
[48:07] profound point that I've made in this
[48:09] series and I've read to you uh it's not
[48:13] on this PowerPoint we'll get to that in
[48:14] a moment Ethan am I controlling
[48:17] I will see we'll we'll give it a try
[48:22] okay perfect okay excellent but I don't
[48:26] have this up here because I'm only going
[48:28] to make a few one or two lines out of
[48:30] this lengthy quote where we have been
[48:32] speaking about the desire in our heart
[48:36] to see the things that brother Branham
[48:38] talked about in our in our day that
[48:40] should be fulfilled the power of the
[48:42] spoken word the third pull we put all of
[48:44] these things in kind of pull them
[48:46] together the opening of the word the
[48:48] Dynamics of this church will be a
[48:50] refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've
[48:52] operated in a small way that when we've
[48:55] seen we've seen things in a in a in a
[48:58] limited way but when as the squeeze
[49:00] begins to tighten we'll see them uh in
[49:03] their fullness and where and and what
[49:06] one thing that I've really desired to do
[49:08] and I've labored at quite extensively I
[49:10] hope you uh have have have retained this
[49:14] is one of the big things I want you to
[49:16] retain one of the big ones we're not
[49:19] chasing something
[49:21] we're not chasing something we don't
[49:23] chase those things we don't we're not
[49:25] our our Wednesday night our Thursday
[49:27] night men's prayer meeting we're not in
[49:29] here praying for gifts we're praying for
[49:31] the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit to fall
[49:34] Upon Us amen because we're 60 years in
[49:37] friends that first perfect bright age
[49:40] church under Paul only had about 20
[49:43] years in their perfection and then they
[49:45] slipped they began to decline and then
[49:47] they slip off into the ages and Christ
[49:49] has to begin interceding for ignorance
[49:51] but at the end time he promised he would
[49:53] restore it all back and now here we are
[49:55] 60 years and I don't want to I don't
[49:58] just want to think oh it's just someday
[50:00] somewhere down the road I'm here to tell
[50:02] you you're down the road
[50:03] and we see that the signs are moving
[50:06] everywhere and I am looking for God to
[50:10] keep his word he has he is and he shall
[50:14] so we're not absent of God's power we've
[50:16] already seen Dynamics we've already seen
[50:19] cancerous tumors disappear multiple
[50:22] times we've already seen great
[50:24] Deliverance take place we're having
[50:26] people come under the power of the Holy
[50:28] Spirit young people getting the getting
[50:30] the token giving their life to the Lord
[50:31] I'm here to tell you something we are
[50:33] not without the the authority of Heaven
[50:37] behind us
[50:39] saved healed to deliver
[50:41] where we will we know that the word of
[50:44] God is a is more than a match for Satan
[50:47] any time anywhere and under any
[50:50] condition
[50:51] amen we challenge him right readily we
[50:54] don't back up we're not looking for a
[50:56] treaty I don't need an armist I hate
[50:58] that dude I want him dead and I want him
[51:00] out of your life and out of your homes
[51:02] and I want him I want his tentacles off
[51:04] of me
[51:07] I told you I'm not very good at staying
[51:08] calm
[51:12] now here's the second big point
[51:14] remember first one we're not chasing
[51:17] something we're humbling ourselves and
[51:20] letting God do what he does so well his
[51:24] way
[51:26] say all right what's the requirement we
[51:28] have emphasized to you and I would have
[51:31] to say that this tops all points I have
[51:34] made now in this seventh part of this
[51:37] series it comes from here that that when
[51:41] brother Branham could not understand how
[51:44] that in Mark 11 Jesus said if you say
[51:46] because brother Brandon said that puts
[51:48] it on me and he said I I just said
[51:50] everything's got to be in the atonement
[51:52] it has to be Christ how can that be me
[51:54] saying it like as if I got to go out
[51:56] here and figure out in my jumbled up
[51:58] head how when what where how to say what
[52:01] to say when to say who to say what do I
[52:03] say
[52:04] and yet and yet the Lord had tormented
[52:07] him I think we we went through that you
[52:09] saw brother Branham exasperated who are
[52:12] you what do you want
[52:14] I'm out here I don't even know our voice
[52:16] is talking to me where's the light I
[52:18] don't see it
[52:20] and it's God training his Prophet for
[52:23] for our training
[52:25] because brother Branham came to realize
[52:27] that when the Holy Spirit gave him the
[52:30] key and said it's not you you know when
[52:33] you when you hey you know when when you
[52:35] go and you're telling people who they
[52:38] are where they're from what's wrong with
[52:40] them you're going into their secret life
[52:42] you're telling them a conversation they
[52:44] had in their doctor's office you're
[52:46] describing their doctor
[52:48] even his glasses even his weight
[52:51] you're even trying to pronounce a
[52:53] medical term he said you can't pronounce
[52:57] and the woman says it for him yeah
[52:58] that's a guy I heard him say that
[53:01] it was the exact word
[53:03] and and and and God just said him to you
[53:06] really think that's you doing that
[53:08] and brother Branham caught it instantly
[53:10] in a moment an epiphany no Lord that's
[53:13] always been you he said do you think
[53:15] that it was in those prophets in the Old
[53:17] Testament you think that was them you
[53:19] think that was them you think that was
[53:20] Elijah deciding what to say or do and he
[53:23] said no Lord it was the Holy Spirit in
[53:25] them crying out then whatsoever you say
[53:28] if if if if everybody say if if your
[53:32] anointed wouldn't be you saying it it
[53:35] would be the Holy Spirit saying it I
[53:38] want that kind of anointing
[53:42] say what do I have to do to get there
[53:44] well I I would just say before I give
[53:47] you the answer can I ask you are you
[53:48] willing to give whatever it takes
[53:51] here's what it takes
[53:53] well I thought if that be that's right
[53:56] if the person through the atonement see
[53:59] it is to be the atonement because it's
[54:01] Christ
[54:02] if the person
[54:04] through the atonement of Christ
[54:06] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:09] can live into a sphere with God so close
[54:13] and he can be wrapped so completely in
[54:18] God by the blood of Jesus that it
[54:20] wouldn't be him talking it would be the
[54:22] Holy Spirit speaking these things if he
[54:26] can live if I can live if you can live
[54:29] in the Spheres of God if I can be so
[54:31] wrapped in God if you can be so wrapped
[54:34] in God I'm here to tell you it won't be
[54:36] you speaking
[54:38] it'll be christ-speaking
[54:40] and there's never ever been a devil able
[54:45] to resist Christ speaking
[54:50] we talked to you and we preach the whole
[54:52] sermon on it and I don't want to go into
[54:53] it today for first of all I don't want
[54:55] time but we live
[54:59] I made a statement to you that we live
[55:03] the reality between Acts 2 and 2 Timothy
[55:06] 4 8 and you remember of course that
[55:09] you know second that acts 2 was the was
[55:12] The Upper Room experience but we have
[55:15] taught you that you know now now the
[55:18] church had to go on in growth and Paul
[55:21] had to come in and lay the order of the
[55:23] word and and and you find that you know
[55:27] we we you you're born again by the Holy
[55:29] Spirit that's that's just the beginning
[55:31] of your climb
[55:33] that by the time you come over into
[55:35] second Timothy 4 8 you're going to find
[55:38] that Paul has grown and the church has
[55:41] grown and he's come to tremendous
[55:43] accomplishments and this is where we're
[55:46] coming to friends this has always been
[55:49] the plan
[55:50] that that a church that was the plan in
[55:53] the alpha age that they take a body
[55:55] change they were on their way to it they
[55:58] had every element they needed only they
[56:00] fell away now in the larger sense I get
[56:02] it because it the seed had to go into
[56:05] the ground that's absolutely true it had
[56:07] to go into the ground you know uh it it
[56:10] because Jesus said except this corn of
[56:12] wheat die divideth alone but if it died
[56:14] comes back into many remembered form so
[56:16] that church had to follow the pattern of
[56:18] Christ and but now here we are with the
[56:21] grand privilege you're the that's the
[56:23] greatest age that's ever been you have
[56:24] the grandest privilege that's ever been
[56:26] had by the church that you're going to
[56:28] be the people to actually finish this
[56:30] thing to take a body change
[56:33] to pick up where they began to decline
[56:36] and carry it on to the coming of the
[56:38] Lord
[56:40] and it's going to take the Dynamics of
[56:42] the Holy Ghost and it's going to be a
[56:43] people who's going in the Rapture those
[56:45] people who are already living in a
[56:47] sphere of God already surrendered to God
[56:50] and that is my my entire heart today in
[56:54] this sermon is that we've got to be
[56:56] completely surrendered to God
[57:02] so we you know we identify ourselves
[57:07] with the Acts 2 people and because of
[57:09] that we seem odd to the world I'm happy
[57:11] to be to be odd
[57:13] we like those in the book of Acts are a
[57:16] people
[57:17] that are more than merely convinced and
[57:20] in our in our minds like the clothes in
[57:23] the book of Acts they were more than
[57:26] merely convinced in their minds we are
[57:28] morally more than merely convinced in
[57:31] Our Minds when we heard like them when
[57:34] we heard the word made clear under
[57:37] Divine interpretation it didn't prick
[57:40] our minds it pricked our hearts
[57:43] there's a lot of things that I don't
[57:45] understand about God in my mind but I
[57:48] know he lives in my heart
[57:51] and that's what I wanted all my life
[57:53] since a boy I only wanted to be a
[57:55] servant of the Lord from the youngest
[57:57] age I can remember I said Lord someday
[57:59] let me be a servant to you and and I had
[58:02] my time just like any one of you where
[58:05] I'm walking you know and maybe varying
[58:07] degrees of sanctification without a real
[58:10] trans real New Birth experience and a
[58:12] lot of things I'd be ashamed of today
[58:14] but I'm here to tell you he found me one
[58:16] day he tracked me down he knocked me
[58:19] down and when he picked me up I was a
[58:21] new man
[58:25] we like they follow the command of the
[58:27] word
[58:28] and we repented
[58:30] we took his name in baptism and from
[58:33] there
[58:33] we from there like those people we have
[58:37] continued in the doctrine of the
[58:38] Apostles and Prophets that's what they
[58:41] did that's the very first thing that you
[58:44] see that's the very first proof no
[58:47] wonder Prophet could say the evidence
[58:49] said the angel told him the evidence of
[58:51] the Holy Ghost is to say Amen to the
[58:53] word not mental assent
[58:55] but actually your life becomes a living
[58:57] voice
[58:58] see it's not just saying amen means I
[59:01] agree with it I understand it the devil
[59:04] agrees with it but he's not born again
[59:06] he knows the will of God he refuses to
[59:08] do it see but he you the Apostle said
[59:11] you believe in God good for you the
[59:14] devil does too
[59:15] oh guess what the devil does too see so
[59:19] brother Brandon said he's not born again
[59:20] he believes they sail for you just
[59:22] believe you're born again well the devil
[59:23] believes
[59:24] he's certainly not born again he'd be my
[59:26] brother
[59:28] so so we realize it's got to go more
[59:30] from the head into the heart saying amen
[59:33] is saying Lord so be it unto me
[59:36] according to Thy word whatever your word
[59:38] commands me to do amen whatever it tells
[59:41] me to go forward amen whatever I got to
[59:43] separate from amen what is your life my
[59:46] life is an amen
[59:48] if I make a mistake the word says repent
[59:51] I say Amen then the word says get back
[59:54] up and go forward I say Amen
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:58] Hallelujah
[1:00:01] so we follow that's the very first thing
[1:00:04] they did after they were baptized the
[1:00:07] Bible said and they continue daily with
[1:00:09] the apostles that continued
[1:00:11] was the evidence of the new birth it was
[1:00:13] their saying of Amen
[1:00:15] to all the words they heard
[1:00:18] like John
[1:00:20] when he wrote in chapter 1 verses 4 and
[1:00:23] 5 we found that speaking of Christ in
[1:00:26] him was life
[1:00:28] and the life was the light of men
[1:00:32] I tell you something friends once I
[1:00:34] found this source of life I never have
[1:00:36] been able to let go
[1:00:38] once I found the source of life I've
[1:00:40] never wanted to let go I can't relate to
[1:00:44] wanting to go back to the world I can't
[1:00:46] even get my mind around that I can't
[1:00:48] believe how long I stayed out there
[1:00:51] oh my
[1:00:54] brother Brandon makes a statement also
[1:00:55] not on the overhead I don't believe I
[1:00:57] have it um
[1:00:59] let me did my screen go dark on me
[1:01:05] if I put this one oh I did praise the
[1:01:09] Lord
[1:01:10] God said let there be light
[1:01:13] now what if he just said it and no light
[1:01:16] come
[1:01:18] then we don't know whether it's true or
[1:01:20] not
[1:01:23] okay now I I hope you're Gathering
[1:01:26] something you've got a I've indicated
[1:01:28] Prophet saying
[1:01:29] that you could you could be excused if
[1:01:32] if God made you a promise and didn't
[1:01:34] keep it you'd almost be ready to say
[1:01:36] well now I don't even know if it's true
[1:01:37] because he can't keep his word that's
[1:01:39] how vital you think God isn't careful to
[1:01:43] keep his word
[1:01:45] you think he's going to give the devil
[1:01:48] one grain of evidence to bring an
[1:01:50] accusation against Christ
[1:01:52] see
[1:01:54] so he said if he if he'd have said it no
[1:01:56] light come then we don't know whether
[1:01:57] it's true or not we don't know whether
[1:01:59] he is all right we don't know whether he
[1:02:02] is God or not he just said let there be
[1:02:06] and there wasn't
[1:02:08] I can't believe how many people
[1:02:11] give their allegiance to words that are
[1:02:14] lies
[1:02:16] and they follow the allegiance to
[1:02:19] laodicea to the God of this evil age who
[1:02:23] promises everything and gives nothing
[1:02:26] promises you all the pleasures of sin
[1:02:29] but lends you up in a devil's hell
[1:02:31] destroyed and not just waiting for that
[1:02:33] hell but many people have had their
[1:02:35] lives brought to Hell on Earth because
[1:02:37] they follow the lies
[1:02:40] as if the liar had the authority and
[1:02:43] they followed it
[1:02:49] so he says
[1:02:52] so when God speaks and we see it
[1:02:55] then that's light that shines forth the
[1:02:58] truth of the word now you're looking at
[1:03:00] a principle
[1:03:03] you can cross-reference that and apply
[1:03:05] it to every situation
[1:03:06] when when God speaks that's number one
[1:03:11] and you see it come to pass then that is
[1:03:14] light that shines forth all right that's
[1:03:17] the truth of the word
[1:03:19] see so there is light and life all right
[1:03:25] so when you when you think about it that
[1:03:29] way I'll just leave it right there
[1:03:31] so now we know that we have say brother
[1:03:35] Jason
[1:03:36] how do you know how can you assure me
[1:03:39] that what we have today and we call it
[1:03:42] the message of this hour how do you know
[1:03:44] that it's an authentic message from God
[1:03:46] because a cloud appeared over Arizona no
[1:03:50] no
[1:03:51] because they took a picture of it in
[1:03:54] Houston and that's actually in
[1:03:55] Washington and you have to go in and ask
[1:03:57] and get an appointment they'll bring it
[1:03:58] out and show it to you and it has been
[1:04:00] scientifically proven and it's right
[1:04:02] there in their Halls
[1:04:04] yeah I've seen it been right there
[1:04:06] so is that why you know it's authentic
[1:04:08] no that's not why I know those things
[1:04:10] are wonderful I love those kinds of
[1:04:12] things I because of all because of all
[1:04:15] the different things that came to pass
[1:04:16] in the prophet's life miraculously
[1:04:18] that's wonderful we're rejoice in those
[1:04:19] things I would expect those things those
[1:04:21] appeared in lives of prophets it's not
[1:04:23] uncommon it shouldn't shock you see
[1:04:27] what should what what is shocking is
[1:04:29] when people will follow after the world
[1:04:31] that has none of that operating in it
[1:04:34] say but then what is it how do you know
[1:04:36] what do you what do you put on it
[1:04:39] because I know it's true life because I
[1:04:42] know I know it's true light because of
[1:04:45] the life it produces in my soul
[1:04:50] I have seen too many cases around the
[1:04:54] world 35 years on six continents and
[1:04:57] whenever I bring this message this light
[1:04:59] it changes people from the ground up and
[1:05:03] they are forever born again in the
[1:05:05] spirit of God their lives emulate the
[1:05:08] scripture they their whole desires are
[1:05:11] changed that's how I know it's the truth
[1:05:13] because that's the principle
[1:05:17] when it's light it will produce Life
[1:05:19] John said that of Jesus in him was life
[1:05:23] and the life was the light of men
[1:05:25] so you know you have True light when it
[1:05:28] brings life it's not so easy
[1:05:32] so everything let me further say
[1:05:35] they further say it this way
[1:05:38] not only what I've seen it do in me but
[1:05:40] I can say everything that the message
[1:05:42] was to produce it is doing it has and it
[1:05:47] is continuing still even in these
[1:05:51] unprecedented times when it's too
[1:05:53] impossible there's no way you should be
[1:05:56] a Survivor but you're gonna stand on the
[1:05:58] other side as laodicea
[1:06:01] and when you when the brown the brother
[1:06:03] Brown says when the when the rewards are
[1:06:05] handed out and every age stands because
[1:06:06] every message has got to come forward
[1:06:08] with his age and when they when the call
[1:06:10] goes out now Let the Church of laodicea
[1:06:12] arise there will be a hush go over the
[1:06:14] people oh this is the layout of sins how
[1:06:19] did you ever make it it was so dark we
[1:06:23] thought nobody could survive it and here
[1:06:26] we are surviving it
[1:06:28] and I'm not only surviving it I'm
[1:06:31] thriving in it I'm more of a Believer
[1:06:33] today hallelujah hallelujah I'm more of
[1:06:37] a Believer today than I've ever been in
[1:06:39] my life
[1:06:41] oh my
[1:06:44] more more the more that I Surrender
[1:06:48] the lighter my load Hallelujah
[1:06:51] with every day
[1:06:55] every day
[1:06:57] becoming
[1:06:59] more deceptive
[1:07:01] perverted
[1:07:03] and Evil
[1:07:06] with sin
[1:07:08] becoming easier and easier to sin in
[1:07:12] modern day access to the tree of
[1:07:15] knowledge
[1:07:16] pulling more and more
[1:07:18] God's children closer and closer to
[1:07:22] their poisonous influences
[1:07:24] so you excuse me if if I want to stand
[1:07:28] and be on this pulpit and I want my
[1:07:30] Ministry team to stand and beat on this
[1:07:32] pulpit and say repent come back to God
[1:07:35] don't play around with the world get rid
[1:07:39] of those Devils get them out of your
[1:07:40] life you see something in your life get
[1:07:41] rid of it right quick
[1:07:43] don't allow that guy any influence into
[1:07:47] your life
[1:07:48] you go to school you get contaminated
[1:07:50] young people don't think you don't don't
[1:07:52] think those evil spirits don't have your
[1:07:54] number they've got a Playbook with your
[1:07:56] name on it they know where your buttons
[1:07:58] are they know how to get you yo I I say
[1:08:01] parents how how dare you send children
[1:08:04] out the door without Gathering them
[1:08:06] under your arms and pleading the blood
[1:08:08] of Jesus and say God go with my children
[1:08:10] into the sinful world today
[1:08:13] oh my
[1:08:15] God I remember Sister Debbie put that in
[1:08:18] practice when the boys were in public
[1:08:19] school she would never back out of the
[1:08:21] driveway without prayer we don't do it
[1:08:24] to this day we don't back out of the
[1:08:25] driveway without prayer it's an evil
[1:08:28] world
[1:08:34] and of course you know
[1:08:35] you have the challenge and
[1:08:38] people can say what they want not here
[1:08:40] to get onto that but
[1:08:42] you know the challenge is well after hey
[1:08:46] yeah you're right after 60 years
[1:08:48] the bride ain't perfect yet
[1:08:51] well the Rapture ain't happened yet
[1:08:56] that's my answer
[1:08:58] he's still working on me this thing
[1:09:01] ain't over yet and I'm glad because I
[1:09:03] still got loved ones I want to see in
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:09] the bottom line is that I can see it
[1:09:11] moving in that direction very distinctly
[1:09:13] more so than any other thing out there
[1:09:16] it promises
[1:09:18] this message promises it doesn't promise
[1:09:21] you a Bed of Roses far from it
[1:09:24] Jesus never said it would be easy he
[1:09:26] only said it would be worth it
[1:09:30] it promises to turn Hearts back to the
[1:09:33] original faith of the early church has
[1:09:35] it done it and reproduce that perfect
[1:09:38] expression again
[1:09:39] living yet through imperfect people has
[1:09:43] he done it is he doing it
[1:09:45] amen
[1:09:46] say it's a perfect message running to
[1:09:48] imperfect people yeah how do you know
[1:09:51] because I know I'm imperfect and I know
[1:09:53] I want to be perfect
[1:09:55] so there's something driving me there's
[1:09:58] an Artesian well from the inside that
[1:10:00] Jesus described as Living Waters flowing
[1:10:03] out of your insides and I want to have a
[1:10:05] clean stream
[1:10:06] Hallelujah
[1:10:10] we have a limited view Enoch had a
[1:10:12] limited view we where they all had a
[1:10:14] limited view we can only you know when
[1:10:16] we look at Enoch there's a lot we don't
[1:10:18] know the Bible references a whole
[1:10:21] book of Doctrine from Enoch that we
[1:10:23] don't have that God didn't allow us to
[1:10:25] have and preserve they have books of
[1:10:27] Enoch but they're not uh endorsed by the
[1:10:30] Holy Spirit at least certainly not never
[1:10:32] uh under the prophet's Ministry
[1:10:35] but but you know what what we can do is
[1:10:38] we can see some Clues we can here's what
[1:10:41] we can see and I guess here's the real
[1:10:42] important thing is that we can see by
[1:10:45] the what we are told in the Bible that
[1:10:47] he walked with God
[1:10:49] and God took him
[1:10:52] I'll take that
[1:10:54] I'll take that I don't have to know what
[1:10:56] happens tomorrow I'm not worried about
[1:10:58] what happens in the world all I know is
[1:11:00] he not walk with God and God took him
[1:11:03] how many want to walk with God
[1:11:07] see one day he was there
[1:11:10] next day was gone
[1:11:13] that church of Paul's day was well on
[1:11:16] its way to that body change likened to
[1:11:18] his glorious one
[1:11:20] with each new era
[1:11:22] where the gospel spread they could see
[1:11:24] it trending towards something they could
[1:11:26] see that church could see it moving Paul
[1:11:28] could see it moving in a Direction
[1:11:31] it backslid God knew it would as we said
[1:11:35] the seed had to go into the ground
[1:11:37] then then something you know it's it's
[1:11:39] running along and it's even the shadow
[1:11:43] of the Apostles people are being healed
[1:11:45] and
[1:11:46] and the Holy Ghost is falling on the
[1:11:47] Gentiles and everywhere and there's
[1:11:50] great signs and wonders and persecution
[1:11:52] is starting and the these are Everyday
[1:11:54] People you understand like you they had
[1:11:56] everyday lives and lived in countries
[1:11:57] and Nations and had jobs and paid bills
[1:12:00] understand they were just like you and
[1:12:02] me they got up every day and fought the
[1:12:03] devil and went to bed every night and
[1:12:05] thanked God
[1:12:06] they're your brothers and sisters of
[1:12:09] that of that Alpha Church we're the
[1:12:11] Omega Church we're here to finish it see
[1:12:14] they laid out the foundation they gave
[1:12:16] us a road map we know how to go we know
[1:12:18] what the Holy Ghost is like because we
[1:12:20] can read it
[1:12:22] it dissolves the mystery that's what
[1:12:24] that's what we find that God is he's a
[1:12:27] dissolver of doubts
[1:12:30] and then something happened so something
[1:12:32] so devastating
[1:12:34] we see after 20 years or so the church
[1:12:37] began to cool
[1:12:38] the cry goes out from all the apostles
[1:12:40] they start beating on pulpits and
[1:12:42] writing letters and and the word starts
[1:12:45] calling for correction get back on track
[1:12:47] you need to earnestly contend for the
[1:12:49] faith once delivered you're starting to
[1:12:51] slip you're starting to go sideways
[1:12:53] James is killed Paul leaves the scene
[1:12:56] this one goes this one dies this one
[1:12:57] goes Thomas is is murdered and and it's
[1:13:00] happening and people are saying my
[1:13:01] goodness what's going on we thought the
[1:13:03] Lord would be here tomorrow
[1:13:06] and God didn't let him know it would be
[1:13:07] 20 centuries he didn't let them know it
[1:13:09] would discourage them
[1:13:10] brother Adam said he he wouldn't tell
[1:13:12] him that John come back and wrote it in
[1:13:14] a book locked up in mystery and no one
[1:13:17] knew what it meant see
[1:13:21] so we can't know through them you say it
[1:13:25] this way
[1:13:27] we can't know through them
[1:13:31] what the bride
[1:13:33] just before the catching away will just
[1:13:36] exactly look like
[1:13:38] and we got Clues we can see the way
[1:13:41] here's the biggest here's your biggest
[1:13:43] helper Hebrews 13 8. I'll promise you
[1:13:46] whatever happens it'll be the same Jesus
[1:13:48] Christ that it's ever been and that's
[1:13:50] how you'll know I don't know what
[1:13:52] exactly it's going to look like when
[1:13:53] when the Dynamics of this church are
[1:13:56] refilling of the Holy Ghost when we've
[1:13:58] operated things in a small way but when
[1:14:00] the squeeze comes it'll be in its
[1:14:01] fullness we read all of these things we
[1:14:03] don't know I don't know what all that's
[1:14:05] going to look like I don't know exactly
[1:14:07] what's going to happen to to the Kremlin
[1:14:09] I don't know I know eventually they're
[1:14:11] destroyed in a tribulation I don't know
[1:14:13] who what when how or where that the
[1:14:15] Vatican is going to burn under atomic
[1:14:17] fire but it will
[1:14:19] I don't know when our Western Seaboard
[1:14:21] will be lost but it's doomed
[1:14:23] we don't know will we be here we won't
[1:14:25] will that be the resurrection morning
[1:14:26] well not I don't know how's it going to
[1:14:28] go down I don't know but I do know this
[1:14:30] it'll be Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:14:32] today and forever
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:35] they had Clues we have Clues they knew
[1:14:38] that your day would be filled with
[1:14:39] perilous times Paul writes about it in
[1:14:41] the spirit
[1:14:43] he knew there would be a there had to be
[1:14:45] a revealing of the man of sin
[1:14:48] the church knew that they would have to
[1:14:50] return they never saw this
[1:14:52] a lot of this they never saw never saw
[1:14:55] the man of sin revealed like we have now
[1:14:57] they had the work of the Antichrist it
[1:14:58] was already working in the church
[1:15:01] see but it was it was they were starting
[1:15:03] to drift under that
[1:15:04] and it would be a message at the end
[1:15:06] time that would call us back and smack
[1:15:08] us around and go pay attention there
[1:15:10] there there's a fine line between it
[1:15:12] Christ and Antichrist they say how fine
[1:15:14] so close it's a Razor's Edge
[1:15:16] what's the effect it would actually
[1:15:18] deceive the very elected if that were
[1:15:20] possible that's how tricky it is
[1:15:23] no wonder we need to live in the Spheres
[1:15:25] of God no wonder we need a surrendered
[1:15:28] life every day I'm here to tell you
[1:15:30] you've never been this way before you
[1:15:31] better stay close to the word of God
[1:15:34] Hallelujah that's what Joshua told the
[1:15:36] children of Israel you've never been
[1:15:38] this way stay close to the priesthood
[1:15:40] they're carrying the ark they're
[1:15:43] following the pillar of fire Hallelujah
[1:15:47] oh my
[1:15:51] they never had to face the days of Lord
[1:15:53] and Noah as a double barrel threat
[1:15:56] they never had to face Satan's Eden they
[1:15:58] were only four thousand years deep in
[1:15:59] this building
[1:16:01] they never had to see the time Satan
[1:16:04] fulfilled his prophecy that he would
[1:16:05] have sinned and become like God and be
[1:16:08] the god of the evil age
[1:16:10] they never had to they never had to work
[1:16:12] through that like we do
[1:16:14] they could see it coming Jesus
[1:16:16] prophesied of it Paul told about it
[1:16:19] that men would give give that at the end
[1:16:21] time mankind will lose the ability to
[1:16:24] deserve between right and wrong it'd be
[1:16:25] let aside by enticing Spirits you're
[1:16:28] there you're here
[1:16:30] that day is this day
[1:16:33] see you've got the double barrel threat
[1:16:35] of lot and Noah no age ever had to face
[1:16:37] that double threat except the last stage
[1:16:41] but they also knew
[1:16:43] that at that time there you would
[1:16:46] receive power from on high because the
[1:16:49] Bible tells us about it how that there
[1:16:52] would come a power there would come an
[1:16:54] anointing there would come a presence at
[1:16:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ and you
[1:16:59] have the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:04] they knew they later they figured out
[1:17:06] you know that what happened they were
[1:17:08] able to see what happened in the upper
[1:17:10] room they they were able to go back in
[1:17:11] Prophecy and say this is what's
[1:17:13] happening is what Joel
[1:17:16] said would happen
[1:17:19] so you know we don't know how what or
[1:17:22] how the evolution to a body change
[1:17:25] would have looked like had they kept
[1:17:27] going
[1:17:29] but neither does the devil
[1:17:33] he's guessing at it he don't even have
[1:17:35] your level of revelation
[1:17:37] Hallelujah he has a nervous breakdown
[1:17:39] every day you've got the peace that
[1:17:40] passes understanding
[1:17:42] Hallelujah so he has to figure it out on
[1:17:44] the Fly he won't succeed
[1:17:47] he'll be too he's already too late
[1:17:50] this bread is already called out she's
[1:17:52] already impregnated she's already
[1:17:54] growing to Mount Zion
[1:17:56] Hallelujah
[1:17:58] 60 years have taught us quite a bit
[1:18:03] now I can only see it trending towards
[1:18:05] something again and I say what is it
[1:18:07] we're writing another book of Acts
[1:18:11] every chapter describes
[1:18:14] every chapter can I can I read from you
[1:18:16] from the book of Acts that we're writing
[1:18:20] someday they'll read it on the other
[1:18:21] side we get to read this one here that
[1:18:25] family over there I'll get to read our
[1:18:26] book over there
[1:18:28] and they'll turn to chapter after
[1:18:30] chapter and after chapter and chapter
[1:18:32] and verse will show unprecedented and
[1:18:35] the unprecedented impossibility for
[1:18:39] anyone to have ever survived it they'll
[1:18:41] read in every chapter that it'll
[1:18:43] describe an unparalleled sin condition
[1:18:46] in the world but then they'll read the
[1:18:48] next verse and it'll say but the Saints
[1:18:51] kept pressing on and it was impossible
[1:18:54] but they would not stop
[1:18:57] ongoing
[1:18:59] Hallelujah
[1:19:03] it looks hopeless when they read it
[1:19:05] until they read the next verse
[1:19:07] the Saints pressed on harder it got
[1:19:10] harder so they pressed harder it got
[1:19:12] worse so they became more determined it
[1:19:15] got impossible so they believed for the
[1:19:17] impossible
[1:19:19] they would not be denied they would not
[1:19:21] be pushed off they would not be held
[1:19:23] back I'm going in a Rapture and there's
[1:19:26] not enough devils in hell to stop me
[1:19:28] Hallelujah
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:34] how did you make it read the next
[1:19:37] chapter okay oh I see you kept coming to
[1:19:40] the house of God
[1:19:41] I see you kept raising up holy hands I
[1:19:44] see that you kept singing no matter how
[1:19:47] dark it got you kept singing no matter
[1:19:49] how difficult you kept worshiping no
[1:19:52] matter what how many lies you stuck to
[1:19:54] Jesus
[1:19:55] you stayed close to him
[1:19:57] the preachers kept preaching
[1:20:00] families kept praying
[1:20:04] what happened in the next chapter well
[1:20:06] it was the next day what did they do
[1:20:08] they pushed a little harder
[1:20:11] what about the day after that they
[1:20:12] pushed some more
[1:20:14] they pushed to the West like he like he
[1:20:17] said to Jacob yo he told Abraham
[1:20:21] after after he separated from lot
[1:20:25] and then you find in Genesis the first
[1:20:27] time God says to Abraham
[1:20:29] now lift up your eyes and the Bible says
[1:20:31] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:20:33] first time you see it look Northeast
[1:20:36] West South everything you see I'm giving
[1:20:39] you now he's confirming it in Jacob
[1:20:40] where we read in our text and it'll go
[1:20:43] Westward and it'll go Southward and
[1:20:45] Eastward and northward and and and and
[1:20:47] that's what our book of Acts is going to
[1:20:49] say how did you keep going how did you
[1:20:51] get it around the world I don't know we
[1:20:53] just pressed Westward we pressed
[1:20:54] Eastward we pressed northward we pressed
[1:20:57] Southward and this revealed word we knew
[1:21:00] that all the families of the Earth would
[1:21:02] be blessed in this word
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:07] and with every new chapter of the book
[1:21:09] of Acts
[1:21:11] we see it getting closer
[1:21:13] do you you see it getting closer friends
[1:21:17] do you feel the atmosphere do you wake
[1:21:20] every day and say Lord is this the day
[1:21:23] Hallelujah
[1:21:26] oh it consumes me night and day
[1:21:29] that's why I keep coming back to this
[1:21:31] point again and again and again we're
[1:21:33] not chasing something we're surrendering
[1:21:35] our way into something this is God's
[1:21:37] doing
[1:21:38] and it is glorious in our sight
[1:21:45] now I want to
[1:21:47] take this next turn making ready
[1:21:54] anybody got a spoken word to make that
[1:21:57] clock slow down
[1:22:01] Revelation 19 7 let us be glad
[1:22:06] and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:22:09] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:22:12] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:20] so so you find in the book of Acts where
[1:22:23] Peter's speaking to those men those
[1:22:26] devout Jews said you know you crucified
[1:22:29] him with Wicked hands however
[1:22:31] the Lord knew that you did it under
[1:22:32] determinate counsel you listened to bad
[1:22:34] leadership misinterpreted theology
[1:22:36] preachers steered you wrong
[1:22:38] you killed the Prince of Life
[1:22:40] and you know now all of your devotion is
[1:22:43] you're doomed well what men what can we
[1:22:47] do oh my goodness we're here I just
[1:22:50] traveled all the way from Arabia to come
[1:22:52] into the feast and you're telling me I'm
[1:22:54] doomed and even if I take my lamp it's
[1:22:56] no good right
[1:22:58] what can we do men and Brethren that's
[1:23:01] the that's the response of a Believer
[1:23:03] when he realizes he needs God what do I
[1:23:06] got to do just tell me what I got to do
[1:23:08] whatever you say I'm gonna do
[1:23:10] Hallelujah
[1:23:13] repent
[1:23:15] see don't despair
[1:23:17] God like Joseph God did it to save life
[1:23:20] the great couldn't hold him don't worry
[1:23:22] calm down breathe breathe
[1:23:24] the grave couldn't hold him he'd said in
[1:23:26] David don't work don't worry the word
[1:23:28] won't fail
[1:23:29] the word it didn't matter that they
[1:23:30] killed him it didn't matter that they
[1:23:32] ripped him and beat him and put him in a
[1:23:33] tomb and throw him in our dead
[1:23:36] the word of God would overcome death
[1:23:38] Hallelujah there's no power that can
[1:23:40] resist the word of God and on that
[1:23:42] Resurrection morning that same anointing
[1:23:44] shook that cold dead body and brought it
[1:23:47] back to life
[1:23:48] thrown away a stone stepped out ascended
[1:23:51] on high said all power is given unto me
[1:23:53] in heaven and earth
[1:23:55] Hallelujah go and tell my disciples I'll
[1:23:57] meet them in Galilee is exactly what he
[1:23:59] did
[1:24:02] we find that
[1:24:04] that that the word has this impossible
[1:24:08] power to it
[1:24:10] that nothing can withstand it and Peter
[1:24:12] said to them
[1:24:13] David had said he won't leave his soul
[1:24:16] in hell
[1:24:17] do you hear that for you today do you
[1:24:20] realize under the fifth trumpet that the
[1:24:21] lid was torn from Hell and Hell has come
[1:24:24] to the surface all right don't be asleep
[1:24:26] at the switch Bethel Tabernacle your
[1:24:29] children's lives are on the line hell
[1:24:31] has come to the surface but he won't
[1:24:34] leave my soul in Hell
[1:24:37] neither will he suffer his family to
[1:24:40] seek corruption
[1:24:42] Hallelujah
[1:24:44] and he raised him and then then Peter
[1:24:46] says it makes an amazing statement
[1:24:49] you know this same Jesus whom you
[1:24:52] crucified God hath made him
[1:24:56] God hath made him he learned obedience
[1:25:00] by the things he's toughered the child
[1:25:02] grew in wisdom and understanding the
[1:25:05] child humbled himself under the teaching
[1:25:07] of his parents
[1:25:09] God hath made him built him
[1:25:12] into his perfect State he learned
[1:25:15] obedience by the things he suffered now
[1:25:17] that Melchizedek high priest lives in
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:21] now you can make yourself ready
[1:25:26] you understand that it'll work just as
[1:25:29] magically for you as it did for him you
[1:25:32] put the word of God on your lips and
[1:25:34] speak it in faith that's the same as God
[1:25:36] speaking
[1:25:38] Hallelujah
[1:25:40] the bride hath made herself ready
[1:25:43] I want to look at a number of examples
[1:25:46] we'll look first we'll take a look and I
[1:25:49] just want to read through these here's a
[1:25:51] short one on the wise virgins of Matthew
[1:25:53] 25.
[1:25:55] the Bible brother Branham says the ten
[1:25:57] virgins and the hundred and forty four
[1:25:59] thousand 1960 the wise virgin with oil
[1:26:03] in her lamp what did she do
[1:26:05] she made ready brother Jason how do I
[1:26:08] make ready
[1:26:12] what do I need to do
[1:26:16] how do I overcome
[1:26:21] you see it
[1:26:23] that's how the wise virgins made herself
[1:26:26] ready
[1:26:27] she had oil in her lamp
[1:26:31] she made sure to
[1:26:33] she didn't just keep coming to church
[1:26:35] every week she made her calling and her
[1:26:38] election sure
[1:26:41] Hallelujah
[1:26:44] Rahab of Jericho
[1:26:46] let's see how she makes herself ready
[1:26:49] just exactly says here Rahab the Harlot
[1:26:51] James said was justified by works
[1:26:54] but why her faith
[1:26:57] see it's it's that's works of
[1:26:58] righteousness
[1:26:59] you remember the remember when the
[1:27:01] unwise Virgin are being judged and they
[1:27:05] get in but the other one's with works
[1:27:08] and maybe even more Works don't get in
[1:27:10] because they're exceeding Works where
[1:27:13] iniquitous works
[1:27:14] the righteous had works of righteousness
[1:27:17] that came from their heart they believed
[1:27:20] God at whatever level God revealed
[1:27:22] himself in they weren't predestinated to
[1:27:24] to be part of the Bride but they are
[1:27:26] part of the remnant of the woman's seed
[1:27:28] see
[1:27:30] all right so now
[1:27:33] was justified by works but why her faith
[1:27:37] see faith is a revelation that's a new
[1:27:38] birth
[1:27:39] all right watch see it was a holy ghost
[1:27:41] on rehab it's it's that what happened to
[1:27:44] Rahab and how she saved her life her
[1:27:47] home and her family you know what you
[1:27:49] know how that happened the Holy Ghost
[1:27:51] anointed her that same Holy Ghost to
[1:27:53] help you save your life your home and
[1:27:55] your family is living inside you
[1:27:58] she need to be delivered from Death that
[1:28:00] same holy spirit is here can deliver you
[1:28:02] from death
[1:28:03] see
[1:28:04] it's faith
[1:28:07] just exactly says here all right but
[1:28:09] hurt by her faith she said I hear that
[1:28:12] God is with you she's talking to the
[1:28:14] spies
[1:28:15] she didn't want to see how Joshua wore
[1:28:17] his hair or how he wore his clothes she
[1:28:20] said I understand that God's with you
[1:28:23] that all was necessary she made ready
[1:28:30] do you know what she did she heard
[1:28:33] recognized and acted on the word of God
[1:28:37] when Israel came and she knew that God
[1:28:40] had promised to give them her land
[1:28:44] and she heard about it she recognized
[1:28:46] these prophets these Messengers
[1:28:49] she recognized those Messengers under
[1:28:50] Joshua and they get because they're the
[1:28:53] ones who gave her the true token see so
[1:28:55] that it's all representing Christ all in
[1:28:57] symbology
[1:28:58] and so she she said I I understand that
[1:29:01] God's with you friends I hope you don't
[1:29:04] undervalue the fact that you are able to
[1:29:06] understand God when you see him I hope
[1:29:09] you don't take it lightly the whole
[1:29:11] world is groping in darkness and they
[1:29:15] have no chance to see it except God
[1:29:17] opens their eyes and he's opened your
[1:29:20] eyes
[1:29:21] oh my Hallelujah he didn't have to open
[1:29:24] my eyes he could have easily passed me
[1:29:27] by for the age I was living in was
[1:29:30] wretched poor and blind
[1:29:32] but then I heard recognizing your day
[1:29:35] serpent seed and perfect Faith the
[1:29:38] bridge and the message of Grace
[1:29:41] and Lord I Thank thee Hallelujah
[1:29:50] I'm sorry doc Meredith I just can't hold
[1:29:52] it back I know you're going to get on me
[1:29:55] I apologize to my wife
[1:29:57] oh my
[1:30:00] I understood that God I understand that
[1:30:02] God's with you that was all necessary
[1:30:04] she made ready here's the Queen of Sheba
[1:30:07] these are people who made ready I'm
[1:30:09] teaching you how they got ready
[1:30:11] so I want to make it a Rapture all right
[1:30:13] this is training this is rapture 101.
[1:30:16] Queen of Sheba
[1:30:18] and I want you to notice what that
[1:30:20] little woman had to go to get to him now
[1:30:23] she didn't come across the desert in an
[1:30:25] air-conditioned Cadillac she had to come
[1:30:27] on camels
[1:30:29] to to get to Christ is no flower bed of
[1:30:32] ease
[1:30:33] I want you to read that line with me to
[1:30:35] get to Christ is no flower bed of ease
[1:30:39] it isn't just going up and sign your
[1:30:41] name to a book and say well I'm a member
[1:30:43] of this church from now on
[1:30:45] you don't come that way it costs
[1:30:49] something
[1:30:51] that is a surrendered heart to the will
[1:30:54] of God sometimes listen listen sometimes
[1:30:58] it'll cost you your friends
[1:31:03] I hope that every person in here young
[1:31:06] and old has enough wherewithal in you to
[1:31:10] say if following this cost me all my
[1:31:13] friends I'll lose all my friends and
[1:31:15] follow this
[1:31:18] if following this cost me my family I'll
[1:31:21] lose them and follow this because Jesus
[1:31:23] said on the other side he'll give me
[1:31:24] fathers and mothers and brothers and
[1:31:26] brothers and sisters
[1:31:27] Hallelujah if you want forsake all and
[1:31:29] follow him you're not even worthy of him
[1:31:31] God came and died for you God became a
[1:31:35] man
[1:31:36] and for you the offended the guilty
[1:31:40] and died for the offenders
[1:31:43] oh my it's not a cheap gospel friends I
[1:31:46] never have allowed it to be a cheap
[1:31:48] gospel this Pulpit doesn't allow it to
[1:31:50] be a chief gospel this this word that
[1:31:52] you hold today costs the blood of
[1:31:55] Millions
[1:31:56] Martyrs laid down their lives for it
[1:32:00] Hallelujah
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:04] sometimes it costs you your friends if
[1:32:07] they it will if they're worldly friends
[1:32:11] but he that will not forsake even his
[1:32:13] own and follow after me is not worthy to
[1:32:16] be called mine it costs something
[1:32:21] oh my Lord
[1:32:26] so she made ready
[1:32:29] Queen of Sheba
[1:32:31] and with the Journey of camels
[1:32:34] it taken her at least three months to
[1:32:36] come from Sheba across that burning
[1:32:37] desert to find out whether that gift was
[1:32:40] right or not no wonder she's coming to
[1:32:41] see Solomon no wonder no wonder no
[1:32:44] wonder Jesus said she'll raise up at the
[1:32:48] day of judgment and condemn this
[1:32:49] generation
[1:32:51] he told that to his own countrymen
[1:32:53] said you self-righteous hypocrites
[1:32:56] on the day of judgment the Queen of
[1:32:58] Sheba she's not even a Jew the Queen of
[1:33:01] Sheba will rise and condemn this this
[1:33:04] wicked generation because she crossed
[1:33:06] the desert
[1:33:11] service
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:15] there's nothing like it in all the world
[1:33:18] it was up things that happened and
[1:33:20] things I heard and saw were impossible
[1:33:23] see
[1:33:25] Rebecca being prepared for Isaac Eliezer
[1:33:28] goes to get her here's another one
[1:33:30] making herself ready
[1:33:33] the end time evangelism
[1:33:36] so she made ready oh let's see I've got
[1:33:39] a that's not supposed to be there
[1:33:41] and when he found out here we go
[1:33:44] and then when alizar found the character
[1:33:47] that was right in the woman Rebecca I
[1:33:49] remember he's sitting there by The Well
[1:33:51] of life
[1:33:53] that's where William Brandon was didn't
[1:33:55] matter if he was preaching in New York
[1:33:57] Tacoma Shreveport didn't matter if he
[1:34:00] was preaching in Houston didn't matter
[1:34:01] where he was at it was in Jeffersonville
[1:34:03] he was at the well of water The Well of
[1:34:05] life
[1:34:06] trying to find a bride
[1:34:09] for Isaac
[1:34:12] when he found out and then when Eliezer
[1:34:14] found the character that was in the
[1:34:15] woman all that character
[1:34:17] Rebecca the beautiful bride of Isaac he
[1:34:20] told her about Isaac and she never
[1:34:22] questioned one thing
[1:34:24] she believed the word of the messenger
[1:34:26] and she made ready to go
[1:34:28] that now she believed the word of the
[1:34:31] messenger and made she never questioned
[1:34:33] she believed the word of the messenger
[1:34:35] she made ready to go all three of those
[1:34:37] are a direct result of the character
[1:34:42] see once and see Abraham I mean Eliezer
[1:34:45] Eliezer is praying notice in his prayer
[1:34:48] he's got conditions saying Lord let it
[1:34:50] be the one that does this and what is my
[1:34:52] camels but what is he looking for what
[1:34:54] is his mission not a woman that can
[1:34:56] water camels
[1:34:58] he's not just looking for a damsel
[1:35:00] someone who just come and give me a
[1:35:02] drink of water that wasn't it he was
[1:35:04] sent on a mission to find character
[1:35:07] and his prayer Lord let it be that I
[1:35:10] find character and this is how I'll know
[1:35:12] and then I'll tell her and she'll
[1:35:13] believe it
[1:35:14] Hallelujah
[1:35:17] watch
[1:35:19] and they went and asked the father and
[1:35:21] he said just ask her the damsels of age
[1:35:23] ask her let her decision be
[1:35:26] oh that's the kind of independent listen
[1:35:29] I don't care who the person is trying to
[1:35:32] lead you away from Christ Christ is your
[1:35:34] king
[1:35:36] Christ I don't care if it might be mama
[1:35:38] papa husband wife brother sister friend
[1:35:41] companion business career opportunity
[1:35:43] money I don't care what it is trying to
[1:35:45] lead you away from Christ you owe your
[1:35:47] allegiance to the word of God
[1:35:49] Hallelujah you're in a better position
[1:35:51] to pray for that loved one if you are
[1:35:53] see she said I will go to what to what
[1:35:59] it sounds ridiculous a man she'd never
[1:36:01] seen knowing nothing about but yet she
[1:36:04] was ready because she was predestinated
[1:36:07] and foreordained to that I have a
[1:36:10] feeling that when she observed the
[1:36:12] character of Eliezer she knew something
[1:36:14] about his master
[1:36:16] I think we could safely say when I can
[1:36:18] look at the character of our Eliezer I
[1:36:21] know quite a bit about his master
[1:36:23] amen
[1:36:24] Hallelujah
[1:36:26] so he says here she was for ordained to
[1:36:30] that we had some time we're good
[1:36:32] prostitute at Jesus feet
[1:36:38] end time evangelism carrying on same
[1:36:40] sermon
[1:36:41] he says here I'm just okay here we go
[1:36:44] don't Advance did you notice
[1:36:47] this woman washing Jesus's feet
[1:36:50] she never asked for a blessing she
[1:36:53] wasn't washing Santa Claus feet
[1:36:55] she never asked for a blessing she just
[1:36:58] looked there and there that hypocrite
[1:37:00] trying to make fun of him the greatest
[1:37:02] character that's what they were always
[1:37:05] trying to do make him look little some
[1:37:07] people you know they followed him just
[1:37:10] to do that
[1:37:11] but some poor little degraded prostitute
[1:37:15] with a few nickels that she had earned
[1:37:17] out there in her ill Fame of living
[1:37:21] she seen him sitting there and the big
[1:37:23] tears rolled down her cheeks and she
[1:37:25] went down there and got an alabaster box
[1:37:28] with all the money she had and brother
[1:37:30] Brandon tells it another story when she
[1:37:32] went into the store she knew she said oh
[1:37:35] he'll know where I got this money he'll
[1:37:37] know he's a prophet of God but she
[1:37:39] didn't care she had that she had to do
[1:37:41] something and she gave she said here's
[1:37:44] all my money I want your best she said I
[1:37:46] don't want your second best she said she
[1:37:48] didn't want second best for Jesus she
[1:37:50] wanted the best she gave all of her
[1:37:52] money
[1:37:52] he said Jesus doesn't deserve second
[1:37:55] best he deserves first
[1:37:59] in our lives
[1:38:01] where is he today in your life ask
[1:38:03] yourself that question is he first be
[1:38:06] honest
[1:38:07] you don't have a chance if you won't be
[1:38:08] honest
[1:38:10] if you just said in your theology you
[1:38:12] don't have a chance
[1:38:14] but if you'll be honest today and say
[1:38:16] Lord God I I know you need to be first
[1:38:19] and I haven't actually made you first
[1:38:21] you've kind of been second third or
[1:38:22] tenth or 11th but today today I'm
[1:38:26] turning around I'm turning northward
[1:38:28] today I'm going to make you first
[1:38:31] Hallelujah
[1:38:34] she gave all the money that she had
[1:38:38] she slipped in some way and got back
[1:38:40] there
[1:38:41] she fell down at his feet I'll make it
[1:38:43] some way I'll make it some way ain't
[1:38:45] nobody gonna keep me out
[1:38:47] she got in back there some way she way
[1:38:49] got back there and she fell down at his
[1:38:52] feet and she began to cry her hair
[1:38:54] falling down
[1:38:56] oh my brother Brandon said if some of
[1:38:58] you Pentecostal women would try to do
[1:39:00] this you'd have to stand on your head to
[1:39:02] do it because your hair is all whacked
[1:39:04] off in in complete Disobedience to God's
[1:39:07] word
[1:39:07] and she would cry and take her hair they
[1:39:12] had no towels to wash his feet and she
[1:39:14] had taken this hair and wiping his feet
[1:39:17] off what beautiful water for his feet
[1:39:20] tears of a repentant Sinner and if he'd
[1:39:24] just have moved his foot she'd have
[1:39:25] jumped she wasn't asking nothing she
[1:39:28] just seen it needed to be done
[1:39:32] why are you preaching today brother
[1:39:34] Jason why is your heart so heavy because
[1:39:35] I see it needs to be done he's worthy of
[1:39:39] your tears he's worthy of your light
[1:39:41] he's worthy of Your Allegiance
[1:39:46] brother Branham goes on
[1:39:49] I know I'm burning time but you still
[1:39:51] with me
[1:39:53] I'll suffer a lot more for this than you
[1:39:55] are right now so just carry on
[1:39:58] the ranch girl brother Brown said she's
[1:40:00] a perfect type of the Bride
[1:40:02] the fact is the sermon that he takes is
[1:40:04] the sudden secret going away the church
[1:40:05] and he's talking about the Rapture and
[1:40:07] he says this this Ranch girl is a type
[1:40:11] of the Rapture bride
[1:40:13] right so if you want to know we were
[1:40:15] saying earlier we don't know exactly
[1:40:16] what it'll look like here's some really
[1:40:17] good Clues
[1:40:18] all right you're going to hear a story
[1:40:20] and and the Holy Spirit is going to draw
[1:40:23] the inference and draw the meaning out
[1:40:26] to you I'll tell you I'll share with you
[1:40:28] what it drew to me you let it draw to
[1:40:30] you
[1:40:33] so the story is of course the you know
[1:40:36] the great Ranch there and and the great
[1:40:39] Rancher with all of his money and he's
[1:40:41] got a son
[1:40:42] and the son is looking for a wife but
[1:40:45] it's a secret he's going to come to the
[1:40:47] ranch and they're the sun's coming so
[1:40:49] all the girls in everywhere for miles
[1:40:51] are going to Vamp him and and they're
[1:40:53] gonna they're gonna doll up and pretty
[1:40:55] up and you know like like they're gonna
[1:40:56] have a Hollywood red carpet
[1:40:59] but they didn't know he was sick of
[1:41:01] those kind of girls they didn't know
[1:41:03] that a Son of God don't want that kind
[1:41:05] of girl they didn't re that they
[1:41:07] didn't realize that a real Son of God
[1:41:09] wants character he don't want her half
[1:41:12] dressed out in public he don't want her
[1:41:14] mingling around with the world
[1:41:16] there's no chance for you sister if you
[1:41:19] want to have a son of God and you better
[1:41:20] want a Son of God he's the only one
[1:41:21] who'll take care of you he's the only
[1:41:23] one who'll be honest and true and work
[1:41:25] to support you and help you in your life
[1:41:26] and be a companion to you see don't
[1:41:29] don't try to Allure a Son of God with
[1:41:31] beauty he's he avoids that stuff
[1:41:34] he's looking for character
[1:41:38] so he comes on a secret mission all
[1:41:40] right
[1:41:43] Story begins
[1:41:47] so he looked around they had a big party
[1:41:49] you know big shindig
[1:41:51] that's a southern term y'all know what
[1:41:52] that is
[1:41:54] so he looked around after a while he was
[1:41:58] so discouraged
[1:42:00] all he's seen was a bunch of Hollywood
[1:42:01] movie stars
[1:42:04] he wasn't looking for that he's looking
[1:42:05] for a wife he was tired of the world
[1:42:10] he was so discouraged he walked out the
[1:42:12] door
[1:42:14] as he looked around after a while he's
[1:42:16] out in the darkness he was so
[1:42:18] discouraged he walked out the door and
[1:42:19] going back Walking In The Moonlight
[1:42:22] towards the bunk house he heard somebody
[1:42:24] kind of humming
[1:42:26] and looked around
[1:42:28] and here went this little girl with a
[1:42:30] great big pan of dishwater way in the
[1:42:32] night barefooted to throw the dishwater
[1:42:34] out and as soon as he saw her something
[1:42:36] another said that's her
[1:42:38] that's the one
[1:42:40] see this was an orphaned cousin who her
[1:42:43] parents had died and so the uncle took
[1:42:46] her in and it's perfectly Cinderella all
[1:42:49] this evil stepsisters treat her terrible
[1:42:51] but this is a true story it's a true
[1:42:53] story and and uh uh uh of the armor uh
[1:42:57] meat packing uh the the ownership in his
[1:43:00] son and literally it became a true story
[1:43:02] I think God ordained it so we could read
[1:43:04] it today and have a prophet say this is
[1:43:06] a type of a raptured bride
[1:43:09] so they the the the cousin she's a
[1:43:11] little cousin she's got the same last
[1:43:12] name but they're they're making her do
[1:43:14] all the work see watch
[1:43:17] he saw her something said that's her
[1:43:18] that's the one
[1:43:23] so he I like that he put himself in the
[1:43:25] way
[1:43:28] he ain't getting past me I've been
[1:43:30] looking for you my whole life
[1:43:34] oh my goodness I cornered sister Debbie
[1:43:36] she had nowhere to turn
[1:43:44] so he put himself in the way and when
[1:43:46] she that's when she come back along the
[1:43:48] Corral Fence why he was standing there
[1:43:50] she almost fainted
[1:43:52] remember that honey
[1:43:56] foreign
[1:44:03] he said
[1:44:05] how do you do
[1:44:08] what's your name
[1:44:10] and she told him her name and it was the
[1:44:12] same name as the boss of the ranch said
[1:44:14] I can't understand how is that this is
[1:44:17] that your father said no I'm just a
[1:44:19] cousin you see my father and he were
[1:44:22] brothers I I got that same name but
[1:44:25] that's the boss
[1:44:28] make sure I stay up with
[1:44:31] me watch What analogy here's here's an
[1:44:33] analogy brother Brandon makes
[1:44:35] you might have the name of a church
[1:44:36] might have the name of Branham
[1:44:38] Tabernacle you might have the name
[1:44:40] Bethel Tabernacle Methodist or whatever
[1:44:43] Church you go that isn't it friends see
[1:44:45] it's something different it's your
[1:44:48] character that's what God is looking at
[1:44:56] the Branham I didn't put it up on
[1:44:58] purpose because it was just too much I
[1:44:59] was trying to weed down them already in
[1:45:01] overtime
[1:45:03] brother Brian I'm in the prisoner in
[1:45:05] 1963 he just makes these points I just
[1:45:07] want to make
[1:45:08] he says God he's referring to Paul who
[1:45:10] said I'm a prisoner and brother Branham
[1:45:13] says God make us prisoners like that
[1:45:16] how do you say how do I how can I be a
[1:45:18] prisoner like Paul God make us prisoners
[1:45:20] from our own selfish ambition
[1:45:26] there's never been an age
[1:45:29] with more opportunity for ambition
[1:45:35] he says if you're a prisoner to the word
[1:45:38] no denomination can sway you from it
[1:45:41] it's the word you're a prisoner to it
[1:45:43] that's all you must act the way it acts
[1:45:48] Paul was a prisoner says was he a
[1:45:50] prisoner is a prisoner to Jesus Christ
[1:45:52] harness to his word by the spirit he was
[1:45:54] bound
[1:45:55] he was bound by a chain that's that's a
[1:45:57] prisoner but but here it is
[1:46:00] by Fetters of love
[1:46:02] the chain is fatters of love
[1:46:05] that's the beauty of it
[1:46:07] I am a prisoner to My Darling by Setters
[1:46:11] of love
[1:46:12] it's nothing to do with with a law or a
[1:46:16] piece of paper or a vow I made it's
[1:46:18] Fetters of love
[1:46:20] I can't not love I I'm I'm a prisoner to
[1:46:23] it the longer it goes like a snowball
[1:46:25] rolling finally it got so big going down
[1:46:28] the hill I couldn't stop and I married
[1:46:29] her
[1:46:32] see it's Fetters of love
[1:46:36] he was bound
[1:46:38] to do the will of God and only that he
[1:46:40] was a prisoner oh tonight
[1:46:43] if if we and I'm gonna say it like this
[1:46:46] as brown as Bethel Tabernacle
[1:46:49] could only become prisoners to our own
[1:46:51] selfish being do I have enough honest
[1:46:55] people in here that Christ could see a
[1:46:57] show of hands and say if all tonight
[1:46:59] today if I could only become a prisoner
[1:47:01] to my own selfish being to our own
[1:47:04] ambition that we could completely say
[1:47:07] how far how much do I got to surrender
[1:47:08] till you could completely surrender
[1:47:10] ourselves and be yoke to him no matter
[1:47:13] what the rest of the world thinks what
[1:47:16] the rest of the world does we're Yokes
[1:47:18] with headers of love as prisoners
[1:47:22] say Amen to that
[1:47:26] you see friends
[1:47:28] God has planted a seed in you and
[1:47:30] you know God planted a city he even
[1:47:32] called The Gospel a seed and the you
[1:47:35] know I I want to say this to you that
[1:47:36] when the flower blooms it's so much more
[1:47:38] than the seed when it was planted
[1:47:41] you don't realize what beauty is within
[1:47:43] you don't realize what you have the
[1:47:45] ability to ascend to under this under
[1:47:47] this dynamics that are the Holy Ghost
[1:47:50] falling on the church
[1:47:51] you have the ability to be more than
[1:47:53] you've ever dreamed possible
[1:47:56] what fulfillment
[1:47:58] do you imagine does the does the word
[1:48:01] seed for this day when it's planted into
[1:48:03] your bosom
[1:48:05] what what do you imagine it could be
[1:48:09] when we read the scripture in Isaiah
[1:48:11] that the people of the last day who know
[1:48:13] their God will do great exploits what do
[1:48:15] you imagine that'll be
[1:48:19] think about all that the
[1:48:21] my The Messengers displayed I mean just
[1:48:24] a just a a we just start brother badam
[1:48:26] often starts right at Luther because
[1:48:28] that was look at what it accomplished my
[1:48:30] goodness you're talking about a Luther
[1:48:32] blew a hole and he breached a wall that
[1:48:35] had the entire world surrounded and
[1:48:38] steeped in darkness and Catholicism and
[1:48:40] Luther blew a hole right through it put
[1:48:42] C4 on it amen put Christ 4 on it and
[1:48:45] blow it up
[1:48:46] amen amen Fourth Man in the fire
[1:48:49] amen thank you Lord fix that quick
[1:48:54] amen my Wesley he starts off an age of
[1:48:57] missionary work literally shattered all
[1:48:59] the Norms of all that ever been done
[1:49:00] before or since in missionary work
[1:49:03] the Azusa Revival of power coming among
[1:49:06] you know and expressing through through
[1:49:10] the poorest and the most illiterate uh
[1:49:13] type of people but it brought faith in
[1:49:15] their lives and and and they and they
[1:49:17] they met in squalor they didn't meet in
[1:49:19] nice churches like this they met beside
[1:49:21] a railroad tracks and brush armor
[1:49:23] meetings
[1:49:24] and they were beaten and jailed right
[1:49:26] here in the United States
[1:49:27] amen and they became the outcast of the
[1:49:30] church yet it swept the world you
[1:49:32] couldn't stop it
[1:49:34] so what do you think this word is going
[1:49:36] to do in the hour I tell you it's going
[1:49:38] to push East it's going to push West
[1:49:40] it's going to push north and south and
[1:49:42] it's going to take a global Pride off
[1:49:44] the Earth
[1:49:45] Hallelujah a people called out of a
[1:49:49] church to become the bride
[1:49:52] his little house servant was chosen by
[1:49:54] the son to be his bride among all those
[1:49:56] High Society sisters
[1:49:58] where'd she get her wedding garments
[1:50:01] brother Branham says that she
[1:50:03] saved her money all year she only made a
[1:50:05] dollar and 75 cent a week now I'm
[1:50:06] probably in today's dollars that's I
[1:50:08] guess a low week's pay
[1:50:11] but she saved her money all years all
[1:50:13] year you know I thought about when he
[1:50:14] said that I thought about the coins that
[1:50:16] that woman the coin she lost out of her
[1:50:18] crown there and Jesus tells the story
[1:50:19] and she swept and searched carefully all
[1:50:22] over her house she wouldn't stop
[1:50:24] searching till she found it because it
[1:50:26] represented her virtue and she couldn't
[1:50:29] be seen without that coin it was a
[1:50:30] drachma it's like a a whole day's in
[1:50:33] worth it was only a day's wage but to
[1:50:35] her it was everything
[1:50:37] and she carefully Jesus said carefully
[1:50:39] she went through she had to find that
[1:50:42] lost coin the world didn't think of it
[1:50:44] as very valuable but to her it was
[1:50:46] valuable do you know what the you know
[1:50:47] what the parable I mean the the parable
[1:50:50] before was the lost sheep and Jesus
[1:50:53] leaving the 90 and nine and going after
[1:50:55] one don't think you're not valuable
[1:50:58] Hallelujah he's got 99 but he wants you
[1:51:01] Hallelujah the very following Parable is
[1:51:04] The Prodigal Son
[1:51:06] you gotta lost sheep you got a coin of
[1:51:08] value you got a lost sign here I think I
[1:51:10] could convince you today that God is
[1:51:12] determined to have you he loves you you
[1:51:15] Hallelujah he's got a plan for you
[1:51:19] oh my
[1:51:21] other than saving your money I don't
[1:51:23] know where a little cousin came up with
[1:51:24] at all I know where I got mine I got it
[1:51:28] at the foot of Calvary one day how did I
[1:51:30] get mine for this day in this hour this
[1:51:32] wicked day this impossible day I heard I
[1:51:35] recognized and I acted upon the word of
[1:51:37] God
[1:51:38] oh my making his word what did you do
[1:51:42] brother Jason I made his word
[1:51:44] the most valuable thing in my life
[1:51:48] what more manifestation lays in the seed
[1:51:50] yet friends
[1:51:55] what do you think lays just ahead of us
[1:51:58] what other manifestation is in the seed
[1:52:01] that's yet to come out and say I don't
[1:52:03] know
[1:52:04] but I do know there is more to come out
[1:52:06] how because I'm still here
[1:52:09] because you're still here
[1:52:12] see
[1:52:13] so he goes on

[1:52:19] so he says
[1:52:22] we read that yeah

[1:52:35] wait at the gate how many

[1:56:26] to get this boy there's a little cousin
[1:56:29] there on the ranch and she was an orphan
[1:56:32] and so she just done all the the work
[1:56:34] for these because they had to have the
[1:56:36] fingernails fixed you know and they
[1:56:38] couldn't wash the dishes for the hands
[1:56:40] and things that she'd done all the real
[1:56:42] hard work and then
[1:56:45] finally when the boy came they went out
[1:56:49] and got into the old western style the
[1:56:50] buck board they come in shooting their
[1:56:52] guns and carrying on and on and acting
[1:56:55] up and that night they had a great big
[1:56:57] dance out there on a on an old-fashioned
[1:56:59] dance and all the ranchers around about
[1:57:01] and coming in with her dancing and so
[1:57:05] forth and first thing you know why this
[1:57:08] went off it was Jubilee for two or three
[1:57:11] days then
[1:57:13] one night this boy stepped out to other
[1:57:18] place just to rest a while from the
[1:57:20] dance and got away from these girls and
[1:57:22] yeah look going down towards the crowd
[1:57:25] then I want a little girl kind of ragged
[1:57:27] looking and
[1:57:28] shed a dish pan full of water
[1:57:31] she washed the dishes and
[1:57:33] you thought I never seen her before
[1:57:36] I wonder where she come from so he just
[1:57:41] puts in his way to go around the side of
[1:57:43] the the bunk house go down there come
[1:57:45] back side of the crowd and met her she's
[1:57:49] barefooted she stopped
[1:57:51] she held her head down she'd seen who it
[1:57:53] was and she was very
[1:57:55] shine she knew this great person
[1:57:59] and she was just a cousin to these other
[1:58:01] girls her father was forming on this big
[1:58:05] armor outfit so they kept a she kept
[1:58:10] looking down she's ashamed of being

[1:58:15] told him said why ain't you out there to
[1:58:18] the where the rest of them is
[1:58:20] she kind of made excuses
[1:58:22] and so the next night he watched far
[1:58:25] again
[1:58:27] finally is sitting out there they all
[1:58:29] got to carrying on everything he he said
[1:58:31] on the crowd fence and watched her come
[1:58:33] through the dishwater out
[1:58:35] and he watched her and he said to her he
[1:58:39] said you know my real purpose
[1:58:42] of being here she said no sir I don't
