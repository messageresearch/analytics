[Applause] [Music] Hello everybody. So, you can all be seated. Um, except for anyone who's in the skit. They need to go back and get in their spot right away. That includes you, Caleb Buckman. I'm so nervous. I'm so glad that the lights are so bright because I can't see any of you. It's just like a black void. So, I feel like I'm just talking to myself, which is great. I do that a lot already. Who all was here last year? [Applause] &gt;&gt; I had a whole joke planned. I thought you guys were going to raise hands and I was going to say, "See, I can't see you." But you you shouted and ruined my joke. Um, okay. So, I just want to make a couple little quick announcements. I wrote a monologue this year. I've never done that and I'm super nervous. My paper's shaking. I told Brother Wes our deal. I'm a backstage nerd. I'm not a front stage nerd, but I'm gonna make it through this as best I can. Um, first of all, I usually put, as you know, um, little sermon clips in the beginning and end of our skits because usually it's a sermon that uh, inspires the skit. And this year I did that, of course. But the sermons are from um, Brother Brandham sermons. and I don't have video recording of that. So, um it's parts of it are just going to be blank screens and landscapes and just do your best to stay focused. We live in such a world of distraction. I know it's hard probably to keep your attention for very long, but um just know that this is very close to my heart. I know that it's at this point probably a big fat steak with no sides because I had to cut out all anything that made the videos longer. I had to trim down for the sake of time. Um, and it the videos are still a little long. That's why we cut all of most of our specials out is to make time for those. Um, so just do your best. Please humor me. I know it's not as visually stimulating as it is in other years, but these sermons are so important. And because I had to trim them down for time, I urge you to go listen to them for yourself. do not just watch this and be happy with that because every single line that wasn't extremely relevant to our skit that I had to remove, I it killed me because it was so good. Everything that he says in these sermons is so critical and so good. So, please go listen to yourself. I urge you. Um, I think that was pretty much all I needed to say for that. Um, Satan has really attacked this skit because he did not want this to happen. And he has plagued my mind with thoughts of negativity about how none of you are going to like it and it's going to be so boring and so lame and nobody's going to want to come back to camp next year because of my skit and that I'm not cool enough to be up here. That was probably my kids and husband and friends that told me that. you guys. Um, but anyways, let me get to this monologue before I fall off this box. I got to stop smiling. If I cry, please just bear with me. Anyone who grew up in a devoutly Christian home can relate to what I'm about to say. Because we were raised knowing the truth about our future, many of us developed a fear surrounding death and even that widely discussed event, the rapture. How many of you woke up one morning to a suspiciously quiet house? And your first thought was, "I've been left behind." You don't know what to do first. Find your mom or take inventory of the canned goods. Locating your siblings doesn't help because you know if you didn't make it, they definitely didn't. [Applause] On a more serious note, I remember lying awake at night while being plagued with thoughts of fear concerning my eternal fate. I wish those fe I could say that those feelings ended after I got saved. But the mind is a funny thing. Sometimes we develop something like a muscle memory when it comes to certain insecurities. Our mind loves to return to its old haunts. And if you don't expose your fears to the Lord and ask for help, they will continue to torment you. I could have written a skit about the horror of life after death for the unbeliever. But we are all well acquainted with that part of reality. You probably all heard it your whole lives. Today I want to focus on the element of the story that relates to the believers. Those of us who are saved and may be still fighting feelings of needless fear. This leads me to the theme of today's skit. There are certain aspects of each one of you that are lying dormant within you. God is guiding your lives and allows different things to happen specifically because there is a side to me and you that will never come to fruition without going through the things that we go through. And in these last days, God's mission in our lives is to get us ready to meet him. You are about to see a few examples of people who were in the middle of a great trial when God stepped in and showed them a vision of what was in store for them and for each one of us believers. If you are struggling with feelings of doubt or unbelief unbelief and Satan has tried to tell you like he has all of us that God isn't real and that none of this is real. This is the sign you have been looking for. God is real. He loves you. And the same resurrection power that raised Jesus is here in this room. And one day it will raise us up to meet him. &gt;&gt; The name of this kit is called Visions of Heaven. And I hope you all enjoy it. [Applause] [Music] The 1937 flood has left a lasting imprint on Claremont County. The Ohio River stormed out of its banks for 10 days in January, claiming lives, property, entire communities. &gt;&gt; We saw it coming up and they kept telling about it, you know, how it kept raining and everything and my husband said, "We better be getting out." &gt;&gt; That was our Katrina. Well, it just looked like a few sheds sticking out under the water. &gt;&gt; Devastating. Devastating loss of homes, loss of personal property. &gt;&gt; People basically were scrambling to just to survive. &gt;&gt; River stage at 10:00 tonight, 76.8 ft. That is approximately 25 ft above flood stage. Fires which threatened the entire western section of Cincinnati this morning are reported under control at this hour. Bloodboats great yaws which have been rushed from the Atlantic seabboard in the Great Lakes are now resting in the flood waters more to the tops of lampost and telegraph. &gt;&gt; New Richmond was among the communities in the pathway of the floodwaters that raged along an almost 1,000mi path from Pittsburgh to Cairo, Illinois. the come up of flood in 1937. I was on patrol at that time and I was trying my best to bring the people out of the flood houses tearing down and my own wife took sick and she was real real sick with pneumonia. The regular hospital so full we couldn't put her in there. So we take her out to the the government where they had a room out there. And so then they called me back out and I always lived on the river and quite a boatman. So I was trying to get the people rescue him from the flood. They called me said there's a house over on Chester Streets about ready to go in. There's a mother and a bunch of children in there and I shooting those waves of dy broke up there and oh my the just washing the city out. The water pouring through and I heard someone screaming. I seen a mother stand out on the porch. There's them big rollers going through like that. Well, I went on up this way as far as I could and hit the stream and come back and got on that side. I got my boat stopped just in time to tie it around the post of the door and I run in and grabbed the mother and got her in there. Two or three of the children got her over to the shore about a mile and a half across the city. I got her to the shore and then when I got over there she fainted and she began just screaming, "My baby, my baby." Well, I thought that she meant she left the baby in the house. Oh my. I tucked back again while they was trying to take care of her. Come to find out it was she was won't know where a baby was there. There was a little fellow about 3 years old and I thought she meant a little nursing baby or something. And so I tucked back and got over there and when I got that boat and got on the inside and couldn't find old baby and a porch giveaway and the house went in and I run real quick and grabbed the piece there was floating my boat got into the boat and pulled that and loosened up. They done got me out into the curd of the main river. And it was about 11:30 at night and it's sleeping and snowing. And I grabbed a hold of the starter string and I tried to pull the boat and it wouldn't start. And I tried and it wouldn't start. And I tried again getting farther in that curtain. The falls just below me. I thought, "Oh my, here here's my end. This is it." And I'd try real hard and I said, "Lord, please don't let me die death like this." I'd pull and I'd pull. They come back to me. What about that bunch of trash that you wouldn't go to? I put my hand back on the board. I said, "God be merciful to me. Don't let me leave my wife and baby like this. I'm out there sick, please." And I just kept pulling like that and it wouldn't start. And I could feel the roaring down there. It was like just a few minutes and oh my, that' be it. And I said, "Lord, if you'll forgive me, I promise you I'll do anything that you want me to do." And I pulled again and started. And I turned all the gas on it I could and finally got into the shore and I went back to find the truck. Some of them said, "Say the government just washed away. My wife and baby in there, both babies." And I tuck out for the government as hard as it could and water was standing about 15 ft deep all through it. And there was a major there. And I said, "Major, what happened to the hospital?" Said, "Now don't be weary. Do you have anyone in there?" I said, "Yes, a sick wife and two babies." He said, "They all got out." Said, "They're in a freight car and they've headed towards Charleston. I run got my car, my boat in the back of it and then the creeks had come down about two and a half or three miles wide. Some of them said the freight car washed off the tracks out there on the trestle. Well, find myself marooned out on a little island sat there three days just beaten where's my wife and a few days after I got out and got across. She was way up to Columbus, Indiana in the Baptist auditorium where they'd made a a hospital-like sick rooms or little government cotss and I ran to her as hard as I could trying to find where she was screaming, "Hope, hope, hope." And I looked and there she was laying on a cot and TV had sitting. She raised her little bony hand and she said, "Billy." I run to her and I said, "I hope honey." She said, "I look awful, don't I?" I said, "No, honey. You look all right." For about six months, we worked with everything that was in us to try to get to save her life. But she kept getting lower and lower. One day I was on patrol and I had my radio turned on and I heard him say for William Brandham wanted the hospital at once, wife dying. I rushed back to the hospital as quick as I could. Turned on the red light and the sirene and took off. I walked into the room and the nurse was sitting there and she was crying cuz she and Hope was schoolmates together. I looked over and shook her. There she was. She had went down from about 120 lbs to about 60. And if I live uh to be a 100 years old, I'll never forget what happened. She turned over and those great big pretty eyes looked up at me. She smiled. She said, "Why did you call me back, Billy? I said, "What do you mean call you back?" She said, "Bill, you've preached about it. You've talked about it, but you don't have no idea what it is." I said, "What are you talking about?" She said, "Heaven." She said, "I was being escorted home by some people's man or women or something that was dressed in white." And she said, "I was at ease and peace." She said, "Big pretty birds flying from tree to tree." She said, "Don't think I'm beside myself." She didn't know that what was fixing to happen in a few hours then. And I held her darling hands while the angels of God packed her away. I went home. I didn't know what to do. I laid down there at night and a little bit someone called me said, "Billy, your baby's dying." I said, "My baby said, yes." Sharon Rose said, "Doc's up there now." And said, "She's got tubercular menagitis. She nursed it from her mother. I got in the car and went up there and there she was, a sweet little thing. And they rushed her to the hospital. I went out to see him. Sam come up and said, "Billy, don't you go in that room. You got to think of Billy Paul." Said, "She's dying." I said, "Doc, I I got to see my baby." He said, "No, you can't go in." Said, "She's got menitis." Billy, you'd pack it to Billy Paul. I waited till he got out. I couldn't stand to see her down her mother laying down there in the undertaker's establishment. I tell you, the way of a transgressor is hard. And I I went slipped in the door and when Sam went out, the nurse went out, I went out into the basement. She's in an isolated place and the flies was in her little eyes. They had a little what we call a mosquito bar, a little netting over her eyes. And she was a little spasm. Her little fat leg was moving up and down like that. And her little hands with that spasm. And I looked at her and she's just big enough to be cute. about eight months old and her mother used to set her out there with her little three corners on, you know, in the yard when I come up and I'd toot the horn and she'd go goo reaching for me, you know. There laid my darling dying. I looked down to her and I said, "Sherry, you know daddy, you know daddy Sherry." And when she looked, she was suffering so hard that one of them pretty little blue eyes had crossed. It like tore my heart out of me. I knelt down. I said, "Lord, what have I done? Haven't I preached the gospel on the street corners? I've done everything that I know to do. Don't hold it against me." I never call them people trash. It was her that calling people trash. I said, "I'm sorry it all happened. Forgive me. Don't Don't take my baby." And while I was praying, look like a black like a sheet or cloth come down. I know he had to refuse me. Now, there was the hardest and the most treacherous time of my life. When I raised up and looked at her, Satan put in my mind, "Will you mean as hard as you've preached in the way that you've lived? And now, when it comes to your own baby, he'll turn you down." I said, "That's right. If you can't save my baby, then I can't stop." I just didn't know what to do. And then I said, "Lord, you gave her to me and you taken her away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If you take even me, I'll still love you." And I put my hand over on her. I said, "Bless you, sweetheart." Daddy wanted to raise you with all my heart. I wanted to raise you and raise you to love the Lord. But the angels are coming for you, sweetheart. Daddy will take your little body down and lay it on the arms of mama. I'll bury you with her someday. Daddy will meet you. I stood there to hear Brother Smith, the Methodist preacher that preaches the funeral, ashes to ashes and dust to dust. And I thought, heart to heart, there she went. Not long after that, I took little Billy there one morning. He's this little bitty fell and he was crying for his mama and I didn't have any mama to take him to and he said, "Daddy, where's my mama? Did you put her into that ground?" I said, "No, honey. She's ours. She's up in heaven." He said something there like to kill me. One afternoon, he was crying. I had long late in the evening. He said, "Daddy, please go get mama and bring her here." And I said, "Honey, I can't get mama." Said, "Well, tell Jesus to send me my mama. I want her. I said, "Well, honey, I me and you going to go see her sometime." And he stopped said, "Daddy." And I said, "Yeah." Said, "I see mama up there on that cloud." Like to kill me. I just almost fainted. I hugged the little fell up to my bosom like just held my head down. Days passed. I couldn't forget it. I tried to work. Couldn't go back home. It wasn't home no more. I wanted to stay. And I remember one day I was trying to work and public service. I went up to fix a an old secretary was hanging down. It was real early of a morning and I climbed up this cross and I couldn't give that baby up. I could see my wife going but that baby going just a little bitty thing and the primaries run down to the transformer and went out in, you know, secondary. And I was hanging up there on a and I happened to look the sun coming up behind me and there my hands stretched out and the sign of that cross on the on the hillside. I thought yes it was my sins that put him there. I said Sharon honey daddy wants to see you so bad honey. I would like to hold you in my arms again you darling little thing. I got beside myself. It been weeks I pulled off my rubber glove. There's 2,300 volts running right to the side of me. I said, "God, I hate to do this. I'm a coward, but Sherry, daddy's going to see you and mommy just in a few minutes." Started pulling on my glove to put my hand on that 2300 and something happened. When I come to you, I was sitting on the ground with my hands up like this to my face crying. It was God's grace. I wouldn't been having a healing service. Sure, I'm sure of that. I started home. I quit. Put my tools away and went back. I said, "I'm going home." I took the mail and I looked in the mail and the first thing on there was her little Christmas saving 80 cents. Miss Sharon Rose Brandom. There it was all over again. I reached in there and got my gun pistol out from the holster. I said, "Lord, I I can't go this anymore. I'm I'm dying. I'm I'm so tormented." I pulled the hammer back on the gun, put it up to my head, and kneeling there on that cot in that dark room. I said, "Our Father, art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thine will be done as I try." I squeeze that trigger as hard as I could. I said, "On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread." And it wouldn't go off. I thought, "Oh, God, are you just tearing me to pieces? What have I done? You won't even let me die." And I throw the gun down and went off and shot in the room. Since the fall of Adam, all of humanity has been trapped in sin. We were cut off from God and born unto death without knowledge of what lay beyond the grave. But God in his mercy had a plan for redemption. I have dedicated my life to the studying of scriptures. And as a premier student of law and prophets, I have achieved the prestigious title Pharisee of Pharisees. And in my searching, I have noticed a few remarkable accounts of when people saw a p saw a vision of heaven. Not a mystical void, but a real place with real people. Let us now reflect on one of the earliest accounts of when someone saw past the veil into glories beyond. [Applause] The best and greatest patrol. [Music] rich man's knees blessings today. &gt;&gt; Father, did you see our nose? &gt;&gt; Hey, so strong just like you, son. &gt;&gt; A let us ask God's blessing on this one. God of heaven, we thank you for the blessings you've given us and the hedge of protection surrounding us. I thank you for my 7,000 sheep, my 3,000 camels, and my 500 yolk of oxen. Also for my 500 female donkeys. Lord, I thank you for my seven sons, my three daughters, and for my pleasant, gracious wife. And Lord, let me not forget to thank you for the support and loyalty of my dear friends. But most of all, Lord, I thank you for the opportunity to serve you continually. Amen. [Music] [Applause] One day the sons of God came to give. One day the sons of God came to give their accounts before the Lord and Satan the accuser came also. &gt;&gt; Where have you been, oh evil one? And what have you been doing? &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, I've been around here and there seeking to devour. &gt;&gt; Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him. He is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. &gt;&gt; Job? Of course, I've noticed Job. And we all know the only reason he serves you so fervently is because you bless everything he touches. And not to mention that hedge of protection you have around him. Even his animals are protected. I guarantee you that if you stretch out your hand against him and take his stuff away, he will curse you to your face. &gt;&gt; Very well then. Everything he has is in your power. But on Job himself, do not lay a finger. [Applause] Master, docks were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby and the savians attacked us. They took the donkeys and killed the other servants with swords. I won't escape to tell you. Sabians, I can't believe this. &gt;&gt; Master, the sheets were grazing. The sheets were in the sheets were the sheep. A raging fire fell from the sky and burnt up all the sheep and devoured the other shepherds. I alone escaped to tell you. &gt;&gt; Not the sheep, &gt;&gt; master. Master, the Chaldians have attacked us and they raided the camels and they took them. Now the other servants, they killed them. I won't escape to tell you. How is this possible? What sort of madness is this, &gt;&gt; master? &gt;&gt; Oh, what now? My mother-in-law isn't coming, is she? Master, I bring you terrible news. Your sons and your daughters were having a feast in your oldest son's house when suddenly a strong wind came from the desert and struck the four corners of the house and fell on the young people and they all died. I alone have escaped to tell you. &gt;&gt; Then Job arose. He tore his clothes, shaved his head, fell to the ground, and worshiped. He said, &gt;&gt; "I came into this world with nothing, and that is how I will leave it. The Lord has given. The Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; In all of this, Job didn't sin or blame God. [Applause] Again the sons of God came to give their accounts before the Lord. And again Satan came also. &gt;&gt; Satan, where have you been? Have you considered my friend Job? There is no one on earth like him. He is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. and he still maintains his integrity even though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason. &gt;&gt; Skin for skin, humans will do anything to save their own lives. It's obvious he's only serving you out of fear. But what do you think would happen if you reached down and took away his health? That would make anyone curse you. &gt;&gt; Very well then. He is in your hands, but you must spare his life. So, Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful soores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. Then, Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat on a trash heap among the ashes. Can you tell me your name? &gt;&gt; I am Ilifas Damite, a man of great wisdom and even greater self-confidence. I've always been known for my eloquent speeches and my ability to connect dots. I once predicted a drought months in advance, just by the way a particular donkey was looking at me. An impressive feat if I do say so myself. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I can do it myself. &gt;&gt; I am Bill the Shuite, a man of tradition and a staunch defender of the old way. I believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason is usually something your greatgrandfather did. My favorite pastime is reminding people of their ancestors potential misdeeds. It is a very humbling hobby. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Get out of here, kid. Let your elder speak. My name is Zofa. Oh, put it in. Put it in. Yeah, that that that. Thank you. I am Sofa the Neoth and I dare say the most direct of the bunch. I don't mince my words and if I think you're wrong, I tell you you're wrong. And I'll probably do it in a very very loud way. I once got into a heated debate with a donkey about the best way to carry a sack of grain. I the donkey blinked at me which I took as a sign of defeat. And can you tell me about the last seven days of silence? &gt;&gt; It was a time of profound, meaningful silence. I was busy in my mind. I was going to use a metaphor about a storm and a tree. But I couldn't decide if the tree should be an oak or a sycamore. The whole seven days passed just thinking about it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't silence. It was a test of willpower. A divine staring contest, if you will. We were waiting for Job to crack, to confess, and admit his sins. But he just sat there covered in boils with a look on his face that said, "Are you guys serious?" The silence was so thick you could have kneedeed it into a loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; It was torture. I had a hundred things to say, but I fell kept giving me these evil glares. I think he has a side job as a professional eye glare therapist. So I just sat there, my mind racing, thinking of all the ways I could subtly hint that he was a sinner. I even tied a game of charades, but no one played at all. &gt;&gt; They call it silence. I was busy trying to find a decent bandage for his boils and they're sitting there in a circle looking at each other. I thought they were playing some kind of bizarre card game. I went out and milked the one goat we had left and they were still sitting there seven days. I could have baked a dozen loaves of bread in that time. Now it's raining. &gt;&gt; And what did you do to cheer Joe up? &gt;&gt; I told him a story about the talking squirrel who found the treasure. &gt;&gt; It was a very uplifting and moral tale. He didn't seem to get the moral, though I think his boils were distracting. &gt;&gt; I brought him a handful of my finest barley. I said, "Job, look. It's a symbol of new beginnings of hope. He just looked at me. He said, "I am covered in boils bed. I can't even eat the nerve." I even read him some parables about sinners. &gt;&gt; Lo, I shall rain upon you a thousand curses and pestilent diseases for all of thy sins. There shall be many and of great multitude. &gt;&gt; They always cheered me up when I was down. I tried to do a little comedic routine for him. I put a leaf on my head and pretended to be a tree. &gt;&gt; What did the tree say to the st? &gt;&gt; I don't know. Trees don't talk. You laugh. I will leave you alone. &gt;&gt; I did some terrible tree. &gt;&gt; What happened to leaves in a you know &gt;&gt; they fall? &gt;&gt; Nothing. Not even a chuckle. I even did a dramatic fall at the end. Crickets. Literally crickets. &gt;&gt; Me and my young cousin Alu did a beautiful song and dance, but he just put more ashes on his head. [Music] He needs to just curse God and die. I told him so, but he never listens to me. These friends only want Joe for the feast. &gt;&gt; Here I am giving him my fine china to scrape his boils. &gt;&gt; I know you're not sleeping, Joe. &gt;&gt; Why do you think Job is suffering? He's a secret gambler. I'm telling you. I saw him looking at a pair of dice once. He probably made a bet with God that he couldn't lose everything and he lost big time. &gt;&gt; Ancestral karma. His great greatgrandfather was a notorious litterbug. He didn't even pick up his trash. Now, generations later, Job is suffering the consequence. The divine ecosystem is very straight. He's an uncomforted farmer. He probably planted his seeds at the wrong time. And now God is showing him the natural consequences of his actions. It is an agricultural lesson. A very, very, very harsh one. &gt;&gt; Job's friends don't know what they're talking about. I am his wife. I have to live with the boils, the loss, and now these three, they showed up and sat in silence. And now they're telling me my husband's either a gambler or a bad farmer. I don't care about any of that. All I want is for this to be over. My curse god and die comment was less of a command and more of a sincere request. I was tired of listening to their theories. I wanted a little bit of divine intervention to get us out of this situation. &gt;&gt; Gambling is a sin. The dice, the thrill, it's all a precursor to divine punishment. &gt;&gt; Move, move, get up. It's not the gambling. It's the littering. throwing trash everywhere. It breaks the divine order of things. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. You're both wrong. It is he was bad farmer. He's a bad farmer. He planted his crops in the wrong season. How can you do something like that and expect to get away with it? The most basic sin of all. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. It's not a farmer. He tell you he feels stressed in the wrong season. &gt;&gt; He didn't trash him. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Bill Dad. My gambling theory was a long shot. And I'm sorry, Zofar. My letter back theory was a little bit trashy. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. My family was unseated. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We the United Force of Comforters have come to a realization. While our individual theories were varied, the God truth remains. Job is a secret sinner. We've decided to put aside our differences and convince him to confess. We're going to show him a detailed handheld shot that shows him clearly between sin and suffering. We've even created a series of motivational posters with our faces on them. It is time for job to face the truth. And we are just the guys to make sure that he does. Cursed is the day I was born. Why didn't I just die at birth? My life is meaningless and nothing but misery. &gt;&gt; Job, my friend, no one suffers without cause. Pain is God's way of teaching. Maybe he's correcting you &gt;&gt; for what? I've searched my heart. I've lived righteously, but yet I'm still suffering. &gt;&gt; God doesn't punish the innocent. You say you're blameless, but the righteous don't suffer like this. Repent and he will restore you. &gt;&gt; Repent for what? I'm innocent. If only I could just plead my case before God. But there's no mediator between us and I feel eternally separated from him. &gt;&gt; Enough of your excuses, Job. God is just. If you are suffering, it is because you deserve it. &gt;&gt; And what if there is no justice? Restoration after repentance. My story will end with the grave. We all return to dust, rich or poor, good or evil. &gt;&gt; You speak of shadows and despair, but God knows your heart, Job. He's waiting for you to return to him. &gt;&gt; I long for that. I beg him to hear my cries, but it feels as if heaven is silent. I've lost everything. My soul is in anguish. What's the point of all this? &gt;&gt; Even now, God could heal you. But you must stop accusing him and confess your sin. And then hope he will forgive you. &gt;&gt; Hope? Hope feels out of reach. I fear that when I breathe my last breath, I will be forgotten like dust in the wind. &gt;&gt; You talk in circles. Just repent already. Man is of a few days, full of trouble. Life is like a shadow. It vanishes. Then what? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Now you speak in riddles. This is foolishness. &gt;&gt; Miserable comforters. All of you. You don't ease my pain. You only make it worse. Okay, I've heard enough. I have stayed quiet out of respect for my elders, but none of you is making any sense. Job, you're like, "I'm innocent, but God is against me." But that's not how it works. God is just trying to teach you a lesson and you're walling around in your self-pity. &gt;&gt; I want to believe that. I want to know that there's a purpose in all this, but I feel completely alone. &gt;&gt; He's here even now. Don't lose hope. You may not see him yet, but he sees you. &gt;&gt; Maybe he does see me. And I wonder if my friends, I've seen something in nature. When a tree is cut down, life may come from the root again if water reaches it. Could it be possible for new life to emerge from me who has been cut down? When a flower that dies in the winter can go in the ground and live again in the spring, I ask you, can a man live again? I see something. A vision. [Music] Fill this mind with the knowledge of your love. Hold me fast through the deep and steady current. How long? How long till these tears are gone? [Music] Every hour. Awake me to your presence. Shine your light brighter than the dawn. Send your joy. Illuminate the darkness. How long? How long till these tears are gone? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll fix my on eternity above. Where every light is uncovered by your love. [Music] I'll fix my eyes on eternity. Oh, every lie is uncovered by your love. Every shadow uncovered by your love. Every shadow covered by your love. I know that my shall stand at last on the earth. And after my body is destroyed, this I know that in my flesh I shall see God. [Applause] I said, "God, why can't I die and get out of it? I just can't go no father. You've got to do something to me." And I fell over and started crying on my little old dirty bunk there. And I must have went to sleep. I don't know whether it was asleep or what happened. And I thought I was going down along through the prairie as I went along. I noticed an old covered wagon like an old prairie schooner. And the wheel was broke. Of course, that represented my broken family. And as I got close, I looked there stood a a real pretty young girl about 20 years old, white flowing hair and blue eyes, dressed in white. I looked over at her. I said, "How do you do?" Went on. She said, "Hello, Dad. I turned back. I said, "Dad, why?" I said, "How miss can you can I be your daddy when you're as old as I am?" She said, "Daddy, you just don't know where you're at." And I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "This is heaven." Said, "On earth? I was your little Sharon?" "Well," I said, "Honey, you were just a little baby." Said, "Daddy, little babies are not little babies here. They're immortal. They never get old or never grow. And I said, "Oh, Sharon, honey, you you're a pretty young woman." She said, "Mama's waiting for you." I said, "Where?" She said, "Up at your new home." I said, "New home? Brandoms are vagabonds. They don't have homes. They just I said, 'Well, I never had a home, honey." She said, "But you got one up here, Daddy. And I turned and looked and there was great big palaces and the glory of God coming up around him and I heard angelic choir singing my home sweet home. I started up a long steps running just as hard as I could and when I got to the door there she stood a white garment on that black hair long holding down her back. She raised out her arms as she always did want to come home tired from work or something. I caught her with the hands of I said, "Honey, I seen Sharon down there." I said, "She made a pretty girl, didn't you?" She said, "Yes, Bill." She said, "Bill put her arms around me and she said, "Stop worrying about me and Sharon." I said, "Honey, I can't help it." She said, "Now, Sharon and I are better off than you are." And said, "Don't worry about us no more. Will you promise me?" I said, "I've been so lonesome for you and for Sharon and Billy cries all the time for you." She said, "It'll be all right, Bill." And she said, "Won't you sit down?" And I looked around and there's a great big chair. I remember I tried to buy a chair one time. We had them old old common wooden bottom chairs and we could buy one of these chairs that they let back in the back like a kind of easy rest chair and it cost $17. You could pay $3 down and a dollar a week. One day I got behind on my payments. We couldn't make it and it got day after day and finally one day they come and got my chair and tuck it. She told me up there she said, "You remember that chair, Bill?" I said, "Yes, honey, I remember." She says, "What you think about what Jeff?" Said, "Well, they won't take this one. This one's paid for." She said, "Sit down just a minute. I want to talk to you." And I said, "Honey, I don't understand this." And she said, "Promise me, Billy. Promise me that you won't worry anymore. You're going back now." And I said, "I can't do that." Oh. And just then, I come too. It was dark in the room. I looked around and I felt her arm around me. I said, "Oh, are you here in the room?" She started patting me. She said, "You going to make me that promise bill?" I said, "I promise you." And when she patted me two or three times and she was gone, I jumped up and turned on the light, looked everywhere. She was gone. But she's just gone out of the room. She isn't gone. She's still living. She was a Christian. Oh Lord. Many times, Lord, I'm sure people don't understand when they think these things come easy. But there's a great day coming when Jesus shall come and all these sorrows will be wiped away. I pray, heavenly father, that you'll help us to be prepared. And that last promise when I kissed her on the cheek that morning and I'd meet her there that day. I believe she'll be standing at that post screaming my name. One of these days, we're going to close this Bible for the last time. God, keep me faithful to the promise. Keep your grace around me, Lord. I may not look at the things of this life, but live for the things that's beyond someday when it's all over and we gather around under the evergreen trees. It'll be a great time, man. And those who are here, Lord, may not even know you. Maybe they've got some little love across the sea on earth. If they've never fulfilled their promise, may they do it now. [Music] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want [Music] in green pastures. He makes me lie down. He restores my soul and leads me on for his name, for his great name. [Music] Surely goodness, surely mercy right beside me all my days and I will dwell in your house forever. and bless your holy name. You prepare a table right before me in the presence of my eneies.

Oh, let's praise him. Tell him you love him this morning. Give him praise. Hallelujah. were blessed more than in his beginning. His flocks were returned. His wealth was restored, and 10 new children were born unto him. But the true miracle of Job's life was not in what was regained, but in what was revealed to him. For out of the ashes and agony came that crucial question, can a man live again? And through this, God revealed his plan of redemption. And now we know that when the suffering of this life is over, we will behold our redeemer. Once I too was in need of a redeemer. While I dedicated my entire life to studying the scripture, I acted ignorantly and in unbelief. I persecuted the very one I thought I was serving. This man speaks against Moses and against God. He says Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this temple. &gt;&gt; Yes, he dares our traditions are worthless. And he calls this criminal Jesus, the righteous one. Brothers, listen to me. From Abraham to Moses, from David to the prophets, God has always been with us. But time and again, our fathers turned away. They rejected his messengers. And now, just like them, you are stiff necked and resist the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Just as your fathers persecuted the prophets, so now you have betrayed and murdered the righteous one. &gt;&gt; Blasphemy. Do not listen to him. &gt;&gt; He deserves death. &gt;&gt; Stone him. &gt;&gt; Stone him. &gt;&gt; Stone him. Steven, you have been found guilty of blasphemy and shall be stoned to death. Do you have any final words? [Music] Behold, I see the heavens open, the son of man standing at the right hand of God. &gt;&gt; No. No. Kill him. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Stone him, &gt;&gt; traitor. Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Do not hold their sins against them. No. No. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was there. I held the cloak as Steven was stoned. I gave my approval and I was blind in my heart. But on the road to Damascus, I met him, Jesus, the one I persecuted. In his mercy, he opened my eyes. From that day, I was no longer Saul the destroyer, but Paul, a servant of Christ. I suffered for his name, beaten, stoned, imprisoned, and even shipwrecked. Yet in all of this, the Lord sustained me. Once I too was caught up in paradise, in the third heaven, what I saw there cannot be told in words. Glory beyond compare. Though this all may seem implausible, I am no different than so many others who have endured tribulation but were strengthened by the glory of the next life. Even Jesus himself, who suffered as no other man has suffered, endured the cross by fixing his eyes on the joys set before him. Let us hear the voices of the cloud of witnesses. Through the ages, their pain gave way to visions of heaven. [Music] I am Jacob, son of Isaac. I was running for my life on that cold night and had only a stone for my pillow. I dreamed a dream and I saw a ladder reaching to heaven with angels ascending and descending and the Lord above it. This vision sustained me in the wilderness. I am Elijah, a prophet of the Lord. Crushed by fear and despair, I hid in the darkest cave. But I saw the Lord pass by, not in the wind, nor the fire, nor the earthquake, but in a gentle whisper that restored my soul. &gt;&gt; I am Holda, a prophetist. When judgment loomed over Jerusalem and all seemed lost, the word of the Lord came to me and mercy was promised to our king. This word gave hope that God's people would not be forsaken. I am the prophet Isaiah. When my beloved King Uzziah died, my heart was crushed with grief. Yet in that dark year, I saw the Lord seated on his throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. [Applause] My name is Ezekiel the prophet. Far from ancestral home, I was captive by the river Chabbar. There I sat among the exiles. But then the heavens were opened. I saw wheels of fire, living creatures, and the glory of the Lord shining bright. That vision became an encouragement for generations to follow. [Applause] I am Daniel, a prophet of the one true God. In Babylon, surrounded by lions and pagan kings, I dreamed in the night, and I saw one like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven, his kingdom everlasting. I am Mary of Magdala. I have never felt grief so terrible as when they crucified my Lord. When the deepest sorrow flooded my very soul. I saw the risen Lord and he called me by my name. [Applause] I am Peter, a follower of the Lord Jesus. I was imprisoned for my faith, lying bound in the dark of night, awaiting my death. I was awakened by a light, an angel of the Lord. My chains fell and the gates opened before me. [Applause] I am the Apostle John and I was boiled alive for the sake of my Lord. Before they banished me to the aisle of Patmas for my faith, where I lived as a slave, alone in my chains, I was caught up in the spirit. And I saw a throne in heaven and one that sat upon it surrounded by angels crying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord. [Applause] My name is Polycarp. I was martyed for following God's truth. As a fire rose to consume me, I looked beyond the flames and I saw not death but life eternal with Christ my King. [Applause] I am a young mother named Perpeta. I was put to death for my faith. From my prison cell awaiting the arena, I dreamed of a golden ladder reaching into heaven. And I knew that soon I would climb it to see my Lord. [Applause] I am I am John Bunan, a preacher from a gold dark prison cell. I am John Bunan, a preacher from a gold dark prison cell where I had been in prison for my faith. I had a supernatural dream. I saw a pilgrim's journey crossing the river into the celestial city where the king welcomed him. I knew then that at my journey's end, I would also see my king [Applause] and I raised up on my pillow, put my head up on the the headboard of the bed, and put my hands behind I just wonder what it will be the other side. I am already 50 and I haven't done nothing yet. If I could only do something to help the Lord. I don't want you to miss this. It has changed me. I can't be the same brother of Brandon that I was. And I heard something kept saying, "You're just starting. Press the battle. Just keep pressing." I said, I just probably imagine that. And there it come again. Said, just keep pressing. If you only knew what was at the end of the road. And it seemed like I could hear Grim Snelling or somebody that sang that song. I'm home sick and blue. And I want to see Jesus. I would like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime. It would brighten my path and would banish all fears. Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. And I heard something say, "Would you like to see just beyond the curtain?" I said, "It would help me so much." And I looked in just a moment I one breath I'd come into a little place that slanted. I looked back and there I was laying on the bed and I said, "This is a strange thing." Whether it was I was in this body or out, whether it was a translation, it wasn't like any vision I ever had. And when I hit that little place, I've never seen so many people come running, screaming, "Oh, our precious brother." And I looked and young women maybe in their early 20s, 18 to 20. They were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother. Here come young man in the brilliance of young manhood. And their eyes glistening and looking like stars on a darkened night. their teeth as white as pearl. And they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming, "Oh, our precious brother." And I stopped and I looked and I was young. I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head. There was no yesterday, no tomorrow. It was something that I I have not got the the vocabulary. I haven't got the words to say. Perfection wouldn't touch it. Superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere. It was something that I never You just have to be there. And I looked this way and that way and they were coming by the thousands. And here come hope. She said, "My precious brother. Oh, would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again?" And I heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said, "This is what you preach was the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it. I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there." There was no jealousy. There was no tiredness. There was no death. Sickness could never end there. Mortality could never make you old. They could not cry. It was just one joy. Oh my precious brethren. And they took me up and set me up on a great big high place. And I said, "Oh, I shouldn't sit up here." And here come women and man from both sides just in their bloom of youth screaming. And one woman was standing there and she screamed, "Oh my precious brother. Oh, we are so happy. to see you here. I said, I don't understand this. And then that voice that was speaking from above me said, you know, it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people. And I said, yes, I remember that in the scriptures. Said, but this is when you were gathered with your people. I said, but I there's a millions. There's not that many Brandhams. And that voice said, "They're not randoms. Them's your converts." &gt;&gt; That's the ones that you've led to the Lord. And said, "Some of them women there, you think it's so beautiful. We're better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord. No wonder they're screaming our precious brother." And they screamed all at once that if you hadn't went, we wouldn't be here. I said, "Oh, where is Jesus? I want to see him so bad. They said, "Now he's just a little higher." Right up that way. Said, "Someday he will come to you." He said, "You were sent for a leader. And God will come and when he does, he'll judge you according to what you taught them first. Whether they go in or not, we'll go in according to your teaching." I said, "Oh, I'm so glad. If Paul does he have to stand like this? Does Peter have to stand like this? Yes. I said then I preached every word that they preached. I never did it from one side to the other. Were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ? I did too. Were they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost? I did too. Whatever they taught, I did too. And then people screamed and said, "We know that and we know we're going with you someday back to earth." said, "Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us." &gt;&gt; I remember that night I'd seen a preview of the bride. I stood there and seen a beautiful little ladies just correctly dressed and thing. I heard it coming up the the churches coming up from this other side. There come the Asian church. Oh, you talk about filth. Here come the European church. Oh my. And then I heard a rock and roll coming and it was Miss America the church. And she didn't even have on any clothes. She had papers like newspapers great hold in front of her dancing by rock and roll. Miss America the church. I stood there in his presence. I thought oh God as a minister that that's the best we could do. And when she passed by like that I turned my head to weeping like that. I said I I couldn't standing there him stand there and me know that me a minister of the church and that's what I'd produce for him. I said, "Oh, God, I can't look at it. Let me die. Let me let me fade away." Every time one of them would come, they go out to a certain place and drop off and I just hear the sound of it as it went away. And then I heard something like an onward Christian soldier. And I look, here come that sainted bunch of little girls just back the way it was, all correctly dressed, their hair hanging way down in their back, smooth, clean, marching like this to the step of the gospel. She was a word. It looked like one out of every nation I was looking at as they passed by and seeing them pass by. Instead of going down, they started going up. I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying to get out of line. I scream, "Stay in line." And the vision left me and I was standing in this room screaming, "Stay in line." She has to be molded and made into the image of Christ. And Christ is the word. [Music] Are you disappointed? [Music] Are you desperate for help?
