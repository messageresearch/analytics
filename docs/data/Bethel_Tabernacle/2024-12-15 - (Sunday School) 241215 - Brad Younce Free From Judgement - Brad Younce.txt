========================================

good morning I he's happy to be here I'm definitely happy to be here let's all Stand Together have order of prayer father we just thank you for this opportunity we have to gather together once again father I just pray may you just be with this portion of the service Lord may you be with the words that was spoken be with the hearer father may you be with the the main service Lord be with our brother Lord we expect to hear from you today Father we just place this service into your hands in Jesus name amen um I want to read out of Romans chapter 8 verse 1 through 5 I'm going I'm going to try to to do a Sunday school this morning I'm not going to try to preach it I said try but we'll leave the preaching for the the man in the back but Romans 8 verse1 says there there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh that the righteous of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit may God add a blessings you have your seat for the tip that title I put free from judgment we're already judged you know I got to look at the scripture in in Romans and for some reason the last few weeks I just kept going back and forth between Romans 8 1 and then in into judge into Romans chapter 7 and I was like why why would Paul start this this chapter out therefore there is now no condemnation what brought him to that point so I was reading over into I backed it up into Romans 7 and I I want to go through Romans 7:14 through through the end of that chapter um I want to go back and forth between the King James and the NLT they'll have the King James up here but I thought it was it's a pretty way describes a a Christian today you know Paul he's he's having a struggle within himself you know battling the old nature with the new and you know we read these verses we have to remember Paul was converted he wasn't an unconverted Soul so just remember that we have this flesh we have to deal with so Romans 7:14 they should have it there for we know that that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin but the vers the other version say so the trouble is not with the law for it is spiritual and good the trouble is with me for I'm All Too Human a slave to sin how many how many humans we have here rest of you are angels this is not for you this is for us humans verse 7 7:15 says to that which I do allow not for what I would that I do not but what I hate that I do which is I don't really understand myself for I want to do what is right but I don't do it instead I do what I hate now this is not a uh get out of jail free card if you know what I mean this is not a freedom to sin this this these scriptures don't mean hey I can go out and D World and get drunk and but I got something down the inside of me if you got something real down the inside of you you won't go do those things but this is a battle that we have with our flesh and then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that is good so but if I know that what I'm doing is wrong this shows that I agree that the law is good Hallelujah Romans 717 says but then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me he's not saying sin dwelleth in me he's just talking about the sin that he lives in this is what this this body body of sin because we know once we got saved this didn't get saved this is old sticky nature we live with this but what got saved was down the inside our soul now that is no more that I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I'm not the one doing wrong thank the Lord he says I am not the one doing wrong it is a sin living that I live in that does it for I know that is in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing that's right there's not a good thing that dwells in US amen this flesh anyway dwelleth no good thing for to will is to present with me the how to perform that which is good I find not I know there's nothing good that lives in me that is my sinful nature I want to do what is right but I can't he's not talking about the soul he's talking about this flesh the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do I want to do what is good but I don't I don't want to do what is wrong but I do it anyway we battle this thing yes I battle this thing on the way to church when somebody the speed limit says it's 55 and they're going 40 I battle what's going on inside my flesh it's a constant War if I do that I would not it is no more either that do it but sin that dwelleth in me am so if I do what I don't want to do I I am not really the one doing it it is the sin that's living in me that doing it it's not remember it don't make you free from sin don't be you you still have you still have to battle this thing so then I find a law that when I would do good evil is present with me as long as we live in this body it is sin that's right for I Delight in the law of God but I see another law in my members warning against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members which means there's another power within me that is at war with my mind this power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me so he's saying there's still sin within me there's still sin within this body not in the soul but in this body so he's talking about a battle between the Flesh and the spirit you know you remember the story brother BR told about the old Indian chief you know two dogs are fighting he say how you doing Chief pretty good and pretty bad yeah a lot of times we're pretty bad right some say I'm pretty bad they've been pretty good well how what do you mean he says well see since I received the Holy Ghost there's been two dogs in me one black dog and one white dog and they argue all the time yeah they argue all the time it's like I don't feel like going to church yes you are you're getting up and you're going but I'm too tired but you're going anyway I'm I'm too tired to raise my hands when they say let's raise our hands and worship my arms are tired I'm not doing it yes you are there's a constant battle going on I'm going you're going to say this about somebody no you're not you're not going to gossip there's there's a battle going on they growl and fight at one another the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad well Chief which one of them wins the fight depends on which one Chief feeds the most and then Paul's you know he's like of all these things going on then he says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death oh what a miserable person I am who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death who will deliver me from this flesh body that I live in but then he says I thank God the answer is in Jesus Christ Our Lord so you see how it is in my mind I really want to obey God's law but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin he was chained to a dead man we've heard that saying chained to a dead man I like the way Paul got the inspiration because he was actually chained to a soldier when he was in prison so he was chained to a dead man so we're walking around dragging a dead man around with us that's what this flesh man is is dead he should be dead get what I'm saying I thank God that he's Chang he's changed to a dead man a man that is born of the spirit of God does not commit sin brother Bram says this do you know your body is sin that's the reason now don't try to perfect this body it's sin did you know that it was born in sin shaped in iniquity it come to the world speaking lies and that soul is the same way until the soul died so you're saying my Soul was about to sin was full of sin just like my flesh was oh my goodness we were sin inside and out before we got saved our soul was as dark as our flesh was but then was our soul was then Born Again of God then that Soul can't die the soul that sinth shall die but he that believeth on me has ever everlasting life and then there is an immortal life living in that body that's a stream coming from heaven like a core on the inside of a man that's the part that's Godly and so it operates this body there's where bringing your body under subjection this soul is controlling what you see what you feel what you taste what you listen to what you say what you do so what you you're doing is what your soul is on what you have on inside your soul is what you will do but before this body can ever become perfected the spirit will bring it into submission to God to make you it'll War all the time it's constant Paul said we will never get more than he Paul said what when I would do good then evil is near me and there is a constant War this flesh against the spirit you know Paul no doubt wondering how can I even be saved how many W that sometimes how can I even be saved when I do these things when I iol say something I shouldn't have said or thought something I shouldn't have thought or done something I shouldn't have done what a battle that we have this body causes US problems we think the same way Paul does you know sometimes we get up say how can I even be saved how can God even Save Somebody Like Me is there anybody here that can Deliver Us from this flesh body that we live in how can I be a Christian with these thoughts in my head how can I be a Christian with these things I say come out of my mouth I'm going to be a little human for a minute and this is me y'all forgive me I'll go into a store and hear a song that I used to listen to years ago and next thing I do I find myself singing the lyrics yeah amen how many humans we have here am still have a few Angels you'll find yourself tapping your feet you know Ain't It Funny they say I just thought this ain't it funny you remember those songs that we heard back in the 80s or 90s but when somebody says you want to sing a Christian song we trying to like man the words put them words up there let me hear those words we battle with this flesh oh Wretched Man that I am who will deliver me from this body so there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus thank the I'm glad he said Christ Jesus because when if he said Jesus Christ it would be the man God but he say Christ Jesus it was God man there is therefore now no condemnation sorry I'm starting to preach which was in Christ Jesus or who belongs to Christ amen Who belongs to Christ who walks not after the flesh but after the spirit condemnation means the final verdict no punishment when the judge says not guilty there's no evidence against you Romans 4:25 says who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification this word justification used right here is only mentioned twice in the Bible the next one is Romans 5:18 therefore as by offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of our one the free gift that came upon man unto justification of life so here you go I will give your Christmas gift to you early and we'll give you a present the meaning of the word justification this one means a quiddle a judgment that a person is not guilty of the crime in which the person has been charged Hallelujah you know you I stood in a courtroom one day the judges looked at me he says from the evidence that I have stacked against you you're guilty what are you going to plead I said your honor there's nobody here to defend me no lawyer will take my case they seen the evidence they know there's no way they could win I was fixing to H say guilty but then something spoke behind me says I'll take his case Hallelujah I turned around as when Mercy Mercy Walked In he said I'll be his lawyer I'll take his case hallelujah oh what a defense we have that's right what a Defender we have my lawyer has a reputation of never losing a case Hallelujah he has 100% acquittal rate if we have mercy Christ as your lawyer we can't lose that's right amen so judges looks at me not guilty Hallelujah all charges has been dropped it's as though I didn't do it in the first place praise the freedom from judgment that's the title I'm not going to get done but that's the title so there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus listen what the prophet said about it there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are not it's not those who just believes in him it's those who are in him in Christ Jesus that walk walks not after the flesh but after the spirit and my word and spirit and life because Jesus said in it is a spirit that quith the flesh that proth nothing the words I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so he says there's no more condemnation you're free from sin free from the cares of the world no condemnation why to them that have been by one Spirit baptized into one body that's what it says in 1 Corinthians 12 this is how your free from judgment Believers in Christ are free from judgment because their sins were already judged at Calvary for by one Spirit we are baptized into one body there the blood of the Lamb has been applied the god of Heaven has accepted you his life is in you you are Sons and Daughters of God it's what Romans 8:16 says the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are amen the children of God God your character is God's character not a little pushover he says no sir God is the god of judgment he is the god of correct it must be on the line nothing else will do that's right that's the kind of character that you are amen because you're the character of your father so there is no judgment to the Royal spiritual Seed of Abraham judgment is not our future future event it's not a future event for the believer that's right it was settled at the cross a Believer is Justified and free from the fear of standing judgment praise God because brother say A True Believer bypasses judgment because Christ already stood in their place thank God because Galatians 329 says and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise that's why we're free from judgment we're predestinated to eternal life we don't have to read it but Ephesians 14 says it he's chosen you in him before the foundation of the world Acts 3 1348 says and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord as many that were ordained to eternal life believed and they accepted God's provided sacrifice amen and that sacrifice which was Christ the word cuz John 3918 says he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God the the John 5:24 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life Hallelujah that he that heareth my word is he that understandeth Believers are exempt from standing in judgment because they've already passed from Death To Life Christ bore the punishment for their sins because brother BR says when that you accept Christ you are judged right there amen your sins are cast into the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again and you won't face them at the Judgment thank the Lord Lord he says any drunkard anything else can hear it and walk away but he that heareth my word and understandeth my word believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into judgment but your pass from Death unto life how can a man say that the bride of Christ goes into a tribulation he says I can't understand it she's taken away from tribulation if the church has been judged they have judged judge themselves Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 1 Corinthians 13 for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged amen but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we not be condemned with the world chasing means to train to be instructed or taught to cause one to learn so when we come to church these preachers get behind this pull pit we are taught they're teaching us they're correcting us they're moing our characters moing our character to be like the character of God cuz some men sin goes is open beforehand going before to judgment and some men follow after so they have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless there's no such person every Born Again believer True Believer is perfectly abs absolutely sinless before God that's what 1 John 5:18 says for we know that whosoever is born of God sinth not and he that is begotten of God keep keepeth himself and that Wicked one cannot touch him so whosoever is born of God do not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God so we're not trusting to our works it's to trus in the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Christ that confess is dipped into it's what the Bible says for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it I'll stop right there y'all pray for the service God bless you
