TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh gracious father Lord we want to come before you this morning Father and invite you into this little Sunday school Lord that I can maybe bring something that not of of anything that I would have come up with or I would have thought of but Lord that you would Inspire my heart and my mind and that I could say something that at the behest of your spirit Lord that would help the people to overcome in this evil day Lord we ask these things in your home holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's um turn if you would to um uh we're going to go to St John chapter 8 and 31 says um St John 8:31 it says and then Jesus Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him uh if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall ye shall be made free and Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whomsoever committeth sin is a servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house house forever but the son abideth forever I want to skip down to uh verse 47 and it says uh he that is of God heareth God's word ye therefore hear them not because you're not of God um I also want to well I'll I'll pick up this next scripture in a minute um you can be seated um so there's a a previous Sunday schools that I've um taken there I've talked about you know the truth and how that the the that the uh you know I think it was the last Sunday school that I did um there was a I talked about how the truth of uh that the truth is is there's you can determine the truth by by repetition and and that which uh replicates itself there's truth in that right like you know you have a true seed if it's if it's a proper seed and not a hybrid seed then it's going to reproduce itself um you know we talked about um how you know in the scientific Community the replication of results is how they determine the truth and that that that it it's so striking that the at the end time that the that the call of the end time messenger would be to call people's hearts back to the original to show the power of God to replicate what was originally there to begin with and that there would be that there would be a a truth there you know um you know brother Jason has been using this you know saying how there's just it's it's an original not necessarily old-fashioned right it's the Original Seed not necessarily oldfashioned seed I've always thought it was interesting that you know people say well they don't make them like they used to well it's because things that are very old are built very well they stick around for a long time and um you know so people can call it oldfashioned but at the end of the day it's stuck around because there's something truth there's something true about it right there's something something solid there that doesn't just going to isn't just going to go away uh with with any kind of pressure um and I also talked about how that you know in the in the past you know people in the modern day are so kind of obsessed at least especially in the United States obsessed with freedom and liberty and well this these are my rights and you know don't really have any any desire to attach responsibility to that and to live right but to have rights you know they're you know have a lot of Rights but live very wrong and um you know so it's this and so you know I I recently heard of a politician I don't you know nothing particularly against the guy I'm sure he's a great guy as much as a politician can be um but he uh he said that you know he's we're looking for America's 1776 moment right this is we're going to return back to the original founding fathers and what they believed and I'm like well that's great sentiment and all I wish people would but at the end of the day to return back to that is ultimately going to get a repetition of what they got right we are here now because ultimately we're the product of what they did back then um you so you're not going to go anywhere you're just going to be having the same problem given enough time you know and if every seed brings forth of when every seed does bring forth of its own kind it's oftentimes bringing forth more than what went into the ground right so if that seed went into the ground at the founding of America and now we're seeing the fruit of it now if we return back to the seed when the next cycle round will be so much worse than it is now it's not going to get any better right so there's no there's no real there's no real um foundation in in returning to you know some sort of political Revival and so ultimately the the only real truth the only real you know move forward is to move towards sort of what what you know we as as in time Believers would see as a return to our founding fathers right to return to something that's a little bit more eternal and something that's not going to change and is ultimately going to return itself back to its original on of its own accord and and that it's going to be something that isn't is is more uh is greater than just a nation or greater than just a a a political system or something like that um and you know there was uh you know people you know have this idea of the the Declaration of Independence right that there would be you know that that we hold these truth to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that we have inali inalienable rights well there's a uh I I read this quote this from the church age book where brother brandom said um says what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and then um skipping down a little it says that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted under death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern and so you know they they have these inali you know brother brand calling that the power of God is the church's inalienable right and it so struck me um that the that the term inalienable is uh um I think this is from Websters I can't remember if I pulled this from Websters or Oxford but either way it works it says incapable of being alienated surrendered or transferred so when you have an inalienable right to something it's not something that you yourself can even give up nobody gave it to you God gave it to you and it's really not yours to give away right so when you have the so when the church has the power um what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right right which is she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and Gifts of the Holy Holy Ghost so here here She has the the holy ghost manifested in her midst that's not something that she herself can really give up as long as she's under that pure word of God right it's just going to be there it's it's not going to be something that um you know once that Holy Ghost takes takes root it's not coming out um so he says um I want to I want to come down to this this other quote here where he talks about uh this is from um sir we would see Jesus um well let me let let me let me lay a little more Foundation before I get into that so there's a there's a uh you know we have this this understanding that here we are in the end time with a restoration of back to what the original church had that we should be seeing signs and wonders and and miracles we should be seeing the the work of the spirit moving in our midst we should be seeing we should be be able to move forward on these things and not be not be scared to you know lay claims to the to the uh the the the promises and the word of God um and so we we we we love that we are we are we rejoice in that but that kind of comes with the caveat of that if you want a a real Church lifestyle or the the the church power and the the the manifestation and the move of the spirit like the first church you have to have the first church lifestyle which isn't really what people want to do there's a famous quote um of Thomas aquinus as he's standing at the gates to the Vatican as there are wagon loads of treasure rolling into the Vatican from all over the world and the pope turns to Thomas aquinus and says you know gone are the days where the church can say Silver and Gold Have I None andinus turns to and says correct and gone to are the days where the church can say rise up and walk right this is this is you know you can you can have you know the only there's only one way to really gain that Supernatural power and that's to fall in line with the word of God Amen you know in in the in the order that has been laid out um I want to this is where I want to turn to Ephesians 6 um me get Ephesians you don't have to turn I'm I'm just going to read it um so this is Ephesians 610 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand um and and then he goes into the whole armor of God there well you know there's a there's a requirement there here he is you know if you want to withstand if you want to have the power of God um if you want to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might well there's a process and that process is that you have to equip yourself you have to you have to live your life in a certain kind of way you have to you have to you know as a soldier would you have to prepare your lifestyle to be in accordance with that right you know if we're you know we got the air base out here the Marine Corp air station if I walk up in there in my bright orange electrician t-shirt and my dirty jeans and walk up in there and like hey let me let me jump behind the wheel one of your fighter planes that's not going to go right they're going to be like well no you're not a pilot and you're probably not a marine so what are you doing here and you know and so there's there's a whole process that you've got to go through before you ever get behind the wheel of a fighter plane right there's going to and it's and it's not like I mean you got to go through you got to go through boot camp and it's not you know and when with boot camp they're really picky about how this process goes right you know it's like well I want to be a marine so I'm just going to show up at Paris Island one day I'm like hey I want to be a marine now no it's not how that works you know you got a whole you got a whole process to go through you got to go through testing to make sure they even want you and then and then even after all that they don't it's not like again you don't just show up there you go to a place that's not Paris Island and then you get on a bus with everybody else and then they drive the bus onto Paris Island you might be from buurt but you got to go to the bus and then go onto Paris Island because that's the provided way that the Marine Corps has given you as part of the process and they you know those di they've got it down to an art when those guys step off the bus you know you it's they they're they're very particular about everything that happens from that moment forward right you know you there's everything is going to be exact you know the first thing that comes off you standing on the yellow Footprints right you got to know how to stand up straight and how to how to stand and how to talk how to speak to the to the DI and how to behave yourself how to how to walk how to talk you know everything that you do the the clothes that you wear become Marine Corps clothes the the the food that you eat is Marine Corps food the you know the haircut that you have is a Marine Corps haircut you know everything's Marine Corp because they're building you into something very particular that isn't just any old thing right because before they give you the power of the Marine Corps they're going to make sure that you have a Marine Corps lifestyle that you're following Marine Corps orders and you're living your life in accordance with that so why do we think that this is going to be somehow be any different when it comes to the power of God when you're in the Lord's army there's going to be you you better learn how to walk and talk and and speak like Christ you know you got to you got to the the the the spiritual food that you're feeding on it better be Christ's food you know there there's everything that you do has to be in accordance with that otherwise how can God trust you with this you know it's it's here's a quote from um uh if I can find it you know it says um this is this is from uh the exposition of seven Church ages or from Ephesian Church age um and he says this is one line I thought this is there's just so much power in this one line it says Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life amen right that this was their lifestyle they had a if they wanted holy the power of the Holy Spirit they had to have a holy lifestyle and this this is from um uh you must be born again he says uh someone not long ago I believe I quoted here before uh it says U when the world uh it says why in the world don't you leave them women and men alone to me said why there uh the people believe you to be a prophet he said how can I teach them algebra um he's speaking about the person's asking him why don't you teach people how to you know see visions and do Miracles and all these things he says how can I teach them algebra when they don't know their ABCs see how can you take a child of kindergarten and give him a college education today teach him square root measure how can you do it when he don't know what ABC means you know what ABC means always believe Christ that's right going down a little further he says if you can't believe Earthly things that I tell you how can you believe Heavenly things how are you going to believe spiritual things that enter into the spirit and knowing and seeing visions and things like that to set a school in order like that when they don't even believe Earthly things can't even believe to wear clothes right can't even believe to quit their smoking and quit their lying lay their temper aside and all them things do all these things or quit lusting how can you teach people to enter into the spirit when they got all those things still hanging on them oh my you know so here we see this is there's a process there's a provided way that the lord has laid out that you know there's no other path to to you know Deliverance outside of that right you know if if you know people have these things that are that are um you know you you want to the Devil Comes against us so many times and so many times we want to stand up and and hold the territory that we believe that the Lord has given us amen but because you know it wasn't necessarily the devil that did this this was you know your own it was you not feeding on the word on a regular basis it was you not you know how are you supposed to stand against the devil when he comes against you with some Temptation when you haven't picked up a Bible and who knows when right how can you how are you gon to have the strength to overcome anything if you haven't developed any kind of overcoming power through a lifestyle that is conducive to that sure but if we do conform to that then we can have an advocate with the father then we can say then we have authority right I heard a a a guy I work with he was in the Army and he was an MP right out of basic training and he was stationed in Germany and we came up because they were talking about um some of the guys are going to some like October Fest thing and he was talking about how he was a MP during October Fest in Germany and around the base they would get the MPS to help with the local policing because you had all the American army guys and who getting rowdy and so the local police would get the the MPS at the base to help them do the do the law enforcement so at the end of the day they're going in there shutting everything down and kicking everybody out and so he's like it was my job to jump up on the tables and walk down the tables yelling at people get out and kicking their drinks over and you know you got everybody from this you know major American facility and you know he's you got guys of all kinds of rank he's like I'm a specialist I'm fresh out of basic training and I'm telling officers and sergeant majors to get out and you know and and putting cuffs on them and they're screaming at you going ah I'm this that and the other years you can't I'm I'm I'm Colonel so and so and don't you know who I am and he's like well but in that moment you got to recognize their rank does not supersede your Authority is because I might be some nobody I'm just fresh out of basic training but I've got a two- Star General behind me who said no you're going to shut this thing down because that's what the law says to do we're gonna like you have so much more enforcement power they can say whatever they want but at the end of the day you have the authority here amen because you're not operating on your own authority that fresh basic training guy he's got no Authority he's got nothing but he he's acting on somebody else's Authority and and that's what we got to recognize when we are falling into the order of God's word and we're wearing the uniform right we're wearing the uniform we've T we put on the word as our uniform and we're stepping out behind that and we're living a life in accordance with that well now you have authority that supersedes your own authority right now you have authority that isn't just your Authority your Authority isn't going to go very far right you know what's the what's that um in the you know why does why are we commanded to pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because you're not doing it in your own name you're doing it somebody else's name right you know you it's you know it's the it's it's Christ's name on the check you know if that's that's what we got to understand it's not us doing it it's some it's a it's a higher power that has that is backing you up up and so there's a just in the last couple minutes that we have here you know and so we can step forward knowing that with a security knowing that that we have a uh that we have um enforcement power here this is from um the rest restoration of the Bride tree this is I I this I read this quote some time ago and it really struck me um just want to read it again it says he says to restore means to return to the former owner to to bring back to the former estate of condition and we can enforce a claim to be restored now that's what the Webster says the the word restore means to bring back to the former owner or to bring back to a former state of condition um and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its original place right if you have and you know the analogy that's oftentimes used is the pawn shop right there's something in the pawn shop you go in you pay the money you get it back right it's restored back to you um it says uh to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs belongs um therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore it is to bring it uh bring it back to uh who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time bring it back to its natural condition and in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there is a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore right so if say for instance totally random uh example somebody steals an air conditioning unit and you know cuts the copper lines with a bolt cutter and takes it off to a pawn shop and you happen to know that that's your air conditioner sitting in that pawn Shop's yard and you have a police report saying that somebody stole your air conditioning unit you can walk into the p shop with the law enforcement and say Hey you bought stolen goods that doesn't belong to you I get it back right they have to restore your stolen property cuz it wasn't they bought it from someone but it wasn't that person's thing in the first place it's their responsibility to ensure that person obtained it legally before they buy it so you know so many times you know we have things that are stolen from us you know at the found of the world we have so much there was there was so there was a particular way of life of eternal life of Eternal Liberty of Eternal salvation of not of of freedom from the devil and from sin that was our original possession it belongs to us from day one amen from in the beginning and for the devil to come in and steal that from us means that we have a right to all those things you know we have have a right to not be sick we have a right to not be plagued in our minds and in our hearts with uh you know anything contrary to the word of God right you know the Lord commands us to be joyful the Lord commands us to be happy the Lord does not command us to be be depressed you know that is the work of Satan and so we are not subject to that but the only way that we can enforce that is if we come in the line of order of the word with the authority of the word to back it up because if you just walk into the pawn shop and say hey give me my stuff back he's going to say where's your police report right where's your law enforcement to back you up because I'm not just going to give up you know this property until you can show that there's some Authority there right so many times people don't live a Holiness lifestyle people don't live a holy way and then they want to go confront the devil and then the devil says you know I know Jesus and I know Paul and I know William Brandon but who are you exactly right you don't have any Authority here because you're not there's no you're not F living a lifestyle that the authority is going to associate itself with amen and uh we are out of time so we're gonna we're GNA stand and we'll have a word of prayer and we'll turn you over to the worship leader oh gracious father Lord we thank you for this opportunity to think on your word Lord and think on these good things father we ask that you would just maybe anoint these things to our hearts that we could have them in our heads and and hear them and think that they're you know nice things to think on but Lord if you don't really make it a revelation to us if you don't drop it down to our hearts then ultimately was a it would be for nothing so Lord I ask that you would you would give us the revelation of of these promises that you have let us take hold of it father let us let us take hold of it Lord that we could really put our our weight behind it and and and and not be scared to face the devil on on his own ground Lord we ask these things in your holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
