[17:38] sister Chastity created a Christmas
[17:40] presentation that we would like to play
[17:43] for you at this time amen so
[17:56] foreign
[18:10] [Music]
[18:22] about a baby
[18:24] he wasn't just any baby
[18:28] this one's so so good look at this one
[18:31] in the beginning God made everything
[18:42] he made humans
[18:44] sound like Chris
[18:47] it will get there
[18:51] God would visit humans every day and
[18:53] they talked to each other face to face
[18:55] wait really no point to some invisible
[18:58] being in the sky
[19:00] yeah did you know we were made to be his
[19:03] friend
[19:05] oh what happened
[19:07] the first man and woman sin and we were
[19:11] separated from having that relationship
[19:13] with God that's why Jesus had to come
[19:17] God sent a baby to fix this paper
[19:20] the book explains
[19:25] for the first man and his wife then
[19:27] there was no death or sickness God had
[19:30] to warned them the penalty for
[19:31] disobeying would be death but instead of
[19:34] Killing Them instantly God required an
[19:37] animal sacrifice this was a symbol but
[19:39] it didn't take really take away the
[19:41] people's sins it just said they were
[19:43] very sorry
[19:46] foreign
[19:47] guys just kill them
[19:49] God loves her so much he didn't want to
[19:52] do that he also couldn't break his law
[19:57] the man and woman had children
[19:58] grandchildren and great-grandchildren
[20:00] despite their best intentions they
[20:02] continued to sin they did they were now
[20:06] born with the desires of sin
[20:09] God sent special men called prophets who
[20:12] did many miracles to teach his chosen
[20:14] people how to please him but because of
[20:16] sin the people always failed
[20:21] what kinds of Miracles
[20:24] God sent a great flood but saved one
[20:27] family with an ark
[20:44] he said please
[20:49] and separated a sea for his people to
[20:52] walk
[21:22] foreign
[21:38] God told the prophet that he would send
[21:40] a savior from the whole world his first
[21:43] would be another great miracle and God
[21:45] would be the father
[21:47] so God got married
[21:51] no he he made the baby just like he had
[21:56] made a grown man before
[21:59] first god Set an angel to tell a girl
[22:01] named Mary that she would have God's son
[22:03] the angel said With God all things are
[22:06] possible
[22:09] but Mary was engaged and Joseph doubted
[22:12] she had met an angel
[22:15] I'll talk to an angel have you no but
[22:18] that would be awesome
[22:20] God doesn't just use angels he said
[22:24] there was just a dream
[22:28] I already went to her cousin Elizabeth's
[22:30] house Elizabeth was very old she had
[22:34] never had children before
[22:36] God gave her a baby
[22:38] um but it did not move like he was
[22:41] supposed to
[22:42] when Mary told Elizabeth she was having
[22:44] Jesus Elizabeth's baby finally kicked
[22:48] when Mary returned home she and Joseph
[22:52] were made then they had to go on a long
[22:55] journey the ruler said everyone had to
[22:58] go home to be counted when they finally
[23:00] reached Bethlehem the city was crowded
[23:04] I'm sorry this is all I have you can
[23:07] sleep in my savings for as long as you
[23:09] need
[23:10] the only place that had room for them
[23:13] was a stable where they kept the animals
[23:16] even though it didn't look like much
[23:18] something special would happen God's son
[23:21] would be born right there wait a minute
[23:23] God made everything instead of his son
[23:25] being born in a castle it was more in a
[23:28] stable
[23:29] yep because God made became human for
[23:33] everyone not just the rich
[23:39] foreign
[23:42] what was that
[23:45] Angels announced Jesus was born they
[23:48] told Shepherds in a field that the
[23:51] savior Christ the lord was a newborn
[23:54] baby
[24:00] God doesn't mean money or Jewels but he
[24:02] will always have worshipers
[24:05] [Music]
[24:16] I still don't get it God had a son what
[24:20] does that have to do with Adam and Eve
[24:21] and all this in it
[24:23] as God said Jesus was special he never
[24:27] sinned later he died for everyone's sins
[24:30] and rose from the dead
[24:34] because Jesus came we became we can be
[24:37] friends with gargan
[24:39] we're better than friends we can ask
[24:41] Jesus into our hearts
[24:44] we've become God's family just like
[24:47] Jesus wow I didn't know that it meant
[24:51] for Jesus to be God's son
[24:54] yeah and the best part is that we are
[24:57] God's children too
[24:58] if your parents love you and give you
[25:00] nice gifts then God has even better
[25:03] gifts for his kids

[32:37] praise the Lord
[32:41] this song is uh it is a Christmas song
[32:45] but it's also a song that
[32:48] means very much to me for a couple
[32:50] reasons one
[32:51] is of course that
[32:54] it's a warning
[32:56] that in the day and age we live in
[32:59] um
[32:59] we as the bride should be seeking out
[33:01] the oil for our lamps
[33:04] and we shouldn't be sleeping during this
[33:06] time and sometimes in the world that we
[33:08] live and it's so easy to get comfortable
[33:10] and lulled to sleep
[33:13] and we don't want our fire to be
[33:16] dampened
[33:19] came up for prayer a couple weeks ago
[33:22] when brother Matt was here and
[33:23] ministering and just realized have been
[33:28] realizing that
[33:32] my oil was getting low
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] and uh but I got a refilling
[33:42] the other reason why is uh this song my
[33:46] father-in-law sang it here years ago and
[33:50] yeah
[33:52] so
[33:54] it's very special to us
[33:58] [Music]

[46:58] replacement
[47:00] but they have her stabilized and he's
[47:03] Thanking us for our prayers last night

[47:38] it's say that's a little weird it is to

[47:44] but
[47:46] but we just appreciate it done our heart
[47:49] all the camaraderie and working together
[47:52] and and so many people had a hand in
[47:55] making all that possible

[48:01] thought it all just went off wonderfully
[48:02] I could
[48:04] my kept eating and fellowship and I
[48:06] could have kept hearing singing and we
[48:08] could uh you know if I didn't have to
[48:09] work today I would have stayed around
[48:11] the campfire even longer but I
[48:13] appreciate everybody who pitched in and
[48:16] wanted to thank all the sisters for
[48:19] helping pitch in for all that cleanup
[48:22] and and I you know I rolled up my
[48:24] sleeves and jumped right in there and
[48:26] got all those men out of your way so

[48:42] we will be have we will have a regular
[48:46] service this coming Wednesday actually
[48:47] brother Caleb Campbell is in the slot

[48:52] love it when a man of God has his Fox
[48:54] his tail on fire and he wants to a man
[48:57] run run through the enemy's field and
[48:59] burn up all of his crops amen praise the
[49:02] lord we will be in service here

[49:08] December 25
[49:11] um seems like in my mind Caleb where you
[49:14] at wave at me
[49:16] did we talk about moving the Wednesday

[49:23] your people we might end up sending out
[49:25] an announcement I can't remember what we
[49:26] did last year uh countless sister Debbie
[49:29] for that but we'll figure that out but
[49:31] anyway we will have a midweek service

[49:48] no better place to come than the house
[49:51] of God uh you know it only comes around
[49:53] once every seven years so come on to the
[49:56] house of God bring your family and let's
[49:58] really appreciate the reason for the
[50:00] season I I'm so grateful you know to
[50:03] brother Branham that I was listening to
[50:05] that um that quote there at the end uh
[50:08] sister Chastity by the way that quote at
[50:10] the end that that really got me amen I
[50:13] was falling apart back there in the
[50:15] office and
[50:16] you know I was just brother Brandon you
[50:18] know just living it out for me and I had
[50:21] both my hands up saying Lord have mercy
[50:23] on me but I I appreciated brother
[50:26] branham's language you know I was I was
[50:29] thinking yesterday as we were singing
[50:30] those songs and we're talking about
[50:32] Christmas morning Chris the night before
[50:34] Christmas and all this stuff and of
[50:36] course we know we know that December the
[50:39] 25th is certainly not the birthday of
[50:42] the Lamb of God by no means uh but but
[50:46] I'm glad that a prophet taught us a
[50:48] balance
[50:49] and that we know what the real reason is
[50:52] and that so even when we say that you
[50:55] know we're we're not like the Heathen
[50:57] we're not like the world you know we we
[50:59] have a proper understanding when we talk
[51:02] about Christmas and I'm just grateful
[51:04] for a prophet who could put all of that
[51:06] in perspective put it in Balance say it
[51:09] the right way put the right mindset in
[51:11] in our minds amen praise the Lord we'll
[51:15] try to get this in one position Brother
[51:16] Brad
[51:18] amen so I just wanted to say that and
[51:21] thank everybody and then um
[51:24] plan for the end of the year on Saturday
[51:27] the 31st but we don't want to give you
[51:29] too many announcements at once we've
[51:30] already announced it but we'll remind

[52:29] super familiar to us you pray for me
[52:32] will you please
[52:34] um I I have
[52:37] you know I don't want to say a lot on my
[52:40] plate as if to alarm you that I'm going
[52:42] to do like I did last week and preach a
[52:44] really long time
[52:46] that was an anomaly I don't normally do
[52:48] that but and so I don't it's not that
[52:51] but I I have a very large thought that
[52:54] I'm trying to get my mind fully around
[52:57] because I don't want to leave off
[52:59] anything and I'm continuing today this
[53:02] will be part three on Modern events of
[53:06] 2022 made clear in Prophecy this will be
[53:10] part three and maybe today we'll finish
[53:14] it we don't don't know for sure but even
[53:18] if I get to the end of my notes I don't
[53:20] know for sure just up to the Lord amen
[53:22] Revelation chapter 10.
[53:26] and verse 1 and I was gonna
[53:29] um well we'll just we'll just read these
[53:31] seven first seven verses that's very
[53:33] familiar
[53:35] to us excuse me
[53:37] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[53:40] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[53:43] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[53:46] was as it were the son and his feet as
[53:49] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[53:53] little book open and he set his right
[53:55] foot upon the sea in his left foot on
[53:57] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[54:00] when a lion roared and when he had cried
[54:03] seven Thunders uttered their voices when
[54:06] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[54:07] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[54:10] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[54:13] up those things which the seven Thunders
[54:15] uttered and right them not and the angel
[54:17] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[54:20] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[54:23] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[54:25] ever who created heaven and the things
[54:28] that that therein are and the earth and
[54:31] the things that therein are and the Sea
[54:34] and the things which are therein that
[54:37] there should be time no longer but in
[54:39] the days of the voice of the seventh
[54:42] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[54:45] mystery of God should be finished as he
[54:48] hath declared to his servants the
[54:49] prophets now the way that a mystery of
[54:52] God gets finished is it materializes it
[54:55] goes from it goes from a prophecy that
[54:59] was given to a prophet who spoke it a
[55:03] chronicler who wrote it in a book but
[55:05] then when it's finished it's actually
[55:07] behind skin
[55:09] that's how you know prophecy is
[55:11] fulfilled God doesn't need us brother
[55:13] random said so many times God does not
[55:15] need anybody to interpret his word it
[55:18] interprets itself we're coming up on a
[55:20] season of the birth of the savior of the
[55:23] whole world
[55:24] theologians argued for seven centuries
[55:26] over what Isaiah meant a virgin shall
[55:29] conceive they all had their idea and
[55:31] when he came and fulfilled it that the
[55:34] manifestation was the interpretation so
[55:37] God interpreted it and because as so
[55:40] often is the case because that man-made
[55:44] religion the interpretation they had
[55:46] didn't men didn't match the
[55:49] manifestation God did they didn't see it
[55:52] and they rejected it that's the danger
[55:54] of today all right Revelation chapter
[55:57] 22. I just want to read
[56:00] um
[56:02] um just a quick
[56:04] couple of verses
[56:06] in Revelation chapter 22.
[56:13] verses 16 and 17.
[56:16] I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify
[56:20] unto you these things in the churches I
[56:23] am the root and The Offspring of David
[56:26] and the bright and morning star and the
[56:30] spirit and the bride say come and let
[56:34] him that heareth say come and let him
[56:37] that is a thirst
[56:38] come and whosoever will let him take the
[56:42] Water of Life freely
[56:45] amen praise the Lord father we thank you
[56:48] for the reading of your word today and
[56:51] we're asking special Graces on the
[56:53] hearer the speaker and the hearer Lord
[56:56] in this present audience and those
[56:58] streaming across the internet Lord
[57:01] father we and those who may hear it at a
[57:03] later time on an archive and we're
[57:05] asking special special Graces for Sister
[57:09] Amy King we're asking that you would lay
[57:12] your hand upon her and touch your lord
[57:14] rebuke this infectious evil spirit
[57:16] trying to harm our sister we hold her up
[57:20] in prayer Lord we offer prayer for
[57:22] brother Doug and sister Chastity and the
[57:25] children that you'd be with them on the
[57:27] road keep them safe Lord at every hour
[57:30] those families traveling brother JD and
[57:32] his family traveling different ones
[57:34] perhaps others perhaps Lord we're asking
[57:37] for your mercy upon them as well in
[57:40] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[57:42] you can be seated
[57:45] foreign
[57:59] so if you will just
[58:02] bear with me and be patient
[58:05] um I I want to go through this
[58:08] methodically and I'm I'm not seeking so
[58:11] much to lay a foundation other than to
[58:13] make a couple of comments that I think
[58:15] can bring you up to speed rapidly on
[58:18] where my mind and my heart is on this
[58:21] title modern events
[58:23] of 2022 made clear in Prophecy that's
[58:29] the only way to make sense of the day
[58:32] and hour that we live in
[58:35] is to understand it in the light of
[58:38] Prophecy now I I want to make this
[58:41] statement and this is kind of a
[58:42] qualifying statement that will help you
[58:44] get on board quickly my title is not a
[58:48] prepared news story about headlines
[58:52] that's not the modern events I'm here to
[58:54] report on today there's there's lots we
[58:57] could do you understand uh that's fine
[58:59] to do that did that to a degree and by a
[59:03] certain measure and he would talk about
[59:04] certain events showing up and but but if
[59:07] you'll notice that when a prophet did
[59:10] that it was it was only ever to
[59:13] correlate it with prophecy he would say
[59:16] here's an event this is what it said
[59:18] would happen you're watching it happen
[59:19] so when a prophet is preaching this
[59:22] sermon originally he was letting the
[59:25] people and this is a big point he was
[59:27] letting the people understand
[59:29] prophecy is popping around you right now
[59:32] you're actually living in the vision of
[59:36] God
[59:36] so so this is important especially for
[59:41] our youth because when you're young you
[59:43] just life is just forever and you're
[59:46] young and you don't have hardly a care
[59:47] and you don't even have enough training
[59:49] in life yet to have a care and uh Mom
[59:52] and Dad have taken care of you for so
[59:54] long and you're just now starting to get
[59:56] get your feet wet in the real world and
[59:58] learn that life ain't always Fair
[1:00:01] amen Parents Ought To Say Amen so their
[1:00:03] kids hear them and and so so we find
[1:00:06] that that this that this is an important
[1:00:09] point for you to understand that that
[1:00:12] that this these are not just stories
[1:00:15] there's not a book of philosophy this is
[1:00:19] a book that Chronicles the history and
[1:00:22] the acts of God in history and it
[1:00:25] foretells and forecasts or prophesies
[1:00:28] his actions all through history all the
[1:00:31] way down to the end time now we believe
[1:00:33] we're here and I'm here to tell you
[1:00:35] there are there are prophetic statements
[1:00:37] in this book that correlate directly to
[1:00:40] the to today when your feet hit the
[1:00:43] floor you were living prophecy now I'm
[1:00:46] going to make that clear because you
[1:00:48] know it's uh it's what we're when we say
[1:00:50] modern events of 2022 it we're we're
[1:00:54] trying to emphasize today modern
[1:00:57] spiritual events what does God doing
[1:01:02] what do we see
[1:01:04] in the natural world whether you want to
[1:01:08] talk about politics or education science
[1:01:11] or or uh you know uh the the the
[1:01:14] theological debates that go on the
[1:01:17] social issues
[1:01:20] um economic issues uh brother Matt was
[1:01:23] talking about some of that today
[1:01:24] and in fact as he was he was actually
[1:01:27] what if you caught that brother Matt was
[1:01:29] demonstrating in his in his adult class
[1:01:31] to adult Sunday school class that events
[1:01:34] you know in the natural have their
[1:01:37] greatest importance
[1:01:39] and the spiritual
[1:01:41] what you see happening this is why that
[1:01:44] a prophet would always say the natural
[1:01:46] types the spiritual not the other way
[1:01:49] around because the anatype is the is the
[1:01:52] positive the type is only a shadow you
[1:01:55] say well what I see happening in the
[1:01:57] headlines don't look much like a shadow
[1:01:59] it looks pretty real and tangible listen
[1:02:02] the Earth you walk on is real intangible
[1:02:04] but it's a shadow
[1:02:06] compared to the reality it's going to be
[1:02:10] my
[1:02:12] so I think you're you're starting to
[1:02:14] flow with me I can feel it now
[1:02:16] so so the events I'm reporting on today
[1:02:19] couldn't be more modern
[1:02:24] because
[1:02:26] they're happening right now
[1:02:31] say it again the events I'm reporting on
[1:02:34] today I want your mindset to be that the
[1:02:38] events I'm reporting on today could not
[1:02:40] be more modern because they're happening
[1:02:43] in real time
[1:02:49] uh
[1:02:51] a knowledge of what life is actually
[1:02:56] not the shallow pursuit of stuff mind
[1:02:59] you
[1:03:01] is that is that there is a kingdom
[1:03:05] that is coming
[1:03:07] that in in a certain way is already here
[1:03:11] that the kingdom of God which is coming
[1:03:14] is already operating within you you say
[1:03:17] the kingdom of God is coming to the
[1:03:19] Earth you are Earth
[1:03:21] so it's the the part of the earth that's
[1:03:24] your body the Holy Spirit living inside
[1:03:27] you it's already here
[1:03:30] see so brother Brandon would make the
[1:03:33] statement that the that that the church
[1:03:36] that the bride of Christ is the blood of
[1:03:39] God by the spirit that's a Whoa man that
[1:03:44] is an astonishing statement
[1:03:46] the audacity that some people would say
[1:03:49] who does this guy think he is the the
[1:03:52] church is the blood of God
[1:03:56] by the spirit
[1:03:57] now this is deductive reasoning done
[1:04:00] right when a prophet does it it comes
[1:04:02] out correct
[1:04:03] because his his he's deducing that that
[1:04:07] the new birth comes by the spirit of God
[1:04:12] living inside you that's the new birth
[1:04:15] amen and so when the spirit is in you
[1:04:18] God's life is in you
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:22] and and therefore and since life is in
[1:04:26] the blood
[1:04:28] then the prophet says if the life of God
[1:04:32] is in me and life is in the blood
[1:04:35] and I'm born again of the spirit then by
[1:04:37] the spirit I am the blood of God
[1:04:44] so there's a kingdom that's setting up
[1:04:48] and it's it's actually upon us already
[1:04:53] and when it comes to its full fruition I
[1:04:57] don't normally do this I was talking to
[1:04:58] Sister Debbie about it today I said I'm
[1:05:00] going to feel awkward to take this off
[1:05:01] but I got my work cut out for me today
[1:05:05] brother Howard Carroll used to say two
[1:05:08] things you can't do in a coat one is
[1:05:09] fight
[1:05:11] and the other is work and since
[1:05:13] preaching is both
[1:05:13] [Laughter]
[1:05:17] so there's a kingdom that's setting in I
[1:05:21] want to say that it's setting in upon us
[1:05:24] already
[1:05:26] and it's a kingdom as it's coming
[1:05:30] that it's on a trajectory
[1:05:33] to literally trivialize every man-made
[1:05:37] pursuit in history
[1:05:40] and you say brother Jason that's pretty
[1:05:42] incredible because there's been some
[1:05:44] pretty impressive things happen in
[1:05:46] history and I want to say to you that
[1:05:48] the only ones that count are the ones
[1:05:51] that worked in God's will to further his
[1:05:54] purposes
[1:05:56] his purpose in Redemption any only the
[1:06:01] only history that has any relevance
[1:06:04] eternally speaking I'm not saying
[1:06:05] history didn't have an impact
[1:06:08] when Columbus sailed the blue in 1492
[1:06:11] there's lots of impact on that I'm not
[1:06:14] talking about there's not been history
[1:06:15] that has impact I'm talking about the
[1:06:17] only thing that has Eternal value is
[1:06:19] when God was working out his Plan of
[1:06:21] Redemption
[1:06:24] and therefore the kingdom that's coming
[1:06:26] is literally going to trivialize every
[1:06:28] bit of the history of mankind covering 6
[1:06:32] 000 years
[1:06:33] and so you know I mean listen God
[1:06:36] doesn't even Chronicle the daily lives
[1:06:39] here's how much God thinks about history
[1:06:41] outside of that which is servicing his
[1:06:44] will
[1:06:46] because lots of men have done lots of
[1:06:48] things had nothing to do with the will
[1:06:50] of God they ran on their own tyrants ran
[1:06:53] on their own they're paying for it today
[1:06:57] Creek Kings and monarchs did that and
[1:06:59] they're paying for it today Pharaoh is
[1:07:01] paying for that
[1:07:03] and and and the Bible says the Bible
[1:07:06] actually prophesied his descent into the
[1:07:08] pit
[1:07:09] and how that he came down and just sunk
[1:07:12] down into the pit and all the other
[1:07:13] people in the cells
[1:07:15] because that's what hell is
[1:07:17] it's a place where you're bound over for
[1:07:19] trial
[1:07:20] and you don't you can't bail out you
[1:07:22] don't bail pay bail and get out of this
[1:07:23] one you're either your bail is denied by
[1:07:25] the judge and you're bound over for
[1:07:27] trial
[1:07:29] and how they said to him finally you've
[1:07:31] come to pharaoh take your place in the
[1:07:34] wall
[1:07:35] with all of us
[1:07:38] hell is a very real place
[1:07:41] but God doesn't even Chronicle the daily
[1:07:45] lives of his own family in the Earthly
[1:07:47] journey I mean look we know David killed
[1:07:50] a lion but we have no idea what he did
[1:07:52] the day before
[1:07:53] I know he killed a bear but I don't know
[1:07:55] what he ate for lunch the next day
[1:08:00] John says that even all the acts of
[1:08:03] Jesus while he was here on Earth are not
[1:08:06] even written down
[1:08:07] what God did write down what God did
[1:08:11] record was himself working out his own
[1:08:15] will through people
[1:08:17] that's what this book is about it's God
[1:08:21] working out his will through people and
[1:08:24] and I'm here to tell you the elements
[1:08:26] that refer to today I'd like to be those
[1:08:29] people
[1:08:31] that's why I'm a Believer that's why I'm
[1:08:33] a Christian I want to be the people that
[1:08:36] are fulfilling his prophecy
[1:08:41] see for those who say
[1:08:45] preacher this whole Jesus thing this
[1:08:47] whole Christianity thing
[1:08:49] this whole Bible thing man it just isn't
[1:08:51] for me no worries
[1:08:53] I got a place for you to park no no
[1:08:55] problem no worries
[1:08:57] say oh you know brother Jason as a
[1:08:59] preacher should you really be saying no
[1:09:01] worries well Prophet did
[1:09:03] he tells about in the message is your
[1:09:05] life worthy of the Gospel a woman came
[1:09:08] to him there in Grants Pass and Catholic
[1:09:11] girl all arrogant
[1:09:12] and said hey I want to talk to you
[1:09:14] brother I said cigarette in her hand he
[1:09:16] said what do you want to say
[1:09:17] he said I got a question about this
[1:09:19] religion of yours
[1:09:21] and she just you know this religion of
[1:09:23] yours he said what is it you want to ask
[1:09:27] she said by what Authority do you do
[1:09:29] this
[1:09:30] I said in the name of Jesus Christ by a
[1:09:33] Divine call
[1:09:34] and she went ahead smart enough and I
[1:09:36] said just a minute
[1:09:37] she's and she interrupted him
[1:09:39] said if I had to associate with that
[1:09:41] bunch of ignorance up there she said I
[1:09:43] wouldn't even want to be a Christian I
[1:09:45] said and and and and and say that them
[1:09:49] people will rule Earth someday said I
[1:09:51] hope I'm not here brother M said I said
[1:09:53] don't worry you won't be
[1:09:57] he said you you don't if that's all
[1:09:59] you've got to worry you don't have to
[1:10:00] worry about that
[1:10:02] she said Oh all that carrying on and
[1:10:04] screaming
[1:10:05] and and brother Brandon said aren't you
[1:10:07] a Catholic yeah what does that have to
[1:10:08] do with it said well the Virgin Mary
[1:10:10] screamed and shouted on the day of
[1:10:11] Pentecost she said that's nonsense and
[1:10:14] he said let me turn right to my Bible
[1:10:15] she said we don't read the Bible the
[1:10:17] church tells us what he says he says the
[1:10:19] church is one thing but this is God's
[1:10:21] word
[1:10:22] and he said and he read her the account
[1:10:25] of the of the in the book of Acts that
[1:10:27] how the Holy Spirit fell and they shout
[1:10:29] and screamed and spoke in tongues and
[1:10:30] Mary was among them
[1:10:32] see
[1:10:33] and he says Mary was with them up there
[1:10:35] in that upper room and received the
[1:10:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost like the rest
[1:10:38] of them did and you call her the mother
[1:10:40] of God and call that and call this a
[1:10:43] bunch of backwash and a bunch of trash I
[1:10:45] said don't worry you won't be there you
[1:10:47] don't have much to worry about if that's
[1:10:48] all you got to worry about you better
[1:10:50] worry about your own sinful Soul girl
[1:10:53] and he said and I let her go
[1:10:57] the gospel is only for believers
[1:11:02] the gospel is only for believers
[1:11:06] but for any who who don't want it then
[1:11:08] here here's where you can park
[1:11:10] human philosophy
[1:11:14] science and education that can be your
[1:11:17] religion
[1:11:19] cosmologists the people who study the
[1:11:21] cosmos
[1:11:23] they made I read a statement here said
[1:11:25] and and they're they're trying to you
[1:11:28] know trying to
[1:11:29] quantify and qualify what life is and
[1:11:35] they're they're going about it in a way
[1:11:37] that left me scratching my head they're
[1:11:39] trying to get people to
[1:11:41] you know be responsible and feel
[1:11:44] grateful that you're alive and here's
[1:11:46] how they go about it all right
[1:11:49] the cosmologist even with all their
[1:11:52] depressing talk about the eventual heat
[1:11:55] death of the cosmos because that's what
[1:11:57] they say eventually we're gonna you know
[1:11:59] the sun's gonna burn out it's going to
[1:12:00] run out of hydrogen going to go into a
[1:12:02] vacuum and everything and we're all
[1:12:03] going to die a horrible death but don't
[1:12:05] worry it's billions of years from now
[1:12:09] and it might be fine for us but what
[1:12:10] about the people billions of years from
[1:12:12] now
[1:12:12] see
[1:12:14] he said even with all their depressing
[1:12:16] talk about the eventual heat death of
[1:12:19] the cosmos they offer some comfort you
[1:12:22] all ready here's some comfort if you
[1:12:24] don't want the gospel
[1:12:26] here's you some comfort
[1:12:35] mission of the
[1:12:37] original vastness
[1:12:39] of deep time in which it is physically
[1:12:42] possible for life to even exist
[1:12:45] so we inhabit or are chosen to inhabit
[1:12:50] an astounding privileged privileged
[1:12:54] instant in the lifespan of the universe
[1:12:58] don't you feel lucky
[1:13:04] you know we began with a consideration
[1:13:06] of the 80s old question about the true
[1:13:08] meaning of life and knowledge of what
[1:13:11] life is actually is and why it's so
[1:13:14] important why is it so important that
[1:13:18] the Bible teaches that we should value
[1:13:21] it
[1:13:22] that we should seek it and that we
[1:13:26] should choose it choose life
[1:13:29] the Bible says Deuteronomy 30 19 I call
[1:13:32] I call this is God I call Heaven and
[1:13:34] Earth to record this day against you
[1:13:37] that I have set before you life and
[1:13:40] death blessing and cursing therefore
[1:13:43] choose life that both thou and thy seed
[1:13:47] may live how many want to live how many
[1:13:50] want your Offspring to live then choose
[1:13:53] life
[1:13:54] if you have a a choice then it means you
[1:13:57] could choose otherwise
[1:13:59] you say nobody would do that almost
[1:14:01] everybody is doing that
[1:14:07] so we've we'll find out this morning as
[1:14:09] we go along
[1:14:11] that the cherry on the top of your life
[1:14:15] something actually even better if you
[1:14:17] can imagine something actually better
[1:14:20] than your biological Life by itself is
[1:14:23] if it is crowned by The Loving kindness
[1:14:27] of God
[1:14:29] the proper understanding of life
[1:14:31] uh how it came to be the purpose of it
[1:14:36] all at least as far as eternity is
[1:14:39] concerned because that's the real
[1:14:40] question
[1:14:41] how what is so important about it as far
[1:14:44] as eternity is concerned this is one of
[1:14:46] the most viable Revelations you can
[1:14:48] actually achieve because in this
[1:14:49] Revelation you actually be able to see
[1:14:51] yourself and your position in the
[1:14:54] economy of God
[1:14:55] what could be more important than that
[1:15:01] to share in the existence of God himself
[1:15:04] in a kingdom that will never pass away
[1:15:07] you somebody tell me what's more
[1:15:09] important than that to share in the
[1:15:11] existence of God
[1:15:13] think about that to to literally share
[1:15:17] in the existence of God himself and live
[1:15:20] in a kingdom of his making that will
[1:15:22] never pass away and a kingdom not only
[1:15:26] will it not ever pass away it'll never
[1:15:28] stop increasing
[1:15:31] our future is bright friends I say it
[1:15:33] all the time our future is bright
[1:15:39] my I certainly think that's a a fate
[1:15:42] much better than some Cosmic ending
[1:15:44] don't you
[1:15:45] where we're told that somehow we should
[1:15:47] be grateful that
[1:15:49] we have some privileged instant of
[1:15:51] existence
[1:15:53] you know he he he redeemed me in an
[1:15:55] instant down on my knees but as far as
[1:15:57] my life is concerned it'll never end
[1:16:01] my my life in his kingdom will never end
[1:16:05] I thought about the other day I was
[1:16:07] thinking about thoughts and I I just
[1:16:09] wrote this on on my notes thinking in
[1:16:11] the new heavens and the new Earth I'm
[1:16:13] not talking about thinking about them
[1:16:14] I'm talking about when you're there and
[1:16:16] you're they're thinking
[1:16:19] I thought about this
[1:16:21] seeing things in perspective
[1:16:25] realizing what was working all along
[1:16:29] and that God was never troubled
[1:16:32] and why was I so worried
[1:16:38] I love these kind of thoughts
[1:16:41] thoughts on the other side and my
[1:16:44] mind like it was always going to come to
[1:16:46] this
[1:16:47] when I see you on the other side by the
[1:16:50] giddy I was so enjoying that song you
[1:16:51] sang this morning and I thought we're
[1:16:53] going to sit around the throne we're
[1:16:54] going to sit around the Great
[1:16:56] on a sit by the tree of life and and
[1:16:58] we're going to say man why were we ever
[1:17:01] worried about
[1:17:03] wow
[1:17:04] it was always going to come to this
[1:17:07] you know if we can stop laughing and
[1:17:09] rolling around on the ground
[1:17:12] the trials of life that you know as well
[1:17:14] as me aren't worth mentioning
[1:17:16] once you're there
[1:17:19] Paul said it won't even be worth
[1:17:20] mentioning
[1:17:23] and you know what you know one of the
[1:17:25] things that I'm going to realize on the
[1:17:26] other side every trial I ever had in
[1:17:29] every up and every down and every in and
[1:17:31] every out and every failure and every
[1:17:32] success
[1:17:34] was to get me here
[1:17:37] that's a thought on the other side when
[1:17:40] I'm looking back in the used to be Chris
[1:17:43] I'm going to realize everything that
[1:17:45] ever happened oh I'm gonna laugh at the
[1:17:48] Devil then everything that ever happened
[1:17:49] listen friend as I said you in a sermon
[1:17:52] or two the other other week that Abram
[1:17:54] all of Abraham's ups and downs placed
[1:17:57] him in that tent door it was all of
[1:18:00] Moses's ups and downs it was his
[1:18:02] failures that brought him to a burning
[1:18:05] bush
[1:18:06] oh my this is why this is why even
[1:18:09] blasphemy
[1:18:12] that Paul committed could not disqualify
[1:18:15] him
[1:18:16] blasphemy
[1:18:18] see
[1:18:19] because the bottom line is that there is
[1:18:22] nothing that could separate Paul from
[1:18:24] the love of God
[1:18:25] that was in Christ not when he became a
[1:18:28] Christian but before the foundation of
[1:18:30] the world
[1:18:31] see
[1:18:33] at first Thessalonians 5 explains why
[1:18:36] that is because we're Children of the
[1:18:38] day we're not of the night we've
[1:18:39] preached on that
[1:18:41] First Corinthians 2 14 but the natural
[1:18:43] man receiveth not the things of the
[1:18:46] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[1:18:49] unto him neither can he know them
[1:18:51] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:18:54] y'all know I started late so everybody
[1:18:56] just sit tight for a little while how
[1:18:59] about it went into vapor lock and looked
[1:19:00] at that clock but I remember I started
[1:19:02] late amen we were we were rejoicing with
[1:19:04] the Smith family amen so y'all keep
[1:19:07] let's keep it going
[1:19:08] so but the natural man First Corinthians
[1:19:11] 2 14 the natural man receiveth not the
[1:19:13] things of the spirit of God for their
[1:19:14] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:19:17] them because they're spiritually
[1:19:18] discerned
[1:19:20] so we found out in in part two when we
[1:19:23] preached on this part two that this
[1:19:26] Revelation that God would bring to us
[1:19:28] about his kingdom which is an event
[1:19:30] happening as we live and breathe
[1:19:34] you're living in Kingdom time brother
[1:19:35] Branham declared that in the seventh
[1:19:37] seal he said the kingdom of of God is
[1:19:40] coming as it has been it's already when
[1:19:44] that angel descended let me tell you
[1:19:45] something friend the kingdom clock was
[1:19:47] moving
[1:19:49] Hallelujah
[1:19:50] oh my
[1:19:52] you're an event on the way to an event
[1:19:54] he's coming back for those 144 thousand
[1:19:56] he's got to Exodus you out of here first
[1:20:00] Hallelujah
[1:20:02] we found out that the revelation of this
[1:20:05] kingdom is what would restore Shalom to
[1:20:07] the bride it's what would give her peace
[1:20:09] it's what it this Covenant angel that
[1:20:12] has descended Among Us that's the one
[1:20:14] who come to give us peace
[1:20:16] to realize that God's got it in control
[1:20:19] and I'm not up here today to Chronicle
[1:20:22] your history all I can tell you is God's
[1:20:25] got it all in control and he's all
[1:20:27] always been in control he's never not
[1:20:29] been in control and so let us say shalom
[1:20:32] bride
[1:20:35] it's gonna be okay so you don't know
[1:20:37] what's happening it doesn't matter it's
[1:20:39] going to be okay
[1:20:42] do I am I controlling this uh up here is
[1:20:45] this little guy working or no
[1:20:47] okay it might work for me
[1:20:50] it won't let's see
[1:20:56] you're right as usual Matt
[1:21:01] all right bubs you ready for me
[1:21:05] brother Branham comes in the message
[1:21:07] let's start with our first uh slide here
[1:21:09] the faith of Abraham
[1:21:12] 1959 April 1959 brother Brandon said
[1:21:16] whosoever is born of the spirit of God
[1:21:20] is God's
[1:21:22] and your come in
[1:21:24] by the promise through the Covenant God
[1:21:28] made to Abraham now I I I hope that you
[1:21:32] really absorb what's being said here
[1:21:35] that you you come in
[1:21:38] through the through the Covenant God
[1:21:41] made to Abraham his promise that he
[1:21:44] would send Christ
[1:21:46] and if you're in Christ
[1:21:50] you're part of that Covenant
[1:21:54] so now
[1:21:56] this is why a covenant angel you're
[1:21:59] going to find out here in a few minutes
[1:22:02] this is why this Covenant Angel is Among
[1:22:05] Us now
[1:22:06] it's not just the it's it it's the same
[1:22:10] God that dwelt above Israel and the same
[1:22:12] God that walked the shores of Galilee
[1:22:15] it's the same being the same person that
[1:22:17] came down in an upper room but I'm here
[1:22:20] to tell you now he's come into this age
[1:22:22] and there's some unique things about
[1:22:24] this age and about what he's up to and
[1:22:26] one of the things he's up to is finally
[1:22:28] at last at long last he's here to
[1:22:31] fulfill his Covenant he's here to finish
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:37] you have come in because of that
[1:22:40] covenant not how good you are how bad
[1:22:43] you are how smart you are how handsome
[1:22:45] you are you're in because of a covenant
[1:22:47] God made to a man
[1:22:52] almost 4 000 years ago
[1:22:58] more than actually now that I think
[1:22:59] about it
[1:23:02] so he goes on next slide
[1:23:05] and the promises you say now here's what
[1:23:08] you say I'm not worthy neither was
[1:23:11] Abraham

[1:25:13] shalom
[1:25:15] Shalom this is a covenant Angel this
[1:25:18] what the Covenant angel came to a to
[1:25:21] ensure in your heart you're going to
[1:25:24] need rapturing Faith so he sends a
[1:25:26] rapturing word smears it heavy with
[1:25:29] Rapture and Grace and hands it to you
[1:25:31] like a piece of butter toast and says
[1:25:33] eat this
[1:25:34] because you're going to need to have
[1:25:36] faith I don't have any faith in me
[1:25:37] that's great have faith in him the
[1:25:39] Covenant angel
[1:25:42] this is a kingdom coming into play
[1:25:46] I'm here to tell you God's thought of
[1:25:48] everything
[1:25:49] by the time I get done you're not going
[1:25:51] to find any way to kick yourself out
[1:25:54] or disqualify yourself
[1:25:57] see
[1:25:58] so it's it's it's what God Made You is
[1:26:03] what you are so so not not to me in me
[1:26:07] it's what God made you not to you but in
[1:26:11] you it's a gene representation inside of
[1:26:16] me that I was never good enough to get
[1:26:18] and I could never be bad enough to lose
[1:26:21] it's a representation before the world
[1:26:24] was ever built
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:27] see
[1:26:29] so he he's saying to stay right there
[1:26:32] dubs he's saying that you were those
[1:26:35] things to start with see
[1:26:39] you say wow I mean
[1:26:41] goodness this Prophet is insulting me
[1:26:45] you're finished to begin with you're a
[1:26:47] failure to start with didn't you love it
[1:26:49] how many wanted to come to church today
[1:26:51] to hear your pastor look you in the eye
[1:26:53] and say you're nothing to begin with
[1:26:58] you're finished to start with you're a
[1:27:00] failure
[1:27:01] to start with see say all that that
[1:27:05] Prophet you know he he's insulting me is
[1:27:07] he are you sure
[1:27:10] what he's saying is is that you were
[1:27:12] those things to start with you were
[1:27:15] those things in your past
[1:27:17] a prophet is saying to you a prophet is
[1:27:21] saying to you a prophet is saying to you
[1:27:26] you're not those things anymore
[1:27:33] you're not those things anymore
[1:27:39] my yeah I started that way I was a
[1:27:42] stinker for sure but you're not that way
[1:27:45] anymore why because you received a
[1:27:49] covenant promise
[1:27:51] Hallelujah
[1:27:54] Prophet is declaring that you're not
[1:27:56] what you used to be
[1:27:59] you know I'm not so sure the world is
[1:28:01] convinced of that about me and I'm not
[1:28:04] sure even I always feel convinced but a
[1:28:07] prophet isn't declaring what the world
[1:28:09] thinks or what you think or what I think
[1:28:11] he's not declaring about all your
[1:28:13] shortcomings and your failures it's not
[1:28:15] about your feelings it's what God thinks
[1:28:19] about you
[1:28:22] see the devil is good he's a master at
[1:28:24] Psychology you can't take him on in
[1:28:26] those Realms of intellectualism that's
[1:28:28] why you need a revelation that's why I
[1:28:29] start out by saying there's nothing to
[1:28:31] to have greater than revelation of what
[1:28:33] life actually is see
[1:28:36] because the devil will place a thought
[1:28:38] in your head he might be trying to do it
[1:28:40] right now and and he because because
[1:28:42] listen he's got the video replay of all
[1:28:45] your weaknesses and all your stumblings
[1:28:47] and he he's actually might be right now
[1:28:50] trying to make you think that it's your
[1:28:53] thought I'm not worthy I can't make it
[1:28:56] uh how I mean as I thought to myself
[1:29:00] Lord this is so amazing but I thought to
[1:29:03] myself how can an all-knowing God lie to
[1:29:07] himself about me
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:11] and and that's a thought from the enemy
[1:29:14] who might be trying to get you to think
[1:29:16] it's your thought
[1:29:19] how can God nobody in here knows what
[1:29:22] I'm guilty of
[1:29:23] how can God lie to himself about me God
[1:29:28] is not lying about me
[1:29:31] he's not looking at me
[1:29:36] he's looking at Christ
[1:29:39] crediting it to me
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:44] Hallelujah
[1:29:46] next slide dubs
[1:29:49] under the old Covenant let me keep up
[1:29:51] with myself here
[1:29:53] under the old Covenant
[1:29:55] I love this story
[1:29:58] what if a little mule would be borne out
[1:30:00] in the past you like that Kentucky word
[1:30:02] born
[1:30:04] out in the pasture some night and
[1:30:06] when that little mule was born he'd turn
[1:30:09] around in his Mammy would look at him
[1:30:11] and his ears would be flopped down you
[1:30:14] know what a flop-eared mule is being a
[1:30:16] farmer that mule is no good he's
[1:30:18] cross-eyed
[1:30:19] see you just go break his neck and kill
[1:30:22] him he's worthless he'll he'll eat food
[1:30:25] you can't you don't even need to feed
[1:30:26] him see
[1:30:27] a farmer knows that next slide his knees
[1:30:31] his knees knocked together
[1:30:34] his tail sticks straight up in the air
[1:30:38] he's the horriblest thing a harmless
[1:30:41] looking sight you ever seen that little
[1:30:44] fella could look around to his Mommy and
[1:30:46] say well I won't be able to live no
[1:30:48] circles as soon as the master comes out
[1:30:50] here he'll knock me in the head because
[1:30:51] I ain't worth nothing
[1:30:54] next that's just about like every one of
[1:30:58] us
[1:30:59] but his mother well instructed in the
[1:31:03] word of God she'd say wait a minute
[1:31:04] honey no no you are born under a
[1:31:08] Birthright when the man of the house
[1:31:10] comes out he will go to the pasture and
[1:31:12] hunt the most perfect lamb he's got next
[1:31:16] the high priest will never see you he
[1:31:20] will see the lamb he won't examine you
[1:31:22] he will examine the lamb because you're
[1:31:26] born under a Birthright the lamb has to
[1:31:29] die for you
[1:31:32] now you look at Jesus and find fault in
[1:31:35] any fault in him don't look at yourself
[1:31:38] look at him don't look at who you are
[1:31:40] don't look at who you are don't look at
[1:31:42] who you are don't look at who you are
[1:31:43] look at who he is
[1:31:47] next then you'll be getting close to
[1:31:50] Divine Healing sturge your sacrifice
[1:31:53] over if you can find any fault in that
[1:31:55] well that's different then you have a
[1:31:56] right to disbelieve but there's no fault
[1:31:59] in him God don't look at you he looked
[1:32:02] at your sacrifice
[1:32:06] shalom
[1:32:09] these These are the principles and the
[1:32:12] realities and the covenants that the
[1:32:15] Covenant angel that that same Angel made
[1:32:18] the Covenant to Abraham and he's here
[1:32:20] today to enforce it I'm here to tell you
[1:32:23] the devil can't get you because a
[1:32:25] covenant Angel is present
[1:32:27] you have a token over your home you have
[1:32:30] a token over your family and it has
[1:32:32] jurisdiction because of Covenant Angel
[1:32:35] has descended in our day

[1:32:45] a perfect one died for us fall tree ones
[1:32:48] boy word kept kicking that back to me
[1:32:52] dictionary.com faltery fall tree what in
[1:32:54] the world you ain't faulty no faltery
[1:32:59] there was a perfect one died for us
[1:33:02] faltery ones
[1:33:04] see faulty is just for those with few
[1:33:07] faults but I have so many I'd needed an
[1:33:10] extra letter in there
[1:33:13] I know that's not the King's English but
[1:33:15] I'll stick with Kentucky English on this
[1:33:17] one why because Scholars could never
[1:33:25] next next Noah wow that little mule
[1:33:30] uh
[1:33:31] uh that's not right oh yeah we here
[1:33:34] you're right you're right Noah we who
[1:33:36] are disfigured and immoral and ugly
[1:33:41] and I love this next word because

[1:33:50] tree ones see he took the perfect one
[1:33:54] and looked him over this is my beloved
[1:33:57] Son in whom I'm well pleased he was the
[1:33:59] sacrifice God accepted him so ours is
[1:34:05] finished

[1:34:14] Grace
[1:34:16] what do I have to do brother Jason walk
[1:34:19] in Grace
[1:34:21] hearing receiving

[1:34:30] word I'm what are you doing I'm walking
[1:34:32] in Grace you know you're probably not
[1:34:35] very worthy you're not wrong but I'm
[1:34:37] walking in Praise so you think you're
[1:34:40] going to get into heaven yeah me and all
[1:34:41] these other faltery ones we're all
[1:34:43] getting in because we heard we recognize
[1:34:47] we received and we're willing to act
[1:34:50] upon the word of God
[1:34:53] hallelujah next slide well that little
[1:34:57] mule
[1:34:58] could just kick up them them little
[1:35:01] heels and knock them little knock knees
[1:35:04] together and knicker and go all over the
[1:35:06] field because he's free he don't have to
[1:35:09] die you notice he's still got his knock
[1:35:10] knees
[1:35:13] I'm not saying you look much better than
[1:35:15] you did two minutes ago I'm simply
[1:35:18] saying it don't matter
[1:35:20] you might you might still have your
[1:35:21] knock knees you might still have your
[1:35:22] weaknesses you might steal until you get
[1:35:24] out of this flesh someday we're gonna
[1:35:26] have to battle our memory we have to
[1:35:28] battle our weaknesses we have to battle
[1:35:29] our our like passions like Elijah but
[1:35:32] I'm here to tell you it doesn't matter
[1:35:34] because he wasn't looking at you he was
[1:35:37] looking at your sacrifice
[1:35:42] this is a modern event make clear
[1:35:46] in 2022
[1:35:52] a lamb died for him
[1:35:55] he's perfectly
[1:35:58] safe
[1:35:59] don't have to fear about dying
[1:36:03] the land died for him
[1:36:06] you don't have to fear about what you
[1:36:08] are
[1:36:10] it's what he was
[1:36:12] he was the one who died for you
[1:36:17] next then you find fault in him
[1:36:20] then I'll tell you why you can't be
[1:36:22] healed
[1:36:23] see because people find fault in the
[1:36:25] word they argue against and wonder why
[1:36:26] they can't get their prayers answered
[1:36:29] they try to reason God's word and they
[1:36:31] won't just obey it
[1:36:33] and then they wonder why I don't have
[1:36:34] any power with God stop reasoning the
[1:36:37] believe on him whom God hath sent
[1:36:40] believe what God has said in this day a
[1:36:43] covenant angel came down to confirm that
[1:36:45] Prophet was a real one and he was a true
[1:36:47] one and the message is accurate
[1:36:50] and and signs and wonders Will Follow
[1:36:52] That faith and the power of God will get
[1:36:54] behind that Faith Amen Brother John
[1:36:57] Hallelujah I'm here to tell you it'll
[1:36:59] it'll reach out into the Ethereal and
[1:37:01] take an impossible situation and
[1:37:03] rearrange the whole thing and leave
[1:37:04] everybody astonishing
[1:37:11] it'll send brother Jack
[1:37:13] to work on a house
[1:37:16] of an attorney
[1:37:17] who just happens to know through a
[1:37:19] friend connected to the woman trying to
[1:37:22] come after brother Jack if immorally
[1:37:24] over over money that she she knows good
[1:37:27] and well brother Jack is completely
[1:37:29] innocent and everybody in the county
[1:37:30] knows brother Jack
[1:37:31] and this high priced highfalutin lawyer
[1:37:34] you know what he told

[1:37:43] and go home ain't nobody gonna come
[1:37:45] after Jack guest
[1:37:47] everybody around here knows the
[1:37:50] testimony of Jack guess
[1:37:52] hey man that's God defending his family
[1:37:57] that's Decades of following the ways of
[1:38:01] the word that's Decades of testifying
[1:38:04] what God has done that's Decades of
[1:38:06] believing in a covenant
[1:38:08] Hallelujah
[1:38:12] see then you find fault in him I'll tell
[1:38:15] you why you can't get healed but when
[1:38:16] you find no fault in your sacrifice
[1:38:18] God has accepted that sacrifice and when
[1:38:21] he accept the sacrifice he accepts your
[1:38:24] confession in that sacrifice and you
[1:38:27] become a part of it a part of what the
[1:38:30] Covenant
[1:38:32] the Covenant that he made with Abraham
[1:38:35] see
[1:38:36] my but you know Pastor Jason I I really
[1:38:40] do have many flaws and I I really do
[1:38:43] make many mistakes but there's no fault
[1:38:45] in him
[1:38:47] God don't look at you he looked at your
[1:38:51] sacrifice there was a perfect one died
[1:38:54] for us faltery ones
[1:39:00] is the next slide blank Noah
[1:39:04] no okay that's fine
[1:39:08] I thought I had a blank one in there oh
[1:39:10] you're right go to go to the next one
[1:39:12] I feel religious now
[1:39:14] because I know I didn't have a chance to
[1:39:17] begin with but I didn't look at myself I
[1:39:20] looked at the sacrifice that was offered
[1:39:21] for me it was perfect and God already
[1:39:23] accepted it so then I'm I'm all right
[1:39:25] now when I see what he did what he is it
[1:39:29] isn't me it's him it isn't you it's him
[1:39:32] friends if you don't get nothing else
[1:39:35] out of this service today hear the
[1:39:36] Covenant Angel saying to you it ain't
[1:39:38] you it's him it ain't you it's him it
[1:39:41] ain't you it's him the Covenant ain't
[1:39:42] based on you it wasn't based on Abraham
[1:39:44] it's based on God it's based on God's
[1:39:47] purpose in Redemption
[1:39:49] said I have chosen you Abraham and I'm
[1:39:52] not telling you if you will this and I
[1:39:54] will that he said I'm here's here to
[1:39:55] tell you I've already done it
[1:39:57] you're going to be the father of Nations
[1:40:01] now watch last last one here before we
[1:40:04] hit a blank slide and and you'll never
[1:40:06] receive the holy ghost in the fullness
[1:40:08] you'll never walk in the spirit of God
[1:40:10] until you totally separate your things
[1:40:12] from unbelief get away from the world
[1:40:14] come out of the world
[1:40:17] see this Grace isn't disgrace
[1:40:21] this isn't just name it claim it this
[1:40:24] isn't just you know just believe easy
[1:40:26] believism this is actually something
[1:40:29] that comes inside of you you say well
[1:40:32] now okay now we're back to my ups and
[1:40:34] downs and failures again no I'm talking
[1:40:36] about God has already taken care of all
[1:40:38] of that but it but if you want to know
[1:40:41] if it's really taken care of if you
[1:40:43] really want to know if the Covenant
[1:40:45] Angel has assured it to you if you do
[1:40:47] you have so on personally you have it if
[1:40:50] you know that inside your heart you love
[1:40:52] God and you love his word and you hate
[1:40:54] sin and you don't want failure you might
[1:40:56] have it but you don't want it
[1:40:59] because why something changed me I'm not
[1:41:03] trying to be a name it Christian I'm
[1:41:05] trying to be a real one
[1:41:12] I think I have a
[1:41:15] I think I have a blank one now right
[1:41:16] Noah yeah go to that and just hold right
[1:41:18] there
[1:41:20] see the inherent weakness
[1:41:24] and all of us faultry ones
[1:41:27] is to believe God's word
[1:41:30] and God's decision regarding ourselves
[1:41:34] come on
[1:41:35] that's it
[1:41:36] let's just look each other in the iron
[1:41:38] just admit that
[1:41:39] that's really the problem
[1:41:41] I'm a faltery one and I'm I'm more of a
[1:41:44] fault I'm far more of a faltery one
[1:41:47] by not believing what I've just heard
[1:41:49] and read I'm far more faltery not
[1:41:52] believing that than I am committing some
[1:41:54] transgression
[1:41:56] I'm way more faultry by not believing
[1:41:58] the Covenant
[1:42:00] that God isn't it that it's not even
[1:42:01] upon me I I Repent we first John says
[1:42:05] this
[1:42:06] um Noah take it down can you go to
[1:42:09] scripture and then we'll put it back up
[1:42:10] all right take it down and go to
[1:42:12] scripture first John 1 7 to 10.
[1:42:15] everybody's still good
[1:42:18] first John 1 7-10
[1:42:21] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:42:24] the light
[1:42:25] we have Fellowship one with another and
[1:42:27] the blood of Jesus his son cleanseth us
[1:42:30] from all sin
[1:42:33] if we say we have no sin we deceive
[1:42:36] ourselves and the truth is not in US
[1:42:38] but here's the beautiful part if we
[1:42:41] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:42:44] to forgive our sins
[1:42:47] and to cleanse us from all
[1:42:50] unrighteousness how many have you ever
[1:42:52] experienced that
[1:42:55] I have experienced that
[1:42:57] more times than I'd like to admit I
[1:42:59] probably better raise up both hands I
[1:43:01] have experienced that friends he is
[1:43:04] faithful and just if we say that we have
[1:43:07] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:43:09] word is not in us see
[1:43:12] so the the idea is to get you off your
[1:43:15] high horse and stop saying you're holier
[1:43:17] than thou
[1:43:18] stop saying you're perfect see because
[1:43:22] you know you know what's just as you
[1:43:24] know it's just as bad as as a
[1:43:27] self-righteous person saying I'm perfect
[1:43:28] the polar opposite to say I just can't
[1:43:31] believe God's word about me
[1:43:35] one is as bad as the other and so he's
[1:43:37] using contrast to try to get you to say
[1:43:39] look you're don't say you don't have sin
[1:43:42] but understand we have an advocate
[1:43:45] and if you'll confess he's faithful and
[1:43:47] just to forgive us first John chapter 2
[1:43:50] go right on into the second chapter
[1:43:51] there no Noah verse one and two my
[1:43:53] little children these things right I
[1:43:55] unto you that you sin not and if any man
[1:43:58] sin we have an advocate with the father
[1:44:00] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the
[1:44:03] propitiation for our sins and not for
[1:44:06] ours only but also for the sins of the
[1:44:08] whole world chapter 3 verse 8 and 9 he
[1:44:12] that committeth sin is of the devil for
[1:44:14] the devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:44:17] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:44:19] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:44:21] works of the devil that's why the
[1:44:22] Covenant Angels here if he can just get
[1:44:24] you to believe it see whosoever is born
[1:44:27] of God doth not commit sin for his seed
[1:44:32] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:44:36] because he is born of God
[1:44:40] so I might commit a transgression of
[1:44:43] which I have an advocate that I can
[1:44:45] confess it and he's faithful and just to
[1:44:47] forgive me but I have a representation a
[1:44:50] gene of God done inside me that predates
[1:44:53] my Earthly existence predates my
[1:44:55] failures it predates everything it
[1:44:58] predates Lucifer it predates everything
[1:45:03] Hallelujah
[1:45:06] see
[1:45:07] this is why I was saying the other night
[1:45:10] true repentance is the key to life
[1:45:15] I have some other statements I want to
[1:45:17] read you from different messages but I'm
[1:45:18] only going to put one of them up a final
[1:45:20] last quote
[1:45:21] let's refer to you this when God doesn't
[1:45:23] call a man to judgment without first
[1:45:24] warning him
[1:45:27] January July 24 1963 he says if no
[1:45:30] repentance
[1:45:32] then judgment is sure to come
[1:45:35] see Hezekiah repented
[1:45:38] see Nineveh repented
[1:45:42] Ahab never repented
[1:45:44] Nebuchadnezzar never repented
[1:45:47] the people in Noah's time never repent
[1:45:50] and the judgments swept right on see now
[1:45:54] but he first warns everybody
[1:45:57] everybody gets a warning now seeing the
[1:46:02] time is at hand now I didn't put these
[1:46:04] up on purpose because I wanted to read
[1:46:06] them slow and I want to read them for
[1:46:08] effect and I want you to absorb
[1:46:12] see now
[1:46:14] seeing the time is at hand let everyone
[1:46:17] that feels that there is a warning
[1:46:20] repent quickly before the wrath of God
[1:46:23] strikes
[1:46:26] I was showing my wife a
[1:46:28] news article brother Donnie put in The
[1:46:30] Minister's chat early this morning
[1:46:32] that scientists are now
[1:46:34] all in all in a massive agreement all
[1:46:38] have concluded that the West Coast that
[1:46:42] a that a major major natural destruction
[1:46:48] is imminent
[1:46:50] and they said even San Francisco alone
[1:46:53] and I haven't even read the whole
[1:46:54] article yet I only got down to the about
[1:46:55] the first paragraph and they're talking
[1:46:57] about Northern Cal
[1:46:59] and they said what is awaiting San
[1:47:01] Francisco alone is an event many times
[1:47:05] the magnitude of many nuclear bombs
[1:47:12] and a prophet said Los Angeles you're
[1:47:14] doomed
[1:47:16] God is going to sink Hollywood and put
[1:47:18] her beneath the ocean
[1:47:20] and it'll come all the way back a chunk
[1:47:23] of land 1500 miles long and 350 miles in
[1:47:25] all the way back to the Salton Sea will
[1:47:27] break off sink and slide Beneath the Sea
[1:47:30] in the tribulation period
[1:47:33] and now you know science is not just
[1:47:35] saying they were saying back in the 60s
[1:47:37] not a matter of if but when but now this
[1:47:39] newest latest article is on Yahoo News
[1:47:41] they were they're saying No this this
[1:47:43] you don't realize this this is happening
[1:47:46] soon
[1:47:50] so if you hear that see
[1:47:52] but but watch he says
[1:47:55] so so he comes to this let me let me let
[1:47:58] me give you this I'm trying to I'm
[1:47:59] trying to move quickly
[1:48:01] oh brother Dao y'all remember old
[1:48:02] brother Dao
[1:48:04] past 90 when brother Brown led him to
[1:48:05] the Lord
[1:48:06] he comes to brother random one day
[1:48:09] and he's just troubled he's a fall tree
[1:48:11] one
[1:48:12] and he's having a hard time believing
[1:48:15] some of the hard things you're having a
[1:48:17] hard time believing
[1:48:19] because we're faltery
[1:48:21] and we we know our own weaknesses
[1:48:24] know thyself I wish I didn't
[1:48:29] speaking to brother Dao brother thou
[1:48:31] come to him with this question
[1:48:34] he says brother Branham you know do I I
[1:48:36] just need to be sure and he says now I
[1:48:39] said in this case I'm giving it a soul
[1:48:42] examination see
[1:48:44] and God for the soul only has one
[1:48:46] instrument that's right that's his word
[1:48:49] that's his word and Jesus said in Saint
[1:48:52] John 5 24 he that heareth my word now
[1:48:54] that here doesn't
[1:48:56] doesn't mean just to listen out of noise
[1:48:59] that here means to receive it
[1:49:02] hearing receiving acting hearing
[1:49:06] recognizing acting on the word of God
[1:49:09] here means to receive it who can receive
[1:49:12] my word amen he that hears it don't
[1:49:16] stand still and say oh nonsense them
[1:49:21] things there's nothing to it I don't
[1:49:23] believe that it's he that hears my word
[1:49:26] uh-huh that's the word of Jesus which he
[1:49:30] is the word there you are he's talking
[1:49:32] to an old man in his 90s
[1:49:34] he says if you can hear my word and
[1:49:38] Believe on him that sent me he's passed
[1:49:40] from Death to life and shall not even
[1:49:42] come into the Judgment but has already
[1:49:44] passed from it amen I said How's your
[1:49:47] heart beaten right now
[1:49:50] that old man said I believe it I have
[1:49:53] heard it I have received it
[1:49:56] I said then according to the Head
[1:49:58] specialist the chief operator the chief
[1:50:00] doctor of eternal life says you've
[1:50:02] passed from Death to life and shall
[1:50:04] never come into the condemnation
[1:50:10] Psalms 14 Noah
[1:50:13] still good
[1:50:15] I'm moving along as quickly as I can
[1:50:19] Psalms 14 1 we're going to think about
[1:50:22] these philosophers
[1:50:24] the fool hath said in his heart
[1:50:27] there is no God
[1:50:31] they are corrupt
[1:50:33] they have done abominable work there is
[1:50:36] none that doeth good the Lord looked
[1:50:37] down from heaven upon the Children of
[1:50:39] Men
[1:50:40] to see if there was any that did
[1:50:42] understand and seek God
[1:50:45] they are all gone aside they are all
[1:50:48] together become filthy there is none
[1:50:50] that doeth good no not one
[1:50:54] have all the workers of iniquity no
[1:50:57] knowledge who eat up my people as they
[1:51:00] eat bread and call not upon the Lord
[1:51:04] they were
[1:51:06] there were they in great fear for God is
[1:51:10] in the generation of the righteous
[1:51:13] you have shamed the counsel of the poor
[1:51:15] because the Lord is his Refuge
[1:51:18] oh David says all that salvation of
[1:51:21] Israel would come out of Zion when the
[1:51:24] Lord bringeth the Captivity of his
[1:51:26] people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel
[1:51:29] shall be glad now this is part of the
[1:51:32] Kingdom prophecy this is you remember on
[1:51:34] the Mount of Olives when Jesus is about
[1:51:36] to ascend and they go up there and they
[1:51:39] say Lord will you now restore Israel
[1:51:41] okay okay we've really kind of messed it
[1:51:45] up we didn't realize you had to die okay
[1:51:46] we get it and I wrote to him as we
[1:51:48] understand you met us in the room you
[1:51:49] rebuke Thomas okay we've been by the
[1:51:51] seaside we know it's you okay okay okay
[1:51:53] okay okay we get it we got it now
[1:51:57] are you gonna restore Israel
[1:52:00] and Jesus says it's not even for you to
[1:52:02] know yeah don't even ask me that
[1:52:04] question
[1:52:05] said that that don't you worry David's
[1:52:08] prayer is going to come to pass
[1:52:09] see but first you're going to go into
[1:52:12] Jerusalem and Terry and wait to be
[1:52:14] endued with power because I got
[1:52:15] something for you to do see in other
[1:52:17] words Jesus is saying to them you're
[1:52:19] going to be a part of this prophecy
[1:52:22] you're going to help facilitate it how
[1:52:24] many want to help facilitate the word of
[1:52:25] God
[1:52:28] see the intent of Psalms 14.
[1:52:31] writes one uh commentator
[1:52:35] is to counter the Temptation so this is
[1:52:37] a real Temptation in humanity all right
[1:52:40] David writes Psalms 14 and and one
[1:52:43] commentator writes about how that this
[1:52:46] is to counter the Temptation that
[1:52:48] humankind and boy is this ever true that
[1:52:51] humankind you know can manage the world
[1:52:54] in ways better than Jehovah can mankind
[1:52:58] has thought that for Millennia and he's
[1:53:00] done nothing but but genocide and War
[1:53:03] and famine and pestilence and killing
[1:53:06] and cheating and stabbing and and all
[1:53:09] kinds of horrible things that human
[1:53:11] humans do to humans but he can run it
[1:53:14] better than God see
[1:53:16] so because the alternative as far as the
[1:53:19] ungodly are concerned here's what the
[1:53:21] ungodly want to do they they have it in
[1:53:23] their mind to reorder life
[1:53:26] now we've spent a little bit of time
[1:53:28] talking about what life is actually
[1:53:31] see and that that Revelation as I said
[1:53:34] is the greatest Revelation you could
[1:53:36] have because it shows you who you are
[1:53:37] and your position your place in the
[1:53:39] prophecy to bring God's kingdom to pass
[1:53:41] so you're here working with the Covenant
[1:53:43] angel
[1:53:44] you got me
[1:53:46] but man in his Fallen state is always
[1:53:48] wanting to reorder life see and David
[1:53:51] what David is guaranteeing that hey life
[1:53:54] will not be so easily reorganized as you
[1:53:57] think it will because God's purposes are
[1:53:59] not going to be undone
[1:54:01] and so you're kicking against the prince
[1:54:03] you're trying to reorder everything
[1:54:05] outside of the will of God it's not
[1:54:07] going to work stop drop and roll
[1:54:11] because you can't reorder God's purposes
[1:54:14] see God's will endures and so David says
[1:54:19] oh that the salvation of the Israel were
[1:54:22] come out of Zion when the Lord bringeth
[1:54:25] back the Captivity of his people Jacob
[1:54:28] here's the kingdom
[1:54:29] Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be
[1:54:33] glad so David yearn for the
[1:54:36] establishment of the Lord's Kingdom and
[1:54:38] that wasn't unusual the son of David had
[1:54:41] the same feeling and you can find it in
[1:54:43] Matthew 6 10 where he's in a prayer
[1:54:45] they're saying Lord teach us how to pray
[1:54:47] and one of the first things that he
[1:54:49] wants that that's a desire of his heart
[1:54:51] and he wants to project it into their
[1:54:53] hearts is to pray thy kingdom come
[1:54:57] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[1:55:00] heaven Jesus yearned for it too thy will
[1:55:03] be done in earth
[1:55:06] bring the Earth like the vision of
[1:55:08] Heaven Hallelujah
[1:55:11] thy kingdom come
[1:55:13] this is what we yearn for isn't it
[1:55:15] friends
[1:55:16] he taught us to pray there's nothing
[1:55:18] wrong with praying that thy kingdom come
[1:55:22] that's why revelation 22 20 he which
[1:55:25] testifyeth these things saith surely I
[1:55:29] come quickly John's response and our
[1:55:32] response is even so what he said even so
[1:55:36] come quickly Lord Jesus
[1:55:38] Hallelujah even so even so what come
[1:55:41] quickly Hallelujah Jesus and John and we
[1:55:44] say I say with David I say with Jesus I
[1:55:47] say with John even so come even so come
[1:55:51] Hallelujah
[1:55:53] the kingdom coming listen now
[1:55:56] I'm going to make my turn for home
[1:56:00] the kingdom coming
[1:56:02] is associated with
[1:56:05] restoration to perfection
[1:56:09] you're coming back to Genesis
[1:56:13] that's what everything has been about
[1:56:15] this long trajectory of Redemption all
[1:56:18] the way back it circles back around on
[1:56:20] itself and brings the last day bride
[1:56:22] back to where the fall to set the
[1:56:25] kingdom in its rightly positioned that
[1:56:28] fell by sin in the garden to bring the
[1:56:31] kingdom to restore the kingdom that's
[1:56:34] you and me to its rightly positioned
[1:56:37] see
[1:56:39] and so watch what he says so so so so so
[1:56:41] now
[1:56:43] in order to do that listen to this
[1:56:46] statement
[1:56:46] in order to do that
[1:56:50] in order to bring restoration back to
[1:56:53] Perfection
[1:56:55] this would require
[1:56:58] the total
[1:57:00] complete
[1:57:01] annihilation of anything against them
[1:57:08] he could never
[1:57:10] get Genesis back until he first come as
[1:57:14] a covenant angel in this day and
[1:57:16] dismissed every weakness and failure and
[1:57:19] doubt and anything that's against you is
[1:57:22] completely struck off by your faith in
[1:57:26] the bleeding word
[1:57:30] that's why the Covenant Angel descended
[1:57:32] in Revelation 10. he's coming to to make
[1:57:35] Redemption claims
[1:57:38] it's amazing he says in in Romans 11 26
[1:57:42] and 27 and so all Israel shall be saved
[1:57:45] that is it is written
[1:57:47] there shall come out of Zion that
[1:57:49] deliver and shall turn away ungodliness
[1:57:51] from Jacob for this is Catch it this is
[1:57:55] my Covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:57:59] away you reading that with me when I
[1:58:02] shall take away their sins you're in the
[1:58:06] hour where he's removing all claims of
[1:58:10] the enemy dismissing all charges
[1:58:12] canceling all evidence you're completely
[1:58:16] exonerated your whole entire record is
[1:58:18] expunged in the courtroom of heaven and
[1:58:21] can never be brought to bear against you
[1:58:23] again
[1:58:24] that's what this Covenant Angel come to
[1:58:27] establish the Kingdom Israel political
[1:58:30] longed for his kingdom too but in the
[1:58:31] very end you know the problem that you
[1:58:34] know what the problem political Israel
[1:58:35] had is their view of the kingdom and how
[1:58:37] it was going to be ordered was different
[1:58:39] than when Jesus come to order because
[1:58:42] when he came he told them that that
[1:58:44] unless they actually came by the water
[1:58:46] and the spirit they could never enter
[1:58:47] into his kingdom
[1:58:49] he told them they had to be born again
[1:58:52] now that was a problem for them because
[1:58:55] if that were to happen then that would
[1:58:57] undermine their lofty position among the
[1:58:59] people
[1:59:00] you understand because because they love
[1:59:03] their power and they loved their seat of
[1:59:05] authority they loved wearing long robes
[1:59:07] and praying long prayers in public and
[1:59:09] being called Rabbi they were so opposed
[1:59:12] to his system that they crucified him
[1:59:17] they even introduced false Witnesses
[1:59:19] into his trial I'm here to tell you that
[1:59:22] spirit is still alive today
[1:59:26] it's still alive today they're still
[1:59:28] crucifying the word with false Witnesses
[1:59:31] that was political Israel that was
[1:59:34] denominational Judaism you see why we
[1:59:36] flee denominationalism
[1:59:39] you see why the mark of the beast says
[1:59:41] it leads you to the mark of the beast
[1:59:42] the The Book of Revelation says it leads
[1:59:44] you to the mark of the beast
[1:59:46] see that was political Israel that was
[1:59:48] denominational Judah they Judaism they
[1:59:50] hated him organized religion always does
[1:59:53] see but spiritual Israel
[1:59:57] she's loved him for two thousand years
[2:00:00] how many spiritual Israelites we got in
[2:00:02] here today
[2:00:03] she's loved him for two thousand years
[2:00:05] I'm gonna tell you something friends
[2:00:07] Paul promised a great reward for those
[2:00:09] who love his appearing
[2:00:11] and when he appeared I fell in love oh
[2:00:14] my I look around and organize religion I
[2:00:17] say nothing doing that ain't for me I
[2:00:20] want the real thing I don't want
[2:00:22] dehydrated Christianity Just Add Water
[2:00:24] no sir I want the real thing Hallelujah
[2:00:28] and now all the 144 000 are filling the
[2:00:31] pool do you understand that they're
[2:00:33] calling for his return and we're calling
[2:00:35] for his return come Lord Jesus
[2:00:37] Hallelujah bring on your kingdom because
[2:00:40] the kingdom as I've said is associated
[2:00:43] with restoration to Perfection and this
[2:00:45] would require the total knowledge of
[2:00:47] anything against its family I find
[2:00:52] myself
[2:00:55] longing for that
[2:00:58] more than streets of gold
[2:01:02] I find myself
[2:01:04] wanting Purity perfect Flawless purity
[2:01:09] and everything I do and everything I
[2:01:13] think and everything I say every purpose
[2:01:16] I have I want streets of gold are fine
[2:01:20] I'll love them when I get there see my
[2:01:22] reflection in perfect gold but I'm here
[2:01:25] to tell you something friends I want a
[2:01:27] purity of life I want a purity of mine
[2:01:30] that's how I know that I've loved his
[2:01:32] appearing because that's what his
[2:01:34] appearing came to do was to give you
[2:01:36] that
[2:01:38] Zephaniah look at this Kingdom prophecy
[2:01:40] chapter 3 verses 14 to 16 see this is
[2:01:44] the this is the kingdom restored sing O
[2:01:47] Daughter of Zion now Zion in the Bible
[2:01:49] is always the bride
[2:01:51] you know that yeah Prophet Thomas that's
[2:01:53] always the bride sing Old Daughter of
[2:01:56] Zion
[2:01:57] shout o Israel be glad and rejoice with
[2:02:01] all the heart
[2:02:03] oh daughter of Jerusalem the Lord hath
[2:02:06] taken away thy judgments he hath cast
[2:02:09] out thine enemy the king of Israel even
[2:02:12] the Lord is in the midst of thee Thou
[2:02:14] shalt not see evil any more his coming
[2:02:19] was always about establishing a kingdom
[2:02:23] of saints in the earth that's what the
[2:02:27] Book of Genesis was all about that's
[2:02:29] what the Garden of Eden
[2:02:31] was all about see and that's what he but
[2:02:35] but you know what happened sin entered
[2:02:38] and man fell
[2:02:40] so the kingdom returns for the purpose
[2:02:43] of establishing the Millennium but first
[2:02:46] it must deal with sin
[2:02:49] it's got to deal that's why when the
[2:02:51] seventh seal opened and the prophet says
[2:02:53] the kingdom is coming as it had been the
[2:02:56] the sin question what's being settled
[2:02:58] forever a bride was being re recreated
[2:03:02] back to her virgin condition that's what
[2:03:05] I'm trying to get you to understand
[2:03:06] today you're under the Covenant this is
[2:03:08] a modern event made clear in Prophecy
[2:03:10] you're being recreated back to your
[2:03:13] virgin condition
[2:03:16] he says here in the future home
[2:03:21] 16 minutes
[2:03:24] I'll stop
[2:03:26] 16 minutes I'll stop
[2:03:28] future home listen now
[2:03:32] see
[2:03:34] you were made for an eternal purpose
[2:03:36] did you know that
[2:03:38] I don't care what you feel like I don't
[2:03:41] care what's happened to you
[2:03:42] I'm talking about what you're made for
[2:03:44] and he's restoring what you were made
[2:03:47] for
[2:03:48] you were made for an eternal purpose
[2:03:50] because you was in the manifestation of
[2:03:51] an act you was the manifestation of an
[2:03:54] attribute that was in God that thought
[2:03:56] of you expressed you and he made an
[2:03:58] earth to take you out of and to make you
[2:04:00] a human being not easy not simple
[2:04:04] well
[2:04:05] he says sin come along and perverted his
[2:04:09] way
[2:04:10] you come anyhow
[2:04:12] see nature just kept working
[2:04:15] parents kept procreating you come anyhow
[2:04:18] see you come anyhow but you was lost
[2:04:21] with the world so he come and redeemed
[2:04:25] you the express attribute and also
[2:04:28] redeems this Earth by the same way then
[2:04:30] his purpose rolls on
[2:04:33] all see friends sin marred his picture
[2:04:36] but not his plan
[2:04:38] sin I've been marred plenty of times but
[2:04:40] his plan is still rolling and I'm still
[2:04:43] a part of it nothing could stop him from
[2:04:47] redeeming me I wish today you could just
[2:04:50] raise up your hands and let the devil
[2:04:52] hear it there's nothing that could stop
[2:04:54] him from redeeming me
[2:04:56] there was nothing that could stop him
[2:04:59] from redeeming me
[2:05:01] nothing at all
[2:05:04] when you look in the Book of Micah
[2:05:07] we're not going to turn to it Noah but
[2:05:09] you can go home and read it in chapter 7
[2:05:10] 18 to 20. there's that's actually the
[2:05:14] passage that contains the idea of a sea
[2:05:17] of forgetfulness
[2:05:18] that's the root that's the root Old
[2:05:20] Testament shadow where brother Brandon
[2:05:23] would talk about a sea of God's
[2:05:24] forgetfulness a sea of God's
[2:05:26] forgetfulness
[2:05:27] and he goes he goes I'm gonna I'm gonna
[2:05:29] cut to the chase here
[2:05:31] so he said I I I have other quotes but
[2:05:34] I'm not not going to read I'm going to
[2:05:35] try to read get down to that very last
[2:05:36] one uh that we're going to read and then
[2:05:38] we're going to let you go
[2:05:41] so he starts talking about the Sea of
[2:05:43] God's forgetfulness and about the Zoe
[2:05:46] life that's in you and it's a part you
[2:05:48] he kept saying it you're part of God we
[2:05:51] become a part of God things that are to
[2:05:53] be saying on the same thing see just
[2:05:55] like Adam and Eve worked and lived and
[2:05:57] eaten enjoyed in the Garden of Eden
[2:05:58] before sin came in we're on our road
[2:06:00] right back there again see the first
[2:06:03] Adam through sin taking us out the
[2:06:05] second Adam through righteous brings us
[2:06:06] back in again justifies us brings us
[2:06:08] back in he says in Investments now uh
[2:06:11] watch this let me see if that's the one
[2:06:13] I have
[2:06:14] um yes it is Noah let's go back and I'm
[2:06:16] going to read these somewhere and this
[2:06:18] is where we're going to stop
[2:06:19] watch
[2:06:21] um I got one before that
[2:06:23] yeah notice
[2:06:26] notice
[2:06:27] when this
[2:06:29] your sins are confessed
[2:06:31] and your sins are dropped into the
[2:06:33] bleach of the blood of the son of God
[2:06:36] it remits sin so much
[2:06:39] that it puts it in the sea of God's
[2:06:42] forgetfulness
[2:06:43] and can never be remembered in his sight
[2:06:47] anymore
[2:06:49] then what that does that does that make
[2:06:54] a man a Son of God what does it make a
[2:06:57] man a Son of God God never remembers you
[2:07:01] to be a sinner
[2:07:04] man
[2:07:05] God never remembers you to be a sinner
[2:07:10] you're a son you're a daughter there's
[2:07:13] no more remembrance of sin at all
[2:07:16] everybody say at all
[2:07:19] next one Noah last slide there's no more
[2:07:22] remembrance of it at all God puts it in
[2:07:25] the sea of forgetfulness the bleach the
[2:07:28] sea of forgetfulness is Christ's blood
[2:07:31] that was shed for you and therefore then
[2:07:34] you and God are Father and Son by Jesus
[2:07:37] Christ's Grace not by anything you've
[2:07:41] done but by his grace you are Sons and
[2:07:44] Daughters of God and a partaker of His
[2:07:47] blessings and of his power and of his
[2:07:49] life his life is in you for you are a
[2:07:53] son of God so all of my sins that's it
[2:07:55] does that's it all of my sins are cast
[2:07:59] into the sea of God's forgetfulness
[2:08:03] it's amazing I was telling you I think
[2:08:06] Wednesday that most theologians think
[2:08:08] that it's not that God forgets it
[2:08:11] because God can't lose anything that's
[2:08:13] their reasoning
[2:08:15] says but what it what it is is God just
[2:08:17] chooses not to for not to remember but
[2:08:20] when you go back and read Mike Micah you
[2:08:22] don't find it that way when you come and
[2:08:24] read a prophet that's not how you find
[2:08:26] it when we read our scriptures in in
[2:08:28] Zephaniah when we read it these other
[2:08:30] places you find that he's taking away
[2:08:33] all the evil all the sin it's gone it's
[2:08:36] not put in a in a in a locked box it's
[2:08:39] gone
[2:08:40] the only one that can annihilate
[2:08:41] anything is the creator he can uncreate
[2:08:44] it Hallelujah one of these days going to
[2:08:46] uncreate the devil
[2:08:48] I'm so glad
[2:08:49] see so all my sins are cast in The Sea
[2:08:53] of God's forgetfulness now it's not a
[2:08:54] place you can go visit
[2:08:57] if you could I'll post a sign there no
[2:09:00] fishing
[2:09:03] but it's not a place you can go visit
[2:09:05] there's no GPS coordinate
[2:09:08] theologians don't believe that God
[2:09:10] forgets my sin see they just believe he
[2:09:12] chooses not to remember it but if that
[2:09:14] was the case then my sin would still
[2:09:18] exist
[2:09:20] and eventually somebody's got to pay for
[2:09:22] it
[2:09:24] but he doesn't just put it in a locked
[2:09:26] box somewhere I'm here to tell you
[2:09:28] something friends the Sea of God's
[2:09:29] forgetfulness is a sea of non-existence
[2:09:32] you just believe it that way the Sea of
[2:09:34] God forgives not a GPS location not a
[2:09:36] place you can go visit it's a sea of
[2:09:38] God's forget it's for God's forgiveness
[2:09:40] it's a sea of non-existence everything
[2:09:43] that's in it doesn't exist oh my
[2:09:47] Hallelujah I'm here to tell you there
[2:09:49] there might be Multiverse they talk
[2:09:51] about Multiverse all the time if there's
[2:09:53] a Multiverse it has had it's had many
[2:09:55] versions of my life that don't exist
[2:09:57] anymore
[2:09:58] Hallelujah I don't know what all is out
[2:10:01] there but I know if it exists it's got
[2:10:03] versions of my life that don't exist
[2:10:05] anymore why because they're all now in
[2:10:08] the sea of non-existent
[2:10:12] glory to God all right now I have a
[2:10:16] better understanding now I have a better
[2:10:19] understanding or at least a greater
[2:10:22] appreciation for a prophet saying one
[2:10:25] day
[2:10:26] when our flesh changes
[2:10:29] that word and he will become what we had
[2:10:34] never dreamed possible
[2:10:37] I'm part of that word
[2:10:39] I'm part of he I'm in that he in that
[2:10:42] word just like the kingdoms of this
[2:10:43] world are become the kingdoms of our
[2:10:45] Lord and of his Christ it's Christ and
[2:10:47] his bride
[2:10:48] he where when our flesh changes that
[2:10:52] word and he will become what we never
[2:10:54] dreamed possible the king and queen will
[2:10:56] be what we never dreamed possible you
[2:10:58] listen friends I'll stand there on that
[2:11:00] day and I'll realize I was talking to
[2:11:02] you earlier about thoughts on the other
[2:11:03] side
[2:11:05] I'm going to realize that what I have
[2:11:07] become on the other side
[2:11:09] is something I never dreamed possible
[2:11:14] that's where you are today friends that
[2:11:17] is modern events make of 2022 made clear
