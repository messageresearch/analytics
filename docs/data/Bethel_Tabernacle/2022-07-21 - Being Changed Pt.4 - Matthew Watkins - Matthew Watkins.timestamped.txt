[41:53] the
[41:54] same
[41:55] [Music]
[41:58] there's only
[42:02] one way
[42:04] to touch him
[42:08] just believe
[42:11] when you call on
[42:14] his name
[42:19] amen do you want to touch him tonight
[42:21] god bless you good to be here in the
[42:22] house of the lord if you have your bible
[42:24] let's turn to romans chapter seven
[42:26] amen romans chapter seven
[42:30] we're just going to read on just a few
[42:32] verses from here we spoke
[42:35] this message being changed in three
[42:37] parts and we just want to take another
[42:40] part to that here tonight romans chapter
[42:42] 7
[42:44] you love the lord
[42:45] amen appreciate his presence amen being
[42:48] here with us
[42:50] amen he never fails to show up
[42:52] amen we're glad for that
[42:55] let's just begin reading here at verse
[42:56] 14. for we know that the law is
[42:59] spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin
[43:03] for that which i do i allow not
[43:07] for what i would that do i not
[43:09] what i hate that do i if then i do that
[43:13] which i would not i can send to the law
[43:16] that it is good
[43:17] now there is no more i that do it but
[43:20] sin that dwelleth in me for that for i
[43:22] know
[43:23] that in me
[43:25] now we took time the last time and i'm
[43:27] just going to pause here just for a
[43:28] moment because i just want to bring you
[43:30] right up to where i'm at here tonight
[43:33] i want you to notice that when paul uses
[43:35] this word and he says
[43:37] for i know let's read it there in the
[43:38] beginning for i know
[43:40] that in me
[43:42] so
[43:43] there's a distinction that paul makes
[43:45] here and they put it in the parentheses
[43:46] in the king james that is
[43:48] in my flesh
[43:50] so what you're finding out here in
[43:51] romans 7 is that there's more to me than
[43:55] just this
[43:57] right
[43:58] there's more to me there's more to you
[44:00] than just what you see in the mirror
[44:02] but there's another part of you and
[44:05] that's what we're gonna speak on here
[44:06] tonight we're just going to take this
[44:08] title being changed this will be part 4.
[44:11] let's keep reading for i know that in me
[44:14] that is in my flesh
[44:16] dwelleth
[44:17] no good thing how many can identify
[44:20] for to will is present with me but how
[44:23] to perform that
[44:25] which is good i find not for the good
[44:27] that i would i do not but the evil which
[44:30] i would not that i do
[44:32] let's just move on down to verse 21.
[44:35] i find then a law
[44:38] that when i would do good evil is
[44:41] present with me
[44:42] for i delight now here's i speaking
[44:45] about me i myself me who am i
[44:48] and now he's going to switch to another
[44:50] part of me
[44:52] for i delight in the in the law of god
[44:56] after now this isn't the flesh
[44:58] after the inward man
[45:01] so he says in verse 23 but i see another
[45:04] law in my members
[45:07] warring against the law of my mind and
[45:10] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[45:13] sin which is in my
[45:15] members
[45:16] lord we ask for your grace tonight
[45:18] special lord request here tonight father
[45:21] i ask that for
[45:23] lord for me to be able to completely
[45:25] surrender lord just to move myself out
[45:28] of the way believing lord god that you
[45:31] ordain
[45:32] church service lord and you would ordain
[45:34] the people that would be here tonight
[45:36] lord by divine appointment that's what
[45:38] we believe here tonight lord
[45:40] that god you have something you have
[45:42] something lord upon
[45:44] your mind that you want to speak to your
[45:46] children i pray god that you would help
[45:48] every individual those streaming those
[45:50] that are here present lord may we be
[45:52] sensitive to your voice as it speaks to
[45:54] your children we pray in jesus name
[45:57] amen you can be seated the first
[45:59] powerpoint i sent brother jason i sent
[46:01] the last one being changed part one i
[46:04] just want to pull that up and i want you
[46:06] just to read because i i just feel like
[46:08] it's relevant to read this again i know
[46:10] we read it one time but i just want to
[46:12] read this again and i just believe we
[46:14] can garner and gather so much on this
[46:16] you really could preach this uh in many
[46:19] many more parts brother branham is asked
[46:21] in 1964 and questions and answers he's
[46:24] asked about this romans 7. if you'll
[46:26] notice
[46:27] uh he relays the entire question of what
[46:30] we did the text we just read and then at
[46:32] the very end you'll see at the bottom
[46:34] his question this
[46:37] i cannot understand as brother branham
[46:39] answers that he says let me kind of
[46:41] polish it up so you can see
[46:43] he said in me is two persons right
[46:48] one wants me to do wrong the other wants
[46:51] me to do and brother branham is going to
[46:53] say right and every time i start to do
[46:56] right then the wrong
[46:58] hinders me
[46:59] how many of you people on the interviews
[47:01] this afternoon has run that same thing
[47:05] and this morning i thought it was
[47:07] incredible because you never know really
[47:09] what's in those private interviews
[47:11] because they're private but brother
[47:12] burnham gives us some insight and says
[47:14] this same question has came up in the
[47:18] interviews you're coming to me how many
[47:20] of you people have asked the same
[47:22] question brother adam's referring to
[47:24] romans 7 that when i want to do good
[47:27] though i know that i'm born of the
[47:29] spirit of god i know i've passed from
[47:31] death unto life i know that there's been
[47:33] a change inside of me yet still
[47:37] i find myself that i'm still in a
[47:40] struggle
[47:41] sometimes
[47:43] to do that which the word says for me to
[47:45] do
[47:49] how many angel wings you want to you
[47:51] want to take off those angel wings and
[47:52] halos and throw them outside
[47:55] brother branham says this is this is the
[47:56] struggle this is the battle you were
[47:58] questioning this in the private
[48:00] interviews you were asking the same
[48:02] exact question uh why i why i know that
[48:05] i'm born of the spirit of god yet i
[48:07] still have struggles in my flesh and so
[48:10] brother adam says you've run into that
[48:11] same thing this morning see
[48:14] we are carnal and that part must perish
[48:18] and then
[48:19] inside
[48:20] we are
[48:21] a spirit man
[48:23] soul inside and that's faith in god's
[48:26] word then
[48:28] we bring our outside body how many has
[48:31] an outside body
[48:34] we bring our outside body oh you mean
[48:37] you didn't lose that outside body when
[48:38] you were born of the spirit
[48:41] y'all are here none of y'all are angels
[48:43] here tonight you're not in hearing
[48:45] theophanies are you am i speaking to the
[48:47] real you but you're born again yet
[48:49] you've received the baptism of the holy
[48:51] ghost but you still have an outside body
[48:55] and he says then we bring our outside
[48:57] body under subjection to the word by
[49:01] faith here's how
[49:02] by accepting what god said
[49:06] how brother matt do i overcome how do i
[49:09] bring this body under subjection to the
[49:11] word by faith
[49:12] except what god said
[49:15] what is saying amen to the word it's not
[49:17] a verbal amen it's it's something that
[49:19] you do with your life your life is amen
[49:22] in the word
[49:23] mary amen the word and it produced
[49:25] something inside of her
[49:27] right
[49:28] how can i take a cockapoo now he goes to
[49:30] this cocklebur and and he's going to use
[49:32] this example and he says and make a
[49:35] grain of wheat i have a cockle burn a
[49:36] grain of wheat how am i ever going to
[49:37] make it into a grain of wheat it's
[49:39] impossible for me to do it the only way
[49:41] it can be is because inside that
[49:44] cocklebur has been transmitted from a
[49:47] cocklebur wheat a cocklebur
[49:50] to a germ called wheat life then you
[49:52] bury that cocklebur
[49:54] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[49:56] that's right
[49:57] because there has been a life of wheat
[49:59] put into the cockapoo and the life of
[50:02] the cockleboro has been taken out
[50:05] but the nature of the cocklebur is still
[50:09] sticky
[50:11] so what happens when you're born of the
[50:13] spirit of god now this is not something
[50:15] an anointing it's not it's more than an
[50:18] anointing of the spirit on your flesh
[50:20] brother adam says i'm afraid we've
[50:22] replaced the true baptism of the holy
[50:25] ghost with an intellectual experience of
[50:28] just accepting the word and you accept
[50:31] the word intellectually in your mind and
[50:33] that's a good thing you believe it with
[50:35] your mind there's many people who
[50:37] believe and are believers of the word of
[50:40] god but that doesn't mean that they're
[50:41] born of the spirit of god you say how
[50:43] can you say about that brother matt well
[50:45] let's go to the book of james you
[50:47] believe in god you do well for the devil
[50:50] and his angels also believe in god yet
[50:54] they're not born of the spirit of god so
[50:56] many people brother madam says they've
[50:57] replaced the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:59] the true baptism for an intellectual
[51:02] understanding or an intellectual
[51:05] reasoning i think that sounds good so i
[51:08] accept it so there's a part of them
[51:09] that's been changed but the soul the
[51:11] nature has never been changed
[51:14] and then he comes comes into another
[51:16] place and brother branham says and i'm
[51:17] afraid they've replaced the baptism of
[51:20] the holy ghost with some emotion
[51:23] and he says and because they think
[51:25] because they can shout that they've been
[51:26] born again or they think because they've
[51:29] danced or done some outwardly fleshly
[51:31] emotion that they've been born again and
[51:33] then brother branham says that and i'm
[51:35] not gonna this is an exact quote i'm
[51:37] just uh paraphrasing it but he says but
[51:41] when when do you brother adam says when
[51:42] do you know that something has really
[51:44] came when your life is divvying up with
[51:47] the bible
[51:48] when your life is producing something
[51:50] when your nature has changed from an old
[51:53] carnal snake to the nature of a dove
[51:57] because that's the nature of the spirit
[51:59] right
[52:00] and he says he says
[52:02] let's just go back to this because
[52:03] there's been a life we've put in the
[52:04] cockroach the life of the cockroach has
[52:05] been taken out but the nature of the
[52:07] cocklebur is still sticky
[52:10] and it will be
[52:12] until this new life
[52:15] has been
[52:16] fully been developed all right
[52:19] so what do we find out about the baptism
[52:22] of the holy ghost the true baptism of
[52:24] the holy ghost this is going to be a
[52:25] paradoxical statement the baptism of the
[52:29] holy ghost changes
[52:30] everything right
[52:33] but yet it doesn't change everything
[52:38] the baptism of the whole are you awake
[52:39] here tonight
[52:41] the but the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:43] changes everything but yet it doesn't
[52:46] change everything
[52:47] say how can you say that brother matt
[52:49] because it will eventually change
[52:52] everything
[52:55] but right now there's still a part of
[52:56] you it hasn't changed yet you've got a
[52:59] deposit of the holy ghost you've got a
[53:01] down payment it's the earnest but one
[53:04] day you're going to get the more than
[53:05] just the earnest you're going to get
[53:07] full payment
[53:10] and when you get full payment you say
[53:11] brother matt when will this go away
[53:13] brother madam's notice here he says that
[53:15] the nature of the cocker bar is still
[53:16] sticky and it will be until this new
[53:19] life has fully been developed out of the
[53:23] grant out of the ground and raised up
[53:25] again when it comes forth then it's no
[53:27] more cuckleburg
[53:29] but wheat but while it's here on earth
[53:32] how many are still here on earth
[53:36] unfortunately
[53:37] you might be caught away in heavenly
[53:39] places and that's a wonderful thing but
[53:41] sometimes it takes the life to bring you
[53:44] back to reality to make you realize
[53:46] you're still here
[53:49] and he says but while it's here on earth
[53:52] out of the earth and a cocklebur it's
[53:54] still sticky but it's got the nature of
[53:57] the inside of it of wheat
[54:01] that's why paul said i desire after law
[54:03] i i long for the word of god for the law
[54:06] of god after the inward
[54:08] man and as long notice and as long as
[54:12] you're in
[54:14] this
[54:15] life
[54:16] how many still in this life
[54:18] say brother matt why do you keep saying
[54:20] that because i want to take away the
[54:21] devil's
[54:23] on your mind and your body here tonight
[54:26] of how can i i don't even know sometimes
[54:28] i feel like i'm i'm i i'm completely set
[54:31] free other times i'm questioning have i
[54:33] ever even known the lord at all i can
[54:36] get to such a high and then such a low
[54:38] and i could come crashing down and then
[54:40] question myself and the devil begins to
[54:42] bombard my mind he begins to attack me
[54:44] and influence my spirit gets me
[54:46] depressed and down and i'm i'm wondering
[54:48] whether i'm saved or i'm not saved am i
[54:50] in or on my out but god's word is here
[54:53] to set you free from any oppressive
[54:55] spirit
[54:57] and help you understand yourself that
[54:59] there's still a part of you that's still
[55:01] here in the earth
[55:03] say brother matt when will it go away
[55:05] when you turn 18
[55:08] for the second time for the second time
[55:10] it'll be gone hallelujah
[55:13] hallelujah i'm looking forward to
[55:15] turning 18 a second time some of you say
[55:18] brother might have not even turned 18
[55:19] yet you're going to one day
[55:23] he says but on the notice this as long
[55:25] as you're in this life you're going to
[55:26] be sticky
[55:28] and have a carnal nature that's going to
[55:31] bother you
[55:33] now if it doesn't bother you that's a
[55:35] problem that's right
[55:37] hello everybody here you wait if it
[55:39] doesn't bother you that's a problem if
[55:42] you're content
[55:43] with the sin in your flesh that means
[55:45] your net you've probably never tasted of
[55:48] the lord at all
[55:49] but if it's bothering you that's don't
[55:51] you realize if you're bothered here by
[55:53] your own mistakes and faults and
[55:55] failures it's proof god has changed
[55:57] something inside of you to put a desire
[56:00] to for something to reach for and say i
[56:02] may not be there yet as the woman said
[56:04] i'm not i may not be what i want to be
[56:06] but i know i'm not what i used to be
[56:10] notice as long as you live but the
[56:12] inside of you you're born again and when
[56:14] you're raised up you're in the likeness
[56:16] of christ and all the sin has gone from
[56:18] you see that's the thing
[56:21] something this is brother brandon begins
[56:22] to tell actually let's pause that just
[56:24] for a moment so notice here go to the
[56:26] second powerpoint that you could brother
[56:28] jason the one the second one that i sent
[56:30] you should have an uh the first one it
[56:32] was the first one that i sent but it's
[56:34] the second one that i need
[56:36] i want you to notice what the prophet
[56:37] says so he says you're you're made up
[56:40] of a triune being that's what the
[56:42] prophet teaches us over and over again
[56:44] that's why paul says oh wretched man
[56:47] what was that wretched part of him that
[56:49] wretched part of him was that there was
[56:51] a part of him that loved the lord with
[56:53] all of his heart there but there was
[56:55] another dog and brother and later in
[56:57] that quote begins to talk about that the
[56:59] old indian chief and he says chief which
[57:01] one of them wins the fight whichever one
[57:03] she feeds the most and brother aaron
[57:05] says see there it's whichever one you
[57:07] cater to whichever one you cater to
[57:10] so he says you're you're made up of body
[57:13] soul and spirit there's three parts of
[57:16] you
[57:16] and there's a part of you that's
[57:18] completely set free from the curse
[57:21] and the dominion of sin i want to spawn
[57:24] i just want to stop here for a moment
[57:25] and say this
[57:27] there's a part of you remember brother
[57:28] madam says there's two persons
[57:31] there's two lives two distinct
[57:34] lives that are at war
[57:36] all the time
[57:38] they're constantly pressuring you i i
[57:40] spoke of this sunday when we when we did
[57:42] sunday school and brother branham's
[57:44] telling and he's expressing in one place
[57:46] in his life of how that he gave his
[57:48] heart to the lord and he said i begin to
[57:50] serve the lord and he says but you know
[57:52] i should i ought to have served the lord
[57:55] many years before i surrendered and he
[57:58] says but a spirit hung over my life that
[58:01] hindered me or prevented me
[58:04] so what do you take away from that
[58:06] that there was there's a spirit that is
[58:08] always a demonic influence that's always
[58:12] there trying to use your five senses
[58:15] trying to use doubt trying to use fear
[58:18] trying to use your senses of your spirit
[58:21] and he'll use whatever channel you
[58:23] surrender to him to to prevent you and
[58:26] hinder you from becoming influenced from
[58:29] the angelic inspiration and anointing
[58:32] that's trying to affect you and
[58:34] influence you so brother madam says i
[58:37] would have given my heart to the lord
[58:38] many years before and he says but a
[58:40] spirit hung over me
[58:42] so there was something that was there
[58:44] trying to hinder him to prevent him he's
[58:47] asking questions and answers and he's
[58:49] asked about guardian angels and the
[58:50] person asked the question do you believe
[58:52] in that or is that of myth or fairy tale
[58:54] and brother adam says absolutely it's
[58:56] true yes the angels of god encamp those
[58:59] or surround those that fear him right
[59:03] and he uses the example of the servant
[59:05] of elijah and he's he's surrounded
[59:07] they're surrounded by an entire army and
[59:10] the prophet praise and says lord open
[59:12] his eyes
[59:14] for they that be with us are more than
[59:17] they with them and the
[59:19] the lord opened the servant's eyes and
[59:21] he seen the hillsides were surrounded by
[59:25] angelic armies and angelic chariots and
[59:28] angelic horses and there were more of
[59:30] them than there were with the devil
[59:34] i want you to know no matter how
[59:36] surrounded you may feel in your life and
[59:39] no matter how outnumbered the devil
[59:41] tries to tell you that you are there are
[59:43] more with you
[59:45] than with the devil
[59:48] there are more with the family of god
[59:50] that's why the the bible speaks of the
[59:53] god of angel armies the lord of hosts
[59:55] that is the translation of lord of hosts
[59:58] mighty in battle psalms 46 he breaketh
[1:00:01] the bow he burns the chariot with fire
[1:00:04] he's the lord of hosts david begins to
[1:00:06] sing psalms 46 and he says for the lord
[1:00:09] is an ever-present help in the time of
[1:00:12] trouble he's the lord of hosts in other
[1:00:14] words to the family of god he's always
[1:00:17] accessible he's always available he no
[1:00:21] matter how where how low or whatever
[1:00:23] place you go
[1:00:25] the bible says the lord is an
[1:00:27] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[1:00:30] what does that mean let me remind you of
[1:00:32] what you have available to you the lord
[1:00:34] is available to you
[1:00:36] any time
[1:00:39] the lord is available to the family of
[1:00:41] god in distress
[1:00:43] at the moment you say how how do i how
[1:00:45] do i call him how do i how do i
[1:00:48] make use of that just open your mouth
[1:00:50] and begin to call on the name of the
[1:00:51] lord
[1:00:53] he's right there
[1:00:55] he's an ever present help in the time of
[1:00:58] trouble
[1:00:59] he maketh words to cease if you go read
[1:01:01] psalms 46 just a powerful psalm but
[1:01:04] brother adam says there was a spirit
[1:01:06] there and he says of course guardian
[1:01:08] angels are real so what do you find
[1:01:11] there's a spirit that's hanging over the
[1:01:13] prophet preventing him from surrendering
[1:01:16] his life to the lord and he goes years
[1:01:19] beyond when he would have but something
[1:01:21] hung over him
[1:01:24] you say brother matt does that what does
[1:01:26] that mean that means that there's always
[1:01:28] in your life you're always caught in
[1:01:31] between
[1:01:32] two influences
[1:01:35] you're always being whispered to in one
[1:01:37] ear by the enemy and you're always being
[1:01:40] encouraged in one ear by the lord
[1:01:43] you're always being encouraged you're
[1:01:46] always being strengthened god's always
[1:01:48] trying to reach you he's always reaching
[1:01:50] out to you and at the same time the
[1:01:53] devil's always always there trying to
[1:01:55] fight you and trying to discourage you
[1:01:58] listen to me friends it is you are in a
[1:02:01] spiritual warfare that is not a battle
[1:02:04] of flesh and blood but the apostle paul
[1:02:07] in ephesians 6 says it's a spiritual
[1:02:10] battle that the weapons uh that the the
[1:02:13] the the battle that we face is not a
[1:02:15] against flesh and blood but spiritual
[1:02:18] wickedness in high places
[1:02:21] that word high places speaks of
[1:02:23] atmospheres demonic atmospheres and
[1:02:26] angelic atmospheres
[1:02:28] and you're subjected in a body that's
[1:02:31] not it's born of the spirit of god but
[1:02:34] you still got five senses you still got
[1:02:36] five senses of the flesh that can tempt
[1:02:39] you and tell you wrong and lead you
[1:02:40] wrong and direct you wrong you've got
[1:02:43] five senses in your spirit that'll try
[1:02:45] to lie to you using your memory and a
[1:02:47] lot of you using an imagination it'll
[1:02:49] lie to you using your affection your
[1:02:52] conscience
[1:02:54] but then you've got a man down in the in
[1:02:56] the control room
[1:02:58] of the heart brother branham says now
[1:03:00] that man in that control room pushes the
[1:03:02] buttons and pulls the levers
[1:03:04] if you'll surrender to him if you'll
[1:03:06] clean out the channels and let the come
[1:03:09] under the influence of the angels
[1:03:12] and not the spirits you'll find more
[1:03:15] victory in your life
[1:03:17] it's not that you're not born of the
[1:03:19] spirit of god and that's what the devil
[1:03:21] will try to tell you
[1:03:23] it's not that you're not born again now
[1:03:25] i'm speaking to believers here
[1:03:27] it's not that you're not that you're not
[1:03:29] filled with the holy ghost
[1:03:31] it's that those channels of that part of
[1:03:33] you that's not been changed yet
[1:03:36] but it's being changed
[1:03:40] you see as a believer you're being
[1:03:43] changed
[1:03:45] you're in the process of being changed
[1:03:49] one day there will come a final change
[1:03:51] and everything changes
[1:03:54] but right now you're renewed the bible
[1:03:56] says the
[1:03:57] that you're you're renewed day by day
[1:04:00] right
[1:04:02] that the spirit of god is there to
[1:04:04] encourage you that's what the preaching
[1:04:05] of the word of god is for
[1:04:07] that's what prayer is for that's what
[1:04:10] reading your bible is for that's why
[1:04:12] hearing god's the voice of god's prophet
[1:04:14] in your ear
[1:04:16] say why in your ear because you got
[1:04:17] enough trash from the devil coming into
[1:04:20] your ear also you better be hearing the
[1:04:22] voice of god and feeding on it and
[1:04:24] filling your vessel up with it as much
[1:04:26] as you can
[1:04:29] say well we don't need tapes we need
[1:04:31] tapes we don't need preachers we need
[1:04:33] preachers
[1:04:34] we don't need church we need church we
[1:04:36] can just play homes that play play tapes
[1:04:38] at home you're right you should be
[1:04:40] playing tapes at home
[1:04:42] we don't need church yeah we need church
[1:04:44] we don't need evangelists we need them
[1:04:45] we don't need teachers we need them we
[1:04:47] don't need preachers we need them listen
[1:04:50] you need everything
[1:04:51] let me just say this we need everything
[1:04:54] that god has made available
[1:04:56] you need to draw from every resource
[1:05:00] i don't need my brothers and my sisters
[1:05:02] i can just stay at home and stream you
[1:05:03] need them
[1:05:04] i don't need fellowship i'm just a quiet
[1:05:07] individual and i just would rather just
[1:05:09] be to myself and come to church that's a
[1:05:11] devil lying to you you need a local body
[1:05:14] that you connect with
[1:05:16] i may not be getting a lot of amen but
[1:05:18] that's not going to stop me here tonight
[1:05:21] the lord's given me my commission
[1:05:23] you you i don't i don't need to really
[1:05:25] come to church you need church
[1:05:28] you need the connection that god's given
[1:05:31] you you need to make you need to avail
[1:05:33] yourself of every weapon that god has
[1:05:36] put in your arsenal
[1:05:39] brother adam you go type in the quote
[1:05:41] the greatest weapon that god ever gave
[1:05:43] to man you know what you'll find one
[1:05:45] weapon is prayer one weapon the greatest
[1:05:47] weapon brother adam says his prayer
[1:05:49] brother brown says the greatest weapon
[1:05:50] is love
[1:05:52] another place he says the greatest
[1:05:53] weapon is faith
[1:05:54] what is the greatest weapon all of the
[1:05:56] weapons god has given his family
[1:06:00] but we've got to use them
[1:06:02] you've got to utilize them you can't
[1:06:04] they're not just going to fall on your
[1:06:06] lap they're not just going to fall out
[1:06:08] of the sky and i'm just going to go to
[1:06:09] church and and by osmosis it'll just
[1:06:12] change me no you've got to be dying out
[1:06:15] to the old man you've got to be
[1:06:17] constantly be re being filled and
[1:06:19] refilled and filled and refilled and
[1:06:23] filled and emptying out and then filling
[1:06:25] back in and emptying out and filling
[1:06:27] back in
[1:06:30] so there was a part of him he said that
[1:06:31] the angel he said uh the the angel of
[1:06:34] the lord and god surround those and camp
[1:06:36] those who fear him but then there was a
[1:06:38] spirit that was always trying to hinder
[1:06:40] him remember and we we spoke on this and
[1:06:43] brother adam teaches this doesn't say
[1:06:45] this directly he tells brother lonnie
[1:06:48] jenkins relays this story that he gives
[1:06:50] to a brother but the the essence of it
[1:06:53] is that when a person is not born of the
[1:06:55] spirit of god he says inside on the
[1:06:58] throne of the heart
[1:07:00] unconverted
[1:07:02] as an unconverted person
[1:07:04] on the throne of your heart is the devil
[1:07:09] the nature that you were born with
[1:07:11] not that you're a bad person but you are
[1:07:14] a bad person
[1:07:17] not that you're an evil person but you
[1:07:19] are an evil person
[1:07:21] as a and that didn't you didn't ask
[1:07:23] anybody for that you didn't didn't do
[1:07:25] anything the bible paul says the
[1:07:27] creature was made subject unto vanity
[1:07:30] not willingly
[1:07:31] but by reason of who whom created him
[1:07:34] the same in hope
[1:07:36] so he was subjected to it that's how he
[1:07:38] was made and he says i when you're born
[1:07:40] in the world you're unregenerate now you
[1:07:42] may have good parents and you may be
[1:07:44] raised in a good christian home that's
[1:07:46] wonderful
[1:07:47] but until that nature has changed until
[1:07:50] there's something an experience comes
[1:07:52] and changes and takes the snake out of
[1:07:55] your heart and puts in his spirit
[1:07:58] you're not even in the battle yet wow
[1:08:02] and brother madam says on the throne of
[1:08:03] that heart is the devil
[1:08:05] and he's uh as that spirit and he's
[1:08:07] calling he's the man in the control room
[1:08:09] he's pushing the buttons he's pulling
[1:08:11] the levers
[1:08:13] say how can a man go into a school and
[1:08:15] mow down children and take a gun because
[1:08:17] there's a demon spirit the world is in a
[1:08:20] neurotic state
[1:08:22] and that nature of that of that carnal
[1:08:24] nature of that fallen man is a beast
[1:08:27] he's a brute beast that's what the bible
[1:08:29] calls him
[1:08:31] and so the man pulling the levers and
[1:08:33] pushing the buttons he surrendered so
[1:08:36] much to that spirit that's within him
[1:08:38] and brother madam says but what happens
[1:08:40] when you're born of the spirit of god
[1:08:42] that man is removed from the throne
[1:08:44] that's that evil nature is removed from
[1:08:47] the throne of the heart and now christ
[1:08:49] is on the
[1:08:50] throne and he says and and the the way
[1:08:53] that he relays it is in that in the the
[1:08:55] testimony he gave to the brother as he
[1:08:57] says that nature now removes from a
[1:09:00] position of throne room and he moves to
[1:09:04] a position of influence
[1:09:07] and now he's there to try to try to
[1:09:09] influence you
[1:09:11] and there listen he he he's in god is
[1:09:14] the bible says in psalms 46 he's an
[1:09:16] ever-present help the lord is an
[1:09:18] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[1:09:19] let me just say this the devil is an
[1:09:21] ever-present enemy always there
[1:09:25] thank god we got an ever-present help
[1:09:28] he's an ever-present enemy always busy
[1:09:31] tirelessly
[1:09:33] trying to disrupt
[1:09:35] notice what brother branham says here
[1:09:37] now that a devil is almost
[1:09:40] harmless
[1:09:42] until unless he can have something to
[1:09:45] work in he's gone you remember those
[1:09:47] devils that were cast out of
[1:09:49] out of legion they had they wanted to do
[1:09:51] more mischievous so they wanted to go
[1:09:53] into the hogs so devils must have
[1:09:56] something to work in
[1:09:59] somebody to work through
[1:10:01] how much
[1:10:02] can the devil do through me
[1:10:04] as much access as you're willing to give
[1:10:08] him
[1:10:10] how much can the devil control me as
[1:10:12] much as you allow him brother branham
[1:10:15] says the devil's almost harmless unless
[1:10:17] he can have something to work in so
[1:10:19] satan can only have his i hope you catch
[1:10:21] this he can only have as much victory as
[1:10:24] you allow
[1:10:27] to say to a born against child of god he
[1:10:30] has no access unless you open the door
[1:10:36] say brother matt while i would never
[1:10:37] devil comes knocking on my door
[1:10:41] i would never open the door you see the
[1:10:44] problem is the devil's approach he
[1:10:45] doesn't come with you know as looking
[1:10:47] like the boogeyman
[1:10:50] he comes in a little complex
[1:10:54] comes in a little hurt feeling and he
[1:10:55] uses your memory i remember what that
[1:10:58] brother said and what they did to me and
[1:11:00] you don't even realize it's the devil
[1:11:02] and you're giving him access into your
[1:11:04] spirit
[1:11:07] and you've given that the devil access
[1:11:09] to this and you do it through the five
[1:11:10] gates through your eyes through your
[1:11:12] ears what you listen to even what you
[1:11:14] say
[1:11:16] do we realize
[1:11:17] how cr how important how much emphasis
[1:11:20] god puts on what words come out of our
[1:11:22] mouth
[1:11:24] well that just slipped out no it didn't
[1:11:25] just slip out
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:28] out of the abundance of the heart jesus
[1:11:30] said the mouth speaks
[1:11:35] so you you your words what how we speak
[1:11:38] what we say jesus said for i say unto
[1:11:41] you every idol word that a man speaketh
[1:11:43] he shall give an account thereof james
[1:11:45] speaks of it jesus spoke of it and james
[1:11:48] speaks about the control that a person
[1:11:50] that the control is like a rudder of a
[1:11:52] ship such a tiny little bitty rudder
[1:11:56] he says yet it turns the entire ship
[1:11:59] the whole ship is turned by that little
[1:12:01] bitty rudder and he's using it to show
[1:12:04] you how powerful the tongue is
[1:12:06] by the words and james says for bio
[1:12:09] jesus says for by thy words
[1:12:11] thou shalt be justified or by thy words
[1:12:14] thou shalt be condemned
[1:12:18] so we allow these spirits to come out
[1:12:20] and then they come out and we speak it
[1:12:23] and it can come out in many different
[1:12:24] forms you you speak against somebody and
[1:12:27] gossip and begin to backbite remember
[1:12:29] that quote we read
[1:12:30] on sunday and brother branham says he
[1:12:33] says you take a person and they begin to
[1:12:35] criticize the church and all this isn't
[1:12:37] right and this isn't right and brother
[1:12:39] branham says
[1:12:40] that's sulfuric acid
[1:12:44] it's demon power
[1:12:46] that's sulfuric
[1:12:48] acid you shouldn't be corrosive as a
[1:12:51] christian
[1:12:53] a believers we we said it sunday it's an
[1:12:56] attribute of of a christian to be kind
[1:12:59] it's not an attribute of a christian to
[1:13:00] be rude
[1:13:04] you can be stern you can be
[1:13:06] uncompromising you can be unwavering but
[1:13:08] i say lord help us to temper how many
[1:13:11] can say it with me help us to temper our
[1:13:13] spirits
[1:13:15] and sprinkle our correction with love
[1:13:18] with not not worldly love of i just love
[1:13:21] everybody and i accept everybody give me
[1:13:23] the love of jesus
[1:13:25] you can have the perverted with love of
[1:13:27] the world love is corrective
[1:13:31] but it's correct of love it's love
[1:13:33] correction that comes with love
[1:13:36] a devil is almost harmless unless you
[1:13:38] have something to work and he's got you
[1:13:39] remember those devils he says so the
[1:13:41] devils must have something to work in
[1:13:43] somebody to work through
[1:13:45] and satan can only his power he's god
[1:13:47] has just perverted power it isn't real
[1:13:50] no real power adultery and act misused
[1:13:52] the righteous hack misuse everything
[1:13:54] that satan has has got something that
[1:13:56] was perverted but it's a power
[1:13:58] and we are today
[1:14:00] setting here
[1:14:01] and one one or the other power is going
[1:14:05] to control us
[1:14:08] one or the other power is going to
[1:14:11] control our actions
[1:14:15] what are the other powers going to
[1:14:17] control our decisions and the choices
[1:14:19] that we make
[1:14:21] brother branham says and i love this one
[1:14:23] or the other is going to con is going to
[1:14:25] control us so
[1:14:27] let's cast the evil one let's cast out
[1:14:30] the evil one
[1:14:31] let's take our position like the stars
[1:14:34] of the heavens
[1:14:36] then what does that do notice now
[1:14:38] brother brandon begins to take this and
[1:14:39] i didn't want to just flood you with
[1:14:42] quotes i could have just
[1:14:43] posted more of these but i'll paraphrase
[1:14:45] some of these
[1:14:47] brother brandon begins to talk about how
[1:14:48] that you're you're the triune being that
[1:14:51] you are and he begins to talk about body
[1:14:53] spirit and soul
[1:14:55] and he talks about the the law of faith
[1:14:58] or doubt unbelief unbelief in the heart
[1:15:01] and then he talks about the nature of
[1:15:02] the spirit that there's five senses that
[1:15:05] control that in five senses in the body
[1:15:07] and now listen up brother branham words
[1:15:09] this he says then what does that do
[1:15:12] from the middle of the heart
[1:15:15] which is the soul now i put in
[1:15:17] parentheses those are my words spirit
[1:15:19] and that ebm stands for edited by me
[1:15:21] that's for me i just copied and pasted
[1:15:23] this quote for my notes reason why i did
[1:15:26] that is because if you go listen to
[1:15:27] greatest battle ever fall brother
[1:15:29] branham reverses this order of how he
[1:15:32] teaches it after the seals
[1:15:34] so he says which is there's from the
[1:15:36] middle of the heart
[1:15:37] from there goes forth feeding every
[1:15:41] channel
[1:15:42] the trouble of it is we're standing in
[1:15:45] here with a lot of doubt now i'll put
[1:15:48] this in parentheses you say doubt
[1:15:50] that just means i doubt the word no that
[1:15:52] means a lot more you're standing here
[1:15:54] the problem of it is you're standing
[1:15:56] here with a lot of doubt a lot of
[1:15:58] complexes could be a lot of fears could
[1:16:00] be a lot of hurt could be a lot of pain
[1:16:03] could be a lot of pressure
[1:16:05] trying to accept what's out there
[1:16:09] you've got to stop that
[1:16:12] and come down that channel with the true
[1:16:15] word of god and then it goes out itself
[1:16:18] automatically
[1:16:19] it's what notice it's what's on the
[1:16:21] inside
[1:16:22] that's the thing that counts
[1:16:25] is the inside
[1:16:27] satan's approach
[1:16:29] is from
[1:16:31] the inside
[1:16:34] he's not going to get me down in the bar
[1:16:36] stool he's not going to get me over here
[1:16:39] on the street corner buying dope you're
[1:16:41] not going to find me there
[1:16:44] so his approach rather than coming
[1:16:45] externally he comes internally
[1:16:48] and he works through complexes
[1:16:50] he works through bitterness
[1:16:52] he works through jealousy
[1:16:54] he works through fear
[1:16:56] he works through pressure
[1:17:00] and he says you're standing here with a
[1:17:01] lot of this he says you got to clean it
[1:17:03] out satan's approaches from the inside
[1:17:04] and there's only one avenue
[1:17:07] that can come down
[1:17:08] and that's by the way a free moral
[1:17:11] agency come into the soul which he's
[1:17:13] speaking of the spirit by your thoughts
[1:17:16] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:17:19] if you say to this mountain move and
[1:17:21] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:17:24] and what you have said will come to pass
[1:17:27] you can have what you said you get it
[1:17:30] you get it
[1:17:32] there you are see
[1:17:34] there's the battlegrounds if you'd only
[1:17:37] get that started first he's preaching
[1:17:39] the greatest battle ever fault
[1:17:43] and he's not preaching that you just
[1:17:45] need that you just need to be born again
[1:17:46] that's that's
[1:17:48] that's given that's assumed you're
[1:17:49] already born of the spirit of god and he
[1:17:52] says but what you've got to get started
[1:17:53] the reason why you're losing to the
[1:17:55] devil the reason why your wins and
[1:17:58] losses category is loss and loss and
[1:18:01] loss is because you've never cleaned out
[1:18:03] those channels inside of your spirit
[1:18:07] wow
[1:18:08] and he says here see what it's covered
[1:18:09] over with you say well now you say well
[1:18:12] these conscience and senses and so forth
[1:18:15] don't have anything to do with it
[1:18:17] brother branham
[1:18:18] certainly it does wow
[1:18:21] your conscience
[1:18:23] your memory your imagination your
[1:18:25] reasoning your affection
[1:18:28] i don't have nothing to do with it
[1:18:30] certainly it does
[1:18:32] but if you let the word come in and
[1:18:34] cover it over notice this
[1:18:36] cover it over with conscience
[1:18:39] i want you got to slow down here because
[1:18:41] you'll miss what the point brother brad
[1:18:42] was making he says that if you let the
[1:18:44] word come in
[1:18:46] i raised my hand say lord let it come in
[1:18:49] i accept it lord i believe it lord he
[1:18:54] says if you let the word come in
[1:18:57] and cover it over with conscience
[1:19:00] then it can't grow
[1:19:02] it'll be a deformed word
[1:19:06] so you accept it i believe it i accept
[1:19:08] it but then you let your memory come in
[1:19:10] and you let reasoning and doubt
[1:19:13] sit on top of it he says then it can't
[1:19:16] grow
[1:19:17] it'll be a deformed word good
[1:19:21] you see you see the battle this is why
[1:19:24] he's preaching the greatest battle ever
[1:19:26] fought is right here
[1:19:28] i've got my past
[1:19:30] to deal with god's forgiven me of but i
[1:19:33] still
[1:19:34] live with the baggage of yesterday
[1:19:36] of what happened to me of what took
[1:19:38] place in my life and brother adam says
[1:19:41] if you don't clean that out
[1:19:43] and let the lord come in there and clean
[1:19:45] it out and heal that part of you he says
[1:19:48] you you're out here you're wanting to
[1:19:50] accept the word i want to believe the
[1:19:52] word and he says but you're letting that
[1:19:54] sorrow or that pain
[1:19:56] or unforgiveness
[1:19:59] and you try to you try to meet that with
[1:20:01] the word he says it'll cover it over and
[1:20:04] it the word can't grow it'll be a
[1:20:05] deformed word you'll never have faith
[1:20:11] you want to have faith but you can't
[1:20:12] have faith
[1:20:14] you say brother matt what are those
[1:20:15] things they're not sin i'm not talking
[1:20:16] about sinful things we're not talking
[1:20:18] about things of the flesh
[1:20:19] i'm talking about things from your past
[1:20:21] that you won't let go of
[1:20:24] and then those become hindrances they
[1:20:26] don't become building blocks and
[1:20:28] stepping stones
[1:20:29] they become roadblocks
[1:20:33] and ditches
[1:20:34] and you get stuck in a rut and stuck in
[1:20:36] a ditch
[1:20:38] and you just remain there as a believer
[1:20:40] i want i believe the word i want all of
[1:20:42] it
[1:20:43] and we're preaching on being changed
[1:20:45] there's a part of you
[1:20:46] that's being changed
[1:20:49] but the devil if he can do anything will
[1:20:51] stun our growth
[1:20:53] and we'll come we'll we'll allow
[1:20:54] ourselves to be a believer but don't
[1:20:56] touch that part of me that that that
[1:20:59] hurt that happened to me was real
[1:21:02] and you hold on to that and if you're
[1:21:04] not careful you begin to pet that
[1:21:06] you begin to embrace that
[1:21:08] you realize what that is that's pride
[1:21:10] and listen friends we're all
[1:21:12] guilty
[1:21:14] all of us are guilty of it
[1:21:17] brother random says certainly it covered
[1:21:19] over with conscience it can't grow
[1:21:21] it'll be a deformed word
[1:21:24] did you ever see a good grain of corn
[1:21:25] planted in the ground and let a stick
[1:21:27] fall over it
[1:21:29] it'll grow crooked
[1:21:31] any vine anything that grows up will
[1:21:34] because something has hindered it
[1:21:37] he tells the same exact uh
[1:21:40] he gives the same exact example in
[1:21:42] another place and i don't have the quote
[1:21:43] here but he talks about how he's seen
[1:21:45] all this the wheat of the corn and he
[1:21:48] says and all of the stalks were just
[1:21:50] growing straight every single one of
[1:21:51] them just straight up to the sky and he
[1:21:53] says but i noticed there was one and he
[1:21:56] says it was bent over and it came out of
[1:21:58] the ground been at a 90 then it went
[1:22:00] back up and then it fell back over and
[1:22:03] then it he said it was up and he says
[1:22:05] see
[1:22:06] something when it was young something in
[1:22:08] other words it's it's past it's
[1:22:10] yesterday
[1:22:13] something took place something happened
[1:22:16] and he says then a branch or something
[1:22:18] fell over on top of it
[1:22:21] and brother branham says and it caused
[1:22:23] its life to grow up deformed
[1:22:27] and brother branham says and it will
[1:22:29] always grow crooked like that
[1:22:31] until you remove the branch
[1:22:35] now the miracle is is that it didn't die
[1:22:39] and satan intended to kill you and wipe
[1:22:41] you out by it
[1:22:43] but you're still here
[1:22:46] can i just stop and pause for a moment
[1:22:48] and say no matter what you've went
[1:22:49] through and no matter what you've been
[1:22:52] through when you were a teenager when
[1:22:53] you were 20 30 40 yesterday last week no
[1:22:57] matter what happened to you today let me
[1:22:59] just remind you you're looking for them
[1:23:01] for a miracle look around you you're
[1:23:03] here
[1:23:04] you're in church you're serving the lord
[1:23:08] you still have a desire for the lord you
[1:23:10] still want him you want your children
[1:23:12] saved you still want the holy ghost you
[1:23:14] still want good things from god you
[1:23:15] still want his blessings you still want
[1:23:18] to worship him you still want to serve
[1:23:19] him satan might have knocked you down
[1:23:22] but here you are you're back on your
[1:23:23] feet again
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:26] you're here with a desire and a hunger
[1:23:28] for the word of god you may not be what
[1:23:31] you want to be and you may be messed up
[1:23:32] here tonight but take courage in small
[1:23:35] victories that you're here on a
[1:23:37] wednesday night hearing the preaching of
[1:23:39] the word of god believing it accepting
[1:23:42] it casting down the lie of the devil
[1:23:47] say thank you god for even if it's just
[1:23:49] something as small as i came to church
[1:23:51] tonight that means i got my foot on the
[1:23:54] on the head of that devil
[1:23:56] that tried to prevent me
[1:23:59] he said if something that fell upon you
[1:24:01] a branch or something he said it'll grow
[1:24:03] crooked so he says notice these things
[1:24:05] now let me just go a little bit further
[1:24:07] and he says it must be accepted in the
[1:24:09] mind then it's believed with the heart
[1:24:12] then the word of god becomes a reality
[1:24:14] then every senses
[1:24:16] of the soul the speaking of the spirit
[1:24:19] and body is just scoured out with the
[1:24:22] holy spirit
[1:24:24] then your sense of god
[1:24:27] your conscience of god
[1:24:29] everything that's godly flows through
[1:24:32] you
[1:24:33] there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:24:36] there's nothing can rise up i say lord
[1:24:38] let me get to that place
[1:24:40] let me get to that place to where the
[1:24:42] holy ghost comes and scours out
[1:24:45] every part of me
[1:24:48] the parts that i can't clean out the
[1:24:50] parts that that self-help can't help the
[1:24:53] part that psychologists and doctors
[1:24:55] can't help but i know the healer he's
[1:24:57] the great physician and he can scour
[1:25:00] every part of you body spirit mind
[1:25:04] i desire that you prosper and be in
[1:25:06] health
[1:25:08] mentally physically spiritually
[1:25:10] emotionally
[1:25:12] it's not that you're not a believer it's
[1:25:14] that you've allowed something to fall
[1:25:16] upon you and you've got to remove the
[1:25:19] branch
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:22] there's nothing can rise up i love that
[1:25:25] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:25:28] and been purged and been filled on the
[1:25:30] inside with the holy spirit that don't
[1:25:33] come and now listen that don't even come
[1:25:35] in memory
[1:25:36] no matter about miss jones i don't know
[1:25:39] who miss jones is but i'm sure we all
[1:25:41] have a miss jones
[1:25:43] no matter what about miss jones what she
[1:25:47] did
[1:25:48] it's you and god
[1:25:51] well that preacher if you only knew
[1:25:52] brother it doesn't matter
[1:25:55] when god cleans out your memory and your
[1:25:57] conscience and he scrubs you clean it
[1:25:59] doesn't matter then it's not about miss
[1:26:02] jones anymore it's you and god
[1:26:05] together and nobody else but you too
[1:26:09] i say lord let me have a spiritual
[1:26:12] awareness and consciousness

[1:26:50] thirst for it and it's not me it's not

[1:26:54] me and the lord
[1:26:57] since you two together nobody else but
[1:26:59] you two there you are there's your
[1:27:01] battle

[1:27:04] stop him dead in his track i love this
[1:27:08] it ain't how long you can make the war
[1:27:10] linger
[1:27:11] it's stop it right now right now
[1:27:17] it ain't by how long i can drag this out
[1:27:19] it's available it's here liberty's here
[1:27:22] freedom is here
[1:27:24] right now
[1:27:26] can you say man
[1:27:28] what was the matter you had to open the
[1:27:30] channel first every one of the other
[1:27:32] channels is cleared out just like an old
[1:27:33] boiler with the flu stopped up you put a
[1:27:35] fire it'll blow your thing up
[1:27:38] that's what's the matter with so many
[1:27:40] blowed up
[1:27:42] christians
[1:27:44] christians that's what's the matter with
[1:27:47] so many blowed up
[1:27:49] born again filled with the baptism of
[1:27:52] the holy ghost the devil's trying to get
[1:27:54] him to lie to them and tell them you
[1:27:55] don't even know the lord you've never
[1:27:57] experienced god you don't have the holy
[1:27:59] ghost and that's not your problem the
[1:28:01] problem is is that you you never cleaned
[1:28:03] out the flu
[1:28:06] and then you lit a fire and brother adam
[1:28:08] says then it just blows up
[1:28:11] that's what's wrong with so many blown
[1:28:12] up christians it's because they don't
[1:28:15] clean the channels out they don't go
[1:28:18] down to the inside you've got to clean
[1:28:21] it conscience memory thoughts
[1:28:24] laying aside
[1:28:25] everything
[1:28:27] i lay aside everything lord
[1:28:30] and coming from the inside out with the
[1:28:33] with that unadulterated word of god
[1:28:36] that's the truth
[1:28:39] see it's your mind that opens up the
[1:28:41] door or closes the door and listens to
[1:28:44] your conscience listens to your memory
[1:28:47] listens to your affections but when your
[1:28:49] mind closes itself to these things and
[1:28:52] let god the spirit of his word come in
[1:28:54] it blows the rest of the stuff out every
[1:28:57] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[1:29:00] sensation of doubt is gone every feeling
[1:29:03] is gone there's nothing standing there
[1:29:05] but the word of god and satan can't
[1:29:07] battle against that he can't battle
[1:29:10] against it he says there's the battle
[1:29:12] the very first front line let's not use
[1:29:15] a 22 rifle let's get an atomic bomb
[1:29:18] let's do the job right let's get god's
[1:29:21] atomic bomb what is it brother branham
[1:29:23] faith in his word that's god's atomic
[1:29:26] bomb
[1:29:27] it'll blow sickness it'll blow devils
[1:29:30] right and left it'll annihilate them oh
[1:29:33] it just destroys it disintegrates
[1:29:36] everything that's ungodly when that bomb
[1:29:39] of faith drops in there with the word of
[1:29:41] god behind it it blows every devil every
[1:29:44] sickness every disease i say god drop it
[1:29:48] right in my heart i open it up right now
[1:29:51] and say god dropped that atomic bomb to
[1:29:54] where my channels are so cleaned out i
[1:29:57] can have faith and accept what you say
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:00] how many can say lord i just want to
[1:30:02] have no hindrances
[1:30:04] i want to clear out every doubt every
[1:30:06] hindrance lord i want to be able to
[1:30:08] accept it
[1:30:12] you say is that right brother man
[1:30:16] on the same and not he says then why
[1:30:17] does it all the same as and why does it
[1:30:19] on the same and not others it's because
[1:30:22] of the channel
[1:30:23] then if satan has got just one more then
[1:30:25] if satan can get through there
[1:30:27] get by these conscience and all these
[1:30:29] other things that he gets right down
[1:30:30] here to the end of the soul and the
[1:30:32] spirit is speaking of in the mind now if
[1:30:34] he can just get you you'll never look at
[1:30:36] one of them until first you have to let
[1:30:39] him in here you have to let him in i
[1:30:42] know that's hard to read
[1:30:44] you have to let him in
[1:30:47] how does the devil get access brother
[1:30:50] man
[1:30:50] i've guarded him i read my bible i pray
[1:30:54] i talk to the lord how did he get in
[1:30:57] somewhere
[1:30:58] you opened the door
[1:31:02] and it may not be a door that what like
[1:31:04] a door what you're thinking maybe it
[1:31:06] wasn't lust a lustful demon or maybe it
[1:31:08] wasn't some kind of prideful thing but
[1:31:10] maybe just something in your spirit that
[1:31:12] you allowed
[1:31:14] to fester and you keep thinking that way
[1:31:16] brother branham gets to the end of and
[1:31:18] we we spoke on this and i didn't want to
[1:31:20] take the time to read it again i've
[1:31:22] we've read it so many times the lord
[1:31:24] gave me this message titled being
[1:31:26] changed from standing in the gap and
[1:31:29] brother branham talks about brother roy
[1:31:31] has the dream and brother adam says the
[1:31:33] brother roy says brother branham you
[1:31:34] were at the lord's table and he says you
[1:31:37] were you were seated at the lord's table
[1:31:39] and he says and he says and then
[1:31:40] something came in and snatched you and
[1:31:43] took you out of there
[1:31:44] and he says then i i seen you he says in
[1:31:46] that same light
[1:31:48] the light the pillar of fire that's in
[1:31:50] the picture he said that same light
[1:31:53] whirled in and it sat you at the head of
[1:31:55] the table and you were at the head of
[1:31:57] the table and brother branham says and
[1:31:59] he says but brother branham you were
[1:32:01] changed
[1:32:03] to look different
[1:32:05] you were changed
[1:32:07] to look different and brother branham
[1:32:09] says now i just he took out a little
[1:32:10] note and he writes in there being
[1:32:12] changed that's what he writes and he
[1:32:14] sticks it there he says i just want to
[1:32:15] lay that there to remember when i tell
[1:32:17] you the interpretation he says it was
[1:32:19] funny to brother roy it was odd to
[1:32:21] brother roy me
[1:32:24] being changed and he says but i want to
[1:32:27] write this down to show you at the end
[1:32:29] of this message i want to show you
[1:32:31] he says what the interpretation of that
[1:32:33] where brother branham was the he was the
[1:32:35] same man but he comes back in the room
[1:32:38] and he's changed and your mind goes when
[1:32:41] you read that oh it's got to be
[1:32:42] something about the the seals or
[1:32:45] something you know going to
[1:32:46] jeffersonville it had nothing to do with
[1:32:47] that it was a complex that brother
[1:32:49] branham had developed against people
[1:32:52] because he preached
[1:32:55] and they wouldn't hear his preaching
[1:32:57] they wouldn't line up brother adam says
[1:32:59] i'd preach to them and he says and then
[1:33:01] i developed such a complex he says such
[1:33:04] a indifference
[1:33:06] towards people such an attitude i call
[1:33:09] them rickies and raquetas and the lord
[1:33:10] showed me i ought not to do that those
[1:33:13] are many of them's or god's people he
[1:33:15] says but they're they're bound up by
[1:33:16] denominational teaching he said they
[1:33:18] would serve the lord if they only knew
[1:33:20] what to serve
[1:33:22] and so what's brother bro what's you say
[1:33:24] well i guess brother baron him all the
[1:33:26] way in sin and then the gap wasn't born
[1:33:28] again brother matt
[1:33:31] i guess all the way and standing in the
[1:33:33] gap he preaches the seals and now he now
[1:33:35] he's not even born of the spirit of god
[1:33:37] no
[1:33:39] no but he was more than he was he was a
[1:33:42] body spirit soul
[1:33:44] and he had ingested something in his
[1:33:47] spirit
[1:33:48] that had became so corrosive to him
[1:33:52] preaching the gospel preaching the word
[1:33:56] and it became so corrosive to him that
[1:33:58] he says could you look at a man blind
[1:34:00] going over a cliff and not say anything
[1:34:02] to him surely he said surely you
[1:34:04] couldn't do that if a blind man was
[1:34:06] about to go over a cliff and you
[1:34:07] wouldn't reach out he said now that
[1:34:08] brothers i just want to confess to you
[1:34:10] that's he said you'd have to be so
[1:34:11] indifferent in your heart and he says
[1:34:13] well that's how i was i was just about
[1:34:16] to do it
[1:34:17] and he goes through the entire message
[1:34:19] and standing in a gap and he tells how
[1:34:20] that and he says but that was the change
[1:34:24] that brother roy seen
[1:34:26] that brother branham looked different
[1:34:29] that something had been changed
[1:34:32] not that he was a compromiser
[1:34:35] not that he was going to compromise on
[1:34:36] the word not that he was going to even
[1:34:39] preach it any different
[1:34:41] but his heart
[1:34:43] his spirit
[1:34:45] his attitude his outlook on how he
[1:34:48] viewed the situation
[1:34:50] only god could have changed him it
[1:34:53] wasn't brother branham but a light had
[1:34:55] came in put him back in the room what
[1:34:57] was it god had done surgery on his heart
[1:35:02] glory because even after the message
[1:35:04] brother branham says he says now
[1:35:05] brothers i'm still that way i still feel
[1:35:07] that even after he confesses
[1:35:09] he says i still feel they ought to have
[1:35:11] listened he says now will you pray for
[1:35:13] me you brothers you in radio land you'd
[1:35:15] be praying for me he says until i can
[1:35:18] have that something in my heart to where
[1:35:20] there's not rickies and mercators he
[1:35:22] says that's god's people until that
[1:35:24] something in my heart can change i'll
[1:35:27] just loaf around preach some means
[1:35:29] that's what he says
[1:35:30] you know what's so incredible about that
[1:35:33] is brother way
[1:35:35] in that service at the end of that tape
[1:35:38] dies
[1:35:41] and then you go to you go to the end of
[1:35:43] that tape and here's brother way past
[1:35:45] passed away dead nurse was there checked
[1:35:48] his pulse was dead and brother branham
[1:35:49] goes and prays for him and if you listen
[1:35:51] to the prayer brother adam says oh god i
[1:35:54] pray that brother way would come back to
[1:35:56] himself
[1:35:57] now you take this for what it's worth
[1:35:59] but i think that god chose to allow a
[1:36:02] miracle like that to happen
[1:36:04] in that circumstance and on that tape
[1:36:07] and it's very representative of what had
[1:36:09] taken place in brother branham
[1:36:12] brother wade passes away and brother
[1:36:13] baron begins to pray for him when you
[1:36:15] hear on the tape by the way he's back
[1:36:17] breathing again he stays stand back
[1:36:19] sitting up and god raises a man from the
[1:36:22] dead
[1:36:24] in that sermon
[1:36:25] brother branham preaches the flashing
[1:36:27] red light of his coming that evening
[1:36:30] and he's he's really he's he's
[1:36:32] reminiscing trying to remember he's
[1:36:34] trying to make sense of what happened
[1:36:36] he says well i don't know if because at
[1:36:38] the end of that tape let me let me come
[1:36:41] back at the end of that before brother
[1:36:43] way passes before brother brother way
[1:36:45] dies
[1:36:46] in the in the in the in the in the
[1:36:48] church there brother branham says now he
[1:36:50] says you see how easy it is brother way
[1:36:53] he says you got a complex you know how
[1:36:56] easy it is to get a complex
[1:36:58] and he says i pray that god would give
[1:37:00] me that thing back that i lost
[1:37:05] in that complex
[1:37:07] that's how the random words that i pray
[1:37:08] that god would give me that thing did he
[1:37:10] lose the holy ghost no
[1:37:13] did he lose did he lose the lord no he
[1:37:14] didn't lose the lord
[1:37:17] but there was a part there was a channel
[1:37:19] there that had became clogged up with
[1:37:21] envy and anger and bitterness and temper
[1:37:24] that's what it was
[1:37:27] and brother branham says now brother way
[1:37:29] you know how it easy how easy it is to
[1:37:31] get a complex brother away brother
[1:37:32] brandon preaches flashing red light of
[1:37:34] his coming and he's trying to he's
[1:37:35] trying to
[1:37:37] make sense of what happened
[1:37:38] and he says no i don't know the poor
[1:37:40] brother maybe me saying that about him
[1:37:42] having a complex is just more than he
[1:37:44] can handle and there me being as how
[1:37:46] much respect he has for me and maybe he
[1:37:49] thought i was rebuking him and thought i
[1:37:51] was
[1:37:52] you know calling him out
[1:37:53] brother adam says i don't know he says i
[1:37:55] don't know or or or what it was he said
[1:37:57] but brother way pat passes away you know
[1:37:59] what it was
[1:38:01] it was god
[1:38:02] showing his prophet
[1:38:04] that the dead can still be raised
[1:38:07] and the gift can still operate
[1:38:10] and yet a channel in your spirit can be
[1:38:12] clogged
[1:38:14] and something in your life could be
[1:38:16] displeasing to the lord
[1:38:18] what is it you don't look to any
[1:38:20] external outward emotion or evidence or
[1:38:22] gift to preach or gift whatever it is
[1:38:26] you let the microscope of god's word
[1:38:29] and the the light of the holy spirit
[1:38:31] you say well i'm all right well
[1:38:34] as as david said try me o lord
[1:38:37] search me o god
[1:38:40] see if there be any wicked way in me
[1:38:43] see if there be anything any any part of
[1:38:46] me brother adam says see you'll never
[1:38:48] look at them until you have to let them
[1:38:50] in here you have to let him in
[1:38:52] then when he gets in he's got control
[1:38:55] then what does he do he begins to use
[1:38:57] the conscience

[1:40:06] you say is that what i've got to do
[1:40:07] brother matt that's what the apostle
[1:40:09] paul tells you to do the weapons of your
[1:40:11] warfare are not carnal
