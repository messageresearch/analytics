[37:31] time uh brother Jason has invited me
[37:33] many
[37:34] times many people wonder who are you
[37:37] well I'm your friend I'm your brother
[37:40] and when you get in if you arrive to
[37:41] Heaven first you watch for me I'll be
[37:44] there
[37:45] someplace yeah look
[37:47] around and so uh what I do is I'm a
[37:53] representative of a mighty
[37:55] message I've been in there this since
[37:58] 1963 long before many of you was even
[38:01] born and so for the last 50 years I've
[38:04] been ministering the
[38:06] word both in English and
[38:08] Spanish and it's only uh 17 minutes to
[38:13] 12 and church doesn't start over brother
[38:16] Samuel's this evening till 5: so we
[38:19] might be here a
[38:21] while if I see people living yeah we're
[38:23] going to lock the
[38:25] doors but um in the process of all this
[38:29] I've been translating the message into
[38:31] Spanish uh and that's what a lot of
[38:34] people throughout the entire Spanish
[38:35] speaking world are feasting on and
[38:38] studying is the the message in their
[38:41] language if this message came in French
[38:44] you wouldn't be sitting here putting up
[38:46] with the translation because Americans
[38:48] aren't built for that no you would stay
[38:51] in the Baptist Church or whatever where
[38:53] they speak your language but um the
[38:55] people are anxious they're hungry for
[38:57] the word so they you know they
[39:00] listen and um so there's three reasons
[39:03] that I'm here today one is because
[39:05] brother Jason's invited me which I'm
[39:08] thankful and that's good because we've
[39:10] been friends from I mean he was about so
[39:13] tall and um so somehow we've been
[39:16] friends all these years and so number
[39:19] two is that there's time slot that we
[39:21] could actually be here but number three
[39:25] is the fact that um you know God deals
[39:27] in
[39:28] dreams and some are good and some are
[39:31] not so good but you know God deals in
[39:34] dreams I don't do a lot of dreaming when
[39:36] I dream it's all disappears by the time
[39:38] I get coffee hot you know but um other
[39:41] people dream then they tell me hey this
[39:43] is what happened so um several months
[39:47] ago a brother friend of mine called me
[39:49] and said man I had this dream last night
[39:52] and he said I was in brother brandom's
[39:54] um living room there in Jeffersonville
[39:56] like like a fly on the wall watching
[39:57] everything he said now you and Rebecca
[40:00] were sitting by the
[40:02] fireplace and over here in these chairs
[40:04] was brother Neville and sister brandham
[40:06] they were just talking and so they were
[40:09] talking about current things you know
[40:12] and so directly brother Neville got up
[40:14] to leave so he's over by the door and
[40:16] sister brand goes over to see him out
[40:19] and then they said uh Rebecca come over
[40:21] here with us so when you put put it all
[40:25] on paper brother eille died in
[40:28] 74 and sister Bram left in 81 and
[40:31] Rebecca died in ' 06 so they're in this
[40:34] other dimension and so they looked back
[40:36] at me and they said you keep doing what
[40:38] you're doing so that was a great
[40:41] consolation because I do have a few
[40:43] people out there that don't like what
[40:45] I'm doing but that doesn't matter I'm
[40:46] here to please God follow his word and
[40:50] press forward okay so this morning we're
[40:54] going to look into into the book of Acts
[40:58] you keep your Bible handy because it's
[40:59] going to come in real
[41:01] necessary and um we want to try our best
[41:06] to make the word real to you now we're
[41:09] not going to spoon feed you every verse
[41:11] of the Bible it's your job to go in and
[41:14] read it for
[41:15] yourself because as we gave the uh youth
[41:20] on Friday night I was asked the question
[41:22] well how do we how do we help the youth
[41:24] and so forth well it's real
[41:27] simple um there's four steps and this
[41:30] would be good for every one of you from
[41:32] the guy here that's not paying attention
[41:33] to good yeah you I know who you
[41:37] are um first you read one chapter out of
[41:42] your Bible now these are minimums go
[41:44] farther one chapter out of your Bible
[41:47] every day you read one page out of the
[41:49] church age book every day you listen to
[41:52] at least 20 minutes of God's
[41:54] prophet got it so far
[41:57] three simple steps and you pray all the
[41:59] time especially when you're in traffic
[42:01] when the bridge is up and all that kind
[42:02] of stuff you have time to pray so you
[42:07] you follow those four steps you will be
[42:09] a better Christian the church will be
[42:11] ahead and the pastor won't have so much
[42:13] work I like that because what happens
[42:16] you come in here all flustered because
[42:17] you argued on the way to church and
[42:19] there was a red light and the coffee was
[42:21] cold all these problems and you come in
[42:23] here and with a couple songs you think
[42:25] you're going to get settled down no it
[42:27] takes a little more than that you got to
[42:29] get ready okay and so in the process of
[42:32] all that you will stay balanced and
[42:35] that's why I carry this level with
[42:37] me first we check it out see if the
[42:40] pulpits level yeah perfect God sometimes
[42:44] it's not we got to start
[42:46] over but that's so that you'll remember
[42:48] to stay level because things happen to
[42:51] put you out of out of level you know
[42:53] these boats out here they got to they
[42:55] got to stay level if they can you know
[42:58] so the people we're going to talk about
[43:00] here in the book of Acts today uh these
[43:02] people all had trials they were they
[43:04] were in the first church we're here at
[43:06] the end and there's been trials all
[43:08] along but we go back into the book of
[43:10] Acts to see where it began how how this
[43:13] Foundation started to help you like Paul
[43:17] said this stuff is here for your
[43:18] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[43:20] world have come which it wasn't then
[43:22] it's now we're the ones that on whom the
[43:24] ends of the world came and so so they
[43:26] had relatives like we have and um
[43:29] ministers preached to mixed
[43:31] crowds now our Prophet said that in
[43:33] every congregation there's three kinds
[43:35] of Believers I'm not spiritual enough to
[43:38] know who you
[43:39] are you know who you are don't worry
[43:42] about who your neighbor is who are you
[43:44] and when we get over here at lunch and
[43:46] you start complaining about a b and c
[43:48] and the bald preacher and so forth we'll
[43:50] know which one you are you know but um
[43:54] only in heaven will there be no make
[43:56] Believers or unbelievers the Lord as
[43:58] long as we're here they're going to be
[43:59] around and you got to have enough
[44:02] spirituality to get through it you see
[44:04] and so these people we're going to talk
[44:07] about here in the book of Acts someone
[44:08] to prison prison is not something that
[44:12] Believers don't know about yeah they
[44:13] know about
[44:14] prison and uh they were mainly uh
[44:18] persecuted for employing the name of
[44:20] Jesus Christ people weren't mad because
[44:23] somebody was healed because of this and
[44:25] that and the other no just don't use
[44:27] that name anything you want to do just
[44:29] don't use that
[44:30] name and that's been the problem all
[44:32] along even today down here at the you
[44:35] know next Church they can't baptize in
[44:38] the
[44:38] name you know it's just a problem so um
[44:43] you you also find out when you read
[44:45] through the book of Acts that nobody
[44:47] employed the red-letter words of Jesus
[44:50] Christ from Matthew 28:19 he just told
[44:52] him a few days ago this is what you're
[44:55] going to do you're going to go make make
[44:56] disciples and you're going to baptize
[44:58] them in the name of the father Son and
[45:00] the Holy Ghost oh that was named
[45:02] singular well that didn't dawn on right
[45:03] then you know to a lot of people so what
[45:05] these people did they they heard what he
[45:07] said and they weren't repeating his
[45:10] words all through the book of Acts you
[45:12] don't find any Red Letters uh to where
[45:14] he they were repeating what he said yeah
[45:16] Jesus said you're wrong because I heard
[45:18] it right no they were preaching the word
[45:22] because they were moving out into the
[45:24] deep Waters of Revelation of Jesus words
[45:27] you see and so we may face persecutions
[45:31] we probably will but it won't be for a
[45:33] split nail no it'll probably be for
[45:37] genuinely genuinely suffering for the
[45:40] name of our Lord so if we look at
[45:42] chapter 6 and verse one it says and in
[45:46] those days now we've already covered
[45:49] five chapters it's your job this week to
[45:51] go read those and see what all happen
[45:53] there but in those days when the number
[45:55] number of the disciples was multiplied
[45:58] so it wasn't just added to a couple here
[45:59] and a couple there no multiply means you
[46:02] know
[46:03] increase uh they multiplied there arose
[46:07] murmurings of the grecians against the
[46:09] Hebrews because their widows were
[46:11] neglected in the daily
[46:13] Administration that means that there
[46:15] were some disputes came up among the
[46:18] people in the church like this uh about
[46:21] some of the widows not receiving proper
[46:24] attention now it doesn't say
[46:26] discrimination but you know that's the
[46:27] word we use today well we feel left out
[46:30] you didn't give us enough and so forth
[46:32] we see they needed balance they they
[46:35] were waffling you know and there were
[46:38] the Native born Jews those Jews that
[46:41] immigrated uh from other countries were
[46:43] also there and the widows in particular
[46:46] depended on assistance from the church
[46:49] just a few dollars to help them get the
[46:51] next week you know so the apostles had
[46:54] to Institute Church order which is
[46:58] simply practical ideas for current
[47:01] situations they had no Bible for this
[47:03] but it was a problem today we got to
[47:05] deal with it you know now these
[47:06] assistants to the ministry had to have
[47:09] certain qualifications look here in
[47:11] verse three says look amongst you and um
[47:14] look for uh those that of honest report
[47:17] full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom
[47:21] we may appoint over this business they
[47:22] needed help in the Daily Business that's
[47:24] going on yeah now if yall behave and
[47:27] stay awake we're going to go to lunch
[47:28] after a while I already know there's at
[47:30] least one dish that's good over there I
[47:32] don't know about the rest of
[47:34] it but somebody had to cook it somebody
[47:37] had to bring it somebody has to clean up
[47:38] the mess well Pastor can't be know all
[47:41] that he's got people well that was
[47:43] what's happening back here they were
[47:45] they had more important things to do so
[47:47] they put these people over that business
[47:49] and their first assignment was social
[47:51] work now you might think this is kind of
[47:53] simple but it's Bible and you would do
[47:55] good to follow those four steps read
[47:58] your Bible our Prophet said over 200
[48:02] times back to the word so it's not just
[48:05] a
[48:05] suggestion
[48:07] right and so they were going to do
[48:10] social work something that was commonly
[48:12] left for the women serving meals and so
[48:14] forth and some of these men graduated on
[48:16] to very active Ministry of the word now
[48:21] the disciples were growing uh the number
[48:24] was growing very rapidly
[48:26] in chapter 1 verse1 15 there was only
[48:29] 120 Believers Amen in the upper room
[48:33] hiding for fear from the Jews because
[48:36] Jesus told them y'all need to go over
[48:38] there and stay until he didn't give them
[48:41] ABC is going to happen you'll know when
[48:43] it happens yes amen but like brother
[48:45] Jason just quoted the Bible says in 1
[48:48] Corinthians 15 over 500 saw him
[48:52] Ascend
[48:54] now 500 minus 120 that 76% didn't make
[48:58] it to the upper room only 24% made it
[49:02] there interesting so there's the 120
[49:06] then in verse 41 of chapter 2 after a
[49:09] very brief preaching by Peter 3,000 were
[49:13] added to the church on the first gospel
[49:16] meeting now when I get to heaven you
[49:18] might notice me looking for Peter and
[49:20] I'm going to find Peter and I'm going to
[49:23] ask him if I'm still in my right mind
[49:25] now Peter with all due respect where did
[49:28] baptize 3,000 people there's no River
[49:31] and there's no Lake in Jerusalem H but
[49:34] it happened okay then in verse 47 of
[49:38] chapter 2 added to the church daily such
[49:40] as should be saved
[49:42] predestination it wasn't you know the
[49:44] gospel isn't for
[49:45] everybody all the people on this street
[49:47] ought to be in church but they're not
[49:49] because God's not in their heart in the
[49:50] first place so it's only for believers
[49:53] so they were added daily in chapter 4:4
[49:56] about 5,000
[49:58] men and just not just men here today
[50:01] there were women and there were children
[50:03] and they had no microphone how they do
[50:05] all that kind of stuff very
[50:07] interesting and so it could have been as
[50:09] many as 20,000 joined the church that
[50:11] day you know in chapter 5:14 and the
[50:14] Believers were the more added to the
[50:16] Lord multitudes of men and women so this
[50:19] thing is growing we're only in chapter
[50:21] 6 and in chapter 6 and verse 7 it says
[50:25] says and the word of God increased and
[50:28] the number of the disciples multiplied
[50:30] in Jerusalem greatly and a great company
[50:32] of the priests were obedient to the
[50:34] truth ah these are the guys that could
[50:37] read because they didn't have education
[50:40] like we have so the priests could read
[50:42] they've read all the Old Testament they
[50:44] knew all the Promises by heart but here
[50:46] it was coming into full bloom it's one
[50:48] thing to buy go over here and buy a rose
[50:50] bush but when it comes into bloom then
[50:52] we'll know if the sticker is right or
[50:54] not if it's white or red or what
[50:55] whatever so it's coming into bloom and
[50:58] they're they're paying attention and so
[51:00] now they're seeing the
[51:02] manifestation um of the word that they
[51:04] had memorized okay with me so far are
[51:08] you going to read the book of Acts this
[51:09] week
[51:10] carefully and we have the we have the
[51:13] added benefit that we have a Scofield
[51:15] bible and there's all these little notes
[51:17] in the middle and references that you
[51:20] need to trace down and get the full
[51:23] picture now if you study at all you'll
[51:26] know that Dr scoffield was a lawyer and
[51:29] he had the Bible but he saw that hey
[51:32] there's more to this so he got busy
[51:34] studying no computer thank you pencil
[51:37] and paper only and a few helpers and
[51:41] they worked all this out like a puzzle
[51:44] and it was all finished by January 1
[51:48] 1909 yeah and so here it is in our hands
[51:52] that we can we can study it and so we're
[51:54] very thankful but now in verse 8 of
[51:57] chapter 6 it says uh and Steven it's one
[52:01] of the seven up here in the early part
[52:03] of part of the chapter and Steven full
[52:06] of faith and power did great wonders and
[52:09] miracles amongst the people so here he
[52:12] is a man of Faith Holy Ghost had a great
[52:15] ministry of um wonders and
[52:18] miracles and he actually became the
[52:20] church's first martyr now every Revival
[52:23] produces twins
[52:25] and you're going to hear maybe some new
[52:27] things here but it's mostly what you've
[52:28] already heard before because we're not
[52:30] here to bring you no shortcuts or
[52:32] because I was God you know God's Prophet
[52:34] son and all that I've got a shortcut
[52:36] over here no we got to come back to the
[52:39] word okay so every Revival produces
[52:41] Twins and most of the Believers back
[52:43] then Lov Stephen he was used of God to
[52:45] minister the word you know in uh the
[52:47] word in great Miracles and so forth but
[52:49] there was a few people those kind of
[52:53] oddballs there that that um they they
[52:57] arose to dispute that means to argue
[52:59] with the man of God now as a word of
[53:03] encouragement for brother Jason and the
[53:05] other ministers everybody we preach to
[53:08] isn't a born again red-hot believer we
[53:11] got all kinds of people in the audience
[53:13] amen and God puts those certain people
[53:16] there for Jason's
[53:19] Perfection yeah you can't run them off
[53:22] you can't kill them you can't say Hey
[53:24] brother Tim take these people no they're
[53:25] there for your Perfection so just smile
[53:28] and move forward so that's what he was
[53:31] dealing with he had these people they
[53:32] were arguing with him and so forth and
[53:35] in verse 10 when they couldn't out argue
[53:37] because he was wise too God was with him
[53:41] verse 10 and when they were not able to
[53:43] resist or you know the wisdom and spirit
[53:46] of which he spake then they suborned
[53:49] that means they paid money under the
[53:52] table yeah this is Old English but it's
[53:54] real they uh they paid money to men and
[53:58] they said now we have heard him speak
[54:00] Blasphemous words against Moses and
[54:02] against God no he didn't that's a lie
[54:05] it's a misinterpretation of the facts
[54:07] you see and so they were paid a bribe
[54:10] and So based on these allegations which
[54:12] were false then the religious police
[54:14] came along and they grabbed him and then
[54:16] brought him before the religious Council
[54:18] and those guys also set up false
[54:20] Witnesses and they didn't even agree
[54:22] There Was You Know confusion there amen
[54:25] and so they were bringing confusion
[54:27] confusing accusations by repeating
[54:30] misquotations how much trouble have we
[54:32] seen in our short lifetime of people
[54:34] that use just a little piece of the
[54:36] truth and we got a whole storm because
[54:39] they're not honest enough to tell the
[54:40] whole story well anyway so um you know
[54:44] little pieces of the message in the
[54:45] wrong order misplaced out of Harmony
[54:49] look at verse 13 and they set up false
[54:51] Witnesses which said this man ceases not
[54:53] to speak Blasphemous words against this
[54:55] holy place in the law for we have heard
[54:58] him say that this Jesus of Nazareth
[55:00] shall destroy this place and shall
[55:02] change the Customs which Moses delivered
[55:04] unto us well um they're partly right but
[55:09] it's not the whole story and all that
[55:11] sat in the council so here's here's
[55:13] Steven standing there all the council
[55:16] which was the most important people on
[55:17] the Earth we didn't believe it just ask
[55:20] them they had all the arrogancy
[55:21] everything go with it and here's all
[55:23] these important people and um all that
[55:26] sat in the council looking steadfastly
[55:28] on Steven saw his face as it had been
[55:32] the face of an Angel well if that's true
[55:35] why weren't they on their knees
[55:36] worshiping God because they were filled
[55:39] with hate amen the same thing that's
[55:41] going on in the Middle East right now
[55:43] the Israeli people have only brought
[55:45] peace and prosperity to the region but
[55:47] these other people being from the seed
[55:49] of you know the wrong one they just want
[55:51] to kill they want to push him into the
[55:53] ocean like they never existed they've
[55:54] been going on for centuries but God's
[55:57] eyes are always on the Jews okay it's
[55:59] another subject so he looked like an
[56:02] angel in verse one of7 then said the
[56:05] high priest uh sir are these things true
[56:08] that they're saying about
[56:09] you so he gives the microphone to
[56:11] Stephen H I hope you got a lunch because
[56:14] this last a while it said um and he said
[56:20] men and
[56:21] Brethren um and Father's Heart
[56:25] the god of Glory appeared unto our
[56:27] Father Abraham so he starts into a a
[56:31] long dialogue here it goes into the deep
[56:34] water it was God's way of refocusing the
[56:37] attention of the Believers away from
[56:38] Jerusalem didn't all happen here here we
[56:40] are but it happened out there and so his
[56:43] eloquent history lesson makes four major
[56:46] points you can study this later Point
[56:48] number one 2-8 is the founding of the
[56:51] Hebrew Nation did not occur right here
[56:52] in Jerusalem no out m Mesopotamia all
[56:55] about Abraham so forth part number two 9
[56:59] through 37 all about the Patriarchs see
[57:02] this is just history that oh yeah yeah
[57:04] you're right okay I'll all agree and so
[57:05] forth you know so all about Patriarchs
[57:08] Moses liberation of God's people didn't
[57:10] occur here in Jerusalem out in other
[57:12] places Egypt the Red Sea the
[57:14] Wilderness uh part three is verse 38 the
[57:16] law was not given in Jerusalem but out
[57:19] in the desert all of this is
[57:21] true then he lets the hammer down verse
[57:24] 39 through 50 all about the idolatry of
[57:27] the Hebrews out in the desert yeah the
[57:29] building of the Temple look at verse 47
[57:31] for example where's it that here verse
[57:34] 47 of chapter 7 says here but Solomon
[57:39] built him a house how be it the most
[57:41] high dwelleth not in temples made of
[57:43] hands as saith the prophet you know get
[57:47] serious people Heaven is my Throne Earth
[57:50] is my foot stol and what house will you
[57:52] build me sayith the Lord or what is the
[57:54] place of my rest ha not my hand made all
[57:58] these things and so God doesn't just
[58:01] live in this building no he's he's here
[58:03] because you're here you brought him you
[58:05] know it was just four walls before he
[58:06] got here this morning you know and so um
[58:10] and then verse 51 says here he's stiff
[58:14] necked and now he's getting serious all
[58:16] this is true everybody could agree but
[58:18] now we get to the main point ye stiff
[58:20] necked and uncircumcised in heart and
[58:22] ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost
[58:26] as your fathers so do
[58:28] you which of the prophets have not the
[58:30] fathers persecuted and they have slain
[58:34] them which showed before the coming of
[58:37] the just one of whom you have now been
[58:40] the betrayers and the murderers y all
[58:42] did it who have received the law by
[58:45] disposition of angels and have not been
[58:48] able to keep it so he gave them a real
[58:51] real Stern blast and uh this view of
[58:54] History by Revelation only brought to a
[58:56] real boil the growing conflict between
[59:00] the religious movement that was starting
[59:03] and the city fathers right it was
[59:05] already going but it just brought it up
[59:08] verse 54 and when they heard these
[59:11] things they were happy and took up a
[59:14] missionary offering no they heard these
[59:17] things they were cut to the heart and
[59:19] they nashed on him with their teeth
[59:20] we're going to get this guy and he being
[59:23] full of the Holy Ghost looked up
[59:25] steadfastly yeah right through the roof
[59:27] looked into
[59:28] heaven and saw the glory of God and
[59:31] Jesus standing on the right hand of God
[59:33] huh how about that and he said behold I
[59:36] see the heavens opened I see the son of
[59:38] man standing at the right hand of God
[59:39] and they cried out with all the louder
[59:41] voice and stopped their ears and they
[59:44] ran upon him in one Accord boy we're
[59:46] going to grab this guy we're going to
[59:47] squeeze the life out of him and they
[59:50] cast him out of the city and they stoned
[59:53] him and the w Witnesses laid their
[59:56] clothes at a young man's feet H whose
[59:59] name was Saul and they stoned Steven
[1:00:02] calling upon God and saying Stephen is
[1:00:05] saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and
[1:00:08] he kneel down fell to his knees and
[1:00:11] cried with a loud voice Lord lay not
[1:00:13] this sin to their charge and when he had
[1:00:16] said thus he fell
[1:00:18] asleep first martyr of the new movement
[1:00:21] and so concludes the third persecution
[1:00:23] you can read the other three
[1:00:25] um the other two before that so the
[1:00:28] death of a deacon the first
[1:00:30] martyr Christians are not foreigners to
[1:00:33] persecution to jail to problems we're
[1:00:36] going to have them but we got a promise
[1:00:38] of something better coming
[1:00:41] yes so right here is the first mention
[1:00:43] of our friend Saul he was young he was
[1:00:47] in training he didn't throw any Stones
[1:00:49] he was just watching over the stuff
[1:00:51] while they did the work you know so um
[1:00:55] he witnessed the death of Steven the
[1:00:57] first martyr he was probably too young
[1:00:59] to participate but he was a Pharisee in
[1:01:01] training that wasn't a six-month course
[1:01:04] no he didn't throw rocks but um what
[1:01:08] they hated what what was what was the
[1:01:09] problem just because he said a few words
[1:01:11] they didn't like no the problem was that
[1:01:15] the persecutors hated the manifestation
[1:01:18] of God's word in present tense that's
[1:01:21] always been the problem brother br's
[1:01:23] whole Ministry
[1:01:25] was to declare he's here all these
[1:01:28] promises that come to pass right now and
[1:01:30] that's what we're saying today all this
[1:01:31] back here it's real we're leaving soon
[1:01:34] you see and that's what the problem was
[1:01:36] back then sure historical find quote all
[1:01:38] you want
[1:01:39] historically but we're not going to put
[1:01:41] up with any fulfillment or manifestation
[1:01:44] of the truth you see so when when we see
[1:01:48] that the truth is preached and then we
[1:01:50] see that people don't pay attention they
[1:01:52] just keep going on well they're
[1:01:54] classified something other than real
[1:01:56] Believers because they're not paying
[1:01:57] attention not with program you
[1:01:59] know
[1:02:01] so um the um uh this whole idea just say
[1:02:06] what he said don't start don't don't
[1:02:09] temp me because I've been listening for
[1:02:11] over 50 years also and you come up with
[1:02:13] that nonsense okay he also said this and
[1:02:16] this and this and this you're out you
[1:02:19] know so uh they want to quote it they
[1:02:23] want to manifest it w still going onow
[1:02:26] so we've got to have
[1:02:28] balance what are you going to do with
[1:02:30] with the fact it says right here there
[1:02:32] was 120 in the upper room and then
[1:02:34] William random comes along as a man I
[1:02:36] knew him and he said there was 150 in
[1:02:38] one place well let's see oh there's 120
[1:02:41] he was human amen have you made any
[1:02:44] mistakes preaching brother Jason a few
[1:02:46] yeah a few me
[1:02:48] too I mean beyond the curtain of time
[1:02:50] the angel says and you're going to be
[1:02:51] judged for what you said he didn't start
[1:02:53] biting his finger finger nails and oh
[1:02:55] man I got to go back no he just said
[1:02:58] about Paul well he's going to be judged
[1:03:00] too well then no problem because if Paul
[1:03:02] gets in with his people I get in because
[1:03:04] I preached what Paul preached and we all
[1:03:07] said we're depending on
[1:03:09] that it's not so important about these
[1:03:11] little details and how many was in the
[1:03:13] upper room but you preach what Paul
[1:03:14] preached okay so the
[1:03:18] Pharisees which was you know Paul and
[1:03:20] them it was the religious Elite of
[1:03:23] Judaism the people that did believe in
[1:03:25] the resurrection they believed in the
[1:03:27] Supernatural and they were very
[1:03:30] self-righteous now there probably nobody
[1:03:32] like that down here in this low land but
[1:03:33] where I come from there's a lot of
[1:03:34] self-righteous people you know and so
[1:03:37] and they were the only ones who were
[1:03:39] really right I mean a lot of people
[1:03:41] could quote it and put it in order but
[1:03:43] they were the only ones that you know
[1:03:46] knew how to do it and so um uh
[1:03:49] Revelation was the last thing on their
[1:03:50] mind forget that everything had to be
[1:03:52] letter perfect and today we call them
[1:03:55] legalists now the Sadducees were also
[1:03:58] very important religious people at the
[1:04:00] time they denied
[1:04:02] Supernatural they denied Angels
[1:04:04] especially Resurrection they were the
[1:04:06] religious rationalists of the time they
[1:04:09] reasoned and rationalized and they
[1:04:11] argued over there in Israel because I've
[1:04:14] been there many times I got a lot of
[1:04:16] friends and they say when two Jews are
[1:04:19] arguing there's at least three
[1:04:22] opinions it's not just mine versus your
[1:04:24] you know it's serious so in chapter 8
[1:04:28] and verse one it says and Saul was
[1:04:31] consenting unto his death it's just a
[1:04:33] continuation of verse of chapter 7 and
[1:04:36] at that time there was a great
[1:04:38] persecution against the church which was
[1:04:40] at Jerusalem and they were all scattered
[1:04:42] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[1:04:44] and Samaria except the
[1:04:46] apostles now why do you think that
[1:04:49] is it's because God speaks something and
[1:04:52] then he knows how he's going to bring it
[1:04:53] to pass pass now he said over in in
[1:04:56] chapter 1 you you're all going to be my
[1:04:59] Witnesses right here in Jerusalem or in
[1:05:02] Judea over Samaria and un the uttermost
[1:05:04] part of the earth even to those low
[1:05:07] Islands over there in South
[1:05:09] Carolina it had to come to pass so so
[1:05:13] because of this persecution because the
[1:05:14] Deacon got killed well they thought man
[1:05:16] we got to we got to do something we got
[1:05:18] to raise our family somewhere place else
[1:05:20] so they they started moving started
[1:05:21] going out in fulfillment to fulfill
[1:05:24] those words you see yes amen and so with
[1:05:27] each persecution the plan came into
[1:05:30] sharper focus and this was several years
[1:05:33] since Acts chapter 1 and everybody was
[1:05:35] still you know huddled at Jerusalem and
[1:05:38] it took persecution to move the Lord's
[1:05:40] people into action just like right here
[1:05:44] it's just going to take a little bit of
[1:05:46] pressure to get you serious you know and
[1:05:49] I'm not trying to scare you but it's
[1:05:50] facts you know I mean I I used to know
[1:05:53] the short piano player a long time ago
[1:05:55] but see God pinched him and he had to
[1:05:58] move and same with all of us we we made
[1:06:01] some decisions you know and so um
[1:06:04] Pharisees Saul was one of the main
[1:06:06] troublemakers instigators and bringing
[1:06:09] persecution on the early church look at
[1:06:11] verse three of chapter 8 as for Saul he
[1:06:14] made Havoc of the church entering into
[1:06:16] every house and hailing men and women
[1:06:20] committed them to prison so they were
[1:06:22] going house to house
[1:06:24] just like some of the so-called
[1:06:25] missionaries today yeah now these
[1:06:28] so-called Jehovah's Witness that is the
[1:06:31] most fake thing there is because for the
[1:06:35] last 2,000 years they've been calling
[1:06:36] him Jesus Christ so you guys aren't
[1:06:39] nearly old enough to be a
[1:06:41] witness and if he was if you were one of
[1:06:44] his Witnesses you might dress a little
[1:06:46] different you know so they don't count
[1:06:48] but they go house to house just like
[1:06:49] they were doing
[1:06:50] here and so uh in in in Saul's own words
[1:06:55] he confesses yeah I made Havoc of the
[1:06:57] church Havoc means to uh bring trouble
[1:07:00] confusion so forth but guess what God is
[1:07:03] not the author of confusion if you feel
[1:07:06] confused here well you need to go home
[1:07:08] read your Bible and come back this is
[1:07:10] where there's peace this is where we
[1:07:12] believe all the word all the word comes
[1:07:14] in sections comes in times and God has a
[1:07:18] us here in this last time so when you
[1:07:20] see something confusing and by the way
[1:07:24] St off the internet do yourself a favor
[1:07:26] and the pastor a favor don't go trying
[1:07:28] to argue with those clowns because they
[1:07:30] don't know what they're talking about
[1:07:31] and you're just going to get yourself in
[1:07:32] trouble so where there's confusion go
[1:07:36] the other way you're not going to win
[1:07:38] there's too many and they're devil
[1:07:40] possessed it's not God okay so much for
[1:07:44] that but you see the death of the death
[1:07:47] of Judas is scariot their church leaders
[1:07:50] got together and they looked for a man
[1:07:52] that might be able to fill the position
[1:07:54] okay this man paids ties uh he's got a
[1:07:56] you know spotless Life we'll choose him
[1:07:59] his name was Mias okay but we don't get
[1:08:02] much more out of him he was kind of
[1:08:04] around there for a while God had a
[1:08:06] different idea brother Bram says if it
[1:08:09] had been up to the Americans to choose
[1:08:11] the replacement we would have never
[1:08:13] chose
[1:08:14] Paul no but God says don't touch him
[1:08:17] he's my man now he let him go through
[1:08:19] some stuff but he chose him so what did
[1:08:22] he choose a short
[1:08:25] hook noosed sarcastic high-tempered Jew
[1:08:28] I mean how much wor can it get you know
[1:08:31] and um he was the one that was dragging
[1:08:34] converts into court if they even looked
[1:08:36] if they saw a little picture of a fish
[1:08:38] on the wall you're one of them let's go
[1:08:39] to and kill them and by the way there's
[1:08:41] a film that was in the theaters a few
[1:08:43] years ago you might have seen it I I
[1:08:46] took some people to the theater that had
[1:08:48] never stepped foot in a theater they
[1:08:49] were so holy but it's called Paul
[1:08:52] Apostle of Jesus Christ you can buy it
[1:08:54] online excellent film right out of the
[1:08:57] Bible okay and so
[1:09:01] um they were they were watching for
[1:09:03] people that were part of this new way
[1:09:06] because they had it all figured out it's
[1:09:07] going to happen this and this and this
[1:09:08] and this anything different is wrong and
[1:09:12] Paul was one of these guys he the
[1:09:14] traditions of the fathers it's right and
[1:09:16] let's give him a break 400 years gone by
[1:09:18] with no Prophet okay everybody couldn't
[1:09:20] read back then and so they just believed
[1:09:23] what they heard
[1:09:24] and of course they were way off track
[1:09:26] then Jesus comes along and now we're
[1:09:28] into the early church
[1:09:30] okay so what was their sin that they
[1:09:34] were following Jesus they were following
[1:09:37] the Lamb of God you see and it's still
[1:09:39] happening today and all we have to do is
[1:09:41] walk in the light that God provides
[1:09:43] don't go by some personality because so
[1:09:46] and so said because they printed oh just
[1:09:48] go by the scripture go by the word we
[1:09:50] have it on record it's on every cell
[1:09:52] phone everything William brandom said is
[1:09:54] on your cell phone and everybody else's
[1:09:56] cell phone in several
[1:09:58] languages so there's no
[1:10:01] excuse okay so um Paul you know he's
[1:10:06] he's converted and uh when converted God
[1:10:09] used him in a marvelous way even to be
[1:10:12] responsible for a large portion of the
[1:10:13] scriptures of the New Testament much
[1:10:15] later after preaching the word openly uh
[1:10:18] and he was accused falsely he confessed
[1:10:20] to the authorities this I confess after
[1:10:24] the way which they call heresy that's
[1:10:26] the way I worship the god of my fathers
[1:10:27] believing all things which are written
[1:10:30] in the law and the prophets and we can
[1:10:33] say the same thing you see amen so we'll
[1:10:35] see more about him directly before we go
[1:10:38] to lunch now these people could have
[1:10:40] compromised they could have said well
[1:10:42] this isn't so bad you know okay we we'll
[1:10:43] take the little fish off the wall and
[1:10:46] we'll we'll we'll let our ladies have
[1:10:48] the skirts a little shorter and okay
[1:10:50] yeah we'll trim the hair a little bit
[1:10:51] and to get along right we let the boys
[1:10:54] wear their bangs well we'll just let you
[1:10:56] know okay we want to get along want to
[1:10:58] have peace they didn't have a lot of
[1:11:00] money they couldn't move far away so
[1:11:02] they could have compromised okay choose
[1:11:05] a easier path no resistance no criticism
[1:11:08] path of compromise they want they could
[1:11:10] have H hands with the religious leaders
[1:11:12] and try to get along but you know the
[1:11:14] fifth messenger Martin Luther do good to
[1:11:17] go read about him sometime Christ Alone
[1:11:20] he had to withstand the Catholic Spirit
[1:11:23] yeah which was idolatry and it's still
[1:11:25] here today in the highest places be
[1:11:29] careful Christ alone okay let's get on
[1:11:32] to something here so you see the fact is
[1:11:35] God's map is all on one page now all you
[1:11:37] people under 30 you you depend on our
[1:11:40] friend here to get from here to there
[1:11:42] it's real simple she knows everything
[1:11:44] she tells you just how to get there she
[1:11:45] can see through the clouds through the
[1:11:47] snow through the rain it's
[1:11:49] marvelous but used to be we had a
[1:11:51] mapbook to cost 12 95 and it's an
[1:11:55] alphabetical order so if you're going to
[1:11:57] go from South Carolina to Arizona you
[1:12:00] had to keep flipping through see how to
[1:12:02] get there remember
[1:12:07] yeah but God's map is all on one page he

[1:12:12] he can see from the beginning of the end
[1:12:14] he knows all the details of your
[1:12:16] individual life he knows where you're

[1:12:19] be tonight what kind of trouble you're
[1:12:21] going to try to get into tonight or
[1:12:22] tomorrow he already sees all that and
[1:12:25] he's given you word to try to keep you
[1:12:27] balanced you see and
[1:12:30] so um you'll only be at peace when you
[1:12:33] fully surrender to God's spirit not to
[1:12:36] me not to the pastor not to the name of
[1:12:39] William brandom to the spirit of God you
[1:12:42] see yes Lord I Give You full control

[1:12:56] the the balance on the checkbook and all
[1:12:58] this kind of stuff it's nothing but
[1:13:00] problems so where are we at chapter 8
[1:13:03] verse4 therefore they were scattered
[1:13:06] abroad and every um and went everywhere
[1:13:09] preaching the word hm so these are all
[1:13:12] preachers I don't think so they're
[1:13:14] people just like you you see and they
[1:13:17] took off preaching the word the apostles
[1:13:19] stayed at Jerusalem and um they were
[1:13:23] Believers in the way living their
[1:13:26] testimony
[1:13:27] okay just live your message that's what
[1:13:30] brother random said just just live it
[1:13:33] you don't have to argue it and you know
[1:13:35] slam everybody just live your
[1:13:37] message um how many of you came from the
[1:13:40] Catholic Church let's see be real honest
[1:13:42] okay you remember back then you had
[1:13:44] Francis of AIS remember that Saint well
[1:13:48] he's there so he was a preacher 900
[1:13:50] years ago over in Italy brother R said
[1:13:52] he was a preacher of the gospel and he
[1:13:55] said preach
[1:13:57] always comma use words when necessary
[1:14:01] that's what these people were doing they
[1:14:03] preached they went and preached
[1:14:04] everywhere yeah they were just living
[1:14:06] their life now when your sisters go to
[1:14:08] Walmart and you're the only one in the
[1:14:10] store with a long dress and with a long
[1:14:13] hair there's some people take exception
[1:14:15] to it oh don't touch me well they're on
[1:14:18] their way to hell now the ones that say
[1:14:20] God bless you where you go to church
[1:14:22] they might be taking the first step in
[1:14:23] the right direction you're preaching
[1:14:25] just by showing up you don't have to
[1:14:27] argue you don't have to have big sign in
[1:14:29] no none of that
[1:14:31] no so um these were the first
[1:14:34] missionaries of the New Movement they
[1:14:36] traveled far away and they were only
[1:14:38] preaching only living amongst Jews
[1:14:40] because Jesus told them in chapter 10
[1:14:42] only to the house of Israel okay that's
[1:14:45] the whole thing Jesus came to Israel for
[1:14:48] Redemption okay then we'll see later how
[1:14:51] it spread to us but anyway they only
[1:14:54] lived there so they went to Phoenicia
[1:14:55] which is Lebanon 120 Mi North they sail
[1:14:58] over to Cyprus the island 150 miles and
[1:15:02] they went up to Turkey to Antioch 100
[1:15:04] about 300 miles that was the size of
[1:15:06] their world they knew Rome was over
[1:15:08] there and Spain was a little farther
[1:15:09] they had no concept of the rest of it
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:12] know so over in verse five of chapter 8
[1:15:16] we have a man by the name of Phillip now
[1:15:20] this is one of the helpers of chapter 6
[1:15:21] verse5 not Phil the Apostle of Matthew
[1:15:25] 10 and so he felt inspired to go up to
[1:15:28] Samaria less than 50 Mi North and he was
[1:15:32] having great meeting up there big tent
[1:15:33] meeting let's say Big Revival and many
[1:15:36] were healed there was great joy H but
[1:15:38] every Revival produces
[1:15:42] Twins and so amongst the people
[1:15:44] listening amongst the people of the town
[1:15:46] there there's a man called Simon the
[1:15:47] Sorcerer he was a magician he had the
[1:15:50] crystal ball and he had the cards and so
[1:15:51] forth right and and uh using magic he
[1:15:56] was from the Dark Side he was involved
[1:15:57] in the
[1:15:58] occult and in verse 9 giving out other
[1:16:01] words announcing that he was the great
[1:16:03] one and this man was so obsessed with
[1:16:06] power and self-importance that the
[1:16:08] people said this man is the great power
[1:16:12] of God what else who else can do this
[1:16:15] kind of stuff you know so he had many
[1:16:17] followers no one seemed to criticize him
[1:16:20] it's all in your Bible and so um and uh
[1:16:25] but they rather marveled at the supposed
[1:16:26] importance but God wasn't part of the
[1:16:28] picture so when the people uh you know
[1:16:32] these same followers when they heard the
[1:16:33] preaching of the word over there in the
[1:16:35] name of Jesus Christ and signs and
[1:16:37] wonders many of them are believed and
[1:16:40] were baptized even Simon you know um
[1:16:44] look at verse 16 what say
[1:16:47] here uh let's see where we at the
[1:16:50] apostles wrot Jerusalem okay they heard
[1:16:52] about the about Samaria but anyway they
[1:16:55] heard that there was something going on
[1:16:57] so they came down Peter and John came
[1:16:59] down and they um uh they were laying
[1:17:02] hands on the people who reive the Holy
[1:17:04] Ghost they were only baptized in the
[1:17:06] name of the Lord Jesus and Simon was
[1:17:09] right around there at the same time and
[1:17:12] so uh when he saw what was going on you
[1:17:16] know uh he saw the results of laying on
[1:17:19] of hands of these two important people
[1:17:21] he offered them money huh we're back to
[1:17:23] the same old thing the dirty money he
[1:17:27] said you know maybe I can buy this magic
[1:17:28] trick you know yeah look at verse 19
[1:17:31] where it says um give me also this power
[1:17:35] that on whomsoever I Lay My Hands he may
[1:17:37] receive the Holy Ghost huh really of
[1:17:40] course it wouldn't be for free would it
[1:17:42] like Peter and John no no they'd be a
[1:17:44] little bit of money trade hands and um
[1:17:48] and so in other words I I could help you
[1:17:50] guys and and of course the ministry
[1:17:52] wouldn't be for free he heard the truth
[1:17:55] he wanted to be a part of the move of
[1:17:57] God but just couldn't detach himself
[1:17:59] from the old Simon he's right there he
[1:18:02] couldn't let the old Simon die and yield
[1:18:04] himself so God anointed a preacher of
[1:18:06] all things preacher of the Gospel to
[1:18:09] shake this man into reality verse 20 but
[1:18:11] Peter said thy money perish with thee
[1:18:15] because you have thought that the gift
[1:18:17] of God may be purchased with money you
[1:18:19] have neither part nor lot in this matter
[1:18:21] for thy heart is not right in the sight
[1:18:24] of God okay shook him and therefore
[1:18:28] repent of this thy wickedness and pray
[1:18:31] to God if perhaps the thought of thy
[1:18:34] heart might be forgiven you for I
[1:18:37] perceive that thou art in the gall of
[1:18:39] bitterness and in the bond of iniquity
[1:18:42] pretty strong words another translation
[1:18:44] says I see that you're poisoned by
[1:18:46] bitterness and bound by iniquity so he
[1:18:48] discerned his case then Simon
[1:18:51] immediately asked for prayer verse 2
[1:18:53] before and we don't know any more about
[1:18:54] it he may be there I don't
[1:18:56] know so in the midst of this wonderful
[1:18:59] Revival that's going on up in Samaria
[1:19:01] north of Jerusalem the angel of the Lord
[1:19:03] appears to Phillip amen you know
[1:19:06] everything's going fine in verse 26 and
[1:19:08] the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip
[1:19:10] arise and go towards the South unto the
[1:19:13] way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
[1:19:15] Gaza which is Desert so anybody that's
[1:19:18] you know been awake the last few weeks
[1:19:20] Gaza is in the news every day
[1:19:23] because that's where the bad boys live
[1:19:26] that's the boys that killed Jews and so
[1:19:28] forth it's still there and so uh he's
[1:19:32] calling him 70 M Southwest of Jerusalem
[1:19:36] go down that way go that way he didn't
[1:19:39] explain he said get up and
[1:19:41] go so brother Braham says God doesn't
[1:19:44] tell His prophets everything prophets
[1:19:46] aren't God they don't know everything
[1:19:48] they know what God shows them you know
[1:19:51] but God does arrange the details
[1:19:53] so in verse 27 we have a very important
[1:19:56] man he's a Believer he's a black man
[1:19:59] he's unmarried he's officer of the royal
[1:20:02] household household of the of Egypt he's
[1:20:06] actually The Treasure of the king
[1:20:08] Kingdom of Ethiopia yeah okay this comes
[1:20:11] from the time of Solomon
[1:20:15] remember yeah the Queen of Sheba she had
[1:20:18] heard and now she's going to go see now
[1:20:21] you guys that are musicians go look for
[1:20:25] uh I think it's a box Arrangement the
[1:20:28] arrival of the Queen of Sheba it's a
[1:20:30] three minute composition it is beautiful
[1:20:33] and fits right with brother R's
[1:20:34] description of her arriving okay arrival
[1:20:37] of the Queen of Sheba so she was
[1:20:40] convinced and she took the religion back
[1:20:43] to uh
[1:20:45] Ethiopia and so from then on there were
[1:20:48] people in Ethiopia worshiping the one
[1:20:50] true God according to the you know
[1:20:53] religion and so forth of the Jews
[1:20:55] because it was real at the time and
[1:20:56] that's what they were doing so here we
[1:20:58] are clear over here in the New Testament
[1:21:00] this man was The Treasure of the Kingdom
[1:21:02] he had been up to Jerusalem to worship
[1:21:04] he's on his way
[1:21:05] home thousands of people had done that
[1:21:09] and so he's um he's reading you know
[1:21:12] what would we would call A Spoken Word
[1:21:14] Book in verse 28 yeah uh here in verse
[1:21:19] 28 um he's returning and reading from
[1:21:22] Isaiah the prophet and the spirit said
[1:21:25] unto Philip go get close to the Chariot
[1:21:28] and join thyself to The Chariot so now
[1:21:30] here he boom he's down here 70 miles
[1:21:32] here's a chariot out there about 50
[1:21:33] yards hey go up and get close to it so
[1:21:36] he gets close to the to the
[1:21:38] Chariot and um he um he says uh do you
[1:21:44] do you understand what you're reading
[1:21:45] because he heard him reading out loud
[1:21:46] you know and so he uh he goes up there
[1:21:49] he was obedient he was not questioning
[1:21:51] he wasn't worrying
[1:21:53] and um he runs up alongside he heard him
[1:21:57] reading out loud Hi how are you do you
[1:22:01] understand what you're
[1:22:02] reading good question verse 31 and he
[1:22:06] said how can I accept a man a preacher a
[1:22:11] prophet or you know evangelist somebody
[1:22:14] should guide me and he desired Philip
[1:22:17] that he could come up and sit with him
[1:22:18] also now Philip's in the nice Chariot
[1:22:21] and it's not no Volkswagen it's it's
[1:22:22] nice Chariot with nice horses this is a
[1:22:24] government official you know so he's in
[1:22:27] the Chariot now and um here's the
[1:22:30] prophetic manuscript from Isaiah
[1:22:32] 53 and verse 32 U where's it at and the
[1:22:36] place in scripture who he was reading he
[1:22:38] was led as a sheep to the slaughter and
[1:22:40] so forth and um down there in 33 for his
[1:22:46] life was taken from him and the unic
[1:22:48] says to Phillip now tell me please um
[1:22:53] uh who's the prophet speaking of himself
[1:22:55] or some other
[1:22:57] man well as a person knew to these words
[1:23:01] and the unit answered Philip and you
[1:23:03] know who who is he talking about so when
[1:23:06] you give the microphone to the to the
[1:23:09] Evangelist watch out so from that point
[1:23:13] he starts telling him and they got as
[1:23:16] far as baptism yeah amazing
[1:23:20] huh without missing the opportunity and
[1:23:23] they got to baptism and the man said
[1:23:25] well well here's some water what what
[1:23:28] hinders look at
[1:23:30] 37 and Philip said if thou believest
[1:23:33] with all thine heart thou mayest be
[1:23:35] baptized and he answers that I believe
[1:23:38] that Jesus Christ the son of God and he
[1:23:40] commanded the Chariot to stand still and
[1:23:43] they went both of them down into the
[1:23:44] water both Philip and the unic and he
[1:23:47] baptized him we're not going to get into
[1:23:49] any arguments but by immersion and um
[1:23:53] when they come up out of the water the
[1:23:54] spirit of the lord caught philli away
[1:23:57] and the unit couldn't see him no more
[1:23:59] and he went on his way rejoicing back
[1:24:02] home
[1:24:04] well um this obedient
[1:24:09] evangelist experienced time travel amen
[1:24:13] okay he baptized the first African
[1:24:16] convert and he preached to three
[1:24:18] different ethnic groups in three
[1:24:20] different locations in one day wow
[1:24:23] go read
[1:24:25] it we have no title for it today but God
[1:24:28] put him there you know well the story
[1:24:32] goes on and it's we only been at this 44
[1:24:36] minutes we got time so chapter 9 verse
[1:24:39] one and Saul yet breathing out
[1:24:41] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[1:24:43] Disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[1:24:46] priest and desired of him you know I
[1:24:48] need letters I want to Damascus and you
[1:24:50] know if there be any found of this this
[1:24:52] way anybody even looks like a Christian
[1:24:54] whether it be men or women might be
[1:24:56] bring them bound back to Jerusalem so
[1:24:59] Saul here's a fiery young Pharisee
[1:25:03] legalist I mean it's got to be what the
[1:25:05] prophets said or nothing filled with
[1:25:07] hatred and murder against the Disciples
[1:25:11] of our Lord and see there's a clue when
[1:25:14] you have people today well we got to say
[1:25:16] exactly what brother R said and they'll
[1:25:18] fight you for it and they'll kill you if
[1:25:20] they could something's not right that's
[1:25:22] right the word brings
[1:25:24] peace but this doesn't you
[1:25:27] see and so here he was uh he persecuted
[1:25:31] the new Believers our brothers and
[1:25:33] sisters he didn't wait around for orders
[1:25:36] when the na mail comes no he was over
[1:25:37] there begging for it you see anybody
[1:25:39] associated with the way would be
[1:25:41] arrested brought back to headquarters
[1:25:43] Jerusalem and um so the people they left
[1:25:46] seeking better surroundings now this
[1:25:48] could have been four years after the
[1:25:49] resurrection I don't know but um God
[1:25:53] allowed this persecution of the
[1:25:55] Believers that they might scatter and uh
[1:25:59] begin to bring order to what he said to
[1:26:01] the ends of the Earth you know so you
[1:26:04] might not understand how certain things
[1:26:05] are going to happen because there
[1:26:07] there's all kinds of promises you know
[1:26:09] we sang earlier about the you guys did
[1:26:10] about about the about the promises of
[1:26:12] God well guess what we spend all kinds
[1:26:14] of time on the positive promises and yah
[1:26:17] but there's negative promises
[1:26:19] also and they will also come to pass
[1:26:23] such as Matthew 24:24 somebody's going
[1:26:26] to rise up that's very knowledgeable
[1:26:28] with the message has it all together and
[1:26:31] steer people away gently and it's
[1:26:33] happening today amen so when you don't
[1:26:37] understand how things are going to
[1:26:38] happen just remember the sign be still
[1:26:42] I'm God I got it all figured out don't
[1:26:43] need your opinions you know God is in
[1:26:46] charge he doesn't need our opinions only
[1:26:49] our obedience so the this young Saul was
[1:26:53] a zealous government agent okay out
[1:26:57] looking for anybody that wasn't
[1:26:59] complying and uh no regard for human
[1:27:02] rights no problem with profiling and if
[1:27:05] you even looked like you were part of
[1:27:06] the way you know the way the truth and
[1:27:08] life there was torture prison probably
[1:27:11] death but he's on his way to Damascus
[1:27:14] because he heard there was some you know
[1:27:16] some of those Fanatics down there so
[1:27:18] he's got the arrest warrants and so
[1:27:20] forth but his his m message and his his
[1:27:23] uh his journey is interrupted by divine
[1:27:26] intervention verse three so I've looked
[1:27:30] back through the scripture into chapter
[1:27:32] 9 1-8 chapter 22 chapter 26 and we got a
[1:27:37] summary of his
[1:27:39] story so it's a bright hot sunny day
[1:27:42] okay it's desert they're eagerly moving
[1:27:45] towards Damascus about 130 mil Northeast
[1:27:49] of
[1:27:50] Jerusalem and a bright hot sunny day
[1:27:53] which means 100° over there and about
[1:27:56] noon all of a sudden a much brighter
[1:27:58] light
[1:27:59] appears okay it shined all around them
[1:28:02] knocked them all off their horses and
[1:28:05] now they're very confused this Fearless
[1:28:08] Commander Pharisee in charge of the
[1:28:10] anti-christian campaign is now fa down
[1:28:13] in the dirt oh we got a problem his
[1:28:16] uniform is all dirty and it looks like
[1:28:18] he's talking to himself oh it's got a
[1:28:21] real serious problem
[1:28:23] now they all saw the
[1:28:24] light and um they all fell off their
[1:28:27] horses they all heard some kind of noise
[1:28:30] but only Saul heard the voice in his
[1:28:33] language thank you God speaks to you in
[1:28:36] your
[1:28:37] language Saul Saul why are you
[1:28:40] persecuting me who are you I've been
[1:28:43] after these Christians you know Lord who
[1:28:46] are you and um but you see this was the
[1:28:50] brilliant light the power where's this
[1:28:51] coming from
[1:28:52] I am Jesus of Nazareth the one that
[1:28:54] you've been persecuting you know
[1:28:57] immediately what do you think flashed in
[1:28:59] his mind the death of Steven aha that's
[1:29:03] where it began you see immediately he
[1:29:06] was totally disarmed he had no more to
[1:29:07] say helpless even blind from the
[1:29:10] Brilliance of the glory of
[1:29:12] God and he yielded completely so if you
[1:29:16] are one of God's elect and we trust that
[1:29:17] everybody is I don't know I'm not a
[1:29:19] prophet I can't say you're going and
[1:29:20] you're not going but if you are going to
[1:29:22] God's elect he will hunt you down you
[1:29:25] can put on the front yeah fool your
[1:29:27] parents and fool the girlfriend all that
[1:29:30] nonsense God knows who you are and if
[1:29:32] you're one of his he will bring you in
[1:29:34] now you can come peacefully yes Lord I'm
[1:29:36] sorry or be like cracking a walnut or
[1:29:41] cracking something else he will get you
[1:29:44] you see so no matter what your ideas and
[1:29:46] your goals might be so Paul says well
[1:29:49] okay I'm finished what do you want me to
[1:29:50] do
[1:29:52] arise and go on into Damascus they were
[1:29:56] only two or three miles out of town
[1:29:58] going into Damascus he had a glorious
[1:30:00] conversion look at verse 8 uh where we
[1:30:04] at here eight and Saul Rose from the
[1:30:06] earth and when his eyes were open he saw
[1:30:09] no man but they led him by the hand and
[1:30:12] brought him to Damascus and he was there
[1:30:15] three days without sight neither did he
[1:30:18] eat or drink okay you try that starting
[1:30:22] you know 1:00 see if you can go three
[1:30:24] days without drink or food God was with
[1:30:28] him you see he's already figuring things
[1:30:32] out verse 10 and uh there was a certain
[1:30:34] disciple of Damascus named ananas and to
[1:30:37] him the Lord said in a vision an anas
[1:30:40] and he said behold I'm here Lord and the
[1:30:42] Lord said unto him arise go down to the
[1:30:45] street called straight look for the
[1:30:47] house of Judas there's one guy there
[1:30:50] Saul of Tarsus behold he's over there
[1:30:53] praying and he has seen in a vision
[1:30:56] already a man named ananas that's you
[1:30:58] sir coming in putting his hands on him
[1:31:02] that he might receive his sight H very
[1:31:05] interesting see God works on both ends
[1:31:08] God doesn't just tell you yeah this or
[1:31:10] that no he works on both
[1:31:12] ends and uh he prepares everything now
[1:31:14] this ananas you know we always think of
[1:31:16] the the deceptive property owner in
[1:31:18] chapter 5 uh and there's another one
[1:31:20] over in chapter 23 self-righteous high
[1:31:22] priest and so forth but this ananas in
[1:31:24] verse 10 he's a Believer a follower of
[1:31:27] the way and he had heard all about
[1:31:30] Pharisee Saul they that news got around
[1:31:33] and he was very cautious look at verse
[1:31:35] 12 uh okay he's seeing you coming and uh
[1:31:39] then ananas said Lord I've heard of this
[1:31:43] man and how much evil he has done to thy
[1:31:45] Saints in Jerusalem and here he has
[1:31:47] Authority from the high priest to bind
[1:31:49] all that call on thy name in other words
[1:31:51] he's shaken you you know the Lord said
[1:31:53] go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
[1:31:57] unto me really to hear uh to Bear my
[1:32:01] name before the Gentiles and kings and
[1:32:04] children of Israel for I will show him
[1:32:07] great things that he must suffer for my
[1:32:09] name's
[1:32:10] sake the gospel started West with this
[1:32:13] man amen up to then it's only Israel
[1:32:17] only the Israelites but here he says the
[1:32:20] Gentiles it's going to come all the way
[1:32:22] over
[1:32:23] here so um the um you know he's very
[1:32:29] cautious God says go so he went you know
[1:32:33] put on his hat went out found the
[1:32:34] address and there's a blind man kneeling
[1:32:37] down
[1:32:38] praying no questions simply goes
[1:32:41] straight in verse 17 and ananas he's
[1:32:45] still you know he's he's human he's
[1:32:47] maybe shaken a little bit but he did
[1:32:49] what God said he went his way entered
[1:32:52] into the house and putting his hands on
[1:32:54] him
[1:32:56] said brother Saul
[1:33:00] wow imagine what that was like this is
[1:33:03] the man that killed
[1:33:05] Grandma yeah brother Saul the Lord even
[1:33:09] Jesus um that appeared to thee in the
[1:33:12] way when thou camest he sent me that you
[1:33:15] might receive your sight and be filled
[1:33:17] with the Holy Ghost and immediately
[1:33:19] there fell from his eyes like scales he
[1:33:22] received his sight arose was
[1:33:25] baptized wow and when he had received
[1:33:29] meat he was strengthened and uh he was
[1:33:32] there certain days with the disciples in
[1:33:36] Damascus so things were happening fast
[1:33:40] okay he began to preach immediately
[1:33:42] there in Damascus and um uh he was
[1:33:45] totally consecrated to God God's grace
[1:33:48] can overcome anyone's background no
[1:33:51] matter who you are we don't have time to
[1:33:54] hear all your sad story and all the
[1:33:55] people you killed all the drugs forget
[1:33:57] it God brought you here repent now let's
[1:34:00] go forward amen so no matter what you've
[1:34:02] done I mean the Bible's full of people I
[1:34:05] know people in this Century that have
[1:34:07] committed horrible
[1:34:09] things but God reached and got them all
[1:34:13] that money they accumulated print books
[1:34:15] you know so God can do things you see
[1:34:19] and um he was converted and you know uh
[1:34:23] when God reaches you and you trust and
[1:34:26] Obey you can't continue with your goofy
[1:34:28] ideas and opinions Just Surrender I'm
[1:34:31] finished you know so Saul confounded you
[1:34:36] know these people that a few day days
[1:34:38] ago was his closest Associates and
[1:34:40] buddies now he's preaching against them
[1:34:42] he's inspired he knows the
[1:34:45] word so we're thankful that God has
[1:34:48] given us all these testimonies all these
[1:34:51] records you see so after a few days
[1:34:53] preaching in verse 23 says here and
[1:34:56] after many days were fulfilled the Jews
[1:34:58] took counsil how to kill him H this guy
[1:35:01] jumped ship he's with those guys we got
[1:35:02] to kill him too now you know and so um
[1:35:07] then um let's see 23 on to 24 where it
[1:35:10] says here
[1:35:12] uh but laying
[1:35:15] weight uh laying away was known their
[1:35:18] you know their their plan was known of
[1:35:20] Saul and they watch the gates day and
[1:35:22] night to kill him you see all the cities
[1:35:24] back then had a wall around them they
[1:35:26] didn't have airplanes they going to
[1:35:27] attack you got to come through the gates
[1:35:29] you seen the movies of the you know Past
[1:35:31] Times so they're watching these Gates
[1:35:33] okay watch for
[1:35:35] him and um then the disciples took him
[1:35:38] by night and led him over the wall in a
[1:35:40] basket H didn't go through the gate you
[1:35:42] know and when Saul was come to Jerusalem
[1:35:46] he uh say in other words he he checked
[1:35:48] it out how to join himself to the
[1:35:50] disciples but they were all afraid
[1:35:52] here's the mighty disciples they they
[1:35:54] they saw the resurrection saw all this
[1:35:56] stuff and they're afraid of this one man
[1:35:59] because they did not believe he was a
[1:36:00] disciple but Barnabas son of
[1:36:02] encouragement took him and brought him
[1:36:04] to the apostles and declared unto them
[1:36:07] how he had seen the Lord in the way and
[1:36:09] that he had spoken to him and so forth
[1:36:11] and give him the whole story and um and
[1:36:14] he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord
[1:36:16] Jesus and the disciples uh and disputed
[1:36:20] against the i s but they went about to
[1:36:23] slay him they just got to get him
[1:36:25] somehow you know because they're
[1:36:27] anointed to do that so he um uh they
[1:36:32] wanted to kill him that's the second
[1:36:33] attempt on his life already and people
[1:36:36] had such a hard time adjusting to
[1:36:39] change God's word is all about change
[1:36:42] brother Brown talks about it in the the
[1:36:44] symphony and how there's shifts in the
[1:36:45] music and so forth things happen you got
[1:36:47] to know your Bible you see and so you
[1:36:51] you know getting with God's program
[1:36:52] today receiving the revelation of the
[1:36:55] word you see anybody can read and repeat
[1:36:57] they're doing that in every Baptist
[1:36:58] Church in South Carolina this morning
[1:37:00] they're reading repeating but there's no
[1:37:02] life because they're not with program
[1:37:05] today you see they have to have the
[1:37:07] revelation of the word and so it'll live
[1:37:10] through you it'll make a difference so
[1:37:12] changing the scene while Saul was away
[1:37:14] and tripped to his hometown Peter and
[1:37:15] the other disciples were very busy in 32
[1:37:19] 33 through 35 healing of anaas paralyzed
[1:37:22] for8 years and um notice he didn't pray
[1:37:26] he simply spoke the word look at verse
[1:37:28] 34 of chapter nine see here and Peter
[1:37:32] said unto him anaus Jesus Christ makes
[1:37:36] thee whole arise make thy bed and he
[1:37:39] arose immediately and all that dwelt at
[1:37:41] Jerusalem all that dwelt at L and saon
[1:37:44] saw him and turned to the Lord we don't
[1:37:48] know if it was 100% but many of them
[1:37:50] turned to the Lord
[1:37:51] okay and then he went over and prayed
[1:37:54] for the for the Tabitha Dorcas the
[1:37:56] disciple you
[1:37:58] see the world is watching your life
[1:38:01] every day they're watching to see what
[1:38:03] how you're reacting to the current
[1:38:04] crisis we're not worried about stuff
[1:38:06] that happen 30 years ago we're worried
[1:38:08] about
[1:38:09] today we're attacking the Arabs
[1:38:12] something big is coming down watch out
[1:38:15] prices are going up and people are
[1:38:17] watching you see in John Chapter 13
[1:38:20] Jesus said now this is how they're all
[1:38:22] going to know that you're part of me not
[1:38:25] that you carry a Bible they all got
[1:38:26] Bibles not that you got William brand on
[1:38:28] your cell phone that's at least their
[1:38:29] problems but the way you treat each
[1:38:32] other the love that you have one to
[1:38:35] another that's how they'll know you're
[1:38:37] part of me you see now you take for
[1:38:40] example the Amish people they work
[1:38:42] together they help each other they're
[1:38:44] they're they're great you know to the
[1:38:46] part they know they they fulfill it I've
[1:38:49] got more respect for them than a lot of
[1:38:50] people carrying spoken word books
[1:38:52] because they work together they're
[1:38:54] they're true to the vision of 300 years
[1:38:57] ago but they're real you know that's
[1:38:59] right and so uh but we have been
[1:39:02] entrusted with the secrets of the
[1:39:04] Kingdom we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:06] if we're following the word of today and
[1:39:09] so just live what you know is true if
[1:39:12] you don't understand anything stick with
[1:39:14] it a little while God will reveal it to
[1:39:17] you okay now there's 28 chapters in Acts
[1:39:21] but we're not going to go through them
[1:39:22] today so here thank you for your
[1:39:27] attention and I will have to come
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:37] back let's
[1:39:50] stand
[1:39:53] you know I was struck
[1:39:55] with how relevant the book of Acts
[1:39:58] becomes when you look at it like that
[1:40:01] and you break it down line for
[1:40:04] line and you get to see in fact as I was
[1:40:09] deeply appreciating that today it's the
[1:40:12] same effect that I
[1:40:15] had watching
[1:40:18] the the one where just the whole um oh I
[1:40:22] can't think of it now words the life of
[1:40:24] Jesus chosen thank you brother Bradley
[1:40:27] yeah because it it it deals with the
[1:40:30] humanity side and you realize that that
[1:40:34] these people in the book of Acts we're
[1:40:37] just you and I and that something you
[1:40:41] know we we look at it we we we can't
[1:40:43] hardly there's a lot between the lines
[1:40:45] that you I just think on the other side
[1:40:48] that we're going to get a chance to
[1:40:50] interview these people and go wow you
[1:40:53] know I kind of I didn't catch that
[1:40:56] perspective and they go oh yeah well you
[1:40:57] know I that's why we thought you
[1:40:59] couldn't make it at the end time amen
[1:41:02] because it got too dark I think we're
[1:41:03] going to have a lot of aha moments Amen
[1:41:06] on the other side amen I I so appreciate
[1:41:10] that because it makes the gospel real
[1:41:14] you know I was I was just doing a quick
[1:41:16] cross reference as brother George was
[1:41:18] talking about the you know the
[1:41:21] translation brother Bram talks about how
[1:41:23] that you know when he brings up that
[1:41:25] Ethiopian unic up out of the water
[1:41:28] teleportation soon he's gone you know
[1:41:32] many many many miles away he's founded
[1:41:34] another place and uh you know I've I've
[1:41:38] I remember talking to um brother um
[1:41:42] brother Jim
[1:41:43] naichi Jim Copus they call him in Ghana
[1:41:47] he had an experience like that and he
[1:41:49] was actually doubting this is when he
[1:41:52] was doubting the supernatural wasn't
[1:41:54] even a Christian and he went to see they
[1:41:57] said there's some great holy man who
[1:41:59] sits up under a tree now that man was
[1:42:01] basically almost like a witch doctor and
[1:42:05] brother Jim said I I I came to him as a
[1:42:08] as an unbeliever you see there's that
[1:42:10] Spiritual Works on both sides there's
[1:42:12] Realms that you don't understand and and
[1:42:15] he said I I doubt you they say that you
[1:42:18] have all this power but I don't believe
[1:42:19] it and the old man looked up at him and
[1:42:23] he said take a hold of my cloak and
[1:42:25] brother Jim said I reached down and just
[1:42:28] grabbed his his cloak and he said the
[1:42:31] next thing I knew I was walking into a
[1:42:34] village about 50 miles
[1:42:36] away and he said just in in a moment and
[1:42:40] you know the these kinds of things are
[1:42:42] real and I was looking and and brother
[1:42:44] Bram talks about that that event and I
[1:42:46] was looking and you it's it's
[1:42:49] amazing that I could couldn't find just
[1:42:52] and I was just doing a quick just a
[1:42:54] quick reference as I was sitting there
[1:42:56] and I even made a note about it that I
[1:42:59] couldn't find any commentator who would
[1:43:01] even begin a knowledge most of them
[1:43:04] wouldn't even comment on that 40th verse
[1:43:06] it's like they just jumped it we don't
[1:43:07] talk about that and the other ones just
[1:43:10] you know there was two or three that
[1:43:11] said two or three of my favorites who
[1:43:13] said well you know it's probably just
[1:43:15] the leadership of the Lord he went on up
[1:43:16] the coastline and walked on I'm said wow
[1:43:18] that's not what I read I'm glad I can
[1:43:21] believe for the
[1:43:22] Supernatural friends that should work as
[1:43:24] just reading this morning brother
[1:43:25] brandham said those same things should
[1:43:27] be working among us because this is the
[1:43:29] hour of that complete restoration you
[1:43:32] know I was struck with the thought of
[1:43:34] how that such a simple statement that
[1:43:37] had such profound meaning to
[1:43:40] me and you know I don't know if you
[1:43:43] caught it brother George was talking
[1:43:44] about you know sometimes you'll get a
[1:43:45] plant and you've got a little label that
[1:43:48] tells you what it is or a lot of times
[1:43:49] where this really comes comes in as if
[1:43:51] you're buying seed and the seed has a
[1:43:53] label or a sticker that tells you what
[1:43:55] it is and uh but you're really not going
[1:43:57] to know till the flowers bloom it might
[1:44:01] tell you that it's you know pink
[1:44:03] impatience or purple this or that but
[1:44:06] until you actually see it Bloom you're
[1:44:08] not going to know and I mean you know
[1:44:11] you can have people say I'm a Christian
[1:44:13] but let me let me see what what it looks
[1:44:15] like when the flower blooms amen how
[1:44:18] many want to bloom the way the SE of God
[1:44:21] the way that the word of God tells us
[1:44:25] and and lastly I I just want to give you
[1:44:27] my my thoughts and Reflections I was
[1:44:29] thinking as brother George was going
[1:44:31] through that I love that kind of
[1:44:33] expository teaching where you're going
[1:44:35] verse by verse like that I do a lot of
[1:44:37] that online in the Book of
[1:44:40] Revelation
[1:44:41] but I I went back and I thought goodness
[1:44:46] gracious here is
[1:44:48] Stephen and for 50
[1:44:51] verses that's it's a good section
[1:44:54] through through a whole chapter Stephen
[1:44:57] is preaching to them a
[1:45:00] truth that's a little bit um it's it's a
[1:45:04] little
[1:45:05] bit not everything he's saying they want
[1:45:07] to hear he's talking about in the
[1:45:09] wilderness and the things that went on
[1:45:11] and you all know we don't have a perfect
[1:45:13] track
[1:45:14] record and he was saying that to all
[1:45:16] these Jewish leaders and they kind of
[1:45:17] like it's a little awkward and we're a
[1:45:20] little comfortable but it's the truth
[1:45:22] it's the truth we'll just have to keep
[1:45:23] going amen amen amen and then he comes
[1:45:27] down and after 50 verses of the truth
[1:45:31] and they're going along with it and then
[1:45:33] he just's three verses from 50 and then
[1:45:36] three verses and he's still telling the
[1:45:38] truth which of your fathers didn't
[1:45:41] didn't which which prophet didn't your
[1:45:43] fathers persecute and kill and that was
[1:45:45] the truth also but after 50 verses three
[1:45:48] verses sent them over the edge and they
[1:45:50] they and they martyred him you know it's
[1:45:54] amazing that the
[1:45:55] world when when brother Brandon would
[1:45:58] talk about you know the history of the
[1:46:01] church and those religious leaders they
[1:46:03] couldn't deny it they couldn't deny it
[1:46:06] and brother Brandon would talk about
[1:46:08] where you stood when we started out in
[1:46:10] Pentecost and look where we are now and
[1:46:12] it's a little bit inconvenient a little
[1:46:13] bit awkward but everybody's waiting on
[1:46:15] that gift to come but you know when
[1:46:18] brother Brandon began to really turn the
[1:46:20] and begin to tell them you're going to
[1:46:22] that is going to take you and lead you
[1:46:24] to the mark of the
[1:46:26] beast that's when they were I just say
[1:46:29] yeah shake the dust off I'll take every
[1:46:31] bit of it if you don't want it how many
[1:46:33] want the whole truth the truth the whole
[1:46:37] truth and nothing but the truth please
[1:46:40] thank you that's what I want I I don't
[1:46:43] want to hide behind you know my own
[1:46:46] weaknesses and ups and downs I just say
[1:46:48] Lord here I am just lay L it out to me I
[1:46:51] just want to know just give it to me
[1:46:53] straight so that at least I can know
[1:46:55] where I stand and I can get myself right
[1:46:58] I want to be right you want to be right
[1:47:00] are you glad for a message that didn't
[1:47:03] pull any punches and tells the truth and
[1:47:06] because there is a not many just like in
[1:47:09] the book of Acts the majority didn't
[1:47:11] want to hear it but there was a small
[1:47:13] minority there's one man from
[1:47:15] Ethiopia and obviously he's searching
[1:47:18] for something in his life because he's
[1:47:19] reading the word of God I've been there
[1:47:23] reading the word of God Amen sounds like
[1:47:26] we're going to sing some more that
[1:47:27] brother Tony go ahead let's sing
[1:47:30] it and then one day oh
