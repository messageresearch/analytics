[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] so
[0:28] do
[0:32] [Music]
[1:26] [Music]
[2:35] you
[4:40] not our purpose our purpose is
[4:44] for the ministry of the word to this
[4:47] world
[4:48] that is our purpose
[5:16] sacrifice so there's no need for a
[5:19] priestly order to
[5:21] offer sacrifices on a continual basis
[5:24] in that sense number two there's a new
[5:27] covenant isn't
[5:28] the new covenant is an inner teacher
[5:31] that's given
[5:33] to each and every one of us there is an
[5:36] outward teacher there is a
[5:38] teaching gift but that teaching gift is
[5:42] different than the other
[5:43] than in the old testament it was all
[5:45] outward the teaching gift
[5:47] has an advantage now is that there is an
[5:50] inside
[5:51] teacher giving personal revelation
[5:55] to every single believer you don't need
[5:57] to go through
[5:59] the rabbi to get to christ
[6:02] you have to come to christ personally
[6:07] in a personal revelation and there's a
[6:09] teacher
[6:10] inside of you when the spirit of truth
[6:12] is come he will guide you
[6:14] into all truth
[6:17] first corinthians 12 uh i'm skipping
[6:20] number two number three
[6:22] we are all called to ministry through
[6:24] the spirit dwelling within us
[6:26] number four the true church is an
[6:28] invisible
[6:29] mystical body of christ that was one of
[6:32] them that we really didn't cover
[6:34] and number five we are all equal
[6:38] in christ and have equal access in
[6:41] christ
[6:42] so first corinthians 12 7 i'm just going
[6:45] to cover this
[6:46] ministry portion of it briefly again i
[6:50] i was really struck by one of the quotes
[6:53] that i read last week and i want to
[6:54] be continually struck by it because it's
[6:58] it's incredible first corinthians 12 7
[7:01] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[7:03] given to every man
[7:05] to profit with all profit with all means
[7:08] the common good or for the common
[7:11] benefit in other words
[7:12] every single person that's baptized
[7:16] into the body of christ by the holy
[7:18] ghost
[7:19] has the manifestation of the spirit in
[7:22] order
[7:23] to edify the rest of the body
[7:26] every single person has access to
[7:30] the gifts of the spirit right
[7:33] so we're called to a spiritual
[7:36] priesthood
[7:37] ministry to represent god to a dying
[7:39] world
[7:40] and to one another so from the church
[7:44] ages book this is the this is the quote
[7:46] that just uh
[7:47] floored me last week from the ephesian
[7:51] church age
[7:52] paul saw it coming but he warned them
[7:54] about this subtle priesthood
[7:56] that would come and take over with its
[7:58] false doctrines he knew they would
[8:00] implement a way of worship that excluded
[8:02] the people
[8:03] from any part in a holy spirit ministry
[8:06] and even right today among those who
[8:07] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[8:10] there is not too much freedom in the
[8:12] laity
[8:13] and the best we can see is a few
[8:14] preachers with inspired preaching while
[8:16] the flock just sits there and tries to
[8:18] absorb it
[8:20] this is a far cry from paul who said
[8:22] that when we all came together
[8:23] all had the leading of the spirit and
[8:25] all participated in spiritual worship
[8:28] and the church corporate has never
[8:30] learned this lesson from the scripture
[8:32] nor from history every time god gives a
[8:35] visitation of the holy spirit and people
[8:37] get free after a while
[8:39] they bind themselves right back to the
[8:41] very thing they came out of
[8:43] when luther came out of catholicism the
[8:45] people stayed free for a while but when
[8:47] he died the people simply organized what
[8:48] they thought he believed
[8:50] and set up their own creeds and ideas
[8:52] and repudiated anyone who said opposite
[8:54] to what they said
[8:56] they went right back to catholicism with
[8:58] a little different form and right today
[8:59] many lutherans are ready to go all the
[9:01] way back
[9:02] oh yes in revelation 17 that old
[9:05] had many daughters these daughters are
[9:06] just like mother they set the word aside
[9:09] deny the work of the spirit of god
[9:11] subjugate the laity
[9:12] and make it impossible for the laity to
[9:14] worship god unless they come through
[9:16] them
[9:17] or through their pattern which is
[9:18] nothing but a blueprint
[9:20] of unbelief from satan
[9:24] himself amen we're all called
[9:27] to be partakers in the spiritual worship
[9:31] that isn't just sitting in the pew and
[9:33] shouting amen when the preacher says
[9:35] something that you like
[9:37] i know i know that sometimes that's
[9:38] maybe presented that way
[9:40] not here but in some places spiritual
[9:44] worship
[9:45] is what he is what he's talking about is
[9:48] participating in
[9:49] the holy spirit ministry right
[9:55] in the ministry explained brother
[9:56] branham says in 1956 then when you come
[9:58] become in the body of christ then
[10:02] there's nine
[10:02] spiritual gifts that goes in every local
[10:05] church body
[10:06] and i want you to notice what he says in
[10:08] this next sentence because it's
[10:10] it's i believe it's a important and it's
[10:12] correction that
[10:13] i i'm receiving he says and those are
[10:17] gifts that you're to pray for
[10:19] so when's the last time you prayed for
[10:23] those nine spiritual gifts if we haven't
[10:26] we should
[10:28] we should be praying for that those are
[10:31] the gifts that you're to pray for to
[10:32] pray for the gift of speaking with
[10:34] tongues or the gift of interpretation in
[10:36] tongues or these other gifts that goes
[10:37] into the church
[10:39] pray for the gifts of healing and pray
[10:40] for the gifts of miracles and so forth
[10:43] that's the ones that you pray for now
[10:45] part of that is making a distinction
[10:47] between the five-fold ministry and the
[10:48] nine gifts of the spirit five-fold
[10:50] ministry don't pray for that
[10:51] you're ordained to that right you don't
[10:54] desire that
[10:55] but paul says about spiritual gifts
[10:58] earnestly
[10:59] desire the best gifts that is why
[11:01] brother branham says
[11:02] pray for them because how do you express
[11:05] earnest desire spiritual desire
[11:07] by praying for that i believe that we
[11:11] should be
[11:12] praying for that more i believe i should
[11:14] be
[11:15] if you don't want to that's fine but i
[11:17] want i want to pray for it because i
[11:19] want to see
[11:20] the manifestation of the spirit not just
[11:24] have a big party but so that we would
[11:27] ex see that edification that
[11:30] every portion of the body is supposed to
[11:34] be
[11:34] supplying it's not just a
[11:37] separated ministry preaching and
[11:40] edifying it's each one of you
[11:42] when you have the holy spirit are called
[11:47] to have that manifestation those
[11:48] manifestations in your life
[11:51] for the common good for edification
[11:54] not to be a big somebody not to say yeah
[11:56] i have i have a gift
[11:58] remember the real gift is to get
[11:59] yourself out pray
[12:01] and get yourself out of the way and let
[12:04] the
[12:05] let the lord move ephesians 4
[12:08] 11 through 16.
[12:12] i want to read this this whole portion
[12:14] because
[12:16] it's important i've said it before but
[12:17] i'm going to repeat it
[12:19] and he gave some apostles and some
[12:21] prophets and some evangelists and some
[12:23] pastors and teachers
[12:25] for the perfecting or the equipping
[12:29] of the saints for the for for the the
[12:32] dressing and preparation of the saints
[12:35] for the work of the ministry for the
[12:38] edifying of the body of christ
[12:40] so that's a continuation so the fivefold
[12:43] ministry is given for what
[12:44] for the equipping preparation
[12:49] of the saints what is that given for
[12:53] for the work of the ministry
[12:56] okay so the saints have the work
[13:00] of the ministry amen for what purpose
[13:05] so they can say hey look at me i got
[13:08] great gifts
[13:09] for the edifying the building up
[13:13] of the body of christ see that's a
[13:16] continuation
[13:17] i'm going to repeat it i want you to i
[13:19] want this to be memorized
[13:22] it's in because it's important otherwise
[13:23] you'll get it out of order
[13:26] you'll see it as there's an anointed
[13:28] ministry and we sit
[13:29] and we just take it in and brother
[13:32] branham condemns
[13:34] that model as the only model is that
[13:36] part of it
[13:37] absolutely that's part of it he's not
[13:39] saying that isn't part of it
[13:41] he's just saying that isn't the only
[13:42] thing that shouldn't be the only thing
[13:46] that we're focusing on period
[13:49] fivefold ministry is giving for the
[13:51] equipping the dressing
[13:53] equipping it's speaking of giving the
[13:54] art like giving
[13:56] armor to the military giving armor
[13:58] giving a sword
[14:00] etc in other words the preaching there
[14:03] is laying the word out
[14:05] so now the people have the word in their
[14:07] hands
[14:08] now the people have the word in their
[14:10] hearts to do what
[14:13] for the work of the ministry
[14:17] to build up the body of christ
[14:21] till we all come in the unity of the
[14:22] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[14:24] god
[14:25] unto a perfect man till we all we
[14:28] all every part of the body
[14:33] till we all come in the unity of the
[14:34] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[14:36] god
[14:37] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[14:39] the stature of the fullness of christ
[14:43] that we henceforth be no more children
[14:46] it doesn't say that the ministry be
[14:47] henceforth no more children
[14:49] that we every part of the body
[14:53] be no more children tossed to and fro
[14:55] and carried about with every wind of
[14:56] doctrine by the slight of men and
[14:57] cunning craftiness
[14:59] whereby they lie and wait to deceive
[15:02] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[15:04] up into him in all things which is the
[15:06] head even
[15:07] christ i want you to look at this
[15:10] closely verse 16
[15:12] from whom the whole body the whole body
[15:16] fitly joined together and compacted
[15:20] by that which every joint
[15:23] supplies every joint supplies so every
[15:28] person that's baptized by the spirit
[15:31] into that
[15:32] one body has something that they
[15:36] are supplying to the rest of the body
[15:40] a gift a ministry to
[15:43] the rest of the body
[15:46] according to the effectual working in
[15:49] the measure
[15:50] of every part of the effectual
[15:53] working the the the work that has
[15:56] it has an impact it has fruit that's
[15:59] what effectual is speaking of
[16:01] effectual working in the measure of
[16:04] every part maketh
[16:05] increase of the body unto
[16:08] the edifying of itself
[16:11] in love it is a whole
[16:15] it is the whole body of christ that has
[16:18] something
[16:19] to offer every person has to be filled
[16:21] with the spirit
[16:22] every person has to be led by the spirit
[16:25] every person has to be
[16:26] growing in maturity personally
[16:30] regardless of what everybody else around
[16:32] you is now
[16:34] i'm gonna i'm skipping ahead just a
[16:36] moment because this verse
[16:38] is contains some of what i want to talk
[16:40] about
[16:41] there is a visible church
[16:44] and there is an invisible or mystical
[16:48] church and we we don't want to get that
[16:51] confused and sometimes we get that
[16:53] confused and we
[16:54] result in disappointment and a lack of
[16:57] faith
[16:58] here what we have a gathering here is a
[16:59] visible church
[17:02] right and that we we baptize people
[17:07] we minister the word to people we have
[17:10] communion and foot washing
[17:12] we marry people etc that's the visible
[17:16] church
[17:17] doing visible things and all that is for
[17:20] the purpose
[17:21] of edification but that isn't exactly
[17:25] the church that christ
[17:29] is going to do these things in what is
[17:31] he doing it in because every church is
[17:33] made up of what brother brahma says
[17:36] believers make believers and
[17:39] unbelievers okay so i'm we're not it's
[17:41] not for us to figure out or understand
[17:43] who
[17:44] is we minister and love everybody
[17:46] exactly the same it doesn't change
[17:48] anything
[17:49] it's just a fact the visible church is
[17:52] made up of people who are believers and
[17:54] who are not believers
[17:56] people who stay and people who leave
[18:00] right so and he's not trying to perfect
[18:03] bethel tabernacle or
[18:07] happy valley church of jesus christ he's
[18:09] not
[18:10] concerned necessarily he's concerned
[18:12] with
[18:13] that and how we respond a real believer
[18:16] will go to church
[18:18] a troop baptized in the holy spirit
[18:20] knows the bible says to me
[18:22] i need to be in fellowship with other
[18:24] believers so we go to a visible church
[18:28] where the word is ministered where
[18:30] baptism takes place and the things that
[18:32] god's commands take place
[18:34] but he's not perfecting this group of
[18:37] people
[18:38] he's perfecting individuals in the
[18:40] mystical
[18:41] body of christ so when we come and we
[18:45] say i'm so
[18:46] disappointed in bethel tabernacle
[18:49] they didn't do this they didn't do that
[18:54] where are you in this ministry because
[18:57] again
[18:58] if you look at it as the church isn't
[19:00] doing what i want it to do
[19:02] the pastor isn't doing what i want it to
[19:04] do the way i personally look at it
[19:07] is i have a calling from god
[19:10] personally and it's not
[19:13] brother jason is not in charge of my
[19:16] calling
[19:18] i'm not in charge of brother jason's
[19:19] calling neither are you
[19:21] i'm no one is in charge of brother
[19:24] luther's
[19:25] calling in this mystical body now he's a
[19:27] deacon in a visible church
[19:29] that's something different right but the
[19:33] the the spiritual mystical body
[19:36] that i am called into i'm here
[19:40] to have an effect on you
[19:43] right i'm not here to say
[19:46] this visible church must meet my needs
[19:49] yes sure it should baptize me
[19:51] baptize my family marry my kids etc
[19:55] but that's all outward he's not
[19:58] perfecting
[19:59] outward you guys baptize i mean we want
[20:01] to baptize according to scripture
[20:04] what i'm saying is he's not perfecting
[20:07] our
[20:08] outward programs he's perfecting you on
[20:10] the
[20:11] inside he's bringing you on the inside
[20:15] into the unity with the spiritual
[20:18] mystical body of christ so you
[20:22] as an individual you have something to
[20:24] bring
[20:25] an effectual working within the body of
[20:28] that mystical
[20:30] body and we're all surrounded by
[20:33] three kinds of believers not for us to
[20:35] figure out
[20:36] that's okay but our if our vision is
[20:39] this visible church has to meet my needs
[20:42] your vision is incorrect you're looking
[20:46] at of course we want to go to a place
[20:47] that feeds us
[20:49] obviously not saying that's that that we
[20:52] wouldn't
[20:54] but i'm saying is if it feeds you are we
[20:57] looking at everything as a critical eye
[20:59] like
[20:59] it's all about me because it isn't all
[21:02] about you
[21:03] it's all about what you can bring by the
[21:06] spirit of god dwelling
[21:07] inside of you for others
[21:12] that's what gifts that's what this body
[21:14] is all about and it's your connection
[21:17] with him
[21:18] and our connection with him is what
[21:20] connects us together
[21:22] it's you we can be connected together as
[21:24] a visible body
[21:26] and we can work so hard to have a
[21:27] beautiful relationships
[21:30] amongst each other without god
[21:36] there's there's corporations that have a
[21:39] beautiful
[21:40] management structure and they have
[21:43] wonderful harmony
[21:44] but that is not what god is looking for
[21:47] god likes that of course
[21:48] but that's not what he's coming back for
[21:51] he's coming for a mystical
[21:52] spiritual body and
[21:56] until we've really have that revelation
[21:59] for ourself
[22:02] we can't operate properly in the body
[22:06] and under the leadership and headship of
[22:10] christ
[22:16] uh romans 8 26
[22:22] likewise the spirit also helps our
[22:24] infirmities for we know not what we
[22:26] should pray for as we ought but the
[22:27] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[22:30] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[22:32] the spirit intercedes
[22:35] through the body through that mystical
[22:38] body
[22:38] by doing what by giving us groanings
[22:42] giving us burdens that we don't even
[22:45] know how to ex
[22:46] really true express on our own but
[22:49] he through us makes intercession
[22:54] in other words this christ is the only
[22:57] mediator right
[22:59] he's really the only intercessor he's on
[23:01] the throne
[23:02] interceding the spirit his his spirit
[23:05] the spirit of his son the spirit of
[23:06] jesus christ is here working amongst us
[23:10] and how is he interceding how is christ
[23:12] interceding
[23:14] many times he's doing it through us
[23:16] through our prayers
[23:18] through the things that he the groanings
[23:20] that he puts within us
[23:24] galatians 6 1 and 2.
[23:28] brethren if any if a man be overtaken in
[23:31] a fault
[23:31] you which are spiritual restore such a
[23:34] one
[23:34] in the spirit of meekness considering
[23:36] thyself lest thou also
[23:38] be tempted bury one another's burdens
[23:41] and so
[23:42] fulfill the law of christ
[23:45] so again this is a part of our spiritual
[23:48] ministry someone that's overtaken in a
[23:50] fault go to them
[23:51] in the spirit of meekness and restore
[23:53] them that's
[23:55] part of the spiritual ministry it's
[23:57] interesting it doesn't say you which are
[23:59] part of the fivefold ministry go and
[24:01] restore them
[24:03] he doesn't we're all to do that i think
[24:05] often
[24:06] people will see well this the the the
[24:08] shepherd goes after
[24:10] the 90 the one and leaves the 90 and 9
[24:14] behind
[24:15] this pastor is not a good pastor because
[24:17] he didn't go after those people
[24:24] you're mixed up the spirit of jesus
[24:26] christ
[24:28] is in every single believer you which
[24:31] are spiritual
[24:32] every really it's i believe it's
[24:35] speaking of maturity
[24:36] but every believer is to be in a
[24:38] position
[24:40] of being spiritual because you're filled
[24:41] with the holy spirit
[24:44] you which are spiritual restore them the
[24:47] spirit of jesus christ is in you
[24:50] and you it's in your heart and you
[24:53] should reach out to them
[24:55] it doesn't mean your pastor shouldn't
[24:56] either all of us
[24:58] but we're waiting for the elite the
[25:01] elite
[25:02] to do the work it's not how it's
[25:04] supposed to be
[25:06] in the body of christ we're confused
[25:09] with catholicism or lutheran we have a
[25:12] professional
[25:13] class of ministers and the rest of us
[25:17] come
[25:18] and just sit in our chair sit in our
[25:21] chair
[25:21] and send our money in that's not
[25:26] christianity that's not apostolic
[25:29] each and every one of us have a heart
[25:34] that jesus christ lives in and that he
[25:37] is reaching out through to others
[25:40] it's not a healthy body that says our
