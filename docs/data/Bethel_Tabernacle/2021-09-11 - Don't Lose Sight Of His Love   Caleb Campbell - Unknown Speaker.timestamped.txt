[35:54] take our seats
[35:55] amen
[35:58] is a familiar familiar scripture reading
[36:00] it says though i speak with the tongues
[36:02] of men and angels and have not charity
[36:06] i am become as a sounding brass or a
[36:08] tinkling symbol and though i have the
[36:10] gift of prophecy and understand all
[36:12] mysteries and all knowledge and though i
[36:14] have all faith so that i could remove
[36:16] mountains and have not charity i am
[36:18] nothing and though i bestow all my goods
[36:20] to feed the poor and though i give my
[36:22] body to be burned and have not charity
[36:24] it profiteth me nothing
[36:26] charity suffereth long and is kind
[36:29] charity envious not
[36:30] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[36:32] puffed up
[36:33] doth not behave itself unslamly seeketh
[36:36] not her own
[36:37] is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[36:40] rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in
[36:42] the truth
[36:44] beareth all things believeth all things
[36:46] hopeth all things and endureth all
[36:48] things for charity never faileth but
[36:50] whether there will be prophecies they
[36:52] shall fail whether they be tongues they
[36:54] shall they shall cease whether they'll
[36:55] be knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[36:58] know in part and we prophesy in part
[37:00] but when that which is perfect has come
[37:02] then that which is in part shall be done
[37:04] away when i was a child i speak as a
[37:06] child i understood as a child i thought
[37:08] as a child but when i became a man i put
[37:10] away my childish things
[37:12] for now we see through a glass darkly
[37:14] but then face to face now i know in part
[37:17] but then shall i know even as also i am
[37:19] known
[37:20] and now by to faith hope and charity
[37:23] these three but the greatest
[37:25] of these is charity

[38:18] i
[38:19] just want to talk about don't lose sight
[38:21] of his love
[38:22] i just want to talk a little bit about
[38:26] how this thought came to me
[38:29] one night while i was i was at work and
[38:31] i was listening to a portion of a sermon
[38:33] on a youtube
[38:34] and the holy spirit just started
[38:35] witnessing to me
[38:37] and
[38:38] man don't you just love it when that
[38:39] happens when you can just set your side
[38:42] of self
[38:43] set yourself aside and just bask in his
[38:45] presence for a few minutes and just
[38:48] listen to a tape or listen to some
[38:49] worship music or just listen to just
[38:52] something soothing and and his presence
[38:54] just descends down
[38:56] it amazes me friends when we can
[38:58] really shut out the world to open up
[39:00] that channel with the holy spirit
[39:02] miracles really take place
[39:05] you asked me what miracle took place
[39:07] that night
[39:08] a divine presence
[39:10] a divine presence that is in a perfect
[39:12] place
[39:13] spoke to me through his spirit that
[39:14] allowed me
[39:16] to house him his spirit in my earthly
[39:19] body friends when we all have that gift
[39:22] how much more
[39:23] miraculous can it get
[39:26] i just want to talk a little bit about
[39:27] the pathway to love
[39:29] and loving one towards another
[39:32] um
[39:33] some bullet points here you know having
[39:35] revelation you know it's it's important
[39:38] getting in line with the right doctrine
[39:40] is important good works are important
[39:42] these things are all what the scripture
[39:44] teaches to have
[39:46] having all these attributes are key to
[39:48] being christians
[39:50] but having the key element of of it all
[39:52] is the most important
[39:54] and
[39:55] there's no greater commandment than it
[39:58] than to love amen to love our our god to
[40:01] love one another
[40:04] in mark 12 we talked about that and
[40:05] without gaining that love in our hearts
[40:07] we will never to be we will never be
[40:08] able to step into our true positions in
[40:10] christ
[40:11] unlocking that that key element amen
[40:14] you want to turn in your your bibles
[40:15] with me to matthew 18
[40:18] and verse 18.
[40:31] we're going to start with the king james
[40:33] version but i wanted to read a few
[40:34] versions of this the lord really spoke
[40:35] to me through
[40:37] matthew 18 and verse 18
[40:42] verily say verily i say unto you
[40:44] whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
[40:46] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[40:48] shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
[40:50] heaven again i say unto you that if two
[40:53] of you shall agree on earth as touching
[40:56] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[40:58] done of them of my father which is in
[41:00] heaven
[41:01] for where there are two or three
[41:02] gathered together in my name
[41:04] there i am in the midst of them amen
[41:10] in another translation i i read and
[41:12] there's going to be two we're going to
[41:13] read out of the message translation and
[41:15] the esv but they both really spoke to me
[41:18] matthew 18 and verse 19 and the esv says
[41:21] and again i say this to you if two of
[41:23] you agree on earth about anything they
[41:24] ask it will be done for them
[41:26] by my father in heaven for where two or
[41:28] three are gathered together in my name
[41:30] there i am among you
[41:32] there i am among them amen friends so we
[41:34] have we're
[41:35] this is a key element we're god is
[41:37] giving us a chance he he's giving us an
[41:40] ability to when we bind together when we
[41:43] come together and we
[41:45] take away everything else
[41:46] ourselves we lay everything else aside
[41:49] and we just love one another we love him
[41:51] then everything else can come and and
[41:54] and and be made whole
[41:56] amen in the message translation um it
[41:59] says take this most seriously this is
[42:00] this is probably my favorite
[42:02] my favorite translation when it comes to
[42:04] this scripture it says take this most
[42:06] seriously a yes on earth is yes in
[42:09] heaven and a no on earth is no in heaven
[42:12] what you say to one another is eternal i
[42:14] mean this when two of you get together
[42:15] on anything at all on earth and make
[42:18] prayer of it my father in heaven goes
[42:21] into action amen friends isn't that
[42:23] beautiful when when two of us get
[42:25] together on earth
[42:27] and pray and make prayer of it
[42:29] my father in heaven goes into action and
[42:32] then when two or three of you are
[42:34] gathered together because of me you can
[42:35] be sure that i'll be there friends so we
[42:37] can be sure tonight that he's here
[42:39] because more than two of us are gathered
[42:41] together in his name amen
[42:43] to freely forgive in matthew 18
[42:47] 21-22 to freely forgive is the practice
[42:49] of christ's mercy and love amen
[42:52] it's what he teaches us it's the way
[42:54] it's the way of his love is to freely
[42:56] forgive it's what it's what he did for
[42:59] us when we were dead in our sins in
[43:01] trespasses he he forgave us amen
[43:05] in in the next verses in uh matthew 18
[43:07] it there's a story that talks a little
[43:09] bit about forgiveness
[43:11] just going to read through this story
[43:12] for for just a moment
[43:15] and it says then peter came into him and
[43:17] said lord how oft shall my brother sin
[43:19] against me and i forgive him
[43:22] till seven times
[43:24] and jesus saith unto him i say unto thee
[43:27] until seven times but until seventy
[43:30] times seven
[43:31] therefore is the kingdom of heaven
[43:33] likened unto a certain king which would
[43:35] take account of his servants and when he
[43:37] had begun to reckon one was bought unto
[43:39] him which owed him ten thousand talents
[43:41] but for as much as he had not to pay his
[43:44] lord commanded him to be sold and his
[43:46] wife and his children and all that he
[43:47] had and payment to be made the servant
[43:49] therefore fell down and worshipped him
[43:51] saying lord have patience with me and i
[43:53] will pay thee all then the lord of that
[43:55] servant was moved with compassion and
[43:57] loosed him and forgave him of the debt
[43:59] but that same servant went out and found
[44:01] one of his fellow servants which owed
[44:03] him a hundred pence and he laid hands on
[44:05] him and he took him by the throat saying
[44:06] pay me the what thou owest
[44:08] and his fellow servants fell down his
[44:10] feet and besought him saying
[44:12] have patience with me and i will pay
[44:14] thee and he would not but went and cast
[44:16] him into prison till he should pay his
[44:18] debt so when his fellow servants saw
[44:20] what was done they were they were very
[44:22] sorry and came and told their lord that
[44:23] was done then his lord after that he had
[44:25] called him said unto him o thou wicked
[44:28] servant i forgave thee all thy debt
[44:30] because thou has desired us me should it
[44:32] thou not also have compassion on thy
[44:34] fellow servant even as i had pity on
[44:36] thee and his lord was wroth and
[44:38] delivered him to the tormentors thank
[44:40] you till he should pay all that was due
[44:42] unto him
[44:44] so likewise shall my heavenly father do
[44:46] also unto you if ye from your hearts
[44:49] forgive not everyone his brother his
[44:51] trespasses amen friends so we see here
[44:54] that just the lord tells a parable how
[44:57] you know this this king he had he had a
[44:59] debt and and he forgave this debt the
[45:01] servant he forgave this debt but then he
[45:04] had people underneath him who also had a
[45:06] debt but he didn't forgive he didn't
[45:08] freely forgive the way that he was
[45:10] freely forgiven so sometimes friends you
[45:12] know we we can think about you know how
[45:14] the lord freely forgives us you know we
[45:16] were dead i mean
[45:17] i'm the greatest center of them all amen
[45:19] like we were we were dead in our sins
[45:21] and trespasses and he forgave us we all
[45:24] the way this step into the position that
[45:25] he wants us to is that we need to freely
[45:27] forgive just like he did amen
[45:30] we're unlocking something with this
[45:31] scripture amen god starts with a what if
[45:35] two of you get together on anything at
[45:36] all and make a prayer of it my father
[45:38] will go into action so that we have we
[45:40] have the substance of what we need to do
[45:42] we need to bind together we need to go
[45:45] together in prayer but how are we going
[45:47] to do that the only way to be able to do
[45:49] that to bind together is to is to loose
[45:52] everything else
[45:54] he finishes with the how and remember
[45:56] back to our opening text we were talking
[45:58] about the most important commandment
[45:59] which is love your neighbor have grace
[46:02] and have mercy on those who who makes
[46:03] mistakes
[46:05] it struck a thought
[46:08] to me that the more mature we can get in
[46:10] christ
[46:12] the more often
[46:13] we are to freely forgive someone of a
[46:15] wrong yes amen
[46:17] why is that because we have been in that
[46:20] person's shoes so many times we have
[46:23] myself i have been in that place so many
[46:25] times where i have stepped out of the
[46:27] line of grace or i've stepped out of of
[46:29] the line of his will and he's offered up
[46:31] his grace so freely amen we've stepped
[46:33] out or you know we've done wrong to
[46:35] somebody and you know we feel so bad
[46:37] about it we we you know we did a wrong
[46:39] to a brother or a sister or you know a
[46:41] friend or a family member and you know
[46:43] maybe we meant to do it maybe we didn't
[46:45] mean to do it but we feel so
[46:47] we feel so bad about it we we we step
[46:49] into that place
[46:51] um
[46:52] we we know that remorse amen we know
[46:55] what that feels like we walked a mile in
[46:57] those people's shoes and those in that
[46:58] person's shoes
[47:01] we can't lose sight friends of his love
[47:04] i broke down thinking about something
[47:07] just while i was at work that night i
[47:09] was just thinking to the lord and just
[47:11] praising him and
[47:13] thinking about what he's done for me in
[47:14] my life and i started thinking about
[47:16] back to my personal testimony
[47:19] about how he saved me i was just i was
[47:21] just a no-good rotten
[47:22] individual still in but by his grace i'm
[47:25] here amen and
[47:28] i remember
[47:29] when i gave my heart to the lord i
[47:31] hadn't completely fully surrendered yet
[47:33] i i
[47:36] i gave him part of me amen sometimes we
[47:38] can get to that place where we give him
[47:40] part of us amen i gave him part of me i
[47:42] just told him i'd give up the things
[47:44] that i that i that were that were
[47:45] hurting me i was in that i was in that
[47:47] phase where i didn't i didn't like the
[47:49] pain that i was around and i didn't i
[47:51] knew that something was happening and i
[47:53] was scared for myself so i had i had
[47:55] stepped halfway into into giving him
[47:58] myself he i wanted him to be my savior
[48:00] but i didn't i wasn't sure about him
[48:02] being my lord yet amen we all have that
[48:04] sometimes amen friends we want him to be
[48:06] our savior but sometimes it's hard for
[48:07] him to be our lord to be the lord of our
[48:09] life and i wasn't i wasn't completely
[48:12] there yet he was working on my heart
[48:13] continually working on my heart and i
[48:15] remember being at home one day and
[48:18] i just was having all kinds of
[48:20] physical issues emotional issues
[48:22] spiritual issues all kinds of things
[48:24] just going on in my mind and in my heart
[48:26] and in my life and i remember coming
[48:28] home and i hadn't asked for this in a
[48:30] really long time and if if
[48:32] since i was a young kid and i just asked
[48:34] my i went up to my parents they were
[48:36] they were just in their bedroom and i
[48:37] just asked i was like well you just will
[48:39] you guys pray with me i just was broken
[48:41] down in my spirit and i just i needed
[48:43] prayer and i knew that those were two
[48:45] people that i could turn to for that i
[48:47] knew that there was a solace place to go
[48:49] to amen
[48:50] so i went to them for prayer
[48:52] and
[48:54] what had happened friends is
[48:57] in first john 4 18 we don't have to turn
[48:59] to it but
[49:02] it says it it says because fear the
[49:04] second part of the verse it says because
[49:06] fear hath torment and he that feareth is
[49:09] not made perfect in love amen i was in
[49:12] torment friends we have all been in that
[49:14] place in torment in our hearts and in
[49:16] our lives and in our in our beings where
[49:18] we're in torment we're we the lord is
[49:20] working on us and maybe we we need to
[49:22] step into what we need to do and
[49:24] whatever it may be whatever it is that
[49:26] you're you're fighting whatever your
[49:28] spiritual battle is
[49:29] amen but
[49:33] when that force overtakes you there's
[49:36] something there's something there's a
[49:38] there's a gateway god god sends a
[49:39] gateway he sends he sends it there's a
[49:41] path to get out of it amen
[49:44] and i remember laying in my bed
[49:47] nights i would lay in my bed weeks on
[49:49] end and i would just
[49:52] i was thinking that this was going to be
[49:54] the yet for me the end for me
[49:56] i just my heart was racing
[49:58] and nights my mom would come in and she
[50:00] would just she would just pray with me
[50:03] amen
[50:04] she would just pray over me she would
[50:06] pray with me
[50:07] and it was just
[50:08] it was something that
[50:11] that i needed
[50:12] the lord was really working on me really
[50:14] dealing with me
[50:20] fear had overtaken me
[50:24] the first part of that chapter first
[50:26] part of that verse it says that there is
[50:28] no fear in love
[50:29] but perfect love casteth out fear amen
[50:33] friends
[50:34] what was happening i was in torment
[50:36] because of fear
[50:38] but his love because his love wasn't in
[50:40] me yet amen i hadn't surrendered fully
[50:42] to him yet amen
[50:44] but there was someone close to me my mom
[50:46] who knew full well with that first part
[50:48] of that scripture
[50:49] all i knew was the worldly part of that
[50:51] scripture where fear had overtaken me
[50:53] but she knew the first part that there
[50:55] is no fear and love because perfect love
[50:57] casted out fear
[50:58] amen
[51:00] and in that scripture it says
[51:02] beloved let us love one another for love
[51:04] is of god and everyone that loveth is
[51:06] born of god and knoweth god
[51:09] amen i'm just going to build up to
[51:11] something here friends here in his love
[51:12] that not that we loved god but that he
[51:14] loved us and sent his son to be the
[51:16] propitiation for our sins beloved if god
[51:19] so loved us we all we ought also to love
[51:22] one another no man has seen god at any
[51:24] time
[51:25] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[51:28] us and his love is perfected in us
[51:31] amen hereby we know that we dwell in him
[51:33] and he and us because he hath given us
[51:35] of his spirit
[51:36] and we have seen and do testify that the
[51:38] father sent the son to be the savior of
[51:40] the world and whosoever shall confess
[51:42] that jesus is the son of god god
[51:45] dwelleth in him and he and god and we
[51:46] have known and believed the love that
[51:48] god hath in us for god is love and he
[51:51] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god
[51:53] and god in him
[51:55] and herein is our love made perfect
[51:58] that we may have boldness in the day of
[52:00] judgment
[52:01] skip down to verse 18
[52:04] for verse 19. we love him because he
[52:06] first loved us
[52:09] it's in moments like these where i was
[52:10] sitting in my
[52:12] sitting in my place of work and and a
[52:14] miracle
[52:15] took place
[52:16] where i consider myself
[52:18] and each one of us here tonight a living
[52:21] walking breathing talking miracle amen
[52:24] he gave us a chance
[52:26] he forgave us because he was crushed for
[52:28] our iniquities and he was wounded for
[52:30] our transgressions
[52:32] we each one have our testimonies that
[52:34] we've gone through in our life
[52:36] that we we build upon our relationship
[52:38] with the lord with because each step we
[52:40] take in our lives we can look back on
[52:41] the love that jesus had for us through
[52:43] the air through the air of of ourselves
[52:46] and he can still
[52:48] have a relationship with us because he
[52:49] wanted to
[52:52] one thing that we need to do is we can't
[52:54] lose sight of those times in your life
[52:56] where god's love was projected
[52:58] amen that was a time in my life where
[53:00] god's love was was projected to me
[53:03] i was sitting in my living room one day
[53:05] a couple weeks ago
[53:07] while i was studying this thought and
[53:09] jesus just allowed his his sweet
[53:11] presence just to descend down in the
[53:12] room and i just was typing on the
[53:14] computer and i just started to cry just
[53:17] it was just his presence just does that
[53:19] to you friends
[53:20] just
[53:21] was reminded of
[53:23] his never failing love in my heart
[53:26] i can think so often times we can get so
[53:28] distracted in our life
[53:31] our jobs our families our cars our homes
[53:33] our everything
[53:35] our school
[53:37] our phones
[53:39] that we lose the connection that we're
[53:41] supposed to have with the lord
[53:43] amen
[53:45] our love story doesn't stop the day that
[53:48] we surrender to him
[53:50] in fact that is just the beginning
[53:52] friends
[53:53] our love story with him is something for
[53:55] the ages he has an entire he has an
[53:58] entire love story written out for us and
[54:00] when we study the scriptures we can see
[54:02] god's divine plan we realize that love
[54:04] is projected to us
[54:06] and almost more importantly it is
[54:08] projected through us amen he wants his
[54:11] love to project through us completely
[54:13] and that is when the impossible becomes
[54:15] possible in our lives
[54:17] that's when our lives are changed and if
[54:19] we can keep our eyes fixed to that
[54:22] then all else
[54:25] will fall directly where it's supposed
[54:26] to be
[54:27] amen i just have a quote i wanted to
[54:29] read from 1951 the works that i do bear
[54:31] witness with me
[54:32] it says that after all i'd rather have
[54:34] the love of god sealed in my heart than
[54:36] all the gifts there is in the bible
[54:38] that's right i thought of that here just
[54:40] a few nights ago my little girl called
[54:41] me i told her she wanted me to come home
[54:43] to her she loves me oh she told me that
[54:45] i sent
[54:46] i told her i sent her a little doll but
[54:48] she didn't want the doll she said i want
[54:50] you daddy not your doll she wants me
[54:52] that's the way i think of jesus amen
[54:54] i love his gifts
[54:57] and things to help his people but i want
[54:59] jesus
[55:00] the love of god
[55:01] sealed in your hearts pressed in until
[55:03] the world's pressed out and you see
[55:06] nothing but the lord
[55:08] to love him as you love one another you
[55:10] love the lord if you don't love one
[55:12] another you can't love the lord he said
[55:14] so that's right and god can't move you
[55:16] so friends that's my that's my main
[55:18] thought tonight i want to tell i want to
[55:19] take and look at this
[55:21] you
[55:22] if you can't love one another you can't
[55:24] love the lord amen that's right god
[55:26] can't move into you
[55:29] there's there's this quote that he talks
[55:31] about and we're all familiar with the
[55:32] story it's the maniac that was out there
[55:34] in washington
[55:36] and he ran to the platform he was a big
[55:38] big grizzly man he was 260 70 pounds and
[55:42] he was crazy
[55:44] and he had done this before he had
[55:46] broken into different ministers uh
[55:49] platforms and and he had actually been
[55:50] in the insane asylum for for punching
[55:53] out actually another minister
[55:55] and he was in this he was in brother
[55:57] branham's meeting
[55:59] and uh he said he said i weighed about
[56:00] 128 pounds
[56:02] and he the guy ran up to him and said i
[56:04] was going to break every bone in your
[56:06] body
[56:07] and the police and the ministers fled
[56:08] away and i was left on the platform with
[56:10] the maniac and something happened
[56:12] and the maniac stood like that his teeth
[56:14] set together his eyes snake in the grass
[56:17] he said you snake in the grass up here
[56:19] pretending to be a man of god said i'll
[56:21] show you how much man of god you are
[56:23] i'll break every bone of your body and
[56:25] he drew back his big fist and he was
[56:27] well able physically to carry out this
[56:29] threat but something happened
[56:32] instead of despising this man hey man
[56:34] this is this is a great friend something
[56:36] happened instead of despising this man i
[56:38] felt sorry for him
[56:40] i thought you poor man you wouldn't
[56:42] treat me that way
[56:43] why you're just a man like i am you
[56:45] wasn't made to act like that you were
[56:47] made to love you were made to be a
[56:49] father of children to love them and to
[56:51] love all man you were made to be a son
[56:54] of god but the devil has taken a hold of
[56:56] you and i feel sorry for you amen what
[56:59] was the prophet doing in that time in
[57:00] that moment of time he was tapping into
[57:03] first john 4 18 where it says that
[57:05] perfect love casteth out fear amen he
[57:08] wasn't up there on the platform scared
[57:10] he wasn't up there you know trembling in
[57:13] fear perfect love had casted that out he
[57:15] knew that god was gonna take care of him
[57:17] no matter what amen
[57:19] he was tapping into mark 12 and verse 30
[57:22] and 31 where there is no greater love
[57:24] than this and that's to love those who
[57:27] hate you love your neighbors and love
[57:29] god and project that love amen
[57:31] and he said he walked up close to me and
[57:33] brother brandon making that sound he
[57:35] spit in my face and i looked at him oh
[57:36] what happened with witch doctors and
[57:38] everything don't worry if god's with you
[57:40] who can be against you so so i looked
[57:42] the man i thought poor man i love you my
[57:45] poor lost brother never said a word and
[57:48] he walked up to me and raised his big
[57:50] fist back and the crowd setting
[57:51] breathless six thousand inside there
[57:54] pretty near that man standing in the
[57:56] rain he drew his fist back he had just
[57:58] struck a preacher like i was saying he
[57:59] was out of the insane institution
[58:02] he might ask the police there that was
[58:03] on the record to date and hit him he hit
[58:05] a minister and he broke his jaw on his
[58:06] collarbone he ran in there ran to the
[58:08] platform
[58:09] said i'm going to break every bone in
[58:10] your body
[58:13] and i looked at him not with hatred but
[58:14] with love
[58:16] and as he did and started towards me
[58:18] something inside of me said but tonight
[58:20] you'll fall over my feet
[58:23] fall over your feet he said i'll show
[58:24] you snake in the grass whose feet all
[58:26] fall over and he ran to me threw his
[58:29] fist back to strike me and i said satan
[58:32] come out of that man
[58:33] and his eyes set his head went back and
[58:36] he fell and pinned my feet to the floor
[58:38] the police had to roll him off
[58:41] oh friends that's it
[58:42] love
[58:43] amen
[58:44] when divine love is projected
[58:47] sovereign grace takes its place friends
[58:50] i wanna i want you guys to just look at
[58:52] this thought for a moment just step back
[58:54] and kind of getting ahead of myself here
[58:56] a little bit but we're just talking
[58:57] about love tonight and not losing sight
[59:00] of it and how
[59:02] how to step into the position that we're
[59:04] supposed to to be able to do the things
[59:07] that we're supposed to be do as
[59:08] believers as christians that we're
[59:10] supposed to do we have to surrender
[59:13] ourselves completely to christ which we
[59:15] did at one point but we have to keep
[59:17] surrendering ourselves as a in our daily
[59:20] walk in our daily self we in first
[59:22] corinthians paul talks about it says
[59:24] that he doesn't die once a week or once
[59:26] a month or once a year it says that i
[59:28] die daily and he uses that in the
[59:30] singular pronoun where it says that i am
[59:33] dying daily amen friends he dies daily
[59:36] that's what we're supposed to do we
[59:37] we're supposed to die daily so that
[59:39] god's love can enter into us and that we
[59:43] can project it to others amen that's
[59:46] what brother random was tapping into
[59:47] there and that's what so many
[59:49] prophets and teachers in the bible they
[59:51] tap into
[59:52] and
[59:53] we as christians as believers in this
[59:55] end time is what we're supposed to be
[59:57] able to tap into that's that's the main
[1:00:00] the capstone is what i've been reading
[1:00:02] the statue of a perfect man is this
[1:00:03] capstone is love we have to project that
[1:00:05] love to one another amen
[1:00:07] in in uh the book of acts the seventh
[1:00:09] chapter
[1:00:10] we're just gonna look at uh if you guys
[1:00:12] want to turn with me in the seventh
[1:00:14] chapter of verse 55 we're gonna look at
[1:00:17] just
[1:00:18] steven here
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:28] and when they heard these things they
[1:00:30] were cut to their heart and they gnashed
[1:00:31] on their teeth gnashed on him with their
[1:00:33] teeth but he being full of the holy
[1:00:35] ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven
[1:00:37] and saw the glory of god and jesus
[1:00:40] standing on the right hand of god and
[1:00:41] said behold i see the heavens opened and
[1:00:44] the son of man standing on the right
[1:00:46] hand of god then they cried out with a
[1:00:48] loud voice and stopped their ears and
[1:00:51] ran up upon him with one accord and cast
[1:00:54] him out of the city and stoned him
[1:00:57] amen and the witnesses laid down their
[1:00:59] clothes at a young man's feet whose name
[1:01:01] was saul and they stoned see stephen
[1:01:03] calling upon god saying lord jesus
[1:01:05] receive my spirit and he kneeled down
[1:01:08] in his last moments in his last in his
[1:01:11] last breath he didn't curse them he
[1:01:13] didn't say
[1:01:15] why
[1:01:16] why why are you doing this to me he
[1:01:18] didn't he didn't do any of those things
[1:01:20] friends he kneeled down and he cried
[1:01:22] with a loud voice saying lord lay not
[1:01:24] this sin to their charge and when he had
[1:01:27] said this he fell asleep amen friends he
[1:01:29] projected that love to them he didn't
[1:01:31] want to see he's he's
[1:01:34] received the gift of the holy ghost he
[1:01:36] received the gift of god he received god
[1:01:39] and he had his love inside of him and he
[1:01:41] was projecting that love to these people
[1:01:44] nobody when we when we are able to
[1:01:46] receive that gift of love
[1:01:48] from god
[1:01:49] that should be our main goal to give it
[1:01:52] out to others amen friends no matter no
[1:01:54] no barrier should break it break that
[1:01:56] down
[1:01:57] amen the bible is for our molding
[1:02:00] and
[1:02:01] just like to take these stories and take
[1:02:02] what we hear and just apply it to our
[1:02:05] lives amen
[1:02:07] in uh
[1:02:09] in john chapter 13
[1:02:15] chapter 13 and verse 34 it says a new
[1:02:17] commandment i give unto you that you
[1:02:20] love one another as i have loved you
[1:02:22] that ye also love one another and by
[1:02:25] this shall all men know that ye are my
[1:02:28] disciples if ye have loved one towards
[1:02:31] another amen friends that's that's what
[1:02:34] it that's what god is trying to get us
[1:02:35] to see this is how we are to be known as
[1:02:37] disciples to show love one another even
[1:02:40] when they don't deserve it we can't lose
[1:02:42] sight of that we we we remember
[1:02:45] i talked about a couple times ago last
[1:02:47] time i spoke up here
[1:02:49] about how
[1:02:51] we can't live in our our past experience
[1:02:54] we have to have our an experience every
[1:02:55] day and we
[1:02:57] can never lose sight of what god did for
[1:03:00] us
[1:03:01] and we are to be able to project that
[1:03:04] to others amen project what god did to
[1:03:07] us for others
[1:03:10] it breaks down barriers to move us
[1:03:11] forward to that higher calling in
[1:03:13] heavenly places
[1:03:16] paul said in first corinthians 13 it
[1:03:18] says though i speak with the tongue of
[1:03:20] men and angels though i have discernment
[1:03:23] though i have gifts
[1:03:24] to feed i take all my goods to feed the
[1:03:27] poor though i can move mountains with
[1:03:29] faith though i have knowledge to
[1:03:31] understand all things i am nothing till
[1:03:34] love comes in which is grace god has to
[1:03:37] do it you can do all these things and
[1:03:40] still be lost amen it's grace that saves
[1:03:43] you god's grace to the human race
[1:03:48] i think sometimes we can lose sight of
[1:03:50] his plan for us we can lose sight of his
[1:03:53] love
[1:03:54] i was just sitting there and i just was
[1:03:56] thinking about what he did for me
[1:03:58] and how that i can be a better testimony
[1:04:01] how that i can be
[1:04:02] a better witness how that i can project
[1:04:04] that love to all those people that i see
[1:04:06] on a daily basis and i just i was just
[1:04:09] praying my prayer was lord just lord
[1:04:11] help me step into that and help me just
[1:04:13] be who you want me to be who you've
[1:04:15] called me to be help me to take these
[1:04:17] scriptures and apply it to my life help
[1:04:20] me to be like stephen help me to be like
[1:04:22] these characters in the bible so that i
[1:04:24] can so that i can project your love so
[1:04:27] that because
[1:04:28] these things there's so many things in
[1:04:30] this in these scriptures that are
[1:04:31] important but it but in first
[1:04:32] corinthians 13 we looked at it it says
[1:04:34] if we don't have love then all those
[1:04:37] other things that we may possess those
[1:04:39] characteristics of christ then they
[1:04:40] don't they don't matter those nothing
[1:04:43] matters without god's love amen
[1:04:46] we're gonna we're gonna uh kind of
[1:04:49] take a little turn here and talk about
[1:04:52] talk about enoch and in hebrews in
[1:04:55] hebrews 11 it says by faith enoch was
[1:04:57] translated that he should not see death
[1:04:59] hebrews 11 5 he was translated that he
[1:05:02] should not see death and was not found
[1:05:04] because god had translated him for
[1:05:06] before his translation he had this
[1:05:09] testimony that he pleased god friends i
[1:05:12] just was reading that scripture and i
[1:05:13] was like oh man i want to do that lord i
[1:05:15] want to be pleasing to you you know and
[1:05:17] as believers in this last day we're
[1:05:19] supposed to be types of enoch because
[1:05:20] we're going to be called up into a
[1:05:21] rapture amen but the only way that we're
[1:05:23] going to be able to do that is we're
[1:05:24] going to have to apply these words to
[1:05:26] our life amen we apply everything in
[1:05:28] this book to us but it says that the
[1:05:30] most important thing that we have to
[1:05:32] apply in our lives is his love we have
[1:05:34] to project his love we have to
[1:05:37] and how do we do that how do we have the
[1:05:39] testimony to please god like enoch had
[1:05:42] how do we how do we get to the place
[1:05:44] where god wants us to be amen friends
[1:05:47] he was translated because we please god
[1:05:49] can we say that
[1:05:51] we're supposed to
[1:05:52] friends we're supposed to get
[1:05:54] prepared for the rapture amen that's
[1:05:56] worse there's nothing else now except
[1:05:58] for his return amen so to get us to that
[1:06:01] place god has called us
[1:06:03] god has a plan for that
[1:06:07] it says
[1:06:08] this is from 1960 says he didn't
[1:06:10] displease him what the lord said do
[1:06:12] enoch done it now he was a type remember
[1:06:14] the ark is the type of jews the 144
[1:06:16] thousand which is noah and his bunch but
[1:06:18] enoch went home just a little bit before
[1:06:20] the flood you know that so enoch kept
[1:06:22] just walking in the light so one day he
[1:06:24] felt his feet getting
[1:06:26] his he felt his feet getting off the
[1:06:28] ground he just kept walking he walked
[1:06:30] into glory without even dying that's
[1:06:32] right amen
[1:06:33] god took him away because he wasn't he
[1:06:35] was walking in the light with a
[1:06:37] testimony that he walked in the light of
[1:06:39] god amen
[1:06:41] he kept walking let's get our walking
[1:06:43] shoes on church let's get our walking
[1:06:45] shoes on to come where the and keep
[1:06:47] walking in the light in the beautiful
[1:06:49] light if we can step back for just a
[1:06:51] moment and we apply these things to our
[1:06:53] lives and we look back and we say lord i
[1:06:56] have to be like enoch so that you can
[1:06:57] come and
[1:06:58] and you can translate me up there so how
[1:07:01] do i get to that place father god how do
[1:07:03] i how do i project your love how do i do
[1:07:05] these things how do i we we have these
[1:07:08] we have all these these
[1:07:10] uh we have all these scriptures to do it
[1:07:12] we have to let the world around us just
[1:07:14] completely fade away amen and i was just
[1:07:17] i was i was sitting there and i was i
[1:07:19] was just crying i was just weeping
[1:07:21] because
[1:07:22] when he
[1:07:23] died for me when he when he did that
[1:07:25] 2000 years ago and and he called me back
[1:07:29] from it
[1:07:30] he called me back from my life of sin
[1:07:32] and from my life of transgression and
[1:07:34] from my life of of wrong
[1:07:40] the world started to fade away it
[1:07:42] started to become smaller
[1:07:44] everything that everything that
[1:07:46] that i started to do was just
[1:07:49] it was it didn't matter friends nothing
[1:07:52] nothing mattered that's what we that's
[1:07:54] the place that where we need to get to
[1:07:55] where nothing else matters we have to do
[1:07:58] things in our daily life i understand
[1:08:00] that i i completely do but we have to
[1:08:03] walk in the sight of god's love
[1:08:06] we have to step back into
[1:08:08] and commune with him and i just think
[1:08:10] about since there's not really too many
[1:08:12] scriptures that talks about enoch but we
[1:08:15] have but since we're supposed to be
[1:08:17] scripturally like enoch i just think of
[1:08:18] myself like him and i just think about
[1:08:20] his daily walk that he had with the lord
[1:08:22] amen friends just he just he just walked
[1:08:24] with the lord so he you know he just was
[1:08:26] he he had that love that first
[1:08:28] corinthians 13 talked about so he just
[1:08:32] he he just let everything else fade away
[1:08:34] it says that he was pleasing to god so
[1:08:36] everything else didn't matter to him so
[1:08:39] i just try to place myself in the in
[1:08:41] that place every time i wake up in the
[1:08:42] morning i just think to myself you know
[1:08:44] lord you know there's i got to get to
[1:08:46] work i got to do these things but lord i
[1:08:48] just i'm dying right now i lay down
[1:08:50] myself so that something you can do you
[1:08:53] can do something through me today lord
[1:08:54] use me use me to to say something for to
[1:08:57] to be a witness to whatever it is lord
[1:09:00] use me for the furtherance of your
[1:09:01] kingdom that should be our thought every
[1:09:03] moment of every day so that we can be
[1:09:06] used for the furtherance of his kingdom
[1:09:08] friends amen
[1:09:09] he's he stepped into what we've been
[1:09:12] talking about
[1:09:14] imagine just walking down the street and
[1:09:16] singing praises to god just communion
[1:09:18] communing with him praying fervently
[1:09:21] and just one day
[1:09:23] said he had his walk-in shoes on and he
[1:09:25] just
[1:09:26] just kept on walking
[1:09:28] and he didn't come back
[1:09:29] amen friends that's gonna be us one day
[1:09:32] we're just gonna walk into the sight of
[1:09:34] god's love
[1:09:35] and we won't come back amen people will
[1:09:38] wonder where we're at but we won't be
[1:09:40] here we're gonna be in god's eternal
[1:09:42] love at that point
[1:09:44] he walked so far into the sight of god's
[1:09:46] love that one day he went so far that
[1:09:49] god didn't want him to turn back
[1:09:51] that's where we need to be friends i
[1:09:52] want to be so far into god's love that
[1:09:54] he doesn't want me to turn back he he
[1:09:57] sees where we're at he sees the
[1:09:59] struggles that we go through there for
[1:10:01] our benefit he sees what we need to to
[1:10:04] to have in our lives he sees each one of
[1:10:07] us and we have a personal walk with him
[1:10:09] but he knows and he wants us to get to
[1:10:12] the place where we're walking in his
[1:10:13] sight where we're walking in the sight
[1:10:15] of his love
[1:10:16] enoch fulfilled second john 1 through 6
[1:10:20] where it says and this is love that we
[1:10:22] walk according to his commandments and
[1:10:24] this is the commandment just as you
[1:10:25] heard from the beginning that you should
[1:10:27] walk in it he fulfilled ephesians 5 1
[1:10:30] where it says be therefore followers of
[1:10:32] god as dear children and walk in love he
[1:10:34] fulfilled these scriptures before they
[1:10:35] were even written amen and he walked in
[1:10:37] the love as christ has also also loved
[1:10:39] us and hath given himself for an
[1:10:42] offering and a sacrifice to god for our
[1:10:44] sweet smelling savior that's ephesians 5
[1:10:46] 1.
[1:10:47] he walked in the love of god so
[1:10:49] steadfastly that one day he just kept on
[1:10:51] walking
[1:11:01] my prayer tonight
[1:11:04] is that we can just
[1:11:07] find the love of god
[1:11:09] around us so that we can be pleasing to
[1:11:12] him in everything that we do
[1:11:14] to walk with the lord
[1:11:16] so that when he comes down when he
[1:11:18] descends and he comes his second coming
[1:11:21] and takes us home
[1:11:23] that we're so ready to go that we just
[1:11:27] are translated amen that's what we're
[1:11:28] supposed to get to
[1:11:30] a prayer that
[1:11:31] prophet prays
[1:11:34] says i want god just now in his mercy
[1:11:37] for i'm in love with him and i want to
[1:11:38] give him such divine love that sovereign
[1:11:41] grace
[1:11:42] will send back the baptism of the holy
[1:11:44] spirit upon me to make me a different
[1:11:47] person
[1:11:49] amen i want to be
[1:11:50] that different person tonight
[1:11:53] anybody else with me tonight who else
[1:11:54] wants to be a different person i don't
[1:11:57] want to just pray that prayer and say
[1:11:59] words i want to be a changed human being
[1:12:02] i want to be a changed christian i want
[1:12:04] to be walking down the street when other
[1:12:06] people see me and when i have
[1:12:09] conversations with my co-workers and i
[1:12:11] want them to see the love of god
[1:12:13] projected through me because that is the
[1:12:15] that is the position that he has called
[1:12:17] us to get into
[1:12:20] i want to be not just your average
[1:12:22] different not just just oh you're a
[1:12:25] christian oh you're different oh you
[1:12:26] don't do this oh i want to be
[1:12:28] i want to be jesus different i want to
[1:12:30] be
[1:12:31] enoch different amen friends i want to
[1:12:34] be stephen different i want to be
[1:12:36] brother brain i'm different
[1:12:37] friends these these these people that
[1:12:39] i'm talking about they weren't accepted
[1:12:41] in in their day
[1:12:43] they weren't enoch wasn't accepted in
[1:12:45] his day he was pleasing to the lord
[1:12:47] which means that everybody else probably
[1:12:49] didn't think too much of him amen that's
[1:12:52] usually how it goes down if if if you
[1:12:54] have a close relationship with god you
[1:12:56] take anybody in the scriptures you take
[1:12:58] look at noah he preached for was it 120
[1:13:01] years and nobody nobody got on the ark
[1:13:04] except except for his family amen nobody
[1:13:06] liked him oh this guy's just preaching
[1:13:08] rain and preaching well it's not gonna
[1:13:10] rain and and oh but one day guess what
[1:13:12] friends it started to rain oh friends
[1:13:14] we're we're
[1:13:15] we're talking about a rapture and we're
[1:13:17] preaching this that is going to take
[1:13:19] place we're preaching that it's going to
[1:13:20] that we're going to be translated in in
[1:13:22] the blink of an eye amen and one day
[1:13:24] just like it was in noah's day how the
[1:13:26] how the ark took place how the rain
[1:13:28] started falling just like enoch started
[1:13:31] walking one day with the lord and didn't
[1:13:33] didn't walk back from his heavenly walk
[1:13:35] that's one day is what we're going to
[1:13:36] get into friends amen
[1:13:40] i want to get to a point in my
[1:13:41] relationship with christ where there's
[1:13:43] such divine love projected through us
[1:13:45] that we can break through into what
[1:13:47] jesus called the most important
[1:13:49] commandment of loving one another and
[1:13:51] loving him which we excuse me which we
[1:13:54] read earlier
[1:13:55] if we can project the right kind of love
[1:13:58] through grace and mercy just like jesus
[1:14:01] did
[1:14:01] forgive 70 times seven
[1:14:04] bind together in prayer with that person
[1:14:07] so so there's there's a there's a step
[1:14:09] there's a process to do you have to
[1:14:11] when you're the lord says to forgive you
[1:14:13] forgive and forgive and forgive and
[1:14:16] forgive brother jason talked about it a
[1:14:17] few weeks ago it's you oh again you did
[1:14:20] the same you you messed up again
[1:14:22] we just
[1:14:23] do what the lord tells us to do we
[1:14:26] we project the love that he projected to
[1:14:29] us amen we have messed up hundreds and
[1:14:31] thousands of countless of times i'm just
[1:14:33] talking about myself i don't know about
[1:14:34] y'all that's just probably the number on
[1:14:36] me amen friends i mess up daily but he
[1:14:39] projects his love and his grace is ever
[1:14:41] abounding we have to do we have to step
[1:14:43] into that position as christians as
[1:14:45] individuals as believers to to project
[1:14:47] that towards other people amen
[1:14:49] where we forgive that many more times
[1:14:51] and once we do that that the next part
[1:14:54] of that is we bind together in prayer
[1:14:56] with that person
[1:14:57] amen and go in
[1:15:00] and go to the father with a need where
[1:15:02] anything is possible
[1:15:04] anything amen friends anything is
[1:15:06] possible and to take it even a step
[1:15:08] further to take it even one step further
[1:15:13] make that need that you're praying for
[1:15:15] after you forgive after you after you
[1:15:17] ask for his love after you do these
[1:15:19] things make that need
[1:15:21] be the souls of those around you because
[1:15:23] those are the what is most important
[1:15:25] friends that is what is most important
[1:15:28] is the souls of those around you there
[1:15:31] we can we can have good deeds it says it
[1:15:33] says that in scriptures but that's not
[1:15:35] the main thing the god wants he made a
[1:15:37] way for every man and it's through
[1:15:40] projection of that love that we can that
[1:15:42] we can bring people into the family amen
[1:15:44] and if we can bind together in prayer
[1:15:47] with those that we have forgiven bind
[1:15:49] together in prayer with our brothers and
[1:15:50] our sisters who may have done us wrong
[1:15:52] or who may have not if we just bind
[1:15:53] together and we believe enough then we
[1:15:56] can pray for the baptism of the holy
[1:15:58] ghost for a refresher filling for
[1:16:00] ourselves and for those around us for
[1:16:02] those people for those for those
[1:16:03] unbelievers for those for those in our
[1:16:06] family our friends our our loved ones
[1:16:08] whoever it may be we can bind together
[1:16:10] and we can stand in the gap and apply
[1:16:12] the token and and believe that they will
[1:16:15] be saved amen and they will be because
[1:16:17] it says that when we come together and
[1:16:19] pray that my father in heaven moves and
[1:16:21] it says when two or three together he
[1:16:23] moves even more quickly amen
[1:16:26] if we can just keep
[1:16:27] our sight on the love of the lord so
[1:16:29] much that we are like enoch when we can
[1:16:32] just put our walking shoes on
[1:16:34] be so pleasing to the lord that we just
[1:16:36] come right on to him
[1:16:40] amen friends he tells this story
[1:16:43] and it's just such a simple story
[1:16:46] and
[1:16:47] i'm just going to talk about it a little
[1:16:48] bit tonight but i'm sure that we've all
[1:16:50] heard it
[1:16:51] and
[1:16:53] i just
[1:16:55] just such a simple
[1:16:57] such a simple story such a simple story
[1:16:59] of love
[1:17:01] where brother branham was at home one
[1:17:03] day and he was just
[1:17:06] being with his family
[1:17:08] and a little possum just starts
[1:17:12] walking towards him and it was in the
[1:17:13] daytime which is
[1:17:15] not usually when possums are out they're
[1:17:17] nocturnal creatures
[1:17:19] and he noticed that it was it had gotten
[1:17:22] ran over and there was it was some
[1:17:24] infection in the leg and and there was
[1:17:27] but there was babies he saw the babies

[1:17:52] that i don't want to i don't want to do
[1:17:53] that to that poor little creature
[1:17:56] and
[1:17:57] it came in and it walked all the way to
[1:17:59] the threshold of brother branham's house
[1:18:01] and he sat there
[1:18:03] and he just the veterinarian and the
[1:18:05] husband
[1:18:06] um i think it was mrs wood and mr wood

[1:18:24] don't i don't want to do it or something
[1:18:26] and i just can't do it
[1:18:28] and he said that

[1:19:00] you you talked about this in your sermon
[1:19:02] you talked about this about this about
[1:19:04] this love

[1:19:08] creature
[1:19:09] why don't you
[1:19:10] why don't you pray and he something
[1:19:12] changed in him a little countenance

[1:19:18] me i didn't know that's what you wanted
[1:19:19] me to do oh my goodness okay oh lord i
[1:19:21] pray that just in in the name of jesus
[1:19:24] that you would just make this thing
[1:19:25] whole and that that it would stand up
[1:19:28] and that each one of the little babies
[1:19:30] would be well and it would walk away and
[1:19:32] this possum had been laying there all
[1:19:33] night and miss wood and the veterinarian
[1:19:35] came back that next morning and said you
[1:19:37] know if it was gonna get up it would
[1:19:39] have gotten up in the middle of the
[1:19:40] night but it didn't and it was it was
[1:19:43] pretty well close to dead
[1:19:45] and he prayed that prayer
[1:19:47] and that little possum got up
[1:19:49] and walked away
[1:19:51] and
[1:19:54] just as such a simple story of love
[1:19:56] friends that god the creator of
[1:19:58] everything saw such a
[1:20:01] such a little creature such a small
[1:20:03] creature with those little babies
[1:20:05] and through the through his prophet he
[1:20:07] projected a love and it and it showed
[1:20:10] the prophet it showed that even god
[1:20:12] loves even the smallest of creatures he
[1:20:14] loves even the smallest of each one of
[1:20:16] us amen i'm the smallest of of his of
[1:20:18] his family i'm the smallest but he loves
[1:20:20] even us friends and he sees that he sees
[1:20:23] our hearts he sees that and he wants to
[1:20:25] project his love to us if we just if we
[1:20:29] just approach his throne approach it
[1:20:30] with love and and apply these things to
[1:20:34] our lives and walk with him like enoch
[1:20:36] walked
[1:20:37] if god could think
[1:20:39] that of a possum how much more can he
[1:20:41] think of you and i
[1:20:43] when your love is produced and projected
[1:20:46] into the heart of the living god by
[1:20:48] instinct alone
[1:20:49] the opossum didn't have any soul it's
[1:20:51] just an animal it was
[1:20:54] if it could be done that way by instinct
[1:20:56] the holy spirit could lead the old
[1:20:57] mother opossum there knowing that he
[1:20:59] would have to pray for that old possum
[1:21:01] and her life would be spared how much
[1:21:04] more are you than that possum how much
[1:21:06] more are those lives around us than that
[1:21:09] possum how much more are our brothers
[1:21:12] and our sisters and our family and our
[1:21:14] friends and our co-workers and the
[1:21:16] people that we see every single day how
[1:21:19] much more are they to god he wants to
[1:21:22] see them in his family he wants to see
[1:21:24] us project his love so much so that we
[1:21:28] can step in line and so that those
[1:21:31] others can see his love projected
[1:21:33] through us amen he when they see that
[1:21:35] love they see something different inside
[1:21:37] of us and they want that they yearn for
[1:21:40] that amen and i want to project that
[1:21:42] love tonight amen

[1:25:40] [Applause]
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:48] amen praise the lord
[1:25:51] what an encouraging sermon what an
[1:25:54] encouraging sermon i thought to myself
[1:25:55] right as brother kayla was getting going
[1:25:58] i
[1:25:59] i
[1:26:00] i was so appreciated his testimony
[1:26:02] because that that was really a question
[1:26:04] as you can imagine
[1:26:06] in the minister's heart and particularly
[1:26:07] a pastor i suppose
[1:26:09] you know sometimes you see people make a
[1:26:11] commitment and they come to the lord
[1:26:12] give the life of the lord come to an
[1:26:14] altar
[1:26:16] at a church at home in a car whatever
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:20] sometimes you can see that it's only a
[1:26:22] half measure and you almost can be like
[1:26:24] well
[1:26:25] that's not going to go anywhere
[1:26:27] but it can
[1:26:29] it can just carry on amen you know i i
[1:26:33] was reminded brother branham said
[1:26:35] however much now i i gotta tell you
[1:26:39] i wouldn't have never
[1:26:41] thought this would be true
[1:26:43] i would have never said it but a prophet
[1:26:45] said it he said as much
[1:26:47] as you will
[1:26:49] move out the world move the world out of
[1:26:51] you and make room for him he'll come in
[1:26:54] and take that space
[1:26:57] i mean we we tend to think it's just all
[1:27:00] or none but you know
[1:27:01] god's love just goes beyond our thinking
[1:27:04] doesn't it
[1:27:05] i'm so appreciative of that tonight and
[1:27:08] i i thought to myself
[1:27:11] that you know i love that statement
[1:27:13] brother caleb made and i i hope you
[1:27:15] caught it that god has
[1:27:18] an entire
[1:27:20] love story for our lives
[1:27:22] did you ever know that did you ever stop
[1:27:25] and think for a moment wow
[1:27:27] the lord has every
[1:27:28] part of my life he has a script a
[1:27:31] program a way to go that's going to
[1:27:34] project
[1:27:35] his love the real love amen
[1:27:38] not the marginalized and
[1:27:40] you know deluded
[1:27:42] love
[1:27:43] i mean the world today that that word
[1:27:45] has become so cheap it almost means
[1:27:48] nothing anymore
[1:27:49] you know and um
[1:27:51] it's just it's almost become completely
[1:27:53] marginalized in the modern world
[1:27:56] but i i'm glad that the lord still has
[1:27:59] the real thing
[1:28:01] available to me i appreciate that
[1:28:04] brother caleb we're going to go to
[1:28:06] prayer and we had a number of requests
[1:28:08] that i actually didn't get to
[1:28:11] um
[1:28:12] last wednesday
[1:28:14] and just to give you those uh right
[1:28:17] quick and we'll go to prayer
[1:28:20] we had a prayer request to pray for the
[1:28:22] sigmund family this is my wife's
[1:28:25] uh her aunt
[1:28:26] patsy and her second oldest son
[1:28:30] was tragically killed in a car accident
[1:28:32] and
[1:28:33] that whole family has
[1:28:36] had a lot of tragedy and has suffered
[1:28:38] quite a bit you can carry on sister ruth
[1:28:40] and they you know quite a lot of uh
[1:28:43] sadness there and
[1:28:45] and over the years we've watched uh you
[1:28:48] know
[1:28:48] a lot of
[1:28:50] a lot of resistance
[1:28:52] to the truth of god's word almost not
[1:28:54] just resistance but resentment
[1:28:57] and i tell you that stuff just catches
[1:29:00] up to you and we've watched that family
[1:29:03] unfold with tragedy after tragedy after
[1:29:05] tragedy sometimes people don't think
[1:29:08] they don't stop and think what they
[1:29:10] might be coming against amen and so but
[1:29:13] nonetheless we love them and i knew the
[1:29:16] young man quite well saw him raise up
[1:29:18] from just a small boy
[1:29:20] and um
[1:29:21] he was probably of of of the three
[1:29:24] children he was probably the best one
[1:29:27] but i i can't say that for sure because
[1:29:29] i haven't been around him in quite a few
[1:29:32] years but coming up he always seemed to
[1:29:34] have
[1:29:36] such a tender heart so we want to pray
[1:29:38] for my wife's aunt patsy patsy sigmund
[1:29:41] the whole sigmund family and
[1:29:44] ask the lord to be merciful to him
[1:29:46] sometimes you never know friends god can
[1:29:48] use those kinds of things and break off
[1:29:50] years of resistance and and change a
[1:29:53] heart in a time and a time of grief
[1:29:56] that's actually
[1:29:58] imagine this now
[1:30:00] what brought
[1:30:01] sister gene
[1:30:03] to the lord was a broken heart from
[1:30:06] losing a baby to sids
[1:30:09] losing a baby hell was timothy mom three
[1:30:12] months old loses loses him in the middle
[1:30:15] of the night to sudden infant death
[1:30:18] syndrome and that broke her heart so bad
[1:30:22] that the lord was able to deal with her
[1:30:24] and she gave her heart to the lord and
[1:30:26] has never looked back
[1:30:28] so i got a brother waiting on me a man
[1:30:31] that i get to meet along with another
[1:30:33] one over there
[1:30:34] who i'm gonna
[1:30:35] probably ring his neck when i first meet
[1:30:37] him but the one i'm gonna i'm gonna you
[1:30:39] know meet him for the first time
[1:30:41] amen so we love love the lord for these

[1:34:25] such a lesson to us lord such a reality
[1:34:28] i appreciate it so much
[1:34:30] the the brother caleb's ability to make
[1:34:33] that real
[1:34:34] lord that it it wasn't some
[1:34:37] far-reaching complex
[1:34:40] thing to try to grasp somehow in our
[1:34:42] minds it just came across lord so
[1:34:45] penetrating and so real and it looked
[1:34:47] doable lord and that is such a such an
[1:34:50] ability lord of ministry to take the
[1:34:52] word of god something that's
[1:34:54] supernatural and really impossible for a
[1:34:56] human to ever achieve on their own and
[1:34:59] and presented in such a way to you you
[1:35:01] have hope to say i believe i can become
[1:35:04] that lord oh god fill up hearts tonight
[1:35:08] with that love that real
[1:35:10] not that
[1:35:12] not that marginalized deluded love that
[1:35:14] people don't even know what they what it
[1:35:16] means anymore but lord that real
[1:35:19] shekinah presence of god living in our
[1:35:22] lives it is our as brother caleb said
[1:35:24] it's our it is upon us lord it's only
[1:35:27] your bride she's the one saddled with
[1:35:29] the responsibility just like stephen
[1:35:32] it's us lord we are saddled with this
[1:35:35] responsibility to not only
[1:35:37] having to hold this love but to project
[1:35:40] it to the world there's no way we'll do
[1:35:42] that lord if our if our lives are filled
[1:35:46] up with carnality of the world father
[1:35:48] help us let us empty out his brothers
[1:35:51] said lord we die but we die daily every
[1:35:54] day more and more so that we can project
[1:35:57] because when we project that kind of
[1:35:59] love well
[1:36:01] then grace takes over oh that'll bring
[1:36:04] the holy ghost into our homes that'll
[1:36:06] that'll bring eternal life to our family
[1:36:08] and to our children that'll bind evil
