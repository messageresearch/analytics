[10:54] I've been reading lately and things
[10:56] without a
[10:58] revelation you don't know what's going
[11:01] on you don't know that the world is
[11:03] coming to an end and that pretty soon
[11:05] the bride's going to be leaving the
[11:07] scene and then chaos the Holy Spirit
[11:10] lifts when he that lth will
[11:12] L I want to be let out when he goes if
[11:16] you have a request upon your heart make
[11:19] it know one up with the hand there was a
[11:21] uh a man that had double heart lung
[11:25] double lung replacement about uh in
[11:29] January and I did job from about a week
[11:31] and a half ago then they thought he had
[11:34] double pneumonia so the next time I went
[11:36] there he wasn't there he was in the
[11:38] hospital and they turned out that his
[11:40] body was rejecting lungs so then they
[11:42] had to basically take all of his blood
[11:45] out clean it put it all back
[11:47] in two days ago was the fifth they're
[11:51] supposed to do it five days five times
[11:53] and he's feeling great you know I just
[11:56] uh I don't know if he's home yet but he
[11:58] couldn't breathe breathe and so they
[12:00] thought that's why they thought it was
[12:01] neonia so I just want to thank the Lord
[12:03] I've been praying for him and she's
[12:06] um she's a little scared you know it's
[12:09] her husband she's probably 75 years old
[12:11] so I want to remember her name is Sarah
[12:13] Kern his name is Paul

[12:22] stands with
[12:23] you but I know father that you are a
[12:26] Healer and father we just pray for Paul
[12:29] Kern his double lungs I pray that you
[12:32] would just make it all well father I
[12:34] pray that you would comfort his wife
[12:36] Sarah and Lord as we gathered together
[12:39] you saw the hands that were raised and
[12:41] father we don't just raise them
[12:43] ignorantly or just without a hope or
[12:47] faith behind it because you know the
[12:49] very thoughts and intents of our hearts

[12:54] each and every request Lord remember our

[34:39] just read a few verses out of there I'm
[34:41] going to minister to you
[34:43] tonight on the genuine atonement we
[34:47] preached last Wednesday on a true

[35:02] amen praise the Lord God bless you
[35:04] brother Isaiah amen good to have you
[35:06] here with us Amen in the house of the

[35:17] from you amen I believe the Lord is just

[35:29] when the word comes it answers the
[35:31] questions that you didn't even know you
[35:33] had it addresses the problems that you
[35:36] weren't even aware of because the Bible
[35:38] says the word is a discerner of the
[35:40] thoughts and the intents of the heart so
[35:42] when the word Goes Forth it discerns
[35:44] your heart just like in a prayer line
[35:46] that person who'd come up before brother
[35:47] brandom they didn't know what disease
[35:49] they had but through that gift he would
[35:51] identify something they didn't know now
[35:53] the word is the same way how many could
[35:56] just say here tonight Lord discern my
[35:58] heart and if I hear something tonight
[36:01] maybe I wasn't even aware that I needed
[36:02] let me uh let me be a good uh uh
[36:05] believer and say I accept it Lord Jesus
[36:08] amen let's just look at this here in
[36:10] Galatians chapter 5 and let's just begin
[36:13] reading here at verse 13 actually let's
[36:16] let's just begin at verse 14 for all the
[36:19] law is fulfilled in one word even in
[36:25] this Thou shalt love love thy neighbor
[36:28] as
[36:29] thyself but if you bite and devour one
[36:32] another take heed that you be not
[36:35] consumed one of another this I say then
[36:38] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[36:42] fulfill the lust of the flesh now it's
[36:46] important to understand as brother bham
[36:47] taught us Paul is speaking to not
[36:51] unconverted people but this is Con this
[36:54] is Christians this is believers and he's
[36:57] saying this I say then walk in the
[37:00] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[37:03] lust of the flesh so you mean that after
[37:06] I'm born again I still can walk and
[37:09] fulfill the
[37:11] lusts of the flesh amen right now let's
[37:16] look at what he talks about and what he
[37:18] calls the lust of the flesh let's look
[37:20] at it just a little bit further in verse
[37:21] 17 for the Lust For The Flesh lusteth
[37:26] against the spirit and the spirit now
[37:28] here's where you have Romans 7 again
[37:31] that when Paul says I have two people
[37:34] inside of me that which wants to do good
[37:37] and then that which that the flesh that
[37:39] I have wars against that Spirit man and
[37:42] so this is the same thing Paul is saying
[37:43] here for the flesh lusteth against the
[37:46] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[37:49] and these are contrary the one to the
[37:54] other so that you cannot not do the
[37:57] things that you would Verse 18 but if
[38:00] you be led of the spirit you are not
[38:02] under the law now the works of the flesh
[38:04] are manifest which are these
[38:08] adultery
[38:09] fornication
[38:11] uncleanness
[38:13] lasciviousness oh we thought we got away
[38:16] when we read verse 19 and thought okay
[38:18] I'm not guilty not me let's keep reading
[38:21] can we go a little further
[38:24] idolatry witchcraft
[38:27] remember these are the works of the this
[38:28] is what he calls The Works of the
[38:31] flesh he says idolatry witchcraft
[38:36] hatred variance
[38:39] emulations
[38:41] wrath Strife seditions heresies he Parks
[38:47] hatred right in with wrath sedition and
[38:51] Witchcraft amen amen
[38:55] envying murders you can murder a man
[38:58] brother bham said what more than just
[39:00] murdering him with a knife you speak
[39:02] against his character amen now that's
[39:04] not just a that's not just a meme that's
[39:06] not just a oh that was poetic that's
[39:09] real you can murder a man more than one
[39:11] way speak against his character that's
[39:13] not just good advice well you better not
[39:15] talk about somebody you you talk about
[39:17] his character brother bam says you
[39:18] assassinate assassinate that man God
[39:21] help us murders drunkenness revelings
[39:25] and such like
[39:27] of the which I tell you before as I have
[39:29] told you in time past they
[39:33] that inherit the kingdom of God but the
[39:36] fruit of the spirit so we had the works
[39:40] of the flesh now let's read the the
[39:42] fruits of the spirit is
[39:45] love
[39:46] joy peace
[39:49] longsuffering
[39:51] gentleness goodness goodness
[39:55] goodness just being good listen this is
[39:58] a fruit of the
[39:59] spirit Faith
[40:03] meekness Temperance that means
[40:07] self-control against such there is no
[40:09] law and they that are Christ have
[40:11] crucified the flesh with the affections
[40:15] and lusts if we live in the spirit let
[40:18] us also how many can raise a hand and
[40:21] say help me Lord to walk in the spirit
[40:24] Lord Jesus we just bow our heads before
[40:26] for you so mindful Lord God of how real
[40:30] your word is Lord to us to each and
[40:32] every single person Lord that's here
[40:34] tonight I as I just ask God as I stand
[40:37] with them may we just remove ourself
[40:40] Lord from the equation here tonight
[40:42] father let us not become a hindrance let
[40:44] us not become a uh Lord a father
[40:48] anything that would prevent your word
[40:50] from going forth I pray you'd help us to
[40:53] move all out of the way Lord both hearer
[40:55] and speaker tonight tonight May the Holy
[40:57] Spirit come now Lord and take control of
[40:59] my vessel Lord I pray that you'd help me
[41:02] God to communicate the burden that
[41:04] you've placed upon my heart in a way
[41:07] that would be effective Lord to your
[41:09] children we ask it now in the name of
[41:11] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can
[41:14] be seated tonight and I have some slid
[41:17] some quotes there brother if you'd go
[41:18] ahead and put that
[41:21] up I'm going to just read some quotes
[41:25] here
[41:29] and I I just want to pick up sort of
[41:32] from where we were where we left off uh
[41:34] last Wednesday and I trust that that was
[41:36] a blessing to you and that the Lord uh
[41:39] can just continue to speak that uh here
[41:41] tonight and I'm going to minister to you
[41:44] on the genuine atonement I want to show
[41:46] you from where I got this title and if
[41:49] you weren't aware if you didn't catch it
[41:51] from the last time it's from the message
[41:53] the Feast of trumpets and brother Barham
[41:55] says here here and we took time to show
[41:58] uh this and I I won't I'll just cover
[42:00] some of this just here briefly as it's
[42:02] relevant to my thought but in
[42:04] Revelations 11 their ministry will be
[42:07] the ministry of Moses and Elijah calling
[42:10] to Israel out of the Jewish Traditions
[42:14] just as the seventh Angel's message
[42:16] called The Bride out of the Pentecostal
[42:19] Traditions now we showed you last
[42:22] Wednesday how that brother brandham
[42:24] teaches this in the Feast of the trumpet
[42:27] and you could also pick this up in the
[42:28] Sixth Seal and brother brandham really
[42:30] after the Sixth Seal really lays this in
[42:32] here real strong because at the time he
[42:35] preaches the six trumpet he doesn't have
[42:37] six seal I'm sorry he doesn't have the
[42:39] revelation of the trumpets yet and and
[42:43] even the the night before he ministers
[42:46] the Feast of the trumpets he still
[42:48] doesn't have the Revelation and he's in
[42:49] his room and and he comes to his wife
[42:52] and says honey I would have got made a
[42:53] terrible mistake I was going to preach
[42:55] this and I had it wrong and so the Lord
[42:58] the Lord reveals something to him just
[43:00] like he did in the seals when before
[43:02] each seal brother Bram at the end of a
[43:05] seal would say now I don't have a clue
[43:07] what the third seal is but the same way
[43:09] that the angel of the Lord came in the
[43:11] room this afternoon and gave me the
[43:13] revelation of the second seal he'll come
[43:15] and give me the revelation of the third
[43:16] seal friends I I believe that the Lord
[43:18] did that in that way to show you that
[43:21] this wasn't the mind of a man it was the
[43:24] it was the thoughts and the mind of
[43:26] Christ and so so brother Bron begins to
[43:29] show this here that Al how under that
[43:31] sick seal how the the and then when he
[43:35] comes to the Feast of the trumpets
[43:37] brother Bron begins to show us how that
[43:39] just as the seals were to the Gentiles
[43:43] the trumpets would be to the Jews you
[43:45] remember that from last Wednesday and
[43:47] how brother bham showed that all of
[43:49] those trumpets sounded under the
[43:51] tribulation seal how that it was a a the
[43:54] sick seal was the tribulation seal I
[43:57] want to take just a moment just to slow
[43:59] down because we went through some of
[44:00] that quickly and I and I just don't want
[44:03] it to get lost uh and I also don't want
[44:05] to get bogged down in teaching as we've
[44:07] got a lot and I don't want to um uh um
[44:11] set a personal record tonight with a
[44:13] Wednesday night service um as I did last
[44:15] Wednesday I want to beat my record from
[44:17] last Wednesday if you pull on the word
[44:18] you'll help me get to the Finish Line a
[44:20] lot quicker and so uh but so notice this
[44:24] here but the prophet of God shows how
[44:26] that and he and he answers this out of
[44:29] Revelations uh chapter 9 you don't have
[44:31] to turn but I'm just going to quote it
[44:33] here because the prophet typed this six
[44:36] seal with these uh with the tribulation
[44:39] seal and how that these four Angels were
[44:42] holding back uh let's just read it here
[44:45] in ver in chapter nine and if you can uh
[44:48] turn there quickly you can read it with
[44:49] me if not just listen and the the Bi
[44:52] Bible says in Revelations 9:13 and the
[44:54] Four Angels were loosed with which were
[44:56] prepared for an hour and a day and a
[44:58] month and a year for to slay the third
[45:00] part of men uh and the number of the
[45:03] army of the horsemen were
[45:05] 200,000,000 and I heard the number of
[45:08] them and thus I saw the horses in the
[45:10] vision and them that sat on them having
[45:12] breastplates of fire and he goes all the
[45:15] way through this for the power for their
[45:17] power is in their mouth and in their
[45:18] tails and he goes to the very end
[45:21] neither they repented neither repented
[45:22] they of their murders nor of their
[45:24] sorceries nor of their fornication
[45:26] uh nor of their thefts and so the
[45:29] prophet takes time to show how that
[45:32] anytime you're looking at the seals and
[45:34] this will just be helpful to you as it
[45:36] was to me in understanding how the
[45:39] prophet could say that all of the
[45:41] trumpets sounded under the six seal and
[45:44] but yet we know that the tribulation
[45:46] period is the six seal this is easy not
[45:50] complicated and so we know that that
[45:52] tribulation seal would have a physical
[45:55] Happ happening chronologically in time
[45:58] that hasn't happened yet thank God but
[46:01] yet we know that the prophet said that
[46:03] there was also a spiritual happening
[46:06] something that happened spiritually when
[46:09] the seal broke there was a spiritual
[46:12] something that took place and he would
[46:14] go further and say that those thousand
[46:16] uh thousand times thousands uh uh uh uh
[46:20] 200 let me read it 200,000,000
[46:24] horses that were held in Revelations 9
[46:27] at the river Euphrates the prophet of
[46:29] God said were
[46:31] released
[46:33] spiritually politically and
[46:36] religiously this is simple I'm not
[46:38] getting deep and complicated here it's
[46:40] real real real real simple here just but
[46:42] it's important to understand because
[46:44] then when that breaks forth you'll get
[46:47] the Revelation it'll make everything
[46:48] make sense to you to understand that the
[46:51] seventh seal being the coming of the
[46:53] Lord is an actual event that hasn't
[46:56] hasn't the the the physical part of that
[47:00] seventh seal of the physical coming of
[47:01] the Lord Jesus has not yet taken place
[47:05] but yet we know that there's a spiritual
[47:07] application to that a revelation uh to
[47:10] that mystery that was been that's been
[47:12] given to God's elected to show us that
[47:14] just as there was a spiritual uh a
[47:17] spirit that was released under the six
[47:19] seal that's why brother brandham would
[47:21] say that that spirit that was released
[47:23] at the on these uh Chargers the river
[47:26] Euphrates he said that Spirit went into
[47:28] the atmosphere and It Came Upon men like
[47:31] Stalin and Hitler and
[47:33] musolini and that was a six seal
[47:36] pre-tribulation Spirit of persec if you
[47:39] want to know what the tribulation coming
[47:40] in the six seal just look at what
[47:42] happened when the spiritual breaking
[47:44] forth came came came forth it was a
[47:47] persecution naturally against the Jews
[47:49] to put them back in their Homeland
[47:51] right and so so brother bandam says that
[47:54] there these were angel this was
[47:56] something that happened these were
[47:58] Angels so there's there's something that
[48:01] takes place under the breaking of the of
[48:04] those seals that released an Angelic
[48:07] Ministry amen now remember a demon is an
[48:14] angel it's just a fallen angel and so
[48:17] everything that would happen under that
[48:19] Angelic release that came into the
[48:21] atmosphere whether it was a a demon
[48:23] Spirit under a fallen angel or an angel
[48:26] that would be released uh into the
[48:28] atmosphere that was a good Angel brother
[48:31] Brandon would go even further and say
[48:32] you've got an angel when you're born and
[48:34] you breathe your first breath there's an
[48:36] angel given to your life that guards you
[48:38] that protects you that leads you to an
[48:40] altar and encourages you and and and and
[48:43] listen friends I'm just preaching to
[48:45] what brother brandham T taught us and so
[48:47] we know that though as we taught last
[48:50] last Wednesday that those spirits that
[48:53] would come into the under that seal
[48:56] would be released into the atmosphere
[48:59] that is why the world is falling
[49:03] apart that's why we can't be like a boy
[49:06] whistling through a graveyard and just
[49:08] think that have time we just continue to
[49:10] go on and on and on Friends listen some
[49:12] of these things you're reading about in
[49:14] the news every single day I truly
[49:16] believe that it's just the Fulfillment
[49:18] of Prophecy and the fire's about to
[49:21] fall it ought to it ought to do
[49:23] something to us as children of God it
[49:25] ought not just to desensitize us but
[49:28] when we hear about things happening in
[49:30] Israel it ought to wake us up and and
[49:33] let us realize that Israel is God's time
[49:35] piece that what's happening over there
[49:37] in Israel God's God God's watch you want
[49:39] to know where your God's at in time
[49:41] brother bam said watch Israel look at
[49:44] what's taking place and look at what is
[49:46] taking place the world has gone
[49:49] completely insane and they don't realize
[49:51] they're under an anointing oh yeah amen
[49:56] and brother bam says that what happens
[49:58] we all know this you could we could sum
[50:01] summarize uh all of this and and and and
[50:03] in a summary you'd miss a lot of the
[50:04] details but in a summary we we we in a
[50:07] summary we know that just as two
[50:10] prophets are to appear in Revelations 11
[50:13] to Mo uh Moses and Elijah's brother B
[50:16] I'm just now we just now read it here
[50:18] you say what's happening next uh in
[50:20] Prophecy under a prophet to the Jews
[50:23] what's happening next is God's is going
[50:25] to send them the uh the the prophets of
[50:29] Moses and Elijah to turn their hearts
[50:33] back to the faith of the fathers right
[50:36] to the faith of the children this is the
[50:38] Fulfillment of Malachi chapter 4 amen
[50:42] amen now only one part of that one part
[50:44] of that is to you and one part of that's
[50:46] to the
[50:47] Jews and the same that why do you think
[50:50] brother brandham had a Ministry that was
[50:52] like it unto Moses but he also had a
[50:55] Ministry liken under Elijah because it
[50:58] would be a prophetic Ministry of Mo I
[51:00] hope you catch it tonight friends the
[51:02] same message that youve received that
[51:04] turn your hearts back is the same
[51:06] message that the Jew will hear and it
[51:09] will turn their heart back to a genuine
[51:11] atonement and the prophet said just as
[51:14] Moses and Elijah will turn the hearts of
[51:16] those Jews away from traditions and dead
[51:19] sacrifice to the genuine atonement then
[51:21] what ought the seventh Angel's message
[51:24] do to the Gentile Church it ought to
[51:26] turn our hearts back to a genuine
[51:30] atonement Hallelujah and further than
[51:33] that he opened his Bible and that the
[51:36] the but it wasn't just Moses and Elijah
[51:38] Don't let me stopped there it was also
[51:39] the Joshua commission
[51:42] am as I was with Moses so shall I be
[51:45] unto so shall I be to you this was the
[51:48] ministry I hope that that's
[51:50] understandable this was the ministry
[51:52] that we've received listen now listen
[51:54] with that in mind now you'll understand
[51:56] where he's at in Revelations 11 when
[51:58] he's quoting in Feast of the trumpets in
[52:00] Revelations 11 call their ministry will
[52:02] be the ministry of Moses and Elijah
[52:04] calling to Israel out of the remember
[52:08] what he does to the Jews he first does
[52:10] to the Gentiles
[52:14] amen so he says he says out of the
[52:17] Jewish Traditions just as the seventh
[52:20] Angel's message called The Bride out of
[52:23] the Pentecostal
[52:25] tradition amen remember Moses and Elijah
[52:29] to call Israel out of the old
[52:33] atonement now type this here if you're
[52:36] spiritual at all if you study the
[52:38] message at all you you're you're type so
[52:41] start going off like crazy because
[52:43] brother brandham is going to type how he
[52:45] called them out of an old atonement or
[52:47] an old
[52:49] system just the same exact way he calls
[52:52] the bride out of Pentecostal systems or
[52:56] old atonement amen right he says out of
[53:01] the old atonement of the lamb and sheep
[53:03] and blood and goats and sacrifice to the
[53:05] Real Living
[53:07] Sacrifice to the word I love this and
[53:11] the seventh Angel's message under the
[53:13] same trumpet same everything the same
[53:16] seal is to what call the people how many
[53:20] of the people the bride out of the
[53:22] Pentecostal and World tradition
[53:25] to the genuine atonement the word
[53:30] amen Christ listen let's go further
[53:35] impersonated in his word here made flesh
[53:40] Among Us
[53:42] amen so what was that son of man
[53:45] Ministry to do to bring the bride out of
[53:49] the old
[53:50] atonement into the genuine atonement
[53:54] Christ in
[53:55] impersonated in his word here
[54:00] amen now what does brother bandam say my
[54:04] our pastor just read it I think Sunday
[54:06] when he quoted out of the trial and
[54:08] brother brandom says I challenge you to
[54:11] see the son of man the word made flesh
[54:16] revealed in the prophet's body that's
[54:18] not what he
[54:20] said in the bride's body you see many
[54:24] people can see the son of man Ministry
[54:26] in a prophet some people can't some
[54:28] people can go as afar as to see what
[54:31] that sign of the son of man was when he
[54:33] was impersonated in the ministry of
[54:35] God's Prophet but can you go a little
[54:37] bit further and realize that that same
[54:39] impersonation of the ministry of Christ
[54:41] and a prophet would have to be
[54:43] Revelations 10:7 and 8 thou must
[54:47] prophesy
[54:48] again so the word has to be impersonated
[54:52] in the
[54:53] bride amen
[54:55] and you've got to be a willing vessel to
[54:57] say Lord can I have enough Faith to
[55:00] believe in the son of
[55:02] godl can I have enough Faith to believe
[55:05] that the Son of God was the word made
[55:08] flesh he was deity in a human body can
[55:12] we have faith to believe that can we
[55:14] have faith to believe that in our
[55:15] generation we had a prophet of God stand
[55:18] behind a pull pit showing the sign of
[55:21] the son of
[55:22] man fulfilling rep fulfilling Luke
[55:27] 17 can we go that far now can we go a
[55:30] little bit further and realize that the
[55:32] same sign of the word made flesh wasn't
[55:34] going to stop at Jesus it wasn't going
[55:36] to stop at Paul it wasn't going to stop
[55:38] at brother brandom it would move all the
[55:41] way down into maturity of all of the
[55:43] seed of God to where Christ is
[55:47] impersonated his nature his life his
[55:50] love his
[55:51] acts amen would be identified in the
[55:54] bride of Jesus Christ those in the bride
[55:56] will do the very Works Jesus did that's
[55:59] a direct quote from brother brandham now
[56:01] do you believe
[56:02] that amen those in the bride will do the
[56:05] very works that Jesus
[56:09] did they would have his life now let me
[56:11] get to my thought here to a genuine
[56:14] atonement they would turn them notice to
[56:16] the genuine atonement Christ
[56:19] impersonated in his word made flesh
[56:22] Among Us science has proved it that's
[56:24] why the trial message you go a little
[56:26] bit further and brother random says not
[56:28] a nail scarred Jesus we don't look for a
[56:31] nail scarred Jesus that's the old
[56:35] atonement now don't let that choke you
[56:37] that's not to say that that there wasn't
[56:39] a nail scarred Jesus that's not to say
[56:41] that Calvary is is NL and void and done
[56:43] away with no friends but Calvary was
[56:47] facilitating the spirit that would come
[56:49] back on the church at the day of
[56:51] Pentecost
[56:53] amen but brother says not it we don't as
[56:56] the bride we don't look for a nail
[56:58] scarred hands or a crown of thorns we
[57:02] look for the word made flesh amen amen
[57:08] they miss it they miss it the world
[57:10] misses it listen that's only to a select
[57:12] group of people and you can't convince
[57:14] someone of it because you couldn't be
[57:15] convinced of that you see God God was
[57:18] going to give his church the God's going
[57:20] to give his the bride a weapon and it
[57:22] wasn't going to be intellect amen
[57:25] amen and it wasn't going to be some
[57:27] speaking in tongues emotion that's
[57:29] wonderful but what it wasn't going to be
[57:32] intellect and it wasn't going to be a
[57:33] gift of the spirit it was going to be a
[57:35] power of Revelation that the gates of
[57:37] hell can't Prevail against it you see
[57:40] the gates of hell can Prevail against a
[57:41] gift of the spirit it can Prevail
[57:43] against a human intellect but when
[57:45] Revelation drops in your heart it's an
[57:47] anchor that even when you can't explain
[57:50] it or you don't understand it yourself
[57:52] you still believe it and you still
[57:54] accept it because that's the power of
[57:56] Revelation that only God's family has
[57:59] amen and he notice he says this here he
[58:02] says here let me follow it here on mine
[58:04] also and he says to the genuine
[58:07] atonement uh the genuine atonement
[58:09] there's my sermon title Christ
[58:11] impersonated in his word here made flesh
[58:15] Among Us science has proved it by
[58:20] pictures and so we know that I'm just
[58:22] going to take just a moment here I'm
[58:24] already almost out of time my goodness
[58:28] gracious thank you I will notice so so
[58:32] even even this brother Brandon begins to
[58:34] tell us that the Mysteries that were the
[58:38] the revelations 10:7 when the seventh
[58:40] angel begins to sound then all the
[58:43] mysteries of God would be finished now
[58:45] the prophet uh inur as this the time he
[58:48] begins to tell he even quotes from the
[58:50] SC Scofield bible and he says now notice
[58:53] what are these Mysteries that are to be
[58:55] given back to the church what are some
[58:57] of these Mysteries and brother Ron
[58:59] begins to quote right from his notes he
[59:00] said you want to read it right out of
[59:01] your scofi Bible and he begins to quote
[59:04] the Mysteries that SC scoffield is is is
[59:07] saying brother begins to read them off
[59:09] the mystery of the atonement The Mystery
[59:10] of the of of of baptism the the the
[59:13] mystery of the church The Mystery of the
[59:15] and then brother bman search after all
[59:17] of those and he says and may I say this
[59:19] The Mystery of the serpent seed the
[59:22] mystery of true water baptism in Jesus
[59:25] name the mystery of the nature of
[59:27] godliness that God is not three uh he's
[59:31] not one like your fingers one but but
[59:33] he's the same God in three offices three
[59:37] manifestations right and brother Brandon
[59:39] begins to say had the mystery of
[59:41] iniquity and so we know that the world
[59:43] is living under this even the Apostle
[59:46] Paul uh begins to to to to tell us this
[59:49] and he begins to prophesy that in the
[59:51] last days there would be a great Fallen
[59:53] of away a great Falling Away we know
[59:55] this in our Bible he warns us that that
[59:58] the spirit of antichrist would come in
[1:00:00] and take over men's Hearts is this good
[1:00:03] is this this is real basic here and so
[1:00:06] we notice that that that uh that this is
[1:00:08] right in your Bible it talks about the
[1:00:10] man of sin it talks about the son of
[1:00:13] predition and so you know people have
[1:00:16] have have so just as we read out of the
[1:00:18] trumpets people can so literalize things
[1:00:22] and put it off somewhere down the road
[1:00:25] and they miss the spiritual application
[1:00:27] that's happening right
[1:00:29] now just like to believe that the that
[1:00:32] the six seal is just the tribulation
[1:00:34] period after the bride is gone is to
[1:00:35] miss the Revelation that at the breaking
[1:00:37] of that seal there was a spirit that
[1:00:39] came in into the Earth
[1:00:42] amen and so so um let me just stop here
[1:00:46] for a minute in 2 Thessalonians chapter
[1:00:48] 2 and verse 8 we'll come back to that
[1:00:52] the Bible says that the man of sin let's
[1:00:54] just look at it second 2 Thessalonians
[1:00:56] chapter 2 you can follow me if you want
[1:00:58] quickly brother Josh if you're fast um
[1:01:01] on the draw there you can follow me if
[1:01:03] not don't don't don't uh don't even
[1:01:05] worry about it I'll just go through
[1:01:06] these some just quickly and so the Bible
[1:01:10] says that there's a man of sin how many
[1:01:12] believe
[1:01:13] that and so we could look at that
[1:01:16] literally and we could say there's the
[1:01:19] man of sin the the the this the uh the
[1:01:23] son of predition
[1:01:25] and those are you say is that going to
[1:01:27] be a real person let's not look at just
[1:01:29] the literal uh fact of that but let's
[1:01:32] look at the spiritual application of
[1:01:34] that we do know there will be literally
[1:01:36] be a real person right the false prophet
[1:01:39] right and so we know that in the
[1:01:41] tribulation after the church is gone
[1:01:43] there will be a real man of sin there
[1:01:44] will be the
[1:01:47] Antichrist how many believe that Christ
[1:01:49] is
[1:01:51] real how many believe that there's an
[1:01:53] actual Jesus Christ the the person the
[1:01:57] perfect lamb the Spotless sinless
[1:01:59] sacrifice my savior is a real living
[1:02:02] person he's not a figment of your
[1:02:04] imagination he's not just a feeling that
[1:02:06] you feel in the air but there's a real
[1:02:10] Jesus
[1:02:12] right uh who who sits on the throne as a
[1:02:15] perfect sacrifice interceding for your
[1:02:18] sins on behalf of your sins but just as
[1:02:21] I believe that there's a real physical
[1:02:23] Jesus I also believe that there's a
[1:02:25] spirit of Christ that lives in my heart
[1:02:28] that lives in your heart that I can feel
[1:02:30] that I can sense amen I I preach the we
[1:02:34] we we believe that we we can feel the
[1:02:36] spirit of Christ how many here believes
[1:02:38] we can have the spirit of
[1:02:41] Christ and so if we believe there's a
[1:02:43] physical Christ but yet there's the
[1:02:45] spirit of Jesus that lives in us then
[1:02:48] there must also of necessity be a real
[1:02:53] Antichrist
[1:02:55] and a spirit of
[1:02:57] antichrist that can indwell people's
[1:03:00] hearts is that simple
[1:03:03] enough and so just as the spirit of
[1:03:06] Christ enters the true church the spirit
[1:03:09] of antichrist enters the false
[1:03:13] Church in fact that's why brother Bram
[1:03:15] said that the false Church always
[1:03:17] persecuted the true church right and so
[1:03:21] the Bible says in second Thessalonians
[1:03:22] 2:8 whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:03:24] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:03:27] with the brightness of his coming so
[1:03:30] there is an
[1:03:31] antichrist amen amen and there's also a
[1:03:36] spirit of
[1:03:40] antichrist who
[1:03:42] exists now yeah
[1:03:46] hello I'm just going to say it again
[1:03:48] there's a real savior who lives in glory
[1:03:50] right now exists he's a living person
[1:03:53] he's real just as real and even though
[1:03:55] he's God uh and we're here on Earth his
[1:03:58] Spirit dwells within us amen and because
[1:04:01] you are Sons we know Galatians 4:6
[1:04:04] because you are son so he has sent the
[1:04:07] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:04:11] whereby you cry Abba
[1:04:13] Father so I'm just taking just a moment
[1:04:16] here to show you very clearly that if
[1:04:17] you believe that then you ought not to
[1:04:20] stumble on the fact of the same way that
[1:04:22] a real Spirit of Christ could dwell
[1:04:24] inside people and could anoint
[1:04:27] people then so the spirit of the
[1:04:30] Antichrist can also anoint men's
[1:04:34] Hearts amen and so we we we we see that
[1:04:38] clearly and the Bible says that there's
[1:04:41] a spirit of Christ at work in the body
[1:04:45] of Christ yes amen do you believe that
[1:04:49] the spirit of Christ is at work in the
[1:04:51] world so also we must also believe that
[1:04:54] the spirit of
[1:04:56] antichrist is at work in the world
[1:05:02] Amen and what is the spirit of Christ
[1:05:05] doing it is preparing our hearts to
[1:05:09] receive the person of
[1:05:12] Christ I said what is the spirit of
[1:05:15] Christ at work doing he's molding your
[1:05:18] character he's molding your nature he's
[1:05:21] convicting you of sin that's why you
[1:05:24] can't get away with it that's why you
[1:05:26] can't get away from it listen you would
[1:05:29] have walked away from this thing a long
[1:05:30] time ago but there's the spirit of
[1:05:32] Christ that won't let you get away with
[1:05:35] it he won't let you get away from it oh
[1:05:38] I'm so glad that there's an there's an
[1:05:40] advocate I have an intercessor with the
[1:05:43] father who fights for me who prays for
[1:05:47] me
[1:05:49] Hallelujah and so what is the spirit of
[1:05:51] Christ now doing in God's en his body
[1:05:54] he's preparing his
[1:05:58] family to receive him amen and if you
[1:06:03] can't receive his word now you can't
[1:06:06] receive him
[1:06:09] then I said those that can't receive his
[1:06:13] word now can't receive
[1:06:16] him oh I would have if I was in the days
[1:06:19] of Jesus I would have stood up for him I
[1:06:22] I I would have stood against those
[1:06:23] Romans soldiers I would have stood
[1:06:25] against Judas I would I would have been
[1:06:27] one of those listen brother brandom says
[1:06:29] hold on a minute you want to know what
[1:06:30] you would have done then what are you
[1:06:32] doing right now with the word for your
[1:06:36] day what is the word for our day the
[1:06:39] message of the hour I'll just make it
[1:06:41] plain if you can't receive the message
[1:06:44] of your hour you can't receive Christ
[1:06:46] because Christ is his
[1:06:50] word you know what that ought to do that
[1:06:52] ought to make you so happy that you can
[1:06:54] say I'm so glad I can accept the message
[1:06:57] of the hour because I can accept the
[1:07:00] message that means I can accept
[1:07:05] Christ and so if you can't accept the me
[1:07:07] if you can't accept Christ here now you
[1:07:10] want to accept him then so if there's a
[1:07:13] spirit of Christ at work then we must
[1:07:16] also say that there's a spirit of the
[1:07:20] Antichrist at work amen right
[1:07:25] if there's a spirit of Christ possessing
[1:07:28] his family then what do you think's
[1:07:30] possessing the Antichrist
[1:07:34] family now those Antichrist family we
[1:07:38] know who they are brother mat but the
[1:07:39] the the family of the
[1:07:41] Antichrist is those you know hard
[1:07:43] heathens with you know hard a you know
[1:07:46] heavy metal death metal no then it's
[1:07:49] Voodoo Witchcraft and witches and and
[1:07:52] all kinds of wiah and Ouija boards no no
[1:07:55] no no no
[1:07:56] no no you see this the family of Satan
[1:08:00] the family of the Antichrist is just as
[1:08:03] religious as Abel
[1:08:07] was and just as there's a spirit just as
[1:08:11] there's a spirit and Ministry and word
[1:08:14] that goes forth from the true Christ
[1:08:17] there's also a Ministry that anoints
[1:08:19] there's a spirit of antichrist that
[1:08:21] anoints a false Ministry to deceive
[1:08:23] people
[1:08:24] yes that's why brother bandom said
[1:08:26] they'd go to church thinking they're
[1:08:27] worshiping God and they're worshiping
[1:08:29] the devil and they don't know it
[1:08:33] amen so there's a spirit of antichrist
[1:08:36] at work and you say brother Matt what is
[1:08:39] that Spirit doing just as the spirit of
[1:08:42] Christ is doing the Antichrist through
[1:08:45] his ministry through his music through
[1:08:48] his anointing through his word through
[1:08:51] social platforms political platforms
[1:08:53] relig just platforms he is preparing the
[1:08:57] hearts of his people to receive
[1:09:04] him that's why you look at the Bible and
[1:09:06] you go how in the world in the tribul
[1:09:08] how are they going to accept this false
[1:09:09] prophet how are because their hearts are
[1:09:12] being prepared to receive him
[1:09:18] now I said their hearts he's preparing
[1:09:21] their hearts to receive
[1:09:24] him now 1 John 4:3 very familiar
[1:09:27] scripture this 1 John 4 chapter 4 1 John
[1:09:32] chapter
[1:09:33] 4:3 this is that Spirit of
[1:09:39] antichrist now hold on brother Matt the
[1:09:41] Antichrist now hold on hold on don't
[1:09:42] confuse me because the Antichrist that's
[1:09:45] in the tribulation period it is but
[1:09:49] don't miss what's happening now right
[1:09:51] amen and every Spirit notice that
[1:09:53] confesses Christ has come in the and
[1:09:55] every spirit that confesses not that
[1:09:57] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
[1:09:59] not of God and this is that Spirit of
[1:10:03] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[1:10:05] it should come amen and even
[1:10:10] now already is in the world
[1:10:13] Amen so there's a
[1:10:16] coming yeah there's a happening coming
[1:10:19] but then don't miss what's happening
[1:10:21] right now oh friends I hope you're I
[1:10:23] hope you can catch it tonight there's a
[1:10:25] coming of the Lord that's going to take
[1:10:26] place but there's a coming of the Lord
[1:10:28] happening right now there's a jubilee
[1:10:31] that's going to sound one day but
[1:10:33] there's a jubilee in my heart that's
[1:10:35] already sounded I'm going to shout there
[1:10:37] but I'm going to shout here I'm going to
[1:10:39] worship there but I'm going to worship
[1:10:41] here there's something coming physically
[1:10:44] but there's something spiritually that
[1:10:46] takes place
[1:10:48] first Hallelujah you love
[1:10:52] him and so so let me just say it this
[1:10:55] way he says you have heard about the
[1:10:57] coming it's been preached it's been a
[1:10:59] taught you're expecting his arrival but
[1:11:01] I want you to wake up to something that
[1:11:04] spirit is already at work right now amen
[1:11:09] he's not going to suddenly appear on the
[1:11:11] scene and burst out of somewhere and
[1:11:14] then overwhelm everybody it's not what's
[1:11:18] going to happen but rather his spirit is
[1:11:20] mysteriously at work now setting his
[1:11:23] Kingdom up now amen in the
[1:11:27] hearts of people that claim to be
[1:11:31] Christians
[1:11:32] amen amen now let me just I I'm just
[1:11:35] right here in the word I'm not not not
[1:11:37] way off in left field so you can amen
[1:11:39] this this is not Al in
[1:11:40] leftfield he's setting up his kingdom
[1:11:43] now in the hearts of people that will
[1:11:47] accept him through a dry-eyed confession
[1:11:50] that's the spirit of antichrist amen
[1:11:53] he's setting up his kingdom now in
[1:11:56] coldness and
[1:11:57] indifference he's working in the hearts
[1:12:00] of people that's where hatred comes from
[1:12:02] that's where wrath comes from that's
[1:12:04] where Envy comes from that's where
[1:12:06] jealousy comes from that doesn't come
[1:12:09] from the holy
[1:12:10] spirit that comes from an evil
[1:12:13] spirit I ought to get a really loud
[1:12:17] amen and so so he's he's he he you say
[1:12:21] brother Matt where is the spirit of anti
[1:12:23] Christ at work now it's at work in
[1:12:26] coldness it's at work in compromise come
[1:12:29] on somebody help me preach it's at work
[1:12:32] when people compromise the
[1:12:34] word amen and when he finally when the
[1:12:38] man of sin finally appears and is
[1:12:40] revealed to the world he'll be revealed
[1:12:43] to a world that's already prepared to
[1:12:46] receive
[1:12:48] him this is where you see anti-Semitism
[1:12:51] come from this is where you see racism
[1:12:53] come from this is where are you name any
[1:12:55] Spirit you want to name it came from the
[1:12:58] pits of hell and it's been exacerbated
[1:13:02] from the six seal pre-tribulation
[1:13:04] anointing that comes upon the world
[1:13:06] that's what you're living in right now
[1:13:08] friends Paul warned of this he says in
[1:13:10] cians 2: 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity
[1:13:13] this is second 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for
[1:13:16] the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:13:19] already work amen it's already working
[1:13:24] yeah only he who now leth will let until
[1:13:28] he be taken out of the way now brother
[1:13:30] bham picks this up in Daniel 70 weeks
[1:13:33] and says who is that who is he who now
[1:13:36] lth will let prophet of God says that's
[1:13:39] the Holy Ghost but where is the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost Inside of his family amen so what
[1:13:45] do you think's going to happen when
[1:13:47] God's family do you realize that the
[1:13:50] heart of a fervent
[1:13:52] believer is is what's holding back the
[1:13:55] wrath of God from the
[1:13:59] earth friends I don't know if we realize
[1:14:01] how different we are than most people
[1:14:03] right amen I don't think we realize
[1:14:05] sometimes how different we are than most
[1:14:07] people amen how the littlest things in
[1:14:11] your life that might seem so minuscule
[1:14:14] to other people yet they're so large to
[1:14:17] us oh yes amen and if you ever told
[1:14:21] someone some of the things that you
[1:14:22] grieve over I'm not talking about major
[1:14:24] heinous sins I'm talking about things in
[1:14:26] your personality things in your
[1:14:28] character the littlest things that some
[1:14:30] people would look at and go come on give
[1:14:32] me a break we're all
[1:14:34] human yet God won't let you say
[1:14:39] thaten God won't let you settle and just
[1:14:42] resign to the fact that you're just
[1:14:44] going to have a temper CU you're human
[1:14:45] and that's just part of your Fallen
[1:14:48] nature do you realize how different you
[1:14:50] are because the Holy Ghost is inside you
[1:14:52] and fervent see that's that's not your
[1:14:55] righteousness that's the righteousness
[1:14:56] of God whereas the rest of the world

[1:15:41] it the Bible says he convicts us of sin
[1:15:48] hello notice what brother bandam says

[1:15:52] in our PowerPoint if you you could just
[1:15:53] display that again just for a moment uh

[1:16:43] needs it needs a new heart it needs the
[1:16:47] Holy Spirit it needs that great unction
[1:16:52] to make a shout that great unction to
[1:16:54] make us dance and have joy
[1:16:57] unspeakable it needs that's what the
[1:16:59] church needs now more than ever before
[1:17:01] we need to have an emotional frenzy
[1:17:03] where everybody's jumping and screaming
[1:17:05] and hollering and
[1:17:06] shouting hey I'm all for it sign me up
[1:17:10] amen but I'm going to tell you what
[1:17:12] brother brandom says the church needs it
[1:17:15] needs that great unction that changes
[1:17:17] men and women's
[1:17:20] lives amen listen I'm for jumping
[1:17:23] shouting dancing screaming we ought to
[1:17:25] have more of it amen but at the end of
[1:17:28] all of your jumping and dancing and
[1:17:30] screaming if your life isn't
[1:17:32] changed to back to the genuine atonement
[1:17:37] amen amen
[1:17:40] hello he says it needs that great
[1:17:44] unction that changes I love this that
[1:17:48] changes men and
[1:17:51] women's lives amen how God promised that
[1:17:56] he would take the old Stony heart now
[1:17:59] listen to this how he would take the old
[1:18:03] Stony
[1:18:04] heart says Ezekiel 36 you know the
[1:18:07] scripture very well I'll take out the
[1:18:10] Heart of Stone this was the promise of
[1:18:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost do we
[1:18:16] realize that this is one of the main
[1:18:18] themes of what the Holy Ghost was to
[1:18:21] bring was it going to bring outing sure
[1:18:24] was the Holy Ghost when it poured out
[1:18:26] upon our flesh was they going to speak
[1:18:27] in tongues and prophesy sure but don't
[1:18:31] leave off the main
[1:18:35] thing the main thing is that it would
[1:18:38] change people's
[1:18:45] lives I'll will give you a new heart and
[1:18:49] then he says and I'll take out take away
[1:18:51] the Stony heart and I I will give you a
[1:18:53] heart of Flesh and then he says and I
[1:18:55] will give you a new heart and my spirit
[1:18:57] will I pour into you Hallelujah God
[1:19:00] promised he take the old Stony heart so
[1:19:03] you mean brother Matt that as a Believer
[1:19:05] I don't have to live with my old Stony
[1:19:10] heartall no you don't
[1:19:13] brother then when this happens a change
[1:19:17] has been
[1:19:20] made Call Me Crazy but I cannot get away
[1:19:24] from this word change amen I can't get
[1:19:29] away from it last last week the Lord's
[1:19:31] just been my goodness every time it
[1:19:33] comes over me I just to be honest with
[1:19:35] you I I weep and cry
[1:19:39] anguish you say brother Matt why what is
[1:19:42] that because I realize how far away how
[1:19:45] far I am from the
[1:19:47] promise I see my own life and my own
[1:19:50] heart and my own
[1:19:51] nature
[1:19:53] and I realized that the nature of the
[1:19:55] token that the the promise of the token
[1:19:58] is the life of the
[1:19:59] Lamb comes back on the
[1:20:03] worshipper and I just sit there and weep
[1:20:05] and grieve and say God change me Lord I
[1:20:08] need it so
[1:20:09] bad it changes men that's why that quote
[1:20:13] last Wednesday meant so much to me when
[1:20:14] brother brandom says I don't want that
[1:20:16] in my life
[1:20:18] amen how God promised when that happens
[1:20:21] a change has
[1:20:23] been made let's go a little bit further
[1:20:26] and he says now in preaching these
[1:20:29] things even to the Pentecostal people
[1:20:33] uhoh and we have very little to brag
[1:20:36] about for in where we have tried to have
[1:20:39] a Pentecostal free move of God we have
[1:20:42] become to a place of a bunch of
[1:20:45] colonized
[1:20:48] Cults I wonder if this could be said
[1:20:50] about message people oh yeah amen and he
[1:20:53] says we don't have much to brag about in
[1:20:55] the Pentecostal group we have become to
[1:20:57] a place of a bunch of colonized
[1:21:01] Cults just a place of
[1:21:04] confusion and Discord what ought to
[1:21:08] happen here this afternoon there should
[1:21:10] be every Pentecostal Church in the city
[1:21:12] jammed into some big Stadium out here
[1:21:14] somewhere and if it wasn't for little
[1:21:18] petty indifferences among never would
[1:21:22] have believed
[1:21:23] it the
[1:21:26] ministers and notice when it gets on the
[1:21:28] ministers it gets on the
[1:21:30] people it would be that way amongst a
[1:21:34] lot of people this is then that is that
[1:21:35] was why is that so many Christians find
[1:21:37] it so hard to live at a real Christian
[1:21:39] Life this is enticing Spirits amongst a
[1:21:42] lot of people we find where emotions and
[1:21:45] so forth but the matter you preaching
[1:21:47] against emotions let me be on the record
[1:21:49] before I get labeled and cancelled I'm
[1:21:52] not not against emotion amen right you
[1:21:56] want your voice to be heard online give
[1:21:57] me a hearty amen this church is not
[1:21:59] against
[1:22:01] emotion amen notice we're not against
[1:22:05] emotion I went too far again and he says
[1:22:08] but amongst a lot of people we find
[1:22:10] where emotions and so forth there
[1:22:12] becomes
[1:22:14] paddling and back bitings and all kinds
[1:22:20] of little character flaws
[1:22:24] little things that God will wink at at
[1:22:25] the end of it all he'll wink at it and
[1:22:27] you'll still go in the Rapture
[1:22:30] anyway it's amazing how we categorize
[1:22:32] sin yeah but to God it's all either sin
[1:22:36] it's either unbelief or
[1:22:39] belief all kinds of ungodly things
[1:22:42] listen to this brother that sulfuric
[1:22:45] acid in the
[1:22:46] church what is tattling and back bitings
[1:22:51] amen I I'll say it further it's sulfuric
[1:22:54] acid in your family it's sulfuric acid
[1:22:57] in our marriage it's sulfuric acid in
[1:23:00] our hearts amen and he goes further and
[1:23:03] says it's demon
[1:23:06] power
[1:23:08] amen Spirit of men and women who get
[1:23:10] among one another and try to push off
[1:23:13] and say this is not right and this is
[1:23:16] not right and that's not right if you
[1:23:18] chase it down nine times out of 10 it's
[1:23:20] the very person making the stir that's
[1:23:22] not right
[1:23:23] amen God hates Discord among Brethren
[1:23:28] amen God hates Discord among Brethren
[1:23:33] God you know sort of doesn't like it so
[1:23:36] much he you know he it's less than
[1:23:38] preferable is that what he
[1:23:40] said no no no no I'm just reading you
[1:23:42] right out of the message of the hour
[1:23:44] that you say you believe amen God hates
[1:23:48] Discord one of the seven things he hates
[1:23:50] brother B's only quoting the scripture

[1:23:53] reverent be holy love God stand by him
[1:23:58] and as long as you know your life is

[1:24:44] him and said put away your sword Peter

[1:25:18] right your dress ain't got a thing

[1:25:22] skirt down to the floor dragging the

[1:25:26] don't care how holy our lives are if we

[1:26:06] etheral listen friends I'm only pointing
[1:26:08] you back to the genuine
[1:26:11] atonement this is the genuine atonement
[1:26:14] you want to know what the seals were to
[1:26:16] produce this am
[1:26:20] amen notice fussing and drawing barriers
[1:26:23] and things that's the reason the church
[1:26:26] is not going on it's true if you'd ever
[1:26:29] break down your walls let this one be
[1:26:32] this and that one be that whatever you
[1:26:33] are doesn't matter but when you can put
[1:26:36] your hands in your brother's hands and
[1:26:39] call him your brother amen and we're
[1:26:42] working for one cause yes that's the
[1:26:45] kingdom of
[1:26:46] God if it ever gets to a place that I
[1:26:50] couldn't put my arm around any brother
[1:26:53] that's working for the kingdom of God
[1:26:55] and recognize him as my brother I feel
[1:26:58] I'm
[1:27:00] backslid Amen brother Luther I'm glad
[1:27:03] you
[1:27:04] agree come on friends I know this is
[1:27:06] heavy but it's you ought to be you ought
[1:27:08] you ought to just reach out and grab
[1:27:10] that and say God if I ever get to the
[1:27:12] place to where I can't put my arm around
[1:27:14] any brother that's working for the
[1:27:16] kingdom of God and call him my brother
[1:27:18] then I ought to feel that I'm backslid
[1:27:21] amen I be scared to stand on the
[1:27:24] platform and face evil spirits to know
[1:27:27] that I had Envy in my heart against any
[1:27:31] brother no matter who he is that's
[1:27:34] trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[1:27:37] Christ or live a Christian Life remember
[1:27:41] the title where I think Pentecost failed
[1:27:44] Christians now this is what this is here
[1:27:46] I'm just going to read these and and
[1:27:48] then we're done with these quotes
[1:27:50] Christians you must have a personal
[1:27:53] relationship to God how many believe
[1:27:55] that in order to be a Son of God you
[1:27:57] must become relation to God he must be
[1:28:00] your father in order for you to be a son
[1:28:02] and only his sons and daughters are
[1:28:03] saved not the members of a church but
[1:28:05] Sons and Daughters there's only one
[1:28:07] thing that will produce that that's the
[1:28:10] new birth not shaking a preacher's hand
[1:28:13] not being a Son of a Preacher not
[1:28:15] growing up in a message church I don't
[1:28:17] care what it is there's only one thing
[1:28:19] that makes you a Son of God that's to be
[1:28:21] born again by the spirit of God which
[1:28:23] comes only through repentance of sins
[1:28:27] amen amen and he says there's only one
[1:28:30] thing that'll produce that that's the
[1:28:31] new birth the new birth is the only
[1:28:32] thing that will produce relationship to
[1:28:34] God is that
[1:28:36] right Sons and Daughters then when this
[1:28:39] takes place then when men here's the
[1:28:41] question I want to get to you the man
[1:28:43] says what do we do then after we've been
[1:28:47] born again good question what do we do
[1:28:51] I've got born again now what do we do
[1:28:52] brother brandham so many asked me that
[1:28:54] question what should I do then brother
[1:28:56] brandham if you're born again notice
[1:28:59] your entire nature is
[1:29:04] changed he didn't leave off anything
[1:29:07] right your entire nature is changed well
[1:29:13] if I've got a personality and I'm just
[1:29:15] an independent person and that's just my
[1:29:17] personality surely the Holy Ghost
[1:29:19] doesn't take that away oh well if you're
[1:29:21] coming back to the genuine atonement
[1:29:24] amen it doesn't leave anything off and
[1:29:28] there's no excuses for any part of our
[1:29:30] nature our personality listen what is
[1:29:33] the evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost that you can put an amen and
[1:29:37] punctuate every
[1:29:39] word with an
[1:29:43] Amen brother bam says your entire Nature
[1:29:46] has changed you are dead to the things
[1:29:49] you once thought notice is the message
[1:29:52] is your life worthy of the
[1:29:57] Gospel what a what a what a sermon is
[1:30:00] your life is my life worthy of the
[1:30:03] Gospel why you say brother brandham when
[1:30:05] I joined church I got that well then God
[1:30:07] said Jesus Christ is him yesterday today
[1:30:09] and forever he still heals the sick he
[1:30:11] still shows Visions what brother Brandon
[1:30:13] my church now you're not born again
[1:30:16] right notice what he does he points to
[1:30:18] right when he quotes the word and then
[1:30:20] they stumble and they they they can't
[1:30:22] accept that brother B says that's proof
[1:30:24] you're not born again yeah if you can
[1:30:27] accept the entirety if you can't accept
[1:30:30] the word of God it proves you're not
[1:30:33] born of the spirit of God because the
[1:30:36] this is listen friends brother Brandon
[1:30:37] would take this he would take this this
[1:30:40] uh question what is the evidence of the
[1:30:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he would
[1:30:46] answer it over I could feel I could read
[1:30:48] before you tonight and be here till
[1:30:50] Sunday reading quote after quote after
[1:30:51] quote where the prophet of God clearly
[1:30:54] starts always stands between two things
[1:30:57] and he says at first I believe the
[1:30:59] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:01] Ghost was love sounded good yeah that's
[1:31:05] what he said he said sounded good truly
[1:31:08] must be the fruits of the spirit if it's
[1:31:10] not love brother B said sounded good but
[1:31:12] it wasn't love and he said because I've
[1:31:14] seen Christian Science and he said I've
[1:31:15] seen men that could have love more more
[1:31:17] human love than any Christian could ever
[1:31:20] have brother B says then what is the
[1:31:22] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:23] Ghost well it must be the fruits of the
[1:31:26] spirit now the fruits of the spirit is
[1:31:28] important love is important all of these
[1:31:30] things that brother brandham says are
[1:31:32] not the evidence doesn't make them less
[1:31:35] than
[1:31:39] essential don't take something brother
[1:31:41] and that's not the evidence and well it
[1:31:43] must mean we don't even need it Sho get
[1:31:44] to the side I don't even need you no
[1:31:47] he's only saying it's not the evidence I
[1:31:51] don't brother brother B even in one
[1:31:52] place says I'm not saying it's not the
[1:31:54] evidence of the Holy Ghost he says I'm
[1:31:57] simply he says I'm not saying it's not
[1:31:59] the evidence of the manifestation of the
[1:32:01] Holy Ghost I'm only saying it's not the
[1:32:04] evidence that the person has the Holy
[1:32:07] Ghost this is important I'm going to
[1:32:09] slow down here for a minute because I
[1:32:10] believe it's so essential that we get
[1:32:13] that we get this clearly established in
[1:32:16] in especially our young people's hearts
[1:32:18] what does it mean what is the evidence
[1:32:20] of the Holy Ghost brother R say he says
[1:32:22] it can't be it can't be the fruits of
[1:32:25] the spirit because Christian Science can
[1:32:27] produce that better than anybody but
[1:32:29] does that mean we don't need the fruits
[1:32:31] of the
[1:32:34] spirit I'm telling you what I've watched
[1:32:36] a lot of people do they have emphasized
[1:32:38] on one thing only to deemphasize another
[1:32:41] thing that's right and anytime we're
[1:32:44] doing that we're in danger of not of
[1:32:47] losing our Full Gospel title amen cuz
[1:32:51] when you are Full Gospel you don't
[1:32:53] deemphasize or overemphasize anything
[1:32:56] it's all the word of
[1:32:58] God brother Adam says it's not the
[1:33:00] fruits of the spirit but that doesn't
[1:33:01] mean we don't need the fruits of the
[1:33:04] spirit and he says notice if the very
[1:33:07] God his life is in you the life of your
[1:33:10] father did the very life of God is in
[1:33:12] you the very spirit that was in Christ
[1:33:14] is in you how can the spirit live in
[1:33:16] Jesus Christ and write this and then
[1:33:20] come back down in you and deny
[1:33:25] this so he would answer that question
[1:33:28] over and over and over and over again
[1:33:31] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being
[1:33:34] able to punctuate every word with an
[1:33:39] amen and brother bam would say because
[1:33:41] watch then is it brother bham do you
[1:33:44] believe that the evidence of the Holy
[1:33:45] Ghost is this is the is the ability to
[1:33:47] speak in tongues brother brandom says as
[1:33:50] he's argued with the uh the the
[1:33:52] Pentecostal church over now brother bham
[1:33:54] stops in questions and answers in 1964
[1:33:56] and he's asked that exact question
[1:33:58] brother bham do you believe that a
[1:33:59] person and the way they ask this is they
[1:34:02] ask it something to the effect of
[1:34:04] brother bam can a person have the Holy
[1:34:06] Ghost and not have an experience when it
[1:34:08] happens now brother Brandon before he
[1:34:10] starts to answer that question he knows
[1:34:12] what the thought is behind the
[1:34:14] motivation of that question is cuz in
[1:34:18] another place he answers that question
[1:34:20] he answers it very differently and he
[1:34:21] says no that you've got to have the
[1:34:22] experience when it happens and it gives
[1:34:24] the experience of the candle how can you
[1:34:26] have a candle you got the wick you got
[1:34:27] the Tallow you got everything but until
[1:34:29] the fire lights it the candle's not lit
[1:34:31] and he says you've to have the Holy
[1:34:33] Ghost you've got to have the experience
[1:34:34] when it happens you know the quote right
[1:34:36] amen but this time he when he's asked
[1:34:38] the when he's asked the question he
[1:34:40] knows the person and the way they're
[1:34:42] asking so he starts off by saying now
[1:34:45] now I love the Pentecostal
[1:34:48] people and he says now I was I'm Iden
[1:34:51] and Brother Band even says I'm
[1:34:52] identified with that group of holy
[1:34:53] rollers and he says but watch the way he
[1:34:56] separates that that Pentecostal
[1:34:59] denomination and those people and that
[1:35:01] system with the Pentecostal experience
[1:35:05] don't ever throw out the Pentecostal
[1:35:07] experience with the Pentecostal
[1:35:09] denomination because when you throw out
[1:35:11] the Pentecostal experience you've thrown
[1:35:13] out the Bible
[1:35:15] amen remember brother Brandon would say
[1:35:17] over and over again Pentecost is not a
[1:35:19] denomination it's an experience
[1:35:24] and so so he says he says now I love
[1:35:27] those Pentecostal people and he says you
[1:35:29] know often times he says out of any
[1:35:31] denomination and he says I've harped
[1:35:33] against the Baptist and against the
[1:35:34] Methodist he said because you know it's
[1:35:36] really hard to those intellectual dryad
[1:35:37] intellectuals he and brother bandam says
[1:35:39] it's always if in other words if you
[1:35:41] really read the quote what he's really
[1:35:43] saying is the if I had to choose one
[1:35:46] it'd be Pentecostal denomination that's
[1:35:48] what he says he says if I had to choose
[1:35:50] one of them I certainly wouldn't choose
[1:35:52] no Baptist I wouldn't choose no
[1:35:53] Methodist I wouldn't choose Catholicism
[1:35:55] and he says if I now they're all wrong
[1:35:57] he didn't stand for any denomination but
[1:35:59] he said out of any of them that I would
[1:36:01] stand for the least how do you say that
[1:36:03] the the least
[1:36:05] bad the lesser of two
[1:36:08] evils he says is that Pentecostal
[1:36:11] denomination and then he starts to
[1:36:13] answer the question and he says now in
[1:36:15] the evidence of the B of of the speaking
[1:36:17] in tongues he says I've differed with
[1:36:19] them because they've tried to put the
[1:36:21] initial evidence of the of of the Holy
[1:36:25] Ghost in speaking in tongues now you say
[1:36:28] brother brandom brother Bram says now
[1:36:30] I've differed with him that's not the
[1:36:31] evidence that's not the evidence of the
[1:36:33] Holy Ghost prophet of God says this 1964
[1:36:35] he says oh no no I would I wish every
[1:36:39] member of my church spoke in
[1:36:42] tongues and I believe that if you would
[1:36:44] pray and ask God you'd speak in
[1:36:47] tongues now that's 1964 don't look at me
[1:36:50] like a deer in the head light I I'll get
[1:36:52] you the quote after the service if you
[1:36:54] want it brother Brandon begins to go a
[1:36:56] little bit further than that you watch
[1:36:58] him the way he answers this question
[1:37:00] over and over and over and over again uh
[1:37:04] he answers he answers it this way and he
[1:37:06] always goes back to how would he points
[1:37:09] to to to the Book of John chapter 14 and
[1:37:13] he shows how that when the spirit of
[1:37:14] truth comes he'll lead and guide you
[1:37:16] into all truth he'll show you things to
[1:37:18] come brother bandam says and he always
[1:37:19] points back and says how could the word
[1:37:21] of God be dwelling in you deny his own
[1:37:24] word so then the evidence of the Holy
[1:37:27] Ghost would be able to punctuate every
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:32] word every
[1:37:35] word every word do we realize what every
[1:37:40] word
[1:37:43] means well then every word means if they
[1:37:46] can punctuate every word then that that
[1:37:48] just that then then we've got to believe
[1:37:50] in healing we've got we got to believe
[1:37:51] in shouting we've got to believe in
[1:37:52] dancing we got to believe in speaking in
[1:37:54] tongues and I'm believing all the word
[1:37:56] I'm with you but can can you go a little
[1:37:58] bit further come on brother brandom says
[1:38:00] I could ask a question to this audience
[1:38:02] tonight and say how many of you here
[1:38:04] have the Holy Ghost and he says I
[1:38:06] guarantee you 90 I think he says 99% of
[1:38:08] everybody would raise a hand and say
[1:38:10] well I've got it brother bandam and he
[1:38:11] says but I could quote you one scripture
[1:38:13] if you say you believe every word I
[1:38:15] could quote to you one scripture and he
[1:38:17] says I guarantee you not even three
[1:38:19] hands would go up in the building
[1:38:22] you know what scripture he quotes
[1:38:24] blessed are the he marks those who sigh
[1:38:27] and cry for the Abominations done in
[1:38:31] their City brother R says how many of
[1:38:33] you now that's every word that's the
[1:38:34] words of Jesus come on I thought we
[1:38:36] believed every word he who has the Holy
[1:38:40] Ghost shouts he he might shout dance he
[1:38:44] might dance speak in tongues he might
[1:38:45] speak in
[1:38:46] tongues but he might
[1:38:49] not but here's what brother said he will
[1:38:51] have he will have the fruits of the
[1:38:53] spirit in his life now the fruits of the
[1:38:56] spirit are not an Evidence of the Holy
[1:38:58] Ghost but you better have them in fact
[1:39:00] I'll say it this way it's an Evidence
[1:39:02] you don't have
[1:39:05] it brother Brandon would even say that
[1:39:07] about accepting the word for your hour
[1:39:09] and he says what what does it prove when
[1:39:11] you can't accept the word for your day
[1:39:14] and its message it proves you don't have
[1:39:16] the Holy Ghost right Amen brother bam
[1:39:19] quotes that scripture blessed are they
[1:39:20] the and cry brother sister now what is
[1:39:23] that that scripture could you punctuate
[1:39:25] that scripture with an amen where every
[1:39:29] night of your life you lay in your bed
[1:39:31] and you cry and can't sleep because
[1:39:34] you're crying sighing and crying over
[1:39:37] the lost and the dying in the world
[1:39:41] Amen now if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:44] brother Bram says that's an Evidence
[1:39:47] when you sigh and cry over the
[1:39:49] Abominations done and he brings it
[1:39:51] further and he brings it down to your
[1:39:53] life and he says when you mess up or
[1:39:56] misstep on the word of God do you sigh
[1:39:59] and cry over the Abominations done in
[1:40:02] your
[1:40:04] city so he would answer this over and
[1:40:07] over and over brother brandom I've been
[1:40:10] baptized in Jesus name the word says you
[1:40:12] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:14] does this mean that does this mean the
[1:40:16] baptism the Holy Spirit or does it mean
[1:40:19] that I receive the gift I should receive
[1:40:21] a definite experience with baptism I'm
[1:40:23] anxious to be filled with the spirit now
[1:40:26] there's a good question now the baptism
[1:40:28] with the Holy Spirit is a definite
[1:40:32] experience that a person must receive
[1:40:36] now when I speak of not believing the
[1:40:38] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:40] speaking in tongues I do not accept that
[1:40:43] I believe with God's help I could prove
[1:40:44] it in the Bible if that's wrong because
[1:40:46] the speaking of in tongues is a gift of
[1:40:49] the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians for right
[1:40:53] how many knows that Divine Healing is a
[1:40:55] gift of the Holy Ghost now that's no
[1:40:58] evidence of the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:41:01] rely upon that you can't rely upon the
[1:41:03] fruit of the spirit because the fruit of
[1:41:06] the spirit is love and the Christian
[1:41:07] Science exercise more love than anybody
[1:41:09] I know of and they deny Jesus Christ
[1:41:11] being Divine amen see there's only one
[1:41:15] evidence of the holy spirit that I know
[1:41:17] of and that is a genuine faith in the
[1:41:21] promised word of the
[1:41:24] hour so see those priests were
[1:41:28] gentle they were
[1:41:31] Meek understanding
[1:41:33] men when it come to the fruits of the
[1:41:35] spirit they could show more fruit of the
[1:41:37] spirit than Jesus ever could but they
[1:41:40] failed to see that he was the promised
[1:41:42] word of the
[1:41:44] hour
[1:41:47] amen I could I could read you my
[1:41:50] goodness I could read you 40 of these
[1:41:52] but let's let's just read this last one
[1:41:54] and we'll close and is your life worthy
[1:41:56] because people say well brother brandham
[1:41:58] didn't really believe in the fruits of
[1:41:59] the spirit after the seals after
[1:42:03] 1963 let's read is your life worthy of
[1:42:05] the Gospel I guess this was uh uh I
[1:42:08] guess this sermon doesn't mean anything
[1:42:10] I had a brother tell me that let's
[1:42:12] listen to what brother bandham says
[1:42:14] brother BR in my church now you're not
[1:42:15] born again you can't be we've already
[1:42:17] read this come back down and and deny
[1:42:19] that you can't do it a punk sh
[1:42:21] then if you say well I'm a good member
[1:42:23] of the church that don't have one thing
[1:42:25] to do with it I know the Heathen Down in
[1:42:28] Africa amongst my dark Brethren down
[1:42:29] there I find the morals of them people
[1:42:31] higher than 90% of the American people
[1:42:35] it goes on further you could read that
[1:42:36] quote but he says when this takes place
[1:42:39] the thing you'll do then you'll find out
[1:42:42] that the spirit that comes in you from
[1:42:44] the New Birth you will believe and do
[1:42:47] everything God says in his word is for
[1:42:49] you to do and everything that's in the
[1:42:52] Bible quotes for you to do you'll
[1:42:55] punctuate it with an amen and you'll not
[1:42:58] stop day and night until you receive it
[1:43:01] Hallelujah that's right and in all this
[1:43:06] time you'll certainly above everything
[1:43:10] bear the fruit of the spirit yes
[1:43:16] amen you say brother Bram
[1:43:19] says you say will I speak with
[1:43:23] tongues you might do that and you might
[1:43:28] not will I
[1:43:31] shout you might do that you might not
[1:43:38] amen but there's one things sure you
[1:43:41] will do you will bear the fruit of the
[1:43:46] spirit
[1:43:47] amen amen and the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:43:50] say him with me it's love joy come on
[1:43:54] say it together peace Faith
[1:43:58] longsuffering meekness
[1:44:01] gentleness
[1:44:04] patience your temper will not be
[1:44:09] ooh just remember when you got that that
[1:44:13] poisons the holy spirit away from you
[1:44:18] amen amen now this is just what the Lord
[1:44:22] placed upon my heart I'm not preaching
[1:44:24] at you now I'm preaching at brother
[1:44:27] Matt brother bam says when you get that
[1:44:29] Spirit on
[1:44:31] you that
[1:44:33] poisons the holy you mean I can poison
[1:44:37] the holy ghost out of my life Ephesians
[1:44:40] 4 remember what we read grieve not the
[1:44:43] Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed unto
[1:44:46] the day of your Redemption but you can
[1:44:49] grieve him out of your life
[1:44:51] amen amen and he says that poisons the
[1:44:54] holy spirit away from you when you get
[1:44:57] to a place that you want to fuss with
[1:44:58] everybody you come along there's
[1:45:00] something
[1:45:03] wrong but but but but but but but but
[1:45:05] brother random I I spoke in tongues I
[1:45:08] shouted I I danced I felt the an unction
[1:45:11] of the Holy Ghost I believe the message
[1:45:13] with all of my
[1:45:15] heart brother bham says there's
[1:45:18] something wrong let it be a diagnosis to
[1:45:22] her
[1:45:22] heart there's something wrong when you
[1:45:26] get to a place where a minister will
[1:45:27] read from the Bible that it's wrong to
[1:45:29] do a certain thing and you just remember
[1:45:32] brother Ram says and he and he says this
[1:45:34] is and you'll you'll you know sit there
[1:45:36] with your arms crossed and he says just
[1:45:38] remember there's no Christianity there
[1:45:41] at all
[1:45:43] amen by their fruits you shall know them
[1:45:46] that's what Jesus said and you find
[1:45:49] yourself I skipped some of this just to
[1:45:52] save time he's talking about the real
[1:45:54] evidence of the Holy Ghost and you find
[1:45:56] yourself in love with your
[1:46:00] enemies somebody says well he's nothing
[1:46:03] but a Holy
[1:46:05] Roller and you start to get ah be
[1:46:09] careful don't don't don't just look at
[1:46:11] Holy Roller look at anything anybody
[1:46:13] would say to you and call you on a phone
[1:46:16] text you send you a
[1:46:18] screenshot and they're per purpose is to
[1:46:21] disparage another person wow amen now if
[1:46:25] I've ever been guilty and I have I want
[1:46:27] to say here tonight before this church
[1:46:29] Lord Jesus forgive
[1:46:32] me if I've ever been guilty of
[1:46:35] disparaging somebody or talking bad
[1:46:37] about somebody in a way then God here
[1:46:40] tonight forgive me Lord I don't want
[1:46:42] that in my
[1:46:46] life brother random says and you start
[1:46:49] be careful uhhuh come be careful but
[1:46:52] when you really find yourself that you
[1:46:56] love him regardless of what they do you
[1:47:00] still love them amen then you're
[1:47:04] beginning to
[1:47:06] find your patience just gets from about
[1:47:09] that long till it just don't have no
[1:47:15] end did y'all read that did that just go
[1:47:18] over your head when you can start Lov
[1:47:21] how many here wants more patience how
[1:47:23] many here are impatient keep those hands
[1:47:25] up don't be dishonest now there's not a
[1:47:28] one of us all of us battle with this oh
[1:47:30] but it's not in the listen if you
[1:47:32] believe in the genuine
[1:47:35] atonement it's in your carnal nature to
[1:47:37] be impatient it's in the fruit of the
[1:47:40] spirit to have
[1:47:41] patience brother BR says when you get to
[1:47:43] loving your enemies he says you begin to
[1:47:46] find your patience gets from about I'm
[1:47:48] just going to say that long I don't know
[1:47:49] how long he helds up till it just don't
[1:47:52] have no
[1:47:54] end anybody just keeps saying things
[1:47:56] about you well I don't care what you say
[1:47:59] don't get stirred
[1:48:01] up if you get stirred up you better go
[1:48:05] pray first before you talk to them again
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:10] y friends I'm telling you this works
[1:48:13] because this is in the
[1:48:16] atonement I'm afraid what's happened is
[1:48:18] is we've so emphasized the things with
[1:48:20] the atonement the great deep etheral
[1:48:23] things the Mysteries and I'm all for
[1:48:25] them all my my but you're you're talking
[1:48:27] to the wrong person if you think brother
[1:48:28] Matt doesn't enjoy some of the greater
[1:48:31] deeper things of God some of the great
[1:48:33] teaching some of the some of the
[1:48:35] manifestations of the Holy Ghost to
[1:48:37] speak in tongues you've heard me testify
[1:48:39] to you multiple times of times I've
[1:48:41] spoken tongues and I said to you after I
[1:48:43] spoke in tongues I thought how could
[1:48:44] anybody ever criticize it I got only one
[1:48:46] conclusion they've never spoken tongues
[1:48:49] amen amen
[1:48:52] but let me just say to you here tonight
[1:48:54] there's more to this
[1:48:56] atonement than just great doctrines or
[1:48:59] great Revelations or great Mysteries
[1:49:01] there's a life that can be changed
[1:49:04] there's a nature that can be changed and
[1:49:06] I'm here tonight to say God let the
[1:49:08] atonement come on my life to change my
[1:49:11] temper to change my attitude to make me
[1:49:13] Meek to make me sweet to make me holy to
[1:49:17] make me kind and affectionate one to
[1:49:22] another and when I find myself and that
[1:49:25] temper starts to flare up Lord stop me
[1:49:28] you know I've done that and I'm not here
[1:49:30] I'm by no means I'm I'm saying I'm just
[1:49:32] testifying to you about a change God's
[1:49:34] brought in my heart in my
[1:49:36] life when I could stop and find myself
[1:49:39] and and and before I would I'd fly off
[1:49:41] and my temper to get a hold of me and
[1:49:43] then in my mind even after that I'd have
[1:49:45] a moment where I had to come down from
[1:49:47] that oh come on don't look at me with
[1:49:49] angel's wings
[1:49:50] [Laughter]
[1:49:53] some of y'all came late for church cuz
[1:49:55] your temper was so flat up you knew you
[1:49:56] couldn't come into church fing that way
[1:49:59] and you had to calm down from that and
[1:50:00] come off of that come on we're only
[1:50:03] human but I'm not making an excuse for
[1:50:06] it and I've watched something in my life
[1:50:08] when that happens and then something in
[1:50:11] my temper and then God just convicts me
[1:50:13] because I've asked the Lord to do that
[1:50:16] and then suddenly I grab a hold of that
[1:50:19] and say God forgive me I didn't mean to
[1:50:21] act that
[1:50:24] way cuz I say like brother brandham Lord
[1:50:28] I don't want that in my life
[1:50:31] amen if I if all my revelation of of of
[1:50:35] this let me just say this to you tonight
[1:50:37] if my Revelation for this message as
[1:50:39] much as I could say I'm praying for
[1:50:41] Revelation let me go let me change my
[1:50:43] wording if my understanding of this
[1:50:45] message and this Bible never grows
[1:50:47] another inch never grows another C ceter
[1:50:50] but it means that my character becomes
[1:50:53] more like the nature of Jesus Christ
[1:50:55] then I'll stop with my knowledge and
[1:50:57] take his character in my life
[1:51:01] amen amen Amen brother bam says he says
[1:51:04] you find your patience anybody just
[1:51:07] keeps saying these things well I don't
[1:51:08] care don't get stirred up if you get
[1:51:10] stirred up you better go pray first

[1:53:25] directs men you know why God puts a
[1:53:28] burden like this on my heart brings me
[1:53:30] through something in my life because God
[1:53:32] is concerned about our lives and he
[1:53:34] won't let us get away with
[1:53:35] it so the Holy Spirit begins to minister
[1:53:38] and begins to tell you you got to do
[1:53:40] something about that temper you got to
[1:53:43] do something about that malice that you
[1:53:44] got locked up inside your heart you got
[1:53:47] to do something about that enemy that
[1:53:50] that that that you got to Jesus said you
[1:53:51] got to love listen friends these weren't
[1:53:54] suggestions these weren't pre- seals
[1:53:57] these weren't things that just don't
[1:53:59] matter and they're
[1:54:00] trivial I would present to you today
[1:54:03] they're just as important as anything
[1:54:05] you want to put behind him they're just
[1:54:07] as vital as anything brother Ram says
[1:54:11] don't fuss when the family gets in a
[1:54:14] fuss don't fuss with
[1:54:18] them don't fuss f with
[1:54:21] them don't fuss you see friends temper
[1:54:26] breeds temper yeah the first thing you
[1:54:30] know you grieve the holy spirit away
[1:54:32] from you and you be fussing
[1:54:35] back then the Holy Spirit takes its
[1:54:39] flight brother Brandon repeats it temper
[1:54:43] breathes
[1:54:46] temper and you know what that when you

[1:54:56] deal with you here deal as he dealt with
[1:54:57] me when the Holy Ghost takes his flight
[1:55:01] prayers go

[1:55:05] over and you desperately need God to
[1:55:07] move on your life of your
[1:55:09] children desperately need God to move in
[1:55:12] your body and your health when you
[1:55:14] grieve the holy spirit away because you
[1:55:16] haven't surrendered this part of your
[1:55:18] nature

[1:55:23] unanswered needs go
[1:55:25] unmet because temper breeds temper but

[1:55:49] love one for another I'm not saying you
[1:55:52] got to agree with everybody I'm not
