[45:21] wasn't really a camp because we
[45:24] uh people were staying in motels there
[45:26] wasn't a lodging and uh
[45:28] there wasn't a tuition to cover or can't
[45:32] fee to cover any of the costs this time
[45:33] we're charging it consequently
[45:36] uh we spent about ten thousand dollars
[45:39] uh on your senior youth amen
[45:42] now thanks be to the lord i had plenty
[45:44] of reserves
[45:46] saved up for that because i knew that
[45:47] would be costly i've seen how those
[45:49] things go
[45:50] and we were happy to do it we fed
[45:52] everybody and we
[45:53] had tent rentals and chair rentals and
[45:56] we wanted to make sure we
[45:57] gave the minister a good love offering
[45:59] and uh just a lot of lot of expenses
[46:03] involved in that we asked the parents uh
[46:06] of the senior youth to please donate to
[46:09] that and most of them did
[46:11] not all so i would imagine they're
[46:12] stunned some still that may be planning
[46:14] to do that i hope
[46:15] and then i would also like to recommend
[46:18] to the senior youth
[46:20] who hold down jobs you know you need to
[46:22] be uh
[46:23] donating to that because it was for you
[46:26] and so
[46:26] we want to we want to let the parents
[46:28] know that it was an investment let the
[46:30] whole church know
[46:31] uh we did we haven't given you an
[46:34] opportunity
[46:35] uh as a church to to give back for
[46:38] to recoup some of that we took up an
[46:41] offering on the sunday morning
[46:43] and with what has come in from the
[46:44] parents and what came in on that sunday
[46:47] morning i've recovered about eighteen
[46:48] hundred dollars of that ten grand
[46:50] so uh if the lord would lay it on your
[46:52] heart to give
[46:54] uh just earmark market uh for the past
[46:57] youth
[46:57] gathering that we have we'd like to see
[47:00] uh some of that come back in to resupply
[47:02] our ministry fund ministry fund pays for
[47:05] a lot of stuff any any and everything
[47:07] related to ministry
[47:08] uh even the purchase of this organ
[47:10] because it deals with the ministry
[47:12] so we didn't even ask the trustees to
[47:14] cover that that's part of the ministry
[47:16] every musical instrument in here all the
[47:18] equipment in that sound booth and every
[47:20] upgraded all the software
[47:21] everything comes out of the ministry out
[47:24] of your ties that you pay
[47:26] support of the ministry love offerings
[47:28] for ministry all of that comes out
[47:30] of that fund so we were happy to do it
[47:33] and i just want to ask you to be praying
[47:35] and if the lord would have you to do
[47:37] something now
[47:38] again uh this next one we are going to
[47:40] be charging a
[47:41] fee to cover won't cover everything
[47:43] we'll still have
[47:44] uh no doubt quite a bit but hopefully it
[47:46] won't be to that level
[47:48] but it's going to be amazing and so we
[47:50] wanted to make sure that your children
[47:53] um you know say brother jason that seems
[47:56] like a
[47:57] an absurd amount hey it's just the cost
[48:00] of when you try to run a meeting like
[48:01] that you want to house everybody
[48:03] but listen our senior youth are worth it
[48:07] they are the future bethel tabernacle if
[48:10] the lord should carry on in generations
[48:12] to come
[48:12] so i think it was a grand investment i'd
[48:14] do it all over 100 times
[48:16] amen so we just want to make you aware
[48:18] of a little bit of church business there
[48:20] and give you the opportunity because
[48:21] like i say we haven't officially asked
[48:23] the church as a whole
[48:25] certainly parents should be donating to
[48:28] that and you senior youth should be
[48:30] but we want to also ask the church in
[48:31] general those who are streaming
[48:33] amen just want to make you aware of that
[48:36] so praise the lord we're happy for the
[48:37] lord's blessing
[48:39] amen we don't make big pulls for money
[48:41] we don't believe in that
[48:42] brother didn't believe in that we don't
[48:44] do it we've never been guilty of it
[48:46] the lord takes care and he always has
[48:49] so god bless you uh as the lord would
[48:52] speak to your heart on that but
[48:53] we just want to make you aware that if
[48:55] if there's a financial burden and your
[48:58] senior youth can't quite come up with
[49:00] that because it's 189
[49:02] ahead and that covers all the activities
[49:05] and meals in the camp and everything
[49:06] and if you can't we do have sponsors
[49:09] here in this assembly have
[49:11] already come forward said we will
[49:13] sponsor anyone who can't afford it
[49:15] so god bless you i just want to make
[49:17] that announcement we're going to look
[49:18] right into first corinthians
[49:21] excuse me chapter 3.
[49:34] i beg your pardon the devil just still
[49:36] battling me
[49:38] i mean some people are fantastic liars
[49:40] and he's like the king of all liars
[49:43] so he keeps trying to lie to me and say
[49:46] i've got a head cold and i just keep
[49:47] giving it back to him tell him he don't
[49:48] know what he's talking about
[49:50] amen he said well you've got the
[49:51] symptoms i say well the symptoms have
[49:53] anything to do with it
[49:54] i'm looking at a promise by stripes i'm
[49:56] already healed
[49:58] so i i just the more and more i go
[50:00] friends
[50:02] the more and more i just remind the
[50:04] devil satan you ain't nobody
[50:07] you don't make one decision about my
[50:09] life you got no say
[50:11] in my life amen i'm here i work i'm in
[50:14] service to his majesty the king
[50:16] and that's all that matters and so the
[50:19] king's business requires haste and we
[50:21] want to be up and about the father's
[50:22] business
[50:23] amen first corinthians chapter three
[50:26] we're going to take
[50:27] from our text last week on
[50:30] master builder we want to take part two
[50:32] of that today
[50:34] first corinthians chapter 3 verses 9 to
[50:38] 16.
[50:40] we are laborers together with you with
[50:43] god
[50:44] start again verse 9 for we are laborers
[50:46] together with god
[50:48] ye are god's husbandry ye are god's
[50:51] building
[50:53] according to the grace of god which is
[50:55] given unto me
[50:56] as a wise master builder i have laid the
[51:00] foundation
[51:00] and another buildeth theron but let
[51:02] every man take heed
[51:04] how he buildeth their upon for other
[51:07] foundation can no man
[51:09] lay than that then that is laid
[51:12] which is jesus christ now if any man
[51:15] build upon this foundation gold silver
[51:18] precious stones wood hey stubble
[51:20] every man's work shall be made manifest
[51:22] for the day
[51:23] shall declare it because it shall be
[51:25] revealed by fire
[51:27] and the fire shall try every man's work
[51:30] of what sort it is so the bible just
[51:33] simply saying
[51:34] some people build on gold silver and
[51:36] precious stones
[51:38] and that will survive the fire
[51:40] everything you invest
[51:42] in god's kingdom will survive the
[51:44] judgments of the world
[51:46] but some people build on wood hay and
[51:49] stubble
[51:50] and they the the the principles
[51:53] of god's kingdom to govern their lives
[51:57] and their families and their activities
[52:01] god's principles are secondary to them
[52:04] and paul is warning you build like that
[52:07] he's not saying you're not a son of god
[52:09] daughter of god he's saying build like
[52:10] that and you'll lose it all
[52:12] because the the fires of this day the
[52:15] judgments are just too hot and too heavy
[52:17] they're coming from too many different
[52:18] directions and your
[52:21] your life your family your everything
[52:24] you've invested in and
[52:25] you built with some of the finest wood
[52:27] and the finest choice hey and the finest
[52:29] stubble you could find
[52:30] but it won't survive and that's the
[52:32] warning of the scripture
[52:34] all right so verse 16 know you not
[52:38] that ye are the temple of god and that
[52:40] the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any
[52:42] man defile the temple of god him shall
[52:44] god destroy for the temple
[52:46] of god is holy which temple you are let
[52:49] no man deceive himself
[52:50] if any man among you seemeth to be wise
[52:53] in this world
[52:54] let him become a fool that he may
[52:57] be wise amen let's let's pray father
[53:01] we again thank you for your word master
[53:05] and we pray that it will be a living
[53:07] bread of life to us
[53:08] we commit it to you in jesus name amen
[53:11] god bless you
[53:12] as you're seated amen praise the lord
[53:15] thank you for covering piano day sister
[53:17] ruth will get you on your brand new unit
[53:19] over there
[53:20] next week sister deborah and sister
[53:23] elaine are out visiting
[53:25] um brother dale and the family there in
[53:27] arizona
[53:29] praise the lord amen
[53:33] so we were discussing last time in
[53:36] preaching about this
[53:37] idea where paul calls himself
[53:40] a master builder and we made
[53:44] quite to do over you know being a master
[53:47] builder
[53:47] and knowing your way around a set of
[53:51] blueprints and
[53:52] specifications and understanding all the
[53:54] symbols and
[53:56] and we found that that we were we're all
[53:59] not just preachers but we're all master
[54:02] builders
[54:03] and this is why paul would say to us as
[54:07] individuals you know you are the temple
[54:10] of god and therefore god thinks sir
[54:14] god is trying to get control
[54:18] of his temple which you are and you're
[54:20] not your own you were bought with a
[54:22] price
[54:23] and i i i've told you the story before i
[54:25] was in
[54:26] in the ukraine and family camp meeting
[54:28] there in the ukraine and marbella
[54:29] belarus i don't remember which i think
[54:31] the ukraine and we were
[54:33] there was uh where we had to go to get
[54:36] uh phone service or internet service
[54:38] because the camp didn't have either
[54:40] and there was an office building office
[54:42] complex and there's a young woman there
[54:43] in her early 20s and she's she's quite
[54:47] friendly at first and she knows that
[54:48] we're ministers
[54:50] and uh you know we're just trying to be
[54:52] cordial to her and
[54:54] show her a a right christian attitude
[54:56] and spirit
[54:57] weren't there to judge her by any means
[54:59] we're there to help her if we could
[55:01] and i i remember one day after going in
[55:03] two or three days together as a group of
[55:05] ministers
[55:06] and she began to kind of you know make a
[55:09] little bit of a brag and she was a
[55:10] little giddy over it you know she was
[55:12] making her brag about how she had been
[55:14] out that night and and had her partying
[55:16] going on and
[55:17] she was just so much fun she just had so
[55:19] much fun and
[55:21] and uh you know and and she she talked
[55:24] about how that was really living it up
[55:26] and and of course that's just a little
[55:28] more than a good preacher could take and
[55:30] i
[55:31] i wasn't gonna try to you know condemn
[55:34] the
[55:34] young woman but i just wanted to let her
[55:36] know because
[55:37] obviously no one else had told her the
[55:39] truth that that's not
[55:41] life that's actually death and that if
[55:43] you keep giving yourself to that you'll
[55:45] be destroyed that
[55:46] you're made in the image of god you were
[55:48] made to be the temple of the holy spirit
[55:50] and it was the enemy that had turned the
[55:53] world into that and
[55:55] you know and right away her defense was
[55:57] i hear it all time you hear
[55:58] people say it this is laodicea laodicea
[56:00] it means people's rights
[56:01] everybody's got their rights uh and she
[56:03] said you know she just put up her hand
[56:05] just to stop me
[56:06] she in her broken english my body
[56:09] it's my body and and of course that's
[56:12] more than a preacher can handle too
[56:14] and i said well who who
[56:17] who told you that i thought wow you've
[56:20] been lied to now you're really being
[56:22] lied to
[56:23] and i said who told you it was your body
[56:26] and she just looked at me i think i
[56:27] could tell she'd never been asked that
[56:28] question before i said did you
[56:31] build your body did you put it here or
[56:33] did it come from somewhere
[56:34] did somebody give you life or can you
[56:36] keep your life right now
[56:38] if the one who gave it decided to take
[56:39] it do you think you could hang on to it
[56:41] do you think you could keep the breath
[56:42] in your lungs who told you it was your
[56:44] body
[56:45] don't you know that jesus christ
[56:47] purchased your body to lit to have as
[56:49] his temple at calvary
[56:50] and you're not your own you're bought
[56:52] with a price
[56:53] do you know that just the grace of god
[56:55] has given you life and it's the grace of
[56:57] god trying to save you
[56:58] who has lied to you so viciously to make
[57:01] you think that
[57:02] your decisions don't have consequences
[57:04] see
[57:05] if you live in this body the bible says
[57:07] let everything that hath breath praise
[57:09] the lord
[57:10] amen in other words your life should
[57:12] praise the lord or you should stop
[57:14] breathing
[57:16] amen if you won't let your life praise
[57:19] the lord stop breathing you're you're a
[57:20] thief
[57:21] you're you're a trespasser you're using
[57:24] breath that god gave you
[57:26] and you're using life god put in your
[57:28] body and you're not
[57:29] bringing it you're not letting it
[57:30] glorify him this was the whole
[57:33] one of the themes that we talked about
[57:35] last time
[57:36] how that you know master builder
[57:38] somebody who had come along as a master
[57:40] builder
[57:41] and said oh i can build zion you know
[57:42] they they they read a little bit of the
[57:44] blueprint in the book of revelation
[57:47] and they knew it was 1500 miles square
[57:49] they got that much
[57:50] and you know and every gate was a pearl
[57:53] they could see some of the details
[57:54] but when they when they hired on to
[57:57] build it
[57:58] told the lord i'm a master builder and
[58:01] then when they got done they'd build a
[58:02] cube
[58:04] and the lord looks at it and says i
[58:06] can't use a cube
[58:08] oh i can't use a cube because the walls
[58:11] would go all the way to the top and hide
[58:12] my glory
[58:13] you understand that city is a is a
[58:16] symbolism of you
[58:17] there is going to be a real city and it
[58:19] is going to be 1500 miles square
[58:21] but john says i was told i'll show you
[58:23] the bride the lamb's wife and he was
[58:24] shown a city coming down
[58:26] so the correlation is whether it's the
[58:28] city or whether it's you whether it's
[58:30] that temple or whether you're the temple
[58:32] you're built to give god glory
[58:36] and so it was spo he's you know and we
[58:38] we we
[58:39] we argued on behalf of the of this
[58:42] builder who claimed to be a master
[58:43] builder
[58:44] and pulpits today are filled with men
[58:47] who claim to be master builders
[58:48] but they don't build according to paul's
[58:50] instructions
[58:52] and the master of all master builders
[58:54] told them you can't deviate
[58:56] whatever i've built you've got to build
[58:57] it according to the revelation of christ
[59:00] and so they built 10 people into people
[59:04] thinking they're christians when they're
[59:05] not at all a christian
[59:07] and they're they're not at all a temple
[59:09] of the holy ghost they don't house god's
[59:10] presence they
[59:11] they don't change anything in their
[59:13] lives they just go to church and have
[59:14] their name on a book
[59:17] and they're warned in the in the in the
[59:19] specifications book
[59:21] they're warned that that that brings
[59:22] death that that's going to end in
[59:24] destruction that's not going to end well
[59:26] see so and and that's why you can't join
[59:29] a church you have to be born into the
[59:31] church of christ
[59:32] you have to have the holy ghost and when
[59:34] the holy ghost comes into you then you
[59:35] house his ten
[59:36] your temple housing his presence and
[59:38] then he gets to live his life
[59:40] through you amen that's abc's
[59:44] of christianity that's what a christian
[59:46] has always been
[59:48] for 2 000 years it was only man-made
[59:51] ideology that ever changed it and today
[59:53] you've got 45 000 different protestant
[59:55] denominations all claiming to be master
[59:57] builders and building the temple of god
[59:59] but there's only one one blueprint
[1:00:01] specification we can go by
[1:00:03] there's not another there's not another
[1:00:05] gospel you can't change it
[1:00:06] and hope to get god to give you the
[1:00:08] promises he put in his book
[1:00:10] see and so so so we we find that
[1:00:14] that it had to be built and we showed
[1:00:17] you that a symbol on the blueprint was
[1:00:18] found in isaiah
[1:00:20] and it was supposed to be built like a
[1:00:22] mountain and now
[1:00:23] any master builder should know that the
[1:00:26] only way to build
[1:00:28] a a a a wall a city
[1:00:31] and walls with a square foundation
[1:00:35] with four square foundations fifteen
[1:00:37] hundred fifteen hundred fifteen hundred
[1:00:39] fifteen hundred
[1:00:40] and yet and yet and and yet allow
[1:00:43] it to look like a mountain is you got to
[1:00:46] build it not like a cube
[1:00:48] but like a pyramid and so the walls
[1:00:50] angle over so then
[1:00:52] several hundred couple hundred miles of
[1:00:53] the of the city goes above the walls and
[1:00:56] you can see it because his light
[1:00:57] lightens the whole world the bible
[1:00:59] teaches
[1:01:00] us see so there's something to be said
[1:01:03] about
[1:01:04] why god needed to send a message in this
[1:01:07] day what was it to do bring a new gospel
[1:01:09] certainly not you you you'd be destroyed
[1:01:12] believing a different gospel
[1:01:14] it was merely to restore the original
[1:01:16] gospel
[1:01:17] to to to take the 45 000
[1:01:20] who say they've got it and say i'm sorry
[1:01:23] you don't
[1:01:24] here's the original and if you're going
[1:01:26] to be his
[1:01:27] temple and if you want to live in his
[1:01:29] city you're going to have to be built
[1:01:31] according to his
[1:01:32] designs drawings and specifications
[1:01:36] amen and so now this principle even
[1:01:39] comes down into his
[1:01:40] family because you know the we we talked
[1:01:44] about the the
[1:01:45] the person you know in in ii samuel who
[1:01:48] ran without a message and
[1:01:49] there's a brother branham said that's
[1:01:50] the real problem they ran they were good
[1:01:52] men
[1:01:53] but they ran without a message i'm glad
[1:01:55] today
[1:01:56] that we had a runner to go and he he
[1:01:58] understands
[1:01:59] everything that went on he understands
[1:02:01] the mystery the the first runner
[1:02:03] he knew that there was a victory he
[1:02:04] didn't know what happened you know how
[1:02:05] it happened and
[1:02:06] he couldn't bring peace to david he
[1:02:08] couldn't give the answer to the people
[1:02:09] there was no shalom in his message
[1:02:12] because he didn't have all the mystery
[1:02:15] and it took the next man to come along
[1:02:17] the one who actually was
[1:02:18] sent with the full message and said you
[1:02:21] know
[1:02:21] and then he could answer all david's
[1:02:23] questions and then he could put every
[1:02:24] all fears to rest then he could put all
[1:02:26] doubts
[1:02:28] because the the holy spirit is a
[1:02:30] dissolver of all doubts
[1:02:32] amen so when the holy spirit is
[1:02:35] revealing his word to you
[1:02:37] you don't doubt it if you doubt it then
[1:02:41] it's not him revealing it to you
[1:02:43] amen that's abc's that's just simple
[1:02:46] deductive understanding and so
[1:02:49] so we found that a major part of the
[1:02:52] message to the world
[1:02:54] at the end time was a message concerning
[1:02:57] the book of redemption that was sealed
[1:02:59] up in the book of revelation and it had
[1:03:01] to be opened at the end time
[1:03:02] because that unveiled the mighty god
[1:03:06] the mighty god was hidden to the world
[1:03:08] he said he would be and he was and
[1:03:09] that's why you get 45 000 different
[1:03:11] denominations
[1:03:13] and and and that's and that's that's and
[1:03:15] and so it would be
[1:03:16] the book would be open the seals would
[1:03:18] be broke and the mighty god would be
[1:03:20] unveiled and when he got unveiled then
[1:03:22] that unveiled his bride his family
[1:03:24] and it unveiled the true church of
[1:03:26] christ
[1:03:27] amen so so this was a major
[1:03:31] uh point that that that is incumbent
[1:03:35] upon
[1:03:36] us to expose to the world
[1:03:39] because you know the world unknowingly
[1:03:43] is
[1:03:44] chasing the wrong thing and god
[1:03:47] has given the message to you to fix it
[1:03:51] to straighten out their understanding
[1:03:53] you're not doing a very good
[1:03:55] job of straightening out their
[1:03:56] understanding if you're living and
[1:03:58] acting just like they are
[1:04:03] it really wouldn't matter what you say
[1:04:05] your life speaks so much louder
[1:04:07] i mean how how how are you going to
[1:04:11] give them a book to read or a tape to
[1:04:14] hear
[1:04:14] and what they hear doesn't match what
[1:04:16] they see in you
[1:04:18] and you claim to be a follower of that
[1:04:21] i mean you're you're going to hinder
[1:04:22] their faith right off the right trying
[1:04:24] to help them you're going to harm them
[1:04:26] listen friends the only the only mission
[1:04:28] you're here to accomplish
[1:04:30] of course we were saying we were saying
[1:04:32] last time that of course
[1:04:34] heaven will be filled millions of people
[1:04:36] who
[1:04:37] never believed the message of the unwise
[1:04:39] virgin don't believe the message but
[1:04:41] they're still righteous virgins
[1:04:43] i get it but that's up to god that god
[1:04:46] will make that decision at the great
[1:04:47] white throne i'm not here to
[1:04:48] to save them god god will give them
[1:04:51] eternal life
[1:04:52] see he'll judge their heart and if they
[1:04:54] were righteous and not
[1:04:55] iniquity then then they'll be granted
[1:04:58] eternal life that's but that's not my
[1:05:00] mission
[1:05:00] my mission is to preach the full gospel
[1:05:04] to not fail to declare not only in word
[1:05:07] but indeed
[1:05:09] i'm to declare in word and indeed
[1:05:12] what god has done in this day so i'm not
[1:05:14] here to
[1:05:15] preach or live a watered-down message
[1:05:21] there is no such thing as message light
[1:05:23] there's michelob light there's bud light
[1:05:27] there's no message light and man i'm
[1:05:30] sorry for that crude
[1:05:31] analogy i just want to get you
[1:05:33] understanding my my terminology
[1:05:35] there is no such thing as that people
[1:05:38] have created it and that's just nothing
[1:05:40] more than creating another denomination
[1:05:42] there's only the full word in this day
[1:05:44] there's no partial
[1:05:46] and i'm not here to try to explain it
[1:05:48] partially or
[1:05:49] partially livid i'm here to be the full
[1:05:52] temple
[1:05:52] the full manifestation the full word
[1:05:56] that's what that's why we preach in this
[1:05:58] pulpit that's why we're
[1:05:59] holding outreach that's why we've got
[1:06:01] other plans for outreach our outreach
[1:06:03] isn't to
[1:06:04] show a compromised version it's to show
[1:06:06] the real version
[1:06:08] because that's what real mercy is
[1:06:11] not not the real virgin to condemn but
[1:06:14] the real version to help
[1:06:17] not the real version to judge them but
[1:06:19] the real version to open their
[1:06:20] understanding
[1:06:22] to say hey you've been told 45 000
[1:06:24] different lies
[1:06:25] i'm here to give you the whole counsel
[1:06:28] of god
[1:06:30] if you're not doing that then you're
[1:06:34] you're harming trying to do outreach
[1:06:38] that's why i'm so glad to see outreach
[1:06:40] going on i'm so glad
[1:06:42] but let's make sure that we present the
[1:06:44] right image
[1:06:46] otherwise you're harming you're you're
[1:06:49] falling in the trend of the two
[1:06:51] messengers that blinded laodicea
[1:06:54] that blinded the sodomites remember
[1:06:56] because that's what the two messengers
[1:06:58] did in this day
[1:06:59] they told they sold to the people that
[1:07:02] all you had to do was have a mental
[1:07:04] acceptance of that day on calvary and
[1:07:06] mentally accept the historical figure of
[1:07:08] jesus christ that he was the son of god
[1:07:10] and died for your sins
[1:07:11] but but john made it clear that that
[1:07:14] historical figure was the word
[1:07:16] in the beginning and he's the word today
[1:07:19] and so if you if you say i really have
[1:07:23] accepted
[1:07:23] that man then you're accepting this now
[1:07:26] and if you're not accepting this now
[1:07:28] you're not accepting that man you're
[1:07:30] accepting an idea of that man
[1:07:33] he was the son of god you're not wrong
[1:07:35] in that he did die
[1:07:36] die for the sins of the whole world
[1:07:37] you're not wrong in that
[1:07:39] but he his his his secret to the
[1:07:42] to his disciples was a little while and
[1:07:45] the world won't see this historical man
[1:07:49] and the apostle picks that up and said
[1:07:51] there was a time when we
[1:07:52] we know today we know no man after the
[1:07:54] flesh merely
[1:07:56] i'll inject that merely we don't know he
[1:07:59] said not even the man christ jesus
[1:08:01] we don't just know him after the flesh
[1:08:03] anymore you'll never i'm here to tell
[1:08:05] you
[1:08:05] the world is never going to see the
[1:08:07] galilean walking the shores doing going
[1:08:10] about doing good
[1:08:11] the only because that man doesn't appear
[1:08:14] on this earth until the end of the of
[1:08:17] the tribulation
[1:08:18] in revelation 19. the that that man
[1:08:21] appears in the sky to receive the bride
[1:08:23] and the world misses that
[1:08:25] he comes like a thief the only version
[1:08:28] of that man they will see today
[1:08:31] is in you in his bride
[1:08:34] you're the flesh that they will see and
[1:08:37] encounter now
[1:08:39] amen so that is the major
[1:08:43] message that's a major part is to
[1:08:46] explain how the book of redemption what
[1:08:48] it has
[1:08:49] uncovered and so the whole bible then we
[1:08:53] find a bible teaches of its own self
[1:08:56] that its principles and its doctrines
[1:08:58] and its teachings and everything about
[1:08:59] it
[1:09:00] that that and even even the family of
[1:09:02] god
[1:09:04] where their names were put in a book
[1:09:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:10] that's what the bible teaches us and
[1:09:13] there's nothing that can change
[1:09:15] one single line of it now jesus said
[1:09:17] that's why jesus could say
[1:09:20] heavens and earth will pass away before
[1:09:21] any of my word will pass away
[1:09:24] now the only the the if you think that
[1:09:26] through this could only be true
[1:09:29] if jesus is saying heavens and earth
[1:09:31] will pass away
[1:09:33] but not my word see the heavens and
[1:09:36] earth would pass away before my word
[1:09:38] would pass away
[1:09:39] so the only way that could be true is if
[1:09:42] the word was written before the
[1:09:43] foundations of the heaven and earth
[1:09:46] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:09:48] word will never pass away that's only
[1:09:49] possible
[1:09:50] if the word existed before the
[1:09:52] foundations of heaven and earth
[1:09:54] and so if it existed before the
[1:09:56] foundation of heavens and earth
[1:09:57] and i'm finding out that i'm a part of
[1:09:59] it then i existed in god in the mind of
[1:10:02] god
[1:10:03] before the foundation of the world and
[1:10:06] so
[1:10:06] god knowing by experience how all
[1:10:08] creation would do how all history would
[1:10:10] go
[1:10:11] and here's the beauty of the revealed
[1:10:13] word is
[1:10:14] is is what's really behind all the
[1:10:17] history
[1:10:19] it's one thing to know the history it's
[1:10:20] one thing to know the history of calvary
[1:10:22] but i do you know what's behind it
[1:10:24] do you understand what it's all about
[1:10:25] you understand how god led up to that
[1:10:28] and then accomplished that and then has
[1:10:29] went forward since that time
[1:10:31] see and so if you're missing that then
[1:10:34] you're missing the whole enchilada
[1:10:35] because you can't
[1:10:36] you're not going to gain the only way
[1:10:39] the bible teaches us very clearly very
[1:10:42] clearly
[1:10:43] and i could preach a whole sermon
[1:10:46] starting from right now and take you to
[1:10:47] scripture after scripture after
[1:10:48] scripture
[1:10:49] the new birth only comes by revelation
[1:10:52] of the word
[1:10:53] that's always how it comes it's god
[1:10:56] revealing himself personally to you
[1:10:58] in his word and you accept it you're
[1:11:00] like mary you say amen to the word it's
[1:11:02] revealed to her she caught it she said
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:04] and she practiced her amen
[1:11:07] and so so so we find that that it's not
[1:11:10] about being convinced of right or wrong
[1:11:12] teaching
[1:11:13] that i mean teaching you know we all
[1:11:15] sometimes get our teaching a little
[1:11:17] skewed and we have to get corrected that
[1:11:19] happens to me as a preacher
[1:11:20] and i've been studying it since a boy i
[1:11:23] still find things where i find an old
[1:11:25] note and go hmm
[1:11:26] that was pretty true but let me sharpen
[1:11:28] my lens on that a little bit
[1:11:30] and i have to add an addendum to that or
[1:11:32] sometimes do a line item veto
[1:11:34] you know of my former thought and i go
[1:11:36] well that's good until that line
[1:11:38] scratch that out you know i'm having i
[1:11:41] don't have any pride keeping me from
[1:11:42] that i'm
[1:11:43] i humble myself to the word of god i'm
[1:11:45] like paul i know nothing and want to
[1:11:47] know nothing save jesus christ
[1:11:49] and him crucified because i'm aware that
[1:11:53] that's the only way i can survive that's
[1:11:55] the only
[1:11:55] source of life is christ in his word
[1:11:59] see so i'm not here to have a different
[1:12:01] version of the word or
[1:12:03] compromise the version that god sent
[1:12:06] see so so we find then that
[1:12:10] the question becomes you know
[1:12:14] where do you want to find yourself today
[1:12:17] yes
[1:12:17] amen what is it make up your mind
[1:12:21] what is it you want from god why are you
[1:12:24] a believer
[1:12:25] why are you in church see why why have
[1:12:28] you
[1:12:29] embraced something that is so
[1:12:32] in such a minority and largely derided
[1:12:34] by the world
[1:12:36] as a cult and as and they they there's
[1:12:38] no way
[1:12:39] i get it of course they can't prove that
[1:12:41] they not by the bible anyway
[1:12:43] you can't and i've challenged it around
[1:12:45] the world there's no no chance to
[1:12:47] disprove a single teaching of this
[1:12:49] message not not using your bible
[1:12:51] if you're going to try to challenge the
[1:12:53] the message teaching you better find a
[1:12:55] different book not this one
[1:12:57] this one eats you up trying to do that
[1:12:58] one and i've i've that that's
[1:13:01] been there done that got the t-shirt got
[1:13:03] tro got got t-shirts galore over that
[1:13:06] so there there's no i can hear i'm here
[1:13:08] to tell you friends as a student of the
[1:13:10] scripture we have not
[1:13:11] believed cunningly devised tales it is
[1:13:14] all
[1:13:15] certainly and not only provable
[1:13:16] doctrinally and theologically
[1:13:18] but it's provable in our lives
[1:13:21] it it literally turns people into this
[1:13:24] image into the image of this and that's
[1:13:25] what paul is talking about
[1:13:27] this is all gold and silver and precious
[1:13:30] stones
[1:13:31] but if you're not careful even as a
[1:13:33] child of god
[1:13:34] you'll build your life and your family
[1:13:36] and your activities and
[1:13:38] and and your career and what you're
[1:13:40] chasing whether it's the american dream
[1:13:42] the global dream the whoever's dream
[1:13:45] you know uh and and you'll find that
[1:13:46] it's all wood hay and stubble
[1:13:48] and the age and the fires of judgment
[1:13:50] that are falling upon us
[1:13:52] what you've built won't survive
[1:13:55] you yourself will paul makes that clear
[1:13:59] you that the person might survive
[1:14:01] because they're a child of god
[1:14:03] but i you know i don't want to run in
[1:14:05] vain
[1:14:07] i'm glad i'm a child of god i'm glad i'm
[1:14:10] a son of god i'm glad he revealed his
[1:14:12] word to me and i want to show
[1:14:14] my gratitude to the world for what he
[1:14:17] has
[1:14:18] done for me see
[1:14:21] and so you have to decide where you want
[1:14:23] to find yourself today for me
[1:14:26] i choose that record written in heaven
[1:14:30] that's for me in my house i choose this
[1:14:32] record
[1:14:34] not interested in the fortune and
[1:14:35] glories of the world
[1:14:38] you know reality defies expectation
[1:14:42] very often we find in the world today i
[1:14:45] want to read you some statements brother
[1:14:46] and i made in the legacy and church age
[1:14:49] and we we find here that he makes this
[1:14:52] statement let me
[1:14:53] let me let me catch this first part of
[1:14:55] it
[1:14:56] so he says in the laodicean church age
[1:14:58] in the church age book god says
[1:15:00] this church of the laodicean age is
[1:15:02] wretched now that's scripture you can
[1:15:03] read it for yourself
[1:15:05] the word comes from two greek words
[1:15:07] which means endure and trial
[1:15:10] and it has nothing to do with the trials
[1:15:12] that come to a true christian for god
[1:15:14] describes a christian in trial as
[1:15:16] blessed
[1:15:17] amen amen and his attitude
[1:15:20] in a trial one of joy whereas
[1:15:24] the term the description is phrased
[1:15:28] wretched and miserable so clearly
[1:15:31] that's not talking about a christian
[1:15:35] not a person who's born of the spirit of
[1:15:37] god it might be talking about
[1:15:38] the 45 000 different so-called
[1:15:42] and in fact is it is talking about those
[1:15:44] systems of man
[1:15:46] that that produces wretchedness
[1:15:49] see and and that's not something william
[1:15:52] branham invented that you can read it in
[1:15:54] your own bible
[1:15:56] that church of the last day was not
[1:15:59] called glorious she was called blind
[1:16:02] she was not called virtuous she was
[1:16:03] called naked
[1:16:06] see and she didn't have christ in her
[1:16:08] midst because
[1:16:09] she kicks him out and he's found on the
[1:16:13] outside
[1:16:13] knocking calling to individuals come out
[1:16:15] of her my people
[1:16:17] if you'll open the door if you'll open
[1:16:19] your heart to me i will come
[1:16:21] into you and we'll have fellowship i'll
[1:16:24] sup with you
[1:16:25] oh the plan of god is so divine i love
[1:16:28] it
[1:16:29] it it it soothes me it gives me peace
[1:16:32] and understanding of what's happening in
[1:16:34] the world today
[1:16:35] it's how i sleep at night peacefully tie
[1:16:38] rise it doesn't matter what the
[1:16:39] headlines say
[1:16:41] i already know what's behind it all
[1:16:46] so he says
[1:16:49] a cr so he says and it has nothing to do
[1:16:52] this this word
[1:16:54] uh wretched the word comes from two
[1:16:56] greek words which means endure and trial
[1:16:59] has nothing to do with uh the trials
[1:17:01] that come to a true christian
[1:17:03] uh for god describes a christian in
[1:17:05] trial as blessed and his attitude one of
[1:17:07] joy
[1:17:07] whereas the description is phrased as
[1:17:09] wretched and miserable how strange now
[1:17:11] listen watch
[1:17:13] how strange remember i'm talking about
[1:17:16] reality often defies expectation
[1:17:20] you know all should be well but it's not
[1:17:24] and you know we've got a world falling
[1:17:26] apart and
[1:17:27] ripping apart at the seams and and then
[1:17:30] yet in this modern age
[1:17:32] you know we we have such such wealth and
[1:17:35] such
[1:17:35] technology and such civilization
[1:17:39] we have so much civilized law and
[1:17:42] civilized standards and
[1:17:43] and there's so much you know modern
[1:17:45] medicine and
[1:17:46] and and wealth and it's it's all over
[1:17:49] the world
[1:17:50] and yet you know in this modern age we
[1:17:53] should have ease
[1:17:55] until reality smashes you in the face
[1:18:00] and you realize what's wrong something
[1:18:02] broken here
[1:18:03] and brother branham says how strange in
[1:18:05] this age of plenty
[1:18:08] in this age of progress in this age of
[1:18:11] abundance how
[1:18:12] can there be trials well now it is
[1:18:15] strange but in this age of plenty and
[1:18:17] opportunity
[1:18:18] when everyone has so much and there's so
[1:18:20] much more to be had
[1:18:22] what with all the inventions to do our
[1:18:24] work and so many things
[1:18:26] to give us pleasure now it's so good you
[1:18:28] don't even have to work they'll just
[1:18:30] keep paying you
[1:18:33] and nobody wants to work anymore i had a
[1:18:37] the manager of kroger tried to explain
[1:18:38] to me the other day i'm at the customer
[1:18:40] service to exchange a refund that i've
[1:18:42] i've brought all the way from buford and
[1:18:43] there's no one working there and he says
[1:18:45] i'm sorry i had to take the customer
[1:18:46] service lady and put her on the
[1:18:48] on the cash register because we got
[1:18:49] lines going down people are standing in
[1:18:51] line
[1:18:52] and i said well when will she be back he
[1:18:53] said i can't tell you
[1:18:55] i said well how do i get a refund he
[1:18:56] said you have to do it there and i'm
[1:18:58] like
[1:18:58] so he goes i'm sorry sir he says we
[1:19:00] can't find anybody wanting to work
[1:19:03] and there's a man from new york from new
[1:19:05] york visiting
[1:19:06] and he pipes up and he goes yeah he said
[1:19:09] i just saw it in the paper today
[1:19:10] he said up north he said if you if a man
[1:19:14] and a woman
[1:19:14] were don't anybody moved to new york
[1:19:16] finding this out said if a man and woman
[1:19:19] who were both employed or now are now
[1:19:21] staying at home
[1:19:22] and they're collecting unemployment plus
[1:19:25] plus the
[1:19:26] free stimulus money that the
[1:19:27] government's handing out he says their
[1:19:29] salary right now
[1:19:30] is a hundred thousand dollars
[1:19:34] to stay home a hundred grand
[1:19:38] why would they go to work see
[1:19:41] and so so he says with all of our
[1:19:44] inventions to do our work and so many
[1:19:47] things to give us pleasure
[1:19:49] now brother bran was saying this is what
[1:19:51] i mean we should have utopia
[1:19:54] i mean this should be shangri-la my
[1:19:56] goodness we got machines to do our work
[1:19:57] we got
[1:19:58] money we got and and everything we've
[1:20:00] got we've even got opportunities to even
[1:20:02] have more depends on how much we want to
[1:20:04] you know go to the grinder wheel and i
[1:20:07] mean you can you can chase your dream
[1:20:08] and have at it and be all you can be and
[1:20:10] go for it and just do it
[1:20:13] and they've got every slogan out there
[1:20:15] encouraging you
[1:20:17] and brother branham says how strange it
[1:20:19] is that when right in the middle of all
[1:20:20] of this
[1:20:21] suddenly we find a mental illness taking
[1:20:24] such a toll as to alarm the nation
[1:20:26] and that was in the 60s when it was cub
[1:20:28] scouts today the mental illness
[1:20:31] is un it's indescribable
[1:20:34] that every day in this country we have a
[1:20:36] mass shooting on average
[1:20:38] and so supposed to be saying oh he was
[1:20:41] my neighbor and they were
[1:20:42] he always seemed to be fine a fine man i
[1:20:44] can't believe that she did that and
[1:20:45] conspired with a boyfriend and did all
[1:20:47] this and
[1:20:48] and killed and and then babies and
[1:20:50] children and
[1:20:51] and and i mean and and a prophet said
[1:20:54] back then
[1:20:55] back then in the 60s said the world's
[1:20:56] going insane
[1:20:58] that wasn't his opinion that was
[1:21:00] prophecy and nobody else was pointing to
[1:21:03] it but
[1:21:03] a lone prophet was saying it's going to
[1:21:05] get worse and worse until jesus comes
[1:21:08] till the whole world
[1:21:09] will go completely insane i'm here to
[1:21:12] tell you something friends you've
[1:21:12] arrived
[1:21:13] and you're not going to want to be
[1:21:15] building your life off of wood hay and
[1:21:17] stubble
[1:21:18] at this time at this juncture we have
[1:21:21] arrived at
[1:21:22] probably the greatest juncture of time
[1:21:24] of all junctures
[1:21:25] of all time god is getting ready to
[1:21:29] translate a bride off of the earth
[1:21:33] when everybody ought to be happy with
[1:21:35] really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:21:38] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:21:41] pet pills in the morning
[1:21:43] rushing to doctors entering institutions
[1:21:45] trying to drown out unknown fears by
[1:21:47] alcohol
[1:21:47] he goes on and on and on and on and on
[1:21:49] so he says
[1:21:50] yes this aids boasts catch it this age
[1:21:54] boasts of its tremendous stores of
[1:21:56] worldly goods
[1:21:57] but the people are less happy than ever
[1:21:59] this age boasts of its spiritual
[1:22:01] attainments but the people are less sure
[1:22:03] of themselves than ever
[1:22:04] this age boasts of better moral values
[1:22:06] and it is more corrupt than any age
[1:22:08] since the flood
[1:22:10] amen you know this is true
[1:22:13] you live out there with me you know this
[1:22:15] is true
[1:22:16] it talks about its knowledge in science
[1:22:19] but it's fighting a losing battle in all
[1:22:21] fields for the human mind and soul and
[1:22:22] spirit cannot comprehend
[1:22:24] or keep abreast with all the changes
[1:22:25] that have come upon the earth in one
[1:22:27] generation
[1:22:28] we've gone all the way from horse and
[1:22:29] buggy age to the space age and we're
[1:22:31] proud and boastful about it
[1:22:32] but inside is a dark void cavern that is
[1:22:36] crying out in torment
[1:22:38] and without a known reason men's hearts
[1:22:41] are failing for fear
[1:22:42] and the world is so dark in that this
[1:22:44] age could well be called the age of
[1:22:46] neurotics
[1:22:50] it boasts but it cannot back it up it
[1:22:52] cries peace and there is no peace it
[1:22:53] cries that it has great
[1:22:55] amplitude of all things but it keeps
[1:22:57] burning with desire
[1:22:58] like an unsatisfied fire there is no
[1:23:01] peace saith my god
[1:23:02] to the wicked
[1:23:06] my he makes a statement
[1:23:09] and i'm not gonna read it because i just
[1:23:11] want to keep moving
[1:23:13] he makes a statement about the age we
[1:23:15] live in how that it's an age of
[1:23:18] pressures and and a great burden of the
[1:23:20] last age
[1:23:21] was this neurotic age that we live in
[1:23:24] amen and you know he he talks about
[1:23:28] how that you know the great burden of
[1:23:31] the last stage now catch
[1:23:33] this this is astonishing he first
[1:23:36] compares the
[1:23:37] the burden of the martyrs in the church
[1:23:40] ages
[1:23:41] who went to the lion's dens who were
[1:23:44] burned at the stake
[1:23:45] who were torn asunder you know uh
[1:23:48] by by martyrdom and he says now that's
[1:23:51] not our burden that was a burden of that
[1:23:53] age
[1:23:53] they had a knox anointing to get them
[1:23:55] through that today we have an eagle
[1:23:57] anointing to keep us soaring above all
[1:23:59] the darkness and chaos
[1:24:00] see and so but he says now
[1:24:04] the burden of the last age
[1:24:08] is the pressures of riches
[1:24:13] the pressures of it not only to have and
[1:24:17] have
[1:24:17] more and have all you can get and have
[1:24:19] half of everybody else's that's
[1:24:21] left laying around and i mean the the
[1:24:23] like brother ernie would say
[1:24:24] you're you're in the little you're in
[1:24:26] the little rat in the spin wheel and
[1:24:28] you're going
[1:24:28] as fast as you can you ain't going
[1:24:30] anywhere
[1:24:31] he says even if you win the great rat
[1:24:34] race
[1:24:35] you're still a rat
[1:24:40] oh i want to be an eagle soaring off the
[1:24:42] off the earth
[1:24:44] and so he says the example the great
[1:24:47] burden of the last age is the pressure
[1:24:49] of riches
[1:24:50] one soft living
[1:24:54] two and nervous tension
[1:24:59] now catch what he's connecting the
[1:25:01] pursuit i said years ago
[1:25:03] isn't it funny that everybody goes crazy
[1:25:06] trying to pursue to become the thing
[1:25:08] that jesus said
[1:25:10] would be almost impossible to go to
[1:25:11] heaven as
[1:25:15] isn't that amazing and yet satan has us
[1:25:18] on that treadmill trying to become the
[1:25:20] very thing
[1:25:21] determined to become the very thing that
[1:25:24] jesus said would be almost impossible
[1:25:26] even to go to heaven as and everybody
[1:25:28] wants to be that
[1:25:30] see and so he attaches the pursuit
[1:25:34] of riches soft living and he connects it
[1:25:38] with nervous tension what what a
[1:25:40] what a trifold thing that is
[1:25:44] and he says soft living and nervous
[1:25:47] tension
[1:25:48] in a complex age
[1:25:52] that we seem unfitted to live in
[1:25:55] amen amen now
[1:25:58] if if you're not born again of the
[1:26:00] spirit of god
[1:26:02] that just that makes no sense to you
[1:26:05] because the the spirit of the world says
[1:26:08] be all get all go for it just do it run
[1:26:11] hurry quickly
[1:26:13] and nobody takes responsibility anymore
[1:26:15] and dishonesty is now the norm and
[1:26:18] and you know nervous tension of the
[1:26:20] world but for the christian we realize
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:24] wow this i seem unfitted
[1:26:27] to live here you know i see i see my
[1:26:30] neighbors and what all they're doing and
[1:26:32] i'm not trying to be weird i'm not
[1:26:33] trying to stand out i just feel like
[1:26:35] i don't belong in this world anymore
[1:26:38] it's gone cuckoo the laws they're
[1:26:42] passing the the things i see in the
[1:26:44] headline and the things people are
[1:26:46] marching over and
[1:26:47] rallying around and you know this agenda
[1:26:51] and that agenda and this political move
[1:26:53] and that political move
[1:26:54] i did i finally quit reading the
[1:26:55] headlines i said i'm so unfitted for
[1:26:57] this
[1:26:59] and yet i and yet i'm here so you know
[1:27:01] when i decided i thought well my
[1:27:03] goodness
[1:27:04] then then if i gotta be here i'm sure
[1:27:06] gonna run it correctly
[1:27:08] i'm sure gonna try to live it right so
[1:27:10] that i can try to help somebody
[1:27:13] because i realize that that the world is
[1:27:15] being destroyed and i
[1:27:17] i'm going into a rapture and i would
[1:27:19] really like to take everybody with me
[1:27:21] that i possibly can
[1:27:26] and so you can rest assure that's why
[1:27:29] i'm building my life out of gold
[1:27:31] out of gold silver and precious stones
[1:27:33] that's exactly
[1:27:34] why i don't build my life out of wood
[1:27:37] hay and stubble
[1:27:38] and why i preach to you that you
[1:27:40] shouldn't do that either
[1:27:43] see stop chasing this world a
[1:27:46] christian's unfitted to even live in it
[1:27:50] see the further the age
[1:27:53] see this fourth age seems to have had a
[1:27:55] clear-cut burden it was to defy rome
[1:27:57] stand up for the word even unto death
[1:27:59] and so that's in the thyatiran age so
[1:28:02] you know i i just wanna i just wanna
[1:28:04] speak to you from my heart now
[1:28:06] you've heard what the prophet said this
[1:28:09] complex
[1:28:11] age that as believers as real christians
[1:28:15] born of the spirit of god
[1:28:17] we seem unfitted to live in and i wonder
[1:28:21] if we have a full appreciation
[1:28:24] of just how unfitted this world has
[1:28:27] become
[1:28:28] amen for a true believer to live in
[1:28:32] are we have we become like the frog
[1:28:34] slowly boiled in oil
[1:28:36] boiled in water and the temperature just
[1:28:38] goes up slowly until he doesn't even
[1:28:40] realize he's being cooked
[1:28:41] alive because the new the higher
[1:28:44] temperature was unnoticed it's just more
[1:28:46] normal
[1:28:47] just more normal and then finally his
[1:28:49] last thoughts are oh my goodness it's so
[1:28:51] hot and then he's gone
[1:28:53] see and i wonder today friends here
[1:28:56] in near the end already almost halfway
[1:28:59] through another year
[1:29:02] here we are halfway through 2021
[1:29:05] and i wonder if we have a full
[1:29:07] appreciation
[1:29:09] of over the last half century since the
[1:29:12] opening of the
[1:29:13] of god's word i wonder if we have a full
[1:29:16] appreciation of just how
[1:29:18] unfitted this world has become
[1:29:21] it might explain when i think about this
[1:29:25] question
[1:29:26] it helps to explain to me you know how i
[1:29:30] see
[1:29:30] people who i believe to be true children
[1:29:33] of god
[1:29:35] and yet not accomplishing their mission
[1:29:37] too well
[1:29:39] all right this is just in shepherd's
[1:29:42] heart
[1:29:42] speaking to you this is my job this is
[1:29:45] my duty
[1:29:46] all right my sister melissa i think
[1:29:48] years ago i still have it in my office
[1:29:50] gave me a plaque
[1:29:52] and it is the duty of a pastor to
[1:29:55] comfort the afflicted
[1:29:57] and to afflict the comfortable
[1:30:02] but sometimes it helps me to explain how
[1:30:05] i see people who i believe to be true
[1:30:07] children of god
[1:30:08] yet they're not really accomplishing
[1:30:10] their mission too well
[1:30:11] lots of visible wear and tear i'm just
[1:30:15] telling you as a shepherd who overlooks
[1:30:17] your life who's here as a guide and as a
[1:30:19] bishop
[1:30:20] for your soul as the bible calls me i
[1:30:22] take that job very seriously
[1:30:24] see and i i cannot i cannot hold back
[1:30:26] sometimes i
[1:30:28] i say things and i'm i'm i'm not immune
[1:30:31] from saying them in the wrong way but i
[1:30:32] always try to at least say
[1:30:34] what's true and i'm definitely guilty of
[1:30:38] not always using the right tact and
[1:30:40] not having the right bedside manner but
[1:30:42] but i but i have taken the hippocratic
[1:30:45] oath to do no harm
[1:30:46] i am a doctor i am a doctor that's what
[1:30:49] i do
[1:30:50] here's my medical book and i i'm trying
[1:30:53] to bring because the word of god is
[1:30:55] health to all your flesh
[1:30:56] so i'm a dispenser of health
[1:30:59] see so a lot of times i i might have to
[1:31:02] be you know just put it to you straight
[1:31:04] hey keep doing that you're going to die
[1:31:07] and and sometimes people don't like to
[1:31:08] hear a doctor say that
[1:31:10] you know but i'm trying to get you to
[1:31:12] take this medicine
[1:31:14] so that because i know if you don't then
[1:31:17] doane down the line i got more meds but
[1:31:19] they get more nasty
[1:31:20] have more side effects and i don't want
[1:31:22] to see you get all the way to the bottom
[1:31:24] of my doctor's bag
[1:31:25] and the best answer i've got for you is
[1:31:28] a bad one
[1:31:30] i'm sorry you should have took the
[1:31:31] medicine at the top of my bag
[1:31:33] it would have fixed the problem and you
[1:31:35] wouldn't end it up where you are
[1:31:37] see and now the medicine i got it'll
[1:31:39] work but man are you gonna have some
[1:31:40] side effects
[1:31:42] man is it gonna be bitter going down see
[1:31:45] and so i you know i see visible
[1:31:49] wear and tear on people who i firmly
[1:31:52] believe to be
[1:31:53] children of god i see a lot of wear and
[1:31:55] tear and life habits
[1:31:58] that are questionable by the holy ghost
[1:32:00] you know the holy ghost will question
[1:32:02] you
[1:32:03] don't think he won't he questioned
[1:32:04] balaam
[1:32:06] who's this in your house lord
[1:32:09] uh i got this question i need to ask you
[1:32:11] and you know can i do this can i do this
[1:32:13] can i do this
[1:32:14] and god never even regarded his question
[1:32:16] he just said he answered his question
[1:32:17] with a question who's in your house why
[1:32:18] are these people
[1:32:19] why are you talking to them
[1:32:23] well they offered me they they shouldn't
[1:32:25] even be under your roof
[1:32:28] their whole motive and objective their
[1:32:30] modus operandi
[1:32:31] is to is to curse my people
[1:32:35] to do harm to my family why would you
[1:32:38] have anything in your home that does
[1:32:40] harm to my family
[1:32:42] why would you have a lifestyle that's
[1:32:44] harming my family
[1:32:47] see and so i he quite remember
[1:32:50] he questioned david sent nathan what do
[1:32:53] you say
[1:32:54] david i'm such and such a case and david
[1:32:56] says that man needs to die
[1:32:58] and nathan said well hate to break the
[1:33:00] bad news to you you're the guy
[1:33:03] i'm actually talking about you david see
[1:33:07] and so i you know i see i see church
[1:33:10] habits with tremendous wear and tear
[1:33:13] my goodness with tremendous wear and
[1:33:16] tear sometimes i scarcely can identify
[1:33:18] the
[1:33:19] the person that i once knew i can
[1:33:21] scarcely compare their
[1:33:22] past to their present i've seen whole
[1:33:26] families to where
[1:33:27] here's a former way they used to look
[1:33:28] and now here's where and i go
[1:33:31] my the wear and tear that has taken its
[1:33:33] toll
[1:33:34] on this whole family oh this brother
[1:33:37] this sister they used to have such a
[1:33:39] sincerity such a prayer life such a
[1:33:41] dedication
[1:33:42] that family was such a way and now it's
[1:33:44] now this person this
[1:33:46] dad this mom this pastor this deacon
[1:33:48] this this young person
[1:33:50] that those children they're they're
[1:33:52] whole you can see their whole mindset is

[1:34:36] dwelling place your
[1:34:38] life is to be a a reflection of his word
[1:34:41] to a blind wretched complex neurotic
[1:34:45] age chasing the wrong things
[1:34:48] and your life is supposed to be an
[1:34:50] example of the polar opposite
[1:34:53] so that they can look at their chase and
[1:34:55] and know that
[1:34:56] the turmoil they feel in their lives and
[1:34:58] look at you and say
[1:35:00] gee how do you don't even have as much
[1:35:02] as me i got way more money than you but
[1:35:03] man you have more peace than me

[1:35:07] my kids to the best school and i got

[1:35:11] full of love and kindness and how did

[1:35:17] preacher say well i'm glad you asked
[1:35:20] you got a little while i can tell you
[1:35:22] how this happened didn't happen because
[1:35:24] i got a lot of virtue or wisdom
[1:35:26] but i but i but the mighty god was
[1:35:28] unveiled in this hour
[1:35:30] and he told me how to apply the token to
[1:35:32] my home and told me what to get rid of
[1:35:34] and told me what
[1:35:35] where i should go and to do and not do
[1:35:37] and today you got people who don't even
[1:35:38] care what a prophet said about those
[1:35:39] things
[1:35:40] have completely dismissed it as just
[1:35:42] well that was just his opinion i don't
[1:35:43] even need to do that anymore
[1:35:45] oh my goodness keep building off a wood
[1:35:47] hand stubble
[1:35:49] everything you're building is going to
[1:35:50] burn to the ground
[1:35:53] i'm here today to try to persuade you if
[1:35:56] if
[1:35:56] if i have to wave my arms and raise my
[1:35:58] voice or get soft and try to if i have
[1:36:00] to cry whatever i have to do i want to
[1:36:02] persuade you
[1:36:03] stop building your life out of wood hay
[1:36:06] and stubble
[1:36:07] you yourself might be saved but
[1:36:09] everything you're you're going to waste
[1:36:11] it all
[1:36:12] you're going to have problems you can't
[1:36:13] even solve without bitter medicine
[1:36:15] i want to tell you today there's a
[1:36:17] master builder who has a plan
[1:36:20] and you are valuable the real estate
[1:36:22] you're built out of the
[1:36:23] soil of the earth and god has had many
[1:36:27] times
[1:36:28] you know very high value real estate
[1:36:32] let me let me come to a close here in
[1:36:34] the next seven or eight minutes
[1:36:38] in genesis god sectioned off
[1:36:41] a very high piece of earth
[1:36:45] he picked a place where three rivers
[1:36:46] converged and he said of all the earth
[1:36:48] i'm going to build a garden
[1:36:50] right there of everywhere he could have
[1:36:53] built it
[1:36:53] he went all around the earth and said um
[1:36:56] right
[1:36:56] there i'm gonna build up my headquarters
[1:36:59] and i'm gonna build a beautiful garden
[1:37:01] and i'm gonna put my son and his bride
[1:37:03] there and i'm gonna give them
[1:37:06] godship over the earth
[1:37:10] there's another time god carved out a
[1:37:12] high value piece of real estate
[1:37:15] in the middle east and he promised it to
[1:37:18] abraham and to his descendants
[1:37:20] the only time in the only time in human
[1:37:22] history that i know of
[1:37:24] everybody runs around and says they've
[1:37:26] got they own land and on this and on i
[1:37:28] don't know that i don't have any record
[1:37:29] that the creator of all the land gave it
[1:37:31] to anyone other than
[1:37:32] he gave a piece of land to israel
[1:37:36] i don't even know i know even the native
[1:37:38] american claims oh you took my land okay
[1:37:40] well why
[1:37:41] who where how is it your land you know i
[1:37:44] only know of
[1:37:45] one piece of land that actually the
[1:37:47] creator of all the land
[1:37:49] gave to a people and titled it to them
[1:37:51] and deeded it to them
[1:37:52] and it's their land and when they say
[1:37:55] this is our homeland they're the only
[1:37:56] ones who authoritatively can even say
[1:37:58] that
[1:37:59] see so that's a high value piece of land
[1:38:02] in the middle east
[1:38:03] that everybody wants he gave it to his
[1:38:06] family for a dwelling place to live with
[1:38:08] him forever in
[1:38:11] in it in this land god pushed up a high
[1:38:14] value piece of real estate called mount
[1:38:15] moriah and there he met abraham
[1:38:18] and there abraham built an altar he
[1:38:20] pushed up uh
[1:38:21] you know in the wilderness he pushed up
[1:38:24] in the wilderness the mount sinai and
[1:38:27] there god came down
[1:38:28] imagine in the dawn of time when
[1:38:30] volcanoes were moving and the earth was
[1:38:32] being formed and created and god says
[1:38:35] he has okay somewhere down through
[1:38:39] history
[1:38:40] i'm going to meet abraham and so i need
[1:38:41] a mountain right here okay perfect stop
[1:38:43] right there
[1:38:44] okay now let it cool down and in a
[1:38:46] couple thousand years my servant will go
[1:38:48] there
[1:38:49] and i'll i'll be a ram caught in a
[1:38:51] thicket behind him
[1:38:53] and then someday 400 years later i
[1:38:55] better build me another mountain because
[1:38:57] my people are going to be in bondage
[1:38:58] that's part of my plan i'll let that man
[1:39:00] know when he gets there that's going to
[1:39:02] be 400 years
[1:39:03] and when it finally gets there then i'll
[1:39:04] have another prophet
[1:39:06] and i'll need him to take him to a place
[1:39:07] and i'm going to tell him now you're
[1:39:09] going to go to this place and i'm going
[1:39:10] to build a mountain
[1:39:12] i've had it built for a long time
[1:39:15] and i don't need you to go anywhere else
[1:39:18] in the world but
[1:39:18] right where i built if you
[1:39:22] say why do i got to go to that mountain
[1:39:24] because i'm going to be there
[1:39:26] why is it important that mountain
[1:39:27] because that's the mountain i'm coming
[1:39:29] down on to talk to you
[1:39:30] and if you're at another mountain you're
[1:39:31] going to miss the visitation if abraham
[1:39:34] would
[1:39:34] abraham said well i go yonder to that
[1:39:36] mountain
[1:39:37] i and the lad and i and the lad return
[1:39:38] returned your imagine if he to win
[1:39:40] uh in any many many moats
[1:39:43] catch a mountain by his toe it you know
[1:39:47] where you want to go i like that
[1:39:48] mountain it's green and covered and i
[1:39:49] think i could probably find water and
[1:39:50] game up there no
[1:39:52] there was one mountain see
[1:39:55] it was high value real estate
[1:39:59] near jerusalem near a garden called
[1:40:02] gethsemane
[1:40:03] god pushed up a small
[1:40:07] rather lonely rather non-descript hill
[1:40:11] there's nothing this hill was perfectly
[1:40:13] unremarkable
[1:40:15] to history the hebrews would later call
[1:40:19] it by the name
[1:40:20] golgotha and and that's that's a fitting
[1:40:24] name
[1:40:24] because it literally meant a graveyard
[1:40:27] or burial place that's what golgotha as
[1:40:29] a noun means
[1:40:30] in other words here's a sentence they
[1:40:32] put it in this is a golgotha
[1:40:34] of decaying bones i thought to myself
[1:40:38] what a perfect place for men who are
[1:40:40] dying
[1:40:41] to come to and be renewed and be reborn
[1:40:46] and this this nondescript
[1:40:50] you know nothing nothing about it you
[1:40:52] know nothing
[1:40:54] nothing no interesting features are
[1:40:57] going to be on this mountain yet
[1:40:59] when god was forming the earth he made
[1:41:01] that small lonely hill
[1:41:03] and he knew someday the lamb of god
[1:41:06] would hang to death on it and we find
[1:41:10] that you know it made it a perfect place
[1:41:12] for
[1:41:13] fallen man you know to to shame and
[1:41:17] destroy
[1:41:18] the most viable piece of earth ever
[1:41:20] known
[1:41:21] which was the lord jesus see they didn't
[1:41:24] desecrate the hill they desecrated the
[1:41:26] piece of earth
[1:41:27] being killed on the hill jesus remember
[1:41:29] i read you the quote
[1:41:30] this is my body this is my part of the
[1:41:32] earth and i'm living inside him
[1:41:35] and here jesus is a part of that earth
[1:41:38] you're a part of the earth
[1:41:40] and he had to become a part of what
[1:41:42] you're a part of because you had to be
[1:41:43] the same kind of species
[1:41:45] the only way he could be kinfolk to you
[1:41:47] to die as a kinsmen redeemer is he had
[1:41:49] to become a human like you
[1:41:52] see and he he walks that hill and here
[1:41:55] they destroy the most
[1:41:56] viable piece of earth ever known here
[1:41:59] they would vandalize and
[1:42:00] and tear apart the most precious gift
[1:42:03] god had ever bestowed on human men on
[1:42:05] humankind
[1:42:07] that hill that came to be called calvary
[1:42:11] luke says in luke 23 and when they were
[1:42:15] come to the place which is called
[1:42:16] calvary
[1:42:17] there they crucified him the male
[1:42:20] factors one on the right hand and other
[1:42:22] on the left brother branham picks it up
[1:42:23] in the indictment
[1:42:24] the greatest religious city the most
[1:42:27] religious people
[1:42:30] the most religious people of all the
[1:42:31] races
[1:42:33] in the most religious city and the most
[1:42:36] important time of their feast
[1:42:40] they crucified him the most precious
[1:42:44] thing the most in the most religious
[1:42:47] city
[1:42:49] at the most religious feast the most
[1:42:52] religious
[1:42:52] people killed the greatest offering
[1:42:56] god had ever offered a human to humanity
[1:43:01] here god would raise an ensign for all
[1:43:04] the world to see
[1:43:06] jesus said if i be lifted up from the
[1:43:08] earth
[1:43:09] will draw all men unto me all men all
[1:43:12] men all men all men
[1:43:13] good men bad men indifferent men
[1:43:17] he's here to draw them all how's he
[1:43:19] going how's he going to draw
[1:43:21] listen how's he going to draw this age
[1:43:24] if you won't be him
[1:43:25] amen are you you're going to have him
[1:43:28] come back and
[1:43:29] go and die again i'm here to tell you
[1:43:32] he's not supposed to have to come back
[1:43:34] and be crucified again
[1:43:36] he's supposed to be living in you and me
[1:43:38] so that he can do what draw all men
[1:43:41] good men bad men and different men
[1:43:43] wounded men ruin men
[1:43:44] hurt men so he can draw all men
[1:43:47] the best thing you can do for a ruined
[1:43:50] man is be
[1:43:51] christ the best thing you can do for a
[1:43:54] bad man
[1:43:55] is to portray the true image
[1:43:58] of the word be a master builder
[1:44:04] see the beauty of it all
[1:44:10] was that no matter how ruined a man or
[1:44:12] woman is
[1:44:14] god was basically saying if you come to
[1:44:16] me there if you'll come to me at calvary
[1:44:19] i'll bury all your sins in the sea of
[1:44:21] god's forgetfulness forever
[1:44:24] if you'll come stand with me at golgotha
[1:44:27] then you'll stand with me on zion
[1:44:31] that's why we're master builders friends
[1:44:34] i feel such compassion for those who
[1:44:37] who have followed builders who weren't
[1:44:41] master builders and they have a
[1:44:42] misconception of what
[1:44:44] the real word is if you and i
[1:44:47] don't give it to them in our lives
[1:44:50] then what's the point of your
[1:44:54] life why are you even here and after all
[1:44:56] god is given and
[1:44:57] done i'm here to tell you friends
[1:44:59] sometimes we get a lot of wear and tear
[1:45:01] on us but i'm glad there's somebody here
[1:45:04] who can rebuild why don't you stand up
[1:45:07] with me
[1:45:09] stand up with me as our musicians come i
[1:45:12] thank you for

[1:45:18] offerings and things and
[1:45:20] the camp coming and young people who
[1:45:22] need assistance and
[1:45:23] um so you just keep those things in
[1:45:26] prayer just bow your heads with me all

[1:45:48] something softly for me sister ruth
[1:45:51] thank you lord thank you for allowing me
[1:45:55] to finish this thought and this burden
[1:45:57] of the word for the people
[1:45:59] i feel quite unburdened of it now lord
[1:46:01] and now i want to
[1:46:03] i want to think of its ramifications
[1:46:06] lord in my life and what it all means to
[1:46:07] me
[1:46:08] it wasn't just a sermon lord that's
[1:46:10] that's such a mistake that
[1:46:12] they made there in the old testament to
[1:46:14] um
[1:46:16] to jeremiah and he wondered why
[1:46:19] the people wouldn't listen to his
[1:46:20] message it depressed him he didn't he
[1:46:23] got to where he didn't want to preach
[1:46:24] anymore and he said i i just done i quit
[1:46:27] i can't it's just too much stress
[1:46:30] and and and yet he said but it but it
[1:46:34] was like a fire was shut up inside my
[1:46:36] bones and i couldn't be still
[1:46:38] i couldn't be quiet
[1:46:42] and you explained lord to your prophet
[1:46:44] that
[1:46:45] here's one of the problems prophet the
[1:46:48] the people just view you
[1:46:50] they view your sermons as just a
[1:46:52] beautiful song you're
[1:46:54] eloquent and you're you're you're you're
[1:46:56] part of the royal
[1:46:57] line and and they admire you and you
[1:47:00] they
[1:47:01] they like you as a person but that word
[1:47:04] that you're bringing
[1:47:05] so so they just choose to believe you're
[1:47:07] just a great singer and
[1:47:09] they don't have to take it seriously
[1:47:10] they can just sing those melodies and
[1:47:13] and but it doesn't really need to have
[1:47:15] an impact on their lives
[1:47:18] don't let that be today lord let it be
[1:47:21] that this
[1:47:22] word will have great impact upon the
[1:47:23] people lord everyone in the under the
[1:47:26] sound of my voice that's people in this
[1:47:28] building
[1:47:28] out of the building lord across the
[1:47:30] internet across the archives and live
[1:47:32] stream
[1:47:33] lord i you sent a master builder in this
[1:47:36] day you
[1:47:37] he didn't run without a message he
[1:47:40] didn't come to bring another
[1:47:41] denomination
[1:47:42] forty five thousand and one not
[1:47:45] interested in that lord he wasn't
[1:47:46] interested in that
[1:47:48] he was only interested in dressing the
[1:47:50] bride in the garments of the word that
[1:47:52] was his greatest joy
[1:47:53] and his greatest accomplishment he
[1:47:55] didn't need a college named after him he
[1:47:56] didn't need
[1:47:57] fortune and glory didn't need wealth he
[1:47:59] refused all of that
[1:48:00] many many times had by far
[1:48:04] many times over a greater ministry
[1:48:06] that's admitted to by historians today
[1:48:09] but he never he never wanted it for that
[1:48:11] reason lord he wanted to dress your
[1:48:13] bride
[1:48:14] in the garments of the word lord help us
[1:48:16] teach us
[1:48:17] show us show us how to be
[1:48:20] a real true light not a
[1:48:23] w lord when when a ship
[1:48:28] when a ship is on the raging storm we
[1:48:31] sea and
[1:48:32] it's loaded with people innocent people
[1:48:35] who are just
[1:48:36] trying to get to safety in the harbor
[1:48:38] and
[1:48:39] the storms are raging and it's dark and
[1:48:41] it's nighttime and there's
[1:48:43] no light father that lighthouse on a
[1:48:45] hill
[1:48:46] shining its beam it means everything to
[1:48:49] them
[1:48:51] lord you you wouldn't dim that light
[1:48:54] trying to save people how did that
[1:48:57] thinking ever creep into the message
[1:48:58] that somehow we have to turn
[1:49:00] the light down let's turn the candle
[1:49:02] watt power down
[1:49:03] so we don't stand out no we're a
[1:49:05] lighthouse we're supposed to stand out
[1:49:08] we're supposed to the beam we need to
[1:49:10] brighten the beam
[1:49:11] not dim it to shine it lord
[1:49:15] brighter than it's ever been shown
[1:49:16] because the world is darker than it's
[1:49:18] ever been
[1:49:19] what kind of thinking how upside down it
[1:49:22] would be
[1:49:23] to say i'm gonna i'm gonna live an
[1:49:25] example that is
[1:49:27] is less distinct and i'm gonna have a
[1:49:30] compromise so that i don't put people on
[1:49:32] edge and i
[1:49:33] i don't weird them out no lord i i'm
[1:49:36] trying to find your children i want to
[1:49:38] shine a bright light i'm trying to
[1:49:39] save these people they're being tossed
[1:49:42] on the sea of life and the only way
[1:49:45] is if my light beam is bright enough to
[1:49:47] cut through the darkness
[1:49:51] so help us lord we've got such
[1:49:54] tremendous
[1:49:54] inspiration you've given us to for
[1:49:57] outreach lord and
[1:49:59] there's a revival moving in our youth
[1:50:01] and they're wanting to be a light in the
[1:50:03] community and
[1:50:05] we have business people i i think of i
[1:50:08] think of the the burden
[1:50:10] that's on brother ken's heart and the
[1:50:12] outreach that urban brew is doing i
[1:50:13] think about brother jason demars
[1:50:15] and pouring his heart out to us that he
[1:50:18] he wants to he wants he's asking god to
[1:50:20] show him how he can do more domestic

[1:51:10] him
[1:51:11] i'm not here i'm not chasing that that's
[1:51:13] not my motive
