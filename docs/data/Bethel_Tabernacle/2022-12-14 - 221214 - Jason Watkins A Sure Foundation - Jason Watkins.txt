do to make him love you more now that's really good news because it also means there's not anything you could do to make him love you less foreign the only thing you have control of is your love and dedication to him amen praise the Lord we're happy to have you in the house of God tonight praise the Lord Brother Luther this your son here happy to have him here with us this evening God bless Amen to all of you we got a number who are out sick tonight we got them on the prayer request list here we'll get to it just in a little bit we're going to invite you to Romans chapter 9. amen amen want to take a thought tonight called the sure Foundation I like a sewer Foundation I like a sure thing my I don't like to I never did like to gamble I gambled one time in my life and I sit down with some friends at a poker table I lost a dollar and 85 Cent I was so mad I was destroyed I mean that I I worked hard for that dollar in 85 percent that was back in the day and that was that was way more money than it is now but but uh that that broke me I said I will never gamble away my hard-earned money again that's the stupidest thing in the world praise the Lord but I like a sure thing amen praise the Lord how many know that the Lord is a sure thing my let's read in from verse one and let you be seated Romans 9 we're going to go 1 through 16. I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed for Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen not as though the word of God hath taken none effect so it didn't matter that an entire nation turned him down think about you talking about a Titanic failure that you you get worried about your failures stopping God a whole nation failed a whole nation failed and that did not stop the promise of God it didn't even delay it the Holy Ghost still fell in the upper room amen all right watch not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but here's the real mystery in Isaac shall I seed be called so Isaac was the Christ line the Christ's seed so this is going back to election it doesn't matter that they were had Jewish blood connecting them genetically to Abraham those were the men who called Jesus the devil and they were genetically connected to Abraham but they were not really Israel because Israel is a faith seed this is how you are sons of Abraham because you've now been enjoined back to Abraham through Christ amen watch just by your faith in him all right verse 8. that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah will have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger now that that absolutely if you look at that naturally that God broke his own scripture because the the rights of the firstborn were were instilled in scripture and yet even when he when Jacob ends up Crossing his hands with the son of Joseph the sons of Joseph and you say how how could Esau have been the older the eldest but yet the blessing went to the younger that is contrary to God's word but not just stop and think for a minute if Jacob was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and existed before Stardust and Esau didn't then who really was older amen who really was the eldest son all right so your Earthly condition is never going to affect your heavenly position oh I'm going to preach wow I told you I like a sure thing amen verse 11 for the children being not yet born here I'm reading it again neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but he so have I hated amen let's let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word and the divine inspiration that we feel already now Lord I just commit myself into your hands for the delivery as I have done throughout this day Lord committing myself into your hands as I've studied it Lord and now it's up to you to be the preacher to make it effectual it'll have to be you so I completely now Just Surrender myself I put Faith In You Lord and I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated foreign amen so it's it's amazing how that God is going to pull all of this off and you find out that everything is designed around his purposes now this is a beautiful thing because in one sense you could look at this tonight and and and and I hope there's nobody in here tonight who would be on the outside looking in and saying well you know I'm not sure I'm a part of that promise you know what if I'm what if I'm like Esau then there's really going to be nothing I can do about it well you know when brother Branham when brother Branham goes to the Book of Revelation and you read in the Book of Revelation these very ominous Prophecies of of Mayhem and destruction and chaos and and I mean you know this this is global uh the tribulation the Bible says there's never been a day like it in all of history and there never will be another they like it thank God and so when we look at all of these masses of humanity that the Bible shows in Prophecy that are going to be destroyed you know first of all you have to remember that it's not that God doesn't give Every Man a legitimate chance to save himself God gives Every Man a legit chance it's not a facetious chance and even those who are outside of his elected family God is not a just God if he doesn't give every man at least an opportunity now God can predestinate by his foreknowledge because he knows who will and who won't but we realize that election goes even Beyond his foreknowledge it's just not a matter of him knowing that you won't disbelieve his word for your hour what he knows is really is that you can't you see when you understand election correctly you understand that you're actually a part of God that you're actually the same material that God's made of your life of his life word of his word amen and that is really the security that is the sure thing in God's elected family it's not even you know to the rest of the world they actually have to choose whether to save themselves actually you don't even make a choice you have to accept God's choice you have to be born again and God will will will follow you around and conk you on the head and and he'll trip you and and push you into Briars and push you into campfires and push you over a cliff if he has to but he will get you because you're his and he won't lose anything of himself you see but so you do have to accept it but God knows you will and you are elected with your names put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jesus said concerning that group you have not chosen me I have chosen you so this becomes a short thing and when brother Branham is going down in the book of in the in the Book of Revelation and he talks about you know the millions I mean the Book of Revelation makes it clear you've got you know we're north of seven and a half billion humans in the world and you've got a Bible prophecy showing us and teaching us very clearly that only a sliver of humanity will escape it so you got seven and a half more than seven and a half billion billion people and only a sliver of humanity are gonna Escape that because as I've said there's no way out but up and so we have been already called up into a higher opening of the word we've already been called up into a new and living day so I'm going to tell you something friends when that Rapture comes it's going to be a very short step for you you just believe that it's going to be a short step to the body change I'm gonna get up like I do every day as serving God you're going to get up every day like you do being a Christian and you're going to be thinking about thoughts that a Christian has and one and suddenly you're going to turn around brother random said you have a funny little feeling maybe like a little pain and that's the last pain you'll ever feel in your life you'll turn around and they'll stand those loved ones who've gone on ahead of you oh friends I'm pretty sure I won't need to use WhatsApp to let everybody know oh man I believe I can just shout into the atmospheres and hear all y'all shouting back yeah they're at our house too oh my what an hour but brother Branham comes back you know to realities of all of the billions that perish because they refused God's mercy God didn't force them to go there God never sent anybody to Hell who don't want to go there he doesn't he tries to keep everybody from going there hell wasn't even made for humans so he tries to heal brother and said if you go to hell you'll fight every step of the way he'll put every barricade he can God loves life his throne is established in Mercy he's not some troll under a bridge you're waiting to take revenge on all the people who rejected him he already died for people who rejected him people who murdered him he asked God to forgive them in their blindness so you're not going to impugn God as some evil monster but yet the reality is and it's heartbreaking to God and it's heartbreaking to us and brother Branham talks about the millions that'll die in an atomic Inferno and brother Branham it broke his heart his languages he said and he he includes all of us he said now that makes our heart bleed but the reality is if it went on another thousand years he says there wouldn't be one more name added to that book see and so you know you can you can open up a calendar I was showing somebody just the other day you can take a calendar and and you can you can click it open and when you're let me let me just do a quick demonstration show you the demonstration I was talking to somebody and I said okay so here here's a calendar with all of these dates and I mean here we go now I don't know where it is but there's a date in here that God has the Rapture is happening it's not a metaphor it's it's a date now I might have just skimmed over it not even knowing I might just go like that and the Lord would have went you just passed it I might be over here now you even when even when we're gone these dates are still going to be valid because the time's still going to carry right on and I mean I mean listen friends if you think about it for a second here here I'm already in 2024 and I can just keep going now I'm in 2025 and I can just keep going I'm in 2026 27 28 29. do you realize that that 2034 I mean think about it friends if if we if we today go in the Rapture at 2022 then 2034 you'll only be a couple hundred years past the millennium I mean I mean I I I'm sorry actually I'm thinking wrong I I we you have to go to all the way to 30 22. so I will be alive in the 24th century the 27th century the 28th and a half century time is still going to go on you're not going to die we which are alive and remain are going to be changed and caught up with the Lord and I will be alive on the earth in the year 27 15. yeah sure so you know the I I do that demonstration just to make the point that the Rapture is a real thing and and and so now we come down to our life here because while we're here then what's this life all about I'd say as I've said many times this life is not really so much about this when it's about the next one which is to say this life is preparing you for that one this life is a proving field training grounds amen and so you know brother Branham talks about the history of humanity coming down through brother Branham always when you go into various sermons one style that he loved to do and he's brilliant at it is going back and picking up Old Testament characters and bringing The Narrative of their life in in a thrilling sermon and I mean brother Branham had such an ability to go back and pick up somebody and just I mean in the next minute you're there you're just there you're just like wow and here you know brother Branham says it you know it must have been a a hot day when Amos topped the Hillside and he looked down and said as the sun beat on his head and his eyes narrowed as he looked at the sin of Jerusalem I see myself there wow I'm pulled right in that's a good Storyteller is Master at it so brother Branham would often times now but when you when you think about that there there's more rhyme and reason to that than just telling a good story because Paul didn't say they're good stories Paul said they're they're examples so an example is an example of something so this is an example of something coming and when it comes you're going to go back to the example and look at the example and then you'll understand when it becomes a greater reality and so that's why brother Brandon would use the illustration he said I could take my hand and put it against a wall and and and it and it's it it's not very defined but as it gets closer and closer it gets sharper and sharper but that's just the shadow it's not actually the positive and my hand is the positive so all the Old Testament was a shadow prophets priests Kings they all foreshadowed Jesus Christ you understand but they also but then when you realize that Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ isn't the only Christ in the godhead when you realize that his body his church his bride is a part of him and part of that great Eternal being then you realize that all of those Shadows are for me as well those Shadows spoke of something that I'm that I can relate to today the Bible is filled with the miraculous and uh and I'm taking this title tonight a sure thing and I I want you to understand tonight friends that the promises of God to his family are a sure thing and as brother Brandon was saying it makes our heart bleed but you know he said he goes on to say there he says really the only thing you can do is just be glad you see it and I'm I'm sorry that I can't prevent seven and a half billion people from rejecting it it's me to know that I have friends in in the world and then community and neighbors and business associates and unless they come the way that I have come they'll never they're going to end up there and not that that just that hurts my heart but but uh but I can't stop it as much as I regretted and God regrets it but God can't stop it either because that would deny people's free moral agency so he pleads with them and pleads with them and brother Branham says he sends preachers and gifts and wonders and signs and miracles and the power of the Holy Ghost and he's got a he's got a church and a bride in the last day moving throughout our communities being a light to say hey there's another way there's another way there's another way and I it's bad as it pains my heart that I can't I know ultimately I can't prevent seven and a half billion people but I can be very glad I see it I can be very glad I believe it and I'm determined to believe it I'm determined to believe it even more tonight it has a supernatural element that can do anything for your good God has thought of and God desires it's very clear in the scripture by all the examples and just the very fact that God intervenes to help his family with the miraculous with the supernatural brother Branham in the message hearing receiving and acting and I preached this hearing recognizing and acting at his Tabernacle about four months prior to this and but and of course recognizing he changes it here to hearing receiving because you know recognizing and then acting when you act when you hear receive and act upon it then then it recognizing becomes obvious it's obvious you recognized it so it becomes obvious in the action you take so he says here that there's talks about starts talking about delivering power now this this catches my attention because I'm not perfect yet I know that shocks y'all no for real I'm not no I'm not kidding no I'm really not I'm really not amen sorry sweetheart but I'm just not you doing here but I want to be I mean we I want to be like Jesus I'm a Christian say why do you want to be like this I'm a Christian he lives inside me I can feel something inside me trying to be a different part a different me and I and me desires that I desire that me to be me oh my it's hard to put into words isn't it but we all get it as I'm describing it to you you're getting it you're a Believer you're a Christian you know the battles we face and we want to be Overcomers and and brother Branham is bringing a sermon to show you this is how you become an overcomer it's a formula that's a sure thing you hear you receive it you you act upon it which means you recognized it now recognizing it is not just meaning that I recognize it as the word of God but I recognize that it's mine I recognize it's for me and if nobody else wants it I want it and if nobody else gets it I'm gonna get it and if nobody goes in a Rapture I'm going rapture so I recognize there's something to begot and I recognize there's something I want to get and so the the formula is very simple much like Peter's formula was simple it wasn't complicated for the Holy Ghost baptism which is the new birth they said what must we do these men were this wasn't a willy-nilly question these men were desperate Peter in a in one sermon in one sermon Peter had taken all their ideology of their entire life and all everything they'd trusted in Traditions and Bloated pieces and everything that these devout Jews had believed all their life since a child Peter with one indictment sermon had pulled the wool had pulled the rug out from underneath them and they realized we are lost they are realizing what Paul would later say that just because I'm I that's just because I've got the genetics back to Abraham now I'm realizing my goodness all of these abrahamic gened people killed the Messiah some suddenly imagine the The Epiphany that they had imagine the paradigm shift in their mind everything I've trusted in I'm I'm I'm not even secured in the Kingdom this isn't a small thing they're coming to Peter what must we do repent right but but I mean what must we do repent that's it yes touch it yes that's too easy it's not as easy as you think because you you got to face that man in the mirror you say well I repented well did you really did you really because repent means to take everything about you that ever was and ever in every plane of reality and throw that aside and make a complete turn completely totally and say I'm going this way now and this is why people repent at an altar and all they do is get some forgiveness for their past sins but they never really fully totally completely surrender in Repentance and when they don't do that the Holy Ghost doesn't come that Gene of God though it may be sitting there will not come to life until you have repented until you have so thoroughly surrendered you and given up your whole life that there's no way God will not seal a person into into that position without the without a full unfettered uh you know unmitigated no parameters no no holds no deals no ifs maybes it's a complete total repentance I don't want to be me anymore I want to be him and I am completely giving my whole life to him today and and then your first Act of obedience is to go to the water that's just a public demonstration you're trying to say to the world I have thoroughly repented I'm not the same man I used to be and that's the one the Holy Ghost will come in and change you and you'll never be the same person again because why you heard and you received and you acted upon the word of God and so people would come brother Branham speaking in the third person would say now you say but brother Branham I just can't throw these cigarettes down he says no you just haven't got the right remedy yet see you haven't got the care of it yet you just you just get the holy spirit in there and see how you can do it then picks up the old Shepherd in the Old Testament how he had a script bag and when he had a a lamb who was sick and if he can if he can get he's got a limestone over here that that line will bring healing into into the stomach of the Lamb he's all sick and throwing up and won't eat so the shepherd needs to get him to lick on the Limestone well he won't do that because Line's nasty and so what he'll do is he'll reach in his script bag and pull out some honey and smear it on the lime now the Sheep will go there immediately and start licking on that honey and what will happen is he'll be licking and licking and licking and his tongue will go numb and he'll go right into the lime and never know and end up healed and so brother Branham says I've got a whole script back here talking about Honey in the Rock my brother full of it and I'm going to put this honey here on the Rock and the rock is Christ Jesus not on something else but on Christ Jesus and you sick sheep go to licking I'm telling you watch this while you are licking on the honey raise up your hands and praise him that's the way you do it and in there you'll get some of the Limestone you'll get some of God's healing virtues and the beauty of it is the type isn't just for physical sickness it works the same way you'll get some of your sins forgiven not some but all of them and you get the Holy Spirit baptism so that's why we bring you to church and that's why we preach this is Honey in the Rock and as you hear it and you receive it and you act upon it and you end up healed you end up born again you end up full of the Holy Ghost oh what a plan friends and it's it's to one come one come all Hallelujah he says while you're licking on that honey something will happen to you this is why the best thing from somebody once the white brother Brandon answer the question the way he did how do we get closer to God read your Bible and pray because what are you doing you're looking on the honey see he says what will it do it'll separate you from the things of the world and it'll call them as nothing that you might live for Christ and do for Christ certainly yes sir that is such a statement that it will separate you from the things of the world now I love this and it'll call them as nothing that means that it won't just tell me stop doing that sinful thing and I go oh I better stop it I want to go to hell I want to miss a rapture and you're still just fighting it in your own your own battle you're still just trying to use gritted teeth you're just trying to you're just trying to tough it out you know and that that's not what the Holy Ghost is comes for the Holy Ghost comes to bring you peace that passes understanding peace like a river oh this is what does it do it'll happen something happens down onto you on the inside and those things that used to have such an appeal to you supernaturally mean nothing they mean nothing anymore I can stand here today how many believers who have been born again the spirit can say I used to I can't believe I used to go after those things they mean nothing to me now nothing I wouldn't do it for money it means nothing to me now why because I found out it was wrong no because my nature got changed and now my nature loves this my my nature and that that's the whole battle because this flesh will sometimes stumble and trip and and and then I've got a big old war and a fight and I gotta track him down to his knees get on your knees boy no I I like what he'll know you don't get on your knees boy oh it's church night we're going to church no I don't want to go you're going to church Hallelujah you're going to read your Bible you're going to pray because that's me taking over Hallelujah I'm hearing I'm recognizing I'm acting upon it see man and Brethren what can we do this was the question they asked Peter repent every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins and you shall not maybe shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost brother Brandon says it like this I see a church speaking in tongues she shouting praising God prophesying and doing great Miracles and signs I look down the scripture it's a promise then I heard I recognized and I went into action he says amen I've been in action now for 31 years oh let me tell you something brother I see a church full of the power of God I see a church living righteously I see a church making it into a Rapture how do you see that brother Jason because I see the promise of God's word and I see people who have heard and they're received and they're acting upon the promise of God see it put me in action I've been in action for 31 years it put me in action that's what the Holy Spirit does you don't say you don't say what will I have to do I love these two words are so Grand in in in the implication of what they're suggesting it's so beyond belief that I stand here tonight so thankful that a prophet said it because it's a sure thing you don't you don't say what will I have to do just surrender [Laughter] he'll take care of the rest of it brother Branham said once that one when that Revelation struck him what do I have to do Just Surrender he'll take care of the rest of it brother Ram says I got in action who wouldn't get in action friends to be able to give you this message tonight to tell you you can be healed of any affliction you can be delivered of any any weakness you can overcome any oppressiveness you can overcome the age you can overcome depression and fear and anxiety you can overcome bitterness and hatred Envy jealousy lust all of these things all of these things that are not going into the kingdom of heaven where the the Paul has a long list of things that are not going to be there it's one of the most forgotten passages in the Bible and ever ever Hollywood died that star that dies they put him in heaven and I'm going have you never read that there's no to this and know this and know this and know this and know this will ever be there and he was every bit of that she did that and plus a bunch of other stuff and you've got her in heaven you've got him in heaven are you kidding me uh if If Heaven's going to be full of Sinners I don't even I'm not sure how you want to go I'm trying to get out of here to be where there aren't any I'm trying to go to a land where everybody loves God for everything is peaceful everything is righteous who everything is Holy where there is no hatred or lustful ways or sinful or or adultery or idolatry or or our revenge or war or famine I want to go to a place where God is King Hallelujah he starts talking about Moses here's where's here here he goes brother ran him into his Old Testament stories an old man 80 years old Whiskers hanging down his face hanging down like this maybe the hair is hanging over his shoulder and his wife set in straddle a little mule kid Under Armor baby and here he is an old crooked sticking his hand 80 year old man I got an old man with an old wife and an old mule and an old stick and he says just a hobbling he can't walk straight anymore just hobbling along some of the herders say where are you going Moses oh I'm going down to Egypt to take over you know what that that's a laugh line we laugh at that because that's funny that let me give you brother Brandon's word that's ridiculous to the carnal mind see it's hilarious to humans brother Branham compared he says can you imagine saying I'm going to go I'm going to take my wife and a mule and a stick and a baby and I'm gonna go take over Russia and tell Putin get out I'm in charge uh you wouldn't get out of your county before they had you locked up see you're going insane and he says we're going Moses I'm going down to take over how ridiculous to the carnal mind they say poor old Moses I guess the sun got too hot for him brother Ryan says no he said the he said I don't know what I don't know what the s-u-n did he said but one thing that happened is he got in the presence of the son and he said that got really hot and so no wonder the world thought he was crazy he hadn't been in the Su in too long he'd been in the in too long Hallelujah I love brother Richie told his former Pastor when he tried to when he jumped ship from the message and tried to take brother Richie with him and and brother Richie just looked him straight in the iron been his Pastor for all of his life and said buddy you left me in the sun too long I said I've been laying in the presence of the son all these years and I'm sorry you can go ahead to Perdition if you want to but I'm going to go all the way I'm going while I'm staying with the word you left me in the sun too long my so he says he goes he says so he says the pillar fired a burning bush see and that Pillar of Fire you know before Abraham was I am and the pillar of fire you know who shall I who shall I say sent me tell them I am hath sent you which was I preached on that before that you've always got to see where the I am is because it's it's always going to be God in a manifestation of of Flesh so you see where the I am is no matter who's who whatever prophets on the scene that's the I am because that's the word of God coming through him so Moses just go tell him you're me see and then and then don't worry that's going to sound ridiculous but then you'll cast down your stick and it'll turn to a snake and they know I'm the one that can do that and then you'll put your hand in here and bring it out it's leprosy lepers you put it back in it's clean they'll know I'm in you they'll know that you're speaking on my behalf they'll know that when they when they're hearing you they're hearing me oh Hallelujah friends that's why I'm glad for a prophet who brought a Supernatural Ministry and did things that only God could do because why it tells me this is a sure thing Hallelujah you see it's when you when you realize that coming from Genesis you you it's almost like there's a tunnel if I could try to picture this you can just follow me if I can just make it into into a description you know if you if you could look down this law this big tunnel and just look all the way back to Genesis and all down through the tunnel you would see people sticking their head in and waving at you and there would be Jonah here it'd be you know here be David and back here it'd be you know here's Joshua and way back here is Moses and keep on going back you're looking well back and way back there's Abraham going hey hey you know and then Abraham move left who's that oh it's Enoch oh wow see Enoch step to the right who oh it's able you'd be seeing all the way back to Genesis and you'd be seeing all the family of God and and the beauty of it is that that that that that every one of them was carrying forth the the plan to restore what fell because when God slew a lamb that was the beginning of the restoration and it was just simple and Abel caught a revelation I need to kill a lamb kill an animal and put him on an altar that's really all he understood he understood that it's going to take blood see and so from there it goes on and goes on and God adds on and adds on finally by the time you get to Enoch now Enoch's not bringing a lamb to an altar Enoch's building a giant monstrosity he's building this massive pyramid to that to this day they call the Great Pyramid because he's building a revelation you're you're seeing a manifestation of of a restoration this is this from in Seven Generations because seven is completion you'll you'll see seven blocks of seven it's like seven Church ages you can fit those in blocks of seven all the way back through the Old Testament makes a beautiful study but you can see from that by the time it gets to comes to Enoch now he's the seventh from Adam and so you're you're seeing a building blocks of Revelation Revelation revelation and then and then when and then when it all recycles under Noah and then what happens it starts over with Abraham and Noah comes out he's got a covenant and then it and then it's it's going to go and go and go and finally God's Gonna reach and find a heathen worshiper born in a heathen family with Heathen parents and Heathen customs and he's going to say Abram follow me where are we going just follow me and I'm just going to show you just going to leave everything behind and before Abraham there's no Jews Abraham is the first Jew you understand so so he's going to follow left his home not even knowing where he was going but God was going to lead him all the way and so so what you're seeing is that at every step this tunnel back to Genesis that God is showing the elements of the Genesis life when it was in force he's showing all through the Old Testament I I really got to labor on this for a minute because I'm going to give you some examples he's showing that in all of these stories that God is for foreshadowing that eventually when I get all the way to the end it's going to bring you back to the beginning and the Millennium is the seventh day never got finished so in the circle of things I I started here and the whole thing is just a big circle to bring us back to that seventh day and thusly everything you see through the Old Testament is is snapshots of the kind of power that was here and will be again amen and that that kind of power that was there is accessible to you here oh my see and so so I mean people resist Divine Healing and Supernatural power And yet when I look back in Genesis I mean healing Supernatural power huh Adam had control of nature yeah Adam could just speak and change the direction of the wind raise it or lower its temperature Adam could do landscaping by his words he could say 3 6 9 11 17 and no 20 okay I want all of y'all over here tree 14 3 and 2 and 7. I want you all back over here on here and I need this mound to kind of level out push back up over here and I need a big Mount here with a waterfall coming down through here what are you doing Adam I'm building Eve a little garden here I love her and and and and I want her to have a nice place and I'm going to build it just for her and God walked with this man and visited him every day in the cool of the day and God came down and they spoke lip to ear face to face this is what we're headed back to so would you just remember everything you're seeing in the Old Testament and in Christ and in the early church is all it's all Snippets of that life and it's it's it's just stretching it out over 6 000 years to bring it all back and Heap it all up all the way in the Millennium when it's completely restored so so so when we when we see Adam in control of nature see and so I I mean I I just say to myself thank God because if there's a power that can control this nature oh my I'm not worried about moving the wind or replanting a tree I'll get a tractor but I would very much like to control this nature I would very much like to have access to that kind of power amen and so we see these preacts these these these preacts of demonstration all through the Old Testament now let me catch something for you watch I'm just going to go down this list very quickly everything that you're reading here these are miracles that took place in the Old Testament all right so if we go all the way back to Exodus 7 we'll begin we find that water is made blood we find did you know that could happen water is turned into blood frogs are produced out of thin air they're spoken into creation so are lice sow our flies boils Thunder locusts Darkness death of the firstborn this is all the power of God demonstrating itself this is all the kind of power that that God has intended for his family to not only wield but to be in perfect control of death of the first form the Red Sea Mara's waters are sweetened Manna is sent water from the rock of her Freedom Aaron's Rod is budding nadab and abihu are consumed the burning of tibera earthquake and fire water flowing from The Rock serpent healing the Israelites a serpent on a pole I mean that this is these are acts of God that term that even insurance companies use today is well earned it's an act of God see and so we find that water is Flowing from Iraq a serpent on a pole is healing people's bodies balen's eyes is speaking the River Jordan is divided the walls of Jericho fall down the Sun and the Moon stand still water flows from a rock these are Genesis powers Unleashed this is God this is this is brother Brandon would say all the lives of all the people was all one goal that God had in his mind of expression and it was God expressing it wasn't it wasn't just you say well these were situations that arose and so God came in on the rescue don't be so sure that a lot of it wasn't God setting things up I'm here to tell you something friends I've had God work in my life and put me in a situation and then bring it around and bring a miracle and I come out and and I'm thanking God and I'm thinking Lord did you set me up just so that could happen they here's a man sick in the days of Jesus and they said who sinned in this case his which parents sin he's Jesus said nobody this was only done so that God could get Glory now I'm going to go I'm getting ready to go to work see and so I mean and that's just powers of of God moving in nature the Philistines are strained before the ark the men of Beth Shemesh are smitten Thunder have you ever read in first Samuel the Philistines here is Samuel trying to hold a church service and he's offering a sacrifice and right when when when he's in church the Philistines come trying to kill everybody and there's not even enough time to Marshal the army they don't need it the Bible said God thundered from heaven and smote them broke them to pieces with just Thunder you're talking about a shock wave can you imagine I've had thunder so loud I jumped off the ground but I've never seen Thunder that smashed men's bones and bursted uh uh their bodies but literally Thunder destroys a Philistine Army go over read it in first Samuel chapter seven thunder and rain in the Harvest the sound and the mulberry trees I love that story so David you're gonna go kill the people you're going to kill the enemy okay to what I do okay go go in the field and lay down and hide well I don't sound like I'm gonna kill anybody it's okay just pay attention I just need your whole Army just to lay down in the in the High Grass near the mulberry trees okay Lord this doesn't really sound like something Cicero would do this is what kind of battle plan is this and the Lord said here's what's going to do David you're going to get your whole Army it's going to lay down be quiet and when the enemy comes out he said wait until you hear the sound of Marching In the tops of the trees and you'll know that me and my Army have went out ahead of you just fall in behind that's all you got to do when I do that just fall in and by the time they fall in and get there the Army's already slaughtered can you imagine being the army that got slaughtered By Angels this is God demonstrating Genesis life do you understand what the Holy Ghost is it's to bring that's why brother Branham said I see a church with power and tongues and prophecy I see Overcomers I see Victory I see young people follow the Holy Ghost why because it's Genesis this word is taking us back to that it's not just happenstance it's not just God being a faithful friend this is a you're part of a grand scheme a grand plan the Plan of Redemption would blow your mind thunder sound in the mulberry trees Uzziah struck Dead jeroboam's Hand is wither the winner of seraphats has meal reproduced say Those Old Testament days were something right where I was in India with brother James walls he went to a sister and preached in her in a church in India and and uh he preached on this Widow who had her meal multiplied in her oil and when he was done preaching a woman come forward to get the pastor to say I'm the Widow she never know the stories in the Bible she said I'm the Widow and the Pastor said we all know your widow's sister we're praying for you God will send you perhaps another husband she says no no no no no she said this man preached my life he said what do you mean she said at my home I have no money I have nothing and me and my child but every day I go to my flower and my meal and it's full to the top and I scoop out and scoop out and make us food and I close it back and I get oil and dip it out and cook our food and the next day it's all full again she was the woman in the Bible in the 20th 21st century you think that's a myth that's a true story they went and interviewed her and took her picture brother James told me said brother Jason he said I wanted to see it with my own eyes he said I he said we arranged he said come to my house I'll fix everybody a meal he said sister your Widow you have nothing she said don't worry God is feeding us and they get to her little bitty her little bitty Shack and I've been in some of them and the pastor brother James he's a big old boy he could eat and he's there and the pastor's there and a bunch of other people and she just she goes over and opens up her meal Cooks all kinds of cakes and oil and makes it all up and feeds him brother James said we ate too we were busting and he said I'm sitting there and there's the meal right on the counter nobody's touching it he said I watched her dip out of it and dip out of it and dip out of it and scoop out of it and scoop out of it and he said when it got done he said I walked over and I took the lid off of the tin again he said brother Jason the manufacturers uh print was in the top of the of the meal he said it pushed it up and and tattooed it and he said I opened the oil and it was about you couldn't move it because it would spill over he said while we were sitting there feeding our faces Angels were just walking over and dumping more in I'm here to tell you you're serving the god of Genesis power you're not in this thing by accident this is for Real the sacrifice is consumed rain is obtained the highs as captains are consumed River Jordan is divided Waters of Jericho are healed water water for Josh the Fat's Army The Widow's oil multiplied shunamite's son is raised from the dead the deadly pottage is cured hundred men fed with 20 loaves naming Curative leprosy leprosy inflicted on geeza iron swims did you know an ax head could swim king of Syria's Army is smitten Elisha's bones revive the dead Santa crab's Army is destroyed the Sun goes backwards Uzziah struck with Leprosy Shadrach Meshach and abednegar delivered from the Flames Daniel and the Lion's Den Jonah in the whale's belly oh as Paul said what can I say more for time would fail me to tell him Gideon and a parrot and of Samson and of jephthah and of David also in Samson and all the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms who brought righteousness who obtained promises Hallelujah women had their dead reached back this is your life this is what God has called us to we're not we're not weaklings we're not left defenseless in this world Genesis is returning no wonder we see tongues and prophecy and power and miracles taking place and God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect that 40th verse clearly meant that the things were not finished happening those he Paul said he goes down this whole list this and this and this and this and this and yet all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect it clearly means that they're not finished they're not going to be made perfect until it was happening in the church and the early church isn't going to be made perfect until it's happening in you until it's happening in me that's why the Rapture is such a momentous it's all the ages all coming to Perfection now think of the privilege that you have you are your life of overcoming you hearing recognizing and being willing to act upon the word of God is going to raise the sleeping Saints from the grave oh my we see Abel with his ability to hear and recognize and to act on the revealed word so that that's that's something that started and it has to finish trying to skip some things and go down told more I was going to preach 25 minutes it's probably gonna laugh at me when I get home Abel started with a lamb God coming all the way from Abel's lamb to the time of Abraham's day and you went from a lamb to God standing in a human form you see the progress and that foretold Christ's first coming and his second coming again that as it was in in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah and brother Branham goes back to Abraham on the mountain he's not down there with lot because why he heard he recognized he acted on the word of God he stayed separate and now God is visiting him and listen friends when you look at it like this way when I when I started to view this today and I started thinking about it and I thought you know here here God is coming standing in a human form and he's got a further demonstration now of Genesis life that Adam enjoyed even even to Creation power now is is is to provide a sacrifice because Abraham doesn't have a sacrifice it's going to take creation power to create one and when you realize that's what we're going to have to have is creation power now we all fall back and go man I ain't hardly got enough power to cure a headache how am I going to change my mortal flesh remember friends God created the lamb God created that RAM on the Mountaintop so when you think about it three things happened in Rapid succession God made the call God issued the requirement and then God provided the solution to his own demand Hallelujah God made the call to him God issued the requirement and then God provided the solution to his own demand so when we read that 16th verse of our Tech our opening text so that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but God that showeth Mercy you see Abraham's part was only Abraham's part your part was only to hear and to recognize and to act upon it Abraham heard it Abraham saddled it up Abraham acted upon the promise of God he stumbled in weakness Abraham had weaknesses Abraham Baxley went off down to Egypt run from Hard Times see he stumbled in human weakness yes but his faith never staggered at the promise you know why and how I know that because he kept going and that's really what it is to us friends we keep going we stumble Abraham stumbled he stumbled again he stumbled again he stumbled down in Egypt he stumbled to the Philistine King he's still stumbling but yet he's also still going he stumbled again and he kept going again how many here today can say I'm a true son of Abraham I stumbled and then I stumbled again but I'm going again but then I stumbled again now what are you going to do I'm gonna go again well then what I'm gonna go again and again and again Hallelujah so so the thing that slaps the Devil's face in the end friends is when you when you think about it like this that that all of that failure and success and failure and success and repenting and keep going all of that had one accomplishment it put Abraham in the tent door and the plains of mammary when the when God came and visited him to confirm a promise I'm here to tell you yes I got ups and downs yes I got weaknesses but I've heard I've recognized I'm acting on the word of God I'm going to keep going forward and you say my life has been this and my life has been that and I've had this failure all I can tell you is all of that put you here right now in this service and you have the opportunity to slap the devil's face and say no matter what it's been I have heard and I have recognized nice to act upon the word of God this is the privilege of the redeemed you have the it's handed to you listen to what he did the Lord appeared to him in the plains of memories he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day he lifted up his eyes and looked and three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door he ran you know what he did bowed himself toward the ground every excuse and every success and every failure and every promise and every repentance brought him to that moment and what was his response to all of it surrender he bowed himself to the ground that's where you need to be at this evening bow yourself to the ground because that's what a prophet said what can I do surrender what can I do brother Jason surrender her oh friends let's stand to our feet this evening I don't want to go any further I've got more notes but I feel the unction of the holy spirit this is a moment where the Holy Spirit can just sweep down over an audience I'm here to tell you something friends you have you have heard you have recognized and you have acted upon the word of God come musicians Cumberland Anthony this is what it this is what it all comes down to is to be able to to be able to surrender brother Brandon makes an interesting statement I'm going to read this last thing as they play at their choosing just something soft and appropriate now listen to your prophet because now it's really gonna what this next few lines here this thing's really going to turn northward and come home all right this is going to come right to your heart he says God gives a promise and when his Spirit comes it fulfills that promise first thing you hear it preached it's what you did tonight then you recognize that that's God's truth now how many recognize tonight what you heard how many have proven that it's God's truth then you go into action see look at that one-man invasion of Moses down into Egypt seemed impossible didn't it because really the bottom line is there's times where we come to our life and and you might be there tonight I certainly know I've been where I'm about to describe where something has a grip on you but you don't want it to because you want to serve God anything from a debilitating physical fitness sickness to a debilitating spiritual sickness where the devil has got something on you and you want free and you fight it and you fight it don't remember that remember the man came oh brother Brandon if I could just quit these cigarettes if I could just quit sinning brother Brown says no you just ain't found the right thing yet you just ain't found the right remedy yet see he says Moses this was totally impossible but the strange part of it is he did it and you can do it said why how did he do it why he heard the right voice he recognized and he obeyed and you say now what's brother Brian I'm here I'm reading these last quotes this this is I'm getting ready to read you the statement that inspired this whole sermon tonight you say I can't do it you should go and listen to this sermon in June of 1960. hearing and not recognizing but receiving hearing receiving and acting and brother Branham screams it out yes you can you say I can't do it yes you can Obama didn't invent that the prophet invented that yes you can if God speaks to you recognize it to be his promise go into action and see what God does we'll take over the crippled says I can't walk yes you can Jesus said so amen that's right whatever things you desire pray and believe you shall have them maybe the man's got cancer says I can't live yes you can God said so Moses she's going down to take over Egypt why it's impossibility but he said but I'm going to do it anyhow I want to take some friends you think Moses didn't stop along the way and think about that murdered Egyptian he buried in the sand you think he did he didn't think about I mean God even knew in advance he would Smite The Rock twice God even knows I've got failures yet I'll make but he still calls me he still calls me and in spite of my past in spite of weaknesses I might have tomorrow I'm here to tell you say I can't get free yes you can I almost called this sermon tonight yes you can I could hear it for days I've been going around I hear that I hear the prophets in my mind I can hear his voice yes you can he's so positive he's so sure I'm here to tell you if you've heard the word and you've recognized the word and you're acting upon the word you just here recognize and act and brother Branham said see what happens see what God does God will come and do more than you can think to ask so it can't be healed yes you can I can't go free yes you can I can't get over yes you can yes you can because it's God's promised word in this hour sometimes we don't want to even sometimes we you know Spurgeon talks about people who gather the most manna he says he who chooses to gather much Mana will find that he may have as much as he desires friends let me tell you something don't leave when I when I was in marketing one of the things they always taught me don't leave money on the table somebody needs to leave with it you're the customer but don't leave it on the table don't leave money on the table tonight God has offered you complete healing how many in here might need healing of anything I don't care what it is you got a physical need how many how many how many and I'll say Amen to this how many got things in their life say I have fought and I and I don't always have perfect Victory but I want to have perfect Victory I just know I'm not sure I can yes you can I've been sick for so long I'm not sure I can be healed yes you can I I wanna I wanna have Supernatural power to have Supernatural Faith but I but I don't know if I can have it yes you can you can have it because you've heard and you've received and you're now ready to act upon the word of God oh let's bow our heads all over the building father tonight Lord I thank you Father for letting me get through this it so Thrills me when I think about it Lord I went all week just proving it to myself proving it to myself over and over and over and over again oh Lamb of God I already see Supernatural power since I heard the prophet say this and it rings in my mind I've already begun to see my whole life my whole success my physical needs my spiritual needs lord they're all coming up and Higher and Higher and Higher it's Genesis power moving oh God I pray that you'll let the people believe it tonight let them believe it all over the building Lord you confirm your word now deliver Lord their sickness hands went up there's needs spiritual needs hands went up everywhere we're believing tonight Lord God I want the people I want these young people to go away from here tonight these older people to go away from here tonight and to realize yes I can yes I can be free I can be healed I can have Victory I can see the supernatural it doesn't matter how bad the problem is God can fix it I've heard I've recognized and I am acting upon the word of God now Holy Spirit your Prophet gave us a sure thing a sure thing tonight that if we would but here receive and be willing to act upon it in faith and go forward claiming Victory speaking Victory believing Victory seeing victory in our minds High refusing all other and refusing anything contrary to the vision of perfection if we'll go forward acting on faith then you'll bring it to pass Abraham couldn't couldn't bring that Ram you had to do that Abram There Was You made a You made a requirement Abraham couldn't even keep he had even no ability to do it but you knew you would do it you issued the call you made the requirement and you met your own demand I raised up both my hands tonight Lord I accept it I accept it tonight I accept total Deliverance I accept total healing I accept total Victory I accept Lord the the total power and control of the Holy Ghost over my entire life Lord God May every person in here tonight Eric listening on the airwaves Lord may they raise up
