[0:01] lines and we process thoughts within our
[0:04] minds so the Battleground is our thought
[0:07] process
[0:08] so what lays in your thought process
[0:10] this morning
[0:11] amen what things are you thinking about
[0:13] you know we have we have the pressures
[0:15] of Life we've got to think about what
[0:17] we're gonna you know you know what we're
[0:19] gonna eat later we've got to think about
[0:20] you know our job next week we've got to
[0:22] think on those things but when we come
[0:24] through those doors you know just on a
[0:26] Sunday or a Wednesday you know are we
[0:28] entering into an atmosphere or our minds
[0:31] still so fixated on the things of the
[0:34] world
[0:35] and not on the things of God that we
[0:37] can't even get anything from
[0:40] the word
[0:43] I heard a message not too long ago and
[0:46] it just really opened my eyes to a
[0:47] different view that I hadn't really
[0:48] noticed before and they were talking
[0:50] about you know you know how the phone is
[0:52] used for you know everything nowadays
[0:54] you know we use it for school we use it
[0:55] for work you know social media WhatsApp
[0:57] Google and none of those things you know
[1:00] as a whole is bad as long as you become
[1:02] masters of it but what happens is you
[1:04] know some of us even use it as our alarm
[1:06] clocks I mean I do
[1:09] um and it's just so the nature of the
[1:10] Beast is is that's the first thing that
[1:12] I look at in the morning because it's
[1:13] what wakes me up and you know we may be
[1:17] we may use it like we have our tablets
[1:19] we may use it to listen to a message we
[1:21] may use it for the Bible but what
[1:23] happens is you know when something pops
[1:25] up we get a text message or you know we
[1:27] have a notification pop up then our
[1:29] thought process begins to think upon the
[1:32] things of that even though like like we
[1:34] were talking about in the scripture that
[1:35] it's not so much unlawful for that but
[1:38] then our mind is now no longer fixated
[1:40] on what God wants us to be fixated on
[1:42] we're thinking about even if it's
[1:44] something so simple as you know your
[1:46] wife asking you to do something or
[1:48] um probably that's a bad example but
[1:52] even if it's so simple as as you know
[1:54] someone just sending you an encouraging
[1:56] text message you know then you're
[1:57] thinking about those and you're thinking
[1:59] about a reply that you want to that you
[2:00] want to make and you're no no longer
[2:02] being able to enter in into what you
[2:04] were doing into the message you were
[2:06] listening to into the Bible verses you
[2:08] were reading
[2:09] maybe even you're praying but in the
[2:11] back of your mind you're still pondering
[2:13] on what you were scrolling through just
[2:16] a few minutes ago
[2:18] and last week we touched on not being
[2:20] ignorant of the devices that Satan uses
[2:23] in our lives you know and many times the
[2:26] devices are just really simply to keep
[2:28] your mind on the things of the world and
[2:30] the things of life and to keep you away
[2:33] from your full potential
[2:35] you know and I asked myself I ask myself
[2:37] this this question and the answer that I
[2:40] got was that I came to was shocking you
[2:43] know how many times have I been praying
[2:46] or have I been reading my Bible even in
[2:49] just the last few weeks and my mind is
[2:52] just completely on something else
[2:54] I mean and we can all ask ourselves that
[2:56] question that's what I want to do this
[2:57] morning we can ask ourselves that
[2:59] question how many times have I been just
[3:01] reading the word and I'm not even paying
[3:03] attention to what I'm reading I'm just
[3:05] having a thought of what else is going
[3:08] on in my life or what this may be a text
[3:10] message or maybe I had scrolled through
[3:12] Facebook or or maybe and like I said
[3:13] those things aren't bad but it's how we
[3:17] control those things is it controlling
[3:19] us or are we controlling it and we can't
[3:21] enter into what God wants for us if
[3:25] we're so thinking on those things
[3:29] and I was just I was shocked when I came
[3:31] to that answer because it's multiple
[3:33] times you know I've just been praying
[3:34] and you know even trying to enter in in
[3:36] prayer and just
[3:38] the thoughts of life just coming
[3:42] amen
[3:44] it really hinders one of your greatest
[3:47] weapons that you have talking on prayer
[3:49] this morning it can really overcome
[3:52] every aspect of your prayer lives if you
[3:56] aren't as Ephesians 6 says praying with
[3:59] all prayer and supplication in the
[4:02] spirit
[4:03] amen the scripture teaches us we need to
[4:05] pray in the spirit and watch there unto
[4:08] it says with all perseverance and
[4:10] supplication for All Saints and I really
[4:13] like how the Amplified Bible puts it it
[4:16] says that with all prayer and petition
[4:18] pray with specific requests at all times
[4:20] on occasion and every season in the
[4:22] spirit with this in View and it says to
[4:25] stay alert with all perseverance and
[4:28] petition interceding in prayer for all
[4:30] God's people
[4:31] are we staying alert this morning when
[4:34] we're praying are we staying alert and
[4:36] keeping our minds on the things of God
[4:38] when we're trying to enter in to his
[4:40] atmosphere into his presence or are we
[4:42] so thinking on the things of life
[4:45] we need to stay alert Colossians 4 picks
[4:47] up it says in Colossians 4 2 it says be
[4:49] persistent and be devoted to prayer be
[4:53] alert bring being alert and focus in
[4:56] your prayer life with an attitude of
[4:57] Thanksgiving
[4:59] we have that attitude of Thanksgiving
[5:01] and if we can pick up in our Bibles uh
[5:03] in familiar scripture again but first
[5:07] Samuel the first chapter
[5:10] the first chapter first Samuel chapter 1
[5:13] and verse 10. we read of a woman
[5:17] um talking about that Colossians 4 2
[5:19] being persistent and devoted in prayer
[5:21] alert and focus we read of a woman of
[5:23] faith in the Old Testament who sought
[5:25] God through prayer and supplication this
[5:27] is a familiar uh Sunday school teaching
[5:29] on Hannah but
[5:31] um we're just going to read it and she
[5:33] says and she was in bitterness and
[5:36] prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and
[5:38] she vowed a vow and said O Lord of hosts
[5:40] if thou will indeed look on the
[5:42] Affliction of mine handmade and remember
[5:44] and not forget thine handmaid but will
[5:47] give unto thine handmaid a man-child
[5:49] then I will give unto the Lord all the
[5:51] days of his life I will give him unto
[5:53] the Lord all the days of his life and
[5:54] there shall no razor come upon his head
[5:56] and it came to pass as she continued
[5:59] praying before the Lord that Eli marked
[6:01] her mouth
[6:02] now Hannah she spake in her heart only
[6:05] her lips moved but her voice was not
[6:08] heard therefore Eli thought that she had
[6:11] been drunken and Eli said under how long
[6:13] will thou be drunken put away thine wine
[6:15] from me and Hannah answered and said no
[6:17] my Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful
[6:20] spirit
[6:22] I have drunk neither wine nor strong
[6:24] drink but have poured out my soul before
[6:27] the Lord that's the way to pray to pour
[6:29] out your soul before the Lord
[6:31] count not thine handmade for a daughter
[6:33] of Belial for out of the abundance of my
[6:36] complaint and grief have I spoken here
[6:38] hitherto then Eli answered and said go
[6:42] in peace and the god of Israel Grant
[6:44] thee Thy Thy the petition that thou Hast
[6:46] ask of him
[6:48] and she said let thine handmaiden find
[6:50] Grace in thy sight so the women woman
[6:52] went her way and did eat and this is
[6:55] what I want to focus on and her
[6:56] countenance was no more sad
[6:59] her countenance was no more sad that's
[7:01] what prayer is supposed to do you know
[7:03] when you're discouraged you go before
[7:05] the Lord as Sam as um as David did and
[7:08] encouraged himself in the Lord that is
[7:11] something that we all have the the
[7:12] access to the ability to do if we just
[7:15] go before the Lord and he'll be faithful
[7:17] to Remember You
[7:19] and John 14 teaches us that have faith
[7:22] in whatever we ask in the name of the
[7:24] Lord and whatever ye shall ask in my
[7:25] name that will I do that the father may
[7:28] be glorified in the son so when we go to
[7:30] our knees and we pray like Hannah does
[7:33] and travail with great needs and with
[7:35] great supplication we also need to have
[7:38] the expectation that when I stand back
[7:41] up that it's already done
[7:45] and we would we should just use these
[7:47] scriptures use Hannah as an example in
[7:49] our lives that we should go forth we may
[7:52] start with a sad countenance but when we
[7:54] encourage ourselves in the Lord we get
[7:55] on our knees and we pray and we just
[7:57] drown out the things of the world and we
[8:00] just enter into that atmosphere
[8:02] she had confirmation in her heart and
[8:04] she was no longer of a sad countenance
[8:06] that's that's we have access to that
[8:08] this morning and we have access to that
[8:09] anytime we pray anytime we go to the
[8:11] Lord
[8:14] Spurgeon picks uh prayer up and he says
[8:17] he who lives without prayer he who lives
[8:19] with little prayer he who seldom reads
[8:21] the word and he who seldom looks up to
[8:23] heaven for a fresh influence from on
[8:25] high
[8:25] he will be the man whose heart will
[8:27] become dry and barren
[8:30] my goodness I don't want my heart my
[8:32] heart to become dry and Barren however
[8:34] he who falls in secret on his God who
[8:38] spends much time in holy retirement who
[8:42] Delights to meditate on the words of the
[8:44] most high and whose soul is given to
[8:47] Christ such a man must have an
[8:50] overflowing heart as his heart is such
[8:52] will his life be and I was just kind of
[8:55] in fellowship with my dad not too long
[8:57] ago and we're just talking about you
[8:59] know the difference in listening and
[9:01] reading and sometimes sometimes it's
[9:02] better to read because we're able to
[9:04] stop and pause and really think on these
[9:08] things we're able to think on okay my
[9:10] goodness that that's something so
[9:12] beautiful you know and if we're
[9:14] listening and listening is still a great
[9:15] tool that we can use I know that that's
[9:17] sometimes all we can do but if we're
[9:19] reading we can get so much more out of
[9:23] it because we can pause and we can say
[9:25] Lord will you just show me what exactly
[9:27] that means there's so many compound
[9:29] meanings within the scriptures and and
[9:30] Lord just show me what this means and
[9:32] show me how I can apply it to my life
[9:34] and show me these things
[9:35] and the Lord really just been dealing
[9:37] with me on just such a simple and just a
[9:40] basic level just get back to the basics
[9:42] with things Caleb you know in sports
[9:44] when you're young or whatever you know
[9:45] it's all about the fundamentals the key
[9:48] the fundamental uh key to a life hidden
[9:52] in Christ
[9:53] is a tried and true prayer life
[9:57] and I was checked in my heart When I Was
[9:59] preparing for this and I was writing
[10:01] this question out how often
[10:03] do you flee away I'm just asking myself
[10:06] this question if we could just all ask
[10:07] ourselves how often do we flew away from
[10:10] the hustle and the bustle of Life of our
[10:12] phone and of the stress and of the
[10:14] pressures and make time to pray in
[10:16] secret as this passage in Matthew
[10:18] teaches us
[10:20] you know it's just a basic lesson but
[10:22] let's get back to the basics let's get
[10:24] back to the fundamentals of things
[10:25] praying shouldn't just be something we
[10:27] read about in the Bible praying
[10:29] shouldn't be something that we just do
[10:30] in church or that we hear about in
[10:32] church it's got to go further than that
[10:35] if we don't know how to pray you know
[10:38] and that's okay sometimes we don't know
[10:40] how to pray that's that's okay
[10:42] this the prophet of God didn't know how
[10:44] to pray when he first started he picks
[10:47] this up he says did you ever walk like
[10:49] that light-footed why I remember that
[10:51] night I was back
[10:52] when I first got saved and went back
[10:54] into a little old shed I never did pray
[10:56] in my life and I was going to write
[10:58] Jesus a letter and Tack it on a tree so
[11:01] out in the woods so he could find it I
[11:04] didn't know how to pray I thought he'd
[11:05] pass by that tree sometime and let me
[11:07] tell him that letter what a dirty guy
[11:09] was or how low down or how unworthy if
[11:11] he's a man he'd talk like a man so I
[11:13] didn't know how to talk and I just knelt
[11:15] down on an old grass sack and an old wet
[11:17] shed and began to fool with my finger
[11:18] and I said Mr Jesus will you come here
[11:21] just a minute now this is just pouring
[11:22] out his heart this is just simple I I
[11:24] just want to talk to you he says but he
[11:27] come that's the main thing he'll meet
[11:29] you you don't know how to pray just have
[11:31] a sincere heart kneel before the Lord
[11:33] and He will come
[11:34] that's the main thing I think if we
[11:36] would quit rhyming our prayers he says
[11:38] today and trying to tease someone here
[11:39] tease someone's ears and pray from the
[11:42] depths of our heart like an
[11:44] old-fashioned sinner ought to repent
[11:46] then God would hear us amen too much of
[11:48] this put on Pharisee told you the other
[11:50] day Pharisee means an actor too many
[11:53] Pharisees quit putting on I don't like
[11:54] that stuff put on be what you are be
[11:57] original God knows what you are anyhow
[12:00] you're only acting before someone else
[12:02] he knows what you are original
[12:05] even even if you just need to get back
[12:08] to those fundamentals he wants something
[12:10] original he he knows that each of our
[12:12] personalities are different he knows
[12:14] that I don't pray like you do and he
[12:16] knows that you don't pray like he does
[12:17] or she doesn't pray he knows that but we
[12:19] have we enter into a personal
[12:21] relationship with God just like you
[12:22] enter into a personal relationship with
[12:25] with someone you love and you don't just
[12:27] go you know I I don't just go to my wife
[12:29] and tell her what I need every day or
[12:30] she's that wouldn't be any kind of a
[12:32] relationship you know we we commune
[12:34] together we we we walk together we walk
[12:37] this life together and that's the same
[12:39] exact way that he wants to be with us
[12:42] he already knows we read that he already
[12:44] knows what we have need of but it's in
[12:46] those times of secret prayer
[12:48] that he'll meet you and really speak
[12:50] with you
[12:52] we speak a lot and when we pray we're
[12:55] groaning but if we just can enter into
[12:57] that secret place with the Lord then he
[12:59] can begin to speak to us amen I can't
[13:02] remember who was ministering it might
[13:03] have been brother Jason on some number
[13:05] of weeks ago but to have the kind of
[13:07] experience in prayer where the Lord
[13:09] actually communes with us and goes you
[13:12] know like like Moses in the mountain
[13:14] where you know he had this bush and the
[13:17] bush talked back to him you know it was
[13:19] that's the kind of communion that I long
[13:20] for the Lord to just talk back to me
[13:22] amen
[13:24] you know I think we've all been guilty
[13:27] of this a time or two you know that the
[13:29] only prayer that we really offered up to
[13:31] the Lord you know in a day maybe even
[13:33] five minutes I've been guilty I'll just
[13:35] raise my hand if nobody else is just
[13:37] telling him of our needs right and not
[13:40] saying that you shouldn't tell him of
[13:41] your needs but it's got to go further
[13:44] than that amen
[13:47] brother Jason was saying uh last Sunday
[13:49] I believe he's already mindful of all of
[13:51] our needs he's already mindful of your
[13:52] financial needs he's mindful of the
[13:54] pressures of life
[13:56] but what what you really and truly
[13:58] sacrifice your time to the Lord he'll he
[14:00] will meet you in that place and what an
[14:02] honor it is that the Creator
[14:05] of Heaven and Earth would meet you in a
[14:08] secret place and would commune with you
[14:10] what a beautiful picture that is amen
[14:15] and as that quote was saying when we
[14:16] begin to think on those things and we
[14:18] get to really get our minds off of the
[14:20] world and just setting our phones down
[14:22] or setting setting our life down and
[14:25] just entering into that prayer what a
[14:27] what a time I don't want to be
[14:29] complacent in my prayer life uh you know
[14:34] we're we are like I said at the
[14:35] beginning we're fighting a battle and we
[14:37] need to be engaged in it complacency is
[14:39] finding yourself in a place where you're
[14:41] not engaged in it you're you're there
[14:43] you're just there I don't want to just
[14:44] be here I want to be engaged in the
[14:47] battle
[14:48] we can't we can't sit back with Idle
[14:50] Hands and like Matthew saying and let
[14:52] our weapons become dull by sharpening by
[14:55] only sharpening with just a few minutes
[14:57] of prayer you know it becomes a dull
[14:59] blade then
[15:00] says the scripture says blessed are they
[15:02] that hunger and thirst for they shall be
[15:04] filled amen
[15:06] one commentator was was writing on the
[15:09] story in Acts 12 where the Believers
[15:11] were praying interceding for prayer
[15:13] while he was in prison and he said in
[15:15] that scripture acts 12 5 but prayer but
[15:19] prayer is the link that connects us with
[15:22] God this is the bridge that spans every
[15:24] Gulf and bears us over every abyss of
[15:28] danger of need how significant the
[15:30] picture of an Apostolic Church Peter
[15:33] imprisoned the Jewish term Supreme the
[15:36] arena of martyrdom awaiting the dawning
[15:38] of the morning to drink up the apostles
[15:40] blood and everything else against it but
[15:43] prayer was made unto God without ceasing
[15:45] and what was the sequel the prison
[15:48] opened the apostles free the Jews
[15:50] baffled the wicked King eaten of worms a
[15:53] spectacle of hidden retribution and the
[15:55] word of God rolling on in Greater
[15:58] Victory praise God do we know the power
[16:01] of our supernatural weapon the
[16:03] commentator says and do we dare to use
[16:05] it on the author of a faith that
[16:07] commands as well as asks
[16:10] God baptized us with holy audacity and
[16:13] Define divine confidence he is not
[16:16] wanting great men but he is wanting men
[16:18] who will dare to prove the greatness of
[16:20] their God
[16:21] but God but prayer
[16:24] amen he's wanting to men and women not
[16:28] great I'm not great we're not great but
[16:31] we serve a great God who can do many
[16:33] great things amen and that's my desire
[16:36] this morning he goes on to say that God
[16:38] that prayer is are God's opportunities
[16:42] his opportunity to bring us further into
[16:45] a maturity in him his opportunity to
[16:47] give you a greater experience he's he's
[16:49] wanting that for you he's wanting you to
[16:51] be further mature in his word he's
[16:53] wanting to to bring you to a greater
[16:55] place he's just waiting on you because
[16:57] he's a gentleman
[16:59] I love just the next this this next
[17:01] scripture Jeremiah 33 it says call to me
[17:04] and I will answer and tell you and even
[17:06] show you Great and Mighty things things
[17:09] which have been confined and hidden
[17:11] which you do not know and understand and
[17:14] cannot distinguish he wants to show us
[17:17] Great and Mighty things and he desires
[17:19] communion with you
[17:21] he just wants to separate ourselves he
[17:24] wants us to separate ourselves a little
[17:25] bit so that he can meet us in that quiet
[17:27] place amen
[17:29] he just once as we talked on last one
[17:31] last Sunday he just wants a willingness
[17:34] to yield and a sacrifice of just some
[17:36] things in our life sacrifice of of a
[17:40] little bit of time and it's really just
[17:42] such a beautiful thing
[17:46] um
[17:47] come into a close here
[17:49] I don't want this to be like a New
[17:51] Year's resolution you know that we say
[17:53] that we're going to go and do better and
[17:55] then just forget about it I I just want
[17:57] to even start even if it's just
[17:59] something small to take back a little
[18:01] bit of that precious that precious time
[18:03] that that even even that the hustle and
[18:07] bustle of just you know looking at our
[18:09] phone and just putting that down for a
[18:11] few minutes and really entering into
[18:13] prayer
[18:15] maybe just read uh reading a chapter or
