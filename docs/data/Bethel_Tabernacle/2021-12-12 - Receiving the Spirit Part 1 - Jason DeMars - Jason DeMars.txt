TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so so [Music] god bless you let's stand and pray gracious heavenly father we come before you now lord and we're so thankful for your goodness and mercy in this hour lord we understand it's satan's eden there's a there's a darkness pressing in lord in this age and yet while all that's happening lord you've called a bride and you're pressing her into light and we're so thankful for that lord we know as the scripture said what whatsoever doth make manifests is light lord and the bride is to be the manifestation of this hour lord i pray you help us to that end lord we have believe we're still here because we have more to surrender more to grow into to mature into lord help us to do that father help us to lay aside the things lord that are coming against us and and that we're allowing to have half place lord help us to fight help us to engage in the spiritual warfare that's taking place in this day we thank you for your goodness and mercy lord be with us this morning bless the word as it comes forth bless the hearers as they hear lord may you be glorified in it all we ask in jesus name amen i'm going to go on to a new subject this time receiving the spirit and the first scripture i want to look at is john 3 verse 3. jesus answered and said unto him verily merely i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated specifically i want to look at um is is the look at the biblical evidence is the baptism the holy ghost a different act than the new birth or is it the same thing and then the neck and the next part of that is how did let's look in the scripture and how did they receive the holy spirit because how they received it god in action in the book of acts should be the same way that we receive it in in our day and age because he's the same yesterday today and forever and when god makes a promise he can't go back on his promise but that works in one way these are message principles that we've gotten god works in one way to start the age he has to finish the age working the same way now that there's different dispensations there's different ways god dealt with abraham differently than he dealt with the children of israel right under the dispensation of the law before the law the children of israel were dealt with differently until the law was given and they accepted it and god dealt with them differently that's the old covenant then a new covenant comes he dealt with adam and eve differently than he dealt with their their generation after that right each dispensation seven dispensations of time you know we're in the sixth one right now seventh one is coming we're looking forward to that millennium amen and so we're thankful for the word in this day to clarify all these things i think we all know the answers to the questions i post but i think it's good to go into the scriptures and look and see how does it speak of it so the first one we see where the man says this is jesus first doctrine is the new birth except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god brothers it's in the reason why it's coming like that is it's in presenter view so you got to go up into the settings and change that all right so read the context to that we read verse 3 we'll read verse 5 and 6 as well in john chapter 3 jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen matthew 3 11 i'm i'm just going to go quickly over a bunch of different scriptures in the new testament and just pose that question the question again um matthew 3 11 i indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire so if you look if if you're not aware there's there's i would probably say most reformers believe that in the old testament there were certain disciples and and or certain certain heroes of the faith that were born again so they believed that the new birth was in effect during the old testament and then in the when the new covenant comes something new came but it was more perfect because it was through the blood so that basically is there evidence even even if you look at um not one is pentecostals but assemblies of god and charismatic they believe that the new birth comes when you believe and then the baptism of the holy ghost comes when you speak with tongues so there are two separate distinct acts and so you look at that and they say in the old testament they were born again but they didn't receive the baptism of the holy spirit the new thing was the baptism of the holy spirit all right so is there evidence to demonstrate that there's a few scriptures but i think the overarching theme will prove that out numbers 14 24 but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and and followed me fully him will i bring into the land wherein he went and his seed shall possess it so that's the first one that is typically brought up he had another spirit with him there's therefore he must be born again okay it doesn't say that number one that's that's a big that's a huge leap to say caleb was born again it doesn't say that it said there was another spirit with him and that's absolutely the teaching of scripture that the great heroes of the faith had the holy spirit upon them they were anointed with the holy spirit all right deuteronomy 10 16 says circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiff net so notice that scripture he says to the children of israel circumcise therefore the foreskin heart in other words you do it you do you circumcise yourself did they do it could they do it well that wasn't fair that god says that they were supposed to do it they're unable to do it many many times god tells his people to do something in order to just illustrate the point you're unable they can't circumcise their own heart can you circumcise your heart well if you reinterpret it to mean one dedicated rededicating my heart rededicating my life if you take it to mean that sure you can but the reality is this is a cutting cutting when you certain circumcision something is cut away can you change your nature can you change your disposition you can change your disposition a little bit but usually what happens is you go right back you go right back so this is talking about something that is a permanent change change your heart stop being stiff-necked can you do that in your own power does scripture teach us that we can do that in our own power absolutely not deuteronomy 30 verse 5 and 6 and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy father has possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do the good and multiply thee above thy fathers now now notice verse six and the lord got thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul that thou may live so there's two different things you circumcise your heart and now here's a promise that god says i will circumcise your heart so that you will love me amen all right so there's two two separate things there's a there's a command to do it you do it that's the old testament right you have to live by the law you have to do it within your own power i want to ask a question we find any old testament king patriarch prophet who lived a hundred percent by the word he never could they never could one of the greatest men of god of the old testament was david and look at his life thank god he lived by grace they lived there for god's elect there's grace right there was a sacrifice that they made but the reality is the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sins so the old covenant was something that was simply demonstrating this is your need that's the reality is it says that it was the new covenant is a better covenant what the fault isn't with the old covenant the fault is with the people following the old covenant and i think that's isn't that the point by the law is the knowledge of sin there's no new birth in the law there's no changed heart in the law there's no transformation in the law there was there was grace provided a sacrifice which just pushed forward the sin pushed forward the sin it was always a remembrance always remembering this joint it doesn't actually take away it just pushes it forward what does it push it forward if there's a if there's a sincere heart a repentant heart along with that sacrifice it pushed it forward towards the blood of jesus christ ezekiel 36 26 and 27 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you although i was a husband unto them saith the lord it's the new covenant is not like the old covenant it's a different covenant how is it different verse 33 but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts it's not just written on tables of stone and say you must obey them but he's going to take that law and by the holy spirit write that law in their hearts and he says and and i will write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people again covenant it's not an old covenant reworked over it's a new covenant where he takes god's laws in the old testament you take the ten commandments that's an expression of god's heart expression of god's nature okay so he takes those laws and he writes them on the inside of our hearts so what does he do we read that i'll give you a new heart a new spirit and i'll put my spirit inside of you so how does he write his law in our hearts by changing our heart changing our spirit changing and giving us his spirit a new a new nature inside of us his nature inside of us the old testament didn't give you access to that yes there was access to grace but not access to a new heart a new spirit and his spirit there was an anointing that but it didn't change the heart again why a new covenant if caleb and other jewish heroes were already born again why the future promise of circumcising the hearts and the minds if they already were circumcised in heart and mind it doesn't make sense does it there's a future promise that he makes that they did not have access to in the old testament what did they have access to in the old testament they were elect they were the seed of god they had a seed in their heart but they couldn't perfectly follow the law they couldn't they couldn't they couldn't walk in a new nature they didn't have access to that that's what jesus promises you must be born again there's one coming after me who will baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire so looking at the gospel in action does peter or paul speak of two different works of the spirit one in the new birth and one in the baptism of the holy ghost does peter offer that on the day of pentecost no no he sure doesn't for by one spirit first corinthians 12 13 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit so can you be born again and not a part of the body of christ because here it's saying it's the baptism of the holy spirit that puts you as a part of the body of christ if that's a separate act from the new birth then yeah you can be born again and not a part of the body of christ does it make any sense it doesn't make sense acts 2 33 says therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and have having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which you now see and hear so again it's saying jesus received from the father in other words the prophecies of the old testament jesus received the explanation the revelation of what those are and he was going to bring them forth upon the people through his death burial resurrection ascension to be the mediator of a new covenant now he is shedding forth what you see what did they see a bunch of people speaking in another language that was their language so they they saw the promise of the holy ghost acts 2 37-38 now when they heard this they heard the gospel preached by peter when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them believe and be born again and then go on and receive the holy ghost and speak in tongues then peter said unto them repent so repent so they already believed they wouldn't have asked the question if they didn't believe so they already believed then peter said unto them repent and be baptized speaking of water baptism every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that which that was shed forth through jesus that they saw and witnessed now peter's saying this is how you get what we got repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and the promise is to you to receive that gift of the holy ghost he's not talking about three different two different acts of the spirit he's talking about receiving the holy spirit that's what the new birth is it's being born of the spirit it's being baptized in the spirit it's the new testament talks about it in many different ways many ways that this one act in our lives is described acts 8 14-17 now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria i want you to notice also the first one was to jews right so he's preaching to jews they heard the message that was preached but the spirit didn't fall on them did it they heard it they said what should we do and peter gave them the prescription of what to do now when the apostles which are at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god so they they believed the word they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost now we don't want to think we don't want to look at this and say god only works like acts 2 38. we don't have a perfect formula every single time it's different for samaria they heard it they were baptized they didn't receive the holy ghost right away until those apostles came it laid hands on them another what am i trying to say is it's not a cookie cutter same every time it's different in each of these situations acts 9 17 this is the gentiles and ananias went his way and entered excuse me this is paul ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way that thou camest has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost so here's paul he meets jesus he struck blind he believes the message that he heard then ananias comes lays hand on on him he receives the holy ghost after that he gets baptized acts 10 44 and 45 while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them this is the gentiles the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost now here's believers who received the holy ghost while they were listening to the message that was preached they believed in their heart and it dropped right in to them amen so it it isn't a cookie cutter the way god gives you the holy ghost every person's journey is different experience is different but it is an experience that you have to have with god it isn't merely saying i believe the message you hear that today that the token is just believing the message why did brother branham say you say i believe the message that's just being able to read you must have the token why because it's an experience a person can believe the message intellectually and fall away from the message right but if you believe the message and god then you have an experience with god and he gives you the holy ghost you're not going to fall away you're not you're not gonna go by the wayside it's two different things the token is not the tapes the token is not merely believing the message the evidence of the holy ghost you know we talk about this terminology the initial evidence can someone find me in scripture the term initial evidence it's not in there it's not in there what what is the ongoing evidence when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth all right it's guiding you into all truth my my personal experience from the lord was i was i heard the gospel i believed it i wasn't living it all right there was a time my friends were confronting me and talking to me and i just eventually said lord i i just want i'm so tired of this i just want to live for you and he changed my heart he filled me with the holy spirit and my whole every desire changed and then little by little god started showing me doctrines of the message before i ever heard the message and then somebody my friends who led me to the lord introduced me to another guy who who introduced me to the message and after four or five months i accepted it was from god but that holy spirit that i received what did it do it it was the spirit of truth that led me into all truth he was leading me from into truth from the beginning from the very minute even though i knew nothing about the prophet about brother branham but god led me to the message that's the spirit of truth that's the quote unquote evidence of the holy spirit but it's not it's not really evidence for you and i to say look on the outside and say oh brad has the holy spirit because he has the evidence and i see this you could have said that about many of the people that left the message the evidence is not like that it's not a pentecostal thing it's not it's not a initial evidence oh praise god he believes the message he has the initial evidence of the holy ghost where does brother branham say that see our concepts the way we look at things planted there from a denominational way of thinking that's not how that's not how the word of god speaks it that's what brother branham was trying to change us from that mentality and again it's a balance what's the what's the evidence that the spirit of truth leads you into all truth which means you're believing the message but it's not merely that because you can believe the message and not have the holy ghost you say hey you're talking in double speak no no that spirit of truth inside of you guides you into all truth let's ask another question how many of you believe the message the teachings of the message exactly the same way you do 25 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago 10 why because the holy spirit is teaching us is correcting us there's a five-fold ministry people people when they first received the message in the 60s 65 they heard about serpent seed water baptism and there's a prophet and we're not trinitarians how much more did they understand not much more how much more do we understand than that we would consider that baby stuff why are you just staying on that baby stuff we've got strong meat now it was all there in 1965 nobody had any clue what the prophet was saying and he knew that he spoke to his son and said do you understand what i said yes sir no you didn't it wasn't for that hour but it was laying something down brother branham said that i hope these men that come after me will pick this up and make more sense to it amen we thank the lord for fivefold ministry that would break open the word it isn't merely just pressing the tape we've got to understand the revelations that are contained in the tape the tape's a wonderful thing the books are a wonderful thing but it doesn't do any good sitting on a tape in a book this isn't a catholic religion this is a living god living inside of living people that's what the holy ghost is given for amen let's stand and pray gracious father we thank you so much for this beautiful balanced word that you've given to us in this hour lord help us to live it walk in it help us to glorify you with our lives lord forgive us of our sins cleanse our hearts and minds from from wickedness lord we want to be more like jesus christ every day father we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
