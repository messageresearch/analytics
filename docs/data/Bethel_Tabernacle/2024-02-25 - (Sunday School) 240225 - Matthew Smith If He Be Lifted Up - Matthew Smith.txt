TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everybody um pardon me if I'm a little congested I'm uh trusting in the Lord to do our Sunday school today and in Halls so that's it's good um let's stand and have a word of prayer oh gracious father Lord we come before you this morning Lord not with anything that I would want to say or do but father that you would put have put something on my heart some words bring the people and Lord that it might be simple but Lord as I've once heard that father you're as as complicated as we might want you to be and as simple as we might need you to be so father maybe you would take these few simple words that I have and bring them to the people in such a way that they might find encouragement deliverance and they might press the battle ever stronger so father that if I could step out of the way and that it would not be my emotions or or my my feelings father but that it would be your word speaking through me so father I yield myself to you father as we turn to your word Lord we ask you would provide the context the text that we would read we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um I want to turn to um numbers 21 see here numbers 21 and verse four and uh you know lot of times you have a Sunday school or a sermon or something and you got 17 18 pages of notes with you know quotes and scriptures and couple thousand words of you know your own commentary or whatever in there and some days you have three scriptures on a piece of scrap paper so hopefully uh you don't mind Something Real Simple um so numbers 21 and verse4 says and they journeyed from Mount by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loathes this light bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against um spok the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man then he be when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived man y'all can be seated um so this story as I'm sure um to you know when I I think about this you know if you're of any spiritual mind at all immediately the fact that the people would have that it would be serpents amongst them right should immediately be recognizing and and ultimately we know that that the brass serpent is a type of the crucifixion um which we'll get into maybe a little bit in a minute but this is a beautiful metaphor for for salvation and for the the state that Humanity finds themselves in because you know looking back to the to to Genesis and the original sin we know that Humanity has been bitten by a serpent right Humanity has been you know in the Garden of Eden Humanity was bitten by a serpent that there was a poison injected into the into the blood of humanity and that all of us are now now subject to that right that we carry this nature this serpent nature within us that we don't necessarily want we don't like it it poisons us it poisons the things that we do poisons the things that we think and we're all subject to die by that right that we all will die eventually because of that that bite of The Serpent and ultimately there is a sacrif you know there's an atonement right there was a sacrifice there was a a a something that would be lifted up that we could we could look to and be delivered from that um but I I want to just notice here that it it was that the people began to complain right it was the murmuring and the complaining that brought the serpent into their lives it was dissatisfaction with what they had that you know here they were in the desert and they begin to complain about God and against Moses and about what God was doing for them he just you know he delivered them from Egypt he delivered them from in in in in this particular scripture they had overcome any food right because it says that there it says well we don't have any bread any bread we don't don't have any water and we don't like this light bread well light bread they're referring to as Mana right they're saying well the the word that you've poured out upon us our daily bread that you've given us it doesn't make us feel good right it's not tasty enough right right it doesn't it doesn't give us immediate you know sensual fleshly gratification so we don't really want to eat that what we really want is some you know something more tasty something more you know that we our flesh likes more and they're finding all these excuses and they're laying this at the feet of God and and the prophet like it's their fault completely completely focused on the here and now and the temporal right not completely ignoring what God had already done for them delivered them out of Egypt completely ignoring what God was doing for them when he would take them into a promised land and just looking at their particular issues right here right now and saying well I don't feel very good right now therefore it's God's fault right therefore it's Moses fault and so God sends serpents amongst them um you know I I once heard somebody say it just so I thought it was pretty profound said that complaining is for the devil what worship is for God Amen like huh that's a thought you know people how many time you know the Bible talks about giving praise to the Lord always and and everything that you do give praise un the Lord and that's true and you should do it but how often are people praising the devil every time they open their mouth to complain you know every time we look at our situation and go well this is not to my liking and you have some word of complaint in in in complaining you are ultimately lifting up Satan and what he's doing and you're and you're not recognizing that God is sufficient for all your needs so you know and and so many times people have people have so much to to complain about whether it's you know maybe it's maybe it's the people complain about preachers you know they don't necess like one person or the other you know they have different preferences and you know people are different people have preferences that's okay you know but how often do um you know when you nothing nothing breeds Discord in in a in a group or in a body like people complaining amen right I don't know if if you know anybody you've ever been like on a sports team or or even like a construction site or something like that and you got a lot of guys and or girls or whoever and everyone's trying to you know work towards some common goal and the conditions are miserable and nothing's going according to plan and the weather's bad and you know whatever whatever obstruction and complication has arisen and everybody knows it's miserable and it takes one person to start complaining and then everyone wants to quit right complaining will rip through a a an organization so fast and just pollute the attitude of everyone involved so fast is like a plague you know and you know you you know my context like I say construction sites or whatever you know you'll you'll be everyone will be you know trying to push through get the job done it's miserable and everybody knows it you know material didn't show up on time and then it starts raining and now everyone's having to dig the ditch in the rain and it just got so much worse than it could have been and it was hot earlier in the day so now you have a sauna and everyone's got something to complain about and everyone's just talking about how miserable it is and we all just want to throw down to go home and you get one person to start to complain and it becomes infectious and then everyone wants to complain and before long it's the boss's fault and he should have checked the weather better and I can't believe he sent us out here to dig this in the rain and we're tearing up the customers lawn anyways and it's like well before long it's whose fault that the that it rained it's not the boss's fault that it rained you know but no it's his fault you know it people will and so when people get mad and discontent suddenly they got to find somebody to throw under the bus right and so often Our Lives will be will be you know we're going through some hard things and really what it is is God teaching us to be content and to trust him even when it things get difficult right and the minute that people go to start complaining the same thing happens in a church by the way you know things get difficult maybe there's you you know something's going on maybe whatever it is people start complaining and oh you know you have one one person in the church starts having a problem and suddenly the gossip starts coming around you know and people start getting getting uh you know everybody breaks up into their little clicks and that click is talking about that click and this little group is is you know did you hear about what so and so did you know and and it it's Discord it's it's discontent it's disunity in the church how often do we read in the book of Acts in Acts chapter 2 when they when the Holy Ghost fell on them and they were imbued with power it was because they were in one mind and one Accord you want to break the Oneness and the unity of a church start complaining right start complaining and before long the serpent nature that's inside of everyone's going to start coming out right the you're going to have a church infested with snakes infested with serpents everyone's going to get bit and and it's not just you know and it's discontent with anything it's it's you know just because they were they they had no faith in what God was doing no faith in what in in the ability for God to deliver them from whatever situation and whatever their their trials were and you know so often times you know you look at your life and you ask yourself why do I not have the ability to overcome why do I not have victory in my life why am I having all these troubles have you stopped to really think about when the last time you gave thanks to the Lord was right even when it's miserable you're still supposed to raise your hands and praise the Lord even when even when it's you know everything is disaster that's not the time to start complaining if you start complaining of course you're not going to have any Victory you know it's like you know we talk about that the that the uh you know we've been made more than you know more than conquerors and Overcomers what exactly are we conquering and overcoming you know it's we don't have am malachit across town that we got to go destroy right though half the time people act that way no it's it's the man in the mirror right that's who you're conquering that's who you need to have victory over and if you want to ensure that you f that that guy beats you start complaining right start complaining and that serpent that looks back at you from the mirror will annihilate you and so ultimately you know I I noticed you know another thing to to to notice is that when Moses makes the serpent they come to him and said well we've we've sinned you know we we spoke out against you when we spoke out against God pray for us that the Lord would deliver us of this of these this this serpent you know this serpent nature that has attacked us and the the atonement the brass serpent that he raises up it doesn't make the snakes go away it means that it doesn't have any power anymore right you're never because of that serpent nature in your flesh that Fallen nature that Fallen man in your flesh isn't going to disappear until the Rapture you're to live with him the what you know the the the the the brass serpent that we look to doesn't make that go away it means that you have the ability to overcome it means it has no power over you I want to turn to um John chapter 3 and um we'll go to verse 13 and it says um and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and man loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil Vil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that the Deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God and so ultimately you know we look at at this story you know of some people complaining and being dis content and ultimately what their sin was is failure to believe in the delivering power of God am it's failure to recognize that the word of God had had brought them that far had brought them out of Egypt that it was by the spoken word of God that they were where they were at that point and that it was the same word that was going to carry into the promised land and because they failed to hold that they they knew that God had brought them that far and they just chose not to cling to that to not put their faith in that they just chose to look to their circumstances and that's where they that's where the the failure came and so often times I mean we fail all the time you know even if it's not necessarily you know complaining it's always something all sin is unbelief right all sin is failure to recognize who you are and it recognize to to believe that you should not do those things you know there's a there's a difference between somebody who who knows something and somebody who believes something you know there's a difference there's a difference there you know I um I so at one time I went rock climbing at like one of those rock climbing places and I don't like heights I never have but I want to do it anyway so I climb up this wall and it's really high up there and um you have your your harness and your rope and everything and the whole time you're climbing up there I know in my head I believe this thing's going to hold me this I'm not falling off this off side of this wall right I I'm not going to break this rope but until you jump off the side of that wall and throw your entire weight like because you have to come back down you have to repel back down till you jump off the side of that wall and really put some faith in it you don't really you don't really believe in it you know it's that moment where you're at the top and you're your arms are kind of like man I got to jump off the side of this thing because I can't hang on anymore but I really really don't trust this thing you know I but until you go and kick off that wall you don't really believe it's going to hold you now once you do and you know you feel the thing catch and you and you go to the ground now you believe in it now there's no trouble you can go up and down that wall as many times as you want and you have and then it kind of becomes kind of fun right because you know but so often times we know you know we read the Bible and all the Lord is a pres ever presentent help in the time of trouble and yes it's very good but until you actually face it do you really believe it right until it's time to really throw yourself into the hands of God and say Lord You're All I've got that's right do you really believe it and so my my I guess my encouragement to you is that you know it's not enough to just say well I see this in the in the scripture I know the Lord you know we look look at ourselves because ultimately the the the brass Serpent and the serpents in the desert and all these things it's just a it's just a parable it's a metaphor it's a it's a type of what we struggle with today in this dark day this evil day of looking at ourselves in the mirror and recognizing all the places where we fail all the places where we fall short all the serpents in our lives that are just hanging off of us and half the time it's our own fault because of the places where we doubted the places where we fell short and now we have a serpent that's that we got to deal with you know and we're having to come back to God and say Lord I I need help it was my fault that this happened but will you help me anyhow and you know God didn't God didn't say no you brought this on yourself have fun with the snakes you know he gave them he gave them away out he gave him an atonement you know this is that's where that's where we have to you know when we come to God we say listen Lord I am Bound by things that I brought on myself the you there's a brass serpent to look to you know you don't have the you know you don't and you're like we look at these things and say Lord I can't overcome the man in the mirror and that's correct you can't there's you're not going to you literally can't do it it's outside of your power but but you were never intended to right the Lord is there to help you the Lord is is the one one you know one thing that I that so struck me about the scripture so here's Jesus is showing there's a tip between the brass Serpent and himself right obviously we know that Christ goes to the cross and and here he is lifted up on a on a pole you know like just like the brass serpent you could look to the Cross you could look to the serpent you know it's you all see the type here but the question that I had was wait a minute why does the type show a serpent on the pole Jesus wasn't a serpent right why isn't it a lamb up there well you know when the because the you know we we'll talk about the lamb you know that the man when he brought the lamb as a sacrifice he put his hand on the Lamb's head and he's what he's doing is he's putting all of his sin onto this innocent one the lamb didn't commit any sins but the man did and the man is putting his sin on the lamb the lamb becomes his sin and then when the lamb dies so does his sin okay and so when Christ goes to the Cross Christ was sinless he was a perfect lamb but your sin was on him he took all of your sin all the things that all of your sinful nature all the places where you fell and you failed and you knew better and did it anyways and he puts all that onto himself and he goes on that cross and when he dies so does your sin and it's not and the reason why there's no lamb Moses didn't raise up a lamb for the people to see is because the lamb being Christ right it's the type of Christ who I mean Christ has has no you know he's no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life you can't really kill him not really you know you could take him out of the world from it but he came back he resurrected because he has no beginning therefore he can have no end if there was a you know if there was a lamb on the pole you know raised up for the people to look at if Moses had made it a lamb it's not a finished work cuz the work was was finished when he resurrected right but there was a serpent because when the lamb and the serpent both go to the Cross when it's all said and done the Serpent's the only thing still up there right the lamb got off the cross the serpent didn't right the serpent had a beginning and it has an end right you might have faults and failures now but ultimately that serpent nature that you struggle against die died it's gone you don't have to be subject to that thing anymore the the the the the lamb has has has um that's there's no power anymore because death has died right you're no longer subject to that you know the in in Genesis when when Humanity Falls there's a curse put on Humanity that you know there there's um there's sickness there's death there's excuse me things that we're going to encounter but once the penalty for sin has been paid you're no longer required to Bear the burden of that and so anything that we would come in in in need of I mean obviously I don't know what any of y'all's situations are um but just recognize that no matter what your situation is even the greatest ones the things that might not necessarily be um um you know so often times we at least for me maybe y'all are different but I know for me a lot of the times it's it's harder for me to look at the problems that I have spiritually and the struggles that I have and say and to have faith for that than it is to even have faith for something like healing or or something like that because I it's easy for me to look at a sickness and say well by a Stripes I am healed you know there's an atonement for that you know that was that's just the curse of the devil and we're going to overcome that but when you're looking at something said I did this to my myself and I deserve it where that's where you got to have faith right that's that's hard you know and so I don't know what anybody what anybody is is dealing with and I'm just I got I'm out of time so I'm just going to wrap up with this you know I just want to encourage all of you all to recognize that you know even no matter what the situation is amen there's an atonement there's a brass serpent to look to Christ no matter what your situation is no matter where you're struggling no matter how the devil has come against you there is a a there is an atonement and a brass Serpent and you can look at look at that and you can look at that and say I know where my current situation is right and the and the devil may have me in a bind right now but I can look to that atonement and recognize that is the devil's end so let's let's stand and have a a word of prayer real quick dear father Lord we thank you for this little little Sunday school lesson that you've given us Lord and we ask that you would be with the the people father we yield our hearts to you father totally and completely Lord in a cons fresh consecration to you each and every day Lord that as the the worship would come worship service would begin that we could open our hearts fully and accept the we' lift up your name in praise and worship father content in all that we do Lord we we want to make you number one in our lives lift you up above our lives and and put you first that father that if we would raise you up as a banner and follow after father that we would be that we could have victory in all that all that we encounter so Lord commit the people to your hands father the remaining of the service that you would come in the in the worship service and that we could you would open our hearts Lord and that they be receptive and ready for the for the ultimate form of worship which which is this preaching of the word that the people would be edified and healed and there would be healing and deliverance father that you would be with us through that the of the day we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
