[39:52] i hope you guys are just really
[39:54] appreciative of the
[39:56] the ministries you sit up under amen
[39:59] because i don't get a chance to
[40:01] actually hear brother jason a lot but
[40:03] when i do i certainly enjoyed it
[40:06] hey man i did we did some meetings
[40:07] together a couple months ago and
[40:09] i was thoroughly blessed hallelujah
[40:12] hey man
[40:13] matthew 17.
[40:15] hey man
[40:17] uh let's start reading that um
[40:20] verse 10 just kind of make the reading
[40:21] short
[40:24] here's this
[40:26] matthew 17 and 10 the bible says
[40:29] and his disciples asked him saying why
[40:32] then say
[40:34] the stripes that elias must first come
[40:37] and jesus answered and said unto them
[40:40] elias truly shall come
[40:43] and restore all things but i say unto
[40:46] you
[40:47] that elias
[40:48] is come already
[40:50] and they knew him not
[40:52] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[40:55] list likewise shall also the son of man
[40:59] suffer of them
[41:01] then the disciples understood that he
[41:04] spake
[41:05] unto them of john the baptist amen let's
[41:07] go second timothy
[41:09] chapter three
[41:26] second timothy three
[41:32] and uh let's start reading at verse one
[41:35] second timothy and three the bible says
[41:38] this know also that in the last days
[41:41] perilous times shall come
[41:43] for men shall be lovers of their own
[41:45] selves covenants bolsters proud
[41:48] blasphemous disobedient to parents
[41:51] unthankful
[41:53] unholy my
[41:55] now these are some powerful adjectives
[41:58] but this is the atmosphere of the world
[42:00] today
[42:02] this he says without natural affection
[42:05] truth breakers false accusers
[42:08] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[42:11] that are doing the despises of those
[42:14] that are good
[42:16] traitors
[42:17] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[42:20] more than lovers of god
[42:23] having a oh my having a form of
[42:26] godliness
[42:27] but denying the power thereof
[42:31] from such turn away now i want us to
[42:34] catch this
[42:35] he gave all those descriptions of what
[42:38] people are going to be
[42:40] and then at the end of it he said
[42:42] they're having a form of godliness
[42:45] so having a form of godliness including
[42:48] traitors
[42:49] unthankful unholy these are all these
[42:52] people but they are in church
[42:56] having a form of godliness
[43:03] this he says four of this sort are they
[43:06] which creep into houses and lead
[43:10] captive silly women laden with sins led
[43:13] away with diverse lusts ever learning
[43:16] and never able to come to the knowledge
[43:18] of the truth
[43:20] oh my let's go to second timothy i mean
[43:23] um ii peter
[43:25] chapter 3.
[43:46] second peter three
[43:47] um let's start at verse three
[43:51] knowing this first that there shall come
[43:54] in the last days scoffers
[43:56] walking after their own lusts and saying
[44:00] where is the promise of his coming i'm
[44:03] sure we all can say we've heard that
[44:06] he says for since the fathers fell
[44:09] asleep
[44:10] all things continue as they were from
[44:13] the beginning
[44:14] of the creation
[44:16] oh my may the lord bless the reading of
[44:18] his word you can have your seats
[44:31] thank god for the word
[44:33] you know by by the help of the lord
[44:35] tonight god's grace i kind of want this
[44:38] message to be a reminder hallelujah
[44:41] because i think sometimes we can get
[44:43] caught up in living you know how it is
[44:45] just in your daily life
[44:47] you know sometimes we have to put stuff
[44:49] on our calendar
[44:50] so we can be reminded of it because we
[44:53] get so busy that we'll forget something
[44:55] that's important that's why we write it
[44:57] down that's why we put the reminder
[44:59] there so we know we have to go to work
[45:02] we set our clocks at a certain time so
[45:04] we can be on time amen as a reminder
[45:07] hallelujah but you know i think
[45:09] sometimes so much go on
[45:11] in the world that there's so much that's
[45:14] been revealed to us we have to be
[45:16] reminded of what god has already done
[45:19] what god has already given us and my
[45:21] subject tonight is prophecy will
[45:24] or are or has already come to pass
[45:28] hallelujah prophecy will or already has
[45:32] come to pass hallelujah in church if we
[45:35] take just matthew 17
[45:38] the disciples begin to ask christ they
[45:40] say what does it mean when you you know
[45:42] when they say elias must first come you
[45:45] know and jesus response was
[45:47] it's true
[45:49] elias is going to come
[45:51] and restore all things so we can see
[45:54] that the coming of elias
[45:56] should restore all things
[45:59] and for us as believers we believe that
[46:01] that spirit of elias has came
[46:04] come on church we believe that the
[46:06] spirit of alliance has came hallelujah
[46:09] and if the spirit of elias has came
[46:12] all things to the believer has been
[46:14] restored
[46:15] so to us prophecy has already been
[46:19] fulfilled hallelujah to say that there's
[46:22] more that's going to be fulfilled but if
[46:25] we can receive the coming of elias we're
[46:28] standing in the midst and in the town of
[46:30] prophecy right now
[46:32] and you know church i think that's why
[46:34] the devil fights this message so hard
[46:37] holy because he i got a new saying that
[46:40] i heard he don't want us to catch up
[46:42] with ourselves hallelujah because if we
[46:45] catch up with ourselves we will step
[46:48] into the vision
[46:50] hallelujah and that's what the enemy
[46:52] don't want that's why he keeps fighting
[46:54] it that's why he keeps trying to bring
[46:55] things to make it look like it's
[46:57] something natural when it's something
[46:59] supernatural hallelujah and you know if
[47:02] i could just say this you know the
[47:04] prophet's ministry was a ministry of
[47:07] vision hallelujah
[47:08] it was a ministry that told things to
[47:11] come hallelujah you know it said that
[47:13] when the seventh angel messenger begins
[47:16] to sound that the mystery of god shall
[47:20] be finished
[47:21] hallelujah and if it's finished that
[47:24] means all things are restored hallelujah
[47:27] i'll say it again hallelujah that we
[47:30] have experienced prophecy fulfilled
[47:34] already
[47:35] so when it comes to matthew 17 i can
[47:38] stand here and say to you church by
[47:41] revelation this day the scripture has
[47:44] been fulfilled
[47:46] hallelujah but we have to look at it as
[47:49] more than just a bunch of quotes and and
[47:52] and and and just a bunch of lies but
[47:55] it's a life hallelujah that god has
[47:57] brought to us that's been fulfilled but
[48:00] listen i want to say something to you
[48:01] right quick
[48:02] in in in the message the prophet
[48:04] preached he said
[48:07] a spiritual dream
[48:09] is interpreted
[48:11] rightly interpreted is the same as a
[48:13] vision
[48:15] and what is a vision a vision is the
[48:18] forecast of future events amen
[48:21] hallelujah so we studied this message
[48:25] how many of you could see
[48:26] that the forecast was right
[48:30] hallelujah
[48:32] amen church when you're really paying
[48:35] attention
[48:36] to the person that whatever you call the
[48:38] man with the weather what are they
[48:39] called meteorologists am i right if
[48:42] you're really paying attention to that
[48:44] meteorologist hallelujah you address
[48:46] accordingly for the next day
[48:51] hallelujah
[48:52] and you listen to him i want you to
[48:54] catch this
[48:55] you listen to him by faith
[48:58] hallelujah you believe what he say by
[49:01] faith hallelujah what he's saying has
[49:04] never been proven before you step into
[49:06] that next day by faith hallelujah
[49:09] because he said something and according
[49:11] to his job he has the credentials to
[49:14] back it up
[49:15] so nobody questions it hallelujah he
[49:17] puts all his graphs up all these
[49:19] different things church we've had graphs
[49:22] put up hallelujah
[49:24] graphs that cannot be denied hallelujah
[49:27] graphs that cannot be changed hallelujah
[49:29] we got grabs amen that tells us the
[49:32] future
[49:34] but what god is trying to get us to do
[49:36] is trust the messenger
[49:39] hallelujah trust the messenger because
[49:42] amen churches like this if that look
[49:44] look at it church if that meteorologist
[49:47] gets it wrong he still don't lose his
[49:49] job
[49:53] but we got a meteorologist
[49:56] we got a meteorologist that never gets
[49:59] it wrong and people still won't trust
[50:00] him
[50:04] everything he's ever said has come to
[50:07] pass
[50:08] now i'm not just talking about brother
[50:09] branham i'm talking about christ because
[50:12] what brother branham said hallelujah
[50:14] could only come from christ the owner of
[50:16] the station
[50:18] hallelujah
[50:20] in church look at it oh my love i love
[50:22] it when it comes fresh hallelujah
[50:24] church i i i just appreciate it so much
[50:27] because a vision
[50:29] is a forecast of the future and we know
[50:32] that the prophet he preached by vision
[50:34] but what i want to say tonight
[50:38] by the grace of god
[50:41] thank you brother
[50:42] what i want to say tonight
[50:44] is that when you catch
[50:46] the vision of malachi 4
[50:48] you step into the future
[50:51] you step into future events hallelujah
[50:54] and me and somebody else was talking and
[50:55] she said i want to live in my present
[50:57] i'm like no i don't want to live in my
[50:59] presence i want to live in my future
[51:01] because in my present i'm in a body of
[51:04] death in my present i can get sick in my
[51:07] presence i can have mine battles in my
[51:09] present hallelujah i can be discouraged
[51:11] but in my future i am eternal
[51:15] in my future hallelujah i have the
[51:18] promise of the resurrection in my future
[51:21] i can never die in my future i can never
[51:24] be sick in my future the joy of the lord
[51:27] is my strength so i don't want to live
[51:30] in my pricing i want to live in my
[51:32] future because in my future i fellowship
[51:35] have relationship with christ jesus
[51:37] forever
[51:40] that's my forecast
[51:43] that's our forecast
[51:45] holy that's your forecast tonight
[51:48] the thing of it is is do you believe it
[51:52] holy are you preparing
[51:55] for that day
[51:57] because if they say it's gonna rain what
[51:58] do we do
[52:01] we get our rain gear
[52:04] some of you got rain boots and they look
[52:06] ridiculous
[52:08] but that doesn't stop you from putting
[52:10] it on why because it's going to protect
[52:12] your feet from getting wet
[52:14] in church they say hallelujah that our
[52:16] forecast may look ridiculous by how we
[52:19] dress hallelujah but you know what it's
[52:21] protecting me for days to come
[52:23] it's protecting me from the wrath of god
[52:26] hallelujah and we know you no good as
[52:28] anybody sometimes in beaufort when it
[52:31] rains hit pause
[52:33] so you have to have on the right gear
[52:35] hallelujah cause if you ain't got on the
[52:37] right gear you may be swept away
[52:38] hallelujah
[52:40] whoa you got to be in the right vehicle
[52:43] hallelujah because you got swamps and
[52:45] alligators down here
[52:50] but church no matter what the forecast
[52:52] is holly
[52:54] you trust the meteorologists
[52:56] holy
[52:58] nobody questions that meteorologist they
[53:00] wait to see if it's going to come to
[53:02] pass
[53:03] hallelujah in church
[53:05] we have a message that god has given us
[53:08] that has forecast our future
[53:10] hallelujah oh my and are we living in
[53:14] our future
[53:15] are we living in the prophecies that
[53:17] have been fulfilled church don't let the
[53:20] enemy lukewarm your love for god
[53:24] because when you go back in timothy
[53:26] hallelujah he said in in in in timothy
[53:30] he said in the last days perilous times
[53:34] shall come church we are here
[53:37] we're living in perilous times and just
[53:40] in case you haven't realized we've had a
[53:43] preview of what a world a world order
[53:47] government looks like
[53:49] we had a preview of it in these last two
[53:51] years covet made everybody fall under
[53:54] the same orders
[53:57] hallelujah
[53:58] every country
[54:00] every nation
[54:01] everybody shut down the same way
[54:06] and they put mandates in that every
[54:09] leader every president hallelujah every
[54:12] overseer had to follow
[54:15] but listen here we already knew the
[54:17] forecast for that
[54:20] hallelujah that's why you shouldn't be
[54:21] afraid hallelujah because god has gave
[54:24] us a glimpse of the future hallelujah so
[54:27] even though we experienced hollywood
[54:29] that piece of prophecy church think
[54:31] about how good it is to the believer
[54:34] when you can see it before it happens
[54:38] that's where we are
[54:40] i'm gonna show you some things tonight
[54:42] holy that god has already showed us
[54:45] and we're watching it happen but we
[54:47] don't realize we are part of the vision
[54:54] we are the fulfillment in the prophecy
[54:57] got somebody
[54:59] whoa
[55:00] oh my
[55:01] church
[55:02] look at these kind of people that are in
[55:04] church
[55:05] he says
[55:07] hollywood for me it shall be lovers of
[55:09] their own selves covetousness bolsters
[55:12] proud blasphemers i'm sure most of us
[55:15] know at least one person in one of those
[55:17] categories
[55:18] but let's keep going he says disobedient
[55:21] to parents oh my god
[55:26] i'mma leave y'all young people alone
[55:30] i ain't talking about in the world
[55:34] i'm talking about in church
[55:37] hollywood these kind of spirits are
[55:39] lingering in church
[55:41] holy i just got back from brother crosby
[55:43] him and the lord the lord was dealing
[55:45] with me to to speak to them even though
[55:48] y'all experiencing supernatural i mean
[55:51] real they experienced real supernatural
[55:53] things in that church he said make sure
[55:55] it's inspired by the holy ghost
[55:58] because satan can impersonate any gift
[56:02] but one thing he can't impersonate is
[56:04] that life
[56:05] hallelujah
[56:06] church hallelujah oh my listen he says
[56:10] without he says he says disobedient to
[56:12] parents unthankful oh mom sure we see
[56:15] people unthankful
[56:18] unthankful unholy oh my you know now
[56:21] brother jason you try to teach people
[56:23] and tell them what the bible say and
[56:25] because their spirits are unholy they'll
[56:28] just say well i ain't there yet
[56:32] i just don't see it god got to show it
[56:34] to me
[56:37] i clear those kind of people i really
[56:39] want to lay hands on them without the
[56:40] prayer
[56:47] because it's that kind of attitude that
[56:50] really shows you don't care
[56:54] holy cause we know let me back up a
[56:56] little bit church uh uh before i before
[56:59] i started preaching tonight what i
[57:01] should have said was
[57:03] this is the absolute
[57:06] we live by this
[57:07] there's no errors in us
[57:09] there's no false in us and let me make
[57:12] it real clear these are not brother
[57:14] diggs's words
[57:15] these are the words of god so if i quote
[57:18] anything out of here it's not my words
[57:21] it's how god feels
[57:24] and if you can't listen to what i'm
[57:26] saying coming out of here you're not
[57:28] listening to me you're rejecting god
[57:32] hallelujah and that's what we find out
[57:34] too many people are looking at the
[57:36] person not even realizing that we're
[57:38] just agents
[57:44] we're just agents
[57:47] oh my
[57:49] he said without natural affection
[57:51] truth breakers false accusers
[57:54] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[57:57] that are good oh my god
[57:59] there we are
[58:01] church look over the past couple years
[58:03] how much we've been persecuted for just
[58:06] trying to live truth
[58:08] show me in the scripture hallelujah
[58:11] where is wrong hallelujah to serve one
[58:13] god
[58:16] show me this scripture where is wrong to
[58:19] just love one woman
[58:22] that's what marriage and divorce is all
[58:24] about
[58:24] god's trying to keep you steady on the
[58:26] path hallelujah stand right in his eyes
[58:29] because god ain't got multiple women he
[58:31] got one bride
[58:34] oh my god
[58:37] but they're going to look at the prophet
[58:38] and say oh he made mistakes and all
[58:40] these things who cares
[58:45] the thing that they've missed
[58:46] holly
[58:48] they missed the prophecy for their lives
[58:52] too busy trying to put it on somebody
[58:54] else look he said write the vision make
[58:56] it plain and when it speak it will not
[58:59] lie
[59:02] so the vision for your life it will not
[59:04] lie hallelujah
[59:06] oh my that's why i don't waste my time
[59:09] per se trying to defend the message to
[59:11] an unbeliever
[59:13] hallelujah because you got to be a
[59:15] believer to see it amen and furthermore
[59:18] when i defend the message i don't defend
[59:20] it with the bible and with quotes i
[59:22] defended by where i came from
[59:25] i defended by what i used to be
[59:27] hallelujah i'm defeated by my own
[59:29] desires now
[59:31] hallelujah i don't always take the
[59:33] people to jeffersonville and take them
[59:35] back to look no i break into south
[59:37] carolina hallelujah when god took rap
[59:40] music out of my life and sin and lying
[59:42] and cheating and still hallelujah i
[59:45] didn't get that in a pillow across the
[59:46] church i got that sitting right here
[59:49] listening to this message listening to
[59:51] these tapes that said good evening
[59:53] friends hallelujah
[59:55] i am a product of this message
[1:00:01] and i came straight out of the world
[1:00:07] oh my so you young people can't tell me
[1:00:10] that this word ain't true
[1:00:13] you adults of middle age or whoever else
[1:00:15] is playing with their future

[1:00:33] and the schools tucking light
[1:00:35] and they said you know what we're just
[1:00:36] going to dismiss like we normally do
[1:00:39] and they dismiss like they normally do
[1:00:41] and the kids and the bus drivers got
[1:00:43] caught in the snowstorm
[1:00:45] some of them didn't get home to 10
[1:00:47] o'clock that night
[1:00:48] because they wasn't prepared for the
[1:00:50] forecast even though it was already told
[1:00:53] to him
[1:00:55] church what about us are you prepared
[1:00:59] even though the forecast has been told
[1:01:01] to you
[1:01:05] but you know what
[1:01:07] after that you know they say fool me one
[1:01:09] time

[1:01:12] fool me again
[1:01:14] shame on me
[1:01:15] so you know what they did church
[1:01:17] hollywood they just did a couple weeks
[1:01:18] ago they forecast some serious
[1:01:21] thunderstorms they let the kids out 12
[1:01:23] o'clock where i'm from
[1:01:27] and y'all know how colombia is it'll act
[1:01:29] like it wanna come and then they say nah
[1:01:31] i think we're gonna turn
[1:01:34] hallelujah south carolina period
[1:01:36] hallelujah blizzard can be coming he
[1:01:38] could be coming up from atlanta coming
[1:01:39] strong then that thing say ah
[1:01:43] south carolina now we're gonna mess with
[1:01:45] y'all
[1:01:47] go a different way
[1:01:49] and our kids how to experience a free
[1:01:51] day out of school
[1:01:53] but what happened what happened
[1:01:56] the overseers they took the forecast
[1:01:59] seriously
[1:02:01] hallelujah and we are in a time church
[1:02:03] where we need to take these prophecies
[1:02:06] and visions that has some have been
[1:02:08] fulfilled and some are being fulfilled
[1:02:10] seriously
[1:02:13] hallelujah
[1:02:15] church i'll be the first one to say i
[1:02:17] can feel the pool of the world trying to
[1:02:19] get us relaxed
[1:02:22] hallelujah i fight that same spirit
[1:02:24] trying to get me relaxed and just just
[1:02:26] kick back and do your own thing because
[1:02:29] all this is happening in the message and
[1:02:31] all this is happening daddy ain't gonna
[1:02:33] change the forecast
[1:02:35] that ain't going to change the prophecy
[1:02:38] and the visions that god has already put
[1:02:40] in place churches in motion
[1:02:44] the prophet of god said for destruction
[1:02:47] to come the people must be in the
[1:02:49] atmosphere of destruction
[1:02:53] i'm gonna read it to you
[1:02:56] oh my
[1:02:57] hallelujah
[1:03:01] oh my
[1:03:03] church said traders
[1:03:05] heady high minded lovers of pressure
[1:03:08] pleasure more than lovers of god
[1:03:11] indeed he concludes that by saying
[1:03:14] having a form of godliness
[1:03:18] all these people
[1:03:20] are having a form of godliness
[1:03:23] and the probably god said what was that
[1:03:24] form of godliness not willing to go on
[1:03:27] into the holy ghost
[1:03:33] homer
[1:03:36] help us lord
[1:03:39] church i don't want to take the forecast
[1:03:41] lightly
[1:03:43] because he said
[1:03:45] he said to his disciples
[1:03:47] truly
[1:03:50] isaiah's must come
[1:03:52] and then he comes back he says
[1:03:54] and has come already
[1:03:57] and you missed it
[1:04:00] how privileged should we feel hallelujah
[1:04:04] that we can recognize the spirit of
[1:04:06] elijah has come already and we called it
[1:04:12] like one brother told me they left the
[1:04:13] message and i loved the brothers a dear
[1:04:14] brother we sat down and talked and he
[1:04:17] said brother i'm sorry brother i just
[1:04:19] don't believe that brother brandon was a
[1:04:20] prophet and all these things and blah
[1:04:22] blah blah blah blah
[1:04:24] and he said i said well what i said well
[1:04:26] what was the purpose of who else who is
[1:04:29] elijah then
[1:04:31] i say who's fulfilling the scripture of
[1:04:33] our hearts being turned back
[1:04:35] he said well he said i believe john did
[1:04:37] all that i said couldn't be
[1:04:39] because god deals with shadows and types
[1:04:41] hallelujah because if john fulfilled all
[1:04:44] that it'll be no purpose for jesus to
[1:04:46] come
[1:04:51] hallelujah
[1:04:52] because a prophet always introduces
[1:04:55] something greater
[1:04:56] hallelujah and if john fulfilled it all
[1:04:59] john would have went to the cross
[1:05:01] and that would be lit for us hallelujah
[1:05:03] but john only preached repentance
[1:05:09] hallelujah and john died the death of a
[1:05:13] regular man
[1:05:16] oh yeah
[1:05:18] but then he introduced us into something
[1:05:20] and by john's old testimony john could
[1:05:23] see the forecast changing
[1:05:25] hallelujah they said john are you the
[1:05:27] messiah john said no hallelujah
[1:05:30] i'm just the voice of one crying out in
[1:05:32] the wilderness he knew what he was in
[1:05:35] the prophecy
[1:05:37] do you know who you are in the prophecy
[1:05:42] he could find that word that identified
[1:05:44] him and nobody could take it
[1:05:47] and he didn't live his life in fear
[1:05:49] either
[1:05:52] john said there's one coming
[1:05:54] whose shoelaces
[1:05:55] i'm not even worthy to unlatch you
[1:05:58] he said i'll tell you something else
[1:06:00] he's already here
[1:06:03] y'all just can't reckon
[1:06:07] y'all just can't recognize it hallelujah
[1:06:09] that's why we had a prophet to come and
[1:06:11] say if god does something one way that's
[1:06:14] his forever way and our john came and
[1:06:17] revealed jesus to us and everybody
[1:06:19] around still couldn't recognize it
[1:06:23] because our god is the same but blessed
[1:06:26] are ye because you see and you hear
[1:06:30] blessed are ye hallelujah because you
[1:06:32] are a part of the prophecy
[1:06:36] the only reason why we're here amen
[1:06:38] because we are part of the message
[1:06:41] we are what makes the message come out
[1:06:44] wow
[1:06:46] i feel my helper coming on bro jason wow
[1:06:52] hallelujah
[1:06:53] i feel like i'm riding one of them bugs
[1:06:55] with them
[1:06:58] big old horse a big old hump in his back
[1:07:00] but he can't throw me tonight i was born
[1:07:03] to ride
[1:07:04] hollywood
[1:07:08] said i'll ride this trail again not him
[1:07:10] as a man hallelujah but the message will
[1:07:13] ride that trail again
[1:07:15] hallelujah
[1:07:17] we rising right now church
[1:07:22] catch the forecast
[1:07:26] i ain't gonna say it's gonna rain
[1:07:29] but it's gonna rain down fire
[1:07:32] that's our forecast
[1:07:36] but i'm so glad
[1:07:38] prophecy concerning my life says i won't
[1:07:41] be here

[1:08:05] dimension hallelujah because i'm being
[1:08:08] dressed by god's dress where which is
[1:08:10] what he said a five-fold ministry
[1:08:16] he's getting us ready
[1:08:18] church
[1:08:20] do we
[1:08:22] i know y'all feel what i feel
[1:08:24] this stuff shouldn't be coming to us
[1:08:27] but it should excite us
[1:08:29] honey we know it's going to happen
[1:08:31] we know what the next day beholds
[1:08:34] god has shown us his eyes he's so listen
[1:08:37] have we ever heard a prophet say talk
[1:08:39] about god in the back part of his mind
[1:08:45] oh my
[1:08:47] oh
[1:08:49] what a
[1:08:50] meteorologist
[1:08:52] listen
[1:08:54] i don't want to be alone but i'm
[1:08:56] i'm feeling good
[1:08:58] let's get into it a little bit before i
[1:09:00] close
[1:09:01] hey man i'm gonna start
[1:09:04] i'm sure most of you know that the
[1:09:06] prophet has seven visions
[1:09:09] 1933
[1:09:12] that's when god gave him those major
[1:09:14] seven visions
[1:09:15] holy
[1:09:16] concerning
[1:09:17] the
[1:09:18] forecast
[1:09:20] not just for church but the world
[1:09:24] hollywood
[1:09:25] he gave forecasts for nations honey
[1:09:28] he gave forecasts for countries wow
[1:09:32] and he gave the forecast for where we at
[1:09:34] america
[1:09:37] oh my
[1:09:38] listen
[1:09:40] if i can start right i ain't going to
[1:09:41] read all of them but i'ma start
[1:09:43] i believe this is the second vision
[1:09:45] he says
[1:09:46] if y'all got a brother he says the next
[1:09:48] vision
[1:09:49] foretold
[1:09:51] that an australian by the name of adolf
[1:09:54] hitler
[1:09:56] austrian i'm sorry
[1:09:59] see i'm excited i'm messing up my words
[1:10:00] my daughter gone my daughter gonna get
[1:10:02] on me when we get in the car
[1:10:04] you were saying media geologists

[1:10:18] hear
[1:10:19] hallelujah

[1:10:23] y'all know
[1:10:25] a austrian
[1:10:27] name adolf hitler
[1:10:29] now most of us know who that is
[1:10:32] but look
[1:10:34] god gave a forecast of him before he
[1:10:37] even got in position
[1:10:39] got to him
[1:10:41] and i wasn't even born then
[1:10:44] but the same person that had a forecast
[1:10:47] for my day forecast this
[1:10:50] so the reason why i'm bringing this up
[1:10:51] is because this came to pass
[1:10:56] did not
[1:10:57] germany start a war harley did not
[1:11:00] germany hallelujah the leader of the
[1:11:03] germans thought that the germans was the
[1:11:05] greatest race
[1:11:06] hallelujah and i'm sad to say hallelujah
[1:11:09] well i'm not sad to say i'm proud to say
[1:11:11] hallelujah that when they had the
[1:11:13] olympics god use a black man named jesse
[1:11:16] owens that i'ma show you hallelujah that
[1:11:18] the german race is not the superior race
[1:11:22] wow
[1:11:24] hallelujah and i got i got holly on the
[1:11:26] books church hallelujah i got something
[1:11:29] on the books i got a forecast on the
[1:11:31] books where the prophet said that a
[1:11:33] white man will never get in the areas a
[1:11:36] black man can get into
[1:11:46] hallelujah
[1:11:47] and he proved it with jesse always
[1:11:49] hallelujah jesus started running hardly
[1:11:52] started running hallelujah in that day
[1:11:54] he won one gold medal
[1:11:57] he won two gold medals three gold medals
[1:11:59] he walked away with six gold medals
[1:12:02] prove it to hitler you started this war
[1:12:04] but we gonna finish it
[1:12:14] but y'all know in heaven
[1:12:16] is only one race
[1:12:18] harley the bride of christ
[1:12:21] hallelujah
[1:12:22] he says look
[1:12:24] he will rise up as a dictator over
[1:12:26] germany harley do you realize church i
[1:12:29] was listening to these prophecies and in
[1:12:31] one place he talked about for america
[1:12:33] that a woman would rise up in power
[1:12:34] hallelujah y'all know who controlling
[1:12:36] germany
[1:12:39] a woman that rose up in power
[1:12:41] he said the letter of c in age is women
[1:12:44] rights church i looked it up who are the
[1:12:47] most 10 most powerful women i mean
[1:12:49] people aren't in the world today and she
[1:12:52] was number three
[1:12:57] it wasn't based upon how much money they
[1:12:59] got hallelujah because jeff bezos was
[1:13:02] behind her
[1:13:03] and he's a billionaire
[1:13:10] you better hope you ain't living in
[1:13:12] ladder to see you
[1:13:16] i hope you catching that
[1:13:19] listen he says oh my almost well i'm out
[1:13:21] of time okay
[1:13:23] he says
[1:13:24] he says that he had drawn the world into
[1:13:26] war
[1:13:27] it showed
[1:13:28] that the siegfried line and how our
[1:13:30] troops would have a terrible time to
[1:13:33] overcome it
[1:13:34] then it showed that hitler would come to
[1:13:37] a mysterious end
[1:13:40] is that prophecy
[1:13:44] go find it in the library it'll be
[1:13:45] exactly like the prophet said
[1:13:50] oh my
[1:13:51] let's keep going
[1:13:53] this is the third he said the third
[1:13:55] vision
[1:13:56] was in the realm of the world politics
[1:13:58] for it
[1:13:59] shows that there will be three isms
[1:14:02] fascism nazism uh
[1:14:04] communism
[1:14:05] but that the first two will be swallowed
[1:14:08] up in the third
[1:14:09] the voice admonish watch russia where
[1:14:13] are we
[1:14:15] where are we church
[1:14:17] everybody's watching russia
[1:14:20] holly
[1:14:21] you know who number two was on that list
[1:14:24] putin
[1:14:28] and i know they make different lists but
[1:14:30] on my list he was number two
[1:14:33] as one of the most powerful people in
[1:14:35] the world
[1:14:37] and we got a prophet streaming out at
[1:14:39] our forecast saying watch russia
[1:14:44] everybody got the eyes on russia right
[1:14:45] now what are we church we're living in
[1:14:48] the prophecy
[1:14:50] remember my title prophecy will or
[1:14:54] already has come to pass
[1:14:59] oh my
[1:15:01] watch russia keep your eye on the king
[1:15:04] of the north
[1:15:05] and this man is he's so special
[1:15:10] i don't mean in a good way
[1:15:13] he's so special every time it's time for
[1:15:15] him it's his time to come to get voted
[1:15:17] out he changed the laws
[1:15:21] basically saying i'm gonna die in this
[1:15:23] office church i even heard that they
[1:15:26] have a bounty on his head but nobody
[1:15:27] can't get to him
[1:15:33] now you put a man in the office like
[1:15:34] that
[1:15:35] what if he just gets mad and just say
[1:15:37] you know i'm sick of everybody
[1:15:41] i'm sick of it
[1:15:44] he's built that way to do what
[1:15:47] push your butt
[1:15:48] just like the prophet said
[1:15:53] i don't i don't know the man all i'm
[1:15:54] going by is prophecy
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:15:58] all i'm going about is the
[1:15:59] characteristics of this forecast being
[1:16:02] fulfilled
[1:16:04] hallelujah he says keep your eyes on the
[1:16:07] king of the north
[1:16:08] now we're going to get into some sticky
[1:16:10] water
[1:16:11] hardly
[1:16:12] the fourth vision shows
[1:16:14] the great advances in science
[1:16:16] that will come after the second world
[1:16:18] war it will head up
[1:16:21] in a vision of a plastic bubble top car
[1:16:26] put that tesla up for me
[1:16:32] hmm that that kind of looks like a
[1:16:35] bubble shaped car doing it
[1:16:39] but i want you to catch the detail of
[1:16:41] the prophecy
[1:16:43] he said plastic
[1:16:46] cars are not made metal anymore
[1:16:50] they're made by fiberglass
[1:16:53] most of all our cars out there the only
[1:16:54] thing metal ones might be the bumper
[1:16:57] you notice i said might be
[1:16:59] and probably you the only one y'all with
[1:17:01] trucks probably the only ones got real
[1:17:03] bumpers
[1:17:05] mostly everything now is
[1:17:06] church look i used to take up i used to
[1:17:09] be a um

[1:17:16] church you know i'm gonna give you a
[1:17:19] secret i'm gonna get you sick i'm gonna
[1:17:20] make the auto collision people mad

[1:17:45] heat it up put your hand on the opposite
[1:17:47] end and push it out

[1:27:04] perversion and more more apply to the
[1:27:07] whole world that's where we are at
[1:27:09] church
[1:27:10] what used to be wrong is considered okay
[1:27:13] in right now
[1:27:15] holly i was in seattle a couple weeks
[1:27:17] ago they got marijuana dispensaries on
[1:27:19] every corner you pull up like a
[1:27:21] drive-through let me get something to
[1:27:22] smoke
[1:27:30] oh boy marla decay is here but this is
[1:27:32] the church they legalize it but they
[1:27:34] know they can't control it
[1:27:38] it's all about this
[1:27:40] moral decay
[1:27:43] listen
[1:27:44] this is in the message of the revelation
[1:27:46] of jesus christ he said look at the
[1:27:48] prophecy the lord gave me in 33 how it
[1:27:50] would happen they permit women to vote
[1:27:53] in the voting they elect the wrong
[1:27:54] person seven things was going to give
[1:27:57] five of them has already happened this
[1:27:59] is in 1960
[1:28:02] five of them has already happened church
[1:28:04] you know what we can say now six
[1:28:06] has already happened
[1:28:10] oh my
[1:28:12] he said the next thing was a great woman
[1:28:15] a church a power or something will take
[1:28:18] over the united states now i know this
[1:28:20] seems elementary church but let's
[1:28:22] remember
[1:28:24] it's been spoken
[1:28:25] for us to hear
[1:28:28] give me that picture
[1:28:30] of that powerful woman
[1:28:35] you got people want to argue about this
[1:28:38] like it didn't happen
[1:28:40] let's make it real simple
[1:28:42] he said
[1:28:43] a woman or the catholic church right
[1:28:47] let me ask you a question
[1:28:49] if something happens to joe biden who's
[1:28:51] going to take over
[1:28:55] and joe biden was i think number five on
[1:28:58] the list
[1:29:00] so if carmilla takes over you know where
[1:29:02] she'll be number five
[1:29:05] as one of the most powerful people in
[1:29:07] the world
[1:29:08] holy and just in case you don't realize
[1:29:11] it that prophecy even of her has already
[1:29:14] come to pass
[1:29:16] because when joe biden got sick who was
[1:29:18] running the country
[1:29:27] stay with me church
[1:29:29] hallelujah people trying to get some
[1:29:31] spirit out he's here
[1:29:36] and stuff happening right before our
[1:29:38] eyes
[1:29:40] and we want to get so technical and so
[1:29:42] spiritual trying to prove everybody
[1:29:43] wrong when the prophecy is being
[1:29:45] fulfilled
[1:29:49] but if if not her
[1:29:51] what's next put it up brother
[1:29:55] there you go
[1:29:57] the catholic church
[1:30:01] and he said hallelujah we've had one
[1:30:03] president that was a catholic we got to
[1:30:05] have another one what was joe biden
[1:30:08] catholic
[1:30:09] church before he took the office what
[1:30:12] did he do he went to mask
[1:30:16] basically putting the country in the
[1:30:18] hands of the pope
[1:30:21] oh my
[1:30:23] church we are here living in the
[1:30:25] forecast
[1:30:29] do not be dismayed
[1:30:32] by how comfortable it is to be in this
[1:30:34] united states there are things happening
[1:30:37] right before our eyes concerning the
[1:30:39] word of god
[1:30:41] concerning the prophecies of malachi 4.
[1:30:45] that's why the enemy is fighting it so
[1:30:46] hard
[1:30:48] church
[1:30:49] that's number six
[1:30:52] fulfilled
[1:30:58] let's do that again
[1:31:03] hallelujah
[1:31:05] but what i love about it
[1:31:08] what i love about it
[1:31:11] is that the weather couldn't trick me
[1:31:15] holly cause i was ready for it
[1:31:21] church we can't be tricked
[1:31:24] because we already know what's going to
[1:31:25] happen before it happened
[1:31:27] they say oh my god obama's the
[1:31:29] antichrist nope
[1:31:32] i got a prophecy already
[1:31:34] telling me who the antichrist is

[1:31:40] i got a prophecy hallelujah that's
[1:31:43] fulfilling hallelujah who it is

[1:31:56] revealed i'm not walking in 12 feet 12
[1:31:59] inches of snow in adidas no i got the
[1:32:02] right kind of boots on

[1:32:10] we're here blessed are you for your i
[1:32:14] see
[1:32:16] oh my tree
[1:32:18] church what i'm doing so brothers what
[1:32:20] this is all about i'm trying just trying
[1:32:22] i'm trying to
[1:32:23] make you aware
[1:32:25] where you're at
[1:32:28] because you don't want to be
[1:32:30] like one of our great friends
[1:32:33] holly we love them we appreciate them
[1:32:37] and our ex brother editors
[1:32:38] hardly i say this all the time
[1:32:41] one time i was out there preaching for
[1:32:42] him i say brother here
[1:32:44] we know he was a part of the forecast
[1:32:48] but he wasn't ready for it
[1:32:52] he was a part of the forecast
[1:32:54] and didn't even know it was raining
[1:32:59] he was a part of the forecast and
[1:33:01] couldn't even see it coming
[1:33:04] basically said i'm not a part of it
[1:33:08] because the meteorologist asked him are
[1:33:10] you dressed
[1:33:12] he said no
[1:33:14] but he had it that's what i love about
[1:33:16] god
[1:33:18] you may not know it but god gonna make
[1:33:20] sure you don't miss it because if you're
[1:33:22] supposed to be there in the rain you gon
[1:33:24] get wet
[1:33:27] hallelujah if you're supposed to be
[1:33:29] there when the hurricane comes you gonna
[1:33:31] be there hallelujah and that's brother
[1:33:33] they asked her brother ed when when the
[1:33:35] prophet gave when he told you all about
[1:33:37] the caribou and the silver temp well
[1:33:38] y'all back like oh boy i can't wait till
[1:33:40] it happened he said no man was just a
[1:33:42] bunch of young guys ready to hunt
[1:33:44] yeah
[1:33:47] wasn't even thinking about the forecast
[1:33:49] holly
[1:33:51] but i love god holly
[1:33:53] i love god so much
[1:33:55] you cannot hardly understand that you
[1:33:57] are part of it but he'll make sure you
[1:33:59] in the place you're supposed to be in
[1:34:04] because the prophet said hallelujah
[1:34:06] after he had gotten the caribou order
[1:34:08] simple till one of the two he said now
[1:34:10] who got on that green checkered shirt
[1:34:12] and he turned around he said eddie look
[1:34:14] at the shirt you got on there like oh my
[1:34:16] god i'm a part of the vision
[1:34:21] hallelujah
[1:34:23] church don't be like that praise god we
[1:34:26] love hey man what god has done to those
[1:34:28] people on books and tapes but we should
[1:34:30] be more aware
[1:34:33] we should be more aware we should be
[1:34:35] watching hallelujah these signs and
[1:34:37] these wonders and these things being
[1:34:38] fulfilled hallelujah church we even got
[1:34:41] a message to back it up he preached
[1:34:43] modern day events fulfilled by prophecy
[1:34:51] hallelujah
[1:34:53] oh my
[1:34:54] hold my church
[1:34:56] but what we should be
[1:35:00] and what we are
[1:35:02] amen in my closing
[1:35:05] is a rebecca
[1:35:07] hallelujah
[1:35:09] because eliza went out to get a bride
[1:35:12] and he knew in his own human ability
[1:35:15] he couldn't choose right for his lord
[1:35:18] so what did he do
[1:35:20] he spoke
[1:35:22] a vision
[1:35:24] he spoke something he he wanted to see
[1:35:27] fulfilled and by that word he knew she
[1:35:30] was the one
[1:35:33] by that word he knew she was the one and
[1:35:37] what did you say let the woman
[1:35:39] that not only gives me drink but also
[1:35:42] give my camel's drink
[1:35:44] be my servant be my my master's wife be
[1:35:47] the one harley
[1:35:49] and the scripture says as soon as he
[1:35:51] gave the forecast
[1:35:53] hallelujah rebecca came out to the whale
[1:35:56] hallelujah she came out with her water
[1:35:58] pot you know what she was doing she was
[1:36:00] minding her own business hallelujah but
[1:36:02] she didn't even know unconsciously she
[1:36:04] was fulfilling the prophet's vision
[1:36:07] hallelujah because you know eliezer was
[1:36:10] a type of the prophet hallelujah william
[1:36:12] branham amen
[1:36:13] hallelujah did i say this all the time
[1:36:16] let's run it down hallelujah abraham was
[1:36:19] types out god the father eliezer types
[1:36:22] out brother branham amen hallelujah
[1:36:25] isaac types out jesus christ rebecca
[1:36:27] types out who
[1:36:33] i hope you going to the well tonight
[1:36:36] i
[1:36:46] and this woman was so special
[1:36:48] when she went out there hurry but jason
[1:36:51] she took the water pot not even
[1:36:53] realizing she's fulfilling the vision
[1:36:56] hallelujah got the pot holly and the
[1:36:59] prophets just sit back watching what he
[1:37:01] spoke unveiled
[1:37:03] holy
[1:37:04] the mystery of christ unveiled
[1:37:07] wow
[1:37:09] hallelujah and it's just being unveiled
[1:37:12] right before his eyes hallelujah and she
[1:37:14] grabs the pot and the scripture says she
[1:37:16] made haste
[1:37:18] she wasn't dragging around she wasn't
[1:37:20] caught up in ladder to see her sit back
[1:37:23] cooling
[1:37:24] lost in the sauce
[1:37:27] but she was working hard cause the
[1:37:29] scripture says his wife has made herself
[1:37:32] ready
[1:37:34] oh my
[1:37:35] church and then
[1:37:36] this is what i love
[1:37:38] she was so in tune to that vision
[1:37:41] she wasn't looking at how hard the
[1:37:43] journey was
[1:37:44] she wasn't looking at how hard the next
[1:37:46] step was she just stepped into it
[1:37:49] as soon as she finished with him she
[1:37:50] moved into the camel ministry
[1:37:54] i hope y'all understand you got a camel
[1:37:56] ministry
[1:37:58] hallelujah cause he said that power that
[1:38:01] she gave water to with that same power
[1:38:03] that was going to take her to her lord
[1:38:06] i hope you understand you got academy a
[1:38:09] camel ministry and that ministry is a
[1:38:12] ministry of strength
[1:38:14] hallelujah
[1:38:15] churches she gets down there and she
[1:38:17] gives them water holly now let's make it
[1:38:19] plain holly holly you know what sister

[1:38:37] water
[1:38:39] so she kept making trips
[1:38:42] until the camel was satisfied
[1:38:45] but let me show you how special she was
[1:38:48] that's why i like reading about joshua
[1:38:50] he says be strong and of a good courage
[1:38:53] that's who this bride is she's strong
[1:38:55] enough of a good courage church
[1:38:57] hallelujah she gave that camel what he
[1:38:59] wanted 20 gallons
[1:39:01] but what made her so special
[1:39:03] there were nine more
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:08] so that day
[1:39:10] she issued out 200 gallons of water

[1:39:21] the word

[1:49:43] oh my i'm so glad tonight my eyes
[1:49:46] have been opened by the lord jesus are
[1:49:48] you glad are we at church that could say
[1:49:51] lord i'm thankful for eyes that can see
[1:49:55] thankful for ears
[1:49:57] i can hear
[1:49:58] thankful lord that you didn't just come
[1:50:00] and send a word
[1:50:01] and didn't just hear it with my physical
[1:50:03] ears or see it with my own eyes might
[1:50:05] not even have been in the meetings
[1:50:08] we weren't none of us except for my
[1:50:10] grandmother here tonight that i think
[1:50:12] would be the only one who were there
[1:50:13] physically to see it
[1:50:15] never with my own eyes never with my own
[1:50:17] ears but i heard a voice
[1:50:21] that voice contacted
[1:50:23] way beyond my ear way beyond in my
[1:50:25] intelligence
[1:50:26] and it went down and struck a seed that
[1:50:28] god put there before the foundation of
[1:50:30] the world and i'm here today because god
[1:50:35] sent a
[1:50:36] voice oh you ought to give god a hand
[1:50:39] clap of praise just for that hallelujah
[1:50:43] amen
[1:50:46] hallelujah
[1:50:48] we ought never to take that for granted
[1:50:50] amen i think we do sometimes but i think
[1:50:52] we ought to never take that for granted
[1:50:55] that the lord sent us a vindicated voice
[1:50:58] so that we wouldn't be in confusion we
[1:51:00] wouldn't there wouldn't be distortions
[1:51:02] and maybe this and maybe that but god
[1:51:04] sent a clear word a more sure word of
[1:51:07] prophecy you know when jesus said whom
[1:51:09] who who did you out to see speaking of
[1:51:12] john brother diggs you spoke on there
[1:51:14] and and jesus says who did you go out to
[1:51:17] see uh you know a reed shaken in the
[1:51:19] wind a prophet
[1:51:22] a prophet
[1:51:23] jesus said yea and i say unto you
[1:51:26] more than a prophet
[1:51:28] you know why jesus said john was more
[1:51:31] than just a prophet because prophets had
[1:51:33] prophesied
[1:51:34] prophets had given prophecy jeremiah was
[1:51:36] a prophet amos was a prophet named micah
[1:51:39] had we had prophets before but there
[1:51:42] were two there was one main reason why
[1:51:43] john was more than a prophet
[1:51:46] because there was a word spoken about
[1:51:49] john a prophecy about john
[1:51:52] and john was ju not just a prophet but
[1:51:55] john was the word that prophecy made
[1:51:58] flesh
[1:52:00] and jesus says behold i say unto you
[1:52:02] that there's never been a man born of a
[1:52:04] woman greater than john
[1:52:07] and my my goodness john what did he do
[1:52:09] he stood in between
[1:52:11] a dispensation of law and welcomed the
[1:52:14] dispensation of grace friend let me just
[1:52:16] be plain we received more than just a
[1:52:19] prophet brother branham was just more he
[1:52:20] was more than just a prophet he was an
[1:52:23] angel messenger who the bible spoke of
[1:52:26] and we've received that word this word
[1:52:29] made flesh
[1:52:30] came with a vindicated melchizedek sign
[1:52:33] what did we receive in this generation
[1:52:35] it was the a son of man revealing the
[1:52:37] son of man
[1:52:39] amen i'm glad that my eyes have seen
[1:52:41] that i've heard more than just stories
[1:52:43] and good stories and good preaching
[1:52:46] people hear good preaching we heard it
[1:52:47] brother branham had a lot of a lot of
[1:52:49] good stories a lot of good hunting
[1:52:50] stories a lot of good preaching but i
[1:52:52] heard more than just a sermon i heard my
[1:52:55] my i heard uh brother dick spoke on
[1:52:57] rebecca and isaac i heard mine
[1:53:00] hey man i heard my voice i i seen my
[1:53:02] name identified in rebecca
[1:53:04] and i'm watering that word brother
[1:53:06] branham said that camel
[1:53:07] brother diggs preached it was that beast
[1:53:09] that was going to lead her to horizons
[1:53:12] and brother branham said what do you do

[1:53:16] watered that camel you water this word
[1:53:18] with your praise with your faith with
[1:53:21] your prayers i say lord let me water it
