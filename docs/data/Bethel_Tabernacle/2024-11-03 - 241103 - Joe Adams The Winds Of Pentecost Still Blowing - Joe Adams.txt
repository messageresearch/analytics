amen when we greet you this morning it's wonderful to be in his presence you know I was telling the church the other day it's one thing to be in church but it's another thing to be in his presence you can be in his church and come in and go out and come in and go out and never be changed but there's not one time you can walk into his presence and ever remain the same and I believe you have done your part this morning as a congregation and set an atmosphere to where he's here he's here not just brother Joe or brother Jason or brother Tony or any of the song specials but he is here in our midst and when he is here Supernatural things can take place when he is here chains can fall off when he is here lives can be retransformed so we just thank the Lord for that this morning brother Jason thank you for the invitation I know it's been a few years but you know your pastor doesn't just have anybody stand behind this desk not just anybody but a man that he has confidence in so I I take that with high regard and thankful for the opportunity and to be here to share what the Lord has put on our heart I will say I've been up since 6:30 this morning studying seeking the mind of God for the service today I've wrestled through different thoughts different things seems like Satan's trying to come and block the blessing but I believe we rested this morning on a thought and we want to look into that this morning but as we do uh bring you greetings from our pastor brother Tim the Saints there even like Tabernacle we just want to go to him in prayer as we turn before we turn to John 14 but father how we thank you today Lord Lord we thank you for your presence we feel you so near right now thank you for the charge of the Holy Spirit Lord that we're not just another Pentecost Lord that just gets emotional with song but Lord there's a word that's charging our hearts Lord there's a life that's behind that word and behind every song a life behind every special Lord that just encourages us oh God and Lord we're so thankful for this message you've given us in this day thank you for that deposit of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Lord and Lord thank you for all that you are doing and all that you have done and we know father that you ever remain the same and even when we're not faithful you remain faithful Lord and I'm asking today Father you will remain faithful to the needs of your people God you saw the burdens in which they brought into this building this morning and I know that you're a mindful God I know you're able to take your subject your Your Vessel this morning and move him off of his notes and Lord like a surgeon's hand begin to cut and begin to minister and begin to deal with that heart that need that situation so father we invite you not just me as the speaker but we as the hearer as well we invite you to perform the operation this morning amen may you get all the glory all the honor Lord for everything that will be spoken today May it not be from a man's thought from a man's intellect but it may be from the inspiration of the holy spirit for we ask at this morning in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we're going to look here in John 14 and: 16 John 14 and verse 16 now this passage here through Verse 18 is actually the promise of the Holy Ghost so we kind of want to pick up on that this morning I'm going look at here says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter what a promise amen I will pray to the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in You Verse 18 I will not leave you comfortless what you say brother Joe went Le I will not leave you comforter brother Joe you don't understand what I'm going through I will not leave you comfor you don't understand what's going on in my family what's going on in my marriage it does not matter I will not leave you comers I will come to you amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning also want to pick up here in the book of Acts chapter 1 and verse one book of Acts chapter 1 and verse one I want to speak to you this morning on the Winds of Pentecost still blow I don't know if y'all heard that this morning the Winds of Pentecost still blow we're not talking about isua we're talking about the real deal The Winds of Pentecost still blowing and we find here in Acts 1 and verse one says a former treaties have I made o theopus all that Jesus began both to do and to teach until the day in which he was taken up after he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord will thou this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be a witness unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and under to the uttermost parts of the earth so we want to take this thought just for a little bit this morning thank you sir when I look here and think about this The Winds of Pentecost still blowing we find in John 14 there's a promise of the Holy Spirit that's given to us even into this hour and the age and we're living in and we look here in uh acts 1 and verse 8 the Bible says you shall receive power that word power is the word dunamus that means power to perform Miracles it's an inherit power and that word inherit there means it's a permanent power it's not like a power when one man gives you a power and authority and just a few days later he can remove that power and authority from you but it's an inherent power it's a permanent power it's a permanent Authority and we find here that God says or Jesus tell us I'm going to give you power damous power power to perform Miracles let me tell you the god that we serve is not some weak God that he doesn't have the ability to do what he says he will do and some of us here this morning we may have situations that may seem just a little bit too big for us as humans to handle maybe a little bit impossible maybe we have children that are wavered we have situations that are gone to around but I want you to know he will do what he says he will do because he's the same yesterday today and forever but notice they had to be in back in the book of Acts 2 and verse one it says when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one Accord in one place they wasn't complaining they wern't bickering they wern't fussing they wern't stewing over little different things but we find today amongst the ranks of the messes you know we're debating over ideas right we're debating over what brother brandham said and what he meant by this and what he meant by that and how this one received this and how one looks at this but the Bible says they were in one mind and one Accord there's a 120 men and women up you think they all thought just alike come on come on some how many of you are married this morning don't be afraid to raise your hand you and your husband or you and your wife don't see eye to eye on everything but you're still married you're still in the same house and we find here they're not up there bickering about that do Peter may have had different ideas and though John may have had different ideas though Mary may have had different ideas look their different ideas didn't make him any less a Believer their different ideas didn't make him any less a a son and daughter of God their own ideas didn't make him any less a brother or sister it made them human and your ideas make you human this morning but they were in one mind they were in one Accord they knew we were going somewhere and we're going to wait until the power of the Holy Ghost came let me tell you church we may have different ideas this morning we may had different doctrinal beliefs this morning but we must be in one mind that he is coming and when he comes I'm leaving I said when he comes I'm leaving god notice here they had an expectation for the baptism of the Holy Ghost their ideas may have varied they didn't see everything exactly the same but they did agree on one thing I don't think personally me I don't believe that we as a message Community as preachers and ministers pastors evangelists I don't think we're ever going to see everything exactly the same there's groups here that believe one thing and there's groups that believe maybe something else now I'm not talking about false teaching I'm not talking about false Doctrine I'm just talking about the doctrines that we agree on we may not agree exactly the same and we find here that in our Humanity we will allow these disagreements and we'll allow these variances to cause separation brother Jason and I was not too long ago I was preaching somewhere I didn't I didn't know what the the the brothers believed and I preached what I what I believed and felt led to preach it well you know I didn't realize but a few months later they had a holy Concord Wonder should we let this brother preach anymore in our churches wow you know it reminds me of brother B we were just listening to it the other day the godhead explained brother B talked about these brothers they were splitting hairs over baptism in Jesus name or father son Holy Ghost and one of the brothers he come to brother brand he said that man you had a sinner on your platform this evening he says what do you mean a sinner he's a he's a Pentecostal preacher he's a Oneness preacher he said that you know he was baptized wrong therefore he was a sinner he said brother Brandon we're going to draw you out of our Circle but you know what a prophet of God did he said you can't draw me out because I'll draw another Circle and draw you back in what about us as a message Community taking that same kind of approach instead of kicking and men to the curve because they don't see it all eye to eye and we may believe but what about the life behind the individual what about the life behind it how we want to split hairs and disagree we're always not going to see everything out of eye but my goodness can't we see that God's coming for a people can't we be a people that'll draw a circle a little bit bigger sir somebody want to draw you out cuz you don't see it his way or her way just draw a bigger Circle draw them back in welcome them back in but notice the Bible says in Acts 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place amen now we're all here this morning we're not all in one Accord just yet on but we're in one place all right can I get a smile on some of you yeah we're going to get you in one Accord for us so with Lord willing and the Bible says and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind let me just say this this is not some little gentle breeze that lows you asleep M was a rushing Mighty this word rushing there it suggests force and speed is a mighty win a forceable win and the word there means Breath of Life so here they are 120 Believers in an upper room doing what Jesus told them to do but all of a sudden they were in one mind one Accord waiting for the power of the spirit of God to come and suddenly there came a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind it was a powerful wind it had force behind it cuz when they walked out of there brother George they didn't walk out the same that they came in they walked out different they walked out sealed they walked out filled with the Holy Ghost they met the rushing Mighty Wind of Pentecost and the Winds of Pentecost begin to blow and it didn't stop blowing in the upper room it didn't stop blowing on the day of Pentecost when they walked out they staggered like drunk men and the Bible said 3,000 were added to them like that but we find today we want to cut the winds off we're afraid of the Winds of Pentecost or let me say it like this we're ashamed we're ashamed you know we didn't got so dignified in this message out let me just tell you y'all just saw an undignified preacher last night some of y'all that were here you saw me jerking and quirking and then you saw me dancing and then you know hey I want to give God everything amen but we find here notice this wind was not just a gentle breeze but it was a mighty force and I believe when God comes into your life he's going to do something he's not going to lower you to sleep you sit on a church pew and you just nod your head fight to stay awake come on come on church but no he's going to come in with Force because he wants to change who you are and Jesus tells us in John 11:25 Jesus said unto her he speaking to a lady here he says I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live in verse 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die believest thou this do we still believe this today as a message Community do we still believe this today as Believers and we find in John 14:26 Jesus said unto him I am the way I am the truth and the life right so when we look at Pentecost and the the word wi here means a breath of life we can take it back to John 14 and realize this was nothing but Jesus coming inside coming there the Breath of Life the word of life the way of life the truth of life and he's coming to do what impart his life to the believer and I believe that's what he wants to do in the believing people today that's why we have us camps that's why we had special meetings that's why we have church services so the Winds of Pentecost can blow in and blow the trash out of our Lives God to come in and you know but we have to welcome it yes so on the day of Pentecost brother BR would say the logos was dividing himself among the people exactly the logos the word was dividing himself so it wasn't Peter are these great men and you know we we we tend to hold certain men up on certain pedestals but it's not great men it's the holy spirit so notice here this was not just a power to perform Miracles that they received but it was a power to believe the full word of God right right to live a Victorious Life to Live above sin live free from sin nature this was a power to believe for your prodal see the very same life that was in Jesus was now being divided among the 120 amen and I will say this today we have the blessing of Pentecost it's not it's not something of yesterday but I believe this message brother Jason this message introduced us to Jesus Christ he said well brother Joe what about those in Pentecost didn't they get the Holy Ghost I believe they had a touch of the Holy Ghost I believe they had a form of the Holy Ghost but to say that they had the person of the Holy Ghost i' say I I have to disagree because why else would the message need to come I believe God sent a message in this hour if Pentecost was orza was the finality of the word then why did God have to send the prophet to turn the hearts of the people God sent a prophet to turn the hearts of the people to introduce to you once again the same life the same power the same anointing the same Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in Bride form so God had to send a message he had to send a message and notice it can't come in any other age it couldn't come in any other generation it come now he shows who you are it's come to you it come knocking on your door he Reveals His word to you not just a letter cuz men had the letter down through many ages and the letter kth but the spirit is what gives life but in our day in this day we have a message from God and this message endues us with a supernatural power you young kids this message works just as well for you as it does Mama and Dad this message will get you young boys to turn off that computer screen when you're tempted to look at things you shouldn't look at it'll do the same for you young girls get your head out of those Love Story magazines and fanze about how it's going to be no this message will turn you back to the truth the talents of the word and give you a holy conscience give you a thinking man's filter it'll do it for you it's done it for many of us has it done it for you brother Jason has it done it for you brother Brad brother Luther let me tell you young people this message Works what the Baptist Church couldn't do what the Pentecostal Church couldn't do look I walked through the Baptist Church I sat through the Pentecostal church and what it couldn't do when I came to this message let me tell you the Winds of Pentecost blew in and it blew the trash out of my life and it changed me let me tell you brother gide I've never had one desire to go back not one desire to go back brother George I never desire to go back to drinking back dep parted I don't wake up every day wishing I could go back now because it works it works I'm here to tell you it works and if you will let the Winds of Pentecost blow across your heart this morning it'll do the same thing for you whatever your need is it'll blow there it'll move it'll repair a marriage let me tell you when the shrinks can't repair the marriage when the doctors can't repair the marriage you let the Holy Ghost get a hold of that couple it'll repair the marriage brother B would tell us this he says now this is in the Ephesian Church age he goes now if in fact it might be called the Keystone of the B Bible it's the Revelation that God never changes if you don't get anything out of this message this morning I want you to get that God never changes what he was he is and what he did he does did you hear me what he was he is and what he did he still does so he says now it's the Revelation that God never changes and that's his ways are all unchangeable as he is then he goes into Hebrews 138 and that's our famous scripture Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Ecclesiastes 3 and verse1 14 I know that whosoever God or whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which has been is now and that which is to be hath already been see God doesn't change you know what men change ideas change politics change churches change but God's word never changes and if it was the the truth at the beginning then it's got to be the same today let me tell you if it if it worked back in Paul's day and Peter's Day and John's day and Martin's day and Columbus Day and William brandom's day let me tell you it will work today Church it'll save the Lost it'll heal the sick it'll fill with the Holy Ghost because he cannot change he's an unchanging God he said here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways my my an unchanging God with unchanging ways what did he do in the first he saids what he did in the first he will have to keep doing until it's done in the last time so other words brother I'm saying what he did in the first age Paul's age We Believe Paul to be a mighty Messenger right we believe they had signs and wonders in the Supernatural in Paul's day right he said what he did in the first age he will have to continue doing down to to the last age well brother Joe we're in Lea that's been seven Church ages that doesn't matter time doesn't stop God God's word Remains the Same he is the same yesterday today and forever and what he did then he must do today to be God cuz if he changes then he's not God if he changes his word one iota then what are we standing on we're people most miserable that's right but we find here what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all Church ages so you can take your Bible and you can go back to the book of Acts and you can walk yourself through the Church ages you can walk yourself through the New Testament and you can see what God's is expecting to do in this age you can see it you're not blinded to it it's not what some man Twist on it let me tell you the word of God is not up for debate so we find in the first church in Paul's day God came down and he breathed the Breath of Life on the church at Pentecost no longer were there a powerless group of individuals merely follow following some teacher who they claim was a good teacher but now they receive power the same one that opened the blinded eyes the same one that healed the leper the same one that raised the de that same life that was in that individual Jesus Christ is now living amongst 120 that's why he tells us today in Mark 16 we can lay hands on the sick it's the same power it's the same life it's the same God it's the same manifestation he never changes so if it work for them in that day won't it work for us in this day if it heal those in that day won't it heal for us in this day if it delivered them in that day won't it Deliver Us in this day if it brought our particles back in that day let me tell you w't it bring your prodical back in this day now the life of the almighty the creator of heavens and earth is is now indwelling of people brother would tell us like this de he is not in heaven he said the one who created the heavens and the Earth the worlds and everything he said de he said deity is not in heaven de is in you and you and you and you I mean you look at yourself and you see flaws don't you some of you looked in the mirror this morning and screen a oh my cuz we see our failures we know our flaws some of you need to be honest with yourself amen but when we look into the mirror of God's word we look away from what we see and we start seeing ourselves the way he sees us so now deity is dwelling in humanity the life of the creator has come down and empowered the people what did he Empower you four so you can sit on a Pew and say Amen sir cuz not everybody in a church service knows how to say amen I think we got a bunch of Bobby head dolls today what they want to do to nod their head Bible says Make a Joyful Noise you can shout it didn't say Make a Joyful nod but I'll take a nod from some of you I mean that's okay but notice the one that they had read the one that they had been following the one that they've seen do the supernatural now that same life was now living in them manifesting in them now then when they went out when they laid hands on the sick the same power that was in their Christ their Messiah now perform the same Works through their lives so what he did then he does today now I know there's teachers today and preachers today that they don't want to believe that they want to believe and I'm going to get a little bit ahead of myself but they don't believe that the that the signs and wonders should be amongst the people we got the revealed word you're exactly right we got the revealed word we got the restored word you believe that you believe God sent you a prophet and he tied the loose sins up and he opened the seals on the back of the book and it become a new book we got the restored word well if we got the restored word shouldn't we also have the restored power shouldn't we have the same power the same anointing the same Holy Ghost oh come on church we claim we got it then let's practice it let's put it in action Let The Winds of Pentecost blow [Applause] through he's an unchanging God brother said the word can't change or be changed because the word is God now brother Jason can get a different thought I'm picking on you cuz you're up here now you're a great preacher I ain't saying you're not put that out there brother Tony right both of us will be in trouble but brother Jason can study you know and maybe a year from now he realizes maybe I didn't see that quite as clear as I do now so he can change his viewpoint but what we've done around the mess is we done got so hob knobby and snobbish I can't believe he said he was wrong we got men preaching era that they've been preaching for 20 years cuz they refuse to be corrected by the word because this is what they've always known well let me tell you what you've always known may have not been always correct even your Prophet had to grow in his Revelation even he changed his stance on certain things so that he can fulfill the word of God and bring you a complete message see men can change change our ideas we seek and we can see things different but God can never change his word can never change he said in John 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was with God so we find God can't change he is the infallible word of God and he says now thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard amen oh uh oh come on come on oh oh that hurt brother Joe you mean said tell me Pentecost was to stand under I'm not telling you was I'm telling you it is and not was it is the it's still the standard today amen he said that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changeed the pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep doing until the church ages close and let me ask you when does the final leoty in church age close out it closes out when the bride is lifted out of here and when the bride is lifted out of here the church ages closed and God returns back to the Jews but until that time he must do the same thing that he did at Pentecost and if he does the same thing it's got to produce the same works it's got to produce the same kind of believer you say we got to get emotional some of you will some of you won't it's not in you but you got a respon to the word see our response sometimes if you're like me I'm all excited and you know I act nutty up here Glory my wife don't say that all the time would you calm down but I love this message and I don't care how I look to anybody cuz I'm not here to please anybody I'm here to please him and I definitely ain't worried about what the devil thinks about it but I'm not trying to say you got to measure up to my level full of emotion and intensity because you may never get there but whatever God has called you to do if it be a hand lifted to God then you lift that hand to God and you defy the enemy and tell them I believe in the Living God I believe that he's the same yesterday if it's a tear that comes out of your eye then cry your tears for him and give God the worship that he deserves I'm not asking you to jump I'm not asking you to shout I'm not asking you to dance I'm just asking you to respond to the word cuz your response may be different than mine he said the church at Pentecost is the standard how many of you believe he's a prophet am yes sir did I we're not debating it Pentecost not isua Pentecost not isua Pentecost I've been to isua I was at isua two months ago I was at isusa Street there's nothing left the building is gone you walk downa it may be a 200 yard road and that's it you wouldn't even know it was there unless the sign was up there but the isua that he's talking about the or not the isua but the Pentecost that he's talking about it's still there because it ain't a place it ain't an event let me tell you it's an experience and the same experience that they had then we can have today the same Winds of Pentecost that changed to 120 can come inside here this morning and change 120 it can set you on fire it can make your walk out different it can change your family Dynamics for eternity amen just let the winds blow through but we're afraid I remember when I first came to the message Man people you didn't say nothing about Pentecost was a derogatory word this 20 something years ago telling my age man you said Pentecost they like no we're not Pentecostal we're not Pentecostal no maybe we're not by denomination right but what we found when a prophet left the scene Pentecost I would had to admit the denomination they were fanatical they put more on their music Let Me Tell You someone would love to have some of this black grass we got going around here man I'm back here trying to study and I'm like woo woo I got to get out there I ain't never heard black grass brother Tony but I'm tell you what it's got something in it had to make a dead man dance wo they must have played Black grass when Jesus spoke to Lazarus all right said come forth he come out dancing woo I tell you that Music Man y'all y'all got it going on I thought he was kidding he ain't kidding brother J said you going to love our music music it gets loud I'm like louder the better cuz you know what happens when the music gets loud when you can't sing like me you can sing loud cuz they can't hear you you really feel like you making a Joyful Noise to the Lord that's all right but we find thees this community we we're afraid of Pentecost you know we we think we're associated with the fanaticism and so what happened when brother Brandon went off the scene is that we went into another side of the ditch it's the ditch of formalism well we got the word we don't need all that we got the word word word word word word word but the Bible says the letter kill it but what we have done as a message Community for so long we shut the spirit out cuz we didn't want to be identified as a fanatic we didn't want to be identified with those dancers those tongue speakers those blobber Hallelujah those little act 238 screaming young let me tell you there ain't nothing better to be identified with than some ACT screaming 238 knowing you got the Holy Ghost and you're going to make a Rapture that's what I'm talking [Applause] about but we got them in a ditch a formalism ditch an intellectual ditch right we got the word the word the word the word but where is the power of God and churches sit dead people sit dead but the word is being preached they had the word at Pentecost until the Spirit came they had the word brother they said go go up there in that upper room I guarantee you they prayed they read their Torah they did everything they needed to do they did the formalism but when the day of Pentecost was fully come but when the day of Pentecost was fully come they didn't cut it short on the eighth day brother Luther or the ninth day but on the 10th day when day 50 finally came around then the power of God came down and it come like a rushing Mighty Wind and let me tell you it changed their lives it changed their nature it changed their habits it changed their homes it changed their marriages oh Hallelujah it changed her children and if it did it for them let me tell you it'll do it for us so Pentecost is the standard yes and if Pentecost is the standard get your minds off of Aza right that's right if Pentecost is the standard then shouldn't we strive to uphold the standard shouldn't we strive as a Believer as a people as a home as a church as ministers as deacons as wives as husbands as musicians as people in the back doing the audio shouldn't we strive to uphold that standard when we walk out into the street as young people and Mom and Daddy ain't around that ain't the time to cut the skirts off and hack them up a little bit High that's the time to hold the standard young men this ain't the time when you walk out of the house and your pants get tighter and the jelly bracelets all over your wrist necklace hanging all over your neck this ain't the time for that this is the time to hold the standard God is looking for somebody to hold the standard let me tell you for me and my house we're going to hold the standard we're going to preach the word we're going to allow the spirit to move we're going to allow Pentecost to blow through and when we need to be corrected we're going to open oursel up for correction right so Pentecost is the standard We should strive with everything within us to achieve the standard to achieve it my There's No Greater Joy to KN it that you passed the test come on I know some of you are probably great intellectual Giants me neither Brother I did good enough just to get by but you know how it is when you're studying for that test man you're just studying laboring and laboring no matter how smart or unsmart you are shouldn't you you want to achieve to a passing grade I mean when I took test I look I wasn't a Believer but I called my grandma I said hey Granny got another test I need you to pray she was a believer of this message I wasn't and I'd pray I said look you need to pray for me I got a big test I was in college for accounting and yeah I passed I did all that I wasn't that dumb but I'll tell you it was her prayers I believe to help get me through but I was trying to achieve a passing grade now if we could put so much effort into achieving passing grades in college or passing certain or or certain things and and Milestones on the job to get a promotion shouldn't we be able to try and strive to achieve for Pentecost because Pentecost is the standard that's what God inspires what his church was at the beginning is what his church is going to be at the end and if that's what he expected and how he set his church up in the beginning let me tell you we should strive to be that church that kind of people with that kind of power that kind of authority not all beat down when the Devil comes in no you recognize I'm a Son of God you square your shoulders back and say not today Satan I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ you're not coming in my home you're not coming against my marriage you can't have my children you can't have it take your hands off today that's what Pentecost is about church it's about taking the authority of the word of God and putting Satan to the [Applause] testall that's so what God did Pentecost he will do he will do in this church in the end he will do in the bride what he did in Paul's day is going to be reciprocated in bram's day in our day because he can't change now people want to say the apostolic age is over I hope y'all don't believe that here I knew better but I had to ask so what do you mean brother Joe Apostolic age you had to forgive me I left my handkerchief back in Louisiana so I'm gonna be soaking wet by the time I'm done but the apostolic age I look this up cuz I I'm Mississippi Boy oh well praise God you speak it hey man you got a check it weren't that good I might well keep asking when's a Pentecost will blow it in woo Glory no I'm not here for money I promise you but I wonder because I'm from Mississippi we're not very intelligent in Mississippi if you notice the 50th state in the continental United States 50 means the last number bottom of the barrel y'all get that all right so that's where I'm went from so anyway I want to know what what's it mean by Apostolic age it means relating to the seccession of Spiritual Authority they so God God gave his disciples he gave them the authority to use the word because God implanted inside of them a part of himself and men today want to claim and men in that day want to claim that the apostolic seccession The Authority by which God had given men to use the word to use the power to use the Holy Ghost is over that was only for the 12 they claimed that the works that the Holy Ghost did in the apostles is only for those in the book of Acts men today claim that the days of Miracles is over how many of you are saved and filled with the Holy Ghost then the days of Miracles is not over cuz you're the greatest Miracle you're the greatest miracle they want to claim ministers today around this message want to claim that we don't need the supernatural anymore some claim that we don't need any of that we got the revealed word I was in a youth meeting one time and we had a young sister come to the altar actually she come in a she was at a youth camp and something spoke to me and say she's got a spirit of suicide on her and I went and I told brother Timothy we was at a youth camp and I said this girl's got a spirit of suicide on he was begin to deal with her and he began prayed with her but she never exposed she never confessed it but something just spoke to me and so we dealt with her and you know she was okay but she the thing didn't get cast out and so a few months later she comes to our October meetings and there she comes into a prayer line and me and brother uh brother a and or working with this young girl and I knew what I saw some two months prior of that and the Lord's told me she's not delivered yet so we begin to talk to her I be to speak to her and the Lord begin to discern her heart and she crumbled brother Jason to her knees and she be to cry and scream out cuz she wanted deliverance and she ran to the Altar and she stayed there and cried and boohoo but old grandma came up there and said get a hold of yourself little girl we didn't do that when I was your age get a hold of yourself we didn't act like that when I was your age ask me where that young lady's at today she's out there in the world suffering cuz she had her opportunity and because somebody says well we didn't do that in my day well maybe it wasn't preached in power in your day maybe it wasn't preached in fullness in your day maybe because we didn't have all the message all in and the way we do today on the computer well you can search it all the way out all the way through in your day but we're not looking about your day what is he doing today and I believe the same Holy Ghost is still moving still Discerning still calling young people back to the altar so that they can give their heart to God and have a real Pentecostal experience notice Mark 16 verse1 17 if we had the restored word which we do then it comes with restored power and if we had the restored power that mean we don't sit it on a shelf and look at it we have the restored word we don't sit it on the Shelf just to have a collection of books or a collection of tapes or a collection of quotes got our little nugget book worried about your nugget book I'm worried about your soul I'm worried about your heart I'm where you living and if we got the restored word then there's got to be a restored power notice we find here in Mark 16 and verse1 17 these signs shall follow them that believe amen that was a weak amen from everybody but brother Luther back here or whoever's Amen to me I don't know these sign listen this ain't my word this ain't brother Jason's word this ain't this is not Paul's word or brother Brandon's word this is Jesus Christ saying these signs shall follow them that believe that's not up for debate I don't care where your theology come from the word of God is the finality it's the standard it's the th sayth the Lord Glory these signs will shall follow that ain't maybe that ain't hope so that ain't when you get this spiritual temperature of the church right that is the word of God but notice it only follows them that believe you can sit here in service everybody jumping around having a good time but you know you could be all sold up have a bad day choosing to not believe choosing to just say well it ain't for me never never for me I knew it to be like this I'd come in everybody shouting and dancing and I don't feel nothing I don't know what they feeling well if you just change your unbelief to believing if you can change your unbelief and start believing quit being a Critic being critical and say Lord help me believe help thou my unbelief turn my doubts into believing help me see what the word is doing in this hour notice these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak in new tongues they shall take up serpents and I don't bring your snakes into the church this morning if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover nowhere does it say maybe nowhere does it say if nowhere does it say you got to do certain certain thing in order for the word to come in action it says if you shall believe if you can believe this morning the sick can be healed the dead can be raised blinded eyes can be open Hallelujah church that's the word of [Applause] God so we have our youth camp how many of you have ever dealt with a demon Spirit maybe a handful of you some of you probably never seen it but it's real so in prayer line first time I ever seen it manifest maybe second time one of our youth camps and I was not too far behind brother Timothy and brother Tim and I think it was brother Ron at this time and they become a sister in the line she was an older lady had children and she'd done been in prayer lines and prayer lines and been to different Brothers brothers that we holding high regard and seeking prayer seeking the answer seeking Deliverance when she came in when she she got to that prayer line she stopped and man she stopped right in front of me I'm like I knew what was going on like oh this thing's got a devil on her and brother Joy she started just doing this and her neck just head just like a snake just just very just bam boom just not saying nothing just real tight and just snaking back and forth so we begin to pray and I'm going tell you I'm a prayer I'm going to pray with everything I got and I ain't letting go until the thing leaves and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and this thing was stubborn I'm like God you going to have to do something cuz I'm running out of strength right but the words the word regardless of my Humanity right when brother Craig was there brother my brother Craig my brother-in-law brother Craig Boer he was there and so me and brother Craig begin to work with her and all of us when she kind of fell down on the platform and she come to herself for a minute and she looked at her husband because we were going to take her to the back room begin to work with her in the back room and she looked at her husband she goes they're going to give up on me like everybody else I said oh not today Satan me and brother Craig B went to that back room and we began to work and brother Craig began to put things together and begin to talk this and begin to deal with this and deal this and then we finally cracked the key finally cracked a key that released her from her prison amen Lord Amen brother Jason she would said every time she'd get to that point get to that point of almost Breaking Free she will saw herself saw herself and the word the brothers couldn't be around her because it was nasty oh but that night was different and she we begin to pray and we begin to brother Craig and I just begin to work with her he working on the like the the teaching type side of it and really connecting things me from the the the Evangelistic side and we just begin to work the two gifts hand in hand working there and we finally she got to the point where she lifted her hands and begin to worship God and she said it's different this time it's different this time she looked at her husband she said it didn't happen this time she goes I'm free now and she began to hear angels singing in another dimension and can I tell you she's still free today she's no longer bound she's no long but cuz the word of God has power that we have the authority Brother Brad to cast out Satan that's not up for debate that ain't up to have a discussion with the devil it's thus sayeth the Lord and if you're a Believer you can take that word and put it on your lips and it's just the same as deity he speaking we had another young girl I'll give you another quick testimony on it I won't hold you much longer had another young girl she's probably 16 years old a congales young lady and she come to the prayer line and and man she's begin to fit and just Arch her back young skinny little Ry little 16y old and they said brother Joe take her to the back I'm like oh goodness lucky me I said get your wife and get sister Lydia which is brother Aaron's wife such as Lydia pu which is Lydia Oglesby pu excuse me get her and y'all go to the back and work with we don't want you in the back by yourself so we we go down and we begin to work with her and this young girl is just foaming at the mouth like a dog I mean foam just pouring all out of her mouth am I right and she's arching her back and just foam and just notd in herself we get her to come to herself for a minute and try to to work with her and try to get her to come to herself and I didn't know the situation where brother Matt McGary he she attended their Church well he comes to the back in just a few minutes he begin to work because he knows the history well he begins to tap into it brother Jason and begin to speak to the spirit with inside of her and within five minutes that young girl was free 45 minutes we were back there working with her and when five minutes when you can hit the spot and realize you tap into it and get them to realize who they are when you're not speaking to the enemy anymore but you're speaking to the spirit within them and say do you want to be free yes I want to be free then through the your confession of Faith you can't stay bound let me tell you and he's the same today church we have the authority by the word of God that was deposited to us on the day of Pentecost to lay hands on the sick and to cast out devils and it worked then it works today it'll work tonight it'll work tomorrow it'll work next week it'll work every time it'll work GL John 14 we find here Jesus tells us John 14:11 believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to the father so Jesus is telling us by the scripture that we can do Greater Works why ain't we doing it I ask you ministers why aren't we doing it do we not believe mom and dad why aren't we doing it do we not believe it's the word put it in practice yes so we find John 14 Jesus declaring that what he did and he divided himself up on the day of Pentecost the logos divided itself and came and lived in 120 and if it worked in his day through his life in his ministry won't it do the same today for us see the key to Mark 16 the key to John 14 is believing you can't have signs and wonders if you don't believe he said well my church don't have it well your church needs to start believing for it my pastor don't believe that way your pastor needs to start believing for it because the Bible says all things are possible to him that'll believe so we find in the book of Acts that what you essentially find in the book of Acts when you read through it you find Mark 16 and John 14 in action Amen in the book of Acts you find Mark 16 and John 14 in action they knew their position as sons of God and and if it worked in the Bible and we heard a prophet tell us if the vine ever puts forth another Branch oh it's going to be Baptist it's going to be Holiness it's going to be Oneness it's going to be no he says if that Bond ever puts forth another Branch it'll be another book of Acts let me tell you we're not acts part two we're the same continuation of the same manifestation of the same life and the same power that was in that CH group of Believers is the same power that's in this group of Believers cuz it's the same Winds of Pentecost they're still blowing they're still moving they're still operating in human lives so we find in the book of Acts men who actually believed and received the Life of Christ were actually producing The Works of God they were producing it the same works that Jesus did they did those that He breathed on into that day they were doing the same way bringing life to the people and see this is a promise it's a promise to us it didn't end God did not put an expiration date on Mark 16 right he didn't put an expiration date on John 14 he says this will I do these signs shall follow them can we keep going I'm going to try to bring this down I got about 20 minutes or more brother B said the Life of Christ returns in the form of the Holy Ghost not a nail scar see the Corporal body is sitting at the right hand of God to make intercession but the Holy Ghost has come to carry on his work he that believeth in me and the works that I do shall he do also amen then we go to Malachi 3 and verse 6 says for I am the Lord I change not so if you don't get anything out of this message I want you to understand God does not change he is forever the same and if we can turn to our scriptures and see what he did then then we can expect him to do today sir amen so brother B would tell us here in Ephesians Church age he said what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God had the power of the spirit manifest in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Spirit he said and he goes into Hebrews 2 and verse one therefore we ought to give a more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we shall let them slip for if the words spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience to the word receive the just recompense of reward then how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed To Us by them that heard it he said God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own word so if he beared them and he Vindicated them in their lives and their Ministries and their churches with signs and wonders then won't he vindicate the believer today with the same signs the same wonders the same outpouring of the supernatural and we find here in Jude Jude tells us to contend for the faith because they begin to slip away some 30 years after Paul established the Ephesian Church they begin to drift away and brother B said they had a less Ardent desire for the things of God that was just a 30 years after their first messenger look how many years we are after the the last messenger you don't think there's a less hardened desire for this generation to believe the same signs and the same wonders when there's men out there propagating that God don't do these things anymore that we don't need altar calls that we don't need prayer lines that you don't have to have all that emotion you don't have to have all that dance they have strpped the power out of the church but see that's what Satan wants cold formalism intellectual gospel amen now I'm not against teaching I like it anointed though I don't want it dead that's right man hey look I can read for myself I don't want it dead I want it alive teach it put it together let it be inspired but what we have done we found men today because they feel this call in their life they going to teach because you ain't got to have no inspiration now let me let me back up on that they claim because they have no inspiration they're a teacher let me put it like that that well I'm a teacher but what have done what what has God done in your ministry there's nothing they ain't done nothing so you're a teacher you're part of that fivefold Ministry to establish the church to build her up to edify the body and you telling me God ain't doing nothing even in a Teaching Ministry no amen because God sent the fivefold for the perfecting of the church and that perfecting it means it's going to establish the believer in the present truth it's going to cut away things it's going to establish him on things it's going to do its part of the the body it's going to do its part of the ministry but we found we we've gotten so far away from Supernatural we're scared brother Jason some of us are so scared of the emotion come on we're scared of a little fire brother BR says and we all know this quote you can't get warmed by a painted fire look I tried it I we had a we was at a brother's house the other day and they had a little TV monitor excuse me Monitor and they had this picture of a fire it was crackling like oh my I didn't get one bit hotter I didn't get one bit colder man I felt like I was getting warmer like ain't nothing happening I heard the the crackle flames and I looked at my wife and said you can't get warmed by a painted fire and that's kind of what we've got in the ministry today a bunch of painted fires why not preach the same power why not preach the same anointing amen why not have the same Winds of Pentecost that blew in on that day why not welcome it today what about our service what about our youth what about our homes why can't we can't have it I tell my church don't paint me a fire throw that picture in the fire and let me get warmed by it I don't want some peny waste message I don't want some little Tick Tock real religion I want the power of God I want the Holy Ghost I want the anointing of Jesus Christ in the body in the church amongst a Believer I want it real if you ain't got it real then get out of here with it don't give me some theology give me neology give me something that's going to save my soul something's going to correct me in my spirit something's going to transform my body Ro Brown makes this statement he says we'll never find Jesus by going back to the beginning of baptism baptism or back to the beginning of methodism or Catholicism we only find Christ when we get back to Pentecostal beginning not the denomination now but the real Pentecostal experience he says we left him at Pentecost the Methodist left him at Pentecost the Baptist left him at Pentecost the Catholic left him at Pentecost the Amish left him at Pentecost the Brethren left him at Pentecost the assembly of God left them at Pentecost the United Church left them at Pentecost there's where he began and I'm afraid many many message churches have left him back in 63 at Pentecost because they were so determined not to be identified with that movement but see he can only put forth the new branch and it's going to be a Pentecostal branch and the only way to get inside the church brother Luther can't be the only way to say be born again got to be born again there's no substitutes amen either you die out or you don't die at all and you don't come in amen so we find we have to be born again it's essential to be born again in this hour and brother Brown said the only thing that is certain no matter where you put it he says if you're born again filled with the Holy Ghost he goes you might enough have enough Ashes to hold on your fingernail but you'll come up forth from the resurrection because you got life you've been endued with power from on high there's life in you there's a sound taking place a sound a certain sound that you know what happened you died and was born again and you become a new creation well you find people don't want to get ugly at the altar oh do we I don't nobody seeing me snot let me tell you I got a weak stomach folks I don't like seeing people snot but when they at this altar snotting something Thrills my soul yeah cuz I know it's real cuz you ain't snotting if it ain't real you ain't snot if it ain't if you ain't snotting it ain't real h I'm tell I'm like look girl you better if you snotting that bad it better be real I ain't going to sit here and work with you if it ain't one time I almost threw up brother Jason I was like I had to regain my composure I said she's doing this because God's dealing with her but we don't want to get ugly at the altar we want to be pretty we don't want to us guys we don't want to mess up our Johnson Murphy's we got to keep them all shiny y'all didn't know I could lift my leg that high did you I didn't either I'll feel that tomorrow but let's look at the characteristics as I begin to bring this down we're going to turn a corner and bring this home Psalms 146 and verse 5 says happy is he that ha the god of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God which made Heaven and Earth and sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth forever which executeth judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the Lord looses the prisoners and we dealt with young people last night about prison prison of depression and anxiety and fears and worries and guilts and pornography and passions and things of that nature but he says the Lord loosest the Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind the Lord raises them that are bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous the Lord preserveth The Strangers he relieve the fatherless and Widow but the way of the wi wied he turneth upside down the Lord shall reign forever even thy God o Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord so the characteristics of God is he is there to help you amen then we look here in Psalms 147 and verse three more characteristics he Health the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds he tth the number of the stars and he calleth them by their name amen verse six the Lord lifted up the meek and he casteth the wick down to the ground in book of Acts three and verse one you don't have to turn there if you're on the monitor today but Peter heals a lame man in Acts three and an Nance of fire struck down in Acts 5 Apostles performed many wonders in Acts 5:12 Peter and John uh dispersed Holy Ghost to different dividuals there in Acts 8 verse 14 and 17 Peter healed a man of py in Acts n Peter raises Tabitha and Dorcas to life in Acts nine we find Peter delivered out of the prison as we spoke about last night by the angel in Acts 12 God smites hering and he dies in Acts 12 and we find a sorcerer was smitten with blindness in Acts 13 then it goes into Paul so now we just went through Peter now let's look what happened in Paul's Ministry Paul was converted in Acts n Paul heals a in Acts 14 Paul cast out of the a Spirit of Divination in Acts 16 Paul and Silas prison doors open up when they begin to worship God in Acts 16 Paul again distributes the Holy Ghost to those in Corinth in Acts 19 Paul heals a multitude in Acts 19 Paul restores a man to life in Acts 20 Paul shakes off a Viper in Acts 28 Paul heals publicus and others in Acts 28 what did we see in Paul's Ministry was the very same thing we just saw in Peter's Ministry it's declaring that he is the the same and if Peter and Paul could do it what about Jesus in this day in this form in his body today he's the same church amen his characteristics do not change amen amen his characteristics brother bam says follow him his characteristics continually identify him the same as he was when he lived on earth he is still living here tonight in in the form of the Holy Ghost he ever lives and his characteristics follow him just as it always did he is still a living and he says the unusualness of God the character of God had to display his characteristics in the Supernatural to show that he identified himself on the message amen turn to Psalms you got those pictures who am I who's doing my did you say that I did shame on you correct shame on you bad boy you're grounded Oh I thought you were testifying I didn't know that was the pictures you want to send I won't do both I'm G send them y'all have to forgive your pastor that means I got to preach a little bit longer until he gets so skewed up amen let's look at this brother brother Brown would say this in the message to token and I believe just what your Prophet said outside of the preaching of the Seven Seals the token is the most ordained message he's ever preached because it puts the life the literal Life of Christ back in Bride form the token life the token message and he says in the token he goes I am looking for a time of a Break Forth of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in come on can we believe that for our day for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for rapturing Faith just before it comes Hallelujah come on how many of you believeing for a Rapture if you're believing for a Rapture then we got to believe for another surge of the Holy Spirit another surge of the supernatural another surge of the power of God moving in the church to move her out of this Dimension and move her into another dimension into a Heavenly Dimension amen amen he said the church is just moving up the holy ghost power is the holy ghost that we're justified by you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture in faith as we move up that's why we need to preach the Holy Ghost amen hey I like the Deep things of God I like all the supernatural the Mysteries and all that that's all good but let me tell you at the end of the day we better be preaching a power of faith of a living God to Rapture a people that change Dimensions amen amen and so we find here in Psalms 145 you got them ready yet you want them all right it was only four how many did I send you more than four I'm i'mna are you sure okay y yep yep y yep yep I did send you more than four you did I'm sorry well as he's sending those let's look at this Psalms 145 and verse three says great is the Lord and I'm closing in about 10 minutes great is the Lord I need you musicians we going to have to have some preacher course in some of this cuz y'all got some black grass and I like it come on especially that piano player my word bro where you've been hiding out we going to have to come to Louisiana and visit for a long time Hallelujah the Bible says great is no black grass after service no black grass after service oh we're going to have to put in for a default well you better act like you got some black grass that's right all right Psalms 145 and verse3 great is the Lord come on church can you say Amen to that and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable oh great is the Lord and greatly to be praised Hallelujah and his greatness how many can Testify the greatness of God oh listen to what it says in verse four and one generation shall praise the works to another generation amen and shall declare thy Mighty acts I will speak of the Glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts I will declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of the great goodness and shall sing unto thy righteousness and we find today men today claim that we shouldn't tell testimonies that we should be we when we tell testimonies we're detracting from Brother [Music] BR God only did those things through a prophet n the Bible says these signs will follow not just the prophets not just the preachers not just the deacons but to them little mother little grandmother back here in the back it'll follow them that will believe and if I can get you to believe in this morning nothing shall be impossible and the Bible tells us oh I love what it says one generation come on grandparents stand to your feet right now one generation shall declare thy greatness to the Next Generation oh what did God do in your day he's still doing it again in this day [Music] God didn't cease to do the miraculous in that day he's still moving look at I'm seeing God moving this hour he's still moving on young people in young hearts in marriages in homes in families in situations in [Music] churches they say well we can't have the supernatural when you tell testimonies you're pointing people to yourself you're showing that you're some big preacher the greatest discredit that we can do to this message is to not testify what God has done I said the greatest discredit to say that God ceased doing what he did in brother bram's Day by opening up blind eyes and Healing The Sick and raising the dead and say that God ceased to be God at that point in 1965 we do a discredit to what we say is a message you got that picture yet almost almost all right we're getting there I'm going to keep preaching till they come up the Bible says signs will follow follow means they're going to walk behind you means everywhere you step sister Debbie there's a sign bam I've been there Holy Ghost has been there Deliverance has been there supernatural's been there binding eyes has been there the crippled have been there they walking again marriages have been repaired we've been there why because why sign shall follow them that believe brother con you can have your children because it's in the word of God because the word declares that they and their offspring shall be there with them we don't take no for an answer we're not backing up off the promises of God we're believing for [Applause] it we had service on a Wednesday night brother Tony this is for you on a Wednesday night 16-year-old girl got into the line brother Wayne Lawson was at our church preaching it went long I mean we had a we pray for everybody in the church

mess's family grew up with standard in the home when he hit 18 he walked out like some of you young people trying to do want to walk out want to walk away from it I'm going to tell you if God put something on the inside that hard you can walk but you can only go and walk so far cuz he's coming back cuz he's got a claim on that seed no matter how far you stray how far you go God's going to pull that seed back into his presence this 16-year-old girl come to the prayer line and she come up there and she said Brothers she goes my my brother's out there in the world he's in drugs he's in rock and roll he's in abandon he's all that she goes I want to see my brother saved I want to see my brother saved sa that young man was laying in his bed in his pajamas it was about 11:00 at night and he

looked their car was gone they wasn't at home he got in this truck drove across tra to another believer's house and they wasn't home he thought the Rapture done took place let me tell you brother Jason that boy got in his truck and drove his truck to the church house and he wrecked it on the way there and he Dr he drug himself out of the church about a 100 yards before the church building and he walked in staggering with his pajamas on and came to the Altar and gave his heart to God and he ain't never been the same I said oh Hallelujah the wind of Pentecost it's still blows he still responds he still moves [Music] pull up that first picture I asked some brothers a while back I said I want you to send me some some testimonies of what God's done in this hour this is not 1965 this
