[30:09] but amen I appreciate the ability I

[30:20] as far as I know you can use the the
[30:22] pulpit mic if you need to you know I'll
[30:24] stay right here and be a good boy
[30:27] amen praise Lord I've got a green light
[30:29] up here so
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] but if not it's okay I can carry on
[30:37] right here this mic actually one of the
[30:39] best mics we have in the whole house is
[30:40] right here amen so even when you listen
[30:45] to it on the on the audio on the
[30:49] internet stream you find that it's
[30:51] extremely clear and picks up really well
[30:54] amen we're going to invite you to the
[30:56] book of Genesis this evening chapter 18
[31:01] and we'll catch a reading there let you
[31:03] be seated and then we're going to go and
[31:06] pick up over in Isaiah 53 but let's get
[31:09] Genesis 18 while we have you standing a
[31:13] man now while you're finding that let me
[31:17] just make a couple of quick
[31:19] announcements
[31:20] and let me add this prayer request here
[31:23] that I just got alright so if there's
[31:29] any prayer request just remember to send
[31:32] them directly to me via via via whatsapp
[31:34] because that's the clearing house where
[31:37] I check and to make sure that I'm not
[31:39] missing any alright and then I want to
[31:44] also make a quick announcement that so
[31:50] the you brothers got the announcement
[31:52] today but so this is mainly the
[31:54] announcement for that I guess for the
[31:55] church on the streaming but the the
[31:58] Saints in New Zealand where I was
[32:00] supposed to be ministering this weekend
[32:02] in fact as I was supposed to be in New
[32:03] Zealand right now and the meetings were
[32:06] going to start tomorrow for us which is
[32:09] already tomorrow for them so I would
[32:11] just be a number of hours away from
[32:13] starting those meetings well things
[32:17] being things those meetings had to be
[32:20] set aside we couldn't hold them I
[32:22] couldn't travel there and they actually
[32:24] couldn't gather so they're there under
[32:27] the same thing that we're under so they
[32:29] they petitioned brother brother al ray
[32:32] if he would ask me would I be willing to
[32:35] go in and preach the convention
[32:36] virtually via come right here and stream
[32:40] it and they're all going to be over
[32:42] there streaming it streaming the whole
[32:44] service through the whole Easter weekend
[32:46] so I've got my work cut out for me I
[32:49] agreed to it
[32:49] a man in a moment of weakness no I
[32:55] agreed to it because it you know sister
[32:57] Debbie reminded me today she said well
[32:59] you know that that makes sense because
[33:00] you really felt led to accept the
[33:03] invitation when it was given and I did I
[33:05] prayed a long time about that invitation
[33:08] I had several invitations and I had to
[33:11] turn down a couple and and there were
[33:14] other ones even overseas and
[33:16] domestically that I turned down because
[33:18] I felt led to take that one and so it's
[33:22] going to give me a chance to fulfill I
[33:24] had no idea be doing it that way a man
[33:26] through the third technology so what
[33:30] we're gonna do is for them it'll all be
[33:32] morning services in their time otherwise
[33:35] I'd have to come here at 3 in the
[33:36] morning and preach I mean I'd do that I
[33:38] don't know if I get my booth crew here
[33:40] to back me up at 3 in the morning but a
[33:43] man we're gonna be preaching here in the
[33:45] evenings Friday Saturday and Sunday
[33:47] night which will be for them
[33:51] Saturday morning Sunday morning and
[33:54] Monday morning because they always run
[33:56] their Easter meetings into Monday
[33:57] curious thing I find that all the time
[33:59] and I go overseas so I've got tonight I
[34:03] get one one little breather tomorrow
[34:05] night and then I'm gonna preach Friday
[34:07] night Saturday night and then here for
[34:09] our regular service on Sunday morning
[34:11] which would be Easter Sunday and then
[34:14] back again Sunday night so how many be
[34:17] praying for me amen I feel like I need
[34:19] to put myself at the top of the prayer
[34:21] list tonight so what yeah six o'clock in
[34:27] the evening Friday and Saturday and
[34:29] Sunday night so I sent out two brothers
[34:33] who would like to come and I think that
[34:35] they're gonna handle all of the their
[34:37] own preliminaries so I just need any
[34:41] brothers that want to come we only
[34:42] needed a couple of maybe one or two
[34:44] broadcast personnel we didn't even
[34:47] necessarily have musicians so I just
[34:49] sent it out to brothers to say hey after
[34:52] after one or two booth engineers I've
[34:55] got you know good eight slots open seven
[34:57] or eight slots open and so different
[34:59] brothers have said they liked
[35:00] fill those I still have a few slots that
[35:03] are available and maybe you want to come
[35:06] some of the services not to all of them
[35:08] and you certainly would be welcome to do
[35:11] that and make sure there's not the same
[35:13] okay I have to already have that okay so
[35:18] we're let's get right to our reading so
[35:20] anyway I just wanted to make that let
[35:21] that be known on the internet to the
[35:22] church we'll be streaming back here
[35:25] again Friday night at 6:00 6:00 then
[35:28] Saturday night at 6:00 and then of
[35:30] course our regular Sunday morning Easter
[35:32] service will be here and then I'll be
[35:34] right back here again Sunday evening at
[35:36] 6:00 amen so we'll be streaming that
[35:40] from here live and that'll be they're
[35:43] gonna they've got a way they're gonna do
[35:45] it where there's kind of an interaction
[35:48] I don't know how it's going to work yet
[35:49] somehow they'll be able to see me I'll
[35:51] be able to see them I don't know how
[35:54] that's going to work if I get delayed
[35:56] amens that's going to throw me out so
[35:58] I'm not sure I told him I said we'll
[35:59] have to figure that out so I think we've
[36:01] got a summa tonight but as Jason to
[36:04] figure that out I think they're set for
[36:07] that all right let's get right to
[36:09] Genesis 18 sorry to keep you standing
[36:11] for so long all right let me let's start
[36:17] at verse 1 and the Lord appeared unto
[36:22] Him this is Abraham in the plains of
[36:25] Mamre the Lord appeared unto Him and the
[36:28] plains of Mamre as he and he sat in the
[36:30] tent door in the heat of the day and he
[36:34] lifted up his eyes and looked and lo
[36:36] three men stood by him and when he saw
[36:39] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[36:42] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[36:44] and said my lord if now I have found
[36:47] favor in thy sight pass not away I pray
[36:50] thee from thy servant let a little water
[36:52] I pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[36:54] and rest yourselves under the tree and I
[36:57] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[37:00] ye your hearts after that ye shall pass
[37:03] on after that after that you shall pass
[37:06] on and for therefore are you come to
[37:10] your servant and they said so do as thou
[37:12] has said verse 6
[37:14] and Abraham hastened into the tent unto
[37:17] Sarah and said make ready quickly three
[37:19] measures of fine meal knead it and make
[37:21] cakes upon the hearth and Abraham ran
[37:24] unto the herd and fetched a calf tender
[37:28] and good and gave it unto a young man
[37:30] and he hasted to dress it and he took
[37:33] butter and milk and the calf which he
[37:35] had dressed and sent it before them and
[37:37] he stood by them under the tree and they
[37:39] did eat and they said unto Him where is
[37:42] Sarah thy wife and he said Behold in the
[37:45] tent and he said I will certainly return
[37:48] unto thee according to the time of life
[37:50] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[37:52] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[37:55] which was behind him now Abraham and
[37:58] Sarah were old and well stricken in age
[38:00] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[38:03] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[38:05] within herself saying after I am waxed
[38:08] old shall I have pleasure my lord being
[38:11] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[38:15] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[38:19] of a surety bear a child which amoled is
[38:22] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[38:26] time appointed I will return unto thee
[38:29] according to the time of life and Sarah
[38:31] shall have son then Sarah denied saying
[38:34] I laughed not for she was afraid and he
[38:37] said nay but thou didst laugh let's pray
[38:41] master we thank you for your word here
[38:44] this evening and now Lord I'm praying
[38:46] for your anointing to be upon the the
[38:49] preacher and the hearer tonight Lord
[38:51] we're just before you humbly Lord I I
[38:55] believe I have exactly what you want to
[38:58] say to the people tonight let it
[39:00] encourage them Lord let it be a pouring
[39:03] of strength into our hearts in this kind
[39:05] of an hour Lord we need it so I pray
[39:07] that you'll grant it to us in Jesus name
[39:10] Amen god bless you friends as you're
[39:12] seated and as you're seated you can find
[39:15] your place in Isaiah 53 Wood has catch
[39:18] two verses there Amen I want to carry on
[39:22] tonight from last Wednesday when I or
[39:27] the
[39:27] last time when I was ministering I'm not
[39:29] I don't think that was last Wednesday
[39:30] but I think it was a previous Sunday I
[39:33] was preaching on the arm of the Lord and
[39:36] tonight I'd like to take part too let's
[39:39] look now in Isaiah chapter 53 to go back
[39:42] to our reading that we had there on that
[39:47] previous Sunday and I'll just catch a
[39:50] couple of quick verses here verse 1 and
[39:55] we'll catch verse 11 who hath believed
[39:59] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[40:04] Lord revealed verse 11 he shall see the
[40:09] travail of his soul and shall be
[40:12] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[40:15] righteous servant justify many for he
[40:18] shall bear their iniquities amen
[40:23] the arm of the Lord we were showing you
[40:27] endeavoring to show you last time how
[40:31] that you know when we talk about you
[40:35] know the arm of the Lord that you find
[40:37] that the scripture is showing us an
[40:41] imagery of God working in the earth not
[40:45] God the invisible spirit that dwells in
[40:48] eternity but when it speaks of who hath
[40:52] believed our report and to whom is the
[40:55] arm of the Lord revealed we find that
[40:58] this chapter 53 being a perfect perhaps
[41:02] I think I I said to you on that last
[41:05] time on part 1 that this chapter of
[41:08] Isaiah 53 referring to Christ that the
[41:12] you know it's referred to so often
[41:15] throughout the rest of the of the
[41:17] Gospels that it's the whole premise upon
[41:20] which Jesus would come and arrive and he
[41:24] was oppressed and afflicted and he
[41:26] opened not his mouth all we like sheep
[41:28] have gone astray he's wounded for our
[41:30] transgressions bruised for our
[41:31] iniquities chastisement of our peace
[41:33] upon him so we're we're realizing right
[41:37] quick and this is a really an important
[41:39] point that you can
[41:40] lose sight of is that when you hear this
[41:43] example the arm of the Lord then then
[41:47] this is actually God manifesting
[41:51] something even even you find them that
[41:54] that when we we say what's attached and
[41:57] we dealt with this a little bit what's
[41:58] attached to an arm a hand and you find
[42:02] that that God moves by his mighty hand
[42:06] and whenever you see God moving like
[42:09] this and these kind of descriptive terms
[42:11] more often than not perhaps in an
[42:14] overwhelming way this is God that great
[42:17] eternal spirit who's going to
[42:19] materialize himself he's going to
[42:22] manifest himself he's going to become
[42:24] this is God extending his being in a in
[42:28] a reality way down into the earth
[42:32] alright now we found that when we were
[42:35] preaching part 1 we showed you how that
[42:39] brother branham showed that the keys to
[42:41] the kingdom were given to the church
[42:44] that Jesus he says there we read that
[42:46] for you last time in the Serpent's
[42:48] e.message how that he did not have when
[42:51] he rose on the third day did not have
[42:53] the keys to the kingdom of heaven and
[42:56] brother Branham says because he had
[42:58] given those to Peter Jesus had keys of
[43:01] death and hell and we found out that
[43:04] that you know that whatever they would
[43:06] bind on earth that it would be bound in
[43:09] heaven and so this great this great
[43:12] operational power that exists in heaven
[43:16] your that God's family was going to have
[43:19] a key in order to access that power and
[43:23] they were going to need it you're you're
[43:25] going to need it in your daily life
[43:26] because life here this this the horth
[43:30] is cursed Satan is the god of the age
[43:33] the lid is torn off of Hell and demon
[43:36] power streaming into the earth if there
[43:38] was ever a time when the body of Christ
[43:42] needed to unlock heavenly power in the
[43:46] earth
[43:46] it's now
[43:49] it was going to be necessary it was
[43:53] going to be necessary since since since
[43:56] you know that that that his he that his
[43:59] his elect who came through his grace and
[44:03] it was going to be to them a revealed
[44:05] faith and so then it was going to be
[44:08] necessary to give them the keys to this
[44:11] kind of power and if God has given me
[44:15] keys to the power of his heavenly
[44:18] kingdom I just plan to use it I mean I
[44:22] don't know what you're doing with your
[44:23] keys but I don't decide I never like
[44:26] just carrying keys around for no purpose
[44:29] I like to use a key if I'm gonna carry
[44:32] it I want to have a reason to carry all
[44:35] right you know I I'm like that I have a
[44:41] utility type of mentality I don't you
[44:44] know I that's why I'm not a hoarder I
[44:45] don't keep things that I don't use I
[44:46] don't buy things they don't can't make
[44:49] sense of it so you know God has all
[44:52] kinds of blessings and I I determine
[44:55] when I look at the world and I look at
[44:57] the promise and the challenges upon my
[45:00] life then I just say my goodness I'm
[45:02] going to need to access these blessings
[45:04] I'm not the kind to go off in pride and
[45:08] arrogancy thinking I can do it on my own
[45:10] I already know I can't do nothing and so
[45:16] I don't mind admitting to you tonight I
[45:18] don't mind raising my hands and looking
[45:21] to heaven and saying I need you Lord I
[45:23] need you Lord right now I need him every
[45:27] morning every night everywhere I go I
[45:29] need him who hath believed our report to
[45:36] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he
[45:40] shall see the travail of his soul and
[45:42] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[45:44] shall my righteous servant justify many
[45:50] you know when you would think of and you
[45:54] know as well as me it would make sense
[45:56] to you tonight if I were to say that if
[45:59] God was going to display his
[46:02] then you know you you you might say that
[46:06] when God was gonna roll up his sleeve
[46:09] and display his arm that it would it
[46:12] would probably be the most powerful
[46:15] looking arm you could ever imagine
[46:18] you know I don't think any weightlifter
[46:21] could ever equal in his arm what my
[46:24] expectation would be if somebody says
[46:27] God's about to roll up his sleeve and
[46:30] stick his arm into the earth you would
[46:33] think that the arm of God would be a
[46:35] super arm and it is but in appearance it
[46:41] was quite unimpressive now this
[46:47] important point the Bible says
[46:50] concerning Jesus that there was no
[46:53] beauty no beauty that we should desire
[46:57] him you know you you would think that
[47:00] God's arm would be super that it would
[47:02] be impressive but when it but when it
[47:05] became on a human being and lived in the
[47:08] earth it looked like probably one of the
[47:11] most unimpressive arms you would ever
[47:13] see brother branham said now this is
[47:17] amazing brother branham said he was a
[47:19] little man now that's that's doubly an
[47:23] amazing statement when you're a little
[47:25] man saying that about another man and
[47:28] brother branham was a small man in
[47:30] stature very small I think man I think
[47:34] it was mating 5/7 and and weighed about
[47:37] 150 pounds and he looks at the Lord
[47:41] Jesus and says he was a very small men
[47:45] stooped shoulders very narrow said you'd
[47:48] almost say you almost couldn't look at
[47:51] him in and just weep when you looked
[47:53] into his eyes and yet at the same time
[47:56] you are aware that if he would just
[47:58] speak the world might end I don't think
[48:02] we can get our mind around it friends
[48:04] now say what's the real point because
[48:06] because I was showing to you the first
[48:09] in the first part and I'm going to
[48:10] reiterate it tonight that the end of an
[48:13] arm is a
[48:14] and and and when God delivered Israel he
[48:17] delivered them by the hand of God and
[48:19] that hand was a man and it was Moses so
[48:27] you see now that you might say I'm
[48:29] nothing well that's exactly or just the
[48:33] kind of guy Jesus is looking for so I'm
[48:36] weak well that's perfect because then he
[48:38] can be strong but I'm undeserving
[48:41] perfect that means he gets all the
[48:43] credit I can't do anything awesome that
[48:46] means he can do everything so when you
[48:51] would you might think that to be a
[48:53] Christian you'd have to be some
[48:55] supersonic person now you'd have to be
[48:59] some battle-hardened Bulldog warrior of
[49:02] faith actually the weaker you are the
[49:06] better it is for him because if you're
[49:10] strong you tend to get in his way and
[49:13] the best thing to do is just admit you
[49:17] can't do anything except through him you
[49:20] can do everything so we see then that
[49:26] this arm you know it was uh it was a
[49:30] common arm it was a small arm it was a
[49:33] weak arm in appearance but yet to stage
[49:37] sinners it had to be the greatest arm
[49:41] that was ever put in the earth because
[49:45] God is going to use that arm which is
[49:47] going to stand in the body of a lonely
[49:49] Nazarene and God's going to use that
[49:52] little frame of a man as God's arm and
[49:55] it's going to save the entire family so
[50:00] we're going to find out that big
[50:02] powerful things come in little small
[50:04] packages that don't look like a whole
[50:07] lot we read to you from recoated you
[50:11] from Psalms chapter 8 and verse 3 that
[50:14] when God made the universe the Bible
[50:16] says he used his fingers but when it
[50:19] came time to save all of God's family
[50:21] God used his arm
[50:24] and as we were showing you a type the
[50:29] type of the Ministry of the Son of Man
[50:32] that you're going to find the arm of the
[50:35] Lord you know appears in a in a person
[50:41] distinct from himself because it calls
[50:45] him his servant say the arm of the Lord
[50:49] so it's God himself but look at the
[50:52] distinction God makes in the scripture
[50:54] God who says the it's the arm of the
[50:57] Lord that's going to come and save and
[51:00] we know that to be Jesus and yet the
[51:04] Bible calls him the servant of the God
[51:07] who has the arm this is the beauty now
[51:11] it's it's so you should thank God for
[51:14] revelation in this hour because if it
[51:16] weren't for that you can easily believe
[51:18] Jesus must surely be the second person
[51:21] in a Trinity of Godhead but the beauty
[51:24] of it is that God's not showing a second
[51:28] person in the Godhead God is showing
[51:31] that he's going to tabernacle in
[51:32] humanity hallelujah and that that when
[51:36] that humanity stands on the earth
[51:39] he's going to be a prototype of an
[51:44] entire family so who hath believed our
[51:47] report and to whom is the arm of the
[51:49] Lord extended who's it made known to
[51:51] who's the hand on the end of the arm of
[51:53] God now it's not the Galilean walking
[51:57] the shores of Galilee it's you it's me
[51:59] it's his bride his family and the earth
[52:04] and yes we don't look like much that's
[52:09] because we look like him hallelujah
[52:13] sometimes we feel so weak well that's
[52:17] because he was a small weak man jacent
[52:20] and friends he could stand at the grave
[52:21] as brother brandon would say stand there
[52:23] and weep over Lazarus so that was just a
[52:26] man said that when he pulled back and
[52:28] brother branham was descriptive said
[52:29] when he pulled back his little shoulders
[52:31] and said Lazarus come forth thankfully
[52:35] he called a name or all
[52:37] graves would open that's kind of power
[52:40] that I want to be tapped into today
[52:42] hallelujah so we find then that that the
[52:49] arm of the Lord you know appears
[52:52] distinct from the Lord because that's
[52:55] see that's that's a type of the son of
[52:57] man ministry because that's the role
[52:59] you're going to play son of man ministry
[53:02] remember the office of son of man is a
[53:05] prophet that's one to a generation we
[53:08] don't got another one we don't need
[53:10] another one the one that came did his
[53:13] job finished it went his reward but the
[53:16] Ministry of the son of man is a broader
[53:19] term it means the Word made flesh I'm
[53:21] here to tell you something friend the
[53:23] same ministry that was in the son of man
[53:25] is now working in the body of a son of
[53:28] man ministry so it's the family of God
[53:33] then now here comes you know really the
[53:42] hindrance to it all because the family
[53:46] of God though elected and though we
[53:50] preach that to you and you can read it
[53:52] in your Bible you can hear the prophets
[53:55] saying it over and over and over again
[53:58] and though we are the family of God and
[54:02] though we are elected you know I stand
[54:06] up here and I'm showing you how that the
[54:08] arm of the Lord is attached to the hand
[54:12] so it's so you understand the arm is
[54:15] what bridge is the body to the hand you
[54:18] remember Jesus said that that I am the
[54:22] vine my father is the husbandman he's
[54:26] the one who planted me now the vine
[54:29] doesn't grow the fruit the branches grow
[54:32] the fruit but there had to be a vine
[54:34] between the fruit bearing branches and
[54:37] the husbandmen and that was the vine and
[54:39] that was Christ that was the arm
[54:42] you understand the arm the arm that the
[54:44] world was saved the salvation was in the
[54:47] arm of the Lord but when God puts his
[54:49] hand in the earth that's his family
[54:52] that's what that was Moses they were
[54:55] saved by the hand of God the Bible says
[54:58] and yet God said I've come down to do it
[55:02] you can pick it up in the scripture
[55:04] brother Branham deals with that in the
[55:05] fourth seal that he says now Moses I've
[55:08] heard the cry I remember my promise I've
[55:11] come down and I'm sending you saying
[55:15] said God always uses man so there so you
[55:19] have you have now watch this friends
[55:22] it's beautiful now I'll ask you a
[55:24] question you see that you see my body
[55:26] you see my arm you see my hand is that
[55:30] three different people it's all the same
[55:34] me I'm a body I got an arm and I got a
[55:37] hand take something God reached his arm
[55:40] down in Christ and Christ life extended
[55:42] in you and you're the hand or you're the
[55:44] branch call it whatever you want you're
[55:46] working the works of God you're bearing
[55:49] the fruits of Almighty God you're
[55:51] attached through Christ to God
[55:54] hallelujah
[55:56] see that's the plan of God we don't have
[56:02] a problem with that that's why we can
[56:04] see that the true teaching of the
[56:08] Godhead so easily
[56:09] see because we're not we're not trying
[56:13] to look often this is where Trinitarians
[56:15] get so messed up and we're we're tunis
[56:17] get messed up they're looking wealth in
[56:19] the heavens trying to figure out all of
[56:20] that language of these different beings
[56:22] we're not even looking up there we're
[56:24] realizing that's here in me and walking
[56:27] around I can see the trueness of the
[56:32] Godhead because I'm an extension of that
[56:34] I'm the kenai said put that in Bible
[56:37] language okay the Bible says that Christ
[56:40] was the beginning of the creation of God
[56:43] if you had a beginning you're going to
[56:45] have a continuation and by the Renison
[56:47] you are the continuation
[56:49] of that same God that same Christ that
[56:54] same example amen the continuation of
[56:59] that same creation so the family of God
[57:06] an extension of God this is why this
[57:10] explains why you can see the revelation
[57:14] of this hour and others can't it is has
[57:18] nothing to do with how handsome you are
[57:21] or how good you smell it has nothing to
[57:24] do with how intelligent you are it has
[57:27] nothing to do with how you were born it
[57:29] has nothing to do with how successful or
[57:32] unsuccessful
[57:33] how how how righteous you might have
[57:36] lived or how evil you might have lived
[57:38] it has nothing to do with that it just
[57:40] is simply that God has a genealogy God
[57:44] has an issue and out of God King Christ
[57:47] and out of Christ King me hallelujah
[57:51] this is why when people walk against
[57:54] election I just say look there's only
[57:57] there's only one elected son according
[57:59] to the Bible and that's Christ I'm just
[58:02] part of him so I'm sorry you don't like
[58:05] election but he's the elected son I just
[58:08] happened to be part of him say I came
[58:11] from him and so we realized that it's
[58:15] nothing that we earned it wasn't because
[58:17] we were good enough it had no merit of
[58:20] our own and and for this reason now the
[58:25] devil knowing that that's the human
[58:28] weakness of the human mind is that I can
[58:31] stand up here and I can prove you and
[58:33] you catch it I can tell the audience on
[58:37] the internet I'm sure people are seeing
[58:39] that Wow
[58:39] the body to the arm to the hand God into
[58:42] Christ into the church the husbandman
[58:44] who planted the vine who grows the
[58:46] branches who deliver the fruit these are
[58:49] beautiful portraits out of the Word of
[58:51] God you hear it you love it you believe
[58:55] it but oftentimes I stand up here and
[58:58] say you're the hand of God in the earth
[59:00] and although you know you hear your
[59:03] family of God and although you hear that
[59:05] you're elected we oftentimes do not feel
[59:08] worthy to be the hand of God let's be
[59:12] honest brothers so oftentimes and see
[59:17] this is this is the devil knowing this
[59:19] this is how he hinders you because he's
[59:23] got he's got he's got you cold dead to
[59:25] rights he's got evidence I mean he's got
[59:29] video replay of your of everything
[59:33] you've did and thought it intended and
[59:38] evidence that he wants to leverage
[59:40] against you but here's here's the beauty
[59:43] of the scripture Christ in his courtroom
[59:47] has already dismissed all that evidence
[59:53] see when Satan tried to bring that up to
[59:56] God God dismissed that case and and
[59:59] rebuked Satan him ever I've preached the
[1:00:01] giotto Zechariah 3 God dismissed the
[1:00:03] evidence because that he this was his
[1:00:06] family that he had elected this was his
[1:00:08] own issue and how dare Lucifer bring an
[1:00:11] accusation against God to accuse his
[1:00:14] issue as to accuse him just on election
[1:00:18] alone God dismissed all the evidence as
[1:00:20] invalid and God rebuked the devil for
[1:00:23] even saying it and that's why Paul could
[1:00:25] say there is now therefore no
[1:00:27] condemnation but the case has already
[1:00:31] been decided when Christ represented his
[1:00:35] blood on the altar in atone for all of
[1:00:38] God's family that would ever be born
[1:00:40] thousands of years down to today now the
[1:00:48] court case is decided in God's Court
[1:00:52] what about yours what about your
[1:00:57] courtroom brother has the decision been
[1:01:03] made in your courtroom see this is the
[1:01:05] devil's already lost he's already lost
[1:01:07] in the Supreme Court so he comes down
[1:01:09] here to your mind
[1:01:10] that's the battleground
[1:01:13] and we don't feel worthy it just seems
[1:01:18] too good to be true that God on the
[1:01:23] basis of his word alone and on nothing
[1:01:29] else has already declared you are
[1:01:34] redeemed done finished brother branham
[1:01:39] said in the mind of God which is the
[1:01:41] only real reality this thing's finished
[1:01:44] up a long time ago brother
[1:01:56] you
[1:02:02] I find that one of the best ways to
[1:02:10] start
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:38] wait to that cross
[1:02:42] open state
[1:02:47] Oh
[1:02:54] the solid rock and his word alone I take
[1:03:00] my stand and I faced the enemy and the
[1:03:04] enemy says you're not worthy and I say
[1:03:06] that's true but you ain't facing me if
[1:03:10] you're facing me then you already have
[1:03:12] one devil but you're facing Christ in me
[1:03:16] if this is based on me we're all sunk
[1:03:19] but it's based on him he had to have a
[1:03:24] hand God wasn't just gonna have an arm
[1:03:27] without a hand I'm here to tell you
[1:03:29] something friends you are that hand so
[1:03:32] become useful another wonder Jesus could
[1:03:34] save his business see we don't always
[1:03:38] feel worthy brother Brandon would say in
[1:03:42] recognizing your day in its message now
[1:03:47] I'm going to say something he says
[1:03:50] national force I read this for you some
[1:03:53] services ago we had it on the overhead
[1:03:55] national force put Israel in her
[1:03:58] homeland we can see that that's history
[1:04:00] you can see how that World War one the
[1:04:04] first woe Rove the Jews out of the out
[1:04:05] from under the Ottoman Empire under
[1:04:07] their control in the Ottoman Empire
[1:04:09] receded but of course they were still
[1:04:11] assembled in Central Europe so it took
[1:04:13] the second woe tender hand of Jehovah
[1:04:16] national force drove them home did it
[1:04:21] work
[1:04:22] yeah drove them home by the millions
[1:04:25] they raised a six point Star of David
[1:04:28] and ninth in 1948 raised a six point
[1:04:31] Star of David recognized as a nation for
[1:04:34] the first time in thousands of years
[1:04:37] what did that national force see say I
[1:04:41] thought God did it God did it but God
[1:04:44] used national force you follow that
[1:04:49] circumstances on the ground made them go
[1:04:52] home national force will put the church
[1:04:59] not the bride but after the rapture when
[1:05:04] the bride is gone and the church is left
[1:05:06] be
[1:05:06] kind national force will put the church
[1:05:09] in the World Council of Churches and
[1:05:12] they won't have a choice brother branham
[1:05:16] makes that so clearly said they'll be
[1:05:18] able be caught in a boycott and he said
[1:05:20] that will force and he would use that
[1:05:22] word constantly it'll force why is that
[1:05:25] true because that's what babylon broad
[1:05:28] was the first one to to to launch out
[1:05:32] with a forced takeover a hostile
[1:05:36] takeover of other people's and a forced
[1:05:39] worship and a forced unity he wanted to
[1:05:43] go out and gather all the living and
[1:05:46] bring them under one auspices one
[1:05:48] headship one worship one government one
[1:05:51] state and that spirit that was anointing
[1:05:55] Nimrod was none other than the
[1:05:56] Antichrist and that was ancient Babylon
[1:05:59] which Peter would call Rome Babylon
[1:06:02] because it's the same spirit doctor his
[1:06:06] lot proved that conclusively in his book
[1:06:10] on the two babylons
[1:06:11] and and found he I love the point he
[1:06:15] says it was so amazing when the Jesuits
[1:06:18] first penetrated the interior of China
[1:06:21] never been penetrated by white men and
[1:06:24] when Catholic Jesuits first penetrated
[1:06:26] the interior of China for the very first
[1:06:28] time they found a Madonna I found a
[1:06:32] woman a mother and a child sitting there
[1:06:35] and glowing and an eminence around the
[1:06:37] child and the mother and they're like
[1:06:39] who who taught you all about Jesus who
[1:06:42] taught you all about Mary the Virgin no
[1:06:45] one had taught him this is the interior
[1:06:46] of China they had never heard about it
[1:06:48] but you can see that that ancient spirit
[1:06:51] of Babylon permeated all kinds of
[1:06:54] ancient cultures see and so so we
[1:06:58] realized then that
[1:06:59] so he says national force put Israel
[1:07:02] their homeland national force the power
[1:07:06] of church and state how I'm not here
[1:07:09] tonight to preach on how that's gonna
[1:07:10] come I don't know I don't care I'm gonna
[1:07:14] be gone
[1:07:16] hallelujah watch children can deal with
[1:07:19] that Abraham's children never had to
[1:07:20] worry about it and so we find that that
[1:07:26] he says now national force will put
[1:07:29] Israel homeland national force will put
[1:07:31] the church in the World Council of
[1:07:33] Churches but the power of God will put
[1:07:38] the people in the bride so you know
[1:07:42] something friends it's it's not God
[1:07:47] using circumstances of my of the world
[1:07:51] powers like he did in in the Ottoman
[1:07:54] Empire in Europe and he he he got
[1:07:56] dictators and czars and chancellors to
[1:07:59] rise up and begin to persecute the Jews
[1:08:01] and brush them home it's not about like
[1:08:03] how he gets ahold of the church in the
[1:08:05] state and forces churches against their
[1:08:08] will
[1:08:14] to become son of God
[1:08:17] then why would you believe any kind of
[1:08:19] power could push you out of it
[1:08:21] it has nothing there is no national
[1:08:24] power there is no natural power that can
[1:08:27] put you in and there's no natural power
[1:08:30] not even yours not no actions by the
[1:08:35] government no actions by you you can't
[1:08:38] keep yourself out of the bride and
[1:08:40] nothing can put you in it but the power
[1:08:43] of the Word of God alone when it is
[1:08:47] believed puts you in the kingdom of God
[1:08:52] and then that life inside you begins
[1:08:57] driving you
[1:08:59] he says world Force's this way and the
[1:09:03] world forces that way but God forces
[1:09:07] upward when I read that itis I won't to
[1:09:11] have a Jubilee because I wasn't sure how
[1:09:14] I was gonna get up there I feel so
[1:09:16] trapped down here I feel so weak and so
[1:09:19] letting I feel like I gotta let feet
[1:09:21] I'll never get off this hurt I don't
[1:09:23] know I don't need to worry don't worry
[1:09:25] tonight friends sometimes I know you
[1:09:27] don't feel worthy I know you don't feel
[1:09:29] much like the hand of God but don't fear
[1:09:31] the power of God is going to force you
[1:09:34] say what's goin on in my life why can't
[1:09:37] I go to the same places I used to go
[1:09:39] because there's a force moving you see
[1:09:45] the Spirit of God which is the word of
[1:09:48] God my word is spirit in life did Jesus
[1:09:51] say that we'll put the bride the my word
[1:09:57] his spirit and life will put the bride
[1:10:01] in her place say why how in what way cuz
[1:10:06] she'll recognize her position in the
[1:10:10] word not my my my I'm not going around
[1:10:17] now here's what Satan does Satan wants
[1:10:20] me to recognize my position in weakness
[1:10:22] Saint wants me to always recognize that
[1:10:25] I got this flaw or that I got this
[1:10:28] trouble he wants me to recognize that
[1:10:30] he's always tripping
[1:10:31] me right here he wants me to recognize
[1:10:32] that he's always stumbling me right here
[1:10:34] but I'm not here to recognize a weakness
[1:10:36] or flaw or trouble or failure or a past
[1:10:40] I'm to recognize myself in the word and
[1:10:43] when I do that
[1:10:45] none of those weaknesses Falls or
[1:10:47] troubles can keep me out of it
[1:10:49] he says she'll recognize herself in the
[1:10:53] word position in the word then she's in
[1:10:56] Christ and that'll put her in her place
[1:10:59] no national force will do it the
[1:11:02] national force did Drive Israel the
[1:11:04] national force forces the world council
[1:11:07] council churches will drive every
[1:11:08] organization but the power of God will
[1:11:11] raise the bride into glory I'm gonna sit
[1:11:17] back tonight and just revel in that
[1:11:19] promise I'm just gonna close my eyes to
[1:11:22] the world and shut my ears to the siren
[1:11:25] song of doubt and fear and the enemy and
[1:11:28] just say let me tune my hearing to the
[1:11:30] word let me turn my eyes upon Jesus let
[1:11:33] me believe what a prophet has said and
[1:11:36] I'm here to tell you there'll be a force
[1:11:38] but I dine amic begin to lift you up
[1:11:41] into a higher realm we don't feel like
[1:11:45] it but we don't feel worthy but this is
[1:11:48] why Paul dealt with Hebrews 10 brother
[1:11:50] George give me Hebrews chapter 10 verses
[1:11:54] 21 to 23 he bruised ten
[1:12:03] having a high priest over the house of
[1:12:06] God let us draw near with a true heart
[1:12:09] in full assurance of faith having our
[1:12:14] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[1:12:16] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:12:19] let us hold fast the profession of our
[1:12:23] faith without wavering for he knows that
[1:12:26] you'll be faithful
[1:12:28] can I read that again for he is faithful
[1:12:33] that promised he is the one faithful and
[1:12:39] I could even if I even if I'm not
[1:12:41] faithful he can't deny his own self he's
[1:12:44] already promised himself me and so
[1:12:47] there's no way he's gonna break his
[1:12:49] promise to himself hallelujah he abides
[1:12:52] faithful this was really this was really
[1:12:59] ground zero for for Abraham Sarah
[1:13:05] because what God was suggesting to them
[1:13:09] was had been and remained impossible
[1:13:15] they couldn't bring forth children when
[1:13:18] they were young and they had been he had
[1:13:22] matter I think she was only 15 and here
[1:13:26] they here they come along and now they
[1:13:28] went all these years through their life
[1:13:30] nobody to have children and now they're
[1:13:34] already passed bearing children and
[1:13:38] since Sarah Sarah wasn't being some
[1:13:43] rebellious child of God Sam wasn't
[1:13:46] Sarah's nature this is a woman who
[1:13:49] called her husband Lord this is a woman
[1:13:53] who followed him and he was a wanderer
[1:13:56] in the desert this was not a rebellious
[1:13:58] lady this was not a women's lib this was
[1:14:01] not some dominating female Sarah was a
[1:14:03] very humble woman calling him Lord
[1:14:07] following his every decree and and she
[1:14:11] wasn't being rebellious but she thought
[1:14:13] it ridiculous
[1:14:16] me I I couldn't do that when I was young
[1:14:21] and now I'm old now it's actually in a
[1:14:25] reality physically impossible at least
[1:14:28] when I was young it was possible now
[1:14:31] it's actually already too late
[1:14:36] see and he said to her but notice what
[1:14:41] he said Genesis 18 give me that 18 10
[1:14:44] brother George
[1:14:45] look at the language any sin Genesis 18
[1:14:49] 10 and he said I will certainly return
[1:14:54] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:14:57] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:15:04] Sarah heard it in the tent which was
[1:15:06] behind him this was not ambiguous
[1:15:10] language friends now you're you're
[1:15:13] sitting here tonight and you hear me
[1:15:15] preach about the election of God in the
[1:15:16] power of God in the hand of God in the
[1:15:17] arm of God you hear me talk about the
[1:15:19] promise of God in the court in heaven
[1:15:21] you are rejoicing with me on that but
[1:15:23] but but yet at the same time come on all
[1:15:27] you humans at the same time we love to
[1:15:29] hear it and we want to believe it and we
[1:15:31] lift up our hands because it emit moves
[1:15:34] us and it's it I want that to be true
[1:15:39] but at the same time
[1:15:41] at the same time it's it's it's me
[1:15:45] saying to you that weakness you will
[1:15:50] never stumble at it ever again in fact
[1:15:53] as you go the rest of your life from
[1:15:55] this day forward and you'll never commit
[1:15:58] another sin that's how impossible what
[1:16:03] God was saying to Sarah in Sarah's mind
[1:16:07] and he was saying I will certainly
[1:16:11] return and he rebukes her and she denies
[1:16:17] it all no you did you did you laughed
[1:16:19] you said how can I being old have this
[1:16:23] with my husband and he's old and then
[1:16:26] and then later on down because God's not
[1:16:28] going to let unbelief have the last word
[1:16:30] if you keep on reading down he repeats
[1:16:32] it again I will come at this time next
[1:16:36] year according to the time of light and
[1:16:38] you will embrace it you will embrace the
[1:16:42] Sun you are going to have this child I'm
[1:16:45] here I'm only here now watch it what was
[1:16:48] this tent meeting about this this little
[1:16:51] tent that that he was coming to meet
[1:16:54] Abraham in was to confirm a promise that
[1:16:58] he made to him all the way back in
[1:17:00] Chapter 12 and makes it again and makes
[1:17:03] it again and makes it again and Abraham
[1:17:05] doubts it and Abraham back slides and
[1:17:08] Abraham lies and God keeps confirming an
[1:17:10] Abraham says Lord he finally gets so you
[1:17:13] told me I'm gonna be the father of many
[1:17:14] nations I didn't got a child and this
[1:17:18] daily easer who's my servants gonna
[1:17:20] inherit everything and I thought you
[1:17:22] told me and the Lord comes back again it
[1:17:25] will not be that way out of your own
[1:17:28] loins you're going to have a son I don't
[1:17:31] care what it looks like I'm it's not you
[1:17:34] doing it Abraham I'm gonna do it and
[1:17:39] when he comes now in the evening times
[1:17:44] at this evening and this evening time
[1:17:47] and he's going to have an evening meal
[1:17:49] and an evening hour he's gonna he's
[1:17:52] going to sit down and eat with Abraham
[1:17:54] and after the meal then this angelic
[1:17:58] visitor who who announces that a son is
[1:18:01] going to be born to Sarah in exactly a
[1:18:03] year and of course we we know I mean
[1:18:07] chapter 16 you can go various different
[1:18:09] places 16 and 7 we won't bother going to
[1:18:12] it's certainly the Lord Himself brother
[1:18:13] branham makes that clear there
[1:18:16] commentators make that clear there's no
[1:18:17] doubt this is Almighty God that's
[1:18:20] speaking and stand and though the
[1:18:25] thought seemed ludicrous to Sarah and
[1:18:28] she laughs at it the Lord in His
[1:18:33] graciousness could have killed her but
[1:18:37] she was a part of Abraham and God in his
[1:18:41] gracious I know sometimes it it
[1:18:43] sounds like a rebuke and he's he's
[1:18:45] rebuking her and he's correcting her but
[1:18:47] understand friends put yourself there
[1:18:49] when God rebukes you isn't it in love
[1:18:52] don't you as men of God as sons of the
[1:18:56] Living God and sister Deborah here with
[1:18:58] us I think we can all hear witness
[1:19:00] tonight that even when he rebukes me I
[1:19:02] feel his love
[1:19:03] he's coming what is it he's not rebuking
[1:19:06] me to destroy me he's rebuking me to
[1:19:09] challenge me and he says to Sarah
[1:19:12] is anything too hard for the Lord you're
[1:19:17] here tonight brother you I'm here to
[1:19:19] tell you you're the hand of the arm that
[1:19:21] came from God and you say but I it can't
[1:19:23] be if you only knew my life if you only
[1:19:25] knew my problems the only my weakness
[1:19:27] I'm gonna say to you I'm gonna give you
[1:19:29] the same challenge is anything too hard
[1:19:31] for the Lord see is anything too hard
[1:19:38] for the Lord in the Hebrew one of the
[1:19:51] you
[1:19:54] marvelous that he could that he could
[1:20:00] promise me
[1:20:08] of all guilt and you say oh brother my
[1:20:15] life clear me of all guilt it's just too
[1:20:17] marvelous you have no idea I'm here to
[1:20:21] tell you something friends he can clear
[1:20:24] you of anything no matter how disastrous
[1:20:27] even if your whole life was a disaster
[1:20:31] he can clear you of all guilt and place
[1:20:35] you and his inheritance and the kingdoms
[1:20:38] to come is anything too marvelous is
[1:20:41] anything too hard for the Lord
[1:20:45] so this account that we read here in
[1:20:48] Genesis 18 if it's anything at all it's
[1:20:54] a call for the believer to believe that
[1:20:58] God can do the impossible because that's
[1:21:04] what Paul said were to read it in that
[1:21:05] frame of mind that it's for our examples
[1:21:08] that we're to read those Old Testament
[1:21:10] stories and we're to learn and have that
[1:21:12] for our examples and if there's anything
[1:21:14] that this example is showing at the
[1:21:18] evening time during an evening meal when
[1:21:21] the son of man ministry is displaying
[1:21:25] itself and God is compared to confirm a
[1:21:28] promise that you want you have believed
[1:21:31] this message and this word that you have
[1:21:33] believed and let the world say what they
[1:21:35] want I know it took me out of the
[1:21:37] clutches of the devil and I know it
[1:21:39] keeps me every hour and I know it's
[1:21:41] gonna place me in a millenium say does
[1:21:44] it have that kind of how can it put me
[1:21:46] up there well how did it get me here
[1:21:49] I couldn't get me here you didn't get me
[1:21:51] here all the king's horses and all the
[1:21:54] king's men couldn't get me here there
[1:21:56] was only one who could get me here and
[1:21:58] if he got me here he can take me there
[1:22:02] hallelujah so this confirmation visit it
[1:22:10] was
[1:22:13] he confirming his promise by this
[1:22:17] personal visit I want you to catch that
[1:22:21] I'm closing in seven or eight minutes I
[1:22:23] want to try to be done by 8:30 he's this
[1:22:27] you you got to see the scene of what
[1:22:29] Genesis 18
[1:22:38] you
[1:22:50] you
[1:23:22] formation hallelujah and he's going to
[1:23:25] have a meal with them and the eating of
[1:23:28] the meal confirmed it and what's the
[1:23:30] what's that what's the climax what's the
[1:23:32] apex of Revelation 10 that you must go
[1:23:35] say oh mighty angel descended well
[1:23:38] that's part of it that's the beginning
[1:23:39] without that nothing happens well
[1:23:42] there's a seventh angel yeah that's
[1:23:44] right he had to be there because he had
[1:23:46] to receive that mighty angel but that's
[1:23:48] still not the climax that's nanny says
[1:23:50] now that seventh angel who's gonna go
[1:23:52] off the scene but before he does he's
[1:23:54] got to take the open book and John's got
[1:23:57] to go ask for it and the angels gonna
[1:23:59] say now have a meal have a meal in the
[1:24:02] evening time have a meal on the body
[1:24:05] word on the son of man son of man
[1:24:11] revelation 10 was a confirmation you're
[1:24:14] gonna make it you are the word God's at
[1:24:17] work we are going home surely say yeah I
[1:24:23] don't think I can make it and God is
[1:24:25] saying you surely I will do this I will
[1:24:29] come back in the time of life and I will
[1:24:32] change your body and that's exactly what
[1:24:35] he did Abraham and Sarah it's changed
[1:24:38] the physical bodies
[1:24:44] is the eye
[1:24:51] you
[1:25:20] under my control when the bride
[1:25:24] recognizes who she is when the bride can
[1:25:28] get it and get past the courtroom of her
[1:25:31] own mind and start agreeing with the
[1:25:34] data with God and when the devil brings
[1:25:37] his evidence to your courtroom say this
[1:25:40] case has already been decided
[1:25:43] case closed yeah I see that evidence
[1:25:45] devil it don't count God saw it before I
[1:25:49] God saw that evidence before you had it
[1:26:01] you
[1:26:15] and he want to be the hand of God but
[1:26:18] attached to the arm of God which is a
[1:26:21] the person of God a man this divine
[1:26:27] declaration to Adam and to Adam's bride
[1:26:32] it's a declaration
[1:26:36] it's a humanly impossible birth that's
[1:26:43] just where you are your new birth was
[1:26:46] humanly impossible now your birth in the
[1:26:49] world was because of a human interaction
[1:26:52] but your new birth was a human
[1:26:56] impossibility this is wide Nicodemus
[1:26:59] struggled when Jesus said you have to be
[1:27:02] born again what I'm home am I gonna
[1:27:08] reenter what are you talking about and
[1:27:12] Jesus is like wow you're you're a master

[1:27:17] these spiritual things you don't even
[1:27:18] understand why you're even a sinner you
[1:27:21] don't even understand why God would need
[1:27:23] to send a messiah oh I'm here to tell
[1:27:25] you people don't understand why God
[1:27:27] needed a message boy I do they
[1:27:29] understand why he need to send a prophet
[1:27:31] boy I do hallelujah I'm here to taste
[1:27:34] something friends I wouldn't have wanted
[1:27:36] to face the world that and face the
[1:27:38] devil that the world has to face on just
[1:27:41] the theological opinions of some
[1:27:43] preacher hallelujah thank God that
[1:27:48] Christ the mighty out - a prophet on the
[1:27:51] earth and that prophet handed us an open
[1:27:54] book not a closed book an open book and
