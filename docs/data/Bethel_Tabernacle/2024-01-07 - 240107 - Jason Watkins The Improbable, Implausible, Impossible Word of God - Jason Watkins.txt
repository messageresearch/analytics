and so I looked it up and I think I was more confused after I read what it meant then when I didn't know what it actually meant if you look in Wikipedia in Hebrew it means that you're married to the land and if you apply that to the land that the people of Israel will marry the land of bua is referred to in various hymns for for that I thought okay so we're married to a land and then if you look in Isaiah 62:4 it says Bula means married and is applied to the land of the people of Israel but Thou shalt be called heev zeah and thy land Bula for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married aren't you glad that the Lord Delights in you amen doesn't that just kind of make your heart go pitter patter amen I know yall know this song so just sing it with me will I'm kind of home s

you know at at any rate um as Paul said you know if that doesn't happen you're not going to hinder those that are asleep they actually rise first amen he said one of these mornings you be standing in your kitchen and have a funny little feeling go over you and turn around and there will be that loved one who passed away standing there smiling at you amen glory another place talked about a little

Lord amen God bless you this morning and uh we're going to look right here at Matthew's gospel in the 19th Chapter happy to have all of you here in the house of God Amen just looking make sure I'm probably usually Overlook visitors but I don't see any of this morning amen praise the Lord I good to see you here still with us praise God Amen Matthew chapter 19 16- 26 and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou Wilt enter into life keep the Commandments he saith unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet Jesus said unto him if thou wil be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said Jesus unto his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who can be sa who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible possible but With God all things are possible hallelujah amen you love the Lord this morning let's let's pray father we thank you for your great Mercy in our lives Lord and we are very very much ready now just to put our hearts and Minds into your hands this morning that you lead us in the paths of of righteousness that you might instruct us Lord where we need instruction reprove us and even rebuke us where we might need that Above All Things We Come Today a little closer to the image that you saw of us before the foundation of the world may that be the result of this day's service we commit it to you in your commit it to you and into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen I want to take a odd little title this morning and all I all I can tell you is this is how it came to me so if it's a strange title I'm strange I want to take a title the improbable implausible impossible word of God amen amen praise the Lord the improbable implausible and impossible word of God Jesus really had astonished his disciples with you know with his comments from a real life event this was not just a parable this was actually a historical event there was a young man Who had who was what we might call today uh we might say a fine young man that that was a fine young man uh Mark records the same story in the 10th chapter Luke records the same story in the 18th chapter it's very important story and brother brandham picks up this Rich he calls him the Rich Young Ruler and it's significant because later on we find that Jesus looking forward sees that this young man someday that he will stand on his rooftop and he will Overlook his vast wealth and he will determine that his wealth is so great and his ambition is so great and his future plans are so great that his barns aren't going to be big enough and he's going to need to completely tear down his Barns and silos and all of his warehouses and rebuild them much bigger and you know and that's not an uncommon thing and I don't even necessarily say that you know you you you always want to accomplish all that you can that's not really the issue it's just who do you want to accomplish it for and what's the real motive behind your desire to accomplish there we're going to accomplish things as brother Jason uh dears was teaching us this morning that world that's coming friends is is going to be Beyond description I mean we can stand here and try to describe it and we can use superlatives and descriptive terms and and we can go back and brother brandham can talk about what it's going to be and we can we've actually i' I've preached sermons that chart the acreage alone you know uh of of just the of just the Holy Mountain where the new city that comes down upon it and I mean you're you're talking you know about millions and billions of acres and uh that that spread out across the world and it's going to be more than just sitting on a cloud playing a heart brother Brenham says we're going to live we're going to life it's going to be a fantastic time uh and so there's nothing wrong with you know thinking large and and I think large all the time but I want to say like Jesus you know what's what's my real motive and what's my real objective am I laying up treasure for this side on that's foolish because you can't take it with you and and he saids Jesus reasoned to say human reasoning mind you that don't even don't even you know put a lot of effort into laying up treasure here where thieves and moth and rust can just take it all away from you uh but lay up Treasures on the other side where thieves aren't where moth and rust don't corrupt anything see and so it's it's just it it becomes common sense to do it that way but I I'm going to suggest you today that it's a common sense that's otherworldly it's not a a what we would call human reasoning you know the the the human reasoning looks at the Christian and with all all of his principles like the ones I just laid out about layup Treasures on the other side you know and things like her enemies I mean that was so anathema to Jews who had been taught their whole life an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth Jesus was unorthodox as unorthodox could be and so he was uh he was Radical he was an itinerant he was Radical itinerant and and they you know everything that he that he talked about you know was contrary to what the religious hierarchy of Israel wanted at that time and for that reason they were against him and for that same reason religious hierarchy is against the word of God today and will recommend I mean religious hierarchy of human reasoning of the world today Rec recommends that we don't operate this way yeah recommends to me he Don't Preach against those things you could have a larger crowd you know go ahead and let and let's make a let's let's turn it from a from a sacred sanctuary in into a into a you know a an auditorium of of not just sacred worship but an auditorium of entertainment that's what the world you know it's all about numbers and brother brandom said they were doing that you know way back in his day a million more 44 and it was always the goal and but a little casual search of History finds out that as soon as the church back in the early days started letting down the bars sheep got out goats got in and the church got corrupted oh yeah amen that happens in homes that happens in lives you lower the bars and what happens the holy you know the Holy Spirit ends up going away offended because you've let too many things of the world into your life under your roof in your family you your your priorities get S see go ahead destroy yourself and your loved one because that's going to be you say well well you know they might could make it big to what end to what end are you going to make it big to do what once you make it then afraid and live in fear to have to try to keep it what do they have you know I mean I'm not I don't want to go down a rabbit trail of it today but I've preached on it before and and and um I mean listen you know we we've talked about we put a blocks of life and showed you know just it was such a a visual image to just show 80 years in blocks and how far down the list you already are I mean you know if we if we take the promised years I'll give you a shock are you ready I promise you it's going to astonish you I've never said it to anyone that it didn't go wow it did that to me we we talk about the promised years and we talk about you know 70 years the promised 70 we call it now some people thank god sister Jean is 13 years past that see brother Eddie made it past that many 16-year-old don't get a fourth of that amen who pass away so life is uncertain you don't know that you might be here today but not here tomorrow it could happen in a moment you know there even young athletes in their Prime I mean how how many how many we could go down the list of world famous uh world class athletes in their 20s fit that's an understatement and on a on a on a on a soccer pitch fall over dead on a football field fall down dead in a boxing ring what you know running riding a bicycle just fall over dead here we have no continuing City but I do seek one to come I do want to continue I'd very much like to continue you know as brother Jason was saying this morning Life is Beautiful the world is a beautiful place I I said to you some time ago people could say well if you if you knew what my life was you wouldn't say that but come on that's only because I get that but that's only because you're in that if all of that went away and you had no problems and everything was on peace and joy forever more Life is Beautiful the world is beautiful take all the sin away and so we we're going to a beautiful world we're given here you know 70 promised years and you know you say here today some of you may be in your teens or your 20s your 30s and 70 look so far away I promise you it don't stay looking far away very long I remember brother Eddie used to say to me boy you be 30 before you know it he wasn't wrong and then he would start saying boy you be 40 before you know it he wasn't wrong and you know that even if you live I mean if we just use the promise 70 can we do that let's just call it an average and call it the promise 70 you've only got 3600 weeks of life and you're done 3600 weeks I mean weeks go by like that it was this last week and then the week before that and we're already now weeks past Christmas and it was just a day or two ago if you live 70 you you've only got 3652 weeks of life and how many weeks have you already blew through sobering isn't it am so if we're going to chase something you know this fine young man this is a story of a of a fine young man who was who actually was interested in God and he was obviously wealthy and educated and upwardly mobile and charismatic whatever he must have had he must have had all the right stuff to be able to accomplish so much from such a young age he was already a ruler see and and we find that Jesus showing in that the end of his life in hell he lifted up his eyes yes amen because he as brother brandham said he knew he he he had he had tells he says to Jesus The Ten Commandments I've I've kept those since my youth I'm a fine young man I've been in church I understand right right from wrong but brother Brandon points out and when he when when the Rich Young Ruler said that Jesus didn't contend with that now Jesus would have when those Pharisees said things Jesus said you're a liar this man he didn't disagree with that at all but he says but if you would be perfect in other words and and you're going to have to be perfect because you've got to stand and marry the perfect Son of God so now there's no way you can do that all you but what you can do is have faith in that which can make you stand before God as perfect and a prophet points out that he was a good fell good guy been raised in church believed it was a really fine young man but yet even he knew that he was still coming up short yes of eternal life amen it's a it's a sobering thing for fine young men here today fine young sisters it doesn't you don't even have to be young you could be older it it's a it's a sobering reminder and and what Jesus was saying to him sounded implausible it sounded I mean it it it sounded to say why would I give up all of my hard-earned work see and it was simply that the young man did not value and so many times I see people come up short because they don't have the right value set to their priorities yeah you know it's leadership is a a paradoxical thing whether it's a a father in a home or a mother I mean she's the first pastor of the children yes amen whether it's a church church is just a collection of families amen if we want to do we want a spiritual church amen well then that's up to you I can preach it all day long he can anoint me and I can bring you the word but if you want a spiritual church you got to have spiritual families cuz a church is just a collection of families and and that and brother Brenham said no matter how much I prepare and pray and am anointed in the back room and you wouldn't even be able to guess the hours of preparation that go into just a single sermon sometimes you're thinking on it for days and weeks amen and and and studied and have it ready and be Anointed with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and Prophet said and walk out here anointed studied and prepared and the Holy Spirit feel resistance he just won't move he just won't move and I'm going to tell you something friends you're in a day where you can't afford to come to a Sunday service and not have him move we need him moving Hallelujah we need to have the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost it's far too late of an hour playing church is long ago gone people are perishing that's right crossing the line between judgment and mercy sealing their Doom in a tribulation just like this fine young man yeah amen Jesus said Jesus knew his problem and your problem our yours might be different from mine his was different from zakus yeah zakus was cheating people and uh he comes down and confesses I'll I'll repay he went back to the law I'll repay every man I think it was four-fold or tenfold there was two different laws governing that and I think he he was talking about the one that was four-fold uh and Jesus didn't require zakus to sell all that he had and follow him because that that zakus didn't have that that issue this young man had that issue see what is your issue today that the Lord is knocking on your heart and saying you need to let that go you you come I can say well well the other person no forget the other person this is you Paul pilate said what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ brother brandham used him in leadership there in Cina brother brandham you prove that that leadership is a Timeless principle transcends time came came down out of heaven and and brother brandham said now okay you had a mother you had a a father you a little child you had a Sunday school teacher you had a pastor you've got a school teacher you've got a university professor and he so you know he just covered the whole Gambit of humanity wherever they might be and he comes down to the final question that really was the the only question that even mattered and he said who is leading you now yes amen amen sobering question because we're all being led he said you're either being led from above or beneath there's three Realms above and three Realms below and you're in the middle and you're influenced by those upper or lower Realms that's a fact you can't go anywhere to escape that amen man that's that's how we live and so you have to make these sobering decisions this is my first sermon in the new year and I want to get it right I want you to know that the that this world can't just keep going on forever uh the age can't just keep going on forever he only had seven stars in his right hand and he's already deployed them there was only seven ages and we're already at the end of the last one it can't just keep going on it can't actually so what are your preparations you know it's leadership is such a a vital thing and and we see you know today Satan wants you to be led contrary to God's word Satan wants you to be led you know by leoa now the problem with that is is leoda has a God over it that ain't the God Amen it has a worshiped being an antichrist Spirit that's leading it so you just have to ask yourself this question do I want to be led by human reasoning and understanding and let leoa take me on you know the the Pied Piper take me like a rat down and drown Meen or or am I willing today to say away with the reasoning of the world I will take the way with the Lord's despised few I know it's in implausible I know sometimes it's it's improbable what God is asking me to do there's no way it can come out good until it does until it does Amen I'm here to tell you something friends that those people that live in that world you just remember I I when I'm standing in the crowd and I I can never resist people saying oh well you know the world is ending I always seem to find myself speaking up try to tell myself shut up don't say anything no just be quiet and I can't and I just have to say you know it's not ending they're happy to hear that they're like oh you must be you know some Guru you must be some motivational speaker I am motivate you to the most wonderful world ever thought of the world is not ending amen it's being trans it's just transitioning even the Millennium is not even the ending of time we're still counting times and centuries I'll still be alive in the 27th century amen amen the world just keeps right on going it's just that that that that Sinners are going to perish in self-destruction called Armageddon and the devil's going to be put in a chain of circumstance and the and the and the Earth is going to write itself because it was Atomic power that rocked it off of its axis Atomic power is going to write it back up and then the P the polar caps with tropical vegetation down under them well all you're talking about global warming it's going to be a beautiful place the whole world will come back in nature and the curse will be lifted and nature will function again like it used to be and the Saints will rebuild and that's just the honeymoon then it's a new heavens and a new Earth not a different one but now a holy fire and someday we're going to stand on this world and I'm here to tell you the people that stand on that world and that's not Disney that's not Fantasy Island that's reality that's soon going to be history hallelujah we're going to stand there and the people who stand there then are going to be so glad they decided now to take the way of God's word no matter how improbable no matter how implausible no matter how impossible it sounds am amen because God calls for leadership according to his word leadership Satan's not afraid of leadership as long as it doesn't have application he's not afraid of you understanding leadership leadership was in heaven it Satan wasn't Satan Satan was rebelling against the operation of leadership amen not the thought of it not the teaching of it the operation of it Heaven had a hierarch hierarchical leadership system and Satan was all the way at the top he was right hand to the angel of the Lord on the throne but he wanted the the main chair he wanted first chair he didn't want second chair and his greed and his his jealousy and his you know it got the better of him and he was an angel all of light until sin was discovered in him he had an eye disease I will Ascend I will be like the most high amen and and so you know that it's it's that it's that rejection of the operation of leadership Satan don't care how much you understand as long as you don't apply it listen up fathers Satan don't care he'll he you he'll let you sit in a message church for decades he'll help you get to church you lose your keys he'll tell you where they are he wants you to think you're all right when you're not that's a that's a tactic he uses to get you to think I'm in a right church I got a good pastor I'm hearing the right word and I enjoy the presence of the people and I have a good time at church and and and maybe you've sit in for decades and have never really had a new birth experience he's all he's all too happy to let you go on thinking that amen I was talking to a young man uh yesterday and we we were conversing back and forth and he got it he got it so clearly the whole idea that yeah you can sit here in this church and you can believe it and you can enjoy it you can love what it does and see the product it produces in the families but have you been born again have have you passed from have you passed from Death to life every man has to ask the question what shall I do you already know what I'm doing what are you doing Hallelujah if you got Godly Parents young people you already know the choice they made what's your choice and so you know I don't want to get too bogged down in that but you know it's it it it affects the priorities of families and families are it's it's a paradox really because it has to be it's it's actually proper leadership in a home which then is the same in a church it's actually paradoxically it has to be built from the ground up but it operates from the top down it's like a paradox it has to be built on the found proper foundation and built up according to the word and once you have that from the Capstone which the head of any family is the father or the husband and then above him is the holy spirit am amen and and so everybody has a head nobody's out from under it see and it's a it's a trickle down operation it's a trickle down it's a top down management amen see and it's got to work that way and if anybody along you know that's where we're problem families have problem problems if if if wives don't get their place if teenagers don't understand their place if everybody's you know trying to be at the top of the Heap God you you listen you want a family and you want a church that God can get behind amen amen anything outside of the line and Order of God's word I don't care what you do it will fail it must fail it's not Eternal God can't support it amen it's my first sermon of the year we need to have this thing established brother brandham says this in what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ he said all these things that he prophesied to be in this day something has to bring that to life but when it's brought to life it'll be so much different than people think it is till it'll only be the elected will see it always just the elected is the only one only thing that will see it because it is elected and ordained to see it therefore it cannot no other way now that's historically biblically inarguable that is inarguable in the Bible you go back and you look at that and and every time it was only the elite uh the elected family of God that that understood and followed after God in his strange movements amen amen and things that he did that defied expectation and and the ways he did it and that that are that he says your ways are not my ways my ways are not yours and my ways are above yours so this is where faith is going to come in you cannot look at the word of God from a h always a posible plausible or possible way because it is often improbable the things that God will do do or ask of you to do it is at often times implausible that the Lord will say if you'll do it this way you'll have this good result and that and the way he's suggesting is so implausible Lord are you kidding if it seems that if I do it that way I'm never going to accomplish this you know I I remember one time years ago um you know and and I'm not going to go into detail but someone was contemplating moving here and attending this church and said to me you know we we we've built up this wonderful business and you know we feel the pull to come there we have no church we have no real uh word where we live and and uh you know the far closest church is many hours away and and then we're not even sure that church would work for us and we appreciate your ministry brother Jason but you know we've got this mind battle because this business that we've built up you know what I said to them I said well here's my counsel if you believe that you built the business then you should probably stay here and hang on to it but if you believe that God built it then what's where's the question you think he can't rebuild it here if he wants you here and that and that did the trick and they relocated and that was many years ago and and so so we find that the word of God is often completely impractical it is largely unpredictable and more often than not it is indirect opposition to human reasoning itself I mean you know when I when now when I think about it and I see David looking up at the stars and and I mean when I do the same thing I'm like David I say to myself who could deny a Divine Creator when I walk outside and look up into the heavens and see the stars and the and brother bradam said those stars are further apart from each other than they are to you amen see and so so like David I mean that that's that's where where I that's what I Come Away with yet science makes its claims against a Creator I remember Anthony Hitchens who I believe has passed on and and you know he he made a statement one time that that all arguments uh fall before all arguments of a Divine Creator fall down before scientific reasoning and you know I would say this that he's not completely wrong in that premise it's just that he he looks he was looking at it out of balance I mean God God does do things that seem impossible God does do things on purpose that are on purpose and he has intent now not malice he has in his intent is life his intent is to get you to have faith because without faith it's already impossible to please God a lot of times if your faith isn't you're not pleasing him because your faith isn't high enough he will put you in impossible situations again and again and again until you trust him and then let him get you out of it and then you'll see Hallelujah listen friends the fastest way to get a trial is the fastest way to get a test is fail one I've been saying that for years the fastest way to get a test from God is to fail one and I promise you you'll take it again and again and again until you pass it so you know I but but I'm like David I look at the heavens and and a truth Wells up within me I remember you know when we first built our house there in Christine we were the only ones in that neighborhood was didn't have maybe a third of the houses and we were one of the F most early families in our culdesac we were the only house there were no other houses in our culdesac me and my boys would go out it's one of my fondest memory me and my boys they were just you know I forget probably at at that time 1999 however old they would have been and we would go out into the culdesac and and we would lay in four ways with our heads all together and we would lay there and just look up at the stars and I'd talk to them about God and about creation and they would just look there and their wondering eyes just marveling at these things and that that's something that P dividends to me now see and so so we we when I look up at the heavens there's something that it within my soul that I can't put it under a microscope neither can I put love under a microscope but I know it's real I I'm not I'm not I I might can't explain that feeling I have like David I might couldn't explain that to Anthony Hitchens frankly I wouldn't even care to because sometimes the feeling we have in our heart defies explanation you can't even explain it to yourself you just believe it there's just something that hangs on inside there that won't let you doubt it I'm I'm here to tell you I'm sure that if Mr Hitchens did not repent before his deathbed he is you talking about an Agony of regret he's a Believer today millions of people are going to be become Believers too late when we think about historical occurrences that are based and driven by prophecy I'm I'm a student of history and I've for years have have correlated prophecy and history some of my favorite is to take the visions of Daniel and the four Gentile kingdoms beginning with the of gold and on down through uh Nebuchadnezzar and the and the Persian Empire and the Grecian Empire and the Roman Empire and you know and and then when you look and and you can see all other ancient Eastern cultures you know the Assyrians were a great nation that was where Jonah was sent to Nineveh was their was their Royal Capital uh was our federal capital there in in Nineveh and but you know when we find that finally when sarib comes and my goodness you know sarib with two and a half million man army he had already defeated Egypt he had already they were just sweeping through the ancient Eastern World snack was Unstoppable he was just he was just he he went into Judea and he just one city after another took them with ease with EAS and I I believe he was the king that very cruy I may have said this here previously that if you if you didn't fight and you surrendered he would let he would let everybody live but all the men had to have the right eye plucked out and that was his Mercy that was that was his benevolence I'll let you live but I'm going to pluck your right eye out so that everybody will know that you are in tribute to sakb and you know when he comes down to Jerusalem and Hezekiah is there I mean the odds for Hezekiah were not only insurmountable they were completely impossible s sakb actually you know offered Hezekiah a reward if he could put 2,000 men in on Horseback here he he's got an Army of 2 and a half million and he says you you can't even field 2,000 men how are you going to resist me you trusted in Egypt I sacked Egypt no one can stop me you think you're Gods can stop me no one can stop me and I mean two and a half million man army mowed down everybody in his path Egypt fell before him you know this was a pretty good threat and it worked out really good for sakb until the angel of the Lord went into his camp in the middle of the night and started busting heads am amen by the time the angel of the Lord got done half his army was dead and the rest were in disarray and they all fled in Retreat the next day you know why because a prophet had said to Isaiah don't you fear God was going to fight this battle you're talking about impossible you're talking about implausible you're talking about something that something that that is so improbable as to be impossible but you know why that it worked because prophetically all history is controlled by prophecy and always has been it comes forth with the great goat with the notable horn that smashed the ram the ram had of Persia had smashed the Babylonians and then there was nothing before the Persian Empire I mean you know million man standing army and and by some ancient historians you know and U modern day historians you know there's a lot of disparity between what they believe but but here here's what they all agree on when Alexander entered into when the goat ran toward the the ram in the Bible it says that the ram pushed in every direction and nothing could withstand him until a goat rose up with a notable horn that flew across the ground and smashed into the RAM and the ram had no strength against him that was Daniel's prophecy long you know centuries before it came to pass and when Alexander here's here's what they all agree with some say you know the the the Persian Empire could field a million men Alexander there's no historian that even suggests he ever at any time had even had even 50,000 men some as low as in the 20,000 here's the bottom line that they all agree with he had he was basically outnumbered five to one amen and he wasn't fighting farmers amen he was fighting a trained Army Warrior Warrior people uh that that that that was I mean it it made it so impossible that that Alexander couldn't even win just like sakar couldn't lose until he did Alexander couldn't win I mean Darius of the Persians he had a he had a 10,000 man King's Guard they were his shock troops his Elite Force they were his special forces you know what they called them the Immortals he had a 10,000 man shock troop special forces called The Immortals and they they operated in a way that if you killed one and he fell a next man immediately took his place and if you killed him another one immediately took his place and it was psychologically overwhelming like we can't kill these guys every time we strike them down they come right back because you got 10,000 right behind it coming forward and this is his elite soldiers and Alexander goes in with a with a fifth of that Army and he's fighting trained Warriors who had smashed the Babylonians you're talking about improbable you talking about implausible n and to Impossible and Alexander doesn't just defeat the Persians he just he crushes them in three or four major conflicts crushes them goes into India and fights against those and and and defeats them I mean it was it was so improbable so implausible so impossible but With God all things are possible because God had already got Daniel and Daniel wrote it in a book and said that there's a there's a Ram with two horns but there Rises up a goat with one notable horn and the ram is Invincible until the goat crushes himen Hitler had those same that same idea he had shock troop a shock troop core called the SS I mean how how shocking is it to you for a prophet to say the Holocaust was the tender hand of Jehovah wait what the Holocaust one of the most cataclysmic events to for Any Nation to suffer for any race of people and it the horrors were unspeakable and the prophet says it was the tender hand of Jehovah friends whatever it takes for God to get you home is the tender hand of Jehovah don't never lose sight of that no matter what it requires him to do and you ought to have the heart today to say Lord by whatever means necessary I came from God I want to go back to God there's this world is not my home I'm just passing through even my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue hallelu amen God's family I could I could you know I I could almost you know wax dramatic like Paul and say what more could I say what could I say more for for time would fail me to tell of Moses at the Red Sea to to tell of of Jeremiah when when Jeremiah is pleading in prayer against the evil that's going on in Israel and God you got to come do something about this this is terrible this is contrary to the word you you can't just let this go and the Lord come to him and said Jeremiah if I you if I told you what I was going to do you wouldn't even believe me I'm actually going to bring the King of the North in and he's going to sack the country and kill them wholesale and take them in captivity and then I'm going to restore them back and then Jeremiah no I was never mind forget my prayer I don't don't please don't let that happen sometimes if if the Lord lets us know I'm glad he doesn't I'm just and that's why I just say Lord whatever it takes I don't need to know I don't want to think about it I'm just I'm I'm humbling myself right now to whatever it takes to make me look like this oh can that be your desire today you find young men you find young sisters married single elderly can that be your desire today you know they're talking about implausible things there's no way Eve would choose to believe the Serpent's word over Elohim would she I mean who would do that you you try to imagine the shock and all that Adam came into contact with when he you did you did what but but God said oh but you know that's just because you know he knows that you'll be like him I found out I got I went to a church service and I found out that that that you you don't have to keep all of the word of God but actually it's just God keeping you down and uh really you need to have some Modern thinking Adam and he knew she was doomed and only his love for her saved her there's no way she would do that until she did you know the situation of a man born in sin you want to talk about something impossible try to get to heaven born in sin you have no way you talk about something so impossible for him to save himself from listen before you're born again even your human mind is enmity against the word of God even if you know it's right you just can't bring yourself to do it you have no chance except God rich in Mercy hallelujah hallelujah God rich in Mercy even if I know I'm going to be destroyed and even if I know it's right and even if I don't want to die and even if I want to go to heaven I still can't bring myself to it it's God rich in Mercy to come down and change my heart and change my mind right you you talk about something implausible I mean pilate just knew the Jews would choose Barabas there's no way they want you there's no way pilate you know he's you can hear him his exasperation let him be crucified why what has he done what sin has he committed this man has done nothing worthy of death I'm a judge I'm a governor I judge the man he's done nothing worthy of death you know give him a weapon and let him go it's not the matter of civilized Nations you know I'm Rome we're a Civilized Nation we don't kill people for no reason you know and and but but the Jews were just insane with anger and resentment and so pilate just goes for broke he just says okay I know how I'll get out of this I'll make this thing so implausible so impossible so so there's no way they'll choose barabus who would you rather that I release unto you Jesus the king you know Jesus of Nazareth or barabus barabus or Jesus give us barabus the murderer yes the man who has murdered innocent people yes some of them were your neighbors we know some of them were your family we know what is this man done nobody defended him that day that's why brother brandham said I'm going to give him a new trial said he didn't get a fair trial on that day I'm going to give him a new trial oh where was the people that could have stood up and spoke for him and he wouldn't speak cuz he opened not his mouth they could have said are you kidding you're we're going to take a murderer who has killed innocent people who has no compassion for human life and is just a thief and a murderer and will kill to get what he wants and this man has done nothing but but help the thousands and feed the thousands multiple times he's healed Our Sick he's raised our dead he's given us the ways of light and taught us the roach to life we're going to choose a murderer impossible until they did it they didn't even hesitate they absolutely were in such a frenzy they they had such a hatred you know I mean I mean wow you know can I mean can anyone rightly disbelieve today that we are fighting a a very ancient evil in this world brother Brenham comes to a message and he calls it the indictment a lot of audacity you you know they thought you William brandham you itinerate you uneducated idiot who are you to we're doctors of divinity and and you're going to tell us and and a prophet says I'm going to do more than just tell you I'm going to accuse you of the second crucifixion of the word and not only am I going to do that but I'm going to do it in the presence of the judge and he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the word I mean come on friends nobody in the right mind say how do you know it's evil because nobody in the right mind would choose modern organized Christianity over the truth of this hour a murderer of the word why don't you just be back there and choose baratus bar barabus beg your pardon why don't you just go back there and choose Barabas because that's what they're doing today a prophet said that's brother bram's own words a murderer of the word modern Christianity so-called a a murderer of the word a complete Antichrist agenda that is against the new word uh that that that is that is against the word of God I'm here to tell you something friends what what are you looking at with this new year what's on your heart what's on your mind today amen what are you thinking are are you looking for spiritual growth in your home are you looking for spiritual growth in the people who live there oh my listen I I want you to know you've got two choices you either raise them in the admonition of God in the way they ought to go or Satan will do it for you leoa will do it for you we see plenty of encouragement from the from the spirit of of the Antichrist in Leo DEA you know and and and and you you see that don't you surely parents see that I mean h how could we how could we not see that the spirit that is leading this age is an antichrist Spirit listen Satan has designed it that way he's designed it that way uh to to influence you to be all that you can get all you can forget the leadership of the word of God man forget that do you uh go for it be be everything oh I'm here to tell you that's the that's the leot toan Antichrist Spirit but there is a another spirit that when I look into the heavens I say I want the one that created the Stars I want the one that wrote this word I want the one that opened the Red Sea I want the one that destroyed enemy armies when I had no chance I want the one that gave me a mind that can agree with the word of God no regard for what then I I remember that old Melia Jackson song I used to listen to that as a teenager I'd play it over and over again even you know it just stirred my heart you know the and even it's so unique of a song lyrics are even hard to find uh so I actually had to listen to the song again and and just jot down a few of the real burners brother brandham talks about this very song in 1955 in mzc Prince and King and she says when the choir has sung its last Anthem I should have played her singing it to you today and the preacher has prayed his last prayer and the people have heard their last sermon and the world that's rejected its savior will be asked for a reason she says what then when the choir sung its last anthem when you've ever heard the last sermon you'll ever hear on this life what then when the world stands there on that day at the Judgment bar I I remember brother Ernie told me just sometime before he passed away he had a dream and he said brother Jason he come telling me about it he said brother Jason he said in my dream I saw millions of people stand Before the Throne of God and he said I and and God asked them when they stood before his throne and he said here he said every person that stepped up God asked them the same question they bowed their head and W went away next person stood up he said there were Millions just coming up before the throne and he said every time somebody stepped up before the throne he said God would say to them what did you do with the last years of your life when you knew I was coming amen when a world that's rejected its savior Jackson saying they will be asked for a reason what then you know I I'm just going to skip some parts here I finished off on the last service that I preached to you in 2023 with an encouragement to let that year go with all of its failures and let's let's have Revival and let's start again with a new purpose am to move forward we talked about you know the sad day that it was for the world and yet in a strange twist it's a happy and a triumphant day for the bride I mean that's both that's not only a paradox that's a mind Bender amen I mean how is something so tragic for the world just what lies just ahead for them H H how do you get your mind around that as a reality and that's a reality versus we who are not on the other side yet we're still right here in the midst of all of this and for us it's a happy day say you love the world not at all see you say well then how how can you be thrilled because Jesus said to me when I see all of these things look up your Redemption draweth nigh I can't wait to be on the other side Hallelujah friends it is so it is such a wonderful thought to me I close my eyes and I just think about my life in glory my life not somewhere beyond the blue right back here right on this Earth with a millennial world no stress no anxiety nothing pressing you no no mistakes no failures no sickness no pains no heartaches no no [Laughter] taxes amen no no anxiety no I mean wake up every day with no anxiety at all nothing to worry about amen amen it I'm sorry and and it is sad it's brother brandom comes to his last sermon in 1964 I believe it is and he starts talking about that he said it's a very sad day for the world he said because it must now go off into complete Insanity and that was 64 and it certainly has happened but he says what a glorious time it is for the believer so you know that that was my message to you last time the year is ending but I'm not ending the year is ending one of these years is going to be it's going to be the last year but the the the the world order is ending but I'm not ending you're not ending oh how I'm here to tell you something friends the I'm not ending I'm just getting started the blood of Christ can you can you think about that you remember we're saved by grace through Faith but and so you say well I brother R said what does the blood do brother says the blood keeps you you're saved by grace through faith but the blood keeps you well how what does what does that even mean the blood perpetually speaks for you there's a Perpetual blood sacrifice laying there so that no matter what mistakes God's family would make God can't see it he he doesn't even aware of it because because the blood of Christ is speaking beautiful things the the blood of Christ is just constantly oh friends it's a Perpetual thing I I it's not it's not that I it's I you know I don't have unlimited lives what what what I have I mean the blood of Christ gives me unlimited restarts if I if I end last year and I'm disappointed well I can restart if I make a mistake I can restart Hallelujah I can repent it's not unlimited lives it's it's a life that's Eternal it's it's a life that never ends I have eternal life wherever I have failed I can rebuild that's what it is and that's what the blood is and that's what the blood does see that's what it is that's what it does Amen I'm going to close with this I've explained to you what the blood is and what it does but what it is not the blood of Christ is not a get out of jail free card the blood of Christ is not a get out of responsibility card as brother brandham said an overcomer doesn't get pushed through a piper you know and another way of saying that is poured into a mold and the mold closes and you dry and then he pulls you and Pops you out what a glorious Overcomer brother Bram says you know pushing you through a pipe meaning like pushing you through a form and bending you you know it's not about that and and the O the Overcomer doesn't get pushed through a pipe or formed out of a mold the work is still there to do and I have to face it and you have to face it yes the old year is gone the new year is here now what are you going to do about it I know what the world is doing but I all know but I also know what God is calling for in my life and in your life it's really just this simple who will accept the challenge who will say Lord I'll take the way I'll take the challenge I'll move forward I want your life I want your Victory if this is my last year I know you're coming and I want it to count the work is still there to do I'm I'm challenged to achieve Victory not just in this life you're challenged to re to to achieve victory Victory not just in the life to come but in the life you have now right now teenagers you are challenged to let the mind which was in Christ be in you it ain't all up to Mom and Dad to do it or brother Jason to do it it it's you you have to say what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ amen Isaac Watts published a a lot of songs some of them very familiar to us 1721 he wrote a certain song he lived in that era he wrote AAS and Did My Savior Bleed he wrote When I Survey the Wondrous Cross he wrote we're marching to Zion he wrote Joy to the World Isaac Watts great Gallant Christian man 1721 he wrote a song that brother brandham quoted often quoted a a a a a few bars and he wrote a song called am I a soldier of the Cross now it's a self- anwering question he he's he's actually going to pose it as a question am I a soldier of the Cross but then he's going to prove it to himself that he is and that if he is then this must be true this reality if if this is true then this must be true amen and he writes am I a soldier of the cross a follower of the lamb and Shall I Fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name that's a good question don't you think that's a fair question am I a soldier of the Cross ask yourself that today am I a soldier of the Cross watch says am I a soldier of the cross a follower of the Lamb Shall I Fear to own his cause are blushed to speak his name and here's the one brother brandham often uh talked about must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas a gripping question what do you want a free ride what you don't want to do your part is that your caliber you might be a fine young man a fine young sister but are you are you going to let everybody else do do you're fighting do your praying do your living must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas verse three are there no foes for me to face must I not stem the flood is this vile World a friend of Grace to help me on to God that's a wonderful conclusion I just say yes sir her this world and all of its evil is in one way a friend of Grace because it's spurring me I want out of here I want another world I want another existence he says sure that's how he opens the fourth verse sure and here's where brother brandham would pick it up sure I must fight if I would Reign increase my courage Lord that ought to be our desire today to say I must I must fight if I Would Rain increase my courage Lord I'll bear the toil endure the pain supported by the word thy Saints in all this glorious war did you know it's a war did you know it's a war do you know it's a war against evil and and and against Darkness and Light against Satan and God do you understand that's what's going on here thy Saints in all this glorious War shall conquer though they die they see the Triumph from afar amen by Faith's Discerning Eye when that illustrious day shall rise and all thy armies shine in Robes of Victory through the skies the glory shall be thine oh friends I'm not looking to be a charity case I I don't want somebody else doing my fighting for me I want to win my portion in the promised land Hallelujah bring on this new year Bring it on Bring on this new year and as many more as there are out there and I hope there's only a few but I I'm quite and I'm quite sure that I'll make more missteps and make more mistakes and I'm quite sure you will too but when it's all over I'll still be here when it's all over when Satan is a fading memory I'll still be here hallelujah 10 ,000 years will just be started amen amen do you believe that today brother Anthony you're going to have to come sing uh sing that again the more that I Surrender stand up friends let's stand I was I was amazed that that brother Anthony was singing that song the the the the trials the problems I face oh my and all of that and and now it's just it's just a part of Victory it's fading from my memory friends this is this is exactly what we have lived for this last day the bride of Christ has toiled for 2,000 years and 10,000 years from now 2,000 years won't seem like nothing I know this life can sometimes seem hard but listen friends the new year is ahead of you and the Lord May May direct you to implausible things that would even be impossible but I'm here to tell you you can trust him you can trust him he's never failed he's never lost a battle he's in control of it all so you know it for me I was I was I was all too happy just to let go of 2020 23 good grief when I was a kid I never thought I would see 2023 and and and now I've I've already been there done
