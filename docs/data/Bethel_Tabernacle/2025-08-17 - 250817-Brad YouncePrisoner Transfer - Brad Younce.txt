TRANSCRIPT
========================================
happy to be in church. Let's all stand. Let's bow our heads and have a word of prayer. Father, we just thank you for this day you give us, Lord. This opportunity to come into your house again. Father, I just pray you'd be with us today. Father, bless this portion of the morning service. Lord, bless the main service, our preachers when we speak into us today. Father, we need your anointing to come down the service today. Father, your people has many needs, Lord. May you grant their needs according to your riches and glory. Father, we just love you in Jesus name. Amen. Um I want to read in Colossians chap 1 verse 12 and 13. This is uh all of a sudden brother Matthew Smith was supposed to this morning but I think he's got sick or something. And so I kind of told Brother Jason, I kind of woke up early this morning on my mind. You're doing Sunday school. I said, "Whoa, I better do something real quick." Then I seen that text and I kind of waited to see if anybody would take it, but nobody nobody did. But it's this is the will of the Lord. Colossians 1:12, giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. And God bless you. Have your seats. You know, for a title, I title this a prisoner transfer. &gt;&gt; All right. Colossians 1 at 11:13 again it says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom which that word translate means transfer removed from one place to another &gt;&gt; it's a change of situation or a place you know you know Paul he he always like to tell people he was a prisoner &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner I Paul am a prisoner of Christ you know there's several places you know like over here in Filimon chapter 1, Paul says, "I'm Paul." That's the way he introduced himself. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ. So, what a way to introduce yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good morning. I'm Brad Jce and I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You go around this way to introduce yourselves. I'm a prisoner of Christ. You're going to be somebody's prisoner. But Rama says in in a prisoner he says I'd like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that will serve him truly to be his prisoner. A man has to surrender every ambition he's got, everything that he is, everything, his life, soul, body, will, ambitions, and everything else, and became and become a complete prisoner to Christ, who is the word. So, you must know exactly what it means to be a prisoner. &gt;&gt; We're all sitting here this morning, a prisoner. &gt;&gt; You're a prisoner to something. You might not have any chains on you, but if your eyes were opened spiritually, you see, you either got chained by the devil or you're chained by God. Are you a prisoner? A prisoner is a captive. Just simple as that. You're in bonds. You're a prisoner. A prisoner is someone who is physically confined, locked up in a jail, under arrest, deprived of your freedom by another power. You're restricted. You're unable to move about freely and subject to the authority &gt;&gt; of whatever holds you. &gt;&gt; It could be a spiritual or emotional prison. A prison always have to be behind bars. People can be prisoners of sin. &gt;&gt; We're bound by habits. We're bound by addictions or some kind of guilt that controls your life. John 8:34 says, "Whosoever committh sin is a servant of sin." &gt;&gt; So, we're prisoners of circumstances. We're trapped in some kind of fear, worry, or some kind of past mistakes. Prisoners of Christ. We're a prison. How many is a prisoner of Christ this morning? Apostle Paul often called himself a prisoner of of Jesus Christ because Ephesians 3:21 3:1 says, meaning he willingly surrendered his will and freedom to serve Christ. This is a positive imprisonment where love binds the believer to God. You know, sometimes people say, "I'm just a prisoner to my job or a prisoner to my own thoughts." You've heard that. People say that. It means that they feel trapped, restricted, unable to live freely in some area of their life. &gt;&gt; So to be a prisoner means your freedom is restricted and you are held under the control of someone, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; or something. &gt;&gt; Either by force like he was in jail or willingly, like Paul was being a prisoner of Christ. So, you're going to be someone's prisoner. &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's things that had to happen in order. You know, when Paul said, "I'm a prisoner of of Christ," things had to happen to Paul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you know what Paul Paul did before he was a prisoner of Christ. He was a prisoner of of the devil. Because he had, you know, when Stephen was sitting there being stoned, Paul was holding the coats of the people &gt;&gt; witnessing this. And Paul would get up and he would go arrest the Christians. and he he would go persecute them. But one day, Paul was traveling down a road. It was time for a prisoner transfer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where Paul was walking around in darkness, headed to a prison. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To put other people in prison. But somehow here come Jesus walking down in a light. Who are you, Lord? I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest. &gt;&gt; Prisoner transfer. It's from prisoner to from darkness to light. If you belong to God, it don't matter. If you're a prisoner of the devil, that there can be a prisoner transfer. Hallelujah. Of course, one prisoner is prisoner is moved from one p prison to another like from darkness to light. When somebody accepts Christ, you're leaving the devil. You're going toward toward God's liberty because who hath delivered us from the power of darkness has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. So, you're going from sin to grace. Now a prisoner, Paul says, now a prisoner of Christ from earthly bonds to heavenly freedom. That's where we are on a spiritual transfer is moving from one master to another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the greatest transfer is when Christ takes us out of Satan's jail and binds us with his love. Thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Saul was headed to arrest some Christians and put them in prison. But while he was on the road, a light appeared and it knocked Saul down. Saul was like, "Who are you?" He says, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." Saul was on his way to get to arrest some Christians. But himself got turned around and got arrested himself. God said, "His name is on my book. It was time for a change. It was time for a prisoner transfer." Jesus had blinded his eyes and Saul had a name change. Hallelujah. Jesus will cross our path one day. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And our name was changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we might have been called Miss Baptist, Miss Catholic, Miss Pentecostal, Miss &gt;&gt; But one day we got arrested. You know, when you get arrested, I don't care who you are, if you're a businessman, if you're a professional athlete, if you're just a normal person, when you get arrested, you lose all your identities. When they are sent to prison, they lose their identity. They take on a new one. &gt;&gt; You're no longer if you're President Trump and somehow you get arrested, put in prison, you're not called Trump. You got a number. &gt;&gt; You get a number put on your on your on your garment here. They're no longer their own person. Praise the Lord. When we got saved, we no longer became our own person. We do what he says. a change in the atmosphere. It'll change your life to live the way he wants us to live. We were out living a normal life. You work, you come home, day after day, we have a life we live. But when you are a prisoner, you have a life change. A prisoner is completely dependent on his capttor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are a prisoner, you're not your own person. You'll go to bed when they tell you to. You'll get up when they tell you to. You'll say, "It's time to go outside." You'll go when they tell you to. You'll come back in when they tell you to. &gt;&gt; You're a prisoner. You can't do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to go outside. You're going to exercise for a while. It's what they tell the prisoners. If you don't want to, you're going anyway. When you're a prisoner, you are marked. You're given a different identification. But when we become a prisoner of Jesus Christ, we become completely dependent on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I can't walk without him. &gt;&gt; I can't talk without him. I can't live without him. I've got to have him every day, every hour. Not every hour, every second. I've got to have him in my life. So, he gives you a choice. You could choose whose prisoner you want to be today. Have we made the right choice? &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to be a prisoner to someone, the devil or God. It's our choice. It's it's a decision time. It's prisoner transfer time. If you're going to be a prisoner of something, you're going to be in bondage to the devil or to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have that choice. That choice is set before us. Exactly. What are you going to do about it? Whose side are you on? &gt;&gt; You have that choice of whose side you're going to be on? One leads to death, the other leads to life. There is no in between. There's no fence sitters. You can't sit be sitting on no fence. I heard a story one time where a man was sitting on a was sitting on the fence and the devil was standing there looking at him and God was on one side going, "Come on. Come on. Get off the fence. Get over here on my side." He looked over at the devil. Devil wasn't even doing anything. But God kept saying, "Come on. Come on. You're on my side. Get on my side of the fence. Come on." He looked back at the devil says, "Why ain't you telling me to come to your side?" He says, ' Because you're already on the fence. You're on my side. &gt;&gt; So there's no fence sitters in this thing. You're going to be a prisoner to something. When you're a prisoner to the devil, he'll tell you to smoke, you'll go smoke. He'll tell you to drink, you'll go drink. He'll tell you to listen to something and you'll listen to it. He'll tell you all kind. He'll say, "Oh, it's just it's just a love song. It don't There's nothing wrong with a good love song. Wow. Dress and act any way you want to when you're by yourself. &gt;&gt; You're not. You're a prisoner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a prisoner. Oh, go ahead. Mama don't know. Daddy don't know. Husband and wife don't know. Pastor don't know. The church people don't know. Devil tells you to do stuff. But if you're a prisoner of God, God will tell you how to act. God will tell you who you got to act in holiness. You're going to be a prisoner. Let's be bound by God. &gt;&gt; God demands holiness. &gt;&gt; We're not to like to look like the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you're going to be someone's prisoner. We don't want to be like Samson. Says Samson gave God his strength to use, but he didn't give God his heart. He gave his heart to Delilah and gave his strength to God. But you've got to surrender soul, body, spirit, strength. So everything you are to the will of God and become a prisoner to him. &gt;&gt; So you're going to be somebody's prisoner. &gt;&gt; You don't belong to yourself. You're somebody's prisoner. You're either a prisoner of the devil knowing this is truth and won't surrender to it or a prisoner to the world and surrender to God. One or the other. You're either the devil's prisoner to sin or you're God's prisoner to righteousness. You're one of the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Samson thinks of all his great victories that he had won. And no doubt it come to his mind how that when he was a little boy that God had vindicated him, told his mother how that she must do, not drink strong drinks, watch her die, that she was bringing forth a Nazerite, how she had combed his hair, and told him, "Son, through these locks is a covenant with you that God that your strength will be laid in there. Don't never give it away. Don't never give away your secret. Don't never surrender it. Whatever you do, stay with it. Samson had all this in his mind thinking about all this. But Ephesians 4:1 says, Paul says, "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, &gt;&gt; beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called." &gt;&gt; A vocation is just a calling. &gt;&gt; What are you called to? So, it don't matter what you are this morning. If you're a deacon, a trustee, a preacher, a husband, a wife, walk worthy of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're a prisoner of Christ, that's what you will do. I therefore, the prison of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where you're called with all loneliness and meekness. Take, you know, take my yoke upon me and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart. That's what Jesus says. And you shall find rest unto your souls. So with all low and longsuffering forbearing, putting up with one another. I mean that's a prisoner. That's part of being a prison. Yeah. Putting up with one another. And brother Bram says in Christ the mystery of God revealed. Love one another above everything. Love one another. No matter what the devil tries to say. You're all one great sweet group now. &gt;&gt; But remember my warning. Satan won't let you stay that way. &gt;&gt; He'll shoot everything he has to bring somebody in to make his target. He'll bring some critic or unbeliever in, sit him down, cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things. Then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison and he'll start through the church with it. Don't you take sides with it. Don't you have nothing to do with anything else. you stay right, loving, sweet, and kind to one another. Pray for that man that he'll be saved, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we do that? &gt;&gt; Remember, he says the enemy will come and when he does, just cling that much closer together. You're going that bond and that one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't make yourself clanish. We are one. I can't say left hand, I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand. He's my left hand. I want him to stay there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the little tip of my finger, I want to stay right there. Every little part of my body stay right there. And God wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another. Right with one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Ephesians 4:3 says, "Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace." Endeavoring is a spiritual union. There is a union between God and his people, between Christ and his members, between the saints, between the saints and the saints. When I first read this, I was like, "What?" But he says God and his people between Christ and his members and between his saints and his saints &gt;&gt; and the bond of each union is love that is which knits and cements them together. The saints are united under one head and are members of one and the same body and should be the same mind and judgment &gt;&gt; and of one accord and heart and affection. This is called the unity of the people. You know, like what happened on the day of Pentecost when it's all in one accord. We we won't go there. In the bond of peace, the Arabic version of this says, "By the bond of love and peace, by maintaining peace among themselves and seeking those things which tend to make for peace, it's called a bond." &gt;&gt; So, we're prisoners of love. That's what brother Christ the mystery got revealed. And see, God himself made himself known and pulsated himself through the life that you're a prisoner to him. Now you are his love prisoner. &gt;&gt; How many love prisoners do we have this morning? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you become a prisoner, you become what God wants you to be. It's no longer you. You become that stature of a perfect man. When you're a prisoner of God, you'll do what God wants you to do. You'll walk like him. You'll talk like him. You'll act like him. You'll be him. So, when Paul wrote about being a prisoner of Jesus Christ, he was in prison, chained to a guard, like we mentioned last week. He couldn't go anywhere. You know, some of us are chained to Christ. Some are chained to the devil. Some are refused to be chained. So, if you're refused, we know who what you're chained by. Ain't nobody going to tell me what to do. Bless God. &gt;&gt; You don't know you're chained by the devil already. &gt;&gt; You're like that man in the in the gather rings. He gets chained, but they break the He broke can't breaking the chains. He was so demonpossessed. That should tell you where you're at. If you don't want no chains, but when you're chained, you're harnessed. It doesn't It don't matter to you. You know, when you skydiving, you're getting ready to jump out of a plane. How many skydive in here? &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Nobody. &gt;&gt; When you jump out of a plane, you're harnessed to something. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you bungee jumping, you better thank the Lord. You're harnessed to something. It don't matter what you're doing, you're harnessed to it. Paul, brother says in a prisoner, Paul knew what it was. He found out that he was harnessed to something. You know, a horse is a harness is to pull something. But he realized that God had chosen him and hath harnessed him by the Holy Spirit. The experience that he had to pull the gospel to the presence of the Gentiles. The spirit itself harnessed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So today as servants of Christ, we become harnessed, hooked up. We can't go anywhere without it being with us. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. We can't go anywhere without him being with us. We're harnessed to the word. No matter what anyone says, you're harnessed to it. There's something about it that you just can't get away from it. You've been yolked up by the Holy Ghost has yolked you to the word. No matter up, no, no matter what anyone else says, it's the word that's always harnessed up to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put it in the yoke with it. That's the word in the spirit. He was harnessed. So he he says we must come back to the Bible times for this day. They failed to I'll skip that. But that's something else. What a great time Paul. He's talking about he knew that he could not go to places that being harnessed to this that he would not go. &gt;&gt; There's places you can't go when you're harnessed up to Christ. &gt;&gt; When you're hooked up to Christ, you're chained to him only. You'll go where he goes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, come on. We're going to church. God makes us go to church. We're going to go. You only look at what he looks at. So when you pick up your phone and you're looking at stuff, &gt;&gt; is that what Christ would look at? &gt;&gt; You only do what he says do. You are harnessed to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So whose prisoner are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ. I want to read this this scripture or this quote again we just read at the beginning and I like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that will serve him truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition &gt;&gt; he's got everything that he is everything his life soul body will be so that's everything &gt;&gt; he ain't leaving anything out and everything else and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
