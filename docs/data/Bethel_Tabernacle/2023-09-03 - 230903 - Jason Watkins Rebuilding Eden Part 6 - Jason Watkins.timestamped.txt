[27:28] they'll be on the road coming back and
[27:30] they want the Lord to just amen give
[27:32] them a great great blessing amen I got
[27:35] one request that came in from Brother
[27:38] Bruce concerning sister Linda I want to
[27:41] take that to the Lord just in a moment
[27:43] when we pray and she's been having
[27:46] severe headaches which causes nausea and
[27:50] a constant nagging cough so there's some
[27:53] things that are uh are
[27:57] from her medications and different
[27:59] things as Brother Bruce said that one I
[28:01] read here's the here's the updated one
[28:03] yes a very fitful night last night with
[28:08] various medical things she's been
[28:09] dealing with
[28:11] amen so they're asking prayer for her
[28:14] this morning we sure want to ask the
[28:16] Lord for that
[28:18] amen God bless you uh we're going to
[28:21] turn right into Matthew's gospel
[28:24] um
[28:25] this morning I want by the help of the
[28:27] Lord
[28:28] get back to another installment in the
[28:32] series we've been working on rebuilding
[28:34] Eden
[28:36] and I want to make some more progress
[28:38] today this would be part six amen
[28:42] Matthew chapter 12. where we'll be
[28:45] headed to you can read it also from I
[28:48] think it's also recorded in Luke but
[28:50] we're going to catch this reading they
[28:51] seem to be pretty much identical amen
[28:54] praise the Lord
[28:58] uh Matthew chapter 12 just one verse and
[29:01] we're going to let you be seated after
[29:04] we will read this verse and we'll have
[29:07] prayer and then you can be seated
[29:08] Matthew chapter 12 and just one verse in
[29:11] verse 42.
[29:15] he's a speaking the queen of the South
[29:18] shall rise up in judgment with this
[29:21] generation
[29:22] and shall condemn it
[29:24] for she came from the uttermost parts of
[29:27] the Earth
[29:28] to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold
[29:32] a greater than Solomon
[29:36] let's power hearts in our heads this
[29:39] morning Father
[29:41] we thank you this morning Lord for this
[29:43] Gathering of people for the songs Lord
[29:46] of Zion that have been sung in the
[29:48] worship Lord I trust that you have been
[29:52] made to feel and that you presently do
[29:54] feel very welcome Lord in our midst
[29:57] we're here today with the need to hear
[29:59] from you Lord I pray that your word will
[30:02] come forth to meet every need in the
[30:04] building father and those who would be
[30:06] listening out across the airwaves or
[30:08] hear it at a later time we humble
[30:10] ourselves before you now we ask for your
[30:13] anointing once again Lord once more
[30:16] father let your word go forth Lord with
[30:19] clear understanding that it might
[30:22] accomplish the reason it was sent for
[30:24] now father we are asking humbly for our
[30:27] dear sister Linda Paris Lord that you
[30:30] would be very kind to her this morning
[30:32] and show a great kindness Lord touch our
[30:36] sister Lord may she find relief there's
[30:39] others Lord that are perhaps unspoken
[30:41] Quest that I don't see any request him
[30:44] but I know that some others are sick and
[30:46] not feeling well today so I pray for
[30:49] them you know all about it Lord now
[30:50] bless the word bless the speaker and the
[30:53] hearers we pray in Jesus name amen God
[30:56] bless you friends you can be seated
[31:07] amen we'll have my title slide up Noah
[31:10] thank you
[31:16] so the queen of the south of course this
[31:18] is we who we know to be the Queen of
[31:21] Sheba who came to hear the wisdom of
[31:25] Solomon and I want you to catch my
[31:28] subtitle there on the titles on the
[31:30] title slide my subtitle is choosing the
[31:34] right path to Redemption there there's
[31:37] nothing more valuable to you than
[31:40] Redemption no matter what you would ever
[31:42] achieve in this life if you miss out on
[31:45] that you miss everything oh everything
[31:48] that you could accomplish whatever
[31:49] station you could arrive to whatever uh
[31:54] fortune and Glory whatever social
[31:56] standing whatever uh influence and as an
[32:01] influencer you might be in the world if
[32:04] you miss out on the Redemption of your
[32:06] soul then your life has been lived in
[32:09] vain your life wasn't given to you
[32:14] to be famous in the world it is
[32:17] generally not as James taught us it is
[32:21] very generally at their exceptions but
[32:23] it is generally not the the famous and
[32:26] the wise of the world that God goes
[32:29] after God goes after Humble Hearts his
[32:32] family are simple people who just are
[32:36] simple enough to have the wonderful uh
[32:39] unique ability to just believe God just
[32:42] believe him just say he said it I
[32:44] believe it there's nothing else now as
[32:47] the old timer would say enough said God
[32:50] said it I believe it
[32:52] I've said see so so we find that this is
[32:56] a a wonderful treasure that we have to
[33:00] be able to see the things especially
[33:04] considering that it is that scripturally
[33:08] speaking that the overwhelming oh and
[33:11] that's really an understatement but I
[33:13] can't think of a stronger word but the
[33:16] overwhelming majority of humanity since
[33:21] the Garden of Eden according to the
[33:23] Bible are will be lost and destroyed by
[33:28] their own refusal to believe God's
[33:31] simple word
[33:32] it is a very rare a very small Jesus
[33:36] declared it you see it all through the
[33:37] Old Testament stories you find that
[33:40] brother Branham you know Jesus talked
[33:42] about straight As the gate narrow is the
[33:44] way that leadeth unto redemption or
[33:47] salvation and there will only be a few
[33:50] that find it brother Branham talks about
[33:52] that uh you know when they're asking him
[33:55] concerning the Rapture and brother
[33:57] Branham says you know you can see in the
[34:00] Book of Revelation that
[34:02] John sees a number that no man could
[34:05] number but a prophet says but don't
[34:07] forget that's across thousands of years
[34:10] and multiple ages but that he says when
[34:14] it comes to that Rapture there will just
[34:16] be a very few make that rapture
[34:20] see a very few and so we're we're we're
[34:24] we're we're we're realizing today that
[34:26] that we can't save the world from its
[34:30] annihilation in fact is the gospel this
[34:33] might shock you but the gospel didn't
[34:36] come to save the world from its
[34:38] Annihilation the fact that God is it's
[34:40] because God's not going to destroy it
[34:42] anyway it's simply going to transition
[34:45] and that's going to happen and all the
[34:48] king's horses and all the king's men
[34:49] can't stop that
[34:52] you understand the same Jesus that sent
[34:55] his disciples with the gospel foretold
[34:59] of the world being destroyed that it was
[35:02] going to transition and that Israel
[35:05] wouldn't receive it now but she would
[35:07] eventually be restored as the leading
[35:09] nation of the earth she's a far cry from
[35:12] that now and you're never going to get
[35:13] the world to vote on that but we find
[35:16] that God's going to bypass the will of
[35:18] Fallen man and he's going to establish
[35:21] his will in the earth and I just find
[35:23] myself incredibly happy today that I
[35:27] have come across an agreement in my
[35:29] heart something inside of me says Lord I
[35:32] agree with you
[35:34] no matter what you're saying I just want
[35:36] you to know I'll agree with you today
[35:38] I'll agree with you tomorrow whatever
[35:41] befalls whatever I face whatever happens
[35:44] whatever transpires I'm in this for
[35:48] Keeps
[35:52] previously in our series we've looked
[35:56] closely at Abel coming forward
[35:59] we broke it down how that he was
[36:02] bringing a proper offering that was
[36:05] designated to appease God God who had my
[36:10] had given so much
[36:13] to humanity gave mankind everything that
[36:17] he could ever need life
[36:19] eternal and a perfect perfect life at
[36:23] that and a a beautiful world that where
[36:25] there was no sin or disease or sickness
[36:28] he didn't have to work by the sweat of
[36:30] his brow everything all was peace
[36:32] forevermore every day was was Heaven on
[36:36] Earth
[36:37] and so it's so sad that he was repaid
[36:41] with disobedience from his from the very
[36:45] family that he had been given life to
[36:49] we found that Abel came forward to try
[36:51] if possible to set things right between
[36:55] himself and his maker and it worked
[37:00] amen
[37:01] good news it worked
[37:04] it demonstrated that you know when you
[37:07] when you bring to God something that is
[37:11] according to his word he will supply you
[37:15] with everything you need for life
[37:19] he will give you every good gift that he
[37:22] can send down from above he will open
[37:24] the storerooms of his treasures and send
[37:27] you down blessing on top of blessing and
[37:29] he will help you and he will give you
[37:32] Liberty from the devil and he will set
[37:34] you back in your right mind and he will
[37:36] give you a purpose for your life all you
[37:39] have to do
[37:40] has come his provided path
[37:43] you have to choose the right path to
[37:46] Redemption there would be a path it
[37:48] wouldn't be willy-nilly or random and
[37:51] you certainly don't get to decide that
[37:53] since Humanity was the one who broke the
[37:56] world and collapsed and brought sin into
[37:58] the world I think it's a pretty a pretty
[38:02] reasonable that God says how about I
[38:04] figure out how to fix it
[38:11] it's beautiful because Abel was
[38:14] Abel was so overwhelmingly successful
[38:19] uh and and you can see that in that God
[38:23] gave an immediate and and no restrained
[38:29] respect to his offering of an innocent
[38:33] life to be given in sacrifice for the
[38:37] guilty it's not as atheists would like
[38:41] to say oh a bloody God a crew God has
[38:44] nothing to do with that God wasn't
[38:47] satisfied with Abel slaughtering one of
[38:50] his animals God God did that didn't
[38:53] bring God Joy even the death of The
[38:56] Sinner does not bring God Joy God wishes
[39:00] for all men to be saved and takes no
[39:03] pleasure in the death of even his
[39:06] enemies as we said last time here he is
[39:09] in a conversation with Cain and God's
[39:11] love is so great that he's trying to
[39:14] save his arch enemy's son
[39:18] now his Lucifer had already made his
[39:22] choice he had already denied and crossed
[39:25] the line between judgment and mercy but
[39:28] God so loved the world and loved life
[39:30] that he's actually trying to coax the
[39:34] son of his arch enemy into accepting
[39:38] just accept a a kind of a way uh just
[39:41] you know you'll never get the Revelation
[39:43] but if you'll just do like your brother
[39:45] then I'll find a way to save you
[39:49] and God does that he'll do that at the
[39:52] Judgment bar he'll try to save everybody
[39:54] he can everybody who had any type any
[39:58] even the even the you find that even the
[40:00] it's he's not going to save you for
[40:03] iniquitous works that's nauseating to
[40:05] him so don't go around trying to do good
[40:07] deeds and earn your way into heaven
[40:08] that's that's never going to end well
[40:11] for you but but where the ones that you
[40:13] do see him saving are those who who just
[40:17] they had the right heart response to at
[40:20] whatever level that God revealed himself
[40:23] at whatever level they saw as much as
[40:25] they could see they responded in their
[40:27] heart to that and it became a natural
[40:29] response they didn't even know they were
[40:32] pleasing him
[40:35] this is how broad and deep and wide is
[40:40] the love of God
[40:42] see
[40:43] and so it's it's not about you know God
[40:46] is not satisfied with the fact that he's
[40:49] not getting Glee out of the fact that
[40:52] one of his innocent Lambs is being
[40:54] slaughtered while it cries and bleats
[40:57] and bleeds out and begging you know if
[41:00] it could speak language begging for this
[41:03] human not to kill him what are you doing
[41:05] you know why are you chopping at my
[41:07] throat why am I on this rock why why are
[41:10] you killing me and and it's not that
[41:13] Abel is getting satisfaction or that God
[41:16] is getting satisfaction but Abel found
[41:19] an overwhelming success uh by getting
[41:22] God's respect because God could see that
[41:26] someday this was this was a testimony
[41:29] that someday he would come as the Lamb
[41:32] of God and he would allow himself to be
[41:35] slaughtered by Humanity to do what to
[41:39] save Humanity
[41:43] it's amazing that God would do it that
[41:46] way
[41:49] God would in fact is God would require
[41:53] nothing more of Abel
[41:56] nothing more because this sacrifice God
[42:01] would see that it's fulfilling his
[42:04] purpose
[42:06] that he has in an age to come
[42:10] where once again I want to say to you
[42:13] today very happily
[42:15] where once again God will require
[42:18] nothing more of you
[42:21] just like he required nothing more of
[42:24] Abel than to bring the right sacrifice
[42:26] and I'm here to tell you you can't earn
[42:29] your way into heaven but good news you
[42:31] don't have to God will require nothing
[42:33] from you but that you accept the once
[42:37] and for all time sacrifice of the Lamb
[42:40] of God given on your behalf
[42:46] and that he died he died once unto sin
[42:49] and in that he dieth no more the Bible
[42:51] says he doesn't need to once you've
[42:53] passed from Death unto life you can
[42:56] never come into the Judgment you've
[42:58] passed into life you've passed into
[43:00] Mercy you have entered back into that
[43:02] place of fellowship with God and from
[43:05] that point there's not enough devils in
[43:08] Hell Or Not Enough mistakes in your life
[43:10] to ever undo that that change that God
[43:15] has brought in you
[43:18] by this God can restore and he does
[43:21] restore your soul back to an eternal
[43:24] State and nothing more could ever be
[43:27] required of you than to believe in him
[43:29] and to accept him as Lord in your life
[43:33] are you willing to do that today good
[43:35] then you're on the path to Redemption
[43:39] amen allowing him to do the work of
[43:42] redemption allowing him
[43:44] say what it what is rebuilding brother
[43:46] Jason you're this is part six of
[43:49] rebuilding Eden what is it he's
[43:51] rebuilding he's re not just building a
[43:53] new world back he's not just changing
[43:56] the geography of the earth and restoring
[43:59] a garden he's he's before he can restore
[44:02] and Eden he's got to restore Adam and
[44:05] Eve oh my and that's what he's doing
[44:08] today friends say what is it he's
[44:10] restoring in me he's restoring in you
[44:12] that thing that they had that unbroken
[44:16] unlimited Fellowship not not God in
[44:20] heaven or way across the ocean but face
[44:22] to face lift here to be able to commune
[44:25] with Christ almighty God
[44:30] he's restoring that Fellowship where
[44:33] where his mind is your mind and his
[44:37] thoughts and his desires can literally
[44:40] become your entire desire that's what
[44:43] the Holy Ghost does for your friends it
[44:45] restores Fellowship to where you can
[44:47] think like him and act like him and love
[44:50] like him and forgive like him and desire
[44:53] like him
[44:57] of course we
[44:59] found in previous
[45:01] installments uh I'm not going to go down
[45:03] the trail of it today again
[45:07] just to remind you that immediately
[45:11] we found his
[45:13] half-twin brother
[45:15] trying to impersonate
[45:17] this action
[45:19] through reasoning unwilling to come
[45:21] God's way
[45:23] uh it wouldn't end good for for Cain
[45:28] so we find then that it begs the
[45:31] question today
[45:32] what is
[45:34] what what is it that the impersonation
[45:39] of Christianity cannot produce
[45:44] what is it preacher that the
[45:47] impersonation of Christianity cannot
[45:50] produce because we do see people singing
[45:54] songs out of hymnals and we do see
[45:57] people reading scriptures out of the
[45:59] Bible and we do see churches and we do
[46:02] see music and we do see people in their
[46:05] Sunday clothes and we do see tears and
[46:08] we do see hands up and and we do hear
[46:12] singing and we do see program
[46:15] and we and we we seek good deeds and
[46:17] good works and and goodness and good
[46:19] that but and and an impersonation of
[46:22] Christianity can do all of that because
[46:24] it impersonates the fine qualities of
[46:28] Jesus that's what brother Branham called
[46:30] it they they they it's not a hard change
[46:34] not a heart transplant
[46:36] but it is a mental acceptance because
[46:38] they admire the fine qualities of Jesus
[46:42] well who wouldn't he was the finest man
[46:44] to ever live
[46:45] he was the most noble most honest most
[46:48] kind most helpful most sacrificial most
[46:51] humble most everything most true most
[46:53] pure there's never a man like this man
[46:59] who own the world and everything on it
[47:01] but allowed himself to be taken down
[47:05] so that he could lift himself back up
[47:07] and bring his family with him oh
[47:10] Hallelujah because I live you can live
[47:13] also hallelujah what a promise to the
[47:16] world in its sad condition so if we see
[47:19] all of these things that impersonation
[47:21] of Christianity can produce brother
[47:24] Jason what is it what is that which the
[47:27] impersonation of Christianity cannot
[47:29] produce there is one thing you say only
[47:32] one well it just so happens that it's
[47:35] the most vital thing to happen in this
[47:38] day and that is an impersonation of
[47:41] Christianity cannot produce a word
[47:44] Revival
[47:48] cannot
[47:49] an impersonation of Christianity cannot
[47:53] restore you back to fellowship
[47:56] which is what a Revival of the word does
[48:00] because when the when the word I mean
[48:03] everything is predicated upon faith in
[48:07] the word everything
[48:09] and the the the the the Seven Virtues
[48:12] that Simon Peter describes began with
[48:15] the foundation of faith God when he
[48:18] spoke the world into existence he even
[48:20] had to believe his own word see and so
[48:24] so we realized that that faith in the
[48:26] word brings a a Revival of life it the
[48:30] the word Revival
[48:32] the the the the the the
[48:34] Revival of the word brings back every
[48:38] every Power every influence every
[48:42] strength every energy that you have
[48:45] needed do need or couldn't ever need and
[48:49] I don't even know what tomorrow holds
[48:52] for any of you including myself but I do
[48:55] know this a word revival can meet the
[48:57] challenge of Satan any time any place
[49:01] and under any condition and I don't have
[49:04] to back up and I don't have to run
[49:06] scared I can stand on the word of God
[49:08] and Proclaim it and it will it will
[49:11] release creative power we've seen that
[49:14] happen
[49:19] the reason being is that when you
[49:23] when you choose
[49:25] an impersonation of Christianity you're
[49:28] basing it's just based on man-made
[49:30] systems of reasoning
[49:34] and the problem is is the reason there
[49:37] can't be a word Revival is that they
[49:41] when you do that you only go further and
[49:45] further away as time goes on you move
[49:49] further away from
[49:52] the original
[49:54] once you once you take the original word
[49:57] and you mongrelize it at all and by
[50:01] injecting man-made ideology the moment
[50:05] you do that that's the closest you'll
[50:07] ever be again to the word and from there
[50:10] you'll just drift away and away and away
[50:13] and you can never get back
[50:17] you could never get back
[50:19] now
[50:21] see the a word Revival doesn't fade away
[50:26] a word Revival draws you to
[50:30] it draws you back to the original say
[50:34] What's the value of that the original is
[50:36] where the life is
[50:37] The Originals where everything is
[50:40] I mean that's the natural types of
[50:42] spiritual you can see that in physical
[50:44] science
[50:45] you they they they know and this is this
[50:48] is factual it's a physics is kind of my
[50:50] hobby side hobby thing but but I but I I
[50:54] happen to know that that you cannot man
[50:58] can't Mankind in this realm cannot see
[51:03] the beginning of the universe
[51:07] now the reason for that is is because he
[51:11] he cannot see back to the Big Bang it's
[51:13] impossible now brother Branham didn't
[51:15] use that term brother Branham called it
[51:17] uh Adam bursted
[51:19] God spoke and an atom burst it so big
[51:22] bang fine I have no problem with the big
[51:24] bangers that's what they want to call it
[51:25] uh like brother Joe Daniels says I I
[51:28] don't care about the Big Bang that's
[51:30] fine just tell me who pulled the trigger
[51:33] foreign
[51:38] they were talking about the Cradle of
[51:40] mankind and they start talking about
[51:42] that and that's what brother Joe told
[51:44] him I don't care about the Big Bang
[51:45] that's fine but I just want to know who
[51:47] pulled the trigger
[51:49] somebody did
[51:51] a prophet said God did God spoke and
[51:54] then Adam burst it and so the reason now
[51:57] but now what that means is is that the
[52:01] only way you see at distance is light
[52:03] travels through space and you're looking
[52:05] at stars perhaps that were formed or
[52:09] burned out eons ago but the light is
[52:11] just now reaching the Earth and you see
[52:13] it like there it is but actually it's
[52:16] already gone or another one's already
[52:18] replaced it and the universe is
[52:21] expanding they know that that that it's
[52:23] expanding from the center I know that we
[52:25] think we're in the center of the
[52:26] universe you're actually not you're not
[52:27] even in the center of your own Galaxy
[52:29] but but we find that that once the bank
[52:33] ex once the first atom bursted and to
[52:37] use brother branham's language clinkers
[52:39] flew everywhere they went out in all
[52:41] directions
[52:42] burning molten lava burning and and
[52:46] hurling out through space I mean and and
[52:49] so because that it's because we're
[52:51] moving away from it there's no way for
[52:54] the light to ever reach us so you can't
[52:57] see back that far I mean in fact is they
[53:00] can see radiation uh kind of a leftover
[53:02] signature in it well once one space
[53:05] became transparent at first that was
[53:07] wasn't the case and brother Brandon's
[53:09] language proves that that it was almost
[53:11] a burning molten hot lava it was all
[53:13] chaos
[53:14] see it's beautiful when you when you let
[53:18] science agree with God's science
[53:22] it becomes a beautiful thing to look at
[53:24] because you can see these types and
[53:25] shadows and so because we've been blown
[53:28] out we're constantly moving away from
[53:30] what that was so the light of that
[53:31] there's no way for us to ever go back
[53:33] and see that now on the other side I
[53:35] think everything's going to be different
[53:38] But but so you so you just understand so
[53:41] you can the most we can see is traces of
[53:43] radiation left over uh but that's
[53:48] even they know it's almost 400 000 years
[53:52] after the Adam
[54:00] so let's see one please
[54:05] work
[54:13] you can't you can't try to use human
[54:17] breathing because sooner you human
[54:19] reasoning
[54:25] I'm not sure
[54:27] sorry sorry
[54:34] you know I I love it when
[54:37] when bro comes along and can describe
[54:42] that me in detail
[54:45] because I promise you after physicists
[54:49] have a lot of captions understanding and
[54:52] they also taste like what I don't know
[54:54] well we're not sure what we think but we
[54:57] don't know
[54:58] Nation
[55:08] and then this is
[55:14] [Music]
[55:20] stop
[55:23] and they stopped and pull everything the
[55:27] Bible said on creation everything is
[55:31] confidence
[56:24] to you
[56:27] okay
[56:32] to do that
[56:40] it's a beautiful thing
[56:42] God
[56:50] of course because
[57:02] here
[57:06] and they better have fun and it goes
[57:08] better perfect
[57:10] with his body
[57:12] one thing wrong
[57:15] he went to the presence of God
[57:18] most Moses
[57:28] because it was a prophet
[57:30] and at the office understands
[57:37] it's minister of tradition Jesus came to
[57:40] the office of man
[57:50] of God revealed
[58:03] so this is
[58:06] human reason
[58:08] and God's right away you can store
[58:12] Fellowship Fellowship God is restored
[58:16] your are you end up break the mind of
[58:19] Christ what advantage that is
[58:29] so if you if you want to take the path
[58:35] that strong human reasoning
[58:39] [Music]
[58:40] good look at that
[58:43] that's free
[58:45] my house
[58:50] a word Revival and I like this is what
[58:54] rebuilding even is all about
[58:57] it's not just rebuilding a land where we
[59:00] go but he's rebuilding me
[59:03] what is he what does he think he's not
[59:07] building into something he's reading you
[59:10] back
[59:17] this is
[59:25] sent Jesus Christ
[59:46] oh
[1:00:06] I have no other source job
[1:00:15] find my boat
[1:00:19] afraid
[1:00:23] no dent I was looking for a song we were
[1:00:26] rooms and freaks children
[1:00:34] like that with a club Owners
[1:00:43] but now after 2 000 years
[1:00:48] but now after two thousand years of
[1:00:50] theology teaching
[1:00:53] now the entire church the elect Church
[1:00:56] looking for the Messiah
[1:00:58] now he have to act when he's coming this
[1:01:01] time just like he did he will have to do
[1:01:06] the same thing
[1:01:08] he would do it
[1:01:10] there's
[1:01:12] there is going to be
[1:01:15] billions
[1:01:20] with the population
[1:01:29] are going to miss out on heaven
[1:01:33] simply because didn't follow them right
[1:01:36] there
[1:02:03] know that
[1:02:45] one chance
[1:02:47] see
[1:02:50] oh my God
[1:02:59] he conquered death
[1:03:01] by the real seed
[1:03:04] them
[1:03:11] all right
[1:03:13] foreign
[1:03:27] that
[1:03:45] conked up again
[1:03:55] amen he is still here alive
[1:04:09] in that
[1:04:11] there was a match
[1:04:15] Abraham that's what an important point
[1:04:19] was the price let me give you an
[1:04:21] illustration
[1:04:22] I don't remember
[1:04:25] the person anytime
[1:04:28] if you ever read me doing
[1:04:33] program
[1:04:35] come to the geology and never skip
[1:04:39] and some of the most profound foods are
[1:04:41] actually
[1:04:42] and and other things that you'll notice
[1:04:45] is you'll find it pick up certain image
[1:05:12] people
[1:05:15] track
[1:05:19] but then but every once in a while when
[1:05:22] you read through genealogy you read
[1:05:24] about and when turning this one out and
[1:05:27] then went from and then he traveled and
[1:05:30] my wife had a son and then and then you
[1:05:34] you literally all the way through and
[1:05:37] find potentials coming all the way up up
[1:05:39] control all the way through Abraham oh
[1:05:42] no all the way you can go all the way
[1:05:45] through Moses and come through the
[1:05:48] Prophet come all the way in and you feed
[1:05:51] it all right Jesus
[1:05:54] is the Priceline

[1:08:18] for one purpose to see
[1:08:21] Central if God was real
[1:08:26] because everything that everybody

[1:08:41] that Revival of Solomon's we've got here
[1:08:45] but

[1:08:50] information
[1:09:07] true
[1:09:17] God be more than this
[1:09:22] at a church and a bishop and and church
[1:09:25] services and more Royal duties and I
[1:09:27] just I age out and I die and the next
[1:09:29] Queen comes along behind me I can't
[1:09:31] accept that that's all I'm here for
[1:09:36] you know what was down inside her heart
[1:09:38] a Christ's seed
[1:09:39] a Christ line as we talked to you last
[1:09:42] time about a receiving set you remember
[1:09:44] brother brother Ed found that great big
[1:09:46] tower there in the Canadian wilderness
[1:09:47] and he said it's sending out signals and
[1:09:49] receiving signals he said I didn't hear
[1:09:51] any of it because I don't have a
[1:09:53] receiving set he said if I had a
[1:09:55] receiving said I could hear what the
[1:09:57] signals are being transferred and that's
[1:09:58] what's happening the sound of the Gospel
[1:10:00] went into all the world but they
[1:10:02] couldn't mix it with faith they heard
[1:10:04] preachers preach but it meant nothing to
[1:10:06] them but to you and I when we heard the
[1:10:09] gospel it meant something
[1:10:11] something we couldn't even put in words
[1:10:13] something we couldn't quite explain or
[1:10:16] put our finger on but we we knew I have
[1:10:18] to go this way well it'll cost you your
[1:10:21] family well I still got to go your
[1:10:23] friend your career your hair I still
[1:10:25] gotta go this way
[1:10:27] are you crazy maybe but I can't resist
[1:10:30] it I'm what is it you're hearing I don't
[1:10:32] know but I'm hearing from another realm
[1:10:35] drawing me to something
[1:10:38] you can't explain Revelation it's
[1:10:40] impossible you sound you sound nuts
[1:10:44] that people lay aside everything in the
[1:10:46] world and all their Pursuits like Paul
[1:10:49] mean nothing
[1:10:51] Paul a Pharisee of the Pharisees first
[1:10:54] in his class
[1:10:56] absolutely the the president of the
[1:10:59] student body I I don't even know what
[1:11:01] the one is will you graduate with the
[1:11:03] top honors what they call that but but
[1:11:05] Paul was all of that
[1:11:07] and he says he says I forgot it all to
[1:11:12] do why'd you do that so that I could
[1:11:14] know him
[1:11:16] oh I could a preacher could have told
[1:11:18] you about him no not like that I want to
[1:11:20] know him in the power of his
[1:11:21] resurrection I would annoy him in the
[1:11:23] fellowship of his sufferings I want to
[1:11:25] you understand I want to know him I
[1:11:27] don't want to know about him I want to
[1:11:29] know him
[1:11:35] two incredibly Brave young women
[1:11:39] who couldn't be more different yet they
[1:11:41] were very much the same
[1:11:43] separated by hundreds of years
[1:11:48] lived in different parts of the Earth
[1:11:51] yet they shared a a deep feeling
[1:11:55] in their heart of hearts that if they're
[1:11:57] really was a true God
[1:12:00] surely he would be like the god of
[1:12:03] Israel that they had heard so much about
[1:12:07] brother Bynum tells the story much
[1:12:09] better than I can he's such a master at
[1:12:12] it
[1:12:13] he says in the Queen of Sheba
[1:12:16] he says just think the people passing by
[1:12:20] these would be the Caravan she didn't
[1:12:21] have internet back then
[1:12:24] just think the people passing by would
[1:12:26] say oh you should come to our nation see
[1:12:28] our great power for God why he works
[1:12:31] among our people he he does great signs
[1:12:35] and wonders and we got a king called
[1:12:38] Solomon you should see the great
[1:12:40] discernment that man's God why it's
[1:12:42] beyond thought well you know Faith
[1:12:44] cometh by hearing doesn't it hearing the
[1:12:47] word of God see so the nudes spread all
[1:12:51] over the world everywhere heard about
[1:12:53] this and they all began to fear because
[1:12:55] not fearing Solomon but fearing God
[1:12:58] because the Living God was showing
[1:13:01] finally the news got way down into Sheba
[1:13:04] way down about 300 miles south way down
[1:13:08] across the Sahara Desert now they didn't
[1:13:11] have television in them days and radio
[1:13:14] and newspapers and telephones they just
[1:13:16] traveled by lip to ear and Caravans
[1:13:18] would come through and bring the news
[1:13:20] and everybody come down into Sheba would
[1:13:22] say to this to the little Queen say you
[1:13:25] should go into Palestine you know they
[1:13:27] got a god up there that so blessed them
[1:13:29] people they're all with one Accord
[1:13:31] there's no friction among them at all
[1:13:36] and they got a a brother up there they
[1:13:39] call him Solomon they've made him the
[1:13:41] king and they tell me that God uses him
[1:13:44] for everything they got they have need
[1:13:47] of for everything they got they have
[1:13:49] need of he he's he just was able to tell
[1:13:53] them you know the faith cometh by what
[1:13:55] hearing the word and blessed are they
[1:13:58] that do hunger and thirst after
[1:13:59] righteousness they shall be filled
[1:14:01] so the little Queen began to hunger she
[1:14:05] thought you know I'll have to go see
[1:14:08] that now you remember she's got a lot of
[1:14:11] prestige you know because she's Queen so
[1:14:15] I suppose she said well before I go
[1:14:18] before I do this now I better go ask the
[1:14:21] pastor whether I can go or not see
[1:14:24] because I have to get permission from my
[1:14:27] denomination Wow have a hard time
[1:14:29] reading this
[1:14:30] have to get permission from my
[1:14:32] denomination because that that's another
[1:14:35] denomination see I better go ask my
[1:14:37] pastor if I can go am I free

[1:14:54] Lord Jesus Christ

[1:15:09] guard with her and she said Holy Father

[1:15:37] nothing to it
[1:15:39] it's a bunch of Holy Rollers there's
[1:15:42] nothing to it but look if there was any
[1:15:46] power in God it would be in our God
[1:15:49] right here it would come to our
[1:15:51] organization it would be ours if there's
[1:15:53] anything to it see oh brother you know
[1:15:56] the devil takes his man but never Spirit
[1:15:59] that's right God takes his two but never
[1:16:01] his spirit
[1:16:03] he took Elijah but his Spirit come upon
[1:16:06] Elisha then it come on John the Baptist
[1:16:09] and he took his son Jesus see but the
[1:16:12] Holy Ghost come back in the church to do
[1:16:14] the same Works he that believeth on me
[1:16:17] the works that I do shall he do also see
[1:16:19] keeps on going down and the devil takes
[1:16:21] this his man but never the spirit them
[1:16:24] two Spirits are still warring with one
[1:16:27] another right on down now said you
[1:16:30] cannot go see now that's the exact same
[1:16:34] message Cain was trying to give to Abel

[1:16:39] because I can't get it so you can't have
[1:16:42] it
[1:16:43] you know whatever I can get that's the
[1:16:46] limits of what you can have well sorry
[1:16:49] but I'm not going to be limited by
[1:16:52] man-made theology I am free in the Holy
[1:16:55] Spirit to believe every word of God
[1:17:00] so he never takes his Spirit at any and
[1:17:03] now said no you cannot go
[1:17:07] well she said listen you know there's
[1:17:11] something down in my heart
[1:17:13] you know there's something about it see
[1:17:15] she's trying to explain it she can't she
[1:17:17] can't put a word on it she can't put her
[1:17:19] finger on it there's something down in
[1:17:21] my heart you know there's something
[1:17:22] about it when God gets a hold of a human
[1:17:24] heart they do funny things amen
[1:17:28] when God gets a hold of a human heart

[1:18:07] declaration and that's what the rest of
[1:18:10] them says and that's what we have to
[1:18:12] stand by now if there's anything like
[1:18:15] that going on it would be right here

[1:18:23] have I can see that little Queen God
[1:18:26] moving on her heart this is this is an
[1:18:28] incredible this is girl power starting
[1:18:30] to work right here I can see that little
[1:18:33] Queen got moving on her heart she
[1:18:36] squared herself off and said I want to
[1:18:39] tell you something brother random says
[1:18:40] we need more of them
[1:18:43] we need more of them
[1:18:45] brother Branham is not advocating
[1:18:47] women's Liberation and bossing their
[1:18:51] husbands around what God what the word
[1:18:53] of God is advocating what a prophet is
[1:18:55] advocating is a woman should just as
[1:18:58] much as a man who has just as much right
[1:19:00] to it stand on the word of God and say
[1:19:03] I'm a Christian and I'm a Believer and
[1:19:06] if I have to be a Believer by myself I'm
[1:19:08] going to be a believer
[1:19:12] that's girl power
[1:19:14] girl power isn't the kind that puts you
[1:19:17] out here with a cigarette in your mouth
[1:19:18] and and high-heeled shoes and
[1:19:20] tight-fitting clothes so that Hollywood
[1:19:22] and so that evil men can gawk and stare
[1:19:25] at you but there is a girl power and
[1:19:27] it's in the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:29] Christ
[1:19:30] and her powers and her character
[1:19:36] he said I can see that he says I can see
[1:19:39] that little Queen

[1:20:59] God that knows the secrets of the
[1:21:00] hardness poor girl had a lot on her
[1:21:02] heart

[1:22:02] morning I can lift Praises that he'll
[1:22:04] receive I'm like Abel at my at my rock
[1:22:07] and I'm offering him the Praises that he
[1:22:09] can receive
[1:22:12] that my life is a willing sacrifice
[1:22:16] to God in that way
[1:22:19] do you admire this queen today
[1:22:24] a second incredible woman
[1:22:29] seems anything but
[1:22:34] when we when we first meet Rahab
[1:22:38] in the Book of Joshua
[1:22:41] she's a woman
[1:22:44] rejected by society and
[1:22:48] forced into a very wretched existence by
[1:22:51] by hardship brother Branham
[1:22:54] and a paraphrase of a quote I don't have
[1:22:56] it in front of me
[1:22:58] brother Branham says perhaps she was
[1:23:01] forced into a life of harlotry
[1:23:04] by extreme poverty in her family
[1:23:10] can you imagine that friends uh
[1:23:13] a young innocent girl
[1:23:15] Lord help me to stay on target here
[1:23:19] forced to give up her Purity for money
[1:23:24] oh look
[1:23:25] cruelty of sin
[1:23:28] cruelty
[1:23:30] sin
[1:23:31] No Doubt like any young girl she had
[1:23:36] dreams and aspirations and
[1:23:39] to someday have a man that she loved and
[1:23:42] family to call her own and
[1:23:46] side effects and
[1:23:48] the terrible consequences
[1:23:51] that the curse of sin had brought upon
[1:23:53] this young girl
[1:23:55] say why why is it matter to you she's my
[1:23:58] sister
[1:23:59] she's my sister she's part of the family
[1:24:01] of God
[1:24:02] and I it breaks my heart that someday
[1:24:06] I'll meet her oh I'm gonna meet her I'm
[1:24:08] gonna hug her without any restraint I
[1:24:10] won't have to worry about a body that'll
[1:24:13] trap me up I can just Embrace and say
[1:24:15] rehab God bless you I love you I love
[1:24:17] your story it inspired me
[1:24:20] it was real girl power
[1:24:35] thank you
[1:25:35] and not death
[1:25:39] said the Cain why are you why are thou
[1:25:42] Roth
[1:25:43] why is that countenance falling you'll
[1:25:46] be accepted if you do right but if you
[1:25:49] refuse to do right hear the words of God
[1:25:52] to the to some of the first humans on
[1:25:54] Earth
[1:25:56] you'll be accepted if you do what is
[1:25:58] right but if you refuse to do what is
[1:26:00] right then watch out
[1:26:02] watch out
[1:26:04] sin is crouching at the door
[1:26:07] eager to control you
[1:26:10] but you must subdue him you must be his
[1:26:15] master
[1:26:20] poor Rahab
[1:26:24] what a crushy blow
[1:26:27] to the heart of a young girl
[1:26:31] leave
[1:26:32] but that life was a cruel joke
[1:26:37] and there's no way out of her misery
[1:26:40] trapped in it there's no way to break
[1:26:42] the chains of sin off of herself and
[1:26:45] wishing so wouldn't make it
[1:26:48] wishing wouldn't make it so
[1:26:50] she can wish all she wants you can wish
[1:26:52] all you want but wishing won't make it
[1:26:55] so but down in her heart she couldn't
[1:26:59] accept something wouldn't let her say
[1:27:01] this is all there is no something down
[1:27:04] inside of her heartburn
[1:27:06] and Rahab knew all she knew she had a
[1:27:10] she had secret thoughts in her heart
[1:27:12] that she had never said out loud and we
[1:27:14] wouldn't even know it if a prophet
[1:27:16] hadn't read between the lines for us
[1:27:19] if a prophet hadn't read between the
[1:27:21] lines I wouldn't know half the the story
[1:27:24] today that I'm telling you out of the
[1:27:26] Bible
[1:27:28] not something
[1:27:30] that's something that she couldn't quite
[1:27:32] identify that's something she couldn't
[1:27:35] quite put her finger on but it wasn't
[1:27:37] nothing
[1:27:38] it wasn't nothing there was something in
[1:27:41] her oh just like just like you know she
[1:27:43] felt it and and and and she had Brethren
[1:27:46] said she always thought you know it's
[1:27:48] not something she could say out loud but
[1:27:50] she always felt that if there was a real
[1:27:53] God
[1:27:55] he'd be a living God
[1:27:59] powerful and he'd be kind and he'd help
[1:28:02] me
[1:28:03] he would help me he would help me get
[1:28:06] out of this misery he'd help me change
[1:28:07] my life he'd help me become a new
[1:28:10] creation there was something down inside
[1:28:12] of her the same receiving scent was in
[1:28:14] her that is in me that is in you I know
[1:28:17] him to be a real God a living God who'll
[1:28:20] help me
[1:28:21] Hallelujah and when she heard the
[1:28:24] stories of the Israelites
[1:28:27] oh my how her heart her Young Heart must
[1:28:30] have left with hope could it be true
[1:28:32] could it be true
[1:28:34] could God really be that real
[1:28:37] could God really care about somebody
[1:28:40] like me
[1:28:43] maybe that's where you find yourself
[1:28:45] today friends
[1:28:46] maybe you're find yourself like Rahab
[1:28:49] and you find yourself trapped maybe you
[1:28:51] know you're a child of God but you're
[1:28:53] trapped nonetheless I'm here to tell you
[1:28:55] there's someone who can help you
[1:28:57] there's someone who's all-powerful or
[1:29:01] someone who can fix whatever's wrong
[1:29:03] there's someone who can give you the
[1:29:05] desire of your heart and make your
[1:29:07] dreams for eternal life and eternal joy
[1:29:09] and eternal happiness
[1:29:11] it's not somewhere over a rainbow it's
[1:29:14] right here in the word of God today
[1:29:20] it could not be it could not be it could
[1:29:24] not be
[1:29:25] her human Fallen nature that desired
[1:29:29] that
[1:29:30] there's no way because the Bible says
[1:29:32] the nature you're born with is enmity
[1:29:34] against God could never agree with God
[1:29:37] doesn't desire God at all her her life
[1:29:39] her life just like the Earth had been in
[1:29:41] chaos her life was in chaos but oh I'm
[1:29:44] so glad to know that just like the chaos
[1:29:47] of Eden when the spirit of God began to
[1:29:49] move on that chaos and it began to move
[1:29:52] on rehab it's beginning to move in your
[1:29:54] hearts today I trust it's moving in
[1:29:56] Hearts young and old alike here today to
[1:29:58] say I'll take all that chaos and I'll
[1:30:00] bring it all back around the correct way
[1:30:02] I I you know I she she's picking up a
[1:30:06] signal are you picking up a signal today
[1:30:08] a signal that maybe no one else can hear
[1:30:11] it maybe no one else can sense it but
[1:30:13] she could hear it she could sense it I
[1:30:15] hear it I sense it I love it
[1:30:18] I've heard it I've heard it have you
[1:30:21] heard it
[1:30:23] that same signal is speaking today
[1:30:29] Rahab
[1:30:31] was the lesser of these two ladies by
[1:30:34] far
[1:30:37] but she ends up really with a greater
[1:30:39] testimony
[1:30:41] as far as a testimony is concerned she
[1:30:42] becomes the last becomes first and the
[1:30:44] first becomes last
[1:30:47] because she came from an impossible
[1:30:49] situation
[1:30:50] as they say from the gutter most to the
[1:30:53] uttermost this this fur you know the
[1:30:56] whole if you read that in the Bible the
[1:30:58] first shall be last and the last shall
[1:31:01] be first actually
[1:31:03] it all starts because Jesus is you can
[1:31:05] go back and read it but he's telling a
[1:31:07] you know a story in the Bible about the
[1:31:10] Rich Young Ruler that we have portrayed
[1:31:12] here considering the word of God
[1:31:16] Jesus had just finished telling about
[1:31:18] this this story was a true story and a
[1:31:22] rich man a rich young man came forward
[1:31:24] Master what must I do to inherit eternal
[1:31:28] life and so Jesus you know the story I
[1:31:31] don't need to repeat all that today I'm
[1:31:32] trying to save some time
[1:31:34] but after that you know and and Jesus
[1:31:37] said how hardly shall a rich man enter
[1:31:38] in and and we find that that was the
[1:31:41] backdrop because now this is exactly
[1:31:44] what the the you know the disciples
[1:31:46] Peter comes to him and says
[1:31:48] Lord
[1:31:49] we have
[1:31:52] surrendered everything
[1:31:53] because they just heard him say it's
[1:31:55] hard for a rich man he he can hardly get
[1:31:57] in and all seems impossible but With God
[1:31:59] all things are possible and Peter comes
[1:32:01] with that great question Lord what what
[1:32:02] about us
[1:32:04] uh you know we we have left everything
[1:32:07] to follow you what will there be for us
[1:32:10] and of course that rich young man that
[1:32:13] was his problem
[1:32:15] he he wouldn't leave his possessions
[1:32:19] he couldn't give up his life and that's
[1:32:21] what Jesus was calling for
[1:32:23] Jesus didn't didn't wasn't necessarily
[1:32:27] calling him to go live in poverty
[1:32:29] because rich men generally when they go
[1:32:32] broke they get rich again they just have
[1:32:33] a knack for doing it and Jesus is just
[1:32:36] the problem is not the money the
[1:32:38] problem's in his heart
[1:32:39] you understand that his heart he's got a
[1:32:42] heart problem
[1:32:44] and he won't let the heart the greatest
[1:32:46] heart surgeon in the world fix it see
[1:32:49] and so they're saying Lord you know we
[1:32:51] we have we have forsaken everything and
[1:32:53] and and he wouldn't forsake his
[1:32:56] possessions but we we have forsaken ours
[1:32:58] we have forsaken all and the Lord From
[1:33:00] There goes into a very lengthy
[1:33:02] explanation about how there would there
[1:33:05] would actually be a complete uh renewal
[1:33:08] the Greek word means a rebirth and the
[1:33:11] ages to come don't worry that there's
[1:33:14] going to be a rebirth in the ages to
[1:33:17] come and and though the nation of Israel
[1:33:20] was at that time rejecting
[1:33:23] um his offer of the Kingdom the kingdom
[1:33:25] would still come
[1:33:27] it wasn't going to stop it Israel would
[1:33:29] be restored and they would be
[1:33:31] re-established as the leading Kingdom of
[1:33:33] Earth uh with Jerusalem literally being
[1:33:35] the capital city of the great king the
[1:33:37] king of kings so that was a coming in
[1:33:39] future ages and so the when you when you
[1:33:42] go on to understand it it's going to be
[1:33:46] a complete a complete remaking of all
[1:33:50] things
[1:33:51] that's what you're headed for friends
[1:33:53] that's what we're Believers for it's a
[1:33:56] and in fact is I'm not going to take the
[1:33:58] time to go into Isaiah 4 and Isaiah 5
[1:34:01] and 11 and 10 and 32 and 35 what I and
[1:34:05] and Matthew 25 revelation 22 there's all
[1:34:08] kinds of places I could go today I'm
[1:34:10] going to save some time but we find out
[1:34:12] that it's a it's a remaking of all
[1:34:15] things that are spiritual all things
[1:34:17] that are all things political all things
[1:34:19] geographical all things physical and
[1:34:22] then when that's restored Christ will
[1:34:23] sit on the throne over it all you got
[1:34:25] that
[1:34:27] brother Branham and brother branham's
[1:34:29] language he would say it like this and I
[1:34:31] love his language the best he said over
[1:34:33] there all wrongs will be made right
[1:34:38] I take tremendous comfort in that
[1:34:43] so many times more times
[1:34:46] perhaps not a great amount of times but
[1:34:49] more times than I would want because one
[1:34:52] time is one time too many but numerous
[1:34:54] times
[1:34:56] I've sat in my office
[1:34:58] in this one or at my home or overseas
[1:35:03] abroad or at another church somewhere
[1:35:06] here counseling talking to people
[1:35:10] and their life has been so upended
[1:35:14] because they made the wrong choices
[1:35:17] and they went the wrong way and they
[1:35:19] went against the word of God and though
[1:35:21] the word of God pleaded with them not to
[1:35:23] it preachers pleaded with them and
[1:35:25] parents pleaded with them and People
[1:35:27] Prayed for them but they were they were
[1:35:29] caught under the magic spell of Satan
[1:35:31] and they went the way of the world and
[1:35:34] now they're sitting across from me
[1:35:35] weeping real tears because the agony of
[1:35:39] their life and what they're having to
[1:35:40] deal with in their life now and it's
[1:35:42] broken and busted and ruined and
[1:35:44] contaminated and sometimes sometimes we
[1:35:47] can as a minister of the Gospel we can
[1:35:50] find the way out I can say take hope
[1:35:52] friends because all you have to do you
[1:35:55] that's not you're not too late we can
[1:35:56] get that fixed it's going to take a
[1:35:58] little time it's going to take some work
[1:35:59] and you're gonna have to be diligent and
[1:36:01] the medicine might be a little bitter
[1:36:02] and it's going to have some side effects
[1:36:03] but we can get it fixed calm down let's
[1:36:06] hope in Christ
[1:36:07] but
[1:36:10] there's too many time more times than
[1:36:12] I'm ever comfortable with
[1:36:14] when really the only thing I can say to
[1:36:16] them because it's so broken
[1:36:19] and it's so ruined and it's so
[1:36:21] contaminated
[1:36:23] the only thing I can say and thank God I
[1:36:26] have it thank God I have it I can say
[1:36:28] well
[1:36:29] sister dear brother dear
[1:36:32] married couple elderly teenager
[1:36:36] say somebody can be ruined that early
[1:36:38] you better believe it
[1:36:40] and I've had that comfort that one
[1:36:42] Comfort it's just a one line and I can
[1:36:45] say well a prophet said all wrongs will
[1:36:49] be made right over there and I wish I
[1:36:53] had more of an answer normally there's
[1:36:55] more of an answer but you have went
[1:36:58] against God's word for so long in so
[1:37:01] many different ways but but let me give
[1:37:04] you this little trinket of Hope all
[1:37:06] wrongs will be made right
[1:37:08] serve God live humble carry on God will
[1:37:12] take care of you he'll help you you're
[1:37:14] not Beyond Redemption thank God you're
[1:37:16] not Beyond hope as long as Christ sits
[1:37:18] on the throne you're not Beyond hope
[1:37:20] there's always hope as long as Jesus is
[1:37:23] on the throne
[1:37:26] all wrongs will be made right over there
[1:37:29] the disciples were promised
[1:37:32] that they would have a very special
[1:37:34] place in the Kingdom that would actually
[1:37:36] sit on 12 Thrones judging the tribes of
[1:37:39] Israel in fact he said all who leave
[1:37:41] their homes and even if you have to
[1:37:44] forsake relatives and loved ones and and
[1:37:46] all and and forsake everything for the
[1:37:50] Lord's sake you know it's it's just like
[1:37:52] the marriage vow and how many times I've
[1:37:55] stood and said to a man and said to a
[1:37:58] woman and repeat after me and forsaking
[1:38:01] all others cleave to thee only
[1:38:04] all the days of my life
[1:38:06] and that's really what it comes down to
[1:38:08] when you come to Christ you're saying I
[1:38:10] will forsake I forsake all others and I
[1:38:13] will cleave only to you Lord Jesus for
[1:38:16] as long as we both shall live and thank
[1:38:18] God that's a very long time
[1:38:22] and and so Jesus assures them that that
[1:38:26] if they forsake everything for his
[1:38:28] kingdom that they would
[1:38:30] receive blessings on the other side that
[1:38:33] will more than compensate for any losses
[1:38:36] and that's on that's on top of their
[1:38:39] eternal life
[1:38:40] that's that's stacked on top not just
[1:38:43] eternal life
[1:38:44] but blessings that will more than comp
[1:38:47] compensate for whatever you've
[1:38:49] surrendered here and why while it while
[1:38:51] it might appear you know a lot of times
[1:38:54] while it might appear that the family of
[1:38:56] God is giving up everything everything
[1:38:58] now and we always seem to be saying well
[1:39:00] I I'm always in last place I'm always
[1:39:03] you know this Christianity but but I'm
[1:39:05] here to tell you in eternity you'll be
[1:39:07] first
[1:39:08] don't let the devil the Bible says don't
[1:39:10] be weary and well doing don't let the
[1:39:13] devil discourage you with life because
[1:39:15] this life ain't all there is I can tell
[1:39:18] you like the queen of the South and like
[1:39:20] Rahab there's more there's more to be
[1:39:23] had and this ain't all there is thank
[1:39:26] God world coming friends and God is
[1:39:29] rebuilding Eden but he's got to rebuild
[1:39:31] you first
[1:39:33] he's got he's got the second Adam
[1:39:36] rebuilt now he's rebuilding the second
[1:39:37] Eve see and so this this this principle
[1:39:41] I wanna I wanna come to this point
[1:39:43] before I close
[1:39:45] just want to make this last Point you're
[1:39:47] good
[1:39:48] so
[1:39:50] this principle
[1:39:52] runs all through the Bible it the first
[1:39:55] shall be last and last shall be first
[1:39:57] that didn't suddenly become true when
[1:39:59] Jesus said it Jesus was simply stating
[1:40:02] what had been a principle since Genesis
[1:40:04] and you find that you see it in Rahab I
[1:40:07] mean if you ever want a case of the last
[1:40:09] thing first go to rehab
[1:40:11] and so so you find that that Rahab we
[1:40:15] can see it working perfectly she's a
[1:40:17] perfect example of the Christ line
[1:40:20] remember I told you about the Christ
[1:40:22] line and the genealogies she's a perfect
[1:40:25] example of that Christ line scattered
[1:40:28] throughout Humanity
[1:40:30] that came from the fall
[1:40:33] in Genesis and when the sons of God saw
[1:40:37] the daughters of men and took unto them
[1:40:39] wives and brother Branham says that was
[1:40:41] the sons of Seth
[1:40:42] who married the daughters of Cain
[1:40:45] and and it intermingled the the the the
[1:40:48] gene pool of God's family from Adam with
[1:40:52] the gene pool from The Serpent and and
[1:40:54] therefore they're there for you you can
[1:40:57] see it it makes it survives the flood it
[1:41:00] comes out on the other side of the flood
[1:41:01] it's still going strong you still have
[1:41:03] those two Vines
[1:41:05] still have the Christ line and the
[1:41:06] Antichrist line you got me so so so so
[1:41:09] you find that that you've got this this
[1:41:13] this this this Christ line that goes
[1:41:15] through of which Rahab is now a perfect
[1:41:18] example of the Christ line that's been
[1:41:21] scattered through all the populations
[1:41:22] because she's not part of Israel she's a
[1:41:25] gentile of Jericho see it's not a Jew at
[1:41:28] all but yet she's a Christ line
[1:41:30] she's in she actually is going to end up
[1:41:33] marrying General an Israeli Army General
[1:41:36] by the name of salmon and then they're
[1:41:39] going to have a son and a son and a son
[1:41:41] and a son and finally you're going to
[1:41:43] get you're going to get Ruth and Boaz
[1:41:45] and you're going to keep going and
[1:41:46] you're going to get Jesse and you're
[1:41:47] going to get David you're going to get
[1:41:49] Jesus
[1:41:50] so God what was God doing he was taking
[1:41:53] the chaos of her sin birth and he was
[1:41:57] putting her back in the line of his word
[1:42:00] and that's exactly what has happened to
[1:42:03] you and to me we were in every nation
[1:42:06] and every culture and every race and
[1:42:08] every Creed and every organized thing
[1:42:11] and maybe your church was a bar room or
[1:42:13] maybe it was a Crystal Cathedral but we
[1:42:15] were lost and undone without God or his
[1:42:19] son when he reached way down for me
[1:42:23] and he brings you are you up out of
[1:42:26] chaos God finds a way to redeem he did
[1:42:30] it all down through history we see the
[1:42:32] same God doing the same thing today we
[1:42:35] see it in Genesis we see it in Rahab in
[1:42:37] the Book of Joshua there there truly is
[1:42:39] Friends listen now there truly is
[1:42:43] brother random called it a continuation
[1:42:46] of the book of Acts
[1:42:49] right
[1:42:50] so you say
[1:42:53] well what's the primary brother Jason
[1:42:56] Give me the give me the the primary
[1:42:58] purpose
[1:42:59] of a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:43:01] well it's varied okay but I just want
[1:43:03] the primary one I get that it might have
[1:43:05] all kinds of other things well it does
[1:43:07] it it has signs and wonders and gifts
[1:43:09] and to the church and miracles and power
[1:43:11] and things like that but you say but
[1:43:13] what was the primary what's the primary
[1:43:15] when brother Branham says what's the
[1:43:17] primary purpose when brother Branham
[1:43:19] says that we're writing another book of
[1:43:21] Acts behind it that you're you're this
[1:43:24] church under this message is a
[1:43:27] continuation of the book of Acts what
[1:43:29] does that really mean well in order to
[1:43:31] know what that really means in a
[1:43:33] restoration we've got to go back to what
[1:43:36] it was when it first came
[1:43:38] and I can tell you when it first came it
[1:43:41] was it it it was not it was not uh I
[1:43:45] don't want to be careful how I say this
[1:43:47] it was not primarily the introduction of
[1:43:51] signs and wonders and Gifts in operation
[1:43:54] you know nor this might shock you but it
[1:43:58] wasn't even primarily to correct
[1:44:00] erroneous doctrines
[1:44:03] that's not what it's for today it does
[1:44:05] do that
[1:44:07] it does restore signs and wonders and
[1:44:09] power it does correct erroneous teaching
[1:44:12] but that's never been the primary
[1:44:15] purpose of the Jubilee see while these
[1:44:19] things are all tangible parts of it
[1:44:21] they're not the primary purpose when we
[1:44:24] say a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:44:27] the main function of the continuation of
[1:44:30] the book of Acts is finding and
[1:44:33] redeeming Adam's lost family
[1:44:37] that's that's the that's why the book of
[1:44:40] Acts was a continuation of the Gospel
[1:44:43] what was Jesus doing coming to entertain
[1:44:46] him with signs and wonders and miracles
[1:44:48] and feed them no it wasn't running a
[1:44:50] social program he was looking for the
[1:44:52] children of God he was looking for his
[1:44:55] family Jesus came to save his own I'm
[1:44:59] here to tell you today we have a
[1:45:00] continuation of the book of Acts but
[1:45:02] it's not just to bring signs and wonders
[1:45:05] and miracles though it does those things
[1:45:06] it's not just to give us correct
[1:45:08] Doctrine which it does that but it's to
[1:45:11] take the chaos that you were born in and
[1:45:13] speak to a seed and bring a life and
[1:45:16] restore you back into the line of Christ
[1:45:19] to bring your life back to the line and
[1:45:23] the Order of God's word that's the
[1:45:25] primary thing that's being described in
[1:45:28] a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:45:32] because when that happens
[1:45:36] it doesn't matter where you've been
[1:45:41] doesn't matter what you've done
[1:45:45] or what condition
[1:45:47] he finds you in
[1:45:49] when he finds you
[1:45:52] he's going to save you
[1:45:54] he's going to redeem you
[1:45:56] and he's going to restore everything
[1:46:04] is restored back to this bride
[1:46:07] that sin took from her
[1:46:10] everything friends that's the beauty of
[1:46:13] the message of restoration it restores
[1:46:16] everything Jesus even talks about that
[1:46:18] in the gospels that he didn't he didn't
[1:46:21] just come to restore people he came to
[1:46:24] restore everything everything that you
[1:46:26] were ever supposed to be
[1:46:28] that Satan has taken from you I'm here
[1:46:31] to tell you there's a message today that
[1:46:34] gives it back to you it puts it right
[1:46:36] back in your life no matter what
[1:46:38] condition no matter what position I mean
[1:46:41] if if you think about it
[1:46:44] when
[1:46:46] when God was going to send out the
[1:46:50] gospel
[1:46:52] what did you have you had it's like
[1:46:54] concentric Rings it started in Jerusalem
[1:46:56] and it you ever throw up a pebble into
[1:46:59] the middle of a pond and you see the
[1:47:01] concentric Rings just start going out
[1:47:03] like that and they go out in all
[1:47:04] directions
[1:47:05] it was going to start in Jerusalem it
[1:47:07] was going to go to Judea I was going to
[1:47:08] go to Samaria it's going to keep on
[1:47:09] going to the uttermost part of the earth
[1:47:11] it wouldn't matter how you see it
[1:47:14] wouldn't matter how how messed up you
[1:47:17] were or how messed up your life is you
[1:47:19] say oh brother Jason what is it what is
[1:47:23] it going to do to me when it when that
[1:47:25] when that Ripple reaches you say what is
[1:47:27] the message of the hour whatever we keep
[1:47:30] calling it a message of the hour because
[1:47:32] what he said was it's going to go
[1:47:34] Jerusalem Judea so Mary the uttermost
[1:47:36] part of the Earth right now that's
[1:47:38] that's geographically all right look at
[1:47:40] the spiritual side at first it just
[1:47:42] started preaching to Jews
[1:47:44] and you know what happened in the at the
[1:47:46] when they came out of the upper room
[1:47:48] they juice from all over the world who
[1:47:50] have been scattered all over the world
[1:47:51] but they were Jews heard every man in
[1:47:54] their own language so the first thing it
[1:47:56] did was at Jerusalem it reads started
[1:47:59] regathering just Jews from All Nations
[1:48:01] but then what do you find happening in
[1:48:04] the book of Acts then you find every
[1:48:05] once in a while you see suddenly you're
[1:48:07] getting people like Titus and Timothy
[1:48:09] who are half Jew half Gentile what's it
[1:48:12] doing it's spreading out and then
[1:48:14] finally it goes to the house of
[1:48:16] Cornelius and now it's all Gentiles not
[1:48:17] just half Gentiles all Gentiles and then
[1:48:20] finally it keeps on going and keeps on
[1:48:22] going till it's only to Gentiles and
[1:48:25] Israel is put aside and she's got to
[1:48:27] wait for a restoration when the bride is
[1:48:29] gone and now all it reached to all of
[1:48:32] his Gentile family who were intermingled
[1:48:35] around the world born in sin it covered
[1:48:38] two thousand years it covered seven
[1:48:40] Church ages and you say brother Jason
[1:48:42] what is the message of the hour the
[1:48:45] message of the hour is that ripple
[1:48:47] effect is now here it's now reached you
[1:48:50] it's reached me God has sent it to us
[1:48:53] and we we have a wonderful message
[1:48:57] and this is what it's done it's here now
[1:48:59] when it can't go there are no more ages
[1:49:04] there's no more once you go beyond the
[1:49:06] west coast of of the United States
[1:49:08] you're heading back East again there's
[1:49:10] no Jesus described it as the lightning
[1:49:13] coming out of the East traveling to the
[1:49:16] West so shall it be in the day when the
[1:49:18] son of man is revealed and we're here
[1:49:20] and it's now and the wave has reached me

[2:04:05] our heads across the building
[2:04:08] father we thank you very kindly for this
[2:04:11] wonderful privilege Lord how many times
[2:04:14] over the years Lord different places and
[2:04:18] that we've put people beneath the water
[2:04:20] like you were put under the in the
[2:04:23] ground Lord and then you Rose up father
[2:04:26] that's why we lay people under and then
[2:04:28] we bring them right back up because you
[2:04:31] weren't there hardly no time at all Lord
[2:04:33] you Rose back up and you'll never have
[2:04:35] to go brother Lamar will never need to
[2:04:37] do this again Lord this is this is an
[2:04:39] act of obedience that is one and done
[2:04:42] and Lord it will stay on the annals of
[2:04:45] of Heaven it'll stay in the records
[2:04:47] department of Heaven forever that on
[2:04:50] this day this brother came in in front
[2:04:53] of an audience of people publicly Lord
[2:04:55] to declare his allegiance to you the
[2:04:58] great king father we we trust in you
[2:05:02] Lord to fill him from head to toe Lord
[2:05:04] we already can see of course that the
[2:05:06] Holy Ghost has already begun a work in
[2:05:08] his life but Lord the brother has
[2:05:10] expressed to me expressed the desire
[2:05:12] that so many of us have the desire that
[2:05:15] Paul said Lord even the people who had
[2:05:17] already been born again who had already
[2:05:19] even been baptized and Paul said now I
[2:05:22] want you to be filled with all the
[2:05:24] fullness of God Lord that is a a daily
[2:05:29] a daily life quest of us all I pray that
[2:05:33] you are granted to my brother may he
[2:05:34] never again that the enemy could ever
[2:05:37] make him doubt he's he's putting his
[2:05:39] stake down right here and he's now got
[2:05:41] an identifiable time on a calendar Lord
[2:05:44] that he took your name in public the
[2:05:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ now may
[2:05:49] you grant your blessing to him Lord
[2:05:51] we've grown to love him so quickly the
[2:05:54] whole church father commit this into
[2:05:56] your hands now in Jesus name
[2:05:58] Amen brother you just sit down on that
[2:05:59] bench right there now brother Lamar
[2:06:01] you're not you're no already
[2:06:03] that there's no other name under Heaven
[2:06:06] given among men whereby we must be saved
[2:06:09] other than the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:11] Christ that's why you take his name in
[2:06:12] baptism see
[2:06:14] so someday the Lord will bless you with
[2:06:16] the wife and she'll take your name just
[2:06:18] like you're taking the name of Christ
[2:06:20] you see that so
[2:06:22] we can see very clearly I sent the uh I
[2:06:25] sent the young people
[2:06:27] um
[2:06:28] in the chat a whole new PDF did you see
[2:06:32] that get posted I it I'll make sure you
[2:06:34] get that and it was it's young people
[2:06:37] that want to witness and it gives you a
[2:06:39] bullet list of all the scriptures and
[2:06:41] all the historical references and all
[2:06:43] the encyclopedias of authority
[2:06:45] authoritatively telling authoritatively
[2:06:48] proving and and probably more than a
[2:06:50] half a dozen encyclopedias and scripture
[2:06:52] verses that anyone who was ever baptized
[2:06:56] in the early church was baptized in the
[2:06:58] name of the Lord and at no time were
[2:07:01] they ever baptized using titles for
[2:07:03] about 300 years that's the first Trace
[2:07:06] they can even find of even anyone even
[2:07:08] suggesting that they do it otherwise
[2:07:11] than according to Acts chapter 2. that's
[2:07:14] a bona fide historical fact and the
[2:07:16] encyclopedias in the scripture proves it
[2:07:18] so you young people you've got some
[2:07:20] you've got some you've got some tools
