TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and uh then we will let you be seated Revelation 3:14 amen I love the Bible don't you and unto the angel of the Church of the leody Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God that's some pretty good creds I mean you're not going to get better credentialing than that he is the amen he's the faithful and true witness and he can prove it and he's proved it for all these centuries he's proved it the beginning of the creation of God my he certainly proved that verse 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou word cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked the perception that this age has of itself and the reality that God sees of it are quite different they're very much uh Polar Opposites the age feels this is this is our age the seventh age and the anointing that is on the age and that is affecting the minds of mankind is I I I have need of nothing I have everything I need I'm rich increased with Goods I have need of nothing but God is God's assessment is you've got it all wrong the actual condition of you is that you're wretched and you're miserable and you're poor and you're blind and naked and because of the blindness of man's mind today and there's a number of corroborating scriptures we could use I don't want to get too sidetracked today but we do know uh as students of the scripture that the Bible prophesied very accurately that one of the signs in the last day would be mankind would lose the ability to discern between to discern accurately between right and wrong so that his whole perception would go inside out or upside down um and uh he would he would actually believe that everything that we have believed is wrong and that everything we believed was wrong he now calls it right and it's a complete reversal there have been so many things happened in this last age and uh we were talking about it the other night in some fellowship so with some of the ministry here that you know I I would love to be able I've been trying to brainstorm for months how to make a diagram to Encompass that and just just show you all of the unique very unique and unprecedented realities that this age of humanity is facing today that they've never faced before and that that explains the madness that we see amen even even things contrary to Nature itself and Mankind is just complet completely lost his way all right and and here here here's why he doesn't believe that he's insane and there's a good reason for it he doesn't believe he's insane because governments are still functioning society's still moving technology is still rolling science and education are still progressing so he he says to us you know he says to God in his word how do you say that this age is a neurotic and insane when all of the stuff is still functioning and everything's still going and we're actually making human progress and in those Realms the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it does continue to uh progress but what he's blind to is that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that the more knowledge he gains the more death is associated with it and he's destroying himself and he's blind to that he's unaware all right you would be blind also you're no different Paul said you had your conversation and the lust of the flesh the things of the world you were also by your very nature that you were born with uh a fallen nature you were also the children of Wrath even as everybody else see but God who was rich and mercy loved me while I was a sinner called to me and I responded have you responded today and because of that response that I believed his word then he has healed my mind and has opened my eyes and I see the world for what it really is amen and I see the word and I see my position in the word and these things cannot be overemphasized and you will do well to think about them all right let's um pray I want to take up this prayer request um sister Chassidy wrote a prayer today that uh She's suffering a lot of pain in her body and the devil fights our sister she had a really good doctor's report uh a few days ago and the devil's pretty upset over that so he's trying to afflict her brother Doug is also asking prayer for his father in the hospital with shortness of breath pain in his lower back and kidney area they discovered he is four units low my on blood and are trying to find where he's bleeding internally um amen praise the Lord [Music] um brother Aaron will you go on my desk there's um a card laying on a plastic bag with with some bedding clothes like sheets and stuff bring that to me straight away sister Linda Paris was watching uh last week when we prayed over the pillowcases for the lady suffering with brain cancer and uh she felt inspired um she said my goodness you know sister uh the devil also thinks her battles her with terrible uh bodily pain and especially uh in her senior years it's gotten worse and so she she felt inspired in her faith to send this and she says please pray for the complete healing of my body head to toe amen she's got a lot of uh there's pain and there's various other conditions that sometimes the old age can bring upon but it's just the devil regardless amen she says a complete healing of my body believing with the saints that the righteous prayers of the Saints availeth much God bless you all sister Linda Paris so she said I I'm going to send you sheets pillowcases everything she said I want you to pray over it and she says and and and I'm going to sleep on them amen praise the Lord now that might sound strange to the world but as brother bradam said I'll assure you it is scriptural they took aprons and garments from the body of St Paul and that when they were laid on people in the Bible people were healed miraculously we have seen it many many many many many many many times over the years countless times now normally uh we we don't we don't go to this extreme we have a prayer cloth and that and the prayer cloth is all you need but I'm doing this because this is where her faith felt inspired and uh because she's a a part of our assembly here I I I agreed to kind of uh go out of the norm and uh we're going to we're going to I'm going to preach with it here and then we're going to pray over it again and uh so if anyone out there in the listening audience if you'd like a prayer cloth if you're here today you'd like to take one it's just a small cloth you can you know you can um I I've seen teenagers who were in the world and a mother secretly had a prayer cloth prayed over and put it under their mattress and and within no time they were full of the Holy Ghost and we've seen people with and we've known of people with cancer and incurable diseases and in wheelchairs and get that in the mail pin it and say now Satan you got no right to hold me anymore and step up out of that wheelchair on the spot in front of many witnesses so it is certainly uh scriptural to do that and we've seen it over the years many many many times amen it's just something as a contact to help our faith and U even the shadow of Simon Peter uhu moving over sick people and they lame and the sick stood up healed we've seen that happen as well I've personally witnessed those kinds of things in my Ministry around the world Amen so amen let's let's pray right now Master we thank you for your word that's been read today thank you for your sure mercies Lord and your anointing that we feel and I pray that you'll be with us one and all Lord as we look into the words of Life be with me Lord as a speaker be with the audience as hearing Lord we commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name name amen God bless you you can be seated and trusting the Lord for those prayer requests that we named out to you don't be for don't forget those amen from Sister Chassidy from Brother Doug from Sister Linda and then our families who are away traveling God bless you and God bless them now um really Richard praise the Lord hallelujah thank you brother Kenny God bless you amen wow praise the Lord wow happy to have Brother Rich we were in the uh men's bible study breakfast yesterday and a knock came on the door and we opened it up and to our Delight there stood Brother Richard In the Flesh come in gave everybody a hug amen wrapped his arms around me and started praying for me the blessing of God upon me it worked rich I feel it today amen the blessing of the Lord now I want you to just uh uh give me your undivided attention for a little while and we're going to take some more of our thought on in the presence of the Sun and and I just want to make a few opening statements now I I would like very quickly just for the recording sake because it's on archive and somebody will hear last week I want to make one quick correction that I misspoke on uh on on a reference to brother bram's message the anointed ones at the end time the false anointed ones actually at the end time and I made a reference to Pentecost uh being you know and and we were just talking about the the height and breadth of what Pentecost was and it being a jubilee that it includes signs and wonders and the restoration of the gifts and it's all of those things but we we found that uh in my heart I I I think it's good to let us understand God bless you brother happy to have you here as well it good for us to understand that that when we say we we want the to go back to Pentecost too often times I find uh and it's partly why I'm on this series at such length too often times I find that when people refer to we want to go back to Pentecost now of course we're not talking about the denomination we're talking about the original Jubilee the original uh mighty God being unveiled there in the alpha Church and when we when we reference that a lot of times people are merely speaking of because it's all they think to speak of is you know the gifts of the Spirit and and all of the various you know the gifts of knowledge and the gifts of tongues and interpretation and and there's Gifts of healing and Gifts of wisdom and all these kind of different things and then there's several three four five references to in the book of Acts which is where we always go there's references to um Power and demonstration signs and wonders but I I and so I have been trying to broaden our understanding that the restoration of Pentecost which is what we have which is what we were promised is all of that uh and more and it's not just limited to the book of Acts it's everything that we read in the gospels that was Paul's message and John and his Epistles and Peter and James and all of these various ones that wrote in the New Testament that's all part of the great mystery that was revealed R to us under the seventh opening of the seventh seal and in the book of Acts you have the indictment and in the book of Acts you have false anointed ones at the end time uh in the in the in the in the the Epistles you you have teaching on families and teaching on marriage and teaching on finances and teaching on children raising kids and that's all part of the seventh seal that's all a part of it see and but I made a reference to that particular verse in verse 20 Acts chapter 20 how that Grievious wolves would come in and and I said that's the scripture brother brandham used in anointed ones at the end time when I went back and reviewed my notes I realized that it's not I I think I said uh and I have a good friend who sends me the transcripts especially in these series uh so I can keep up with what I've said and not cover things and and and eliminate duplicity but but as I was looking back over his transcript to try to get a a a fix on where I ended last time that's better than having to go back and listen to my own preaching I'd much rather read the transcript so thank you brother Mark Coffey for your labors of that amen but but I realized as I was looking I said oh no I think I refer I said it's actually in the sermon he preached anointed ones at the end time and that's not accurate where brother brandham made that inference was in the church age book in the Ephesian Church age uh where he calls them false prophets false Shepherds uh false Apostles actually I think the quote is false Apostles and false prophets and then in the and at the end of the book that's at the beginning of the cab and at the end in the resume when he go when he's covering that again in brief then he he go it then it goes from false Apostles and false prophets and false anointed ones and he's referencing Acts chapter 20 I just want to make that correction for in case you go looking in the message and you can't find it in that particular message anointed ones at the end time it's in the in the church AG book Ephesian age and um and in again in the resume all right enough said on that now so I I want to make some statements and I'm I'm just going down over things that brother Bram talks about and recognizing your day and its message Amen Let me find my little device here and we'll bring it up so we're continuing in the presence of the son and I wish to take for my subtitle today recognizing your hour in Prophecy cuz I will assure you that you are standing in Prophecy unfolding and there's nothing there's no events in the world that aren't covered in Prophecy I have I have offered that many times to people if they want a clear understanding and uh it doesn't matter which which subject you want to talk about we can we can go to politics we can go to education Science and Technology we can go to uh military conquest we can go to so the the the social issues of the present the past uh as far back and and every The ecumenical move religious moves Christianity other religions uh leading all the way back to the ancient times of the Ancients back even before the Anatolian destruction and there's not any any era or any event you can point to that I can't demonstrate to you that the Bible covered that predicted that explained that and told what its significance and its meanings were and and and when you can take a book written by that many different men over that many different years and it all puts together like that and you overlay all the history of it and it all fits and dovetails perfectly I'm telling you that takes more than a man that takes a mind of God to do that and that's why the Bible says holy men of old wrote as they were inspired of God so these things are clear and uh and and we have no problem and I and I'm always happy to do it because I love teaching out of the scripture and I love especially love particularly love correlating history and overlay overlaying the history all the way back to the ancient world and so it's a it's a discussion I I love to have so don't ever think you're you're imposing upon me if you want to have that so we find that that concerning our day that the Bible predicted this day very accurately and and in one and in and in one of the ways one of the many ways that we want to talk about is that it would be a day that it would come at the end time that it would be a day where you couldn't exactly call it day or night but it would be something unique to the world that they hadn't seen before that it would be kind of a dismal look it would be kind of an in between place and that and and now you're starting to move into the modern era that we live in and it began to unfold early in the 20th century and this is why we have so many unprecedented things because mankind was you know groping in a and you say well he's he's been groping in darkness but this this is almost in some respects it's almost a worse condition because you know you know as you as you as you well let's just take something very naturally when you're driving next time when you're driving and you know if it's completely dark and you've got really good headlights then you can see you don't have a problem you can see everything your lights are striking if it's bright day then you don't even need your lights and you can see everything very clear but it's in that in between Twilight where it's just starting to be enough and you might even turn your headlights on it's not exactly dark and it's not bright day and the lights aren't really effective it's in that little in between area and you're actually have to pay close attention and things will surprise you because there's where the human brain is trying to process day to night day to night and it's in that in between dismal time and a lot of accidents in the evening and in the morning during that time where it's not exactly day and it's not exactly night so you're not in night vision mode you're not in day Vision mode and your brain is trying to make that switch and and and that's and that's certainly supported uh in in science and you you know that as you drive you've experienced that I've experienced that I was thinking about it just recently driving and and it was starting the sun was gone down and it was getting that that little where and I thought wow there's that scripture exactly you know and so so we find that it would be a time at the end time where society would have to deal with that globally and to where it's a a confusing time they can't see exactly clearly and it's not Stark dark enough to where the lights are actually doing any good and it's in that that gray time that dismal time where man can see kind of but he can't see real clear and this is where leoa would arrive at we can see governments working we can see Society we can see technology we can see all of these things but but then when we start looking at the craziness of the world it's like why what's going on why is that happening and everybody's got that question my what's happening to the world you know it I know it we see it it's in the news what's happening to the world and people the Bible talks about how that men's Hearts would fail for fear now when we when we think about we've been talking about the ripening of the seed of God that comes within us and that the word be ripened inside your heart and you know it's one thing to have the gene of God it's another thing to be in maturity it's another thing to have that seed when it's dormant you're not born again then suddenly you are born again and that seed has come to life but then even beyond that there's a growth and a maturing and there's where you're adding to this and adding to that and adding to this and adding to that and Paul is saying to people with who are already full of the Holy Spirit saying I want you to come into all the fullness see and so we realize that that this is not uncommon even in nature we find that that were it not for the sunlight you could never have you know in the larger sense of of how it affects the atmosphere you could never have life could not be supported and and Seed would fruit would never come to ripening and your fruit of the spirit will never come to ripening unless you spend time laying in the presence of the so n light see and you know and we're not talking about uh photons because I mean you know you you women know you can take an unright piece of fruit put it on paper bag and lay it in a lay it somewhere dark and it'll ripen and there's certainly no sunlight hitting it but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about how that if if the Earth would lose its sunlight the Earth would become a a frozen in uh unhospitable uninhabitable Wasteland it has to have the sun to warm the atmosphere and to create and your seed has to has to be in the atmospheres of the son of God see the right atmosphere will bring forth life as as old brother Bosworth used to say he would say it to brother Brandon and say brother brandom you know you can you can take a fertilized egg and put it under a puppy and it'll hatch because it wasn't the puppy that brought it it's not the hen that causes it it's the atmosphere that gets created around it whether it's a puppy laying on it or a hen laying on it it that atmosphere will bring that chick out of that egg that fertilized egg so you know this is why church is important this is why your prayer life is important this is why the token should be in your home this is why you should speak to God in spiritual songs and hymns and have a song on your lips and a and a a a song A Psalm on your heart and a song on your lips because you're you're creators you create an atmosphere around you if you're all flustered and you know it as well as I know it and and things are just hectic and when it rains it P and you know and and you're just you just feel like running from your own self I'm going to tell you if you can just quiet yourself and get alone with God and just begin to sing a little Melody and and it maybe at first you don't feel like it but if you just keep pressing through and suddenly the Lord will start inhabiting that praise and the atmosphere around you will start changing and it'll physically change other things I've come into situations I've experienced what brother Brenham experienced have a family upset have a wife have children have a have an assembly Disturbed and just come in and start start secretly projecting the grace of God and the love of God and sweetness and calmness and prayerfulness I'm here to tell you it'll capture emotions and bring them subject it'll calm nerves and bring you out and it it'll it's the best cure for madness you ever want is the presence of almighty God around you when you don't have that in your home and your home can be really open to a lot of chaos when you don't have it in a church a church can really uh get IM get out of balance and trying to operate gifts and trying to operate power and trying to operate this and and and and I'm going to tell you something you've got it that's why it's so important when the song leader comes and the musicians play and that you do your part there's a sending units and receiving units and the senders and the receivers join together and Harden mind and lift up anthems to God and then God comes down to inhabit that and then people are without having hands laid on them with no prayer being prayed I've seen that while worship was going on people being healed while preaching is going on while Peter yet spake these words I've witnessed that I've witnessed people being healed of incurable diseases delivered of oppressive Spirits young people come to know Christ the Holy Ghost be poured out I've seen these things happen I've experienced them firsthand I know of what I'm talking about so we find that you know no matter how much I would preach and I'm just making these statements from that from that message these are some points and I'm just making them as points of principle these are not necessarily doctrinal teaching this is principles that a prophet left us in the message recognizing your day in its message so we find then that that atmosphere has to be in place wouldn't matter matter how much I preach see whatever I would do whatever you would do it it it it cannot be ripened and other words it can't come to manifestation it cannot come to be Vindicated it'll never be proven in your life the only one who can do it is the one who said I am the light of the world so it takes the light in nature it takes the sunlight to give life to the Earth it takes the S so in light to give life to you you can't get it without that you you have a life you have a human life you your heart's beating your lungs are moving and your brain is firing but I'm here to tell you something friends that's not life the only life is the one that comes down from the bread of life from the Fountain of Life from him who is life amen otherwise you're just dying you're not living until the life of God is living in you and then when that happens you can never die wouldn't even matter what happens to the functions of this body it might stop functioning you might have a disease and and and your body gets to the point where it can no longer sustain life and you'll escape the bonds of your body and and Paul said if that happens don't worry we have a body already waiting a body not made with hands in the heavens reserved waiting Hallelujah and so so so now I hope that you're emphasizing and you'd be missing You' be missing my main theme if you just think I'm up here teaching Doctrine over these last several and today's part four I'm not teaching Doctrine I'm trying to get you to come to this principle that that you have a gene of God that's how you recognize God that's that's how Peter recognized Jesus and Jesus recognized Peter Flesh and Blood didn't tell you that but my Father revealed it and I say that thou art Peter you know Peter had said to him Thou Art the Son of God he said th are Peter and so they they they they they it was a recognition that they that they were they they had the same heavenly father they had the same Heritage can you appreciate today as a Believer with a gene of God that you share Heritage with the creator of all things that you also came from God and you also go back to God you also are a part of it and that's how you respond and that's why it res it resounds in your heart so these are things that the Apostle Paul said you need to think on these encourage one another with these things that you're Children of the day you're not of the night see the world is drunken in the night but let us be sober let us of the who are of the day see and so so we find then that it wouldn't matter how much I preach or how much music we play or how many people sit in this building we must have the sunlight of Christ amen see that there has to come forth a power there has to come forth the Holy Spirit himself to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or as brother Brandon would say to make manifest that what he's predicted would happen in this day and that's important because one of the things he said would happen in this day is they would lay their hands on the sick and they would recover and I want to see that Hallelujah that that he had given you power to tread on serpents scorpions and over all the power you've been given power over all the power of the enemy and I say I want to have that as a reality Hallelujah you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be a witness I want to see that happen I want that for me I want that for you see so he we then we have to have this appreciation for laying in the presence of the Sun and that has it that's going to start with recognizing your hour in Prophecy amen when you recognize say what's so important about recognizing my hour in Prophecy because when you recognize your hour then you recognize your Authority because you see what he says would be happening not just in the world I mean that's the easiest part when I overlay history and show things that happened in in the world that they match the Bible that's that's almost Child's Play I've done it for so many years but but that's all that does is make you a good Theologian but when you can recognize what the promise says about you that during this time there would be a people and that there would be a message and that there would be a sunlight and there would be a token and that it would put the enemy to flight amen see so whether it's whether it's true world events whether it's true in the children of the devil or true in the children of God the evening light produces that what a time we live in so brother brandham goes back to hosea's prophecy and Hosea talks about how that after two days that Israel would be restored how that they would be dispersed first and Scattered for two days but after two days in the third day he would restore and and when you count that up we're today sitting just just under 2800 years we're well into the third day and and and so you say okay well can can we correlate it sure we can it was just it was less than a century ago that something happened in history that has never ever ever happened in history where a nation an ancient Nation completely went out of existence and were dispersed and carried and absorbed and assimilated by other nations but at the end time it would come back and raise a flag again its original flag and have its original government and that would be Israel Israel was restored as a nation after having been lost as a nation for more than two 2,000 years and that is that is hosea's prophecy coming to pass and so indeed the third day he will revive us so so now brother brandham says so there's why your trumpets are coming in that's because this is all about the restoration of Israel amen see I thought it was all about a gentile bride going in the Rapture that's an event on the way to an event the event is him being made known to His People Israel amen and so they had to be released from the Ottoman Empire historically because the prophecy said they would under the first woe they had to be driven out of Central Europe and sent back and there had to be a promised land and and because that's what the prophecy said would happen under the second wo amen and we see it and it happens and and the bow for declaration and Harry Truman and Winston Churchill and the all of these things are going on and World War II and Igman and Hitler and what made Igan and Hitler so crazy it's in Prophecy it said this is what would happen 200 million demons would go and anoint them to to to do genocide on God's people but what would it be it would actually work into the plan of God to bring Israel home say but that's terrible six million of them were martyred but the Bible says that God gave every true Israelite a white robe of eternal life I'm here to tell you not one of them are on the other side today regretting or lamenting because they're in the under the altar of almighty God with white robes what does this life matter if you have eternal life coming the things we get so Disturbed and perplexed over we let the devil wreck our nerves and wreck our homes and cause chaos I'm here to tell you I've said it before and I'll say it again this life is not primarily about this life this life is about the next life I'm only here training preparing getting ready to rule and reign with Christ in a perfect world of Millennial world that's the world I want to live in and that's not somewhere in the Milky Way that's right here and they're trying to have peace but there'll be no peace until Jesus comes and establishes his King his throne back in Israel again back in Jerusalem and so there's your trumpets that's the hour we're living in that's the that's the time that's the day see and so they have been scattered and they were they were blinded but they would be gathered they'd be gathered back to their homeline Homeland and and ready to recognize the atonement they'll say you know when they when it's made known to them they'll say where did you get these scars when he's made known and he'll say in the house of my friends and the Bible talks about the atonement the the atonement is when when they come back the Feast of atonement is not to to for Christ to die again not for the lamb to be slain again but a but a mourning for that he that he was slain and they slew him yeah that their very Messiah they killed their own Messiah after waiting for him since the days of Abraham and the Bible talks about how that they would separate and and cry and weep for days like a family that lost their only son because they had rejected it see and so but then of course they're going to receive life and the Gentiles are called out and the bride is ready and this is why brother Brandon would kind of do what what I'm doing today he would say look everything you see in this recent history recognize your day in its message the things you see in the streets and on and in the government and in the schools and in education in science and in politics recognize your day because the Bible said during that time that you're seeing there'd be a message and a people that would believe it and become prepared and while he's getting Israel ready he's preparing a gentile bride to take a flight prior to the tribulation period so it's it's it's a story that's been told and the Rapture of the church well brother brandom asked a very fair question of me he's asking it of you he's asking it of the audience that was in front of him in 1964 it's asked to us today is it is it just a story that's been told is it just a myth to us is it is it something that that kind of sounds real and you say yeah brother Jason you kind of made a point there yeah that history is true yeah I did prophesy that okay I can kind of I can kind of see the X's and O's and I can see how it all lines up but but still that that's just something that sounds real I as a Bible teacher I can make it sound real that's my whole job is to explain it to you and make it sound real see is it but but but but brother Ram is still talking about something that that on the outside you know that we can believe it kind of like I can believe it intellectually because you're making it make sense I was speaking to a very good friend of mine in in Germany and he he was he just a wonderful man and I I'm trusting that his even his respect to Matt and I and the help that he provided us even then and even after and if I text him today he'd help me again and and uh but he had a he had a hard time figuring out who God was and he he understood a higher power and he just wasn't exactly sure and a lot of times that comes a lot of times that comes because of the confusion the church has put out to people and they look at the way the church nominal acts and they're very confused to say my goodness I thought this whole thing about God and then when I see the way churches are and the way people are and the way Society is and the way Wars are and there's too much pain and too much sorrow I I can't figure out I I know something started all this but but but but is there a god is he an energy is he a light is he something you know and and they're not sure and I was standing there talking to him and and we just started talking about you know the possibility of a God and and you know could he be open to that and he said you know I can and he said but I'm so confused because of what I've seen and and I and I and I've seen such a poor I said you've SE what you've seen is a poor representation of the real the the the devil always has an impersonation yes amen see and I said I'm going to tell you something you're you're not you're you're actually you know uh in a in a in a not a bad spot because you're you're a Believer trying to believe you just are looking for something real and there have been many of God's family down Through the Ages and that's all they needed they just needed to see something real it meant in their heart they knew there was something but what is it I I I feel like as a human that there ought to be a higher level than just than just human I'm born I eat I die a baby's born he grows he eats he dies I mean is that all there is oh that's not all there is hallelujah there's a creator of of Life who's trying to save a world and bring them back to life see the devil broke the world in in in in consorting with mankind mankind agreed to do it and I said you know I said listen I said I'm going to tell you something a very oldtime preacher said and was very wise and I said and he started talking about mercy and forgiveness and you know being being good enough and and and all this and I said listen I'm going to tell you something as a preacher and you'd probably be shocked to hear a preacher say this uh but I'm repeating a very great prophet God will never condemn a man for being a sinner sir never because the man was born a sinner it's not even his fault the Creator knows that he was born into it it's like a shotgun wedding you got trapped into it you see and brother Ram called it that the old shotgun wedding you that's from you young people probably don't know what that is amen but but but anyway God would never condemn a man for being a sinner because the man was born a sinner that what would condemn the man is that he remained in that state when he didn't have to that God sending his son in Christ died for that sin so that you by accepting that atonement dying for you that Christ took your place at Calvary and can absolve you of every sin and your birth your wrong birth transgressions anything that happens in your life by your faith in the in the atonement you can gain eternal life and you won't have to die so you find that the that the man the sinner who dies condemns his own self because he refused to accept the their pardon because we know that a pardon is only a pardon if it's received as a pardon I don't know why I'm hearing all of that I keep hearing I don't know if I'm hearing that uh but maybe just turn my monitors down because distracting me so so we find that that this God is very real and and he wants to be known and how that and that and he said to me he said he said he started calling me brother Jason he said I I've never I've never heard it explained like that I said well you have now I said there's a real God and and I said how do you know but what he flew my son and I halfway around the world and had you be our Uber driver because he he was you say would God do that you better believe he would do that he would cross the Seas he'd cross the Seven Seas to find one child that's why your life should be dedicated to God you don't know who you might rub shoulders with out there in the world you need to have the the aura and the atmospheres of eternal life moving around you hallelujah amen so we find that it's about you know brother Brandon would say so is it is this something that is just convincing teaching does it you you believe it or because it makes sense see he said says or or what a big or or is it something that's in us that's a part of us that is more than life to us and I say right there that's exactly where I'm at there's something about it when I read it it's in me it's a part of me when I pray when I talk to the Lord when I read the message when I hear a tape there's something in me to start saying amen amen that's a familiar voice when I when I see the power of God move when I see him in your lives when I see God moving in your families I say there's a real God when I see the sick healed I say there's a real God when I know my own life can experience the power and the demonstration and I can be delivered of all manner of evil then I know there's a real God and a real word who has a real love and a and I have a real faith not just because I've been convinced doctrinally but because it's been made alive to me so what attitude then do we set in this morning is that a fair question Amen in this Tabernacle so which one are you yeah are you just convinced by teaching because it makes sense to you see you you've heard me make that challenge around the world there's no one that can disprove what we believe not using this book no by no means because this is the only one we teach out of but but even that wouldn't save them even if I could prove it and I've done it and it's still didn't save them see it's the mercy of God to come down and that God has to drop that sunlight down into your heart so what should be your attitude today God drop that down upon me today Lord otherwise there's no way for you to get there it's only whom the son will reveal himself to but he will will rece respond to a humble heart who will ask him for it just like a a child with a loving father and Jesus said if you ask your father you're hungry as a child and you ask him for fish or bread would he give you a stone or would he give you a serpent see said what doesn't your heavenly father much more love you than your Earthly father amen see so he will he'll open the windows of Heaven he'll come down to you today he'll come down to right where you're sitting right now in this Tabernacle and make himself known to you if you ask him to in a humble way amen he says the the the church has forgot its prophets now here here I'm kind of starting to come down now to where we you know took a pause last Sunday and the church has forgot their prophets see they don't need them anymore remember the text I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing see they don't need them anymore they claim see and that's the reason that's the reason they're in the condition they are the reason the world is in the condition it's in is because it has this belief I have need of nothing I have everything I need and that's the reason they're naked and miserable and blind wretched and don't know it because they don't recognize the hour they're living in brother brandom said it like this and it's a strange way of saying it he says that's the reason they are naked and blind and wretched and don't know it because they don't recognize the hour we're living in and he says they don't notice it now you're starting to understand why and now you're now you're catching the the story behind the story the world this is why Satan fills up your life with so many distractions and he'll use whatever he's got to do political Intrigue Global you know conspiracy uh technology science education learning entertainments he'll he'll flood your mind with every kind of distraction he can come up with and he can come up with a lot of them to do what so you won't notice you might sit here and believe what I'm saying doctrinally as a as a scriptural principle and say brother Jason I get it you've convinced me I believe it but you still won't notice the condition you're in see so this is where I I read to you last time and I'm not going to read it again on the screen that's that's the the thing that's the matter with the message today now this is here's where such a burden in my heart has been because brother brandham now he's not talking about Pentecost or the Pentecostal church or Methodist Baptists lutherans Catholics whatever he's got a plenty to say about that in our part two I think we read you a whole whole bunch of quotes where he talked about things that went on in the Pentecostal church it was obvious he's talking to them and not to the message churches because they were doing things we don't do denying the word and women dressing this way and men and we and they didn't believe and didn't baptize right well he certainly wasn't talking about us but now he comes to us this the thing that's the matter with the message today see and so I said I thought my I want to know what's wrong here's what's here's what's wrong if there's something wrong in the message today here it is is those who obtain it in their hearts must must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened and if Satan wants to distract you from anything it's that amen he will use a career and family and friends and entertainment Recreation he'll use he'll use legit things that you really that really do require your time like making a living and getting an education and those are totally legit things that you have to do we do have to have the functions of living we can't be so Heavenly minded that I'm no earthly good I do got to live here I do got families to raise I do got bills to pay I do got you know and that's all legitimate stuff but what he's trying to get you to do is just be absorbed by all of that so that you don't you don't segment or a lot premium time to laying in the presence of the Sun and hence the seed Gene that you have that gives you the ability to believe the message never gets ripened and therefore you never really have that that wonderful moist experience you never have that that oozing power and that oozing anointing and that that flowing that when you walk around it just begins to flow around and it it'll it saves your children and heals marriages and heals the body and heals the mind and and and and this is what's wrong in the message according to him the problem is not intellectualism versus emotionalism that when you make it that all that is is like you're trying to talk about a civil war that as far as I can tell doesn't even exist right I don't know any message churches that follow intellectualism only and deny any emotion of the spirit and I I don't know any I I've seen churches like that but not in this message I don't know any that only want emotionalism and and don't and don't want anything to do with the word so the devil is creating this fake War as a distraction from what the real problem problem is is that you need to ripen you need to ripen that's the real need it's not about preaching deeper things and it's not about working you into a into an emotional state I'm for teaching the Deep things of God and I'm for encouraging emotion and encouraging you to get out of your comfort zone and break all the crust and rust off of you and raise a hand and wave it to God and hop up and down and say Glory Hallelujah say well I don't feel it well start saying and you'll feel I'm here to tell you there's nothing wrong with that but still yet that's not the emphasis that's not what he identifies as the problem the problem is ripening or the lack thereof amen so the answer is laying in the presence of the son and that speaks of sincerity before God Consecration and dedication and a prayer life and a church attendance and Bible reading and tape listing and fellowship of the Saints it's all adding to your faith and adding to this and adding to that and adding to this this is what's needed bethl Tabernacle am see laying in the presence of the sun to get ripened sometimes what shocks me is churches that I look at and see ripe ripe fruit I see the real power of God and I see a I see deep teaching and great and great emotion and and and it's all legit and driven by the Holy Spirit and I and I want to say to them okay what are you screaming about you you've got everything you need why why why why you know why you trying to create a war that doesn't even exist that's right oh well there's churches that are against emotion I don't know of one not a message Church remember just CA you are a follower of the message doesn't make you a believer in the word so there might be people who follow the teachings and and maybe they've got weaknesses in that and weaknesses in this and but I'm here to tell you when it comes to the real seed Gene God the real family of God the mainstream of the message I get we have fanaticism on the fringes you're always going to have that it's never not been Moses had that they've always had that you're always going to have that as a friend you're always going to have a COR and Dayan you're always going to have Believers make Believers and unbelievers but why spend all my time War at warning you of what you already know and and and you you you avoid hearing what you're hearing today that you got to lay in the presence of the Sun and be ripen and then you won't have to worry about the power of God it'll move automatically not CA you chase it but because it flows it follows the believer amen oh my I don't even want want to I told I told the ministers I said I definitely don't want to create a war talking about a war create a conflict about the conflict when there is no conflict there is no war I'm here to tell you the Bride of Jesus Christ is Marching In the step of the Gospel all around the world she's in love with Christ and in love with the word and the power of God moves among her and I've sailed the seven seas and I've been around I know what I'm speaking of friends the ma the family of God is in love with his word amen so this is where so so I'm not even here to even preach on those things why why would I why would I you know preach on those things when we already have a mature word and a mature approach and mature people God bless you I see a lot of spiritual maturity you're such an encouragement to me I mean that so sincerely don't think I can't come under the mental attack and strength of the enemy and when he when he does I just start thinking about all you people and how you love me and you praying for me and you believe in you come to church and you raise your hands and you wave them and you say amen and I just say well if I'm if I'm so wrong devil how did that get produced how how is it a church of people who love God and believe in the power of the Risen Christ Hallelujah see so the last time we talked about where he said laying in the the presence of the sun to be ripened the word to be ripened in your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about see now I'm watching clock don't get nervous yeah I I will it's your time I get worried about but I'll take plenty I'll take all of mine but it's how much of yours I take that I get a little amen thank you brother Richard amen praise the Lord so good to hear your voice buddy amen wow oh my so so then I we we come to uh our verse because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need o of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and Naked Brother Brian says in the in the I think this is out of the L to see in church age in the cab the church is complacent now here he's he's interpreting this verse the church is complacent she is satisfied with what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough see and so he says um compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that I I love that because he's actually not afraid to have you take a serious look at at history he's not afraid to have you really think about the word of God I mean you've got to be confident you're teaching the word of God if you're inviting people to to go fact check you you better have confidence in what you're saying cuz they they might go do it amen compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that where is the power where is the love where is the purified church that with stod sin and walked with faith toward Jesus where is the unity you can't find it that's a fair statement because now we're not talking about the bride the bride goes into a Rapture the church goes through the tribulation remember the bride was a church called out of a church like Israel was called out of Egypt see in The Exodus so Revelation 18:4 the message of this hour the message of this messenger of this day was come out of her my people come out of that systems of man come out of those denominational Creeds they're they're just barnyards you're an eagle you're not a chicken pecking around in the manure piles you're an eagle meant to soar in the heavenlies up where the voice of God can speak see so we find then that he he says you know where if you've got the power of God then where's where's the purified church amen because the the book of Acts church was a purified Church they lived righteous in Holiness and they practiced it see so so he says if this church has all it needs now this Fallen church this lean church if this church has all it all it needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it at all and yet they had far more than they have today and of course his reference is right there to Acts chapter 4 I mean they had already had the Holy Ghost poured out in Acts chapter 2 but now they're in Acts chapter 4 crying out for more almost like they don't even got it saying Lord come and do these Great Signs by thy by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and heal the sick and move and raise the dead and move Among Us and the Bible says and the the the rushing wind and the building Shook and it all verse chapter two happened all over again he came in like a right a mighty went and filled all the house and they began to speak with tongues and move under the power of God it just goes to show that that early church was never satisfied they always wanted more of God and more of God and more of God and I want you to not be satisfied with last week's anointing say Lord I need a fresh anointing today I got to face a fresh Devils with fresh ideas and and I'm going to need the fresh presence of the holy spirit in my life so you never sto going forward see so he comes back now to the second half of of where we read we finished last time with lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened the word to be ripened in your heart to bring forth and live to bring forth and live what we're talking about not just that you believe it but to live what we're talking about see and then he picks up here there it is and to live what we're talking about Lord God I'm asking the bride tonight the ones that I feel has pulled away in Waiting may they separate themselves from everything oh my you don't know how this cries out in my heart I'm praying this for you I'm praying this for me they must lay in the presence of the warm sun sunlight of the Son of God bathing in his word and in his love Grant it dear God I say today Grant it dear God grant it to me Grant it to you there's nothing that matters if you don't have that chase the world go after it capture it conquer it be the king of it it's all going to Ash and sinder but there's a world coming and a Life coming Hallelujah and that's what I want to be a part of Oh my he says here in first in first Thessalonians uh let me let me catch this before I or let me just go to it and then I'll I'll darken it but Paul talks about you're going to read it here in a minute 1 Thessalonians the very first chapter and he comes to the fifth verse for emphasis I'm going to read it here and you're going to read it there for our gospel came not unto you in word only but in the power but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance now is that what you vote for today if I said to you could y'all just be happy if I just brought you the word only please for goodness sake you're putting too much pressure on me I'll just I'll just preach the word to you and prove it to you and then go home I don't think i''d be Pastor here very long You' say brother Jason we want what the early church had well what they have well they didn't have it in just word only but we also want it in power and we want it in the Holy Ghost and we want it in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake I'm here to tell you friends Paul Loved These Thessalon Ians oh my almost above other churches he actually called him he he refers to him as their as their father you're he said you're like my children he loved this Thessalonian Church especially chapters one and two you go home today and read it we're going to read a portion of it here in a second but they were like a relief to Paul that those Thessalonians were like a breath of fresh air they they were like a reset for his weary Spirit oh and Paul got TR you know just feeling low he could just he could he could think about those Thessalonians he didn't even get to be around them that long they he he he brought the church in and the next thing you know uh they coming after him and there's a big tbol and some things and he has to run for it and he and and he and he was only there in almost no time and he's worried about him and he wants to get back and Satan hinders him and so he sends Timothy and I'm gonna send Timothy and when Timothy comes back and says Paul don't worry oh you planted them right brother Paul you got them established they're flourishing they love God their reputation is going all throughout the coast see and so they loved the word they dedicated themselves to its applications and and the power and the demonstration of the supernatural moved among them abundantly freely and abundantly see now let's look at it here's Paul we give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing see he he's so encouraged remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in the Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our father knowing Brethren beloved your election of God for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and ye became followers of us and of of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with the joy of the Holy Ghost I love that they reive the word under much Affliction with the joy of the Holy Ghost so that ye were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and AA far for far from you for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and AA but also in every place your faith to God to godward is spread abroad so that we need not speak anything you're so full of the Holy Spirit almost got nothing to say You're Just in Love With God you're one big happy family you're all together you're one for all and all for one you're of one mind and one Accord and you you all believe the word of God there no devil is safe here wouldn't that be wonderful friend to say no devil is safe in bethl Tabernacle Hallelujah because we believe the word of God Hallelujah see for they themselves show us what manner of entering in we had unto you see in other words your life is proving to me that I didn't run in vain and how you turn to God from Idols to serve the living and the true God what an encouragement to this weary brother and to wait for his son from Heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Wrath to come he drops down in chapter 2 two oops drops down in chapter two for this cause also we thank god without ceasing because when you received the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe it didn't just affect them it affected them it wasn't just Goosebumps or emotion or intellectualism it affected change in their life I have little interest in affecting and affecting your emotions or or impressing you with knowledge I want to see effectual change come in our lives friends that's why we worship that's why we gather we're effectually worketh also in you that believe for you know brethren for ye Brethren became followers of the churches of God which is which in Jud Judea are in Christ Jesus for ye also have suffered uh like things of your own what a church what a church what a model for us today as Believers see what a model for us today as Believers let me see if I have much further I want to go uh I'm going to make a few comments here and we'll catch just maybe two more slide two or three more slides and that'll be enough for today but what what a model that we read Amen in these verses you know H as Believers today who say you know that we want to see more of the return to the original Pentecost we want that same God what does that mean brother Jason it means that we want that same God moving over us I want the same kind of Victory I want the same kind of overcoming power and I want it daily I don't just want it on Sundays and Wednesdays I want it daily I want to see the devil put under my feet daily and fact is I want to see it hourly because I recognize my hour I'm recognizing the hour that I have arrived at in the in the prophecy oh Hallelujah friends the same Holy Ghost operation of the gifts of the Spirit the same holy ghost that that caused everything to to operate in perfect spirit spiritual order and I and I want the same Zeal to worship God in spirit and in truth say do you do you want us to be emotional I want you to have the Zeal of the spirit and however however that affect you If It Makes You Weep and cry if it makes you fall on your face if it makes you like me jump up and down sometimes I can't help it I just start jumping up and down why cuz I I want to jump out of my own body I want to jump into another realm Hallelujah Hallelujah it requires if we want all of those things do we do we Hallelujah am then it requires the same kind of dedication that they had that they had it requires the same kind of sincerity that we see in these verses that we read finally brother brandham says here in trying to do God a service without it being his will it's a wheat now but we're plenty green uhhuh that's right have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst to know what the spirit of the Living God moving among moving in his word and showing us the things yet so this this is where brother brandham this is what he mean he meant this is this is what laying in the presence of the son is all about see he goes on God at this little altar of every heart present here and around the nation I think he's in a prayer here may The Waters from under the altar of God gush out this morning upon your church and water it Lord for the seasons just about finished give it life the Waters of life that it might be also to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened for your Garner so it's it's more than a cliche lay in the presence of the Sun what does that even mean that sounds like a cliche it's far more than a cliche it's not a play on words from a prophet it's not just some you know something we say to people and send them on their way go lay in the presence of the Sun be a good little boy good little girl go lay in the presence oh I got all these problems brother Jason just go lay in the presence of the son oh what does that even mean it's about sincerity before God it's about dedication before God it's about having the right desire and the right mental attitude toward his word it's about not getting distracted it's about consecrating your mind it's about taking the time to love on him so that he will love on you it's something that can be activated I'm here to tell you something friends this isn't Hocus Pocus this isn't Magic this is the power of the word there this can be activated in you say how because you got a gene of God in you and and when the Holy Spirit comes on that when you present yourself as a as a as a living Tabernacle and you're willing to do what it takes to add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and knowledge and go on all the way up the scale and you're willing to allow dedication and sincerity in your life and you're willing to lay aside the weights and sins that does so easily beset you or distract you and you're willing to run this race see when people come together to hear the word of God there ought to be an expectation that the waters from under the throne are going to flow down through here brother brandom talked about I think it was sister sheffy had that dream and brother she had a dream and how that the the the mountain and all down through the waters were just running down through the channels all the way down and that's that's the life the the Capstone is in the top of the mountain and there's where the water gush out from under his throne he's he's enthroned above the bride and all the brother B said those Waters moving down through the channels just running out everywhere and say Lord let them just run down let it saturate me let my whole life be a conduit of the waters that come out from under the Throne of God washing our minds clean flooding down with his presence filling our hearts with the presence of the Son of God sunlight so in light to do what ripen the gene of God oh you'll never get it with dry intellectualism you'll never get it with worked up emotionalism but it's real and it's to be had and you can have it right now for all those who wanted to say Lord God flood down over my life let the waters from under the throne move down and saturate stand up with me friends today and say almighty God today May the waters from under your throne may they just flow down through my life say how's that going to work because Underneath Him underneath him my life is in the line and the Order of God's word I'm right where I need to be I'm spiritually positioned in Christ I'm believing with full faith and Assurance I have no doubt in the word of God I have no question in my mind that he keeps his promises yeah let me tell you something friend Jesus keeps all of his promises and he can keep for you he can keep a promise to you right now bow your heads with me oh let me tell you something friends when this word is ministered and received in faith the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost accompany the preaching and teaching of God's word every time I want to say that again the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost all heads bowed now I want to leave you with these words the power and demonstration when when this word is ministered as it is being today in faith and it's being received as it is today in faith I'll assure you that the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost accompany the preaching and the teaching of the word of God the pursuit of either without the other is to break the pattern of the Gospel amen you don't need to chase emotion and you don't need to chase intellectual learning you don't we you don't need to chase signs and wonders we don't have to chase any of that why Chase it when the heavens are filled with the real oh Hallelujah the promise in the word of God it's your inheritance in the Saints all the realities of Christ are hanging in the Heavenly atmospheres around you why don't you just reach those hands up into that atmosphere it's right above your head and just say oh God let it fall on me today let it let it heal my mind and heal my spirit and and set me in the paths of righteousness Hallelujah granted Lord as you see honest hands everywhere across the building you're always ready to meet the need of a prepared heart and a prepared mind mind you're always ready to keep your promises and your word to be fulfilled oh Master this is an hour like the world has never known and now we've arrived at that time at the end of all things is at hand and the this people they literally are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come the message has already went forth the trumpets have already begun to draw Israel home the woes have already uh been unfolded the the vials have already begun to be poured out judgments the tribulation people Lord don't let them re don't let them think of the tribulation as something that just comes after the bride is gone the tribulation judgments started with the first woe that was the the pre-tribulation that was the partiality the partial fulfillment of those vials and it's already started in this day and and and and had it not been stopped it would have went wo one wo two wo 3 and it would have swept Mankind from the Earth but he couldn't do it because Israel had to be in their Homeland he had to seal them and they couldn't get sealed outside of their Homeland they had to go home as a prophet taught us they had to be back there in the promised land to receive the Messiah to receive the day of atonement they had to be back there and now they're back there and and the world was prophesied to go off into darkness and churches into darkness how that they would be rich and increased with Goods but be poor and miserable and blind and naked and unaware we see it a bride a prophet would come call out a bride it's happened the Mighty God would be unveiled he's here the restoration of the early church is what was foretold and we have it the seed Gene of God has come to life it's come back full circle the abstract title we have it it's here it's arrived it's happening the word is happening all around us don't let us sit in a stuper don't let us sit back idle with no Zeal of the spirit oh Lamb of God these people raised up their hands in great sincerity that they're asking you today Lord come down let the waters from under the throne flow down onto me in me through me out of me every in every direction May you grant it to us today Lord God we love you we thank you I have much more to say but it's it's enough for today I feel completely at Liberty to bring it to a close and now L we'll sing now we'll worship now we'll water the seed of the word that has been given to us today the gospel is a seed Jesus called it that and it's good seed it's good seed children it'll grow just let the Holy Spirit water it in you you don't have to make it grow it'll grow grow it's has life in it it's the seed of the word of God Hallelujah in Jesus name we pray oh let's lift them up now today lift up those hands for I have not the strength to praise you near enough Hallelujah for I have nothing oh my I have nothing [Music] without you take my voice and take my voice pour it out let it sing the songs of Mercy I have found for I have nothing oh I have have nothing without nothing without you lord
