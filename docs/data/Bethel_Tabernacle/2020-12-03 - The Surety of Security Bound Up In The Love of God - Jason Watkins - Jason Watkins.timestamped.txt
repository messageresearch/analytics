[36:13] number of
[36:14] prayer requests we will get to we're
[36:16] going to do our service a little
[36:17] different tonight we have the
[36:19] lord's supper and uh so i'm going to not
[36:22] preach very long and then we'll just
[36:23] take up our
[36:24] prayer request and then we will go
[36:27] straight
[36:28] into the communion supper amen
[36:32] um i think that's how i do it
[36:37] amen praise the lord
[36:40] matthew chapter 26 god bless you
[36:43] while you're finding your place in
[36:45] matthew 26
[36:47] just let me give you um some
[36:49] announcements
[36:50] for the weekend so
[36:55] there's a couple of things i want to say
[36:57] first of all i suppose we should
[36:59] dispense with the schedule
[37:01] and um it's cut we've kind of i've
[37:04] deliberated
[37:04] quite a bit about that and i came to the
[37:08] decision that we're going to
[37:10] start it at 3 p.m and
[37:14] part of the reason for that is because
[37:16] the weather looks like it might rain all
[37:18] morning
[37:19] and maybe even past noon and that will
[37:21] give it a little bit of time
[37:23] to dry up 3 p.m is generally the warmest
[37:25] part of the day
[37:27] and so that will give us a couple hours
[37:30] of sunshine to
[37:33] eat our meal and have some fellowship
[37:35] and there'll be some activities and
[37:37] different things like that
[37:39] we're going to it's usually dark around
[37:42] 5 30
[37:43] so we'll have the fires going and we're
[37:46] gonna
[37:46] we've got that one rack thing out here
[37:49] that you see i might get another one so
[37:50] we can have a little bit bigger
[37:52] bigger fire and uh the little kids will
[37:55] have their own
[37:57] uh fire running mason all right brother
[38:00] amen you have your own fire man
[38:01] praise god and so i knew i knew that'd
[38:04] make him smile
[38:06] and so we're going to let them have a
[38:08] little bit of fire brother jd is going
[38:09] to
[38:10] be in they're coming in i don't know how
[38:12] they're going to pull it off but
[38:13] they're planning to drive in saturday
[38:15] and make it to the
[38:17] gathering and so brother jason is
[38:19] planning to have
[38:20] a little something for the for that
[38:22] junior youth group
[38:24] over a way at their own little camp fire
[38:27] while brother richie
[38:28] gathers around the bigger fire with us
[38:31] and i think
[38:32] if the lord doesn't change his mind he's
[38:33] going to give us his testimony
[38:35] and i just want to say again that i
[38:37] would implore
[38:38] every uh one that wants to be amazed
[38:41] at the glory of god and what god can do
[38:44] to a man's life
[38:45] uh come and hear that testimony and
[38:48] especially all the senior youth i'm
[38:49] gonna send them out
[38:51] uh um an invitation and i'm gonna send
[38:54] the cops to their house and beat on the
[38:56] door
[38:56] amen i wanna i wanna try to get them all
[38:59] there because it is so
[39:01] so very impacting and then of course
[39:05] we're gonna probably go from like three
[39:06] to seven thirty because we have church
[39:08] the next morning and then
[39:10] you know it's dark so quickly and i
[39:11] don't want the cleanup teams to have to
[39:14] be cleaning late into the night
[39:16] so probably run from about 3 p.m to 7
[39:19] 30 p.m somewhere around in there
[39:23] that time so we'll be we'll we'll be
[39:26] eating
[39:26] at three now my girls have figured out a
[39:30] whole system they're going to do
[39:32] my daughter-in-law's along with sister
[39:34] debbie trying to help them and
[39:35] sister jean also have her popcorn
[39:37] machine there and so
[39:39] we're looking forward everybody wants to
[39:40] come now praise the lord so
[39:43] amen i don't know if she'll dress up in
[39:45] her prairie dress or not you're going to
[39:46] do that sister mom
[39:47] praise the lord so if you haven't seen
[39:49] her in her prairie dress it is
[39:51] it is a sight to behold amen make you
[39:53] want to go back and live in the old days
[39:55] again
[39:56] and so uh we'll have that going and then
[39:58] um
[39:59] so uh they're they're gonna we're what
[40:01] we what we're going to need to do
[40:04] is you know be prudent concerning the
[40:06] pandemic and the virus going around
[40:07] we're going to take some extra steps now
[40:10] granted it's outdoors so we gain a
[40:12] little bit
[40:13] because you know the science tells us
[40:15] that outdoors
[40:16] there's a lot less risk however
[40:20] on the flip side you know inside here
[40:23] you know when you're
[40:24] seated you're you're masked up we're not
[40:27] doing handshaking all that well at a
[40:28] fellowship dinner
[40:30] almost all of that's going to go on so
[40:32] so we almost lose what we gain or it
[40:34] equals out
[40:35] so we are going to do some other things
[40:37] where
[40:39] my girls are going to have it all
[40:41] prepared and we're going to have
[40:42] barbecue and the fixins but
[40:44] it'll all be prepared individually we'll
[40:47] even have individual
[40:49] canned beverages so that we're not
[40:51] everybody grabbing one bottle or
[40:53] everybody grabbing one
[40:54] ice scooper so we're trying to think
[40:57] ahead and be
[40:58] proactive and uh and then the servers
[41:01] will have gloves on and
[41:03] masks and so we're just trying to be
[41:06] safe as is prudent and as i've said here
[41:09] and i say it
[41:10] without any hesitation we have not
[41:12] operated in fear at all
[41:14] but we have been prudent and the lord
[41:16] has honored that we have not had
[41:19] there's been a number of churches with
[41:20] terrible outbreaks that went through
[41:23] and so far the lord has spared us from
[41:26] that as far as we know
[41:27] no one has contracted it by coming to
[41:30] service here
[41:31] they get it going other places so the
[41:33] people who go other places but don't
[41:35] come to church
[41:35] this is the safest place you can be amen
[41:38] so uh we have a we're we're undefeated
[41:41] amen in assembly
[41:43] so praise the lord so we're going to
[41:45] take extra steps because we do want to
[41:47] be prudent
[41:48] and you know and be sensible be smart
[41:51] about it
[41:52] and so we are going to take and there
[41:53] might be some other little things that
[41:54] i'm forgetting
[41:56] but we are i just want you to know that
[41:58] we are thinking ahead proactively
[42:01] about ways to do it more safely being
[42:04] that it's a
[42:05] church dinner function slash gathering
[42:09] amen so that's going to be three
[42:12] to roughly 7 30 on saturday
[42:16] this coming saturday amen you love the
[42:18] lord
[42:20] and we're here tonight we're going to
[42:21] have the lord's supper and uh i know
[42:24] that
[42:24] there's you know we've got a number of
[42:26] prayer requests of people
[42:28] who are sick and uh who wanted to be
[42:31] here
[42:31] in church but i wouldn't let them and
[42:34] they asked me you know
[42:35] you think it'd be all right if i come
[42:36] and i just said nope the rule is if
[42:38] you're sick at all if you think
[42:40] if you even think that you have an
[42:42] illness just please don't come
[42:44] and those are some of the things that
[42:45] we've done uh also
[42:47] to keep we've installed air circulation
[42:50] systems that destroy
[42:52] um those the the virus and things like
[42:55] that and a host of other
[42:57] microorganisms so we're trying to do
[42:59] everything that we can
[43:01] and so we don't have everybody here
[43:03] tonight to be able to take communion
[43:04] so i'm considering strongly doing it
[43:06] every wednesday night for the rest of
[43:08] this year
[43:10] amen and and uh you know the catholics
[43:13] do it every weekend
[43:15] they have mass every sunday so my
[43:18] goodness how hard can it be
[43:21] amen and so you know at least at least
[43:24] you
[43:24] if i do that at least you'll know on
[43:26] wednesday nights you're going to get a
[43:27] short sermon
[43:29] amen so amen praise the lord i can hear
[43:32] brother eddie amen and from heaven
[43:35] amen so we're we're going to go right to
[43:38] the word of god tonight and we're going
[43:40] to have the lord supper i'm sorry we
[43:41] can't do the foot washing but that's
[43:43] again that's a step of prudence why
[43:45] we're not doing that
[43:47] uh so what's inside the fellowship hall
[43:49] it's too close in proximity and
[43:51] blah blah so we're going to wait and
[43:53] wait till we can get a little bit past
[43:55] this
[43:56] and we'll pick it back up but i'm
[43:59] seriously considering doing that
[44:00] if we don't do it every wednesday might
[44:02] do it every other wednesday for the rest
[44:03] of the year at least
[44:05] a man so you know i i think friends that
[44:09] god would honor something like that i do
[44:12] believe that i don't think it would
[44:13] become ho hum to us i think it might
[44:15] it might create a sincerity that we've
[44:18] needed
[44:20] amen so praise the lord to keep you
[44:22] living clean anyway that's for sure
[44:24] amen well you should be living clean
[44:26] anyway right amen the holy spirit
[44:29] produces
[44:30] a holy life um i don't think i'm
[44:33] missing any of my announcements
[44:36] if i am somebody can let me know and

[45:35] at matthew chapter 26.

[45:46] down through verse 30. matthew chapter
[45:49] 26
[45:50] verses 26 through 30.
[45:55] and as they were eating jesus took bread
[45:59] and blessed it
[46:00] and broke it and gave it to the to the
[46:03] disciples and said
[46:04] take eat this is my body
[46:07] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[46:11] gave it to them saying drink all of it
[46:15] for this is my blood in the new
[46:17] testament
[46:18] which is shed for many for the remission
[46:21] of sins isn't that wonderful
[46:24] but i say unto you i will not drink
[46:27] henceforth
[46:28] of this fruit of the vine until that day
[46:32] when i drink it new with you in my
[46:35] father's kingdom
[46:36] and when they had sung a hymn they went
[46:39] out
[46:40] unto the mount of olives let's pray
[46:45] father we thank you for your word
[46:47] tonight
[46:48] and i you see the special purpose that i
[46:51] have in my heart
[46:52] and i just stand before you humbly
[46:54] because i owe you everything lord i owe
[46:57] you every thought every word that i'm
[46:59] going to say tonight
[47:00] i owe it all to you you gave it to me
[47:02] lord
[47:03] and you gave me a special purpose and
[47:06] you and i have had quite a bit of
[47:08] discussion on it
[47:09] lord for weeks now and so tonight lord
[47:13] is for me somewhat of a of a new
[47:15] beginning
[47:16] a new front that we're we're drawing
[47:19] weapons to bear on the enemy and father
[47:22] so we're
[47:23] asking for your help now tonight in
[47:25] jesus christ's name
[47:27] amen god bless you friends you can be
[47:29] seated
[47:35] i'm speaking tonight as i sent you the
[47:38] title out earlier today
[47:41] the surety of security bound up
[47:45] in the love of god the surety of
[47:49] security
[47:50] bound up in the love of god
[47:55] there's quite a bit to say about the
[47:56] love of god and
[47:58] i'm gonna have to go quickly tonight i
[48:00] have a uh
[48:02] kind of a special thing on my heart that
[48:04] i want to
[48:05] not that this is a part of a series but
[48:08] it's
[48:09] it is it is tonight i was explaining to
[48:12] brother bruce i said tonight i'm going
[48:14] to take my first full broadside volley
[48:16] right into the heart of the enemy uh you
[48:19] know and i have a special purpose in
[48:21] that you know
[48:22] i believe friends that we are near the
[48:24] coming of the lord
[48:26] and i believe that that that that the
[48:28] bride around the world
[48:30] really needs god to come on the scene
[48:33] and many
[48:34] churches need fresh revival and i'm
[48:36] going to tell you this church needs
[48:37] some fresh revival and i need some and
[48:40] you need some how many want it
[48:42] amen you remember that you know the
[48:45] thing about revival is
[48:47] that you can't make it happen brother
[48:50] branham teaches us
[48:51] you can't make that happen he said god
[48:53] has to do that
[48:54] what you can do is pray for god to do it
[48:57] and you can try to prepare yourself now
[49:00] what you actually can do is once god
[49:03] does bring a revival
[49:04] he says then it's up to you to keep it
[49:06] going
[49:07] and so uh you know we we want to begin
[49:11] to
[49:11] prepare our hearts because we live in a
[49:14] very calamitous hour
[49:16] and i'm just a little bit loud by the
[49:18] trav not a whole lot down but maybe just
[49:20] a little bit might be the monitors
[49:22] if you hear me find out there it might
[49:24] just be monitors up here
[49:26] amen praise the lord that does sound a
[49:28] little better
[49:29] maybe a little more monitors back though
[49:31] not just find the happy medium where you
[49:33] were between where you are
[49:34] and you have it amen so you know
[49:38] jesus here in in in our we don't
[49:41] normally
[49:42] take it the communion service from
[49:44] matthew 26 usually
[49:46] i'm in john chapter 13 and we go from
[49:50] there but i
[49:51] was led here by the lord and and i think
[49:53] that
[49:54] it's it's because of this particular
[49:58] two particular sentences
[50:01] in matthew's rendering where he said
[50:04] for this is my blood in the new
[50:08] testament
[50:09] which is shed for many for the remission
[50:12] of
[50:12] sins and and i just think that that's an
[50:16] important statement i think that his
[50:18] broken body
[50:20] and his shed blood friends is a remedy
[50:23] for any disease
[50:27] amen it doesn't matter what it is
[50:30] it doesn't matter if it's cancer or
[50:32] covet
[50:33] it doesn't matter what disease it is his
[50:36] broken body and shed blood
[50:40] is a remedy for any disease it is
[50:43] a remedy for any condition of life
[50:48] no matter how critical
[50:52] and i i want you to absorb that tonight
[50:54] as we take the lord's supper
[50:57] i want you to remember the words of the
[50:59] lord jesus
[51:01] that this bread and this wine
[51:04] represents my body broken for you
[51:08] and my blood which is the life in the
[51:10] blood
[51:11] in the new testament by the holy ghost
[51:14] and i'm here to tell you something
[51:15] friends there is no disease
[51:17] that can take you when god decides to
[51:20] heal you
[51:21] and there and you can you can believe
[51:24] for
[51:25] the uh a healing of every affliction it
[51:27] doesn't matter what it is
[51:29] if if god decides not to well then
[51:31] that's just god's love anyway
[51:33] and and brother branham said he might
[51:35] commit you to suffering as he did job he
[51:38] might commit you to death as he did paul
[51:40] we've lost people praying for them that
[51:43] doesn't change god's word
[51:44] that doesn't undo calvary that doesn't
[51:47] take the efficacy of
[51:48] of what his broken body i'm here to tell
[51:51] you don't let the devil
[51:52] tell you that any situation is an
[51:54] evidence that god
[51:56] is suddenly can't keep his word
[51:59] that i don't care what your condition in
[52:01] life is i don't care what it is
[52:04] it doesn't matter how critical
[52:07] it is his blood and his broken body
[52:11] is sufficient a sufficient remedy
[52:14] for everything any affliction
[52:19] any sickness whether physical
[52:22] or emotional or spiritual
[52:26] so whether it's in your body in your
[52:28] spirit
[52:29] or in your soul i'm here to tell you his
[52:32] broken body and his shed blood
[52:35] can fix anything there is
[52:38] nothing beyond the reach of god's power
[52:42] when you you know when you need healing
[52:45] for the the weakness that this age
[52:49] has caused and we have it
[52:53] we have it this age
[52:56] is as has arrived at such a time
[53:00] in the atmospheres that it has it is a
[53:04] laodicea has a poison and a toxin
[53:08] in its in its atmospheres you say oh i
[53:12] don't
[53:12] i don't have this in my home and i don't
[53:14] participate in that
[53:15] brother branham said the lid's torn off
[53:17] of hell and demon powers are streaming
[53:20] through the earth
[53:21] it doesn't matter where you go what
[53:22] you're doing let me tell you something
[53:24] friends
[53:24] even coming to church you've got a
[53:27] battle against
[53:28] satan even sitting here right now
[53:30] hearing the word of god
[53:31] you've got a battle against satan and
[53:34] him trying to make you doubt everything
[53:36] i want to tell you tonight don't
[53:37] doubt god the bible teaches us
[53:42] that we're never to limit the god of
[53:44] israel don't despise the day of even
[53:46] small things amen
[53:51] little as much
[53:54] if god is in it
[53:58] any affliction i want to repeat it
[54:02] any sickness all the weakness that this
[54:05] age is causing you know when you need
[54:10] maybe you just are here tonight and you
[54:12] just need a replenishing of the energy
[54:16] that laodicea has taken from you
[54:20] that spiritual energy that spiritual
[54:23] feeling
[54:24] that moistness of the holy ghost i'm
[54:26] going to tell you something friends
[54:28] we'd like to all imagine that we never
[54:30] have those kinds of problems
[54:31] but we do we have problems where
[54:34] sometimes we
[54:35] we feel like our prayers get no higher
[54:37] than the ceiling we feel dry we feel
[54:39] alone
[54:39] well you're never alone good news you're
[54:42] never alone
[54:43] and and i'm here to tell you that all it
[54:45] takes is a prayer
[54:46] and a willingness to pray until you
[54:49] break through
[54:50] because god will respond to that
[54:54] jesus promised that i you know you you
[54:58] you i was speaking to a brother one time
[55:00] a very fine brother very good brother
[55:02] and
[55:02] the enemy had tricked him into believing
[55:04] that you know that god wouldn't
[55:06] wouldn't answer his prayers and he said
[55:09] i said well you should praise and i pray
[55:11] brother jason
[55:12] and he's not he you know i pray and
[55:14] nothing's happening i pray some more and
[55:16] nothing happens and i pray some more
[55:17] he's not
[55:18] he's not responding to me and i said
[55:20] listen oh
[55:21] friend that's contrary to his promise
[55:24] his promise is is that if you seek
[55:27] you'll find
[55:28] and if you knock it will be open now
[55:31] that's his word are you going to believe
[55:33] you
[55:33] are you're going to believe yourself
[55:34] you're going to believe the devil you're
[55:36] going to believe laodicea are you going
[55:37] to believe the lord jesus
[55:40] i'm going to tell you something friends
[55:41] he keeps all of his appointments
[55:43] he keeps his word
[55:47] and this this age this world this this
[55:50] world has taken something from us the
[55:52] word
[55:54] of god is what you need
[55:57] don't ever let the devil tell you
[56:00] otherwise
[56:01] jesus already proved it in the
[56:03] wilderness
[56:05] he proved that in the wilderness that
[56:07] all he needed was the word
[56:09] so this has already been certified
[56:11] friends
[56:12] it's already beyond question jesus
[56:15] already
[56:16] proved it three's a witness and he
[56:18] allowed the devil to come three times
[56:20] and three times
[56:21] jesus smacked him with the word and you
[56:23] know what it worked
[56:27] one time didn't do it two times didn't
[56:29] do it but three times
[56:31] did it amen
[56:35] you have to realize this and here is a
[56:38] very helpful thought
[56:40] that i believe the lord will help you
[56:43] with tonight if you can get
[56:45] if you can get your mind around this is
[56:48] that
[56:49] we are becoming something amen
[56:52] and you've got to realize that you're
[56:56] not here idling time you're not here
[56:58] figuring it out you're not here just
[56:59] being a christian until the lord comes
[57:02] that's not it it's not okay you're born
[57:04] again see you in heaven it's not about
[57:06] that
[57:07] you're becoming something god is doing
[57:11] a work in our lives and you need to
[57:14] remember that
[57:16] lest you get wearied unless this
[57:19] draining age and the trials that we face
[57:22] and the disappointments and and we do
[57:25] feel worried
[57:26] we do this is an age and brother branham

[57:43] mask
[57:44] and i want to tell you something friends
[57:46] covid has taken something from us
[57:51] now i'm coming to my burden we have
[57:54] fought this thing as a nation and as a
[57:57] global
[57:58] population probably you know almost the
[58:02] entire year
[58:04] probably solidly the last nine to ten
[58:07] months and it has
[58:09] and we've had you know it's caused
[58:12] church
[58:12] services to be limited fellowship to be
[58:15] limited
[58:16] everything's strained everything's
[58:18] limited everything's hindered
[58:19] we can't we don't that that freedom we
[58:22] used to have you know
[58:23] we a lot of times we took it for granted
[58:26] and now we're always we're under always
[58:28] thinking about i got to do this there's
[58:30] i just would i just like to go and have
[58:32] a day where i could just go and be free
[58:34] and not have to worry about it
[58:36] and and it has taken something from us
[58:39] as a church listen bethel tabernacle i'm
[58:40] going to tell you it's taken something
[58:42] from us as a church

[58:53] i i have a word for you tonight
[58:56] and that is that the grace of god in his
[58:59] word
[59:00] not only can restore it it's here to
[59:03] restore it
[59:04] and i suppose i could almost just stop
[59:07] preaching right there on that one
[59:08] thought
[59:09] and just say don't fear little flock
[59:11] it's the lord's pleasure to give you the
[59:13] kingdom

[59:16] anointing here

[59:27] up and be rugged
[59:30] amen not to be whiny not to be
[59:34] prickly and sticky and and our and our
[59:37] fellowship is hindered and our church
[59:38] serves are hindered
[59:39] and and i and i have had to to stand
[59:42] back
[59:42] and through sadness see the spiritual
[59:47] toll that it has taken on many people
[59:51] many of my flock because just the very
[59:54] ability to come to church is hindered
[1:00:00] and some hardly can muster enough
[1:00:03] wherewithal to come at all

[1:01:20] that place that
[1:01:21] god saw me before there was ever
[1:01:24] stardust

[1:01:27] where i'm trying to get to and i'm here

[1:01:41] is bringing you to that you're already

[1:01:52] still here

[1:02:14] you know hear me out now don't anybody
[1:02:17] throw anything at me i'm
[1:02:18] about to make a statement
[1:02:24] there's a great many things god can't do
[1:02:29] say what's a that's anathema that's
[1:02:31] heresy that's blasphemy no it's not
[1:02:34] i'll have you agree with me in the next
[1:02:35] few minutes
[1:02:37] there's actually a lot of things god
[1:02:39] can't do say
[1:02:40] an all-powerful omniscient
[1:02:43] omnipresent god
[1:02:47] there's things he can't do there's quite
[1:02:49] a few
[1:02:51] amen there's a a nice number of things
[1:02:53] that god can't do
[1:02:56] you know the bible teaches us
[1:02:59] god can't be tempted amen
[1:03:04] you ever thought about that
[1:03:08] god can't be tempted you know
[1:03:11] it's it's amazing how the devil operates
[1:03:13] in this world i mean sometimes i think
[1:03:15] devil
[1:03:16] do you honestly do you really think
[1:03:20] that you can tempt god into
[1:03:24] acting irrational do you think you could
[1:03:27] just make him mad enough to where he'd
[1:03:28] just lose it
[1:03:31] you'd think you could just where god
[1:03:33] would just you know get so
[1:03:35] frustrated and i say to the devil do you
[1:03:38] do you honestly believe that
[1:03:42] that i could do something bad enough
[1:03:45] and you go tell on me and god gets so
[1:03:48] mad that he would kick me out of his
[1:03:49] family
[1:03:51] i got news for you satan god can't be
[1:03:53] tempted
[1:03:54] amen and it doesn't matter what you do
[1:03:58] i'll always be in his family i love that
[1:04:03] the devil cannot tempt god into making
[1:04:06] rash judgments or
[1:04:08] snap decisions and that's what satan
[1:04:10] anoints people to do
[1:04:12] that's what laodicea is all about
[1:04:14] irrational thinking
[1:04:15] rash snap shoot from the hip you know
[1:04:18] somebody blow a horn get out and shoot
[1:04:20] him dead
[1:04:22] you know irrational things and you know
[1:04:26] do things that don't make sense i've
[1:04:28] always said it it proves it's an evil
[1:04:29] spirit because it makes you do things
[1:04:31] that don't even make common sense
[1:04:33] and and but god is immune
[1:04:38] god is immune from the influence of
[1:04:41] laodicea

[1:06:01] if we were praying and god took them
[1:06:03] anyway
[1:06:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:06:08] you see friends we look at life all
[1:06:10] together different from this insane
[1:06:13] world
[1:06:15] the whole earth is terrified
[1:06:18] about a virus that has a mortality rate
[1:06:22] ranging anywhere from they're saying
[1:06:24] like
[1:06:25] and this is all the latest as of today
[1:06:27] i've looked it up fresh
[1:06:29] and it and it ranges the best best
[1:06:31] science
[1:06:32] from the world health organization says
[1:06:34] if it's a
[1:06:35] infant up to like a year or two old it's
[1:06:39] like a 0.0001
[1:06:43] mortality rate if it's a five-year-old
[1:06:46] and then if it moves up to a
[1:06:48] ten-year-old and by a ten-year-old i
[1:06:49] think it becomes a 0.01
[1:06:53] and then if it's a 25 year old then it's
[1:06:55] like you know one point something
[1:06:57] and then if it's a 30 you know and it
[1:06:59] just keeps and by the time you get to 85
[1:07:01] and above 85 years old
[1:07:03] it ranges from 0.0001
[1:07:07] all the way up to 15 depending on your
[1:07:10] age
[1:07:11] and even at even at 85 and above
[1:07:14] the mortality rate averaging globally is
[1:07:18] about 15
[1:07:19] and the whole world is locked down in
[1:07:21] fear
[1:07:22] over a virus with a mortality rate of 15
[1:07:26] percent
[1:07:27] you say brother jason are you trying to
[1:07:29] diminish it no
[1:07:30] i'm trying to give you a comparison
[1:07:32] isn't it amazing
[1:07:34] that the world is running with fear and
[1:07:36] they're passing laws and politics and
[1:07:38] courts and judges and politicians and
[1:07:39] presidents and premiers
[1:07:40] and kings and queens and they're making
[1:07:42] all these decisions when you've got a
[1:07:44] mortality rate ranging from less than
[1:07:46] one up to 15
[1:07:47] when when the virus of sin has a hundred
[1:07:51] percent
[1:07:52] mortality rate
[1:07:56] the virus of sin has a 100 percent
[1:08:01] mortality rate and there is no human
[1:08:04] vaccine
[1:08:05] against it you cannot save yourself you
[1:08:09] cannot heal yourself
[1:08:10] sin is going to take you out it's it's
[1:08:13] sure that as soon as you're born you've
[1:08:15] got a death sentence on you
[1:08:17] the the virus of sin that satan tricked
[1:08:20] eve with in the garden of eden
[1:08:21] is here today and the world is running
[1:08:24] crazy
[1:08:27] over a 001 to 15
[1:08:31] and they have no concern at all
[1:08:35] about 100 mortality
[1:08:39] they seem completely unconcerned
[1:08:47] well imagine that a god who can't be
[1:08:50] tempted
[1:08:52] imagine being able to be immune
[1:08:56] from temptation and all
[1:08:59] the vices of laodicea
[1:09:02] immune from the insanity that
[1:09:06] mankind is descending into

[1:09:22] the descending insanity

[1:10:40] valuable in life to been to be able to
[1:10:42] say that
[1:10:44] there's a lot of things god can't do he
[1:10:46] can't be tempted you know what else he
[1:10:47] can't do
[1:10:49] he can't be defeated
[1:10:54] is there a risk is there a risk satan

[1:11:24] amen that's the god you're serving
[1:11:28] tonight
[1:11:29] a god who is immune from the irrational
[1:11:32] temptations of the world

[1:11:37] matter what they do in politics it
[1:11:38] doesn't matter what rome does

[1:11:44] our god cannot be defeated
[1:11:51] you know what else he can't do he can't
[1:11:53] lie
[1:11:55] amen i thought to myself when i wrote
[1:11:58] that down i thought to myself is there
[1:12:00] anything more comforting in the world
[1:12:04] a god that can't lie
[1:12:07] is there anything that you can think of
[1:12:09] more comforting
[1:12:11] than than the then the inability to lie
[1:12:15] in a world where lying is the norm
[1:12:20] lying is the norm it's so
[1:12:24] the norm that the politicians on both
[1:12:27] sides admit we do it
[1:12:29] we do it to get elected
[1:12:32] they even are unabashedly shamelessly
[1:12:35] admit that
[1:12:37] you know and they ask one you know you
[1:12:39] said this in the primary debate
[1:12:41] and you know what the answer is that was
[1:12:43] just a debate
[1:12:46] okay that's what my point is you you
[1:12:47] said this in the debate yeah but it was
[1:12:49] just a debate
[1:12:50] like in other words it didn't matter it
[1:12:52] didn't count i'm thinking
[1:12:53] why do we have it then if it doesn't
[1:12:56] matter it doesn't count why even bother
[1:12:58] with it
[1:12:59] where everyone seems to have an agenda
[1:13:04] and and and and that's in the world we
[1:13:07] live in everybody's got an
[1:13:08] agenda and i'm here to tell you that
[1:13:12] you're serving a god
[1:13:13] who's always honest and never lies
[1:13:16] never is deceitful never deceives
[1:13:20] and in a world where everyone
[1:13:23] has an agenda and every move and i don't
[1:13:26] care how
[1:13:27] how good the move might look there's
[1:13:30] always a rub or a caveat or a
[1:13:33] however it you never get it
[1:13:36] you know how about a friend who'll just
[1:13:38] tell you the truth
[1:13:41] how many want that in your life and just
[1:13:43] say the whole truth
[1:13:45] and nothing but the truth if it's good
[1:13:47] news i want it
[1:13:48] if it's bad news i want it if it hurts
[1:13:50] me i want it
[1:13:52] if it helps me i want it whatever it is
[1:13:54] i want the truth
[1:13:57] and it's so hard to find this is the
[1:13:59] kind of word
[1:14:02] that i want to live by
[1:14:06] the whole truth nothing but the truth no
[1:14:10] buts no doubts no conditions
[1:14:14] just truth
[1:14:17] in case you don't think that's important
[1:14:20] let me tell you your life
[1:14:24] depends on it
[1:14:28] billions of people are going to perish
[1:14:32] because they're believing a lie
[1:14:38] and here you have the truth
[1:14:42] and you have the truther
[1:14:46] i just invent a word god is the ultimate
[1:14:49] truther amen
[1:14:54] your family's lives depend on it
[1:14:56] everything you love
[1:14:59] everything you love depends on
[1:15:02] you hearing the truth and believing
[1:15:06] the truth think of everything that's
[1:15:09] dear to you
[1:15:10] if you don't have the truth you can't
[1:15:12] save you
[1:15:13] and you can't save them
[1:15:17] now how valuable is it to you that we
[1:15:20] have a god
[1:15:21] who's here in his word who cannot lie
[1:15:25] you know what else god can't do oh
[1:15:28] there's a bunch more things he can't do
[1:15:31] he can't break a promise
[1:15:35] now that's different than lying because
[1:15:37] you know lying requires an intent to
[1:15:39] deceive you can't accidentally lie
[1:15:42] so you can't accidentally lie because to
[1:15:45] lie
[1:15:46] it requires an intent to deceive or
[1:15:48] mislead that's why guile is the same
[1:15:50] thing
[1:15:51] and so guile is just where you tell just
[1:15:53] enough truth to mislead someone
[1:15:55] and so it's still a lie brother branham
[1:15:57] used goll and called it a lie
[1:15:59] see and and so you you find that
[1:16:03] you know the whole world is
[1:16:06] with their agenda always telling things
[1:16:09] in order just enough to telling you just
[1:16:12] enough truth
[1:16:13] selling you on just enough of the truth
[1:16:16] having no it
[1:16:17] knowing that you're never going to get
[1:16:18] the payoff
[1:16:20] and so i want to offer you someone
[1:16:24] tonight
[1:16:25] to control your life i got a deal you
[1:16:28] can't refuse
[1:16:30] i want to introduce you tonight church
[1:16:33] to
[1:16:34] someone who was willing to control your
[1:16:37] life
[1:16:38] if you let him who never
[1:16:41] breaks a promise ever
[1:16:45] amen you'll never have to worry
[1:16:49] about a disappointment you can wake up
[1:16:52] in the morning
[1:16:53] without suspicion you can go forward
[1:16:56] through the day without looking you can
[1:16:59] fall asleep at night
[1:17:00] without checking this is a dependable
[1:17:05] faithful truthful can't be defeated
[1:17:09] can't be tempted god in his word
[1:17:13] and it's offered to us tonight how many
[1:17:16] takers
[1:17:17] do i got who'll say i'll take that
[1:17:20] one who can't be tempted who can't lie
[1:17:22] who can't break a promise
[1:17:24] who can't be defeated you know what else
[1:17:26] he can't do
[1:17:27] he can't fail hallelujah
[1:17:31] well you know when you can laugh and
[1:17:33] brother branham said if your faith is
[1:17:35] right and you're sitting in the doctor's
[1:17:36] office
[1:17:36] and he says you got three months to live
[1:17:38] you can laugh in his face
[1:17:42] it's not disrespect to the doctor who
[1:17:44] you appreciate
[1:17:45] it's just that it doesn't matter because
[1:17:48] if god wants to take me home
[1:17:50] fine but the devil sure ain't gonna take
[1:17:53] me out because by his stripes
[1:17:55] i'm already healed
[1:17:59] think about it friends imagine when you
[1:18:01] can laugh in the face of your enemy
[1:18:03] no matter what it is every challenge any
[1:18:06] adversity
[1:18:07] when an enemy when an enemy jumps in
[1:18:10] your face
[1:18:10] and says i'm going to destroy you and
[1:18:12] i'll give you three minutes to surrender
[1:18:15] and you look right back at him and say
[1:18:16] you're gonna give me three minutes yes
[1:18:18] i don't require one
[1:18:21] i don't need 30 seconds to make up my
[1:18:24] mind i don't believe you
[1:18:26] i believe him hallelujah
[1:18:29] take your best shot devil because i
[1:18:31] don't care
[1:18:33] i don't care i've already been sold out
[1:18:35] to the word of god
[1:18:36] and there is no weapon formed against me
[1:18:38] that can prosper
[1:18:40] hallelujah we look at it completely
[1:18:45] different
[1:18:45] in different ways from the world
[1:18:48] the world is fighting flesh and blood
[1:18:51] i'm not here fighting flesh and blood
[1:18:53] i'm conquering devils that's the real
[1:18:55] enemy
[1:18:57] flesh and blood's not your real enemy
[1:18:59] devils are your real enemy
[1:19:03] you know what else he can't do i got to
[1:19:05] hurry i got so many things god can't do
[1:19:07] it might take me a little bit you good
[1:19:10] give me another give me another seven or
[1:19:11] eight minutes
[1:19:14] i like this one he can't
[1:19:17] change his mind about his word amen
[1:19:22] all i have to do is see how he acted in
[1:19:26] the past
[1:19:27] and i don't need him to tell me the
[1:19:29] future
[1:19:32] i don't need him to tell me the future
[1:19:33] all i got to do is see how he acted in
[1:19:35] the past
[1:19:36] and when i get into the future i'll
[1:19:38] already know what he's going to do
[1:19:41] why because he can never change his mind
[1:19:45] about his word because that's true
[1:19:48] i don't need him to explain every little
[1:19:50] thing that happens to me in my life
[1:19:53] i don't need him to do that i'm not the
[1:19:55] first child of god to encounter trials
[1:19:58] i'm not the first child of god to have
[1:20:00] failures i won't be the last one
[1:20:02] say listen friends satan is going to
[1:20:05] fight until he's destroyed
[1:20:08] just own that get over it satan is going
[1:20:10] to fight until he's destroyed
[1:20:13] so don't ever think well he's going to
[1:20:15] take a holiday he's not going to take a
[1:20:16] holiday
[1:20:17] i'm here to tell you something he's
[1:20:18] increasing his efforts he's like a
[1:20:20] roaring lion because he knows he only
[1:20:22] has a little while
[1:20:23] and so if i got to fight him well then
[1:20:25] let's fight him with faith let's fight
[1:20:27] him without fear
[1:20:28] let's believe a god who can't change his
[1:20:31] mind
[1:20:36] i'm glad that i can say with all
[1:20:40] sincerity that the devil
[1:20:43] does not matter
[1:20:47] anything he does is allowed and nothing
[1:20:50] he does is permanent
[1:20:53] not even death his greatest weapon
[1:20:57] his greatest weapon imagine how sad it
[1:20:58] must be to be the devil
[1:21:00] that his greatest weapon has no effect
[1:21:02] on god's family amen
[1:21:04] amen see it doesn't even matter jesus
[1:21:07] said if you believe on me you'll never
[1:21:09] die
[1:21:10] ever and that a beautiful promise

[1:21:24] to go to the lord's supper
[1:21:27] here's something he can't do
[1:21:30] he can't remember sin cast into his sea
[1:21:33] glory
[1:21:37] i thought you might like that when i
[1:21:38] saved the best one for last
[1:21:40] he can't be tempted he can't be defeated
[1:21:43] he can't lie
[1:21:44] he can't break a promise he can't change
[1:21:46] his mind about his word
[1:21:48] but the to me the most beautiful thing
[1:21:51] is
[1:21:51] he can't remember sin cast in to his sea

[1:23:20] the middle of satan's eden in the middle
[1:23:22] of a world falling apart
[1:23:23] he could look at a bride and go shalom
[1:23:27] brother branham i thought you said the
[1:23:28] world's falling apart well it is and
[1:23:30] actually i preached it twice it's again
[1:23:31] falling apart
[1:23:32] so what what should i do rest little
[1:23:34] bride
[1:23:36] all is well but it's satan's eden
[1:23:39] right just rest but he's the god of this
[1:23:41] evil age
[1:23:42] shalom good morning yes it's a dark day
[1:23:46] for the world but arise shine light
[1:23:48] light has come
[1:23:50] oh my do you understand friends we're
[1:23:52] fighting an enemy
[1:23:54] that's totally defeated an
[1:23:57] enemy that it's already too late for
[1:24:01] i love saying that to him satan the
[1:24:04] truth is it's
[1:24:04] actually already too late fight on
[1:24:08] i'm just telling you it's already too
[1:24:11] late
[1:24:12] you've actually already passed the
[1:24:13] opportunity to beat me and you'll never
[1:24:15] get it again
[1:24:18] because why i serve a god who can't
[1:24:21] be defeated
[1:24:24] so jesus took bread and he blessed it
[1:24:29] and he broke it and he gave to his
[1:24:31] disciples
[1:24:33] and said take heat this is my body
[1:24:37] and he took the cup and he gave thanks
[1:24:40] and gave it to them saying drink ye all
[1:24:44] of it now
[1:24:45] can you imagine in that cup
[1:24:48] was going to be his blood in the new
[1:24:50] testament he
[1:24:52] knew what that blood meant for him in
[1:24:55] just a few hours
[1:24:56] and when he takes it and knows what it
[1:24:58] means the bible said he gave thanks
[1:25:03] he gave thanks can you understand
[1:25:05] friends
[1:25:06] can you just say tonight it doesn't
[1:25:08] matter what happens to the world or what
[1:25:10] the devil does
[1:25:11] i'm going to give thanks to god for
[1:25:13] everything
[1:25:14] of his love and his grace in
[1:25:17] my life for this is my blood in the new
[1:25:20] testament
[1:25:22] take this friends this is a medicine you
[1:25:24] ready for a bat you ready for a vaccine
[1:25:26] this is my blood in the new testament
[1:25:29] which is
[1:25:29] shed for many for the remission of sins
[1:25:33] but i say unto you i will not drink
[1:25:36] henceforth
[1:25:37] of this fruit of the vine until that day
[1:25:42] when i drink it new with you
[1:25:45] in my father's kingdom
[1:25:49] so jesus went away corporally
[1:25:52] but he returned in spirit
[1:25:55] to live in us and
[1:25:58] and and and you know just just like
[1:26:02] just like you know the world can't see
[1:26:03] that and and that's fine because that's
[1:26:05] just like we were saying
[1:26:07] as brother branham said you know about
[1:26:08] sister bell he said
[1:26:10] sister bell is asleep to us but awake to
[1:26:13] god
[1:26:14] see sister seal brother eddie all of
[1:26:16] them they're asleep
[1:26:18] to us but they're awake to god amen
[1:26:21] and so they're awake we can't see them
[1:26:25] but they're awake
[1:26:26] and god is in you the world can't see it
[1:26:28] but he's alive
[1:26:30] and he lives inside me he's in me
[1:26:34] he's with me all the way to the end
[1:26:37] he said i'm going away
[1:26:41] you keep doing this till i come back
[1:26:45] and when i have this meal with you again
[1:26:49] we'll be home forever
[1:26:53] you keep doing this i'm going away
[1:26:58] you keep doing this till i get back
[1:27:01] and when i have this meal with you again
[1:27:03] we'll be home
[1:27:04] we'll be home we'll be home ain't that

[1:49:13] lord there's nothing we could pray
[1:49:17] greater than that consume me lord
[1:49:22] let the fires of god consume everything
[1:49:25] contrary
[1:49:27] so that when it's done with its
[1:49:29] cleansing there's nothing
[1:49:30] left standing but an image of your word
[1:49:35] every element of the world in our minds
[1:49:38] and our hearts our souls
[1:49:40] driven from us lord consumed by the
[1:49:44] fires of god
[1:49:46] so that we stand pure clean
[1:49:50] holy worthy under the blood of christ
[1:49:55] usable by the holy spirit it's what we
[1:49:59] want lord
[1:50:00] i don't want to just pass my my time
[1:50:03] here in life
[1:50:06] without a purpose
[1:50:10] but i realized lord that
[1:50:13] the plain truth is no matter how bad we
[1:50:17] want it
[1:50:18] you require dedication you require
[1:50:22] consecration you won't you won't operate
[1:50:25] so freely
[1:50:26] in someone who's not it doesn't take
[1:50:29] away the gene of god it doesn't take
