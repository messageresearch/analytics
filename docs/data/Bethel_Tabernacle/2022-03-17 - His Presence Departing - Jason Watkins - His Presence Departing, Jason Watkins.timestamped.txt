[39:26] catch that service i got to a few
[39:28] minutes pass for the mass
[39:30] text
[39:31] and haven't been able to figure out
[39:34] finish it up she was rejoicing
[39:36] reports so
[39:37] i started to finish it today
[40:01] ukrainian refugees
[40:03] and uh brother barry has a lot of
[40:05] testimonies and video already
[40:08] from the believers
[40:22] you know men women and one sister at
[40:25] home with four small children and moms
[40:28] are falling and
[40:29] she's just happy and content in the lord
[40:31] not worried about a thing
[40:33] amen and one brother who escaped mary
[40:35] opal which is completely
[40:47] among god's family
[40:49] and uh you know they they see it
[40:52] uh
[40:53] as prophecy
[40:55] coming to pass don't you think they
[40:57] don't they're looking at what the lord
[40:59] said in the book of revelation and
[41:01] they're seeing that that what's
[41:02] happening in real time i'm telling you
[41:04] friends things are wrapping up quickly
[41:07] amen and i i've just been astonished
[41:10] really
[41:11] for there's no better word i could use
[41:13] just astonished
[41:15] at uh the unprecedented things that are
[41:18] happening headlines that i read about
[41:21] the world and the power of the beast
[41:22] moving behind the scenes
[41:24] my my my our home going is soon
[41:27] amen and so
[41:29] i want you to turn with me this evening
[41:32] uh to the book of ezekiel
[41:34] and we're going to
[41:37] look from chapter
[41:39] 9 i think i gave in
[41:41] and
[41:42] so we want to go there
[41:45] and catch our thought for this evening
[41:47] ezekiel is a an amazing prophetic book
[41:50] hinged in between jeremiah and daniel
[41:52] all three of those men
[41:54] uh
[41:55] contemporaries
[41:57] and
[41:57] you know
[41:59] watching things take place
[42:01] jeremiah there in
[42:03] jerusalem and warning them about the
[42:05] babylonian invasion and
[42:08] and then jeremiah finally gets sent to
[42:10] egypt as an old man he doesn't actually
[42:12] go into captivity dies and actually dies
[42:14] in egypt and so
[42:16] uh ezekiel caught the vision that we're
[42:19] going to read tonight about the
[42:20] departing of the glory of the lord
[42:22] and then of course you're familiar with
[42:24] daniel he's actually there in babylon
[42:26] during the
[42:27] um
[42:28] during the uh captivity seventies
[42:31] captivity so it's a lot of activity
[42:34] moving that's all relevant uh to us
[42:37] today amen so let's look in our bibles
[42:40] to
[42:41] um this screen here under this thing
[42:45] does
[42:46] does this power it
[42:50] um
[42:52] this one here i want to turn that off is
[42:55] what i want
[42:56] is that right okay i don't need this one
[42:58] then
[43:00] ah some fiend has stolen my remote
[43:04] uh
[43:09] okay you know i
[43:11] you're right about that and uh i think i
[43:14] may have found it
[43:15] yeah i think i got it praise the lord
[43:18] die
[43:20] like flashing at me like here i am no
[43:22] i'm not
[43:23] high no fine
[43:25] so it's very distracting
[43:27] amen ezekiel
[43:29] chapter 9
[43:31] and i want by the help of the lord
[43:34] uh to you to speak to you on a
[43:37] sermon that i didn't
[43:38] derive my title until late in the
[43:40] afternoon just trying to find the exact
[43:42] mind of the lord
[43:44] i want to speak on his presence
[43:46] departing
[43:48] ezekiel 9 verse 1
[43:52] and we're kind of jumping into the
[43:54] middle of the vision it's actually
[43:56] beginning 8 goes through 9 goes through
[43:58] 10 goes to 11. i'm just decided to pick
[44:01] this one spot and then we'll make
[44:02] references back and forth it's not going
[44:04] to be an exhaustive bible study lesson
[44:06] tonight i just want to reference it
[44:08] somewhat
[44:10] he cried also in mine ears with a loud
[44:12] voice saying
[44:14] calls them that have charge over the
[44:16] city to draw near every man
[44:18] with his destroying weapon in his hand
[44:23] and behold six men came from the way
[44:26] of the higher gate which lath toward the
[44:29] north and every man a slaughter weapon
[44:31] in his hand
[44:32] and one man among them
[44:34] was clothed with linen
[44:36] with a writer's ink horn by his side
[44:39] and they went in and stood beside the
[44:42] brazen altar
[44:43] so this one in lenin with the ink horn
[44:47] is going to put a mark and so we're
[44:49] seeing types of the holy spirit coming
[44:51] here a seal
[44:53] who's the only one who can seal is the
[44:55] presence of god and the glory of god of
[44:58] israel
[44:59] was gone up from the cherub but read
[45:01] that again verse three and the glory of
[45:04] god of the god of israel was gone up
[45:07] from the cherub where upon he was
[45:10] to the threshold of the house
[45:13] and he called to the man clothed with
[45:15] linen which had the writers writer's
[45:17] incorn by his side
[45:19] and the lord said unto him go through
[45:21] the midst of the city
[45:23] through the midst of jerusalem and set a
[45:25] mark upon the foreheads of the men that
[45:28] sigh and cry for the abominations that
[45:32] be done in the midst thereof
[45:35] and to the others he said in mine
[45:37] hearing
[45:38] go ye after him through the city and
[45:40] smite let not your eyes spare neither
[45:44] have you pity slay utterly old and young
[45:48] both maids and little children and women
[45:50] but come not near any man upon whom is
[45:54] the mark and begin at my sanctuary then
[45:58] they begin
[45:59] at the at the ancient men which were
[46:02] before the house
[46:04] and he said unto them defile the house
[46:07] and fill the courts with the slain go
[46:10] you forth and they went forth and slew
[46:12] in the city and it came to pass while
[46:15] they were slaying them and i was left
[46:18] that i fell upon my face and cried and
[46:21] said
[46:22] ah lord god will thou destroy all the
[46:25] residue of israel
[46:26] and thy pouring out of thy fury
[46:29] upon jerusalem
[46:31] so
[46:33] ezekiel is seeing
[46:35] this vision of the impending doom when
[46:38] the babylonians come in this is what
[46:41] they're going to do see
[46:42] and so he says here in verse 9
[46:45] then said he unto me
[46:47] the iniquity of the house of israel in
[46:49] judah is exceeding great and the land is
[46:53] full of blood and the city full of
[46:56] perverseness for they say
[46:59] the lord hath forsaken the earth and the
[47:02] lord seeth not
[47:03] and as for me also mine i shall not
[47:06] spare neither will i have pity but i
[47:09] will recompense their way upon their
[47:12] head and behold the man with linen which
[47:16] had the incorn by his side reported the
[47:18] matter saying
[47:20] i have done as thou has commanded me
[47:23] let's pray
[47:25] master of foreboding
[47:27] passage of scripture lord and
[47:30] we we feel the weight lord of what it is
[47:33] showing us and father we know of course
[47:36] that
[47:37] i'm thankful to you that
[47:39] lord of the the
[47:42] the enemy was going to come in
[47:44] the enemy was going to invade the nation
[47:46] because it had been
[47:48] exceedingly sinful
[47:50] and the enemy was going to slay
[47:53] young men old men maidens children
[47:56] everybody and lord it was really be the
[48:00] devil's children slaying the devil's
[48:02] children because you put a mark upon all
[48:05] of your children and none was allowed to
[48:08] hurt them
[48:09] father we're we're realizing that this
[48:12] is not the passage this is not a passage
[48:14] that speaks of some evil bloodthirsty
[48:17] god this is just simply a god allowing
[48:20] man turning man over to his own devices
[48:23] and allowing him lord to destroy his own
[48:27] self but you saved your children out of
[48:29] it lord you saved anyone you saved
[48:32] everyone who was who was righteous who
[48:35] was holy who loved you who loved your
[48:38] word lord and who were burdened by the
[48:41] sin that they saw in the nation those
[48:44] were your family lord and you let no
[48:46] harm come to them and so father we're
[48:49] asking you tonight now speak to us in
[48:52] the depths of our heart we commit it to
[48:54] you in jesus name amen god bless you
[48:57] friends you can be seated
[49:17] given what an advantage it is
[49:21] to have the presence of god the personal
[49:24] presence of god
[49:26] operating in your life
[49:28] operating in your home operating in this
[49:30] church operating in your children
[49:32] operating in your business given the
[49:34] advantage that it is
[49:36] for god to be present and all of the
[49:39] aspects of our lives
[49:41] you would think that every mortal man
[49:44] ever whoever lived would covet and crave
[49:49] and go to great extremes and do frankly
[49:52] whatever he had to do to be sure that a
[49:56] god that great was in his home and in
[49:59] his life and in his children and in his
[50:01] business and yet we find
[50:04] uh paradoxically
[50:06] the exact opposite of that we find and
[50:09] it's not just today in the hour that we
[50:12] live in it is inarguable historically
[50:15] that mankind around the world all over
[50:18] the world have in the majority in fact
[50:21] is it has always been the overwhelming
[50:24] majority that man just seems to
[50:26] determine
[50:27] to to rid god of controlling his life
[50:30] and take over his own life and and it
[50:33] seems like that
[50:35] that you know men get to the point and
[50:38] it doesn't come
[50:40] suddenly you know when when the garden
[50:43] of eden uh happened that event and
[50:46] here's adam and eve out and then here's
[50:48] abel with a sacrifice and and and it
[50:51] didn't take very long though it didn't
[50:53] happen on day one but eventually
[50:56] cain kills his brother and then god
[50:59] raises up seth and then
[51:01] populations start going and they start
[51:03] talking about building cities and and
[51:05] raising sheep and you've got seth's
[51:08] children who become uh simple people and
[51:11] herdsmen and
[51:12] and and farmers and raising livestock
[51:15] and you find that the children of cain
[51:17] went after knowledge and science and
[51:20] built great cities and and and went
[51:22] after all sorts of things from the tree
[51:24] of knowledge of good and evil and for a
[51:26] while everybody got along for a while
[51:29] there was no more body getting killed
[51:32] everybody saw what happened to cain he
[51:34] had a mark he was well known don't
[51:36] anybody do what he did and that went on
[51:39] for quite a while until finally a man
[51:42] rose up and said you know i'm just not
[51:44] going to do that anymore and he went out
[51:46] and killed seven men
[51:49] and so so we find that right away by the
[51:52] time you go from that sad verse
[51:56] and by the time you get to the days of
[51:59] noah
[52:00] that
[52:01] that first man who who killed the first
[52:04] humans after cain did after that uh the
[52:07] time of peace in the earth then you find
[52:10] that by the time it gets to noah just
[52:12] seven generations after enoch we come to
[52:15] noah and we find out that by that time
[52:18] the whole earth is covered in
[52:22] ungodliness
[52:23] it's become global and the bible says in
[52:27] fact is that except for eight humans
[52:31] the entire world's minds were con evil
[52:36] continuously
[52:37] and
[52:38] perversion was rampant and imagine that
[52:41] that it didn't happen overnight but over
[52:44] a space of time you find and god just
[52:46] finally says
[52:48] that's it i'm going to allow
[52:51] man i'm going to pull out the stops i'll
[52:53] pull out the chucks from the wheels and
[52:54] let the wagon roll over the cliff and
[52:56] that's exactly what happened it was
[52:58] nuclear uh it was an atomic blast that
[53:01] went off in that scientific age and
[53:03] rocked the earth off its axis and and
[53:06] broke up the uh the underground rivers
[53:08] and and shattered the firmament above
[53:11] and flooded the world and man destroyed
[53:13] himself but god preserved his family
[53:16] hallelujah and then we find that it came
[53:19] out a little ways and after a while
[53:21] everything was fine uh it didn't happen
[53:23] on day one or it didn't happen it
[53:25] doesn't really tell us when but it talks
[53:27] about by and by over time noah decides
[53:30] to build a a vineyard and the next thing
[53:33] you know he hits an alcoholic problem
[53:35] and then the next thing you know sin is
[53:37] starting to spread and then the next
[53:39] thing you know
[53:40] you're going to find that they're down
[53:41] in the valley of shinar building attack
[53:43] building a tower and you've got nimrod
[53:46] carrying war to the to his neighbors and
[53:48] and suddenly here we go again and it
[53:51] didn't happen suddenly
[53:53] it just seemed like that that there was
[53:55] a presence of uh uh in in the memories
[53:59] of the earthlings there was a memory of
[54:02] of what god does when when we go in that
[54:05] direction he he he's not some cruel
[54:09] bloodthirsty ogre
[54:12] he he doesn't even want anybody to die
[54:15] in fact as he goes out of his way to try
[54:17] to persuade everybody he won't force him
[54:22] mankind wouldn't want to be forced
[54:25] say why why does god allow all the wars
[54:27] and babies to die and sin to be in the
[54:29] earth because he won't force man to
[54:30] serve him
[54:31] and remember that when god built the
[54:33] earth there wasn't no sickness no babies
[54:35] died there was no war it was man that
[54:37] did that
[54:38] it's man that has done it every time god
[54:40] recycled and they started it again not
[54:42] immediately but after a while by and by
[54:46] it just got worse and every generation
[54:48] got worse until finally god recycled it
[54:51] again and so so we find then that we
[54:53] arrive to a time where god is going to
[54:56] say okay i i'm not going to destroy the
[54:59] earth by water again i promised him i
[55:01] wouldn't do that so here's what i'm
[55:02] going to do i'm going to reach down and
[55:04] find me a man and i'm gonna give him a
[55:07] call and i'm gonna call his name his
[55:09] name is abram and i'm gonna call him and
[55:11] he's gonna believe my word and i'm gonna
[55:13] start with him and i'm gonna craft a
[55:16] righteous nation to show the world uh
[55:19] who the real true god is and it went
[55:21] fine for a while abraham had isaac and
[55:25] isaac had jacob and then they went on
[55:26] and on and on and the history comes all
[55:28] the way to the fact that you finally end
[55:30] up you know with the children of israel
[55:33] down in in egypt and then god brings
[55:35] them out and then they wander through
[55:37] wilderness and they go into a promised
[55:38] land then they take it and for a while
[55:41] everything's going fine until joshua
[55:44] dies and then things start slipping and
[55:46] the next thing you know there's judges
[55:48] coming and you've got all the story of
[55:50] the judges and then finally god's gonna
[55:52] and i'm just making millennial leaps
[55:54] here god's gonna finally bring him a
[55:56] king and he's gonna have and they they
[55:59] pick a bad one a real doozy and he self
[56:02] you know enamored with himself and stuck
[56:04] on himself and and became rebellious and
[56:07] became the enemy of god god ended up
[56:09] saving him because god loved saul he was
[56:12] god's son and he he finally took him off
[56:14] the earth like he will any disobedient
[56:16] son who he loves
[56:17] he set up david and everything looked
[56:19] good and then as if it couldn't get any
[56:21] better solomon comes and it gets even
[56:24] better and so that all the nations
[56:26] around israel are put under under under
[56:29] tribute solomon everybody's afraid of
[56:32] him he's got a gift of discernment he
[56:34] can discern the secrets of the heart
[56:35] he's his his fame is global his army
[56:39] they're terrified of the israeli army
[56:42] and we find that for a while it looked
[56:44] like a millennium
[56:47] but by and by
[56:49] solomon begins to backslide the now now
[56:53] look at what happened israel's starting
[56:54] to go
[56:55] there's going to be a problem and god
[56:57] starts sending prophets you need to
[56:59] repent this is going to be a problem
[57:01] this ain't going to end well and they
[57:03] they you know they abuse the prophets
[57:05] and they kill them and jesus told him
[57:07] said which one of the prophets did your
[57:09] fathers not slay and put to death tell
[57:11] me which one that that designation you
[57:14] ever listen to you're so proud of your
[57:15] prophets and you tried to kill every one
[57:17] of them and killed almost all of them
[57:19] and and so we find out that that you
[57:21] know he said you you you think you you
[57:24] look the scriptures you think in them
[57:26] you have life i am literally here
[57:28] proving that i'm the reality of
[57:30] everything and you're trying to kill me
[57:33] amen
[57:34] and so so you find that that they you
[57:37] know from the time of solomon it didn't
[57:39] happen right off the bat but a little
[57:41] after a while a little more a little
[57:43] more after a little more until finally
[57:45] it gets to the point where we're kings
[57:48] down many kings in uh the ten tribes
[57:51] have already been taken uh but you know
[57:53] and and and the next thing you know uh
[57:55] by the assyrians and then you've got two
[57:57] tribes left and then they're going to be
[57:59] sacked by babylon and and all and you
[58:01] know that whole story how that goes and
[58:03] they're going into seven years captivity
[58:06] and so we find then that
[58:09] you know leading up to this
[58:11] god sends this prophet jeremiah
[58:14] and he's trying to plead with them to
[58:16] say listen
[58:17] this is really mission critical
[58:20] this is serious
[58:22] that you know we were a great nation and
[58:25] all we've done is follow the pattern
[58:27] since the days of genesis where it goes
[58:29] good for a while god comes down does
[58:31] great miracles in our life we have the
[58:33] power of god we have a great king we
[58:35] have a great army we're whipping
[58:36] everybody god grows our crops heals our
[58:39] land gives us money gives us food makes
[58:42] us the leading nation we don't owe
[58:44] anybody any debt everybody owes us debt
[58:48] but by and by by and by it just kept
[58:51] getting a little worse and a little
[58:53] worse until jeremiah now jeremiah's
[58:54] pleading and saying listen you don't
[58:56] seem to understand this isn't going to
[58:58] end well
[59:00] you you're going to keep going in that
[59:01] direction you're going what direction
[59:03] are we going jeremiah away from the
[59:05] glory of the lord
[59:08] you're literally turning away from the
[59:10] glory of the lord your life should
[59:13] glorify god this nation should glorify
[59:16] god your church should glorify god the
[59:19] preachers should glorify god the people
[59:20] should glorify god the young people
[59:22] should glorify god
[59:24] marriages should glorify god and you're
[59:26] starting to get away from it you're
[59:28] starting to get away from it and you're
[59:29] starting to add glamour instead of glory
[59:31] you're starting to add the world instead
[59:33] of the word and well what's going to be
[59:35] the consequence it ain't going to end
[59:36] well
[59:38] because finally what's going to happen
[59:40] the lord will begin to depart and he the
[59:42] thing about it is he doesn't do it
[59:44] suddenly
[59:47] he doesn't do it suddenly
[59:50] he does it in phases
[59:52] because he's merciful
[59:54] and he cries out to his people
[59:57] and by the time ezekiel
[59:59] sees his prophecy
[1:00:01] here he is you know and i
[1:00:03] he's brought by a vision and god shows
[1:00:05] him and takes him to the temple
[1:00:08] and he sees and god is not gonna
[1:00:11] god's gonna actually he doesn't have to
[1:00:12] do it just but just out of
[1:00:15] out of a determination to
[1:00:17] to make his to make sure that no one
[1:00:19] tries to impugn him
[1:00:21] he's going to begin to show that listen
[1:00:24] ezekiel i'm going to show you i'm going
[1:00:26] to take you to the inner court i'm going
[1:00:27] to show you something i'm going to
[1:00:28] destroy this place why are you going to
[1:00:29] do it lord i'm going to show you come on
[1:00:31] come on with me i'm going to show you
[1:00:32] now you go home read chapter 8 chapter 9
[1:00:34] chapter 10 chapter 11. i'm just going to
[1:00:36] narrate it for you tonight because it's
[1:00:37] wednesday and i want to move quickly
[1:00:40] and he found them
[1:00:42] with idols right in the sanctuary
[1:00:45] and men there supposed to be in the
[1:00:47] house of god
[1:00:49] supposed to be message believers and got
[1:00:51] all kinds of idols in their lives that
[1:00:53] they're worshiping and they're bringing
[1:00:55] glory to their idols and they're not
[1:00:57] bringing glory to god
[1:00:59] and you find that what god does is that
[1:01:01] he
[1:01:02] he lifts up from the cherubs
[1:01:05] and where he was in the holy place
[1:01:07] between the cherubs and the glory of god
[1:01:10] lifts from there and moves now he
[1:01:13] doesn't he doesn't move oh he doesn't
[1:01:15] completely leave he just moves to the
[1:01:17] door
[1:01:18] and he says now let me show you
[1:01:20] something else jeremiah i mean ezekiel
[1:01:23] he shows it it shows his ego and he
[1:01:25] begins to show him this sin and that sin
[1:01:27] and this secret thing and that secret
[1:01:28] thing and then still nobody's repenting
[1:01:32] and instead of getting better they're
[1:01:35] getting worse
[1:01:36] and it seems like every generation gets
[1:01:39] worse and every year they get worse and
[1:01:42] the nation is going down but when the
[1:01:44] nation goes down that's when god's
[1:01:46] family is supposed to shine
[1:01:50] listen friends the perversions of
[1:01:52] laodicea the poison toxins of hollywood
[1:01:57] and sodom and the days of noah which we
[1:01:59] have a convergence both of them were
[1:02:02] being doubled with a double barrel of
[1:02:03] that
[1:02:05] i'm here to tell you that the world
[1:02:07] has long ago ejected god from their
[1:02:10] thinking and their churches no longer
[1:02:12] have him their politics have long ago
[1:02:14] not had him
[1:02:16] and they they they sit in their in their
[1:02:18] chambers and they they pass all these
[1:02:20] laws and i was reading today spurgeon
[1:02:23] was making just a side comment about it
[1:02:25] and he was almost like in a prayer and
[1:02:27] saying lord they sit and they pass laws
[1:02:30] with no regard for the creator who built
[1:02:33] the whole thing
[1:02:36] no regard at all we're here we're
[1:02:37] legislators we're not god's not involved
[1:02:39] in this really
[1:02:41] he built the earth you're standing on he
[1:02:43] he builds the air you're breathing he
[1:02:45] builds the bodies you're living in
[1:02:48] he did it for not your glory his glory
[1:02:51] what do you mean he has no say in our
[1:02:53] laws oh no no no no we're we're not
[1:02:56] we're not going to talk about god we're
[1:02:57] not going to talk about the bible you
[1:02:59] know we're there we're going to make
[1:03:01] laws as we see fit all right go ahead
[1:03:04] it ain't going to end well
[1:03:06] it's never ended well
[1:03:09] you find that finally
[1:03:12] you know the the lord moved and i
[1:03:14] and i and just off top my head i think
[1:03:17] his next movement was
[1:03:19] he first moved to the south to the south
[1:03:22] entrance
[1:03:23] and he stood there a little bit longer
[1:03:26] and god
[1:03:27] rich in mercy
[1:03:30] slow to anger
[1:03:32] that takes no pleasure in the death even
[1:03:34] of the wicked
[1:03:36] once every man to come to salvation
[1:03:39] wants every man to live why will you why
[1:03:41] will you not come to me that you may
[1:03:43] have life
[1:03:44] why are you determined to keep going in
[1:03:46] that direction do you not realize my
[1:03:49] that my glory god would not stay in that
[1:03:51] temple
[1:03:52] he wouldn't share that temple with an
[1:03:55] idol
[1:03:56] he's not going to share your home your
[1:03:59] heart your mind your activities your
[1:04:02] christianity he's not going to share
[1:04:04] that with the world
[1:04:09] and then he then finally he moves again
[1:04:12] and he moves a little further he moves
[1:04:13] into the east
[1:04:16] and then finally
[1:04:17] he moves out of jerusalem
[1:04:20] and he sees and the last time he saw him
[1:04:23] he was on the mountain headed out of
[1:04:25] headed out of judah
[1:04:27] judea he's literally just going to leave
[1:04:29] the whole tribal land and he's going to
[1:04:31] just fly off to heaven
[1:04:35] and then they've got no one there
[1:04:38] to keep the babylonians out
[1:04:41] he didn't do it overnight
[1:04:44] he doesn't he doesn't treat you like
[1:04:46] that
[1:04:48] you know we we have to constantly think
[1:04:50] about in our lives friends as this world
[1:04:53] is steeping
[1:04:54] and getting darker and darker and darker
[1:04:57] and the power of the enemy is rampant
[1:04:59] across the earth and god god already
[1:05:02] knows the world has ejected him but he's
[1:05:05] calling to his family he's calling to
[1:05:07] his children he called you out of those
[1:05:10] systems and said don't stay in there and
[1:05:12] die come out of her my people
[1:05:14] lest you end up suffering her plagues
[1:05:17] i'm not telling you that god's family is
[1:05:19] going to go through the tribulation but
[1:05:20] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:05:22] god is watching our lives he looks at
[1:05:24] our heart he considers our motives and
[1:05:27] our objectives and his question is is
[1:05:29] your life bringing me glory
[1:05:32] amen or is your allegiance divided
[1:05:36] is your allegiance between me and the
[1:05:38] world divided you know jesus said you
[1:05:40] couldn't do that
[1:05:43] you can't serve god and mammon you can't
[1:05:45] serve god in the world you're going to
[1:05:47] love one and hate the others say i would
[1:05:48] never hate god you'd be amazed what the
[1:05:51] human being is capable of
[1:05:53] when the glory of the lord departs
[1:05:58] and there's been many a home
[1:06:00] that started out so wonderfully many a
[1:06:03] young person that started out full of
[1:06:05] fire many churches many preachers many
[1:06:09] many things that started out so strong
[1:06:12] and so good i'm here to tell you
[1:06:13] something friends we can't ever sit on
[1:06:15] rest on our laurels we can't just lay
[1:06:17] back we got to keep going forward
[1:06:19] undesiring forward undesired i'm not
[1:06:21] here to say oh my word it's great we've
[1:06:24] got a great anointing we've got great
[1:06:25] music we're going to build a new
[1:06:26] building we've got new families coming
[1:06:27] in you think the devil's going to take
[1:06:29] that laying down i'm here to tell you
[1:06:31] we're going to have to press harder
[1:06:33] we're going to have to have more
[1:06:34] sincerity and i'm going to tell you
[1:06:36] something right now if the devil has
[1:06:38] begun to divide your attention between
[1:06:40] the glory of god and the glory of the
[1:06:43] world you need to abandon the enemy and
[1:06:45] run back to god and say have mercy on me
[1:06:48] lord and re re-light my fire some of us
[1:06:52] need our fire relent tonight
[1:06:55] so i remember a time when the glory of
[1:06:57] god surged in my life i remember a time
[1:07:00] when i couldn't wait to be at church i
[1:07:02] remember a time when prayer came so easy
[1:07:05] i remember a time when i could sing and
[1:07:07] raise my hands and now i can hardly i
[1:07:09] can hardly keep from counting the
[1:07:11] minutes till the preacher finishes so i
[1:07:13] can get back home to my stuff oh i'm
[1:07:15] here to tell you something friends this
[1:07:16] world is burning down and it's giving
[1:07:19] satan all the glory but there's got to
[1:07:21] be some people
[1:07:22] who say all glory to god
[1:07:25] my life is going to be a testimony to
[1:07:27] the glory of god
[1:07:33] it was sad
[1:07:36] you know they had
[1:07:38] god had been so gracious like he is to
[1:07:40] us
[1:07:43] he was so personal
[1:07:47] when moses says
[1:07:49] show me your
[1:07:51] glory
[1:07:54] and here's this is a difficult question
[1:07:57] moses you understand that
[1:07:59] that's just not something willy-nilly
[1:08:02] you want to see my glory that's big
[1:08:05] that's not like you wanting to go see a
[1:08:07] a mulberry tree
[1:08:09] you want to see my glory
[1:08:11] i don't do that very often
[1:08:13] very few people
[1:08:16] in the whole world
[1:08:17] get that kind of insight on me
[1:08:21] but moses
[1:08:23] i love you
[1:08:25] and here's what i'll do you can't see my
[1:08:27] face
[1:08:28] not and live
[1:08:29] so i'll put you in the cleft of rock
[1:08:30] i'll find a way moses
[1:08:33] to show myself to you

[1:08:37] here to tell you something friends you
[1:08:39] can you can go to god tonight he can't
[1:08:40] respect persons you might want to say
[1:08:42] lord i don't know what i'll be in that
[1:08:44] glorified body someday i know i'm going
[1:08:47] there but could you show me something of
[1:08:49] it tonight could you let some kind of a
[1:08:51] an anointing come upon me that i can
[1:08:53] feel the surge that thing that's going
[1:08:56] to change my body one of these days
[1:08:58] hallelujah let that let that be in my
[1:09:00] morning and in my daytime and in my
[1:09:02] evening time hallelujah let me think
[1:09:05] about that on the job let my mind be on
[1:09:07] heavenly things lord i want to feel your
[1:09:09] presence i want to feel your nearness
[1:09:16] because when you're near
[1:09:19] everything's all right
[1:09:21] when you're near
[1:09:23] all things are possible
[1:09:25] when you're near i don't have to free it
[1:09:27] from afraid anything when you're near
[1:09:30] all my needs are assured when you're
[1:09:32] near
[1:09:33] victory is mine when you're near i can
[1:09:36] overcome the world and i want that more
[1:09:38] than anything lord
[1:09:40] hallelujah what happened to you i i got
[1:09:43] a change inside my soul and that says
[1:09:46] brother matt was i heard this part of
[1:09:48] his sermon how that same power that that
[1:09:51] will change your body is the same power
[1:09:54] that brings that gene to life it brings
[1:09:56] your soul in the presence of almighty
[1:09:58] god
[1:09:59] but it's not two different powers
[1:10:06] god was willing they wanted to
[1:10:09] know something about him he was so
[1:10:12] it was personal enough to grant israel's
[1:10:14] request and he took pains to explain his
[1:10:18] ways and
[1:10:19] you can read it in the scriptures i mean
[1:10:21] so many places we could turn to
[1:10:23] tonight we're to save time and we won't
[1:10:25] but
[1:10:27] you know they wanted to know about what
[1:10:28] are your requirements and i mean you
[1:10:30] have to tell them that
[1:10:32] he could just wait for him to step in a
[1:10:33] hole and smack him in the head well
[1:10:35] you're not supposed to do that
[1:10:38] you know
[1:10:39] but he was gracious
[1:10:41] okay
[1:10:42] well don't do this
[1:10:45] thou shalt not do that and you shall not
[1:10:48] do this
[1:10:49] and remember i'm holy and remember the
[1:10:52] sabbath and remember this covenant and
[1:10:55] remember your promise and if you'll keep
[1:10:58] your word i'll keep mine i'll kill all
[1:11:01] your enemies i'll grow all your crops
[1:11:03] i'll i'll multiply all your households
[1:11:06] you'll have children in abundance you'll
[1:11:08] have health you'll have liberty you'll
[1:11:10] have plenty of money you have plenty of
[1:11:12] food you'll you'll be the lender not the
[1:11:14] borrower you'll be the head and not the
[1:11:16] tail you'll be the nation favored by me
[1:11:20] and that's how personal god was willing
[1:11:22] to be
[1:11:24] and went into great detail through the
[1:11:27] book of exodus and through numbers and
[1:11:29] through deuteronomy and through
[1:11:30] leviticus and and he began to show
[1:11:33] exactly his ways and his nature and what
[1:11:35] was expected and the people look at that
[1:11:37] and said we'll do it yeah we're in man
[1:11:39] i'm you're gonna do that for us we'll
[1:11:41] definitely do all this for you they
[1:11:42] didn't
[1:11:44] they didn't and even for a while god
[1:11:46] kept up his end
[1:11:48] and you know they'd get to get to a
[1:11:50] point where he'd just have to come down
[1:11:52] and bring a little parental correction
[1:11:55] on they'd line up right quick
[1:11:57] and then he would let the blessings flow
[1:11:59] again and they'd make some more progress
[1:12:01] and and he said every time
[1:12:04] every time i do that for you you forget
[1:12:09] me
[1:12:10] every time i'm good to you
[1:12:13] every time i bless you every time you
[1:12:16] pray and i come on and i help you and
[1:12:18] then you thank me and then you forget me
[1:12:22] and you're you're more interested in
[1:12:24] your own agenda than my agenda what's
[1:12:26] your agenda lord that you be a holy
[1:12:28] nation as an example to the world
[1:12:31] so that if they never open a bible
[1:12:34] you know if if if school chums never
[1:12:36] open this they'll they'll read this
[1:12:38] every day looking at you young people
[1:12:42] if if they if this city never reads this
[1:12:45] they can still see the believers out
[1:12:47] here at night they can still hear our
[1:12:49] sermons we're on we're broadcasting
[1:12:51] online our speakers are running outside
[1:12:53] we stand out of the yard with love and
[1:12:56] and and fellowship one with another and
[1:12:58] we move in the community and they see
[1:13:00] that we're honest men and honest women
[1:13:02] and that we're hard workers and that
[1:13:03] we're decent and we're moral
[1:13:07] we're not
[1:13:09] like the world
[1:13:11] and we don't want to be
[1:13:13] at all
[1:13:16] not even a little bit
[1:13:19] i it it is you know this is what this is
[1:13:21] what paul was
[1:13:23] referencing
[1:13:24] you know that when when he started
[1:13:26] talking about you know
[1:13:27] women's hair and men's hair and this
[1:13:29] dress and this conduct and this and
[1:13:31] paul's whole emphasis if you read the
[1:13:33] whole thing in its entirety what paul is
[1:13:35] trying to get them to
[1:13:37] to realize is
[1:13:39] that not only do these break covenants
[1:13:41] of god and and make bad types and and
[1:13:43] and it's it's it's you do certain things
[1:13:45] for the sake of the angels everything
[1:13:46] but here's here's another big here's
[1:13:48] another big one
[1:13:49] that you don't ever don't ever whatever
[1:13:52] you do this is paul's instruction
[1:13:54] whatever you do
[1:13:56] don't ever be found
[1:13:58] in public and somebody because of the
[1:14:02] way you're dressed or talking or acting
[1:14:04] or doing somebody would accidentally
[1:14:07] mistake you for not being a christian
[1:14:11] that somebody would actually not realize
[1:14:14] you're a christian and they would
[1:14:16] mistake you for a person of the world
[1:14:18] and paul was saying that is the most sad
[1:14:22] shameful thing that could possibly
[1:14:25] happen to you amen because your whole
[1:14:28] purpose of being here is to be to bring
[1:14:31] him glory your whole purpose is to
[1:14:33] glorify god in the way you talk and the
[1:14:35] way you act and where you go and what
[1:14:37] you do and and and i'm here to tell you
[1:14:40] there's too many times that god's family
[1:14:43] hear me friends there's too many times
[1:14:45] especially here with with so much of the
[1:14:48] world to offer and god's children who
[1:14:50] used to know him in the power of his
[1:14:52] resurrection who used to have a fervent
[1:14:54] prayer life who used to never miss
[1:14:56] church and now the slightest thing
[1:14:58] interrupts that entire program and
[1:15:00] they're full of carnality and
[1:15:02] worldliness and they don't care about
[1:15:04] their prayer life or their church
[1:15:05] schedule or their children
[1:15:08] amen who watched that example and
[1:15:10] learned from it
[1:15:13] said brother jason can you please leave
[1:15:14] town again
[1:15:17] and i will i'm going this weekend
[1:15:22] i wasn't going to preach this tonight i
[1:15:24] get totally different notes i brought
[1:15:26] out two sets of notes in case the lord
[1:15:28] let me out of it he hasn't
[1:15:32] we're supposed to bring him glory
[1:15:36] and god takes the time to send you a
[1:15:39] message and a messenger with with
[1:15:41] intricate
[1:15:43] detailed testimonies of the power of god
[1:15:47] and what pleases god and how to be happy
[1:15:50] in your home and how to have how to have
[1:15:52] the holy ghost and how to have the how
[1:15:54] to have the authority over devils and
[1:15:56] how to how to be under the blessing of
[1:15:58] almighty god and how to witness in the
[1:16:00] community and we have no excuse friends
[1:16:03] we have no excuse we have no way that
[1:16:06] nothing that we can blame except the man
[1:16:08] in the mirror
[1:16:13] god is so personal and he's so willing
[1:16:15] to help you know
[1:16:17] i think about paul when he
[1:16:19] got struck down on the road to damascus
[1:16:21] there i stood right there where he
[1:16:24] got launched out of the saddle and hit
[1:16:25] the ground
[1:16:30] and i
[1:16:31] i think about his conversation that he
[1:16:33] has with god
[1:16:35] seeing that great light and who are you
[1:16:38] lord
[1:16:38] brother branham
[1:16:40] jumps in
[1:16:41] to help us with clarity and says now he
[1:16:43] was a scholar
[1:16:45] see he he knew what that light was
[1:16:49] he would have never called something
[1:16:50] lord
[1:16:51] but he knew
[1:16:53] wow
[1:16:55] we haven't seen that
[1:16:57] since that left the temple
[1:17:01] they they that when god lifted up
[1:17:04] between the cherubims and went to the
[1:17:05] south door and went to the east store
[1:17:06] and left jerusalem and went to judea and
[1:17:08] went over the mountaintop and and and
[1:17:11] left judea
[1:17:12] and he never again
[1:17:15] appeared
[1:17:16] in the earth
[1:17:18] until he
[1:17:20] laid in a manger wrapped in swaddling
[1:17:22] cloth
[1:17:24] and that manger was a much
[1:17:28] greater
[1:17:29] image of him than the than the one that
[1:17:32] left the tabernacle because the
[1:17:34] tabernacle represented him
[1:17:36] and god would live inside of him like he
[1:17:39] would live inside the tabernacle but
[1:17:41] because of the people's sins he had to
[1:17:43] leave that tabernacle he would never
[1:17:45] leave this baby
[1:17:46] he would live he and he he was filled
[1:17:49] with the spirit of god and brother bam
[1:17:50] talks about that holy ghost in him and
[1:17:52] could never leave him and had to be with
[1:17:54] him all the way into eternity
[1:17:57] i get the anointing left him in the
[1:17:58] garden and he went to calvary as a man
[1:18:00] that's
[1:18:01] uh in the mystery of the godhead that
[1:18:03] we're not preaching on that tonight but
[1:18:05] but but now here's paul
[1:18:08] and he
[1:18:09] suddenly he found the lord to be much
[1:18:12] more personal
[1:18:14] than all his theology training had ever
[1:18:16] taught him
[1:18:19] i mean paul was a theologian of
[1:18:21] theologian pharisee of the pharisees
[1:18:23] as touching the law blameless
[1:18:26] zealous
[1:18:28] eager energetic here's the man who
[1:18:31] volunteered to do everything for god
[1:18:33] and now here he is
[1:18:36] smacked out of the saddle laying on the
[1:18:38] ground can't see a thing but he sees a
[1:18:40] bright light
[1:18:41] he hears a voice so it's all
[1:18:44] why persecutest thou me
[1:18:47] wait what
[1:18:50] who are you lord
[1:18:52] all my theology
[1:18:54] i never had you speak to me i read about
[1:18:57] you i never imagined you would actually
[1:18:58] talk to me
[1:19:00] all my life i've studied you all my life
[1:19:03] i've been serving you
[1:19:05] wow is this ever personal
[1:19:09] i'm kicking i i'm resisting you yes
[1:19:13] whoa
[1:19:14] how is that possible
[1:19:16] i'm a scholar i'm a pharisees of
[1:19:17] pharisees who are you how am i resisting
[1:19:20] you i'm jesus
[1:19:25] you're talking about a paradigm shift
[1:19:28] suddenly that brother had something he
[1:19:30] had to think about you're jesus yes
[1:19:33] i never put that together well you do
[1:19:36] now paul
[1:19:37] and and you're you're persecuting me
[1:19:39] because you're persecuting my family
[1:19:43] and then he goes and and we and we find
[1:19:46] that you know i mean it wasn't that paul
[1:19:48] wasn't acquainted with what the pillar
[1:19:50] of fire was
[1:19:52] i hope you're gathering paul's
[1:19:54] astonishment it's not that he's
[1:19:56] unacquainted with the pillar of fire he
[1:19:58] knows what that is
[1:19:59] he knew theologically god dwelt in light
[1:20:02] he knew that
[1:20:03] he knew historically that he appeared to
[1:20:05] israel like that in the past
[1:20:09] but he hadn't been seen like that in
[1:20:10] hundreds of years
[1:20:13] not since the days of jeremiah when he
[1:20:14] lifted up from the
[1:20:16] holy place and was seen heading back to
[1:20:19] heaven
[1:20:20] not something you'd really want to see
[1:20:22] really
[1:20:24] to see god to see god
[1:20:26] leave your church
[1:20:28] to see him
[1:20:29] depart from your life
[1:20:31] depart from your home
[1:20:33] oh friends
[1:20:34] that should make us tremble
[1:20:38] this gradual departure as as is so often
[1:20:42] the case
[1:20:45] then who better than who better
[1:20:47] to warn
[1:20:48] than paul
[1:20:50] to come to the church and say listen
[1:20:52] i thought i knew him but i'm here to
[1:20:55] tell you now
[1:20:56] that i had to forget everything to
[1:20:58] really know him
[1:21:01] i had to just forget everything
[1:21:02] everything i thought that i knew about
[1:21:05] him i didn't even i realized now i
[1:21:07] didn't know him at all
[1:21:09] i didn't even know he was jesus all i
[1:21:11] knew was what theology had told me all i
[1:21:14] knew was what history had told me all i
[1:21:16] knew was what i could read in the
[1:21:17] prophets i never imagined he could be so
[1:21:20] personally known well guess what he is
[1:21:23] and he can and he wants to be known by
[1:21:25] you that way
[1:21:27] and that's where he goes into those you
[1:21:30] know where he says there what what
[1:21:32] things were gained to me i counted loss
[1:21:34] for christ i was i was preaching uh and
[1:21:37] had some a little bit of amusement the
[1:21:39] way i went at it on sunday morning there
[1:21:42] and hickory
[1:21:43] you know kind of had everybody wondering
[1:21:44] what in the world for the first 10
[1:21:46] minutes i said now today i'm going to be
[1:21:48] very transparent i want to be honest
[1:21:50] before everybody and everybody you know
[1:21:52] they're starting to you know okay well
[1:21:53] this is going to be serious but jason
[1:21:55] he's going to go say some things i said
[1:21:57] you know i just want to speak to you
[1:21:58] from my heart
[1:21:59] and i just want to tell you that i'm a
[1:22:01] loser
[1:22:03] and they all
[1:22:04] wait what
[1:22:05] yeah i'm a loser
[1:22:07] and i said you know i said but now don't
[1:22:10] you know normally the street term loser
[1:22:13] you know is somebody who don't know a
[1:22:15] good thing when they got it and and and
[1:22:17] they ruin it by just stupidity and just
[1:22:19] being dumb or being inconsiderate and
[1:22:21] they just gotta go you don't know a good
[1:22:23] thing and hit you in the face and you
[1:22:25] ruined it now man you're a loser
[1:22:28] i said i'm not that kind of loser
[1:22:32] i said i'm the happy loser
[1:22:35] and i said because i followed paul and i
[1:22:38] lost everything so that i could know
[1:22:40] christ
[1:22:42] i said i'm such a happy loser i said i'm
[1:22:45] probably the happiest loser of all time
[1:22:49] and probably i feel like the happiest
[1:22:50] loser in history
[1:22:53] because i lost it all to gain it all i
[1:22:56] gave away the world i gave away my
[1:22:58] dreams i gave away my motives and my
[1:23:00] objectives i didn't want them anymore i
[1:23:02] met jesus and i didn't want to be me
[1:23:04] after that i wanted to be him
[1:23:07] oh he took away friends from me that
[1:23:10] would have harmed me and led me astray
[1:23:12] he took away opportunities in business i
[1:23:14] could have had because he knew it would
[1:23:16] pollute my life he took away a
[1:23:19] family he took away
[1:23:21] opportunities and i'm here to tell you
[1:23:23] i've never been so happy to lose
[1:23:26] everything and gain christ
[1:23:30] amen what things were gained to me it's
[1:23:33] amazing when you read that
[1:23:35] because paul when he's talking about
[1:23:38] you know i count all things but lost for
[1:23:40] the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:23:42] christ jesus for whom i have suffered
[1:23:44] the loss of all things
[1:23:46] and then he goes down this whole list
[1:23:50] of
[1:23:51] really
[1:23:52] good
[1:23:53] credentials
[1:23:56] born the circumcised the eighth day
[1:23:58] of the stock of benjamin man that's
[1:24:01] check
[1:24:02] that's a winner
[1:24:04] uh
[1:24:06] a pharisee of the pharisees check man
[1:24:10] uh touching the law blameless check
[1:24:13] check check i mean here's paul and he's
[1:24:16] going down all of these all of these
[1:24:18] things he's not calling them bad
[1:24:20] in fact is what he says in verse seven
[1:24:22] is but what things were gain
[1:24:26] he's not saying they weren't gain he's
[1:24:27] not saying god you know god just took
[1:24:30] all the bad things you god took good
[1:24:32] things from you
[1:24:33] things that could have gave you more
[1:24:35] money things that might have made you
[1:24:36] more popular things that might have made
[1:24:37] you more acceptance things that might
[1:24:39] have allowed you to bypass some
[1:24:41] persecution and have and not have such a
[1:24:43] hard time i mean it got god god you know
[1:24:46] what he's saying is i took all of the
[1:24:49] good things that were gained to me
[1:24:52] and when i compared them all to christ i
[1:24:55] counted them as rubbish as garbage as
[1:24:59] dung heap i didn't want any of those
[1:25:02] advantages i only wanted christ
[1:25:05] i wanted the glory of the lord to shine
[1:25:08] in my life i wanted god to have sway in
[1:25:11] my every day
[1:25:14] i wanted my life to count for something
[1:25:16] eternal
[1:25:18] that's where i'm at friends
[1:25:20] that's where i hope you are
[1:25:21] i mean this world isn't getting better
[1:25:24] it's getting worse
[1:25:30] you know i
[1:25:33] i can't help but
[1:25:35] turn one more corner and
[1:25:38] just got to follow the instructions of
[1:25:41] the lord
[1:25:45] you know i realized
[1:25:48] as i've grown older
[1:25:51] that like paul i wasn't interested in my
[1:25:55] own righteousness anymore
[1:25:58] i wasn't any more interested in my own
[1:26:00] accomplishments even the good ones
[1:26:03] what i needed i remember that day i
[1:26:06] remember
[1:26:07] you know i i told the hickory church
[1:26:09] there a little bit of my own testimony
[1:26:11] and
[1:26:12] you know born into the message and
[1:26:16] you know
[1:26:17] still in the womb of my mother when
[1:26:19] she's coming to the lord baptized in
[1:26:21] jesus name gets the baptism the holy
[1:26:23] ghost shouts all over the place speaks
[1:26:24] in a language not our own and i'm
[1:26:26] insider they call me the holy ghost baby
[1:26:28] sister mom
[1:26:29] the holy ghost baby
[1:26:33] raised up there in the tabernacle
[1:26:36] heard tapes every day of my life say you
[1:26:38] went to church every day no but sister
[1:26:40] mom played him every day
[1:26:42] and if we went at home listen to him we
[1:26:43] was at church listening to him
[1:26:46] and
[1:26:46] and and
[1:26:48] friends with the branham family and grew
[1:26:50] up with those guys and friends and my
[1:26:52] parents friends with their their parents
[1:26:54] and
[1:26:55] sitting there seven years and
[1:26:58] you know i think about all the
[1:26:59] advantages
[1:27:00] but i had to come to a place one day
[1:27:02] where i said you know with all of these
[1:27:05] advantages these are good things these
[1:27:07] are all good advantages i was healed
[1:27:08] under his ministry of an incurable
[1:27:10] disease i set as a baby under that
[1:27:12] anointing as he operated his ladder his
[1:27:14] ladder pulls
[1:27:15] but you know something
[1:27:17] i found myself like paul
[1:27:20] and i can remember
[1:27:22] i can remember as a young man you listen
[1:27:24] to me young people you don't have to be
[1:27:25] very old to give your heart to the lord
[1:27:27] completely
[1:27:28] and i remember as a young man saying to
[1:27:30] myself what has all of these advantages
[1:27:33] got me i'm still missing that fervency
[1:27:37] i'm still missing that personal i'd read
[1:27:39] paul i'd read john i'd read the stories
[1:27:42] of brother branham i'd read the the the
[1:27:44] old saints and the old war heroes of the
[1:27:46] faith and my my heart my young heart
[1:27:48] would burn and i knew that i hadn't
[1:27:51] finally had to reach a point where i
[1:27:53] couldn't get in on my parents coattails
[1:27:56] and i couldn't get in on my own
[1:27:57] advantage i had to have a personal
[1:28:00] experience with this god i had to make
[1:28:03] up my mind that today my life is going
[1:28:06] to bring glory to god and i'm not going
[1:28:09] to keep going down the road bringing
[1:28:11] glory to the world i'm done with that
[1:28:15] it's the greatest decision huh my only
[1:28:17] reason what's your greatest regret that
[1:28:19] i didn't do it when i was even younger
[1:28:21] oh i'm here to tell you something
[1:28:22] friends there's nothing like serving god
[1:28:24] there's nothing like being pleasing to
[1:28:26] god there's nothing like having him as a
[1:28:28] friend having him as somebody closer
[1:28:30] than a brother somebody who'll help you
[1:28:32] talk to you love you care for you

[1:29:08] and say i'm not going my way
[1:29:12] anymore

[1:29:17] and i i didn't i could have been in some
[1:29:19] other age god put me right
[1:29:22] here amen

[1:29:33] that confidence how many would like that

[1:30:35] part of the day but lord i knew your
[1:30:38] anointing when i felt it i knew your

[1:31:16] yeah lord
[1:31:18] even things
[1:31:20] that might be a gain and i worked hard
[1:31:22] to get it i finally struggled and
[1:31:24] sweated and grinded it out and i finally
[1:31:26] got it
[1:31:28] and now i'm hearing tonight a preacher
[1:31:30] say well

[1:31:50] say who are you lord
[1:31:52] will you show me your glory
[1:31:55] in all my theology i thought i knew you

[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] we see things unraveling so quickly i've
[1:32:39] been
[1:32:40] astonished
[1:32:42] at the pace
[1:32:45] of
[1:32:46] things that are that we've been looking
[1:32:48] at in prophecy for years wondering we
[1:32:50] know it was coming but what will it look
[1:32:52] like when it gets here and we're seeing
[1:32:54] it
[1:32:55] and it's happening all around us lord
[1:33:02] all right
[1:33:04] i
[1:33:05] avoided it
[1:33:08] but you're not going to let me
[1:33:14] i'll ask
[1:33:17] i want every head and heart bowed
[1:33:21] every head and heart bowed
[1:33:26] on behalf of the lord may i say and ask
[1:33:28] you a question
[1:33:33] where were you
[1:33:35] when his glory began to depart and you
[1:33:37] didn't know it
[1:33:40] what were you doing
[1:33:43] just like israel they were still going
[1:33:44] to church
[1:33:47] they were still walking into the temple
[1:33:51] right while they're in their worshiping
[1:33:55] they don't even know
[1:33:57] you're leaving
[1:34:01] church was just a routine to him
[1:34:06] serving god was just some
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:10] some human thing that we do because well
[1:34:12] we just should and we'd do it and
[1:34:15] whatever
[1:34:17] didn't really mean much to him anymore
[1:34:20] they still showed up to church they
[1:34:22] still walked right in they still started
[1:34:24] still started to bring their offerings
[1:34:26] of praise
[1:34:28] sing their songs raise their hands
[1:34:30] go through the motions
[1:34:33] and he and here's the prophet who's been
[1:34:36] lord you you grabbed him by the by the
[1:34:38] hair by the nap of his head and you
[1:34:40] lifted him up in the air over the top
[1:34:42] and looked down
[1:34:44] into the temple as if there was no roof
[1:34:46] on it and he and saw them worshiping
[1:34:50] and they were not even aware
[1:34:53] you had already left the cherubs you
[1:34:55] were standing at the south door they
[1:34:57] never even knew
[1:34:58] then you went to the east and they never
[1:35:00] knew then you left jerusalem and they
[1:35:02] never knew you left judea you went over
[1:35:04] the mountain and headed off back to
[1:35:06] heaven and they never knew
[1:35:08] they never even knew
[1:35:11] your glory was departed
[1:35:14] it was never coming back
[1:35:17] not under that system
[1:35:20] no way
[1:35:23] where were you friends
[1:35:25] the lord just drilled this into me to
[1:35:27] ask you on his behalf
[1:35:30] have you been unaware
[1:35:33] as the world has
[1:35:35] sifted your mind
[1:35:38] contaminated your spirit with
[1:35:41] i don't even say sinful things just
[1:35:43] things that aren't
[1:35:44] lending to your righteousness
[1:35:47] just stuff over the world and
[1:35:50] your prayer life is not as easy as it
[1:35:52] used to be your
[1:35:54] your fellowship your church attendance
[1:35:56] your commitments to god your your strict
[1:35:59] holiness
