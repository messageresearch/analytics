[0:00] [Music]
[0:11] I'm just happy to be here.
[0:15] Let's all stand together and
[0:18] let's have us a word of prayer.
[0:21] Father, we thank you for this day that
[0:22] you've given us, Lord. Lord, we just
[0:24] pray for this portion of the service,
[0:26] Lord, that you would come down and
[0:28] &gt;&gt; anoint the words, Father. May you be
[0:29] with the main portion of the service to
[0:31] sing in our brother JD. Father, as he
[0:34] prepares to bring us the word this
[0:35] morning, Lord, we come hungry. We come
[0:37] expecting to hear from heaven. Father,
[0:40] may you just be with us today. Meet our
[0:41] needs, Father. Lord, just be with those
[0:44] that's here, those that couldn't, those
[0:46] that's on the internet, those listen
[0:47] later. Father, Lord, we just pray place
[0:50] this part in your hand in Jesus name.
[0:52] Amen. I want to read in Proverbs 15:33.
[0:57] And I titled this
[1:00] the path to honor.
[1:02] The path to honor. Proverbs 15:33. It
[1:05] says, "The fear of the Lord is the
[1:08] instruction of wisdom and before honor
[1:11] is humility." Now, God had a blessing to
[1:14] have your seats.
[1:16] So, before we can get any honor,
[1:19] we've got to become humble.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of us want success?
[1:24] We all want want success in our in our
[1:26] lives. But how do you get it? The
[1:29] prophet God said this. He's going to
[1:31] tell us if we want to be successful. So
[1:34] here we go. Humility is a way to
[1:38] success.
[1:40] Humility is a way to success.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; It don't matter how much money you pay
[1:44] in the tithe offering.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; It don't matter how much money you make.
[1:48] The only success that you have is being
[1:50] humility.
[1:51] is have humility.
[1:53] He says, "Wait on one another.
[1:57] Be a servant.
[1:59] Do service for one another.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Don't be bigger than somebody else. Try
[2:04] and see how little you can be." You
[2:07] know, he says, "I often heard say, don't
[2:08] never be big in your own sight. If
[2:12] you're big, let it be God's sight. Be
[2:16] little in your own sight. So every man
[2:18] that humbles himself, God will exalt,
[2:21] but those who exalt themselves, God will
[2:23] abase.
[2:25] Belittle. You know, this word abase when
[2:28] I look at it kind of stood out to me. So
[2:29] I kind of had to look it up. I'm I'm
[2:32] still a hillbilly from Tennessee. I
[2:33] don't know everything. So I had to work
[2:35] up look up the word abase. It means to
[2:37] cast down,
[2:39] &gt;&gt; to reduce low, to humble, to degrade.
[2:45] Applied to passions. is rank office as
[2:47] condition in life. So Jesus tells over
[2:50] in Matthew 23:12, he says, "Whosoever
[2:52] shall exalt himself shall be abased,
[2:55] brought down, and he that shall humble
[2:57] himself shall be exalted." And I found
[3:00] that that word humble there means exact
[3:02] same definition as the base.
[3:05] So we're going to be brought down either
[3:07] way,
[3:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:09] &gt;&gt; It depends on who's going to do it.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; It's going to be God or it's going to be
[3:12] you.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Because that's what the scripture says.
[3:15] He says, "Whosoever shall exalt himself
[3:19] to humble yourself."
[3:22] It's either way. You know, I like to see
[3:25] people who think they're better than
[3:27] others.
[3:29] I got more money than you and they
[3:30] acted. You could tell. You could tell
[3:32] people who in a church who has more
[3:34] money than everybody else because
[3:35] they'll act like it.
[3:39] I supposed to be teaching Sunday school.
[3:42] You watch what happens to them.
[3:45] they be brought down.
[3:48] So you don't have to be rich and
[3:49] mightymen
[3:50] &gt;&gt; in this world to be great in the sight
[3:52] of God. You only have to be humble in
[3:55] your own heart. And God will call that
[3:58] greatness.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; I want to be called great this morning.
[4:02] He that's great enough to humble
[4:03] himself, that's a great person.
[4:08] They'll take the blame for everything.
[4:11] They'll humble themselves, that's
[4:12] greatness. Because the scripture here
[4:14] says, "He that will humble himself
[4:15] again, God will exalt,
[4:18] and he that exaltth himself shall be
[4:20] abased."
[4:22] How many wants to know the way up this
[4:24] morning?
[4:26] You say, "I want to know." How many
[4:28] wants to know the way up?
[4:32] The way down is up
[4:36] for the believer. That's why Bre said,
[4:37] "Humble yourself before God. Humble
[4:40] thyself
[4:42] and the Lord will lift you up. You say,
[4:45] "I want to be lifted up this morning."
[4:46] How do I do that? Humble yourself.
[4:49] Become low. Become like Jesus. You know,
[4:52] Jesus met with a lot of men in his walk
[4:55] in life. So, it didn't matter how many
[4:57] people were in church for Jesus.
[5:00] He preached to thousands. He preached to
[5:02] hundreds. He preached to 20. He even
[5:05] preached to one. got a lot of ministers
[5:07] around the message that says, "Man,
[5:10] there's eight people in that church. I
[5:12] ain't going. I can't go. If there's not
[5:15] a convention, I ain't preaching."
[5:19] Humble yourself.
[5:23] We say we want to be like God, do we
[5:26] really?
[5:27] &gt;&gt; We sing the song to be like Jesus.
[5:31] On earth, I long to be like him. I want
[5:34] to love like Jesus. Can you love like
[5:37] Jesus
[5:39] when you're being spit spit on your
[5:41] beard plucked out, made fun of, people
[5:43] calling you a devil? Can you really
[5:44] truly say, "I want to be like you,
[5:46] Lord."
[5:48] Can you humble yourself? What did Jesus
[5:50] do? He was God on a throne.
[5:53] He was being worshiped by angels day and
[5:57] night. Holy, holy, holy worship.
[6:01] Why would he want to come down to a
[6:02] place like this?
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Take up a form of a baby, walk around as
[6:06] a man to be made fun of, called a devil,
[6:10] humbled himself to show us what we need
[6:13] to do. We're not so great that we can't
[6:15] be humbled.
[6:17] That's what makes him great. That what
[6:20] makes God makes him God is because of
[6:24] humility. So you want to say I want to
[6:27] be like God
[6:29] become humble.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; But says if you notice talking about
[6:34] both sides it started in Genesis
[6:36] religion on both sides. One was denom
[6:39] talking about Cain and Abel. One was
[6:41] denominational high-minded. The other
[6:43] one was unhumble walking in the spirit
[6:46] by revelation. You know Cain brought his
[6:48] offering to the Lord. It was so
[6:50] beautiful. He was so proud of it. He
[6:52] laid it up there, sat back and admired
[6:54] it. took his phone out, sent a picture
[6:57] out to the group. Man, look at my
[7:00] offering.
[7:01] Ain't this beautiful?
[7:04] Prideful. It's what he done. He looks
[7:06] over. Here comes Abel grab dragging his
[7:09] sacrifice up to the altar. Picked the up
[7:11] there and bit a rock and blood going
[7:13] everywhere.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Abel willing to become a mess in church.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; What about us sometimes? Oh Lord, please
[7:21] don't let me act like sister soando.
[7:24] Don't let me act like brother to so and
[7:26] so. Lord, please don't make me cry.
[7:28] It'll mess up my makeup.
[7:32] I say if you wear a makeup, you it needs
[7:34] to be messed up.
[7:36] That was free.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; How could Abel ever know that it was a
[7:42] lamb instead of fruits from the field?
[7:44] It called it was revealed to him by
[7:46] divine revelation.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; But what happened to Cain? He got mad.
[7:52] He got puffed up. You know because
[7:54] Genesis tells he's talk about how Cain
[7:57] his offering he had not respect and Cain
[8:00] was very wroth and his countenance fell
[8:02] and the Lord said Cain why art thou
[8:04] wroth why is thy countenance fallen?
[8:08] If thou doest well shalt thou not be
[8:10] accepted?
[8:13] &gt;&gt; If thou doest well he was so mad at Abel
[8:17] because Abel caught the revelation
[8:20] &gt;&gt; and God accepted Abel's sacrifice. So
[8:23] Abel was walking in the spirit of
[8:25] revelation.
[8:27] So you know Jesus when he come to to
[8:29] disciples says who do men say that I am
[8:33] that some says Elijah you're just a
[8:36] prophet you're some kind of great man
[8:38] you're this or that. But he said who do
[8:40] you say that I am?
[8:42] Oh Peter spoke up says well thou art
[8:45] Christ. I mean this man Peter walked
[8:48] walked with Jesus. He seen Jesus's
[8:51] weaknesses. He's seen Jesus's frailty,
[8:53] but he says, "I'm not looking at a man,
[8:56] but I'm looking at Christ." Thou art
[8:58] Christ, the son of the living God.
[9:01] He says, "Well, flesh and blood have
[9:02] revealed this to you, but my father by
[9:05] revelation." So upon this rock,
[9:06] revelation,
[9:08] divine revelation, I'll build my church.
[9:11] It's divine revelation. So to get
[9:14] revelation,
[9:16] you got to be humble.
[9:18] So what did pride do? We know the story
[9:20] of Lucifer. Ezekiel 28
[9:23] 13 it says, "Thou hast been in the
[9:25] garden of God." Talk about Lucifer.
[9:28] "Every precious stone was thy covering,
[9:30] the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the
[9:32] barrel, the ox, the jasper, the
[9:34] sapphire, the emerald, the carbuncle,
[9:37] and gold. And thy workmanships of thy
[9:40] tabts, and thy pipes were prepared in
[9:42] thee in the day thou was created. Thou
[9:45] art the anointed cherub, and I have set
[9:48] thee so and was upon the holy mountain
[9:50] of God. You walked in the midst of
[9:52] stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy
[9:55] ways until
[9:58] iniquity was found in thee. We know what
[10:00] that iniquity was.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; What happened to the devil? So
[10:04] therefore, I will cast thee out as
[10:06] profane out of the mountain of God.
[10:10] I will destroy thee.
[10:13] Thy heart was lifted up because of thy
[10:16] beauty. He got prideful in what he
[10:18] looked like.
[10:25] He says, "They know that thee among the
[10:27] people shall be astonished at thee, and
[10:30] thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt
[10:33] thou be anymore."
[10:35] So here's what Lucifer thought about
[10:36] himself. It was all about himself
[10:39] because in in Isaiah 14:12, "How art
[10:42] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer,
[10:45] we know brother Ram told us that was
[10:47] pride." Pride is what brought him down.
[10:49] He says, "Son of the morning, how art
[10:52] thou cut down to the ground which did
[10:53] weaken the nations, for thou hast said
[10:55] in thine heart."
[10:57] He didn't even speak it out of his
[10:59] mouth, but in his heart he said it was
[11:03] to himself. It's like, why is he up
[11:06] there doing Sunday school? I can do
[11:07] better than that.
[11:11] I can do a better job.
[11:13] Why is he that person? You got to sing
[11:15] all the time. I'm a better singer. Well,
[11:18] if you're a better singer than what we
[11:19] got up here, come on up here and show
[11:20] us.
[11:22] I will ascend into heaven.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne above the stars
[11:26] of God. I will sit also in the mount of
[11:30] the congregation, the size of the north,
[11:32] and I will ascend my above the heights.
[11:35] I will be like the most high. There's
[11:38] his pride. It was I. I I this. Is that a
[11:41] humble man? You go around, you'd be
[11:43] talking to somebody, all you hear is I I
[11:45] I I
[11:47] might want to stay away from them.
[11:50] I did this. I can do this. I can do
[11:52] that.
[11:54] God's like, "Yeah, I heard you, devil. I
[11:56] heard what you said in your heart, but
[11:58] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell."
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of that pride, he couldn't
[12:05] humble himself.
[12:07] You know, brother says they so-called
[12:09] themselves the church. They call
[12:11] themselves the bride. In Revelation 17
[12:14] says the false bride above above
[12:16] Christ's little flock, the bride. He
[12:18] exalt himself above the humble word of
[12:20] God's truth by the knowledge of the
[12:23] revelation.
[12:24] Knowledge of the revelation. And has
[12:27] placed himself by education and theology
[12:30] until they got themselves up. If you
[12:32] don't belong to their group, then you're
[12:33] an outcast. It's like Lucifer did in the
[12:36] beginning in the Garden of Eden when he
[12:38] looked at Esses, surely God has said.
[12:42] That's exactly what they're doing today.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; We feed the poor. Surely
[12:48] he'll receive us. We're a great big
[12:51] beautiful church.
[12:53] Wow. Look at our great buildings. Look
[12:55] at our great memberships. We stand in
[12:57] millions. Surely God will not turn that
[12:59] group down. It's the same thing that
[13:02] Cain did. They brought in their pretty
[13:04] He brought in his pretty fruits from the
[13:06] ground that he had tilled and toiled and
[13:09] brought in the fruit and rejected the
[13:11] humble blood of the lamb. God have
[13:13] mercy.
[13:16] God have mercy.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; So we have so much confusion.
[13:21] Why we have so many denominations? We
[13:23] have so many follow rel different
[13:25] religions even in our own message.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; So much confusion. one believe in this
[13:30] and one believe in that. You get some
[13:31] great man rise up and says it's we got a
[13:33] two soul doctrine and they raise up and
[13:36] they have a great following and they
[13:37] fall down. They were lifted up. They
[13:40] were brought down. They don't have many
[13:41] people following. It's move after move
[13:43] like that. We got this greatest move
[13:45] going on right now among the message. A
[13:48] lot of people are flocking to it. But
[13:49] watch it in a few years. It'll nose
[13:52] dive. If it's really truth, it'll stay.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] This people hasn't been revelated.
[13:59] They're looking to some man for a leader
[14:03] because the spiritual revealed truth has
[14:06] to come through God alone
[14:09] &gt;&gt; because this word is hidden from the
[14:11] wise and prudent. That's what Matthew
[14:12] 11:25 says. At that time Jesus answered
[14:14] and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord of
[14:18] heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
[14:20] these things from the wise and prudent
[14:22] and hast revealed it unto babes.
[14:26] How many babies do we have today? God
[14:29] said so. How many babies do we have
[14:31] today?
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't see but two, three hands go up.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; God said, okay, here's brother Brandham.
[14:39] He reveals it to babies. Such shall
[14:41] learn. So be a baby.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; What do you do with babies?
[14:48] You teach them how to talk. Say mama.
[14:52] Say daddy.
[14:53] You grab their hand. You say, "Okay,
[14:55] let's walk. Come on, let's do it." I
[14:57] thought it was cute. Just went last
[14:59] Wednesday or whatever night it was.
[15:01] Brother Caleb come in with his little
[15:02] boy and I was like, "Why is Caleb
[15:04] standing there?"
[15:06] I look, here's this little baby just
[15:08] walk trying to walk. It was the cutest
[15:10] thing. He was teaching him to walk.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; He teaches the babies. That's what we
[15:15] did. We teach our babies how to do these
[15:18] things. That's what God, treat me like a
[15:21] baby. Feed me, Lord, like a baby. Let me
[15:25] walk around. Teach me to walk like you,
[15:27] God. Talk like you. Humble yourself and
[15:29] say, "Oh, God, here I am. Just make
[15:32] yourself known to me. I love you."
[15:36] God will reveal himself to you. He will
[15:39] make himself known.
[15:42] But it takes the simplicity of believing
[15:45] God to make his word. speak out to show
[15:50] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[15:53] today, and forever. It takes a humble
[15:55] heart dedicated to God and bring Jesus
[15:58] into present tense.
[16:02] If it took theology,
[16:04] we'd be all be lost.
[16:07] If we had to get if we had to be a B
[16:08] Presbyterian, a Baptist, a Catholic, and
[16:10] so forth, us unlearned people wouldn't
[16:12] even have a chance.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't take the knowledge. Amen.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people's got a lot of
[16:18] knowledge. There's a lot of people can
[16:19] take this Bible and study and preach you
[16:21] a good sermon, but all they got is
[16:23] knowledge. They don't have what the
[16:24] revelation means.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take knowledge. It's not by
[16:27] how much we know because Zechariah 4:6
[16:31] and 7 says, "Not by power or by might,
[16:34] but my spirit." Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Sayaith God, I will unfold this mystery.
[16:39] It is I that's going to give you the
[16:41] revelation. It's not you giving it to
[16:44] me.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we need to get out of our mind
[16:47] that it's all us.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; It's all about you. I'm smart. I can
[16:53] read. I can study.
[16:57] I can understand. I can tell you what
[16:59] the scriptures mean. I I I I
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Well, well, we heard that before.
[17:05] It's not by power. It's not by might.
[17:09] It's not how great you are.
[17:12] What happens at the end of it? He'll
[17:13] come forth crying grace and grace with
[17:16] shoutings and cryins.
[17:19] That's what it takes today. It's God's
[17:21] amazing grace to the people.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; How he takes the illiterate, the
[17:25] unlearned and shows that Jesus is the
[17:27] same. And he will even take the foolish
[17:30] of preaching to do it.
[17:35] It seems like it's so hard for people to
[17:37] humble themselves to the word of God.
[17:42] You'll find it when you're talking
[17:45] you women to girls saying it's about
[17:48] wearing long hair. Why you got your hair
[17:51] long? Why do you wear skirts down long?
[17:53] You go talking to them. They kind of
[17:55] give you the shoulder. You know that's
[17:57] right. If there's any lady in them, he
[18:00] said
[18:03] they know that's right. But you see,
[18:05] they can't humble themselves to it.
[18:07] Well, he'll make me look like a plain
[18:09] Jane. Well, who cares?
[18:14] That's what Cain, how did Cain do it? He
[18:18] couldn't humble himself to the
[18:20] vindicated word of God. He couldn't do
[18:22] it. I can't bring an offering like that.
[18:25] I'm going to get blood all over me.
[18:29] You'll say, "Well, glory to God.
[18:31] Hallelujah.
[18:33] I cut my hair and I speak in tongues."
[18:35] That shows right there something's
[18:37] wrong.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "What does this got to do with
[18:42] humility?"
[18:44] It's obedience to the word.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; That's how you It seems so hard to
[18:48] humble to God's word.
[18:52] Says, "Let God just bless a fella and
[18:54] put a little confidence in him and he
[18:56] gets to be a knowit all. He'll go start
[18:58] an organization
[19:00] or he's got to do something that's
[19:02] different.
[19:03] He don't like the same old same old. He
[19:05] wants to start a different religion.
[19:08] God has a hard time trying to get
[19:10] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[19:13] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[19:16] place till God calls him to do
[19:18] something.
[19:20] But we want to hurry it. We want to
[19:21] hurry God alone. A man that God can
[19:24] bless and he'll and still keep himself a
[19:26] man and know he's not an angel or a God.
[19:30] But as soon as a man gets blessed and
[19:32] has a little something given to him, he
[19:34] wants to become God. He wants to become
[19:37] an angel. Just like Lucifer,
[19:40] me, it's me and me in mine. All that,
[19:44] that's the wrong attitude. God is
[19:46] hunting for somebody who he could bless
[19:49] and pour out his blessings.
[19:53] And the more he blessed, the littleler
[19:56] the man will become.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never get more of God until
[20:01] you become nothing.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; How many nothings do we have? You got to
[20:06] belittle yourself. He that will exalt
[20:09] himself, God will bring a base. And he
[20:12] that will humble himself, God is going
[20:14] to exalt you.
[20:17] You've got to get little before you can
[20:19] get big.
[20:20] And you'll never be big in your own
[20:22] self.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll only be as big as God is
[20:26] big in you.
[20:30] You say, "You're reading a lot of
[20:30] quotes." Yeah, I like them.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; He's talking about he had a privilege of
[20:36] meeting some some a lot of men. He said
[20:39] the people's got more pride is those
[20:42] people that got 50 cents in their pocket
[20:44] and they walk around like they're
[20:46] they're it.
[20:48] They got more pride than the rich people
[20:50] got. He said, "I've seen," he said,
[20:51] "I've been with great men. got these old
[20:53] sleeves and cuffs and they make you
[20:55] think you're they make you think you're
[20:57] a great person.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Greatness is humility. Don't forget it.
[21:02] He says
[21:04] greatness is expressed in humility.
[21:07] Isaiah 57:15 says, "For thus set the
[21:10] high and the lofty one that inhabitth
[21:12] eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in
[21:16] the high and holy place with him also
[21:19] that is of a contrite and humble spirit.
[21:23] So he said, "I'm going to abide with you
[21:25] those as humble to revive the heart of
[21:28] the contrite ones."
[21:31] He's I don't mean dirty now. I mean
[21:33] humble in spirit.
[21:35] I don't mean just get out and go wash
[21:37] and clean up. I'm talking about
[21:39] humility.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Genuine humility. That's not a put on.
[21:44] You've seen a lot of people fake
[21:46] humility.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; I'm humble.
[21:50] You see, you know what I'm talking
[21:51] about. Put the word of God in your
[21:54] heart. Let the Holy Spirit come and
[21:57] watch the word move.
[22:00] Believe. Be humble. Don't desire to be
[22:03] something great.
[22:07] A humble, submitted heart in simplicity
[22:09] is what God is what brings you to God.
[22:13] A humble heart God loves.
[22:16] God dwells in a human heart, not in
[22:18] education.
[22:21] God dwell in your heart. And the lower
[22:23] you can break yourself down, the more
[22:25] simple you can become greater in the
[22:27] sight of God.
[22:32] I'm running out of time.
[22:38] I want to read this.
[22:40] Wow. I want to read this prayer. I'll
[22:44] stop with this prayer that Brother Ram
[22:45] did.
[22:47] He says, "Father God, keep these in your
[22:50] hands. They're yours. I pray God that
[22:53] we'll always walk humble before you. We
[22:56] don't know how long. We don't deserve to
[22:59] know how long. It's not our business.
[23:01] That's your business. It's not our wills
[23:04] to know when you will come. It's our
[23:07] It's our will, Lord, to keep humble till
[23:09] you do come
[23:11] &gt;&gt; walk with you. It's our desire for you
[23:14] just to let yourself be known once in a
[23:16] while, Father, among us, that we can see
[23:20] that we're still walking with you.
[23:22] Forgive us of our past sins. Guide us,
[23:25] protect us from every snare of the devil
[23:27] for the future. Lead us and guide us, oh
[23:30] God, our father. Forgive our sins, and
[23:34] help us to be your children. We're a
[23:37] poor class of people. were outcast by
[23:39] the societies of the world, by the
[23:40] denominations of the churches. We see
[23:43] the end. We thank thee for spiritual
[23:45] eyesight into thy word to see the end
[23:48] time. For all these things must come to
[23:51] the great
[23:53] stoning from heaven. Help us, Lord, not
[23:56] to be here at that day, but to be gone
[23:59] into your presence to fly away into your
[24:02] bosom. Amen. God bless you.
