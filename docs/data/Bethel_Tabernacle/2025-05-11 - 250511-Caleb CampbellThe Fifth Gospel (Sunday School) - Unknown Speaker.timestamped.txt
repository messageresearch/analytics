[0:21] Amen. God bless you this morning to be
[0:23] in the house of the Lord. if you don't
[0:25] mind those that are here just come
[0:26] standing with me and we're going to read
[0:28] our text here out of Proverbs
[0:32] going to do
[0:34] two portions of scripture um Proverbs 22
[0:38] just one verse 22 and verse 6 it says
[0:41] train up a child in the way that he
[0:44] should go and when he is old he will not
[0:46] depart from it amen and then if you turn
[0:49] over to Proverbs 31
[0:52] we're going to catch verse 10 and then
[0:54] verse 27 and verse 28. Verse 10 says,
[0:58] "Who can find a virtuous woman for her
[1:00] price is far above rubies." And then
[1:03] moving down to 27 says, "She lookth well
[1:07] to the ways of her household and eateth
[1:10] not the bread of idleness. Her children
[1:12] arise up and call her blessed, her
[1:14] husband also, and he praiseth her."
[1:17] Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we
[1:18] thank you for the reading of your word
[1:20] today. Thank you for just Lord coming
[1:22] together and being able to worship you,
[1:24] Father. Pray you just open up this word
[1:27] to us, Father. Be with the Lord, the
[1:29] musicians as they prepare. Be with the
[1:31] minister as he prepares to bring the
[1:32] word, Lord. And may Lord, just during
[1:34] this Sunday school, we just be able to
[1:36] give you glory in something. We ask it
[1:37] now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:40] God bless you this morning as you take
[1:42] your seats.
[1:44] So today is Mother's Day. Amen. So,
[1:46] happy Mother's Day to all the mothers
[1:49] out there, all the moms. Um, I just had
[1:51] it on my heart to say a few words this
[1:54] morning along the lines of that
[1:56] celebration. Um, amen. So, you know, one
[1:58] of the beautiful things that always
[2:00] sticks out to me is the self-sacrifice
[2:05] that true mothers have that true mothers
[2:08] really have towards their children and
[2:10] towards their family. Um, you know,
[2:13] there's a life that of course that they
[2:15] lead before they have children. You
[2:17] know, they they fall in love and and
[2:18] they get married. But when a child comes
[2:22] into the picture, it's it's almost like
[2:26] a new world has been created for them.
[2:28] Amen. And um, you know, it's just like
[2:30] when we come to the Lord, there's
[2:32] something about the correlation there.
[2:34] You know, it mirrors the new birth
[2:36] beautifully. And I think, you know, God
[2:38] crafted it that way. I think it's a
[2:41] monumental concept to grasp as
[2:43] Christians that when we've passed from
[2:46] death into life.
[2:48] Um
[2:50] it's not that we've somehow taken
[2:52] something new and planted it into our
[2:55] lives, right? Like we're just living our
[2:58] life and something was added to it like
[3:01] it's a piece of the puzzle. It's not
[3:03] supposed to be like that. It's an it's
[3:05] an experience that takes you out of your
[3:08] old life and puts you into a new life.
[3:10] Amen. Old things are passed away and all
[3:13] things are become new. Amen. And as I
[3:15] was thinking about that subject last
[3:17] night, I just began to ponder how that
[3:20] can get really twisted, you know, in the
[3:22] world that we live in, you know, in
[3:24] Christianity especially, but even in in
[3:26] parenthood in general, it's it's a
[3:28] misunderstanding that it's just a part
[3:31] of your life. you know it rather than it
[3:34] being a whole new life. Amen. Something
[3:36] my wife and I we were talking about and
[3:39] we've we've talked about this many times
[3:40] is is our life before we had kids and
[3:43] then life since we've had kids and you
[3:46] know the dramatic change that it plays
[3:48] into your life. You know, there's just
[3:50] there's no comparison. And but I've but
[3:52] what I've seen is um you know and I've
[3:55] had you know friends like this and and
[3:57] acquaintances that that in parents is
[4:00] that they have kids and what they try to
[4:02] do is that they try to fit their kids
[4:05] into their life,
[4:07] right?
[4:08] And it's and it's really sad. It's it's
[4:10] as if no real change takes place other
[4:13] than that now there's another person in
[4:16] the picture but no real self-sacrifice
[4:19] takes place. they don't actually make
[4:21] changes to their life. They're just
[4:23] cramming another thing into their
[4:25] schedule. Like, you know, sometimes it
[4:27] is almost as if it's an inconvenience
[4:29] when in reality it's one of the greatest
[4:31] blessings that can ever take place.
[4:34] Amen. Um now I know that anybody that
[4:37] has kids there is a certain amount of
[4:38] sacrifice inherently that takes place
[4:41] just by the nature of it you know and I
[4:44] get that you lose sleep you know they
[4:46] cost money things are different and I
[4:48] get that those things are sacrifices but
[4:51] I believe that there is another layer
[4:53] that goes into this kind of sacrifice
[4:56] that I'm talking about something that
[4:57] goes beyond just kind of the physical
[4:59] things you know you start to put your
[5:02] needs you start to put the needs of your
[5:05] children above your own needs and above
[5:07] your own wants and above your own
[5:09] desires. You don't try to fit them into
[5:12] all of your needs and your wants and
[5:14] your desires. You, you know, they're
[5:16] it's it's just a totally different life.
[5:19] Amen. Um, you know, you start to realize
[5:22] that it's more than just it's it goes
[5:24] far beyond just putting food on the
[5:26] table and having clothes and having a
[5:28] roof over their heads. You know, those
[5:29] things are important and those are part
[5:31] of it, but it's a greater there's a
[5:33] greater depth to it.
[5:34] Amen.
[5:35] I was reading through a message Brother
[5:37] Random preaches um titled Mother's Day.
[5:40] Amen. And he uh he's actually quoting
[5:43] the the movie The Ten Commandments. So,
[5:46] so I don't get in trouble. I'm just
[5:47] going to read what he said. Amen. Um he
[5:49] he's talking about Moses, his mother,
[5:51] Jockabed. And he says, I believe it was
[5:52] the Ten Commandments, the late Cecil
[5:54] Deill, that wrote and put this on
[5:56] screen, one of the masterpieces of the
[5:58] movie world. And before it was put on
[6:00] the scene or let out, Cecil Deill called
[6:02] Oral Roberts and Deeus Shicarion and a
[6:05] bunch of the full gospel ministers and
[6:07] took them into his own studios and
[6:09] showed the four hours of the Ten
[6:11] Commandments and asked them their
[6:13] opinion of it, God rest his gallant
[6:14] soul. And when I seen it, I was looking
[6:17] at it and a little remark always stuck
[6:19] out to me. If uh many of you who did see
[6:22] it, it was the daughter of Pharaoh.
[6:24] After Moses had found that he was a
[6:27] Hebrew and he decided to go dwell with
[6:29] his people. And there sat his once
[6:31] beautiful mother faded out with her gray
[6:34] hair and her wrinkled face sitting in an
[6:36] old armchair, a typical mother. And the
[6:38] Pharaoh's daughter came in, which is the
[6:40] mother that had adopted him, and said,
[6:44] "Who?" And Moses said, "Whose son am I
[6:47] anyhow?" And when it was brought to
[6:48] light that Jack Jacobed was his real
[6:50] mother, the daughter of Pharaoh with her
[6:52] paint and so forth and all fixed up, she
[6:55] said, "But look, he may be your son, but
[6:57] she said, I give him wealth and
[7:00] splendor. You could have given him
[7:03] nothing but the slime pits." And but the
[7:06] aged old gray woman, gay-headed woman's
[7:09] mother said, "But I give him life." And
[7:12] that makes the difference. I give him
[7:14] life. God gave him eternal life. and how
[7:16] true the mother is there. I just began
[7:18] thinking about thinking about Moses's
[7:20] real mother and how she had made such an
[7:23] impact on him. Even though that she was
[7:26] forced to give him up, God made a way
[7:28] for her to nurse that child. I always
[7:30] I've always been so amazed by that, you
[7:33] know, that God made a way even though
[7:35] that, you know, that was a really a
[7:36] tough time if you put yourself into her
[7:39] shoes. you know, for a couple of months,
[7:41] the Bible said she hid her son because
[7:43] at that time, Pharaoh was trying to kill
[7:46] all the boys. And so, she hid her son,
[7:48] but then the Bible says that there came
[7:50] a time where she could hid her son no
[7:52] longer. So, then she and Miriam crafted
[7:55] that little that, you know, that little
[7:57] they weaved that basket and they put him
[7:59] into that basket. I mean, you think of
[8:00] the the trust that this mother had to,
[8:04] you know, put in God to do all these
[8:05] things, you know, and all all the stress
[8:08] that was involved in this situation and
[8:10] put him he put him in the basket and and
[8:12] and then, you know, basically was knew
[8:15] that she was going to have to give him
[8:16] up. Um, and there's no specific age the
[8:19] Bible says, but you know, I just was
[8:21] kind of just doing some research and
[8:22] around that time in history, you know,
[8:25] nursing a child, weaning a child could
[8:27] have been all the way up into three,
[8:29] four, five years old. And so, even
[8:32] though that Moses grew up with the
[8:35] wealth and all of the splendor and all
[8:39] of those things naturally that he would
[8:41] need, none of that kept him from what
[8:44] God called him to do. And the impact of
[8:48] of her influence in him lasted her, you
[8:50] know, her his whole life.
[8:53] Um, Brother Bam says this in the
[8:55] invasion of the United States. I I just
[8:59] some quotes this morning. It says to you
[9:00] little mothers here this morning that's
[9:02] been real mothers. I know there's many
[9:04] of you. I think every one of you. Uh,
[9:06] let me just tell you something. God
[9:07] bless you. You're the fifth gospel. I
[9:10] think let me tell you what now for your
[9:13] children. just a little thing because uh
[9:16] brother Neville will probably preach
[9:17] about mothers tonight or whoever. Um but
[9:19] let me tell you something. Let me ask
[9:21] you something. Remember when Moses was a
[9:22] little boy, it was a mother who gave him
[9:25] in his instruction. It was a godly
[9:27] mother who took little Moses on her
[9:29] knees and said Moses and taught him awe.
[9:33] He was her teacher or she was his
[9:34] teacher rather under Pharaoh. Now these
[9:37] things said Moses someday you're going
[9:39] to deliver the children of Israel.
[9:40] You're the boy that's called. Keep
[9:42] yourself pure and unspotted from the
[9:44] world for you're the one. You are the
[9:47] one. No other place do we know where he
[9:49] ever went to any s seminary or teaching
[9:52] he he ever got. He stayed right in
[9:55] Pharaoh's palace which was heathen. But
[9:57] his mother taught him. That's a real
[10:01] mother. She taught him the precepts of
[10:03] the Lord. She taught him how he must be
[10:05] holy. She taught him how and what he
[10:08] must live and how and what God must do
[10:11] and would do for him. And it stuck with
[10:13] Moses all the days of his life. And any
[10:17] good true loyal mother that that'll take
[10:19] her little babies instead of send them
[10:22] send sending them to picture shows and
[10:23] dances and so forth like that and she'll
[10:25] put them on her lap and teach them about
[10:29] the the Lord Jesus Christ, you know. And
[10:32] I I'm so blessed that I had a mom like
[10:34] that that taught me about the Lord. I'm
[10:36] so blessed that I have a wife that has
[10:38] that desire in her heart that that puts
[10:40] the Lord Jesus, you know, at the top of
[10:43] the list. Amen. And everything else is
[10:45] underneath that. And I thought about
[10:47] this is just the title this morning was
[10:49] the fifth gospel. I thought about what
[10:51] brother Brandham calls the mother as the
[10:53] the fifth gospel because he does that
[10:56] cuz it m they make such an impact on
[10:59] their kids as they grow up, you know.
[11:01] You know, contrasting just today's
[11:03] society of motherhood,
[11:06] the fifth gospel has become the daycare
[11:08] that they attend. It has become the
[11:11] school that they go to. It has become
[11:14] all of these other things and and it has
[11:17] taken the place of what God had intended
[11:20] for the fifth gospel to be. Um
[11:24] I I found this quote. I'm sorry for all
[11:25] these quotes this morning, but I just um
[11:27] how the Lord led me and this struck me.
[11:30] It says, "You know what? I think
[11:31] everybody has their own opinion, but one
[11:33] of the greatest, to my opinion, the
[11:34] greatest president that we ever had in
[11:36] this nation was Abraham Lincoln. Not
[11:38] because he was a Republican, but because
[11:40] he was a godly man and he was raised to
[11:42] serve God. And he said, "If there's
[11:44] anything I want to give praise for, or
[11:46] my life was influenced by was a godly
[11:48] mother who taught me to pray and to know
[11:50] Jesus as my savior. Oh, your family is
[11:54] what you are. Your and I, and I, this
[11:57] caught my attention. You raise your
[11:58] children in a certain environment and
[12:00] it's got a 98% better chance to go right
[12:04] than it has if you bring it up in the
[12:06] wrong way. Bring up a child in the way
[12:08] that it should go and when it's old, it
[12:09] will not depart from it. Be brought up
[12:12] right. Teach your children to do right
[12:13] and be honest, to be square and fair,
[12:16] and even when they're in school. The
[12:17] Bible says that we are written epistles
[12:21] read of all men. And and I just thought
[12:23] about that scripture just to carry it,
[12:25] you know, a bit further. I believe that
[12:28] we are, you know, as parents and
[12:30] especially mothers that we are read most
[12:32] of all by our children because we spend,
[12:35] you know, the most we spend the most
[12:37] time with them. Um, and when a mother
[12:40] gives up her desires and she gives up
[12:42] her hobbies and she gives up her
[12:45] physical well-being for a season, you
[12:47] know, I think that is read by the
[12:50] children more than anybody else and it
[12:53] has a lifelong impact on them. Amen. And
[12:56] you know, because even if they never say
[12:59] it or they maybe they never even realize
[13:01] it, they recognize how important they
[13:04] were in their mother's life. And that it
[13:08] in itself can make a true impact. You
[13:11] know, you see somebody and I don't know
[13:13] if you've I mean, I'm sure everybody in
[13:15] this room in this church this morning
[13:17] has been in the presence of somebody who
[13:19] doesn't give them the time of day. Amen.
[13:22] You know, you're talking with them and
[13:24] they're looking at their phone. you
[13:25] know, they they you know, they stop
[13:27] paying attention to you. You know, they
[13:29] you know, you're you're you're you're
[13:31] this high to them. Everything else is
[13:34] more important. And kids above anybody
[13:36] else, I think, really feel that and and
[13:38] know the impact of that. And when we as
[13:42] believers and as fathers and as mothers
[13:44] can really give up some of those things
[13:47] even things that we love. I mean it's
[13:49] not saying you can't have hobbies and
[13:51] you can't have these things but you know
[13:53] just inherently it takes it takes those
[13:56] things away. It puts them on a shelf for
[13:58] a long period of time and then you give
[14:00] yourself over to those kids. And if you
[14:02] don't do that, I believe that the kids
[14:04] can really know and they I mean, even if
[14:06] you don't ever say it, they know because
[14:08] they see what are you doing with your
[14:09] time, you know, what are you investing
[14:11] in? Are you investing in me or are you
[14:13] investing in these other things? You
[14:15] know, and I just I think they recognize
[14:16] how important they were. There's this um
[14:20] there's this wicked queen in the Old
[14:22] Testament. Um I was reading this about
[14:24] this this morning. I'm sure we're all
[14:26] familiar with it. Not much is spoken
[14:28] about her but her name was Athaliah and
[14:31] she was evil. She was the wife of King
[14:34] Gerro um there in the reign of the
[14:37] kings. Um he was the king who did wicked
[14:39] in the sight of the Lord out of many and
[14:41] he was the one who died of the bad in
[14:45] intestinal stomach disease. She was so
[14:48] evil that at one point she took an
[14:51] opportunity
[14:52] to eradicate the entire royal family or
[14:55] so she was hoping it would do uh
[14:57] eradicate the whole family which meant
[14:59] that she actually killed her grandkids
[15:01] and she was almost successful in taking
[15:04] out her the royal family but there was
[15:06] the one that survived but during a time
[15:09] in this in this span of history she did
[15:12] actually reign over the land for for a
[15:14] time and she did a lot of wicked things.
[15:16] She was known for her violence
[15:18] establishing Baal worship. And what's
[15:20] amazing is funny enough is that she was
[15:23] also the daughter of Jezebel.
[15:26] Amen.
[15:26] And I read this statement, you know, and
[15:29] we all know who Jezebel was. You know,
[15:31] she did she did and was everything
[15:33] except what a true mother was. Amen. Um
[15:36] I read this statement from the National
[15:38] Library of Medicine, this medical
[15:40] website, and there's this hypo
[15:42] hypothesis called the cycle of violence.
[15:45] The cycle of violence hypothesis
[15:47] predicts that individuals exposed to
[15:49] child abuse are more likely to be
[15:51] physically violent in adulthood and it's
[15:53] well supported by literature. However, a
[15:55] growing number of studies suggest that
[15:58] child neglect may be equally predictive
[16:01] or more predictive of adult violent
[16:05] behavior over child physical abuse. Now,
[16:08] Athalia obviously had quite a bit of
[16:11] neglect in her life. Her dad was raising
[16:14] up idol worship in the kingdom. Her mom,
[16:16] Jezebel, like I said, was doing
[16:18] everything except being what she was
[16:20] supposed to be, which was a mother. And
[16:22] then their child had was raised up in
[16:24] this environment. And we can see the the
[16:28] product of that neglect and how sad that
[16:30] was. Um and and you just think of it
[16:33] today and all the children raising up
[16:34] and you know with even modern science
[16:38] which is what people look at even modern
[16:40] science telling us that children that
[16:42] suffer neglect are incredibly likely to
[16:46] turn out the wrong way and think of the
[16:49] neglect. I mean brother Brandham talked
[16:50] about it back in the 50s and the 60s and
[16:53] talking about parent delinquency and
[16:55] think of the neglect that takes place.
[16:57] It's not child abuse isn't you know
[16:59] there there is child abuse and I know
[17:01] that takes place but child abuse can
[17:04] also happen in the form of neglect and
[17:06] you know we ran into this family and you
[17:09] know they spent less than an hour a day
[17:12] with their kids you know they went they
[17:15] took their kids to school it was you
[17:16] know just three or four years old and
[17:18] then you know they took them to daycare
[17:20] because they paid for daycare and then
[17:21] when they took them home they just put
[17:23] them right to bed and they had
[17:24] absolutely no influence on on the
[17:26] children and I recognize in the society
[17:28] we live in, there are situations that,
[17:29] you know, people, you know, they have to
[17:32] both individuals have to work, but I
[17:34] think there are sacrifices that can be
[17:35] made to spend more time with your kids
[17:37] and not have that kind of neglect. Amen.
[17:40] Um, and it just stirs something up in me
[17:42] as a father, you know, and I know it
[17:43] does all of those godly mothers, it does
[17:46] the same thing. And and um just some
[17:49] encouragement this morning. You know,
[17:50] brother Brandham, and we talked about
[17:52] this in that quote, brother Brenham
[17:53] often refers to Abraham Lincoln and how
[17:55] he attributed much of his faith-driven
[17:57] life to his godly mother, you know, and
[18:00] Abraham Lincoln said this, this was a
[18:02] direct quote from him. He says, "No man
[18:04] is poor that has a godly mother." And
[18:08] what I thought was incredible, I just
[18:10] looked up what at what age was Abraham
[18:12] Lincoln when his mother died, and he was
[18:14] only 9 years old when his mom died. So
[18:17] she had that much of an impact on him um
[18:21] you know in his very early childhood. Um
[18:24] and the impact of her prayers and her
[18:26] influence lasted his entire life. Uh you
[18:28] know and he also refers to John Wesley.
[18:30] He had all those children and still
[18:33] found it uh so important to spend all
[18:36] that time in with the Lord. Char Charles
[18:39] Wesley's mom, John Wesley's mom. Uh and
[18:42] another one that I found uh was Charles
[18:44] Spurgeon actually makes this statement
[18:46] of his mother and said, "Never could it
[18:49] be possible for any man to estimate what
[18:52] he owes to a godly mother." And I just
[18:56] thought how amazing that was. Um, you
[18:58] know, and and I just want to say this
[19:00] morning that, you know, um, all of what
[19:03] I was saying, you know, wasn't directed
[19:05] at anybody in here because I see godly
[19:08] mothers in here and I see, you know, and
[19:10] I'm so blessed to have all of all of
[19:12] those all of you in our life. And I know
[19:14] your kids are equally as blessed. I just
[19:16] wanted to give a little encouragement.
[19:18] May God bless those those gallant
[19:20] mothers who are the fifth gospel, you
[19:23] know, to their children. May May the
[19:24] Lord richly richly bless you and
[19:26] encourage you in your heroic efforts.
[19:29] You are a blessing that is priceless.
[19:33] Amen. An absolute priceless blessing to
[19:37] God bless you. Let's just pray. Heavenly
[19:39] Father, we thank you for this day, Lord.
[19:41] We thank you for all that you are and
[19:43] all that you do for us, Lord Jesus. We
[19:45] thank you for just uh this opportunity
[19:47] to be in your house. Lord, we love you.
[19:49] We just commit our ways to you now. In
[19:50] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
