they're never going to get me to not preach I never got to get me to compromise the word amen but this ain't that so we're gonna work cooperate with them they're starting to open up and hopefully next

scriptures this morning amen to Revelation chapter 10 praise the Lord happy to have sister Dorothy back on that organ today that is awesome amen so we we made some exceptions I mentioned that that there were going to be some other personnel some necessary personnel who were not you know sister Dorothy would be L so you'll see her this weekend next week amen I haven't made a decision about Wednesday night yet just for those of you are here and who's listening I may I'll do one of two things either allow this same a through J to come again Wednesday or Wednesday we may just go back to our skeleton crew and just wait for the next Sunday I'm not decided yet I want to try to find out from the governor's office what their because today was a little bit gray area for us brother Kevin was trying to get to the bottom of it and ironed it out specifically for churches and it's a little ambiguous so we're trusting a men that we we won't get in trouble for doing this today I don't think we will I think we're fine and so we're we've got a plan in place and I think we can demonstrate that amen I had a young and I know I need to get to a prayer request I remember I see if I wrote it down yeah I've got that coming but I want to get this prayer yes sir brother Brad the ties and offerings basket is at the back so rather than pass it we're just going to put it at the back sister Wanda sends in a prayer request our house in Virginia goes on the market tomorrow please pray for a quick sale above I love that pray for a quick sale above asking price man hallelujah above more than you can think arrest that's what the scripture says I did that friends I've proven that one time I sold an old junk car at a car sale yeah and they couldn't even drive it in they had to push it in and when they went and the engine was running but was gone and they pushed it in and mains were gone and smoke was rolling out from under the hood and they're screaming shut it off shut it off and I literally was going to take $100 for the car you know I had children to feed and I needed I needed that hundred bucks and so I rolled it in there and they started bidding and I didn't hear what they were saying neck and eye but I laid hands on that car out in the parking lot and these are my words I said Lord according to your word let it bring more than I can think or ask and I was thinking of $100 and and and and and when they're you know and the and the and the auctioneer turns me said son would you take $500 for it and I was so frozen but Jack got I just stared I know I think he thought I was thinking about it that's when yeah he goes so a man so sister Wanda we are gonna pray that it go for a quick sale above the asking price she said we need the Lord's intervention on current challenges with this thank you amen I had another one that I'm just sure that came in and I apologize that I didn't put it where it needs to be and I don't see it presently I do one that I do remember is that we wanted to pray for brother Mike walls him and his wife both with the illness the the coronavirus that got brother Charles but I was testifying to those brothers I said the Lord brought our brother back to us and so we're going to just be praying for brother Mike and his wife up there in Virginia now also brother Charles Mullins wife I hope she hasn't passed there was an urgent cry went out to the ministry chat I was in yesterday about brother Charles Mullins wife the doctors have pretty much said this all we can do and she's hanging by a thread I don't I haven't got any word that she's passed away but I really want to call on the Lord today to have mercy on that case but let's let's get to our scripture reading this morning and yeah that's a greeting from brother Bruce and sister Linda wishing all the mothers a Happy Mother's Day like to say that today all you mothers wishing you a happy birth Mother's Day amen praise the Lord and will he'll have to do that again next week in all fairness don't y'all think we'll have to do it again next week to make it fair so god bless you if I catch that other request I'll get it here momentarily but let's read let's let's go to the Lord in prayer before we read father we thank you for this group of people here today thank you for the singing O Lord what a joyous song to step to the platform on Lord Sutch singing you will hear never heard by mortal ear will be glorious I do declare in God's own son will be the leading one you'll be the leading singer you'll be leading us Lord in a celebration extraordinaire I pray father that you hasten that day we want to be there so bad and Lord but yet we know if we're still here we must still have a mission to finish so help us to finish up strengthen us Lord and the power of your might grant it today remember these sick requests Lord we're asking you mercy for sister Mullins today master I just pray in the name of Jesus you'll lay your hands upon her in mercy just as you did for us Lord for our brother Charles father brought him back from the edge and Lord just before the enemy was able to grasp him he but you had more purpose for him Lord so you saved him from the clutches of the now may it be so for our sister made me so for brother Mike and his wife Lord a shepherd and the wife their stricken down but Lord your more than able so father we're sending forth this prayer let the holy spirit go to that need right now I pray granite Lord for sister Wanda and brother Michael to sell this house when it goes on the market we're asking very specifically that it sell quickly and that it's Ella but what they could think or ask granite Lord may you grant it I've seen you do it Lord many times even testifying of one time but I've seen you do it many times Lord in my experience so I commit it to you now and bless the reading of the word bless the speaker and hers and Lord if there's any other prayer request that I'm just forgetting I I know you're aware of it Lord and so I pray father there are a couple of things you know that are on my heart that I won't speak out here at the pulpit but I'm praying for those and assured people that I would be praying and so I'm committing that to you Lord in the name of Jesus that you will make all of these things Lord just beautify it all lay your hand and bless it Lord look toward it and it'll be blessed of the I commit it now to you in Jesus name Amen and in Revelation chapter 10 we're very familiar reading to us but I'm gonna read a little further than you would normally read beginning verse 7 and I think I sent brother Kevin I think I sent you verse 9 but we're actually starting in 7 I apologize but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the now I want you to catch these next words the mystery of God should be finished it's finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from heaven spake again spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take Heat he said unto me take Heat I take it and eat it up I'm sorry and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me again thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying arise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall be tread under foot forty and two months may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated god bless you now you'll notice that I read straight out of chapter 10 and just carried on into chapter 11 and so I went from chapter 10 verse 11 straight into chapter 11 verse 1 we read verse 1 and 2 you need to remember that chapter and verse segmentation was added to the Bible years later many years later and actually when John wrote it it was a continuous letter just like Paul's letters they're continuous sometimes you know when you're reading something and you read a chapter and something Paul teaches and Paul teaches in abstract ways anyhow and you don't fully get it sometimes if you just read a little bit of the chapter ahead and a little bit of the chapter following you'll catch it more clearly because understand Paul didn't write it in chapters and verses Paul just wrote a letter and later on translators decided arbitrarily you know but we believe that our Bible is inspired of God but they put the chapter and verse in so so I I read to you this morning about how that we he goes from the eleventh verse of chapter 10 because if you if you'll notice that that chapter 10 kind of ends in a cliffhanger it doesn't really conclude anything it just simply says I was told to go and ask for the book I went and asked he said to eat it here's what will happen I did and it happened and then he said to me verse 11 thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings okay okay and okay so what does that mean and but but you you realize that God is going to make a very clear line between that Gentile church that's taken from the earth and his two prophets Moses and Elijah which go forth during the tribulation so as soon as the bride is taken the tribulation begins the time of Jacob's trouble the last half of the 70th week three and 1/2 years 42 months and so but but you you want to realize that that with what brother Branham taught us from the scripture and in numerous places we're going to look at today that you will see that that chapter one I'm sorry chapter 11 verse 1 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein so now he's got to measure a people who worship in the temple and who are in fact the temple so the Bride of Christ the New Testament church she is the tabernacle of God's dwelling place so you're still what you're reading is is you're reading the final measurable perfection of this bride who ate the book amen so she didn't just eat the book and go off preaching listen friends we didn't just get the seals and this thing's just going to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on we as I read to you when the seventh angel comes the mysteries finished and so there's got to come an end game to this there's got to come a time where where you know that seventh and last star he only had seven and that last star has already been deployed did its mission and recalled you understand and now the last thing is for the bride to eat that open book because she's got a prophesy she's going to be the final voice to the final age but but now does she just go from here on and how long do we say well we're just the final voice well we're just to find a voice well we got to lay in the presence of the Sun and ripen well how long do you think you got to ripen how long do you think this is going to last I mean let me let me tell you something you got to get it out of your mentality that we're just going on and on and on you can't just go on and on and on this thing has to come to a conclusion and I believe and we don't know but I believe that what we're seeing already might be the very catalyst that sets up one thing after another till the world is spinning off into chaos and the Lord comes and extracts a bride in a secret catching away so we're seeing here the and you'll notice that when he differentiates between in verse two but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not see because because that's given to the Gentiles the holy city shall be tread under foot forty two months so now you've got the the remnant the unwise virgin who were who never made it into the Holy of Holies do you understand they never were born again they believed unto salvation amen that's that's what the Bible teaches and brother Branham makes it clear the foolish virgin are saved they don't get saved in the tribulation they're already saved from destruction but they're not born again they haven't passed from death to life like you have they still come to the judgment in chapter 25 of Matthew's Gospel of the Gospel of Matthew they in chapter 25 they stand before the throne to be judged and be separated from the unbelieving world because they were believers and they're granted eternal life at that judgment bar but the bride who are in the who are in the temple worshiping they're in the Holy of Holies they've went beyond the veil and they themselves in fact are the temple of God's presence they are measured because the bride listened the bride is coming to her perfection and this signals that she's been taken home in the last the last night the last idea that we get the last description is she's a measured perfection of the presence of God's dwelling amen now now let's look at that as we go on down all right now any fees and 610 um let me get that brother Kevin I didn't send that but see if you can put that up for me real quick Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 Paul says here to the Ephesian Church finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might if you don't get it brother markets alright because I'm getting ready to switch over to my powerpoint at any rate but finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might you know I when we talk about this thing coming to its finish and and now I've got to move into a very precarious take some very gentle steps here so that I don't give the wrong idea and I want to be very circumspect at how I say this you know we're in unprecedented times and uncharted times the whole world is saying that it's there's never you know we've had global pandemics but never to the point where the world was such an interconnected one world that a global pandemic goes around the world by jet airplanes and crashes the economies of the world and and and literally now it's already this pandemic has been has been so politicized I'm gonna take something friends it's hard to know who to believe of course there's an illness of course there is there always has been but but but to say what level should it be and what level should we worry and what level should we fear and what's really working and what's really not because if you've been tracking it what we should do and shouldn't do has changed what what should be allowed and shouldn't be allowed has an altered and they're literally figuring it out as they go in that's fine I get it it's it's it's they're having two world economies you know where the medical community they're having to figure this out as they go and they can rely on some some old trusted and true methods of science and it's panning out good but then some are saying but hold on that might not be a hundred percent we got to wait and see we don't have all the data I'm here to take something friends uh we're in a time where this word is to come to it's finished cycle and I'm here to tell you something friends that the word of this hour will demonstrate itself so there comes there must come a difference you know there the the balance is that you know it's it's it's not ah then this whole idea of operating in prudence which you should versus operating in fear which you should not and it's particularly bad to operate in fear especially after you've been told don't fear Jesus told us what would happen at the end time and he said this will happen and this will happen and this will happen and this will happen and brother Branham comes along and says it'll be this this this this and Jesus said you know even when Peter doesn't understand he said you don't understand now but you'll know later and and you know and so we we we now see things and Jesus said I tell you this now so that when it happens you'll know that I've told you so I'm gonna tell you something friends what we're seeing what the world is just in a panic-stricken and and now it's already polarized politically and you don't even know who's trying to work behind the scenes for a political agenda you don't even know I'm not suggesting I know I'm just simply saying I I know that I know this is true I know he's real I know faith is real I know that this word of this hour in all of this time of uncertainty will demonstrate itself and I know that we can put faith in it and put confidence in it and you're going to have to you think that this you think I mean you've got some scientists saying you know it's the second third wave no it's not going to happen and then you've got other scientists with more letters following their name than these guys who are saying it's not only going to get worse it's going to get much worse you've got the head of the World Health Organization saying it's going to get much worse you've got former CDC former Surgeon General's are testifying to Congress no question it's going to get much worse and you know one side of politics can say this the other side can say that this doctor can say this another one you got this one on YouTube saying this and this one on youtube saying this I mean I mean the madness you can see the chaos that the people face and everybody is running in fear because of fear of the unknown which is what's happening is a fear of the unknown and and so look so so now now they've already got this new strange by-product or after effect of Cronus now striking down children when they formerly told us children are pretty much immune from it well now there's they're finding out oh that's actually not true and and I hear them say the fact it is what they literally the woman when I just heard recently by that Governor of New York said we're understanding that that fact is no longer a fact like great so it was a fact and then it does suddenly a time and now it's not a fact anymore well if it's not a fact anymore it never was a fact and the fact is you don't know what the facts are that's a fact I'm here to tell you something friend but here's a fact this word is true and his presence is here and I am his family and I do have faith and I do have the Holy Ghost because what are you going to fear next anyway as soon as this one's over another one's coming and another one's coming they say when they caught me they don't even know what's yeah well you know a president saying I can turn around and another and other economists saying no way it's happening this year maybe a year maybe two maybe three maybe 10 I don't know I don't care I'm not staying hallelujah I'm just here to tell you today I get prudence we have been operating in prudence there are people here today who are who decided not to come in prudence and that's perfectly perfectly fine god bless everyone who is acting in a prudent all things by faith pray yeah and and make up your decision it were totally okay with it I'm just saying don't be afraid be prudent but don't be afraid because there's one thing coming and then another and then and then another and you're gonna have to finally put your foot on the word and put your back against Calvary and say this far and no further and I will not back up any more because this word do you believe we have a message do you believe the seals are open do you believe a messenger finished his course then this thing has to demonstrate itself and that's brother Branham says that over and over and over it the word will demonstrate itself if you just believe it so this message I mean think about it friends come on this you say oh that's just a nice idea well is it I say to you the word will demonstrate itself you can put confidence that the word will be there when you need it say oh well we speak this into existence and speak that and restore missing limbs and brother Brandon believe we might see all of that understand but but but catch it now in every case of the third pull it was never brother Brandon making a decision I think I'll operate the third pool even Jesus didn't do that Jesus only moved by what the father showed him and it was time it demonstrated Jesus didn't make it demonstrate Jesus just simply stepped in and cooperated with the vision and God's Word begin to manifest that's all brother Branham did he's in the woods yeah what are you here for honey squirrel how many you need to need a mess how many's a match-three ok say where they'll be and brother Branham said I was just there I guess he did it you know he's the one who said brother Branham was running for the camp and God said stop turn around and go back up into that storm and speak to it so it's never been about you having to figure it out what your mission is is to fill your mind so full of the word that the devil can't get in there he don't have any room to cause you to down to cause you to be carnal to cause you to live in fear to live in failure fill up your mind with this word because when it gets ready and needs to demonstrate itself it will if it can through you I can tell you right now there's no way it can demonstrate itself if you're operating in fear say well listen to a fine line between acting and four how do I know it's the same Act I'm not gonna do this certain thing and how do I know if it's prudent I don't know if it's fear I mean come on friends you pray you know I mean you ever hear the saying you know somebody you make a statement to them and they say look me in the eye and tell me that again now what are they doing they're looking you in the eye and and if you are telling the truth you can look them square in the eye and repeat what you just said if you're not confident of what you're saying you think you're shading a little bit your eyes will dart around even psychiatrists know that you'll you'll stumble you'll pick it you'll deal you'll you'll cross your legs you look sideways they have they know when people are lying they have psychological ways but when you can look look that person in the eye and with no even on a lie detector that's measuring your pulse and measuring your heart rate and it wouldn't change and you can repeat that again we say well then how do I know if I'm operating in fear or if I'm operating in prudence look God in the face have that kind of a prayer life now you never knew that if you ain't got that kind of a prayer life if your mind is filled with the world you'll never be able to have that kind of confidence but I'm here to tell you I know that I can I can look God in the face and I can say Lord I'm doing this because I think it's prudent it has nothing to do with fear and I'm here to tell you I can look him in the eye and say that now if I look him in the eye and I and I realize that I'm gonna realize and I'm not unique you'd realize looking God in the face when you're in prayer and you know how to pray and you're used to being in the presence of God you know if you're afraid you say I don't want him to see that he might rebuke me no he'll heal you of it if you're afraid be honest and say Lord turn my fear to prudence it might be the exact same action I might take the exact same action but the motive behind it's gonna be different the fuel that this engine is burning is either going to be prudence and wisdom or fear might be the same action I'm not I'm not here to tell you what action you need to take or not take knew not do go not go have not have I'm here to tell you have your mind filled with this word that God finished and gave to an angel who gave it to you and you're feeding upon it listen friends you say oh that's that's fine I get it we had a message seals are open a word came we got a message it's the bleeding word it's Christ it's word I get in all the cliches all the cliches but it still seems like a metaphor to me well let me just point something out to you that that the word that might just seem like a a nice thought to you do you realize that had that word not come the whole earth was doomed to be destroyed with a curse from God but God said I'll send Elijah before I do that and here we are believing Elijah's message and you've become a believer of it and I mean come on open your understanding and say wow it's true I I have been redeemed from that certain destruction I know that this word has actually saved my life it saved my soul it opened my mind it gave me the realities of heaven then why would it not demonstrate itself in our world when we needed to come on the scene if it's already saved you from a certain destruction it's already separated you from the world why would it suddenly go oh well you know I could do the harder thing I could save your soul and open your mind and open your understanding so you see the word but as far as these viruses and things that are coming I'm sorry I can't help you with those really it's already done the greater work how would we not imagine it can do the lesser work say and and again I'm not here to say yeah I've already taken a stain on this way this isn't tribulation citizen treatise just for the illnesses the virus might have another one extra we had some other years they come through people get sick I get sick you can say any one of us are apt to get sick so what do we do we wash their hands we've got a particular strain that's making a lot of people sick and people are dying so we're social distancing where we're taking extra measures of steps we're hoping the summer well we'll see it abate and we're hoping by the winter if it comes back we'll have some treatments or vaccines or whatever I don't even know I haven't even determined how I feel about all that stuff but I'm just here to tell you that that in my mind I'm already saying Lord I've got to trust your word at some point because this ain't going to get better it's already only getting worse now they got want something with small children well what's next say well that's pessimistic well what what what these small kids wasn't a reality a couple weeks ago it is now what's to say in a couple more weeks don't seat some other kind of I don't know reality I'm just here today something friends God sent us a message that he said when it comes it will finish it will finish in a profit ran a profit finished it and we have the word and I can see in my Bible that we come to the measurable perfection of his dwelling place so I think today that that when we talk about Christ in the kingdom of Saints I could say to you today that this is Jesus and his temple Christ and his kingdom of saints is Christ living inside of his temple which is you amen so I want to fill up my mind with discernment you're gonna need that the world is a shaking place and shaking harder and harder every 24 hours it's not gonna stop as I said when this thing first started I don't even know what we might even see some some measure of normalcy we're already trying to get back to that today's more normal than we were last Sunday and hopefully in a few more Sunday's it will just look like nothing ever happened but I'm here to taste something friend there's been a wound on the psyche of mankind around the world it ain't gonna heal it ain't gonna go away and the next little thing is going to put more fear on him than this one did and I'm here to tell you I don't plan to be that guy I don't plan to be part of that gang that gets into more fear than we already have to deal with here I'm just saying I want to fill my mind up with discernment real discernment say how do I do that I'm not a prophet the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy and so breath my brother Brendan would say the real prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ that really Liza is the Lord Jesus Christ so so we have the word that comes to us fill up your mind with his word and you'll fill up your mind with discernment and you'll fill up your heart with prudence and you drive out confusion from your mind and you'll drive out fear from your heart and I'm gonna tell you something your families brothers men listen you need to be able to look like the Rock of Gibraltar to your wife and children and to your family you know you know the Bible says quit yourselves like men in other words you know buckle up come on I mean let's let's let's be men about this God called us as men and Paul said I write unto you young men because you're strong see and the old man because he's wise so so let's fill up our mind with discernment by filling up our mind with his word empty out a lot of the world that's in your mind empty out all the things that Laodicea don't be about Laodicea be about that Jerusalem which is above have your citizenship have your mind let let your let your your your hope motive and purpose in life be to say Lord we're at a climactic moment and I can see today that this thing can't just keep going on and it's gonna continue to get worse and I plan to dig in right now and put my feet on the Word of God and say I believe the word and I am I am taking steps to fill my mind with this word so that I push out all the poisons of Laodicea and in so doing I will push out any fear that's in my heart and prudence and wisdom and faith will arise and faith got muscles all amen muscles are not a whole lot of value on the physical frame I've I've seen I mean you can you can see all kinds of videos of little small guys who probably weigh a third or half you know fighting some big guy two and a half times their size but but they're not afraid at all not afraid at all they go right and take that big guy right to the ground all they say is the bigger is the harder he falls and they knock them out and they put them in submission and they put them on the ground and I mean you know what does that because their confidence it's never been the size of the dog in the fight it's the sight of the size of the fight that's in the dog and so I'm gonna taste something friends fill up your heart with God's Word fill up your mind with God's Word because you're more than a match for anything Satan can try be prudent use wisdom these sensible pray use discernment but whatever you do don't let fear rule in any of your decisions even if your decision is identical doesn't matter if it if it's a fear if this is the decision whether it was prudence and wisdom or fear it's the same decision but let but at the end of the day be able to say to the Lord and look him in the eye and say Lord I'm doing this because I believe it's what you would have me do it has nothing to do with fear and if you can't look the Lord in the eye and say that then stay down and pray stay down and pray some more and say Lord take this fear out of my heart see doesn't mean you'll make a different decision it just means the motive the engine the fuel that's making it will be different if I I'm gonna taste something friends personally if you want this a little personal advice from brother Jason if I detect fears driving me out on purpose do the opposite on purpose I'll do it or die if I find myself afraid to do something that I think the word is calling for me to do and I'm afraid to do it I will close my eyes grit my teeth and go forward if I fall off a cliff I don't care I'm not brother branham said that brother branham said I'd rather go down in defeat than be a coward I'd rather lose the fight then then be a coward and just like when they when they challenged Billy Graham you know and that and that that guy said I tell you what dr. Graham you know you line up 50 or however many 30 or 50 sick people over here and I'll line up 30 or 50 sick people over here and every time you hit one out he'll one and the man knew he couldn't heal anybody but he also knew the Billy Graham couldn't and Billy Graham wouldn't take the challenge wouldn't take the challenge said I don't have that you know God don't work like that in the morning brother branham said oh my goodness he said I wish that I called me said I wish that a clay sadhana took it he said Otto a brother went down in defeat them to let that infidel pipe off like that we're gonna tell you something friends it's time to be bold and have faith in the Word of God hey man I will we might need to be more prudent than we're being now I don't know I'm not suggesting what we should do and we don't even know yet what we're gonna face I'm just simply saying when we get there let's have faith let's have wisdom let's fill up our mind and our heart with the word so that wisdom and faith have a way to operate through us hey man we are the temple we're the measurable perfection I've taught you this out of Revelation 11 but I've never I thought it occurred to me the other day I said you know I've never really connected all the dots for the people with the quotes in the scripture so watch so let me let me show you uh how brother Branham covers this ah let me see if I think I've got it I'm trying this for the first time all right so let me do that and then I guess I can do that yes perfect that works so Christ and the key and the kingdom of Saints part 3 the tabernacle of his dwelling place the tabernacle of his dwelling place working brother Kevin okay did that go to my next one it it it did all right putting on the whole armor of God now watch because I'm gonna go quote scripture quote scripture I'm gonna show you brother Branham didn't pull this out of thin air he's a word prophet all right putting on the whole armor of God just like the word in the beginning was spoken to us in the Garden of Eden spoken word and I got that in the Garden of Eden catch this he's gonna make a he's gonna he's drawing a picture there was a spoken word in the Garden of Eden the second time it was made flesh and dwelt among us you get that the third time it become part of us when the Holy Ghost dwelling in us God coming into the man you get that all right so now so so we looked in here he says again first spoke the word the enemy tore it down remember in the Garden of Eden don't read ahead of me let me dummy let me read at my pace remember the enemy tore it down in the Garden of Eden right then the Word was made flesh say praise the Lord well he was crucified so it was spoken word he tore it down it was made flesh he crucified it but now amen there's a difference in the word the word has become the church and the church is the word all that God was important to Christ all Christ was poured into the church the Holy Ghost now the enemies got something see then he isn't fighting something back there I'm here to tell you some friends are supposed to be a fight happening God didn't come into the church to not fight jesus said my if my kingdom my subjects were here they would fight for me they weren't there at the moment the holy satting come but it was common and when they came out of an upper room it's not we're not fighting we don't beat the air we're not are our weapons aren't Warfare's of swords and spears but we do have a sword of faith we do have a shield of faith we do have a helmet of salvation hallelujah and so where to arm ourselves and fight so many people aren't fighting too many of God's family are like Samson who was God's family and they're laying in bed with Delilah and too many of God's family are laying in bed with Laodicea come on that's a strong statement but it's the truth and that's that's a lot of times why you don't have the discernment you need that's a lot of times why you don't have the wisdom you need and you get in the spot and you need it to demonstrate itself and it would if it could a man all that God was reporting Christ all Christ was important in church the Holy Ghost now the enemy's got something see then he isn't fighting something back here all right now let's look at first Corinthians 3:16 no you're not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you now I read to you revelation 11 he's measuring the temple and all those who worship therein not the outer that's given to the Gentiles they're headed into a tribulation 42 months they're not even measured because they're not born again they're not the perfection of the word only those who are there in dwelling therein that's the temple of God 2nd Corinthians he says when he writes to him again and what agreement has the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people now a lot of people love the idea of him dwelling in you but he's not interested in merely dwelling in you he wants to walk in you you understand so he doesn't just want to be a nice idea or a correct teachable doctrine he wants to be able to live and manifest himself brother brother Jason was speaking on that this morning in his Godhead teaching that it's God manifesting himself and here he comes now he wants to be what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people all right you still with me he's still with me all right now brother branham comes to a hidden life he says now this 1955 this setup and I'm gonna do this in chronological order the setup of God's Tabernacle in the wilderness the first was the congregation then the holy place then the holiest of Holies that's that's the part that got measured in revelation 11 that's God's house that's God's dwelling place that's your dwelling place so in revelation 11 the last thing we see of the Gentile church in verse 1 and going into 2 is God measuring his dwelling place and not on purpose not measuring outside of that ok so now watch that's your dwelling place now you only live in three room house remember you may have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens but whoa and women love that three kitchens but you only live in a three room house God lived in a three room house when God was here on earth he occupied a three room house the soul body and spirit of Jesus Christ in the temp in the tent in the temporal temple see in the temporal temple he's in a congregation holy place and holiest of Holies that the holy the holy of holies isn't actually a scriptural term it's called the most holy place but it's the same thing each one of them was separated one from another you see he measured those who dwell in but he's separated he didn't measure those out you understand each one of them was separated from one another and each one had different furniture in it to show the dwelling place now look at that a very beautiful type of the church this is that's why when I look at 11:1 I'm seeing the church I'm seeing the last testimony of you all right now watch or go to back to Paul Ephesians 2 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom he also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit right now brother Branham comes to 1962 we were in 55 now let's look in 62 he comes to the message the stature of a perfect man and I'm always cautioning the people not statue we got enough statues in the message not looking to establish you as statues statues don't move in there lifeless a man if you become a statue will sit you out in the road amen we want people in the stature of the of a perfect man but now watch because it got titled that and with brother branham's blessing but it but that but brother Branham announces his subject then this morning here's what the subject is about this morning we want to speak on the subject the building the Living Tabernacle building the building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place the perfect man so you're when you come to revelation 11 1 you're seeing a perfect man you're seeing the bride in her perfection so perfect so perfect she's measurable why she measured to prove to the devil to the world that she fit every measure of the Word of God no wonder we had to have seven seals open no wonder we had to have the word become a lie because we couldn't go as a deformed bride we had to be the perfection of the word if you've got the perfect word making you the perfection of the word then why would you live in fear over things that are happening in the earth see the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells the Holy Ghost here he comes to the end of the message he's going to some it's a summation the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the Living God's place isn't that beautiful Paul comes to Hebrews 3 for every house is builded by some men but he that built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all his house truly he was as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but Christ as the son over his own house whose house are we if we hope if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope Fermin to the end it doesn't do me any good to have a house if if squatters and trespassers are living in it God doesn't want Leo to see our living in his house he wants his house to be filled with film see brother branham comes now to 1964 the future home I love that title the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride see the this is the earthly bride it's finishing out he doesn't leave us chapter 10 you know and like I said mankind made it ten eleven and then eleven one jaundice wrote it continuously and if you stop it verse 11 of chapter ten you're left with an uncertain there's no ending it's just it's just out there it's a it's a cliffhanger how does this end what happens well read the next verse that she's now become the perfect tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place watch future home but there was the Redeemer on earth at that time to redeem those attributes of God and she received it she never questioned it she said when Messiah cometh he'll do this and that settled it and she's seen it done so he said I'm the Messiah so that settled it no more question she just went telling everybody come see what I found these processes make us clean a temple for his dwelling place justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire that does the cleansing of our this temple so so we we realized that when when when eleven one speaks of a temple being measured I go back to my Bible and back to the message to figure out what's this temple he's talking about I think I've made my case this morning and I'm here at a friend's it's a challenge to you to say put me down I want to be in that number I want to become the measurable perfection I want to be the dwelling place the fullness of his presence in my life here's another one look at what Peter says here now I before I turn to Peter I've been saying to you how that that if we're preaching on Christ and the kingdom of Saints then when we so many places in the Bible I haven't spent a lot of time doing it but what I'm about to read does it a lot and that is that it literally gives us if we're if we're if we're Christ and the kingdom of Saints then there ought to be Kingdom principles for this life if we're going to be part of a kingdom then there's got to be what makes us a kingdom you know because you're prettier than the denominations because you got better teaching than denominations the devil don't even care about your teaching it's not a bit worried about that than anything he's not afraid of how much knowledge you have and understand and unable to unlock you know symbolism and types and shadows in the Bible and put it all together what he's afraid of is you becoming the temple of God's life that's what he fears is that you will literally not know the word but be the word hallelujah that's why Jesus never had to never need to carry a Bible he didn't need to carry an Old Testament Bible he was the word walking around when he stood against those doctors of divinity he just he just started it starts coming out of him it what came out of him as natural as anything why because he was the fullness of the word watch so brother so Peter says here wherefore now here's some kingdom principles there's some kingdom principles this ain't all about just you know a thorough preaching where we all just have a big big big joyous dance and we don't never come down and put it down into the gears because he said I want to dwell in you and I want to walk in you see now here's how he walks in you wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes he's telling you how to be a kingdom how many more to be a kingdom member as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby how many want to grow if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men see they don't like the word they never have they've always been against it as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye all so he's not just talking about Jesus ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so God was God never lived you know in the end the man Christ Jesus just to stay in one single body he's now moving into a temple see that that's why you remember we read the quote here just a few frames before where he said in the Garden of Eden it was spoken word he tore it down and then it became flesh and then he crucified it and brother and said but now it's in the body that's what I was telling you a couple services ago they've been trying to kill the Holy Child since since Genesis they've been after the golden child well they'll never find the holy child because the holy child is now the Holy Ghost living inside of a church hallelujah he's living in me oh is he living in you today say Lord living me help me to get all these trespassers out of your house and out of my mind and out of my heart make my temple clean for the Holy Ghost I have oh I don't know how to end it brother Kevin that's that's my last slide um there you go you know I I've lived you know a Christian life for many years and I I was looking I I pulled this note and I've amended it a little bit because I pulled it out of an old file and it just meant so much to me in this sermon as I read it again and I and I and I I said some years ago about how that I've lived the Christian life for many years and you know something friends there the world is full of doubters full of atheists and agnostics who just who'd just stand in your face and defy the name of the Living God see and but to which to which I say to them they've written they've written songs about it you know one of the one of the most famous songs john lennon ever wrote was you know about you know what if there's no heaven above us no Hell beneath us you know and and I guarantee he don't think that anymore and and I I just said this that I declare that whether or not I'm right or wrong whether I'm revelaed adore deluded I'm still the winner I'm stiff there was no heaven or hell I'd still want to live a Christian life see I'd rather live by the principles that Jesus left us even if there's no heaven or hell even if there's no life after this life and this is it I still win because I have lived a better life than all those who have not lived for him I've been happier by far than many others who have had much more of this Earth's Goods than me many people with with a hundred million dollars in the bank and lose ninety nine of those million jump out of a 50-story building because they're down to only a million dollars I've only got a million dollars left I better just kill myself I'm here to taste something friends I've been happier by far have not having that I didn't you know what i'ma tell you something friends here's something as since I've been a Christian that I haven't had to deal with I haven't give my hard-earned money to the enemy for partying and fancy living hey man I'm not in a doctor's office today because of a hard fast sinful lifestyle that wrecked my body and burn up my mind and I'm there nobody can help me I don't know I'm better having been a Christian I'm better in even when I've had to go to the doctor's office I've had a supernatural care over me to this day I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm here to tell you it's the power of God unto salvation and I'm happy to be a Christian I only wish I would have always been a Christian I have a happy home a happy marriage happy children happy grandchildren who all love the Lord I have happy friends all over the world who share my joy and share this faith I have a happy ministry associates who share the same common denominator that I possess I'm here to tell you something friends I'd be a Christian if there was no heaven or hell I didn't go to bed with emptiness I didn't go to bed with longing and searching and trying to figure my life out I already figured it out hallelujah and I'm fully satisfied I love declaring that to the Lord because when I say it I mean it I can look him right in the eye say Lord I want you to know you are more than enough for me you're more than enough for me and I'm only sorry for my miserable failures and weaknesses and I don't want them and I'm repenting afresh and fill me up again and clean out everything in the world let my mind be filled with your word because I want to have a life of the word I don't it doesn't matter if there's not a heaven or hell if it doesn't matter if this is yet I want it anyway it's a better life see we all come into the world dying the day you breathe air the clock's ticking you've got a you got her an expiration date I'm sorry only those who are alive and remain it is coming don't die so we're all dying I can't stop it it's eventual it's a certainty so I just want to keep my life in his hands and be grateful for everything I just want to keep my life in his hands and be grateful for everything when it's all been said and done and I you know I still have this crossing date and and I realized that say that's a morbid thought it's actually not because it brings me to a very positive thought I've very let me say a different word it brings me to a very productive thought because if I realize my mortality and I realize no matter what I do I can try to keep this body healthy but it's still dying I can do everything the doctor says and take all the vitamins I need but I'm still dying unless I go in the rapture I'm gonna die you understand so so then if that's if that's true then then here comes my question my productive question well then what am i doing about this short life that I've been given what am I doing with this short temporal temporary life that God has given me what do I expect my earnings to be on the other side I want to know when I reach my expiration date I want to know I counted for something eternal if it if your life isn't living for this purpose you have no meaning you're just going in a circle you're just you know you're just chained to Pharaoh's chariot and you're pulling him around you're his slave you're you you you're born in sin you you pull the devil around in his chariot like a slave and then you die and then you go to hell really and and and so you'd rather you'd rather be an atheist you'd rather be a sinner not me I'd rather turn to the one who who offers me life I'd rather talk not just life coming but life now life with purpose today and when I wake up tomorrow I have a purpose when I go to sleep night I have a purpose I want to know I counted for something more than chasing lair Tasya I want to know that I rose above mediocrity that I lived in the upper atmospheres where an eagle ought to live hallelujah Shakespeare is very famous for the statement to be or not to be his character Hamlet is literally contemplating death and suicide and you know bemoaning the pain and unfairness of life because life is filled with pain and unfairness I'm here to take some young people get this get this straight life ain't fair and if you just sit around sniffling and sulking in a corner because you got treated unfair you'll sit in that corner till you're dead cause life ain't fair at all life was meant to be a struggle brother man said people don't want to struggle he said struggles is good you need to struggle otherwise you don't never gain any strength you don't never do anything you don't never accomplish anything you don't ever overcome anything and Hamlet's it's contemplating death and suicide because of all the pain and the unfairness of life but he's acknowledging to be or not to be he's acknowledging that yeah wow there's lots of pain and unfairness uh should I kill myself I don't know to be or not to be because the alternative might be worse yeah it's pretty bad right here and maybe I should just end it all but jeez that the alternative might be worse and that's his that's his dilemma that's Hamlisch dilemma to be or not to be this is pretty bad I get treated pretty unfair all this bad stuff but this I really might make me I might go from the frying pan to the fire he tries to decide if living or dying is best all I wish you know where I was Shakespeare would have read Paul in Philippians chapter one for me to live is Christ and to die is gain I'm here to tell you it's not about to be or not to be it's I am because he made me and I'm here because he put me here and I got a purpose because he lives hallelujah and when this life's over it ain't over hallelujah when this life is over it ain't over it's just starting hallelujah Oh some glorious morning when we sit across that table thousands of miles long that's for real that's not disney world that's not pixar that's for real you're gonna be there you're gonna reach across and take the hand of Moses and Abraham so I read about you all my life hallelujah no more sorrows no more troubles that were weariness no more old age no we're parting no more taxes no more anxiety no more stress nothing to worry about if my answer is to be and it is if Shakespeare one to ask me he's asking Hamlet Hamlet don't know I know if he's asking me to be or not to be then then my answer is to be then I intend if I'm gonna be if I'm gonna be then I'm gonna be strong in the Lord because that's my choice I couldn't save me that was his choice my choice is to be strong in the Lord I'm choosing to SS as Paul Paul said to the Ephesian in 610 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might so I intend to live in the power of his might this is both listen when Paul says finally my brethren ok Paul you got my attention what do you want to tell me be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might so if you're going to choose to be then be strong and live in the power of his might and I'm here to tell you that this is both that this is both a decision to be made and an accomplishment to achieve and I intend to Beit to make it and achieve it it's a decision to be made it's an accomplishment to achieve and I intend to make it and be it hallelujah to be here I raise my an what's your purpose his purpose what life do you expect his life what about your life I don't care about my life my life's worthless I want his life I want to be the measured perfection of his Tabernacle I want to be the very vessel of his dwelling place by believing his word be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mind he says to Timothy be there for my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus he says to the Thessalonians but let us who are of the day be sober see to be or not to be I've decided that I want to be I already know I I already know that doing more is not the answer I've preached that to you before as a personal testimony I found out from the Lord when I was looking him in the eye and I said I want to do more for you and he said I don't need you to do more I need you to be more I'll do the doing I need you to do the being so to be or not to be I'm gonna be I don't he doesn't need me to do more he doesn't need you to do more he needs you to be more so he can do more you will do more if he is more if the more he is in you the more control he has of you and I intend to make that decision and I intend to achieve it and I I don't want to I don't want to do more I want to be more I want to be strong in the Lord and the power his might I want to be strong in his grace that is in Christ Jesus I want to be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for a helmet the hope of salvation finally brethren 2nd Corinthians 13 finally brethren farewell be perfect how many want to be then be perfect said I want to be how many want to be then be strong how many want to be be sober be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind I don't need to do I need to be hallelujah be of one mind be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace here's the result and the God of love and peace shall be with you Peter says finally Brent finally be you all of one mind having compassion one of another love his brethren be pitiful be courteous I say to you today be him be him be the word that's what this message is about that's what it means to be Christ and the kingdom of Saints your life here has tremendous value to God that's why he put you here that's why he opened your eyes he has brother lineal sings he didn't have to open my eyes he could have easily passed me by for the age I was living in was wretched poor
