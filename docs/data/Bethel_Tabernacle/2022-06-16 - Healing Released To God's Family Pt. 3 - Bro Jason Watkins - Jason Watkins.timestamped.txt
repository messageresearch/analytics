[35:49] my lord is good isn't he
[35:51] god bless you
[35:53] this afternoon this evening we greet you
[35:54] in the name of the lord amen happy to
[35:56] have micah and ashley with us
[35:58] praise the lord so
[36:00] we're
[36:01] keeping one gonna try to keep both but
[36:03] we probably can only keep one for now
[36:06] amen so
[36:08] happy to have them and enjoyed all of
[36:09] that
[36:10] singing my goodness
[36:13] so uh
[36:14] you love god
[36:16] amen we're gonna look right into the
[36:18] word of god uh this evening and i wish
[36:21] by the help of the lord to continue
[36:23] we're gonna go to matthew 24
[36:25] and you'll notice that i'm changing
[36:27] around
[36:29] the text that i use each time
[36:32] and
[36:33] that's intentional because it's such a
[36:35] broad topic and tonight
[36:38] we're just carrying on uh in in the
[36:41] little
[36:42] uh series that we've been working on
[36:45] uh how many believe that god has sent
[36:48] healing into this hour amen he has
[36:51] released a healing to his family and and
[36:55] she needs it amen this was the terrible
[36:58] situation
[37:00] that
[37:01] that the kingdom of heaven faced and
[37:03] brother branham just said it simply like
[37:05] this
[37:05] the bride can't go in the rapture in the
[37:08] condition she's in
[37:09] and she's
[37:10] better
[37:12] so now you're stuck
[37:14] that's quite a conundrum you can't um
[37:17] you can't go forward you can't back up
[37:19] you just have to sit down and raise up
[37:21] your hands and say god have mercy on me
[37:23] well he did
[37:25] and so he the only one the only way to
[37:28] improve it was he had just had to come
[37:30] himself and take over the situation
[37:33] mankind man-made systems man-made
[37:36] organization had taken the church as far
[37:40] as it possibly could take it
[37:43] and it and as and with aft after all of
[37:46] its effort and all of its global
[37:48] outreach and all of its satellite
[37:49] television and all of its radio programs
[37:51] and and all of its missionary work um
[37:54] around the world it it had failed to
[37:57] bring the church to the condition that
[37:59] it could be taken in a rapture and it
[38:01] couldn't improve because the church
[38:04] booted christ out
[38:06] so now how are you going to get better
[38:08] see you the only one that could help you
[38:10] kicked him out
[38:11] so um fortunately that's part of the
[38:14] plan
[38:16] amen and he turns around and then calls
[38:19] a bride out of the church in the last
[38:21] days matthew chapter 24
[38:24] and i just want to
[38:26] um pick up i think i said verse i
[38:29] believe uh we're going to start it at
[38:32] 37 correct
[38:34] matthew 24 37 there's a lot we could
[38:36] read here
[38:38] but we're just going to try to be
[38:39] concise and let you be seated and then
[38:42] try our best to just carry on it's a
[38:45] little different for wednesday
[38:48] but i'm just in the middle of a series
[38:49] so we're carrying on we'll be carrying
[38:51] on sunday unless the rapture comes and i
[38:54] won't be here so if you show up sunday
[38:56] and the rapture comes and i'm not here
[38:59] i'm sorry but that's the way it's going
[39:01] to roll
[39:02] so
[39:04] so verse 37
[39:07] for as in the days that were before the
[39:10] flood
[39:11] they were eating and drinking marrying
[39:14] and giving in marriage
[39:17] until the day that noah entered into the
[39:20] ark
[39:21] and knew not
[39:22] until the flood came
[39:24] and took them all away
[39:26] so shall also the coming
[39:28] of the son of man be
[39:30] then shall two be in the field
[39:33] the one shall be taken and the other
[39:34] left
[39:35] two women shall be grinding at the mill
[39:37] the one shall be taken the other left
[39:40] watch
[39:40] therefore for you know not what hour
[39:44] your lord doth come
[39:46] but know this
[39:47] that if the good man of the house had
[39:50] known
[39:50] in what watched the thief would come
[39:53] he would have watched and would not have
[39:55] suffered his house to be broken up
[39:57] therefore be ye ready be also ready
[40:01] for in such an hour as you think not the
[40:04] son of man cometh
[40:06] i love this verse
[40:08] who then is a faithful and wise servant
[40:12] whom his lord hath made ruler over his
[40:15] household to give them meat in due
[40:18] season
[40:19] blessed is that servant whom his lord
[40:22] when he cometh shall find
[40:25] so doing
[40:27] let's pray
[40:30] master we thank you for your word now
[40:32] this evening
[40:34] and you see the
[40:37] lord my whole day now just thinking and
[40:40] pondering and
[40:41] noting and re-noting and
[40:44] and father trying to set some
[40:46] some order to things and it just seems
[40:48] like lord that
[40:50] you
[40:50] seem rather determined this evening
[40:53] lord to just
[40:55] force me into a more
[40:57] uh
[40:59] more
[41:00] relaxed state as it were to not try to
[41:03] figure it all out ahead of time now you
[41:06] know that's not my way it makes me a bit
[41:08] uncomfortable but at the same time lord
[41:11] i've always i've never seen you fail to
[41:12] come on the scene and just put it all
[41:15] together exactly how you want it to lord
[41:18] how you want it to be put together so
[41:20] now i just surrender write readily lord
[41:23] with no concern whatsoever i give it
[41:25] into your hands now in jesus name amen
[41:28] god bless you friends you can be seated
[41:31] i don't mean by any means to make you
[41:34] feel like that i'm
[41:36] not prepared
[41:38] i'm probably over prepared
[41:40] and that's probably the problem i'm
[41:42] having
[41:43] is because the the topic is so broad
[41:47] and uh i feel it is so
[41:49] important in fact as i have tremendous
[41:51] passion about this subject and so i've
[41:55] just been not in a battle with the lord
[41:58] per se but in a battle with my own self
[42:00] to try to keep my
[42:02] uh self out of the picture and not try
[42:05] to force it in the way that i want it to
[42:07] go and that never works anyway so
[42:10] it's pointless to try
[42:12] all right so
[42:13] so if you will just bear with me i want
[42:16] to just make a few statements that we
[42:18] uh finished with on sunday
[42:21] and one of the statements that we were
[42:23] making as we came down
[42:26] was the difference between the noise
[42:29] that you hear in the world and the still
[42:31] small voice that is the holy spirit
[42:34] speaking to us in these last days quite
[42:37] a contrast between those two they're
[42:39] almost incomparable and and in fact is
[42:42] the
[42:43] you know the world's answer
[42:46] to noise is just louder noise if i don't
[42:50] like what you're saying i'll just talk
[42:53] louder and then if you talk louder and
[42:56] try to shout me down i'll just shout
[42:58] louder and we'll just have a shouting
[43:00] match and right in the middle of the
[43:03] world screaming and shouting uh god
[43:07] slips in with a still small voice and
[43:09] it's so
[43:11] gentle and it's so personal that the
[43:14] world literally
[43:16] they don't hear it at all
[43:17] they don't understand what you what's up
[43:19] with you they don't understand why you
[43:21] are like you are and they have almost no
[43:25] concept of the
[43:27] the beauty that we see
[43:30] and enjoy
[43:31] in the presence of god
[43:33] i was today a rather remarkable thing
[43:37] happened to me
[43:39] i would probably have to say that all
[43:41] things considered and that's a pretty
[43:43] broad statement i don't want to take a
[43:44] whole lot of time getting sidetracked on
[43:46] it but you know when you're witnessing
[43:48] to somebody and i've been witnessing to
[43:51] people all over the world i'm and now
[43:52] what i mean when i say witnessing i'm
[43:54] talking about in a pulpit uh because you
[43:56] know it's not the same kind of not
[43:58] comparing it to that but i'm saying that
[44:01] one-on-one where you're witnessing to
[44:03] one or maybe a two or three couple
[44:05] people and that little small time where
[44:08] the lord is leading you to witness to
[44:10] somebody maybe because they're inquiring
[44:11] they're asking questions they ask the
[44:13] right question in the way that and the
[44:14] holy spirit's just faithful if you knock
[44:16] he'll open if you ask he'll he'll
[44:19] respond and so sometimes people don't
[44:21] like the response of the word but i just
[44:24] remind them you know you asked and so i
[44:28] might i might would have never said that
[44:29] to you but you asked me and so
[44:32] uh today was such a day and in that
[44:36] in that narrowly defined um
[44:40] way that i'm referring to of witnessing
[44:42] i would have to say it's probably the
[44:45] the greatest
[44:46] supernatural
[44:49] takeover of the holy spirit that i've
[44:52] ever encountered i was witnessing today
[44:54] to a businessman at a store that i
[44:56] frequented for almost 25 years i i met
[45:00] him and we were both much younger he and
[45:02] his wife and he owns a business downtown
[45:05] beaufort and i was in there today and we
[45:07] were speaking about a certain thing and
[45:09] he's um he's a very wonderful man he and
[45:12] his wife both and they are nominal
[45:14] christians rather on the charismatic
[45:16] kind of slash evangelical side but he's
[45:19] always he always loves to talk about the
[45:22] word of god he's
[45:23] but yet he's
[45:25] his questions are only ever surface deep
[45:28] and so you know i'm i'm always careful
[45:32] trying to you know because i believe
[45:34] that when you witness you should be led
[45:35] to the holy spirit
[45:37] and so i always want to be
[45:40] you know i want to keep it you know at
[45:42] that level if his if his only interest
[45:45] is just surface stuff i'll stay right
[45:48] there
[45:48] and until he goes a layer deeper and
[45:51] i'll go a layer deeper and as he'll if
[45:53] he'll keep opening up and keep going
[45:55] deeper and deeper i'll just keep going
[45:57] deeper and deeper and deeper
[45:59] and and so but that's never happened and
[46:02] we've always had a wonderful friendship
[46:04] we talk about the things of the world
[46:06] and the things that the book of
[46:08] revelation declares and he he's very
[46:10] curious about things like that he seems
[46:12] to love you know um and it's not un
[46:16] uncommon for you know for the world to
[46:18] love sensational things and especially
[46:21] if they go to a church where they're
[46:23] likely just hearing just they're getting
[46:26] just enough to leave them hungry
[46:28] and and so you know but over almost 25
[46:31] years it's never really went uh much
[46:34] beyond the surface and i'll just give a
[46:36] few quick answers tie a few scriptures
[46:37] together and always leaves him you know
[46:40] astonished and i walk out of the store
[46:42] saying if you only knew
[46:44] that's just that's child's play and so i
[46:47] but i've always i've always
[46:50] felt like lord why is it so why i there
[46:54] have been people that have expressed
[46:56] much less interest than this man uh who
[46:59] i have far less a relationship with
[47:03] like a fraction as much
[47:05] and and they they'll plunge into deep
[47:07] water and i'll give them deep thing and
[47:10] and suddenly they don't want to talk
[47:11] anymore and and you know your friendship
[47:14] never deepens but over the years you
[47:16] know this friendship has continued to
[47:18] deepen and continue to deepen and so
[47:21] today i was standing there in his shop
[47:23] and we got to talking and
[47:25] it's a very busy place and people are
[47:27] all the time coming customers coming in
[47:28] and out his phone rings my phone rings
[47:30] you know we can we have to get word a
[47:32] word in edgewise as it were
[47:34] and so today it turns out that as i'm
[47:38] waiting there for the customer he's got
[47:40] a customer when i walked in as soon as
[47:41] they exited we start talking about the
[47:43] item of business uh there why i'm there
[47:46] and you know i'm i'm done we're finished
[47:48] we get it all done i'm ready to leave
[47:50] and here it comes and he kind of follows
[47:52] me to the door which is not uncommon and
[47:54] he's starting to follow me you know he's
[47:55] starting to ask about you know what do
[47:57] you think about this and what do you
[47:58] think about that and you know in the the
[48:00] economy and and and and what's happening
[48:02] overseas and you know what we realized
[48:05] the power you know of the enemy in this
[48:07] last day and and i'm saying uh-huh
[48:10] uh-huh and you know we and it just and
[48:13] suddenly i notice it's starting to he's
[48:15] really stopped me
[48:16] and now he really wants to talk about
[48:18] some stuff and so i'm just standing
[48:19] there taking it in
[48:21] responding a little bit and all of a
[48:23] sudden he really starts turning the dial
[48:25] in deep and friends i stood there
[48:28] and i
[48:29] i said to my i started praying within
[48:30] myself i said lord is this the day
[48:33] is this the moment i've waited for
[48:36] more than 20 years
[48:38] and i've wondered
[48:40] when this time would come is this that
[48:42] time and curiously when i left my
[48:44] driveway
[48:45] i was my first trip out for the day so
[48:48] after meeting brother abraham almost 15
[48:50] years ago and
[48:52] sister debbie and i never back out of
[48:54] our driveway our first trip out of the
[48:55] day without bowing our heads and calling
[48:58] on the name of the lord you should never
[48:59] get in your car and drive anywhere your
[49:01] first trip out i get it if you're going
[49:03] to be in and out a lot but that first
[49:05] trip out i'm going to tell you something
[49:06] the lord has spared us so many times by
[49:08] just joining hands bowing our heads
[49:10] saying now lord we're heading out onto
[49:12] dangerous roads in a dangerous world and
[49:14] we need your care and we need your
[49:16] protection and we need your leadership
[49:17] because i don't know what i might run
[49:18] into and i need the holy spirit i need
[49:20] to know that i'm ready i want to be
[49:22] ready do you ever pray like that say
[49:24] lord i want to be used of you
[49:26] and so uh that and so normally sister
[49:29] debbie's is there in the truck with me
[49:31] we we are a lot together and by design
[49:34] and but today i was headed out by myself
[49:37] and i noticed unusually it was very
[49:39] unusual that as i started to pray
[49:42] i felt a very strong presence of the
[49:44] lord and i just kept praying and i just
[49:46] kept praying and saying i know i'm three
[49:47] four times in length longer than normal
[49:50] and i'm really feeling moved of the holy
[49:52] spirit and when i got done i'm backing
[49:55] out of the driveway thinking wow what
[49:57] was that and so i i'm driving now i'm
[49:59] heading into town and i'm gonna do a
[50:02] couple of things and and here i'm gonna
[50:04] stop by this business and all of a
[50:05] sudden here he is and he's starting to
[50:08] to do a deep dive and i'm standing there
[50:10] praying lord is this the hour
[50:13] now i don't know what'll be tomorrow
[50:16] i i don't know what what what what
[50:18] awaits me when i leave church tonight
[50:21] i'm just simply saying this is what
[50:23] happened to me
[50:24] and we stood there for probably
[50:27] and my friend for probably 35 or 40 uh
[50:30] probably 30 to 35 minutes
[50:33] he literally heard
[50:35] from genesis to revelation
[50:37] and i mean i went through the the seals
[50:40] and the very quickly and the messenger
[50:42] to the age and come out of her my people
[50:44] and and he's just like going
[50:45] wow wow wow wow wow
[50:49] and and i'm talking about world systems
[50:51] and there's no chance and there's no
[50:52] hope and how the how the rapture is a
[50:54] secret catching away and it's a
[50:56] three-fold mystery that of a shout and a
[50:58] voice of trump and the world's on heaven
[51:00] was silent the world's unbe it's
[51:01] unbeknown they don't understand that
[51:04] that's what's happening i said the
[51:05] rapture is happening right now and has
[51:08] been
[51:09] and i said since the opening of the
[51:10] seventh seal that happened in 1963 and
[51:13] that really he really got quiet then
[51:18] and because we're similar age
[51:20] and uh and he thought my
[51:23] and and we just stood there and i'm here
[51:25] to tell you something one one thing
[51:26] that's never happened
[51:28] is i've never stood in his shop and he's
[51:30] the one actually who said it not me
[51:33] i finally i got to the end and i said i
[51:36] said pat i said and i s and before i
[51:39] could even do anything he shook he stuck
[51:40] his hand out and shook him he started
[51:42] laughing he's like wow
[51:44] wow wow like what just happened and
[51:47] and i said well i said you heard a whole
[51:49] lot he goes yeah
[51:50] golly he's all the time saying that
[51:52] golly we've been talking 35 minutes and
[51:55] and he said no customers came in my
[51:58] phone didn't ring i said yeah my phone
[52:00] didn't ring and that never happens i
[52:02] don't think and here we here we go both
[52:04] of our phones are perfectly silent for
[52:06] half an hour space of a half an hour i
[52:08] don't know i just now thought of that
[52:14] and so
[52:16] and he was stunned he was shocked even
[52:18] his wife wasn't there to be to to
[52:22] be in the conversation
[52:25] she's a very nice lady i would have i
[52:26] would have talked with her there too but
[52:28] she might have
[52:29] distracted the conversation i don't know
[52:31] i just know god was in it now i don't
[52:32] know what'll happen but i know my friend
[52:34] has a lot to sleep on tonight
[52:38] and before i left he wants a church age
[52:40] book so will you pray
[52:41] will you pray
[52:43] hallelujah
[52:46] and uh
[52:47] and we're just he's kind of walking off
[52:50] staggering waving and i'm waving and all
[52:52] of a sudden now my phone rings and it's
[52:53] and it's brother brad and i just picked
[52:55] up my phone and walked out there i said
[52:56] brother brad you're never gonna believe
[52:58] what just happened to me i said i think
[53:00] i had one of the most supernatural
[53:02] witnessing experience i've ever had in
[53:04] my life
[53:05] but jack good to see you and sister
[53:06] kathy here tonight praise the lord
[53:08] and so
[53:09] so i it was just astonishing that that
[53:12] the world
[53:14] is so
[53:15] thirsty and they don't even realize
[53:18] how thirsty and how hungry they are
[53:20] sometimes you know you can get to where
[53:22] your appetite is so turned off and then
[53:25] and then but get around a good meal and
[53:27] catch a catch a whiff of some good
[53:29] cooking one time you didn't feel hungry
[53:31] then until you until you got that and
[53:34] you know i went through the house and
[53:35] sister debbie say are you hungry and i'm
[53:37] like no i'm not hungry right now and
[53:38] i'll be sitting in my office and all of
[53:39] a sudden he'll come by my nose and
[53:41] suddenly i'm hungry and i go walking
[53:43] there oh what are you cooking sweetheart
[53:45] uh you know i thought you weren't hungry
[53:47] well that was then this is now
[53:49] and
[53:50] and and
[53:51] and so i just i i feel almost like a
[53:54] giddy child because you don't have you
[53:57] wouldn't have a clue how much i i like
[53:59] this man and his wife and they're just
[54:01] such wonderful people so i don't know if
[54:03] you might have be wise enough to watch
[54:05] the service tonight pat if you're
[54:06] watching that okay buddy well anyway
[54:10] but it but it it was so this whole day
[54:13] has kind of been like that for me it's
[54:15] kind of been supernatural i i i had a
[54:19] brother
[54:20] uh well we got it on the prayer request
[54:22] list tonight and uh our own uh dear
[54:25] brother don sent me an urgent prayer
[54:27] request and he has a friend in a
[54:30] pentecostal church and who wrote a quick
[54:33] re request to him urgent please my wife
[54:37] the the devil has taken her and and
[54:39] she's gone crazy or whatever whatever
[54:41] the case may be and it's urgent and
[54:43] please the whole
[54:44] our whole church is astonished we don't
[54:46] know what to do can your church pray for
[54:48] us and brother don sends me an sos and
[54:51] as i'm sitting there in my office
[54:53] studying this material i had just heard
[54:55] brother branham i had just heard brother
[54:57] branham in the sixth seal talking about
[54:59] how that he says now i'm a little late
[55:01] coming out here he said because i had a
[55:04] emergency call and a and a man was dying
[55:08] and and it and his mother goes to this
[55:10] church and so we got a call that he's
[55:12] dying right now and and so quickly we
[55:14] had to go and pray and brother branham
[55:17] said just a little prayer and the man
[55:19] was standing on his feet a few minutes
[55:20] later and was perfectly fine and the
[55:22] place rejoicing and i'm thinking about
[55:24] that as brother don is talking to me and
[55:26] saying this is an urgent case and i just
[55:28] said i i just felt no fear this is
[55:32] nothing but what i just heard on a tape
[55:34] and i said brother you and i right now
[55:36] we'll bind together we'll agree and i
[55:38] just began to appeal this case to the
[55:41] king of kings and i just said lord i'm
[55:43] asking for your mercy and i don't even
[55:45] know what the case is or why this woman
[55:48] would would be under some kind of
[55:49] demonic control but i i know this the
[55:52] bible says mercy rejoiceth against
[55:55] judgment and so let it be right now oh
[55:58] god in the name of jesus christ that you
[56:01] will bind that devil and let the holy
[56:03] spirit deal with this woman
[56:06] i said to brother dawn i don't know i
[56:07] said i i don't know what will happen but
[56:09] i believe god heard it i know this he
[56:11] heard our prayers
[56:13] and brother don even sent me a picture
[56:14] and here's a picture of a smiling young
[56:16] woman
[56:17] very
[56:18] in the prime of life beautiful just a
[56:20] happy woman
[56:22] and the next picture and it's almost
[56:24] doesn't look like the same person
[56:26] and in one picture she has
[56:28] brother don even is commenting notice
[56:30] her eyes are a lovely shade of blue and
[56:32] in this picture the whole face is
[56:34] contorted and the eyes are jet black and
[56:37] she's just staring into the camera and i
[56:39] just felt such compassion i'm here to
[56:41] tell you friends if the bride can't have
[56:43] compassion who can
[56:45] if it's not you and i who are are
[56:47] who are moving heaven as as the bible
[56:50] says he spoke in isaiah and when he
[56:53] spoke the post and the pillar moved i i
[56:55] want to post in the pillar to move i
[56:57] want to hear the voice of god i want to
[57:00] be part of a bride in the last day who
[57:03] under who knows christ and who knows how
[57:05] to contact christ and who when we send
[57:08] up a prayer god moves and angels start
[57:12] moving
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:18] i thought about
[57:21] the text that we read tonight
[57:24] and it's interesting because
[57:27] if i would have started
[57:29] the 24th chapter of matthew is riveting
[57:32] and it it's largely so misunderstood so
[57:35] much of it in fact is it's part of the
[57:39] i would say maybe the three
[57:43] most misunderstood
[57:45] misinterpreted
[57:47] and and there's three
[57:48] misinterpretations
[57:51] that i can there's probably more than
[57:53] that but three big ones
[57:55] that literally have
[57:56] have have have
[57:58] have hamstrung
[58:00] the christian world
[58:02] from seeing
[58:03] what god is doing
[58:05] and the first is a misunderstanding
[58:08] a misinterpretation of matthew 24.
[58:11] and then there and brother branham goes
[58:13] to that in the sixth seal because
[58:14] they're
[58:15] they come out and they're starting to
[58:16] ask him questions because he just
[58:18] preached a sermon that left everybody
[58:19] stunned
[58:21] and he starts talking about the end of
[58:22] the world and
[58:24] and one stone won't be left upon another
[58:26] and and the end shall come and all these
[58:28] things and now the audience goes home
[58:31] without a whole lot of understanding in
[58:32] the disciples
[58:34] take him privately say now
[58:36] now declare unto us and
[58:38] and what what do you what do you mean
[58:40] what's what shall be the sign of thy
[58:43] coming
[58:44] and of the end of the world when shall
[58:46] these things be when there won't be one
[58:48] stone left upon another and brother
[58:51] branham points out and this is what the
[58:53] world is largely missing this is why
[58:54] they can't make the book of revelation
[58:55] fit
[58:56] because they don't understand they've
[58:58] got they're trying to apply
[59:00] all three things to the end time and
[59:02] they're not they're not applied directly
[59:04] to the end time the first of all the
[59:06] time when there won't be one stone left
[59:07] upon another is when titus comes in and
[59:10] sacks jerusalem and and and and then
[59:13] there's another about the end of the
[59:15] world and and then there's a whole other
[59:17] question about the sign of thy coming
[59:19] see and so what what's what's one of the
[59:22] signs of his coming well what was a sign
[59:25] of his coming
[59:26] the first time was an elijah prophet
[59:30] and so the world didn't receive the
[59:33] prophet or
[59:35] his prophecy
[59:37] and in fact is the the relig the people
[59:39] did but the religious leaders rejected
[59:42] mess prophet and his message and so when
[59:46] christ come who was the who was the
[59:49] manifestation of his message they of
[59:50] course rejected him too
[59:52] and that's why jesus challenged him to
[59:55] say you know was john of god or was he
[59:57] not of god and they they were
[59:59] a religious
[1:00:01] the leading religious
[1:00:03] movement of the hour the leading
[1:00:05] denomination of that day
[1:00:08] was trapped
[1:00:09] in a simple word play by jesus that they
[1:00:12] dared not even answer the question
[1:00:16] because if they if they said john was
[1:00:19] of god then jesus is going to say well
[1:00:22] then why didn't you believe what he said
[1:00:24] about me
[1:00:26] but if we say he's not of god because we
[1:00:28] can't dare
[1:00:30] say that this is the christ so then if
[1:00:32] we say well he's not of god then we're
[1:00:34] afraid that people will kill us
[1:00:36] because they see him as a prophet and so
[1:00:38] here the religious world is i i can't
[1:00:42] get my mind around that level of
[1:00:44] hypocrisy
[1:00:46] i mean how do you sleep at night how do
[1:00:47] you go forward knowing you're a died in
[1:00:49] the wool hypocrite
[1:00:51] and god is watching
[1:00:54] and god knows your heart i mean how how
[1:00:57] could anybody be a secret sinner
[1:01:00] how do you how do you endure life how do
[1:01:02] you go from day to day i tell you i've
[1:01:05] got plenty of mistakes but i don't leave
[1:01:07] them in secret i bring them to the altar
[1:01:09] and i say lord god forgive me help me
[1:01:12] lord i don't want to be that kind of a
[1:01:14] person
[1:01:17] because i i want to i want to be a
[1:01:19] vessel that he can use
[1:01:21] here at the end time and it has it has
[1:01:24] zero to do with trying to stand out in
[1:01:27] the world you know we're not trying to
[1:01:29] impress the world with great power and
[1:01:31] signs and demonstration that's already
[1:01:32] been done it didn't work in jesus day it
[1:01:34] didn't work in the disciples day didn't
[1:01:36] work in brother branham's day so if we
[1:01:38] could just have that discernment if we
[1:01:39] could just raise the dead
[1:01:41] that's been done
[1:01:43] and brother brandon would preach a
[1:01:45] sermon
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:47] every theologian in the
[1:01:49] in the building would sharply disagree
[1:01:52] with and he would say now if i've told
[1:01:54] the truth
[1:01:55] he'll come and re he'll come and prove
[1:01:57] it and then guess who came and guess who
[1:02:00] proved it and it got proven until they
[1:02:02] were left astonished and they couldn't
[1:02:05] say a word against it but it still
[1:02:07] didn't change their mind because the
[1:02:10] secret is that if the if the gene of god
[1:02:13] is not there no miracle or no amount of
[1:02:16] miracles and no one raised from the dead
[1:02:18] it will not move them and if as gene of
[1:02:21] god is there no miracle is even
[1:02:23] necessary there's just something that
[1:02:25] happens down inside you and that the
[1:02:28] jehovah eagle comes with his talents and
[1:02:31] begins to rip layers off of your mind
[1:02:33] and open your heart and suddenly the
[1:02:36] holy spirit starts pouring in and you
[1:02:38] can't run away from it
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:45] and i
[1:02:46] i thought to myself wow
[1:02:48] of all of these things and they
[1:02:51] they don't understand his questions and
[1:02:53] so therefore they
[1:02:54] they don't understand his his answers
[1:02:58] and that's that's one of the
[1:03:00] items and then of course
[1:03:02] they they don't understand they can't
[1:03:04] place the book of revelation because
[1:03:06] they don't understand that
[1:03:09] they look at the sixth seal and they say
[1:03:11] well everything
[1:03:13] everything has to must be in the
[1:03:14] tribulation period and and and and
[1:03:17] therefore if the if the sixth seal is
[1:03:20] only unveiled in the tribulation period
[1:03:22] then then you're never going to be able
[1:03:24] to make the trumpets and the vials fit
[1:03:26] because they're they haven't they're
[1:03:27] having a a revealed impact on the earth
[1:03:31] right now and have been
[1:03:32] have been for for since for 2000 years
[1:03:36] but the world is unaware of why the
[1:03:39] world is the way the world is
[1:03:41] and they don't realize it's because of
[1:03:43] what the book of revelation says and
[1:03:45] these things are our prophecy has been
[1:03:47] controlling history but since they put
[1:03:49] it all off into the future what they
[1:03:51] don't know is that a sixth seal is
[1:03:54] partially opened all the way back
[1:03:56] at the dawn of the 20th century what
[1:03:59] they don't know is that every seal was
[1:04:01] partially open down through the ages and
[1:04:04] they don't realize that that triggers
[1:04:06] the trumpets and that triggers the vials
[1:04:08] and you know the last vial that was
[1:04:10] released it was released into the air
[1:04:12] and that's why we have a neurotic age
[1:04:14] and the madness on the streets and
[1:04:16] there's a reason behind all of the
[1:04:18] madness you see
[1:04:20] and i'm not going to get bogged down
[1:04:22] into that tonight well we'll go there
[1:04:24] sunday and i'll lay it all out and
[1:04:25] explain it to you
[1:04:28] but i said all that just to say this
[1:04:32] that there is and we're going to prove
[1:04:34] sunday
[1:04:36] there there is scriptural
[1:04:39] very clear
[1:04:41] that will make sense to you i promise
[1:04:44] it'll make sense to you why the world
[1:04:47] is in the condition it's in
[1:04:49] and it's not an accident and it's all
[1:04:52] being driven by prophecy and you say
[1:04:54] well then what's your sermon about
[1:04:56] tonight my sermon about tonight and the
[1:04:59] real burden that is on my heart is how
[1:05:02] that when he goes down to describing our
[1:05:05] day as it was in the days of noah and we
[1:05:08] know that that's the hour that we live
[1:05:10] in but he comes down to these verses who
[1:05:12] then is a faithful and wise servant whom
[1:05:16] his lord hath made ruler over his
[1:05:18] household to give them meat in due
[1:05:21] season blessed is that servant whom his
[1:05:23] lord when he cometh shall find so doing
[1:05:27] while the world is looking trying to
[1:05:30] understand the mysteries of revelation
[1:05:32] and they're trying to look at the
[1:05:33] sensationalism and they want to know
[1:05:34] what the dragon is and the beast they
[1:05:36] want to know what this power is in the
[1:05:37] antichrist and the whole world is going
[1:05:39] crazy a bride isn't that's that's not
[1:05:42] even the that's not even our main trust
[1:05:44] my main thrust tonight is to say lord
[1:05:47] i'm caught in this time and i want to be
[1:05:49] a servant found faithful
[1:05:51] when you come and you have come and
[1:05:53] you're here i want to be faithful
[1:05:56] that's all i care about that's all that
[1:05:59] matters to me is that when he has
[1:06:01] arrived he said i find bethel tabernacle
[1:06:04] faithful i find the ministry faithful i
[1:06:08] find the young people faithful and
[1:06:10] that's what's on my heart tonight
[1:06:14] that's what's driving me
[1:06:17] and i can only hope that's what's
[1:06:19] driving you
[1:06:22] because if you're not even careful i
[1:06:24] know this as a bible teacher
[1:06:26] that if you you know especially in the
[1:06:28] book of revelations it's extremely
[1:06:29] sensational and
[1:06:31] people can just get
[1:06:33] mesmerized in all of the symbolism and
[1:06:36] yeah and it's almost like a almost like
[1:06:39] a gluttonous ravenous you know just tell
[1:06:42] me all the mysteries tell me all the
[1:06:43] mysteries
[1:06:44] oh okay so i fill your head full of
[1:06:47] theology then what
[1:06:52] then i've only made you more culpable
[1:06:57] when you come
[1:06:58] to the presence of god
[1:07:02] you're coming to
[1:07:04] a place
[1:07:06] that is either the safest place in the
[1:07:08] world
[1:07:09] or the most dead dangerous
[1:07:12] that when people
[1:07:14] who were dying
[1:07:16] came to his presence sincerely
[1:07:19] they left living
[1:07:21] and people who came perfectly living
[1:07:24] insincerely
[1:07:25] left dead
[1:07:30] you you need to understand that this
[1:07:32] message that god has brought to us in
[1:07:34] this hour
[1:07:35] it's not about theology
[1:07:37] it's about a person
[1:07:39] who has fulfilled his word and is moving
[1:07:42] in the hour that you and i live in and
[1:07:44] he his promises this to us while the
[1:07:47] world is chasing after the symbols and
[1:07:50] the world is chasing after the meaning
[1:07:51] and the world is chasing after the
[1:07:53] symbolism the bride is saying i just
[1:07:56] want to be a faithful and wise servant
[1:07:59] that's the desire of my heart tonight
[1:08:02] that's why even even even sunday when we
[1:08:05] talked about removing the hindrances and
[1:08:08] we talked to you about prayer life and i
[1:08:09] thought about that as i left there's so
[1:08:11] much more i want to say
[1:08:13] you know just on prayer alone
[1:08:15] and i thought a real prayer life
[1:08:18] do we
[1:08:20] do we really
[1:08:22] appreciate
[1:08:25] that
[1:08:26] when you when you go to prayer
[1:08:30] and you are going to
[1:08:32] do you understand you're going to talk
[1:08:34] to the creator
[1:08:36] of
[1:08:36] everything
[1:08:38] now i want you to absorb this for a
[1:08:40] minute and take ownership of it do you
[1:08:42] realize friends
[1:08:44] that when you walk into the presence you
[1:08:47] can be standing in your house
[1:08:49] or in this church or in a field or
[1:08:52] driving your car
[1:08:54] it doesn't matter where you are what's
[1:08:56] going on around you or what you're doing
[1:08:59] you have the most unique so i said
[1:09:02] sunday people who just lay around in
[1:09:05] their misery and i said we ought to be
[1:09:07] the happiest people we're the most
[1:09:09] privileged people
[1:09:11] to realize seven and a half billion
[1:09:13] people in the world running around in
[1:09:15] blindness and a little sliver of
[1:09:17] humanity he has revealed and opened our
[1:09:20] eyes
[1:09:23] and it doesn't matter what's happening
[1:09:24] around you the devil can be raging and
[1:09:27] you can just step into another dimension
[1:09:30] and say father and have the great
[1:09:32] creator of all the universe step from
[1:09:35] his throne and say yes my child what
[1:09:38] what do we need to do here oh father i
[1:09:41] want to be found faithful i want you to
[1:09:43] work through my life you realize that
[1:09:45] that would you realize how privileged
[1:09:47] that is
[1:09:50] that you're literally
[1:09:51] you have
[1:09:53] 24 7
[1:09:55] 365 access
[1:09:58] to god
[1:10:01] not only do you not need anyone's
[1:10:03] permission
[1:10:06] there's no guards there to stop you
[1:10:09] not only do you not need anyone's
[1:10:10] permission
[1:10:12] it's an inalienable right that can't be
[1:10:14] denied you
[1:10:16] brother branham said every child of god
[1:10:20] has a god-given right to have a
[1:10:24] conference with jesus
[1:10:27] how many people want to exercise their
[1:10:29] rights
[1:10:30] say i'm not interested in marching in
[1:10:32] the street for republicans i'm not
[1:10:34] interested in marching in the street
[1:10:36] holding up signs for democrats i don't
[1:10:38] care about none of that kind of stuff
[1:10:39] but i do want to exercise my rights
[1:10:42] and i'm here to tell the devil you're
[1:10:44] not going to get any peace because i'm
[1:10:46] going into the king and i'm going to
[1:10:48] shake your kingdom and i that's why
[1:10:50] that's why i said to you here some
[1:10:52] months ago i i i'm not a i'm not a race
[1:10:55] i'm a son of god it is it doesn't color
[1:11:00] has nothing to do with it culture where
[1:11:02] you were born how you were born it
[1:11:04] doesn't matter the blood of jesus christ
[1:11:06] calls it all out anyway it doesn't
[1:11:08] matter how you got here or what happened
[1:11:10] and you say well this that this that or
[1:11:12] the other well i would ask you here
[1:11:14] tonight how did you get to this building
[1:11:16] and if you would be honest and you'd
[1:11:18] have to say well before i was here i was
[1:11:20] here and then before that i was here and
[1:11:22] well what were you doing well i'm not
[1:11:24] too proud of this one and go back to you
[1:11:25] more and i'm not too proud of that one
[1:11:26] go back a few more not too proud of that
[1:11:28] one well how did you get here well i
[1:11:29] don't know well you're here
[1:11:31] and none of that stopped you and you're
[1:11:33] still a believer
[1:11:35] hallelujah do you realize that all of
[1:11:37] those things are probably just the devil
[1:11:39] trying a last-ditch effort to stop you
[1:11:42] but he cannot stop you
[1:11:45] and you say i got a weakness i got a
[1:11:47] weakness we all got them but i'm still
[1:11:49] standing i'm still a believer and i'm
[1:11:52] still going forward
[1:11:56] and this is where i find myself
[1:12:01] blessed is that servant
[1:12:04] whom his lord when he cometh
[1:12:06] shall find so doing
[1:12:11] and i just removed the hindrances
[1:12:15] as i said to you sunday
[1:12:18] and i've recognized my ability
[1:12:20] to pray
[1:12:23] and
[1:12:24] there is no
[1:12:25] substitute i want to say to you friends
[1:12:28] there is
[1:12:29] no
[1:12:30] equal there's no substitute there's no
[1:12:33] second choice
[1:12:35] other than
[1:12:36] by comparison
[1:12:38] to a fervent prayer life
[1:12:40] a fervent prayer life
[1:12:42] is the is the most is is got to be the
[1:12:45] should be the highest
[1:12:47] priority
[1:12:48] in your life
[1:12:51] because a fervent prayer life
[1:12:53] can do the impossible
[1:12:55] a fervent prayer life knows no borders
[1:12:58] boundaries or stops
[1:13:00] a fervent prayer life can reach a hold
[1:13:02] of god and god can step over the top of
[1:13:05] anything i don't care what it is god can
[1:13:07] just step over the top of it say but
[1:13:09] this case you just don't know how bad it
[1:13:10] is it's nothing
[1:13:12] for god he can just step right over the
[1:13:15] top of it if you'll have faith and go
[1:13:17] forward that's why jesus would say
[1:13:19] nothing no whatever you ask get the
[1:13:21] father in my name if you don't doubt it
[1:13:23] in your heart but believe that what you
[1:13:25] have said will come to pass you shall
[1:13:28] have it
[1:13:30] hallelujah that's what the devil does
[1:13:32] not want you to to understand
[1:13:36] it's very important
[1:13:38] to come to the house of god but that
[1:13:41] pales in comparison to a fervent prayer
[1:13:43] life
[1:13:45] a fervent prayer life is the one thing
[1:13:47] that will
[1:13:48] keep you coming faithfully to the house
[1:13:50] of god in spite of all the fear the
[1:13:52] world tries to bring upon you in spite
[1:13:54] of all the entertainments of the world
[1:13:55] in spite of all the schedules in
[1:13:57] business and politics and tiredness and
[1:13:59] friends and social activities if you
[1:14:01] have a fervent prayer life i'm almost
[1:14:04] never preaching to you
[1:14:07] because your fervent prayer life
[1:14:09] keeps you above it all
[1:14:12] and you're just up in that atmosphere
[1:14:13] where god is and the least little thing
[1:14:16] satan comes along to try to put in your
[1:14:17] mind try to bring it in your heart he
[1:14:20] you're you're impregnable you're
[1:14:22] impervious to that you're talking about
[1:14:24] an inoculation they want you to go get
[1:14:26] an inoculation and they want you to get
[1:14:27] a second one and then a third one and
[1:14:29] none of them work if you had 30 of them
[1:14:31] and finally but here here's an
[1:14:33] inoculation that will work every single
[1:14:35] time
[1:14:36] brother branham was talking about in the
[1:14:37] message the other dad's listening
[1:14:39] and the infallibility i think of god's
[1:14:42] word or something like that
[1:14:43] every wonderful tape 1956 april 4 if you
[1:14:46] want to hear goodwin hear that one
[1:14:48] and and brother branham talks about
[1:14:50] you know that that that that 60
[1:14:54] of sickness comes from people worrying
[1:14:59] you see and that's what a fervent prayer
[1:15:01] life can keep you above
[1:15:03] that that's how you can you can soar
[1:15:05] over the top of temptation and just keep
[1:15:07] right on pressing
[1:15:09] and even if you do even if you have a
[1:15:11] trip in a stumble it's you're almost
[1:15:13] restored instantly because very quickly
[1:15:15] your your life is constantly you
[1:15:17] constantly keep short books with the
[1:15:19] lord that's one of the things i say to
[1:15:20] ministers all the time in ministers
[1:15:22] meeting brother jason what's you can
[1:15:24] only give me one sentence one line
[1:15:25] what's the best piece of advice you can
[1:15:26] give me as a minister keep short books
[1:15:28] with the lord
[1:15:29] don't get way downstream and not talk to
[1:15:32] him on a constant basis it's where
[1:15:34] joshua messed up he he met him he met
[1:15:36] the captain of the lord's host
[1:15:39] and and and he got instructions that
[1:15:41] were ridiculous
[1:15:44] so we're going to march around the city
[1:15:46] and not say a word
[1:15:49] and we're going to do this for a week
[1:15:51] and then finally on the seventh time
[1:15:53] we're gonna march around it seven times
[1:15:54] and everybody's gonna shout hallelujah
[1:15:58] and the priest is gonna blow a trumpet
[1:16:00] and that's it that's it
[1:16:02] that's it yep that's it
[1:16:04] well what happens next the wall's a cave
[1:16:06] down and every man just go right over
[1:16:07] the wall and kill everything in your
[1:16:08] sight
[1:16:11] and that was ridiculous
[1:16:13] that was probably the worst military
[1:16:14] advice ever given
[1:16:17] and then and then and then joshua here
[1:16:19] they come well now the next city where's
[1:16:21] that ai oh it's just tiny don't even
[1:16:23] take the whole army just take a few men
[1:16:25] you just take a couple garrisons you
[1:16:26] wipe them out they're just tiny they're
[1:16:27] nothing we just look what we just did
[1:16:29] that's the problem look what we just did
[1:16:32] see
[1:16:33] and instead of going back to the captain
[1:16:36] not realizing that he needed to keep
[1:16:37] short books
[1:16:39] because had he done that the captain
[1:16:41] would have said now here's what what
[1:16:42] you're going to do to aya however before
[1:16:44] you can do that aiken is hiding gold
[1:16:46] wedges under his tent floor
[1:16:48] and you can't go anywhere until you deal
[1:16:49] with that
[1:16:50] and instead instead of instead of a
[1:16:53] victory parade joshua is knocking on the
[1:16:55] hou 36
[1:16:57] tent post and he's got to visit 36
[1:17:00] families to explain to children that
[1:17:02] dad's not coming home and i'm sorry it's
[1:17:04] on me
[1:17:05] and he's got to talk to 36 widows and
[1:17:07] tell him i'm very sorry your husband's
[1:17:08] never coming home
[1:17:10] and it's all because
[1:17:12] of assumptions and not keeping short
[1:17:14] books he got he got caught
[1:17:17] with the men coming from a near land
[1:17:19] thinking they were along trying to fake
[1:17:22] him out that we're from a long ways away
[1:17:24] and if he had kept short books that
[1:17:25] wouldn't have got him either
[1:17:27] i'm not criticizing general joshua he
[1:17:30] was the same as the holy ghost i'm i'm
[1:17:32] glad that the that the holy ghost
[1:17:35] not just a man i'm glad the holy ghost
[1:17:37] himself which takes me into the promised
[1:17:39] land will give me will tell me about
[1:17:41] every enemy and it'll position me
[1:17:43] correctly to never be defeated if i'll
[1:17:46] stay in contact with him
[1:17:49] if i'll design my life to have a
[1:17:52] constant
[1:17:53] daily multiple times continual prayer
[1:17:57] continual times and i'm not just talking
[1:17:59] about continual alone where you're just
[1:18:01] constantly with a a song on your lips
[1:18:03] and a psalm in your heart i appreciate
[1:18:05] that i do that all the time i talk to
[1:18:06] god constantly but i'm talking about
[1:18:08] that time where you get up a little
[1:18:10] early and you sit in the quiet and you
[1:18:12] talk to god and you pour your heart out
[1:18:14] or when you're laying asleep at night
[1:18:16] you don't drop in the bed just in time
[1:18:18] to go to sleep you lay there and you
[1:18:20] thank god for the day and you ask him to
[1:18:22] watch over you through the night and you
[1:18:24] wake up the next morning and thank him
[1:18:26] for another opportunity i'm talking
[1:18:28] about a fervent prayer life faithful
[1:18:31] that servant who the lord finds faithful
[1:18:34] blessed is that servant whom the lord
[1:18:37] finds
[1:18:39] how many want that kind of a blessing
[1:18:49] we found that last sunday how that
[1:18:54] he said to moses
[1:18:56] draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes
[1:18:58] from off thy feet
[1:18:59] and i was showing you how that word nigh
[1:19:03] means it's it's the it's the coming
[1:19:05] together in a
[1:19:06] in a close
[1:19:09] spatial proximity
[1:19:11] of the
[1:19:12] it says it like this of the
[1:19:16] of the um
[1:19:18] to approach the basic concept is a close
[1:19:20] spatial proximity of the subject and the
[1:19:23] object
[1:19:24] so now it's you and god
[1:19:27] coming together
[1:19:29] close
[1:19:30] on a daily basis
[1:19:32] all the time
[1:19:34] this world is too broken
[1:19:37] for you to live
[1:19:39] loose
[1:19:40] and not have that
[1:19:42] in your life
[1:19:43] young people if i could
[1:19:45] if i could just
[1:19:47] open up your mind and take my years of
[1:19:49] experience and just drop it in there
[1:19:52] and what you could do with your youth
[1:19:54] and your strength and paul wrote unto
[1:19:57] you young men i'm looking at young men
[1:19:59] and paul said i write into you young men
[1:20:02] because you're strong
[1:20:04] don't don't let those years pass by and
[1:20:07] the pursuit of of the of the layout of
[1:20:09] sin dream and trying to win the rat race
[1:20:12] and uh you're here here you are with all
[1:20:14] this vitality all this strength let god
[1:20:17] open up your heart and your mind and
[1:20:20] pour into you while you're really here
[1:20:22] and what this life is really about and
[1:20:25] be
[1:20:25] filled let me say you in the words of
[1:20:27] the scripture be you filled with the
[1:20:30] holy ghost
[1:20:32] don't just take a halfway experience
[1:20:35] well i go to this church or i believe
[1:20:37] this or i do that because mom dad the
[1:20:39] preacher whatever well what about what
[1:20:41] what do you
[1:20:44] say i know what your mom and dad says i
[1:20:47] certainly know what the preachers say
[1:20:49] but what do you say
[1:20:51] young man
[1:20:52] young woman
[1:20:54] this is there you're as i said to you i
[1:20:57] opened up sunday
[1:20:58] and i i used that quote from a science
[1:21:00] digest
[1:21:01] and said this is the best time to be
[1:21:04] alive or something like that
[1:21:06] it's the greatest time to be alive and
[1:21:08] that's all yeah i agree but for a
[1:21:09] different reason
[1:21:11] this is the hour of our transition and
[1:21:14] the devil thus knowing that has brought
[1:21:16] every gun he's aiming it he's got every
[1:21:19] tactic he's been practicing on human
[1:21:22] beings for six thousand years he's a
[1:21:24] master of psychology you cannot max
[1:21:27] match wits with him he he he knows your
[1:21:31] buttons he knows your weaknesses he
[1:21:33] studied you since you were a child your
[1:21:35] only defense is to have a fervent prayer
[1:21:38] life
[1:21:39] where you talk to god
[1:21:41] close
[1:21:42] deep
[1:21:43] a lot
[1:21:48] we talked about that still small voice
[1:21:50] because he's leading you
[1:21:52] leading you by love drawing you
[1:21:55] into a secret place
[1:21:58] that
[1:21:59] everything that i can show you
[1:22:02] and i i will
[1:22:04] by the help of the lord
[1:22:06] but let me just let me just preempt a
[1:22:08] little bit here on sunday for sunday
[1:22:11] we're going to look at some things and
[1:22:12] i'm going to try to
[1:22:14] use some slides and draw a real picture
[1:22:16] in your mind
[1:22:18] to equip you why are you doing it to
[1:22:19] equip you to understand
[1:22:21] what's going on and who you are and why
[1:22:23] you're here and what you need to be
[1:22:24] doing
[1:22:25] see but remember remember remember
[1:22:28] knowing is half the battle
[1:22:31] so that's good
[1:22:32] but remember knowing is half the battle
[1:22:36] okay
[1:22:37] knowing is half the battle but knowing
[1:22:39] is half the battle
[1:22:42] because the other half is always
[1:22:43] application
[1:22:45] see and so so when we start to look at
[1:22:48] it in this way
[1:22:49] that god is is drawing you into a secret
[1:22:53] place
[1:22:54] and you know he
[1:22:56] he he doesn't say why is it a secret
[1:22:58] because he doesn't want the world to
[1:22:59] know
[1:23:01] he wants you to know
[1:23:03] this is a this is a love mystery
[1:23:06] this is his elect lady as john would
[1:23:08] call her this is his bride this is his
[1:23:11] family
[1:23:12] there's all kinds of times i go all
[1:23:13] kinds of events and i got people around
[1:23:16] and everything but and i'm happy you
[1:23:18] know i can go i can i can go be working
[1:23:21] over here and in some venue and be in
[1:23:24] the public and mingling and and that's
[1:23:27] one thing but then there's a then
[1:23:28] there's a a deeper level that comes you
[1:23:31] know around my kin folk but then there's
[1:23:33] even a deeper level than that if they
[1:23:36] happen to be not born again of the
[1:23:38] spirit of god there's a deeper level
[1:23:40] being around the family of god
[1:23:42] sure family of god becomes closer than
[1:23:45] your unconverted blood family
[1:23:47] that's a phenomenon but it's true
[1:23:50] and so
[1:23:51] but but then you know when you've got
[1:23:53] family and they are blood and they are
[1:23:55] can and they and they do you do have
[1:23:58] that relationship around the word with
[1:24:00] them there's nothing like it
[1:24:02] and and i can i can pull my family in
[1:24:05] and my children and my girls and my
[1:24:08] grandkids and and we can all just there
[1:24:11] there's there's a there's a level of
[1:24:13] of love and a level of
[1:24:16] of uh a feeling that's between us all
[1:24:20] that i don't i don't even want the world
[1:24:22] there
[1:24:24] this is my family
[1:24:26] there
[1:24:27] there's a level that i feel here that i
[1:24:29] don't even want the world it's not that
[1:24:30] i don't like the world but this is my
[1:24:33] family
[1:24:34] and this is god listen when it's so
[1:24:36] secret
[1:24:37] it's so
[1:24:39] intimate that brother branham when he
[1:24:41] has the vision of the tent or in one
[1:24:43] place calls it a tent in other places
[1:24:44] call it a cathedral and some kind of a
[1:24:47] thing and there's a little wooden room
[1:24:49] and he's watching this woman go in and
[1:24:52] she's terribly afflicted and she goes in
[1:24:54] one side and she's in there for some in
[1:24:57] undetermined amount of time and the next
[1:24:59] thing we hear in the narrative she's
[1:25:00] coming out of the backside and she's
[1:25:02] totally healed and here's a man and he's
[1:25:04] totally healed and missing limbs and
[1:25:06] everything is made right and all wrongs
[1:25:08] are made right and everything's broken
[1:25:09] is fixed
[1:25:11] oh hallelujah there's a lot of broken
[1:25:13] people but i'm here to tell you joy
[1:25:15] comes in the morning there is a fix
[1:25:17] there is a repair and god's going to
[1:25:19] repair everything god's going to repair
[1:25:22] fix and restore everything that you were
[1:25:25] supposed to be and the devil sidetracked
[1:25:27] you jesus christ is here to give it back
[1:25:30] to you
[1:25:33] and it was so intimate
[1:25:35] that even the person and they said
[1:25:37] brother branham hears them in the
[1:25:38] conversation they're interviewing what
[1:25:40] happened in there and the person says
[1:25:43] i i don't know
[1:25:45] i don't even know
[1:25:47] but you had a missing limb yeah and now
[1:25:49] i don't and well you're you're all fixed
[1:25:51] yeah what happened i don't know
[1:25:55] that's how intimate it is
[1:25:58] friends that god is looking to do things
[1:26:00] in your life you can't even explain to
[1:26:02] you
[1:26:03] you can't even get of your mind around
[1:26:05] it but i'm here to tell you something
[1:26:07] you're living in the greatest hour
[1:26:09] that's ever been for the family of god
[1:26:12] oh blessed is that servant who when his
[1:26:15] lord comes finds him so doing who's
[1:26:18] who's found faithful to god
[1:26:23] that's the great desire
[1:26:25] of my heart
[1:26:30] brother branham tells a story and i'm
[1:26:32] gonna i'm gonna close in seven minutes
[1:26:34] you with me
[1:26:39] brother branham starts telling
[1:26:41] at least at this one place he may
[1:26:43] perhaps tell it in other places as well
[1:26:45] but
[1:26:46] i chose this
[1:26:48] rendering and believeth
[1:26:51] thou this 1953.
[1:26:54] it says i was passing a
[1:26:56] a museum
[1:26:58] here not long ago and they had a picture
[1:27:00] of a man's body
[1:27:02] in there that weighed 150 pounds
[1:27:07] and and so this is a museum so obviously
[1:27:10] from the description
[1:27:14] it appears to be some kind of science
[1:27:15] exhibit
[1:27:16] perhaps or
[1:27:20] something of biology but he says here
[1:27:23] it was a picture of a man who weighed
[1:27:24] 150 pounds and
[1:27:27] said he was
[1:27:28] worth 84 cents in chemicals
[1:27:32] so brother branham
[1:27:34] here in this 1953 audience is gonna
[1:27:37] kind of use this to make a point
[1:27:40] and he says so you put a hundred dollar
[1:27:42] suit on 84 cents walk around with your
[1:27:44] nose up in the air
[1:27:47] think you're somebody you're not worth
[1:27:48] but 84 cents if you weigh 150 pounds
[1:27:51] wrap a 500 mink coat around 84 cents and
[1:27:54] won't even speak to your neighbor
[1:27:59] and brother branham says
[1:28:00] there's a couple boys standing there
[1:28:04] and one looked and said well john we're
[1:28:06] we're not worth very much are we
[1:28:10] and brother and brother branham
[1:28:11] butts in he says i said look fella
[1:28:14] that's your body
[1:28:16] but you got a soul that's worth ten
[1:28:19] thousand worlds
[1:28:21] that's right i said that body will go
[1:28:23] back to the dust some of these days
[1:28:26] you know this is a particular thing
[1:28:30] you know we used to only have to say it
[1:28:31] to sisters but some men have become so
[1:28:34] sissified in this last day and men want
[1:28:36] to be pretty and
[1:28:37] and and brother branham talked about
[1:28:40] you know even brother branham talks
[1:28:41] about
[1:28:42] here listen whatever you do don't
[1:28:44] disregard what i'm about to say because
[1:28:46] it sounds trivial but it's not because
[1:28:48] if it was trivial elijah prophet
[1:28:50] wouldn't have said it
[1:28:52] don't ever trivialize the prophet's
[1:28:53] words whatever you do it's dangerous to
[1:28:55] your health
[1:28:57] and brother branham talked about bangs
[1:28:59] hanging down in a boy's face
[1:29:01] and brother branham said bangs
[1:29:05] now he wasn't calling the boy a
[1:29:08] brother branham goes on to describe he
[1:29:10] said that's a spirit
[1:29:12] that's a demon spirit see
[1:29:15] and we talk about girls and the and the
[1:29:18] spirit that gets on girls and want to uh
[1:29:20] strip their body and show their body
[1:29:22] when they shouldn't their body is sacred
[1:29:24] and and these days it's just as bad to
[1:29:26] the boys because boys trying to be as
[1:29:28] pretty as girls
[1:29:29] and such attitude and
[1:29:31] spirits on them and i want to tell you
[1:29:33] something brothers you need to be men
[1:29:35] you need to act like men you need to
[1:29:37] look like men
[1:29:38] you need to dress like men present
[1:29:40] yourself like a man be a man be rough be
[1:29:42] burly don't be a pretty boy whatever you
[1:29:44] do that's that is so disappointing to
[1:29:47] the holy spirit i know your girlfriend
[1:29:49] might like it but it disappoints the
[1:29:51] holy ghost
[1:29:54] remember brothers you remember young men
[1:29:56] you know brother jason's teaching on
[1:29:57] that manhood is not a gender
[1:30:01] you can be a male
[1:30:03] that's a gender
[1:30:04] you you can be a 50 year old male
[1:30:07] and have never been a man in your life
[1:30:11] brother and i said i've seen men six
[1:30:12] foot 200 pounds didn't have an ounce
[1:30:15] of man in them
[1:30:18] because manhood is an office
[1:30:21] it's not a gender you don't get to
[1:30:22] automatically be a man just because
[1:30:24] you're a male and you've gained age in
[1:30:26] years
[1:30:29] manhood is when i'm is a man living
[1:30:32] after the image of his maker god said
[1:30:34] let us make man
[1:30:36] in our image and after our likeness
[1:30:40] see
[1:30:41] and so manhood speaks of character
[1:30:45] it speaks of honesty it speaks of
[1:30:47] decency it speaks of integrity it speaks
[1:30:50] of responsibility reliability amen
[1:30:54] that's a man
[1:30:56] see what what's a woman a bible woman
[1:30:58] there's no other kind not they're the
[1:31:00] only kind of lady is a bible woman
[1:31:03] you know you don't get to be a lady it's
[1:31:04] because you're female a lady is is what
[1:31:07] god the elect lady
[1:31:10] see
[1:31:11] and so she she cares about when her lord
[1:31:14] comes and he she wants to be found
[1:31:17] faithful
[1:31:19] happy blessed is that servant how many
[1:31:21] want to be blessed be a blessed servant
[1:31:23] say lord when you come i want to i want
[1:31:25] to be blessed to know that you find me
[1:31:28] faithful
[1:31:30] and and and so we're all the time having
[1:31:33] to the vanity that's in this world and
[1:31:34] gets on teenage girls and gets on
[1:31:36] teenage boys just remember sister i mean
[1:31:39] in 1953 the chemicals of your entire
[1:31:42] body was worth 84 cents if you weighed
[1:31:44] 150 pounds
[1:31:46] was worth 84 cents
[1:31:50] but brother branham says but you got a
[1:31:51] soul in there that's worth 10
[1:31:54] 000
[1:31:55] worlds
[1:31:58] that body will go back to the dust some
[1:32:00] of these days
[1:32:02] but you got a soul that will live
[1:32:04] forever take care of that
[1:32:07] look at the value that jesus put on it
[1:32:12] he come from glory to die to redeem you
[1:32:15] that's the trouble we look at the
[1:32:16] outside and take care of the outside but
[1:32:19] the inside we let go see
[1:32:22] and this is why sunday
[1:32:25] i i i'm gonna come with charts and
[1:32:28] things but i'm not i promise you now i'm
[1:32:30] not interested in equipping you with
[1:32:32] theology
[1:32:34] what i'm what i'm gonna try to show you
[1:32:36] is that
[1:32:37] that that that seventh vial that is
[1:32:40] breaking out upon the world now
[1:32:42] pre-tribulation and comes full steam in
[1:32:44] the tribulation after we're gone
[1:32:46] that that that's released into the air
[1:32:49] you can't believe how many things
[1:32:51] brother branham attached to that to that
[1:32:53] seventh vial and talks about the
[1:32:55] perversions in the world say why is this
[1:32:57] like this why was it never like this 100
[1:32:58] years ago because we're at the time of
[1:33:00] that seventh vial
[1:33:02] and it's a plague and it's being poured
[1:33:03] out on the earth and you know where it
[1:33:05] comes from can i give you a little
[1:33:06] insider where you know where it's coming
[1:33:08] from it's judgments it's plagues being
[1:33:11] poured out on the earth why is it
[1:33:13] happening so much in the seventh because
[1:33:15] it rejected the the seventh angel's
[1:33:17] message
[1:33:19] and the message was so great
[1:33:21] the message was so unparalleled and so
[1:33:24] unprecedented in history that the
[1:33:26] punishment for rejecting it is almost
[1:33:28] immeasurably bad
[1:33:31] and the whole world even even with the
[1:33:33] bride here
[1:33:35] even with our presence here to hold it
[1:33:38] at bay the world's still going crazy
[1:33:41] even with you here
[1:33:43] even with the holy ghost in the bride
[1:33:45] around the world
[1:33:46] through the darkest jungles members of
[1:33:48] the bride the holy ghost holding that
[1:33:50] beast right that fourth rider from his
[1:33:53] full ride but even with that
[1:33:55] he has still
[1:33:57] so polluted the world that the whole
[1:34:00] world has gone insane with us here
[1:34:03] what will it be when we're gone
[1:34:06] and all those chucks and stops are
[1:34:08] pulled out and the wagon rolls off the
[1:34:10] cliff
[1:34:11] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:34:12] hide me in christ
[1:34:14] oh that's not a place you're going to
[1:34:16] want to be the world is a very tame
[1:34:18] place right now compared to what it's
[1:34:20] going to be when this bride is gone
[1:34:25] but i want you to i want to take you
[1:34:27] through a trip and and watch what
[1:34:29] brother branham shows that was released
[1:34:32] in this hour
[1:34:33] and you're going to understand the
[1:34:35] craziness that you see on the streets
[1:34:37] and it's that and it's and it doesn't
[1:34:39] matter whether it's religious crazy
[1:34:41] religion craziness and religion
[1:34:43] craziness in the ecumenical movement
[1:34:45] insanity and politics insanity and
[1:34:48] social issues
[1:34:50] and the upside down inside out total
[1:34:53] depravity of man
[1:34:56] it's all the same
[1:34:58] devil
[1:35:00] it's that antichrist system
[1:35:02] moving in every category brother branham
[1:35:05] said it's a triune uh thing of religious
[1:35:08] power political power and demon power
[1:35:12] but i'm here to tell you there's a word
[1:35:14] that is sufficient in this hour to
[1:35:16] combat it there is a presence of the
[1:35:18] living god that you cannot just break
[1:35:20] into on a wednesday night or on a sunday
[1:35:23] morning you can live there you can

[1:36:40] what plaque you hang on your wall
[1:36:43] no matter what trophy you put on your

[1:36:54] it wouldn't matter
[1:36:56] you're still only worth at best a couple
[1:36:58] of bucks

[1:37:01] living in the street on your scientific
[1:37:05] elements
[1:37:12] if that's true
[1:37:14] and it is

[1:47:38] young girl with a
[1:47:40] we've got an opportunity for the lord to
[1:47:42] really do something special in her life
[1:47:44] and
[1:47:45] and and
[1:47:47] you know she she's in the middle of a
[1:47:49] terrible trial because she was
[1:47:52] from a nice family
[1:47:54] nice home
[1:47:56] never been in trouble ever just uh
[1:48:00] almost a perfect life going forward
[1:48:03] don't know all the details got around
[1:48:04] the wrong people at the wrong moment
[1:48:06] wrong time in the wrong place
[1:48:08] ended up driving a vehicle intoxicated
[1:48:10] uh wrong way on the highway has a
[1:48:12] head-on collision
[1:48:13] and no one died but the three men that
[1:48:16] she struck were athletes with olympic
[1:48:19] potential and their lives are ruined
[1:48:22] they gave her 12 years
[1:48:24] and the family
[1:48:26] says rebecca's family has asked us
[1:48:28] brother it's brother tom dillard's
[1:48:30] brother
[1:48:31] and his daughter and they've asked us to
[1:48:33] pray
[1:48:34] that god and and sister rebecca who
[1:48:36] writes to her often
[1:48:37] talks about that you know she's not just
[1:48:40] looking for a get out of jail card her
[1:48:42] spirit is humbled she's realized
[1:48:45] the the wrong that she's done and she's
[1:48:47] putting her hands in the her life in the
[1:48:49] hands of god could we pray as a church
[1:48:52] and to say lord god have mercy
[1:48:54] a young woman with just suddenly her
[1:48:56] life and here's three other young men
[1:48:59] and their lives we don't know we don't
[1:49:00] know why god why these things can happen
[1:49:02] but i but i know mercy can rejoice
[1:49:04] against judgment
[1:49:06] oh i've needed that so many times have
[1:49:08] you there's been many times i've went to
[1:49:10] the lord i knew i didn't deserve to go
[1:49:12] to the lord but i always thought well
[1:49:14] mercy rejoices against judgment
[1:49:17] so lord i'm here for mercy because
[1:49:18] listen friends bottom line is um
[1:49:21] you know if you could if you deserved it
[1:49:24] it wouldn't be mercy
