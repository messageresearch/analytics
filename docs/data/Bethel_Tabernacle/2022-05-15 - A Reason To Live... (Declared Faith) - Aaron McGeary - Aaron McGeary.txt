========================================

they're preaching on the resurrection from first corinthians 15 and he was preaching the resurrection and he stopped right in the middle of his sermon and he said you know so many people are afraid of defeat he said when general patton lost a bunch of soldiers said then they told him he sat back and he wanted some more and they sent him up some more he got them killed and he sent for some more and when he got them third bunch up there said every time a bullet would wind they'd run out of ten or running or something other scared he said say me up man not kids he said i want man that's ready to die i don't want somebody's free to die if the cause we're fighting for is not worthy to die for then keep them away from me i want man he said but you've lost two or three battles he said i haven't lost a war i just lost a battle something spoke in my heart i remember eisenhower said when i thought a bullet commanded and they threw a shell in the gun they pulled it off and it was a fizzle it didn't work said i didn't quit and surrender i pulled the bullet out and put another one in tried it didn't work i put another one in until one did work that's the way it's got to be done i don't know how to be but god is my judge over this pulpit i don't know how many fizzles and how many how many battles i lose but i'll not lose the war he told me he'd be with me i'll stand alone see that ministry confirmed and sit in operation i begin this morning by the grace of god i don't know where to work here where to work somewhere else how to work or what will take place i'll walk right down prayer lines praying for the sick until i do know what's happening today you might not be able to faith [Music] i always want to be a soldier with a second war come along at war i was too young the next war they wouldn't take me but i finally got the joy in the army the army of the soldiers of the cross my uniform is not only outside this afternoon it's on the inside god gave me a uniform that wasn't trade for everything in the world the baptism of the holy spirit dressed me up as a soldier from the inside beginning grace to stand in the hours [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like a book i read what is that called romeo and juliet is that what it was or something he left that got the ladder upside down somewhere opera a long time ago and come god is getting out at nighttime now that's the way that it'll uh it'll take place and it'll be gone not they'll have set a bunch of angels down with some spades and dig up the graves the bible said will be changed before even you could bat your eye just a twinkle it'll all be over that quick just say somebody disappeared well would imagine if we could search the world over today there's been 500 people disappear off the earth each day yeah but they don't know what i'm about they just come up disappearing well there ain't going to be too many go in that rapture now i don't want to scare you and i and i i i don't think it's that way but i just want to tell you what he said and you know it yourself as it was in the days of noah wherein eight souls were saved by water eight souls out of the world be saved by water what do you say oh my i don't need to be trying that show you haven't got the kind of faith you need if there's just going to be one that'll be me amen because i believe that's where you want to believe me i want to live so close jim now i know he's going to take me when he comes i believe it so if everybody else has done he'll be there by his grace because he promised me that and i know i i'll be there because he can't lie and i know my soul life bears record and i try to live daily just like he was coming so i i'm going to be that one that's where you want to feel if he's going to be eight i'll be one that eight will be 500 i'm going to be one of that 500. i don't know about the other fellow but i don't want to be one of their 500. that's the way you want to remember and if you don't remember it like that there's something wrong with your faith you're not sure you're saved yet then you're just guessing at it [Music] do that [Music] [Music] [Music] a man said to me the other day said i think you're just a fine man mr brandon but i believe you're sincerely wrong you're all out of the will you know you'll be condemned at the end i said look i want to tell you something i'm going to say that you it should be right just to say for your argument say if i am wrong which i i don't believe i am but if i was wrong and i know right now that i was going to live to be 100 years old and he is going to condemn me at the end of the road and tell me you don't deserve to come into my heaven william branham get out of the outer darkness you know what i'd serve him every day of my life until i went anyhow for i have received so much of his unmerited blessings that he's more than life to me he's everything that i all that i am all that i ever could hope to be i have derived from his grace and mercy i was wretched miserable poor blind but by grace he has healed me and i am strong and healthy by the grace of god i have good eye sight i have eat drink have whatever i have need of you never promise supply my wants my needs and if i am cast away at that day and i know i cannot see where i would be but if i knew that i was wrong and god has chosen me to be wrong i would want to stay wrong and because that i want to do his will it's i love him until i want his will to be done now that's a big statement but i hope you get it in the way of spirit i said it in see i want to do his will i asked him for something sometimes jake said no i just rejoiced so much about that as a kenneth he said yes because we always ought to ask thy will be done his nose is just as if that's his will that's just it's a whole lot better than his yeses if it's his will to do it that's when you really love him amen i get to talk about him i just can't stop oh oh he's so real so real to me friends he's all that i am all that i ever could be all that i ever expect to be is grounded in christ jesus his word i'm thankful tonight for the witness of the holy spirit for the message i know it might some might disagree with it but as i have told you i'm duty bound to a message [Music] you know i feel like paul said here i'm looking at a scripture in acts 20 24 he said none of these things move me amen why for he was anchored he had an absolute since i met him on the road to damascus if i could talk to paul he turned me around started me back in the right way i was off the word he put me back on the word yes sir listen i feel that way too i feel that any man that's born of the spirit of god that loves god and loves his word god has a purpose in that god had a purpose in turning paul around did not he say i'm going to show in him his glory god had a purpose when he saved me i'm determined to do his will not add to it or take away from it revelations 22 19 said whosoever shall do it will be is part taken from the book of life i'm determined to never add one thing of my own opinion to that word i'm determined to read it just the way it is and and ask god that i open to my heart and receive it work it through me lord that others might see may it become salty or something real that others might see yes sir now if he is our absolute there can be no other absolute you can't have same on my my church is my absolute my creed is my absolute if christ is your absolute you believe christ's word there's no other way to do it you know i think about the time that he saved me i'll tell you why i stand the way i do not to be different i've made myself clear on that i hope i have but i when christ saved me there were millions of people groping and sin when he saved me he had a purpose in doing it he had a purpose in saving me he just seen an ignoramus like me and and somehow another one there's plenty of smart man more able man man that could do it me earth not even a hardest seventh grade education one there's a man who studied in school and got degrees and doctors of of divinity and philosophy and so forth but when christ saved me he had a purpose in doing it or never saved me listen brethren i love you and you know that but i'm determined in my heart that i'll never back on that word i'll stay right there that's my absolute i've been tied to all these years uh he had a purpose in doing it right and i aim to see that purpose soon to stay with that word not to be different not to be mean but to be honest and sincere with god that's right [Music] don't let yourself be fooled don't let the devil pat you on the shoulder say when i go to church the devil does too fine be sure they'd come up to god went to church in heaven come before the sorrow of god was the sons of god set out with him not an audience with god he said where do you mean to walk if you're in florida on the earth that's where he has been so the devil goes to church the devil belongs to church the devil acts like a christian he's a deceiver and if he doesn't act like a christian and act like a church he would be in the sea [Music] [Music] friends are there it's time for the prophets of god oh brothers for the preachers that you would say across the nation to follow their faith when you look ahead your bible out somewhere laying out before god on your knees of praying for the sins of the country and i'm guilty with you i have made my mind up by the help and grace of god if i god will give me strength i'm determined [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] [Music] now we know that we're close to the end of a we're right at the door of a global destruction we know that hanging in the hangars right now is bombs did you read the life magazine i believe it was a few days ago or weeks ago where that general said that this is the first one or boys top that's a expression i'm going to touch off one of them bombs what's going to happen they're already hanging there they're ready they can time them by radar and the stars they can drop one from moscow right on uh vine street or sunset boulevard and by exactly on the dot right on the target any where they want to drop one they can do it and we're sitting right out there in the ocean with these big ships when you see them the other day them submarines come up and they wouldn't even let us get near with that radar bomb sitting there they could put one right on my scar anywhere they want to put it now what one of these days somebody's going to make a slip and they're going to pull one and when they pull it's going to be pulling on this side too what's the world going to do it can't stand it there'll be a burst in a shaking world of fly to pieces that could happen before the sun goes down tonight a great general speaking on the other day said the next war that takes place will only be three minutes long three minutes no wonder science says it's three minutes till midnight three minutes is all it'll take to rock the world completely to pieces and blow it up we're living on bar time some fanatic one of these days is going to touch on them all and when they out there of them listening post and everything and ears alert when they hear that first whistle go for that bomb going across they're going to pull them too and then when that starts it's going to pull both ways and here they come it'll be a constant completely rocking in this world go into volcanic ashes that's all it can do it can never stand it one of them bombs will blow a hole in the ground 175 feet deep 100 miles square and how about 10 000 of those turned loose on the united states at one time where's your living going to be the world couldn't stand that shock even now until the science is claiming that the the earth is bulging out in the middle you've seen that here the other day and heard them talking of it that they're the waters in the north there's went down so many feet are in the middle of the earth rather and getting deeper in the north and then south because the earth is bulging out the sun doesn't go around its orbit like it used to everything is indicating that coming of the lord we're right at the door and remember before one of those bombs can drop don't forget this jesus said as it was in the days of noah and in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and before norfolk any rain fell down nor was in the ark safely before any fire fell on sodom lot was outside [Music] and before one bomb can strike it the church will be home in glory gone in be sure then if this just to think right if it's that close how much closer is the coming of the lord because the lord comes before that happens [Music] one of the ministers will probably pick it up in a few minutes on the oncoming judgments and i hope they do anyhow on the oncoming judgment [Music] because the whole world is ready to is quivering every nation is quivering don't you think that russia is equivalent to the united states the islands are equivalent who's going to throw that first atomic bomb when it does it may throw a whole thing out of cater or not be a cobalt bomb watch as few of them's that loose there won't be even a fire and insect on the face of the earth it's right now in the hands of wicked sinful hellbound man and your destination of this earth's journey to the hands of wicked and sinful man you better watch where your soul's destination is pledged far if it isn't pledged towards heaven and towards god turn the night with all your heart don't let the old air pass away without you turning to god for your earthly destination is determined by the hands of wicked and cruel cold-hearted idiotic man that's where your body is determined whatever they want to do about it now that finishes you up god be merciful and god in his loving mercy send in signs and wonders and miracles and everything and preach the gospel and people constantly turning your face away from it then how can you expect anything else for judgment you must receive it and one man being healed of policy in the whole country turned to christ and here where we have kings and overtakes monarchs and congressmen and everything else of afflictions and diseases and dead and passed away and see them rise to life again and the nation only scored a life at it then what we got left for judgment oh brother if there ever was a time that god wake up his people is the day this coming year make god anoint his ministers like planes of fire or you're in the last days of the closing times watch russia watch russia the king of the north [Music] how many hermes says way that over over the old hamburgers you see back in the early part of the church just stand there and wave it over and over watch russia the king of the north [Music] [Music] i went into a football stadium one time and was going to preach i stopped the door looked up up there and said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog so that's what wins the battle see you say well look at all the great churches are against this i don't care what size they are it's the fight that's in the dog that's what counts it's the faith that's in the individual your entire get back to your cuddle but brother of your soldiers stay out here there's a battle on right and wrong's engaged let's fight but

king of the jews he's a king of israel he's a king of righteousness he's the king of the ages he's the king of heaven he's a king of glory he's the king of kings and he's the lord of lords that's

centerpiece of civilization he's unparalleled he's unprecedented he is the lostest idea in literature he's the highest personality in philosophy he's a fundamental doctrine of true theology he's the only one qualified to be an all-sufficient savior i wonder if you know him today he supplies strength for the weak he's available for the tempted and the tried he sympathizes and he saves he strengthens and sustains he god and he guides he heals the trick he cleans the lepers he forgives sinners he discharges setters he delivers the captives he defends the feeble he blesses the young he serves the unfortunate he regards the age he rewards the diligent and he purifies the nega i wonder if you know him he's the key to knowledge he's the wealth frame of wisdom he's a doorway of deliverance he's a pathway of peace he's the roadway of righteousness he's a highway a holiness he's a gateway of him glory his life is madness his goodness is limitless his mercy is everlasting his love never changes his word is enough his grace is deficient his reign is righteous and the york is easy and his burden is right i wish i could describe him so yes he's indescribable he's

i know that the day has already been very full and it's kind of it's a short weekend a lot of travel for some people a lot of preparation leading up to these times for a host church by the time you get to service on friday night you're exhausted and then just as the weekend and the activities unfold it just gets more tiring for the local church so i'm not giving you an excuse to sleep on me tonight i'm just saying i understand and and will and recognize just what a wonderful feat it will be that you are pulling and entering in every single moment for those traveling with the excitement of the weekend i know that it can be uh tiresome but we've we've come to this moment and this is what we're all here for um the activities throughout the day are wonderful we get to know one another god can even use the fellowship and the camaraderie we have as uh young believers to strengthen us and encourage us and it kind of puts us in kind of the same mind and we begin to even kind of melt together through those activities and really it's to promote moments like this where some of the uh mystery is removed and we start to get familiar with one another and we can come and uh settle our hearts and just open up to hear from god so this is this is really what we're here for is for the word and so i really would um appreciate especially for the young people just to be very very attentive and focused tonight ecclesiastes chapter 2 verse 1. i said in my heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what do with it i sought in my heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting my heart with wisdom and delay hold on folly till i might see what was the good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life and i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits and i made me pools of water to water there there with the wood that bringeth forth trees i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house and i also had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces i get me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and all that of all and that of all sorts so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me whatsoever my eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already done then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as the light excel with darkness the wise man's eyes are in his head but the full walketh in darkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all then i said and notice he's saying to the fool and to the wise one event happeneth to them all then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the full so it happened even to me why was i then more wise then i said in my heart this that this also is vanity for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how diet the wise man as the fool therefore i hated life because the work that is rotten to the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit god bless you you could be seated i mentioned uh last night at the outset and i want to take some time going back over some of the principles maybe just some key words from last night just to make sure they're kind of connected and we're tracking together and i mentioned last night we're going to kind of explore the idea of life having meaning or purpose and reference maybe the purpose and value of human existence and alluded to kind of a branch of philosophy um that existentialism that looks at life as you know why are we here what's the whole purpose of everything and even sets forth the idea that life is absurd and so there's a dread and anxiety that strikes the human heart when they consider life and they consider its inconsistencies and then we pointed out how brother branham described nervous tensions in this age that we seem so unfitted to live in and i'm wanting just to still kind of keep that in our thoughts and so my title tonight is a reason to live last night we spoke on a reason now another part unfolds i said last night that each sermon is connected together so tonight is a reason to live and then my subtitle is declared faith last night was a deliberate deliberate faith now declared faith in first peter chapter 3 verse 15. i'm going to do some things just to review it says but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear so an answer is a reason statement or argument and it's saying you must give a declaration and express the reason of the hope with your ass you need to give an answer and the answer is the reason of the hope that you have with meekness and fear so you're being provoked to give some explanation to give some clarity as to why you believe and and it must be with some you must have some reason behind that you want to be able to articulate why it is that you believe and brother branham said you can't have faith unless you got some reason and we looked at a number of places where brother brahma says you really he says if you want to be healed he says what do you want to be healed for there has to be some reason some motive and objective to that healing and so reason is a motive a reason is a cause for acting or thinking in a particular way if you say what's the reason for this you're kind of looking at the cause that which causes something a motive for an action or some sort of determination for something and so we looked at even in the principles in the message of the hour what motive is your motivation or your motive is your incentive to act a particular way it's your it's your reason for doing something and brother branham brings this out in a number of places about how your motive and objective have to be right you see it in the word of god first then your motive and objective have to be right he said as long as your motive is wrong no matter what your objective is but your motive to that objective is wrong then it will never work it might seem to be getting more complicated but it's just showing things have to line up you could have an objective that is right but your motive to that objective also has to be right for it to work out correctly and your objective is your purpose it's your what's being aimed at that which towards something a conscious act is directed and this kind of brings into view so we're just reason i want you to think about reason and motive and objective and purpose the purpose again is the object so reason speaks to motive objective speaks to purpose these things are kind of just different terminologies that we use it's a a purpose is the result that is intended it's your intent and so as we expressed last night you must have a deliberate motive we need to be acting purposely and even our faith must be it's not just going blank it's just not accepting whatever comes our way but but we have a belief we have a conviction we have a desire and we want to be very deliberate because we don't have the right motive we want to be trying to accomplish the right things and so tonight i want to take a step further in it from a deliberate faith to declared faith and a reason to live and i want to focus in the book of genesis in the book of ecclesiastes and and kind of set the scene for how human life was supposed to be and then kind of come up to what it actually is now and to get us thinking in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now if you could i i don't know if it says i'm just checking my watch just now so this is my official start time i'm going to start doing that on purpose you know wait in 15 minutes before you check so you kind of get a free free 15 minutes uh i i if you could if i'm maybe unique to listen to in a youth meeting context i think that's all right sometimes just to go a little bit different way that might even be the reason why they asked me to come is we need something really different just to kind of break up the flow um so if you could just focus with me and uh two things maybe one if you stay with me i know in the end god will speak to you and another thing is i know i love you and my heart's for you and i want the best for you and i have no fear that you're going to fail so i'm just absolutely positive what i'm preaching tonight that it's going to hit the mark for you and it's going to make a difference so it's not coming from it's not coming from a bad place in my heart it's coming i have a nothing but love for you and know that i'm sharing something that's going to help you so maybe those couple things will kind of help us relax a little bit so again in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and earth this is very critical background now just to kind of think about the scene and we know that god's existence precedes this act that god always eternally existing uh now we're introduced to him at the outset of the bible that god creates and i want you to ponder that in god creating there was a reason and a motive behind this creative act god was not just bored in eternity and said let's try this let's do something let's just see what's going to happen but god has a a very specific intent in forming and creating the heaven and the earth it's interesting when you think about it and i maybe kind of vary in a little bit here just because the pool is so nice that god in the very first verse of the bible he tells us what his plan is in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and he's already told us this whole story that he's going to create he's going to have a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride in the beginning god created the heaven and it created the earth and then he further helps us to understand the whole process because then it says the earth was chaotic without form and with void and so we can relate to that condition because we come to this world as human beings in a chaotic form and discombobulated and everything is turned upside down and all we need is the spirit of god to move upon us to bring the order that we need so god at the very beginning of the bible is trying to tell you what he's going to do through the entire book and the way things will end up in the end and so god when he creates there was a broader purpose to this act than just creating a heaven and earth it wasn't just let's see what we can do or manifest his power and i'm going to run through several verses here very quickly just to make reference to the purpose of god in second timothy chapter 1 verse 9 says who hath saved us and called us with the holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and his own grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began so even before he created he had a purpose and he had a grace and it was given to us in christ before the world began so he has his own purpose in romans 9 11 that the purpose of god according to election might stand romans 8 28 them who are the called according to his purpose this is something that's mentioned over and over again and you all know this so knowing that it's scripture your amen should be a little bit heartier at this point he's like yeah i know that i've heard that that's true amen we believe that and so it's according to his own purpose the purpose of god his purpose ephesians 1 11 predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will ephesians 3 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord so god has a purpose and it's his own purpose god is intentional god is very when god acts he has a reason behind it there's a lot of things we do especially in the day and age that we're living in where people just do things for views and uh and there's really nothing beyond it than just that and and god wasn't just looking for clicks when he wrote the bible this bible is not click bait uh there was something bigger than and followers and views it was something very rich and very deep and so when he's perfect when he has a purpose it's a setting forth when it speaks of a purpose it's already determined beforehand you know he's not just starting something and saying well i'm just going to figure out where i'm going and i started this i never asked myself what my purpose is i never asked myself what i'm trying to accomplish and there may be some brothers here who who have started businesses or wanted to make money wanted to do different things and you get started you kind of get wrapped up in it and you've bought things and you've gotten well down the road and someone says well what's your business plan you know what are you trying to accomplish what's your objective i i met a young man one time and he had seen a friend of his uh hand out flyers for lawn care and uh this guy got a number of accounts and it worked really really good and so this guy went out and handed out hundreds of flyers to clean fish tanks and he came back and he was all frustrated and i didn't get one person called back i said i want you to understand something you didn't really think through this every place that person put a flyer for lawn care he knew they had a lawn i said you have no idea whether or not anyone you gave a flyer to had a fish tank it's like passing out a flyer for pool cleaning at an apartment complex i was like i never thought about that maybe you should think through it first and put some flyers at a pet store so you think about things and you have a deliberate mode of an objective and a purpose and god was that way god did it on purpose god had a reason for doing it if i could say this god had a deliberate faith he had a determined purpose that he had set before him god had an objective one thing to think about is that god whatever god requires of you god holds himself to as well because it's his word he binds himself to his word so if there's if there's something worth checking in our motive and objective then god has kind of a similar uh nature to himself he had reason he had purpose he had a deliberate faith he had he determined he's something he intended to do the very moment he created the heaven and the earth and said that was a purposeful act why he's already foreshadowing the groom and the bride and the union of the two brother ram said he spoke the word now i want you to think of that declaration he spoke the word and said let there be and the world came into existence you find a number of places brother around uses this kind of thought all things that you see were made by faith in the spoken word of god let there be and he believed his own word god asks you to believe his word he believes his own word so god in him had a determined purpose he had something inside of him that he wanted to accomplish and so we could say that that was even a faith even a revelation and now when he speaks it and he's declaring what he wants to do let there be there's a faith that's chasing that and god believed his own word so guess what was going to happen there was going to be light and there was light his purpose was declared by faith so god had faith in his own eternal purpose and and what we can see in genesis 1 is that creation was a declaration of the intent of god declaration of his purpose now to further unfold this we see in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 now this is god who has reason this is god who has purpose and deliberate intent in verse 26 it says god said let us make man in our image so if god had a reason if god had purpose then when he makes man in this image he also likewise is going to have it let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have divine dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so now the image of god is now reflected in man god who's the invisible god now has his image in the man and maybe the first characteristic that kind of gives us a glimpse of how this is being expressed is he says let them have dominion so it's first established in the dominion that they're going to have all created things so god the highest in heaven as god in heaven the invisible god now man is a visible god on earth he has dominion over all created things and he's to be kind of a reflection of god on earth are you staying with me so far we're just kind of telling the creation story just to set the scene and i want to kind of bounce around and i'm going to cherry pick uh what points i want to bring out because i'm the one preaching and i get to do that it's really awesome how this works right you're going to preach so you get to choose you can kind of choose how you put this together so you're going to be like what happened to all those other verses brother just don't worry about it they're still there but i want to skip to chapter 2. and in chapter 2 what god is doing is he's laying out a reason and a purpose for adam's existence kind of giving them a motive and objective to adam in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden the word eastward actually speaks of in the beginning of eden god planted a garden in the beginning in eden eden means pleasure and again you see once again you see god foreshadowing a bride because a garden is indicative of a spouse and in the beginning god planted a garden in the beginning of eden god's delight god's pleasure and there he put the man whom he had formed so this is god's paradise this is god's pleasure and this place of god's paradise and god's pleasure is where he puts the man so he's giving man a place it wasn't just indiscriminate it wasn't just a a universe and kind of put man out there just kind of floating and the world he was just gonna have to bump into something or just kind of hurtling through the world he had to grab a hold of something or hope that gravitational forces placed him on the right planet with oxygen and everything it's not that there was billions of atoms floating through the the universe and some landed on mars and some landed on this and landed on that and this guy got lucky and landed in a place where there was actually oxygen god took the man and put him there intentionally now that might seem to be a little crazy the way i described it but that's really what the theory of evolution is is that just different uh cells won the lottery and given enough time in the billions and billions of years that you're going to produce complex human beings just like us because over a billion of years this cell actually something happened and mutated and popped out this and popped out that i guess that could give us enough faith to believe he put enough monkeys in a room with typewriters after a billion years they'll reproduce the works of shakespeare and that's how the evolutionists look at it but this is god with very deliberate intent and he takes the man that he created and he put him in his place and verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden again it's telling us this is man's place but now there's more than just this place to dress it and to keep it so god has not only given him a place but he's given him a purpose in that place and again he's to be in the image of god so he gives him a place a domain and now he's going to give him a purpose within it to dress the garden and to keep it and he is again remember in the express image of god amen and that in his uh he's going to be in the express image of god he also has a command in genesis 1 uh 27 be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth he's given this command have dominion subdue multiply replenish fill up the earth he had this god had this these links and this uh space that humanity would fill up to and this is adam's command and the word adam comes from to call to mind or to remember because adam was to call to mind god adam on earth he had he had a duty to call to mind god he was going to act he was going to behave he was going to do things and in doing what adam was called to do it would call to mind the image of god and so he was to be fruitful multiply and replace the earth and in doing so he would call to mind the image of god he was to be in the garden to dress it and keep it he was to call to mind the image of god he was to subdue all creation and have dominion in doing so call to mind the image of god then in genesis chapter 2 verses 19 to 20 it says that god caused from the ground to come up all animal life and he forms every beast of the field every fowl of the air and he brings animal life to adam and he says to see what he would call them i want you to recognize just how wonderful this creation is god creates the man he puts him in the garden that's his place now he gives them an objective to dress it and to keep it and now he brings animals to adam and he's not introducing the animals saying adam this is a giraffe adam this is a lion he brings these animals that god has created now he's created the fowl there he's created the animals and he brings them before adam and he wants to see what adam will name the animals and this is remarkable when you think about it because now he's put an adam in this place to recognize and to look at the characteristics of god's creation to look at how beautiful god had made them with their different uh the ways that they struck the eye and their characteristics and their height and their weight and whatever the attributes may have been and the bible says adam gave names to them so adam is looking at creation and he's discerning and there's a recognition of the difference of things god's created it sets it before adam and god doesn't tell adam what to say but he wants adam to think and to contemplate and to distinguish and give names to all the fouls of the air and all the animals there's a reasoning that's taking place he's using his mind he's using all the faculties that god had given them and recall that they're completely clear the channels are clear there's nothing else in there amen and so adam was acting deliberately in these scriptures according to the god-given purpose he had and it is in this that adam's life has meaning he's using the the the faculties that god had given them to discern the things of god the creation of god god given in this purpose to bring all animal life before him and he's to use his mind and and to think i want you to name this and adam gave them names it gives his life meaning and then shortly after this after the formation of the woman it's unique in that this story this retelling of adam naming the animals comes between god saying man shouldn't be alone and before he created the want to form the woman he inserts this detail of adam doing a work and doing things and using reasoning and contemplating and recognizing the difference in things before the woman came and it's reflective of things it's foreshadowing things there was a work that christ could do but there was also a work he couldn't finish until the bride came forth and so you see it reflected even in the creation of adam and the formation of the woman but after the formation of the woman humankind has now kind of set forth in their place with a meaningful life and with the gold we know that that promise to be fruitful multiplying replenish the earth was an oncoming promise so they're there in a beautiful eden a perfect condition the bible kind of ends the story in genesis 2 is saying the man and his wife are in this beautiful garden perfection of perfection and they were naked and not ashamed they were bare there was not there was not complexity there was not anxiety there was not dread there was no what's the future going to be like or what's going to happen if we do this this it's recognized in this state we're put here in a place that god wants us to be with a job that god wants us to do and they were perfectly happy but then genesis 3 the fall seems to interrupt god's plan and it's at that moment that humanity is thrown into chaos and if i could put it this way kind of the meaningful life and the simple life that adam and the woman had is now chaotic it's now frustrated and their purpose becomes clouded and you find that in the in the curses that hardships are introduced pain is introduced sorrow is introduced there's a lot of things that now are introduced that never existed before i i believe that it must be very far from us to be able to comprehend what adam and the woman must have felt the moment they sinned to experience fear it would have been so foreign to them they're in the perfection of perfection no fear of death perfect love around them and all of a sudden there's this emotion that they've never experienced before something disconcerting and now there's this dread and this anxiety it was the result of sin and god says because of this there's pain and there's sorrow and what would have come easy to you adam is going to come very very hard all the ease of the garden all the simplicity of the garden all the all the things that were very clear and you could understand differences and all these animals you named now are going to become adversaries to you and you're going to struggle with the earth everything is turned upside down and brother brown makes a very peculiar statement about this he says and when satan had brought about so in genesis chapter three through the the uh use of the serpent when satan had brought about are you listening that which was necessary to the purpose of god he said then man could not get to the tree of life in the garden so he characterizes what happens in genesis chapter 3 as that which was necessary to the purpose of god so god had a purpose he was very deliberate he's very intentional according to his own purpose the purpose of god the purpose of him the counsel of his own will the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ these are all things that were in god when he created and how he sets everything there in a beautiful eden in perfection and he puts them on a particular basis he gives them free moral agency and now the serpent comes in under the inspiration of satan and he seems to interrupt and frustrate everything but we're taught that the devil did that which was necessary to the purpose of god amen amen i believe it's in nominal christianity they essentially teach the creation story in the book of genesis as everything was perfect and also the devil messed it all up and that what happened next is god's response like god and the devil were playing chess and the devil made a move and god was like oh i had no idea that was going to happen so what should i do what should i do what should i do okay i know what i'll do now i'll send a sacrifice i'll send a son and then whoever believes on him can have salvation as if it was all an afterthought that god wasn't in the very beginning hadn't had it all planned out and and even designed satan in such a way because the lord said i behold i create good i create evil and satan after his own ambition oh how the wicked is ensnared in the works of his own hands the pit which he dug for me he's fallen into the midst of himself and here satan plays right into the hand of god because he did that which was necessary to the purpose of god [Applause] so this is very very key because i'm going to move on now to my next building block but this is very very key something about the fall was necessary to god's purpose all right so catch that something about the fall was necessary to god's purpose now i want to bring us back up to 2022 now to where we are now and here you are existing thousands of years after these events far removed from this eden condition and now that i want you to be thinking about the time you're living in right now i want to use something that was written 3000 years ago to address the way you're feeling today and i would ask that you would let it search your heart as we read these things and though it may be written and i've chose just to read the king james version even though there's some other ones that might make it more readable and express in a certain way that might come out a little bit better but i want you as you hear this to compare it to your own experience even at your young age and i want to start with ecclesiastes chapter one and i want to start with verses one to three and we're just gonna i think we're just gonna kind of bounce through this going through different places and here's the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem now we know this is solomon the wisest man in all the world and he introduces this book to us a vanity of vanities so that's one is to realize this is more than just vanity but it's vanity of vanities say at the preacher vanity of vanities not talking about furniture vanity of entities all is vanity what prophet hath man a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun now this is our introduction to this book the words of the preacher verse two vanity of vanities vanity of vanities all is vanity the repetition to say it that five times vanity vanity vanities vanities vanity what profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun vanity means it's empty it's futile it's meaningless it's worth chasing the wind anybody ever chase the wind you're not gonna catch it nothing's achieved in chasing the wind and what's happening is if i could just recall what i've expressed from genesis chapter one chapter one and two uh this is not this is not man's existence as it originally ought to have been this is not the original arrangement adam would have never said vanity of vanities vanity of vanities this is not how it was originally raised this is not uh what he was supposed to be but this is the present condition of creation even today the bible says in romans 8 20 that for the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly creation didn't do it willingly creation has been held in bondage because the vanity of man and by the fall of man here's creation it exists uh in perfection and it's master which was human and which was mankind the man and the woman they were there to serve and to be of use to the man and the woman and they were free but when men fell they were made subject to vanity not of their own will but by the failure of mankind so then think of just how much the creation is groaning to be released back released back to what back to the liberty of the sons of god all of creation is groaning to come back under the control and the dominion of the ones that let them be subject to vanity he says not willingly they're just made subject to vanity so the whole world is subject to vanity and he asked what does man really gain from all his work in life now if you're listening very diligently young people you might be able to find some uh useful arguments when your parents tell you to get a job you say well it is solomon who said rhetorically that you know what does a man really gain from work you know dad at the end of the day it's just it's money and the love of money is the root of all evil and i'm trying to keep myself sanctified here and i i want to stay holy i i don't want to and and so there might be if you just listen really hard you might get you might learn a few things but really this whole book examines this question what does a man get out of all his life and these are the observations of someone who's frustrated with the pursuit of meaning and i want to walk back through it because here's solomon who's in a pretty good position if money can buy you happiness if money can buy you love if if wisdom could get you peace and satisfaction here's a guy that we could go to is a test case say all right if there's somebody who could figure it out it would be solomon and so here's solomon expressing his frustrations after trying to find meaning after trying to find happiness and for him to say vanity of vanities and to repeat it vanity of vanities and then to say all is vanity asks the question what does man get out of life he's expressing the sentiment of hopelessness he said there's nothing gained from this there's nothing attained by it there's nothing grasped i can't take anything away from it there's nothing i can rely upon it's empty in other words he's having a crisis an existential crisis and saying this is absurd in ecclesiastes chapter 1 verses 13 to 15. now he is going to try to address the vanity of vanities or or we can say this is he's giving us the background how he can how he can make these conclusions i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit let me save you the trouble young people if you're gonna try to go out into the world and find something that satisfies it's already told us someone sought it out for us and seen all the sore travail that god hath given the sons of men to be exercised with to be kept busy with to pursue and he says i've seen all the works all the occupations all the pursuits all everything that could be done and i've realized that all of it is vanity and vexation of spirit now i know what you're thinking you're thinking he never had fortnite i know what you're thinking that he never had the nostalgia of vine he never had he never knew what myspace was he he never knew a soundcloud rapper there's things about solomon that he just didn't get to enjoy that we get today right but he saw it all he says all his vanity and vexation of spirit that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered vexation is a striving it's a longing no satisfaction no fulfillment he's saying does this life even have purpose i guess if he was having a midlife crisis he would have went out and bought a a lamborghini or something but he's he's in this moment where he's like nothing nothing's bringing any kind of fulfillment in verse 15 when he says that which is crooked cannot be made straight that which is wanting cannot be numbered he's looking at all the inconsistencies all the anomalies that count that can't be accounted for listen solomon's saying that here's a wise man who's a man of means and here's somebody who could plan figure everything out and try to achieve a desired result he said i've noticed that when people set out to do things the crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered i go out to do things and no matter how well i plan it doesn't always work out like i want it to and all the defects and all the detours and everything that happens they cannot be solved or fixed there's an incompleteness that we cannot remedy there are deficiencies as he says that which is wanting cannot be numbered there's deficiencies two number two too numerous to resolve i want you to put yourself in his shoes there might be things that you're thinking about if i could just do this dad if i could just do this i'll be happy if i could just get this off my bucket list if i could just have this opportunity i want to be able to go to europe i want to be able to get this degree i just i just want to achieve this and there's things that we begin to think that this is the source of my emptiness this is the source of my longing daddy you've always kept me from having a boyfriend i've never been able to date who i want i like this guy he's a good boy if i could just if you just let me this one time date him i think he'll turn out to be a good boy he told me that he loves two corinthians and he's read the book of job and there's things about him that i think are real there's some really good things in there if you just let me do this i think this is satisfying the emptiness and the longing i have this is these are the things that solomon is raising so it gets even more interesting in chapter two because solomon describes his efforts to satisfy himself so after he has done this i've looked at everything i've examined everything i've seen the sword travel i've seen a man work in labor and try to pursue things and you know what even in his earnest desires to achieve things and to gain income and to accomplish something it's vanity it's all he says vanity and vexation it's a hopelessness it's a despair it's draining it's killing them so he's like you know what i'm going to do i'm going to pursue i'm going to pursue all the luxuries of life in order to give life fulfilling purpose he says in the beginning of chapter 2 i said in my heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity i'm just going to have fun i'm going to seek out pleasure i'm going to say shake the fleshy desires i'm going to enjoy things that make me feel good i'm going to pursue it and certainly in doing this this will give me the satisfaction and solomon says nope it's still vanity work hard and and get a job and get a degree and make them money and and do this and be be have fidelity in your job that'll give you real happiness someone's like no tried it so it's like all right then just live eat drink be merry party do everything you can and that'll give you happiness no donna this is also vanity uh tell me how many of you can check these off the box well maybe not because the first ones enjoy wine so we won't we won't go there uh does he mention vaping or anything in here he uh he's enjoyed wine he built houses he planted gardens planted vineyards and planted orchards and trees made pools obtained servants and maidens had great possessions of cattle gathered silver gold unique treasures he got singers musical instruments and entertainers he paid for the spotify premium he didn't just use the six month trial of apple music he went all in and bought a lifetime license to title he got he had he had vip access to all the music he had he had a studio in-house he got the first cuts he invented the soundcloud rapper and so here he is saying i've tried everything i can i've had every genre i've ever beat i've had every lick i've had every riff i've heard at all i've had them all at my disposal i've had entertainers i've had music i've had movies i've had drama i've had fashion i've had it all he still says listen what he says in verse nine so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem i want you to just see this pattern here he says also my wisdom remained with me and he wants you to know he didn't become a madman so so he he knows that those of us in this day and age like solomon just lost his mind because if i could do that i'd be happy but he says no no i still had my wisdom and whatsoever my eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor here he is saying i have the means i'm going to go get it i'm going to get it while i can i'm going to enjoy it he says then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought remember everything in verses 2 to 8 and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun he enjoyed all the pleasures of the flesh yet he was still left unsatisfied in the end and all of it he never found meaning none of it never clicked there was nothing that he enjoyed that ultimately there might have been something in the moment where he's like this is it yeah that i like that this is it i'm going to enjoy this this is what this is what's going to give me meaning and then after a while he's like nope that's not it it started out with a lot of promise i thought this is what i was hunting i thought maybe that could finally put my finger on say this is it but he never found meaning in any of it none of it ever kind of gave him a reason to exist oh i can't wait to get down to the studio to hear the next track i can't wait to hear the new singers i can't wait to count all my gold i can't wait to swim in my pools i can't wait to pick the fruit from the trees none of it gave him reason he says in verse 15 then i said in my heart as it happeneth to the full so it happened even to me maybe in his wisdom he thought you know what everyone who's miserable are just foolish and the reason why the fool can't find happiness in these things is because he's he's a fool so perhaps if i can uh with wisdom obtain these things then i'll be happy so then he says as it happened to the full it happened to me so he says why was i then more wise how am i any wiser than anybody else that if what happens to the fool happens to me then i said in my heart that this also is vanity even solomon's wisdom had not kept him from vanity even in solomon's wisdom it had not kept him from sorrow so he comes to the conclusion this is where i i'm hoping that it kind of begins to speak to your hearts and i and i realize this as much as we want to be able to preach a sermon that every single person likes and enjoys and touches on every person's needs i i realize tonight that it could be phrased in such a way just to save one person and it's worth every effort but it comes to this spot in verse 17 therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous it's distressing it's injurious unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit this is the richest man in the world this is the wisest man in the world so you know just to trigger some people this is jeff bezos and elon musk combined you could figure out who the wise one is but this is the richest and wisest man in other words this is this is somebody who's earnest and sincere he's wise he's wealthy he's gonna he's gonna go before us and figure things out it doesn't get any better than this guy the wisdom came from the lord he's from a righteous lineage he's a king of a king of israel it doesn't get any better but yet in everything there's so much grief there's so much hopelessness he comes to the point where he says i hate living i hate life i'm not excited to get up in the morning i i'm not finding ambition and motive i'm sick of all of living i'm sick of life everything that i have including my own wisdom leaves me empty in the end everything's vanity of vanities this is the despair of the wealthiest man this is the despair of the wisest man this is the despair of the man who can have anything he wanted in the flesh and he says i'm depressed i'm miserable i don't want to live anymore well that escalated quickly i know we're all thinking now great what's what's the hope for me i'm living i'm going to leave depressed and you know he really does perfectly describe the emptiness of human existence after the fall the wrestling of us you say we're 20 22. i just read to you what very well could have been your diary yeah sure no matter what age you are as you become to more begin to get more conscious of life even if the inequality of outcomes for you is the fact that you do something and you get punished but your little brother doesn't you begin to realize life isn't fair this is ridiculous i don't like school this is how does this happen why does that happen and we get we're getting trapped in a society to where it's almost like there's nothing we can do all right there's no place we can go there's nothing we can say where it's not like well you better be careful there you better be careful there oh you better be very careful about that and so it's like we're living in such a tense anxious time i mean everybody you're like no ma'am sir you know you don't know what to say anymore i did point out the other day in genesis 1 that god used the they them in creating man and woman in the inequality of outcomes and the the the inconsistencies and experience because people say i did this i did that it was wonderful we try to do it we're miserable that was one of the things about instagram is you take a picture of food and it looks like i want to do that where was that they tell you where it is and you go eat it's like that tastes awful could we not have some kind of essence app that kind of we can just upload it it can tell us it looks good tastes bad is the way i can apply the filter to my taste buds and what it does it's frustration it's disappointment the more often you're disappointed the more you begin to anticipate disappointments and it's designed so that we we we begin to lower our expectations and we do that with life we do that with other people we do with family members and we've subconsciously done it when it comes to church we subconsciously done it when we come to the word of god and the promises of god were like oh yeah that was a boast that was a brag this was going to be good this was going to be great and then you begin to hear things in the word of god and in your mind subconsciously without putting the pieces together you expect to be disappointed even by the supreme so in ecclesiastes chapter 8 verses 14 to 17 it just keeps getting dark so i you know i apologize but i'm just quoting solomon d.j solomon thank you he said there's a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men under whom it happeneth according to the work of the wick in other words these are just men but what happens this is the vanity done in the earth good men do things and they get the fruit of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous do you realize what he's saying bad things happen to good people and bad people good things happen to them they said this isn't fair this isn't right why is this happening this shouldn't be happening he says this is vanity he says uh he says according he says and i said to this this also is vanity he said there's no apparent reason or justice in life events solomon the wisest man in the world sees a righteous man endure wicked things and he can't say oh let me tell you why this happened he can't do it he can't figure it out then he sees a wicked man be blessed and he says hold on let me tell you why it happened he looks and says this is vanity there's no explanation for this then i command commanded mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall for that shall abide with him of all his with him of his labor in the days of his life which god giveth him under the sun so just go ahead and enjoy yourself enjoy the fruits of your labor eat drink be merry this will abide with you all the days of your life he says when i applied my heart to no wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labored to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea further though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it the more he labors the less he receives the less he seeks the more he seeks the less he finds and it was over and over and over again he's saying i can't find satisfaction none of it satisfies me and the end what i think is going to make it click in the end the thing that's going to do it for me it's out of my reach over and over and over again a man cannot find out the work that is done or the son though a man labored to seek it out he can never find it the wise man think to know it he'll not be able to find it he's talking about the empty promises of the world the empty promises of entertainment the empty promises of social media the empty promises of technology the empty promises of fashion i think you could be uh relate to this the empty promises of sports we think that if the gamecocks could just finally win a national championship right like the somehow in getting the ring and getting the championship it's just gonna it's gonna be great but what what are they immediately talking about after they win we're going to do it next year and it starts all over again and then as soon as they're not ranked in the top 10 the next year yeah i don't know about this guy and i don't know about this i don't know about that and they need to fire the code and you're just right back in the grind again why because the trophy the championship the ring it didn't solve anything it's temporary it's fleeting and and the same thing happens with respect to fashion i want to look a certain way i want to dress a certain way i want to do a certain thing and you finally get you finally got the outfit you finally got the look and got everything and then you show up to the youth meeting and some other sister's got a better fit on than you and i knew it i knew that sister was going to do it i need to get a better subscription to these things i need to follow better people on on instagram because i just i shouldn't have been beat at this and what it's an endless pursuit you're never happy because what happens is listen i realize that i'm kind of getting into there should we dismiss the parents that we get into this cycle where we think oh i'm going to be able to achieve i want to do this i want to do this and you just set your up to where you have to do it again but you can't do the same thing you got to do it better well why don't you just wear that no i wore that two years ago right why don't you just do this no we already did that before like because there's this you enter into this cycle that somehow i'm going to achieve a certain level that's going to satisfy me and it's the empty promises of sports and fashion and entertainment i hope you recognize what the world's trying to do to you through whether it be the tick tocks or the the youtube shorts or all the different things on netflix and all the movies and all the tv shows they always have a hook that wants to keep you coming back for more they're always wanting to leave you in suspense so that you're never actually satisfied the the the the plot is never fully satisfied they want to leave you hanging for a sequel i hope you realize that what the devil's doing is he's trolling all of you he's the ultimate troll we're all being trolled by the devil [Applause] and he gets you all set up and then he just ghosts you and then you get mad at him and he just starts to gaslight you and he blames you none of these things you're going to pursue young people are going to placate your anxiety let me tell you right now some of you anxious sisters the very things that you're trying to do to satisfy your anxiety is causing your anxiety [Applause] brothers the very thing you're afraid of and you're trying to outrun and you're pursuing are the very things that are causing your fear the very pain you're trying to cure with the things you're seeking out are the things causing the pain can i just keep quoting solomon verse chapter 9 verse 11 i returned and saw unto the son that the race is not to the swift this is frustrating right because you're the fastest brother right but you never win your race nor the battle to the strong you're the prettiest sister but you never get all the attention neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to the men of understanding or yet favor to the men of skill it never quite works out the way that we think that it should the fastest doesn't win the race the strongest doesn't win the battle the wise don't get the bread the riches aren't just to the men of understanding and neither do the does the favor go to the men of skill he says time and chance happened to them all right i know his life is random how can any of this he said how can any of this be meaningful how can any of this be permanent do you realize it's remarkable when you think about the the cycle that we're in how there's so many celebrities and superstars they get very rich and they get our attention but where are they now where did the where the views of the followers and the monies and the millions where is it now they burn out so quickly and we move on to new ones that's why i don't name names because you would i would be dating myself we don't know what that is why because they were they they were superstars 10 years ago they were superstars 10 weeks ago i mean you could if if a minister sat down and tried to figure out the hashtags and all the lingo and then they start to use it now they'd be like that like that's like january stuff bro i mean we're not even we've moved on from that that's why it's just better to be vintage right [Applause] these i had some other things i wanted to read in ecclesiastes but i think i'll move on i'm getting depressed solomon's beating me down like oh my goodness solomon but these are the observations of a wise man he recognizes the disharmony in life you might be fast but you're not going to win you might be strong but you're not going to win you might be wise but you're not going to get all the bread you might you might have understanding but you're not going to get all the riches you might be the best you might be skilled but you're not the one that's going to get all the attention not going to get the credit not going to get the promotion not going to get the favor he says time and chance happens to all of them that no matter what you have chance could happen time happens he says all this he's recognizing the incongruity of things and all the the confusion that comes with it and so i want to back up to chapter seven ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29 this will kind of uh kind of begin to leave solomon's estimations but if i could maybe just do a checkup with you i asked you to consider 2022 and use the words of a man from nearly 3 000 years ago would you agree that he's describing life today he may be using a little bit of different lingo but he's describing life today it makes this observation kind of in the very middle of the book lol this only have i found now to me i feel like this this when he says this only have i found this is the wisdom of solomon coming back and and you can i want you to look at this as kind of being the point at which we can view everything before and after everything he said in chapter one two everywhere we've read where now this is kind of becomes this uh this spoken this will in the middle that we can begin to look out and everything says this only have i found this is the explanation that god hath made man upright god made him to be righteous but they have sought out many inventions now this isn't a dis on edison uh or tesla this isn't a diss on inventors he's saying that men have sought out many inventions i want to kind of break that down a little bit but solomon attributes all the vanities in life and all the frustrations of life to the fall because in the beginning god made man in his image he made him pure he made him righteous he made him holy he was not mixed with evil there was no there was no white dog and black dog are we allowed to use that analogy anymore i'm sorry there there was no two different breeds in his heart that one was evil and one was good and this one was good if he just fed it and this one was bad he had to starve it he didn't have that in his heart he was pure he was not mixed with evil at all god made man puris what he said i found that god in the beginning made man pure but now mankind is defiled now mankind is mixed he's misguided he's saying man by mixing himself with endless things has become vain having lost the holy image he's now endlessly searching for fulfillment and he's endlessly trying to find something to kind of give him that spark and give him that meaning but he can't find it this is a kind of a i think it was a translation of these verses he says i discovered the fountain of all vanity and evil it is in the original sin that has corrupted the nature of man god gave adam god made adam and the woman without imperfection in likeness likeness of his own desire in nature but the woman not content anymore with her present condition accepted a new way of making herself wise ever since all mankind is prone to forsake the order of god's word and has sought new methods to attain fulfillment and happiness this is what solomon is saying right in the middle of the book he says this is what i figured out that god made man a particular way but man by mixing himself he has sought out many inventions that means calculations opinions imaginations valuations he's devised so many ways so many different views so many different disciplines so many different belief systems to resolve vanity a way of viewing things a way of pursuing things the way to give perspective to things a way to deal with loss a way to deal with ambition a way to deal with death a way to rationalize and figure out the world it's a way to try to placate the fear and the anxiety and the dread that comes with looking at the world it's meaningless it's absurd things aren't working out the way that they're supposed to do he said god made men upright but they meddle with endless questions endless anxieties and everything solomon proposes from the first chapters to the very ends turns on this verse in other words man is not living the way god intended them to live god has an order god has a purpose sin there's a way that god made man but now man has sought out many inventions in other words he's living outside of god's original order therefore it's all vanity frustration and confusion outside of the original way it's all vanity and confusion amen are some of you following me so far and i can say this this is the work of satan this is what this is what satan has caused all the chaos all the confusion is the climax of his eden if you think solomon had it bad it's the same today if not amplified and multiplied it's the same today civilization education leads to death and chaos we're at the climax of it death and chaos i saw an article a couple years ago and the title was great it said this within the article grappling with the world has to be more complicated for kids than it's ever been and i i would say myself myself included i can't relate completely to what you are having to go through just with the political pressure you face the social pressure you face all all the isms that exist all the movements everything that you got to be careful of that you can't offend this you can't offend that you've got to be careful about this you've got to be careful about that and there's no they the very ones that advocate for safe places have made nothing safe i mean even if we went out today and said you know what we believe women should have equal opportunity they'd be like are you assuming people's gender but sorry i'll burn the signs there's always somebody that's going to be offended and there's such a bully culture that we live in that everyone is worried and they're recognizing this this is a complicated time for for young people because it's a question of where do i belong where how do i fit in and who who do i relate to and who understands me and there's a way that we can begin to feel even within ourselves and i'm speaking to you individually i may be speaking to one person right now that you feel within yourself or your thought patterns and your thought process and you think about this you know well there might be something to that then you hear this other person's response well that doesn't seem very right and you hear this and you hear that and you begin to feel as if i don't know if anybody else around me thinks the way i do or feels the way i do and i'm afraid to say something i'm afraid to ask a question i feel in my heart that perhaps the things that i'm seeing and the things i'm being taught in the way that i want to go is really what's right for me but there's a lot of other things that are clouding the issue but if i raise the question if i bring something up then i know this might happen that might happen and we kind of are getting beat into this quietness we're being beat into the submissiveness not yielding ourselves to the things of god but just yielding us to the pressure of satan's eating and it's our minds our minds are just being bombarded over and over and over again we hear we we hear something and we go well that that sounds that sounds reasonable that sounds good but then tucker carlson comes along and he spews out some other things like well maybe not and i don't know and all that well that's oh no my goodness oh man we're just vacillating back and forth unsure about this unsure about that not knowing which way to turn i i would say that anybody who's in public school today you've got to be walking on eggshells you're holding your breath all day long ram said in the message communion december 12 1965 these are some of the last words he wants to leave with us he says we can also look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people this world is insane absolutely insane it's the only way that describes the current political climate it's the only way that cur describes the uh the current woke-ism that exists it's the only thing that describes the reason why people have their platitudes and their reasonings and their rationale the inconsistencies in their positions the inconsistencies and what they lift up and support and some of the things that they say we believe in this we believe in that but then the very things that they lift up on this one side undermines their belief system on another and and then and they've lost their minds because they can't even recognize the the inconsistencies we believe in tolerance and we will not tolerate the intolerant right i'm sick and tired of people who don't have the love of god right it's like wait a minute what does that even mean he says we can't stay too much longer we've been a complete insane institution the whole world will be so we're at the end time the human mind is leaving the people the the condition that solomon diagnosed in ecclesiastes is prophetic to where now the entire world has access to whatever they want to have we can do whatever we want to achieve we've the the pinnacle of science has not placated man's fears the pinnacle of politics has not removed differences we've we've come to the very best that humankind has to offer and it's only created more fear more anxiety more depression i wanna i'm gonna read a statement and i realize now i don't have the proper attribution this is not plagiarism i just don't have the correct source i'm reading somebody else and if you could um i think this would be good for parents to listen to i'd even say ministers to listen to but young people i want you to recognize this and i'll also say this i know i'm not informing you of anything i don't think there's any young people sitting here today go never thought of that right you know where you live but the purpose of sharing this is so that you realize god's interested god knows this is the statement teen pregnancy and alcohol cigarette and drug use have fallen because these are some of the things that may be maybe if we went to losing louisiana youth camp in the 80s this is the things we would have heard priest against right rock and roll and alcohol and cigarettes and and these different things he says but pregnant teen pregnancy alcohol cigarette and drug use have fallen while anxiety depression suicide and self-harm have soared i wanted to recognize like teen pregnancy you're going to know eventually right cigarette use and drugs and alcohol these are things that can be done off-site but now it says anxiety depression and suicide and self-harm these are things that can be covered up in 2019 the american academy of pediatrics issued a report noting that mental health disorders have surpassed physical conditions as the most issues causing impairment and limitation among adolescents it's not physical things that are impairing our young people it's spiritual things mental health disorders have surpassed physical ailments physical things of drug addictions and pregnancies and fornications and indulgences of the flesh it's now mental anxieties and depression he says and the the writing says in december the u.s surgeon general in a rare public advisory warned of a devastating mental health crisis among american teens what is it's a despairing of life i mean for some of us we might be thinking as a parent you know we want to make sure that there's there's no drug paraphernalia we want to be sure that our children aren't fornicating we will be sure there's no alcohol and you can't be going to keg parties and don't be running off to the movies and and we're we want all these safeguards want to be sure our children aren't doing these physical things that are going to defile their body but the world we're realizing now that's not the problem anymore this isn't where young people are struggling amen we could get up here and rail all day long about cigarette use and preach against cigarettes and the evils of cigarettes and a lot of the young people like i need to ask my mom what those are right i mean rail against watching videotapes or something and you kids with your cds and your cassettes of led zeppelin and you're eight tracks of philip well i was gonna create this clear water revival you guys need to get saved and you'd be like who's merle haggard i don't even have any i don't know what you're talking about these are the things that young people are struggling with and to say that they've surpassed the physical conditions this is a despairing of life why is it why is it that they've ceased into these the fornicating and the drugs and the alcohol and those things because we've learned there's no fulfillment in those things we've learned it doesn't bring the satisfaction it doesn't give the enjoyment that's not where you fight it's not where it clicks so subsequent generations are learning it didn't do it for them so they're searching out other things to find happiness and we're starting to near the end of the road and as young people are saying generation after generation has lived they've sought out joy they've sought out happiness we now have everything at our fingertips we have everything at our disposal and it's still not making me happy i'm not they don't find it in sex they don't find it in drugs they don't find it in all these other things and therefore it's leading to a mental health crisis while we're suffering without meaning wow that's what despair is is to suffer without purpose there's an elevation of anxiety there's an elevation of depression it's a struggle for life amongst youth i i want this to be somewhat enlightening for somebody today that that weight that you wake up with in the morning that pit in your stomach that melancholy that blue feeling it's what this world has put on you of no choice of your own and there's a struggle for life amongst our young people i and i really feel the scariest part of your struggle it's not as obvious as the generation before you there's a you just don't have to back up very far and like i said whether it be teen pregnancy and alcohol and cigarette and drug use there was a time when the young people it was evident who struggled it was evident who was struggling but now the struggles are below the surface and the things that you're wrestling with aren't as obvious as it was in your parents the struggles of the youth today aren't aren't what strikes the eye but it's things in the heart the isolation that you feel the loneliness that you experience it's like well how are we alone you're in whatsapp groups and you have everyone around you but yet we're alone together and the frequency with which we can communicate and all the things that we can follow and others follow us it's only causing further isolation you think really in this day and age i've got so many friends i've got so many contacts i've got so many people messaging me and it never brings the satisfaction and young people are experiencing a loneliness epidemic and pandemic within themselves they don't feel connected even though they're connected in so many different ways it brings a dread one thing to consider and again i might say that i could be stating the obvious and it might be things that are very apparent to our to our parents uh but there's i think there's a dad joke in there when does a joke become a dad joke when it becomes apparent did you get that son did you get that my sons are cringing that this might this might be more informative to the adults but you're you have a young people have a private ecosystem that they operate within that that essentially never strikes the eye but it's available to them 24 7. there's no terminal in the kitchen that everyone goes to to check their email and and we hear the dial up they get on juno and they download their email and then when they're done we can go check and see what they read anything now they can take their devices and in the privacy of their room they have their own ecosystem that can be hid that can be turned off that can be shuttered it can be closed off that could even be can be walled off from anything that we try to access and see and young people exist within a private ecosystem that's where they're communicating that's where they're feeding that's where they're interacting and maybe it sounds like i'm talking beyond you but i'm talking to you for you to recognize we're living our lives within particular environments that are having an impact on our emotional health having an impact on our wants and our desires our ambitions and our pursuits and just be honest with yourself today whether or not you're finding your vibe whether or not you're really finding that this is good i like this this is happiness this is true joy and take a step back and give an honest look as to how much is deteriorating your joy your happiness your ambition and just how little you're getting out of that private life there's some of us that are living false lives we have different names different avatars different social lives different forums different apps different things that we're living within and it's a completely different existence than the one our families seeing the people at church see [Music] amen all right i'll move on i want to bring this to a close that's just a generic reference but humanity went from genesis chapter 2 naked and not ashamed bare simple no fear no anxiety no worry about the future to ecclesiastes 2 17. therefore i hated life why what's the reason simple we can save the fall this is exactly what solomon said i this is what i figured out god made man right god made man holy he made him upright but then he sought out so many different inventions so many different he's mixed himself with endless things this is what's created the anxiety within mankind what is this what is this result of the works of satan this is what he began in the beginning but remember it was necessary to god's purpose isn't that remarkable it was necessary to god's purpose so brother bannon makes this statement god being a savior it was necessary that he predestined a man who would require salvation now this is this is inerrant in this is inherent in god this is part of his essential nature and character he is a savior and he creates a man and a woman who are perfect in a perfect eden and there's a mystery to god that can never be expressed in that condition man and the woman could have lived eons and eons in terms of time they could have lived for an eternity and the god that created them in the perfection they were experiencing with the perfect love of god around him they would have never understood the full mystery of god because he was a savior and in order to be a savior he had to predestinate a man who would require salvation and listen i know you know the phrase in order to give himself reason and purpose of being that god himself i want you to catch just how deep this is the lonely god in the beginning himself longed for something else that would satisfy his deepest desire and he would never find it in his eternal power he would never find it in his endless strength he could never find it in his supreme knowledge he was gonna find it in you hallelujah the very god of creation and eternity it was necessary to bring you forth hallelujah [Applause] just to think that that man is walking in the same pattern and god could even look up and say i can relate to that step like that anxiety in a sense that longing and that passion and that neediness and god said i've created jill to satisfy my heart desire i've created jail to satisfy that missing peace and it gave he says it gave god reason and purpose to be that god without you has no reason to exist [Applause] that the eternal god without you has no purpose in existing that god that god had to have you in order to have motivation that's what reason it's motive motivation and purpose objective so now god then has a motivation and a goal god himself had a reason and purpose of being that's existence god because god is the one that feels all time and space the god that existed beforehand he had to have a reason to be god had a reason that motivated his existence that gave meaning to his his life his zoe therefore just as god had a reason to exist we must find our reason to live amen and what i've described to you today this evening are the works of satan and so in first john chapter 3 verse 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested so it's coming back to reason god had a purpose god had a purpose god a purpose for this purpose was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil the things that solomon describes in ecclesiastes are only limited remedy through jesus christ amen because it's through christ that the works of the devil are destroyed are you catching that i'm just making it very simple for you it's through christ that the works of the devil are destroyed your anxiety your depression your melancholy your temptations your dissatisfaction uh your your uh your addictions and even your dependencies and the relationships where there's a tendency in young men to get very possessive and jealous and pursue things endlessly they become they become stalkers they become unable to be satisfied they've got to pursue something sisters likewise can get that way these dependencies and these sensations and these things we try to achieve these are all the works of the devil there's only one that can destroy that hold on you that's jesus christ [Applause] brother adam says if they don't accept god's provided comforter then they have to get some other comforter because you can't live without something to live for you can't live without something to live for and so it's in you it's part of you to try to seek some purpose to try to seek out some meaning and to try to find something in your life whether it be a relationship or an accolade or a pursuit i want something to give me meaning and if you forsake god's provided comforter you'll try to find something else to live for i'm trying to hurry i'm going going a little bit long i apologize i think i left myself two extra hours last night so i think technically i got five hours tonight if that's how it works nobody say anything ecclesiastes chapter 12. we're just coming to the conclusion verse one remember now thy creator in the days of that youth this is solomon's conclusion this is he's coming to the end of it we've worked through several passages and so now he's going to impart to us wisdom after looking at everything and realizing life it cannot be remedied by pursuing things the flesh we i cannot wisdom will not satisfy it a a working won't do it and pre in music confessions and all these things it'll never satisfy so what does he do he speaks to young people says remember the lord and he uses the language that i think that wants to clue you in remember now thy creator it's not just the lord not just remember god not remember elohim he wants to bring it all the way back to the beginning before he even begin to reveal his name to abraham before he begin to reveal himself to the people which was part of the plan of redemption he wants to bring you all the way back to the beginning remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth do it when you're young and he comes to verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man amen i i'm just wanting to quickly reference this he brings it back to the beginning why because this is the only thing that can remedy the curse it's the only thing that speaks to the confusion remember god in the days of you come to know him early on recognize his intent and his purpose see that he in the beginning had a reason and purpose of existence and it had something to do with you it was disobedience to the word that uh and leaving god's purpose that brought the fall so the only way back is through coming to god's purpose again amen social social things will never do it right social connections your education will never do it politics will never do it science will never do it there's a lot of things we could try to pursue if i if i could say it here there's there's no essential oil that's going to figure it out for you [Music] you can burn all the ear cones you want in your ear to pull all the wax out and it's not going to help you in this we could get a lavender tattoo on the bottom of our big toe and it's not going to bring us the peace we crave there's only one way you can find peace and fulfillment in this chaotic age let's do an experience with the word brother madam writes this in the church age book he says what can help only one thing is needful return to christ look into christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith as the heavenly master built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of god which belongs to us all amen this revealed word belongs to you young people with the bible in our hand we should cry i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised but the bible in our hands he says this ought to be our cry i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his command i hope for that which he has promised he says christians give ear there's only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one christ but a thousand antichrist so thou knowest o christendom what is the one thing needful either thou turn us back to christ or thou goes to the destruction like the antichrist if thou art wise and will live follow the leader of life i know it seems very very simple but that's all i'm proposing to you to young people today is there's only one answer to all the anxiety there's only one answer to all the fear there's only one answer to the things you struggle with it's christ amen it is through christ that you'll find a reason to live follow the leader of life only one thing is needful set it aside all the ways until we reach the goal there's only one life but death comes in a thousand forms only one christ but a thousand antichrist as i want to draw this to a close i i i know that it may seem dark and uh hopeless in your life again there might be some of you that think you're just killing it right now and you're living your best life and so maybe it's not apparent to you right now what your needs are there's another condition that is becoming more and more evident amongst young people is we're just numb we experience so much disappointment and hurt that we want to numb ourselves to the pain of our personal interactions and the side effect is since we want to numb ourselves to pain we numb ourselves to joy we numb ourselves to other experiences and it makes it harder for us to feel the presence of god it makes it harder for us to feel him wooing our hearts why because we've become so defensive and so numb we become so calloused some of us are just really dead we're dead inside we're struggling to live but maybe perhaps at some point for the last two services something was said and there was a light that blinked inside of you maybe something at some point through everything that's being said as you were kind of sitting there thinking yeah these are just these are the same tropes that every preacher rolls out this is just some another you know dad in his 40s trying to be cool whatever it might be but all of a sudden something said you're like huh maybe there's something inside of you like a little light like some kind of spark for a moment it gave you hope my title tonight is declared faith so i just laid a foundation i'm like to preach now declared faith why because there's a gene of life inside of you it's crying out inside of you but so many things cover it up so many things are around it but every once while something something gets through and it sparks something it creates a little bit of a hunger and so i believe that there's a gene of life on the inside of you and as we mentioned last night about a deliberate faith i i move it into this realm of a declared faith that a faith is made clear a faith that is made known a faith that expresses itself a faith that that it makes an announcement and and i'm just very quickly coming to the thrust and i've even tried to preserve uh myself whether it be in my voice and my in my mind and my energy to bring it to this place where we can express it to you tonight that if there's a spark if there's a life if it's if it's moved just even the slightest bit if it's kicked just a little bit if it's the least desire then there's more in that than the world can offer there's more power in that than anything in the world today one of the one of the biggest lies that satan has told the young people is that your little desire for god is weaker than your great desire for the world but the truth is the smallest teeniest tiniest bit of desire for christ is greater than every addiction every love every lust every want so when i say declared faith what is what struck my heart is there there's a it's a moment right now where you you want it to declare you want it to speak you want it to act you want it to move and the moment of the momentum of the meetings and the moment of the presence of god the very thing that seems so far out of reach for you some of you thought i could never do it i'll never do it it'll always be out of reach because when i tried before i failed but now you come right back to the same place again and you're afraid to move because you don't want to fail and it's the devil lying to you [Applause] it's a time to make your faith known to express it hallelujah it's god by the preaching of the word just comes and he touches you yeah and he finds some spot in your heart and he touches it and you know it's him you know he's touched you you know it's something beyond yourself you know it's something that's discerning your life you know it right now that god has come in and he's just touched you and in that moment when you're touched he wants you to answer back to him it's a declaration of faith is that not what repentance is not when he touches you that's sovereign that's god godly sorrow leadeth a man to repentance you never led yourself to repentance it's god that does it so what's the what's the declaration i've been pricked in my heart i repent of my sins you've declared faith amen what is water baptism it's declared faith that when you know that your sins have been forgiven then there's this declaration like what's the whole point getting wet what's the whole point it's an outward sign that you know your sins have been forgiven that's why if you when the bible even says that it's all according to your belief and according to your faith is it believeth and is baptized they shall be saved but it says he that believeth not is lost it doesn't even talk about baptism why because it's rooted in the faith a man who has truly believed and know he's repented even post seal of god will go to the water as a declaration of faith that their sins have been forgiven amen and i miss you in a challenge tonight if god has spoken to your heart respond if he's reached into you somewhere and touched respond we closed last night in first kings 19. god just supernaturally took that right back into my notes i'd had it in my notes i took it out earlier this week i thought it's too much and then i thought maybe i'll get to it saturday night and i'd already had my notes for saturday night done i realized they weren't even in there and i'm like well maybe i won't get to elisha at all god said i don't need to take everything else out put this back in why because you're that you're you're you can see yourselves in elisha elisha he's just he's just minding his own business right he's just going to youth weekend he's just plowing just playing volleyball just enjoying himself and all of a sudden a mantle is thrown on him it's going about everyday life and a mantle comes on him and in that moment that this mantle comes on him he's touched so he he kind of he kind of moves a little bit and he tells elijah i'm going to go back and say goodbye to everybody and elijah's just like fine go back to the plow let's go back to the plow and it's then that the seriousness and the soberness of this mantle strikes elisha and he realizes i've got to declare my faith i've got to abandon the plow i have no more backs up i have no more contingencies and he acted on it tonight if you felt the mantle what's your move brother brahman says we can preach to our horse and our lungs fall out until the people make a move you'll never do nothing amen i mean it's not the preacher because he can preach until he's hoarse and his lungs fall out i think he's being figurative there he says you'll never do nothing that's you got to make them move and believe it he says brethren do it tonight do it tonight stand up for the word stand for the living word of the living god god will manifest it and always there's a part that you have to do i've it was january 5th of this year that god gave me everything i'm sharing with you tonight i've been thinking about this for over five months under the weight of it under the pressure of it and knowing this was thus saith the lord to you tonight and now i've delivered it and i've done all i can but you've got to move there's a moment at which the mantra is laid upon you the minister's priesthood the mantle's been delivered but now you've got to do something and i'm telling you right now if you move god will manifest it musicians if you could come some of you just think very deeply now i know it's a unique way of ministry i realize that but i trust that god's finding you touching you working around your complexes getting to that spot to where you know he's talking to you i want to i want to use something and i hope that this i hope that this can touch touch the real heart now and the neonatal intensive care units just for the newly born i want to use this image now in the medical terminology that there is a there's a phrase that they use when babies are born very premature or or with life-threatening complications and so at the moment of the when a baby's born they could have very terrible complications life-threatening complications and just by all appearances it looks as if this baby is more than likely going to die or babies that are born so premature that the likelihood of survival is very very remote and it's a very difficult situation this moment because even science realizes in a lot of ways they can artificially preserve existence and there are certain functions of the body that even even in this at this stage they can just kind of keep going but it's not apparent to them whether or not the baby can actually live because right we realize there's a difference between really living but in the scripture that loving kindness is better than life that means what is that because what could be better than life there's something greater than just the the functions of the body operating and so there's a decision that has to be made by medical professionals there's decisions that even parents have to make that's excruciating in this moment all the anticipation and expectation has led to this moment and now they're in this place where there's life-threatening complications or a very premature baby and it's in a life or death scenario that they're looking and they have to make a decision what should we do what should we do should we intervene should we try to sustain its life and in this moment everyone is trying to discern the baby's strength of will in other words at the very moment that there's a point at which the doctor's concern is the mother but as soon as the baby comes forth the doctor they'll now everyone's eye is turned to the the baby and they're looking at the baby and they're saying well can it live can it survive these the deformities can survive these complications and they're wanting to recognize where does the baby stand in all this i read of an example a baby was born at 23 weeks it was one pound four ounces i wanted to maybe find a doll to do it show you but it was the size of a barbie doll can you imagine that the size of a barbie doll its head was the size of a tennis ball its skin was nearly translucent they're looking at this baby that you could have just held in your hand like this and it was so small and so translucent you could actually see the heart flicker in its chest [Music] and the phrase they're born at the edge of viability and they look at this baby in that condition and they ask the question would it be better to save her life or let her die think about that and this moment they asked themselves should we let it die or should we try to save it title of an article i read and again this is something i read years ago god has never inspired it for me to preach but he he's brought it to you tonight i'm telling you this is years ago this has been i've been on my heart to share and the question was does anyone here think this baby can live [Music] does anyone here think these young people can live and in that moment the phrase that they use all eyes are now looked at looking at the baby they've done everything they can do the baby is delivered they've come to this point whereas there's a lot of things we can do to intervene there's a lot of things we could do to try to sustain this it's natural life and just keep it breathing maybe keep the heart beating and they look at and they step back and there comes a moment when this is the phrase they use they're looking for the baby to declare itself this doctor says i have to wait and let the baby declare itself and this heart of this doctor as he says this he says breathe cry show signs of life lord it comes to a point where now it's up to the baby one pound four ounces the size of a barbie doll a head the size of a tennis ball the flicker of the heart can be seen through translucent skin and they're looking at the baby and they know there's physiological things that are just that just babies do that bodies do there are certain things that are just going to be the reflexes of a muscle and so they're looking at trying to discern is there a desire is there a desire in this baby that wants to live and everyone's waiting with their breath anticipating for it to do what declare itself oh please in this moment this baby declare yourself do something and let us know you want to live do something to let us know that it's going to be worth every effort do something to declare that i want to live i want to live and i believe that we've arrived at a moment tonight we'll hear you sit in the darkest haze that there's ever been and i say will you declare yourself can you do it can you declare yourself declare your deliberate faith i've got that with a motive and objective behind it i say i thought about it it was just an image to me that was very hard to shake and if you want to live it says we're waiting for it to declare itself then you have to declare yourself who you really are you have to declare it's not and i heard it it's not the it's not what you want in your body it's not what you want in your spirit it's what you want your soul something beyond all that brother tim dodd ministered this at our home church in phoenix he said he was talking about hannah he said it's in a woman in her nature in her body her physical makeup to want a baby and so she can want one she could declare one he said and i'm using it maybe in my terminology they said even in their spirit it's the mother's nature you know what should her spirit she can want to have a baby it's a longing but hannah didn't cry from her body or her spirit she cried out from her soul and it was her sole purpose and when she cried out she said give me a son that i may give him back to you and god didn't just answer the natural desire he didn't answer a spiritual spirit desire he answered the soul purpose why it had declared itself in a painful desire and i want you to if you can imagine the icu and the needle natal unit how that all the doctors are standing back all the nurses are standing back the father and the mother all waiting what are we waiting for what are you waiting for we're waiting for this baby to say i want to live and all of heaven stands back all the angels stand back tonight and they're waiting for that moment that you'll take god in his word and step right into the furnace and declare your faith [Applause] to say i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands i hope for what he's promised with your head's bowed i've challenged you tonight to declare yourself wrestle it out with the lord declare yourself tonight young people this is the air i breathe this is the air i breathe your very presence [Music] living in me this is the air i breathe this is the air [Music] this is the air i breathe your holy presence [Music] living in me this is my

breathe i hunger for your presence lord your holy praises not just on me lord believe it it's gonna give me a reason to live lord in me so lord i'm gonna live by your word this is my daily bread this

singing that you're not ashamed to let the world know that you're nothing without him and without him you don't have purpose without him you don't have reason without him nothing makes sense and you're not ashamed to say that the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me and you're not ashamed of it say i'm nothing without you and god in some way is answered back honey neither am i without you because you give me motivation you give me reason and purpose to exist so take these hands and lift them up [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] without you listening that again take these hands take these and lift them up [Music] for i am nothing oh i [Applause] [Music] this is your declaration i am nothing oh i am nothing without lift your hands and voice of praise tonight oh to [Music] we'll see that i am nothing [Music] [Music] tonight come on elisha break the plow burn the plows [Applause] [Music] take my body and build it up take my body [Music] [Applause] for i am nothing oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh god don't hold nothing back tonight without all [Applause] [Music] singing as a prayer young people declare your own son of david have mercy on me tonight and all my eyes i'm reaching out to touch the head of your garment oh god i'm declaring myself tonight [Music] declare your faith tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] take my time here on this earth and take [Music] [Music] [Applause] without you oh my soul [Applause] [Music] glory will see that i have nothing [Music] how many believe you heard from the lord you know you may not have known young person tonight that you may not have known that god has access to all your social feeds you may not have realized that he sees your chats and you know something he's not here tonight to expose you to the world but he'd very much like to expose you to you i can promise you he sees the loneliness he sees those dark places god sees you know that's that's the that's the literal definition of jehovah jireh god sees and we'll see to it that's how he's a provider that's how he's a provider that means he can provide everything i need because there's nothing i need he's not aware of you know i was thinking tonight his brother aaron was ministering and you were hearing a trumpet of god that's what the gospel is do you know that you're hearing a trumpet of god and i thought about the days when the fire came down on the mountain and moses had everything prepared and all the people and they had they had sent out notices and everybody showed up to the meeting and everybody was ready and and pastor moses was ready and god was ready and the people were they thought they were ready and then god showed up and the mountain caught on fire and the ground shook and even moses said i'd begin to quake and tremble and the people all rolled back at the sound of the drum and said when it sounded loud and long and the people withdrew and moses turned to him and said no no no no don't don't go back he wants to talk to you come forward come forward don't don't don't run away from him run to him hallelujah you heard a trumpet tonight i want to tell you don't run from it run to it tonight it's a trumpet of liberty it's a trumpet where god can take direction in your life how many want that yes amen amen you know i thought to myself when does an idea you know we have many stories of great heroes and i just sit there pondering all the heroes you know and you history is replete with people who did valiant acts of in war and battle when the fighting was the fiercest and they charged into they ran toward the sound of explosions and toward the sound of screams and you know it takes a real hero you might be afraid but you go and do you do it anyway that's that's real courage and i just thought about that i thought what when does an idea when does a feeling something in your heart when does a reality young people become more important to you than your own life's blood that that a mere idea that comes into your heart can become so paramount to you that you will charge into a fierce battle at perhaps the cost of it amen the cost of your life the cost of your blood you heard a trumpet tonight friends i want to invite you tonight to say lord god tonight i heard your trumpet and i i i realize the world is thinking we're just going to go on and on and on and they're they're looking to the stars they're looking to mars and they're making all these plans but yet every metric i look at it in the world tells me it's not going to go on it's ending and i'm here to tell you i've been saying to my church a long time there's catastrophic judgments rushing to this earth and the only way out what is it friends up how many want to go up tonight say oh god i don't want to run i don't want to draw back from a trumpet sound i have i have adopted this word tonight and i've taken it into my heart and i'm inspirable by this word tonight and i want to run toward it i want to run toward it i want to step forward and say lord god i'll take the way with the despised brother branham comes to a pulpit in 1961 and preaches a beautiful message called a message of grace and in there he reminds us from god's message to zerubbabel during the days when the restoration was underway he said remember it's not by power it's not by might it's by my spirit brother branham says now i'm going to interpret that he says the headstone comes with shoutings of grace grace grace that's a trumpet friends how many want to run toward grace tonight are you willing to step forward and say i'll take the way with the lord's despised few this world holds nothing i realize tonight the pursuit of happiness is only in christ it's only in the word of god for this hour oh i want to ask brother matt to sing for us some more and i want you to ponder tonight the trumpet sound that you've heard you've heard a trumpet sound god has shown up on purpose the same god as brother aaron was showing us that created on purpose he put you here on purpose everything that has happened in your life god has been in control of that to me that gives me a peace that passes understanding because if you're like me and if i'm like you i know i could never earn it on my own but i'm tell you something friends it's not by my might or by my own power by your power by your education by your strength by your influence by your social footprint by your by your wh where whatever station you are in life it's because that god had grace on purpose for me and for you don't you love him for that fringe oh are there are there patriots are there champions or there are brave people tonight in this building who will say i'll go forward i'll give my life for this i'll go forward for this i'm not i'm in this thing to make heaven my home i'm here you know when if it comes crying grace unto you then what is god looking for he's looking for a reflection how many are willing to say i'll come crying christ i'll reflect that i'll be that that that element of grace that god can move on and have reason and purpose for his own self because i allowed him to have grace in my life that is beyond a privilege that is beyond a solemn privilege that god has offered us let's sing it son little girl was lying there people all were weeping they just laughed at jesus when he said she's only sleepy [Music] but as he took her by the hand oh yeah she began to live again hallelujah some began to praise the lord some began to say he's in the house hallelujah now dance
