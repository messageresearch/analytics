[31:30] God sent Christ to die for the ungodly
[31:34] don't we appreciate him today
[31:36] this is power is together
[31:39] Heavenly Father for many of us we've
[31:41] been singing about this love and talking
[31:44] about it for decades of Our Lives
[31:48] and it's still so moves us when we think
[31:51] about it
[31:52] it wants you to know how much we love
[31:54] you today
[31:56] it's not a Marvel that I could love you
[31:59] and how could you love me
[32:02] and I know when you look at me you look
[32:04] at these people you're today it's not
[32:07] so much our all Humanity that you love
[32:10] but it's that part of yourself
[32:13] Lord Jesus we thank you
[32:16] dear God I pray today that you would
[32:19] help us
[32:20] that we would be able to
[32:23] walk out of this building today after
[32:26] these meetings hopefully something's
[32:28] been said that'll help each of us to be
[32:31] better better equipped better people
[32:33] better Christians
[32:35] we know there's not much time left
[32:37] for the last seed to be illuminated
[32:40] I'm reminded of the words of your
[32:42] Prophet as you set it down in Tampa in
[32:44] 1964 and he said we wonder why things
[32:47] aren't moving along
[32:49] and he said maybe it's like this there's
[32:52] a little girl or a little boy that was
[32:55] born over in Seattle Washington
[32:58] that book holds their name the church
[33:01] WIll slug along play along have meetings
[33:05] and so forth until that child
[33:08] is old enough to receive it
[33:12] that's how much you love one of yours
[33:14] father
[33:15] you can't take the 99 and leave one
[33:18] you've got to take all your seed home
[33:22] Lord if there's one here today that's
[33:24] not ready one that's maybe saved and
[33:27] just not filled with the Holy Ghost
[33:28] would you get your children ready Lord
[33:31] so we can leave this place
[33:35] ask your father in the name of Jesus
[33:37] take your word and speak to us
[33:39] give us ears to hear Hearts to receive
[33:42] we ask you father in Jesus name
[33:45] amen
[33:46] amen thank you Lord praise the Lord
[33:52] thank you Lord Jesus
[33:54] Mark chapter 5. verse 22.
[33:58] I want to say it's been such a privilege
[34:00] for
[34:01] Carol and myself and our two oldest
[34:04] granddaughters I think Courtney got to
[34:05] come down and be with us on this trip
[34:07] and we've certainly enjoyed being here
[34:09] an opportunity I always enjoy being my
[34:13] brother brother Jason don't get to see
[34:15] him that much anymore we're all so busy
[34:17] everybody's got so much going on but
[34:19] counted a great privilege to be able to
[34:21] be with the saints of God I know of no
[34:24] higher honor than to be able to speak to
[34:27] the Queen of Heaven
[34:29] it's a great privilege to be able to do
[34:31] that I'd like to ask you if you'd be
[34:33] remembering our daughter Erica she'll be
[34:36] going down Wednesday to Nashville and
[34:39] then we'll be taking another one of
[34:40] these treatments that they're giving or
[34:42] and it's a very serious
[34:45] thing that they do it's called ludothera
[34:48] they bring it out on a cart in a lead
[34:51] case because it's so radioactive after
[34:55] she takes it she remains radioactive for
[34:58] 30 days her daughters can't be around
[35:01] her for several several days because it
[35:04] could affect them being girls
[35:06] she certainly needs prayer and we're
[35:09] believing the Lord we serve almighty God
[35:12] no one amen so if you would I know you
[35:15] have so much to pray about as well
[35:16] during this day but if you just remember
[35:18] her we certainly would appreciate it and
[35:20] I know you have I know it's not
[35:21] something that you just start doing
[35:24] Mark chapter 5 verse 22.
[35:27] and behold there come us one of the
[35:29] rulers of the synagogue Jarius by name
[35:32] and when he saw him
[35:34] he fell at his feet
[35:37] and besought him greatly saying
[35:44] my little daughter
[35:47] well that's the point of this how pretty
[35:49] thee
[35:51] come and lay thy hands on her
[35:54] that she may be healed
[35:57] then she shall live
[36:00] and Jesus went with him
[36:03] and much people followed him
[36:06] and thronged him
[36:08] may the Lord bless his word you may be
[36:10] seated
[36:12] keep your Bible there if you would and
[36:15] read with me in verse 38.
[36:19] he cometh to the house of the ruler of
[36:22] the synagogue and seeth of tomal
[36:25] and them that wept and wailed greatly
[36:28] and when he was come in he saith unto
[36:31] them why make ye this ado and weep
[36:36] the damsel is not dead
[36:39] but sleepeth
[36:41] I want to ask you
[36:43] if you would have been in that scenario
[36:45] what would you have thought about this
[36:47] statement
[36:48] and this man who made this statement so
[36:52] say it was your daughter or your niece
[36:54] or somebody in the church family
[36:57] somebody that you knew one of your
[36:59] friends and you walk in and there the
[37:01] child is dead it's evident there's no
[37:04] breath there's no respiration there's no
[37:06] heart rate there's absolutely nothing at
[37:08] all
[37:09] and Ian walks this guy which has a very
[37:12] strange reputation among the people he's
[37:15] thought of to be very very odd
[37:18] individual and he says hey don't y'all
[37:21] cry everything's good it's okay she is
[37:24] not dead
[37:25] well you're saying everything that you
[37:27] know about deaths testifies that she is
[37:31] dead there's nothing about life looking
[37:34] at her the damn soul is not dead but
[37:38] sleepeth now he's using two two streams
[37:41] of language
[37:43] he's using his Divine language but he
[37:46] also is using the Earthly language and
[37:49] this is where it can become tricky
[37:50] sometimes and they left him to scorn
[37:54] but when he had put them all out he'd
[37:56] taketh the father and the mother of the
[37:59] damsel and them that were with him and
[38:02] interest into where the damsel was lying
[38:06] he took the damsel by the hand and said
[38:09] unto her talise Kuma which is being
[38:13] interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise
[38:20] and straightway the damsel arose and
[38:25] walked so she was at the age of 12 years
[38:29] and they were astonished was great
[38:33] astonishment now I'd like to speak to
[38:35] you this morning on just a simple salt
[38:37] he proves his word
[38:40] now he had said to jerice that if you
[38:43] will believe
[38:44] you'll see God do something in your home
[38:47] now that was the word of God
[38:50] And yet when he got to the house and it
[38:53] seemed that what he had said there's no
[38:56] way for it to come to pass but the word
[38:59] had already been spoken so now he must
[39:04] act on that word and prove his word now
[39:08] there's a certain element of the word as
[39:10] we've looked at in the two prior
[39:11] services that Believers will not fulfill
[39:15] there are certain scriptures I have no
[39:19] desire whatsoever to fulfill
[39:23] Believers about Infidel scriptures about
[39:25] infidels make when lukewarm people
[39:27] people that Liars that don't pertain to
[39:30] me at all you understand there are
[39:33] scriptures that say there's going to
[39:34] come a great falling away I have no
[39:36] desire whatsoever to fulfill that
[39:38] scripture but yet there are scriptures
[39:40] that are written about us now there are
[39:44] certain scriptures that we cannot
[39:46] fulfill and we never will fulfill
[39:48] because they do not pertain to us then
[39:51] on the other side of that there are
[39:53] scriptures that unbelievers make
[39:56] Believers infidels agnostics they can
[39:59] never fulfill because they are written
[40:01] about us so what I want to do myself is
[40:05] find that which is written about me and
[40:08] let God fulfill that portion in my life
[40:12] and those scriptures no doubt that you
[40:14] will fulfill maybe there's Brothers my
[40:17] goodness in the ministry I I feel just
[40:19] absolutely so small and so little trying
[40:21] to even preach in front of them because
[40:24] they're great Servants of God that God
[40:26] is used but yet I know at the same time
[40:28] I can't take their place and they can't
[40:30] take mine so God will use me in a
[40:33] certain way that maybe he wouldn't use
[40:34] them and vice versa and once we see that
[40:37] there's really no room for jealousy and
[40:39] all that sort of thing so we just be
[40:42] what God has made each of us and then we
[40:44] all coalesce together and we work to
[40:47] accomplish exactly what God wants when
[40:50] we do that we root out you know all this
[40:53] jealousy whether it's among preachers
[40:54] and musicians or singers or whatever
[40:57] more and we know that God allocates his
[40:59] gifts and he allocates them in sizes
[41:01] according to that which pleases him so
[41:04] after all if I give you a dollar if I
[41:06] give you five I give you twenty I give
[41:08] you a hundred and I give my wife a
[41:09] thousand
[41:11] you notice how I worded that right and
[41:14] so if I do that and you know it's
[41:15] actually was fine to give so you're
[41:18] going to tell me I'm unjust because I
[41:20] give her a thousand I'll give you 50
[41:21] cents well you know that's just the way
[41:23] that it works because it was mine to
[41:25] give uh we we bought clothes for our
[41:28] granddaughters for years and years now
[41:30] because we got three sets of twin
[41:32] granddaughters someone ever go to Ross
[41:33] and we go to TJ Maxx and it'll always be
[41:36] you know it was little girls dresses and
[41:38] little girls shoes and little girls this
[41:40] and there was a lady one time at the TJ
[41:42] Maxx at home and she said sir don't you
[41:45] ever get anything don't you ever get
[41:48] anything because she just kept noticing
[41:50] Carol was buying these little dresses
[41:52] and then Carol would find her something
[41:53] and I said ma'am we made this agreement
[41:56] you know 40 some years ago be 48 no this
[41:59] July whenever we got married and we we
[42:02] made this agreement that everything or
[42:04] 50 will be everything is going to be 50
[42:07] 50 between me and Carol my wife that is
[42:11] I get 50 cents she gets fifty dollars 50
[42:15] 50. ah some of you sisters really like
[42:19] that statement
[42:21] foreign
[42:22] sister Debbie said amen
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:28] so you see God is the one who has all
[42:30] these gifts and he's the one who gives
[42:33] them out but each one of us should
[42:35] desire to be able to find what the Lord
[42:37] wants us to be is that right and when we
[42:40] do that then we're able to receive what
[42:42] Paul said that they compare themselves
[42:44] among themselves are not wise so the
[42:47] worst thing we can do is to be able to
[42:49] compare even our walk even our element
[42:52] of Faith you know what I'm saying
[42:54] there's certain people it just seem like
[42:55] they are so gifted in faith they just
[42:58] have such ability and they can just look
[43:00] at the promise of God it makes no
[43:02] difference what it is and others she
[43:04] might they struggle with faith and Satan
[43:07] will try to take that and say oh you're
[43:08] not as good a Christian well maybe
[43:10] you've got a strong point in another
[43:11] Avenue that that person that has the
[43:14] strong faith they don't have you
[43:16] understand you look at it that God puts
[43:18] all this into the body by measures and
[43:21] then this is why it's evident that we
[43:23] need one another there is no preacher
[43:26] that is complete and has the total
[43:27] understanding of everything in this word
[43:30] we need each other and we actually
[43:33] complement each other is that right so
[43:36] God knows exactly what we're doing and
[43:38] want to be able to make the body of God
[43:40] work effectually as Paul says in
[43:42] Ephesians that each one each joint would
[43:45] Supply and bring forth the effectual
[43:48] working of the body now we know of
[43:50] course that the Lord Jesus when he was
[43:52] here that he had the entire ocean for he
[43:55] was the fullness of the godhead bodily I
[43:58] might have a little dropper full and you
[44:00] might have three and brother Jason might
[44:02] have five and you know all the rest of
[44:04] you have your little portion but the
[44:05] Lord Jesus was the fullness of the
[44:08] godhead bodily so he would be able to
[44:10] cover aspects by which none of us would
[44:13] ever do but what I also know about that
[44:16] if the Lord Jesus would have healed
[44:18] everybody in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria
[44:21] and the areas of Galilee that would have
[44:24] been no sick fault for his disciples to
[44:26] heal so I wonder how many that the Lord
[44:29] Jesus walked by in the in the Capernaum
[44:33] synagogue and other places I wonder the
[44:35] man that laid their whenever the
[44:37] Bible tells us in the book of Acts that
[44:39] the apostles walked through there and
[44:41] they saw this man laying there he'd been
[44:43] laying there for a long time I
[44:45] personally believe myself that the Lord
[44:47] Jesus left that man there for his boys
[44:49] to take care of later
[44:52] now think of it no doubt the Lord Jesus
[44:54] walked by many of those people but he
[44:57] wanted a work left behind for the
[44:59] ministry that was going to continue on
[45:01] whenever he was gone he does the same
[45:04] thing today so here we find that God is
[45:07] now going to prove his word I love the
[45:10] way brother Branham deals with this and
[45:12] it makes it kind of sad in one way for
[45:14] the unbelievers but he said improving
[45:16] his word in paragraph 108 he proves his
[45:19] word in every age by the most unusual
[45:22] way but he always does it in the same
[45:25] way see it's what he does in the days of
[45:28] Noah when he's fixing to deliver the
[45:30] remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he
[45:33] sent Noah a sign so God used Noah and
[45:37] part of his family to prove his word but
[45:41] yet he used the unbelievers to prove the
[45:44] other side of that word that he was
[45:46] going to send a flood he never actually
[45:48] sent the waters to drown Noah but he
[45:51] said sent the waters to save Noah so
[45:55] what God did was God gave Manoa the
[45:58] perimeter of the size the specks and all
[46:00] that sort of thing to build a boat now
[46:03] can you imagine this man is building a
[46:05] boat and we have no no record no history
[46:07] that Noah ever built a boat before as a
[46:11] matter of fact his occupation was a
[46:13] farmer this took a lot of face if you
[46:15] don't mind me saying it this way to step
[46:18] on a boat built by a farmer that was not
[46:21] a carpenter
[46:24] but yet God believed that Noah could
[46:28] build this boat now I want you to also
[46:31] notice that God never gave Noah any uh
[46:34] remedies any type of layout any types of
[46:38] plans to build a trailer for this boat
[46:41] and the reason was God was going to
[46:44] bring the water to the boat and Noah
[46:47] wouldn't have to take the boat to the
[46:49] water now you see we know according to
[46:51] what brother Brown said that there was
[46:53] other boats that were being built in
[46:56] that day so no doubt some of them saw
[46:58] Noah and they said well you know what if
[47:00] he can build a boat we're professional
[47:02] boat Builders so we'll build one just in
[47:05] case this old man's got something from
[47:07] God so when these other Boats were built
[47:10] they become actually a Temptation for
[47:14] people not to go to the one God ordained
[47:17] you see that's where we had to be so
[47:19] careful and I find it amazing brother
[47:21] Jason her brother Ram says him about God
[47:23] provide a place of worship that God
[47:26] actually allows these other gates to be
[47:29] there and he said we'll find out in a
[47:31] little while while they are there that
[47:33] God allows those Gates those plates of
[47:35] worship to be put there as a temptation
[47:38] to you oh I know that staggers people
[47:41] but you see God if there's only one boat
[47:43] in the land where do you figure most
[47:45] people would have went when it started
[47:47] raining but when it first started
[47:49] raining can you imagine some of them
[47:51] people that never seen rain before never
[47:53] heard it before but it starts dripping
[47:56] and coming down and what do some of them
[47:58] do well they head over there because
[48:00] that guy's a boat builder they head over
[48:02] here this guy's an architect they head
[48:04] over there and by doing all of that it
[48:07] actually hindered them in the Final
[48:09] Phase of the third pull from coming to
[48:12] the only boat that was God blessed and
[48:15] God ordained there are churches churches
[48:18] Brides brides churches churches Brides
[48:22] brides but there's one that's gonna calm
[48:24] that house most mechanics and Dynamics
[48:28] certainly your little small community
[48:30] you're your little town no doubt you
[48:33] past churches to come to this one today
[48:35] did you not and no doubt you might have
[48:37] even passed some message churches along
[48:39] the way and Satan has done this for
[48:42] countless of years because he knows that
[48:45] it confuses the mind of the unlearned so
[48:49] if God is going to do something Satan
[48:51] will impersonate it but God never
[48:53] ordained not one of those other boats
[48:56] and when the flood came every one of
[48:59] them sang so if I was you I'd try to
[49:01] find God's boat for the hour now folks
[49:04] are jumping out of this message boat
[49:06] right and left well if that's what they
[49:08] wish to do that's up to them but this is
[49:10] the only one that's ordained by God
[49:13] according to Malachi 4. so for me and my
[49:16] house we're staying in the boat
[49:19] well praise the Lord what about it for
[49:22] me and my house I'm staying in this boat
[49:25] now we know that God then has this
[49:28] pattern that he starts and he will
[49:30] allocate a certain portion of his word
[49:33] and he doesn't always make it known of
[49:36] course when he speaks the prophetic
[49:37] utterance from The Prophet's mouth that
[49:40] he will associate this man this woman
[49:42] with that word but God will sow the seed
[49:45] and then the time will roll around and
[49:47] there'll be somebody that will raise up
[49:49] that has an anointing that actually
[49:51] moves on the word and I know you know
[49:53] this because you got great preachers
[49:54] here but in the beginning God divided
[49:57] the logos he separated the logos from
[50:01] the anointing now listen to me carefully
[50:03] that the anointing was separated you
[50:06] know Jesus said a man that will obey in
[50:08] my words and will keep my words he said
[50:11] I am the father will make ourselves
[50:14] known to him now that's not two gods and
[50:16] it's not an old man and a young man but
[50:18] it's actually the Father which is the
[50:21] spirit and the son which is the word so
[50:25] he said we will come to him now you
[50:28] notice what God did that God separated
[50:30] the word from the anointing if not then
[50:33] Satan would have been able to have the
[50:34] Bible and he would have access to all
[50:37] the power of God if the anointing and
[50:40] the word were all United in page four so
[50:43] God had the word written have the word
[50:45] spoken and then God separated the
[50:48] anointing and the anointing of the age
[50:51] would come on the word for the age and
[50:54] that's what makes it live and quickens
[50:56] it to the believer is that right so if
[50:59] not then every devil out of hell all
[51:01] that had to do is get themselves a Bible
[51:03] go to a Bible bookstore order one on
[51:06] Amazon and they would have everything
[51:08] they would need themselves so demons
[51:11] would be able to use the word of God so
[51:14] God separated the logos the word from
[51:16] the anointing and then in every age God
[51:19] would bring the anointing for that age
[51:21] and line it up with the word of that age
[51:24] and the Believers have that age become
[51:27] the word made manifest
[51:29] well I'm too smart but that makes a lot
[51:31] of sense to me in every age it's been
[51:34] exactly the same story and here we are
[51:37] in the Life stage and we know that God
[51:39] has certain scriptures that are ordained
[51:42] to be fulfilled and Moses could not
[51:44] fulfill them that's your spot in this
[51:46] hour that we're living so God always
[51:48] uses humans to fulfill his word now well
[51:52] again the prophet when he brings this he
[51:54] goes down through different
[51:55] dispensations and this next one that he
[51:57] refers to is Joshua and Caleb now we
[52:01] know that these two men were great great
[52:03] men anointed under the ministry of Moses
[52:06] but yet God never allowed Moses to take
[52:08] them over but he's going to have Joshua
[52:11] yahshua which is Jehovah Savior and we
[52:14] know that Caleb was his side buddy as
[52:17] brother Adam called him now those of you
[52:19] that are familiar with the history of
[52:21] Caleb I actually love it because he was
[52:23] not actually a Hebrew but Caleb was the
[52:28] son of jafani which was a kennesite now
[52:32] the kennesites were of the tribal
[52:35] lineage of of not from the Jews not from
[52:39] the Hebrews at all but the genocides
[52:42] come from the opposite side over there
[52:45] which supposedly were unbelievers and
[52:48] infidels but yet God called this man
[52:51] Caleb I mean notice what the name Caleb
[52:53] means
[52:55] nobody
[52:56] oh my goodness
[52:57] dog
[53:01] dog
[53:03] aha
[53:04] so Caleb being a dog
[53:08] Gentile
[53:10] but once you notice that they did not
[53:13] make a special tribe for the converts of
[53:17] the Gentiles that would Embrace Judaism
[53:20] but the Bible tells us that God gave him
[53:24] Caleb an inheritance among the tribe of
[53:30] Judah not that he was born in the tribe
[53:33] of Judah well that's a good tribe to put
[53:35] a gentile into because Judah is praise
[53:39] and Buddy if anybody's going to praise
[53:41] the lord it's going to be us former
[53:43] Gentile dogs because we realize we're
[53:46] not deserving of his mercy and his grace
[53:49] now what's amazing is also that Ruth the
[53:52] moabitus merge into this same tribe and
[53:56] Rahab also merged into this same tribe
[53:59] so and he'll hear it it shouldn't be
[54:01] amazing to you then that out of that
[54:04] same tribe would come to lineage the
[54:06] human lineage of the Lord Jesus himself
[54:09] now you know the Lord Jesus would have
[54:11] never been allowed to even enter into
[54:14] the temple of God in the New Testament
[54:17] Jesus never preached in the temple he
[54:19] would have never been a allowed to go
[54:21] into there because he was not of what
[54:24] they thought was the right lineage Jesus
[54:27] only preached in synagogues never in the
[54:31] temple isn't that amazing here is God
[54:33] himself but they would have never
[54:35] allowed God himself into their Temple
[54:38] because he didn't match up to their idea
[54:41] oh my goodness
[54:43] but yet God chose Joshua and Caleb to
[54:47] fulfill a certain part of his word
[54:50] notice he said where Joshua had led them
[54:52] there now Jordan gets real low you can
[54:54] wait across almost anywhere around
[54:56] unless you hit a hole of water where
[54:58] it's pretty deep where all the little
[55:00] forwards and things right there all the
[55:02] banks where Jericho was at you can make
[55:04] way to cross him isn't much over ankle
[55:07] deep now notice this ankle deep just
[55:10] drive across it in a jeep drive across
[55:13] it walk across it but he led them there
[55:15] in the time of April when the flooded
[55:19] country was flooded for almost a mile
[55:21] isn't it amazing how God will pick the
[55:24] route for his children to Journey now
[55:27] God if he would have synchronized this
[55:29] in the certain time with nature they
[55:31] could have pretty much just walked
[55:33] across it I've been there at the Jordan
[55:34] not long ago myself and it's not that
[55:37] deep of a place still yet to this day
[55:39] but yet God synchronized it so they
[55:42] would not go according to nature but
[55:45] actually contrary to it that God
[55:47] supernaturally would have to intervene
[55:50] and make nature comply to him and said
[55:53] allowing his children to comply to
[55:56] Nature
[55:57] watch what he said Oh Glory I love this
[56:00] he says God said so call the people
[56:03] together testify it for them he said the
[56:05] third day you're passing over Jordan see
[56:07] how God lets things happen just to make
[56:10] people just to pull out his little crowd
[56:13] what did they do they Sanctified
[56:15] themselves and they got ready oh my
[56:18] think of what a time it must have been
[56:19] when they looked at Joshua and said and
[56:21] you're the pastor of this church well
[56:23] I'll tell you one thing you sure don't
[56:25] know too much about whether you sure
[56:27] don't do much about leading God's people
[56:29] it's the very worst time of the year the
[56:31] River Jordan is a mile why when they
[56:33] would come down through there in the
[56:35] floods and the waddies so it all empty
[56:36] down and the melting of the snow from
[56:38] Mount Hermon and it would empty out and
[56:41] all this and you're looking out there
[56:42] and it's a mile wide and you chose you
[56:45] say you're a man of God you say you're a
[56:48] man that's called of God to leave these
[56:50] people boy where do you get your weather
[56:51] from where are you getting your report
[56:54] it looks like to me we've got a poor
[56:56] excuse for a leader sometimes God will
[56:59] leave his leaders in ways that's
[57:01] absolutely contrary to their own human
[57:04] perception God will lead them to preach
[57:07] things and do things and even take the
[57:09] church in a direction that they are
[57:11] battling within themselves to even do it
[57:14] but they feel the impulse of the Holy
[57:17] Ghost and they're afraid to disobey that
[57:20] you know God don't always make it known
[57:22] to the leaders but yet they feel that
[57:25] leading of the Holy Spirit and they will
[57:27] look back and say man I'll tell you I'll
[57:29] sweating bullets on that move I will
[57:31] sweat and bonus but it turned out to be
[57:33] the spirit of God why will God do that
[57:36] because he wants every leader to know
[57:38] it's him leading the way it ain't me it
[57:42] ain't him it ain't these other brothers
[57:43] God wants men that can be led all the
[57:47] Holy Ghost
[57:51] notice he said no matter how close you
[57:53] are to George no matter what your
[57:54] circumstances is if you could only hold
[57:57] that promise of God in your heart God
[57:59] will prove it that it's so in the midst
[58:02] of unbelief he will still prove that it
[58:06] is so I only know exactly do that and of
[58:08] course Caleb being this Gentile dog the
[58:11] Kendall's eye or the son of jafani when
[58:13] he come down when they start in the
[58:15] north part of the country and then they
[58:16] started driving the land out they were
[58:18] moving North toward Eastward and
[58:19] Westward and whenever they did they
[58:21] drove out the Giants but by the time
[58:24] they come back and they say the Book of
[58:26] Joshua is written in about a 27 year
[58:28] span some of the time they come around
[58:30] from the doors and come back down into
[58:32] the valley and he's fixing to receive
[58:35] his inheritance guess what happened the
[58:37] Giants that they drove out had moved
[58:40] back in now here they've got to take
[58:42] that mountain again our Acadia has added
[58:44] 40 years to his age he's added all kinds
[58:48] of scars all types of battles and now
[58:50] he's got to come but he said I'm just as
[58:53] able today as I was 40 years ago when
[58:56] God's Prophet came in this mountain and
[58:58] what was Caleb's identity well I'm about
[59:01] ready to go on Social Security I got my
[59:04] AARP card I guess I'll just kind of slow
[59:07] down and I'll let you young guys take it
[59:10] oh I can hear it down through there my
[59:12] goodness it said May camp and the
[59:14] whities and then sat down I can hear
[59:16] this sound going on
[59:20] people saying what in the world oh don't
[59:23] worry about it it's Uncle Caleb he's
[59:25] just over a sharpening his sword you'll
[59:28] imagine he had a sword about that long
[59:30] 40 years prior to that and when he come
[59:32] back down it's about this wrong but but
[59:34] it was sharp
[59:37] why because God was going to prove his
[59:41] word through Caleb I wonder are there
[59:45] any calebs here today that'll say Lord
[59:48] God prove your words to me
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:56] oh my
[59:58] if you won't get weak now in faith
[1:00:02] notice God proved his word to job as we
[1:00:06] looked at it last night God told the
[1:00:07] devil for the trial ever began I got a
[1:00:10] man that will love me I've got a man
[1:00:12] that will serve his fight of everything
[1:00:14] that you do it took only about a year
[1:00:16] they say the Book of Job covers a span
[1:00:19] of about a year it took a lot of Trials
[1:00:21] it took a lot of tests but the word of
[1:00:23] God was proved exactly by Joe how many
[1:00:26] wants to be that kind of believer today
[1:00:29] foreign
[1:00:33] oh God likes
[1:00:36] to prove himself
[1:00:39] be God
[1:00:42] how many wants a testimony and serving
[1:00:44] the lord
[1:00:46] let's dissect that word
[1:00:48] t e s t
[1:00:53] i m o n y test I'm only
[1:01:00] and groanie and complaining
[1:01:04] isn't it amazing we want a tremendous
[1:01:06] testimony but we don't really want tests
[1:01:12] praise the Lord
[1:01:14] oh would it be nice if God would have
[1:01:15] just emailed you some tremendous
[1:01:17] testimony God would have watched
[1:01:19] aptitude and there you go and there it
[1:01:21] is just laid it out oh he said why order
[1:01:23] God that is that is great I mean that is
[1:01:26] great and God said how many wants to
[1:01:28] testimony oh my all y'all's hands went
[1:01:29] up hey man what's the test
[1:01:33] either
[1:01:44] Judges chapter 16 verse 2.
[1:01:47] and was told to the gays out saying
[1:01:49] Samson has come hither
[1:01:51] and they can pass him in and laid wait
[1:01:54] for him all night in the gate of the
[1:01:56] city
[1:01:56] and were quite all the Naz saying in the
[1:01:58] morning when it is gay we shall kill him
[1:02:02] and Samson lay till midnight and arose
[1:02:05] at mad hiding took the doors of the Gate
[1:02:09] of the city
[1:02:10] and the two posts and went away with
[1:02:13] them bar and all
[1:02:16] and put them upon his shoulders
[1:02:19] and carried them up to the top of the
[1:02:22] hill
[1:02:23] that is before Hebron
[1:02:25] carried them up to the top of the hill
[1:02:27] that is before Hebron
[1:02:31] which is 20 miles
[1:02:34] away
[1:02:37] I don't mind telling you I'm not sure
[1:02:39] I'm man enough to pack a door that size
[1:02:42] 20 miles
[1:02:43] laughs
[1:02:49] much less doors like this I don't think
[1:02:52] you know it or not but these Gates and
[1:02:55] the ancient times were called the gates
[1:02:59] of hell
[1:03:03] don't you understand what God was doing
[1:03:06] God was not only going to do a great
[1:03:08] thing through Samson but Samson was
[1:03:11] prophesying
[1:03:13] of one day a mighty conqueror would come
[1:03:15] to the Earth and he would take the Gates
[1:03:18] of Hell Hallelujah
[1:03:20] he would take the gates of hell and rip
[1:03:23] them up oh aren't you glad we're sitting
[1:03:26] here today serving a mighty conquer who
[1:03:29] took the gates of hell and when he
[1:03:32] raised up he said I am he that was dead
[1:03:35] but I Am Alive forevermore Hallelujah
[1:03:39] and I have got the key of death and hell
[1:03:42] and the grave I want to let you know the
[1:03:45] day the devil don't even have the keys
[1:03:47] to his own house
[1:03:50] amen the Lord Jesus has conquered him
[1:03:54] and he's still doing it now if he can
[1:03:58] find somebody in vessel Tabernacle that
[1:04:02] he can use
[1:04:03] to prove his word
[1:04:07] foreign
[1:04:09] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:04:13] Jesus
[1:04:14] some Bible scholars say that the city
[1:04:17] Gates and the posts of Gaza
[1:04:19] which he tore down
[1:04:21] computed to be listen this between 10
[1:04:26] to 20
[1:04:29] 000.
[1:04:29] pounds
[1:04:37] they'll get a Hercules symbol now in
[1:04:39] your mind
[1:04:40] don't look this brother back here and
[1:04:42] say wow man that must be a big guy I
[1:04:45] know it's a liberty old guy about four
[1:04:47] foot
[1:04:47] that's what the prophet said Samson was
[1:04:49] about four foot little curly-headed
[1:04:52] shrimp little mama's boy
[1:04:55] oh my goodness
[1:04:57] but God had a word to prove
[1:05:00] Oh Glory to God God had a word to prove
[1:05:05] the angel of the Lord of Manoa and his
[1:05:08] wife whenever the Lord began to say
[1:05:10] about him don't you drink no wine don't
[1:05:12] you do this don't you that's speaking to
[1:05:14] his wife because I'm going to bring
[1:05:16] forth a son that was a word from God
[1:05:19] well he said if I only have that word
[1:05:21] let me tell you one thing every one of
[1:05:23] you predestinated seeds sitting here
[1:05:25] today on a spoken word from God God
[1:05:28] thought of you God spoke you as a matter
[1:05:31] of fact the prophet of God said God
[1:05:33] called your name in his first things
[1:05:36] before the foundation of the world there
[1:05:39] ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't
[1:05:41] enough tribulation there ain't enough
[1:05:43] sorrow to stop you from serving God
[1:05:46] because you are the spoken word
[1:05:51] thank you
[1:05:57] so Samson takes off of this 10 to 20 000
[1:06:00] I mean give or take a thousand what
[1:06:02] difference does it make that make her
[1:06:04] when you're talking about this kind of
[1:06:05] weight
[1:06:07] 20 miles
[1:06:09] and Hebron is an elevation of 3 200 feet
[1:06:12] higher than where he was so he's
[1:06:15] carrying it uphill all the way
[1:06:18] foreign
[1:06:19] Christians are downhill Christians
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:28] but this is real Christianity
[1:06:36] uphill all the way
[1:06:39] [Laughter]
[1:06:42] but I'm crying higher I'm going higher
[1:06:47] with the gates of Gaza I'm on my way
[1:06:54] oh look out devil I say look out Devil
[1:06:59] by the grace of God and the power of God
[1:07:03] I'm on my way
[1:07:11] these Gates were 10 feet tall
[1:07:15] 10 feet wide
[1:07:20] this was the chief City
[1:07:23] of the godzites
[1:07:27] though don't pick a little village
[1:07:29] somewhere tackle the whole thing
[1:07:33] one man
[1:07:34] against thousands
[1:07:36] I mean I know they are it still wasn't
[1:07:38] fair
[1:07:40] I mean against them
[1:07:46] Oh Glory to God if you and I could only
[1:07:49] see who we are today and you look around
[1:07:51] on those who are saying oh Lord I'm
[1:07:53] outnumbered no you're not there's more
[1:07:56] with us than there are with them
[1:07:58] Hallelujah
[1:08:00] the odds are definitely against hell the
[1:08:03] odds are definite against the devil your
[1:08:06] destiny has already been determined you
[1:08:08] are going to make it
[1:08:10] [Applause]
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:16] laughs
[1:08:17] not assist an identification of Christ
[1:08:19] the prophet said a prophet he was but he
[1:08:21] was more than a prophet he was a prophet
[1:08:23] plus talking about Jesus he said they
[1:08:25] had many prophets all prophets died at
[1:08:27] the Gate of death
[1:08:28] but this man took the keys death Hell In
[1:08:31] The Grave like Samson
[1:08:33] did the gates of Gotham he took it out
[1:08:36] and he took the sting out of death
[1:08:39] itself and swallowed up in Victory
[1:08:44] now listen to this and watch him break
[1:08:46] now from him to you makes his Believers
[1:08:49] more than conquerors it's already
[1:08:51] conquered there's nothing left to do but
[1:08:54] walk straight in with the Victor song
[1:08:56] and our hearts he is the triumphant one
[1:08:59] and this great one was more than a
[1:09:01] prophet
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] oh
[1:09:07] he loves to prove his word
[1:09:10] remember in first Samuel chapter 17
[1:09:12] verse 4.
[1:09:14] Little David
[1:09:17] and I want out
[1:09:19] a champion
[1:09:21] ooh
[1:09:23] there went out a champion
[1:09:26] out of the camp of the Philistines named
[1:09:30] Goliath
[1:09:31] of gas
[1:09:33] and the word Goliath means
[1:09:35] splendor
[1:09:39] well that's what Satan must have put in
[1:09:41] front of your past this strong enemy and
[1:09:45] you're just a little weakling sort of a
[1:09:47] guy if he can switch You by strategy to
[1:09:51] make you think you are powerless and the
[1:09:52] prophet said Satan has won one only one
[1:09:56] he has one weapon that is to make you
[1:10:00] doubt your weapon
[1:10:04] you don't have power it's not that he
[1:10:06] has power to be able to do this and that
[1:10:08] and the other gives you no it is simply
[1:10:11] manipulation if he can get you we know
[1:10:15] what propaganda is it's being used
[1:10:17] around the world why do you think that
[1:10:18] Putin has been so used in the nuclear
[1:10:21] word and then we use the nuclear word
[1:10:23] and then this one what is a lot of it
[1:10:25] it's nothing but brandishing their sower
[1:10:27] I've got news for Mr Putin he may have
[1:10:31] every intention of blowing us off the
[1:10:33] map but it's not him that's in control
[1:10:35] of our destiny I've got news for Russia

[1:10:58] afraid of Putin I ain't afraid of Russia
[1:11:00] I ain't even afraid of gas
[1:11:04] Hallelujah
[1:11:10] Russia has built themself a super
[1:11:13] stealth bomber faster more invisible
[1:11:16] than our f-35s our f-22s and they named
[1:11:21] it
[1:11:22] the messenger
[1:11:28] the messenger
[1:11:30] they've got their missiles with Warheads
[1:11:33] on them
[1:11:34] that can travel a Hypersonic speeds we
[1:11:38] don't even have one yet as a matter of
[1:11:40] fact the last one we tried a couple of
[1:11:41] months ago fizzled out in the water
[1:11:45] brother John don't that scare you not in
[1:11:47] the least
[1:11:51] I know some of y'all think I'm crazy I'm
[1:11:52] gonna go ahead and confirm it for you
[1:11:54] today I am I'm absolutely out of my mind
[1:11:57] and I am so glad that I'm out of my mind
[1:12:00] I just wish some of you would join me
[1:12:02] and get out of yours amen no tell it
[1:12:05] what the Lord could do right here for us
[1:12:07] this morning if we lay aside our fear
[1:12:10] lay aside all the scare of the world and
[1:12:13] say Lord God you're still the almighty
[1:12:15] you're still the all-powerful
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:21] ah
[1:12:23] so here comes the champion
[1:12:25] boom boom boom
[1:12:28] boom
[1:12:30] you imagine I'm classic good Lord
[1:12:36] have you ever seen such a tall boss and
[1:12:37] a man in your life
[1:12:47] six cubits and a span
[1:12:50] which would equal equal
[1:12:52] nine feet and nine inches tall
[1:12:58] nine feet
[1:13:00] and nine inches that's taller than your
[1:13:02] ceiling
[1:13:04] laughs
[1:13:06] and he had a helmet of brass upon his
[1:13:08] head
[1:13:09] it was hard mother called a male
[1:13:12] and the weight of the coat was five
[1:13:14] thousand shekels of brass
[1:13:17] so his helmet weighed 30 pounds
[1:13:20] so can you imagine a helmet weighing 30
[1:13:22] pounds well as puny as I am I just
[1:13:31] notice in verse six
[1:13:33] and he had Graves of brass
[1:13:36] upon his legs and a target of brass
[1:13:40] the 20 shoulders
[1:13:42] it's only wore the bronze helmet and a
[1:13:45] coat of scale armor
[1:13:47] weighing 5 000 shekels that would have
[1:13:50] been 125 pounds
[1:13:53] just for that
[1:13:57] and he has a long spear which had a
[1:13:59] bronze Shadow which had a 15 pound iron
[1:14:03] tip
[1:14:04] and all his armor would have weighed in
[1:14:07] the neighborhood of 200 pounds
[1:14:10] that's more my way
[1:14:12] imagine this old boy getting up of the
[1:14:14] morning he said
[1:14:18] he's probably so cantankerous it's going
[1:14:20] to contrary he couldn't get along the
[1:14:21] devil putting all that stuff on that hot
[1:14:23] weather down there hotter in South
[1:14:25] Carolina Lord have mercy
[1:14:29] you imagine he felt like a cooked
[1:14:30] lobster inside that thing sometime that
[1:14:33] old hot metal and that sunshine on top
[1:14:35] of it that certainly didn't add to his
[1:14:37] attitude didn't it I'm afraid that's the
[1:14:39] way we are sometimes they're so affected
[1:14:41] by the things around us you know why we
[1:14:43] spend too much time on Facebook we spend
[1:14:45] too much time on Instagram I think we'll
[1:14:48] be better off if we kept our face in his
[1:14:50] book well Hallelujah instead of Facebook
[1:14:53] I'm keeping a bunch of Gossip going all
[1:14:55] the time let's feed on the unfailing
[1:14:58] body word of the son of man so our
[1:15:01] bodies can be ready to be changed
[1:15:04] foreign
[1:15:07] the spear the staff of his spear was
[1:15:10] like a Weaver's beam
[1:15:12] and his spearhead weighed 600 shekels of
[1:15:15] iron
[1:15:16] I love the way brother random describes
[1:15:18] this a great big giant like that walking
[1:15:19] with a Weaver's needle which is claimed
[1:15:22] to be around 20 feet
[1:15:24] he could stand from right here just pick
[1:15:26] you all off like flies
[1:15:31] you could hear me close to him
[1:15:36] well you think the devil don't like to
[1:15:38] do that to you
[1:15:39] when you go to the doctor and you get a
[1:15:41] little pain and that doctor will pull a
[1:15:43] scan up and say oh my goodness sir I
[1:15:45] hate to tell you
[1:15:46] but you've got a tumor you've got this
[1:15:48] that now then Satan wants you to look at
[1:15:50] that instead of look at your promise
[1:15:52] oh yeah get your eyes on that pain Jaws
[1:15:55] on this and that and the other when
[1:15:56] doctors themselves will tell you Erica's
[1:15:58] doctor told her over and over again keep
[1:16:01] the right attitude keep the right
[1:16:03] attitude the prophet of God by saying
[1:16:05] this years and years ago before the the
[1:16:08] psychologists of this day ever broke
[1:16:10] into it saying that whenever people say
[1:16:12] they've got cancer he said for a great
[1:16:13] percentage of them right then they're
[1:16:15] already dead but he said if you believe
[1:16:17] God and if you had cancer you wouldn't
[1:16:20] be in too bad of a shape if you'd
[1:16:22] believe his word can you imagine a
[1:16:24] doctor telling you that why because the
[1:16:27] words that you feed on the articles that
[1:16:29] you read oh everybody's got Dr Google on
[1:16:32] their computer anymore or on their phone
[1:16:34] anymore we ought to consult Dr God
[1:16:37] instead of Dr Google
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:42] all right
[1:16:46] he had a 20-foot spear in his hand a man
[1:16:49] like that could stand there and pick up
[1:16:51] a dozen men and throws him light
[1:16:58] he stood there and cried into the armies
[1:17:00] of Israel
[1:17:02] Samuel goes on to say
[1:17:04] and said unto them why are you come out
[1:17:06] to set your battle in a ray am not eye
[1:17:09] Philistine and you Servants of Saul
[1:17:13] choose you a man
[1:17:16] let him come down and fight me
[1:17:19] a non-armored Goliath
[1:17:23] would wait in the proximity
[1:17:25] of 760 pounds that's a good sized cow
[1:17:31] [Laughter]
[1:17:34] you imagine a man standing there
[1:17:37] 760 pounds
[1:17:39] add in the weight of his armor that
[1:17:42] would have made him around 885 pounds
[1:17:46] with his shield and his Spirit which is
[1:17:49] not tilted up in the 125 that would put
[1:17:52] him right at a thousand
[1:17:56] and you little tiny shrimp
[1:18:00] you're gonna go out there and meet that
[1:18:02] man
[1:18:03] he had made that challenge day after day
[1:18:06] after day but one day that challenge
[1:18:08] fell across the ears of the wrong guy
[1:18:12] I guess depends on how you look at it
[1:18:14] he's either the wrong guy or the right
[1:18:15] guy sometimes the right guy is the wrong
[1:18:18] guy sometimes the wrong guy is the right
[1:18:19] guy
[1:18:20] ain't that right
[1:18:23] this little guy heard it he said what
[1:18:26] what
[1:18:27] you mean to tell me that I'm watching a
[1:18:30] little holy little
[1:18:32] all wired up you know just glory to God
[1:18:35] hallelujah
[1:18:44] took his staff in his hand
[1:18:46] and chose him five smooth stones
[1:18:50] I stood in this Valley of elah
[1:18:53] a couple years ago
[1:18:57] quite an awesome feeling too just being
[1:18:59] there
[1:19:00] you look over to your right which is
[1:19:03] where the people God were over to your
[1:19:05] left in a hard place
[1:19:07] where these folks were right down in the
[1:19:10] valley
[1:19:11] was to try a creek bed
[1:19:13] parts of it was about this deep I got
[1:19:15] down the bottom of some of the other
[1:19:16] Saints walking around through there
[1:19:18] what's he looking for of course five
[1:19:20] smooth stones
[1:19:23] I know that I was going to preach us I
[1:19:24] brought one of them with me too it
[1:19:26] always has more emphasis when you pull
[1:19:28] that rock out from the valley of Elo
[1:19:30] laughs I saw what an honor what an honor
[1:19:35] to stand down here and walk and then I
[1:19:37] thought well glory to God here's another
[1:19:39] little David down here with the other
[1:19:40] little David was don't you want to have
[1:19:43] that kind of reputation where you can
[1:19:45] say glory to God I am a giant slayer I
[1:19:49] am a Cancer conqueror I am a pornography
[1:19:52] conqueror I am a lost conqueror I am a
[1:19:56] layer to see and Conquer look I'm devil
[1:19:58] here we come in the name of Jesus
[1:20:00] because God will fulfill his word in our
[1:20:05] lives
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:15] so he chose him five smooth stones out
[1:20:18] of the brook and put them in a
[1:20:20] shepherd's bag which he had
[1:20:22] even in a script
[1:20:25] and his slang was in his hand
[1:20:28] and he drew near to the philistine
[1:20:31] David was willing only to fight with the
[1:20:34] weapons that he knew
[1:20:37] glory to God
[1:20:39] she ever notice I'm sure you have that
[1:20:41] whenever David got called before Saul
[1:20:44] and Dr Saul of course wanted to give him
[1:20:46] adulterous to Grant a pH Digger green
[1:20:48] all that sort of thing and Davidson I
[1:20:49] ain't never used such thing but once you
[1:20:51] notice what David done David began to
[1:20:54] testify of previous victories that God
[1:20:58] had done for him why because testifying
[1:21:01] about it now I know it may seem strange
[1:21:03] to you but the prophet said whenever you
[1:21:04] take all of his word he said take that
[1:21:06] word and start saying it over and over
[1:21:09] and over again until you believe it
[1:21:13] wow you mean sometimes we don't let's
[1:21:15] just be honest and face the facts
[1:21:17] sometimes we'll start quoting the word
[1:21:19] and we really don't believe it yet but
[1:21:21] the key is for you to be able to hear
[1:21:24] yourself say it
[1:21:26] and you say it I am healed I am healed I
[1:21:29] am healed I am delivered I am an
[1:21:32] overcomer I am going to put this devil
[1:21:34] under my feet why there's something
[1:21:36] about you hearing yourself quote God's
[1:21:40] word
[1:21:42] [Applause]
[1:21:43] I've got an app on my phone
[1:21:46] where I can take affirmations of God's
[1:21:48] scriptures
[1:21:49] and record them in my own voice Donnie
[1:21:53] you're more than a conqueror Donnie
[1:21:56] you're going in the Rapture the
[1:21:58] Millennium is for me heaven is mine and
[1:22:00] then I can play them over and over again
[1:22:02] it's good to hear the preacher say it
[1:22:04] but there's a lot of power when you hear
[1:22:06] yourself say it
[1:22:16] so here comes this guy boom boom
[1:22:20] sweating worse than I am if you can
[1:22:21] imagine that
[1:22:23] this guy feels like he's toasting a
[1:22:25] microwave man he's burning a peace War
[1:22:28] out he's contagious he's mad he didn't
[1:22:31] get his coffee he didn't get his toast
[1:22:33] and jelly for breakfast that morning and
[1:22:35] here he comes I say you gotta begin
[1:22:38] you mean I got out of bed
[1:22:46] I bet he may look at you the same way
[1:22:48] sometimes
[1:22:50] but he'll look at you different
[1:22:53] when you take his sword
[1:22:56] and remove his hit
[1:23:03] oh Hallelujah
[1:23:09] and the Philistine came on and Drew near
[1:23:12] unto David and the man that bear the she
[1:23:14] who went before him and the Philistine
[1:23:16] looked about and saw David
[1:23:19] he disdained him
[1:23:22] look at the meaning of the word to
[1:23:24] despise
[1:23:25] holding contempt to be despicable to be
[1:23:30] vile and worthless isn't that what he
[1:23:34] tries to do to us
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:41] for he was but of use
[1:23:43] and ready
[1:23:45] which means he was cute
[1:23:48] oh boy this really adds to the thing of
[1:23:51] the of a great a giant killer don't it
[1:23:55] I mean he ain't got no scars yet he
[1:23:57] comes out that this ready which was red
[1:23:59] kind of a complexion of red looking
[1:24:01] complexion and it must have been an odd
[1:24:03] Israel I could begin with and now Yuri

[1:24:07] over him nothing anywhere but he
[1:24:08] couldn't even hard to stand still Glory

[1:24:11] somebody tell me somebody put me in that
[1:24:14] direction his brother sent you ought to
[1:24:16] be ashamed of yourself David you're just
[1:24:18] being a little smart at it no he was
[1:24:21] anointed he couldn't help it it wasn't
[1:24:23] David that wanted to do this they oh
[1:24:26] Lord God brother Jason David walked
[1:24:28] right into the anointing it was a giant
[1:24:32] slaying anointing David couldn't help it
[1:24:35] you have walked into the anointing of
[1:24:38] this hour we can't do it on her own but
[1:24:42] we can't turn back we've walked right
[1:24:44] into our anointing
[1:24:46] [Applause]
[1:24:48] oh Lord
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:56] never remember David
[1:25:03] a teenager
[1:25:08] what's verse 43
[1:25:10] and the Philistine said unto David
[1:25:13] am I a dog
[1:25:16] David could have said you said it
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:23] that thou comest to me
[1:25:26] with staves
[1:25:28] and a Philistine curse David
[1:25:31] by his gods
[1:25:35] and the Philistines say to David come to
[1:25:37] me and I will give thy flesh unto the
[1:25:40] fowls of the air to the beasts of the
[1:25:41] field
[1:25:42] then said David
[1:25:45] to the Philistine thou cometh to me with
[1:25:47] a sword
[1:25:48] and with a spear with a shield but I am
[1:25:51] come to thee
[1:25:53] in the name
[1:25:54] of the Lord of hosts
[1:25:58] the god of the armies of Israel you see
[1:26:01] David was not a trinitarian
[1:26:05] he didn't come in the name of Gods
[1:26:09] I come to thee in the name of this human
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:14] that's him
[1:26:15] which is the ineffable
[1:26:18] the ineffable
[1:26:21] it's so great you can't even pronounce
[1:26:24] it it's so Majestic he didn't mention
[1:26:27] his sign he didn't mention any Stones
[1:26:29] amen what do you mention the name the
[1:26:33] name the Shem the Shem I come to you in
[1:26:38] the ineffable name because in that
[1:26:40] ineffable name is everything I need
[1:26:44] at the name of Jesus every knee shall
[1:26:47] bow every tongue shall confess every
[1:26:49] disease every sickness ever trauma it
[1:26:52] can be subject to the name of Jesus
[1:26:54] Christ
[1:27:00] what goliath expected from his arms
[1:27:04] and his equipment
[1:27:05] they've been expected more so
[1:27:07] from the ineffable name
[1:27:10] it was so great he couldn't even
[1:27:11] pronounce it but he said all I know is
[1:27:14] there's such power in it all I've got to
[1:27:16] do is offer utter the synonym you know
[1:27:19] they consider the name of God so sacred
[1:27:20] you look on many Jewish websites even to
[1:27:22] this very day and they will put G leave
[1:27:25] out the Z of the O and put d g d because
[1:27:28] they think it's too great to pronounce
[1:27:29] it and David said I don't come to you
[1:27:31] with a lot of Education I don't come to
[1:27:34] you with a lot of experience but I come
[1:27:36] to you in the name in the name of the
[1:27:38] god of the armies of Israel
[1:27:42] you said as a matter of fact it's a
[1:27:43] great I can't even express it well you
[1:27:46] know this must have just added to the
[1:27:47] lunacy of what goliath saw this poor
[1:27:51] little kid
[1:27:52] they went over to the insane place and
[1:27:54] they picked up this guy and now he's so
[1:27:56] great he came to tell me the name of his
[1:27:57] God
[1:27:59] let me look at him he's just a little
[1:28:01] old sunburned looking guy but maybe
[1:28:02] freckles all over his face ain't never
[1:28:04] been in a battle in his life oh well
[1:28:06] that's yet to be seen in it he didn't
[1:28:09] know about the lion he didn't know about
[1:28:11] the bear
[1:28:15] laughs
[1:28:17] notice what David said
[1:28:19] this day
[1:28:21] with the Lord capital L capital O
[1:28:24] capital r capital D
[1:28:28] will the Lord deliver them I'm sure
[1:28:31] you've looked at it before but it did it
[1:28:32] quite amazing whenever the spies go down
[1:28:34] the land of Jericho
[1:28:36] and they go to Talking
[1:28:38] to Rahab the Harlot
[1:28:40] and Ray had the heart it begins to
[1:28:41] mention the secret name of God
[1:28:45] and she said we know we know that the
[1:28:50] Lord not capital L little o little r
[1:28:53] Little D that was a word used among the
[1:28:56] ammonites the amorites the hypnites all
[1:28:58] the jebusites but how did she know this
[1:29:02] name which only Abraham and his seat
[1:29:04] knew
[1:29:12] Barb will deliver them to my hand and I
[1:29:15] will smite thee
[1:29:21] now you imagine by now it's about 110 in
[1:29:23] the shade
[1:29:25] and this guy feels like a cooked onion
[1:29:27] and a microwave and he's all day one day
[1:29:29] I am getting sick and tired of your
[1:29:31] mouth
[1:29:32] I'm fixing to wipe you out okay you hear
[1:29:37] me little boy little brat
[1:29:39] you're dead meat
[1:29:46] David said don't interrupt my sermon
[1:29:56] you I will take your hat from you and I
[1:30:00] will give the carcass of the host of the
[1:30:02] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[1:30:06] the air Lord have mercy how can a
[1:30:08] teenager make such a challenge how can a
[1:30:11] teenager say such a word so now he's
[1:30:13] moved Beyond Goliath himself is it just
[1:30:16] a matter of fact just to let you know
[1:30:17] I'm gonna kill the whole bunch of you
[1:30:20] [Applause]
[1:30:31] that's about the way you feel when the
[1:30:33] anointing gets on you
[1:30:36] that's the way I feel right now
[1:30:39] ask me how I feel about 30 minutes from
[1:30:41] now
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:45] don't you understand it'll be this an
[1:30:48] even greater
[1:30:50] that'll come over us one day
[1:30:52] the prophet called it a sweep
[1:30:55] he said you'll look and you'll see your
[1:30:57] loved ones and you know it won't be long
[1:30:59] and a sweep will come over you a sweep
[1:31:01] in that peculiar work to use for the
[1:31:03] body change but you see it's not
[1:31:05] peculiar to the bride because the Lord
[1:31:07] Jesus used that same Parable and won The
[1:31:09] Parables of the gospels whenever he said
[1:31:11] that the one of the bride and all of
[1:31:12] them speaking about Redemption of course
[1:31:13] in Luke 16 and whenever they dropped the
[1:31:16] coins and they lost this and that and
[1:31:17] how did that bride find those coins
[1:31:19] sweeping
[1:31:22] only the sweat will be swept away only
[1:31:25] the sweepers will be swept away why
[1:31:28] we're used to sweeping we're used to
[1:31:30] having our lives cleaned out by anointed
[1:31:32] mans of God are we we're Houston we get
[1:31:34] little dust in this corner a little
[1:31:36] something lost in that corner and God
[1:31:37] anoints these men and they drag out the
[1:31:40] room or they go to sweeping everything
[1:31:41] out of us and we so well glory to God
[1:31:43] the Rapture is the final phase of me
[1:31:45] being Swift and one of these days I'm
[1:31:48] going to be swept out of this world in a
[1:31:50] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:58] notice what David's going to do this
[1:32:04] I'll feed you all to the fowls of the
[1:32:06] air to the wild beast of the Earth
[1:32:09] no the Earth may know
[1:32:11] there is a God
[1:32:13] in Israel
[1:32:14] not that all the world may know I'm his
[1:32:16] great psalmist I'm this great person I'm
[1:32:18] this great preacher I'm this great
[1:32:20] lovely
[1:32:21] no
[1:32:23] he knew his purpose
[1:32:25] his purpose was to manifest the name of
[1:32:29] God
[1:32:32] his purpose was to fulfill God's word
[1:32:35] for that honor
[1:32:38] do you understand your purpose brother
[1:32:41] sister
[1:32:43] and all disassembly shall know that the
[1:32:47] Lord save us not with the sword in the
[1:32:49] spear
[1:32:50] for the battle is the Lord's
[1:32:55] and he will give you into our hands
[1:33:00] and it came to pass when the Philistine
[1:33:03] arose
[1:33:04] and came and Drew not to meet David
[1:33:08] that David realized he'd made a terrible
[1:33:10] mistake and took off running the other
[1:33:12] way
[1:33:15] and David hasted and ran toward the Army
[1:33:20] Lord have mercy
[1:33:26] you see the longer you take and the
[1:33:28] slower you look the bigger them
[1:33:30] circumstances become sometimes you're
[1:33:32] better offices
[1:33:35] look out devil look out devil God I
[1:33:37] command the end of this thing to your
[1:33:39] hair look out devil here I come but we
[1:33:41] think
[1:33:42] oh goodness
[1:33:43] let me get my range finder scope out
[1:33:46] here now
[1:33:47] good Lord
[1:33:50] according to that of the ballistics and
[1:33:52] the wind
[1:33:53] there ain't no way in the world that
[1:33:55] swings I'll ever take that guy down
[1:34:00] but he had stepped into an anointing
[1:34:02] he couldn't understand
[1:34:04] why that word was hanging in the valley
[1:34:06] of elah and it had David's name wrote
[1:34:09] all over it
[1:34:13] you imagine his brother said good Lord
[1:34:17] look at them my balls
[1:34:19] look at them eyelashes that guy didn't
[1:34:21] need a ceiling fan all they knew just
[1:34:22] bad his eyes
[1:34:24] his own personal built-in ceiling fan
[1:34:27] let's say Lord have mercy how in the
[1:34:31] world would you ever bring a man down
[1:34:32] like that and David look and say good
[1:34:34] God Almighty a Target that big how could
[1:34:37] you ever miss it
[1:34:39] hallelujah hallelujah I'm tired of this
[1:34:43] rockness the devil how is it you can't
[1:34:45] overcome it
[1:34:50] so David hasted
[1:34:53] and ran
[1:34:55] toward the army
[1:34:58] to meet the philistine
[1:35:04] all right Philistine here we come
[1:35:09] David put
[1:35:12] it in his bag
[1:35:16] I got a stone
[1:35:17] and slang it
[1:35:19] and smote the Philistine in his forehead
[1:35:23] that the stone
[1:35:25] sunk
[1:35:28] have you ever seen a Hypersonic Rock
[1:35:31] before
[1:35:41] I want you to notice how he fell
[1:35:44] and he fell
[1:35:46] upon his
[1:35:49] face
[1:35:52] God made him bow
[1:35:57] wow
[1:36:01] according to the power of this rock
[1:36:04] thing at a thousand miles
[1:36:09] faster than you can even imagine already
[1:36:13] tell you in a minute how fast it's going
[1:36:15] according to that velocity your brother
[1:36:18] said hunt know how it is according to
[1:36:20] when you're rifle hunting and you take
[1:36:21] that bullet according to the speed that
[1:36:23] comes out of the muscle and whenever it
[1:36:25] hits that animal it will just ah they
[1:36:28] don't go forwards
[1:36:30] the velocity knocks them back
[1:36:33] but God must have orchestrated where he
[1:36:36] tripped that big guy when the mains goes
[1:36:38] down or just kind of gotten away he said
[1:36:39] you ain't falling backwards you're
[1:36:41] bowing before my servant
[1:36:45] Hallelujah don't you fall backwards
[1:36:47] devil but I will
[1:36:51] devil
[1:36:57] [Applause]
[1:37:01] the prophet said he picked up these five
[1:37:03] songs well this great big boasting
[1:37:05] Infidel walking out there and cursed him
[1:37:07] in the name of his Idol cursed David
[1:37:09] while I said I'll take you on the end of
[1:37:11] my spear like a Weaver's needle longer
[1:37:14] than one of them middle tent poles but
[1:37:16] I've been preaching under a tent
[1:37:20] take it into this spear little old boy
[1:37:22] weighed about a hundred
[1:37:24] and 10 pounds
[1:37:28] meeting a man full body weight is about
[1:37:30] a thousand
[1:37:31] and the odd still is against Goliath
[1:37:35] yes your friends it's just all the way
[1:37:37] you perceive it
[1:37:39] it's the way we are looking at these
[1:37:41] things this is how Satan steals so much
[1:37:44] of our Victory he knows how to present
[1:37:46] it
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:52] kind of a scrawny
[1:37:55] drawed in little fella maybe didn't get
[1:37:59] too much to eat back on the back side of
[1:38:02] the desert
[1:38:03] so here he comes kind of ready kind of
[1:38:06] cute little fella
[1:38:09] coming out through there
[1:38:11] was an emotional sword of the God
[1:38:12] because he'd be back there alone with
[1:38:14] God get to plan his his harp and to go
[1:38:17] to shouting around and he's just really
[1:38:19] all caught up you know I know emotional
[1:38:20] people can be like that he just gets all
[1:38:22] caught up you know just kind of hyper
[1:38:23] like yeah you just go to church and just
[1:38:26] couldn't sit still all I can say is it's

[1:38:29] morning because the Deacon Brothers had
[1:38:31] died escorted him out here about 50
[1:38:33] times you imagine David sitting here
[1:38:35] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost can
[1:38:37] you imagine David said you're this
[1:38:39] morning saved by the blood of the Lord
[1:38:40] Jesus and forgiven David will scream at
[1:38:43] her service he'd shout every service
[1:38:45] he'd Marsh around the walls of Jericho
[1:38:47] there ain't even know Jericho he'd say
[1:38:49] Lord have mercy you mean you all got
[1:38:51] that Living God living in you you've got
[1:38:53] that in your soul all I had was the law
[1:38:56] but I loved him so much

[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:01] laughs

[1:43:25] what he was doing all the devils in hell
[1:43:27] this is a man not even born again this
[1:43:29] is the man not even filled with the Holy
[1:43:31] Ghost
[1:43:31] what about those of you today that are
[1:43:33] born of the spirit of God
[1:43:35] when the prophet said the weakest
[1:43:36] Christian praise and he causes them
[1:43:39] Devils to tremble don't you know why
[1:43:41] they don't want you to pray don't you
[1:43:43] know why they don't want you to believe
[1:43:44] who you are in Christ Jesus they strip
[1:43:46] you and I
[1:43:51] all the devil's in Hell couldn't wait
[1:43:54] across that little David
[1:43:57] just sitting there with his finger upon
[1:44:00] his nose nodding his head
[1:44:06] Little David just dancing in the spirit
[1:44:09] wow dancing before the Giant's dead
[1:44:17] Brother Don the doctors give me a bad
[1:44:18] reports they told me I better get my
[1:44:19] funeral ready better teleportation what
[1:44:22] I want him to say
[1:44:23] I take the other report I start looking
[1:44:26] online for a trip to Cancun Maybe
[1:44:32] don't make your plans to die make your
[1:44:35] plans to fight make your plans to live
[1:44:38] but we take the doctor's report is the
[1:44:40] absolute right here is your absolute the
[1:44:43] word of God
[1:44:44] [Applause]
[1:44:48] ah
[1:44:50] notice the prophet said what is it he
[1:44:52] had five stones
[1:44:54] five fingers wrapped this little string
[1:44:56] around Jesus here he comes oh brother
[1:44:58] look out Goliath you gotta fall
[1:45:01] when you set that loose the Holy Ghost
[1:45:04] got to hold to that little Stone and
[1:45:07] pick up a speed of about a thousand
[1:45:10] miles per second
[1:45:15] boy wouldn't Russia like to have that
[1:45:18] equation how to figure that one out
[1:45:21] when the Air Force in the U.S army like
[1:45:23] to figure out how in the world but they
[1:45:25] don't have access to holy ghost power
[1:45:27] but you do
[1:45:29] you do
[1:45:30] Oh Glory to God what brother Donnie what
[1:45:32] rock am I going to use the scriptures
[1:45:34] quotes of the message of the hour and it
[1:45:37] may be seem like so little when it
[1:45:39] leaves your mouth the key is the Holy
[1:45:42] Ghost takes it and flies it out that A
[1:45:44] Thousand Miles a second enslaves that
[1:45:47] devil
[1:45:51] so imagine here he goes something has
[1:45:54] always done
[1:45:55] David did not upgrade to a Hypersonic
[1:45:57] swing
[1:45:59] it's the same one he's always used with
[1:46:01] it
[1:46:03] for his same one
[1:46:05] he didn't need Hypersonic apparently
[1:46:07] with a bear in the lion but he did with
[1:46:09] this Johnny's got this 24 sphere so God
[1:46:12] says I'll keep you safe boy
[1:46:14] so the spirit of God
[1:46:17] oh
[1:46:18] only one spot
[1:46:21] right here
[1:46:22] everybody else was covered
[1:46:24] and the spirit of God you imagine David
[1:46:26] he was Fearless you imagine this recent
[1:46:29] thing now is that a northwest wind or is
[1:46:32] out of Southwest now you brothers that
[1:46:33] shoot a bow you know that you shoot that
[1:46:35] thing in at a certain thing and you
[1:46:37] heard a tree stand and you're 20 feet
[1:46:39] high oh my I had to come 25 feet high
[1:46:41] which means the angle that the the stir
[1:46:43] that the arrow will drop is just a
[1:46:45] little bit different and there's a West
[1:46:46] Wind moving at about 12 miles an hour oh
[1:46:49] my oh I'll have to allow for it David
[1:46:51] didn't have to allow he just took and
[1:46:53] said glory to God here it comes
[1:46:56] here it comes get ready for the shouting
[1:46:59] music because we're fixing to have a
[1:47:01] time oh you imagine Davis might send
[1:47:03] away don't you better calculate this
[1:47:05] what I'm calculating is my God is
[1:47:08] Almighty oh brother Donnie I'm
[1:47:10] calculating for the chemo I'm
[1:47:12] calculating for this and that and the
[1:47:13] other let's calculate that our God is a
[1:47:16] mighty God he ain't never been defeated
[1:47:18] he ain't never lost a child he has never
[1:47:21] lost a battle and he ain't gonna start
[1:47:23] now because he's got some children that
[1:47:27] need Deliverance they need healing they
[1:47:29] need peace
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:41] first Samuel 17 50 so David prevailed
[1:47:44] over the Philistine with a singing with
[1:47:46] a stone
[1:47:48] and smoke the Philistine and slowing but
[1:47:51] there was no sword
[1:47:52] in the hand
[1:47:54] of David
[1:47:56] therefore David ran
[1:47:59] stood upon the philistine
[1:48:05] oh how I'm waiting for the day when I
[1:48:08] can be able to send mother Jason I
[1:48:10] thought WhatsApp or a text or email
[1:48:12] maybe all three of them say brother
[1:48:14] Jason Erica as well
[1:48:18] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:48:22] but I'm going to go ahead and say today
[1:48:23] by his stripes she is already healed by
[1:48:28] his stripes you are already healed
[1:48:31] before you ever see the victory we can
[1:48:33] go ahead and rejoice and say praise God
[1:48:36] he is my healer
[1:48:40] [Applause]
[1:48:42] don't you understand why sometimes God
[1:48:45] will let people go to doctors you
[1:48:47] remember the miracle of Donnie Morton
[1:48:48] Donnie Morton was the little guy that
[1:48:50] had this crippling disease and his daddy
[1:48:52] was really really poor and he had to
[1:48:54] save his money to come and see brother
[1:48:55] Branham and he finds him in this certain
[1:48:57] city and he meets brother ran him out on
[1:48:58] the street and brother bam tells him
[1:49:00] little little brother he said now you
[1:49:01] won't believe it because you've had your
[1:49:03] little boy to all these different famous
[1:49:04] doctors but there's an old country
[1:49:06] doctor that'll perform a surgery on your
[1:49:08] boy but brother Brown they say it's
[1:49:10] impossible I know it'll seem like it's
[1:49:12] impossible but he said he'll perform
[1:49:13] that surgery and your boy will walk
[1:49:15] again
[1:49:16] isn't it amazing what did Brother
[1:49:18] Branham if the Lord had been a lead
[1:49:19] brother brought him to pray for him
[1:49:20] right there on the street and the
[1:49:22] Miracle have been performed ah but you
[1:49:24] see Readers Digest would have never
[1:49:25] published that
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:29] so God used his prophet and took the
[1:49:32] Dead the devil's own sword books
[1:49:35] education science
[1:49:38] [Laughter]
[1:49:42] the doctors have told brother Ron
[1:49:44] Spencer if and when you are healed it
[1:49:46] will be the one of the most Vindicated
[1:49:48] Miracles that's ever been known in
[1:49:50] history because they've got all these
[1:49:52] scans they've got all this proof he
[1:49:54] shouldn't even be alive today he
[1:49:56] shouldn't even be living you see
[1:49:57] sometimes God wants to take the devil's
[1:49:59] own sword and cut his own head off with
[1:50:02] it
[1:50:02] real faith is not scared to go back to
[1:50:05] the doctor and say let the doctor tell
[1:50:07] you you will that's right you can look
[1:50:09] at a scan well it was there but this one
[1:50:12] says it ain't time no more but your face
[1:50:14] looked at it when it said it was there
[1:50:16] and said it ain't there no more Oh Glory
[1:50:19] to God your body's just waiting waiting
[1:50:22] to catch up with your faith
[1:50:28] therefore David ran and stood upon the
[1:50:31] Philistine oh I love this just climb
[1:50:34] right up on them cigarettes
[1:50:38] take your foot and just squish it
[1:50:42] [Applause]
[1:50:43] climb right up on that addiction and say
[1:50:46] go to hell go back to hell where you
[1:50:49] come from and dance right on that
[1:50:52] Affliction dance right on that addiction
[1:50:56] [Applause]
[1:50:59] he drew out the sheath thereof
[1:51:02] and slew him
[1:51:06] that's already done killed him
[1:51:11] I'm sorry you had never noticed this but
[1:51:16] so the Bible says in verse 50 he slew
[1:51:20] him
[1:51:21] then it says in verse 51 he slew him
[1:51:24] again
[1:51:25] I saw the way I like to do devils Islam
[1:51:28] and then you swim and then you swim and
[1:51:30] you saw him
[1:51:31] [Laughter]
[1:51:36] and cut off his head there with him when
[1:51:38] the Philistines Saul
[1:51:41] their Champion was dead
[1:51:44] they fled
[1:51:47] what was it God
[1:51:49] prove him his word
[1:51:53] Sister Janet does he prove his word
[1:51:57] when our sister had cancer years ago
[1:52:00] and the Lord wanted somebody that could
[1:52:02] testify
[1:52:03] that the Lord God could heal cancer
[1:52:06] how many years been healed by the Lord
[1:52:08] in his Mercy
[1:52:12] how many has come through great tests
[1:52:13] and trials and you thought you'd never
[1:52:15] make it and somehow the Lord God brought
[1:52:17] you through everybody's Grace
[1:52:19] what was it you walked into that
[1:52:20] anointing Hallelujah of the hour and God
[1:52:23] anointed you for that trial I can't be
[1:52:25] brother Jason brother Jason can't be we
[1:52:27] want to find our place and be God's
[1:52:29] allocated so much of his word for each
[1:52:30] one of us that's not only in fulfillment
[1:52:33] of the glorious but dealing with those
[1:52:35] things which we really don't like to
[1:52:37] deal with
[1:52:38] God wants a preacher that can be laughed
[1:52:39] at ridiculed and made fun of how many
[1:52:42] preachers you see standing in line for
[1:52:43] that
[1:52:44] now if God said I don't want to preacher
[1:52:46] that'll empty out the hospitals boy most
[1:52:48] all the misfit Lord let it be me it's me
[1:52:50] God it's me
[1:52:53] but God says I want a preacher that can
[1:52:55] be ridiculed and run down and criticized
[1:52:56] and hated rejected talked about
[1:52:59] you don't see my hand going up do you
[1:53:01] God knew that so he pulled mine up
[1:53:09] somebody
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:29] God Needed Somebody
[1:53:32] that he could prove
[1:53:33] that the Lions couldn't meet him
[1:53:36] so he got to Daniel
[1:53:38] he needed three somebody's that he could
[1:53:40] prove
[1:53:41] his power was greater
[1:53:43] than a burning furnace
[1:53:46] wow
[1:53:47] they wasn't even sure God would bring
[1:53:49] them out were they they said we're not
[1:53:51] even sure if the Lord will do it or not
[1:53:52] but this one thing we know we will not
[1:53:55] bow to you that's one thing we know for
[1:53:58] sure you see sometimes we enter into the
[1:54:00] battle like David where we already see
[1:54:01] it this is done this is finished other
[1:54:04] times we enter into the battle like
[1:54:05] Shadrach meshacking a minute ago and we
[1:54:07] say Lord I'm not sure how this is going
[1:54:08] to go but this is one thing I do know I
[1:54:10] ain't giving up on you I ain't turning
[1:54:13] my back on you God has all these
[1:54:14] examples written in the word to show us
[1:54:16] that our life is so multi-layered our
[1:54:19] life as Christians our victories are one
[1:54:20] in so many Avenues why did God leave all
[1:54:22] these things in the Bible for our
[1:54:24] admonition and for examples for us to
[1:54:26] see there's times God reveals it to you
[1:54:28] when you're right here all hell is going
[1:54:30] to be in front of you you say I ain't
[1:54:31] got to worry in the world and there's
[1:54:33] other times God says follow me
[1:54:35] stay with me I'll lead you he don't show
[1:54:39] you the end but somehow you believe it's
[1:54:40] going to be good because you remember
[1:54:42] the scripture in the book of Jeremiah
[1:54:43] that said I know the thoughts that I
[1:54:45] think towards you and they are good and
[1:54:48] not evil
[1:54:53] Hallelujah
[1:54:55] Heavenly Father
[1:54:58] in the name of Jesus
[1:55:02] I pray you'd speak to every
[1:55:05] son or daughter today Lord
[1:55:08] maybe they're somewhere weary in the
[1:55:10] battle
[1:55:12] we're not sure they can make it another
[1:55:13] day
[1:55:15] their strength seems to be subsiding by
[1:55:18] the hour
[1:55:19] but Lord God made the god of David
[1:55:22] the god of Daniel
[1:55:25] Hallelujah
[1:55:27] the great Lord God Adonai
[1:55:31] may you come with strings
[1:55:34] many times father we Face things and we
[1:55:36] wasn't sure if we'd be able to make it
[1:55:38] or not
[1:55:39] but somehow you and your grace reached
[1:55:41] down and brought us through
[1:55:44] we thank you for the stories like David
[1:55:46] we love them
[1:55:48] we've all been serving you most of us
[1:55:50] probably long enough to know
[1:55:51] all of our battles don't come that way
[1:55:54] there's times it's more like some of
[1:55:57] these other ones in the scripture 25
[1:55:59] years of Abraham waiting on the promise
[1:56:01] of God
[1:56:02] waiting waiting waiting but he walked
[1:56:06] under an anointing when he was 75 years
[1:56:09] old
[1:56:10] when you said I make my Covenant with
[1:56:13] thee
[1:56:14] you never even asked him if he wanted it
[1:56:17] you just told him well that's the way
[1:56:20] you've done us before the world began
[1:56:23] or if we could catch a glimpse
[1:56:26] and the prophet said that our names are
[1:56:27] engraved and the palms of your hands
[1:56:31] Hallelujah
[1:56:33] and he said when you spoke your word
[1:56:35] Christ the logos into existence
[1:56:38] you spoke us into existence too
[1:56:42] because we are part of that original
[1:56:43] word
[1:56:45] oh Jesus would you pass this word today
[1:56:49] strengthen ever Deborah
[1:56:52] strengthen ever it Lazarus sisters
[1:56:55] as they're seeing their brother and his
[1:56:57] body there deteriorating
[1:57:00] and you showed up four days late
[1:57:03] strength and ever gerias when the little
[1:57:07] girl is dead
[1:57:09] strengthen every one of these people
[1:57:10] Lord may we be like the sorrow
[1:57:12] Phoenician woman
[1:57:15] whenever she come to you and you were so
[1:57:18] rude
[1:57:19] many of us if you treated us that way
[1:57:21] we'd turn away and never come back
[1:57:24] the disciples even besought you sent her
[1:57:27] a wish in our modern terms she is
[1:57:29] aggravating us
[1:57:32] you told a look woman I'm not even sent
[1:57:34] to you
[1:57:35] oh my we would have got our feelings
[1:57:37] hurt with and never come back we'd have
[1:57:39] found us another church
[1:57:41] but she had a need
[1:57:43] and her need was bigger than her
[1:57:46] feelings
[1:57:46] I wish we could learn that today
[1:57:51] then you finally said look I'm not sent
[1:57:54] to your race of people
[1:57:56] you're a bunch of dogs
[1:57:59] we know Lord this two words used there
[1:58:01] for the word dog
[1:58:04] one means a big dog
[1:58:06] and one means a little dog
[1:58:08] you use the word big dog
[1:58:11] I'm not sent to you because you're a big
[1:58:14] dog
[1:58:15] but she answered you back and said
[1:58:17] that's right Lord
[1:58:19] I'm a little dog
[1:58:22] the prophet of God said she had such
[1:58:24] face
[1:58:25] even you couldn't run her off
[1:58:30] Lord God many people in this message
[1:58:31] they leave because the preacher runs
[1:58:33] them all for the Deacon says something
[1:58:34] to their kids or this that and the other
[1:58:36] help us to have the kind of Faith
[1:58:38] thought this woman had
[1:58:39] that if Jesus himself meets Us in the
[1:58:41] way and said out of my way and we say
[1:58:43] you ain't leaving till you bless me
[1:58:46] maybe grab a hold of you because you're
[1:58:49] the same one that Jacob grabbed a hold
[1:58:52] of that day
[1:58:54] I ain't letting go till you change me
[1:58:56] I'm tired of being a deceiver I'm tired
[1:58:59] of being a trickster I'm tired of being
[1:59:01] half in and half out
[1:59:03] I ain't letting go till you change me
[1:59:07] Hallelujah
[1:59:09] he walked in there
[1:59:11] fully capable on his strength to walk in
[1:59:15] but he walked out a limping Prince
[1:59:18] glory to God and he called the name of
[1:59:21] that place pineal
[1:59:23] for there he said I have met God face to
[1:59:26] face
[1:59:27] no wonder this man later could make an
[1:59:29] altar and call the name of that altar
[1:59:32] hell hell he
[1:59:34] Israel
[1:59:37] he
[1:59:39] Israel How could a man be so emboldened
[1:59:43] who called an altar
[1:59:45] merged after his name with God's name
[1:59:50] but after he met God
[1:59:53] it gave him the right to worship the way
[1:59:56] he had never worshiped before so it said
[1:59:59] hell God hello he God
[2:00:02] God to God of Israel
[2:00:06] no longer just the god of Abraham and
[2:00:08] the god of Isaac but my God
[2:00:11] we've preached for years that you was
[2:00:13] brother Branham Scott you was Elijah's
[2:00:15] God you were Moses God but I believe the
[2:00:18] folks that leave this world in the
[2:00:19] Rapture aren't just going to preach of
[2:00:21] the god of Moses or the god of Elijah
[2:00:23] but they're going to say he's my God
[2:00:26] he's a my healer he's my resurrection
[2:00:30] he's my body changer he's my God too
[2:00:36] oh Jesus we bless your name father
[2:00:40] We Worship You Lord
[2:00:43] would you lay hands on each other for
[2:00:45] just a moment
[2:00:48] we're going to offer prayer I don't want
[2:00:50] you praying for yourself and how about I
[2:00:51] want you to pray for that person
[2:00:52] standing by you
[2:00:55] Hallelujah
[2:00:57] Lord we sense your anointing we sense
[2:00:59] faith
[2:01:00] Oh Glory to God
[2:01:02] father maybe some of them have tried and
[2:01:04] tried and they can't lay aside this
[2:01:06] besetting sin or that whatever it is in
[2:01:08] the name of Jesus May today be the place
[2:01:10] that they can drive down a stake maybe
[2:01:13] it's not so much a person on this
[2:01:14] assembly somebody that'll stream the
[2:01:15] service
[2:01:17] father we come before you now in the
[2:01:19] name
[2:01:19] the inevitable name the name that's
[2:01:22] above all names
[2:01:24] and it's not only your name
[2:01:26] but it's our name
[2:01:29] Hallelujah for we have taken on your
[2:01:32] name
[2:01:34] mistress Jesus Christ
[2:01:38] father God
[2:01:39] would you come by this way with healing
[2:01:41] in your wings would you come by with
[2:01:43] Deliverance Lord
