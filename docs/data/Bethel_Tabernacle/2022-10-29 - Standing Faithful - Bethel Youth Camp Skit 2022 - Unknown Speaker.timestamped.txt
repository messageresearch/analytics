[30:37] all right
[30:45] good morning
[30:49] sorry we're getting a late start we've
[30:51] had a lot of technical difficulties and
[30:54] I think it's because Satan doesn't want
[30:55] us to do this for you guys
[30:57] I'm very nervous and I don't even have
[31:00] any lines
[31:01] so just think how the other people must
[31:03] feel I decided I was going to give a
[31:06] little introduction because I made all
[31:08] these kids get up and do this and now
[31:10] I'm sorry
[31:11] so who was here last year
[31:15] okay so last year the skit was about
[31:18] making the right choice and
[31:21] this is a continuation of last year it
[31:25] is about once you've made your choice
[31:26] that now it's time to stand for it even
[31:29] if it's hard and scary
[31:31] you stand for your choice right
[31:35] um just pardon if you see any glitches
[31:37] we didn't have a lot of time to put this
[31:39] together
[31:40] so people are going to be trying to
[31:41] shuffle mics around just bear with us
[31:44] we have the front rows kind of know
[31:47] what's going on there's going to be
[31:49] times when they're cheering and you just
[31:51] follow along if you feel like it we want
[31:53] the energy to stay really good in here
[31:55] we don't want to feel boring because
[31:57] then the people on stage get nervous
[31:59] like I am right now so don't don't do
[32:02] that to them so just follow along if
[32:05] there's a video playing try to stay
[32:06] quiet so that everyone in the back can
[32:08] hear

[39:10] I'd rather take my with a bunch of
[39:12] little holy rollers and live in the
[39:14] presence of God than the bombs the
[39:15] biggest church in Chicago and be out of
[39:17] the kingdom of God
[39:22] all right
[40:03] as always I'm joined by the Hall of
[40:05] Famer himself Troy Aikman Troy uh
[40:08] likewise Joe good to be with you today
[40:10] I'm super excited as a former
[40:12] InterContinental world champion myself
[40:14] I've uh body slammed a few Hebrews in my
[40:16] day
[40:19] uh today is going to be a briska 117 a
[40:22] nice little cold front moving through
[40:23] the Middle East right now my goodness
[40:25] Troy did you just say 117 degrees I did
[40:29] it's really nice out there
[40:31] it's actually considered a cold front
[40:32] here in the Middle East
[40:34] well Troy you're certainly making me
[40:36] miss summers in South Carolina let's not
[40:38] keep the games waiting anymore first up
[40:40] we have the arm wrestling match between
[40:42] Abednego and the Babylonian Warrior
[40:45] Hakeem I like to kill
[40:49] and they're off uh it looks like they're
[40:52] trying to pull the opponent's arm down
[40:54] towards the table I believe that's
[40:56] exactly what they're doing Troy wow
[40:58] that's an interesting strategy I guess
[41:01] must be some kind of Babylonian
[41:03] technique
[41:04] oh it's a struggle and he's looks like
[41:07] all the Hebrew pulls out the upset
[41:09] unbelievable wow that is that's really
[41:12] surprising I I was going for Babylon on
[41:14] that one for sure me too Troy
[41:24] and we're off with rock paper scissors
[41:28] and here they go wait scissors beats
[41:30] Rock since when I'm pretty sure that
[41:33] okay well let's move on to the next
[41:35] match I think this is the best of three
[41:36] today
[41:37] so one two three shoot is that how that
[41:40] goes I think that is how that goes Troy
[41:41] haven't played since junior high
[41:46] this is the last round I think I think
[41:48] the Babylonians have got this one race
[41:50] how how did that happen Hebrew with the
[41:53] win then he cut the competition up with
[41:55] that one
[41:56] [Applause]
[42:02] well we're up for our weight lifting
[42:04] competition let's see who can pull the
[42:06] win out here Troy oh we got to go with
[42:08] Babylonian on this one because uh the
[42:10] vegetarians there's no way they can win
[42:11] right
[42:15] and they're off look at that form wow
[42:18] that's really good right there yep
[42:23] man I see veins popping out of his neck
[42:25] Troy I'm pretty sure that he was going
[42:27] on The Struggle Bus over here for
[42:28] Babylon how's this happening and the
[42:31] Hebrew pulls out the wind
[42:33] this is quite the upside I think there's
[42:35] cheating going on the strength of these
[42:37] Hebrews is astonishing Troy yeah
[42:40] especially for carrot diet
[42:46] we're down to the last game I cannot
[42:48] believe it and uh how are we 2-0 right
[42:50] now
[42:53] foreign
[42:56] [Music]
[43:15] [Music]
[43:17] [Applause]
[43:28] well Joe I can't believe this I guess
[43:30] better luck next time huh well that's
[43:32] pretty much a clean sweep for the
[43:34] Hebrews well that's it for us today
[43:35] folks
[43:36] [Applause]
[43:42] foreign
[43:47] [Applause]
[43:48] you and your friends have exceeded my
[43:50] expectations your God's laws are wise
[43:52] and effective maybe I'll try the Hebrew
[43:54] diet keto isn't really working for me

[44:47] don't forget to put the mic back when
[44:49] you're done okay
[44:53] foreign
[45:26] I already got it
[46:06] thank you
[46:19] in the second year of his Reign
[46:21] Nebuchadnezzar had dreams his mind was
[46:24] troubled and he could not sleep
[46:26] so the king summoned The Magician's
[46:28] enchanters Sorcerers and astrologers to
[46:31] tell him what he had dreamed when they
[46:33] came in and stood before the king he
[46:35] said to them I've had a dream that
[46:37] troubles me and I want to know what it
[46:39] means then the astrologers answered the
[46:42] king May the King live forever tell your
[46:45] servants dream and we will interpret it
[46:48] the king replied to the astrologers if
[46:51] you do not tell me what my dream was and
[46:53] interpret it I will have you cut into
[46:54] pieces and your house turn into Rubble
[46:57] but if you tell me the dream and explain
[46:58] it you will receive gifts and rewards
[47:01] and great honor so tell me the dream and
[47:03] interpret it for me once more they
[47:05] replied let the king tell his servants
[47:08] to dream and we will interpret it then
[47:11] the king answered I am certain that you
[47:13] are stalling for time because you
[47:15] realize that if you do not tell me there
[47:17] is only one penalty for you you have
[47:19] conspired to tell me misleading and
[47:21] wicked things hoping the situation will
[47:23] change so then tell me the dream and I
[47:26] will know that you can interpret it for
[47:27] me the astrologers answer the king there
[47:30] is no one on earth who can do what the
[47:32] king asked no King however Great and
[47:36] Mighty has ever asked such a thing of a
[47:38] magician enchanter or astrologer what
[47:41] the King asks is too difficult no one
[47:43] can reveal it to the king except the
[47:45] gods and they do not live among humans
[47:47] this made the king so Furious that he
[47:50] ordered the execution of all the wise
[47:52] men of Babylon so men were sent to look
[47:54] for Daniel and his friends to put them
[47:56] to death
[47:57] when ariak the commander of the King's
[47:59] Guard had gone out to put to death the
[48:01] wise men of Babylon Daniel spoke to him
[48:04] with wisdom and tact he asked the king's
[48:07] officers why did the king if she's such
[48:09] a harsh decree
[48:11] ariak then explained the matter to
[48:13] Daniel at this Daniel went into the king
[48:16] and asked for time so that he might
[48:18] interpret the dream for him then Daniel
[48:21] returned to his house and explained the
[48:23] matter to his friends hananiah Michelle
[48:25] and Azariah he urged them to plead for
[48:28] Mercy from the god of Heaven concerning
[48:30] this mystery so that he and his friends
[48:32] might not be executed with the rest of
[48:34] the wise men of Babylon during the night
[48:36] the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a
[48:38] vision then Daniel prays the god of
[48:41] Heaven blessed be the name of God
[48:43] forever and ever for wisdom and power
[48:47] belonged to him
[48:48] now the King Nebuchadnezzar he was a
[48:52] hearty man he said look what I have done
[48:54] then the lord gave him a dream and it's
[48:56] troubling and when he did he saw a great
[48:59] image and noticed the accuracy of God's
[49:02] Eternal Word King Nebuchadnezzar seen an
[49:05] image with a golden head and it's
[49:07] resting here was silver and his thighs
[49:10] were cracked and his feet was iron clay
[49:15] now notice how those kingdoms the salt
[49:18] this material is gold the Nets coming
[49:20] harder net is Silver the next is brave
[49:24] and the hardest of all of them is iron
[49:26] iron is the heart and notice how the
[49:29] Gentile world would start it would start
[49:32] a song then it's keeping harder and
[49:34] harder and harder and harder until it
[49:36] finally went out into the clay and iron
[49:39] mixed together and each one of those
[49:42] kingdoms now think
[49:44] 2500 years ago a single person that
[49:48] purpose in their heart that they would
[49:50] serve the law and would not be Father's
[49:53] Death Foretold this day to the knobs and
[49:56] every other age coming down
[50:07] foreign
[50:07] [Applause]
[50:17] [Music]
[50:27] yes great Kink many gods are certainly
[50:30] responsible for our success
[50:32] you know I think it's about time people
[50:34] recognize the great power of both chazar
[50:37] and the King he serves well King I am
[50:40] experienced in such matters and
[50:42] typically I don't name drop but I did
[50:46] advise the kings of Hebrew and belt the
[50:48] shazar his own home country
[50:53] [Applause]
[50:55] that's just hurtful
[50:59] what do you suggest well it's like I say
[51:02] when in doubt build an idol
[51:06] we'll build a great statue to Belt a
[51:08] shazar everyone loves worshiping a
[51:10] Graven image especially when it's
[51:12] mandatory
[51:19] and to me Aspen as
[51:24] your majesty may you live forever
[51:28] please don't kill me
[51:30] make an announcement to my citizens
[51:36] at the sound of music playing almost bow
[51:39] and worship at the image of Belton
[51:41] that that disobey shall be thrown into a
[51:45] Den of Lions
[51:48] Lions my Lord doesn't that seem a little
[51:51] like you know impractical
[51:54] I guess you're right it can't always be
[51:56] hungry
[51:57] we'll throw him into my furnace yeah
[51:59] that's better all right
[52:15] foreign
[52:27] [Music]
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:58] I want you to notice as soon as the king
[53:01] saw this vision and he made it he forced
[53:05] every person in his kingdom in his
[53:07] domain to worship the Demi he made an
[53:11] enemy and it's believed by scholars in
[53:14] which I do believe that a Spirit-filled
[53:16] person would see it that that he
[53:18] worshiped Daniels what he did and he
[53:20] made an image to Daniel and he called it
[53:24] Bell the pleasure he called Daniel Bell
[53:26] to pleasure which was the name of his
[53:28] God and he made an image and forced
[53:31] every person to worship that eating I
[53:34] want you to notice that the beginning of
[53:36] the Gentiles when God dealt with them
[53:38] they got party in their heart and forced
[53:41] every man to worship the image of a holy
[53:44] man and the Gentile age was issued in
[53:48] with that it will go out in the same way
[53:50] the same way of of pouring cup of the
[53:54] mark of the beast that will force people
[53:57] to worship images and to do the things
[54:01] that we've been taught that was contrary
[54:03] to the word of God and brother it'll be
[54:06] so slick and fly until it will receive
[54:09] the very easy not deposit I'll show you
[54:12] a better purpose in your heart tonight
[54:13] and be filled with God's holy spirit
[54:15] that you'll be able to discern her right
[54:18] among them when the population is issued

[55:17] out the image it's great to finally see
[55:19] a Hebrew getting some recognition around
[55:20] here
[55:22] Benjamin I am in Ishtar Daniel will be
[55:25] furious at this people worshiping him
[55:27] instead of God
[55:29] this is idolatry
[55:31] come on guys I'm just following
[55:35] just following your face to myself
[55:36] furnace

[56:24] they're some of my most trusted advisors
[56:26] oh King it is true we worship the one
[56:28] true God Jehovah and we will not bow
[56:31] down to any Graven image
[56:34] but your lives depend on it how dare you
[56:36] refuse to show loyalty to the great belt
[56:38] of shazar we can't worship Daniel we
[56:41] only worship His God
[56:44] our God is able to Deliver Us from the
[56:46] furnace but we will not bow to your
[56:47] image then we'll burn the religion out
[56:50] of you and then what God will deliver
[56:53] you
[57:05] got an awful picture here under
[57:07] consideration now of a Believer going to
[57:11] his death but let's turn our camera
[57:13] tonight towards heaven and while things
[57:15] are going on down here there's something
[57:17] going on up there
[57:18] [Music]
[57:37] the year was 500 BC and the entire host
[57:40] of heaven was watching a scene unfold
[57:42] when the king's decree went forth the
[57:44] Angels began Reckoning with the captives
[57:46] in Babylon might do after all idolatry
[57:49] was the reason they had all ended up in
[57:51] Babylon to begin with
[57:53] idolatry a way to fit in God's chosen
[57:56] people had commonly spurned the thing
[57:58] that set them apart from other nations
[58:00] a relationship with Jehovah in exchange
[58:02] for relations with other countries and
[58:05] their Idols would the Hebrew people
[58:06] break generations of weakness and defy
[58:08] their Babylonian Masters join us as we
[58:11] find out
[58:12] [Music]
[58:13] foreign
[58:21] [Music]
[58:22] can you say your name and your position
[58:24] for our viewers
[58:25] I'm the Archangel Gabriel
[58:28] captain of the Lord's hosts
[58:30] Gabriel take us back to that day how did
[58:33] things start
[58:34] all of heaven was on the edges of our
[58:36] seats we were hopeful for just a few
[58:38] servants
[58:40] be washed as one by one Babylonians into
[58:43] Hebrews alike fall to the image
[58:46] and how did that make you feel when you
[58:48] saw everyone bowing this image I was
[58:51] disappointed everyone was
[58:53] after generations of watching the
[58:55] Israelites fall into idolatry the
[58:57] anticipation grew for a few courageous
[59:00] men
[59:03] I am the Archangel Michael I sit at the
[59:06] right hand of the master
[59:09] how did you feel when you saw everyone
[59:10] bowing to this image well it was
[59:13] distressing I've spent centuries helping
[59:16] Jehovah protected people it's never easy
[59:19] to watch them fail
[59:21] I was the first one to notice them as
[59:24] the captain of the host I'm always
[59:26] vigilant for displays of Courage when I
[59:29] saw these three Hebrew boys refusing to
[59:32] Bow I knew these are true Warriors
[59:37] foreign
[59:39] did you notice the Hebrews refusing
[59:42] about
[59:44] Gabriel pointed out the young men to me
[59:46] I immediately knew they were among those
[59:49] who sit in prayer to the almighty no
[59:52] other human could possess such strength
[59:54] unless they knew Jehovah as the angel
[59:57] who sits at the right hand of God
[59:59] himself I am well acquainted with his
[1:00:02] presence
[1:00:05] I am wormwood I'm over the many Waters
[1:00:08] in The Fountains of the deep
[1:00:11] at what point did you notice the Hebrews
[1:00:14] I could feel a change in the atmosphere
[1:00:16] before I noticed the three Hebrews
[1:00:18] refusing to kneel there's always a
[1:00:20] change in the atmosphere before
[1:00:21] something important these men had
[1:00:23] already captured our attention by
[1:00:25] defying the king when they had refused
[1:00:27] his unclean table
[1:00:28] we had all washed with pride back then
[1:00:30] but now a great concern was arising
[1:00:33] amongst the angels
[1:00:35] these Faithful Servants who had never
[1:00:37] even glimpsed the reality of the most
[1:00:38] high
[1:00:40] had just sealed their fate in loyalty to
[1:00:42] him
[1:00:48] how did watching the children of Israel
[1:00:50] remain faithful affect you
[1:00:53] first I wondered what our orders would
[1:00:55] be the Lord normally tells us what to do
[1:00:57] in these kind of situations
[1:00:59] the orders never came in
[1:01:01] like many of my brothers I felt a great
[1:01:04] deal of relief but what now these men
[1:01:07] had just chosen a furnace of fire I knew
[1:01:11] I had to protect them
[1:01:13] what action did you take
[1:01:15] I rushed to the throne room to receive
[1:01:18] my orders I said master
[1:01:20] have you looked down to Babylon today
[1:01:23] three True Believers they're at their
[1:01:26] ends
[1:01:27] let me go down there I'll change the
[1:01:30] scene in just a few minutes
[1:01:34] so what action did you take
[1:01:36] I went with Gabriel to the throne
[1:01:39] I was ready to wipe out Babylon just
[1:01:41] like we did with Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:01:46] when the father looked at me I said look
[1:01:49] down there there are men who are walking
[1:01:52] in your provided way willing to seal
[1:01:55] their testimony
[1:01:56] one more step
[1:01:58] and death is right before them
[1:02:03] let me go and finish this
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:08] what action did you take I followed
[1:02:10] Gabriel Michael from Shirley the master
[1:02:13] had noticed a course of events
[1:02:15] Lord I said have you considered they're
[1:02:18] about to burn up three faithful
[1:02:19] believers
[1:02:21] you gave me the keys to the Great Waters
[1:02:22] and the antidote moving to destruction I
[1:02:25] poured water all over the Earth
[1:02:27] let me go down there
[1:02:29] I will wash all of that one away
[1:02:34] and how did the Lord react
[1:02:36] he said
[1:02:38] I've been watching them all night long I
[1:02:40] watched even The Sparrows
[1:02:42] and I've seen my servants in Babylon
[1:02:45] today
[1:02:46] you've been a faithful companion Michael
[1:02:48] but this is a man-sized job he just
[1:02:51] raised his hand and said
[1:02:54] I would let you all go but I can't
[1:02:57] he stood up in his Priestly robes and he
[1:03:01] said you've been a good angel
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:06] and you've always obeyed my orders
[1:03:09] that I'm going myself
[1:03:11] I'm going myself I'm going myself
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:15] and what did God do next
[1:03:17] he pointed at the Thunderhead growing in
[1:03:20] the North
[1:03:21] he spoke to it
[1:03:24] I can still hear him call the winds
[1:03:26] north south east and west
[1:03:30] everything in the heavens obey him
[1:03:32] he stepped off his throne onto this
[1:03:34] Thunderhead like a chariot he reached
[1:03:36] over and he hooked the Four Winds to the
[1:03:39] Thundercloud like four massive Celestial
[1:03:42] horses he rode down to Babylon on that
[1:03:45] Chariot of Thunder cracking lightning
[1:03:47] like a whip
[1:03:49] finally right then and there he had
[1:03:51] picked the right man for the job
[1:03:53] and as he passed the Sea of life he
[1:03:56] picked up a palm to Fan the Flames when
[1:03:58] he arrived
[1:04:00] after the countless times that God sent
[1:04:02] an angel to carry out his commands when
[1:04:05] he saw these young Hebrews standing for
[1:04:07] him he left his throne to stand with
[1:04:10] them
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:13] I watched them all night long
[1:04:17] I heard him in the prayer meeting last
[1:04:19] night
[1:04:21] I heard him when they prayed too and
[1:04:24] this struck Heaven here with their
[1:04:25] prayers I lost him I know they got one
[1:04:28] more set to go I've been watching them
[1:04:30] all night long I can't let you go
[1:04:31] because it's a man's side job I'm going
[1:04:34] myself
[1:04:35] he's still watching tonight watching me
[1:04:37] he's watching you he's watch where we'll
[1:04:39] stand or not stand what decisions we
[1:04:42] will make whether we'll stand straight
[1:04:44] to the word or get away from it it's
[1:04:47] later than you think
