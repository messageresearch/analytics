[11:17] that's a good that's a good sign
[11:19] you're addicted
[11:21] you can't concentrate on your daily
[11:22] tasks or you wait for urgency of the
[11:24] moment when you get in touch with the
[11:26] word
[11:27] if you don't have any withdrawal
[11:29] symptoms from the word this morning
[11:32] it don't make a difference in your life
[11:33] it has to make a difference the bible
[11:35] says your word is a lamp to my feet and
[11:38] a light in my path
[11:40] you can't be without that lamp you can't
[11:42] be without that light in this day it's a
[11:44] dark day
[11:45] we gotta have the light
[11:47] we need this word to survive in this
[11:50] world i'm gonna go a step further we
[11:52] need this world to survive to overcome
[11:55] this world
[11:56] oh mercy that's the basic requirement
[11:59] is the addiction of god
[12:01] word addiction in your life and keep
[12:03] track of your withdrawal systems
[12:05] recognize that you have an addiction
[12:08] if you got the wrong one recognize it's
[12:10] wrong and change it we could change our
[12:12] addictions today
[12:13] there's two different kinds of
[12:14] addictions one in the world we don't
[12:16] know that and a godly one
[12:18] let me skip here a little bit
[12:20] amen first corinthians
[12:23] see if you're addicted to satan and the
[12:25] things of the world
[12:27] jesus is here for you
[12:29] in john 8 8 36 that the son has set you
[12:32] free you are free indeed first
[12:34] corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the
[12:36] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[12:39] kingdom of god be not deceived nor
[12:42] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[12:45] nor infinite nor abuser themselves with
[12:47] mankind nor thieves door covenants nor
[12:49] drunkers nor revelers nor extortioners
[12:50] shall unhurt the kingdom of god
[12:53] these people are addicted
[12:55] they're addicted to the wrong thing paul
[12:57] says
[12:58] and such were some of you
[13:00] but you are washed and are sanctified
[13:03] you are justified in the name of the
[13:05] lord jesus by the spirit of our god all
[13:08] things he says are lawful unto me
[13:11] but all things are not expedient
[13:14] paul's quoting a slogan that the
[13:16] immature corinthians used all things are
[13:18] lawful for me
[13:20] he said if you're quoting this scripture
[13:22] to justify looking like the world here's
[13:24] what paul calls you immature christians
[13:27] all things are not expedient
[13:30] it's not profitable
[13:33] it could be good to control to collect
[13:36] or contribute in order to help hence to
[13:37] help be profitable
[13:39] is it profitable to you he said all
[13:42] things are lawful for me but i will not
[13:44] be brought under the power of any
[13:49] to have power authority to use your
[13:51] power to be the master of you
[13:54] he says you're not gonna let this be the
[13:56] master of you paul says i will not be
[13:58] brought under the law of
[14:00] under the power of an addiction
[14:04] he's not going to be brought under that
[14:05] power addiction because he that overcome
[14:07] what's edifying you he said all things
[14:09] are lawful to me but all things are not
[14:11] expedient all things are lawful for me
[14:14] he's trying to say it again but all
[14:16] things edify not
[14:19] it don't build you up he don't restore
[14:21] you it don't promote growth in christian
[14:23] wisdom and health what is edifying you
[14:26] is it the things of the world or is it
[14:28] of god in first peter 2 4 to whom coming
[14:31] as a living stone disallowed indeed of
[14:34] men but chosen of god and precious ye
[14:38] also are lively stones and you're built
[14:41] up a spiritual house a holy proof to it
[14:44] to offer up a spiritual sacrifice lively
[14:47] stones is this you this morning to be
[14:50] alive you're quick to live to breathe to
[14:53] be among the living
[14:55] you're not dead
[14:57] it's living water
[14:59] you're alive you're living water this
[15:01] morning if you're addicted to jesus
[15:03] christ this is what you are
[15:05] oh lord and verse in verse 9
[15:08] peter 2
[15:09] ye are a chosen generation a royal
[15:12] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[15:16] people that you should show forth the
[15:18] praises of him who has called you out of
[15:21] darkness into marvelous light
[15:24] which in times past you were not a
[15:27] people
[15:29] you were not a people in times past
[15:33] but are now the people of god
[15:37] one time you
[15:38] weren't we were just roaming this world
[15:41] nothing
[15:42] but now we are somebody
[15:45] hallelujah
[15:48] about lost my place which had not
[15:50] obtained mercy but now you have mercy
[15:53] hallelujah we didn't have mercy at one
[15:55] time but now we do we have become lively
[15:59] stones
[16:00] we have become living water
[16:03] addiction is a thirst for something
[16:06] you're longing for it
[16:07] god has placed something in you to
[16:09] thirst
[16:11] we have a thirst for this world
[16:14] you can have a thirst for this world or
[16:16] one for god in psalms it says the heart
[16:18] pantheth after the water brooks so
[16:20] pantheth my so after thee o god
[16:23] panith means to long for do you long for
[16:26] it

[16:33] when shall i come and appear before him
[16:36] my soul thirsts for god my soul don't
[16:38] thirst for some dead religion
[16:41] my soul ain't thirsting for muhammad or
[16:43] buddha my soul ain't even thirsting for
[16:45] brother branham there's only one person
[16:47] i'm thirsting for this morning and
[16:48] that's the lord jesus christ
[16:51] there's my addiction
[16:53] like i said i'm addicted to it
[16:55] i hope you can tell i hope you leave
[16:57] this place addicted we could change our
[16:59] addictions right here this morning
[17:02] in john 7 37 in the last day the great
[17:04] day of the feast
[17:06] jesus
[17:09] we know we well familiar with that
[17:10] scripture this was during the feast of
[17:12] the tabernacles jesus was in jerusalem
[17:14] this was the eighth day
[17:16] the eighth day signifying the end of the
[17:18] feast
[17:20] on this day they had the ceremony of
[17:22] drawing and pouring water attending the
[17:25] usual rejoicings as on others days at
[17:27] which time there was great rejoicing
[17:30] piping dancing and this ceremony they
[17:32] say is a tradition of moses from mount
[17:34] sinai and refers to some secret and
[17:37] mysterious things yea they plainly say
[17:39] that it has respect to the pouring forth
[17:42] of the holy ghost
[17:44] they draw the holy ghost isaiah 12 3
[17:47] therefore with joy shall ye draw water
[17:50] out of the wells of salvation now this
[17:53] is referring to jesus
[17:55] when he is
[17:57] when he is the water that we drink
[18:00] he is the one our soul longeth for he's
[18:03] the one that we need to be addicted to
[18:05] and john back in john 37 saint 73 in the
[18:08] last days the great day of the feast
[18:10] jesus stood up and cried
[18:12] most times he'll sit down and teach the
[18:14] people but this got a hold of him he
[18:16] stood up and cried this out saying if
[18:19] any man thirst
[18:22] let him come unto me and drink
[18:25] this word right here to suffer a thirst
[18:29] those who say to thirst painfully
[18:33] feel their want of eagerly long for
[18:37] these things by which the soul is
[18:39] refreshed to support his strength jesus
[18:41] is saying who is thirsty
[18:44] who wants it so bad it hurts
[18:48] i want it so bad it's hurting i long for
[18:50] god
[18:52] let him come to me and drink
[18:54] you have courage he's encouraging you
[18:57] this morning to come up here and drink
[18:59] to take of the water of life freely or
[19:01] take of his grace freely
[19:03] salvation by him is free
[19:07] you know costs that's nothing just
[19:08] surrendered heart
[19:11] and the pardon of sin according to the
[19:12] riches of grace and justification is
[19:14] freely by his grace
[19:16] so all other blessings and this that
[19:17] they may drink abundantly
[19:20] that they may partake of it largely
[19:23] there is a fullness of grace in christ
[19:25] there is abundance of it that give it to
[19:27] his people it's exceeding abundant he's
[19:30] not going to run out
[19:32] brother brown said that blessed holy
[19:34] thirst that god gave you
[19:36] to thirst after him you've perverted
[19:38] into things of the world and craving for
[19:41] the things of this world
[19:44] that's tough right there
[19:46] john 6 35 and jesus said unto him i am
[19:49] the bread of life
[19:51] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[19:54] and he that believeth on me shall never
[19:57] thirst
[20:00] we eat this bread
[20:03] it's like it's like bread in restaurants
[20:05] my wife fix bread i love it
[20:08] you kind of say i'm addicted to it
[20:10] i'm addicted to bread i'm also addicted
[20:13] to the bread of life
[20:15] he's living down on the inside
[20:17] we love
[20:18] it he's your bread he's your water
[20:22] it's a woman at the well we know what
[20:23] her addiction was
[20:25] she's addicted too many husbands
[20:27] [Laughter]
[20:29] she comes as a whale and jesus asked her
[20:31] for a drink
[20:32] you know how the story ended she changed
[20:34] her addiction
[20:36] because jesus said whosoever drinketh of
[20:38] this water shall never thirst again but
[20:41] whosoever drinketh of the water that i
[20:44] give
[20:47] him shall never thirst
[20:50] but the water that i shall give him
[20:51] shall be in him a well of springing
[20:56] how many got that whale up until
[20:58] everlasting life and the woman said sir
[21:00] give me that water
[21:02] i'm saying the same thing sir give me
[21:04] that water
[21:06] brother i said thou knewest the gift of
[21:08] god and who it is that saith that he
[21:10] give me a drink thou would has asked of
[21:12] him
[21:13] and he would have given the living water
[21:16] when whosoever drinketh of the water
[21:18] that i shall give him shall never thirst
[21:20] but the water that i shall give him
[21:24] shall be in him a well of water
[21:26] springing up unto everlasting life that
[21:30] same living water is mentioned
[21:32] but this time it's not called a river
[21:35] it's called an artesian well that's
[21:37] where people make their mistakes because
[21:39] it's called a well it's called a well
[21:41] and a river and they think that in one
[21:43] place it is eternal life given by the
[21:45] spirit and the next place when it's
[21:46] called by a river implying a great
[21:49] dianism it has to be the spirit now
[21:52] given has an endowment of power
[21:55] we go so many places with that but i
[21:57] won't it's the endowment of power
[22:01] it's one and the same
[22:04] but it's a spirit that gives life and
[22:06] power that came at pentecost
[22:10] okay i barely could not do that but
[22:12] jesus says he that believeth on me
[22:15] as the scripture has said out of his
[22:18] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[22:22] out of your inner most
[22:24] being will flow rivers of living water
[22:28] what are you thirsting for
[22:30] drink from jesus christ that out of you
[22:34] shall flow jesus christ
[22:36] hallelujah
[22:38] nothing but the spirit of god the holy
[22:40] ghost is flowing out of you
[22:43] hallelujah
[22:45] man skip a little bit
[22:48] and when we receive the holy ghost it'll
[22:50] make you do the same things that it did
[22:52] at the jews at the end of that feast
[22:55] you'll shout you'll rejoice we won't sit
[22:58] around feeling sorry for ourselves
[23:00] with this world in such a turmoil
[23:04] hallelujah
[23:05] the believer upon drinking by coming
[23:08] unto jesus in faith would have rivers of
[23:10] living water pouring out of him
[23:14] you'll have so much water pulling out of
[23:16] you
[23:16] it'll flow onto your sister beside you
[23:19] the brother beside of you
[23:21] everybody's going to be wet with the
[23:22] holy ghost
[23:24] we're being addicted by by god i'm
[23:29] about i'm about finished here
[23:31] i'm going to run out of time
[23:33] barrett said they refuse to drink from
[23:35] the fountains of living water
[23:37] what makes all these things in this
[23:38] world today what makes these ladies wear
[23:40] little shorts
[23:41] what makes them wear them blouses that
[23:43] you can see their clothes through
[23:45] what is it he said his hungry children
[23:47] are thirsty blessed are ye when you
[23:50] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[23:53] jesus says you will not come to me
[23:55] he said listen the reason they do it is
[23:57] because that they have rejected the
[23:59] fountains of living water
[24:01] and have drunk from a hollywood broken
[24:03] cistern
[24:05] they receded through an old vulgar
[24:07] television and so forth like that in the
[24:09] very plan that they've done they went
[24:12] right straight back to eden where it
[24:15] began
[24:18] you don't have to wait
[24:19] until the next camp meeting
[24:21] the next special service the next youth
[24:23] camp
[24:24] it could happen right here today
[24:27] you can become addicted to god
[24:30] change your addictions
[24:33] change it the only way you change it
[24:35] is the holy ghost
[24:37] on the day of pentecost he poured out
[24:39] his blessings upon the people
[24:42] peter comes staggered out of the upper
[24:43] room drunk on the holy ghost
[24:45] he was addicted where before he was
[24:48] lying he wasn't he was even fishing
[24:50] naked but all of a sudden on the day of
[24:52] pentecost the power of god dropped down
[24:56] he could he come staggered under the
[24:58] drunk of the holy ghost oh bro i feel it
[25:01] right now
[25:02] i feel that power dropping down right
[25:04] now the anointing holy ghost it'll make
[25:08] you forget those things outside that
[25:10] door

[25:12] without being this addicted to this holy
[25:15] ghost
