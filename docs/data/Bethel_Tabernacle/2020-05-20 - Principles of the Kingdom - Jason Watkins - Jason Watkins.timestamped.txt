[32:46] Romans chapter 12
[32:48] amen happy to be here in the house of
[32:51] the Lord tonight glad that y'all could
[32:53] make it out
[32:54] praise the Lord we're still going along
[32:57] with our partial audience and we're just
[33:02] still trying to be careful for a
[33:04] testimony sake I I you know we're
[33:07] watching for the official word when they
[33:09] seem to be okay with gathering everybody
[33:13] back at the same time and not having to
[33:15] worry too much about having enough room
[33:18] to be tall distance apart now we're
[33:20] hoping hoping hoping hoping that that's
[33:23] by the first weekend in June there's no
[33:25] way to know so I just weirdest would
[33:28] have see we'll see how it goes but
[33:29] that's what my intention is as of
[33:32] tonight if if you know if the Greeks
[33:36] don't rise as they say if too many if it
[33:38] doesn't go backwards and they start you
[33:40] know reeling everything in again then I
[33:43] hope by my best estimate we should be
[33:46] able to have the whole assembly back
[33:49] amen
[33:50] by the first weekend of June how many Oh
[33:55] pray amen we want to be gathering back
[33:59] amen
[33:59] praise the Lord Romans chapter 12 want
[34:04] to speak to you tonight we've been
[34:06] speaking about this as a theme and I
[34:09] want to take - a title tonight
[34:11] principles of the kingdom we've been
[34:14] talking about that as a theme about you
[34:16] know how many believe we're Kings
[34:17] children well brother BAM said when
[34:20] you're kings child you should act like
[34:22] that and so the Bible is very clear how
[34:26] that we should act and I love that the
[34:30] scripture doesn't just burden you with
[34:33] with legalism what the scripture does is
[34:38] help you act the right way by telling
[34:42] you how to think
[34:44] and so it first tells us what kind of
[34:47] mind to have because God knows if you've
[34:49] got the right mental attitude toward his
[34:51] word then then the manifestation will
[34:54] just show up and your flesh amen as
[34:57] ministers you know every minister knows
[35:00] that you know when you're when you're
[35:03] seeing the lack of that manifestation of
[35:07] the word in people's lives you're not
[35:09] you're not thinking in your mind I can
[35:12] tell you I don't as a minister I'm not
[35:14] thinking oh wow reprobate people you
[35:16] know know what I'm what I'm realizing is
[35:18] is that people don't have the right
[35:20] value for the word might be very good
[35:23] people God's family elect jean of god
[35:26] but but that doesn't guarantee that you
[35:29] will have the right mental attitude
[35:30] toward his word because i can see a lot
[35:33] of times that the you know the the the
[35:37] the lack of a proper manifestation
[35:40] there's a lack of it's missing because
[35:43] there's not the right mental
[35:45] appreciation for what god had to say
[35:48] about our lives and I think I made the
[35:51] point early on that the Bible does not
[35:54] just it doesn't in a majority it doesn't
[35:58] in a majority it does not in a majority
[36:02] deal with getting you to heaven it deals
[36:08] with that about 50 percent it's not a
[36:11] majority it's about 50 percent and the
[36:14] other half of the Bible is teaching you
[36:16] how to live while you're here amen so
[36:19] it's not just all about getting you
[36:21] there that's that's half of it but it's
[36:24] also about helping you to live here
[36:27] before you go there amen and so you know
[36:33] I want to live the way he wants me to
[36:36] live a man praise the Lord Romans
[36:39] chapter 12 would just have a few verses
[36:41] here we'll read verses one two and three
[36:46] in Romans 12 verses one through three I
[36:53] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[36:56] mercies of God
[36:57] that you present your bodies a living
[37:00] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[37:04] is your reasonable service and be not
[37:08] conformed to this world but be
[37:11] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[37:14] that you may prove what is that good and
[37:18] acceptable and perfect will of God for I
[37:22] say through the grace given unto me to
[37:25] every man that is among you
[37:27] this is so vital not to think of himself
[37:31] more highly than he ought to think but
[37:33] to think soberly according as God hath
[37:37] dealt to every man the measure of faith
[37:39] so God has given us a revelation of how
[37:44] to think of what to believe how that it
[37:47] should conduct our lives and we should
[37:49] never you don't never want to set your -
[37:52] - to you know present yourself as a
[37:57] greater authority over what needs to go
[38:00] on in your life than the one who made
[38:02] you okay but you amazingly see people do
[38:07] that all the time
[38:08] they think they know what's best for
[38:10] them even if it flies in the face of
[38:13] God's principles in his word so we want
[38:16] to deal with that tonight let's pray
[38:18] father we thank you for you this word
[38:20] thank you for your rapid anointing that
[38:23] I already feel thank you Lord for these
[38:26] people who have gathered tonight now be
[38:28] with both speaker and hearer I just call
[38:31] myself and humble myself now lord I want
[38:34] to be an Oracle of you I want to take no
[38:37] thought of my own I just want to stay
[38:39] out of your way so help me now Lord
[38:41] Jesus let let my human side just go away
[38:45] into the background and may you come now
[38:48] and take over the vessel and use your
[38:50] gift it's yours
[38:51] you built it you installed it you you
[38:54] service it you operate it it's yours
[38:55] completely so Lord I completely give it
[38:59] to you now in Jesus name help me now -
[39:01] to do that
[39:03] what's purposed in my heart in Jesus
[39:05] name Amen god bless friends you can be
[39:07] seated
[39:15] praise the Lord so I want you brother
[39:22] Mac give me that verse in Romans again
[39:24] please Romans 12 and let's read through
[39:27] it again a little more slowly because I
[39:29] want to bring some things to your
[39:31] attention so he begins here I beseech
[39:35] you brethren I beseech you therefore
[39:37] brethren and you know that word
[39:40] therefore means that you know in in
[39:44] light of everything that I've said
[39:46] previously now that all being true and
[39:50] if and if we don't have the time to go
[39:52] through it all but you know he talks
[39:54] about all the depth of the riches both
[39:56] of the wisdom of and knowledge of God
[39:58] how unsearchable are his judgments his
[40:01] ways past finding out he deals with
[40:03] about a lot of that and and how Israel
[40:05] would be saved and and and he takes a
[40:08] lot of time to that church there in Rome
[40:10] to express to them not only you know
[40:14] it's it's one thing to express what
[40:17] God's plan is but you really need to
[40:20] start with this God has a plan I want
[40:24] you to get that God has a plan he's not
[40:27] figuring this out as he goes he's not
[40:31] caught off guard and and that's why with
[40:35] perfect faith and authority God can say
[40:41] to you and even command you don't fear
[40:45] it would've be an offense to God for you
[40:49] to be afraid of any circumstance I get
[40:52] the human things can come up and there's
[40:54] an alarm and there's your startled and
[40:56] there might can be a fear of not talking
[40:57] about that I'm talking about in the
[40:59] realm of your soul where faith ought to
[41:01] back up and say wait a minute I'm a
[41:03] child of God he's got this and I don't
[41:07] know what's going to happen it looks
[41:08] fearful but I'm making a decision I
[41:11] therefore in light of everything Paul
[41:14] has taught me by the mercies of God I'm
[41:17] going to present my body a sacrifice in
[41:20] other words I'm going to cast down
[41:22] thinking I'm gonna cast down my plans
[41:24] gonna forget my agenda see cuz my agenda
[41:30] should have been laid aside when I
[41:33] married the word a man when because the
[41:38] word is mine mate that the Reaper the
[41:40] revealed word that's your mate the
[41:42] divinely revealed word that's Christ you
[41:44] understand we're the Bride of Christ and
[41:46] and God made it clear to the woman that
[41:50] thy desire shall be to thy husband
[41:52] so whatever plans you had sister
[41:56] whatever your aspirations and your
[41:58] dreams when you fell in love with the
[42:00] man and you took his name you also take
[42:03] his his agenda his plans his goals you
[42:07] absorb that you take on his name you
[42:10] take on his dreams you share in what God
[42:14] has led him and you as a wife you
[42:17] Stepan's beside that and you be a help
[42:20] to his revelation see my desire shall be
[42:26] to thy husband so your agenda should be
[42:29] to thy husband your desires your plans
[42:32] whatever you have in life that you want
[42:34] out of life and listen friends you
[42:37] didn't put yourself here you ought not
[42:39] to be trying to control your life while
[42:41] you're here you ought to say you put me
[42:43] here you gave me a battle plan you gave
[42:46] me marching orders and I just want to
[42:48] know what you want me to do Lord and I
[42:52] plan to go forward and and and and and
[42:56] the only way that I'm guaranteed success
[42:59] and don't measure success by human
[43:03] standard whatever you do because God
[43:05] will give you success that to the world
[43:07] would look like unsuccess though to the
[43:12] world God's vision of success for you
[43:16] can look like folly to the world but you
[43:19] know God is not mocked because you know
[43:22] what the world calls success God calls
[43:24] foolishness and I'm sorry but I'll take
[43:27] his interpretation of what's wise and
[43:30] what's foolish because I already
[43:32] see the folly of men all I got to do is
[43:37] look at the perfection that I see in
[43:39] nature and I figure out real quick who I
[43:41] want to follow hey man we gonna follow
[43:44] mankind that and then he has his whole
[43:47] history is a history of kingdoms rising
[43:50] and kingdoms falling kingdoms starting
[43:53] out great and then kingdoms crashing and
[43:55] burning and that's the logic you're
[43:58] gonna follow you're gonna follow
[43:59] humanism and man's philosophy he hasn't
[44:02] been able to sustain himself for 6,000
[44:05] years he's constantly burning his own
[44:09] house down and burning nations down and
[44:11] if it wasn't for the mercy of God the
[44:13] world would have done been in ashes so I
[44:17] have no problem looking thee you know
[44:21] the world in the eye and saying go on
[44:24] with your bad self I will follow the
[44:26] Lord I will take what he thinks about
[44:29] how I ought to live and so he says so
[44:34] you know present your bodies a living
[44:36] sacrifice there is no way it is it is
[44:41] you can there's no way to justify that
[44:45] you are presenting your bodies a living
[44:47] sacrifice if you're refusing his
[44:50] thoughts for your life if you're calling
[44:54] your own shots and making your own
[44:55] decisions I'm sorry I'm not saying
[44:58] you're not a child of God I'm just
[45:00] simply saying you need to understand who
[45:02] the father is and who the child is I
[45:07] have it happen all the time you know and
[45:09] I tell you over the years it becomes a
[45:13] great you know painful wound when I
[45:17] because because now that I you know you
[45:20] you you you gain wisdom that's an
[45:22] advantage of gray hair that's an
[45:25] advantage of years length of days you
[45:28] gain perspective
[45:29] yeah that's why bread they asked for the
[45:31] bread and he said you know if God you
[45:32] know you know which would you rather
[45:34] have the first you know 25 second 25 you
[45:37] know or the last and he said I'd like to
[45:39] have the last quarter because he said
[45:42] now he said I wouldn't jump at things he
[45:45] said I'm
[45:46] more stable I'm I'm more I'm you know
[45:48] yeah he's older and hit the body's
[45:50] breaking down and brother branham said
[45:52] everyday and I get out of bed I got a
[45:53] new pain but he's understanding more how
[45:57] to operate as a servant of God see and
[46:02] you know I and and stop trying to be the
[46:06] hero and just let him be the hero so you
[46:10] know but but and so that's an advantage
[46:12] the the the I don't know to call it a
[46:16] dark side but I'll call it a painful
[46:17] side is also with length of years
[46:20] especially in pastoring is you see the
[46:24] mistakes that you tried to warn families
[46:28] about when they were young and raising
[46:31] young children and you saw the direction
[46:34] they were going was not according to the
[46:37] principles of his word and you could see
[46:41] that it wasn't and you know a lot of
[46:44] times friends when you get into
[46:45] situations I want to make this statement
[46:47] early because we're talking about
[46:50] principles of the kingdom principles of
[46:52] God's Word there are plenty of
[46:53] Commandments in the Bible but a lot of
[46:55] what the Bible teaches you is principles
[46:57] because you're going to get in
[46:59] situations where you're you're looking
[47:02] at a situation and you can't find a
[47:04] direct Scripture and you don't know what
[47:07] does the word tell me to do about this
[47:09] and it's right in front of you and
[47:11] you've got to make a decision and you
[47:12] want to make the right one I'm gonna
[47:14] here to tell you something friends a lot
[47:15] of times you're Ground Zero and you
[47:16] can't really see it take the principle
[47:19] of God's Word because the principles
[47:21] flying at fifty thousand feet it can see
[47:23] the whole thing and God knows the
[47:25] direction so I don't know what's over
[47:29] the hill but I know that's the direction
[47:31] I need to go because that's where the
[47:33] North Star is pointing me to so brother
[47:36] Brandon would preach a sermon out of the
[47:38] Bible turning northward and so we
[47:42] realized that you know God has
[47:45] principles in his word that that a lot
[47:48] of times people say I'm not sure what
[47:50] God's Word says about this when you're
[47:51] not then you know it's light it's like
[47:54] principles are like the instruments you
[47:56] know in an aircraft a lot of times
[47:58] you're flying by sight
[47:59] but sometimes you get in a situation
[48:02] like it's dark or you're in clouds or
[48:05] you're in a storm and the truth is you
[48:07] can't see the horizon you don't even
[48:10] know which ways up that pilots know this
[48:14] brother John could testify to this
[48:16] tonight you can become disoriented and
[48:18] think you're you're flying upward
[48:20] because you're pulling back on the stick
[48:22] don't know you're inverted and when you
[48:25] pull back on the stick you're doing that
[48:26] and pilots have flew straight into the
[48:28] earth doing that so you've got to be
[48:32] rated on your instruments that when you
[48:33] can't see you've got to look at your
[48:36] instruments they will tell you your
[48:38] attitude your altitude your pitch your
[48:41] speed and you got to be able to trust
[48:43] that don't take some friends we're in a
[48:44] time where there's a lot we don't know
[48:46] but I do know I have an instrument panel
[48:49] I don't know I can't see it's a cloudy
[48:51] way things are happening that have never
[48:53] happened
[48:54] the bride is facing things she's never
[48:56] faced so I'm looking at my instrument I
[48:58] am for sure not looking at it politics
[49:01] I'm for sure not looking the science I'm
[49:04] for sure not looking to theology
[49:06] I got an instrument panel in front of me
[49:08] I don't have to be able to see where I'm
[49:12] going this knows where I am and it knows
[49:15] where I need to be and it knows how to
[49:17] get me from here to there safely people
[49:23] can get in their life and think they're
[49:25] going along fine say hey I'm flying
[49:27] Heena yeah you know you know not to not
[49:31] not to disparage the dead at all you
[49:34] know the pilot of Kobe Bryant the
[49:37] basketball star and Kobe and his
[49:39] daughter I promise you they didn't leave
[49:41] that day intending to crash and die and
[49:44] here's the here's the reality they were
[49:46] flying until they weren't they didn't
[49:51] know that what he said well I've got a
[49:53] lot of aptitude I'm doing good
[49:55] well so did they they had altitude but
[49:58] there was a hill a mountain in front of
[50:01] them they couldn't see
[50:02] they went into a bank and all visibility
[50:06] was lost and they flew full-speed almost
[50:09] 200 miles an hour into the side of a
[50:11] mountain so a lot of times people people
[50:16] think you know I'm going along and this
[50:19] is looking good and I think it's the
[50:21] right thing and all the time I'm looking
[50:23] at the instrument panel I'm looking over
[50:25] their shoulder as a pastor and I'm
[50:28] looking at the instrument panel I'm
[50:30] going I think you need to pull up oh no
[50:33] I'm going right along we're happy
[50:36] everything is coming up roses yeah I
[50:39] think you need to pull up like now like
[50:42] yeah pump up now pump right now right
[50:45] now and if you don't then you won't be
[50:47] flying in a few minutes so that's tragic
[50:51] that's only half the tragedy the other
[50:53] half of the tragedy is there's no redos
[50:55] many times people fly into a mountain in
[50:58] their life because they wouldn't trust
[51:00] the instrument panel of God's Word and
[51:02] they crashed and there was no way to
[51:05] rebuild the plane they might have barely
[51:06] survived with their own life or the
[51:08] lives of their children and I've seen
[51:09] that happen so many times in long years
[51:12] in pastoring two and a half decades have
[51:14] caused a lot of heartache a lot of
[51:18] heartache
[51:18] I can promise you the heartache that you
[51:22] suffer is not really so much heartache
[51:24] I've had people be against me
[51:26] that's water off a duck's back really
[51:28] you know it's not everybody's gonna love
[51:30] me or appreciate me that's fine whatever
[51:32] you know people do you're wrong talk
[51:34] about you you get over that stuff but
[51:36] what you don't get over is when you see
[51:38] people who you loved and you cared about
[51:40] it you still love them you still cared
[51:41] about it and you see and you see their
[51:43] their family in pieces and their
[51:44] children in pieces and it's all because
[51:46] you were trying to get them to follow
[51:48] the principles and they wouldn't do it
[51:50] and then and then the next generation
[51:54] comes along and then you see their
[51:55] children who now they're rising up and
[51:58] now they're making the same decisions
[52:01] and they're going in the same way and
[52:02] they're ignoring the same ins
[52:03] panel and they're saying well I'm living
[52:07] a Christian life by the commandments but
[52:09] what about the principles because the
[52:12] kingdom of God is governed by the
[52:14] principles and then God has a way now
[52:18] there is a way that seemeth right to a
[52:22] man the end there up flies into a
[52:25] mountain alright so you're to present
[52:32] your body a living sacrifice holy and
[52:35] acceptable to God it's your reasonable
[52:37] service and be not conformed to this
[52:40] world now watch because I told you
[52:42] thoughts precede your actions so he's
[52:45] saying in your actions don't be
[52:46] conformed to the world but be here's the
[52:48] remedy be transformed in the renewing of
[52:50] your mind if you don't want to conform
[52:53] to the world into their actions I
[52:56] promise you you don't have enough
[52:58] willpower to resist that so you've got
[53:01] to be renewed in your mind and not just
[53:03] in a new birth but you need to be
[53:05] renewed daily daily in the Word of God
[53:09] that you may prove what is that good and
[53:13] acceptable and perfect will of God
[53:15] you have an opportunity to be a trophy
[53:20] of that verse that in your life God can
[53:25] sent a rent you as a symbol of somebody
[53:29] who proved his word was true and proved
[53:32] in their life that his word works and it
[53:36] and his word is then on display and
[53:39] that's why God can say to the devil have
[53:41] you considered my trophy job have you
[53:46] considered a man who doesn't go by his
[53:48] own thinking and this is even before the
[53:51] Holy Ghost he goes by my word he
[53:53] considers my word and everything he does
[53:57] job proves what is a good and acceptable
[54:02] and perfect will of God for I say to you
[54:07] through the grace when verse 3 did you
[54:09] take it down verse 3 for I say through
[54:12] the grace given unto me to every man
[54:15] that is a
[54:15] among you not to think of himself more
[54:18] highly than he ought to think but to
[54:21] think soberly according as God hath
[54:23] dealt to every man the measure of faith
[54:25] so so we find then that that we have a a
[54:31] reasonable service now you know we you
[54:37] have a legal term you know reasonable
[54:39] and usual and you know I was discussing
[54:42] this before the errand today and we were
[54:44] talking about the legal ramifications
[54:45] you know of what is reasonable and in in
[54:48] in laws of civil trials and criminal
[54:52] trials and and a lot of times it you
[54:55] know you might have done something
[54:56] that's the law
[54:57] you broke a law and then if it's
[54:59] negligent now then then you're you know
[55:01] you're even you're even found to be even
[55:03] more guilty not only can they get you in
[55:04] criminal they can get you in civil and
[55:06] then if you even if you didn't break a
[55:08] criminal law they can still get you in
[55:10] civil and sue you because you were
[55:12] negligent and you know the whole whole
[55:16] idea of what's reasonable and usual now
[55:20] I wanna I want to kind of ask this
[55:22] question for a minute do you imagine and
[55:26] and is somewhat of a loaded question and
[55:29] I'm sure your answer is going to be no
[55:31] if you're a believer you know it is is
[55:35] our reasonable and usual the same as the
[55:39] world know because the world has an idea
[55:43] of what's reasonable and usual we have a
[55:47] completely different notion of what's
[55:50] reasonable and usual Amen so you know is
[55:58] there anything you know by the world
[56:01] standards now is there anything worldly
[56:05] reasonable or worldly usable you usual
[56:09] about your service to God well the
[56:12] answer again of course is no my service
[56:15] to God looks different than the world
[56:19] thinks it should be the world has a
[56:22] notion they've got a notion of what it
[56:25] means to be a usual Christian and it's a
[56:28] million
[56:30] they've got an idea of what it means and
[56:33] they will say to you you know you know
[56:35] you you you you need to be reasonable
[56:38] I mean you know you women you men your
[56:41] children your homes why do you have this
[56:43] and you don't have that you're allowing
[56:44] you don't allow and you go to here you
[56:46] you you you you you you pay your ties
[56:49] you attend to church you know you've got
[56:51] all these things I mean don't you
[56:53] realize you don't even really need to do
[56:54] that anymore you know wives are
[56:56] independent they don't really need to be
[56:58] under subjection to their husbands
[57:00] anymore and and you know and the world
[57:03] looks at you and says you know it's it's
[57:05] unreasonable I had a man attacked me
[57:07] terribly through an email doesn't even
[57:10] know me and and just just you know
[57:13] waylaid the whole notion of a woman
[57:18] being in the modern 21st century that a
[57:20] woman is in subjection to her husband
[57:23] said I should be investigated what he
[57:28] said I said she fell hit her brother a
[57:32] man I was gonna have a errand ride him
[57:33] back and blow him up I don't know if he
[57:37] did or not he certainly can but I
[57:38] decided just to not respond to him at
[57:41] least at this as far as tonight is
[57:43] concerned so to this point today I
[57:50] haven't responded but but you know it's
[57:54] it's it's just it's so so we have a
[57:57] whole different reasonable than usual
[58:00] the world would hold you in contempt for
[58:03] many of your actions but God will love
[58:07] you for what the world holds you in
[58:09] contempt how upside down is that how far
[58:12] away is the world's thinking if they
[58:15] literally think about this friends they
[58:18] came at Jesus who was the most perfect
[58:22] human being ever to exist brother Luther
[58:25] don't bring me some water please think
[58:27] Bradley forgot me amen and I just bring
[58:30] me a bottled water right quick really
[58:32] the run jump flip hurry amen
[58:34] and so you know the the the whole idea
[58:39] of what we would classify and they take
[58:43] Jesus if you think you stand a chance
[58:47] come on they took the most perfect human
[58:51] to ever live who had zero Kyle was
[58:59] always totally honest thought none wrong
[59:05] spoke none wrong did nothing wrong
[59:08] loved even his enemies preached and
[59:14] observed and lived a life that did good
[59:17] to those who were plotting to murder him
[59:21] hung on a cross
[59:23] with full authority to condemn them to
[59:29] hell by a word thank you sir
[59:32] they're faint hung in his mouth all he
[59:38] had to do was say father condemned them
[59:41] for they have killed me without cause
[59:43] but what did he actually say Father
[59:46] forgive them now if they if they thought
[59:53] they called him mad crazy accuse him of
[59:57] having a devil in fact his accused him
[1:00:00] of being the chief of Devils you're not
[1:00:04] gonna get worse miscalculation you're
[1:00:08] not gonna get a worse judgment then
[1:00:10] third judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:13] so so now then then then you have to ask
[1:00:17] yourself a question I'm just talking
[1:00:19] about in simple human terms if they did
[1:00:23] that to the most flawless perfect
[1:00:26] perfect flawless divine man to ever live
[1:00:30] then how do you imagine that they're
[1:00:34] going to be able to make right decisions
[1:00:36] according to God's principles and if
[1:00:39] that's true and you can and you are here
[1:00:42] with me tonight and you're determining
[1:00:43] there's no way what they
[1:00:45] reasonable they they thought Jesus was
[1:00:48] unreasonable he was the most reasonable
[1:00:50] man ever to live so if that's the way
[1:00:54] they assess life why would you trust
[1:00:57] them and follow mankind why would you
[1:01:00] follow humanistic thinking for even a
[1:01:03] second why would you not rather say to
[1:01:07] yourself self you know nothing and he
[1:01:10] knows everything and my determination is
[1:01:13] to know nothing save him and him
[1:01:16] crucified and you know and if he had to
[1:01:20] get crude if he had a Calvary
[1:01:22] I got a Calvary coming I'm aware I'm
[1:01:25] willing I want to raise with him then I
[1:01:28] gotta be willing to die with him I gotta
[1:01:30] be willing to suffer with him and that's
[1:01:32] not usual that's not reasonable the
[1:01:34] world says that's nuts don't do that you
[1:01:36] don't have to do that it's the reason I
[1:01:39] do it is cause I don't have to the whole
[1:01:41] reason I do it is because I want to be
[1:01:44] like him
[1:01:45] and I want to endure whatever he endured
[1:01:48] and make every decision he made I
[1:01:50] already don't always and I'm already in
[1:01:53] enough agony for when I don't I'm sure
[1:01:55] not gonna knock on purpose I'm gonna try
[1:01:59] every day I'm gonna renew my mind I'm
[1:02:02] gonna be renewed in my mind every day so
[1:02:05] that I can prove what is that good and
[1:02:07] perfect will of God that which is
[1:02:10] acceptable to God I don't care what's
[1:02:13] acceptable to mankind not here to
[1:02:16] impress him not here to you know impress
[1:02:21] mankind I'm here to impress God I don't
[1:02:28] need the plaudits of the world I just
[1:02:31] want to hear the maker of the world say
[1:02:33] well done enter into the joys I've
[1:02:37] prepared for you before the foundation
[1:02:39] of the world so you know I would say
[1:02:45] that what you would call reasonable or
[1:02:50] usual I would say it depends on what
[1:02:53] kingdom you come from I think that
[1:02:55] dictates your definition of
[1:02:57] aníbal and usual you know when we look
[1:03:02] at the world we can see what humanism
[1:03:04] where man puts human hitman pit man has
[1:03:08] voted that mankind is the highest order
[1:03:11] that's convenient voted yourself into
[1:03:14] the Supremes 5 ok well can you keep the
[1:03:19] breath in your lungs ok can you control
[1:03:24] that ok can you guarantee me that you'll
[1:03:28] be alive tomorrow can you guarantee me
[1:03:31] you'll make it home tonight can you
[1:03:33] guarantee me you won't fall over in the
[1:03:35] next 28 seconds
[1:03:37] so then why you know I say to these
[1:03:40] humanists then why would I trust you
[1:03:43] you voted yourself as the as the chief
[1:03:46] being but you can't even keep yourself
[1:03:48] alive you can't bring yourself here keep
[1:03:51] yourself here or figure out or have any
[1:03:53] effect on where you're going afterwards
[1:03:55] that's all in the hands of your maker so
[1:03:59] excuse me if I just go step around you
[1:04:01] and just appeal to the make up a man so
[1:04:06] humanism has what it has done to
[1:04:09] Scripture ah you know to the to the
[1:04:13] principles in the estimation of man man
[1:04:16] has estimated that God's Word has very
[1:04:19] little value now you can see that in the
[1:04:21] world and I'm not really here tonight I
[1:04:24] I don't want to keep seeming like I'm
[1:04:28] just it's it's God's family vs. the
[1:04:31] world because I'm really trying to zero
[1:04:33] in a little closer tonight I really
[1:04:36] wanted to say look it's a no-brainer so
[1:04:40] far what I've preached to Christians is
[1:04:43] a no-brainer because of course we're
[1:04:45] going to believe him and of course we
[1:04:47] thank him and of course we don't trust
[1:04:49] mankind but but you know now let's come
[1:04:52] down into the family of God and let's
[1:04:54] say okay now now our controlled study
[1:04:57] now now we've got everybody that's
[1:04:59] believers alright now consider as a
[1:05:02] Christian are you surrendering your life
[1:05:05] as a sacrifice are you on a daily basis
[1:05:11] living and making decisions based on his
[1:05:14] principles for a happy healthy life a
[1:05:17] happy healthy home a happy healthy
[1:05:19] marriage happy healthy children happy
[1:05:22] healthy finances happy healthy churches
[1:05:23] happy ha you know I mean are you
[1:05:26] considering that God has a an exact plan
[1:05:30] for all of that or are you winging it
[1:05:34] and flying by the seat of your pants and
[1:05:36] just trying to go your own way I can
[1:05:39] tell you friends that you are in for one
[1:05:41] calamity followed by another which are
[1:05:46] followed by another and then another
[1:05:47] still because now we're talking about
[1:05:52] God lining up his family for a final
[1:05:54] flight a family that he can't lose and
[1:05:58] he won't sacrifice and so he's going to
[1:06:02] get you you know you're going to have to
[1:06:06] get certified your pilot's skills are
[1:06:09] going to have to be able to be certified
[1:06:11] because God's planning a trip out of
[1:06:14] here so you know when we when we think
[1:06:18] about what God has done in the world and
[1:06:23] I I think about you know Christ when he
[1:06:28] you know in his first coming or actually
[1:06:32] you know we could break it down and talk
[1:06:34] about all three Exodus the first exodus
[1:06:37] of Israel out of Egypt then Christ the
[1:06:40] second Exodus when he took the Old
[1:06:42] Testament Saints to glory resurrect to
[1:06:43] the mountain of graves of many which set
[1:06:45] saints which slept arose and then
[1:06:48] there's the last Exodus and so you you
[1:06:51] know that second Exodus is the first
[1:06:53] advent of Christ of God in human form as
[1:06:55] a man to pay redemptions price and now
[1:06:58] he's coming again this is the second
[1:07:02] coming of Christ and it will be the
[1:07:04] third Exodus for the bride you with me
[1:07:06] and we see the exact same patterns
[1:07:11] repeating in all three cases now when I
[1:07:14] see that I have to conclude its God
[1:07:19] doing it if we look at the first Exodus
[1:07:24] ah you know there there was a pressure
[1:07:28] upon the children of Israel and you know
[1:07:33] Israel Israel had a number of commands
[1:07:36] upon them you know there were they were
[1:07:40] to eat certain foods and not eat other
[1:07:44] foods they were to wear certain garments
[1:07:48] and not wear other garments their church
[1:07:51] services now here's an interesting one
[1:07:53] because their church services like if
[1:07:56] you take with Moab and brother branham
[1:07:58] talks about bail on that false prophet
[1:08:00] and you know Israel you know they have
[1:08:02] their altar and moth has their altar and
[1:08:04] they have the lamb they have a lamb they
[1:08:07] have seven on they have seven you
[1:08:09] understand they've even got a prophet
[1:08:11] they've even got a prophet and God
[1:08:12] speaks to both of them they believe in
[1:08:16] Jehovah they believe in Jehovah they're
[1:08:17] descendants of Abraham they're
[1:08:19] descendants of Abraham through through
[1:08:21] lot and so we find that that it was it
[1:08:27] was what the one thing that separated
[1:08:29] them was their hearts response to God's
[1:08:34] principles and what God taught in the
[1:08:37] Bible because you know they were Israel
[1:08:41] was very different than the Canaanites
[1:08:43] who lived around them they ate different
[1:08:46] foods they wore different clothing they
[1:08:48] worshiped on different in different ways
[1:08:50] and so when it comes to the world
[1:08:53] they were vastly different God's family
[1:08:56] has always been vastly different
[1:09:00] whenever God's chosen children of Israel
[1:09:04] conducted themselves in manners and ways
[1:09:08] that were like ah the Canaanites around
[1:09:11] them or the Egyptians when they were in
[1:09:12] captivity there was always a penalty
[1:09:15] always a price to be paid it's the same
[1:09:18] today I see people who I have every
[1:09:21] confidence they are God's family I have
[1:09:23] every confidence but I also know when I
[1:09:26] see them you know when I see the rod of
[1:09:28] Correction coming I know who's doing it
[1:09:31] and people say oh you know God you know
[1:09:35] pastor
[1:09:36] pray pray help me know I've done all
[1:09:38] these calamities got all these problems
[1:09:40] and here the whole time I'm knowing I'm
[1:09:42] seeing because I've been watching and
[1:09:44] I'm seeing so how what is it you think I
[1:09:47] can do you think I my prayers gonna stop
[1:09:50] him I'm happy to pray if the Devils
[1:09:53] attacking you but I'm here to taste some
[1:09:56] friends if the Lord's attacking you
[1:09:57] there's nothing I can do for you he sent
[1:10:01] His Word and healed you so go to his
[1:10:03] word you need healing and it's God doing
[1:10:05] it go to his word
[1:10:06] you need deliverance go to his word you
[1:10:09] need help you go to his word you got a
[1:10:11] problem you're upside down you're in a
[1:10:13] calamity go to his word there's nothing
[1:10:16] I can I can pray for you I'm happy to
[1:10:17] pray for you but my prayer is Lord
[1:10:19] humble that person until they say a man
[1:10:22] who every word see so so you know they
[1:10:29] they had to go through these things and
[1:10:32] you know Israel's practical lifestyle
[1:10:38] you know it was it was not to be like
[1:10:41] the world it wasn't supposed to be
[1:10:43] anyway and so so when we find that their
[1:10:46] standards are reasonable unusual are
[1:10:50] vastly different and when and when God
[1:10:52] looks at that that whole situation of
[1:10:55] the Feast of bel pure I mean really
[1:10:58] it looked so similar it does look like
[1:11:00] to church services very similar just
[1:11:03] like today you could go to a church
[1:11:04] service where they read this exact same
[1:11:06] Bible they sing the very same songs they
[1:11:10] raise their hand it's like you do and in
[1:11:12] many cases cry authentic tears like you
[1:11:16] do feel joy and elation like you do and
[1:11:19] and in no way to know no way to know had
[1:11:25] it not been for prophet who could come
[1:11:27] back into the instrument panel and say
[1:11:30] they're actually worshipping the devil
[1:11:33] and don't know it
[1:11:35] and the undie and they say well what is
[1:11:39] at the heart of this thing but at the
[1:11:41] heart of it it's a good way to ask it
[1:11:44] because at the heart of it was the heart
[1:11:46] of them and there
[1:11:48] heart response to the Word of God and so
[1:11:52] you say well that doesn't seem like that
[1:11:55] big of a deal God looks at your heart in
[1:11:59] such a way that you know it wasn't that
[1:12:03] the action was all that different
[1:12:04] wasn't that the church services role
[1:12:07] that different but this church over here
[1:12:09] in Moab had a different a different
[1:12:11] heart response to God's Word and when
[1:12:16] God's family went in that direction God
[1:12:19] began to destroy them and they it
[1:12:22] actually became unpardonable it wasn't
[1:12:25] that their actions were all that
[1:12:26] different it was that their heart would
[1:12:29] not allow God to be the Lord and in
[1:12:32] their heart and I have seen sadly sadly
[1:12:37] children of God made that same mistake
[1:12:40] and get thinking like the world and
[1:12:43] become reasonable and usual you know I
[1:12:47] have to ask this question so here we've
[1:12:53] been you know for the last what I don't
[1:12:56] know eight ten weeks you know in a
[1:12:59] situation that's totally totally
[1:13:03] unprecedented this has never happened in
[1:13:06] the message never since the days of
[1:13:08] brother Branham never not in America
[1:13:10] anyway we're we're believers have been
[1:13:12] told you know you need to stay home you
[1:13:14] can't even come to church and we've had
[1:13:17] to go you know with just a little they
[1:13:19] allowed us ten people as long as
[1:13:20] everybody followed protocols will well
[1:13:22] you know just what it's trying to you
[1:13:24] know keep in a key keeping it'll barely
[1:13:26] possible and even they've been arresting
[1:13:29] pastors and writing tickets and people
[1:13:31] even you know and he it's it's gotten to
[1:13:33] the point where the Attorney General of
[1:13:35] the United States it's actually taking
[1:13:38] his valuable time to write memorandums
[1:13:42] to the governors to say listen what
[1:13:45] you're doing is starting to encroach
[1:13:47] upon constitutional freedoms so now this
[1:13:51] ain't this ain't you know you know
[1:13:53] somebody some no-name john doe over here
[1:13:55] writing an article thinking you know
[1:13:57] ranting and raving standing out in his
[1:13:59] yard screaming waving a flag going
[1:14:01] fringing on their rights this is the top
[1:14:03] law man in the United States the
[1:14:05] Attorney General the AG of the nation
[1:14:08] he's the top law man and he is warning
[1:14:12] to say you need to be careful and and
[1:14:15] and further I want to know why is it
[1:14:17] that churches and religious services
[1:14:19] aren't considered essential and and let
[1:14:23] me tell you something friends you know
[1:14:24] you you say well come on we've had to
[1:14:28] we've had to be careful and yeah I get
[1:14:30] it the safety and we you know it's a
[1:14:32] pandemic so it's reasonable I get it
[1:14:34] we've been following it but don't think
[1:14:36] for one minute that men with devious
[1:14:39] minds I'm not saying they're all got
[1:14:41] devious minds but I'm saying there are
[1:14:43] devious men with hidden agendas who are
[1:14:45] going Wow look what we were able to do
[1:14:51] don't be naive friends we're currently
[1:14:56] we got a president that seems to be
[1:14:57] sticking up for us and an AG that seems
[1:14:59] to be sitting up force that could change
[1:15:01] in an election I'm not here to put put
[1:15:04] fear I'm here to stay I'm here to tell
[1:15:06] you you better sharpen up your
[1:15:07] instrument panel because I don't know
[1:15:09] what's ahead of us we're in an
[1:15:11] unprecedented hour we're in a moment
[1:15:13] we've never had to face these things for
[1:15:15] but I know there are principles in God's
[1:15:17] Word and I intend to follow them I
[1:15:24] intend to follow them when we look at
[1:15:33] thee and I'm gonna come to a close and
[1:15:35] I'ma take the last 15 minutes when you
[1:15:38] come to Israel and they're coming to
[1:15:41] their partner they're in the approaching
[1:15:43] stages of their Exodus things begin to
[1:15:47] gel quickly they'd went for decades
[1:15:51] decades had turned into centuries one
[1:15:56] century became two became three became
[1:15:58] four and now they're still got decades
[1:16:02] which didn't seem to be in the original
[1:16:04] plan where this extra thirty years come
[1:16:07] from because God said 400 now we're at
[1:16:09] four thirty and we're still here but we
[1:16:12] heard there's a prophet
[1:16:14] you see and God begins to move and now
[1:16:17] now a prophet comes in he's got a
[1:16:19] message of Exodus and there's a people
[1:16:21] that begin to rally and then you've got
[1:16:22] a government starting to notice and it's
[1:16:25] down here for eats conspiracy I'm just
[1:16:27] telling you these are Bible patterns and
[1:16:29] then you you find that pressure starts
[1:16:32] and Israel's trying to leave but now
[1:16:35] there's pressure from the powers that be
[1:16:37] there's religious pressure and and the
[1:16:40] the if you know anything about that that
[1:16:42] that time period that era in Egypt so
[1:16:45] you know the Pharaoh was was like the
[1:16:48] son of God so you had search and state
[1:16:50] perfectly married and so now you've got
[1:16:53] this ecclesiastical and this political
[1:16:55] and this demon power which brother him
[1:16:58] said it's that tri-unity of political
[1:17:00] religious and demon power so then now
[1:17:04] you you come and they start to bring all
[1:17:06] this pressure and you know the story I'm
[1:17:07] not going to spend a lot of time in that
[1:17:09] first Exodus we've we've studied it
[1:17:11] since the days of childhood and Sunday
[1:17:13] school but you know but I just want to
[1:17:16] make this one point every pressure that
[1:17:21] they encountered was needed because they
[1:17:27] they they weren't going to a picnic
[1:17:29] they're headed to a wilderness journey
[1:17:31] they're headed to they're gonna have to
[1:17:33] fight and take over lands and have
[1:17:35] figure out how to form an army they're
[1:17:38] gonna have to learn to follow water
[1:17:39] they're gonna have to you know there's a
[1:17:41] lot ahead of them and so God in those
[1:17:45] final moments those final days God is
[1:17:48] allowing this kind of pressure to come
[1:17:50] upon them and you know the one thing
[1:17:53] that you don't see Moses doing was you
[1:17:57] know adjusting the life away from God's
[1:18:01] principles to to kind of ease the
[1:18:04] pressure a little bit actually Moses
[1:18:07] begins to do things that increase the
[1:18:09] pressure upon because he's following the
[1:18:12] principles of what God had told him now
[1:18:15] you come to Jesus day you see all these
[1:18:19] characters now begin to begin to jump up
[1:18:22] you you know my mind I thought about you
[1:18:25] know here you've got you've got
[1:18:27] Israel under under Roman control and now
[1:18:32] you know and by and and now you you know
[1:18:35] you've got a you've got a Caesar and you
[1:18:38] know and and the days of the Republic
[1:18:40] are long ago gone hundreds of years gone
[1:18:42] and and you know and and and now it's an
[1:18:45] imperial government and it's and it's
[1:18:48] church and state United and you've got
[1:18:50] all these laws and they don't care about
[1:18:51] the Jews God they don't care about any
[1:18:53] the Jewish God they don't know they
[1:18:55] don't recognize them at all look at all
[1:18:56] these stipulations and they're starting
[1:18:58] to clamp down on Jewish worship and
[1:19:00] clamp down on Jewish lifestyle and
[1:19:02] you've got God's family right there in
[1:19:04] the middle of it you suddenly suddenly
[1:19:07] you've got Joseph and Mary having to
[1:19:09] make a ridiculous arduous trip over many
[1:19:12] days and travel and married pregnant all
[1:19:15] about taxes and and and they can't even
[1:19:17] get a motel and and I mean you know
[1:19:19] you've got you've got you've got
[1:19:21] Zacharias and John's coming and he
[1:19:23] disbelieves and he's got a penalty and
[1:19:25] now he can't speak you got all this
[1:19:26] pressure you got you got blind Anna
[1:19:28] who's you know going around can't see
[1:19:31] God's not healing her you got her going
[1:19:34] around God's got a purpose that in her
[1:19:36] blindness the Holy Spirit can lead her
[1:19:38] right to the child you understand you
[1:19:41] you you you you've got you know you got
[1:19:43] Simeon old and broken-down and shuffling
[1:19:46] along and you think he could just go on
[1:19:48] to his reward but he wanted to see
[1:19:50] Messiah and every day was a hardship and
[1:19:55] every day wasn't endurance but every day
[1:19:57] he was faithful every day as it got
[1:20:00] harder and harder and Joseph kept going
[1:20:02] and Mary kept going and then nine months
[1:20:04] all the persecutions she suffered I'm
[1:20:06] here to taste something when Christ was
[1:20:08] coming in his first Advent it wasn't a
[1:20:10] better roses for his family and you had
[1:20:14] people who were you know kind of over
[1:20:16] here trying to ride the fence and and
[1:20:18] and and and if I could if I couldn't you
[1:20:21] know move the turn lukewarm into that
[1:20:23] era to say you got you got you know
[1:20:25] lukewarm Jews who looking for a messiah
[1:20:28] but they won't come right out a 10-9 and
[1:20:30] take a stand and they go to him in the
[1:20:32] middle of the night I mean you got all
[1:20:33] this
[1:20:34] Street that's playing out and you're
[1:20:35] seeing it again in this hour you got
[1:20:38] people who ought to be taking a stand
[1:20:40] for God's worth afraid to do it you got
[1:20:43] people who are who are compromising you
[1:20:45] know you've got Matthew who was it was a
[1:20:48] tax collector and cheating people Zack
[1:20:50] he is cheating people and tax collection
[1:20:53] and and God's going to get ahold of
[1:20:55] their life and turn their lives around
[1:20:56] you know and and and you got you've got
[1:20:58] you know believers make believers and
[1:21:00] unbelievers their life then wasn't much
[1:21:02] different than there was a reasonable
[1:21:04] and usual then and they were also called
[1:21:06] crazy and you've got all this suffering
[1:21:11] and then you've got a king trying to
[1:21:13] kill the child and Joseph's got to flee
[1:21:15] to Egypt and I mean that looks
[1:21:17] counterintuitive brother Bram said
[1:21:20] anytime a Jew leaves the Promised Land
[1:21:22] he's back slid but God sitting there
[1:21:24] just like God sent David into the
[1:21:27] Philistines to save his life we don't
[1:21:29] always understand why this is happening
[1:21:31] like that but I'm here to tell you David
[1:21:34] Koepp trusting the word I'm an Italian
[1:21:36] Joseph kept trusting the word Mary kept
[1:21:39] believing the word it didn't all make
[1:21:41] sense to her it didn't make sense to
[1:21:45] everybody but they knew it promised
[1:21:47] he'll be here and they begin to see
[1:21:49] signs of it and they begin to say I'm a
[1:21:51] believer I'm a follower they didn't
[1:21:57] always have a God didn't send him down a
[1:21:59] PDF every day of their marching orders
[1:22:01] sometimes they had to just walk by faith
[1:22:05] this was real life happening in real
[1:22:08] time in HD
[1:22:09] just back then just like it is now
[1:22:12] Christ goes off the scene he ascends he
[1:22:15] sends back his life into the church and
[1:22:17] now you've got a you got it you got a a
[1:22:20] bunch of mechanic field cowards
[1:22:23] sheltering in place
[1:22:29] working from home all of them gathered
[1:22:32] in an upper room afraid fear until the
[1:22:37] Holy Ghost came and they came out of
[1:22:41] that shelter I'm gonna take some friends
[1:22:42] what you know that shelter in place
[1:22:44] ended up being for their good because
[1:22:46] over that time where they were having
[1:22:48] the shelter in place they were looking
[1:22:51] at the scriptures they were considering
[1:22:53] the prophecies they knew what Jesus had
[1:22:55] told them I wonder what we have done
[1:22:57] with our shelter in place time I wonder
[1:23:01] if you know maybe you're out there
[1:23:03] tonight and and maybe you and I and I
[1:23:06] don't want to get going down this road
[1:23:07] but maybe you know you should have been
[1:23:10] here in service tonight but you've
[1:23:11] become reasonable and usual and you're
[1:23:13] thinking and now you're yeah you're
[1:23:16] suddenly the Bible is said gather the
[1:23:18] more so as you see the Day approaching
[1:23:20] Gavin you're gonna need it you're gonna
[1:23:22] need the strength you're gonna need the
[1:23:24] we're gonna need the strength you give
[1:23:26] you're gonna need the strength weaken
[1:23:27] you're gonna need washed by the water of
[1:23:30] the word you're gonna need a live
[1:23:31] ministry you can't just stay home and
[1:23:34] play tapes and think you'll be okay
[1:23:35] that's not the principle he ascended on
[1:23:39] high and gave gifts unto men and brother
[1:23:42] branham said you have to be in a local
[1:23:44] church and support a ministry and go
[1:23:46] there and get washed in the water but
[1:23:49] some people and over these eight or ten
[1:23:51] weeks I'm afraid have become reasonable
[1:23:53] and usual by the world standards and
[1:23:56] it's even less important than it was
[1:23:58] before and they've actually went
[1:24:00] backwards I'm here to take something
[1:24:01] friends I'm not here to tell you that
[1:24:03] I'm emerging as a super-duper Christian
[1:24:05] but I know this I've tried to take my
[1:24:07] time let's say Lord let me draw closer
[1:24:13] and you don't want to avoid the pressure
[1:24:24] you don't want to avoid that because you
[1:24:28] know you need the struggle
[1:24:31] that's a principle of the kingdom of God
[1:24:33] I get it in this rat race of the world
[1:24:37] it's a struggle to come to church in the
[1:24:40] middle of the week you need the struggle
[1:24:43] it's a it's a struggle to stand separate
[1:24:47] from the world sometimes it'll hurt your
[1:24:49] business to do it sometimes you'll get
[1:24:52] ridiculed sometimes family will will
[1:24:55] hold you in derision and and sometimes
[1:24:57] that the public will sneer you and you
[1:25:00] don't like that and so what you'll do is
[1:25:03] you'll become a little more usual you
[1:25:06] become a little more reasonable and we
[1:25:08] we all agreed here tonight at the
[1:25:10] beginning of this sermon that our level
[1:25:12] of reasonable and usual ought not to be
[1:25:14] the same as the world taste something
[1:25:18] friends they came out of that effort
[1:25:20] room I'm here to tell you they're
[1:25:22] sheltering in place had a benefit they
[1:25:24] came out of there on fire they came out
[1:25:27] of there winning souls they came
[1:25:29] baptizing people they filled up the
[1:25:31] Church of God has God added daily ain't
[1:25:33] it signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:25:35] shut the whole countryside Oh would the
[1:25:38] God while the world is shaking in fear
[1:25:40] and uncertainty that there'd be a people
[1:25:42] on the earth to say I am facing this
[1:25:45] challenge of the hour and I'm ready to
[1:25:48] see God come on the scene I'm gonna
[1:25:50] prove in my life what is that God and
[1:25:52] perfect will of Almighty God and God
[1:25:56] will honor it and God will vindicate it
[1:26:00] I'm here to tell you something this word
[1:26:02] will speak you haven't believed
[1:26:05] cunningly devised tales you're believing
[1:26:07] the body where you're feeding on the
[1:26:09] body part of the Son of Man and it will
[1:26:12] speak it will testify you don't have to
[1:26:16] be afraid
[1:26:18] you just have to decide what you want we
[1:26:25] love going into x4 and reading about how
[1:26:28] that that they come in there and they
[1:26:30] get down to pray oh god do great signs
[1:26:34] and wonders by the name of thy Holy
[1:26:35] Child Jesus and here it comes again
[1:26:37] rushing wind shakes the building the
[1:26:40] Holy Ghost pours out again
[1:26:42] fiery baptism and everybody's rejoicing
[1:26:45] do you know what you know what brought
[1:26:47] that once before that Peter and John are
[1:26:51] being locked up and threatened and
[1:26:53] harassed and whipped on and and they you
[1:26:57] don't hear to tell you they needed that
[1:26:59] struggle don't try to protect yourself
[1:27:03] put your hands in the hand of God and
[1:27:06] let God direct your life march forward
[1:27:10] design it's a beautiful Zion not here to
[1:27:13] become reasonable and usual I'm here to
[1:27:18] be on fire I'm here to serve God with
[1:27:20] fervency I'm here at the 3rd Exodus this
[1:27:24] is for real this ain't a story of pipe
[1:27:27] dream Disney show this is for real we
[1:27:31] are getting out of here and I don't know
[1:27:34] what tomorrow holds but I know who holds
[1:27:36] it hallelujah
[1:27:38] III don't know what the plan is but I
[1:27:40] know there's a plan I don't I don't I
[1:27:44] already know I can't control it but I
[1:27:46] know somebody who can so I'm sticking
[1:27:47] with him I'm not interested in coming
[1:27:54] I'm not interested in coming to the end
[1:27:57] of this shelter-in-place order only to
[1:28:01] find myself more reasonable and usual
[1:28:07] that's not what happened and it in Egypt
[1:28:11] that's not what happened in the upper
[1:28:14] room that's not what is happening that's
[1:28:18] not the group that's leaving here I'm
[1:28:21] gonna take something friends you need
[1:28:23] the struggle don't fear the struggle I
[1:28:26] speaking to a a really wonderful sister
[1:28:29] today a very good friend and we were
[1:28:31] talking about that very thing and I said
[1:28:33] just to remember we need this struggle
[1:28:34] you know just encouraging her don't fear
[1:28:37] it we need it it's good for us you gotta
[1:28:39] press it yeah you must I you know do I
[1:28:42] you know get a flower bed of ease as
[1:28:44] brother Brandon would sing while others
[1:28:46] fall to win the prize and sail through
[1:28:48] bloody sees no way friends I don't I
[1:28:51] don't wanna I don't wanna you know float
[1:28:53] on a flower bed across the finish line I
[1:28:56] want to run when I cross that line I
[1:28:59] want to have a sword in my hand and a
[1:29:01] shield on the other one and I want to
[1:29:03] have some battle marks on my armor that
[1:29:05] I fought to get here hallelujah not here
[1:29:09] to compromise I'm not here to become
[1:29:11] usual don't be usual Christian
[1:29:15] they follow the Holy Ghost be full of
[1:29:18] the word trust in the principles of
[1:29:20] God's Word
[1:29:21] let them govern your life stop
[1:29:23] preventing them from governing your life
[1:29:25] because you can don't do that
[1:29:29] surrender humble as these opens the
[1:29:32] verse I beseech you therefore brethren
[1:29:36] therefore having said everything I just
[1:29:38] said about the salvation in Christ the
[1:29:41] mercy of God now that you know that I
[1:29:44] beg you I urge you I I compel you
[1:29:49] therefore in light of everything I've
[1:29:52] taught you by the mercies of God that
[1:29:54] you present yourselves don't wait for
[1:30:01] God to always have to knock you in the
[1:30:03] head I've have had to learn so many
[1:30:07] lessons like that I know so many times I
[1:30:10] prayed Lord show me your will don't let
[1:30:12] me have to miss it and get up get
[1:30:15] cracked in the head I know it'll be for
[1:30:17] my good but it hurts I don't like it I'd
[1:30:18] rather just figure out what your will is
[1:30:20] and just let me do it
[1:30:22] and if you'll just show me what it is
[1:30:24] I'm gonna do it before I know what it is
[1:30:25] I'm gonna tell you something friends you
[1:30:27] make that kind of commitment to God you
[1:30:28] get his attention and God will do things
[1:30:31] for you in such a miraculous way I urge
[1:30:34] you to present your bodies a living
[1:30:36] sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[1:30:40] it's your reasonable not worldly
[1:30:44] reasonable not humanism reasonable not
[1:30:49] usual but it is your reasonable by God's
[1:30:53] standard this is your reasonable service
[1:30:56] I love him don't you you know you you
[1:31:05] you you you you have these health
[1:31:08] benefits that we can gain in the Word of
[1:31:12] God if we'll follow it the Word of God
[1:31:16] is health to all your flesh it's
[1:31:22] got--it's it's to the point now you know
[1:31:25] and I'll make this last point and close
[1:31:28] because on my mind to make it you know
[1:31:32] there are things that seem
[1:31:34] counterintuitive that that can actually
[1:31:36] be for your health for instance okay
[1:31:39] let's take the scripture assemble
[1:31:41] yourselves more well sometimes I get
[1:31:45] overloaded and worn out I've done it
[1:31:46] twice in over 25 years and I take a 30
[1:31:48] day break say wow aren't you violating
[1:31:51] the Bible
[1:31:52] you're like assembling less and brother
[1:31:54] Brandon would go into the wilderness so
[1:31:57] wilderness rest even though the
[1:32:00] principle it seems counterintuitive to
[1:32:02] the principle because you look at that
[1:32:04] and go but if the Bible says I should
[1:32:06] assemble more how could it possibly be
[1:32:08] helpful to go into the wilderness to
[1:32:11] rest and I'm away from church but
[1:32:13] actually it is and brother Branham had
[1:32:16] to do it and it was healthy then he
[1:32:19] could come back stronger but now after a
[1:32:23] while it stopped being healthy and it
[1:32:26] could start being hurtful what if
[1:32:29] brother Branham went out there for six
[1:32:31] months 10 months he tried to do that
[1:32:35] he tried to go out there for the rest of
[1:32:37] his life and God said go ahead you'll be
[1:32:41] like that bum you saw see so you go out
[1:32:44] there now I'm just showing you an
[1:32:45] example sometimes things can seem
[1:32:47] counterintuitive but it's actually can
[1:32:50] be for help
[1:32:51] fasting fasting is counterintuitive
[1:32:57] because you're supposed to eat to keep
[1:32:59] your life going if you stop eating you
[1:33:02] will die but if you fast for a certain
[1:33:06] amount of time it can actually have a
[1:33:08] health benefit but keep it up and it
[1:33:11] flips and it's no longer a health
[1:33:13] benefit you get me you know it's been
[1:33:17] healthy for us to shelter in place we've
[1:33:19] had an our global pandemic it's been
[1:33:21] healthy for our testimony it's been
[1:33:24] healthy for you to stay at home I hope
[1:33:25] you've been listening to tapes I hope a
[1:33:27] tape a day or keep the doctor away or in
[1:33:31] sister Debbie's case two or three tapes
[1:33:33] a day keep the doctor away every time I
[1:33:37] come in my house I have to wait and hold
[1:33:39] by the mute button if I walk in brother
[1:33:40] Ben's gonna be blasting all right I
[1:33:42] thought when I get out of sister James
[1:33:44] house as a child I get away from that I
[1:33:45] just married right into it and both of
[1:33:48] the important women in my life blast
[1:33:50] brother branham's tapes wide open you
[1:33:51] walk in the door you just get hit by it
[1:33:53] that's what I say praise the Lord Amen
[1:33:56] hallelujah and it's like brother Dale
[1:33:59] was saying one time was talking about
[1:34:00] the scripture you know I've bought a
[1:34:02] piece of land and I pray have me excused
[1:34:04] by there and was talking about this
[1:34:05] Sunday I've married you know I bought a
[1:34:08] yoke of oxen I go to prove it please
[1:34:09] have me excused another one said I've
[1:34:11] married a wife and I can't come and
[1:34:13] brother Dale we're right in the middle
[1:34:15] of us serious spiritual conversation I'm
[1:34:17] almost in tears and anointed and brother
[1:34:19] Dale just jumps in huh I'm married wife
[1:34:21] and she makes me come and he has four
[1:34:30] years given sister Joanne the credit for
[1:34:32] the spirituality and I I agree with him
[1:34:34] a man a man I was a good friend so and
[1:34:40] he agrees with me he knows we got good
[1:34:42] girls that Lord knew what we needed and
[1:34:43] and but my point is so
[1:34:46] okay so it's been good for our testimony
[1:34:49] it's been healthy you've been listening
[1:34:52] to tapes I hope you've increased your
[1:34:54] prayer life I hope we needed to do it I
[1:34:58] know the Bible said a symbol more but we
[1:35:00] actually assembled not last we're simple
[1:35:02] zero ten of us a little skeleton crew
[1:35:06] enough brothers just to get a broadcast
[1:35:08] phone and the rest of you for a week
[1:35:10] stayed at home it seems counterintuitive
[1:35:12] but actually if you did it right you're
[1:35:15] healthier but keep it going it's not
[1:35:19] gonna be healthy keep it going so I'm
[1:35:23] listening to tapes that's not the
[1:35:25] primary way that God gave you to get
[1:35:27] perfected listening to tapes are an
[1:35:29] augmentation God sent a live ministry
[1:35:33] among us God sent a pastor to help you
[1:35:36] God sent evangelists and teachers God
[1:35:39] sent prophets God sent apostles God sent
[1:35:41] a prophet thank God cuz this pastor
[1:35:44] wouldn't have nothing to say if I didn't
[1:35:46] have a prophet to lean on I couldn't
[1:35:48] help you at all I wouldn't be able to
[1:35:50] give you any kind of advice I'm glad for
[1:35:52] thus saith the Lord I believe you should
[1:35:54] hear the synthoid every day multiple
[1:35:57] times a day it ought to be playing in
[1:35:59] your truck you're to be well something
[1:36:00] you you want to put something in your
[1:36:02] ears and word let it be the voice of
[1:36:04] God's prophet but don't imagine that can
[1:36:07] substitute for coming back to the house
[1:36:09] of God because you say well I've been
[1:36:11] doing good I'm flying a night yeah Kobe
[1:36:14] was flying until he wasn't here taste
[1:36:18] something friends the principle of God's
[1:36:20] Word is this as you see the Day
[1:36:22] approaching gather more you're gonna
[1:36:27] need it you're gonna need it you're
[1:36:32] gonna need it you do need it let's stand
[1:36:39] you know brother uh never brother Diggs
[1:36:42] was talking about that that some people
[1:36:47] have gotten so comfortable they may
[1:36:50] never come back to going to church again
[1:36:52] they may have convinced themselves
[1:36:54] erroneously I can just do this for now
[1:36:57] on I love it it's awesome we're we're
[1:36:59] more spiritual that could be true that
[1:37:01] could be true but it won't stay true
[1:37:04] it won't stay true you understand I'm
[1:37:08] not saying you're wrong if you think
[1:37:10] that you're more spiritual having eight
[1:37:13] weeks at home listening to tapes that
[1:37:15] that absolutely should be true but it
[1:37:18] won't stay true not in this day and time
[1:37:21] friends not in the 21st century not when
[1:37:23] they're not when it's Satan's Eden I'm
[1:37:26] gonna take something you need to be here
[1:37:28] in the presence of Almighty God we need
[1:37:30] to get on past this and let's get back
[1:37:32] to what God says as usual and reasonable
[1:37:36] amen praise the Lord I've got a couple
[1:37:38] of prayer requests let me because it's
[1:37:40] already well 22:9 let me read these for
[1:37:42] you and when we have Bradley sing and
[1:37:44] then we will love okay cooperate please
[1:37:51] all right
[1:37:54] let me get to my request list we on
[1:37:59] Wednesdays we've just been leaving
[1:38:01] leaving you where you are rather than
[1:38:04] gathering up here I think we did it one
[1:38:08] time when they're just a couple of
[1:38:09] brothers here but we'll leave you where
[1:38:10] you are right now distanced it's all
[1:38:12] about our testimony friends it's really
[1:38:15] worth that's really what it's about at
[1:38:17] this point
[1:38:20] okay so brother Luther I don't remember
[1:38:24] if we ever I'm gonna read it the one
[1:38:25] that you put in that last Wednesday that
[1:38:27] we missed brother Luther says a
[1:38:29] contractor that I interact with from
[1:38:31] work his wife Sherry Hightower
[1:38:33] Hightower's battling breast cancer and
[1:38:35] cancer growths in her spine and lung
[1:38:37] mine you know you think it's an accident
[1:38:41] that this man met brother Luther Jordan
[1:38:44] who just so happens to be a son of the
[1:38:47] king those things don't happen
[1:38:50] accidentally friends I'm here to believe
[1:38:52] that we can join brother Luther and God
[1:38:55] could go and have mercy on this woman
[1:38:56] and it could redound to God's glory and
[1:38:59] come back as a testimony we've seen it
[1:39:01] happen I'm gonna pray and believe it
[1:39:03] like that
[1:39:04] sister Elizabeth Johnson writes she'd
[1:39:07] had a car crash some years ago I think
[1:39:09] 30 years ago and it set up a situation
[1:39:12] in her knee she's having I have a knee
[1:39:15] replacement surgery scheduled for May 28
[1:39:19] so that's eight days from now there'd be
[1:39:22] like next Thursday right for May 28th
[1:39:25] please pray for me and the surgeon for
[1:39:29] successful surgery I need to make sure I
[1:39:32] leave that on there we'll catch it again
[1:39:33] such Elizabeth would catch that again
[1:39:35] also again next Wednesday because I
[1:39:37] think that'll be the day before you go
[1:39:39] and we'll pray for it tonight as well
[1:39:40] my sister-in-law Karen white says her
[1:39:44] son Brandon
[1:39:45] he ever wanted to meet a sweet boy who
[1:39:48] was Brandon and you know very much like
[1:39:52] my brother Nate you know troubles of
[1:39:55] life caught him he went off the rail and
[1:39:58] has had a hard life and a lot of drug
[1:40:00] and alcohol abuse and they took him to
[1:40:03] the doctor just the other night to the
[1:40:05] ER and I mean he was almost like he was
[1:40:07] going to die and so they are they they
[1:40:11] think maybe they thought he had a
[1:40:13] complete collapse in his liver and now
[1:40:15] they're looking at some other different
[1:40:17] things but he's been very sick but his
[1:40:20] mother who who her and her husband have
[1:40:23] recently within the last I would say two
[1:40:25] months maybe started streaming here and
[1:40:27] give their hearts to the Lord and are
[1:40:29] serving God watching listening right now
[1:40:31] in this service as we speak and say god
[1:40:34] bless her brother Greg and we prayed and
[1:40:38] she called and she was crying and I know
[1:40:41] though I know it broken a mother with a
[1:40:43] broken heart sound when I hear it and it
[1:40:45] was her it's her baby he's big strapping
[1:40:47] big as Gideon but it but here he was
[1:40:51] Brandon and he was on the edge and we
[1:40:56] were praying and overnight
[1:40:58] he made some improvement and today he's
[1:41:01] holding on but you know you can crash
[1:41:03] over the edge right quick when you're
[1:41:04] that when you're that unhealthy so she's
[1:41:06] asking us she talked to him about his
[1:41:08] soul Brandon give your heart to the Lord
[1:41:10] commit your life to Christ she didn't
[1:41:12] pull no punches I think thank God for a
[1:41:14] mom who just won't pull any punches and
[1:41:16] tell a son you better make your heart
[1:41:18] right in case this is it and so uh she
[1:41:23] says that he sounds a lot better but
[1:41:25] he's fighting a drug dealer
[1:41:27] so please please pray for God to take it
[1:41:31] away from him I assured her we would
[1:41:35] sister charity vassal was very sick
[1:41:38] today very sick was alarming the
