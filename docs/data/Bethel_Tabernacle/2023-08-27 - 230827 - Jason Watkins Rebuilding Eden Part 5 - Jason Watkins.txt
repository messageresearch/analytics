Travis's brother right that's what I thought okay that's Rhett happy to have him here amen praise the Lord all right Genesis chapter 4 and um we're going to just pick up couple of verses beginning let's well let's just read from verse one I think that'll be best and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep if you're ever discussing the original sin with someone you can point to that even Scholars and I have their notes personally well-respected Scholars point to this second verse and she again bear his brother and even they notice that it doesn't say she conceived again only that she bear again which brings the in all probability they were twins all right all right so just just a little FYI for you there verse 3 and in process of time came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto King why art thou Wrath means angry why is thy countenance Fallen he had an attitude if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou do us not well sin lieth at the door you're just not going to impugn God with unfairness because this is I want you to catch this is the son of his arch enemy yes God is so loving so kind so benevolent as brother Branham said that Fountain from eternity that flowed out of their the pureness of love the pureness of righteousness in its purest uncut form and that God so loved the world and does not even take pleasure in even the death of The Sinner and he wishes for all men to come that's the Bible as far as God's will is concerned he wants all men to be saved and he offers everyone a legitimate opportunity it he's so strong in that that he even tries to save the life of his arch enemy the enemy of all enemies who had rebelled and tried to stab him in the back take over his kingdom he's even trying to save his son so you're not going to impugn God with unfairness verse 7 again if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him in other words you can conquer him it'll be whatever you decide he's subject to you that's what he's saying see and unto thee shall be his desire he's subject to you and you can whoop him it's up to you all right all right let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning I thank you for your ready anointing that I already feel and you're already the teacher here this morning Lord we commit ourselves into your hands Lord per Lord you know father my heart is before you this morning in perfect discipline Lord I'm here to preach your word father and not take any thought of my own but be strictly an oracle of your anointing I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated foreign so you should have my um PowerPoint Josh and if you'll just put that title slide up for me it'll be wonderful and I'll take it from there I hope if my device works amen so I want you to notice these things as we just start reading our text you know here's a here's a really good point for Bible study all right there's a there's a way to study the Bible there's a there's a anytime you read it there's a blessing and when you're studying it there's good ways there's better ways and there's the best ways and I I have many years of studying it since a boy and one of the things that I realized very early on and I I've never and and this actually is part of the things I've learned over the years I've learned it again and again and again and never forget it and that is when Jesus said a couple of things he said that you know heavens and earth would pass away but not even a single punctuation of his word would ever pass away not even the not one word not even one punctuation not even a letter see and he used intentional Aramaic words to describe down to the smallest infinitesimal almost uh Point everything God has ever said can never be changed it cannot be countermanded it cannot be altered even God can't take it back or alter it or change it see so now we realize as the prophet has taught us God can do things that are not in his word he can do things outside of his word but what he can't do is violate anything in his word you see the difference he can do things he's Sovereign he can do things that are outside of what you have between these two leather covers but whatever's between these two leather covers he can't break it he can't annul it he can't do away with it he has to fulfill it and that's why brother random would say it very simply he said you know if you if you get a problem in your life anybody here ever had problems [Music] um and he said look here's a good piece of advice find you a character in the Bible who had that problem or something similar and observe what they did to get God's help and to get out of it and if you just do what they did God will have to operate with you the same way he did with them because he can't respect persons and he can't break his word see so he's even saying that to Cain look if you'll just do his Abel Abel has a revelation you notice you notice that when you take the analogy and let me just go real slow this morning because I've got to not lose you in the shuffle you remember how in the Bible when Moses came into Egypt and Moses had a sign and Janice and jambres copied it right and then Moses did a different sign in Janice and jambres copied it now they couldn't uh Brother Brad brother met somebody that screen is blinking on and off that's going to drive me nuts just turn it off if you can't eliminate that it's in it's in the device because it's not doing it here so there's something wrong with it just a loose connection perhaps so so he if but now there's a couple of differences first of all brother Madam said notice Moses did it first then they copied it so you have the original and then you have a copycat and you can't have a copycat without an original there's no way there can be a counterfeit American three dollar bill you can have Monopoly money or toy money that says that but there's no no no counterfeit U.S three dollar bill because there's never been a real one so a counterfeit has to be off of The Reel so when people say you know religion is fake and Christians are all Hypocrites well there's a ton of Truth in that except that you've got to differentiate between real Christians and impersonators of Christianity because you can't have an impersonation without an authentic so the very fact that you have a fake means you have to have a real whether you can identify who it is what it is how it works there has it has to exist you follow me you could actually make that into a mathematical equation you can actually Express that mathematically that's how scientists in physics they express which is my favorite science subject they express things in mathematical equations you can make anything turn anything into an equation and that's provable see so so it it strikes down the very idea that you know there there's got to everything is just fake and people can have that atheists often have that you know you can you can find these men these Talking Heads who are atheists and want the whole world to know it and you know one time I recently I listened to uh one by Dr Dawkins and I thought why would I listen to this to this Infidel but I I thought to myself I'm not afraid of a good question and I'd like to hear what his point is and and what boy would I have like a hundred questions for him he was so sure that there was no God but he spent an hour and a half telling just how unsure how everything got he was how everything got started and you don't know how many times they would ask him a question about creation he'd say well we don't know how that happened but we know it wasn't God so you know it wasn't God but you don't know how it happened and you can't explain it and and you know all he had was little pieces of empirical evidence but yet you know you could line up a Christian biologist right beside him and Christian biologists would just shoot his argument down and I've heard him do it I'm just glad I realized the world is full of impersonations of the real I just say Lord give me the real and let me be the real and whatever that costs me whatever I have to surrender whatever I have to lose whatever I have to give up let that mind which was in Christ be in me I would very much like to live forever but very much like what heaven is going to be and so you find that Moses comes first and brother Rand points that out he he came on the field with a sign in the hand administered to him by an Angel and immediately every church had their their man with oil in his hand and blood in his hand and this that and the other and you know the the man that had blood in his hand you know I don't even want to go there brother Branham interpreted that but I I don't want to get your mind sidetracked it's it's not pretty but we find that it in this case you can see that Cain comes first ahead of Abel but yet we know that Abel had a revelation Paul said that by faith Abel offered unto God so we know that the Apostle Paul teaches us that he had a revelation given to him by God that's what real faith is it's Jesus taught that you can't even have that you can't approach god well except through Christ and you can't know Christ except the spirit reveals him to you so you're locked out in every direction it's just the mercy of God friends oh we should just Rejoice today to say Lord Give Me Your Mercy I can't force you to save me but I'd very much like to be saved Hallelujah but you notice that he's only repeating the exact same pattern that Eve in her great error had done and that is she ran ahead of God she ran ahead of the revelation you see Satan offered her something she was already entitled to and would have come to but she brother I'm said she couldn't wait you can see that in the scripture you can read The Narrative she couldn't wait and she ran ahead and now you see that the product of her running ahead the product of her not following the word of God the line and Order of the word of God it's one thing to you memorize this whole book but if you don't get it lined up in your life and if your line doesn't operate in the line in order of it God's a god of order and he cannot get behind chaos that's why he wouldn't leave the Earth in chaos he was never going to leave it in chaos he was going to bring the chaos into order that's what the word is trying to do to your life today it's trying to take the chaos of sin that you were born in without hope without God but God rich and mercy is sending you his word to bring your life back into order so that you look like this that's the gospel that's what the Holy Ghost is given for you can't do it to yourself you'll get it wrong for sure you'll get it wrong just like Cain got it wrong he used all the common sense and reasoning he could and he got it wrong and it goes to show you that listen this is not in my notes can I toss it in without getting a brick thrown at me he learned a lesson that when parents get out of the line in order of God's word their offspring tend to follow that that's a Genesis principle can't go you can't get further back than that for Humanity so just just just put that in the back of your mind and ponder that God God grant that he will show you the deeper meanings of it on our last installment part four today's part five our last installment found us considering the story in Genesis we were considering the Genesis story of Abel son of Adam and we find him here in our opening text on the other side of the Fall after his family had been removed from the Garden of Eden and we find Abel longing for Redemption this is where this is where he this is why he's entitled for God to give him a revelation because you know the Bible makes that assurance that if you seek you'll find and speaking of God if you knock he will answer and Jesus gave a parable and said goodness gracious just an Earthly father with all kinds of flaws loves his children that if they ask him you know for bread and for fish he won't give them a stone and a snake he'll actually feed his children because he loves him and that's just human level imagine God who is that perfect fountain and there's something inside of Abel that we see him longing for Redemption and he moves by Revelation to bring a sacrificial animal that would be acceptable unto the Lord not just a sacrifice it happened because this had to be for Redemption it couldn't just be uh you know the the the the representation of his labors that's what Cain tried to bring Cain tried to bring the the crop of his labor I sowed and I tended and I farmed it and I grew it and here it is Lord and that's that's fine for certain offerings in the Old Testament but as we said here in the previous service that was not for Redemption because of what happened in the original sin you couldn't undo that with just works it had to be blood because of the kind of sin it was and so he we find him bringing not the not his not the uh reaping of his works but he brought to to God an innocent lamb and offered the life of that lamb on an altar and offered on a rock and that rock was Christ of course same Rock in the wilderness with Moses same Rock able Abel died on that rock which was Christ that's where I want to die oh my that's where Moses died Hallelujah whoever dies on that rock will live again Hallelujah and when you live again you'll never die again so it had to be a proper offering designed to appease the Judgment of the Lord even if only temporarily to try if possible to set things back in order between himself and his maker and we of course see his half-twin brother trying to impersonate this action through reasoning unwilling to come God's provided way his story would not end well once the Tree of Life as we've taught you in previous lessons once the Tree of Life had become sealed tree of life was Christ God Ran them out of the garden and guarded the way guarded the revelation with a flaming sword see Jesus was still swinging that sword still blocking the way when he was on Earth when he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man they're trying to know they're trying to figure out God through him and he's he's literally blocking them see and so so we find that he does the same thing today so once Humanity found itself living under this shroud of mystery once the Tree of Life once the Tree of Life was sealed then man a shroud as it were a curtain came down upon his mind to where brother Branham talks about how that Adam lost the very Consciousness that he had ever had that kind of power and the gardener ever had that kind of life there's a veil that he couldn't see through any longer and he lost the consciousness of it and now man would have to live under a shroud of mystery of of you say what's the what's the shroud of mystery brother Jason well the probably the greatest shroud it covers what is the real meaning of life it's the question that is plagued Humanity for Millennia what is the real meaning of life why am I here what's it all about people have sailed the seven seas trying to find that answer people have ended their life because they couldn't find that answer they couldn't find satisfaction in any in any Pursuit see Abel knew that some kind of paradise had been lost something that not even his parents could explain to him and and in our study in our last lesson we found also remember how we showed you that that since it was Adam who broke the world only the second Adam could repair it and we we found happily that that to be the case because we discovered that that neither Satan nor Eve could break it it was after Adam fell that nature everything under him fell see and Eve actually all the way up till Adam opened her eyes she thought she had done the right thing thought she had done a good thing people often think that before the New Birth I'm a good person I'm an honest person I pay my taxes I don't cheat on my relationship I'm I'm an honorable person I'm a good old boy I'm a fine person and yet the Bible says there's none good not one not even a single one the only good one is Christ when the when when the Rich Young Ruler came to Jesus good Master Jesus said just a second now let's see if you really believe that because there's none good but God so is that who you're saying I am come on with that revelation don't just walk up here and give me some courteous greeting uh you you need to you need to have an experience here see so you know we we Rejoice because we realize that if that's the case in Genesis then it's the same today that if Satan couldn't break it then he can't break it now and if Eve's failure couldn't collapse God's plan then then your failure can't collapse his plan now and whatever position he saw of me before the foundation of the world there's not enough Devils I can't make enough errors to to remove myself from the position that I had in Christ before the world existed before I ever got here and made those mistakes foreign it really isn't you know the craving of a born-again child of God for fortune and glory in this world it's just not the new birth takes the desire of sin the Bible says that that he that's born of God hath no more conscience of sin see it just simply means his desires have been changed he knows he Wars against the flesh that still makes mistakes thank God we have an Advocate Christ Jesus that I actually can't sin not the real me I'm talking about the other me not the one born of Ed and Gene Watkins he sins all the time he was born in sin but I found out there was another Jason Watkins down inside that had never and would never and could never disbelieve God's word because sin is unbelief not don't confuse sin with the attributes of sin smoking drinking cursing dressing immorally acting immorally that's not sin that's the attributes of sin that's the results you do those things because you've not been converted so they're they're intrinsic to you they're germane they're they're gnats that come natural because you've got to fall in nature you're not fighting the greatest battle ever fought your greatest battle is having to go to work and pay bills but when you become born again you enter a whole new warfare level now that now you've got Next Level Warfare going on because now you've got an Insight man at war with the outside man and the inside man is determined to win I am determined to win I am determined to make this flesh subject to the word of God and whatever I got to do whatever I have to surrender and give up I say Let It Be oh God so be it unto me Hallelujah I fight with a fury the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force when it comes to my new birth I am a violent man I am against the devil I hate him I condemn his works I condemn him on my behalf on your behalf he's a liar you don't have to be in prison to him thank God so it's it's not a craving there's no more craving for the fortune and glory of the world if it if it means if the price I have to pay for that is spirituality or being pleasing to God now if you're just a church member you'll never you'll never succeed at that you'll you'll just you know you can be justified you can be Sanctified brother Brown says you know what will sanctification do he says well it'll make you stop blind it'll make you join a church and it'll make you a good neighbor and there's there's virtue in that there's nothing to say evil against that but it's not the new birth the new birth is when you've had a nature change see the new birth is when a gene of God in you that was in you before in you from the day you were born that Gene comes to life and so when you're born again you're there really isn't a craving any longer that craving for fortune and Glory at the cost of my spirituality is done done with that been done with that don't know why I chased it so long can't imagine why I chased it like I did oh my we seek a city today I do have goals I I I do have plans I haven't just become so Heavenly minded that I'm no earthly good I'm still trying to get ahead I'm still trying to secure my family nothing wrong in that I'm still trying to uh to to achieve whatever I can but but worldly success is no longer my goal I just look at it as whatever is a necessity but but I do have goals and I and I do want to graduate from this life I want a city whose Builder and maker is God where righteousness is supreme which that which is right is a daily occurrence so if this craving for the world is now gone you know you you could ask yourself my goodness how did I how did I get that brother Branham runs ahead and asks that question for you boy it's it's so great to have a prophet ask this question because now I can get an authoritative answer I'm not probing anymore I'm about to read you something you'll never have to probe or guess at it again brother Branham says in a thinking man's filter what made you desire it in the first place the city who's building makers got this land where righteousness this Purity this Holiness you couldn't have done that on your own you were born in sin and Paul says that anyone born in sin that their mind is enmity against God just like God put enmity between the Serpent's Seed and the and the and the woman's seed see so they can't cross and so the the your Fallen condition is enmity against God and can never agree with God and never accept God's plan you have to understand friends you can't just be good enough you're you're born in sin you're having you're born under a death sentence Jesus died at Calvary so that you through him can be released from that so so are well are there virtues to Good Works of course you do good you give God who cause men to give to you you you live this way you reap you sow good seed you'll reap good good crops there's all kinds of value and I that's why I've said even if there is no heaven and even if there is only this life I'd rather be a Christian because it's a way better life I don't I don't spend all my money on booze and drugs and fast living I get to keep it I don't wake up Monday morning hungover and almost get fired because I can't get out of bed I'm clear-headed my family's wholesome there's love and constant love between us I mean the Christian Life who wouldn't want to live that way my I don't have to worry about social diseases I don't have to worry about social anxieties I don't have to do any of that I can I can I can live what at least what God offered came just live like a Christian and you have a better life than being a sinner goodness gracious end up with every kind of disease and sickness and broke down and when you get disease and sickness which we all do including Christians at least a Christian has an advocate at least I have someone who I can go to and say would you heal me kind sir and he can say I certainly will here you go and I can walk out of a doctor's office and leave him scratching his head how are you well I just took an x-ray you were very sick and now you're not and it's gone I don't know where it's gone you can walk after they go I know exactly what happened to it so I'm the crazy one for being a Christian really brother Branham says what made you desire it in the first place here's why I love it that he's going to ask and answer the question what made you desire this is August 1965 a thinking man's filter what made you desire it in the first place oh don't make me take off running because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life not that it had eternal life it was eternal life always laying in there always was in there Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any one of them going to be lost oh friends how hopelessly lost is any man or woman born into this Fallen World born into sin born under a death sentence cut off from God no no way to find him and no way to approach him if you could find him yet being a creature who's made in the image of God made in his very image it is in the DNA of every Mortal being who has ever lived to worship something you go back in the into Antiquity back into the cave paintings back as far back as they can track Humanity I don't agree with their numbers but they they have went back and found the original remains and at least to a degree and and brother Branham shows that they're always worshiping something you know the the Native Americans were worshiping the Sun the nature they didn't know exactly you know Hindus I went there to India on several trips and and we found a 4 000 year old stone carving uh brother Donnie and I were looking at it and it had the serpent seed and the original sin drawn out etched in stone let the devil try to do away with that one think probably wait a hundred tons and it was cut deep and it had survived 4 000 years it wasn't going anywhere and so you find that that it is intrinsic to humanity to pray to to mankind universally universally is driven to seek something higher than himself he's all the time looking for meaning he's all the time searching for truth he's all the time looking for purpose that's why the search can seem impossible you you can find people who are very sincere they try very hard to find truth they goodness they they they leave homes they leave careers they leave families they they they leave high-paying jobs they go on pilgrimages they they you know they they they they go they try all kinds of Western religions and all kinds of Eastern religions and far away mysticisms and Cults of all kinds and you know brother Branham called him wandering Stars wandering Stars Sons and Daughters of God who were men who were built to worship God you were you were you know I remember a story in in in the during the times of the Holocaust under Nazi Germany and it was not Corey ten Boom but it was another man who had been a survivor and he testified how that you know some hard-nosed guard decided to wail on him and and because he you know he knew he was a Jew and he starts wailing on him he says I'm God I'm God I'm God and the the Jewish man looked right and looked him dead in his eye and said you're correct you were built to be a god you were built in the image of God to be an amateur God and to rule and reign with God see and it literally that German Soldier he stopped he he went away thinking about that and it's so true friends that that's what that's what you are built as a human for and brother Branham said oh wandering Stars you go from cult to cult from church to church from this movement to that movement all wandering stars come home today come home they they search everywhere but yet they they never find that's that certain thing that they're searching for sometimes you'll see them later you'll come across them again or you'll see a news article about them and and they'll be much older and and and and they they're no closer they're no closer than before to finding truth and reason and purpose and they still don't know the answer and now they're they're spun out of control uh into a chaos they even even can be disillusioned with life itself I think this was the meaning that brother Branham had in the Patmos vision but he's teaching on the church ages and you remember there the voice of many Waters in the in the Book of Revelation and brother Branham says what is his voice it's the Judgment it's the voice of the ministers see and so brother Branham starts talking about a man drifting man or woman drifting on the sea of life it's a common phrase you know we and and brother Branham you know talks about how what a sad existence if if your life I just read one Wednesday night where he says don't just drift around have a purpose that but I can't find a purpose God has your purpose he has it waiting it's all ready to go it's it's boxed up and Rick got a big ribbon on it all you got to do is open it and say thank you Lord and then the Lord says now I can say happy birthday because you've been born again Hallelujah now you can have purpose and brother Branham says to the person who who never finds that he says what a horrible thing for a drifting Soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the Roar uh you know he talks about the Falls if you ever lived there as I did in in Jeffersonville and they we we would see them all the time the Falls they had the Ohio River flowed down and and there's a great uh Falls there and and they would open that and blow a big horn and you had to get away from it and I grew up around that and had a strong current in that River because of it and and and he says you know to to know that you can hear the sound of those cataracts the sound of those Falls and know that you're drifting over and you're going to perish and there's nothing brother says what a horrible thing but hope is not lost because there's another River Hallelujah there's another River there's a River of Life friends oh do you want to flow on that River today Hallelujah it flows from eternity from that great Fountain we introduced you to in the very first installment of this series it flows from that great fountain in eternity Soul great so great a fountain of love that flowed from Christ that he as we said here and as we've said I'll repeat it today that so great of love that he had that he literally would take the penalty of his own law and suffer death himself come in the form of sinful flesh and Live Like A man among us and live out the perceptive sight of the word on your behalf which you could never do which ended up making him not just our atonement but our total satisfaction atonement's only half the story see atonement just means that he expiated all your sin he was a proper lamb worthy and when he gave his life that that removed all the sin charge against you that you were born with but now the there's still a perceptive side to this because the way your life then has to be line upon line precept upon precept so you have to still have to live it perfectly well that's a problem because I'm in a fallen body and I can't live it perfectly sure shooting I'll I'll make a mistake there's as hard as I'll try I'll grip my teeth I'll come to church and read my Bible but I'm bound to doubt somewhere I'm bound to get a little stumble somewhere so Christ Not only was he the atonement but he also was your propitiation he was also lived the perceptive side precept upon precept he lived a perfect life and God took his perfect life and gave you credit for it and took all your mistakes and piled them on Jesus and he died at Calvary and went to hell as a sinner that's that's the story that's the true story of the Gospel just in case you might have heard that the gospel is signing join a church and sign a book that's an impersonation of Christianity God the whole Christianity is all about God trading his life for yours and trading your life for his and that's not a metaphor and that's not a story and that's not a fairy tale that's that's literal that's literal you you literally live by the life of God living inside you you viscerally are internally you are a new creation in Christ Jesus and that's not a natural thing that's a supernatural thing you can't do it to yourself see but because of that day because that he was willing to do that because you know because of that day on Calvary now any man or any woman who seeks the right who seeks the pure who seeks the holy would be able to find their way back home back home say where back home to where I began in Christ back to where all was right and and whatever and whatever might be wrong will be made right Hallelujah we have the way home friends oh my a place where all is true where all is pure where all is Holy I remember years ago brother physical told us true story from his life as a Young Man hunting and the far north of the Canadian Rockies I've been there hunting myself the only place I've ever been in the Earth where you couldn't hear anything but the wind or maybe a a howling animal somewhere there was no other sound that you didn't hear an aircraft you didn't hear a highway you didn't hear anything you were just among the Pines or among the brush and you hear the wind blowing and you know I I I I was I was so much of a green one I couldn't believe it but Eugene is life-threatening to go with him into the Wilderness brother Eugene Braun and you know he just hands me a rifle and a compass and a radio and says you see that mountain I'm like yeah he goes okay I'm gonna go this way and you go that way and we'll meet for lunch on top of that mountain I was like okay so I'm gonna go from here and I'm gonna how will I oh you'll figure it out I'll see you on the Mountaintop that was it it was my guide in the wilderness [Laughter] I tell you what everything was fine until I went down a path and fortunately it was Daylight and I went down a path quite a ways and and I realized I had went into an area where I couldn't cross a river and I was going to have to double back and go back up and around on The High Ground and when I doubled back along my own path I saw my tracks and so it was easy just to follow my tracks and after I followed my tracks for 50 70 yards or so suddenly the side of my tracks is Wolf tracks and I'm being stalked now you have a rifle but you don't feel safe fortunately it wasn't a pack it was one Lobo it was one Lone Wolf who was following behind me and apparently when I doubled back and he smelled me or saw me or heard me he went off the trail because I could see that I had spooked him I'd as long as he stayed smoked anyway I made it to the Mountaintop and I walked on a walk and I walked and walked and it was starting to get dark and I and I'm on the mountain and I see a campfire and I walk and there's brother Eugene kicked back with his hat and his boots and a campfire going and Foods being cooked and oh my we sit there and as we sit there talking about the things of God and little light snow begin to fall and we just sit there rejoicing in nature and it was so wonderful and brother Ed tells the story about how that he was way back there hunting and alone because that's how you do you break up and you go in different directions you have a rallying point and he he found himself after many hours of hiking and he climbed a very high mountain and as he he said as I made the last step and stepped onto the the top of this mountain he said it and there standing before me was this large metal Tower he said my goodness here's this tower out in the middle of the Wilderness and it was just standing there wasn't even making any noise and he he knew it he knew it was powered because at the very top he could see a slow pulsing red light that would be for aircraft to not crash into it and he said as I stood there and I I looked up at that Tower that lone Tower in the wilderness and he said there it was against the backdrop of that gray wintry Canadian sky and he says I thought to myself that Tower is active and I it's TR it's receiving and transmitting obviously that's why they've got it out here they don't just put a heap of metal on a mountain and put a blinking light for no reason and he said I knew that it was some kind of communication Tower said it struck me that that Tower as I stood there and stared at it against that cold gray sky he said it occurred to me this thing is receiving information and voices and it's transmitting maybe it's relaying uh information and voices and colors and and and and and and and he says but you know he says I couldn't hear any of it he said although the the signal was all around me and even flowing through my body he said to me it was nothing it was silence he said because in order to catch that signal you had to have a radio and then that radio there had to be a crystal and that Crystal had to be set to a certain frequency it couldn't just be anything couldn't be random you had to dial in and if you had that receiving set then you could hear what was coming from the tower and he thought about himself you know the Bible says that the prophet asked the Lord says you know have they have they not heard you know Paul deals with that why is it people can hear the gospel and you can you can have a preacher preaching to you know 100 people and and some of them are catching it and some of them it's going right through them and it means nothing to them at all they don't hear the sound within the sound there's nothing responding down inside of them oh Hallelujah and he said you know he said uh and so Paul says but the prophet said have they not heard and he answers it Paul answers it from the words of the Prophet yay the his sound went into all the Earth and even though many of Israel heard it with him he was not well pleased because they didn't mix it with faith they just wanted to keep it as just some just some philosophy or some Doctrine or some teaching and they weren't interested in it becoming skin this this the the plan for this has always been to live behind flesh he didn't write it to say this he he wrote it in the stars but then he wrote it in a pyramid and then he wrote it in a book and now he's trying to write it in you that's why Christ was a prototype of what you're going to be a body like it under his glorious body oh and the books are closed for the last time the word will be flesh and he said I thought to myself you know uh here here I am their sound went into all the Earth but with many he was not well pleased they didn't mix it with faith on in them that heard it human I mean goodness gracious Humanity I think they would rather spend trillions of dollars on radio antennas to listen for aliens right here at the time when the trumpet of God is ready to sound when the gospel sound when the when the dead in Christ are ready to come when a shout has gone forward when a voice is echoing when a trumpet's ready to sound and the world doesn't hear it but I hear it I hear it I receive it dead I won't ignore it it's it's life to me it means nothing to the world but it means everything to me his family has a receiving scent I hear his signal loud and clear do you hear it loud and clear today I'm sorry for you if you don't hear it and I'm sorry for you if you don't want to hear it but I do I do that's why I preach why I preach I want to hear what he has to say I can't ignore it I don't want to ignore it I want to follow it with my whole heart I uh that's my desire I hope that's your desire today see I want to turn a corner in my sermon today I'm about to get every female's attention I'm going to turn a corner I want to preach on girl power look at these girls sitting up what huh [Laughter] come on sisters how about an amen I don't preach on girl power I want to deal with two Dynamic ladies incredible ladies bravery bravery it's not a word for it brother Jesus talks about one and brother Branham takes The Narrative of another and we've read it in our text how that Jesus said to them that the Queen of Sheba who she came from the far south to hear the words of Solomon she'll rise you're talking about girl power the Queen of Sheba will rise and condemn this generation of unbelieving men and women and unbelieving churches and preachers and governments every kind of thing she'll rise and condemn anyone who gave some flimsy worthless excuse oh it was too hard to do oh I just I wanted to do my own thing this queen risked her life and she came hundreds of miles across the Arabian Desert with Bandits and thieves who would have killed her ravaged her and slaughtered her in her guards and took everything and left her for dead in the sand she pressed through to hear the words of Solomon brother Branham also picks up and gives us tremendous prophetic insight to Rahab the Harlot laodicea thinks it knows something about girl power do you want to know what real girl power is here's some real girl power girls when the entire city of Jericho the king all the princes and every man in the Army was ready to fight against Jehovah one woman living along the wall caught a revelation that's girl power an entire city both of these strong women as brother Branham really unfolds only the way a prophet could how that they imagined that there must surely be more certainly certainly more than what they were being told they lived in the world hundreds of years apart and separated by different regions and different cultures of the world they couldn't have been more unalike the Queen of Sheba born into Royal station from a very young age she's taught to believe that God didn't really operate in power and demonstration that certainly he could well he could never be touched by the feeling of her infirmities say brother Jason how in the world can you know that because of Solomon who taught me that there's nothing new Under the heavens and whatever has been whatever is has been and will be again see so what she so so so you know what she was being told by her counselors is exactly what we View today I can see that happening today this is how God this is how God is viewed any time that it's it has anything to do with man-made organized religion so because that I can see today what you have with organized man-made religion that you know he's at he's at best well we believe in him but he's at best you know an impersonal being you know who only seeks a form of religious observation you see I'm I and and and and by that I'm not talking about say how do you know that because I I got eyes I can see now I'm not talking about what they say with their lips there's all kinds of people as we were preaching Wednesday who say a lot of things about God with their lips and it sounds really good and really appealing but I'm not talking about what they're saying with their lips I'm talking about what are they saying with their life the voice of your life is is what God is hearing see and so we we were showing that Wednesday night how many worship him with their lips but their life shows precious little difference after they claim to have met Christ Jesus talks about that in Matthew 15 8 to 9 this people and this was Israel this is a holy nation but even even Israel draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me therefore the consequence of that is in vain do they worship me now he's not saying they didn't worship he's just saying it don't count in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men see but no real power no no impact of a life or no indwelling life consequently then there's no Liberty because only the Life of Christ you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you not set you make you free see and so so that when you only have a testimony of your mouth and of your lips but you have no impact in your life you have no indwelling of the Holy Spirit then you then you have no Liberty that those man-made religions I'm here to tell you the impersonation of Christianity cannot get you free from sin they can put you under a legal code and make you live a certain way but you'll fight against a all your life and in the end it still won't have given you the value of eternal life this young Queen was taught that God was little more than a disconnected being he didn't actually move in the Affairs of men this non-caring God simply didn't care all she would have in life was to perform her royal duties live out her days on the earth and go by the way of the grave no end to the monotony of life no hope for a brighter world where real love and real Harmony and true peace could exist between all peoples her whole life was confined to a form that lasted for years until she grew into a beautiful young woman like we have in here many in here today that was fine when she was a little girl but finally she grew and blossomed into a beautiful young woman who could think for herself now her girl power was starting to turn she could think for herself simultaneously the source of both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness because now she's more vulnerable than ever see say what what what determines it it depends on who has control of her heart not rocket science sisters it's not difficult it's it's about who has control of your heart see depending on if that's the true God depending on if it's your maker who has control of your heart or the God of this evil age who wanted who who for this queen he wanted to twist her off just like they do today twist girls off into modern striptease and an adulterous and just just so that evil men can gawk at them but if you fill your mind sisters you want a secret to real girl power fill your mind with God's thoughts and if you're willing to fill your mind with God's thoughts and your willing as Paul said to cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God if you're willing to bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ then thinking for yourself is wonderful see now you can Rage Against the plan of God you can women do it in Mass they hear the word of God for their life they rage against it I won't have it I won't do it I just won't do it well that road has a horrible ending you say oh that's the 21st century I can I I can think thoughts that are that are not influenced by Christ or the Antichrist they're just my thoughts but that's just not true that's just not true if you can reach a point listen if you could reach a point now think with me sisters if you could reach a point where where you have the mind of your creator working within you what better way would you imagine there would be of thinking for yourself because you would be able to think like him you would have his thoughts the creator of all the universe you're talking about girl power that God can use oh my see this is actually the truth as I said in the first of my sermon this is actually the truth that actually Satan wrapped it in a lie and hid it from Eve she that she would be like God if she did it his way but God already had that plan for her Satan offered it to her through a lie so what she was already entitled to would have she would have come to listen to this now Satan's worldly campaign Satan listen sisters Satan's worldly campaign of getting you to think for yourself is really it's Rich it's it's merely him trying to deceive you into thinking his thoughts that's all it is because the best way to think for yourself is to let the mind which was in Christ be in you so don't fall for it don't fall don't drink that Kool-Aid don't fall for that I've come a long way baby I can think for myself you'll go to hell thinking like that God is trying to save you from that God can use like he did these two very Godly women see in the end sisters brothers as well in the end if you think his thoughts the end of that is bondage and he has no other outcome but to destroy you you need to understand that his only outcome is to destroy you the world under this satanic influence I I probably won't get to that today I'm going to stop here in a minute the world under this satanic influence I hate to say this so crudely you forgive me but it Stacks loose women like cordwood piles them up piles of Filth that men don't even respect and would never imagine marrying a loose woman like that they become a dime a dozen and the men responsible are even worse how about you think this sister rejects Satan and let the mind of Christ be in you someone who really love you someone who really care someone who'll grow you into a royal lady real daughters real sons of the Living God and place you in a kingdom as a member of the royal family to rule and reign with Christ through ceaseless ages that's what is offered to you today this is the advantage this is the advantage of good parents if you have Godly Parents listen young people if you have Godly Parents who teach you the ways of right that is so rare you should be thankful be deeply thankful because not all children have that most do not see no one can give you the mind of Christ that has to come by New Birth but what a parent can do is teach you about him and as I was saying Wednesday raise you in a way that you should go so that down the road the Holy Spirit can already be a step ahead and can deal with your loved ones see so that this is the primary purpose of being a parent primary purpose listen young people the primary purpose of your parent is not to prepare you to live here but to go there that's the primary purpose anytime parents have that inverted they are failing in their commission all of their many good accomplishments notwithstanding but that's the most important part listen as I I I I'm getting ready to close I want to tell you something hell will be filled with young men and young women who will be cut down in the prime of their life in a tribulation period who were raised to believe that the greatest achievements in their life was social acceptance higher education greater station and position in the world they will die in the Millions they will die in the tens and hundreds of millions in Mankind's self-destructive act at Armageddon but I'm here to tell you there will be millions of young men and young women who get a hold of the word of God who have parents and pastors that tell them the truth who want who will escape the tribulation and who will live and reign with Christ and heaven will have of them the choice is yours today does that say I'll let the mind which was in Christ be in me I will not go the way of the deceptive World I'll I'll be like a Rahab I'll be like the Queen of Sheba I'll do whatever it takes to find Christ because a greater than Solomon is here and greater than Joshua is here a greater than all of those are here and it can be yours today friend stand with me hallelujah oh I've tried to get to that part right there for weeks and I won't get to it again today amen praise the Lord come brother Tony bring your team listen friends this is this is this is for real stuff this is life for real lived in real time in high definition you can't escape it you can't go around it you can't neglect it you can't ignore it Christ is on your hands today bow your heads with me all all over the building amen amen amen praise the Lord Brother Tony you were let me find it again you were singing a song I so love um your grace still amazes me let's let's have that Deb just play that quietly for me for a moment [Music] Lord just feeling the unction of the Holy Spirit to close right away I promised you I wouldn't take my own thoughts and so when I felt you say stop now ask the people to think about what they've heard today God is trying and he's determined and he's going to succeed in his plan to rebuild Eden that's what the gospel came to do that's why the message is here that's why God sent us a prophet because when the world was in chaos we've already seen this when the world was in chaos and darkness covered the face of the deep there's no light there was nothing it was just a chaotic volcanic twisting turning hurling through space thousands of miles an hour but God had a plan to bring it into order he was gonna set forth light and darkness he was going to set forth land and gonna separate the land from the water he was gonna begin to bring it back to order and he did every bit of it by his word he spoke and the Earth obeyed him he spoke like Jesus did in the winds and the waves obeyed him proved who he was he had been doing that since Genesis and on that Earth he built a garden and on that Garden he put his family he had a grand plan that he would fill the whole earth with his family he said to Adam and Eve be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth subdue it and have dominion this was his plan for his family sin came along and perverted his way but as a prophet said we come anyhow but we're born in sin we were always going to be here but we were supposed to come by a spoken word when we bypassed that theophany and we came straight to the Flesh and we were lost and that's why Jesus came to die on our behalf so that through the Life of Christ I can be made new and that the chaos of my life the chaos that I can't fix something that would give me real meaning and real purpose in life and not just chasing after Satan's sparkly Eden I don't want Satan's shiny things I want the glow of the Holy Spirit God is restoring Eden and you're a part of it friends today with your heads bowed you're a part of it you're a part of Eden God is looking to restore your life and restore the Earth and he even brings you both through Redemption with the exact same process [Music] water blood and Fire [Music] it was baptized in the days of Noah the blood of Jesus dropped on it at Calvary and at the end of the Millennium there will be a holy fire that will baptize the Earth the bride of Christ all the family of God will be caught up into a higher Dimension a prophet teaches us we'll come up into heaven while the Earth is being burned over blowing away going back through its volcanic eruptions blowing away hundreds and hundreds of feet of of surface blowing it out into Smithereens and fresh virgin soil will come back down and we'll rebuild it as a headquarters for all the galaxies of all the universe and the plan of God will roll on and on and on today friends if your life is in a chaos and been in a chaos and it's in a chaos the day you're born if you've never accepted the word of God to bring your life back to his order maybe you want to say preacher that's me today raise up your hands so the Lord can see that and say Lord I need that fire I need that word I need that to come into my life I need that fixed I need that adjusted I need to get rid of that I need to get rid of this Lord hands everywhere mine Believers and alike young and old boys and girls men and women Lord God it takes your word to cause Mortals to defy gravity and raise a hand for gravity is constantly pushing it

arm raised and you saw all of that you watched that process you saw those synapse firing you saw that hand lifting you saw the purpose in that heart you won't ignore it Lord no no no no no no you look
