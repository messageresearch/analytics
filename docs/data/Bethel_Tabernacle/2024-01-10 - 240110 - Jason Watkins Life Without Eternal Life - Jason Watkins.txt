praise the Lord Matthew chapter 22 we'll catch verses 36-40 then we'll let you be seated and we're going to go to the Book of James Matthew chapter 22 and we'll catch 36 through 40 so this is where um someone comes along to ask him a question he's a lawyer he's a expert in the law my boy these guys they just love to try to trap Jesus in the law and here he was you know he I mean he was the whole law and the prophets amen praise the Lord that'll become important as we go along Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets wow what a statement James chapter two amen praise the Lord amen so you know for going to the Book of James it's we're gonna we're gonna get up in your business tonight because James didn't play amen he's No Nonsense he's straight honest and U he just had a way of cut into the chase amen praise the Lord amen James chapter 2 verse 1 1 through 13 my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect of persons for if they are come unto unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and fine apparel and there come in also a poor man in vow rment and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him you sit here in a good place and say to the poor man you stand there or sit here at my foot stol are you not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and Air of the Kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor do not the rich men oppress you and draw you before the Judgment seats do not they blaspheme that worthy Name by which ye called if ye fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well but if you have respect to person you commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill th Thou Art become a transgressor of the law so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of Liberty now that's a wonderful word isn't it the law of Liberty so we got a royal law and we got the law of Liberty for he shall have judgment without Mercy that hath showed no mercy and I love this and mercy rejoiceth against [Music] judgment let's pray Master we thank you now for your word that we we've read and Lord I just covet your your complete takeover Lord of this service tonight and I pray that you will help us to look into the word father to see what our needs are and to see how our needs are met in you I commit myself into your hands for service just now in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated so a royal law a law of Liberty I want to just make a few comments about this before we go too far into it so it's a royal law and as I as I began to look at that and began to break it down I wondered you know why James would call it Royal why that that would be the adjective that he would choose to use in the Greek and I'm not going to do a breakdown of the Greek tonight but he used this very you know this very descriptive word to describe the characteristics of the law from the lawgiver and he calls it and and thinking of a way to describe the law of Liberty which is in Christ only in Christ then he would call it a royal law and so we realize then that because it's a a royal law the law uh you know would would describe a manifestation um can I say it this way of a royal person and and if that person has decided to build a kingdom then I would suggest to you it's a Royal Kingdom and I we and if we believe that a royal person has built a Royal Kingdom and then and he has a royal law of and and that Royal law is a manifestation because James doesn't leave it as just some you know just some feel-good thought it's not just a thought bubble he actually describes it he says if you would keep the Royal law you're going to do this you're going to live like this you're not going to do this that or the other so it's not just a philosophy it's not just a a nice fuzzy way of thinking it actually if I'm going to say the Royal law given by the Royal person who's building a Royal Kingdom he obviously wants Royal subjects then that tells me that he's looking for a royal manifestation he's not looking for you know a word salad he's not just looking you know for a cliche the if there's a royal law then there ought to be a royal manifestation and I believe that James gets this word did got this description and chose this description because he saw true royalty up close amen amen I'm going to tell you something when you hang around Royal people you start thinking Royal thoughts you start talking when you're when you have become convinced that your father is a great king you remember the story brother Bram tells about the slave from Africa but he was different than the other ones and they said well why is he said because at home his father's a king and even though he's in a foreign land he knows who he is he knows his lineage and he conducts himself his life is a manifestation of his Heritage so I I think that James spending those years you know growing up alongside of Jesus and following him in his ministry he was able to see real royalty we're not talking about the royalty that the world conjures up and people just think that their royalty because somewhere back in their lineage uh their great ancestor was some type of a king and you know it's amazing that in the earth Wars have fought because there's a king and somebody else wants to be the king yeah and so they there's a Civil War and whoever wins is going to get to have a new king and that's that that lasts about as long and as as until another one comes along who says you know I think I'd like to be a king and he hires a bunch of troops and mercenaries and we got another War Europe Europe is replete with that kind of warfare and and and and a lot of times in families this goes all the way back to anytime there's a monarch you even find it in in the in the Kings of Israel in their sinful ways in the kings of Judah those backslid kings they would absolutely have their siblings murdered just so that they could not I mean when Herod is on the throne and he hears about a child born who's going to fulfill prophecy boy years old and down can you imagine having the kind of a manifestation to where you actually receive a prophecy and you have somebody come along and verify to you that they've been following a star and even the Supernatural is around the promise and and they're saying the Supernatural is proving to you that this today this scripture is fulfilled and you're going to try to commit murder sound familiar it's what we find from the very first days of the early church when that false Church began to go in they immediately Satan goes off of he he realizes he can't trick them and deceive them and get and G and gain all the ends that he wants to achieve so he jumps on a red horse and starts slaughtering them so Jesus says that the first great commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind and I I think that this verse has never had more significance in the day and hour that we live in in 2024 than to say you need to love the Lord with your whole mind because this is an age of the the invasion of the minds of man and everything is designed to to bring your mind aside and put it on anything but the word of God I think we can witness that and he says the next thing that goes with loving God with all your heart soul and mind is that you love others as yourself so you so you can see that the influence of this Royal person giving out his Royal word and when people believe it one of the signs is that their life becomes Royal and and James picks this second this second thing up where Jesus said the first is love God the second is love your love your neighbor as yourself and that's what James picks up and calls the Royal law see so so there there's no way to he says you know if ye fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so so as I said I think this this should prove to us clearly tonight that if we're if we're going to say that we're part of the royal family then our life ought to have a royal manifestation so now now I'm going Beyond just loving thy neighbor as thyself now it's all the law yeah see so so we find then that this is a royal manifestation that will be in the lives of all of those who are part of the royal family you you you'll you'll let me say it like this those will have a royal manifestation who love God with all their heart soul and mind amen can I say it in that direction that's just flipping it I'm inverting it now you're reading it one way and you're coming to a conclusion now I'm starting with a conclusion and I'm going back to the cause what would cause me to live the Royal law because I love God with all my heart my my mind my soul and everything is all about him so these are they who will fulfill the Royal law and they're the only ones Dr conable one of my favorite commentators I don't can't agree with him on everything of course like brother brandham said I he said I like old Dr scoffield he said no I don't agree with all of his notes he said but you know there there was some of them that brother brandham liked and one of my favorite for years has been Dr constable and he he says this in his lexical Aid the word Royal and he's got a breakdown of the Greek we're not going into it tonight but he says it like this the Royal law is Royal in that it is is the law of the king who heads the kingdom that Believers will inherit clear enough the Royal law is is Royal here's why it's Royal in that it is the law of the king who heads the kingdom that Believers will inherit what are you looking to inherit what are your future plans I can tell you my future plans don't involve staying around here my future home is is is not this world order I'm looking for a Royal Land Hallelujah with a royal order he goes on to say it is also Royal I thought these were astonishing reasons just really hit the nail on the head it is also Royal in that it is primary meaning that it governs all other laws dealing with human relationships am and he writes Matthew 2239 and Leviticus 19:18 if you want to make a reference so now we've got to come down and realize that that this is as I said to you already this is not just about treating your neighbor like yourself this is all other laws amen and it it it makes it a royal law because it's the primary law and if you are I'm saying as plain as I possibly can if if the Royal law is governing your life then all other laws of God's word are a part of your manifestation this is why the Apostle could say to the Believers because they're the only ones who can pull this off at least they're the ones that are supposed to be pulling it off that whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus so I just simply say whatever I you can't do and and put the name of Jesus to it don't do it whatever you can't say in the name of Jesus don't say it now how do you speak to your neighbor now how do you speak to someone in the business world how do you speak to your spouse how do you speak to your children children how do you speak to Mom and Dad how do husbands speak to wives how do wives speak to husbands hey don't get quiet this is the Royal law you can say well you know I'm I'm born this I got this propensity brother brandham said he was Irish but the Holy Ghost quelled all of that he said all of his people were killers and drunkard but he wasn't like that see so don't don't tell me your her it AG or your nature or you know because the Holy Ghost brings down control Upon Our Lives amen I told you James was going to get up in your business Dr Constable goes on to say Let me let me read it in in in the flow that he gives it it's also the Royal in that it is primary it governs all other laws dealing with human relationships moreover it is conduct of a high order that is worthy of a king no wonder a prophet would come and preach a sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel come on Friends it don't do any good to say I'm a Believer and God sent a prophet where is the manifestation I already know you got a royal message you got a royal Christ is are you living a royal life Royal people surrender to their duties yeah even the ones who don't want it and it's a burden but they they have an obligation see so it is a a high order it's a conduct of high order that is worthy of a king another commentary that I on this verse that I thought was really good from the Bible knowledge commentary says James was aware that there would be some who would tend to dismiss their offense of prejudice as a trivial fault remember James said somebody will come in with a ring and gold and and fine clothes and you'll treat them a certain way and then the next man comes in who's poor and and filthy clothes and you just want to shuffle him off to a corner somewhere and and James is saying that's wrong respect of persons is wrong it's devilish it's evil listen friends if there was ever a time uh you're living in a world that is so polarized it's so divided it's so opposing if there was ever a time when we should live by all for one and one for all if there was ever I've been saying it for 30 years we're all in this thing together friends let's be together Let's Stay Together let's have families in harmony who are who are following the Royal lifestyle you see say he was aware that there would be some who would tend to dismiss their offense of prejudice as a trivial fault they would hardly consider themselves as law Breakers just because they showed a little favoritism we do that don't we well I'm mostly good I got a few little you know I'm you know it's not really not really a problem oh it's a problem see that's what James is point it's a problem the uh bkc goes on to say they would hardly consider themselves as law Breakers James went on to make it clear that this was no small offense whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking it all so there ain't no Little trivial things we're either Believers or we're not we're either going to keep God's word or we're not see in a message in 1955 the Waters of Separation I love this this gives me hope brother brandham says when we we always think of the color he's talking about the color of red he said that the red is danger he said red does signify danger or uh or life or so forth but read in the scripture signifies Redemption through the blood see now I want you to think just for a minute because I I ran a little test I I remember hearing brother brandham talk about and you know in his uneducated way and he kept apologizing for it he said if there's a scientist here he said I know you just Overlook me and I'm in my ignorance he said I'm just trying to make a a point and he you know had this that or this and it' be this color and and if you just changed a a couple little molecule numbers if you you know instead of instead of Sr 5- csy and instead you made it you know r3g and and and dash y Za he said then you could go from this color to that color to this color to that color and and it would be amazing with just a little variation how you could change the color and I I look I started looking into that that and there are some when you look at molecular formulas they there are some of them that are exceptionally dissimilar and they they're colors very W wildly but you know I I just I just took as an example and I didn't decided not to put it up on the screen tonight I just took red and blue and the first thing that I found out is that you know something I already knew and I thought yeah of course you know there's all different kinds of colors of red and all kinds of different colors of blue but just as an example there is is a color of red and a color of blue and when I looked at the mathematical or looked at the molecular formula just like brother brandham said they were almost identical just one or like seven or eight characters long maybe maybe a dozen characters long and only one or two or three of them were just different it had just one little different number and it went from red to blue so now this this makes me realize and I'm going to make a point here in a minute that what I'm saying now is going to be based on that God just didn't accidentally make colors they actually have a formula they're actually scientific they're very precise down to the molecule so much so that if he just changes one or two digits in a dozen digit long uh sequence it's a completely different color so God doesn't do anything accidentally all right so now brother brandham is saying red does signify danger but red in the scripture signifies Redemption through the blood so let me say it like this God made blood red on purpose he didn't make it blue or brown or green he made it red read in the scripture signifies Redemption through the blood Harlot Rahab would she put the Scarlet streak down and all she put a red a red streak a red cord All Through the Bible is a Scarlet streak Redemption catch this now this is the prophet with such an authority that everybody else could probe at it and probe at it and probe at it but here's a prophet coming and and certifying that Redemption comes through red say who decided that that the king the one who made red the one who literally created the formul and said this right here is going to be Redemption and and it can't be changed at all you you can't even add one little digit you can't change anything he's got one color for Redemption I want you to see the purpose that this is a Purpose Driven God who do who who does nothing without a a a royal reason oh my Hallelujah so he says Redemption comes through red through the shedding of the blood and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and how that God said now here he goes again go and get this heer that's red all over so now he's decided that for the sacrificial animal for a certain type of sacrifice not just any sacrifice there all kinds of sacrifices in in in Leviticus but for this one particular this Redemption sacrifice it's got to be a sacrificial animal that's red all over and it can't even have any variation or any other colors so he says this he that's red all over were not one spot of anything else but perfectly red amen through the shedding of the blood and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and how that God said okay I've read that all right and so he says and he says so God said get this heer that's red all over not one spot of anything else perfectly red for God looked through red and now he's going to go scientific on you and you know what and he says and you know what color is red looking through red red through red makes white try it one time we used to all do that in the cereal box I forget now what it came in you'd have the little goggles and you have the secret code and if you put the red goggles on you'd you'd see a red splotch and and you'd see the code uh you'd see the white the white lettering you couldn't see it when you took the red goggles off oh friends watch this now and he says for God looked through red and he says red through red makes white try it one time red through red produces white so when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ to we who are Scarlet Red with sin and covered by the blood he sees us white as snow though your sins be red like Crimson for real for real they really are red like Crimson but because of the red blood of Jesus Christ he sees you as white as snow though your sins be read like Crimson they shall be white as snow this tells me that Redemption is not some accident brother brandom's just not going hey you know a neat little little funny thing here you know this isn't just a little bit of a little funny trivia guess what I figured out in the Bible no this is God before there was ever Stardust he already knew there was was going to be a lost people he already knew he was going to have a Redemption and when he creates blood he said now this is going to be a redeeming color I want you to understand friends that you're headed for Glory tonight because of a master plan you're not going accidentally you didn't become a Believer accidentally God thought about this he knew your sins would be like Scarlet so he had a remedy before the first sin was ever committed a red heer is not a product of evolution it's a product of creation blood isn't readed by accident you you you you and and and you take oxygen out of it and you start changing the color change it at all and you start changing color yesen see it's got to have life in it the fact that it's red means you're set free by a living Force so when God made blood red and when God made a sacrificial animal red he already knew there would be a Redemption of the Lost see and so so now under a prophetic microscope we see this compound meaning that that otherwise we wouldn't have known with certainty I could have stood up here and said you know I think maybe this could be lots of managed thinkers brilliant Beautiful Minds of men could could could have thought about that and probably did and it's probably in lexical AIDS in other places but I'm here to tell you something friends I'm not trusting in my wits or their wits because they got some stuff wrong and I get some stuff wrong I'm glad that I have a prophetic I have a prophetic utterance Hallelujah red stands for Redemption and so we see that Jesus is trying to this is why Jesus would come with such a a flat statement with no wiggle room you must be born again amen we've been laboring on this to we we were talking about it on Sunday and I referenced a conversation with a young man recently to say it's wonderful to come to church it's wonderful to sing songs it's it's it's wonderful to have the understanding of the Bible but you must be born again I'm glad you're here but you must be born again he said brother Jason I'm glad you're my pastor thank you but you must be born again hallelujah it's a command it's a requirement it's definitely not a recommendation It's Not Mere advice so we find that from sini Paul deals with this in Hebrews 2 we're not going to uh take the time to go there tonight but from sini Paul Paul talks about there that how that we live under the rule of law from sini and that every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward I call it I call it uh sin uh is the fair wages uh the the fair wages of sin is a retirement fund uh just as those in Sodom received in their flesh all the Corruptions naturally yeah they received penalty in their flesh naturally people who live in sin suffer naturally in their flesh everybody who lives a life a committed life that's against God's word sin pays wages and those who have been in hell are spending their retirement they earned it well they built up a big account and some of them built up larger accounts than others I was looking at a at a documentary on the first nerenberg trial and they executed 10 from the Third Reich of the Nazi the Nazi regime there and and of course they had second and third different ones of the nerenberg trials this was the very first one of course sikan they didn't have Hitler had committed suicide they didn't have him so they couldn't bring him to trial but they brought everybody else to trial from guring on down and we find that l a little while later they caught some of them in hiding and they brought them to trial and then they caught some more and brought them to trial and so I I don't want to get off into the that all the 10 that were executed and and were executed by hanging that there was only one only one I I could hardly believe it that they they literally recorded here their standing on The Gallows and the The Noose is around their neck and they're just getting ready to put the black hood over their face and they say would do you have any last words I mean you're done you're on the Gallows The Noose is around your neck this isn't going to go any other way but one way do you have any last words and and all of them would say you know where I I love Germany and I love the Fatherland and I I pray God's blessing upon the German people and and and then some of them just they said you have any last words no and only one there was one elderly man he had been part of the H of the command chain and he his the first words out of his mouth were I pray that God have mercy on my soul only one out of 10 amen and that was the first thing he said in confessing his guilt of of these crimes against humanity he said I pray that God forgive my soul and and forgive Germany and help help her to be healed and reunited and we followed leaders who weren't soldiers and they were they were of evil intent and he's admitting all of this and he's the only one say what is going to be his outcome he'll get a fair trial I know that and just before they pulled the black hood over his face he turned to the chaplain and he said in a low voice I'll see you again so we find then that the fair wages of sin can't be refused as a wage you've got to once you earn them you've got to spend them suffering in the the regions of the lost I I also I didn't watch the whole thing I was I was I had a purpose and intent I was looking for a certain thing and I came across this man and you you know the internet is filled with these testimonies and different churches put them out and and of near-death experiences you know brother branam had not just a near-death experience he had an afterdeath experience Hallelujah and actually he had a near-death experience where he descended into the lower parts of the earth and he says it was a haunting it was the most horrible thing he said he said I'd rather have hot wires run through my body than to ever go than to spend five minutes there he said it's real friends don't ever let anyone tell you it's not a real place and this man who had who had died in an explosion and he he he they they managed to get him back later but he he tells how that when he flew from the explos and a a furnace exploded gas and it blew him backwards and he said I was up out of my body and he said I looked around and I saw that I had died in an explosion and he says now that matches what brother brandham said he said I looked back and there was my body and I thought oh I've died see so this is not uncommon brother brother brandham even in one quote he talks about how that when when a spirit leaves the body it hangs around the body for a little bit trying to get back in and and so he says he says immediately bursting into my room they came right through the wall he he starts talking about these two large very grotesque looking beings now and he he goes on I'm gonna say a little bit more in a moment but that caught my attention when he starts talking about these two very large grotesque beings and brother brandom in demonology describes that demons have different appearances depending on what kind of demon they are I got a quote here on demonology I'm going to read this in a moment if I don't run out of time you all right and and so I that caught my attention when he talks about the they were very large and they were very gross and and ghoulish looking and and I and I remembered immediately it took me back I was I was a young boy and I was having a dream and the Lord's dealt with me in spiritual dreams all my life and I and he's get told me things and I was able to reveal things to people and solve cases not only in my children but as a pastor and even even there you you you've come to me members of my church have come to me with a dream and I would say you know let's pray and see what the Lord will do and see if he'll show me the dream now that's only the purview of a prophet who sees the dream you had and I'm certainly not a prophet but I wondered one time with a gift of dream would God do that and he did and I was able to set a brother down and I was able to go back and tell him parts of the dream he left out and he said my goodness you really saw my dream I said I did now here's the interpretation because you're Miser understanding the dream you're you're very frightened over it but you don't have to be because you remember this this this he goes yes I saidwell this is what it meant not what you think amen so so we find that that I the Lord dealt with me in very powerful dreams and I was just a lad and I I remember having a dream that caught my attention like this man and in the dream I was walking in a dark place and I a long vast expanse of void it's only I can say it was all dark and I could tell I was moving through it and far in the distance I saw a light I thought what is that it's way in the distance and I I probably couldn't have been much more than Enoch's age here and as I'm walking and as I start getting close I see that there are two staircases and and they and they basically are side by side at ground level and one of them turns and goes up upward and disappears and another one goes and turns downward and I can see red glow and up here I can see bright light and as I'm walking there's a man sitting on this side and he's a very ghoulish looking creature and as he as I'm approaching he looks up and he says oh I see we have another one and I knew what that meant my parents had taught me the way and and things about uh demonology my mother taught us from a very young age that the devil was real and hell wasn't a figment of imagination it wasn't just some some hazy thing it was an actual place and as soon as he said oh we've got another one I immediately went to stop and when I did I realized something lifted me and I looked like this and there it was two very large ghoulish grotesque looking when this man said two very large beings came in very ghoulish had Claws and and and and suddenly I realized and they were carrying me towards the downward staircase and I was kicking and screaming for all I was worth I remember like it was yesterday and it you know what it reminded me it it I they were they were very large and they were covered in Long Grizzly hair hair I remember that so vividly just like head to toe I can tell you this they didn't look like Angels amen let me just say it that way they didn't look like Gabriel oh my and they're carrying me towards and right as we got near the banister and they're going to take me down I somehow managed to make a kick and twist and jerk and I broke free of their grip now you don't can imagine where I headed I ran around the banister and with them trying to reach and grab me and up that staircase I went and they started chasing me as hard as they could and I was running and I was fast as the wind when I was a kid and I'm running up those steps and they're right on my heels and right as I break into the top there stands the biggest most beautiful look Gabriel looking angel big giant white Wings enormous and he's just standing there and I stopped and they stopped and everybody froze and he looked at me and he looked at them and he just went and they turned around and went back down and the last thing as I woke up I was walking into the entrance it stayed with me as a boy all my life never forgot that and and they covered you know I I I remember that that brother brandham talked about the the demon of alcoholism that came out of of of rosella Griffin sister Rosella Griffin and and he said it had long hair just like that when when I heard that as a boy when I heard that on tape I went wow that's exactly like what I saw they didn't look like bats and brother brandham said not all demons look the same and so but but I remember that that very long hair I remember brother Keith Brown giving a description one time of a woman who was delivered of cigarettes and I'm not here to to to give kids bad dreams but it was brother it affected brother Keith and he was praying and I was standing on the front row I wasn't even minister at the time and he was down with a brother from Haiti and those Haitian pastors man they're used to busting heads with demons and he's I remember that Haitian pastor is just saying in the the name of Jesus Christ I command you in the name of Jesus Christ and brother Keith is down there praying and in the name of Jesus Christ and all of a sudden I saw brother Keith stagger backwards and like get out of the way no one knew what happened but that woman was free in a moment and he told it the next morning in the service he said friends he said when that brother was casting that devil out of her he said what Rose up out of her he said it was the most horrible and he talked about that Grizzly that long hair it had that grizzly long hair and he said it was just like a puppet it was like Jello-O it was like going like this it had it had just become disembodied this is this is not this is not a fairy tale this is real life and he said it wiggled and wiggled and went through the wall I saw that happen right here saw a demon come up out of his sister and take off right through the window the old window that used to be there and so so you you see these things and brother Brandon picks it up here he says I'm writing a book if you if I can you I don't I don't know whether you'll be a on demonology personal contact with demons friends they're just as real as you just as real as you're real and I see them many times when they leave right I seen them come right off the platform I see them some of them in the shape of bat some of them see look like long hairs hanging on their legs but epileptic demon looks like a tortoise with round legs hanging up like that but usually and then he goes to a demon of Oppression these suicide demons he said a demon of Oppression seems to be more like a cloud form like a wave and it just makes a real funny sound when you're when you're in that other other dimension to see that Spirit now you may think that's wrong but some of these days you'll realize if you could only take a SP spiritual Looking Glass and look now watch this watch him turn the corner on us he said if you could only take a spiritual Looking Glass and look into your soul no doubt you'd find out what it looks like and the greatest devil now he's talking about bats and tortoises and waves and depression and like little clouds that make a funny sound but now he comes on he says but now the greatest devil the chief of all Devils is unbelief amen and it lives in the soul of people amen I I was going to put it on the screen tonight but again I didn't want to send children home with bad dreams I don't know if you ever remember way back in I think in the 1930s I remember years ago uh seeing and I don't even remember the name of it for sure but it was something about Dorian Gray and he he stood in a mirror and he he he thought he was young but he was actually decrepit and and the evil that was in in his heart was turning him ghoulish until one day he looked in the mirror and he saw his real gaunt self I'm here to tell you friends people don't have a spiritual mirror like that but we do have the word and let me tell you you don't want to see a fallen soul in it's a spiritual mirror just look in God's word and say Lord I don't want to be that person I want to be full of the spirit of God I want to have the law of Liberty I want to have the Royal law working inside of me cuz the worst one is in the soul and it's unbelief he said that's the only sin there is there's no doubt sin there's no other sin but unbelief all these little morals and things smoking drinking gambling committing adultery that's just attributes you do that because you don't believe unbeliever is what makes you do it if you was a Believer you wouldn't do it that's right and this man that I was watching his testimony I didn't complete it cuz I wasn't there for that purpose I just caught a few of the details but the thing that astonished him was to was to find out that although he was he was incredulous that these big ghoulish beings were coming after him because he he said I've been in church for years he said I'm talking about he said I've been in church I pay my tithe I I sing in the choir do all of these things he said you know I I I do this and I do that but he but he realized in that moment in that moment when he was H when he was having his near-death experience and he's looking down on his body that's just been blown up and here comes these gouls right through his living room wall to take him and he said they had shackles and they were going to put them on me and and he was so astonished to to and he realized in that moment in that moment that he had been in church for years but he he did not have What it Took amen at that moment amen he was missing that personal experience with the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we're preaching that's why we're talking about it SUNY that's why I sat across from a young man I said you must be born again it's good that we love this church it's good that we love each other it's good that we've got wonderful families and great ministry but you must be born again it's good to believe God sent a prophet it's good to believe all the truth but you must be born again oh God give us an oldfashioned outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon our young people Upon Our married people that's what I want to see in this assembly a fresh outpouring he protested that he had been a good person he's trying to trying to reason with these ghouls he protested that he had been a good person he considered himself a Christian he said when I protested he said I was shown a long long list of offenses that I had committed since I was a child this is his testimony he said the thing that astonished him the most is how trivial they seemed just like when James was writing lest the Believers think it's just trivial to show respect of persons and James says it's not trivial it's serious and he said they showed me a long list of Minor offenses he said things that you know I'd stolen that I I didn't really think amounted to anything you know nobody would miss it it was no big deal and he said he said I was even shown harsh words that I had uttered just giving somebody the business you know telling somebody off he said he said there was even one on the list where I had been in a in a checkout line at a store and he said I had grown impatient with the store clerk because she was taking too long to give me a receipt and he said I snaap some rude comments to her and these harsh words and and and even just imp patience and and he says because and this this thought this answer blew me away he says because that that wasn't love that wasn't love just harsh words and those demons have a list of it it's there's a record of it amen that's why I said friends whatsoever you do in word or deed all must be done in the name of Jesus spouses can't speak to a spouse and hatred and anger and Venom and and and children and to parents and parents to children neighbors to neighbors employers to employees you know work Associates Business Associates we're we're supposed to have the law the Royal law living in our lives our homes are supposed to be governed by the token we're not supposed to offend the holy spirit because it wasn't love he wasn't living the Royal law and what James said in chapter two comes into play for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all I'm gonna turn a corner I'm going to run for the finish line and you're going to be glad because at this point if I didn't have what I'm getting ready to go to I would just have I thought about this today I was out working in my yard and I was thinking about these notes and I thought wow this is so tight that I'm just going to have to tell the whole church I'm sorry I don't think any of us are going to make it me included it's just too tight and I I I just thought I would have to if I didn't have the answer I would have to come here and apologize and say friends for 30 years I've tried to get you to Perfection and I haven't even been able to get myself there and I'm sorry but it looks like none of us are going to make it brother brandham goes on in the water of Separation here's your here's your remedy from fainting he said God looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed amen you're redeemed because you mean there's a reason yeah you're redeemed because he's always seen you through Christ Hallelujah that's the reason we can be perfect GL not perfect in the sense of sinlessness we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ you see why I keep saying it you must be born again see not not not perfect in the sense of sinlessness we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ that's the reason he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect now brother brandham moves to chapter 10 of Paul coming here and he says Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews now don't lose sight of the fact that Hebrews chapter 10 is is the setup to come to MDC all right now watch Hebrews trying to explain the law Paul's trying to explain the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things could never make the cun too perfect because God was looking through animal blood but now he looks through the blood of his son Perfection come by Jesus Christ now I'm not perfect in your your sight you may not be perfect in my sight but what about in God's sight that's where it lays and if you're born again into the body of Christ then God looks upon you as perfect as Christ was himself amen says Amen to his own statement nothing you can do it's not by any works that you can do at all it's by Grace God has given you this offer and if you've accepted it in the sight of God you are perfect redeemed washed in the blood of the Lamb without fault without blemish without spot that marvous Lord see because now he's moving to the order of MDC and I I I I didn't carry on in the quotee although I I could have um Let me let me let me read this last one perfect strength by Perfect weakness that's that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient then God takes the person and begins to mold himself into that person makes his hands do what God would have hands do makes his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his they're Gods your hands don't belong to you your feet don't belong to you your eyes your ears your your lips your speech doesn't belong to you it belongs to him see there God whatever make his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his they're God's watch this ending statement he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness and to make his own self he takes my weaknesses and makes me into him makes you into his own self see and so so when he so this is exactly why it's so significant that he comes to MDC because remember friends you you do do you remember you you you you remember how that and I let me I think I got a scripture here uh yeah Genesis 49:10 the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall be the Gathering of the people and shall shall the Gathering of the people be so he's he's a lawgiver this is what Christ is when you come into the order of mezc you're coming into the order of the lawgiver you say why is that significant because brother brandham said that I'm above the law he said see I I if if if there's a speed limit that says you can't go but this fast he said but if I'm not bound by that law I can go fast as I want cuz I'm not subject to the law and there's no he calls it a two-bit policeman can give me a ticket he says and he he references because mayor vissing had given brother brandham a mayoral privilege to break any speed limit he needed to on his way to an emergency Richard vissing did that called the whole police force if you see that Ford that black Ford Bill brandom driving it don't you ever stop him because I have confidence that he would not be speeding unless he was trying to get to a deathbed or hospital or something like that and brother brandham said now I'm above the law yeah he said the law has no bearing on me that makes sense because I've been brought under the lawgiver and and now I'm part of the lawgiver the law can't apply to me you remember the scripture that said that that he put all things under his feet he said but when he said he put all things under his feet it is accepted in other words there's an exception that it is accepted that he who put all things under his feet is not under his feet because God is going to be all in all it is accepted that I am part of the lawgiver I'm not subject to the law because of the order of MDC you see friends let me just say it it's plain as I possibly can mezc had no father he had no mother he had no beginning of days he had no ending of life he abideth continually a priest because I'm I'm under the order of mezic now it doesn't matter how I was born it doesn't matter how I die and all the chaos in the middle it doesn't count because I'm in the order of MDC I have no beginning I have no ending none of my life counts against me I am redeemed under the blood of the Lamb I have looked God looked at Red through red and sees me white as snow oh Hallelujah friends you don't have to go to that horrible place you don't have to have ghouls coming after you oh you can be Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb there's hope for us tonight can we make it no but in him I've already made it can I overcome it nothing doing but in him I'm already an overcomer let's stand friends life without eternal life is a poor deal that's that's a that is that is so stacked you don't want that because you can't do anything about it you can't fix it you can't escape it you got one destination you got one appointment with large ghoulish looking beings who want to take you like they wanted to take me like they wanted to take this man and this man said goes on I didn't like I said I didn't hear it but he starts talking about how that God the spirit of God rescued him the next thing he knows he was in a hospital being revived and he and he comes back to give his testimony bow your heads all over the audience with me thank God Lord I Thank You For Life and Liberty I thank you for the word father I thank you for your spirit abiding I thank you for our prophetic inspiration in this day to line all of these things out and make it clear oh I'm part of the family in the in m kzdc in that order I'm I'm royal family I'm living under the Royal law of the royal king and I'm headed to a royal world I have a royal life Lord and sometimes father now in our hearts Lord it Grieves us to think when we haven't lived royally Lord with all heads bowed and hearts are bowed and eyes are closed I wonder today friends would you like to speak to the royal king and say Lord I accept you and I'm sorry when I haven't lived royally raise up that hand to him I'll raise up both of mine Lord I'm sorry when I didn't speak royally I didn't act royally I acted like a an Earthling I'm not of this world I'm of a different world and I'm sorry Lord if I haven't followed the Royal law and a royal life and a royal way and a royal [Music] manifestation if it wasn't for red through red being white I would have no chance Prophet tells me I'm not sinless I'm not perfect because I'm sinless I'm perfect in your sight because of Christ so therefore Lord tonight I thank you for life I thank you for the word I thank you for your anointing most of all father I thank you for Jesus Christ I thank you I thank you that you loved so

the road and the will went right across the sidewalk through a guy's fence demolished an entire fence oh boy the guy came outside I mean he was very nice and understanding but the damage it done was so shocking that me and my brother immediately were like man this could have been seriously maed or killed someone yeah much less if we hadn't happened on the 30 mph batter Creek Road a half a mile from where we left from it could have happened on the 21 going 60 oh my goodness so we were just thanking God and the and thanking you know the the gentleman for being understanding and so anyways God was watching out for us so we're very very thankful praise the Lord amen anybody else tonight before we go Lord watches out for us doesn't he amen I remember years ago brother Homer Brown was telling me a story I'll tell you this and let you go he was uh the Lord had sent him to preach late at night and he told the Lord he said 'lord the tires on my car are just about bought I don't know if I can make it all the way there and make it all the way back home and he said but the Lord said no go I want you to I've got it set up want you to call the pastor tell him you're coming and he called the pastor and the Pastor said well it's got to be God he said because I I just couldn't feel what I was going to preach tonight didn't even know and he said and here you're calling me he said yeah come on SO brother Homer went and preached and I'm sitting in a restaurant with him and he's telling me this story and he said on the way back he um it's really late at night and he said he hit this end of a bridge a long bridge he said probably several hundred yards long across the river and he said right as I hit that soon as I got up on the bridge he said it's very narrow and he said right as I hit this end of it a tractor and trailer hit the other end of it coming right at me and he said all of a sudden the left rear tire blew he said I Heard It Go Boom boom and he said all of the sudden the whole car started turning sideways and I'm sliding sideways and this truck is burying right on top of me he just picked up his fork and went back to eating and I said I said I was like brother brother Homer what did you do he said and he put his Fork back down he said well I really didn't know what to do I just yelled out God do something and he said when I yelled that he said the other Tire rear tire boom and he said it pulled the car back this way the truck went by he said I limped off the other end of the bridge and there was an old Service Station closed but he said I knew the man lived behind it he said I went and beat on his door and he felt sorry for me and gave me two new tires from my car and I went on home oh I said brother Homer what what no one could see is when you hit that first end of the bridge there's a a demon standing there and he stabbed and popped your tire but what he didn't know about halfway down there was an angel standing there and right as you slid by he popped the other way either way Chris is the hand of God watching out for us that would have been terrible I mean think of what happened at 30 miles an hour W imagine what would have happened out on a
