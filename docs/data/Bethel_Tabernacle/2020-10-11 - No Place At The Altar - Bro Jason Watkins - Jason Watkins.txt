that's what it's my vote anyway amen so we'll put an anchor on her or pop her car tires whichever works amen so happy to have you on the house of god today i'm looking forward to being here looking forward to pouring my heart out in the word i'm going to invite you to hebrews chapter 13 this morning and while you're turning there i will get some prayer requests that came in to me and let me just make sure i've got them all here hebrews chapter 13. so we want to be in prayer today for the smith family our dear brother harrison oh happy day for our brother do you realize have you ever given any thought to how many days it will take for him just to finish shaking hands i mean just to try to get through the crowd and everybody wanting to greet him so you know i i'm sure they're all there they were waiting on him you know brother ray you know brother ray was the first one to depart from us as an assembly um in all the years we had never had a funeral brother ray was our first one to graduate amen and then we've had so many others you know that have departed from us and i'm sure brother eddie you know was there to wait on him sister betty jean was probably the front of the line brother jesse i mean i mean you know uh uh who who who am i missing uh nathaniel and um sister bonnie that's right amen and um who is it yeah yeah brother eddie and my brother nathan and uh so i was telling sister debbie you know when we got the call i said well here we go again i said well like brother branham said we'll just keep sending them up one at a time till we all go together amen i'm looking forward to all going together amen so amen they he joins the crowd of the lucky rascals amen so happy for brother harrison hey it's you know we do grieve paul didn't deny that we grieve but not like those who have no hope and that's that's the beautiful thing it'll of course be a pain we're remembering the grandchildren remembering uh the children and the daughter-in-laws and so i want to be just remembering that whole family it's in god's perfect will to do it that way you know brother harrison actually got a little extra time with us he he was gone i mean when he had went into renal failure and his kidneys were done he was dying i mean just days away and the lord just healed him up by a miracle he didn't even need nothing just came back and remember that come back among us looked looked like he was 20 years old again so my it was wonderful to give him that little bit of extra time amen to give his to seal his testimony amen and the last thing you know he said to me in this world and sarah confirmed it to me as they were gathered around his bedside as he went home you know that he he knew who his redeemer was amen amen and he was counting on that and trusting in faith and the love of god amen so we want to be praying for the whole smith family um i got an update from sister princess but she sent a correction here a clarification let me just read it real quick um so it's she's she's um okay they did they did step down her oxygen and so she she went from being on a bipap mask to a nasal oxygen tube so the next step from bipap is is a ventilator so instead of going to ventilator she went back down to just nose oxygen so the doctors are saying um that there possibly will be some organ damage but sister princess says but we i'm glad she included all of us we don't claim any of that god is able she is still in icu we want to keep her in prayer this morning i think her name is lisa i think sister princess sent me that so god is moving this mountain one grain of sand at a time and she says we're so thankful continuing in prayer for the finished work brother ronald dean spencer is asking prayer for his assembly they are having another funeral we have service today in a funeral for one of our deacons today this is now three coveted 19 deaths in the last two weeks from our church but then he says we are closer home than we were yesterday amen and he says he also is asking prayer he has several tests being run tomorrow which will take all day in the cancer center he says we continue to thank him for a coming miracle amen i personally count every day a miracle just to enjoy amen brother donnie has asked prayer for sister erica who begins some therapy and scans tomorrow throughout the week they're going to be doing some different things and then scan and then treat and then scan and so sister gene turns in a request for sister joyce duty a friend from way back days and friend from texas and she just got out of the hospital sister mom out of the hospital so um amen we just want to pray for her for continued strength amen i sure appreciate all your prayers for sister debbie she is making progress amen happy to have her here with me today praise the lord and the devil's still fighting her and a little bit of a rough night and a rough morning but you know what i mean hey come on we're going to have to press this thing so i god is broader wow she's millennium's further along than she was just a couple of months ago amen where it looked extremely serious so we're just thanking you for all of that and praying for our strength for my strength i i've been kind of joined at the hip tour as a nurse maid i never had so much fun in all my life it's just wonderful and uh it's really drawn us closer it's taught me some things about divine healing and and the and the trickery of the enemy and i want to preach on that i told my wife i said i'm keeping them i'm keeping a record let me tell you devil's gonna i'm gonna exact the toll on that guy i'm keeping a record and everything the lord is showing me i'm putting it in a file amen and we're going to blow him up before very long amen amen praise the name of the lord all right well that's i think that's uh all of the way of announcements that i had and just asked you to keep me in prayer for guidance in the future oh i do have one other thing uh keep me for uh you know under prayer for guidance because of these you know um uncertain troubling times they're uncertain but yet we have a certain amount of certainty because we know what it's all about and we know who's in control of it but it is unsettling let's just be honest and it's unsettling that we're having to can only have half the church here week by week it's unsettling that we don't have our fellowship hall opened we lived in that thing man wow it's unsettling you know that we can't just turn around and i'm i'm like the poster boy for turn around and shake hands with and we we can only keep it in limited families and man i'm just so chafing against that and so we're just asking the lord to help us there's so much we want to do we've got some ideas about our harvest fest and how we might pull that off so deb is looking sister deborah is looking into that to see on checking around so we might be able to put something together maybe just pray for me will you because i need the leadership of the holy spirit amen there's cases everywhere brother tim pruitt had more than 70 cases in his church and several of them became critical and very close sister ruth is doing good sister karen is doing good she's back home kovitt hit her and she didn't have one symptom but but then she she was having those seizures and then they figured out that's maybe actually healing inside her brain where she had those bleeds and she's in the hospital for a couple days she's back home sister ruth is uh brother timothy's wife is doing much better almost back home so through it all god still gets all the victory amen these are serious things i'd like to just you know throw caution to the wind but i dare not do that we're just trying to move with prudence as we have been doing from the very beginning that's what we made clear to you not operating out of fear i'm not afraid of it um you know but we want to be prudent it would be a great burden on me you know if someone came here to church and caught or spread that horrible virus we've had several cases but none of them were you know from coming to church here different brothers working in the community and what more but the lord preserved us all so amen enough of that let's uh let's get to our scripture uh in hebrews 13 and i'm not going to be able to read that from second corinthians amen i think i wanted to yes okay we'll let you be seated after this verse 9 hebrews 13 and 9. be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines isn't it amazing he would have to say that to the church for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the bodies of those of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come amen let's pray father we're thanking you for the reading of your word today we know that there's life in your word for all who will believe it and we want to confess today that we do believe it and receive it father we have sick requests that are here before us and we have just one other short order of business to finish before we begin our sermon and we're praying that you will meet the needs of these sick and afflicted and and father uh oversee the the next procedural thing that we need to accomplish here we want you to oversee everything lord we want you to oversee all of our lives oversee the word as it goes forth today be with my lips lord may i have nothing to say may i know nothing save jesus christ and him crucified i commit myself to you as your servant standing happily under the blood-stained banner of calvary lord all of our lives now we commit freely willfully and entirely to the blood of christ in jesus name amen if you remain standing just for a moment uh one item that i want to kind of make you aware of is that uh in speaking with the trustees we have currently three trustees and um we have brother mark and brother john and brother charles and because that the the amount of the general fund that is not part of the ministry it's not part of tithing it's just for the general fund of the church which is under the under the direct control of the trustees um because that it is getting to a point now where i felt that maybe it was time to add a fourth brother just for just for um you know for prudence sake and uh just to have a little more accountability uh because the the numbers are starting to to climb to that sufficient level and i thought it would be a good idea i made a recommendation to the trustee board that brother george buckman be added to that team and they with 100 percent unanimous and overwhelming support agreed that that would be wonderful they would love to have his help on the trustees team and i spoke to brother george who took several days to pray about it who didn't make the decision lightly brother george has he won't need on-the-job training because he was a trustee for probably 15 or so years up north at a different assembly so he is an astute businessman a man well known among us of high reputation and regard and has the certainly has has had a great testimony among the saints here for some number of years and so uh with the consent of the trustees we're we're looking to add brother george to that team which will bring us to four uh but because that the trustees are representatives of the people it's different than deacons deacons are an arm of the ministry i choose my deacons and uh because i i have to have the right kind of man that i can work with and because it's ministry deaconing is part of the ministry uh however trustees are representatives of the people to see to the building the upkeep to see keep it from indebtedness of course we've never went into debt for anything we've always paid cash for the purchase the upgrades the increase renovations things we want to do in the future we we looked to maybe we had decided to look and see about building on here doing something different the costs were prohibitive but we do still have some ideas of some improvements to the grounds into the building and the house and the building here so that is underway we'll let you know more about that as that begins to gel but because that trustees are representatives of the people i'd like to give you an opportunity to offer a vote of confidence we're going to ask you to bow your head across the building with all eyes closed and all heads bowed and if if you would like to buy a raised hand let me see your vote of confidence and brother george buchman to join that team raise your hand now yeah that's what i thought bad news brother george you've been overwhelmingly elected amen so thank you god bless you amen we're and we're happy to have you on that team praise the name of the lord all right now god bless you you can be seated amen i want to take my text today i'm getting just a little bit of a late start but don't panic we won't go too long although my family's starting to accuse me of getting a little long but i don't think i am brother dale always said here's what i fear okay here's what i don't as long as it's high octane and you're still pulling sometimes i'll go a little while but brother brother dale in his old redneck cowboy homespun way said brother jason there's no death worse than being drugged to death so we're going to try not to i've always kept that as a motto in the back of my mind lord don't let me drag him to death amen we want to we preach for a reason and a purpose it's not just to hear ourselves talk but we have a burden of the word brother branham called it a burden of the word for the people so we'll i realize i'm starting late so i'll adjust my time accordingly so that we don't keep you here too long it's an important topic the lord placed on my heart we hours of friday morning and i want to take my text my title from the 10th verse we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle i want to take a title this morning no place at the altar no place at the altar there's a lot to be said about that verse and i'm i may come near the end and if i get back to it and the lord leads me i'll begin to break that down a little further but i i i want to just uh preach to you from my heart today can we do that these are these are amazing times that we live in friends and you know i remember years ago a friend of mine preaching a sermon and he took a text out of the book of revelation that every time a seal was opened and one of the four beasts said come and see and he felt inspiration he told me he said he felt that the lord spoke to him and said you know how can the people know me if they can't see me and so i it always stuck with me as a young man just developing my ministry and i i realized that friends we have to be able to detect the movements of god in this age this is a dangerous time this is a serious time this is a time so many things i could just rattle off the top of my head that set this age apart and make it quite unique we realized that this is satan's eden that wasn't even chronologically possible in the alpha church because satan had only had four thousand years and so it would have been kind of a sucker punch from god to only give him four thousand and god took six thousand so the lord gave satan six thousand years to build up his eden like god took to build his and so now you have a prophet comes and preaches a sermon called satan's eden he says things that had never before been true the lid is torn off of hell and demon powers are streaming into the earth that paul prophesied that it would come a time during a perilous time that paul called it perilous but paul goes on to describe how that it would actually get bad enough to where satan himself if you can imagine would be voted in that's my word but would be considered uh the god of this evil age now the reason i say was voted in because satan couldn't just become the god of this evil age because he can't depose the real god he can't overpower god he's been there tried that got some big time beat down trying and so he knows that he can't defeat god in heaven he tried to defeat jesus on the earth took a throttling there as well in the wilderness and so and then and then had his home broken into and had the keys to death and hell stripped from him and all power in heaven and earth was given to the son of god amen aren't you glad that life is now in you aren't you glad that you can say that i and my father are one that's what the devil doesn't want you to believe he doesn't mind you hearing it as long as he can keep you from believing it see so so we find then that that we we have so many things that are unique in this hour we have the convergence never before in history what did the earth suffer under the convergence of the days of noah and the days of lot in the days of noah they faced that like having to face one enemy in the days of lot they only had to face one enemy but we have to face it all around us we now have noah and lot converged on this hour i'm here to tell you something friends you better be glad for a fully restored word it is your only weapon that can defeat the devil every time but now it's one thing for god to give you his word which has power and dunamis dynamites where we get the word dynamite it's what the holy ghost is it's uh if you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and so you know you shall be a witness unto me now that's god's purpose that doesn't mean you'll always accomplish god's purpose because god's not interested in pushing you through a pipe and making you that kind of an overcomer you're going to have to press the battle you're going to there is a mark there is a prize and you need to press towards that so there is a part that we definitely have to play and i i hope i can get to that shortly so we find that the bible is very specific in in this text that paul is saying listen there is there's an altar that we have and it's a spiritual altar in case i don't get back to it let me just give you a a tiny bit of it now it's a spiritual altar and there were people infiltrating the church they who had gotten you know antichrist a spirit had gotten his agents you know they had gotten inside the wire they were actually corrupting the church from the inside and uh and and they were in disguise they looked like christians they came to church and hung out with the with the apostles uh ananias and sapphira got busted in the open because they lied in the open and god settled used them to set an example but there were many more besides those two we find that the spirit of antichrist the bible says i think john says it was already working even in the in the early church fortunately they had the apostles alive paul was still there the alpha the lion anointing of the pure word was able to combat that deception and until they all died off and then as paul feared grievous wolves came in among them not sparing the flock and during this time of this writing to the hebrews you had men and paul's writing to jews to hebrews and he he's specifically saying listen there's there's there's preachers running around that are trying to take us back to the ceremonial they're trying to make christianity ceremonial they're trying to go back you know well okay paul we realize that it's the blood of jesus that cleanses us and i don't need to bring a lamb but hey we do need altars and we do need shrines and we do need this and we do need you know pomp and circumstance to some degree and we kind of got to have a hierarchical order let's get some nicolaitanism going and and paul is just saying listen that you when you do that you're you're not even a christian and in fact you're so not a christian that you don't even have rights to the altar that we have and that altar is a spiritual altar and it's christ now we put an altar out here of sorts with bread and wine which typifies the broken body and the blood of the lord coming in the new testament jesus left it as a symbolism and we and we re repeat that symbolism uh going forward into the new testament ages but we realize that it's not his literal body you're his literal body yes amen that wine's not his literal blood you're the blood of god by the spirit said a prophet so the you you so the so the book of revelation is god's letter to the last day church because it's he's caught to the day of the lord so it opens up with john caught all the way to the end to give us context of who we are how we got here what all the history has been about and what we are to do going forward to finish the task say finish what task get a body change what the first age fell short of and so we find out that that it was it was not going to be the book of revelation was not going to be a record of jesus of nazareth who walk the shores of galilee for that you have the gospels amen but that and and the church of jerusalem and those early churches for that you have the book of acts but this but the book of revelation was not going to be either one of those the book of revelation was going to be that same god now working inside his church that same jesus not a different one working inside his body in the eternal in the ages to come as paul said in the ages to come so we're now able to look back at which almost all of it is history and we're able to see how that god was moving all through the ages he's alpha and omega we found out in our sunday school lesson on the book of revelation that we're going through that the reason brother branham in several places points out that the reason it says alpha and omega but nothing in between it doesn't mention he's in between now he is because you can read that in the book of revelation he was walking in the midst of the seven lamp stands so brother branham wasn't denying he said i'll be with you even in you to the end i'll never leave you so certainly he was in the middle he was in the in between of the alpha and the omega but what it's meaning is is that not everything in the in between was purely him men were starting to pervert the word and add doctrine and add credo and yet christ is able to maneuver his way and still save his family out of each age until we come to the last day amen and everything is cumulative everything all of the all of the treachery and the goal the modus operandi the objective the deceit the plan the scheme everything that satan was trying in the white horse and in the red horse and in the black horse just kept accumulating until it becomes a sickly pale horse thank god when god combated it with the lion everything of the lion accumulated into the man i mean the ox and then from there the man and now to the flying eagle so when the enemy comes in like a flood don't worry god raises a standard higher it's always higher you don't have to worry the flood can't reach you because the standard raises you higher what's never going to be changed is that jesus put satan under his feet and he's now under your feet and that will never ever ever ever did i say ever ever change amen praise god and finally he'll even be destroyed understand this friends that satan's tyranny over god's family is done calvary finished it he resurrected he stripped him of death in hell emptied out paradise satan was powerless to stop him amen so there's where we are we've come now and now this this becomes so important to us because i'm going to look at some scriptures and they're not they're only indirectly related to what i'm preaching on so don't go too far down a rabbit hole i'm just using a specific thing to connect connect a dot all right and and uh and the the illustration i'm trying to show you through several bible passages is that is that there is um just like you have salvation offered to all men but then besides that there's election which is god's redeemable and redeemed family so he offers a legitimate non-facetious chance for every man to save himself he even offered it to king he could never break that pattern he knew cain wouldn't take it but he still had to offer it had to be a legit offering too and so so it wasn't that he was offering cain a revelation because the only one who can get the real revelation is the elect family and the reason the reason for that is because revelation's not a teaching or a doctrine revelation is a happening it's not an understanding it's a happening where some element inside you called a gene of god here's the word which is light flashes on a seed and it comes to life and you've had an experience you might not know the first thing about doctrine but you've already had an experience your brand new creation in christ jesus now that's something that anyone outside of the gene family no one can have that they can god gives them a path to save themselves from destruction and he will save them if they'll meet he told cain look you're there's no way for you to get this revelation it's not in you the revelation is actually already was already in abel when he was born it just was dormant all i did was come to abel and turn it on and abel said wow i need a lamb that that seed came to life and he's simply saying to cain there's nothing in you to click on there's nothing for there's no seed for my light to shine on to bring it to a crop however if you will just do as those and jesus picks it up in matthew 25 if you will just give honor to your brother and find a way in this life to honor who he is and just try your best to do like him and just emulate him i'll grant you eternal life you don't have to worry i got a plan for you you'd think cain would have took that deal not only did he not take that deal he did the polar opposite amen he killed him so he finished himself because you know i mean he stepped beyond all bounds of grace and mercy and there was no coming back from that and so he received a mark and that's the pattern god would use and so all through the scripture you'll find these examples of the of the word of god separating humanity into their respective categories here's one in john chapter 8 verse 34 to 37. jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed i know that ye are abraham's seed physically they were jesus never argued that they actually could prove it it wouldn't have done him any good to argue it they had their own records of their family tree i know you are abraham's seed but now watch him move to something beyond physical it goes down to spiritual but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you amen so now you can see it's not arrogance and saint paul when he says we have a table they don't even have a right to amen if they want to if they want to worry about you know meats and sabbaths and days and legalism and and and they want to earn their salvation that way they want to have some semblance of you know that's that's the mistake my countrymen made they wanted to have a law they wanted to have a part they wanted to have a they wanted to be able to get a report card they wanted to be able to you know have standards we could measure by and paul the whole the good news the good news the good news of the gospel is you don't have to do that anymore you don't have to fight to be of god you can just surrender and he'll he'll turn you into it that's the beauty holy ghost isn't hard to get all you have to do is surrender see and that's why people don't get it because they don't surrender they're happy to surrender all the stuff that's causing them problems but the stuff they like they want to hang on to you'll never get born again doing that it's impossible he'll never give you that because that's where brother branham says the boxcar is not it's not tightly packed he can look that box car's your heart he can look inside there and see that your heart's not correct you're not fully surrendering yet and he will not close the door and seal it see and so so we find out that he says and and so um all right back to our uh verse 37 i know that you're abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you we're preaching today on no place at the altar hebrews chapter 12 formerly in the same letter he's speaking to these same hebrews verse 16 to 17 lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau see paul at this point already knows the church has been infiltrated yes amen he's already aware that the enemies got inside our wire and he's behind enemy lines and we need to we need to start preaching on some of these things all right so so that this isn't a sermon you don't hear peter having to preach like this in the upper room because all 120 people got born again and peter didn't have to spend one second preaching against sin and carnality he could immediately just identify modern events made clear with prophecy and that's that's that's that's when the church is at its zenith when all the people are one for all and everybody has given their heart to the lord and we universally have the holy ghost and we don't stop until we get it amen listen friends uh you know even even here even here we come to a building and we have a building and you know we we have an altar and you know i i get that that these are these are creations that came down through the ages in the early church they they didn't have any of that kind of stuff they just went from house to house breaking bread and preaching the gospel did you know that that the that the uh people of the the local people of the day when they looked at those early christians thought that they weren't even they weren't even godly at all because they didn't go to a temple amen and the jews here here the jews are going over their temples seeing all those christians over there in a big circle out in the field singing and like you're not going into the temple to worship god no we have god in our heart oh that's blasphemy well okay you carry on we'll carry on they didn't even consider them to be holy they considered them unrighteous because they didn't meet in buildings they didn't have altars they didn't have any of that kind of stuff you understand and that become something down through the ages and so we're not trying to reverse it all here i'm not saying hey y'all just meet me in the woods next sunday and we'll forget this church and sell it we're not trying to do that we we we live in 2020 about to be 2021. so you know i i just want to say in whatever the way the devil has stacked it against us how about we prove him wrong and go in a rapture what do you say friends what do we say what do you say we're just proving wrong and and have a mount zion showdown that's what mount zion's showdown means it's who's going in the rapture oh i want to raise both of my hands and say i am how do you know how how do you know the rapture might come without you without you the rapture can't go without me because i am the rapture i'm part of the rapture see so so we find that he says to them you're different you pharisees you're different from me my word you're identified i know you're abraham's children in that way you're just like all the other jews you are like abraham in that way but you're different than abraham was on the inside because abraham rejoiced to see my day and you're trying to assassinate me yes that's right why does my why can you not understand my speech why are my words strange to you see it says because yeah i know listen if you kept on going here after he's confessed that they're abraham's children and it won't take him very long just keep on reading down he'll say here's what it is i was a little polite back there but i'm going to put it on brass tacks you're of your father the devil so let's just know holds barred you're of your father the devil done that's what's wrong that's why you won't hear me all right so he says here in hebrews 12 16 to 17 lest there be any fornicator now he's got to start preaching this way in the church because they're starting to get infiltrated with people who aren't really getting the new birth or profane person as esau who for one morsel of bread sold his birthright see esau was a blood brother but he but but he was different in from jacob in the he was different in a lot of ways he was but what got him was he was different in the most important way in every other way besides the most important way he was a better person than jacob amen if you put him on a report card he got all a's jacob literally got all f's right amen amen but jacob graduated esau didn't what gives because jacob had one thing that was his saving grace he wanted that birthright there was something in him that he probably couldn't even explain to himself hook or crook or however he has to get it he's going to get that birthright amen and so watch for you know verse 17 for you know how that afterward this is esau when he would have he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears so you can see that paul is trying to get the church to to to you know to wake up and realize that you know you can't make yourself anything the only the grace of god can do anything for you and so whatever you do when the grace comes don't reject it because you can't fix it if you do you can't get yourself to heaven you can't save yourself you're going to die unless god gives you grace so when he does take it pass it and you're finished see look at this other comparison just showing you stark differences revelation chapter 20 verse 11-13 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away look at these words and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works i'm often reminding people that no one has ever fully died yet amen and the war men have been laying down and going back to the dust of the earth from where they came for multiple millennia and it's a common thing to hear somebody saying oh he he died you know she died and i'm always if i get the opportunity to say well actually no one's ever died yet they're only held they they died as far as it relates to their human body but the person who lived inside that body still very much alive and their and say well where are they well they're only in one of two places either they're in a paradise of god or they're in a a jail cell bound over for trial right amen and some of them been bound over trial a long time you can't pay bail and get out of that and so we find that that they come up still very much alive and have to face the judge and they're judged out of the book according to the books according to their works verse 13. and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works now really focus your attention on me everybody look this way and just give me your attention listen the reason and i wasn't going to do this but i'm just feeling so pressed on by the holy spirit and i've been had a lot of conversation with the lord about this sermon lord what's the real kernel it's like i've got a lot of stuff here to say but what's what is it you're doing what's your motive what is it what's the objective of this sermon and that's just how it came to me i get those kind ever so often and i i want you to know that one of the reasons that i would read this dire oh this is a this could come out of a a horror story people are being judged and they're about to be sentenced and destroyed and it's so final my goodness the sea gives up the dead and the dead both small and great doesn't matter who they are they're they're standing there and the books are open and what uh what uh what a to do i mean this is big it's so big that that that it's a great white throne and and the face of the earth it's so large the face of the earth and the heavens fled away and there's even found no place for them that's how imposing this scene is amen and all the dead both small and great who have ever lived in the earth by the trillions yes amen amen stood before him and the book was opened and the books were opened and the judgment began and i i i think that the holy spirit is on this one and other ones that i'm going to read for you is to is to combat the how would i describe the age we live in today it's it's it's delusional yeah it's it's it's blase it's it's uh it's ambivalent to to all of this it doesn't even believe this is going to happen you can see that they they some celebrity who gave his or her life to stripping their clothes off and enticing men and women and dancing and vulgar and booze and drugs and sex and out in the open and decrying everything and then when they die they hold a big rally and everybody gets an up on a pulpit like i'm in and says i know he's looking down right now he's not i know she's up there smiling everybody wants to believe that right and i'm not here to dig it in that breaks my heart to see that kind of thing and to say oh i know i know you know oh she's in a better place you know you're in a better place no no no amen how do you know because i read the story that they were drunk off their feet and went to sleep and never woke up amen are they they died in a fiery crash drinking drugging sexing i'm sorry you don't get to go to heaven doing that and while i'm not glad to see anyone perish that way i'm very glad i get to go somewhere where that's not going to exist oh man i'm so glad i'm going to a land where nobody's going to roll up on me with music so loud and grate my nerves i'm not going to have to see nudity on the streets i'm not going to have to hear profanity i'm not going to have to see the madness of politics and the whole world lying to each other and to themselves oh here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come and for people who live that way they have no place at our altar it's not me being cruel me being you know uh uppity it's not me being selective it's not me that made the choice i did the man the person isn't the one that comes predestinated it's the seed of god in me see and so it's the oh there's only one elected son and that's christ and i'm in him so don't be angry at me i'm i'm in that gene pool i'm in that lineage i came from that see and so so we find that that we look at at this terrible scene and they every man judge accordions works revelation 20 and 6 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection hallelujah i love this on such on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years if everybody was going to be that there's little need to put it in the bible amen you understand there's little need to make a differentiation it's it's in the bible like it is because not everybody's going to be that but whoever can believe whoever can receive whoever can surrender you can have you can be kings and priests to god and of christ and reign a thousand years and the second death won't have any power on you imagine being able to be at the great white throne judgment and you're the you're part of a of a of a of a small sliver of humanity who's not the least bit afraid amen amen you're at the you're at the great white throne judgment and you don't have any anxiety any stress any worries there's nothing to think about other than just take your seat so there is a place and a food that paul is saying that we have a right to that no other no one else has a right to and it's not that god you know it's not that we won the lottery and they didn't it's not about that it's about the choices people make people choose the path you are the sum of the choices that you have made [Music] i remember conversations with my brother and i'm not going to speak evil over the dead but he's my brother and i can use him for an example he would say amen today preach it jay yeah you know one time he comes to me and his life is blown to smithereens and he comes to me and he says you know god loves you more than he does me and he really believed that he really believed god had it in for him and that god favored me over him and i said well that's stupid yeah he said well how can you say that look at your life and look at mine i said hey buddy let me tell you something we put our feet under the same supper table yes we slept in the same bed we had the same mom and dad we went to the same church we had the same preachers yeah right you you you were you're 15 i was 15. you're 19 i was 19. you're 25 i was 25. i said the difference in you and me nate is that at every single one of those junctures i was making a different choice than you yeah amen amen and you know what he humbled down and got it he said you're right you know i i deserved i've i've made my life what it is and there wasn't much left of it you know but it wasn't because he didn't have an example set in front of him it wasn't because he didn't have godly parents it wasn't because god hadn't sent him a message he had made the wrong choices god rich in mercy saved him or he wouldn't have been saved because he had mothers and a dad who went to his grave praying for his son he's got brothers got a church i'm here to tell you something friend god rich in mercy hallelujah but let's not fool ourselves god's not out to get you god's out to help you if you will allow him to amen amen but you might not so there's a place there's a table spread and david said he prepares a table in the presence of my enemies if that doesn't show distinction i don't know what does there's a table where david is sitting and it's full of food and there's a table of his enemies and they're not eating they're not welcome at that table who said did david build the table did david put it food no david said god did this god prepared a table for me right in the presence of my enemies [Music] there are tables where the ungodly eat that i have no place to eat there are tables of ungodliness that you have no place to eat so why should you be found there eating amen ask yourself a question deeply today i i was talking to one of the ministering brethren and telling i you know i'm not here today preaching a youth service i'm preaching to everybody but i have the young people in my heart so heavy when i was because they're still at the onset of life they they're still they still can make really good choices to have better results than i did or some of the older ones did and some of the older ones can say to these some of these young ones listen i i went down that trail all it did was get me beaten banged up and i regret it i wish i'd went down this trail [Music] amen so you know the the world has gotten to such a s a place to where righteousness and holiness and godliness and christianity it means so little i'm here today preaching to reestablish the ancient landmarks that there are lines of demarcation there are very there are there are greatly opposite god has a greatly different idea about what holiness is than the devil does and therefore when i if i'm going to preach this accurately and in truth in spirit and in truth then i'm i'm not going to be able to avoid sounding caustic and different than 99.99 of other christian pulpits in the world see but we have to establish and break back i have today i feel like i need to fight back to say hold on god is not some sloppy half gold christian half-baked christian you're a real rugged christian or you're not a christian and you have to take a stand i'm not here to wallow around with the world and eat at their tables their tables are full of vomit what are you doing eating there say it doesn't make a difference it does make a difference you know i i was coming to the church this morning and we're passing by that beautiful new building there on sands point road gorgeous oh thing it's beautiful my heart flutters every time i go by i've got a plan with trustees i said you know we could we could plagiarize we could duplicate that and make this one look just like that one and we might even try to do something like that anyway let me not get off on that it's a beautiful church but you know what what i noticed and now can i say something that's going to sound critical but i'm not being critical we take more for it because when i drove by i didn't feel critical but i noticed that as they're coming people are getting out of their cars very fine looking beautiful people you can tell they're not in their work duds men are in suits women are in nice dresses and but i noticed that all the women are wearing the modern you know half thigh dress yeah that's like five inches above their knees and i thought to myself i thought about the difference i thought about this you know they're gonna go into that church and the whole attitude from the pulpit to the janitor is going to be what a lovely dress how nice you look today and then there's i guarantee you there's also going to be some unholy ghost-filled men going how nice you look today take my word for it a man without the holy ghost is just a brute he's just a brute beast that's the scripture that's peter's words someone without the holy ghost is a brute animal you were too until you got born again you're just a human animal yeah you understand and you'll go by your instincts and brother branham even talks about you know don't fault them you see the man with his booze or his cigarettes he said you know he don't know he he's not converted don't don't condemn him try to help him try to get him to change he said if he don't change that's the only joy he's ever going to have don't even take it from him amen i mean it's not my job to go stand on the street corner and tell everybody they're going to hell odds are a lot of them are yeah but but my job isn't to isn't to try to crush somebody i don't even want to force you into holiness by beating brow beating you from this bullpen i don't want this to be a bully pulpit our deacons aren't interested in making this a police state you understand but but isn't it isn't it a contrast that that that they would go those ladies not speaking against them they're just under misinterpreted theology some fake preacher told him it was okay i feel sorry for them right and brother branham prophesied about that fake preacher said he'll suffer for that in the regions beyond telling those women it didn't matter when it does so i'm not his judge that's what a prophet said they said oh he's not a prophet i said you better hope he's not because if he is you're finished so i get you hoping he's not i get that but i thought about the contrast i thought here is women walking into a church with mid-thigh dresses on that are thought pretty and you sisters get harassed from the pulpit if even your knees are showing yeah amen you get scolded yeah rightly so all right try that again man rightly so you get scolded if even your knees are showing yeah right amen and if you were to come in in one of those kind of dresses we have actually and we know that you know better visitors we have the deacons have a little bit of grace for but if it's somebody that they know knows better and does it anyway listen we have sent women home amen we've asked them to leave and go home and put on some clothes you know what a beautiful thing we did that to one young lady she did she didn't fight cuss jump up and down she just went home put on longer skirt and came back to church came back to church praise the lord i believe that you know and and still love that young woman but listen listen they're not everybody that's been at bethel tabernacle stayed here we've lost young people to the world we've lost middle aged people to the world we've seen marriages break up we've seen people go back on god amen understand uh but but but what i what i feel in my in my heart the holy spirit is trying to get you to understand listen the world may not me the world has watered down holiness they have watered down righteousness they've watered it down to where they i literally i was listening to a podcast a conservative talk show guy i kind of like him a little bit but boy i'm going to have to write him a letter and he's he's on the air saying you know i love my blessed lord jesus christ and he's got all the right lingo and he means it i'm not saying he's being insincere he says i love the lord jesus he's my lord and savior and within the next the next half sentence here comes swear words d this and s that and i didn't even know he would do that on the podcast i'm about to write him a letter and say so who told you you were a christian let me help you you're not and i like you and i don't want to see you go to hell or stay in a tribulation because some some poor excuse for a servant of god told you that that's okay that's part of the blindness of laodicea that's what happened when the two messengers went to sodom they they blinded the people and the you know billy graham and oral roberts so you've got the you've got the evangelicals teaching the world that all you got to do is say i received jesus christ my savior and your you're you're headed for heaven it doesn't matter how you live at all and then you've got the pentecostals saying you know wealth is spirituality and if you're the richer you are you must be a real christian and that's then the world has taken it hook line and sinker and they believe it and so everybody's a christian now and i've ran into that but i'm i i think that when we look into the word of god we have to i want to say to you young people that's not true that's not the gospel right and i i if that sounds hard i'm here to tell you i'm saying it out of love listen i mean if if if you come you know if if you come here's what i would say to you today here let me just put it to you like jesus did when when the 70 left him and they just couldn't stand his preaching anymore they sure love those fishes and loaves amen man they sure love seeing those miracles and getting their sick healed and their dead raised but boy when it came to their lives now they didn't like that and they just said you know we're done we can't handle us anymore we're going away and jesus turns to his disciples why don't you go with them i mean i i i could stand up here today dislike the lord and say you you you sisters you wear a skirt too short and i harass you over it or scold you from the pulpit why do you put up with it why do you stay here why do you let me talk to you like that you come in men men too men got plenty of hang-ups and problems all kinds of carnality and chasing things of the world and and and and young people and parents don't have enough consideration to put to put their lives on hold while they get these kids raised and trained up in the admonition of god instead living their lives at 500 miles an hour while their kids blow in the wind and let's hope they let's hope they land okay amen you understand this is satan's eden do you understand there's never been an evil day like this before do you understand that god didn't put you to end to as their parent to be their buddy he put you there to be their trainer amen amen so okay why do you put up with it why don't you get up and walk out because i can promise you if you wear those kind of things i'm always going to go after it if i see parents like that i'm always church will not be a fun place for you if that's how you're determined to live why do you do it why do you stay here why do you put up with it i'll just say you tell you in the words of jesus will you go also those people over there that church would never come in here i i wouldn't last five minutes in that pulpit preaching like this they'd throw me out immediately so what's wrong with you people y'all crazy or something why do you put up with this kind of a preacher why do you put up with this kind of i'm going to tell you why because you got the same feeling peter had where where else would we go you have the words of eternal life and i'm weak but he's strong and i know i've got problems but i know i don't want to have him i know he's holy and i know i want to be like him so brother jason just preach it and just preach it and just preach it i'm going to tell you something friends i know i i occasionally get a hate mail or hate text for preaching like that but you know what i overwhelmingly get when i go down and preaching like that i get more texts and emails from you and from out there and saying brothers thank you thank you keep preaching it don't ever stop preaching it we need to know the truth we need to know god makes a difference the world with all of their watered down opinions i'm here to tell you they have no place at this table they have no place at this altar they've made up their mind i pray for them i try to witness them i try to live it i i try to live this life in front of them not a compromised version of my life plus their life so i don't offend them what value is not offending them where's the value in that friends you think jesus said i really need to say this but it'll hurt your feelings i'm just not going to say it all right come here let me let me multiply some more fish for you here you go you know god loves you carry on in your sin no he looked him right in the eye and told him what their problem was paul didn't pull any punches peter pulled any punches john didn't pull any punches the the messengers irenaeus didn't pull any punches they come without watered-down nonsense sarinas he called him the sons of satan published it put it in a letter and sent it around the world amen he didn't pull any breath why brother brown chose him he said he's real militant and brother branham chose every messenger based on how similar he was to saint paul amen and they they criticized paul those hypocrite preachers criticized him for how hard he was in his in his preaching in his letters and then they you know it's like oh my goodness the political carnival that we have going on today and one side blames the other side for exactly what they would have done had they been in the same position and this side denies this and they deny that they all know they all do it they're all guilty and and i'm going to tell you something friends the antichrist has ma has managed to give you an illusion of two systems there's only one system it's babylonian it's it's it's a purple curtain and it's in control of both sides don't be fooled you have an illusion of choice the the the prophecy is what's determining things i'm just so glad that i made one choice and i i don't i'm not gonna change my vote for nothing brother branham says and i gotta wind it up here give me 10 minutes started late don't forget give me 10 minutes and that'll put me right at about an hour marriage of the lamb 1962 so many says if the lord will just take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him brother braham says but that's up to you see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things see they overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down i'm glad i can read you elijah's words because that is so powerful that you that i'm so glad i'm not having to say it because then you could kind of doubt it yeah brother jason that's kind of how you feel about it i ain't so sure well i'm not giving you my opinion i'm reading you from a prophet yeah amen and a prophet says i don't care what you think it doesn't matter what i think a prophet says you got to do something they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome here's what he says you have power to do it amen your faith in this message your faith in this word your belief that god has visited us in this day and as you feed on that on that word hallelujah it is literally impregnated with changing power and as you feed on it and faith comes by hearing the word you have the power to to break the cycle of those things in your life but you have to be willing to surrender you must be willing to lay it down you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down speaking of the bread he says she has made herself ready i like that word you see god don't does not push you through a little pipe it's like a mold you put something in a mold close it and take it out and it's formed he said god doesn't push you through a little pipe pull you out on the other end and say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself amen right if you want victory i can't preach you victory i can't live your victory for you neither can mom and dad i'm here to tell you something friends you young people you're you're at the you it just so happens that in the providence of god and in the wisdom of god he decided to place you here at the end of human history amen and as the earth and six thousand years of mankind is about to trend the earth's not ending world's not ending it's just transitioning and you're at a momentous time of transition and i'm here to tell you the scripture is laying down lines of clear demarcation you are not them and they are not you and that is not this and this is not that and i don't care what the world what hollywood has to say what what smiley preachers who have 30 000 people have to say i don't care uh what those two angels had to say they didn't preach to abraham they preached a lot i'm not here to believe that kind of of short coming up short of just saying i'm a message believer you might well be but i'm here to tell you something friends this word has come to change you and make you a different a brand new creation in christ jesus and give you the right to eat from the tree of life hallelujah that's worth it all to me amen blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god let's stand i've got more to say but we'll save it for another time come brother matt bring your team back whatever you like dad whatever brother matt wants to sing this is a a death-defying hour that we've arrived at amen and i think that we need to establish that we are different not because we wanted to be because god made us different i think that we have a obligation to demonstrate to the world that there is a difference you know when i say will you go away also listen some have some have we've got people today that i dedicated as babies who are no longer serving god you know why they made a choice you got to make a choice some of you might be here hearing me today and you might make the same choice to say you know i just want the world and i'm just going to leave and you might do that but i'm here to tell you something that ain't going to stop me praying for you that ain't going to stop parents praying for you and prayer really can do some amazing things [Music] amen prayer can do some amazing things i don't have a single in my heart before the lord i don't have a single young person that i ever preached to in this church or baptize them or dedicate them i don't have a single one that's out there in the world today but what my heart constantly holds the door open keeps the light on and i keep sending up prayers keep sending up prayers lord go get them lord go get them the longer it goes my prayer changes you know and not not so much in my words that i say but it becomes lord
