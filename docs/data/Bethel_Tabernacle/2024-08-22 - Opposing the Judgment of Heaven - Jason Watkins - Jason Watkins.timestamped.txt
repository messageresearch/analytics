[43:13] sent it out today we're going to invite
[43:15] you to Galatians the fth chapter
[43:17] Galatians chapter 5 and we're going to
[43:20] catch verses 16 through
[43:24] 25 okay trying to figure out who that
[43:26] was
[43:27] am man I knew she was pretty but it
[43:29] might had to be
[43:31] Zoe all right honey you can keep up
[43:33] tonight right
[43:36] okay amen sometimes Papa goes fast all
[43:40] right praise the Lord you love the Lord
[43:42] amen praise God I'm happy to be here
[43:45] tonight I um I've thought about this
[43:48] thought um for the last several days and
[43:51] it just seemed like right away this
[43:54] morning it just like exploded on me so
[43:57] amen we'll get as far as we can amen
[43:59] will that be all
[44:00] right Galatians chapter 5 we're taking a
[44:03] title tonight opposing the Judgment of
[44:06] Heaven opposing the Judgment from he of
[44:10] Heaven opposing the Judgment of Heaven
[44:13] Galatians 5 and we begin at verse 16
[44:17] we'll run down through verse
[44:21] 25 this I say
[44:24] then walk in the spirit
[44:27] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[44:29] the flesh man I'll take that deal amen
[44:34] that's the desire of every Christian my
[44:36] goodness it's really it's really that
[44:38] easy according to the Apostle walk in
[44:40] the spirit ah there must be a tremendous
[44:43] amount of power in that walk in the
[44:47] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[44:50] lust of the flesh Lord grant it to us
[44:54] all for the flesh so here's what happen
[44:57] happens when you don't walk in the
[45:00] spirit for the flesh lusteth against the
[45:04] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[45:07] and these are
[45:08] contrary the one to the other and I love
[45:12] the Simplicity of this so that you can
[45:14] not do the things that you
[45:16] would but if you be led of the spirit ye
[45:20] are not under the
[45:22] law now the works of the flesh are
[45:25] manifest which which are these adultery
[45:29] fornication uncleanness
[45:32] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[45:36] hatred variance emulations wrath Strife
[45:40] seditions heresies envyings murders
[45:43] drunkenness reings and such like sound
[45:46] like the world sounds a whole lot like
[45:48] Leo DEA if you ask
[45:51] me of which I tell you
[45:54] before as I have told also told you in
[45:58] time past that they which do such things
[46:02] shall not inherit the kingdom of God I
[46:04] wonder what in the world thinks about
[46:06] that when their when their celebrities
[46:10] die of a overdose or just too much fast
[46:13] living and then they have a big rally
[46:15] and everybody's looking up like they
[46:17] must be looking
[46:18] down and uh they're surely in heaven
[46:21] looking down but I wonder how they
[46:23] imagine that that celebrity who's got
[46:26] every one of these these on a regular
[46:27] basis and suddenly they're somehow in
[46:30] heaven so all right so he
[46:35] says verse
[46:38] 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love
[46:42] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[46:47] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[46:51] against such there is no law and they
[46:54] that are christs have crucified the
[46:58] flesh with the affections and
[47:01] lusts if we live in the
[47:04] spirit let us also walk in the spirit so
[47:10] now if he's telling you
[47:12] that you have to do both then it's
[47:15] obvious you might only do
[47:17] one so you say well how could I live in
[47:20] the spirit and not walk in the spirit
[47:21] well you might be born again of the
[47:23] spirit of God you might be a real for
[47:24] real Christian a for real
[47:27] believer but you're don't you don't
[47:29] design your life to walk effectively
[47:33] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[47:34] and when you do that old flesh is still
[47:38] there
[47:40] amen let's
[47:42] pray father we thank you for your love
[47:45] to us thank you for your word tonight
[47:48] now Lord I'm just depending on you to
[47:50] help me step aside so that you can be
[47:53] the preacher to these people like you
[47:55] have been to me throughout this day Lord
[47:58] I commit myself into your hands for
[48:00] service this is all about you after all
[48:03] Lord this is your plan it's your word
[48:06] it's your kingdom it's your people it's
[48:08] your your whole Vision it's everything
[48:10] Lord For Your Glory father we as Mortals
[48:14] we've been given life well it seems to
[48:17] me that if we've been given Life by a
[48:19] lifegiver we ought to owe him our

[48:24] in this tonight instruct us teach us on
[48:27] this Wednesday night service we commit
[48:28] ourselves into your hands in Jesus name
[48:31] amen God bless you you can be
[48:41] seated I thought that when
[48:44] I began working putting all of this
[48:47] together like I say I had the thought
[48:49] previous but it really began to
[48:52] gel um today last night this morning
[48:56] early in today in my mind and I thought
[49:00] to myself I'm going to come
[49:06] step and the je youth that I really want
[49:10] you to pay extra Keen attention tonight
[49:12] because I'm really wanting to deliver my
[49:15] heart to our young men and young women
[49:18] however studying it I realized that it
[49:20] really is for us all is that all right
[49:23] so maybe you're young at
[49:25] heart he amen even if you're not
[49:27] actually young like brother Luther
[49:29] myself Amen brother Charles amen but
[49:32] you're young at heart amen so I I'm I'm
[49:36] getting younger did you know that oh I
[49:39] promise you I'm getting younger sister
[49:41] Jean's actually getting younger not
[49:42] older amen praise the Lord that's good
[49:45] news for
[49:47] us you know I I thought about this as a
[49:52] as a as a kind of a
[49:55] subtopic tonight and I and the subtopic
[49:58] if I were to choose one I would have I
[50:01] would have chosen true godliness versus
[50:07] superficial
[50:09] imitation and it really begs the
[50:12] question how can you really tell the
[50:14] difference between true
[50:18] godliness and a superficial imitation
[50:21] because imitation can look like the true
[50:24] I mean counterfeits fo a lot of people
[50:28] counterfeits can fool the government
[50:31] counterfeits can even fool Machinery if
[50:33] it's done correctly and so there is uh
[50:38] an imitation or what brother brandham
[50:40] the word brother brandham chose was an
[50:43] impersonation of
[50:45] Christianity so now that's not my my my
[50:48] whole theme tonight it's just a subtopic
[50:51] that I want to launch on when we're
[50:54] taking this T topic upon opposing the
[50:57] Judgment of heaven so I thought about
[51:00] what could be some some things some good
[51:02] things some worthy things some notable
[51:05] things to look for in comparison when
[51:08] we're trying to far it out what is true
[51:11] godliness from the impersonation which
[51:14] can look an awful lot like it and so I
[51:17] thought about you know brother bam talks
[51:19] a lot about motives and objectives now
[51:22] it's of course it's possible and I can I
[51:24] I'm not preaching on it tonight but I
[51:26] could give you several examples how you
[51:29] actually can be very sincere and be
[51:31] sincerely wrong you can absolutely have
[51:34] a very good motive and a very good
[51:36] objective you know your your objective
[51:38] is where it is you're trying to get to
[51:40] and your motive is why are you doing it
[51:42] why are you going from here to there
[51:44] what's your purpose and you can have a
[51:47] tremendous motive a tremendous objective
[51:51] but yet be outside of the line and the
[51:55] Order of God's word let me just give you
[51:58] an example for clarity's sake it is it
[52:02] is
[52:03] outside it is a wonderful thing if a
[52:07] wife and a mother wants to be spiritual
[52:12] and wants to be a prayer Warrior and
[52:14] wants to really shake heaven with prayer
[52:17] that is value
[52:20] Priceless however that can be her
[52:23] absolute pure motive and her absolute
[52:26] objetive Ive but if she's deciding to
[52:28] stay up all night so that the next day
[52:31] she can't fix food for her children see
[52:35] to the needs of her husband then she's
[52:37] got a great motive and a great objective
[52:39] but she's outside of the line in order
[52:42] of how God wants her to carry it
[52:44] out make sense a number of examples I
[52:47] could give you that's one of my oldie
[52:49] Goldies that I come back to again and
[52:51] again I could give you examples of men
[52:54] it's wonderful brothers if you want to
[52:57] give to missions and give to the poor
[52:59] and spread the gospel around the world
[53:01] but don't don't give them um you know
[53:04] Dominion Energy's power bill
[53:07] money that belongs to Dominion Energy
[53:10] you promised them that you would pay the
[53:12] bill when it came in see so so we
[53:15] realize we can have all kinds of
[53:17] wonderful things that we want to do but
[53:20] we also have to be decent people
[53:22] law-abiding citizens and we have to we
[53:25] have to function in uh within the
[53:27] guidelines of God's word man i' unlocked
[53:30] y'all down goodness gracious I'm going
[53:33] to tell some jokes amen get everybody
[53:35] moving
[53:37] again I don't even know how I got on
[53:39] that it's not in my notes so don't hurl
[53:42] something at me but but motives are good
[53:45] you know is the person's godliness
[53:48] motivated by a sincere desire to honor
[53:52] God that's a good metric you can look at
[53:54] when you're trying to differentiate
[53:56] between true godliness and uh and the
[53:58] impersonation of Christianity what's the
[54:01] real motive is it really a desire to
[54:03] honor God and serve God and serve others
[54:06] mind you you know or or because you say
[54:10] Well when is it not that oh my goodness
[54:12] friends it the world is filled with
[54:15] people who want to be charlatans who
[54:18] want to be preachers just for money and
[54:20] popularity there's people who want to
[54:22] who they always want recognition they
[54:24] they want status they want personal gain
[54:28] and uh you know so so a lot of times you
[54:30] can see what appears to be true
[54:35] godliness but when you look at the
[54:36] motive behind it you go man see I don't
[54:40] think God can get behind that we talk
[54:42] often about fruits of the spirit we read
[54:44] them in Paul's fifth chapter of
[54:46] Galatians so does the person's life bear
[54:50] the true fruit of the spirit that we
[54:52] read such things as love and joy and
[54:55] peace and patience and kindness and
[54:57] godliness and faithfulness and
[54:59] gentleness and here's a big one
[55:01] especially in
[55:02] leoda
[55:05] self-control the reason that's such a
[55:07] big one in Le is because there's so many
[55:09] things built to control
[55:11] you so that you don't
[55:14] self-control and if you're really a
[55:17] Christian with the spirit of God in you
[55:19] you want to be able to take the Holy
[55:21] Spirit and control this flesh as Paul
[55:24] said I bring it under
[55:26] subjection because I promise you it
[55:29] won't stay there if you don't bring it
[55:32] under subjection see this is why we
[55:35] bring every thought subject to the Holy
[55:38] Spirit brother brandom you know we we
[55:41] talk about you know some sometimes
[55:44] people you know when that when you start
[55:46] to look at the fruits of their Spirit
[55:48] you don't see a lot of patience and
[55:50] faithfulness and and self-control
[55:53] sometimes you see negative traits like
[55:56] like instead of selflessness you see
[55:58] selfishness you see pride you see
[56:01] criticism brother brandham said this and
[56:03] show us the father and it'll satisfy
[56:06] Amen to that the Bible said now this is
[56:09] amazing watch this now it's what the
[56:11] prophet taught us the Bible says and he
[56:13] goes back you're you're Gods amateur
[56:18] Gods see you're Gods because here's why
[56:22] not that you elected yourself to be or
[56:24] won a election or decide to be or went
[56:27] out and did some great deed you are
[56:30] God's because you're part of God you're
[56:33] Sons and Daughters of God yes you are
[56:36] see I love how he throws that in there
[56:38] in case you kind of went I don't know
[56:39] about me yes you
[56:41] are see you're a part of him and you
[56:45] become a Creator isn't that
[56:48] beautiful now how many want to put it to
[56:50] use all right here you go here's your
[56:53] best way to put it to use he says let me
[56:55] give you a little little speck now what
[56:57] you're going to put to use that you have
[56:58] creation power brother R said you got
[57:01] enough power in you to create a whole
[57:02] world and go live on it that's the lot
[57:05] so brother random says let me give you a
[57:07] little speck of light just in a minute
[57:09] just a minute now now he just told you
[57:11] you're you're you're god you're an
[57:13] amateur God because you're part of him
[57:14] you become a Creator you are a Creator
[57:18] yourself did did you ever see people
[57:20] that was nice
[57:22] people though you just couldn't be
[57:24] around them hardly something about them
[57:25] you just couldn't stand now brother
[57:27] Brandon is a Christian but he's
[57:29] acknowledging there's some people you
[57:30] don't want to be around they're nice
[57:32] people but you don't want to be around
[57:34] them did you ever see and then he watch
[57:35] him flip it did you ever see people that
[57:38] you just love to be around did you ever
[57:40] see them kind of people that's the
[57:44] atmosphere that they create themselves
[57:48] amen amen you're
[57:51] creators yeah that's an atmosphere that
[57:54] you create your
[57:56] so I'll ask you today what are you
[57:58] creating what you been creating lately
[58:00] what' you create today when somebody cut
[58:03] you off in
[58:04] traffic lock everybody down again
[58:06] brother Ben what' you create today when
[58:09] somebody didn't look at you the right
[58:10] way or speak to you the right way what
[58:12] did you what did you turn on your
[58:14] creation machine and
[58:17] do remember they don't have creation
[58:19] machine only you do you're Sons and
[58:21] Daughters of God I believe that if
[58:23] you're a Christian there ought to be
[58:25] consistency if if you're not an
[58:27] impersonation of Christianity if you're
[58:29] genuinely Godly then there then that
[58:33] speaks to me of consistency if the
[58:35] person's godliness is consistent across
[58:39] all the areas of their life because
[58:42] sometimes friends we can act one way in
[58:44] public and another way in
[58:47] private and we might as well admit it
[58:50] you know so you know so um you know then
[58:54] then there there's humility I don't to
[58:56] get bogged down right here when I'm
[58:57] trying to get out of the gate there's
[58:59] humility I think humility is a good a
[59:01] good metric to a good barometer of
[59:04] whether somebody's truly Godly or
[59:06] whether this is a uh uh what brother
[59:09] brandham called it impersonation we
[59:11] called it a superficial limitation same
[59:13] thing uh so there's humility you know
[59:16] does the person
[59:18] acknowledge their own sinfulness and
[59:22] their need for
[59:24] Grace see or do they sadly boy have I
[59:29] seen this all too quickly forget what
[59:33] the Lord so graciously save them
[59:37] from come on come
[59:41] on you see
[59:44] so I I'm afraid you know brother Ernie
[59:46] vill used to say the army of God is the
[59:48] only army in the world that ever kills
[59:50] its own
[59:52] wounded is it you know friends sometimes
[59:54] we have to ask ourselves
[59:56] if we're not impersonating Christianity
[59:58] and we really are True Believers then I
[1:00:01] just think that godliness real true
[1:00:04] godliness wouldn't send me on fault
[1:00:06] finding
[1:00:07] missions now not fact finding missions
[1:00:10] because uh but fault finding missions
[1:00:13] when you're on a looking for faults
[1:00:15] facts don't mean much to you see and so
[1:00:18] now now you could say well well but but
[1:00:21] but they're sinning and and they're too
[1:00:23] carnal well okay
[1:00:26] maybe so maybe so but you know I thought
[1:00:30] about today I thought I remembered St
[1:00:32] Paul you remember over in Romans 2 when
[1:00:36] they the church had those Believers
[1:00:37] coming in they' just been you know just
[1:00:40] barbaric that brother brandom said we
[1:00:42] were you know with a club on our back
[1:00:44] the Jews were you know they were used to
[1:00:46] serving God and you get all these these
[1:00:49] heathens that come into the church and
[1:00:51] man the Jews just wanted to slice and
[1:00:53] dice them and Paul goes back there and
[1:00:56] and I and and I went and I looked at my
[1:00:58] uh my J my jwv version on Romans 2:4 I
[1:01:02] wondered I couldn't remember what how
[1:01:03] I'd said that but I remembered it was in
[1:01:04] Romans 2 and here's how it translated
[1:01:07] don't you realize is what Paul was
[1:01:09] saying to them don't you realize how
[1:01:12] kind tolerant and patient God is with
[1:01:15] you or don't you care can't you see how
[1:01:19] kind he has been in giving you
[1:01:23] time to turn from your sin see so you
[1:01:28] know he had to remind impatient
[1:01:30] Believers about their short-term
[1:01:32] memories of their own past failures we
[1:01:35] don't want none of that come on friends
[1:01:38] we're all in this together it's all for
[1:01:40] one and one for all
[1:01:44] see so you know when we when we think of
[1:01:48] it in that
[1:01:49] regard I think that we are to I mean
[1:01:53] listen can I can I say it like this that
[1:01:55] God's family has plenty of of God's
[1:01:58] preacher core pounding on them without
[1:02:00] them needing you to pound on
[1:02:03] them can I remind you of that they get
[1:02:06] pounded on Plenty by God's preacher core
[1:02:08] they don't need you pounding on them
[1:02:10] turn around your neighbor and say God
[1:02:12] bless you amen now not b not bless your
[1:02:15] heart don't don't say bless your heart
[1:02:18] cuz that don't mean nothing that's a
[1:02:20] southern thing brother Ben but God bless
[1:02:23] you brother brandom said it's the nicest
[1:02:25] thing
[1:02:26] you could ever say don't it feel good it
[1:02:28] feels good to say it it feels good to
[1:02:30] hear somebody say it
[1:02:33] amen so you know what God has
[1:02:38] approved um I think that God has been
[1:02:43] very
[1:02:44] faithful to always have his word
[1:02:48] represented in the
[1:02:51] earth uh I think you can rely on him God
[1:02:54] is very reliable brother brandham said
[1:02:56] God take you know takes his man but
[1:02:58] never his Spirit Satan does the same
[1:03:00] thing takes his Spirit takes his man but
[1:03:02] never his Spirit but God you know he's
[1:03:04] trustworthy he is consistent and you can
[1:03:08] rely on him to always have his word
[1:03:12] represented in the earth now you know
[1:03:15] because I mean when you think about it
[1:03:17] at the great white Throne judgment you
[1:03:19] know what's going to be his measuring
[1:03:21] standard well Paul said it's the gospel
[1:03:24] I preach yes well then that's the word
[1:03:27] of God then who is it that eats the book
[1:03:30] the word of God but the bride and she's
[1:03:33] now become the Living Word brother
[1:03:34] brandham said when the book is closed
[1:03:36] for the last time the word will be
[1:03:38] flesh so he's going to have the word
[1:03:41] sitting on the throne who were
[1:03:43] Overcomers who believed the word fed on
[1:03:45] the word became the
[1:03:47] word so the the there be nobody that's
[1:03:51] why I've said over and over and over
[1:03:52] again you go to Matthew 25 go to the
[1:03:54] Book of Revelation you don't find people
[1:03:57] who are condemned at that judgment bar
[1:03:59] crying foul right am nobody's holding
[1:04:03] signs nobody's marching
[1:04:06] see so so that being the case friends
[1:04:09] that God is very trustworthy and
[1:04:12] consistent to always have his word
[1:04:15] represented correctly somewhere in the
[1:04:17] earth then one would have thought that
[1:04:20] you know whatever God approved man would
[1:04:23] instantly accept I mean that seems
[1:04:25] logical to to me surely whatever the
[1:04:29] Creator approved
[1:04:32] of wouldn't man immediately go okay see
[1:04:38] I mean that that as as Joseph Parker
[1:04:41] from the late 1800 said he would be
[1:04:44] ashamed to put his opinion in opposition
[1:04:47] to the Judgment of
[1:04:50] Heaven see I mean is that a reasonable
[1:04:53] assumption I think it is that whatever
[1:04:57] received God's approval would be
[1:05:00] immediately embraced by man that's what
[1:05:03] I think is that what you think that's
[1:05:05] what makes sense to me
[1:05:07] see um but is it what we
[1:05:13] see is there anything friends think with
[1:05:16] me now it's just a Wednesday night I'm
[1:05:18] just I'm just just just going along
[1:05:21] trying to deliver my heart to you is
[1:05:25] there anything in
[1:05:28] today's socially
[1:05:31] politically correct um what they call
[1:05:35] Norms they're normal would there be
[1:05:38] anything in these socially correct Norms
[1:05:40] where Humanity seems embarrassed to
[1:05:44] contradict Heaven's judgment with their
[1:05:45] own their own opinion do you see anybody
[1:05:47] embarrassed to do
[1:05:50] that the approval of God should
[1:05:53] command instant acceptance from mankind
[1:05:57] he ought to feel
[1:05:59] ashamed to oppose his opinion to the
[1:06:02] Judgment of Heaven is it just me or do
[1:06:05] people seem to be running a million
[1:06:07] miles an hour away from that and it's
[1:06:09] getting worse with every age in every
[1:06:12] passing day I think so is it prophetic I
[1:06:16] believe it is I believe that's part of
[1:06:19] what Paul was talking about in the
[1:06:21] perilous times that would come at the
[1:06:22] end time men would be lovers of pleasure
[1:06:25] more than lovers of God didn't say they
[1:06:27] didn't love God just said they love
[1:06:30] pleasure more than they loved
[1:06:34] God in second Timothy um D give it to me
[1:06:39] honey 2 Timothy 3:5 I wasn't going to
[1:06:42] read it but I think I will here Paul
[1:06:44] discusses an end time what I'm going to
[1:06:47] call a human anomaly in which people
[1:06:51] will actually display a form of
[1:06:54] godliness but it will will not be
[1:06:58] authentic and that's a prophecy 2
[1:07:00] Timothy 3:5 if you can't oh there we go
[1:07:03] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:07:05] the power and brother brandham takes off
[1:07:07] on that denying the power he connects it
[1:07:09] to Faith In other words where God is
[1:07:12] more to you than just a a book of rules
[1:07:15] and and regs it's just you know the
[1:07:17] Bible's more than a spec book to you the
[1:07:20] the it the Bible is something alive to
[1:07:22] you the word of God is a living thing to
[1:07:25] you you care about the word see and so
[1:07:30] Paul thank you honey Paul discusses Paul
[1:07:34] discusses this end time human
[1:07:37] anomaly where there's a form of
[1:07:39] godliness but it's not actually
[1:07:41] authentic so how then do we
[1:07:43] differentiate uh a close
[1:07:47] approximation of godliness how how do
[1:07:50] you differentiate that close
[1:07:52] approximation from the real thing a mere
[1:07:54] form of God liness that's not exactly
[1:07:57] the general the the the the the genuine
[1:08:02] article there seems to me to be only one
[1:08:05] reliable measuring standard and this is
[1:08:09] where when brother Brenham took it to
[1:08:11] here it make it makes such sense to me
[1:08:14] as a student of the Bible as a preacher
[1:08:17] of the Gospel that the only real
[1:08:19] measuring standard is is do
[1:08:23] you have an amen to every word do do you
[1:08:27] have a full
[1:08:29] acceptance of the word for your
[1:08:34] day for the day in which you live
[1:08:37] because I mean come on friends all of
[1:08:39] those what what what was the list we had
[1:08:43] um motivation fruits
[1:08:47] consistency humility I mean all of those
[1:08:51] displays all of those gifts all of those
[1:08:54] attributes can be impersonated let's
[1:08:57] just be real they can be impersonated
[1:09:00] see uh I mean it it it can all be
[1:09:04] impersonated and I mean if you look you
[1:09:07] know in the Bible that we see although
[1:09:09] it it it's came through a through
[1:09:12] through through 2,000 years you know uh
[1:09:15] fractured and deluded through 2,000
[1:09:18] years of theological confusion the
[1:09:21] scripture promises us that the original
[1:09:24] gospel truth will be Faithfully restored
[1:09:29] at the end time to do what to prepare a
[1:09:31] bride to prepare her to do what to
[1:09:35] receive the dead in Christ at the
[1:09:37] resurrection to meet the Lord in the air
[1:09:40] how many would like to do that
[1:09:43] see do we have room in our busy schedule
[1:09:45] for the
[1:09:50] Rapture you know I mean there's a lot of
[1:09:53] things of you know that that that help
[1:09:57] us get to the Rapture that we don't seem
[1:09:58] to prioritize too much amen
[1:10:02] amen so you know I I don't think a busy
[1:10:04] schedule should keep you from being
[1:10:07] spiritual I think you ought to do
[1:10:09] whatever you got to do to make sure
[1:10:10] you're spiritual because if you walk in
[1:10:12] the spirit and live by the spirit you
[1:10:14] won't follow and into the weaknesses of
[1:10:17] the Flesh and that's a pretty good
[1:10:20] deal you're actually getting prepared
[1:10:23] and it's a it's a it's interesting to me
[1:10:26] people sometimes the priorities they set
[1:10:30] amen I'm actually not here to preach a
[1:10:32] critical sermon tonight I'm trying to to
[1:10:34] encourage us but we got to look at the
[1:10:35] real
[1:10:37] world we got to we I mean if you can't
[1:10:39] say Amen say Oh Me Oh My you know it's
[1:10:43] not my brother or my sister I promise
[1:10:45] you it's not the people in front of you
[1:10:46] beside you or behind you going to keep
[1:10:48] you out of a Rapture it's you if anybody
[1:10:50] keeps you out it'll be you if anybody
[1:10:52] hinders your faith it's going to be you
[1:10:54] if anybody causes your your prayers to
[1:10:56] not go higher than the ceiling it ain't
[1:10:58] me it ain't your brother or your sister
[1:11:00] it's you we have seen the enemy and it
[1:11:02] is US amen see amen Jesus said in Mark
[1:11:08] uh 12 and 30 let's have that one Zoe
[1:11:12] Mark 1230 here's a great promise the
[1:11:15] Lord's
[1:11:16] speaking and the the question comes up
[1:11:19] about you know what's the first of the
[1:11:22] the greatest Commandments right you're
[1:11:24] familiar everybody since your days of
[1:11:26] Sunday school you're familiar with with
[1:11:28] this one and Jesus said Thou shalt love
[1:11:32] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[1:11:36] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[1:11:40] am I reading the Bible and with all thy
[1:11:44] strength this is the first commandment
[1:11:47] so I propose friends that that once you
[1:11:50] know the gospel has been fully restored
[1:11:54] uh in your day then then you become
[1:11:56] obligated uh to have it applied in your
[1:11:59] life and willfully
[1:12:02] willingly obey
[1:12:04] it I mean am I crazy am I have I gone
[1:12:07] into left field tonight we're Believers
[1:12:10] right I know this contrary to the world
[1:12:13] that says just do what you want to do
[1:12:14] and whatever feels good do it and there
[1:12:16] are you know there are no morals there's
[1:12:18] nothing there's no right there's no
[1:12:20] wrong there's not even male and female
[1:12:21] anymore I mean the whole world has made
[1:12:24] everything relative it's relative to
[1:12:26] what you think you got no thought coming
[1:12:28] at all not even a little one amen this
[1:12:31] is the only thing that we live our lives
[1:12:33] by this is the standard I can't help
[1:12:35] what the woke college campuses are
[1:12:37] teaching this is the standard I can't
[1:12:40] help what political uh stumps and
[1:12:42] speeches say this is the
[1:12:45] standard there's no other standard
[1:12:48] that's right see amen there's nothing to
[1:12:51] to describe what a Christian is but this
[1:12:53] book there's nothing to describe and and
[1:12:56] give instruction how marriages should
[1:12:58] work in the place of the man the place
[1:12:59] of the of the wife this is the only
[1:13:02] guide book see so when we look at it
[1:13:05] like that you find that you know once
[1:13:09] you know it's here and once you know the
[1:13:11] word has been restored then I think we
[1:13:13] become obligated to follow it and not
[1:13:16] just you know from kind of say it like
[1:13:19] this from not just your heart everybody
[1:13:23] everybody oh it's in my heart you know
[1:13:25] and people think lovely thoughts about
[1:13:27] Christ you know that's that's one of the
[1:13:30] pro the prophets in the Old Testament I
[1:13:31] don't remember which one it was now um I
[1:13:35] want to say it's Jeremiah but I can't
[1:13:37] remember one of here's a problem he had
[1:13:40] that he was preaching and preaching and
[1:13:43] nobody's
[1:13:44] listening and he he got troubled and he
[1:13:48] you know he's talking to the Lord nobody
[1:13:50] will listen they they won't listen to
[1:13:52] what I'm saying and you know what the
[1:13:53] Lord told him Lord Lord gave
[1:13:55] the Lord kind of outed all Society to
[1:13:58] him and the Lord said the reason that
[1:14:00] they won't listen to you is because they
[1:14:02] just think of your sermons as a lovely
[1:14:04] song they think you're a good
[1:14:06] singer and and they just think that when
[1:14:08] you're preaching oh isn't he a wonderful
[1:14:11] singer and his words are just a lovely
[1:14:13] song and they don't know that those
[1:14:15] lovely songs was speaking their
[1:14:19] doom and so I you know it's not just you
[1:14:23] know when we when we say that we
[1:14:25] willfully follow him it's it's from not
[1:14:27] just your heart or a lovely thought
[1:14:29] about Christ but the whole thing as
[1:14:32] Jesus said with all thy heart and with
[1:14:35] all thy soul and with all thy mind and
[1:14:38] with all thy strength this is the first
[1:14:42] commandment people don't like a gospel
[1:14:45] with Commandments in it in the 21st
[1:14:48] century but but you know never mind that
[1:14:50] full obedience entitles you to the Token
[1:14:53] GL amen
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] see brother brandham says in the Church
[1:14:59] of the Living God
[1:15:01] 1951 I'm going to watch my time tonight
[1:15:04] I promise man I looked at my iPad when I
[1:15:06] broke it out today to get it charged up
[1:15:08] and it was down to like 50% I said my
[1:15:11] goodness how long did I preach on Sunday
[1:15:13] I've never drained it down to 50% like
[1:15:16] that so amen my apologies I I don't even
[1:15:19] know how long I preached amen praise the
[1:15:22] Lord so brother brandham says the Church
[1:15:24] of from the Church of the Living God
[1:15:29] 1951 he says speaking of God said when I
[1:15:32] come will I find faith and brother
[1:15:35] brandham said he never questioned
[1:15:36] whether he would find righteousness or
[1:15:38] whether he would find Christians I think
[1:15:40] we might have read this recently never
[1:15:43] he never questioned whether he would
[1:15:45] find righteousness I mean if nothing
[1:15:47] else there's a form of
[1:15:49] godliness and so or whether he would
[1:15:51] find Christians there's all kinds of
[1:15:53] Christians brother brandham said who
[1:15:54] aren't CHR Christians of the spirit
[1:15:56] they've just made a a mental agreement
[1:15:59] uh with with a historical event see and
[1:16:02] so he said he never questioned whether
[1:16:04] he would find that but would he find
[1:16:07] faith when he returned knowing that that
[1:16:11] would be one thing people would let go
[1:16:14] on hearing and now now watch what he
[1:16:16] ties it to hearing also the Holy Spirit
[1:16:20] speaking in the last days that how these
[1:16:24] times would come come when men would
[1:16:26] have a form of godliness but would deny
[1:16:30] the power and brother brandham said
[1:16:32] There It Is lack of faith lack of faith
[1:16:35] lack of real power and we and he says
[1:16:38] here we thank thee Lord tonight because
[1:16:40] that inner Hearts now listen to a
[1:16:42] Prophet come down to come down and be a
[1:16:44] human with all of us we thank thee Lord
[1:16:47] tonight because that in our hearts we
[1:16:50] feel that we have just a little faith
[1:16:53] and help us Lord that that Faith may be
[1:16:56] increased tonight until it be so high so
[1:17:01] lost in complete surrender to Christ
[1:17:03] until Great and Mighty Works will be
[1:17:06] shown tonight I'd like to see some Great
[1:17:09] and Mighty Works shown tonight I'd like
[1:17:11] to see a whole church in one mind and in
[1:17:14] one Accord and I'd like to see everybody
[1:17:17] from our young people to our old people
[1:17:18] serving God with a
[1:17:23] passion see I don't want to wait till
[1:17:25] Sunday how about tonight I don't want to
[1:17:27] wait till the next Revival I young
[1:17:29] people don't wait till next Camp brother
[1:17:32] brandom called that a campstar don't
[1:17:34] just be a campstar you go into the
[1:17:37] shikina go behind the veil go into the
[1:17:40] presence live there be a third realm
[1:17:43] dweller see so how about tonight
[1:17:48] friends it's so it's faith in the
[1:17:51] restored word alone everything else can
[1:17:53] be impersonated it's faith
[1:17:55] in the restored word alone that brings
[1:17:57] real
[1:17:58] overcoming power not your certainly not
[1:18:02] your works of going to church or doing
[1:18:04] good deeds it's not your labors see and
[1:18:08] and it's certainly not any man-made
[1:18:10] religious system or organization those
[1:18:13] man-made systems can never produce an
[1:18:15] acceptable sacrifice for God it's
[1:18:17] impossible because they're built their
[1:18:20] their whole Foundation is built on seeds
[1:18:22] of discrepancy see so every seed brings
[1:18:26] forth of its kind that's nature that's
[1:18:28] nature every seed brings forth of its
[1:18:30] kind so if you've got a foundation
[1:18:33] that's built on a mized version of this
[1:18:35] then what are you going to grow see so
[1:18:38] so only the Original Seed can produce
[1:18:41] the original life that that that's
[1:18:43] that's nature that's what the Bible says
[1:18:46] you know I I I become fond of saying
[1:18:48] this trust the
[1:18:51] scienceall I know it's not the one that
[1:18:53] they that they mean and they say that at
[1:18:55] a political rally but we're not at a
[1:18:57] political rally we're in a church
[1:18:58] service and I want to say to you tonight
[1:19:00] there was no greater scientist than the
[1:19:02] author of this book so trust the science
[1:19:05] you cannot find wholesome life when
[1:19:08] you're feeding on a mongrelized seed and
[1:19:11] partly that it that it's a seed of
[1:19:13] discrepancy it will grow discrepancies
[1:19:15] in your life it's impossible for it not
[1:19:18] to
[1:19:20] see so it's Faith because at the end of
[1:19:23] the day friends it's going to to be God
[1:19:25] accepting your faith in him which is the
[1:19:28] same as saying in his word for he is his
[1:19:34] word I remember brother brandham told
[1:19:37] that story you've all heard it
[1:19:41] where talked about a faithful a faithful
[1:19:44] son you know he's got a a pond he wants
[1:19:47] to go swimming in his daddy says to him
[1:19:50] son Gator's in that pond stay out of it
[1:19:53] he said now if had boys got any sense
[1:19:55] and loves his daddy he'll stay out of
[1:19:56] that pond because there's Gators in
[1:19:59] there who aren't going to respect
[1:20:01] persons they don't care that he's an
[1:20:02] innocent little
[1:20:04] boy so so we realize that modern
[1:20:07] Christianity you know I I I can say this
[1:20:10] because I've dealt with it
[1:20:11] enough uh modern
[1:20:14] Christianity most any denomination they
[1:20:17] don't really have uh so much of a severe
[1:20:21] problem saying that God and his word are
[1:20:25] the same you know well I mean be pretty
[1:20:28] hard to deny once you've read John 1:1
[1:20:31] in the beginning was the word it was
[1:20:33] with God and it was God and then verse
[1:20:35] 14 it was made flesh so it so people say
[1:20:39] well I love Jesus well Jesus is his word
[1:20:42] so do you love the historical idea of
[1:20:44] who he was or do you actually love the
[1:20:45] one that's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:48] forever so you know so they they they
[1:20:51] don't they don't really have a severe
[1:20:53] problem
[1:20:55] when brother bradam you know or when you
[1:20:57] would come today and say well God and
[1:20:59] His word you know are the same and uh
[1:21:04] you know but as soon as you say that it
[1:21:08] must be more than faith in a man on a
[1:21:12] cross that it and you say it must go on
[1:21:15] to faith in his word then they go now
[1:21:18] wait a
[1:21:19] minute well he is his word they're the
[1:21:22] same okay well then you got to have more
[1:21:25] than just a a mental uh acceptance of a
[1:21:28] historical event you got to have faith
[1:21:30] in his word how do you have faith in him
[1:21:32] and don't have faith in his word how do
[1:21:35] you have faith in him because he is his
[1:21:37] word and brother Brandon went around the
[1:21:39] world making that simple unchallengeable
[1:21:42] Point see and so you know but but but
[1:21:46] you always hear the same thing oh you're
[1:21:48] taking the Bible too literally you know
[1:21:50] just join our church it doesn't really
[1:21:52] matter how you live in your personal
[1:21:53] life Young people don't swim in that
[1:21:56] pond don't swim in that pond my goodness
[1:21:59] don't don't ever swim there if you're
[1:22:02] swimming in a pond like that get out of
[1:22:05] it amen and parents don't don't don't
[1:22:07] take your children swimming in that
[1:22:10] pond Hallelujah and there's more there's
[1:22:13] more kinds of a of those kinds of pond
[1:22:15] than just than just churches my goodness
[1:22:18] uh and the things we expose our children
[1:22:20] to can I say this to you as a dad and as
[1:22:23] a grandpa let a gator get a hold hold of
[1:22:24] your child's leg one time cuz he was
[1:22:27] swimming in a pond and you had him in
[1:22:28] there and you were swimming with him and
[1:22:30] a gator Come and you got out and he got
[1:22:32] a hold of your child's leg it's going to
[1:22:35] be a lot harder to get his leg out of
[1:22:37] that
[1:22:39] mouth see you might you might even pull
[1:22:42] it off but the damage that's going to be
[1:22:45] done see so you know you might but it
[1:22:49] won't be easy and why did you ever take
[1:22:51] him swimming there in the first place my
[1:22:53] goodness take your
[1:22:55] children right when they're oh my young
[1:22:59] and innocent and super impressionable
[1:23:03] and set them down in the big middle of
[1:23:05] these horrible public schools and and
[1:23:07] then you see that they get connected
[1:23:09] into all the right Social Circles and
[1:23:11] the social scenes of popularity you you
[1:23:14] load them up and you load up your home
[1:23:15] with worldly entertainments you you you
[1:23:18] don't realize that you're teaching them
[1:23:19] parents by your own lifestyle that those
[1:23:22] things are more important than having
[1:23:24] the word of God swn into their young
[1:23:27] hearts I'm sorry if that offends you I'm
[1:23:29] sorry on the internet if that offends
[1:23:31] you that's the
[1:23:32] truth
[1:23:34] see I just say we need to break this
[1:23:36] generational
[1:23:37] backsliding break it seems to be it seem
[1:23:41] to me it see the backsliding seems to be
[1:23:43] more and more with every passing
[1:23:45] generation and and I just say that we
[1:23:48] need to break that generational
[1:23:51] backsliding Hallelujah it Waters down a
[1:23:54] Mighty prophet's message to the world
[1:23:56] reverse course friends reverse course
[1:23:59] and and get yourself ready for a
[1:24:01] catching away you want to do something
[1:24:03] productive get your children ready for a
[1:24:05] catching away thank God it's never too
[1:24:08] late never too late it's never too late
[1:24:10] thank God it's never too late Hallelujah
[1:24:14] make up your mind I would say it to you
[1:24:16] tonight make up your mind don't wait for
[1:24:18] another service don't wait for another
[1:24:20] Revival makeup brother Bram said I want
[1:24:22] to see it tonight make up your mind in
[1:24:25] this service tonight start your family
[1:24:27] home on the right direction listen
[1:24:29] friends we're marching to
[1:24:34] Zion Romans 10 Zoe Romans 10 we're going
[1:24:38] to catch verses 1 to
[1:24:40] 4 this all
[1:24:43] right not angry I just I'm just full of
[1:24:46] zeal
[1:24:50] tonight Revelation 10 1:4 brethren
[1:24:55] my heart's desire and prayer to God for
[1:24:57] Israel is that they might be saved for I
[1:25:01] bear them record that they have a Zeal
[1:25:03] of God but not according to knowledge
[1:25:06] for they being ignorant of God's
[1:25:07] righteousness and going about to
[1:25:10] establish their own righteousness have
[1:25:11] not submitted themselves unto the
[1:25:14] righteousness of God
[1:25:17] so catch this fourth verse for Christ is
[1:25:20] the end of the law for righteousness to
[1:25:22] everyone that that does what believe it
[1:25:25] everyone that
[1:25:27] believeth so let me let me just reread
[1:25:29] this fourth verse to you in my own way
[1:25:32] for Christ in a Believer ends the method
[1:25:37] of gaining righteousness through keeping
[1:25:39] rituals and precepts of the Old
[1:25:42] Testament law every true Christian see
[1:25:46] you're free of that you don't and that
[1:25:48] was the problem that those Jews were
[1:25:50] trying to hang on to that system it was
[1:25:53] a it was a it was a man system and you
[1:25:56] say well I thought God with his own
[1:25:59] finger and wrote it in but but God only
[1:26:01] did that that was never God's idea that
[1:26:03] was Israel's idea brother brandham says
[1:26:04] it's the most irrational thing they ever
[1:26:06] did they asked for a law when they had a
[1:26:08] prophet and they had a pillar of fire
[1:26:10] and they had all of these things and the
[1:26:11] angel of the Lord and they wanted a law
[1:26:14] so that they could keep it
[1:26:17] see so you know this is this is actually
[1:26:21] I don't know if you've ever given it
[1:26:22] much thought
[1:26:25] but this is
[1:26:27] exactly what
[1:26:29] necessitated from the Garden of Eden
[1:26:31] from the fall in the Garden of Eden it
[1:26:35] necessitated
[1:26:37] Paradise because Paradise was not in
[1:26:39] heaven Paradise in the lower parts of
[1:26:41] the earth Paradise Paradise was a it was
[1:26:44] not in the torments of Hell there was a
[1:26:47] great golf at the edge of hell and a
[1:26:49] great Gulf fixed that no one could cross
[1:26:52] and the Rich Young Ruler when he died he
[1:26:55] saw Abraham on the other side and he saw
[1:26:57] Lazarus who he had stepped over many
[1:26:59] times begging at his
[1:27:01] gate so it's a very real place brother
[1:27:04] brandham talk talks about it you know
[1:27:06] when they saw Jesus coming and the other
[1:27:08] one you know Ezekiel said that's the one
[1:27:10] I Saw the Wheel in the middle of a wheel
[1:27:12] and Abraham said that's the one I saw
[1:27:14] and they met me on the plains of memory
[1:27:15] and the other one said that's the one I
[1:27:16] saw and this and that's the one I saw
[1:27:18] and Isaiah said that's the one I saw
[1:27:20] high and lifted up Hallelujah and so so
[1:27:23] we know that par I was a very real place
[1:27:26] because because the the the the the
[1:27:29] family of God could not come into the
[1:27:31] presence of
[1:27:33] God because the Lamb of God hadn't been
[1:27:35] slain and they they they could be good
[1:27:38] people they could even keep the law of
[1:27:40] Moses meticulously but the the closest
[1:27:43] they you know they didn't go to hell but
[1:27:46] neither did they go into the realm where
[1:27:47] God is they didn't even go into the
[1:27:49] sixth Dimension they they well that
[1:27:51] could stand correction because that's
[1:27:53] that's the kind of a broad statement but
[1:27:55] we know that under the altar of God
[1:27:57] there's various places and not here
[1:27:59] trying to teach on Dimensions tonight
[1:28:01] I've never thought that through but I
[1:28:03] know that they were not in hell and I
[1:28:04] know that they were not with God they
[1:28:06] were in paradise and Jesus went down and
[1:28:10] preached to souls in prison and then
[1:28:12] took the keys from Satan and you
[1:28:15] remember brother Josh said he broke my
[1:28:17] door I love that door and he broke my
[1:28:20] door we were having a good time and he'
[1:28:22] kicked the door in and brother brand him
[1:28:24] said he took Satan said he he body
[1:28:26] slammed him and brother R said that he
[1:28:28] said he slammed him on the ground and he
[1:28:30] put his foot on his neck and reached and
[1:28:31] jerked the keys of death Hell In The
[1:28:33] Grave off his hip and he went over and
[1:28:35] he and the Bible says he led captivity
[1:28:38] captive he that ascended was the same
[1:28:40] who first descended into the lower parts
[1:28:42] of the earth see and then he come up out
[1:28:45] of their own Resurrection morning and
[1:28:47] they all came with him see and there's
[1:28:48] where brother Brandon picks up the story
[1:28:51] that he went they went marching off to
[1:28:52] glory and they went down Glory Road and
[1:28:54] made a turn at Hallelujah Avenue you
[1:28:56] remember they come up to the gate and
[1:28:58] and there all this throng of people
[1:29:00] since the days of Adam and Eve all the
[1:29:02] way now and and they said open up the
[1:29:04] gates and the and you know let the king
[1:29:06] of glory come in here was Christ leading
[1:29:09] and the angels call back because you
[1:29:11] know we got to have the secret word here
[1:29:13] who is who is it you know what are they
[1:29:15] asking for what is Christ you know what
[1:29:17] my answer is he's the
[1:29:19] word wh which one do you believe I
[1:29:21] believe the word say Do you believe the
[1:29:24] man on the tree that he was the word
[1:29:26] before he was the man on the
[1:29:28] tree see that's why Jesus said it that
[1:29:32] that if you believe my word see that's
[1:29:35] the first prerequisite that he had see
[1:29:38] then you have then you shall never die
[1:29:41] he that heareth and believeth see so so
[1:29:44] we realize then that that he leads them
[1:29:47] down Hallelujah Avenue and and says
[1:29:49] father here they're yours you know my my
[1:29:52] my blood is is on on the cross and I I
[1:29:55] purchased them and I I paid the price
[1:29:57] and and now they're actually gone
[1:29:59] brother benam said they're gone into the
[1:30:01] into the into the realm where God is
[1:30:03] that's even higher than the than those
[1:30:06] that brother Brandon went to in the
[1:30:07] sixth Dimension under his Altar and said
[1:30:09] we want to see Jesus said he's up higher
[1:30:11] he's not the only one up
[1:30:13] higher see so so we realize that that
[1:30:17] this paradise exists for that reason
[1:30:20] because that no matter how righteously
[1:30:23] they kept the rules and regs they could
[1:30:26] not go into the presence of God brother
[1:30:30] brandham says in questions and answers
[1:30:34] 1964 he said that's the reason we have
[1:30:37] the troubles we do of married four or
[1:30:39] five times and this and that and all
[1:30:41] kinds of sin and adulteries and
[1:30:43] everything else along in our lives is
[1:30:45] because of those things we are
[1:30:49] carnal and that part must perish that's
[1:30:52] your flesh that part must must
[1:30:54] perish but then inside we are a spirit
[1:30:57] man and then he goes further inside of
[1:31:00] that a soul inside and that's faith in
[1:31:04] God's word then we bring our outside
[1:31:08] body under subjection to the word by
[1:31:11] Faith by accepting what he said now
[1:31:16] that's that's faith in the word
[1:31:19] 101 what I just read you because that's
[1:31:21] what Paul taught that's Faith 101 one is
[1:31:24] that you're believing the word of God
[1:31:26] you're receiving the word of God you're
[1:31:28] saying Amen to the word in your hour and
[1:31:31] that's that's faith in God see so so
[1:31:36] from the Bible knowledge commentary it
[1:31:38] talks about that this this thought that
[1:31:41] we read here in in where we we read from
[1:31:43] Paul's uh words in in the Book of
[1:31:46] Romans that that that crucial to Paul's
[1:31:50] this was what was crucial to Paul's EX
[1:31:54] explanation of Israel's
[1:31:56] stumbling that that what Israel wanted
[1:31:59] to do is they wanted to keep using the
[1:32:03] system of the law they do the they do
[1:32:06] the same to this day the the Jews do
[1:32:09] they're still to this day they want to
[1:32:10] use that system see and there's a
[1:32:13] there's a veil over them and so they're
[1:32:15] blind to it and so but but and in fact
[1:32:17] his friends that's that's exactly going
[1:32:20] to
[1:32:21] be the message of Moses and Elijah when
[1:32:25] they go to the
[1:32:26] 144,000 the system doesn't work you got
[1:32:30] to come to Christ we tried to get you to
[1:32:32] do it 2,000 years ago you wouldn't do it
[1:32:35] but now he's offering 144,000 and that's
[1:32:38] the ministry of Moses and
[1:32:41] Elijah oh my you know what they're going
[1:32:43] to do they're going to pick up right
[1:32:44] where Paul left off Hallelujah that's
[1:32:46] what William brandham did for the
[1:32:48] Gentiles this is what he tried to tell
[1:32:50] those Pentecostals you can't use a
[1:32:53] system of man it doesn't work Pentecost
[1:32:57] is an experience how many know that it's
[1:33:00] being born again into the kingdom of God
[1:33:03] this is the literally the message of
[1:33:05] Moses and Elijah to True Israel and it's
[1:33:08] exactly the same message to the true
[1:33:10] Gentile bride you know what that message
[1:33:12] is come out of her my
[1:33:14] people that's the very thing they'll say
[1:33:17] to those 144,000 come out of these
[1:33:19] systems don't be up here trying to offer
[1:33:22] a red he I don't care if it's red over
[1:33:24] right inside and out it's of no value
[1:33:26] you got a manora you got a temple you
[1:33:28] got this you got the pots it's worthless
[1:33:31] all of that stuff was only pointing to a
[1:33:33] real
[1:33:34] person see and so so so then so then
[1:33:39] Christ then as as Paul taught us Christ
[1:33:42] is the end of the
[1:33:44] law so that so that there may be
[1:33:47] righteousness for everyone who believes
[1:33:50] see who believes his word all right so
[1:33:53] that in fact is the word translated end
[1:33:56] in the Greek means that Christ is the
[1:33:59] designed end he's the termination or
[1:34:03] he's the purpose goal of the law now
[1:34:07] Galatians 3 Zoe Galatians 3 I'm going to
[1:34:09] try to get finished up here I don't have
[1:34:12] too much more so you still with
[1:34:14] me Galatians 3:21 to
[1:34:19] 26 Paul's
[1:34:21] reasoning is the law then against the
[1:34:24] promises of God verse 21 God forbid for
[1:34:28] if there had if there had been a law
[1:34:31] given which could have given life verily
[1:34:34] righteousness should have been by the
[1:34:36] law so hey if there was
[1:34:39] denominationalism can sometimes seem
[1:34:41] like a good idea and if there would have
[1:34:43] been a system that man could have
[1:34:45] invented and the Holy Ghost could have
[1:34:46] stayed over the top of it then then you
[1:34:49] know the Holy Ghost could have come
[1:34:50] through that system but that's not the
[1:34:52] case the whole fact that when men create
[1:34:56] it and oversee it the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:58] pushed out see so he so he says you know
[1:35:02] if there had been one that had given
[1:35:04] life verily righteousness should have
[1:35:06] been by the law but the scripture hath
[1:35:08] concluded all under sin that the Promise
[1:35:12] by faith of Jesus Christ might be given
[1:35:14] to them that believe so what's it all
[1:35:16] about and and and and and why do they
[1:35:18] have a law for 1,600 years verse 23 but
[1:35:23] before before Faith came here's the
[1:35:25] reason here's why they had it for 1600
[1:35:27] years but before Faith came we were kept
[1:35:31] under the law shut up unto the faith
[1:35:34] which should come afterwards be which
[1:35:36] should afterwards be revealed verse 24
[1:35:39] wherefore the law was our school Master
[1:35:43] oh okay now I understand 1 1600 years of
[1:35:48] animal sacrifice it was our school
[1:35:50] Master to bring us to Christ that we
[1:35:53] might be justified by faith because
[1:35:56] friends that was the only thing that was
[1:35:59] ever going to work you
[1:36:01] know work to do what to redeem them that
[1:36:05] was the only way to redeem us back to
[1:36:08] God back to where we came from do you
[1:36:11] believe you came from him then it's the
[1:36:13] only way you've got to come to Christ
[1:36:16] you've got to come to the word in order
[1:36:18] to be
[1:36:19] redeemed you can live a Christian
[1:36:22] lifestyle and not even beor born again
[1:36:24] and you'll get some blessings out of
[1:36:26] that but if you want to be redeemed I'm
[1:36:28] not here to just get blessings Ruth
[1:36:30] wasn't satisfied with just handfuls of
[1:36:32] blessing she wanted Boaz cuz she know if
[1:36:35] she got Boaz she got the whole
[1:36:39] field see verse
[1:36:41] 25 but after that faith is come we are
[1:36:45] no longer under a school Master see so
[1:36:48] we're not chasing works and ritual and
[1:36:50] we're not we're certainly not being a
[1:36:52] part of a religious system of man verse
[1:36:54] 26 for ye are all children of God by
[1:36:57] faith in Christ Jesus and again we come
[1:37:00] back to it again and again and again
[1:37:02] Christ is his word see so thank you Zoe
[1:37:07] so so in one way let let me some let me
[1:37:09] sum up this this
[1:37:11] way so it it kind of works backwards in
[1:37:15] a
[1:37:16] way like almost like a reverse dominoes
[1:37:19] one I'm meaning that one leads to the
[1:37:21] next and then one precedes the the
[1:37:24] former what one you get this one you got
[1:37:26] something preceded that you got
[1:37:27] something that followed that
[1:37:29] amen so we're working it backwards he
[1:37:32] added the
[1:37:34] law first for he added it for
[1:37:36] transgressions the Bible teaches us that
[1:37:39] so that they actually became
[1:37:42] culpable because now they actually know
[1:37:45] better remember Paul said before I knew
[1:37:47] it was wrong to do this I couldn't be
[1:37:50] convicted of the sin of it because I
[1:37:52] didn't know it was wrong am but then the
[1:37:54] law told me it was wrong and now you say
[1:37:57] well isn't that a good thing no it's
[1:37:59] horrible because I'm in born in sin I
[1:38:02] can't equal it so I got no chance so the
[1:38:05] law Paul said the law that was for my
[1:38:07] good for my for my life the devil used
[1:38:10] it and manipulated it and now it's
[1:38:12] killing me that which was good he said
[1:38:15] was the law bad no God forbid you don't
[1:38:17] say that the law was good it was meant
[1:38:18] for Life the law wasn't the problem the
[1:38:21] problem was you and I we were un we were
[1:38:23] unregenerate we were born in sin and we
[1:38:26] had to come to a new birth see so he
[1:38:30] added law for transgressions then they
[1:38:33] became responsible because now they know
[1:38:35] better good grief it's written down in a
[1:38:37] book called the law and and so at the
[1:38:40] same time he he also gave them the law
[1:38:43] to prove to them they couldn't keep it
[1:38:47] see that they would have to eventually
[1:38:51] rely on faith in the Lamb of
[1:38:54] God we've had 2,000 years of churches
[1:38:58] and churches and churches but but there
[1:39:01] was always the promise that at the end
[1:39:03] time he would come back Christ in the
[1:39:06] fullness of his word and now the whole
[1:39:08] world is culpable because they know it's
[1:39:10] there they can see the truth of it in
[1:39:12] your life and in my life and but but
[1:39:14] that's not my concern they'll have to
[1:39:16] answer to God for that I got one concern
[1:39:18] I'm marching to Zion I want the whole
[1:39:20] word in my life I I want to be born
[1:39:23] again the spirit of God I don't just
[1:39:24] want to believe true
[1:39:26] Doctrine
[1:39:28] see so this was actually that John's
[1:39:31] message repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:39:33] is at hand you know the Lamb of God as
[1:39:35] we were saying Sunday he said the Lamb
[1:39:37] of God is among you now the and and and
[1:39:39] how will you know him the Holy Ghost
[1:39:41] will identify him see so God was never
[1:39:46] going to let that system continue
[1:39:48] because because he couldn't redeem his
[1:39:50] family that way you understand he was
[1:39:53] never going to allow he he added it for
[1:39:56] transgressions he did it to prove to him
[1:39:58] they couldn't keep it but he was never
[1:40:00] going to let that system continue
[1:40:03] because even he knew he couldn't redeem
[1:40:06] his family that way and he was always
[1:40:09] going to redeem them he wasn't doing it
[1:40:12] for a law for 1600 years he was always
[1:40:14] going to redeem them God didn't spend
[1:40:17] 2,000 years to see me in a
[1:40:19] denominational Barnyard he brought a
[1:40:22] message to Redeem
[1:40:24] Me Hallelujah it wasn't about just about
[1:40:28] compliance and and never having a
[1:40:30] stumble uh he was always going to redeem
[1:40:33] them we always are going to
[1:40:36] stumble so compliance was you know when
[1:40:40] we talk about it being
[1:40:42] required I mean we've we spent the first
[1:40:46] half of this sermon showing that if
[1:40:48] you're a real Christian you you will be
[1:40:51] be obligated to the word because you
[1:40:54] want to be because that's what changes
[1:40:56] your inside nature and that's the guy
[1:40:58] got sick of fighting that's the guy that
[1:41:00] wanted to serve God but he just he
[1:41:02] wasn't in a position of authority until
[1:41:04] I got born again and now that Holy
[1:41:06] Spirit is in authority and now the
[1:41:08] greatest battle is between him and this
[1:41:10] flesh and I'm pulling for the Holy Ghost
[1:41:14] come on Holy Ghost give it to him
[1:41:16] whatever you got to do
[1:41:19] hallelujah amen and so it's not about
[1:41:22] perfect comp compliance which the law
[1:41:25] you know uh my even if you did keep it
[1:41:29] you were the problem was you were born
[1:41:30] in sin see and that's the same thing
[1:41:33] that's true today and can I say this
[1:41:35] today you're born in sin so there there
[1:41:39] really is no amount of message
[1:41:41] compliance that can redeem
[1:41:43] you it's not about that it's about
[1:41:47] falling in love with the person of the
[1:41:49] message not a rules and regulations book
[1:41:52] it's about you dying and him coming
[1:41:55] alive you died willingly he wouldn't he
[1:41:57] wouldn't Force you but you just said
[1:41:59] Lord I don't want to be me anymore I
[1:42:01] want to be you once I see his word I
[1:42:04] want I want it for me I want it for my
[1:42:06] family I wanted it for my children I
[1:42:08] want it for my grandchildren I want it
[1:42:09] for this whole church I want it for our
[1:42:11] young people our old people our single
[1:42:12] people our married people I want you to
[1:42:14] be filled with the spirit of God
[1:42:17] hallelujah you must be born again by
[1:42:20] faith in the revealed word of this hour
[1:42:23] the hour of his second coming because
[1:42:26] he's doing it exactly like he did at his
[1:42:28] first coming it's faith in his word that
[1:42:31] was faith in him can I say that really
[1:42:34] strong faith in him is Faith in his
[1:42:37] word don't ever lose sight of that
[1:42:41] see cooperating you know with a man-made
[1:42:45] system of religion can never bring you
[1:42:47] back into his presence as I said that's
[1:42:50] why Paradise was built it was a
[1:42:53] temporary holding place I mean none of
[1:42:57] God's family could ever go back into his
[1:43:00] presence
[1:43:02] everything
[1:43:06] everything everything was in a perfect
[1:43:10] stalemate
[1:43:12] salate Satan didn't have them but
[1:43:16] neither did
[1:43:17] God you
[1:43:19] understand
[1:43:21] before the New Birth came came by the
[1:43:24] baptism of the Holy
[1:43:26] Ghost Satan didn't have them but neither
[1:43:30] did God they were in a perfect
[1:43:34] stalemate to see who would blink
[1:43:37] first

[1:43:48] Jehovah amen preview of coming
[1:43:50] attractions

[1:44:11] choose the Zeal of the Holy Spirit what
[1:44:14] is the Zeal of the holy spirit it's that
[1:44:15] spirit that wants to turn you into
