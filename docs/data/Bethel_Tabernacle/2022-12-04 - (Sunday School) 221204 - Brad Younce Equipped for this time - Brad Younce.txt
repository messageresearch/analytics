========================================
foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign good morning you happy to be in the house of the Lord I'm always happy when he said it's time for us to get ready to go to church I'm always glad it's one of my favorite times of the week it's the highlight of the week and when we get to come to the house of God I need to highlight my week when I have to come up here and stand but as usual you know how they are they they like to get you about 9 30. say oh yeah we need a Sunday school teacher this morning so I'm going to be your student teacher in a little chat this morning we had talked about we're all students of the Gospel and that we're just we're just student teachers let's all stand for a word of Prayer we have a lot of sick people out today we just want to remember all of those that's unable to be in the house of the Lord father we just thank you for this opportunity to come back in his house once again Lord father we don't want to take these times for granted Lord we we want to be able to come here as many times those doors are open father Lord I just pray God may you be with this little service this morning Lord be with those that are sick at home God you know who they are father Lord I just pray may you just give them a strength in her body may you give them a quick healing father Lord may you be with us today in his service Lord I pray in Jesus name amen in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 or 1 1 verse and then we'll uh that should be seated it says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil may God add a blessing you can have your seats this is one of those I started just a few weeks ago putting this in the title for this thing is equipped for this time and I just left it along after a couple other brothers started preaching on this and the weapons and you know how that is brother Caleb and you say well I had to put that away from somewhere else but when it come up this morning I didn't quickly answer and I started looking through all my notes and I'm like and it's pop that at me I'm I'm like I'm not done with it but so well I mean we'll just we'll just go with it so we know we quipped the word equipped is uh I gotta find it first is to furnish for service or action equip an army to dress to make ready prepare so we're actually in a battle this ain't a picnic we're in when I got a little box of chicken and headed down here to the lake and or to the beach and we're not we're not on a picnic this is a battle before we fight not against each other against principalities against Powers you know he quit for this time it's like an eagle they're equipped for how high they can fly a little a normal bird can't go as high as that eagle because that eagle is equipped to Fly Above they can soar up and if a hawk or anybody try to anything tries to go up they'll just disintegrate they can't go the Eagles equipped to go that high it's like the astronauts they're equipped airplane pilots can't go they're not trained to go into astronaut age if y'all get the point but they're trained to take off to the Moon these astronauts are they're equipped for this they're equipped for this it's just like uh a martyr back in the early days they were equipped how can you stand there and watch your wife the Belly being ripped out how can you stand there and watch and not say a word and say I'm not going to back down from this thing they were equipped for that just like you're equipped to stand in this day we're probably we may not have to give our lives but there's other things that we have to do it's just as just as bad as what they went through we've got to be equipped for this but this is Moses wasn't equipped until he went to the wilderness he tried to just kill one Egyptian but it they didn't they were ready for follow him all he did was kill one person and he got scared and ran so he had to go into the Wilderness to be tried trained so when you come back 40 years later I don't hope it don't take us 40 years to get ready or we got to be ready in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we've got to be equipped for this we're a quit for the rapture we're a quit for it it's going to take a special something special to lift us up off this Earth our flesh bodies ain't gonna be able to do it you know in the Book of Esther we often be very familiar with the story where Haman he just didn't like the Jews he didn't like them so he tried everything he did he can to get them killed so he had the king make out this decree that we're going to kill these people in a certain day well Esther sees Mordecai out there why is he in mourning and so he tells her he said you're going to have to do something and she's like I can't go into the king until he calls me he says but you're going to have to because when it's time for the Jews to get killed you're going to get killed as well because you're a Jew he says how do you know that you weren't put in that position for such a time as this my how do you know you're not put here on this Earth for such a time as this Esther was equipped we know all her training she went through she went through the seven Church ages she was trained to go in before the king so when she walks around into the throne room the king says come the king says come she was equipped he held out the Sepulcher we coming through the throne room God hands out his Sepulcher to you you're equipped for this time what a special people we are whoa back over in the Ephesians chapter 6 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God this put this put on is to be clothed in to have on to be endued Hallelujah go into the upper room until you be endued with power from on high put on put on this armor of God Hallelujah close with clothing be in Deuter array to be clothed in to sink into it's like you when you got ready for church you got all dressed up you slid the code in you were clothed in you put it on that's what we got to do with this armor we've got to put it on Hallelujah you have to armor the fighting it has to protect yourself the armor of God is what he has provided for every Christian Soldier yeah it ain't mean you're gonna get a little pistol and you're gonna go start fighting you don't have a real sword we got something better than that this right here we're not slaying flesh people we're after the devil we've got the sword of the word we're not a weak back Christian we're not no weak Christians we're not going to barely make it through we're a strong Army brother Brown said God's going to choose for his army the best weapon that could be given and he chose it and it was his word God gave his army the best equipment that he could ever use and ever could use and would never have to change it the devil's always changing his tactics he's always upgraded his Arsenal God's has been the same since the beginning Jesus went to the Wilderness to show you how to beat the devil Hallelujah no matter how many things Satan gets oh he has more things to use today than he had when we was young people if we had to if we want to sneak around listen to rock music we had to get our little big headphones our little walkmans and carry around our big cases of full of our tapes [Laughter] some of you telling how old you are but now you stick your headphone in we ain't got a clue what they're listening to the tactics of the devil let your parents think you listen to Christian music once you grab the headphones of the kids one day and say what are you listening to see what they act [Applause] God is so good tactics of the devil wow Mercy a person he's all the armor to fight the battle of the Lord and if he likes one of these weapons that God has appointed you're defeated if we don't have us if we have the sword but we ain't got the shield we have nothing to protect us my goodness we're not running for the devil we know this armor it always protects the front I probably said it before they don't have armor on the back of the soldiers they're not made to turn around and run Hallelujah Luke 4 24 49 behold I send the promising to you and Terry into Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high Romans 13 11 they know on the time that now is high time to wake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand it's Daybreak hallelujah it's Daybreak I'm feeling good for now is our Salvation the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of the darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and drunkenness and chambering or wantness or Strife or eminent but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof Colossians 3 10 and a half put on the new man put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness and humbleness of mine and meekness and long-suffering for bearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you also do ye and above all things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness my goodness Ephesians 6 11 put on the armor of God that ye may be able to stand Against The Wiles of the devil the word wise means traced out with a method well laid out art skill cunning cutting devices spoke of it just a minute ago The Wiles or the Devils or the various arts and strategies which he employs to drag Souls down the hill my goodness trying the same thing he did to Eve false prophets will arise deceiving the people saying this word is not right wow but he don't carry open Warfare the devil doesn't Fight Fair he ain't gonna fight you face to face he can't but he's gonna sneak around in the bushes looking around at you trying to sneak up on you catch you at your weakest moment might be 12 o'clock at night or one o'clock in the morning when everybody's asleep my goodness that's a pastor's job oh he just promised us a life full of joy no more fighting a lot of people's left this message to say how free they are we're free yeah you're free you're free to do whatever you want to but you're always a slave to something [Music] I can't I can't think of no better thing to be than a slave to Jesus Christ I don't want to be a slave to this world you're not free You Think You Are they don't like the rules and regulations that they call it a message thank God for the rules I don't mind the rules when you got the Holy Ghost it's easy to follow it's like just like walking in here and sitting down it's just as easy for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual witness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day to stand against to oppose resist are you resisting stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and have it on the breastplate of righteousness you got your breastplate on we don't have time to go into all of that have your feet shod with the preparation of gospel of peace above all take the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked to Candle it that's what quench is to Kindle it to put it out all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word praying always with all power prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for the Saints we have to be watching constantly guarding ourselves studying the devil he studies you so why don't we study the devil let's find out what the devil knows about us because he knows you better you know yourself he knows what bothers you I might not know it brother Jason's Minister both may not know what bothers you but the devil knows and he'll try to use every thing against you everything my goodness why do you wire armor because we're in a state of warfare we are fighting numerous enemies 200 000 demons was released out of the rear Euphrates we're fighting I've said it before I like to say it again just let the devil know it don't matter how many he has against us how many fighting against us it's not enough if God could open our eyes like Elisha was praying for his servant open his eyes up Lord let him see there's more for us than against us if God could open up our spiritual lives this morning what would be lying in the walls of this building what would we see in that other dimension believe the preaching the brother Matt yeah oh Hallelujah we got the strength we've got the armor there's so many things you say about the armor a lot of things you say about this armor we need it we need it we can't fight nothing without this armor yeah here we go again what is the armor the baptism of the Holy Ghost I need it every day some days you feel like you get so weak you're having a bad day you're like Lord I Need strength Lord I need a refill of your spirit I'm fighting this devil today you see what I face of me at work I'm going to need this armor today but you got to see your need of it you got to recognize you're in a battle but once you receive the Holy Ghost that's actually when your fighting starts my goodness we must realize that we can't fight this Army of Satan alone we've got to have help from a supernatural power we got to realize we don't have what it takes to defeat the Devil alone he is also mightier than we are because we're no match for him unless we put on the whole armor of God you know Paul paints a picture of a Christian armor because Paul's in prison a lot there's been many times he was chained to a soldier so he would look at that Soldier what that Soldier was wearing the belt the breastplate the shoes the shield the helmet the sword He he'll list them in exact order a soldier would put him on he said the belt comes first because it covers the most vulnerable organs and held other pieces of armor in place this is where you kept your weapons needed for Warfare the breastplate covers the chest to the upper abdomen The Shield covers most of the Soldier's body when soldiers stood side by side their Shields touched that's the way they marched it don't matter how many arrows come against them that Shield held it it don't matter we all we all will come together let's put our Shields together it don't matter what the devil throws against you we have the shields we're all one Army we're marching together we got one over here by itself if he is reach over there pull him over here it's safer in numbers my goodness the fiery darts couldn't penetrate those that's that Shield it don't matter how much time he tells you it's fun living in sin it might have been at one time might have been fun going around drinking and smoking and carrying on behind you Christians are still has scars in your bodies from all that I got my hand raised man oh he'll get you he'll get you to sin and laugh at you it's like he'll talk into robbing a bank they call the cops on you that's the devil that's who we're fighting against let's put on the whole armor your feet shot with the preparation of the Gospel the shoes you've heard me say this before I love it because I want the devil to know who he is and where he's supposed to be at and what these he's supposed to be under our feet the spikes on the feet just March around on the devil you've heard me say it spikes the firm grip we don't let him up that's part of the armor he said what she's got to do protecting you it does because if you're standing on the devil he can't get up to fight you Hallelujah he's not going to give you a fair break he don't fight fair oh he'll come with you different many disguises the one he's got today has said hey push away and obey just like we heard Wednesday night the mantle didn't drop on those people they didn't see Elijah go up they still got him on the Earth they still have him because he's the pastor they didn't let him go up who knows that's probably what Matt's preaching on this morning again hope so Hallelujah why in the world's all this Brothers know how it is you get all kinds of quotes and you don't know what you're you had time to go back and proofread them just remember one thing the devil does not have any Authority outside which God has given you a given him so pardon he has a short range the devil knows he has a short Reign on this Earth because he's doing everything he can to get you so put on the whole armor of God withstand the devil what's what's what what'd it say resist the devil and he'll flee from you let's all join together put our Shields together let's start on March let's start a March around Jericho let's do the Jericho March nothing can stand in your way all the calls your clothes wherever I go up close Hallelujah oh it's time we'll stop right there yeah let's all stand have your armor because we will be we got a battle like I said a minute ago it's not a picnic devil like he'd like for you to think it is like if you think it's a picnic put the Fried Chicken off the side and grab your sword it's fighting time we have a wedding supper to go to the darkness is leaving Days approaching so put on the whole armor of God at least pray father thank you Lord for that armor Lord because without it God we can't fight it we can't fight against no Devils Lord without this whole armor of God we need it all God don't just let me have the helmet not have the shield Lord don't let me have the sword and not have the shield father I just pray God may you take this little chopped up thought Lord and may you just minister to the hearts father may you be with this main portion of service Lord may you anoint the singing the special singing and most of all the Lord I want our brother to come out and speak to us God we come hungry today Lord God we're hungry to feed upon your word Lord and we've got a table spread before us Lord may you feed us in Jesus name amen God bless you thank you
