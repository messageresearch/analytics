[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everyone god bless you let's stand up together and pray heavenly father we just come before you lord and we ask that your holy spirit would just come and take your word lord make it alive in our hearts make it make it plain to us lord may may you reveal yourself to us more and more lord pray your blessing upon the sunday school the children sunday school as well the worship and the preaching of the word lord we ask that you would have the preeminence amongst us lord every heart every mind looking looking to you drawing from you father we ask these things in jesus name amen all right so if you want to pull up that powerpoint we are going to look at a few scriptures we'll read those scriptures and then i get half of you taking your seats and halfway are you standing up but we're going to stand up for the word must be tired out there um all right so what is a thunder let's look at a few scriptures second samuel 22 14 the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice psalm 18 verse 13 the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice psalm 104 verse 7 at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated where am i at here turn it on i gotta go backwards here yeah there there we go so as we see from those scriptures a thunder signifies the voice of god jesus speaking to the father in john 20 or john 12 28-30 father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it the people therefore that stood by heard it and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him again jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sake so the people heard a thunder and jesus said this voice all right okay let's keep going so those thunders speak of the voice of god so we were talking about seven thunders under their voices the mighty angel comes down from heaven with an open book cries with a loud voice in other words he speaks something crying with a loud voice it's it's like it's speaking of preaching so he cries with a loud voice he speaks something and when he speaks something what happens seven thunders utter their voices all right so then who how does that get communicated down to us all right so mighty angel descends from heaven open book in his hand why does he have open book in his hand the seals have been opened so he's communicating something what is he communicating it's not rocket science he's communicating what's in the open book right then the seven thunders out of their voices what could the seven thunders be saying something from the open book and then it goes on it gives a uh what we would call a parenthetical statement that the angel the mighty angel says time will be no more or there'll be another way to put that would be there'll be no longer delay all right and then it says but but but but but what is it what does butt mean there's an exception to this statement time shall be no more but oh so there's an exception there's something that has to take place before time can be no longer which we know is not really say time is no longer that's not really how it goes down there's no longer a delay because there's even even that you have the tribulation period you have have which is time you have the millennium which is also time so it's not time is no longer it means there's no longer a delay a delay for what for them for the net for this thing to be fulfilled and the next thing next step to be taken so seven thunders under their voices and john goes to write it down so in other words it was something that was to be communicated to god's people all right so he's going to communicate it to god's people oh this is important write it down he's told not to write it to seal it up okay so does that mean it's it's forever sealed it's something we'll never know no it corresponds perfectly with what we talked about in daniel chapter 12. when is it sealed up until it's sealed until the time of the end and so god was going to use what who to communicate the seven thunders to us he started to use john but he stopped and said no it's not for now that's for later that's for the end of the age so if he was going to use um a man that he chose to write down his words right what was he going to what is he going to use at the end he would have to do use the same means he would not john he would have to use a man to communicate that not a council not not a theological seminary not tim lahaye and jerry jenkins writing the left behind books he would have to anoint a man to do it to bring and and show us what those seven thunders were saying well it's history right it's a that's a historical event it's done it's finished it's been communicated in the laodicean church chapter 9 in the church ages book now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 you will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be now listen to this statement it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so the seventh he's talking about this what are the mystery truths it's what's contained in that open book okay and it's what's communicated by the seven thunders to that messenger that messenger then brings those truths to us and he says those truths are what actually turn us back to the original apostolic faith so what are the truths the teachings of the apostles they were sealed up they were hidden the full meaning and understanding of what it was all about was not completely known throughout the church age and the and the purpose that they were sent for was didn't didn't get fulfilled why because they began as soon as the apostles passed away they fell away from these things what was god's purpose in the first age it was it was to give them this new covenant and this new covenant would produce what a raptured a people with rapturing faith that would be raptured but what happened they fell away as soon as the message was given they stopped pretty much started falling away from it right away so it had to be restored and now we we receive that restoration and what is it going to do it's going to produce what it was initially meant to produce so when brother branham bring we we talk about the seven thunders we don't need a message theological degree to understand what it is it's quite simple we don't need to figure it all out it's quite simple all right but yet you say okay well that's easy for you to say but go back and read the seventh seal and people come to seven different conclusions after they are done reading the seventh seal but let's let god be the interpreter of that don't don't take take what brother branham says in the seventh seal and then shut down and say it's not it's not to be revealed to the public that's my final and absolute that's it i'm done i don't want to listen to anything don't speak to me the seventh seal is closed that's what people do but brother branham continues on and he explains they even ask him the seven thunders weren't revealed we'll get to that quote i think it's maybe the next one all right i'm just gonna go through these five key points in understanding the seven thunders the seals were just the covering of the book right so they were sealed the book was sealed with seven seals when the seal was broken a vision came forth and describing what each seal was the thunders are the means of communicating the contents of the book to the prophet so we're going to read some quotes here the seven sealed book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of revelation 10. the mysteries of the seven thunders all are already written in the bible but was missed back there remember nothing can be added to the bible and he said that this in that day that he see him come down and he eat up the little book and he put one foot on the land and one in the sea and swore by him that lives and ever and ever that time shall be no more and when he did seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders uttered their voices john said he was about to write and he said don't write it see and he sealed it what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there it's already wrote here the bible it's in here it's to reveal what's already been written see because you can't add one thing to it or take one thing from it that's from the feast of trump the trumpets in 1964. all right so this is from the first seal and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth and we'll find that after a while the lord willing where it's written so it's not written but it's written seems like a contradiction but it makes perfect sense it's not written out in revelation 10 3 and 4. but we we can't take that and say we have a new revelation that we're writing more scripture about no it's revealing what's in there that's been missed unveiling of god now someone has been many has been saying to me and theologians said brother branham if the lord god said if you with your experience that the lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said you'd be eligible to write a bible yourself your word that god has manifested i said that might be true see he was trying to catch me see and i said but see you see i couldn't do that. he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications i said but look but you look one word cannot be added or taken away see and he said well then them seven thunders you see said when them seven thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be give to some man i said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up of the revelation of what that was amen beautiful balance we read this quote but it it's worth reading again this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 2 he will reveal the mystery of the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers i've had people say well that's fine but it's in the church ages book we really can't trust that for whatever reason they believe that the church age book was not written by brother branham it was just written by brother vale and brother branham didn't didn't approve of it which is not true but okay fine take that standpoint we have something that we can point to right here where brother branham says exactly the same thing in questions and answers he says have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet here's the answer no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about they was to reveal the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said now listen to this is brother branham's uh paraphrase of revelation chapter 10 verses 4 3 4 and 7. he says but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding listen he doesn't say the mystery of god should be finished what does he say he puts something in place of that but in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed all right so the mystery of god what is the mystery of god the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed all right so whether you take the church ages book or not it's still staring you right in the face that the prophet said his ministry would reveal what the seven thunders are we either believe that or we don't believe that that's all right you make your choice but i i can see it here i see it plainly in the scriptures it dovetails perfectly together beautiful amen so the mysteries truth switch the seven thunders uttered again the seals were the covering the thunders reveal the contents so mighty angel descends with an open book utters his voice seven thunders utter the mysteries in heaven let me back up when i first started on the missions field in 2012 i did not understand this well i had no i i couldn't teach on it because i was i had a confusion i heard what many different preachers said and i felt like my goodness i i don't i can't explain it i don't understand it the person that led me to part of that probably is the person that led me to the message one of the reasons he left the message was he studied the seventh seventh seventh seal and his conclusion was brother branham didn't know what it was so how am i supposed to know what it was and i said well i think he knew what it was i just think that we're not seeing what it what it is and so you know you hear different ones say well seventh seal is closed it's not been open or the seven seals open but it's not revealed or you hear different people say well the seventh seven you know parts of the seventh seal are revealed but the seven thunders are still off in the future you know because they're gonna in the future way off in the future they'll bring us rapturing faith some people say they don't know what that is other people say well it's going to be seven men who are anointed to bring a message to bring rapturing faith to the bride around the world whatever all kinds of all kinds of things that cause me to be just everybody has a point but nobody has a point and and so i remember i think it was maybe uh the summer time in 2013 sitting in a car and knowing the people i was working with i've gotten to know them gotten to see where they're at from their background in the message and they had no understanding of of most of these things they knew basically they were uh just another oneness denomination that had serpent seed and brother branham's name attached to it and so these were things that i was so heavy burdened in my heart that they needed to see the reality of the message and i'm saying lord i can't even explain it to them and here i'm the one that's supposed to be teaching them guiding them in these things helping to get them to see the message more clearly and of course i've been studying it for a long time um 10 plus years and i couldn't come to a conclusion and i just at up to that point for a while i furiously studied oh i have it figured out have it figured out and then at the end i'd say i don't have it figured out and finally i just quit and said lord this is in your hands i need to be able to teach this but i don't have an understanding of it you need to help me so i was sitting in a taxi cab just praying pouring my heart out to the lord about this i need to help these people and it was like the lord spoke to my heart said now what order does that happen in okay this is not a new rev understand i'm not bringing you a new revelation i'm saying i want to understand it the way the prophet taught it and the way the scripture makes it plain to us so the lord asked me what order does that happen in okay the law said the mighty angel descends from heaven with the open book seven thunders under their voices the seventh angel finishes the mystery he said exactly and it was instantaneous instantaneous revelation to me i i get it now the seventh angel reveals exactly what the seven thunders spoke you know you say well isn't that easy isn't that simple isn't that basic it kind of is it kind of is but if you if if you hear lots of different thoughts and voices and you start to look brother branham purposely makes the seventh seal when he preaches it right he preaches at one time he says i said too much shut that down don't release it i'm going to re-record it and he just gives a few basic things and he wants to leave it in mystery format then as time goes on what does he do he begins to unfold it explain it in other words when he brought the seventh seal in 1963 he left it in a mystery format said it won't be revealed to the public right it's not going to be known to the public and then if you follow his message he starts to unfold that it's like when he preached the seventh seal it started a process it unleashed something started a process and then you see him in the sermons like christ is the mystery of god revealed feast of trumpets questions and answers these different things he begins to stop and explain it so it really yes yes it is simple but god puts it in a way in a parable right he he explains things christ explains things to people in riddles why because some people it's given to understand and other people it's not given to understand so why would you think brother branham would be a little bit obtuse about the third pull he was told don't exp you're goofing up you're messing up explaining the first poll in the second poll don't explain it at the end he just in one phrase would say the third poll is the opening of the word to the world they say what is he talking about that makes no sense to those of us who are feasting on the word it's god in simplicity all right you read can you read that brother luther i'm just going to take that off so if you look at this this is is this the sign of the answers uh 1962 december 30th this is the sermon that brother branham explains the vision he had about meeting the seven angels in the desert in arizona and he's explaining what's the purpose and what god is doing so he says the seventh angel of revelation 10 7 is the seventh church age messenger see now watch in the and in the days but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god should be sent finished now sounding forth this messenger the seventh angel here is sounding forth his message to the laodicean church notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first angel wasn't given that second third fourth fifth sixth but it's the seventh angel had this type of message what was it notice his type of message finishing all the mysteries of god that are written in the book the seventh angel is winding up all the mystery this laying loose ended all out through these organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the bible said finishes the mysteries of the written book now let's note a few of these mysteries and if you want to write them down first i'll take what scofield says here in matthew 13. if you'd like to type some of them down if you haven't got a scofield bible you might read what he thinks some of the mysteries are now on the 11th verse and he answered and said unto them because it's given unto you his disciples because given you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them it is not given the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation the greater mysteries and the great mysteries are mysteries of the kingdom of heaven israel's blindness translation of the living saints new testament church one body jews and gentiles the bride of christ living christ manifested mystery of god even christ the process which godliness is restored to man the mystery of iniquity the mystery of the seven stars and you can go on and and mystery babylon serpent seed doctrines of grace no eternal hell the baptism of the holy spirit not evidence of speaking in tongues but the person of christ living in you doing his works water baptism pillar of fire returning to the church then we can go on and he talks about who is this melchizedek marriage and divorce etc the rapture etc etc these are these mysteries that he preaches a lot of them are not too complicated right they're things that were left off by the by they were they fell away from the roman catholic church fell away from them god raised up ministers to restore a portion of that they created the denomination around that so the loose ends were laying out there in the denominations so the prophet came and said here's a truth that was god revealed here's a truth that god revealed here's another one that god revealed here's another one god revealed and he put it all together and said here you go so what did the seven thunder say that's what they taught us they restored us back to the original faith again the mighty angel descends with the open book what does that mean the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout brother branham says the shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first so what is this mighty angel coming down clothed with the cloud and and pillar feed his pillars of fire and so forth face shining with the glory of god rainbow around his head what that's god coming down with an open book what does it mean he's coming down to reveal something to us he ca he god himself came down to reveal himself through a prophet to open his word to us that's what the seven thunders is all about that's what the opening of the seals is all about it's not really as complicated as everybody wants to make it sound it's actually quite simple when it comes down to it god speaks in riddles and parables so that seeing you won't see but when you come down to it what is it pretty simple it's god had a means of revealing himself to his people seven angels met the prophet out in the desert came with the noise of a thunder one plus one equals two but yet you get all of these all of these things together put it all together and we start going oh i don't understand i don't get it just back up slow down separate yourself from all the noise and i don't mean to say message preachers are noise but over the years there's been a lot of noise there's been a lot of noise there's been a lot of confusion why because they themselves are confused and they preach it in a confusing way and the reality is for the bride it's so simple and that's what god has been trying to bring us to and yet we've been really working hard to make it complicated lord help us to back up separate ourselves from the noise get alone with god and let him speak down into our hearts amen let's stand up heavenly father we're so thankful lord for your word we're so thankful for the simple simple reality of it you lord you came down you brought an open book you have communicated this is for you this is for you to take and eat that it would change us from the inside out and produce a people with rapturing faith mature faith in the image of the son of god that would rapture a people out of this earth lord you came down seven thunders under their voices and your messenger revealed what was spoken in heaven to a people on earth we're so grateful for that we just lift our hands and give you praise for that lord we ask your blessing upon the service we ask your blessing upon the musicians the worship leader the preacher lord each believer here fill us more with you light our hearts on fire we ask in jesus name amen god bless you
