[48:12] they're gonna have to change it's made
[48:13] him a little bit
[48:14] light-headed and dizzy and so he just
[48:16] wasn't able to come this morning but i
[48:18] know they're home
[48:19] streaming and so uh we're disgrateful
[48:22] amen we're grateful to the grace of god
[48:25] amen that watches over us even when we
[48:27] don't
[48:28] realize he's watching us and so i'll
[48:31] just say
[48:31] you know to make it just to say it
[48:34] briefly
[48:35] um you know because i know my dad he's a
[48:37] he downplays everything
[48:39] and he's watching he downplays
[48:41] everything and uh you know and
[48:43] and and he wouldn't make a deal out of
[48:45] it
[48:46] um but what took place was a big deal
[48:49] and that was a real big deal for us and
[48:52] for him
[48:53] and according to the doctor uh we're
[48:56] very lucky to have him
[48:58] and so the the doctors the cardiologists
[49:01] made it
[49:02] really clear really uh really obvious
[49:04] that
[49:05] um you know the the artery that he had
[49:08] 99 blockage in was one that could have
[49:11] killed him at any moment
[49:13] could have had a massive heart attack
[49:16] but the lord
[49:17] the lord's in control of when we have
[49:19] our last heartbeat when we breathe our
[49:21] last breath
[49:22] god doesn't control that you don't even
[49:24] control that the lord controls that
[49:26] right and uh and brother branham says
[49:28] the if the footsteps
[49:30] i remember reading uh this uh the bible
[49:32] says if the footsteps of the footsteps
[49:34] of the righteous of a righteous man are
[49:36] ordered of the lord and so that means
[49:39] that
[49:39] every step even your last one is ordered
[49:42] of the lord
[49:43] and god wasn't ready amen to take him
[49:46] and we
[49:46] really surely definitely weren't ready
[49:48] to lose him
[49:49] in any way shape or form and i said dad
[49:52] you're too valuable you mean too much
[49:54] to too many people you're a you're an
[49:56] essential uh
[49:58] player you're a franchise player as he
[50:00] calls it i
[50:01] can't lose you and so we're grateful
[50:03] amen just to see the way the lord worked
[50:05] everything out a great testimony we
[50:07] could
[50:07] share about it and i'm sure he'll he'll
[50:09] get a chance to do that but
[50:12] um it was it was just the lord
[50:14] everything looking back
[50:15] from last wednesday when uh when he
[50:18] when when everything sort of happened
[50:20] i'm sure you noticed a little commotion
[50:22] there
[50:22] wednesday night but we made him go said
[50:25] gotta go
[50:26] now and uh and and so he's in the i he's
[50:29] called
[50:29] he calls himself the eternal optimist
[50:31] and he is and he
[50:32] is an optimist looks at the bright side
[50:34] of everything and this time it was
[50:36] it was uh to him it was to a fault i
[50:38] could say
[50:39] because he just you know thought
[50:40] everything was fine and it'll be good
[50:42] and
[50:42] you know no big deal and it turned out
[50:44] to be a very big deal
[50:45] and actually the cat the the stress test
[50:48] had it
[50:48] revealed really much of anything uh
[50:51] would have just probably sent him on his
[50:52] way
[50:53] amen but the the holy spirit just
[50:55] stopped that and actually a brother
[50:57] had uh had texts that brother daryl ward
[50:59] had texted whose family has had
[51:01] we know you know brother brother daryl's
[51:04] family having different
[51:05] heart issues and then uh you know
[51:08] brother daryl
[51:08] had rode in there said brother jason
[51:10] even if you you passed the stress test
[51:12] you know i'd recommend get the heart
[51:14] cath because
[51:15] a stress test you can pass a stress test
[51:17] completely and
[51:18] and then fell a cat the cath show
[51:20] blockage
[51:22] and so um so i texted him i said i think
[51:24] that was from the lord he said yeah i do
[51:26] too
[51:27] and then sure enough the doctor thought
[51:28] the same thing said we're gonna do one
[51:30] even though you passed
[51:31] the stress test we're gonna do one and
[51:33] when they did it immediately they seen
[51:35] the blockage
[51:36] and and just told you know he told my
[51:38] mom and uh probably
[51:40] was the worst thing he could have told
[51:41] my mom but he called my mom and said
[51:43] you're lucky
[51:44] he's alive lucky he was in my office you
[51:47] know of course we look and say
[51:48] it ain't got nothing to do with luck
[51:52] you believe that there ain't nothing
[51:54] that happens it's luck or bad luck or
[51:56] good luck it's all
[51:57] the mercy that god blesses us and
[52:01] watches over us and protects us amen so
[52:04] we're thankful
[52:05] looking forward to having him amen back
[52:07] here if you have your bible first salmon
[52:09] chapter 30
[52:10] amen we'll just read just a few verses
[52:12] here
[52:13] amen first samuel chapter 30.
[52:18] and it came to pass when david and his
[52:20] men were come to ziklag
[52:22] on the third day the amalekites had
[52:25] invaded the south and ziklag
[52:26] and smitten ziklag and burned it with
[52:28] fire
[52:30] and had taken the women captives that
[52:32] were there and they slew not any either
[52:34] great or small but carried them away and
[52:35] went on their way
[52:37] so david and his men came to the city
[52:39] and behold it was burned with fire
[52:41] and their wives and their sons and their
[52:43] daughters were taken captives
[52:45] then david and the people that were with
[52:47] him lifted up their voice and wept
[52:49] until they had no more power to weep
[52:51] david's two
[52:52] two wives were taken captives let's all
[52:55] move on down to verse
[52:56] six and david was greatly distressed but
[52:59] the people spake of stoning him because
[53:01] of the soul
[53:02] because the soul of all the people was
[53:04] grieved every man for his sons
[53:06] and for his daughters but david
[53:08] encouraged himself in the lord his god
[53:12] david said to abathar the priest
[53:14] amalek's son
[53:15] i pray thee bring me hither the ephod
[53:17] and abbathar brought thither the ephod
[53:20] to david
[53:20] and david inquired at the lord saying
[53:23] shall i pursue after this troop
[53:25] shall i overtake them and he answered
[53:28] him
[53:28] pursue for thou shall surely overtake
[53:31] them
[53:32] and without fail recover all so david
[53:35] went
[53:36] he and the 600 men that were with him
[53:38] and they came to the brook bethsor
[53:40] where those that were left behind stayed
[53:44] amen i'd like to minister to you this
[53:46] morning on
[53:47] part two of restoring years let's just
[53:50] bow our heads here if you have a need

[54:25] morning we could have spent today
[54:27] in sorrow lord but you had a different
[54:30] plan
[54:31] lord and and in all of it lord it was to
[54:34] show your
[54:35] your glory it was to show your
[54:36] protective hand upon your children
[54:39] that you put a hedge around them and
[54:41] satan can only go so far as your prophet
[54:43] said
[54:44] satan can't even touch you until god's
[54:46] finished with you

[55:23] and the church says amen you can be
[55:25] seated this morning thank you
[55:27] amen musicians restoring years
[55:32] we spoke on this wednesday and
[55:35] i just want to continue as a second part
[55:37] to that tonight
[55:39] amen just to see where the lord will
[55:41] have us and we'll have us go
[55:42] thank you brother john it's amazing when
[55:46] when you read this and i've ministered
[55:48] on this many times this story in first
[55:50] samuel chapter 30.
[55:52] we've spoke on this uh before and the
[55:54] lord just brought this back over
[55:56] in my mind and i thought about how much
[56:00] that david had lost and and the the
[56:04] i've learned so much from this man's
[56:05] life from david's life
[56:07] amen i believe he's so relatable to all
[56:10] of us
[56:11] here this morning and and and maybe
[56:13] different stories
[56:14] uh that you've read maybe different
[56:16] bible characters or different
[56:18] uh things that you've pointed out i
[56:20] believe that's important you know
[56:22] god speaks by his word and the prophet
[56:24] of god said find someone find a story
[56:27] identify yourself in the word and say
[56:29] that's me lord
[56:31] and and so i i so identify with
[56:34] with david i think we all can relate to
[56:37] how he
[56:38] must have felt when he comes back
[56:41] home from uh from war with his with his
[56:44] men and there's ruins and destruction
[56:48] and his home is torn down and his his
[56:51] everything he had
[56:52] lived his life everything he had built
[56:54] up and everything he had worked for
[56:57] uh he had lost it all and and he and
[57:00] and it was looked like a picture of just
[57:02] ruined
[57:03] looked like a picture of just complete
[57:06] despair
[57:07] complete destruction and and calamity
[57:10] and you know calamity strikes sometimes
[57:13] so unexpectedly
[57:16] and crisis can come upon us sometimes
[57:19] just when we are
[57:20] least expecting it and when we're least
[57:23] prepared for it
[57:24] and when we're least uh when when we're
[57:27] least
[57:27] ready for it you can never prepare for
[57:31] you don't always have the opportunity
[57:33] but you can never prepare for
[57:35] unexpected crisis and when
[57:38] suddenly there's trouble and sometimes
[57:42] trouble comes that way i believe that
[57:44] even the world that we live in is uh
[57:47] is a uh is so very different i read
[57:51] yesterday i was reading in genesis
[57:53] and read the entire story of creation
[57:55] and
[57:56] watching how the spirit of god just
[57:58] moves and and as i was reading the
[58:00] the the the the my bible there i could
[58:03] hear
[58:03] as i'm reading each verse i can hear the
[58:05] the prophet of god just begin to
[58:07] dramatize
[58:08] the way that the logos just moved out
[58:11] from god and he says and he
[58:12] he started cooing to the seeds that were
[58:15] already in the earth and
[58:17] and he said as he began to coo and the
[58:19] holy spirit began to move over the earth
[58:21] he said darkness begin
[58:24] sorry seeds begin to come forth and life
[58:27] began to come forth and he said and
[58:29] he'd coo over the earth and and a tree
[58:31] would
[58:32] would pop up just like that and he said
[58:35] he said watching the holy spirit brood
[58:38] upon creation and
[58:39] and i was reading through my bible and
[58:41] and and just watching just going through
[58:43] the
[58:43] the creation and the way that the the
[58:46] earth was just responding
[58:48] and and and they they were it was just
[58:50] so re the creation was so responsive
[58:53] to the moving of the spirit you know why
[58:56] because
[58:56] darkness had been removed the the the
[58:59] the darkness had been removed from
[59:01] the the earth and the seeds and when the
[59:04] spirit of god
[59:05] moved upon the face of the water and the
[59:08] spirit of god moved upon the earth
[59:10] the earth responded magnetically it had
[59:14] a reaction to the spirit of god
[59:16] i began to read that and i said lord i
[59:18] want to be that i want to be responsive
[59:21] that when the spirit of god begins to
[59:23] move over my life that there's no
[59:25] darkness there
[59:26] no hindrance there there's no blockages
[59:29] there
[59:30] there's nothing to stop the spirit from
[59:33] moving freely over my life
[59:35] there's just a freak open channel i said
[59:38] lord i want to
[59:39] i want to be li i'm like the earth i was
[59:41] in that dark condition and
[59:43] darkness covered the face of the deep
[59:45] but you spoke
[59:46] to that darkness and the darkness was
[59:48] removed and the earth got into a
[59:50] condition to where it could respond to
[59:53] the voice of the lord
[59:54] there was no hindrances there i told the
[59:56] brothers in the prayer meeting last
[59:57] night i said i might preach home
[59:59] after going through all this with the
[1:00:00] heart doctor and my dad and all the
[1:00:02] you know the the this 99 blockage i said
[1:00:05] you know i think i might just preach a
[1:00:06] sermon on spiritual blockages
[1:00:11] where we're so blocked from the from the
[1:00:14] from the freed the free moving of the
[1:00:17] spirit of christ
[1:00:19] and the blood has to flow i want the
[1:00:21] blood to flow freely
[1:00:23] say lord i don't want there to be no no
[1:00:25] blockages in my life nothing
[1:00:27] causing a spiritual heart attack but let
[1:00:30] my heart be healthy let me
[1:00:32] you know how you know you're healthy
[1:00:33] when you can react and you
[1:00:35] move and your your your life changes
[1:00:38] from the
[1:00:39] moving of the spirit of god i read all
[1:00:43] of that yesterday and i was beginning to
[1:00:44] read on just to watch the way that the
[1:00:46] creation and life begins to to come
[1:00:49] forth and seeds and plants and
[1:00:52] botany life and the earth just begins to
[1:00:54] get a revival
[1:00:55] and begins to be stirred and begins to
[1:00:58] be moved and begins to dance
[1:01:00] and begins to move to this to the rhythm
[1:01:03] of the creator as he coos over its
[1:01:05] creation
[1:01:06] and all that all you go through all of
[1:01:08] the creation and you've got this
[1:01:10] beautiful perfect planet and perfect
[1:01:12] world to where everything's in harmony
[1:01:15] and everything's synchronous and
[1:01:16] everything's moving
[1:01:18] by the voice of the lord
[1:01:21] and then he comes to the very end of it
[1:01:23] and god and the bible says and god
[1:01:25] said it is good
[1:01:30] and i thought he looks over this earth
[1:01:33] and there's there's harmony and and
[1:01:36] there's life
[1:01:36] and there's health and and then god says
[1:01:40] and it was good and i thought as i read
[1:01:44] those words i looked in
[1:01:45] there in my bible and i said lord how
[1:01:48] very
[1:01:49] different how very different
[1:01:53] the the world that we live in today is
[1:01:56] from
[1:01:56] that world that i read about
[1:02:01] how very different we that god looks at
[1:02:04] the earth and says it's
[1:02:05] good but what's happened it's it's
[1:02:09] it's not good anymore it's not good at
[1:02:12] all
[1:02:13] the world that you live in god doesn't
[1:02:15] look at this cosmos and the condition of
[1:02:18] of our world and say it's good it's it's
[1:02:20] very good no
[1:02:21] it's it's under a curse it's in it's in
[1:02:24] travail it's in groaning it's in
[1:02:27] it's in uh uh a birth pangs
[1:02:32] and the earth is not good i i read that
[1:02:35] just i was reading my bible and i said
[1:02:37] lord what a wicked world we live in
[1:02:40] today
[1:02:42] what a what a what a what what an evil
[1:02:45] what an evil world that we

[1:03:14] can

[1:05:26] there's a present
[1:05:27] there's a presence and a present evil
[1:05:30] all the time
[1:05:33] and it's a we're preaching on restoring
[1:05:35] years all the years
[1:05:37] that joel says that the cankerworm the
[1:05:39] caterpillar the palmer worm
[1:05:41] the locust all that they have ate away
[1:05:43] and i'm beginning to think about this
[1:05:45] this morning and i said lord
[1:05:46] it's just such a world that constantly
[1:05:49] even
[1:05:50] as believers as christians we're living
[1:05:53] in a world where
[1:05:55] there's a corruption that's in the rest
[1:05:57] of the world
[1:05:58] and and the the devil has the ability to
[1:06:01] even
[1:06:01] affect us as believers living in this
[1:06:04] fallen world
[1:06:05] to rob us and to steal from us anything
[1:06:08] he possibly can
[1:06:11] i thought about that you know i i i said
[1:06:14] that to my dad i said
[1:06:15] you know why satan you know you know why
[1:06:18] you're
[1:06:18] my dad who's saying lo it must mean the
[1:06:20] lord still has something god didn't take
[1:06:22] me
[1:06:23] it must mean that the lord has still has
[1:06:25] some work for me to do
[1:06:27] and he wrote that in the church chat
[1:06:29] must mean the lord still has a fresh
[1:06:30] purpose and the lord has a purpose for
[1:06:32] my life i said dad that's right
[1:06:33] but it also means that satan hates you
[1:06:36] he can't stand you
[1:06:38] he wants to destroy you
[1:06:41] he wants to take you off of this earth
[1:06:43] and you know friends let me just say
[1:06:45] that the devil
[1:06:46] hates you if he can kill you he'll kill
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:50] if he can take your life he'll take your
[1:06:52] life if he can rot and if he can't you
[1:06:54] know what he'll do
[1:06:55] he'll rob you because jesus says the
[1:06:58] thief comes
[1:07:00] to kill to steal and to destroy
[1:07:06] he's a robber he's a thief he'll steal
[1:07:09] he's a thief he'll take
[1:07:11] he'll take whatever you whatever he can
[1:07:15] he'll rob you and and there's there's
[1:07:17] there's
[1:07:18] sorrow you know we're grateful here
[1:07:20] today thankful here today
[1:07:23] that god spared uh that god was watching
[1:07:26] over protecting my dad's life
[1:07:28] so thankful but i think of how much
[1:07:30] tragedy
[1:07:31] others in that same situation have faced
[1:07:34] as the nurse begins to tell us a nurse
[1:07:37] just uh
[1:07:38] the the this the other day sister uh
[1:07:40] brother travis's secretary
[1:07:42] there katie be in the hospital and begin
[1:07:44] to tell us a story about
[1:07:45] one of the nurses that she worked with
[1:07:47] and her her you know
[1:07:48] and her mom had had a previous heart
[1:07:50] attack and they called her and said
[1:07:51] she's on the way now she's coming got
[1:07:53] her bed ready got her room ready
[1:07:55] got her got her got her got her room
[1:07:56] ready was going to receive her and
[1:07:58] and before she can the husband comes
[1:08:00] into the emergency room to take her in
[1:08:02] and he comes and he says i think she's
[1:08:04] she's passed out he said she's not out
[1:08:06] of the car
[1:08:06] goes out to the car and she begins to
[1:08:08] tell us there she is dead
[1:08:10] in the car didn't even make it to the
[1:08:11] hospital room starts doing chest
[1:08:13] compressions trying to
[1:08:14] resuscitate her and just she was just
[1:08:16] expressing
[1:08:17] to me to say you're so lucky to have
[1:08:20] your dad and she said there's
[1:08:22] the the worst horror stories of my
[1:08:25] career
[1:08:26] in the hospital was those situations
[1:08:28] where
[1:08:29] you lose some where it doesn't turn out
[1:08:31] the way that it turned out for you
[1:08:34] and i thought you know this is the world
[1:08:36] that we live in such a we
[1:08:38] live in a fallen world and we live under
[1:08:40] the curse of
[1:08:41] sin and for as much
[1:08:44] for his firs for as for as much
[1:08:47] happiness as there is
[1:08:48] there's sadness for as much joy
[1:08:52] there's sorrow and there's there's
[1:08:54] there's times of loss
[1:08:56] and we go through pain some of us even
[1:08:59] in our own church
[1:09:00] you know some of us you know got covered
[1:09:03] and
[1:09:04] and and we we had hardly no symptoms
[1:09:08] and you know really it was worse i would
[1:09:09] take the flu i've told people i said
[1:09:11] that my the cobia
[1:09:12] when i was diagnosed with coba they said
[1:09:14] how bad was that i said i would
[1:09:16] take that and quadruple it
[1:09:20] before i would get the flu that's how
[1:09:22] the flu's bad but the flu was much worse
[1:09:25] but you know that wasn't everyone's
[1:09:26] story i have a brother here in our
[1:09:28] church who
[1:09:29] suffered greatly from it and on in and
[1:09:31] out of the hospital and
[1:09:33] and some who even passed away and died
[1:09:36] from it
[1:09:37] because you say brother matt why is that
[1:09:39] because it's an evil world
[1:09:41] and darkness covers this entire world
[1:09:44] and the atmosphere of this world
[1:09:46] is a it's in a condition it's in a it's
[1:09:49] in a condition
[1:09:50] of curse and death
[1:09:54] and god protects us i'm thankful for
[1:09:56] that and we have the blood of the law of
[1:09:58] jesus that we plead over our lives and
[1:10:00] you should be pleading that
[1:10:02] and say lord protect me and watch over
[1:10:04] my life and
[1:10:05] and and guard my heart and guard my home
[1:10:08] and guard my family keep me from the
[1:10:10] evil one

[1:10:25] before i go out into this world
[1:10:27] give me the shield of faith the helmet
[1:10:28] of salvation give me the sword of the

[1:10:42] from the evil one
[1:10:46] i'm just telling just preaching to you
[1:10:48] what the lord just
[1:10:49] highly placed it upon my heart amen
[1:10:53] that that there's there's in this world
[1:10:56] that we live in there's
[1:10:57] death there's sickness there's lots of
[1:11:00] sadness there's disease
[1:11:02] rampant mental disease
[1:11:06] physical disease all those things are
[1:11:10] real
[1:11:10] and you live in it every single day and
[1:11:13] there's just a
[1:11:14] there's a there's a there's a uh
[1:11:17] you that that doesn't even that just
[1:11:19] covers the diseases and sicknesses
[1:11:21] it says nothing to do with the the
[1:11:23] greatest disease
[1:11:26] and that's sin amen
[1:11:29] and and more than ever before we live in
[1:11:32] a sinful world
[1:11:34] you know we're we're so you don't
[1:11:36] realize how sheltered you are to live
[1:11:37] here in
[1:11:38] a small city even you go and study the
[1:11:41] the the lineage of cain
[1:11:45] and you'll find that it was kane who is
[1:11:47] who who
[1:11:48] it was the lineage of cain not the
[1:11:50] lineage of seth
[1:11:51] but it was the lineage of cain who
[1:11:53] created um
[1:11:55] uh uh i'm trying to think of the word
[1:11:57] here but who
[1:11:58] who was ironsmiths and and and created
[1:12:00] uh
[1:12:01] uh uh commerce and and cities they were
[1:12:04] builders of cities
[1:12:07] you know what a city is it's centralized
[1:12:11] it's centralized so what is what is this
[1:12:14] what is this
[1:12:15] what does a city do it brings in sin and
[1:12:18] it centralizes sin and it's very it's
[1:12:20] very centered with sin
[1:12:21] you just go into the cities one time you
[1:12:24] don't believe me go travel to nashville
[1:12:25] we were there just a couple weeks ago
[1:12:27] wanting to go see the downtown area of
[1:12:29] nashville oh it's going to be great
[1:12:31] you know looking forward to seeing all
[1:12:33] it's going to be my goodness
[1:12:35] couldn't even hardly go down a street
[1:12:36] without having to close your eyes
[1:12:38] because of
[1:12:39] just the the sin was so rampant
[1:12:43] rock and roll music bars playing on
[1:12:45] every left hand right hand left hand
[1:12:46] right hand
[1:12:47] people half dressed guy selling
[1:12:49] marijuana right on the street
[1:12:54] and we went down one street and down the
[1:12:56] other street and down the other street
[1:12:57] what was it the closer you go to that
[1:12:58] city center the greater the sin becomes
[1:13:02] more sinful and more sinful and more
[1:13:04] sinful you won't find that really in
[1:13:06] and you go to rural areas of america if
[1:13:10] that's all you've ever experienced if
[1:13:11] you've only ever living in small cities
[1:13:13] and rural areas
[1:13:14] you know you'd say my goodness how could
[1:13:16] they put someone like kamala harris how
[1:13:17] could they put joe biden what's wrong
[1:13:19] with this world it must have been a
[1:13:20] rigged election
[1:13:22] there's no way everyone i talk to likes
[1:13:23] trump everywhere i look as american
[1:13:25] flags everyone i talk about says in god
[1:13:27] we trust
[1:13:29] you know and there's a disconnect
[1:13:31] because you're like how could how could
[1:13:32] he have won there's no way he won
[1:13:35] there's no way he won the election i
[1:13:37] mean how could they have put a guy
[1:13:40] trump was you know stood for israel you
[1:13:42] know he at least professed that he was
[1:13:44] trying to
[1:13:44] do good things for christians and
[1:13:46] everybody i'm around
[1:13:47] is you know well don't don't forget you
[1:13:50] live in the bible bell
[1:13:53] and if you've ever of all you ever
[1:13:54] experiences rural areas and small cities
[1:13:58] you don't realize it wasn't those small
[1:14:00] cities and rural areas that put him and
[1:14:03] put
[1:14:03] joe biden in office it was cities
[1:14:08] city centers
[1:14:11] and you go our intercity and i i stopped
[1:14:13] and i had some of my
[1:14:15] nieces and nephews i forget it was ryan
[1:14:16] mita and my kids i had
[1:14:18] gideon and the rest of them in there and
[1:14:19] i said guys listen i said you want to
[1:14:21] know who put joe biden in office
[1:14:23] you're in it right here and the
[1:14:26] background is the loud rock and roll
[1:14:27] music guy selling marijuana on the side
[1:14:30] of the street
[1:14:30] women really with nothing not wearing
[1:14:32] anything adultery and fornication
[1:14:35] going on right in front of your eyes
[1:14:39] and you wonder why brother branham would
[1:14:42] make a statement like
[1:14:44] if god lets it go any longer he'll have
[1:14:46] to he'll have to apologize to sodom and
[1:14:48] gomorrah
[1:14:52] for the sin that would be so rampant in
[1:14:54] the world it's a sin
[1:14:56] disease it's a sinful world
[1:15:00] and it's more sin is more accessible to
[1:15:04] people when to the hidden sin is more
[1:15:07] easy to hide than ever before
[1:15:11] hidden sin in the heart private lives
[1:15:14] are more it's easier to be private about
[1:15:16] something and
[1:15:17] and and to keep it concealed to conceal
[1:15:20] david said to them
[1:15:21] to conceal a transgression he said i
[1:15:23] concealed my transgressions
[1:15:24] and it destroyed me internally you know
[1:15:27] it's more it's easier
[1:15:28] to live that kind of a life than ever
[1:15:30] was before
[1:15:32] because you can do anything you want you
[1:15:34] have the world wide web
[1:15:36] be anything live in a romantic
[1:15:38] relationship and don't tell anybody
[1:15:40] about it
[1:15:42] haven't have an affair online don't even
[1:15:44] tell anybody have a relationship online
[1:15:46] don't even tell anybody but no one ever
[1:15:47] even knows
[1:15:49] you say that stuff doesn't happen
[1:15:51] brother matt
[1:15:55] why you say why does it happen because
[1:15:57] it's an evil world
[1:15:59] and there's present evil everywhere
[1:16:02] it's ever present but you know what the
[1:16:05] bible says
[1:16:06] it says god says i'm an ever-present
[1:16:09] help in the time of trouble
[1:16:12] as as ubiquitous as sin and and satan
[1:16:16] and
[1:16:16] demon spirits and and and and evil is in
[1:16:19] the entire world
[1:16:21] god is is covered he says i'm in all
[1:16:24] i'm through all i'm in you all i'm
[1:16:27] everywhere i'm just
[1:16:28] a prayer away
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:32] i don't know how we got on that but let
[1:16:33] me just let me just continue on here
[1:16:35] this morning
[1:16:36] it's it's a i i preach that to say it's
[1:16:39] a
[1:16:40] you live in a world to where you can
[1:16:41] lose so much
[1:16:43] and you don't even realize it because
[1:16:45] satan's a robber
[1:16:46] he's a thief he comes to steal he comes
[1:16:48] to kill he comes to destroy
[1:16:51] and he'll rob you sitting in church
[1:16:55] he'll rob you claiming to be a christian
[1:16:58] he'll rob you having a spiritual or a
[1:17:01] godly
[1:17:02] marriage and a godly home and a good
[1:17:05] family
[1:17:05] don't ever forget the thief is out to
[1:17:08] kill you he's out to steal from you and
[1:17:11] he's trying to destroy you
[1:17:13] and the bible says he's a roaring lion
[1:17:15] seeking whom he
[1:17:16] may devour he's always on the prowl he's
[1:17:20] always trying to disrupt he's always
[1:17:22] trying to destroy
[1:17:26] and you get to a place you're like oh
[1:17:28] i'm you know we're doing good
[1:17:30] the church is in revival and you know my
[1:17:32] family's doing good and
[1:17:33] things are looking up and and god's
[1:17:35] doing something for me
[1:17:37] just be careful because don't ever get
[1:17:39] complacent
[1:17:41] don't ever get complacent in that
[1:17:43] condition because satan's busy
[1:17:46] he's busy all the time trying to disrupt
[1:17:50] trying to rob you trying to steal from
[1:17:52] you i remember i preached a message on
[1:17:53] that years ago
[1:17:55] and i had something stolen from my from
[1:17:58] from my uh i had a car was broken into
[1:18:01] and i had i just that's what it was i
[1:18:03] had a tool very expensive tool stolen
[1:18:05] you know
[1:18:06] it's amazing because i didn't i didn't
[1:18:08] even realize it was gone
[1:18:10] until it was almost probably three
[1:18:13] months
[1:18:13] i've traced down the date to when it was
[1:18:16] stolen it was three months later
[1:18:18] and it had been stolen for three months
[1:18:19] and i had no idea until i needed it and
[1:18:21] looked for it and thought my goodness
[1:18:22] where did it go and begin to trace it
[1:18:24] and track it down
[1:18:26] and i thought my you know that's the
[1:18:28] that's the
[1:18:29] that's a good thief
[1:18:32] you know what a good thief does a good
[1:18:34] thief i'm not talking about a burglar
[1:18:36] comes in
[1:18:37] you know and he just robs you and kills
[1:18:38] you i'm talking about a thief
[1:18:40] we had our cars broken into and i
[1:18:41] remember the police officer told me they
[1:18:43] said you got to understand he said these
[1:18:44] guys
[1:18:44] guys broke into your car he said they've
[1:18:46] been they've been probably walking
[1:18:47] through the neighborhood he's
[1:18:48] probably seen him a hundred times and he
[1:18:51] said they were watching you studying you
[1:18:52] when are you home what time does lights
[1:18:54] go out what times does lights turn on
[1:18:56] or what time do you go to church he said
[1:18:57] last sunday we had a woman
[1:18:59] a house broken into while she was at
[1:19:01] church took everything in our electronic
[1:19:02] device in our home
[1:19:04] he said these these guys study they
[1:19:05] watch they wait i begin to think about
[1:19:08] that and say you know that's exactly
[1:19:09] like the devil
[1:19:10] the devil studies us and watches us and
[1:19:13] waits for our weakest moments our most
[1:19:15] vulnerable times when we're complacent
[1:19:17] in our heart he knows
[1:19:18] just how and when and time to have a
[1:19:22] perfectly precise
[1:19:24] time when to attack you
[1:19:28] and that robber that that thief the the
[1:19:30] police officer
[1:19:31] said he said he's been studying you he
[1:19:33] said they want you they
[1:19:34] they they wait for the right opportunity
[1:19:36] to strike and if they can
[1:19:38] that he says like this thief they'll do
[1:19:42] everything they can so that you don't
[1:19:43] notice
[1:19:44] you don't notice anything it's just gone
[1:19:48] i didn't notice anything would have
[1:19:50] never known didn't know that entire time
[1:19:51] i had been stolen from
[1:19:54] and here it was gone and i and i had no
[1:19:56] recourse now months later
[1:19:58] they don't they don't a good thief
[1:20:00] doesn't rob from you
[1:20:03] and then the next day call you and say
[1:20:05] ah i got you
[1:20:07] i took all your stuff
[1:20:10] go open the drawer it's gone
[1:20:13] no they wait they hope that they can
[1:20:15] leave everything undisturbed
[1:20:17] so that you don't even know any any
[1:20:18] disruptions happen
[1:20:20] in your life
[1:20:23] and i you know i thought that's exactly
[1:20:25] like just like the devil
[1:20:27] how many times you you don't even
[1:20:28] realize the joy of the lord's gone until
[1:20:31] suddenly
[1:20:32] down the road you you just you can't
[1:20:34] worship the lord like you should
[1:20:39] you know church attendance slowly falls
[1:20:42] off
[1:20:43] and before you know it you're just here
[1:20:45] on sundays and you're never here on
[1:20:46] wednesdays and
[1:20:48] then before you know that you're not it
[1:20:50] you're you're not you're not fellowship
[1:20:52] you know it's a it's a sign
[1:20:55] it's a it's a a spiritual barometer
[1:21:00] and god has these in our life i believe
[1:21:02] that they're important
[1:21:03] because the bible says you should guard
[1:21:05] your heart
[1:21:07] you should watch your heart guard it
[1:21:09] watch it make sure make sure that
[1:21:11] to say like david lord search me see if
[1:21:14] there be any wicked way in me
[1:21:16] don't let me don't let me get a blockage
[1:21:18] in my heart and not know about it then
[1:21:20] down the road i have a crash or some
[1:21:22] great crisis
[1:21:23] uh lord let me be inspected now inspect
[1:21:27] me now lord
[1:21:28] and let me say if there's any blockages
[1:21:30] in my life lord would you clear them all
[1:21:32] out
[1:21:33] would you free my mind free the channels
[1:21:37] david was so greatly stolen from i could
[1:21:39] imagine
[1:21:41] as he comes to that calamity as we
[1:21:44] said the calamity strikes so unexpected
[1:21:47] and you know satan attacked what was
[1:21:49] dearest to him
[1:21:51] notice he doesn't take it's he doesn't
[1:21:54] either david doesn't come home
[1:21:57] to all of his valuables his money stolen
[1:22:00] and all of his gold
[1:22:01] and all of his diamonds and his wives
[1:22:03] are crying and his family's crying they
[1:22:05] came in and raided us and took
[1:22:06] everything they took all of our
[1:22:08] possessions all of our years of life
[1:22:10] savings all of our
[1:22:12] no but what is what is the devil attack
[1:22:14] he doesn't he does he bypasses the money
[1:22:17] he bypasses the material things and he
[1:22:19] goes right to the most
[1:22:21] important most closest
[1:22:25] nearest to his heart amen
[1:22:29] nearest to his to his emotions
[1:22:34] he comes home and it's not his
[1:22:35] belongings that are gone but his family
[1:22:41] if satan could hurt you the deepest
[1:22:44] way he could possibly hurt you is when
[1:22:46] he attacks
[1:22:48] those you love
[1:22:52] can you say man mothers say man fathers
[1:22:57] attacks those who you love
[1:23:01] and it was it was this was the center of
[1:23:03] of
[1:23:04] of satan's attack on david he he
[1:23:07] attacked who he loved the most his
[1:23:09] family
[1:23:10] his children the men they come home it's
[1:23:13] not just david's wife and his children
[1:23:15] but his
[1:23:15] his men's children all of their families
[1:23:19] and then he burns everything to the
[1:23:20] ground he burns it all they
[1:23:23] david comes home to complete destruction
[1:23:26] hillman 600 men after coming back from
[1:23:29] victory
[1:23:32] and they come home and now the
[1:23:33] amalekites have kidnapped
[1:23:36] everything now david doesn't know that
[1:23:38] they're kidnapped at this point for all
[1:23:39] he knows they're dead
[1:23:42] for all he knows the calamity he's
[1:23:43] walked into is complete
[1:23:45] loss everything's burned down
[1:23:49] the bible says in verse three first
[1:23:52] samuel
[1:23:52] let's turn let's read it here for a
[1:23:54] moment first samuel chapter 30
[1:23:56] verse three i'm seeing bibles i'll wait
[1:23:59] give you a second
[1:24:00] to get to that scripture
[1:24:04] here's the scene he comes to
[1:24:07] the bible says so they came david and
[1:24:09] his men came to the city and behold
[1:24:12] it was burned with fire and their wives
[1:24:16] and their sons and their daughters
[1:24:20] how important these people how intricate
[1:24:23] how how special saying the text the most
[1:24:26] special thing
[1:24:27] to you he's a thief and he's a robber
[1:24:29] and he's a destroyer
[1:24:30] takes he tried to take the one of the
[1:24:33] most important people in my life my own
[1:24:35] dad
[1:24:36] tried to attack his life i'm sure you
[1:24:38] could testify here today
[1:24:39] and say the the satan is satan's out to
[1:24:42] he's
[1:24:42] tried to take my wife maybe your husband
[1:24:45] maybe your children maybe your father
[1:24:46] maybe your mother
[1:24:48] because he's a destroyer he's a thief
[1:24:50] he's a robber
[1:24:52] and he hits you where it hurts the most
[1:24:58] and the bible says david notice you
[1:25:00] imagine as these men
[1:25:02] no doubt the the the there's just
[1:25:05] silence
[1:25:06] they they don't even know what to say
[1:25:09] what is that what's happened they're in
[1:25:11] shock
[1:25:13] complete shock
[1:25:18] no no no idea you imagine i thought
[1:25:21] about this you imagine the mind battles
[1:25:23] imagine the things they begin to think
[1:25:25] in their mind of the
[1:25:26] fate of their family they come back home
[1:25:30] and now
[1:25:31] suddenly everything's been flipped
[1:25:33] upside down
[1:25:35] everything's been flipped completely
[1:25:37] upside down
[1:25:38] he says in verse 4 notice the bible says
[1:25:42] then david and the people that were with
[1:25:43] him
[1:25:44] lifted up their voice and wept until
[1:25:47] they had no
[1:25:48] more power to weep
[1:25:51] you look at this show you look at this
[1:25:53] here
[1:25:54] it's a it's a he had a reason to weep
[1:25:58] he had a reason to be these men had a
[1:26:00] reason to
[1:26:01] to cry they had a reason to question
[1:26:04] they had a reason to to to ask and say
[1:26:07] god why would you allow this to happen
[1:26:09] why would something like this take place
[1:26:11] why such calamity lord
[1:26:13] and the bible says they begin to weep
[1:26:15] and they begin to cry no doubt it was a
[1:26:18] time for weeping
[1:26:19] it was a time for sorrow as solomon says
[1:26:22] there's a time to weep
[1:26:24] there's a time for sorrow
[1:26:28] there's a god has a purpose in that god
[1:26:30] has a purpose for your weeping don't
[1:26:32] hurt in your hearts
[1:26:34] amen but god has a purpose god had a
[1:26:37] season there's a reason
[1:26:38] that god allowed them i hope you catch
[1:26:41] this here this morning
[1:26:42] there was a reason that god allowed the
[1:26:45] calamity to happen
[1:26:47] and for david to experience the emotion
[1:26:50] of being forsaken
[1:26:51] and forgotten there was a reason that
[1:26:54] god
[1:26:55] allowed david and these men to have such
[1:26:57] an uncertainty
[1:26:58] there was no angel that stepped out and
[1:27:01] said don't cry don't cry no no no no you
[1:27:03] guys have misunderstood this it's okay
[1:27:05] they're gonna be all right the end of
[1:27:06] the story david just enough in a few
[1:27:09] hours you're gonna get everything back
[1:27:10] oh oh oh thank you thank you for telling
[1:27:13] me that i i begin to get worried
[1:27:19] you know god doesn't do that god allowed
[1:27:22] him
[1:27:24] god allowed him to experience that
[1:27:26] what-if
[1:27:29] god allowed him to experience those
[1:27:30] thoughts of wow
[1:27:34] how things could have been so different
[1:27:37] you know sometimes god will bring you to
[1:27:38] the very
[1:27:39] edge in your life
[1:27:43] god will bring you to the very edge just
[1:27:45] to cause you to ponder that question for
[1:27:47] a moment
[1:27:49] and you realize what things are
[1:27:51] important and what things are not
[1:27:52] important you let calamity or health
[1:27:56] problems strike
[1:27:57] and then suddenly all of your business
[1:27:59] that you've been working so hard on let
[1:28:02] let a loved one get sick to the point of
[1:28:04] death
[1:28:05] and you don't know if you're going to
[1:28:06] have them or not you don't know what's
[1:28:08] going to happen
[1:28:09] and you don't know the outcome you don't
[1:28:11] know if you're going to lose them
[1:28:14] suddenly everything gets very what you
[1:28:17] thought was real
[1:28:18] now it's real anybody know what i'm
[1:28:21] talking about
[1:28:24] and god allows that to happen
[1:28:27] because it's important david it's
[1:28:29] important for you to know
[1:28:32] it's important for you to experience
[1:28:34] it's important for you to process
[1:28:37] this for a moment and i want you to
[1:28:40] process it i'm not going to tell you
[1:28:42] i'm not going to say anything i'm going
[1:28:44] to let you go on believing now god knew
[1:28:46] that his wife and children were safe he
[1:28:47] knew that all of these men
[1:28:49] all of the men's families you go we're
[1:28:52] going to read it here in just a minute
[1:28:53] the bible says they recovered
[1:28:55] all and then emphasizes and says
[1:28:58] both great and small in other words
[1:29:00] every little thing he didn't lose
[1:29:02] anything
[1:29:03] he didn't lose one speck not anything
[1:29:05] there was nothing but
[1:29:07] david restore was restored everything
[1:29:10] as we preached on you wednesday night
[1:29:12] god restores
[1:29:14] everything he's restoring the years the
[1:29:16] locusts the pomeran the caterpillar
[1:29:18] and there's nothing lacking that's what
[1:29:20] the my king james says
[1:29:21] there was nothing lacking not great not
[1:29:23] small
[1:29:26] but you know what david didn't know that
[1:29:28] at this moment he had no idea of that
[1:29:30] and god intentionally didn't let him
[1:29:33] know that
[1:29:34] he wasn't going to tell him that god was
[1:29:38] gonna allow david and these men to wipe
[1:29:40] to weep until they had no more power the
[1:29:43] bible says look at verse four
[1:29:45] they had no more power you ever cried
[1:29:48] and cried and cried and cried so much
[1:29:51] to you can't cry anymore
[1:29:55] you know what that feels like you're out
[1:29:57] of tears you're still crying but there's
[1:29:59] nothing coming out
[1:30:01] you have no power to weep anymore
[1:30:05] and then the bible says notice this it
[1:30:07] says
[1:30:09] it says they had no power to weep
[1:30:11] anymore go to verse
[1:30:13] 5 the next verse and david's two wives
[1:30:16] were taken captive
[1:30:18] verse 6 and david was greatly
[1:30:23] distressed distressed
[1:30:28] greatly distressed god why'd you allow
[1:30:31] him to go through that lord you were
[1:30:32] going to rescue him you were gonna save
[1:30:34] him
[1:30:34] all of his family was okay they were
[1:30:36] actually okay at this point moment god
[1:30:37] you had a greater plan why didn't you
[1:30:39] tell him that you allowed him
[1:30:40] to go through this moment sometimes that
[1:30:43] tension that you feel in your life
[1:30:45] is not from the devil it's from god
[1:30:48] because god's trying to get your
[1:30:50] attention
[1:30:52] god allows and manipulates manipulates
[1:30:54] certain circumstances in your life so
[1:30:56] that
[1:30:57] that language that you you haven't heard
[1:31:00] is language
[1:31:00] of love you haven't heard you haven't
[1:31:02] heard the language of the word you've
[1:31:04] ignored that you haven't heard the
[1:31:05] language of the preacher
[1:31:06] you've ignored that you haven't heard
[1:31:08] the language of wisdom from friends
[1:31:09] you've ignored that so god has to speak
[1:31:11] a different language
[1:31:13] to get your attention and david's
[1:31:17] greatly distressed
[1:31:19] calamity strikes for the people
[1:31:22] spoke of stoning him
[1:31:26] total loss no cattle no homes no crops
[1:31:29] no family no
[1:31:30] children no wives
[1:31:33] and the bible says that they spoke
[1:31:36] of stoning him what an amazing
[1:31:40] time what what an amazing scene here
[1:31:44] the bible says because the soul of all
[1:31:46] the people was grieved
[1:31:47] every man for his sons and for his
[1:31:49] daughters but david here's the notice
[1:31:51] the colon there
[1:31:52] every man including david was grieved
[1:31:55] for his sons for his sons and for his
[1:31:58] daughters
[1:31:59] but david encouraged
[1:32:03] himself in the lord his god
[1:32:07] there was a time when distress
[1:32:11] was okay there was a time when weeping
[1:32:14] was okay
[1:32:15] but that time had now ended and god said
[1:32:18] it's not
[1:32:18] you got to end that day of weeping
[1:32:20] you've got to end that day of sorrow
[1:32:22] i purposed it in your heart but now that
[1:32:24] you've got to have a you've got to get
[1:32:26] your fight back
[1:32:27] you've got to get your faith back this
[1:32:30] situation has caused you to
[1:32:32] to go to the ground and weep and and
[1:32:34] wonder what's going to happen to your
[1:32:36] life
[1:32:36] but david you're going to need to get up
[1:32:38] off the ground because i've got to work
[1:32:40] for you to do
[1:32:41] you're going to recover everything that
[1:32:43] you've lost but you'll never
[1:32:45] recover anything weeping on the ground
[1:32:49] you've got to encourage yourself in the
[1:32:52] lord you've got to

[1:32:56] get your your spiritual man
[1:32:58] uh wake him up inside of your soul and

[1:33:05] understand i believe that you're
[1:33:07] orchestrating the events in my life
[1:33:09] in spite of how badly i think i've
[1:33:11] messed it up
[1:33:14] the bible says david encouraged himself
[1:33:17] in the lord listen to hebrews chapter
[1:33:21] 12.
[1:33:22] quickly brother george if you could
[1:33:23] hebrews chapter 12
[1:33:25] and verse 12. listen to what he what the
[1:33:27] scripture says here
[1:33:28] paul says this song i don't thank you
[1:33:31] perfect wherefore
[1:33:32] he says wherefore lift up the hands
[1:33:35] which hang down and the feeble knees
[1:33:39] in other words david you got to do this
[1:33:42] you can't stay there crying you can't
[1:33:44] stand there weeping
[1:33:45] lift up those hands don't feel like
[1:33:47] lifting those hands lord

[1:33:51] much
[1:33:52] lord don't you know how much i've lost i
[1:33:54] don't you know how much the
[1:33:55] how heavy the enemy's attacking me paul
[1:33:58] says
[1:33:59] lift up the hands which hang down
[1:34:02] even if you don't feel like it this
[1:34:04] morning even if you don't feel like it
[1:34:07] lift up those holy hands and those
[1:34:10] feeble needs go knees go to verse 13.
[1:34:13] notice what he says in the next verse he
[1:34:15] says wherefore lift up the holy hands
[1:34:17] which hang down
[1:34:18] and the feeble knees in other words
[1:34:20] strengthen the hands
[1:34:22] that's what that word means there
[1:34:24] strengthen the hands
[1:34:26] which are weak and he says and make
[1:34:28] straight
[1:34:29] paths for your feet lest that which is
[1:34:32] lame
[1:34:33] be turned out of the way but let it
[1:34:36] rather

[1:35:20] promise you there's got to be resistance
[1:35:22] in order to properly exercise
[1:35:24] if you're feeling good raising your
[1:35:26] hands don't mean nothing you know what
[1:35:27] exercise it is when your hands are heavy
[1:35:30] and you raise them up in spite of it
[1:35:35] it's when you're down cast and depressed
[1:35:37] and you have no reason
[1:35:39] you have no reason to have joy you have
[1:35:41] every reason to have a frown on your
[1:35:43] face
[1:35:44] but you smile
[1:35:47] what are you doing you're lifting up the
[1:35:49] feeble hands
[1:35:51] you're you're lifting up the feeble
[1:35:53] knees you're strengthening the feeble
[1:35:54] hands you're making your path
[1:35:56] straight because if you don't you'll
[1:36:00] succumb to that fear
[1:36:02] if you don't you'll you'll succumb to
[1:36:04] that worry
[1:36:06] it'll suffocate you

[1:36:24] spirituality
[1:36:26] but you know what you do you say fear is
[1:36:28] a liar
[1:36:30] so you cast your fear in the fire
[1:36:32] because fear
[1:36:33] it is a liar you got to encourage
[1:36:36] yourself

[1:38:31] jerusalem the holy city
[1:38:33] for the uncircumcised and the unclean
[1:38:36] shall no longer come to you
[1:38:38] shake yourself from the dust
[1:38:42] isn't this what david did he shook
[1:38:45] himself
[1:38:46] from the dust you know what david was
[1:38:49] doing he was completely
[1:38:50] changing the atmosphere
[1:38:54] and until you're willing to change your
[1:38:56] atmosphere you'll never change
[1:38:59] until you're willing to change the
[1:39:01] atmosphere you'll never
[1:39:03] change because as we preached on last
[1:39:06] wednesday if you just stay in a negative
[1:39:09] negative atmosphere negativity breeds
[1:39:12] more negativity
[1:39:15] it becomes like a like a cancer
[1:39:18] depression
[1:39:19] just leads to deeper depression
[1:39:24] sadness leads to deeper sadness david
[1:39:26] could have stayed there
[1:39:27] but the what was the atmosphere the
[1:39:29] atmosphere was one of sorrow
[1:39:31] and everybody had everything in common
[1:39:33] you say brother matt but he had a reason
[1:39:34] absolutely he had a reason
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:38] he had a reason yeah yeah he could he
[1:39:40] could justify his calls as many of us
[1:39:42] can
[1:39:43] in times of great calamity and crisis we
[1:39:45] could justify it and that's what we do
[1:39:47] yeah that's what we do yeah that's easy
[1:39:50] to preach preacher you don't know what
[1:39:51] i'm went through and you don't know
[1:39:52] what's happened in my life and yeah let
[1:39:54] me just give me a few minutes and i'll
[1:39:55] tell you
[1:39:57] and it's true you know it's true
[1:40:00] people have reasons and i'm not taking
[1:40:02] away those reasons i'm not
[1:40:04] here to tell you you don't have a reason
[1:40:05] to to be downcast you don't have a
[1:40:07] reason to be crying on the ground
[1:40:08] you don't have a reason to be in the
[1:40:10] dust i'm not here to say that today
[1:40:12] not here to say there's david had a
[1:40:14] reason but david had to
[1:40:16] understand that as long as he stayed
[1:40:20] in that atmosphere of depression and
[1:40:23] sorrow and worry
[1:40:25] he would just perpetually stay there
[1:40:29] you know what we do when we get in that
[1:40:30] condition we expect someone to come
[1:40:32] around
[1:40:33] you know i'm just so you get so wrapped
[1:40:35] up in yourself
[1:40:37] we expect someone's going to come and
[1:40:38] someone's going to pick me up and
[1:40:39] there's someone lay hands on me it's
[1:40:41] going to deliver me and
[1:40:42] i'm just waiting for some man to come
[1:40:43] and somebody to come and waiting for the
[1:40:45] holy you know what
[1:40:46] god wasn't going to sin god god wasn't
[1:40:49] gonna send a a
[1:40:50] prophet in this case for david god
[1:40:52] wasn't gonna send a preacher
[1:40:53] he wasn't gonna blow a trumpet as many
[1:40:55] times you read in the bible when men
[1:40:57] would cry out then god prophet would
[1:40:59] come but god was just waiting he was
[1:41:01] just waiting
[1:41:02] just watching how long was david gonna
[1:41:05] stay in there i'll tell you how long
[1:41:06] david would have stayed crying with his
[1:41:07] men he would have stayed there till his
[1:41:09] men
[1:41:09] stoned him
[1:41:13] and he would have succumbed to that
[1:41:16] but you know what david did david david
[1:41:20] himself he himself three people me
[1:41:24] myself and i
[1:41:27] david encouraged himself
[1:41:33] in the lord you know what david was
[1:41:36] doing
[1:41:36] he was refusing to live in a negative
[1:41:39] atmosphere but it didn't make any sense
[1:41:43] brother man he had
[1:41:43] every reason to be that's right he did
[1:41:45] have every reason to be negative
[1:41:47] but he is also a man of faith and he had
[1:41:49] every reason to believe
[1:41:51] he had every reason to give god a chance
[1:41:54] he had every reason to believe in the
[1:41:56] bible says david
[1:41:57] encouraged himself
[1:42:00] when no one else was there to sing david
[1:42:03] began to sing
[1:42:06] sometimes you need a song for yourself
[1:42:10] it's good for others to sing for you and
[1:42:12] you get blessed by that but sometimes
[1:42:13] god needs those words to come out of
[1:42:15] your lips
[1:42:16] you say why because it'll do something
[1:42:18] to you that other singing won't do
[1:42:22] when when you begin to confess and you
[1:42:25] begin to cry out and you begin to
[1:42:27] proclaim the
[1:42:28] promises of god for yourself when david
[1:42:31] began to say i'm not going to wait on
[1:42:33] anybody what was god saying david
[1:42:35] uh you're not going to send anybody
[1:42:37] you're not going to wait on anybody
[1:42:38] you're not going to be able to draw from
[1:42:40] another man's well
[1:42:42] but you've got to draw from the well
[1:42:44] that's down inside of you
[1:42:45] whether you realize it or not david
[1:42:48] you've got it within you david it's
[1:42:49] within yourself
[1:42:51] all that you need to get out and change
[1:42:53] your circumstances not external
[1:42:56] it's inside of you david you just gotta
[1:42:58] have enough faith to believe it and cry
[1:43:01] out and claim it
[1:43:02] and say i'm gonna i refuse to stay down
[1:43:05] i refuse to stay on the ground i refuse
[1:43:08] to stay

[1:51:42] me o lord standing in the need of
[1:51:46] prayer when you recognize

[1:52:02] senseless it's useless the cycle of sin
[1:52:06] is one that ends in a dead end
[1:52:10] literally a dead end
[1:52:14] that road to sin leads to a dead end
[1:52:16] there's no real joy there there's only
[1:52:18] temporary
[1:52:19] satisfaction and you sell yours why god
[1:52:22] says you've sold yourself for nothing

[1:52:42] of its fornication and all of its
[1:52:44] lust you know what it pays in the end

[1:58:07] all messed up
[1:58:08] he's all messed up in his mind you know
[1:58:10] why because pride had got him to such a
[1:58:11] point to where he didn't think it was
[1:58:13] possible for him to fall
[1:58:17] peter got to such a point and he
[1:58:20] curses the lord denies he even knows him
[1:58:23] you know what god does you know what
[1:58:24] jesus does when jesus sees peter
[1:58:28] jesus says to simon it says so when they
[1:58:31] dined
[1:58:31] jesus said to simon peter lovest thou
[1:58:34] me more than these
[1:58:39] peter lovett thou me
[1:58:43] but lord i messed up so bad i'm just so
[1:58:46] you don't understand
[1:58:47] all of his pride everything ever before
[1:58:50] before
[1:58:50] before peter gets to this point you know
[1:58:52] he had he
[1:58:53] he he thought he was someone special
[1:58:56] you know god will take a person like
[1:58:58] that and god will allow that person to
[1:59:00] come to such intense
[1:59:02] trial to where all of their grit and all
[1:59:05] of their will and all of their willpower
[1:59:07] and self-determination
[1:59:09] fails them and then they
[1:59:12] bow their head and come back and say
[1:59:15] lord
[1:59:16] without you i am nothing
[1:59:20] felt like such a failure god says to
[1:59:22] peter lovett thou me
[1:59:24] peter more than these
[1:59:27] you love me peter more than all your
[1:59:29] pride
[1:59:31] amen more of all your boldness more of
[1:59:33] everything that you've got you love me
[1:59:35] more than that
[1:59:36] peter oh but you know what peter had to
[1:59:39] do peter had to first deal with himself
[1:59:42] he first had to get past himself but god
[1:59:44] have messed up
[1:59:45] yeah i know peter you've messed up but
[1:59:47] but lord but but but you don't
[1:59:49] understand i know that peter
[1:59:51] i know what you went through i know what
[1:59:52] your life's been i know what you did
[1:59:54] but i still love you peter do you love
[1:59:56] me are you willing to get past that you
[1:59:58] see it wasn't until peter could get past
[2:00:01] his own self
[2:00:03] david had to get past his own self he
[2:00:05] couldn't question what his
[2:00:07] the mistake that he had made oh i've
[2:00:09] messed up so bad
[2:00:10] and now all these men have lost all of
[2:00:12] their family all of their homes all of
[2:00:14] their life
[2:00:19] the bible says david encouraged himself
[2:00:22] and the lord he tells abithar
[2:00:26] he says give me an ephod notice here in
[2:00:29] in
[2:00:30] in first samuel 30. we're going to close
[2:00:32] with this right here
[2:00:33] verse 7 and david said to abbathar the
[2:00:35] priest elimelech's son i pray thee bring
[2:00:38] me hither the ephod
[2:00:39] nabathar brought through the ephod to
[2:00:41] david and david inquired of the lord
[2:00:42] saying shall i pursue
[2:00:43] after this troop shall overtake them he
[2:00:45] answered him pursue
[2:00:46] for thou shalt surely you notice right
[2:00:48] when david encourages himself in the
[2:00:50] lord god immediately comes on the scene
[2:00:52] immediately comes on the scene you
[2:00:54] imagine the test that david has
[2:00:56] he's even thinking grab me the ephod i
[2:00:59] get abathar the priest
[2:01:00] david doesn't know what's going to
[2:01:01] happen probably knows god's completely
[2:01:03] forsaken him
[2:01:04] but as soon as david could get up off of
[2:01:06] the ground
[2:01:07] as soon as david could stand up to his
[2:01:09] feet god speaks just like that
[2:01:12] shall i pursue you shall as if god was
[2:01:14] just waiting
[2:01:15] for the moment so that he can say you're
[2:01:18] going to get it all david
[2:01:19] now you've done the right thing now i
[2:01:20] can speak to you you're not on the
[2:01:22] ground anymore
[2:01:23] shall i pursue after this tube shall i
[2:01:25] ever take them and he answered them
[2:01:27] pursue in other words go forward
[2:01:30] for you shall surely overtake them and
[2:01:32] without fail recover
[2:01:34] oh everything
[2:01:38] nothing will be lost verse 17 and david
[2:01:41] smote them from the twilight
[2:01:43] even unto the evening of the next day
[2:01:45] and their escape not a man of them
[2:01:48] save 400 young men which rode upon
[2:01:52] camels and fled it's a good thing david
[2:01:55] gets victory
[2:01:56] you know what you're going to get
[2:01:57] victory
[2:01:59] let me give you the word from god you're
[2:02:01] going to get victory
[2:02:02] i don't feel like it you're on the road
[2:02:04] to victory and you're going to whip that
[2:02:06] devil who's been bothering you you're
[2:02:08] going to destroy all enemies will come
[2:02:10] under your feet

[2:02:18] recovered all that the amalekites had
[2:02:22] carried away
[2:02:23] and david rescued his two wives verse 19
[2:02:26] and there was nothing lacking
