TRANSCRIPT
========================================
service. 12 sacrifice holy acceptable service and perfect will of God. it this morning, but we all know why he can't. So, congratulations to him and Sister Katie. But I said, "Okay, I got I got something I was actually working on for the youth, our next Bible study coming up, and I just do that." So I started working on a bit last night and of course woke up this morning something totally different of course. So if this looks like sounds like a mess, it's a mess but he can take care of it. Their title is if you want to put a title to it is renewing the mind. You know we have a command that as the bride of Christ we need to be separate from the spirit of the age. You know our mind is a battlefield. We know what brother said about that and he said the word of God is a weapon that renews and transforms. So we know that our mind is a battlefield. In 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse three it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh. You know we have to walk around this body that we live in but we don't have to fight with fight this flesh. This flesh is not who we're fighting against. He says, "We don't wage war like the world does. We're not carrying around our AK-47s and 57s or whatever you got ready to fight a war. We don't send drones in." So he says, "But our but our weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of our strongholds." So we're going to destroy all of our reasonings. That's what the strong stronghold is. Our reasonings and what we think things is because we're casting down imaginations. what you imagine things and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought. Amen. Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. So, we're not supposed to walk after the flesh because it says in Romans 8:5, "For they that are after the flesh, they do mind the things of the flesh." Amen. Which we're going to do what the flesh says. So if we're walking after the flesh, our flesh is going we're going to do what our flesh tells us to do. But we're not supposed to do that. For they that are are of the spirit, we do the things of the spirit. So whatever we think so to be carnally minded is death. So for all we think about is carnal things all the time. It's death to us. But to be spiritually minded is life and peace. You know, you can't help what you think. You can't stop the thought from coming. You know, we heard that. It's with what you do with that thought that counts. You know, I heard someone make a comment the other day. They said, "It's a good thing that they don't say what they think." Sometimes it's a good thing I don't say what I think because it won't be good. You can't keep the birds from flying. I mean, you can't help what you think. They're coming. You can't stop them. But the birds are going to fly over. You know what they do with the birds, but they don't have to build a nest on your house. And I see my wife, she'll put a wreath on a door in the springtime. She'll go out there and see a nest starting to form. Well, we don't want a nest bird's nest on our front door. So, she'll take the nest and throw it out. That don't does that stop the bird? No. Next morning, she has to get up and go to grab that nest and throw it out again because he's already started again. And finally, after a little bit, he gets the point. He quits coming around. You know what I'm saying? You got to take, she just tears it down. So that's what we need to do with these thoughts that keeps coming in our minds. We need to cast them down. Brother Bram said it's on a record. Every thought that goes through your mind is on a record. And someday the record is going to quit playing and it's going to be put into an album. What are you thinking this morning? You think why? Where am I ain't church? Don't listen God. This is why we need a renewing of our minds. Not daily or not just once but daily. Every day Lord come and renew this mind. Amen. He says Lord I love this prayer. I found this bit been. He said Lord we pray that he'll come to the throne of our hearts this morning and climb up and take possession of every thought that we have. bringing your thoughts into captivity. The greatest battle ever fought is in the human mind. He says that's where Eve lost the battle. We know how Eve lost the battle. She got to listen to the lies of the devil. Surely, surely you won't die. You'll be like God. Your eyes will be open. Go ahead. She started listening to She started reasoning the thoughts in her mind. He says, he says that's where Eve lost the battle, but that's where Jesus won it. We know what happened when Jesus was baptized, went to the wilderness, be tempted of the devil, and the devil was coming to him and says, "You're hungry. Cat, make these stones bread." Oh, throw yourself off the temple. They'll catch you before you fall or bow down to me. But what did Jesus do? Get behind me, devil. Get behind me, Satan. That's where Jesus won it. And that's where you'll either win it or lose it. It's right here in your mind. So Jesus did what Eve could not do. He shows us what we can do. So the battle in the mind is not the flesh. We're not battling our brother and sister. We're not biting our wives or our husbands because Ephesians 6:12 says, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers and rulers and darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." So your thoughts determine your actions. Your actions shape your destiny. Amen. So Satan's fighting for your mind, but he's not the only one. God is also fighting for your mind. And we choose who you want to yield to. Amen. The scripture we read Romans 12:2 says, "Be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed." That word transformed, we all know what the word trans. This is where we'll be getting metamorphosis from. It means to change into another form. To transform to transfigure. So it's what happened to Christ on Mount Transfiguration. The disciples opened up their eyes and they he see his face did shine as the sun. and his raignment was white as light. And behold, there appeared unto him Moses and Elisha talking with them. 2 Corinthians 3 says, "So now the Lord is that spirit where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Amen. But we all with an open face. Behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord. And we can go many places there, but we won't this morning. The glory of the Lord are changed. were changed into that same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord brother says transforming he say he used to work for a public service company where we had transfer transformers to transform so that word is it's in itself is something like to transform means something has been changed from something that changed from one thing to another to be transformed to be changed made something different you know like a little tadpole When it's born, he's there. He looks like a fish, acts like a fish, swimming around. You say, "Ah, he's going to be a fish." But then in a few weeks, you're like, "Where'd all them tadpoles go?" Then you start seeing little things start hopping around everywhere. It changed. It was transformed from that tadpole into a frog. It's like a butterfly. It was just like a little caterpillar crawling around, just keep eating and eating, munching and munching, going into a cocoon. And when it comes out of cocoon, it's a beautiful butterfly. He got transformed. Metamorphs. So that's what the word transformation means. I think that's what Paul might have had in mind. He says when he says, "Be ye transformed." He says, "Be not conformed to the world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." Renewing of your mind. The things that you once thought upon to be precious. Lay that aside and be transformed to something else. What you was one time to what you are now. Thank the Lord. But be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. That word renewal means a renewal, a renovation, a complete change for the better. You know, when you go buy a house and the first thing you go in a while say, I don't like that kitchen. I'm going to take it apart. So, you're going ripping out cabinets. You're ripping out countertops. You're ripping out walls. I got to make this room bigger, make the bathroom bigger. You're you're remodeling. You're making it new. You walk in says, "This don't look nothing like it used to when I first bought the place." We've had a complete renovation. It's time we go into our mind and do a complete remodel. We need to do a makeover. Let God take our thinking. Because Re says, "When God gets a hold of a man's thinking, he changes his whole being." That's what the Holy Spirit does. It renews the mind with the word of God. So, we can't renew our minds by psychology or some kind of feeling you base it on. But the word is what washes and renews. Because Ephesians 5:26 says, "He that might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word." Brother says, "That's how the church is cleaned, by the washing of the water by the word." Not just joining some church, not by shaking a hand, by not putting your name on a book, but by the washing of the water of the word. So renewal requires a separation and a surrender. In order to achieve this, we have been made a new creature in Christ. So brother said, I just passed my birthday just last Monday. I was 55 years old. And you know, the Brandham family never asked me to join the family. He said, "I was born a brand." Did you ask to join your family? If I had a choice and and God says, "Okay, you're going to be a Jonce." I would say, "No, I don't want to be. I want to be something different. I like that family. They're rich. They got nice homes and cars." And side note, I love my family. I wouldn't trade them for a good one. I didn't have a choice. So that's the way we are as Christians. We really didn't have a choice because we were called God, called of God before the foundation of the world. We were just born a Christian by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So we are Christians by birth. that makes us new creatures because Galatians 6:15 says, "For in Christ Jesus, it don't matter if you're circumcised or not, but you're a new creature no matter what." In our old nature, we could never be Christians. What Brother says, that's the reason today we have so many people calling themselves Christian and living any kind of life. I remember before we moved down here, I was working at the hospital and those lot of people claimed they were Christians. claimed they were Christians and you listen to their talk, cussing, using the Lord's name in vain. You're like, you're a Christian. Then they talk about, I can't wait to get off work. I'm going to go home, get me a big glass of wine, and unwind. And they would say, what do you do when you get home from work? What do you What What do you What calms you down? I says, "Jesus and Dr. Pepper." They looked at me like, "This guy's weird. They never experienced that born again. That's something that changes you that takes the life out. It's like pulling the blood out of a man that's got a certain type of blood and putting another type in him. It's the pulling the old life out of the man and injecting the life of Christ in the believer. Then he becomes a new creation. So 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." Amen. Old things are passed away. All things become new. So you're a new creature. And so what happens after that says you are an epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men. Wow. Now many people won't read a Bible. Amen. A lot of people don't read the Bible. So when you're walking around, that's the only Bible they'll ever read. So I ask a question. What version are they reading? What kind of version do they have of the Bible? Is it the real version? Is it Christ version? Or is it yours? Amen. You're a walking letter. God has made you a living representation. You are a walking letter and you should be a walking Bible. Christ in you. You are the walking word of God. And if you profess to be a Christian and not that you talk about your influence, your influence will make will make you have to answer for many souls that you've turned aside away from Christ in that day of judgment. Colossians 3:12 says, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek these things which are above. Set your affection on things above, not on the things of the earth." We have a lot of things, but we don't need to put our affection there, right? We don't need to put our affection in nice homes and nice cars, which is good. There's nothing wrong with that. But we need to set our affections on things above because Philippians, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Wow. So if you get the mind of Christ Jesus, what's that make you? Equal with God. He found himself in no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, became obedient even the death of the cross. So brother said, God wants separation. He wants you to come out of the world and let your mind stay on him. Your mind is the control tower of your soul. So what's in your heart? What you think what your heart is what you think is your you know what I'm saying? I can't get it out right now. So what's in your heart tell the control tower what to do. So a man thinkketh in his heart. So is he. Amen. That's right. Amen. That's that's powerful right there because Isaiah 26:3 says, "Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trustth in thee." So surrender is not a one-time prayer, but it's a daily decision to set your mind on Christ. The new mind brings a new life because it's not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Ephesians 4:22 says that ye put off concerning the formal conversation of the old man and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteous and true holiness. He says, "Well, you say, "Well, I joined the church. That ain't it." Have you had your mind changed? Has the Holy Ghost renewed you by the word and made you a new creation? because I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I but Christ that lives in me. So we got to die daily. Amen. Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life. So thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee. So says you feed on the word that what makes the inner man grow when your thoughts are on Christ your whole life will show it. Amen. People could see what your thoughts are. The way you act, the way you talk, the things you see and listen to. And people knows what your thoughts are. They know where your heart is. Because Philippians 4:8 says, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, good report, think on these things." Amen. Don't think on all these negative things. Think on these things. Think on what's good. Everybody says, "The Holy Spirit trains your mind to think like Christ. Act like Christ. Live like Christ. That makes you the bride because you have the mind of Christ. So let this mind which is in Christ Jesus also be in you. So if you let God renew your mind, he will transform your life. It's not just get about getting saved. It's about being changed. We're already saved. We just need to be changed into the image of the word. This last quote, that's the whole purpose. God changing your mind from your way of thinking to his. Yes. And when you think like him, you'll act like him. Amen. And when you act like him, you are his bride. God bless you.
