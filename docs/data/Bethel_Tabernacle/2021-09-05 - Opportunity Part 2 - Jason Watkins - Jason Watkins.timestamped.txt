[41:17] word or group of words than just one
[41:20] word
[41:20] about what's on my heart opportunity

[41:29] marvelous opportunities hasn't he
[41:32] mark chapter 16
[41:36] and verse one through eight that's about
[41:39] perfect thanks buddy
[41:41] and when the sabbath was passed
[41:43] mary magdalene and mary the mother of
[41:46] james and salome had brought sweet
[41:48] spices that they might come and anoint
[41:51] him
[41:52] and very early in the morning
[41:55] the first day of the week
[41:56] they came unto the sepulcher
[41:59] at the rising of the sun
[42:01] and they said among themselves who shall
[42:04] roll us away the stone from the door of
[42:06] the sepulcher and when they looked they
[42:09] saw that the stone was rolled away for
[42:12] it was very great
[42:13] and entering into the sepulchre they saw
[42:16] a young man sitting on the right side
[42:19] clothed in a long white garment and they
[42:22] were afraid
[42:23] i think i said this one of the time
[42:25] every time i read that verse i think of
[42:27] caleb campbell
[42:29] something about caleb's looks angelic
[42:31] amen
[42:32] i can imagine they saw caleb smiling
[42:34] with that smile he has
[42:36] amen
[42:38] and he's saying to them be not afraid
[42:40] you know and he saith unto them verse 6
[42:43] be not a frighted you seek jesus of
[42:46] nazareth which was crucified he has
[42:49] risen he is not here
[42:51] behold the place where they laid him but

[42:57] goeth before you into galilee there
[43:00] shall ye see him
[43:02] as he said unto you and they went
[43:05] quickly and fled from the sepulcher for
[43:08] they trembled and were amazed neither
[43:10] said they anything to any man for they
[43:12] were afraid

[43:56] to you for your word
[43:59] of course it's on my heart has been i've
[44:01] thought about it studied over it wept
[44:03] over it rejoiced over it
[44:05] lord and i just i so much want to convey
[44:10] it today
[44:11] exactly as you
[44:13] gave it to me lord so would you grant
[44:16] that lord help us now today bless your
[44:19] word we commit it to you in jesus name
[44:22] amen god bless you friends you can be
[44:24] seated
[44:41] amen
[44:43] we just kind of wait for the
[44:45] transitional traffic here to settle
[44:48] down we learned a lot from last week and
[44:52] i won't really have time
[44:54] to background
[44:56] uh
[44:57] hardly any at all if any at all
[44:59] but um
[45:01] it's i feel that it was an important
[45:04] thought it's helpful for you if you
[45:07] absorb it if you missed it you can go
[45:10] back and get the archive i'd recommend
[45:12] that you do i was very much moved by the
[45:16] opportunities that god has given us in
[45:18] this day one of the things that we in
[45:21] fact is i if i background at all it
[45:23] would just be to touch the last
[45:25] uh note
[45:27] that we
[45:28] had
[45:29] um
[45:31] it in in part one
[45:33] and that was how
[45:35] that
[45:36] you know god has sometimes orchestrated
[45:39] trials for us amen and we find out that
[45:43] he allows challenges often in the first
[45:46] place you remember the point that we
[45:48] made that was bizarre to me when i
[45:50] thought it through i thought wow here is
[45:52] jehoshaphat
[45:53] and
[45:54] either he's saying to the lord here
[45:57] comes an enemy and this is very complex
[46:00] lord it's very convoluted there's a lot
[46:02] of moving parts they're coming basically
[46:04] to kill us all and you wouldn't let
[46:07] joshua wipe them out all those years ago
[46:10] and this is how they repay us and now
[46:12] joshua could have beat them we can't we
[46:14] have no might against them they're much
[46:16] larger than us and we don't really have
[46:18] a fighting force that can meet them in
[46:19] the field and he actually said what we
[46:23] have been forced to say many times in
[46:26] this troubling age we don't know what to
[46:29] do
[46:31] how many have ever been there
[46:32] where the situation you were facing you
[46:34] were just in prayer and you were just
[46:36] saying to the lord i don't know what to
[46:38] do help me tell me what to do
[46:41] and and the lord comes on the scene to
[46:43] basically say you're not even going to
[46:45] have to fight now i want you to go
[46:47] prepared for battle but i'm actually
[46:49] going to do all the fighting i just want
[46:50] you to go watch it
[46:52] and and and then they do and god does
[46:55] and
[46:56] that's it enemy vanquished god's family
[46:59] saved the
[47:01] the history book records it amen and we
[47:04] rejoice over it but it occurred to me i
[47:06] thought to myself i said well you know
[47:09] there's nothing hidden from god he
[47:10] already knows what he's going to do
[47:12] before the foundation of the world amen
[47:14] you believe you have that kind of god
[47:16] well then if god already knew that he
[47:18] was going to do that then and he was
[47:20] just going to go wipe them out then why
[47:22] go through all of that drama why not
[47:24] just why even let it happen
[47:26] lord your
[47:28] lord comes on the scene and gets you out
[47:30] of a jam and helps you and you sit back
[47:32] and go wow lord i i sure am grateful you
[47:35] saved me but boy i could have done to
[47:37] not go through that
[47:38] well actually that's wrong you needed to
[47:41] go through that
[47:42] and so god has designed it even though
[47:45] god already knows
[47:47] you're going to ask him for help he
[47:49] already knows he's going to do it he
[47:51] already knows what the end's going to be
[47:53] but we found out that god when it comes
[47:56] to his offspring you know they had this
[47:59] pre-programmed
[48:01] uh sixth sense from the before the
[48:04] foundation of the world that was put in
[48:06] them by a gene of god and we find that
[48:09] it becomes obvious that sometimes god is
[48:13] taking you to a blessing through a fight
[48:17] and it becomes obvious that he obviously
[48:20] wanted them to go through that because
[48:22] he doesn't do anything without a purpose
[48:24] so you know you're here today now maybe
[48:26] you're not on the other side of a hard
[48:28] trial yet and you're still waiting on
[48:30] god even maybe to tell you what to do or
[48:32] what he's going to do but i'm here to
[48:34] tell you god's in control god's got it
[48:38] don't worry walk on trust the lord are
[48:41] you a christian
[48:42] then you can't lose
[48:44] is he your father then you're going to
[48:47] amen see so so the devil has no say in
[48:52] the life of god's family now the bible
[48:55] says he with his own children he can put
[48:58] move do whatever he wants to do with him
[49:00] whatever he listed but with god's family
[49:02] satan has no jurisdiction over god's
[49:05] family and you need to understand that
[49:07] every movement he makes against you he
[49:09] has to have express permission from god
[49:12] to do it
[49:14] amen
[49:15] and so what does a trial do
[49:18] a trial gives you
[49:20] an opportunity for victory
[49:23] what does your victory do bring him
[49:25] glory
[49:27] he intends at the end of the age to sit
[49:31] in the throne of his glory that's
[49:34] matthew 25 he's intending to sit in the
[49:37] throne of his glory you're his glory
[49:39] he's intending to sit with you in the
[49:42] throne together amen the spirit and the
[49:45] bride say come amen so we find then that
[49:49] sometimes the only way to a blessing is
[49:52] through a fight and sometimes god wants
[49:54] to fight his enemies through his family
[49:57] that can seem counterintuitive but
[49:59] that's the way god has designed it to
[50:02] happen
[50:03] he gives these opportunities he he's
[50:05] offering an opportunity here to these
[50:07] women he's saying you know first don't
[50:10] be afraid here's your opportunity don't
[50:12] be afraid
[50:13] uh you i'm going to comfort you you're
[50:15] seeking jesus well he's not here
[50:17] see he's risen so rejoice he's risen
[50:21] he's not dead now here's another
[50:23] opportunity go quickly tell his
[50:25] disciples and peter that he's alive and
[50:28] and this is an opportunity for them what
[50:30] if those women which they very easily
[50:32] could have done though god knew they
[50:33] wouldn't
[50:34] but with free moral agency they could
[50:36] have they left there afraid and the
[50:38] bible says they spoke to no man what if
[50:40] they if their fear was so great they
[50:42] didn't even go tell the disciples
[50:45] how many times listen friends brother
[50:47] branham taught us that that that you
[50:50] actually can step off into into
[50:52] permissive will and that never ends well
[50:56] now god works it around to get you back
[50:58] to his perfect will and that sometimes
[51:00] is a long road to ho
[51:02] and sometimes i'm just here to tell you
[51:04] the permissive will of god will get you
[51:07] to where god wants to get you but it's
[51:09] not going to be fun and you'd better
[51:11] you'll be better off to just stay in his
[51:14] perfect will
[51:16] so he gives us an opportunity you have
[51:19] an opportunity here today to follow his
[51:21] word or not
[51:22] and that's what we were showing you uh
[51:25] last sunday you can follow it
[51:27] the option's yours he won't force you
[51:30] you can follow it and gain the blessing
[51:32] or not
[51:34] see
[51:35] and so if you're his child then you
[51:36] might be in for some child training
[51:39] he said that
[51:41] we we we we didn't read it last time um
[51:45] micah who's beside you is that g give me
[51:47] uh give me uh acts 1 10.
[51:50] give me acts 1 10. we referred to this
[51:53] last time but we didn't i don't remember
[51:55] reading it but i thought that we would
[51:57] look at it as an example and while they
[51:59] looked steadfastly toward heaven as he
[52:02] went up behold two men catch it two men
[52:05] stood by them in white apparel
[52:08] next
[52:09] which also said you men of galilee why
[52:12] stand ye gazing up into heaven this same
[52:15] jesus which is taken up from you into
[52:17] heaven shall so come in like manner as
[52:20] you have seen him go into heaven so now
[52:23] we find that jesus had
[52:25] given them an opportunity
[52:27] to go and be endued with power from on
[52:31] high we're not talking about any power
[52:32] we're talking about power from on high
[52:35] now i can't imagine a christian wouldn't
[52:37] want that
[52:38] amen and here they're giving a given an
[52:41] opportunity and an instruction by the
[52:43] lord say oh he gave him an instruction
[52:45] he gave them an opportunity to obey an
[52:47] instruction
[52:49] he's saying to them
[52:50] there's going to be
[52:52] a a fulfillment of prophecy
[52:55] and if you're there when it happens
[52:58] you'll get the benefit
[53:00] if you're not you won't or you might not
[53:04] and and that's why paul said there's
[53:06] more than 500 people the bible says
[53:09] above 500 people standing here saw heard
[53:13] what he said saw him go up as if they i
[53:16] mean you're talking about a miracle
[53:18] imagine standing talking to someone and
[53:20] they just lift off the ground and
[53:21] disappear into the clouds i'm pretty
[53:22] sure i'm going to do what they said
[53:24] i'm going to go and wait for this power
[53:26] because wow that was pretty impressive
[53:28] amen
[53:29] and yet by the time that the prophecy
[53:32] came to pass and the prophecy wasn't
[53:34] late
[53:35] it had to wait 10 days that wasn't all
[53:39] exactly explained to them but god
[53:41] doesn't always exactly explain he gives
[53:44] you an opportunity to obey him
[53:47] he already knows the reward waiting on
[53:49] the other side of obedience you can go
[53:52] get it or you can miss it
[53:55] brother branham talks about
[53:57] in a prayer line
[53:59] where he's speaking to him
[54:02] excuse me
[54:04] and
[54:05] he says
[54:07] sir
[54:08] he says
[54:09] stand up
[54:10] you're you're healed jesus christ makes
[54:12] you whole the man was
[54:14] there as a as a
[54:16] sir stand up jesus christ makes you
[54:18] whole and the man never moved
[54:21] and brother branham said it again giving
[54:23] him the benefit of the doubt maybe he
[54:24] didn't hear it right sir you're healed
[54:26] jesus christ makes you whole stand up
[54:28] and the man sit there and then it became
[54:30] apparent he just wasn't going to do it
[54:33] sir jesus christ makes you well stand to
[54:35] your feet and the man wouldn't and
[54:38] brother branham's next line is
[54:40] very well sir jesus christ passes you
[54:43] by.
[54:46] this ain't no joke
[54:49] god is a serious man
[54:51] you understand and he he's serious about
[54:53] his word
[54:55] he had given them a great opportunity to
[54:58] go and receive power from on high this
[55:01] power
[55:02] would give them what every real believer
[55:04] wants and that's overcoming victory in
[55:06] our lives
[55:08] there's nothing to depress a believer
[55:10] more than failure there's i mean that
[55:13] that's that's far worse than losing
[55:16] money or losing something
[55:19] maybe somebody you know boosts your car
[55:21] on you and you come out and it's gone
[55:23] that that that's bad but let me you got
[55:25] insurance for that but listen friends
[55:27] when you're
[55:28] when you're living a life of failure and
[55:31] but yet you know you love god and you
[55:33] believe his word and you believe this
[55:35] message and you know what's possible but
[55:38] you're not living there that's doom and
[55:40] gloom
[55:42] i don't care how bright the day is for
[55:44] you it's not bright
[55:45] i don't care what kind of things are
[55:47] happening in your life your bank account
[55:49] might be swelling you might have more
[55:51] friends than you've ever had but i'm
[55:52] here to tell you at the end of the day
[55:54] when push comes to shove you're going to
[55:56] go to bed at night and you're going to
[55:58] lay in a dark room with your head
[56:00] staring at a dark ceiling and you're
[56:01] gonna hear that voice adam where art
[56:04] thou adam
[56:06] that's not a fun voice to hear no real
[56:09] believer wants to hear that if you and
[56:12] if you don't mind that and then you
[56:14] probably enjoy the siren song of
[56:17] laodicea that probably it dances to your
[56:20] tune but i'm here to tell you it doesn't
[56:22] it doesn't float my boat i don't dance
[56:24] to that i hate the siren song of
[56:26] laodicea and if i find my flesh
[56:29] following it even a little bit i'm like
[56:31] my goodness snap out of it come to your
[56:33] senses what are you doing
[56:35] because i want to live in victory i want
[56:39] to live with the power of god moving and
[56:41] flowing through my life i'm not in this
[56:43] thing this is not organized religion god
[56:45] didn't give you another denomination he
[56:47] gave you an opportunity at the living
[56:50] word
[56:51] and it could live in you and through you
[56:55] or
[56:56] not amen
[57:00] so the opportunity the world misses out
[57:03] on by declining
[57:05] to consider this great message that's
[57:08] brought to us it takes my breath away at
[57:10] times because they decline to hear it
[57:13] it's not
[57:14] it's not for them you know i
[57:18] and i don't want to get ahead of myself
[57:20] but
[57:21] but you know they
[57:23] you you can see
[57:25] history repeating itself constantly you
[57:27] see that mankind is constantly doomed to
[57:30] repeat
[57:31] his failures he never learns from his
[57:34] past history
[57:35] and so he's doomed to always repeat his
[57:37] failures that's a common saying that's
[57:39] actually based on scripture
[57:42] that solomon said there's really
[57:43] actually nothing new under the sun
[57:46] that whatever is going to be has
[57:47] actually already happened and whatever
[57:50] you know whatever is happening has
[57:52] already happened and whatever has
[57:53] happened will happen again
[57:55] and so so we find then that that you say
[57:58] well then what is this life really about
[58:02] well i can tell you what it's not about
[58:05] it's not about this life it's about the
[58:08] next one
[58:09] this life is only a proving grounds it's
[58:13] only a training field
[58:15] getting you ready for life i promise you
[58:18] friends i don't care how well you're
[58:19] doing in this life you're not really
[58:21] living very much
[58:22] there's a place coming where life is
[58:24] going to be perfect and flawless and no
[58:28] more anxieties or stresses or fears or
[58:31] harm or loss or separation
[58:34] there's purpose in life on the other
[58:36] side we're not going to sit on clouds
[58:38] playing a heart that's not what heaven's
[58:40] about
[58:41] heaven is an opportunity
[58:43] to advance the bible speaks of the
[58:46] kingdom of christ
[58:47] that of his kingdom there's the of the
[58:50] increase
[58:52] the perpetual increase of his kingdom
[58:55] there shall be no end
[58:59] i want to be a part of that
[59:01] they say they can't find the borders of
[59:03] of space and they think maybe space is
[59:06] ever expanding i just say good an
[59:08] ever-expanding kingdom is going to need
[59:10] an ever-expanding universe
[59:12] i want to go i want to be there i want
[59:14] to be a part of that that's what i'm
[59:16] aiming at that's what i'm living for
[59:18] i've long ago
[59:21] threw down the pursuit
[59:22] of happiness in this world i'm plenty
[59:25] happy but my only joy comes from the
[59:27] blessing of the lord
[59:29] see
[59:30] because there's nothing satan's going to
[59:32] give you listen young people there's
[59:34] nothing satan's going to give you that's
[59:35] going to give you happiness
[59:37] it can give you pleasure
[59:39] but it's not happiness
[59:41] pleasure doesn't always equal happiness
[59:42] sometimes pleasure leaves you less happy
[59:45] see
[59:46] and so
[59:47] so we find that the world declines
[59:51] this message that god has done something
[59:53] so great brother brother jd was laying
[59:55] that out this morning and we were in the
[59:57] back office just preaching to each other
[59:59] rejoicing over what god has done and
[1:00:02] my the history is so
[1:00:04] is so confirmed and and prophecy you can
[1:00:07] overlay it with history and it matches
[1:00:09] just like like a hand on a a hand in a
[1:00:12] glove it dovetails perfectly the ages
[1:00:15] the trumpets the seals the vials it all
[1:00:17] just it all hits synchronously and god
[1:00:20] is doing it all
[1:00:22] and you're right in the big middle of it
[1:00:24] and it's all happening you're you're in
[1:00:26] a convergence friends do you know that
[1:00:28] you're in a convergence of events that
[1:00:31] are unparalleled in history wake up and
[1:00:33] understand that
[1:00:34] no age has ever experienced the
[1:00:37] convergence you're in
[1:00:39] do you know that amos 9 tells us how
[1:00:41] that at the one of the there's three
[1:00:43] element three converging elements
[1:00:45] of that that the the people remember the
[1:00:48] bible talks about the people upon whom
[1:00:50] the ends of the world have come
[1:00:52] they have a trifecta of convergence
[1:00:55] according to amos 9 14 i believe it is
[1:00:58] you have the reapers who are in the
[1:01:01] field remember jesus said the field is
[1:01:03] the world
[1:01:04] and they're they're trying to gather the
[1:01:05] last remnants they're just gleaning the
[1:01:07] last remnant because this message went
[1:01:09] global
[1:01:10] this message because of technology went
[1:01:12] to all the jungles and everywhere it's
[1:01:14] all over the world and that's when jesus
[1:01:16] said the end would come when this gospel
[1:01:18] this original one not not a not a
[1:01:20] denominational middle-aged version of it
[1:01:24] because john wesley's age accomplished a
[1:01:26] lot of that but when this original
[1:01:28] gospel goes to all the world then shall
[1:01:31] the end come and and you realize that
[1:01:34] that the the revival has been so great
[1:01:36] so global over so many years it's taken
[1:01:39] us way longer to gather up all the
[1:01:42] sheaves and we didn't we never thought
[1:01:43] we'd still be here in 2021
[1:01:45] we thought we'd be long ago gone we you
[1:01:47] know my wife said my parents never
[1:01:49] thought their kids would go to school
[1:01:51] and that was me and then i thought well
[1:01:53] my kids will certainly never go and
[1:01:55] they're sitting here with kids who are
[1:01:56] in school
[1:01:59] amen and so
[1:02:00] so so so we find that that god keeps
[1:02:04] moving in his word and we're gathering
[1:02:07] trying to because when you gather that
[1:02:09] last one we're out of here
[1:02:12] but it talks about a convergence that
[1:02:14] before the reapers can even clear the
[1:02:17] field
[1:02:18] then the plowmen
[1:02:20] are coming in for sowing for the next
[1:02:22] event which is the gospel going back to
[1:02:24] the to moses through moses and elijah to
[1:02:26] pick up the elected israel
[1:02:28] and then above all of that tying the two
[1:02:30] together is the treader of grapes
[1:02:32] waiting to start a tribulation
[1:02:34] and no wonder friends do you understand
[1:02:37] sometimes we look at these things like
[1:02:38] covet and we look at these pandemics and
[1:02:40] and call a pandemic call them a pandemic
[1:02:43] brother branham called it a pandemonic
[1:02:45] and so whatever you want to call it but
[1:02:47] you under we and we say my goodness this
[1:02:49] is almost like pre-tribulation judgments
[1:02:51] but yeah we go wait a minute we're not
[1:02:52] supposed to be here for the tribulation
[1:02:54] that's scripture and and the reason that
[1:02:56] it seems like that is because there's a
[1:02:59] triple conversion we're trying to get
[1:03:01] the last seed moses and elijah that
[1:03:03] anointing for the jews is coming on it's
[1:03:05] moving politics
[1:03:07] and the treasure of grapes is already
[1:03:09] we're already feeling the effect of that
[1:03:11] you're living in this convergence right
[1:03:14] now it's happening in real time
[1:03:18] and you're right in the big middle of it
[1:03:20] don't be asleep at the switch don't
[1:03:22] think it's just life's gonna just keep
[1:03:24] going on it can't just keep going on
[1:03:30] do you know why world war one started
[1:03:33] because it was prophecy to do it
[1:03:36] do you know why it stopped because it
[1:03:37] was prophecy that it would stop do you
[1:03:39] know why the second woe started because
[1:03:40] it was prophecy that it would do you
[1:03:42] know when it why it stopped because it
[1:03:44] accomplished what it was to do you think
[1:03:46] world war iii is not coming
[1:03:48] do you think every every event in
[1:03:51] history is
[1:03:52] is connected to prophecy and they've hit
[1:03:55] 100 percent and they've never not hit
[1:03:58] 100 percent and somehow the world is
[1:04:00] things well we're just going to go on
[1:04:02] and on and on and on it's that's
[1:04:04] impossible
[1:04:06] you're you're you're you're those upon
[1:04:08] whom the ends of the world have come
[1:04:12] and all the political and all the
[1:04:14] religious and all the demon powers
[1:04:16] brother branham talked about that triple
[1:04:17] union
[1:04:18] of political religious and demon powers
[1:04:21] converging together to take a world into
[1:04:24] destruction i'm going to tell you
[1:04:26] something friends
[1:04:27] this is this is this is serious this is
[1:04:30] an hour to be deadly serious with god
[1:04:32] it's not an hour to be playing church
[1:04:34] that's always been true but it's never
[1:04:36] been more true than it is now
[1:04:39] you've got an opportunity to live above
[1:04:41] it
[1:04:43] or not
[1:04:45] you've got an opportunity to be
[1:04:48] resistant to its effects or not
[1:04:52] the opportunity is yours today i can't
[1:04:54] make you take it the lord won't make you
[1:04:56] take it
[1:04:57] but you have an opportunity
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:01] every man i don't every man has an
[1:05:03] opportunity at eternal life that that
[1:05:06] that doesn't we're not preaching on
[1:05:08] election versus a remnant we're not
[1:05:09] talking about that today election is
[1:05:11] just origin but every man is given an
[1:05:13] opportunity
[1:05:14] but but but by and large men won't
[1:05:17] choose it just like they won't choose
[1:05:19] this message though it hits on all
[1:05:20] cylinders they won't choose it
[1:05:22] it's provable by history alone it's
[1:05:25] provable
[1:05:27] and so so we find that the world is
[1:05:30] determined to have
[1:05:31] its sinful way if you look let's go get
[1:05:34] into isaiah chapter 28.
[1:05:37] i want to i want to just take a read
[1:05:39] through this this morning while i've
[1:05:41] still got enough time to do it
[1:05:43] otherwise i won't get to it at the end
[1:05:46] isaiah chapter 28
[1:05:49] and i i want to just we might as well
[1:05:51] just start at one and we're just going
[1:05:52] to probably read all the way through it
[1:05:54] i just want you to and i'll comment
[1:05:55] along as i go
[1:05:57] now here here is this is the judgment of
[1:06:00] ephraim now it's interesting because
[1:06:03] ephraim
[1:06:04] and dan those two tribes
[1:06:07] now don't read ahead of me everybody
[1:06:09] look this way okay
[1:06:11] ephraim and dan
[1:06:13] were blotted out from inheritance
[1:06:16] from under heaven
[1:06:18] now you and in fact is
[1:06:20] when you read about it in the old
[1:06:22] testament
[1:06:23] when you come to the book of revelation
[1:06:26] and you you go into
[1:06:28] uh chapter 7 to read about the 144 000
[1:06:32] they're not there
[1:06:33] because they were blotted out from under
[1:06:35] heaven
[1:06:36] and in fact is
[1:06:37] you you would you would have all hope
[1:06:40] lost
[1:06:41] except way back in isaiah i think isaiah
[1:06:44] 48 if that's from off top my head
[1:06:47] isaiah 48
[1:06:50] shows them in the millennium
[1:06:53] see has them back in the millennium and
[1:06:55] brother branham picks that up in the
[1:06:56] seals and says see
[1:06:58] brother branham is basically saying and
[1:07:00] i don't have the quotes here but he's
[1:07:02] basically saying you know nothing's
[1:07:03] going to trump election because they
[1:07:05] were god's family and even paul paul
[1:07:07] said nothing can separate me from that
[1:07:09] so if nothing can separate me from being
[1:07:11] a son of god then even me can't separate
[1:07:13] me
[1:07:14] thank god because i would have
[1:07:17] many times i would have disqualified
[1:07:18] myself so would you
[1:07:20] a man you probably did enough
[1:07:21] disqualification moves this week alone
[1:07:23] to get kicked to the to the side amen
[1:07:27] god even sees the thoughts you have
[1:07:30] see
[1:07:31] and so that's why the bible says any
[1:07:32] thought that exalts itself against the
[1:07:34] word of god needs to be brought to the
[1:07:36] holy ghost because he'll kill it on the
[1:07:37] spot if you'll do that if you don't
[1:07:39] it'll it'll
[1:07:40] it'll allow
[1:07:42] it'll grow
[1:07:44] it'll it'll it'll grow inside you and
[1:07:46] become a deed every false wrong deed
[1:07:49] started with a false wrong thought that
[1:07:50] you entertained and wouldn't let go and
[1:07:52] give it to god see
[1:07:54] and a lot of times you put those
[1:07:56] thoughts in there by the poisons you
[1:07:57] feed on in this world
[1:07:59] this ain't rocket science
[1:08:02] this is just simple easy peasy stuff
[1:08:04] that makes sense you feed on poison you
[1:08:07] get
[1:08:08] sick you don't need a seventh seal to
[1:08:11] understand that
[1:08:12] you you drink poison you get sick
[1:08:15] you eat bad food you get sick
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:20] and so so so we we find then that
[1:08:24] ephraim you're going to read about their
[1:08:26] why they got kicked out of inheritance
[1:08:29] but brother branham says notice they
[1:08:31] were blotted out from under heaven
[1:08:34] not in heaven
[1:08:36] now now you say oh wow
[1:08:38] okay well then they made it anyway but
[1:08:42] they were they eliminated their own
[1:08:45] tribe
[1:08:46] from even being considered an election
[1:08:49] because in the 144 000 that's the elect
[1:08:52] jews at the last day ephraim's not
[1:08:54] listed there
[1:08:56] they literally
[1:08:58] doomed their own self to not even be
[1:09:01] considered in that list they were
[1:09:03] blotted out already from under heaven
[1:09:05] and when the list of elected jews the
[1:09:08] 144 thousand 12 000 out of each tribe
[1:09:11] ephraim and dan are missing because they
[1:09:14] judged themselves unworthy of it and
[1:09:17] eliminated their own opportunity to
[1:09:19] receive moses and elijah
[1:09:22] that's that's what
[1:09:24] that's what neglecting so greatest
[1:09:26] salvation can do
[1:09:29] the apostle says how shall we escape if
[1:09:31] we neglect so great of salvation you
[1:09:33] know what the answer is you won't
[1:09:36] escape
[1:09:37] you won't escape that you'll pay a toll
[1:09:40] and satan will exact a heavy toll
[1:09:44] a terrible price
[1:09:46] sin pays wages as i said last time it's
[1:09:49] not wages you can decline sin pays wages
[1:09:52] and and the and the wages of sin are
[1:09:55] death
[1:09:56] so you're going to choose pleasures of
[1:09:59] sin for a season over the joy of the
[1:10:03] lord for all eternity
[1:10:07] you say well when you say it like that
[1:10:08] wow it sounds pretty dumb it's always
[1:10:10] been dumb
[1:10:12] no matter how i describe it that's
[1:10:14] that's the worst deal in the ever
[1:10:16] written
[1:10:18] and yet overwhelming numbers of people
[1:10:20] take that deal every day
[1:10:23] i mean we could have people sitting in
[1:10:24] this service today we'll go right out of
[1:10:25] here and take that deal
[1:10:27] see
[1:10:29] and so so we find that this is what
[1:10:31] happened to ephraim all right let's go
[1:10:33] to verse 1.
[1:10:35] now follow along with me we'll we'll
[1:10:36] i'll break and comment
[1:10:38] uh
[1:10:39] as i go
[1:10:41] so woe to the crown of pride to the
[1:10:43] drunkards of ephraim whose glorious
[1:10:45] beauty is a fading flower
[1:10:48] see if they're a fading flower then they
[1:10:50] hadn't always been that they had at one
[1:10:51] time been a beautiful flower
[1:10:53] which are on the head of the fat valleys
[1:10:56] of them that are overcome with wine
[1:10:59] behold the lord hath a mighty and strong
[1:11:02] one which as a tempest of hail and a
[1:11:05] destroying storm as a flood of mighty
[1:11:07] waters overflowing shall cast down to
[1:11:10] the earth with the hand the crown of
[1:11:13] pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be
[1:11:15] trodden under feet and the glorious
[1:11:17] beauty
[1:11:18] which is on the head of the fat valley
[1:11:21] shall be a fading flower
[1:11:23] and as the hasty fruit before the summer
[1:11:26] which when he that looketh upon it seeth
[1:11:29] while it is yet in his hand he eateth it
[1:11:32] up in that day watch this now in that
[1:11:35] day shall the lord of host
[1:11:38] be for a crown of glory and for a diadem
[1:11:41] of beauty unto the residue of his people
[1:11:44] and for a spirit of judgment to him that
[1:11:47] sitteth in judgment and for strength to
[1:11:49] them that turn the battle to the gate
[1:11:52] verse
[1:11:52] 7. now watch he's going to begin to
[1:11:55] bring a warning to jerusalem
[1:11:58] but they also have aired through wine
[1:12:01] and through strong drink are out of the
[1:12:02] way the priest and the prophet have
[1:12:04] aired through strong drink they're
[1:12:06] swallowed up of wine they are out of the
[1:12:08] way through strong drink they air in
[1:12:10] vision they stumble in judgment
[1:12:13] for all tables are full of vomit and
[1:12:16] filthiness so that there is no place
[1:12:19] clean now that's that scripture is is in
[1:12:24] living color
[1:12:25] today
[1:12:26] in denominational systems because this
[1:12:28] they're what you see today is they're
[1:12:30] making the same mistake israel made
[1:12:32] the exact same mistake all right
[1:12:34] for all tables are full of vomit and
[1:12:36] filthiness so that there is no place
[1:12:38] clean
[1:12:39] whom shall now watch this whom this is a
[1:12:42] long lengthy question
[1:12:44] whom shall he teach knowledge and whom
[1:12:46] shall he make to understand doctrine
[1:12:49] them that are weaned from the milk and
[1:12:50] drawn from the breast
[1:12:52] see and because he reasons how how am
[1:12:55] how am i going to get this next
[1:12:57] generation to understand
[1:13:00] how who who how will i even do that how
[1:13:03] will i teach these babies who are who
[1:13:06] are weaned from milk and drawn from the
[1:13:07] breast how am i ever going to teach them
[1:13:09] knowledge because knowledge must be
[1:13:12] verse 10 precept must be upon precept
[1:13:15] precept upon precept line upon line line
[1:13:17] upon and that's what israel was refusing
[1:13:20] they were mongrelizing his word and so
[1:13:23] they they were losing out on precept
[1:13:25] upon precept line upon line they had
[1:13:28] their own theories involved in it and
[1:13:29] god is saying my goodness if that's what
[1:13:32] they're doing how will i even take these
[1:13:34] babies born into a new generation how
[1:13:36] will i ever teach them knowledge
[1:13:38] there won't be no way to do it
[1:13:41] there won't be no way to do it see
[1:13:43] that's that's his point
[1:13:45] see he goes on to give the to with the
[1:13:47] qualifications here a little in there a
[1:13:49] little verse 11
[1:13:51] for with stammering lips and another
[1:13:53] tongue will he speak to this people
[1:13:56] to whom he said this is the rest
[1:13:59] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[1:14:00] rest i'm giving you the opportunity of a
[1:14:03] lifetime
[1:14:05] and this is the refreshing
[1:14:08] yet
[1:14:09] they would not hear
[1:14:13] but the word of the lord was unto them
[1:14:15] precept upon precept precept upon
[1:14:16] precept line upon line in other words
[1:14:18] i'm not responsible i gave them thus
[1:14:20] saith the lord i proved it i vindicated
[1:14:22] it
[1:14:23] if they won't take it god is saying it's
[1:14:25] not on me
[1:14:26] it's on them they're going to suffer the
[1:14:29] consequences of the opportunity they
[1:14:31] passed on
[1:14:33] god was faithful god gave this age a
[1:14:36] faithful messenger and a faithful
[1:14:38] message and vindicated it around the
[1:14:41] world with more supernatural and and to
[1:14:44] me the greatest supernatural element of
[1:14:46] the message is what it's done to my life
[1:14:48] and what it's done to your life
[1:14:50] hallelujah
[1:14:52] and it's an opportunity of a lifetime
[1:14:55] and people would rather have
[1:14:57] they'd rather heap to themselves
[1:14:59] teachers having itching ears to tell
[1:15:00] them what they want to hear
[1:15:03] just get a preacher to tell them they're
[1:15:04] okay when they're not okay see
[1:15:09] now watch verse 13
[1:15:11] but the word of the lord was unto them
[1:15:12] precept upon precept precept upon
[1:15:15] precept line upon line line upon line
[1:15:17] here little they're little that they
[1:15:19] might go and fall backward and be broken
[1:15:23] and snared and taken
[1:15:25] in other words god
[1:15:28] once they understood once it was clear
[1:15:32] that they were going to go against the
[1:15:34] word then god doubled down to make sure
[1:15:37] it was precept upon precept
[1:15:40] line upon line it was a little bit here
[1:15:43] it was a little bit there but it was
[1:15:45] clear and i made it right and you can't
[1:15:47] accuse me of wrong and therefore
[1:15:50] you're going to destroy
[1:15:52] your own self
[1:15:54] because i brought you such a perfect
[1:15:57] word and you declined to hear it
[1:16:00] watch
[1:16:02] verse 14. wherefore hear the word of the
[1:16:03] lord you scornful men that rule this
[1:16:05] people which is in jerusalem because you
[1:16:07] have said
[1:16:08] we have made a covenant with death and
[1:16:11] with hell
[1:16:13] are we at agreement when the overflowing
[1:16:16] scourge shall pass through it shall not
[1:16:18] come unto us for we have made lies our
[1:16:20] refuge and under falsehood have we hit
[1:16:22] ourselves now hold right there on verse
[1:16:24] 15 g
[1:16:25] now i want you to notice a couple of
[1:16:26] words
[1:16:28] i want you to notice covenant
[1:16:30] i want you to notice agreement
[1:16:33] i want you to notice
[1:16:35] uh refuge
[1:16:36] and i want you to notice
[1:16:38] hidden it hid hit ourselves
[1:16:41] so these people
[1:16:43] who had enough sense about them
[1:16:46] to know
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:48] judgments are coming
[1:16:50] to know that the world is falling apart
[1:16:53] everybody can see that
[1:16:56] that's not new they say that in the
[1:16:58] headlines of the news the world is
[1:17:01] falling apart
[1:17:03] and men's hearts are failing for fear
[1:17:06] and they're running to and fro and
[1:17:07] knowledge is increased and the more
[1:17:09] knowledge they get the more death is
[1:17:11] associated with it these things are
[1:17:13] incontrovertible they're undeniable but
[1:17:16] to deny it brother branham said would be
[1:17:18] to run down in a basement board up all
[1:17:20] the windows and start screaming there is
[1:17:22] no sun there's no such a thing as the
[1:17:24] sun
[1:17:25] he said that that man would be labeled
[1:17:27] insane
[1:17:29] just because you ran down there and
[1:17:30] brought up all the windows and client
[1:17:32] claim there's no sun doesn't mean
[1:17:33] there's no sun
[1:17:34] sun's still right there
[1:17:36] see
[1:17:37] but madness has taken you to the point
[1:17:39] where you're going to openly deny it and
[1:17:41] and literally they they know the
[1:17:44] judgment is coming and so they so they
[1:17:46] realize that they need a place to hide
[1:17:50] for refuge
[1:17:52] and so they're going to enter into an
[1:17:55] agreement through a covenant
[1:17:57] and they're going to say wow
[1:18:00] danger was coming we got to hire we need
[1:18:02] to hide boys what kind of place a place
[1:18:04] of refuge where we'll be okay okay well
[1:18:06] how do we get that well i know somebody
[1:18:09] i know a guy and and i can we can enter
[1:18:12] into a covenant with him and make an
[1:18:13] agreement and then we can hide in his
[1:18:15] place of refuge
[1:18:16] good idea that'll work and then god says
[1:18:19] because you have said we made a covenant
[1:18:22] but what they didn't know is they made a
[1:18:24] covenant with death
[1:18:27] and with hell
[1:18:29] imagine that thinking you're going to
[1:18:31] escape the place
[1:18:34] that you don't want to be and that's the
[1:18:35] very covenant you make
[1:18:37] to be there
[1:18:38] see
[1:18:39] they make a covenant with death and hell
[1:18:42] are we at agreement
[1:18:44] when the overflowing scourge shall pass
[1:18:46] through it shall not come to us for we
[1:18:48] have made here's what they didn't know
[1:18:50] here's what they didn't know we made
[1:18:52] lies our refuge
[1:18:55] and under falsehood have we hid
[1:18:58] ourselves
[1:19:00] and god says verse 16 therefore thus
[1:19:02] saith the lord god behold i lay in zion
[1:19:05] for a foundation a stone tried a stone a
[1:19:07] precious cornerstone a sure foundation
[1:19:10] he that believeth shall not make haste
[1:19:12] judgment also will i lay to the line in
[1:19:14] righteousness to the plummet and the
[1:19:17] hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies
[1:19:19] and the water shall overflow the hiding
[1:19:21] place and your covenant with death shall
[1:19:23] be disannulled and your agreement with
[1:19:25] hell shall not stand when the
[1:19:27] overflowing scourge shall pass through
[1:19:30] then shall ye be trodden down by it
[1:19:34] from the time that it goeth forth it
[1:19:35] shall take it shall take you for morning
[1:19:38] by morning shall it pass over by day and
[1:19:40] by night and it shall be a vexation only
[1:19:43] to understand the report see for the for
[1:19:47] the bed is shorter than a man can
[1:19:49] stretch himself on this is describing
[1:19:51] sin
[1:19:52] this is the vexation
[1:19:54] of choosing lies as your shelter
[1:19:57] now
[1:19:58] you know you've heard me many years
[1:20:00] bethel tabernacle tell you what is the
[1:20:03] worst form of deception there's many
[1:20:05] kinds but there's one that's
[1:20:06] particularly grievous and that's
[1:20:08] self-deception
[1:20:10] that's the worst kind of deception see
[1:20:13] and he says now watch
[1:20:15] here's the grievousness of choosing sin
[1:20:17] for the bed is shorter than a man can
[1:20:19] stretch himself on that's that's not a
[1:20:21] good night's sleep
[1:20:22] and the covering narrower than he can
[1:20:25] wrap himself in it that's miserable for
[1:20:28] the lord shall rise up and mount perism
[1:20:32] he shall be wrath as in the valley of
[1:20:34] gibeon that he may do his work his
[1:20:37] strange work and bring to pass his act
[1:20:39] his strange act now therefore
[1:20:42] be not markers lest your bands be made
[1:20:44] strong for i have heard from the lord
[1:20:46] god of host a consumption even
[1:20:48] determined upon the whole earth give you
[1:20:50] ear
[1:20:51] hear my voice hearken and hear my speech
[1:20:56] here's an opportunity to not go in a
[1:20:59] tribulation
[1:21:00] take it or leave it here's an
[1:21:03] opportunity to be counted among the
[1:21:05] redeemed or not
[1:21:08] see
[1:21:09] verse 24 that the plowman plow all date
[1:21:12] is doth he does he open and break the
[1:21:15] clods of his ground when he has made
[1:21:17] plain the face thereof doth does he not
[1:21:20] cast abroad the fetches and scatter the
[1:21:22] cumin and cast in the principal wheat
[1:21:25] and the appointed barley and the rye in
[1:21:27] their place in other words do you think
[1:21:29] god's just doing this for no purpose
[1:21:32] do you not i mean would a farmer just
[1:21:35] take a plow into the field and just plow
[1:21:37] forever
[1:21:38] why is he plowing to sow seed why is he
[1:21:41] selling seed to raise a crop
[1:21:43] and and the prophet is saying to you do
[1:21:45] you think god is just plowing do you
[1:21:47] think time's just going to go on do you
[1:21:49] think this thing will just keep going on
[1:21:50] and on i'm here to tell you it won't no
[1:21:52] more than a farmer would do that
[1:21:55] can you get the farmer can you see that
[1:21:56] analogy yeah no farmer would do that
[1:21:58] neither will god
[1:22:02] he expects a harvest and he's going to
[1:22:04] get a harvest
[1:22:06] and whatever doesn't go into the harvest
[1:22:07] goes into the furnace
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:13] for his god doth instruct him verse 26
[1:22:15] to discretion and doth teach him for the
[1:22:18] fitches are not threshed with the
[1:22:19] threshing instrument neither is a
[1:22:20] cartwheel turned about upon the coma but
[1:22:23] the fitches are beaten out with a staff
[1:22:26] and the cumin with a rod bread corn is
[1:22:28] bruised because he will not ever be
[1:22:31] threshing it see nor break it with the
[1:22:34] wheel of the cart nor bruise it with the
[1:22:35] horseman this also cometh forth from the
[1:22:38] lord of hosts which is wonderful in
[1:22:40] council and excellent in working in
[1:22:42] other words god knows how to handle you
[1:22:45] god's not going to treat corn the same
[1:22:46] way he would treat cooma he's not going
[1:22:48] to treat fetches the same way he treats
[1:22:49] this that or the other god some of it
[1:22:51] he's going to put under will some of it
[1:22:53] he's going to do this somebody's going
[1:22:54] to do that someone but he won't do this
[1:22:55] that's you that's me we're all different
[1:22:57] god knows me god knows you he knows what
[1:23:00] i need he knows what you need all he
[1:23:02] needs you to do is is give in and say
[1:23:05] lord harvest me
[1:23:08] harvest me grow me to a harvest however
[1:23:12] you need to
[1:23:14] i'm not going to compare myself to this
[1:23:16] person because i might not be the same
[1:23:18] type you might need a different way to
[1:23:20] deal with me so deal with me the way i
[1:23:22] need to be dealt with
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:27] verse chapter 29
[1:23:31] woe to ariel this is jerusalem
[1:23:34] woe to ariel to ariel the city where
[1:23:37] david dwelt
[1:23:38] add ye year to year let them kill
[1:23:41] sacrifices yet i will distress ariel
[1:23:44] and there shall be heaviness and sorrow
[1:23:47] and it shall be unto me as aerial and in
[1:23:49] other words i know what i'm doing and i
[1:23:51] will camp against thee round about and
[1:23:53] will lay siege against it against thee
[1:23:55] with the mount and i will raise forts
[1:23:57] against thee and thou shalt be brought
[1:23:59] down and shall speak out of the ground
[1:24:01] and thy speech shall be low out of the
[1:24:03] dust and the voice shall be as one that
[1:24:06] hath the familiar spirit out of the
[1:24:08] ground and thy speech shall whisper out
[1:24:10] of the dust
[1:24:12] this is this is what god is saying
[1:24:15] this is the consequence
[1:24:17] of the options you chose
[1:24:21] i gave you an opportunity you go back
[1:24:24] into into the old testament deeply
[1:24:27] and god has
[1:24:29] a covenants of blessing
[1:24:31] and he has covenants of chastisement
[1:24:34] and they're they're both love
[1:24:36] you understand god loves his family
[1:24:39] he loves israel that's why he won't let
[1:24:41] him off the hook
[1:24:43] so you you've got the option
[1:24:45] listen god is not some evil ogre i'm not
[1:24:49] here today to tell you that this
[1:24:51] horrible god who wipes out people
[1:24:54] you know
[1:24:55] are you an evil ogre because you correct
[1:24:57] your children in love
[1:25:00] what would you do as a parent he's not a
[1:25:03] he's not a tyrant he's a father
[1:25:08] he has a family
[1:25:10] what would you do with a disobedient
[1:25:12] child you would chastise him in love
[1:25:15] what do you do with a child that's
[1:25:16] obedient compliant and does the chores
[1:25:18] and keeps his word and is honest and
[1:25:20] helps the family what do you do you pour
[1:25:22] blessing upon that child what do you do
[1:25:25] to the child who's arrogant nasty and
[1:25:27] horrible you you don't poor blessing
[1:25:30] i hope you're not that stupid
[1:25:34] that's why children rise up to torment
[1:25:36] their parents in the last days because
[1:25:38] they've stopped correcting
[1:25:41] are you an evil ogre for doing that
[1:25:44] are you horrible for doing that wouldn't
[1:25:46] don't you want your family to be
[1:25:48] obedient fathers mothers come on don't
[1:25:51] don't go feeling bad at god don't you
[1:25:53] want your children to be obedient
[1:25:55] don't you want them to be honest decent
[1:25:58] productive people in society don't you
[1:26:00] want them to be a blessing to the home
[1:26:03] so you know what you do you take steps
[1:26:05] to ensure that and when they go sideways
[1:26:08] your love compels you to do things that
[1:26:11] they're not gonna like and even you
[1:26:13] might not like doing it you'd rather be
[1:26:15] giving them a blessing so would god
[1:26:20] amen
[1:26:22] but how do you act that that's how he
[1:26:24] acts don't don't feel bad at him you're
[1:26:27] the same way
[1:26:28] see
[1:26:29] and so so so look what he says here
[1:26:32] more verse 5
[1:26:34] moreover the multitude of thy strangers
[1:26:36] shall be like small dust in the
[1:26:38] multitude of the terrible and shall be
[1:26:39] as chaff that passes the way yea it
[1:26:42] shall be as an instant suddenly he goes
[1:26:44] on and on and on and on he verse nine he
[1:26:47] picks up the blindness of hypocrisy
[1:26:50] that's a terrible thing we you can go
[1:26:52] home and read it verse 15 he finally
[1:26:54] comes back around and begins to build
[1:26:55] hope back in them again because they are
[1:26:57] his family and they are his children and
[1:26:59] a parent doesn't whip his child all day
[1:27:03] you know what you did just stand here
[1:27:05] and i'm just going to wear you out till
[1:27:07] this time tomorrow
[1:27:10] there were times i thought sister jean
[1:27:11] would do that but she didn't actually do
[1:27:13] that
[1:27:18] but he he's he's a father so he's going
[1:27:21] to correct he has chest covenant
[1:27:23] chastisements and he has covenant
[1:27:25] blessings and so so the lord is saying
[1:27:28] here that's all gee thank you so the
[1:27:30] lord is saying that he's going to bring
[1:27:33] the city into distress
[1:27:36] this is what as a father
[1:27:38] ariel
[1:27:39] this is what i'm going to have to do to
[1:27:40] you darling i'm sorry
[1:27:42] i love you
[1:27:44] ephraim
[1:27:46] you'll be i can never lose you
[1:27:48] you are you are part of me and i'll
[1:27:51] never lose you but the choices you've
[1:27:53] made and are making are forcing my hand
[1:27:57] because i love you too much to leave you
[1:27:59] like you are
[1:28:02] and he's saying to jerusalem
[1:28:04] you know i'm going to have to bring
[1:28:06] distress i'm going to have to bring
[1:28:08] lamentation i'm going to have to turn
[1:28:10] your joy into mourning to to the degree
[1:28:13] if we keep reading and i'm not i'm not
[1:28:15] going to keep reading because we just
[1:28:16] use it all of our time but if you keep
[1:28:18] going on down through there you find out
[1:28:20] that it that that that israel becomes
[1:28:23] like an altar hearth and that it in that
[1:28:25] it would become a place of death
[1:28:28] you see here if if if we treat lightly
[1:28:33] if we treat lightly
[1:28:36] the sacrifices god has made available
[1:28:41] then we ourselves become the sacrifice
[1:28:46] let me say that again
[1:28:47] if you treat lightly the sacrifices god
[1:28:51] has made an opportunity for and made
[1:28:54] sacrifices so you could have joy
[1:28:57] sacrifices so you could have power
[1:28:59] sacrifices so you could have peace
[1:29:01] but if
[1:29:02] but something had to suffer for you to
[1:29:04] get that something died we they slew a
[1:29:06] lamb they slew a bullock jesus died on
[1:29:08] the cross amen
[1:29:10] you know but but but if you refuse if
[1:29:13] you treat lightly all of these
[1:29:15] sacrifices then you yourself become the
[1:29:18] sacrifice if we will not one one writer
[1:29:21] says if we will not accept god's
[1:29:24] substitute then we must carry the burden
[1:29:27] of our own sin
[1:29:29] good luck with that
[1:29:32] if you will not accept
[1:29:35] the sacrifice of christ to carry your
[1:29:38] sins far away then you'll have to carry
[1:29:41] your sins yourself
[1:29:45] this is this is actually why
[1:29:47] the the unwise virgin will have to be
[1:29:50] the sacrifice themselves giving their
[1:29:51] own lives in the tribulation because
[1:29:54] they rejected the sacrifice provided by
[1:29:56] the bleeding word of this hour
[1:30:00] so you know what happens to them they
[1:30:02] become the sacrifice
[1:30:03] they have to no option now now there's
[1:30:06] no opportunity because they passed on
[1:30:08] the opportunity to miss that
[1:30:10] now they're now their only opportunity
[1:30:12] is to die in the tribulation period and
[1:30:15] die and be judged for their sins because
[1:30:18] they would not allow christ to be judged
[1:30:21] for their sins
[1:30:22] because christ is his word and when he
[1:30:24] brought us his word it's a living word
[1:30:26] it's a bleeding word and when you refuse
[1:30:29] his living bleeding word then you've got
[1:30:30] to be the sacrifice
[1:30:33] you've got to go yourself if you won't
[1:30:34] take good counsel if you won't take good
[1:30:36] preaching then you'll suffer the
[1:30:37] consequences if you won't take mom and
[1:30:39] dad's godly instruction then you'll bury
[1:30:42] yourself
[1:30:44] see amen
[1:30:46] so so so then that we find that the days
[1:30:48] were coming
[1:30:50] in the millennium of course when god's
[1:30:52] going to remove
[1:30:53] all of these cursings and you know these
[1:30:55] covenant chastenings and he's going to
[1:30:57] restore
[1:30:58] uh israel to covenant blessings and so
[1:31:02] isaiah 29 now i still got you i want 15
[1:31:05] more minutes you got me
[1:31:07] all right
[1:31:08] so isaiah 28 and 29 really is a sad
[1:31:11] story
[1:31:14] about a people who were given ample
[1:31:17] opportunity to prosper under the
[1:31:20] wonderful hand of god
[1:31:22] and you read it with me you read it with
[1:31:24] me but they spurned the goodness of god
[1:31:27] and they wasted all of the promises for
[1:31:30] a better outcome
[1:31:32] they had many promises to give them a
[1:31:34] much better outcome than what you just
[1:31:36] read
[1:31:37] they made the choice knowing full well
[1:31:40] god was lined up online precept upon
[1:31:41] precept here a little there a little he
[1:31:43] warned them everywhere brought prophets
[1:31:44] raised them up showed signs and wonders
[1:31:47] see that's what's happening today
[1:31:49] the world is truly without excuse their
[1:31:52] sad end would come suddenly and when it
[1:31:54] did it wouldn't have any remedy to it so
[1:31:56] so so i you know i i
[1:31:59] i i've said many times that that the
[1:32:01] wailing the weeping and wailing in the
[1:32:04] tribulation period to me
[1:32:06] you know it's surely going to be at
[1:32:08] least in part at least in part that
[1:32:11] weeping and wailing is going to be the
[1:32:12] bitterness of missed opportunity
[1:32:15] and what could have been and
[1:32:17] what needless suffering
[1:32:20] that they must face
[1:32:22] see
[1:32:23] so
[1:32:24] so so then
[1:32:25] then that's why last last week when we
[1:32:28] read remember we took you're not gonna
[1:32:29] do it again today i don't have time but
[1:32:31] we took you to romans eight
[1:32:32] and paul showed us paul said hey
[1:32:36] set up good news pay attention to this
[1:32:38] guess what you pay you're not a debtor
[1:32:41] to flesh anymore
[1:32:43] how you like that devil we're not
[1:32:45] debtors to the flesh anymore we've been
[1:32:47] set free by the holy spirit
[1:32:50] the rest of the world they're in debt
[1:32:51] they can't escape doing evil things
[1:32:53] thinking evil things but by the blood of
[1:32:56] the lamb i'm free
[1:32:58] i'm not a debtor to the flesh i don't
[1:33:00] have to go that way anymore
[1:33:02] see
[1:33:04] there's even no temptation that can take
[1:33:07] me but god won't make but god will make
[1:33:09] a way within it that i can escape
[1:33:14] now he doesn't say you will escape
[1:33:17] he says you can
[1:33:18] you could
[1:33:20] you might not but you could
[1:33:22] i'll make a way
[1:33:24] if you'll take it
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:27] so you know you don't have to live after
[1:33:30] your flesh paul was saying you've been
[1:33:31] liberated the world of course has no
[1:33:34] such liberated liberation but you are
[1:33:36] elected in the genes of god
[1:33:38] before the foundation of the world and
[1:33:40] god being a heavenly father is simply
[1:33:42] not going to let his children misbehave
[1:33:45] without lovingly
[1:33:47] correcting them see
[1:33:49] so so brother branham makes this
[1:33:51] statement here
[1:33:53] in
[1:33:54] in the greater uh greater than solomon
[1:33:56] is here 1964. he's in a prayer this so
[1:34:00] moved me yesterday
[1:34:02] he said our heavenly father there's a
[1:34:04] prophet praying so you want to pay
[1:34:05] attention
[1:34:07] our heavenly father
[1:34:09] we
[1:34:10] are deeming this
[1:34:12] one of the most grandest privileges
[1:34:16] that we have this side of glory
[1:34:20] you're like
[1:34:21] wow i really want to know what the next
[1:34:23] line is
[1:34:25] the grandest
[1:34:27] privilege elijah you're about to tell me
[1:34:30] the secret of the ages you're about to
[1:34:32] give me insider trading info
[1:34:35] the devil's probably not going to want
[1:34:37] me to hear this hurry quickly tell me
[1:34:39] before he distracts me
[1:34:41] the grandest the grandest privilege that
[1:34:43] we have this side of glory
[1:34:48] is to meet in the congregation
[1:34:52] to come into a building and sit with
[1:34:54] your brothers and sisters and hear the
[1:34:56] gospel preached and sing the songs and
[1:34:59] raise up hands and fellowship one
[1:35:01] another see
[1:35:03] the of the
[1:35:04] to meet in the congregation of the
[1:35:05] people who believe in you that where we
[1:35:08] can expect your presence because it's
[1:35:10] according to your promise what an
[1:35:13] opportunity
[1:35:14] you have
[1:35:16] multiple times in a week to do the
[1:35:19] greatest to exercise your right to the
[1:35:22] greatest privilege grandest privilege
[1:35:26] this side of glory
[1:35:29] and people let careers keep them out of
[1:35:31] it schedule keep them out of it fear
[1:35:32] keep them out of it family keep them out
[1:35:34] of it this keep them out of it
[1:35:35] entertainment recreation
[1:35:37] and and you forsake the opportunity
[1:35:41] that god chose as the greatest tool for
[1:35:44] your strength
[1:35:47] there is a strength that you can gain
[1:35:49] from being here
[1:35:51] not just in these four walls but
[1:35:52] anywhere where the word is being
[1:35:53] preached and believers are gathering you
[1:35:55] know why because his presence
[1:35:58] is in our midst
[1:36:00] and when you're in the can you can you
[1:36:02] imagine taking lightly
[1:36:04] to be in the presence of someone who can
[1:36:06] do anything
[1:36:09] anything
[1:36:10] he can fix anything
[1:36:13] in you for you
[1:36:15] conquer anything give you anything
[1:36:18] help you no matter what it is
[1:36:22] with a with a wave of his hand drive
[1:36:24] every sickness from your body with a
[1:36:27] wave of his hand settle your mind and
[1:36:29] heart on the peace and love of god
[1:36:31] and you can be around brothers and
[1:36:32] sisters in christ and yet laodicea has
[1:36:36] deprioritized that
[1:36:38] in so many believers it's alarming
[1:36:43] it's alarming
[1:36:44] you know you you have choices you can
[1:36:46] make
[1:36:48] every young man

[1:37:06] you know is my goodness
[1:37:08] sister whatever you do find a man
[1:37:11] don't just find a male
[1:37:14] a male is one of the most dangerous
[1:37:16] animals in the planet
[1:37:18] if he's not a man my by manhood i mean
[1:37:21] character
[1:37:23] manhood is an office brothers you don't
[1:37:24] get to be a man just because you're male
[1:37:27] 1 you might be a 50 year old male and
[1:37:30] have never been a man one day in your
[1:37:32] life
[1:37:34] manhood speaks of character
[1:37:36] god said let us make man in our image
[1:37:41] after our likeness
[1:37:43] you want a happy home sister find a male
[1:37:47] who's living according to the image of
[1:37:49] god

[1:37:55] you'll you'll you'll have peace and
[1:37:57] you'll you'll have trust and you can
[1:37:58] have a family and you can pass along
[1:38:00] these great things my goodness don't go
[1:38:02] out here dressing to appease because
[1:38:05] you're never going to attract the son of
[1:38:06] god that way
[1:38:08] hear me sisters
[1:38:10] dress like the world
[1:38:11] you're never going to attract a son of
[1:38:14] god and that's the one you need
[1:38:17] you get anything less than that and you
[1:38:19] are looking for a crippled life
[1:38:22] i'm here to tell you take brother
[1:38:23] jason's word for it i've been on this
[1:38:24] planet almost six decades i've seen the
[1:38:26] good the bad and the ugly i've seen
[1:38:28] women cry and weep and sob in bitter
[1:38:31] tears because there's no way to undo it
[1:38:34] because they they got so desperate that
[1:38:36] they started letting down their own
[1:38:38] standards and all that did was put them
[1:38:39] further and further away from the son of
[1:38:40] god some god wouldn't give them time of
[1:38:42] day and so they had to settle for a male
[1:38:46] who was pretty nice kind of handsome
[1:38:49] but that don't last
[1:38:51] brother same way
[1:38:53] solomon said that a bad woman is like
[1:38:56] water in your blood you said you'd
[1:38:57] rather deal in the live in the
[1:38:59] wilderness than with that you'd rather
[1:39:00] just live on a house top never come down
[1:39:03] than to live with a contentious woman
[1:39:05] that there's nothing there's
[1:39:07] simultaneously it's it's it's a paradox
[1:39:10] there is nothing
[1:39:11] that can
[1:39:12] be so low down
[1:39:15] or so glorious to god
[1:39:18] as a female
[1:39:20] she has an opportunity to be the lowest
[1:39:23] creature on the earth
[1:39:25] and abandon her babies and cheat on her
[1:39:28] marriage vows other female animals don't
[1:39:30] do that
[1:39:33] you understand me they're not they're
[1:39:34] other female animals are not immoral
[1:39:38] only a human female can live immorally
[1:39:42] or she can be the greatest treasure and
[1:39:45] even even on the other side when brother
[1:39:47] branham crossed to the other side it
[1:39:49] wasn't the brothers who were first in
[1:39:51] line to meet him it was the ladies
[1:39:53] because they kept themselves and they
[1:39:56] became a treasure to god and brother
[1:39:59] branham scored him so high he said it's
[1:40:01] literally the greatest thing god could
[1:40:03] give a man outside of his salvation
[1:40:05] outside of eternal life a good wife
[1:40:08] is the so brothers you are to honor if
[1:40:10] you got a good wife honor her because
[1:40:12] god does
[1:40:14] so sisters if you're looking for a son
[1:40:16] of god then act like a daughter of god
[1:40:19] you'll attract the son of god see and so
[1:40:22] so you know the the world has come oh
[1:40:25] i'm gonna just use up all my time i'm
[1:40:27] not gonna get to my main thought but i
[1:40:28] don't need long to get it so just hang
[1:40:30] on
[1:40:35] brother branham says
[1:40:37] we're deeming this one of the most
[1:40:38] grandest privileges
[1:40:40] i know that's
[1:40:42] jacked up english kentucky hillbilly-ish
[1:40:44] but just take it will you
[1:40:46] it's one of the most grandest
[1:40:48] privileges that we have this site of
[1:40:51] glory is to meet in the congregation i
[1:40:55] don't hear me hear me look me in the eye
[1:40:57] i don't judge i'm not here today to make
[1:40:59] you feel bad
[1:41:00] i don't judge you i don't condemn you if
[1:41:04] you don't feel this way
[1:41:07] but i wish you did
[1:41:09] i wish you did
[1:41:11] i wish when i read this quote here you'd
[1:41:13] go yes lord
[1:41:16] yes
[1:41:16] lord if you don't feel this way i'm not
[1:41:19] here to judge or condemn you but i sure
[1:41:22] wish you did feel this way
[1:41:24] i sure wish you saw it
[1:41:27] as the greatest privilege this side of
[1:41:29] glory i'm sorry
[1:41:31] that the devil
[1:41:33] hear me now because i'm getting down
[1:41:34] this real personal
[1:41:36] i'm sorry
[1:41:38] that the devil has been able to get
[1:41:40] people
[1:41:41] to re sons and daughters of god to
[1:41:43] reduce their involvement with the family
[1:41:45] of god that breaks my heart
[1:41:50] i'm sorry
[1:41:52] that that that the devil has been able
[1:41:55] to reduce your involvement that's satan
[1:41:58] that's done that to you see
[1:42:00] the lord would have never done that
[1:42:02] that's satan that did that but you
[1:42:04] played a part
[1:42:06] amen come on be honest
[1:42:09] the lord would have never allowed him to
[1:42:12] do that to you because his word actually
[1:42:15] promises the very opposite but you
[1:42:17] played a part in that
[1:42:19] come on churches this shall be called
[1:42:21] the house of judgment
[1:42:23] let's be honest i'm in this with you
[1:42:25] friends
[1:42:26] i have to say amen to this as well or
[1:42:28] old me or oh my oh goodness
[1:42:30] lord help me
[1:42:32] i said plenty of lord help me when i was
[1:42:34] studying this
[1:42:36] see
[1:42:38] so sometimes we play a part in it god
[1:42:40] designed
[1:42:42] the plan for his family to gather
[1:42:44] together as an opportunity to receive
[1:42:46] strength from it and people allow satan
[1:42:49] to manipulate their minds manipulate
[1:42:52] their emotions draw them away i don't
[1:42:55] know troubles
[1:42:56] trials
[1:42:58] i mean who don't have them
[1:43:00] come on who don't have them
[1:43:02] troubles
[1:43:03] trials fears
[1:43:05] hurt feelings
[1:43:07] can i say this to you if you have let
[1:43:11] troubles and trials and fears and hurt
[1:43:13] feelings
[1:43:14] cause you to back away from this
[1:43:16] grandest of all privileges i'm here to
[1:43:18] tell you satan will never
[1:43:21] let you off of that merry-go-round
[1:43:24] all he'll do is when you start to get a
[1:43:27] little bit of confidence and ready to
[1:43:28] defeat it he'll bring another one and
[1:43:30] another one and another one and there's
[1:43:32] five more behind that one and ten more
[1:43:33] behind that one he will never ever let
[1:43:37] you off of that merry-go-round i say to
[1:43:40] you today jump off of it yourself
[1:43:43] just jump off of that today jesus will
[1:43:45] catch you
[1:43:48] you don't have to
[1:43:49] go in that way and so the religious
[1:43:52] leaders of the day
[1:43:54] when jesus was there and i'm coming i'm
[1:43:56] really right now near the bottom of my
[1:43:58] notes
[1:44:00] when jesus was
[1:44:02] in his day the religious leaders called
[1:44:04] him a devil
[1:44:05] it's interesting because
[1:44:07] the day before
[1:44:09] philip saw the same sign and said you're
[1:44:11] the messiah you're the king of israel
[1:44:13] and religious leaders the next day see
[1:44:14] the same sign and go oh he's be
[1:44:15] elizabeth
[1:44:17] okay wait a minute how do i i mean
[1:44:21] he he said he's the king of israel you
[1:44:23] said he's a devil
[1:44:25] and philip was a man studied in the word
[1:44:27] of god
[1:44:28] see and so so we find that
[1:44:31] that the the mystery of that because it
[1:44:34] doesn't make a lot of sense until you
[1:44:36] read in the scriptures further
[1:44:39] and you uncover a little dirty secret
[1:44:42] that they that they don't want you to
[1:44:44] know the religious leaders that the
[1:44:46] bible says
[1:44:47] for envy
[1:44:50] even pilate caught it
[1:44:53] i see what this is
[1:44:55] i'm a politician pilot thought i know
[1:44:57] politics nasty politics when i see it
[1:45:00] this is for envy this is why they hate
[1:45:03] him he's done nothing wrong he's
[1:45:05] actually done only only good but they
[1:45:06] hate him because of envy because they
[1:45:09] know they'll lose members
[1:45:10] they'll lose their position they won't
[1:45:12] have their little honey pot anymore and
[1:45:16] so it was for envy see
[1:45:20] and and and and and i see what that
[1:45:22] looks like today i see what that looks
[1:45:25] like today
[1:45:26] so in other words in other words let me
[1:45:28] make this point before i come to my con
[1:45:30] consummation
[1:45:33] i it's no mystery
[1:45:36] to me today
[1:45:38] why religious leaders
[1:45:40] reject this message
[1:45:42] because i see what it looks like when
[1:45:43] they did it back there
[1:45:45] you understand i can look in my bible i
[1:45:47] can look at the rejection you see today
[1:45:49] brother jd and i were talking about it
[1:45:51] today
[1:45:52] and and i can see why they reject him
[1:45:54] and call him a false prophet i can see
[1:45:56] why they do that because i can see why
[1:45:57] they did it to jesus so in other words i
[1:46:00] know what i'm seeing
[1:46:02] i know what i'm seeing i know that when
[1:46:05] they do it in this day it's going to
[1:46:07] look just like it did in that day
[1:46:09] you follow me you get that you you
[1:46:11] follow that
[1:46:12] so you you find that that you can these
[1:46:14] patterns are all you know all in the
[1:46:17] bible i i see what that looks like
[1:46:19] because i can see what it looked like
[1:46:21] when it happened in his life and so so
[1:46:23] i'm not here today to i'm not in fact
[1:46:25] his let me just say this
[1:46:27] i'm not even here to major on that the
[1:46:29] blind lead the blind it's not my fault
[1:46:31] i'll preach as hard as i can people have
[1:46:33] to accept it or reject it that's between
[1:46:35] them and god it's not up to me
[1:46:37] all i know is as for me and my house
[1:46:39] we're gonna serve the lord
[1:46:42] so i'm not even here to to to to major
[1:46:45] on that i already know that that has to
[1:46:47] repeat in this day so i'm not here today
[1:46:50] to stress over that i'm not here to lash
[1:46:52] out at people for making the same choice
[1:46:54] and refusing the opportunity that he
[1:46:56] gives in his word at the end time but
[1:46:58] but i but i see another thing
[1:47:01] i see another thing that that doesn't
[1:47:03] stress me it actually thrills me because
[1:47:06] in his day many were sick and afflicted
[1:47:09] and
[1:47:10] and and often often times it didn't even
[1:47:13] take great feats of faith to get healed
[1:47:16] all they had to do was know that he
[1:47:18] could do it and walked up and asked him
[1:47:21] and because he was so full of compassion
[1:47:23] he just healed them
[1:47:25] if i know what it looked like then i
[1:47:27] could know what it looks like now and
[1:47:29] you might be sick and afflicted in your
[1:47:31] body you don't gotta jump through fire
[1:47:33] you don't gotta run to the ends of the
[1:47:34] earth you don't got to cross the ocean
[1:47:36] and bring him back or go up to heaven
[1:47:38] and bring him down he's among you now
[1:47:41] and he's full of compassion and to say
[1:47:44] lord heal me today
[1:47:46] i need healing today in my body
[1:47:51] i see him in thomas
[1:47:54] that's important
[1:47:56] when thomas doubted him
[1:48:01] that's important to me because i have
[1:48:02] too often found myself like thomas
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:10] i wanted to believe it was true some
[1:48:12] promise of god
[1:48:15] but so many
[1:48:17] isn't that true so many
[1:48:19] unexpected circumstances weary our minds
[1:48:23] because it it doesn't turn out like you
[1:48:24] thought and you read a promise and you
[1:48:26] pray a prayer and you have an
[1:48:28] expectation and then
[1:48:30] somehow
[1:48:30] it's almost like either god didn't hear
[1:48:32] me
[1:48:33] or he chose to ignore me
[1:48:35] or
[1:48:36] i asked for a fish and he gave me a
[1:48:38] serpent which jesus said he would never
[1:48:40] do that
[1:48:42] i asked for bread and he gave me a stone
[1:48:44] that's only because you think that
[1:48:46] that's because the circumstance didn't
[1:48:47] meet your what you thought it should be
[1:48:50] but god would never do that god answers
[1:48:52] your prayer god always answers prayer
[1:48:55] sometimes his answer is no and people
[1:48:56] don't want to hear that sometimes his
[1:48:58] answer is um
[1:49:00] yeah i'll do it but not not right now
[1:49:05] sometimes his answer is yes i'll do it
[1:49:07] but not like you think
[1:49:11] and sometimes if we're honest friends we
[1:49:13] can stand i'm not here to condemn
[1:49:14] brother thomas
[1:49:16] i'm here to say i get thomas
[1:49:18] especially in laodicea when we can find
[1:49:20] ourselves so weary in our mind because
[1:49:23] of a cascade of disappointment after
[1:49:26] disappointment after disappointment
[1:49:28] after disappointment and and and we find
[1:49:31] that it takes a toll on our mind things
[1:49:33] don't always turn out like we like we're
[1:49:36] sure they would or we were convinced
[1:49:38] they we we were convinced we were
[1:49:40] concerned and we had even taken a stand
[1:49:42] and then everything still went wrong and
[1:49:45] that was exactly what happened to thomas
[1:49:48] even the road to emmaus these brothers
[1:49:50] are weary and jesus said why are you
[1:49:51] downcast said well we thought did you
[1:49:54] not hear about what things have happened
[1:49:55] about the messiah and jesus of nazareth
[1:49:57] and we thought it had been he that
[1:49:59] should be deliver israel
[1:50:04] and when that happens friends
[1:50:07] satan rushes in to give you false
[1:50:09] answers to trouble your mind i want to
[1:50:12] tell you you need to resist that
[1:50:15] because when that creates a vacuum when
[1:50:17] things don't go the way you think they
[1:50:19] should have and you were convinced
[1:50:21] you are sure you knew the will of god in
[1:50:23] it and you went forward and it just
[1:50:24] doesn't pan out that creates a vacuum of
[1:50:27] doubt and fear and and and
[1:50:29] disillusionment and i'm here to tell you
[1:50:31] satan just looks for those opportunities
[1:50:33] to come in and say see he doesn't love
[1:50:35] you you must not be a child of god
[1:50:37] there's some problem with this and some
[1:50:39] problem with that oh i'm here to tell
[1:50:41] you oh i love the fact that jesus cared
[1:50:44] about thomas
[1:50:45] jesus cared for thomas jesus cared so
[1:50:48] much that even though he he didn't have
[1:50:50] to do it but he actually on purpose says
[1:50:53] shows up and says thomas come here
[1:50:56] feel
[1:50:57] go ahead i know you're weary in your
[1:50:59] mind you want to believe me i know you
[1:51:01] love me but circumstances have weared
[1:51:03] your son go ahead touch me go ahead put
[1:51:06] your hand right here i'm good with it i
[1:51:08] want you to be a believer and i'll do
[1:51:10] whatever i got to do so you can believe
[1:51:13] me
[1:51:15] this is the this is the compassionate
[1:51:18] christ
[1:51:19] who is here today this is the one who
[1:51:21] gives you opportunity after opportunity
[1:51:24] i see simon
[1:51:26] oh my last example
[1:51:29] i see simon
[1:51:32] and i see me i see simon
[1:51:35] and i see you
[1:51:38] so what is it you see in simon brother
[1:51:40] jason i see a man who loved jesus
[1:51:43] with all his heart
[1:51:46] all his mind all his body
[1:51:49] all his soul
[1:51:51] he
[1:51:52] loved
[1:51:53] jesus
[1:51:55] do you believe it
[1:51:57] and yet he failed in his flesh
[1:52:01] one of the most horrible failures
[1:52:04] one could imagine
[1:52:07] denied that he not only denied the lord
[1:52:11] not only delight denied his innocence
[1:52:13] denied even knew him
[1:52:15] and even got mad and cussed
[1:52:17] to try to convince people of his lie
[1:52:21] so he added drama even to it
[1:52:23] but jesus loved him
[1:52:26] and that's why i read that's why i
[1:52:28] started with mark mark 14 or mark 16
[1:52:32] that when those women came
[1:52:35] and
[1:52:35] brother caleb said
[1:52:37] he's not here
[1:52:40] that smile
[1:52:42] he's risen
[1:52:44] go and tell his disciples oh hey
[1:52:47] and tell peter
[1:52:49] make sure you tell peter
[1:52:51] and when you and then you read the other
[1:52:53] gospels you're going to find that when
[1:52:55] jesus comes and appears and there's
[1:52:58] peter and nothing's brought up jesus
[1:53:00] isn't going to humiliate him or
[1:53:01] embarrass him but jesus is watching and
[1:53:04] peter imagine how peter felt there in
[1:53:06] the in the room when jesus walked in
[1:53:09] oh
[1:53:10] it's him
[1:53:12] and then he says to thomas and gives him
[1:53:14] that wonderful gift and peter's just
[1:53:15] standing there dying the death
[1:53:18] dying the death of embarrassment and
[1:53:20] guilt and humiliation of what he did and
[1:53:24] jesus isn't even going to mention the
[1:53:26] elephant in the room
[1:53:29] and then another time he appears at the
[1:53:31] sea of tiberias and they're out there
[1:53:32] fishing peter says i don't know what to
[1:53:34] do anymore
[1:53:35] i'm just going to go fishing you know
[1:53:37] why
[1:53:38] because it just seemed like
[1:53:40] what are we even doing we thought he
[1:53:42] would be the king that's not gonna
[1:53:44] happen they're still asking him that on
