[43:36] saint john chapter one
[43:41] saint john chapter 1.
[43:54] i hope you're not reading out of an niv
[43:57] because the scripture won't be in there
[44:07] saint john chapter one verse one let's
[44:11] read
[44:12] in the beginning was the word and the
[44:14] word was with god
[44:16] and the word was god the same was in the
[44:20] beginning with god
[44:22] all things were made by him and without
[44:25] him was not anything made that was made
[44:30] in him was life and the life was the
[44:33] light of men
[44:35] and the light shineth in darkness
[44:38] in the darkness comprehended it
[44:41] not what a powerful verse
[44:45] the light shineth in darkness
[44:48] in the darkness can't even understand it
[44:53] how many walking in the light the world
[44:56] can't even understand you hallelujah
[45:00] amen let's go to um first john
[45:04] chapter one
[45:10] first john chapter one and we're gonna
[45:11] start at verse
[45:13] six
[45:16] if we say that we have fellowship with
[45:18] him and walk in darkness we lie
[45:21] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[45:24] light
[45:24] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[45:28] one with another and the blood of jesus
[45:30] christ
[45:32] his son cleanses us from
[45:35] all sin amen may the lord bless reading
[45:38] of his word you can
[45:39] have your seats hallelujah
[45:43] you know by the grace of god i want to
[45:44] use for our topic tonight
[45:46] walk in the light of the word amen
[45:50] walk in the light of the word
[45:54] you know uh we as believers we believe
[45:58] that
[45:59] god is light amen now we're not talking
[46:02] about
[46:03] uh just a physical light like that
[46:07] but we're talking about a light of truth
[46:10] amen
[46:11] when we speak of god being light we
[46:14] speak of truth amen
[46:16] because what light does light gets rid
[46:19] of
[46:19] all the mystery hallelujah you know if
[46:22] we were to cut all the lights off in
[46:24] here tonight
[46:25] we wouldn't be able to see everything
[46:27] plainly
[46:28] but once we cut the lights on there's no
[46:31] more mystery hallelujah
[46:33] and you know i was telling brother jason
[46:35] it was something he said in the bible
[46:36] study
[46:37] it just kind of stuck with me you know
[46:39] and he was talking about the mystery of
[46:41] god and he says if you are looking at
[46:43] this word of your
[46:44] your you're looking at this message and
[46:47] if it's still a
[46:48] mystery to you you're in darkness
[46:51] hallelujah because it hasn't been
[46:53] revealed but
[46:54] once it's revealed hallelujah you can
[46:57] see it hallelujah
[46:58] that's what the light does the light
[47:01] comes to
[47:02] show you hallelujah what's before you
[47:04] amen
[47:05] so you know in the beginning you know uh
[47:08] if we go to genesis chapter one
[47:10] by the grace of god turn with me to
[47:12] genesis chapter one
[47:13] now the bible says in the beginning god
[47:16] created the heavens and the earth
[47:18] and the earth was without form and
[47:21] without void and darkness
[47:23] was upon the face of the deep and the
[47:26] spirit of god
[47:27] moved upon the face of the waters now
[47:30] god created
[47:31] but what he created darkness had
[47:33] dominion hallelujah
[47:35] but god being god he couldn't let it
[47:37] stay like that
[47:38] hallelujah so you know when you were
[47:40] born darkness had dominion
[47:43] hallelujah darkness had dominion over
[47:46] you
[47:47] but you know what he wasn't willing to
[47:50] let
[47:50] darkness have dominion over you so you
[47:53] know what the bible says
[47:54] and the spirit of the lord began to move
[47:57] hardly
[47:58] how did it move listen he said then god
[48:00] said
[48:01] let there be light and there was light
[48:04] what did he do
[48:05] when god said let there be light and it
[48:08] was light
[48:08] what did he do he gave the earth truth
[48:12] hallelujah that's what he did when he
[48:15] spoke light on the earth the truth of
[48:18] god
[48:18] began to move what was he he was eternal
[48:22] the truth he was elohim the truth
[48:26] he was the lugos the truth and most of
[48:28] all
[48:29] he was god so when he spoke
[48:33] everything about god began to move on
[48:36] the earth
[48:36] and what was he doing he was clearing up
[48:39] every false conception
[48:40] that was laying there
[48:50] thank you darkness
[48:54] looked like it had dominion until god
[48:56] said let there be light
[48:58] and once he spoke light truth hallelujah
[49:02] began to come forward amen because when
[49:04] that light began to shine hallelujah
[49:07] everything that was laying there in
[49:09] darkness began to grow
[49:11] all right wow hallelujah when god said
[49:14] let there be light what did he do he
[49:17] spoke the truth
[49:18] and as the light began to shine every
[49:21] seed laying dormant in the earth
[49:23] began to grow and as you sit here
[49:26] and listen to the truth everything
[49:29] inside of you
[49:30] that's connected to the light it must
[49:32] grow
[49:38] that's what light does
[49:42] light takes away everything that's false
[49:46] light if oh my that's what i love
[49:49] light will reveal everything that's
[49:53] hidden
[49:56] wow that's why god came
[49:59] and he gave us a message with a
[50:00] messenger hallelujah
[50:02] and when that messenger began to speak
[50:05] hallelujah he was speaking under the
[50:06] inspiration
[50:07] of what truth hallelujah and as he spoke
[50:11] the truth
[50:12] the mystery of your earth began to come
[50:15] forth hallelujah
[50:16] the mystery of who you are it began to
[50:18] rise hallelujah
[50:19] why because god said let there be light
[50:25] and as the light shines everything
[50:28] that's connected to it
[50:30] hollywood it begins to be set free
[50:34] are you free tonight you know but listen
[50:38] church
[50:39] the bible says hell yeah and the light
[50:42] shineth in darkness and darkness
[50:45] comprehended it is not
[50:47] hell yeah the world cannot understand
[50:50] your connection to god
[50:53] your unsaved loved ones cannot
[50:56] understand your connection to god
[50:59] because it says the light shineth
[51:01] hallelujah the truth shineth
[51:05] the way you dress the truth silent
[51:08] the way you talk the truth silent the
[51:11] way you worship
[51:14] they'll never be able to understand it
[51:20] the only way you can understand truth
[51:24] is to first accept it
[51:30] listen do you understand that the
[51:31] prophet god said before you can even
[51:34] commit seeing you got to deny truth
[51:38] think about it none of you none of us
[51:42] were created to lie
[51:46] none of us so what we have to do
[51:49] hallelujah
[51:50] we have to bypass hallelujah we have to
[51:53] bypass the original
[51:55] part of us that we were created for
[51:57] hallelujah
[51:58] and tap into darkness
[52:04] because there's no darkness in god so
[52:06] where does the light come from
[52:08] you have to bypass god to get to it
[52:12] that's why the prophet of god will say
[52:14] it's not god's will
[52:16] that any would perish it's not god's
[52:19] will that
[52:19] it should go to hell but we send
[52:21] ourselves
[52:23] how by rejecting the light
[52:28] because of you walking in the light you
[52:30] can see where you're going
[52:32] now i got about two hours to go from
[52:35] here about about
[52:36] 2 15. now it'll be real hard for me to
[52:39] get back home with no headlights
[52:44] i want you to check this out listen to
[52:45] me good now
[52:47] i know the way
[52:52] i know i can jump on 21 hallelujah
[52:56] right 21-95 95-26
[53:00] get off 26 and then i'm cruising to my
[53:02] house holly
[53:04] but that'll be a very hard journey with
[53:07] no light
[53:12] wow and there's a lot of people that say
[53:16] they're on their way to heaven there's a
[53:18] lot of people that say
[53:20] hallelujah they know god but if you're
[53:22] not walking in this present day
[53:24] light it's going to be very hard for you
[53:26] to get there
[53:32] listen it may take i think about 200
[53:36] it's about
[53:36] 240 miles i even know the mile count
[53:41] i even know how much gas is going to
[53:42] take i got all that down pack
[53:45] but without the proper light that's
[53:48] going to be a very hard trip
[53:50] holly and i got my daughter with me i
[53:53] know she got my 20 20 vision
[53:55] that won't help us
[54:00] you know how people are doing they're
[54:01] sitting there and reading the bible
[54:03] and they say well god give me
[54:04] understanding is it the only same
[54:07] understanding
[54:07] he gave to a prophet
[54:11] because god gave that prophet light
[54:14] divine light
[54:15] what was it divine truth whoa
[54:19] and if you can't see what he sees
[54:22] hallelujah
[54:23] it's going to be very hard for you to
[54:24] get there
[54:30] now let's understand something if you
[54:33] and i jump out there and start driving
[54:37] we'll be riding by the same light
[54:39] different cars
[54:41] same light are you with me
[54:45] harley so you can say well you got a
[54:49] you got a truck i got a car but when we
[54:52] cut our lights on
[54:53] it's that same light that's directing us
[54:55] hallelujah
[54:56] just a different vehicle hallelujah so
[54:59] church holly do you realize
[55:01] even though the prophet is gone
[55:02] hallelujah we're walking by the same
[55:04] light
[55:06] hell yeah we got the same truth
[55:09] so we should have the same miracles the
[55:11] same anointing
[55:12] the same angel of the lord the same god
[55:15] who
[55:16] in our services i challenge you tonight
[55:20] whatever your prayer request is look for
[55:23] it to be answered while the world is
[55:25] being preached
[55:31] if you're walking in the light he says
[55:33] you will have fellowship
[55:38] he said let there be light and it was
[55:41] whoa let there be truth and it was
[55:45] oh my glory to god you know what before
[55:48] i
[55:49] before i go on a little bit further
[55:51] listen
[55:52] how important the light is this is what
[55:55] the prophet of god says
[55:57] oh my it's very important
[56:02] to make sure as christians that our
[56:05] journey is clean
[56:09] that we don't have past unconfessed sins
[56:11] or
[56:12] unconfessed habits that we are not
[56:15] confessing to god
[56:17] notice i said habits harley a habit is
[56:20] something that you keep going back to
[56:22] but i said unconfess habit holy
[56:26] you can have something in your life that
[56:28] you're struggling with but as long as
[56:30] you're on your knees saying god
[56:32] take this from me you in a good place
[56:35] hallelujah
[56:35] but if you do it repetitiously
[56:37] hallelujah with no
[56:39] thought with no desire to change you in
[56:42] trouble
[56:45] hallelujah i always tell people they
[56:47] come to prayer and they
[56:48] and they say well brother i feel this
[56:50] way and i feel like i'm really
[56:52] letting god down i say that's good
[56:56] you ever felt that way you come to
[56:59] service and you don't give your all you
[57:01] don't sing or
[57:02] you don't worship the word come forth
[57:04] you feel like you miss
[57:05] god and then you walk out of here
[57:06] feeling beat up
[57:10] and you go home and you be like oh god
[57:12] what did i do lord
[57:14] i'm missing your presence and you're
[57:15] like brother diggs pray for me
[57:17] why do i feel that way that's a good
[57:19] thing
[57:21] because as long as you can feel that way
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:25] you are receptive to light hallelujah
[57:30] but if you ever lose that feeling
[57:32] hallelujah if you ever think you got
[57:34] everything all right
[57:35] if you ever can see it and it don't
[57:37] bother you you
[57:38] are in trouble
[57:44] so if you fall and you say lord help me
[57:47] get up praise god
[57:50] but if you fall and you say oh well i
[57:52] did it now who cares what they think
[57:55] you are in trouble
[57:58] the scripture says holy bless is the man
[58:01] who sins of
[58:02] whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins
[58:05] are forgiven hallelujah
[58:07] to give forgiveness you have to have
[58:09] done something wrong
[58:13] look at god now we know that god
[58:16] uh is a forgiver
[58:21] oh let me let me make up my own word
[58:24] he's a forgiver
[58:29] hallelujah do you know him as a forgiver
[58:33] well you know you've done something
[58:35] wrong but the forgiveness
[58:38] still gives you forgiveness
[58:41] you know you might be missing a mark but
[58:43] the forgiver
[58:44] still gives you the proper right
[58:47] hallelujah
[58:48] to come to his throne hallelujah he
[58:50] still makes you feel good sometimes
[58:52] even though you've done wrong see god is
[58:55] a god
[58:56] who's mindful of every mistake
[58:59] that you will do that you've done hell
[59:02] yeah and
[59:08] but he's a forgiver why is he forgive
[59:11] her because that's who he that's one of
[59:13] his attributes
[59:15] so he allows us to make mistakes
[59:19] just so he can give us a portion of him
[59:22] what is that portion
[59:23] forgiveness
[59:26] anybody ever made a mistake hallelujah
[59:29] praise
[59:29] god hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[59:32] you made that mistake so god could show
[59:35] you
[59:36] that he's a forgiver
[59:42] hallelujah the devil doesn't get any
[59:45] credit
[59:46] everything about us is for the good of
[59:48] god
[59:50] even our mistakes is for the good of god
[59:53] why so he can show us the truth
[59:57] when god shows you your mistakes what is
[59:59] he doing he's showing you the true way
[1:00:01] to do it
[1:00:08] let me back up a little bit let me back
[1:00:10] up a little bit listen

[1:00:15] know some people jason they love a big
[1:00:16] church so they can hide they can come in
[1:00:20] and get lost
[1:00:21] pastors don't know their name don't know
[1:00:24] if they missing service or
[1:00:25] people love church like that not me
[1:00:29] not me amen i want to be connected
[1:00:36] you know i was just preaching at our
[1:00:38] church a couple weeks ago
[1:00:40] and the prophet god said how many knows
[1:00:43] the order of battle
[1:00:47] he said how many knows the order of
[1:00:49] battle he says
[1:00:50] first things first when it comes to
[1:00:52] battle is worship
[1:00:56] but we wouldn't know matthew to get it
[1:00:57] going no
[1:00:59] you're supposed to be a part of the
[1:01:00] battle so you're supposed to worship
[1:01:04] and call me crazy if you can't worship i
[1:01:06] don't want you on my team
[1:01:10] because god might look at you and say
[1:01:12] i'm going to the next team
[1:01:16] if you connected with that oh yeah i
[1:01:19] ain't got time for that
[1:01:20] let me move on hallelujah he says the
[1:01:24] order of the battle is to worship and
[1:01:25] when you go into the scriptures
[1:01:27] you can see that before they even fought
[1:01:29] holy they anointed
[1:01:31] their appointed worshipers hallelujah
[1:01:33] those that could play skillfully amen
[1:01:36] they didn't go out they hit and missing
[1:01:38] what did they do they practiced at home
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:47] don't get mad at me they got it in their
[1:01:50] spirit they didn't wait till they come
[1:01:52] to church and stand up here with a phone
[1:01:54] in their hand
[1:01:58] where are the true consecrated
[1:02:01] worshipers
[1:02:02] that when they sing is coming out of
[1:02:04] their soul
[1:02:08] oh i missed those days when we weren't
[1:02:10] relying on monitors and
[1:02:12] and and billboards
[1:02:17] but people sat home and they meditated
[1:02:20] over the worship
[1:02:21] hallelujah and they wasn't getting up
[1:02:24] the scene to the people
[1:02:25] but they they knew they would not get
[1:02:27] any rest until they sent us to god
[1:02:32] where is that church
[1:02:38] he said we will appoint worshipers and
[1:02:40] then you go read chronicles 25
[1:02:42] the bible says hallelujah that the
[1:02:45] worship was so
[1:02:46] that it prophesied the battle
[1:02:51] that's what's supposed to be going on i
[1:02:53] don't know why i'm here i hope
[1:02:54] i hope it helps somebody listen when we
[1:02:57] worship harley
[1:02:58] you ever heard brother jason come out of
[1:02:59] brother matt or other brother
[1:03:01] jason demars come out and they said we
[1:03:03] thank god for that song it goes along
[1:03:05] with my message
[1:03:07] prophesied the battle hallelujah
[1:03:11] that's what your worship is supposed to
[1:03:12] do your worship is supposed to tap into
[1:03:16] the word that's about to come why
[1:03:19] because the worship
[1:03:20] exalts god the worship tells you that
[1:03:22] you're
[1:03:23] in the light the worship will tell you
[1:03:26] what kind of truth is about to come
[1:03:33] and we didn't heard it many times we
[1:03:35] thank god for that song
[1:03:36] that song goes right along with my
[1:03:38] message what happened the worshipers
[1:03:40] prophesied the battle
[1:03:42] that showed that the devil is defeated
[1:03:45] holy
[1:03:46] and when you go back and study it a
[1:03:47] little bit deeper hallelujah
[1:03:49] catch this one church this one was real
[1:03:51] sweet to me that when they worship
[1:03:53] those that were appointed with the
[1:03:55] trumpets and the symbols and and all the
[1:03:57] different
[1:03:57] pastries and things that they had to
[1:03:59] worship hallelujah when they came out
[1:04:01] they gave it their best so when they got
[1:04:03] to playing they played they made a noise
[1:04:06] it was so in tune it was so hard it was
[1:04:09] so miraculous
[1:04:10] that the bible said the worship was
[1:04:13] there to set an
[1:04:14] ambush for the enemy
[1:04:21] come back and read your bible your
[1:04:23] worship is here for an
[1:04:24] ambush to protect the world
[1:04:31] satan look at you worshiping and you
[1:04:33] just got your hands lifted you just
[1:04:35] praising him so he's thinking i got to
[1:04:37] stop that he don't know that the words
[1:04:39] coming behind that
[1:04:40] hallelujah and the word is going to
[1:04:42] rightly divide the word is going to be
[1:04:44] so much light is just going to bring
[1:04:45] everything forward
[1:04:49] but you know listen listen i want to
[1:04:52] read this quote to you
[1:04:55] he says this is for your secrets
[1:05:00] we're in a time we're in a day where the
[1:05:02] hour is late
[1:05:05] and if you don't know god you need to
[1:05:08] make it your business
[1:05:10] to know him forget about who leaving
[1:05:14] who ain't coming make it personal
[1:05:17] remember here
[1:05:18] we're walking under a gentile hollywood
[1:05:21] a gentile step hallelujah
[1:05:23] we're not going in there as a group
[1:05:24] hallelujah but we're going in as
[1:05:26] individuals hallelujah so church don't
[1:05:29] worry about
[1:05:30] who's beside you and who's not here and
[1:05:32] who's home and
[1:05:33] who's who's wearing a mask and who's not
[1:05:35] wearing a mask
[1:05:36] make sure that you have truth
[1:05:43] make sure you know him
[1:05:48] you know you hear these people by god's
[1:05:50] grace you hear these people talking
[1:05:52] about the message of the hour
[1:05:54] and you know they say well uh uh they
[1:05:56] left because of fanaticism and
[1:05:58] people worship brother brown and i say
[1:06:00] man please
[1:06:03] i'm like that's your argument man please
[1:06:07] the real bride of christ never worshiped
[1:06:10] brother branham
[1:06:12] she always knew the purpose of that
[1:06:15] prophet hallelujah
[1:06:16] the purpose of that prophet was to bring
[1:06:19] the light of god
[1:06:20] here so that it could connect with the
[1:06:23] seed of god
[1:06:24] so that we as a bride could come forward
[1:06:27] [Applause]
[1:06:30] that was the purpose of william branham
[1:06:34] god gave him a message why for you
[1:06:37] behold i seen you
[1:06:38] elijah the prophet so it was never about
[1:06:41] brother branham
[1:06:42] it was always about you
[1:06:48] and for those who get stuck with
[1:06:51] hallelujah
[1:06:52] the seventh angel they're missing it
[1:06:55] because everything the seventh angel had
[1:06:58] he got from the mighty angel
[1:07:03] hallelujah every revelation
[1:07:06] every gift every anointing hallelujah
[1:07:10] every service it came from god
[1:07:17] remember if you're walking in light
[1:07:21] you hear his voice hallelujah
[1:07:24] because you're walking in truth
[1:07:27] hallelujah
[1:07:28] the truth of the matter is nobody else's
[1:07:31] blood could redeem us but christ
[1:07:35] so why would you follow another you'd be
[1:07:38] walking in darkness remember
[1:07:40] the light shineth in darkness and
[1:07:42] darkness comprehended it not
[1:07:44] it was never about following the man
[1:07:47] hallelujah
[1:07:48] it was about following the truth
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:53] hallelujah it was about following the
[1:07:56] truth
[1:07:56] he said brothers how can you say that
[1:07:58] because when this message was preached
[1:08:01] it wasn't preached hallelujah on a
[1:08:04] message platform
[1:08:05] it was preached in denominations
[1:08:09] it was preached in an area where
[1:08:11] everything was false
[1:08:14] baptist doctrine partial
[1:08:19] methodist doctrine partial pentecostal
[1:08:22] doctrine
[1:08:23] partial so god had to come and give him
[1:08:26] a
[1:08:27] light that we could walk in
[1:08:31] wow because this is the only light that
[1:08:34] will get us back to god
[1:08:40] listen he says and before i condemn
[1:08:44] a satanic spirit and so forth
[1:08:47] i want to know first whether that's
[1:08:51] in god's legal plan my
[1:08:54] now we think that the prophet just come
[1:08:56] people getting the prayer line he
[1:08:57] rebuked the devil and people set free
[1:08:59] nope didn't happen like that
[1:09:02] that person had to be worthy
[1:09:06] of god's grace
[1:09:10] and if they had something in their lives
[1:09:13] the prophet couldn't pray for
[1:09:17] something they were holding on to or
[1:09:18] some secret
[1:09:21] he said and it's god he said and brother
[1:09:24] barbara says
[1:09:25] jesus died holy for everyone that's
[1:09:27] right
[1:09:28] then if you're living in above that
[1:09:31] reproach
[1:09:32] and doing right then satan has to turn
[1:09:36] loose of you oh yeah if you're
[1:09:39] living above the reproach of sin
[1:09:42] satan has to turn everything that
[1:09:45] belongs to you loose
[1:09:52] i thought by now we'll be shouting
[1:09:57] anybody got the holy ghost anybody
[1:10:00] walking in the light
[1:10:02] the light of truth anybody walking in
[1:10:05] truth
[1:10:06] so according to the prophet he said if
[1:10:08] you're living above the reproach of sin
[1:10:11] satan has to turn you loose
[1:10:17] i'ma ask you again does anybody got the
[1:10:19] holy ghost
[1:10:20] is anybody living in truth satan
[1:10:24] has to turn you loose
[1:10:33] he loses his grip why because there's
[1:10:36] nothing
[1:10:36] in your life for him to hold on to
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:43] there's nothing he can connect with
[1:10:50] but if you got a little darkness there
[1:10:53] he'll fellowship with that darkness
[1:10:56] but if your body be your spirit be full
[1:10:58] of light
[1:10:59] he can't do nothing
[1:11:02] the darkness comprehended it not
[1:11:06] and you know what he does he tries to go
[1:11:08] to god
[1:11:10] dealing in your past
[1:11:13] and you go to god and say well they did
[1:11:15] this and they did that and god will say
[1:11:17] i don't see it
[1:11:21] oh oh my how privileged we are
[1:11:25] to be walking in light because with that
[1:11:28] testimony
[1:11:29] god is saying to the devil they never
[1:11:32] did it
[1:11:36] that's real justification you never did
[1:11:39] it
[1:11:40] and right now you could be thinking well
[1:11:41] i did this and i did that according to
[1:11:43] god
[1:11:44] you never did it so why condemn yourself
[1:11:48] if god is not condemning you
[1:11:52] glory else
[1:11:55] we spent too much time condemning
[1:11:58] ourselves over the past
[1:12:00] and god will show you your past just to
[1:12:02] set you free
[1:12:13] what a wonderful savior
[1:12:16] what a great forgiver we got
[1:12:22] because we'll sit home sometimes we
[1:12:23] condemn ourselves well i did this and i
[1:12:25] did that
[1:12:26] and god is looking at you saying what
[1:12:27] are you talking about
[1:12:29] i've already made a way for this
[1:12:35] don't hold on to your secrets confess
[1:12:38] them give them to god that's what he's
[1:12:40] there for
[1:12:40] he wants to be a forgiver
[1:12:44] amen and i know y'all can go home y'all
[1:12:47] gonna be laughing at that word but then
[1:12:48] you're gonna
[1:12:49] you're gonna think about it you're gonna
[1:12:50] say i gotta forgive her i gotta forgive
[1:12:53] the right
[1:12:54] god is forgive her
[1:12:58] i know i know one thing i know about me
[1:13:02] you know i'm just i whether i'm
[1:13:05] preaching whether i'm singing or
[1:13:07] worshiping
[1:13:08] i give it all i got it and sometimes
[1:13:12] people can't comprehend that
[1:13:15] they think it's a workup or they think
[1:13:17] you know it's a performance it's a show
[1:13:19] no that's just how i'm built i ain't
[1:13:21] built to give god fifty percent
[1:13:24] i ain't built to give him eighty percent
[1:13:27] i'm built to give him a hundred and ten
[1:13:30] but it looks like i should quit there's
[1:13:32] something that gives me another gear
[1:13:34] hallelujah see i ain't just an ordinary
[1:13:37] car
[1:13:37] i'm a maybach

[1:15:21] years ago so he's in his 80s

[1:15:42] be before you alone you know i'm about
[1:15:44] to close
[1:15:46] but listen church that we want to make
[1:15:49] sure we're in god's plan
[1:15:51] how do we stay in god's plan by walking
[1:15:53] in light
[1:15:55] walking in truth and as long as you are
[1:15:57] in truth
[1:15:58] the light of god the devil has no holds
[1:16:00] on you
[1:16:02] hallelujah that's why he's trying to
[1:16:04] stop this message so much
[1:16:06] hallelujah because he knows if he
[1:16:08] forgives he can get us
[1:16:10] to reject us we're rejecting truth think
[1:16:13] about the church
[1:16:14] us as believers when we reject hollywood
[1:16:17] or for those i ain't gonna say we
[1:16:18] for those who have rejected holy this
[1:16:21] message of the hour
[1:16:23] they've rejected the portions of god
[1:16:25] that's been revealed
[1:16:33] oh my and you know some people say well
[1:16:35] i'm just
[1:16:36] i'm just not going to fellowship but
[1:16:38] i'ma still believe the doctrine
[1:16:41] foolishness
[1:16:45] we don't want you have we want all of
[1:16:47] you
[1:16:50] hallelujah listen he says then if you're
[1:16:53] living above the reproach
[1:16:54] and and doing right then satan has to
[1:16:57] turn you loose
[1:16:59] but if there's anything back behind
[1:17:02] there maybe something that you ought to
[1:17:05] have done
[1:17:06] maybe you're living clean and pure
[1:17:09] but god told you hallelujah something to
[1:17:12] do
[1:17:13] and you neglected to do it oh
[1:17:16] my that'll give satan a right to put a
[1:17:19] hand on you
[1:17:26] he says in god's he's saying god holds
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:29] right on you until you get back and make
[1:17:33] that thing
[1:17:34] right again whether it's something you
[1:17:36] should have done
[1:17:37] of should not have done
[1:17:40] do you see what i mean
[1:17:43] just as simple as being obedient to god
[1:17:49] can cause her the devil to keep his
[1:17:51] grips in your life
[1:17:53] you say oh my y'all know that the
[1:17:54] prophet was always scriptural
[1:17:57] the best example i can think of it is
[1:17:59] coming to me right now
[1:18:00] dealing with this was saul you know
[1:18:03] garco saul go down and kill
[1:18:05] uh a gag kill all the ammo crack kill
[1:18:08] kill baby suckling sheep goat
[1:18:10] cow ass have killed everything dog cat
[1:18:13] kangaroo kill it all
[1:18:20] am i right where did that word come from
[1:18:24] that word came from god through a
[1:18:27] prophet
[1:18:27] to samuel i mean to saul holly
[1:18:31] so what was god trying to get him to do
[1:18:33] to see if he is going to walk
[1:18:35] in truth
[1:18:39] whoa just believe god walk in truth
[1:18:43] holy it'll tell whether you bride or not
[1:18:46] when the word comes
[1:18:47] do you obey it dare to tell who you are
[1:18:52] forget about your church building when
[1:18:54] you hear the word of god
[1:18:56] what do you do with it are you a hearer
[1:18:58] or are you a doer
[1:19:03] because saul he prophesied with the best
[1:19:08] he walked with the he walked with the
[1:19:10] people of god
[1:19:12] but he simply couldn't obey the truth
[1:19:17] so therefore he could no longer walk in
[1:19:19] light
[1:19:21] and god comes he tells him he says hey
[1:19:24] through the prophet hallelujah see
[1:19:28] he would have never known what the light
[1:19:30] of god was without samuel
[1:19:32] am i right saul would have never known
[1:19:35] what god wanted without samuel
[1:19:36] hallelujah
[1:19:38] so god used samuel hallelujah as a go-to
[1:19:41] to get the saul to get to the people
[1:19:43] hallelujah and then he'd come he said
[1:19:45] well god said
[1:19:46] go kill go kill a gag and amalekite kill
[1:19:49] every kill every mama baby everything
[1:19:52] why did god it seemed like god was
[1:19:54] vicious
[1:19:56] hallelujah but he knew earlier that
[1:19:59] little cute little amalekite baby
[1:20:01] was gonna grow up to be a gag
[1:20:05] that's why when god tell us to kill
[1:20:07] certain things in our lives
[1:20:08] don't blame it on your friends don't
[1:20:11] blame it on your parents hallelujah
[1:20:13] what you got to do is kill it
[1:20:19] if you kill it god will give you grace
[1:20:21] to go through
[1:20:22] it but you know what we got things we
[1:20:25] love
[1:20:26] that we don't want to see die
[1:20:30] we don't want to separate from oh my so
[1:20:32] he tells me he said go
[1:20:33] he said go kill everything let's kill it
[1:20:35] all you know what saul did
[1:20:36] so i'll say i heard you god i heard you
[1:20:38] he said i'm gonna go down here i'm gonna
[1:20:40] wipe out everything
[1:20:41] i don't like that wasn't the commandment
[1:20:46] it wasn't what he liked it was what god
[1:20:49] didn't like
[1:20:50] and god didn't like nothing that was
[1:20:52] identified with the amalekites
[1:20:54] even a little cute little crying babies
[1:21:00] those pretty those pretty fluffy sheep
[1:21:03] with that
[1:21:04] pretty wool gossip kill it
[1:21:07] holy that nice juicy angus beef that was
[1:21:10] down the glass and kill it
[1:21:13] that good old pretty and pink pig that
[1:21:15] was down to godzilla
[1:21:17] get it
[1:21:21] but you know what saul went down there
[1:21:24] he said man
[1:21:25] ain't nobody ain't no need to get rid of
[1:21:26] all some of some of us we can offer up
[1:21:29] to god
[1:21:31] man you know these nice sheep and this
[1:21:33] and that and
[1:21:34] let's take some of this let's take some
[1:21:35] of that you know we'll take it back and
[1:21:37] we'll offer sacrifice
[1:21:39] hey guys come along of all things
[1:21:42] he should have killed a gag first
[1:21:47] because the sheep represented ajax the
[1:21:50] children representing aka
[1:21:51] everything about the amalekites
[1:21:54] represented
[1:21:58] i challenge you tonight kill your king
[1:22:03] kill that thing that has authority over
[1:22:06] your life
[1:22:07] kill it how do you kill it
[1:22:10] give it to god
[1:22:14] say lord i surrender
[1:22:18] i surrender
[1:22:22] hallelujah because you know god has it
[1:22:25] that way
[1:22:26] when things look so strong that we can't
[1:22:28] defeat it on our own
[1:22:31] it takes him to step in and do it why
[1:22:34] because when you come up against other
[1:22:35] challenges
[1:22:36] you won't try to fight it yourself you
[1:22:38] bring that to god
[1:22:40] and that way you always stay victorious
[1:22:46] so anyway he comes and you know he
[1:22:49] he brings everything back and god
[1:22:52] god comes and he tells samuel he say
[1:22:54] look saul has disobeyed me
[1:22:57] and i'm gonna strip him
[1:23:01] i'm gonna strip him from fellowship i'm
[1:23:04] gonna strip him from walking in the
[1:23:05] light
[1:23:06] oh my i'mma strip him from hearing my
[1:23:09] voice i'm
[1:23:10] stripping from everything just because
[1:23:13] he didn't do what god told him to do
[1:23:16] what about us
[1:23:16] church how many times were god telling
[1:23:20] us to do something that we don't obey
[1:23:23] i ain't talking about something that'll
[1:23:24] make you a celebrity in the church
[1:23:26] now ain't talking about that i ain't
[1:23:28] talking about something you want to be
[1:23:29] seen for everybody to see you doing and
[1:23:31] you can say oh look at me praise god
[1:23:36] no i ain't talking about that i'm
[1:23:37] talking about in your secret place
[1:23:42] that thing you wrestling with hallelujah
[1:23:45] the prophet of god said
[1:23:46] we all have hollywood personal
[1:23:49] temptations of satan
[1:23:52] he said but how do you defeat it you're
[1:23:54] defeated by the word
[1:23:56] he said that's how jesus defeated he
[1:23:58] said jesus had
[1:23:59] his own personal temptations by the
[1:24:02] devil when satan took him out of his 40
[1:24:04] they fast
[1:24:05] and he said turn this to bread he says
[1:24:07] get up on his mind and worship me and
[1:24:08] jesus said
[1:24:09] it's written it's written he said what
[1:24:11] was he fighting what was the temptation
[1:24:13] he said all three of those trials one
[1:24:15] represented
[1:24:16] the lust of the eye the other
[1:24:18] represented the lust of the flesh
[1:24:20] and the third represented the pride of
[1:24:22] life
[1:24:25] and jesus defeated all three how by the
[1:24:28] word
[1:24:30] wow walk in the light
[1:24:35] it'll be the truth that helps you to
[1:24:36] overcome

[1:26:24] which am a woman of samaria for the jews
[1:26:28] have no
[1:26:29] dealings with the samaritans jesus
[1:26:32] answered
[1:26:33] and said unto her if thou knewest the
[1:26:35] gift of god
[1:26:36] and who it is that santa did he give me
[1:26:40] to drink
[1:26:41] thou wouldest have asked of him
[1:26:44] and he would have given thee living wall
[1:26:47] listen
[1:26:48] in this first response jesus stopped
[1:26:52] talking about water
[1:26:56] he said if you knew the gift of god
[1:26:59] you'll be asking for something else
[1:27:03] the prophet of god saying right here
[1:27:05] he's trying to contact a spirit
[1:27:07] what is he doing he's pulling her into
[1:27:10] the light
[1:27:14] do y'all know that's the ability of the

[1:28:18] darkness comprehended it not
[1:28:21] see a lifestyle in this moment it can't
[1:28:25] even comprehend what jesus is talking
[1:28:27] about
[1:28:30] but because he's a great forgiver
[1:28:34] he's going to keep dealing with her
[1:28:38] god will keep dealing with you until the
[1:28:41] real
[1:28:42] you comes out

[1:29:16] cattle jesus says and saith unto her
[1:29:19] whosoever drinking of this water shall
[1:29:22] thirst again but whosoever drinketh the
[1:29:24] water that
[1:29:26] that i shall give him shall never thirst

[1:34:01] is bubbling it can't help but react to
[1:34:04] the temperature
[1:34:08] it might be heavier than the water
[1:34:11] but the gravitational pull inside the
[1:34:14] pot changes with the temperature and

[1:34:19] should sink and make it float
[1:34:26] oh my church we should be seeking with

[1:36:23] hindering her
[1:36:27] we've already established that she's
[1:36:30] bright
[1:36:31] because she's connected to the word now
[1:36:34] now he's feeling deal with her sin
[1:36:38] listen he says go get thy husband
[1:36:44] and come healer the woman answered and
[1:36:46] said i
[1:36:47] have no husband jesus saith unto her

[1:36:54] for thou has had five husbands and he
[1:36:57] whom thou now has is not thy husband
[1:37:01] in that
[1:37:05] the woman said to satisfaction sir i

[1:37:17] said
[1:37:17] i'll proceed now she's walking in the
[1:37:19] light now she said i perceive that thou
[1:37:21] as a prophet
[1:37:22] what's happening her seed is connecting
[1:37:24] with the light because the prophet has
[1:37:26] the true
[1:37:27] divine revelation coming from god
[1:37:30] so now she's listening to christ and
[1:37:32] she's saying you got to be speaking the
[1:37:34] truth
[1:37:38] oh my oh my give me that give me that uh
[1:37:43] quote out of um
[1:37:46] um third seal listen to this church
[1:37:53] you know iron sharpens iron
[1:37:56] talk to me it's good to have fellowship
[1:37:59] with one another around the word of god
[1:38:02] hallelujah and you know me and
[1:38:05] me and brother burleigh are on the phone
[1:38:07] fellowshipping honey
[1:38:10] and he dropped this on me right here we
[1:38:11] started talking about this and he
[1:38:13] dropped the scripture on me
[1:38:14] and you know me
[1:38:17] once you drop some truth on me you gonna
[1:38:20] hit it again
[1:38:21] especially if it's doing something to me
[1:38:24] holiday
[1:38:25] you know listen church he says
[1:38:28] he says what what was it
[1:38:32] the light struck the seed it had been
[1:38:34] laying there
[1:38:36] that was spoke by god yes sir the seed
[1:38:39] was on the earth
[1:38:40] when god moved the water away and the
[1:38:43] sun hit it hallelujah
[1:38:44] it come up that's right see that's
[1:38:48] all he needed was sun just needed
[1:38:51] light yes sir what's he saying all we
[1:38:54] need is jesus
[1:38:58] once we get in his presence hallelujah
[1:39:01] that seed will collect with
[1:39:03] light and the truth will come forward
[1:39:09] but this is the part i want to deal with
[1:39:11] he says and then
[1:39:13] the holy spirit in him moved away her
[1:39:17] her past life my now you talk about the
[1:39:19] woman at the well
[1:39:21] that whole conversation was about jesus
[1:39:24] moving her past out of the way
[1:39:28] you see he dealt with everything that
[1:39:30] she was he was speaking into her life
[1:39:32] and what was he doing he was moving her
[1:39:34] past
[1:39:35] so that the words he could speak could
[1:39:37] connect directly with the seed
[1:39:41] and you think about that church god
[1:39:44] wants us hallelujah
[1:39:45] to deal with our sins why because once
[1:39:48] we can deal with our past
[1:39:50] the word can connect hollywood straight
[1:39:52] with the seed
[1:39:56] oh my he said he moved the whale past
[1:40:00] life
[1:40:01] and showed it to him did god do that to
[1:40:05] you
[1:40:06] hallelujah if he did not ask you why did
[1:40:09] you repent
[1:40:13] first step is to repent then be baptized
[1:40:16] why do we repent because of our past
[1:40:18] life
[1:40:21] hallelujah so what does god do he show
[1:40:23] you your past life
[1:40:25] move all that out the way so that the
[1:40:26] word coming after that can deal
[1:40:28] directly with your seed
[1:40:32] hallelujah once he gets your pass out of
[1:40:35] the way
[1:40:36] you can only go up from there
[1:40:46] don't be afraid of it from that because
[1:40:48] once you confess it holly
[1:40:50] god is showing it to you once he shows
[1:40:52] it to you
[1:40:53] he has to deal with it
[1:40:58] and once he did church i hope you
[1:41:01] catching me
[1:41:02] if god shows you your past you repent
[1:41:06] he deals with it it's done
[1:41:10] the only thing you can do then is move
[1:41:12] forward in truth
[1:41:15] hallelujah that's how you receive the
[1:41:17] holy ghost because the devil has no more
[1:41:19] connection to you
[1:41:20] by your past your past has been forgiven
[1:41:25] holy prime example rahab the harlot when
[1:41:28] god
[1:41:29] dealt with her he dealt with a past
[1:41:32] hallelujah because when he destroyed
[1:41:35] jericho
[1:41:36] he destroyed her past
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:39] so there were no more claims on her as a
[1:41:42] prostitute
[1:41:43] because from that point when jericho was
[1:41:45] destroyed
[1:41:46] there was no other men that could say
[1:41:47] they ever slept with rahab
[1:41:54] now she could just walk in the truth
[1:41:59] and you know one thing i love about god
[1:42:02] he knows how to
[1:42:03] move that scene out of the way and deal
[1:42:05] right with that seed
[1:42:07] you know what they did as they talked to
[1:42:08] ray have rabbis and men's hearts melt
[1:42:11] we've heard what so god did out there in
[1:42:13] the wilderness at the red sea and all
[1:42:15] these things
[1:42:16] and they began to talk and talk and
[1:42:18] rahab like this woman she said
[1:42:21] she said give me others water oh
[1:42:24] hallelujah
[1:42:24] what's the real dude ray i said give me
[1:42:26] a token
[1:42:30] y'all know that's message language
[1:42:34] that's believers language hallelujah
[1:42:38] hurry that's bride language
[1:42:41] holy rahab say give me a true token
[1:42:47] and the bible says by that token her
[1:42:49] father's
[1:42:50] and her mother her house was saved
[1:42:55] by that token oh
[1:42:58] my let god deal with your past stop
[1:43:00] holding on to it
[1:43:03] all he's trying to do is move that out
[1:43:05] of the way so he can deal directly with
[1:43:07] you
[1:43:09] and what are you if you get your sins
[1:43:11] out of the way
[1:43:12] what are you a god amen
[1:43:16] i know that was kind of strong for you
[1:43:17] right there
[1:43:22] listen
[1:43:26] he says that when the holy spirit in him
[1:43:28] moved away her past life
[1:43:30] and showed it to her the light struck it
[1:43:33] she said sir i perceive you're a
[1:43:35] i perceive where i'm at where i'm at
[1:43:38] where i'm at
[1:43:46] all right and my lawn set
[1:43:56] all right he says now we know i know
[1:44:00] that when the messiah comes that's what
[1:44:04] he's doing that's what he's going to be
[1:44:06] and we ain't had a profit for hundreds
[1:44:09] of years we've had
[1:44:10] never had a true profit for hundreds of
[1:44:12] years and she said how
[1:44:14] you tell me about my husband and told me
[1:44:18] how many i've had and so forth why said
[1:44:21] i don't understand this
[1:44:22] see darkness doesn't comprehend light
[1:44:25] so that's why god was bringing her into
[1:44:27] the light so she could understand but
[1:44:29] what he had to do
[1:44:30] he had to move away her darkness
[1:44:34] because the end of the story is she's
[1:44:36] running down into the city saying
[1:44:38] come see a man who told me all things
[1:44:46] listen what happens when the truth comes
[1:44:51] and you respond differently look at how
[1:44:55] the true elect of god respond
[1:44:59] they hear the word they hear the truth
[1:45:01] and they connect with it and move
[1:45:03] forward
[1:45:04] listen what the prophet said
[1:45:08] this is in christ the mission of god
[1:45:09] reveal real quick
[1:45:11] he says when it struck them priests
[1:45:15] they said this man is a fortune teller
[1:45:19] see no life in there
[1:45:23] the same light the same truth hallelujah
[1:45:27] dealing with the priests and they said
[1:45:29] this man is a fortune teller why
[1:45:31] because they wasn't connected to truth
[1:45:35] they probably said they had no life in
[1:45:36] there holy
[1:45:38] a hybrid to come up as a as far as an
[1:45:42] organization but die
[1:45:43] from that from their own
[1:45:47] when jesus came they called him bias
[1:45:48] above they called the devil and
[1:45:49] everything
[1:45:50] and he was truth why they couldn't
[1:45:53] receive it
[1:45:53] wasn't no life inside
[1:45:57] so we don't have to pick each other out
[1:46:00] and say this
[1:46:00] is bride that is bride this one brian
[1:46:02] brought no you know who you are but how
[1:46:04] you respond to the word of god
[1:46:08] not just your amens in church but the
[1:46:10] life you live when you leave here
[1:46:14] hallelujah because we're born to put on
[1:46:16] a good show now
[1:46:21] look i know some people
[1:46:24] i know some people shout the church down
[1:46:29] get god praise i mean he looks like a
[1:46:30] different person
[1:46:35] it wasn't connecting with the truth
[1:46:38] but you notice when this woman connected
[1:46:40] hallelujah
[1:46:42] her life changed when rahab connected
[1:46:45] her life changed when peter hallelujah
[1:46:48] and the rest of the disciples when they
[1:46:49] connected their life changed when they
[1:46:52] connected with that truth
[1:46:54] their life changed so i'm going to tell
[1:46:56] you church hallelujah
[1:46:58] hallelujah why am i a message believer
[1:47:00] not just because
[1:47:02] i know god seen william branham no

[1:47:32] those mp3s changed my life
[1:47:36] because i was living in darkness
[1:47:38] hallelujah
[1:47:40] raised up in sin but then i heard the
[1:47:43] word of god
[1:47:44] through a trial
[1:47:48] called cancer
[1:47:51] thank god for cancer
[1:47:57] because cancer was the thing that
[1:48:00] brought the light in my room
[1:48:04] hallelujah so you ought to rejoice when

[1:48:08] holy do y'all know god purposely
[1:48:11] listen uh don't forget this word god

[1:48:23] purposely
[1:48:24] let you go through things so you can
[1:48:27] experience an
[1:48:28] attribute that you haven't experienced
[1:48:33] hallelujah
[1:48:38] let's walk in the light of the word
[1:48:43] because if we walk in what's been
[1:48:45] revealed
[1:48:46] we walk in truth
[1:48:49] and anything false will never overcome
[1:48:52] truth
