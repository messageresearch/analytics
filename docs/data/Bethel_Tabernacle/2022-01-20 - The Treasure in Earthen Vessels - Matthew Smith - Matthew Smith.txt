for coming out tonight i got something on my heart i actually initially had something on my heart and i i you know we talked brother jason about it and he was going to give me a a wednesday night to you know talk to y'all and a couple days later i got something else on my heart and it you know had the age-old struggle of what do i preach and then the more i kind of looked into it the more i realized it kind of went hand in hand and i really had one thought of my heart from two different angles so we're going to try to get through it all tonight with god all things are possible and so um we want to invite you right into the word tonight i kind of want to take as a theme um this scripture um i don't know that i'll reference it a whole lot but it's sort of the theme of what i want to kind of cover um and i want to go to psalms 139 and we'll start at verse 1. and i'll wait for y'all to turn there um and while y'all are turning i'm gonna change the batteries in this microphone the handheld tonight because the earpieces make my glasses fall off and then i hear brother tony leaving songs and he uses the handheld so i know how to change batteries awesome all right um psalms 139 verse 1 o lord thou hast searched me and known me thou hast thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising thou understand this my uh thought afar off thou compasses my path and my laying down and are acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh lord thou knowest it altogether thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it and then skipping down to verse 13 for thou has possessed my reigns thou hast covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth then eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i wake i am still with thee amen as the let's bow our hearts and speak to the lord lord we want to thank you for coming and being here this evening it's so wonderful every to be in your presence that you would anoint my lips lord that to speak the words that these people would need to hear and lord i know that i can't give them anything of my own intellect anything that i would be able to give them would just create more of me and the world does not need any more of that so i asked the lord that you would help me to relax and get out of the way and not allow my nerves to hinder what might you would need to speak to these people and that i would be able to be calm and and be a true microphone for you to speak through and we asked that you would anoint the people's ears that they would be able to hear and pull and operate the gift or do we know that any gift that i have isn't for me to create some sort of beautiful presentation but that i would just be able to get out of the way and and be a channel that the people could operate the gift and that they would be able to to to hear the words that they would need to get them through to the other side and we ask these things and we we appreciate your presence lord and we ask that you be with us throughout the service in jesus name amen and you all can be seated um so i want to start i said i had kind of two two thoughts on my heart and so i'm going to try to take them in phases kind of have phase one and phase two and um the quicker i could get some water the better i got thank you got some dry mouth like you wouldn't believe um so um second thing that kind of i want to start with the second thing first and so the other day i was listening i started going through the seals again and so i started the first seal and brother branham kind of comes down and he gets to this point where he um is talking about the uh white horse rider oh thank you and um he uh so he starts talking about how he hadn't fully understood um what it was about that he looked at all the commentaries and they had all said that it was um the holy spirit had gone forth um but that that day the lord had revealed to him that it wasn't the holy spirit that the white horse rider was actually the antichrist posing as the holy spirit and trying to fake it right and so he he's so we'll kind of set some context up um in revelations uh chapter six verse one it says and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard and it were the noise of thunder one of the four bees saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and so he you know after this brother branham kind of comes down does a bunch of commentary on that and then he comes down to show the distinction that there is christ does come on a right white horse with a crown but that's in in revelations chapter 19 and so he reads a couple verses there he reads verse 11 and 12. and it says and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and so i'm going to pick up from after brother brandon reads this i want to pick up his his kind of commentary um he says i wish i could stop on this a minute brother brandon knocks on the pulpit and pauses editor oh my i got a good notion but maybe i could if you in the congregation says go ahead it says see nobody knows it did you ever know what the name of uh that the name of jehovah is not correct anybody knows dr vale you know that's true the translators could never translate it it's spelled jvhu uh isn't it it isn't jehovah they couldn't touch it they don't know what it is called it jehovah but it wasn't his name right and he's referencing the fact that jvhu isn't really a thing that you can pronounce that's just what was in the text but you can't really pronounce it there's not a jehovah's just a way to pronounce what we don't know how to pronounce um he says look every time is a victory one or something goes on a name is changed look at the days of abraham he was first abram and never could have that baby until his name was changed to abraham and sarah s-a-r-r-a could not have nothing but a dead womb until her name was changed to s-a-r-a-h okay and then i'm going and he kind of goes down and talks about all the different people who have their names changed um he talks about uh you know jacob and peter um and uh you know simon to peter jacob to israel and it comes down to saul he said saul good name saul was a king one time in israel but he a saul didn't fit an apostle might be all right for a king but not an apostle so jesus changed his name from what from saul to paul now i find this really interesting that brother branham is pointing out he's making an indication that when somebody is shifting position god will actually change their name to indicate what their new position is or if he has a purpose for them or what their their office is kind of changing he'll change their name to reflect their new office right he indicates saul was a perfectly fine name now i actually happen to look up the names uh what the what they mean and i kind of had a couple different places but the best i could find is that saul means desired another place that i found said it was sort of uh prayed for as it or or desired or or asked for um that in other literally what the what the his story was that the people asked god for a king and saul whose name literally means asked for comes along but see this isn't really a good name for an apostle instead it had to be paul which means humble or small okay so the point here is that i'm kind of driving at is when god changes somebody's name it actually changes what they'll manifest right there's there's a life behind the name that you're going to manifest when your name is changed okay um and he says and so continuing on from uh from saul to paul he says and jesus his name on earth was redeemer uh when he was on earth he was the redeemer that's true but he when he conquered death in hell and overcame them and ascended on high he received a new name that's the reason you holler the way you do and they don't get nothing it'll be revealed in the thunders uh-huh see notice the mysteries he's coming writing there's got to be something to change the church you know that there's got to be something notice no man knowed but himself and he reiterates now notice no man node but himself so here he goes he indicates that when someone has their name changed or it's it's an indication that their their their purpose has changed then he goes down all this list of people in in the bible who had their name changed and how their their their manifestation changed based on the name the that they their new name then he indicates that jesus was on on earth as the redeemer then it sins and gets a new name so he's indicating that jesus got an uh changed and got a new name and and therefore his position or purpose is now shifting slightly and then he says that there's got to be something to change the church and the next thing he says is no man knows it which is a reference to the name that no man know knows from revelations 19. okay and so are you guys kind of picking up where i'm going with this and he says and notice and i'm going to skip down a couple paragraphs here he says notice uh christ is not seen anymore see from the time there but he is on a white horse uh so if this guy is writing a right horse talking about the white horse writer he's an impersonator of christ see you get that congregation says amen notice the writer on the white horse don't have any name he might use two or three titles c but he ain't got no name but christ has a name what is it the word of god that's what it is in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word made flesh see the writer has no name but christ is called the word of god that's what he is he is called that now he's got a name that no man knows but he's called the word of god okay so that's interesting it's an interesting statement he's he's called something that we do know but the name is something that we don't know okay now i thought about this for a minute and well how does how does that work out well after i thought about it for a minute why okay well my name is matthew right everybody all know that but maybe somebody that i've never met before wouldn't know my name but my name means god's gift well you could say that my name is matthew and this guy's never met me might not know my name but i'm also called god's gift okay so christ can have this name that no man knows but we know what it means right we know the essence of it we know what it's going to manifest right we have an indication of what that's going to be so um now the next thing that i wanted to to uh kind of look at is that in when he's referencing uh back here when he says um christ has the name uh the word of god what is it in the beginning was the word the word was god and word was with god and the word was made flesh he's referencing john chapter uh chapter 1 verse 1 and down to verse 14. and um that word as i'm sure you're all aware in the greek is translated to logos now logos i kind of looked into this a lot and it really blew my mind how much there really is in there i don't know if i'll have a whole lot of time to kind of stop on it for a minute um but i'll take a couple minutes um so um the origin of this of this word logos is how it's pronounced in the greek is actually um where we get the word logic from right it is intellect or reasoning or rationality is a lot of different ways you could kind of say it but specifically expressed through the spoken word the original sort of usage of this word would be kind of what we would refer to as a verbal argument it's not just sort of like the logic in your head it's actually what's spoken if you translate it literally it kind of it can mean word that's why in saint john when st john wrote logos the later translators translated logos as word because it kind of means that but specifically what it means is intellect spoken right or intelligence spoken or logic spoken and that's part of it um but see because the greek started using this word about 600 years bc is when the the sort of the idea of logos kind of started coming around but a couple hundred years later you had this group of philosophers called the stoics and they had they took this concept of logos and they expanded it and they said we believe there's a great divine intellect this intellect that sort of underpins all of reality and this intellect it's sort of a supreme logic this this divine consciousness that is expressing itself like sort of like a spoken word kind of thing and as it expresses it manifests into reality and they were right that's that's exactly what it is um and but the way they kind of conceptualized it is it's sort of like a pre-programmed thing like in your mind you have maybe uh something that you're thinking about you know like a a story but in your head it's not logos when you speak it it's logos right actually when it comes out of your mouth is when it becomes logos when it's in your head it's not that's not really what it is it's not until it actually is expressed and they kind of had this idea that kind of at the beginning of everything you have this divine intellect and the way they described it obviously they wouldn't use this analogy but this is the best way i kind of come up with it is actually sort of like a computer program it's this this divine plan that is unraveling and as it unravels what's inside of it becomes real and so um caleb do you have that thing set up for me this is a picture just a quick little demonstration to kind of explain so okay turn it off like like kill it for a second okay so somewhere there's an intelligence back there in the booth in a computer that has all this programming it's a computer it's it's it's got a sort of electronic intellect and so that image that was up there exists right now but it's in ones and zeros it it nowhere can you can see it or interact with it or feel it or touch it but with a push of a button there it is that program manifested right the electronic intellect manifested into a way that you can see it it expressed itself okay so what we're so kind of put a a bow on this when christ uh going going back to to revelations 19 when christ ascends and he's got this name that no man knows but we know that it's effectively synonymous with logos christ is ascending and he's taking this position as the divine intellect that will manifest itself into reality right and specifically it's going to manifest itself as flesh it's going to unpack and we see it in nature too look at dna dna is a package of programming right it's in the it's in every seed you know you have a little acorn inside of that is a genetic package that is an oak tree but in in code right it's just it's just conceptual but once you put it in the ground and the thing manifests it turns into a bagel oak tree so the logos of the acorn manifested into the reality of an oak tree okay the same thing with a baby you have a little fertilized cell and in nine months it the logos manifest into life into a baby and so here's god manifesting he's he's conceptual and so once he takes this position and um uh as as this having this name that no man knows but we know that what it means is the plan of god unraveling into reality now going back to um uh i wanna i wanna pick up um the story of ruth for a minute now i in my haste forgot to write down exactly where in the bible this is so we're going to turn to the book of ruth um i believe it's hang on yep judges ruth and i believe okay so we're gonna go to ruth chapter three um and um we'll go to verse 16 and just pause there for a minute um and so i'm going to put a little context on this so in the story ruth is gone uh naomi sends her off to go meet boaz on the threshing floor she goes there uh she spends the night uh boaz tells her that he's gonna um you know he betrothed himself to her and then before he says you can't really be seen here it's gonna be real bad you gotta get out of here before anybody wakes up um so it's you know in the early light no man nobody can tell one from another and she you know he fills her veil full of uh full of uh barley and sends her back home she comes back to the house and um chapped into verse 16. says and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all the man had done to her now i read for a long time this verse i've read the book of ruth many many times i've read this verse a lot of times and every time i read it i read that as she knocked on the door and naomi said who's there but that doesn't make any sense okay because she responds with and she told her all that the man did to her and also why would naomi say who art thou my daughter okay that's so what actually happens is ruth knocks on the door and she's like nailed me no you're not gonna believe what happened and naomi's like ruth what's your last name who are you because she's recognizing that when ruth goes off to meet boaz in the threshing floor and gets in his presence she's not gonna come back the same person she's recognized ruth who are you you're you're not ruth no more you're mrs boaz what's your name who are you and so you see where i'm going with this so fast forward here's christ in an invisible union we're not people you're not catherine you're not josh right you're not brother andrew we're mrs jesus christ right there's a name attached to this and the name we've already established when you get a name change it manifests into something new mrs boaz falls in love with the redeemer and what does she do the next like the next chapter she has a baby right when she gets her name changed she manifests the redeemer okay so we get a name change we're gonna manifest whatever name got attached to that you know so going back to abraham and sarah as far as i'm aware abraham and sarah are the only people that ever got any piece of jehovah's name when god changed their name that they got a piece of jehovah attached to them right that he because he added an h to their name and brother branham goes through there and he talks about how that was the h from jehovah well what did that manifest in abraham and sarah body change right now i am not mrs h i am mrs jehovah there is a full name now attached abraham and sarah got a single piece a single letter out of that name and it gave him a body change temporarily they still died right they got old and died because they only had a fraction of the logos revealed to them only a fraction the logos manifested in their day only a piece of that name that no man knows actually manifested but not anymore right there's there's a whole name that's going to unfold and it's going to be more than just a body change and it's not going to be temporary it's not going to go back we're not going to get old and die so um so i uh gotta rehydrate um now i want to pick up and i want to um kind of transition a little bit uh and go down to um uh where did i go right okay so i'm gonna pick up this thing uh oh right so uh back up i gotta say this first um there's a piece of foundation that i want to hit um uh um he says brother brother brandon talking the first seals i just had it anyways he's talking about the the name of god um and i read it i just can't find it in my notes now um where he says that it's the name that no man knows but it'll be revealed and then thunders okay um we're all aware of what the thunders are right okay it is the word being revealed as the seals break so the name of god that no man knows will be revealed under the thunders okay this is so in other words it's being revealed when the seals break okay um so going down to um [Music] this quote okay so it says the breach this is the breach between the churches and seven seals the breach message we're all familiar um and he's talking about the seals and he says and the whole thing uh thing here is the seven seals got the mysteries of god from the foundation of the world all sealed up in there uh and revealed by seven different seals okay um uh that if god willing uh let us pull back these seals and look down through the book um book uh and find out what it's all about okay so he's saying you've got all these mysteries tied up in there and also we know that the name of god that no man knows is also synonymous effectively with this divine plan that's going to unravel itself okay so the divine plan that's going to unravel and manifest into reality god himself into reality into human form is tied up in the seals okay we're following we're following the logos here um and uh okay going down and he says um also continuing the breach he says jeremiah said this scroll must be kept um uh as you read it there he would say it um it must be kept in an earthy earthly vessel see oh what a beautiful thing there i could talk about a while this scroll was kept in an earthly vessel a vessel that once became flesh glory died rose again and kept in an earthly vessel until the time of the purchase oh my beautifully all right now these messages are all kept up until hit uh this uh earthly vessel until the time of god's appointed time at the last messenger at the earth and all that these people had judged and said i know it's there i believe it's there and they'd found it and brought it forth and produced the thing by faith they believed it but now it's going to be brought to us in revelation and from the hand of god by vindication god said so he promised it so here's brother branham talking about that god would take the seven seals the mysteries of the seven seals and put them in an earthly vessel he references christ but then he also references that they will continue in these earthly vessels until the end time well what earthly vessels because christ's earthly vessel wasn't here no more okay so i want to pick up uh second corinthians 4 um and seven um but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you um and i want to kind of reread this from the nlt because i kind of like the the way it um uh it says it um we now have this light shining in our hearts but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure this uh do we have it yeah um uh great treasure this makes it clear that our great power is from god not from ourselves we are pressed on every side by troubles but we are not crushed we are perplexed but not driven to despair we're hunted down but never abandoned by god we get knocked down but are not destroyed through sufferings our bodies continue to share in the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also also be seen in our bodies so we live in the face of death but this has resulted in eternal life for you uh wait did my notes go different from what's up there okay um uh oh sorry i missed it first oh there we go um but it is a result internal life for you okay so here's paul talking about how we have a we have the power of god within us we are an earthly vessel that contains the power of god okay um and we're gonna be pressured and put under pressure but we're not gonna be destroyed so that this power that's within us can manifest itself and give glory to god okay not of us but of god okay so i kind of want to shift and kind of pick up what my original kind of what started this thought um and kind of go into a dale smith gear um so i once upon a time worked in a ceramics plant now ceramic for any of you guys who are aware is basically like pottery um it's modern pottery um it's the same process it's clay you mold it into a shape you put it in a big oven cook it down and it turns into stone and then you use it for whatever it's for okay um all your dinner plates are ceramic well this kind of ceramic that i made is not dinner plate ceramic it is a special kind of ceramic called piezoelectric ceramic um it's it's 21st century pottery um very high-tech stuff it's not just it's engine it's a very engineered product um some very interesting properties and uh we'll we'll talk about it a little bit um so the way all this the way the process started right because it's it's what these components that we were making were used for was a lot of military applications so like one of the projects that i worked on was um detection systems for torpedoes like incoming torpedoes we made components within the guidance systems on cruise missiles um all kinds of stuff like that understandably when you're firing several hundred pounds of high explosives on a hypersonic rocket you kind of can't have any tolerance in the quality of your product right so the clay that we were using isn't just any old clay they didn't go out in the rio grande river and just dig some out of there it was very specifically engineered clay okay now we are also pots right we are vessels we are earth and vessels and god did not just find any old clay right we are 21st century clay some we are we're some pretty high-tech mud all right okay this is this is um right god engineers us i want to pick up this um this quote this is from things that are to be just like your birth here i said you were prepared god knew you would be here and now you know even things uh that your parents done now people think uh that isn't visited from generation to generation but it is over in the book of hebrews i believe about the seventh chapter speaking paul there the writer as i believe it was was speaking on a great uh event that taken place with abraham um and i'm gonna skip down some of this and and he skips down and he says um see you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight amen do you guys know that right did you know that just think that you at one time i'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were in the betting ground in the womb of of mother through holy wedlock and then you became a person expressed in the image like your father then there's fellowship right what do we see here you were in the unexpressed form right and through the logos the expression of the internal logic you manifested right through this plan of god okay and god pre-planned you he you your generation you went back many generations right why right you have very specific purpose because every one of everybody has to be different everybody has to be unique remember at the ceramics plant we had a lot of different applications right not every component went to it went to one thing like i said we had hundreds of different components and god's factory has a lot of different components a lot of different people right as much as i might want to be a very articulate and well put together and never nervous and cool under pressure minister like brother jason i will never be that it's not in my genetics and i might want to be some fireball dynamo preacher like brother brad it's not in my genetics right i'm going to preach about ceramics because it's in my genetics because there was a time when dale smith preached about ceramics okay i'm i'm the son of a man who preached about magnets and fire and motor oil for 30 years and now i'm preaching about my job you know from a few years back okay this is because because why because maybe there's somebody who needs to hear it the way i have i can tell it right maybe there's someone who needs to hear it the way you have to tell it you do realize that preachers aren't the only ones who have to witness to people right we're all supposed to be witness witnessing and maybe god made you the way you are because there's someone out there who's only be going to be able to hear the gospel in the way that you specifically can tell it okay so um now this kind of leaves a question because we're not always given what we call good genes right i when i was a little boy had a wretchedly hot temper okay i once tried to beat a neighbor kid to death with a shovel granted he tried to he touched my sister inappropriately but um it happened um and i tried to i tried to keep like i went berserk okay and you think wow you got this horrible hot temper from brother dale that crazy ex-marine sort of no you see a little dorothy lloyd now you all know my grandmother little darling dorothy lloyd who is an absolute sweetheart and who all of you just love she's just just the sweetest thing would never hurt a fly but that's because you all know holy ghost filled many years of growing dorothy lloyd you did not know unregenerate heathen little dorothy okay now little now reddock by the way red hawk is scottish and the scottish are a bunch of violent drunk like hot-headed violent people and it's in the blood and and little dorothy reddock one time um decided she was at her at her grandparents house and she sit in there at dinner time and she says pass the taters and her grandfather says dorothy say please and she said i said pass the taters and her grandfather said dorothy say please and she said i said pass the taters and she threw a fork at him and it stuck right in his face right there in his chin because it's in her genetics right now she got the holy ghost and doesn't do that no more i got the holy ghost and i don't try to kill people with shovels no more the point is sometimes god puts things in you that you might not have expected right it seems kind of toxic to have a fiery hot temper and the problem is and i know it's kind of funny but hey guess what um the neighbor kid wasn't the only one i tried to kill right my brother's got stitches in his forehead right and it wasn't real funny and it feels real bad when you're the one who tried to kill your brother and it's the problem isn't that the things that you have don't hurt you they hurt the people around you right and in the ceramics plant when they're mixing the batches for all these beautiful uh different purposes one of the main ingredients that they put in there is powderized lead now that stuff's real toxic it will give you brain damage and you will lose iq points if you get that stuff in your blood um and they treated it like it was exactly what it was they completely sealed off half the building the huge plant um you couldn't enter in there without a basically a spacesuit um they the people who worked in that area the plant had to be blood tested every six months to make sure they weren't getting lead poisoning it was a whole thing right because they're mixing the batches in there now my job was kind of right on the border like i was on the clean side and then but i didn't go into the toxic side but i could see in there through like the plastic curtains and whatnot and so i'm seeing them all walk around and then i'm noticing wait a minute the ceramic is coming out of there and it's going on these trays and coming through this curtain and then we're over here picking it up and handling it and they give us like some little latex gloves and we're wearing t-shirts and tennis shoes why don't we have bunny suits on right it's the same stuff why why is this ceramic that we're handling okay to touch but when they're touching it they're wearing spacesuits and so i go to my my the engineer who is in charge of this whole process and i go hey man um i'm a little weirded out what's what's the deal why why do we not have all the safety procedures isn't it toxic and he goes well that's a really good question he goes but you see what happens is while it's in that powderized form it's dangerous because you can it can get aerosolized and you can you can inhale it and get it through your skin he goes but what happens is it gets first of all by the way this powderized oop that's my alarm there it is okay go away all right um so um it's it gets put into this giant pressure press the hydraulic press that um this powderized clay mix and it gets put under like ten thousand pounds of pressure and it crushes it into the shape that um they want it in right it doesn't really go on a potter's wheel that really wouldn't work and so sometimes when god is molding us it feels like we're in a ten thousand pound vice um but ultimately you're gonna have the shape that he needs you to be and it'll hold that shape for a while but by the way in that form it's really brittle if you drop it it'll shatter and it's still toxic right if you touch it wrong it'll bust and a lot of people they'll get real sanctified and they'll have the shape of a christian right but they're still toxic and if you poke them a little bit they'll break and it'll get all over you right so so i asked this i asked my engineer what so going back to why he said that he was okay first to handle this ceramic he says because between the time that it goes through the the molding vice the hydraulic press and by the time it gets to you it goes through a giant oven okay that oven takes 18 hours huge conveyor belt it goes through there takes 18 hours and that stuff cooks at i forget what the temperature was it's hot enough to turn dirt into jello okay and it cooks like that for a long time and when it comes out he and this was his exact words he said the heat the fire binds the toxic elements of the lead and incorporates it into the structure so that it becomes useful for its intended purpose okay i might have had a nasty temper little dorothy reddock might have had a nasty temper but both of us came in contact with some fire one day and it doesn't go poisoning anybody anymore doesn't go we don't go hurting nobody anymore but what it does do is it i'm not sure what it did for me but i know for grandma gave her a lot of courage to go spread the word and not be shy in the face of danger i know that much i know that there's a lot of times we don't understand why we were the way they that we were but when we come in contact with the fire of the holy ghost it'll change you right when you come in contact with the redeemer it changes who you are it's going to functionally change you and you're not going to express the same toxic attitude that you have what it will do is it will restructure you into something useful look at peter peter tried to hack a dude's head off he got his ear but they wouldn't go for the ear right and then a little while later he comes in f in contact with some fire and now he's preaching you know these men are not drunk like you supposed he's got all this fireball courage where do you think that came from not all the disciples were out there preaching like that okay what was it peter had this this drive this go get it we're gonna just go do it before it expressed in a toxic way and then he gets the holy ghost and expresses in a holy way okay now it still kind of begs the question what's the point of all this because you can say well god has a plan for us and he wants us to do all this stuff but it still seems kind of unfair that he would make us toxic and hurt all these people and then make us go through an oven and suffer to fix it he made it this way and then he's gonna make a suffer to fix it what in the world what is the what could possibly be so important that i have to go through all of this well remember i said this stuff was called piezo electric now i want to read to you the um scroll up here this is um this is from the very uh uh credible source wikipedia um but i can assure you this is accurate because i worked in this field okay um uh piezoelectricity is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials such as crystals certain ceramics and i didn't know this by the way until i read this um and biological matter such as bone dna and virus proteins in response to applied mechanical stress the uh what hang on oh dear oh no my my quotation got messed up um anyways upshot is um if you squeeze this stuff in the right way it generates electricity okay the point of all of this the point of the heat and the pressure and the and the the molding hydraulic press and then all the fire and all the lead and all of it is so that that oh by the way in there also it gets coated in gold um just saying um after after the fire by the way you don't get that until after you get the holy ghost um the uh the [Music] is coated in gold and then the purpose of it is so that when they put pressure on it it just manifests power power just comes out of it right that's what the purpose of all of this is there's going to be a time when you're going to come under pressure right and you're going to manifest power because it's what's in you it's the logos in you it's the purpose it's the program that was programmed into you that when you come under pressure when when the bills get really tight because you decided to pay your tithes you're going to come under pressure and then power's going to come out of you and that power is going to be jehovah jireh the provider and you're going to manifest jehovah jireh in that moment right why that's the power that's in that all of that process decided to or all that process was there to culminate in in that you would be um in that you would manifest this power uh at the crucial moment right we can see this with david david spends his all of his life with all the suffering and things right you wonder why why did david get chased around the desert by paul by saul rather he's anointed king he has a promise why didn't he be like well it's my promise it's my right i'm just gonna go kill this guy and be king right he had more than enough opportunity to do it why was it that god inspired him to go suffer in the desert and get chased around for all this time because he's preparing him for something one day in the future david is going to suffer the consequences of his own actions and be deposed by his own son and he's going to have to go run for his life in the desert right absalom has him on the run and in that amount of time all that suffering here's david after going through all this this fire and all the stuff he's now at a point where he can walk up the mount of olives and weep and foreshadow christ amen right and that's the point that's why we go through all of this stuff that's why we have to go get cooked and get all the stuff that isn't good burnt out of us and all the toxic nonsense cooked out of us so that there will come a point when the squeeze comes down and you manifest the program that built you amen right and um i just uh i don't know why this just came on my heart um this isn't really in my notes but it kind of came in my head just now um one of the interesting things that i saw that i noticed with david is here he goes through all this this struggle right he finally gets to the point where he can manifest christ he's walking up the hill he's ex he's extending christ to his own son who has rejected him and he's forgiving this boy and he he goes and they're about to have the great battle and he tells his generals don't hurt this boy don't do it right go easy on him because david is looking at this with the with the way christ would look at it it was unfair i got rejected when i didn't deserve it and now but i'm gonna forgive him anyways i will i will reconcile i will redeem my son and he finally gets to this point and then some other person swoops in and executes absalom when absalom is hanging in a tree from his hair now i don't know why this came on my heart but what i do know is that it seems to me like a lot of times parents will have their kids they will go through a lot of trouble right absalom or you know parents the reason why parents have the kids that they do right remember god if you god picked you to have those kids and kids god picked those parents for you right you you're pre-planned to back to many generations don't be so bitter at your parents first of all because they know they probably have gone through a lot the struggles a lot closer to what to you than what you think right because they have the same genetics you're probably predisposed to have a lot of the same struggles right not only that but parents are going to be a lot closer to that that teenagers or that child struggle than a lot of people might think because they have the same genetics right those parents are the best possible people to help that child when they're in a rebellious position and so finally when parents will finally get to the point where this their kid is finally he they've rebelled but they're finally at a point where they could reach out they're helpless all their defenses are down absalom has he lost the battle he's hanging from a tree by a haircut and here comes some other adult to execute him when david was like no bring him back if you just get him to me i'll be able to fix it i'll be able to manifest christ to him so i guess what i'm going for here is a lot of times we might see teenagers who are struggling who are who did a lot of rebellious nonsense and they went through some really bad times but when you finally see them just because they're hung up on a haircut or some small thing leave them alone get them let their parents reconcile with them don't just go in there i'm like well i'll tell this boy what what for right why right that's not in my notes that's free um so um amy how um so and i guess i'll end on this there is one other property of that piezoelectric ceramic that is really interesting so the same science and the same math equations that say that if you twist that ceramic a little bit it'll generate electricity also says that if you apply electricity to it it'll twist so the other purpose that god the other thing that god is trying to accomplish with your life is that when you come in the presence of power you move right you jump up and down and you shout and you praise the lord or maybe you're in a situation where someone needs to act and the power will follow you in that moment and then you will you will move and you will act and you will accomplish exactly what god needed you to accomplish right it goes both ways so i i guess usually people tell you the title at the beginning i will tell you the title now the title of this of this service was that the name of the lord or the the uh what did i title it yeah you're right you're absolutely right and i would have remembered anyways what was it treasure and earth and vessels we have a treasure in our in earth and vessels it's the power the logos that god has put in you it is the programming that god has built into you that when you come under pressure you're going to manifest something beautiful and something powerful and going back to and just just hit that one last point that when abraham and sarah got their name changed they manifested a body change and there's gonna come a day that the it feels like we're in a dark age things are getting really tight things are getting really pressurized but you're going to come under pressure and you're going to manifest something that's going to just blow you out of this world so that's it we'll call the musicians back up um i want to sing um that song what did i come out on um how great is our god i was really liking that and i want to sing it some more how great is [Music] great is [Music] sing with me how great is is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] is let's lift our hands my hallelujah thank you lord jesus amen praise the lord you appreciate the word amen appreciate that brother matthew i think man i would have never known that was his first sermon here at this church uh you'd have never known it amen lourdes really i really appreciated that he was just able to be matthew [Music] and you know that's what our was we were i was so myself just so um shocked by when he uh spoke just for our young people and i just mean that because um he he just be was himself and he just began to speak just like he did here tonight very similar and man after just a few minutes i don't think there was anybody that wasn't just right in tune with what he had to say the lord gifted him put it i love how he said that that he'll never be you know he'll never you're not even gonna be his dad he'll be matthew and appreciated that we've seen that here tonight the lord could just use a thought that god placed upon his heart treasure and earth and vessels amen and i'm certainly grateful that the lord could take our is amazing how well that tied in with brother diggs that the lord could take something that could seem so negative even your own genes your own genetics and ways that you were made he talked about his temper and uh gotta be careful they're talking about grandma she's probably streaming here tonight but um sister dorothy we love you we really do god bless you and we love uh we love who you are now and who you were before and and then you're a daughter of god amen appreciate that brother matthew that was good it was really good it was amazing because i was reading just here uh ministering in washington just a couple just a week ago i guess it was and i was preaching taking uh brother branham when he talks about that young man who was going to get married had a fiancee i think it was it was brother branham's nephew and he starts the mother and the father approach him and say you know he's got this issue he won't forgive her and then brother branham just starts looking into her he's speaking speaking to the mom of the boy and then the dad and he starts looking and he says look at your family and he points to the mother and it says you know your family was germans they're stoic and brother branham starts talking about how that he said you're even your people your sister he said i seen her this morning and said how you doing and he said she just stared at me fine morning he said she just stared at me and he said that's how that's how you were he said that's how your people are so they're real they hold grudges he said they can't ask for forgiveness and then he looks at the father he says look at your family brother branham's actually talking about his own his own family and he says they're what are they they're all fighters they're all drunks he said they have they just you know temper like a buzz saw and he says but look at you he's and he looks at the mom he says now that's your entire family your people's that way and he looks at the dad he said that's how your people are and then he says but look at you and he looks at the mother he says now you're not that way he says you're sweet you're forgiving you're kind and he said now what made you that way the lord jesus made you that way he looks at the dad he says now that's your family they're fighters they're brawlers he says but you're not that way and he says see he says when you receive the holy ghost and brother adam says it this way he says it's no longer your people anymore he says it's that jesus living down inside of you amen and i believe that's brother brandon begins to talk and he says now what do how what what will it take for that boy he says so try to overcome it he can try everything within his will that he says but until he's received the holy ghost he'll never overcome it because even after you receive the baptism of the holy spirit it's not you overcoming it it's christ living down inside you amen appreciate the word we have some prayer requests we want to look at thank you amen brother matthew that was wonderful brother tony writes in and just says can you clo he writes in for his sister sister smith here uh also pray for my mom the procedure that she had did not correct the problem with her heart valve so we want to remember sister smith here going to pray for her but matthew i'm going to have you come back up and lead us in prayer and then a prayer request here says please pray for a little baby a little baby boy named troy uh who we need to have who he who needs to have heart surgery and for a co-worker cat is that right melissa sister melissa uh and another co-worker who is sick with covid so this little baby boy troy who is in need of a surgery heart surgery and also for her two co-workers had uh two also requests let me make sure i get these and if i miss any brother jason just let me know i think i got them all just here in the text message um request says brother bruce perez uh writes in brother jason greetings in the precious name of the lord jesus christ i have a prayer request for our son bruce aaron who has carpal tunnel syndrome in both of his hands and tendinitis in his left elbow which make working very difficult for him looking forward for tonight's service god bless you brother bruce also my grandmother sister jean says my sister connie fell on ice three days ago and her arm and shoulders hurt bad she's having surgery january 24th soon as the doctor can get her please have the church pray for her her she has a fracture on her shoulder and a long hard recover and we're just believing for a quick recovery amen maybe you have something on your heart i don't know if my phone was since about 11 o'clock verizon had an issue with it just got it right before service so if anybody sent me notifications i didn't get them uh today so is that all of them maybe an unspoken prayer request something upon your heart you just want the church to pray you just want to lift that up to the lord brother matthew come and lead us amen and these needs [Music] and let's all bow our hearts lord we want to come before you this evening father we're a needy people we have we know that you're the great healer and and you're our father and when we come to you with with these needs that you will provide for us and and when we ask for bread you do not give us stones lord we we know that you're that you're a healer and that when you came you were a carpenter and you you came to to fix broken things and lord we want to ask for our sister smith lord she's she's got this this this heart problem and and we we're we are claiming this healing on her behalf we know that you came to to heal the broken we're claiming this that by your stripes we are healed and you've you could not do any more for us now than than when you were standing here or any more that if you were standing here then you've already done and we asked for these co-workers lord that sister melissa and and uh this um this co-worker stick with covid and this little boy named troy father we don't i don't know their their situation or their spiritual situation but we do know that when you came you healed people right you healed people why to to to show who you were that you were a god who could heal that you were that you were a fixture of the broken that if you could heal their body you could heal their heart and i don't know the spiritual state of these people but maybe they have a broken heart and maybe you could you could come down and heal their broken body so they would have a hope of a fixed heart as well of a of a healed spirit and that you would they would see the savior with skin on it and and maybe that we could pray for them and and manifest you like you did that we would be able to reach out and and and and express healing to these people so they could see the christ in us and we we pray for uh our brother these this request for brother uh paris lord the paris family this this man with this uh their their son with carpal tunnel and we know that again you can heal we we know this we we claim this healing uh and um and our sister sister gene's uh sister connie lord with this surgery lord you made us from the ground up we know that you you saw us in our mother's wombs you crafted us by hand you molded us and you can mold these bones and these muscles back together you can guide the hands of the surgeon you created the medicine that they're going to use and we know that you could you can supercharge that you can guide their hands you could make it so that she wouldn't need the surgery in the first place if that's what would bring you the most glory and we ask that you do these things father we ask that you would go with the people tonight that the word would have an effect and that they would be able to manifest you and their lives not just at church but going out in the world and manifesting you and shining a light
