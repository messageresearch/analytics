years and days and hours it'll just be victory amen so we're thankful for that thankful to have you all out here today amen we're happy to have the williams family brother maurice and his family are here with us today so brother maurice he relocated uh took a job up around columbia way so we don't get to have him as often as we used to and uh we had a plan actually my family we were going to be out of town this weekend traveling thanks sir and um and uh so then we decided because of the different reasons whole host of reasons we decided to delay it but amen we kept brother maurice on the schedule and happy to have him here with us today amen praise the lord i was glad he he sent me a text last night reminding me of and i'm like that's right brother maurice praise the lord so we are so happy for that today and we want him to come and just take his time we haven't got to hear him in a while so you're going to pull on the gift of god amen we're happy to have brother joe's family here uh today happy to see brother joe back there praise the lord amen the lord is good amen the uh the devil tried every way in the world but the lord spared our brother and put you know took sister seal and i was sister dave and i were listening to yesterday uh brother branham preaching um sister bell's funeral wasn't it and he made a statement at the end i said honey isn't that exactly what it is and we were rejoicing you know sister belle she was an old saint of god just like sister seal and and and brother branham said she's asleep she said he said but she's only asleep to us she's awake to god i just thought man that is exactly right sister seal is just asleep to us but she's awake to god believe me she's wide awake amen so we're rejoicing for our sister today knowing that we will get to see her again amen that's the jubilee song let's sing some more sister damn brother maurice might lead us in a song or two oh when we all get to heaven oh what a day of rejoicing that will be [Music] one more time [Music] oh jesus [Applause] amen come on now we're not just doing these things and pressing our way out to service and doing what the scripture says just to do it but there's a goal in mind that we're moving towards it man and if you hadn't realized that by now that this year has been enough of a turmoil to let you know that there's got to be something better than what's going on right here amen and we're going to that place amen hallelujah and i'm here to let you know this morning and even in the midst of everything that's going on but the brandon said to bribe we could speak our own world amen step into that and you could be confident amidst the chaos going on hallelujah you can have victory when everybody else is struggling hallelujah you could be encouraged when everybody else is feeling discouraged amen but that's by the power of the blood of jesus christ if you love the lord let's give him a handclap of praise hallelujah glory to god hallelujah i won't go sing but i feel good this morning a little simple song victory is mine victory is mine victory today is mine [Music] victory is mine [Music] yes [Music] let's claim your peace peace is [Music] is let's say happiness is my happiness is mine happiness is mine happiness [Applause] is victory is mine victory you better claim it for yourself victory today [Music] sometimes you just got to confess it victory today belongs to me by the power of the blood of jesus christ amen let's look in the book of john the 13th chapter amen and we'll start at the 34th verse and appreciate all the musicians as always appreciate brother matt doing the song sir i didn't know he was a song leader he he came to work on my air conditioner a few months back we was in beaufort you know i saw he looked then he looked like an ac man when i found out he'll hear a solid amen so remember brother travis they did some a plus plus work for me amen and we appreciate it man god bless you all i'm grateful to have my wife here this morning by the power of the blood of jesus christ man in my family man they're here as well uh it's been an unusual year but we thank god for his grace amen it's been a year of things that we never even anticipated our plan but we thank god for his grace amen and us just coming up for thanksgiving you know this year this thanksgiving was a little bit different for me uh because it felt like i had a lot more to be grateful for man i know a lot of things been going on maybe personally in the saints lives and man even in my natural family we had a lot of people pass away some culvert related some not cover related they meant uh see my best friend from high school he lost a parent and my best friend from college lost a parent a man and i had close family members that lost parents one of my aunts passed away man two of mines passed away and then even uh in the midst everything going on sister tina's dad got very sick a minute he was on the ventilator for a few days a minute we seen some pass away but we seen by the grace of god that he's still on the scene and he was able to raise up my father-in-law off the ventilator by the grace of god amen so i'm saying all those things to say it it gives me a deep sense of appreciation because as you see the storm and the circumstances and the trials amen and all you got individual things that you had to go through man whether it's family members whether it was your jobs and different things but there's a god on the throne this morning and he's still in the business of keeping his people hallelujah and you know it makes us excited to be able to serve a god like that amen so we appreciate the invitation from brother jason this morning as always uh y'all keep sister blue and pray man she's still in the hospital she's kind of been in and out of icu and she had to have some different surgeries and things that was very high risk and had to move through some complications and fight with the breathing amen so y'all pray for it man the lord has kept it thus far and i looked at it as we've been still being in the fight each and every step of the way brother told me we're winning the fight amen so we're winning the fight by the grace of god so y'all remember the blue family brother blue has been strengths of him being in charleston a lot of man but the lord is in the business of taking care of his people and never forget that hallelujah we're going to look in the scripture this morning by the grace of god john the 13th chapter amen we usually read that for foot watching but we're going to go down a little bit further he's giving him some instructions as he leaves off the scene amen talking about the lord jesus this morning hallelujah hey amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i'm glad to be announced a little bit amen good to see all the saints here this morning amen and we'll just read it it says a new commandment i give unto you him preaching to the people amen that you love one another and he's going to give them a rubric or an example to show just how high you're supposed to love one another because you know we could say love in a lot of different ways but he says love one another as i have loved you now if you start to think i need to love somebody as the way that jesus christ loved us as individuals we cannot reach that with our own human mindset on our own human understanding he set the bar he set the ball very high by saying not only do you need to love one another but you need to love one another like i love you and the love of christ is something we can't explain we start here from now and we can spend a few years just trying to talk we can barely scratch the surface of the love of christ amen that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another praise god hallelujah let's just turn over to first peter four and seven and we'll read down to verse eight and then we'll let you have your seats this morning first peter 4 and 7 all the way down to verse 8 it's good to be able to read the word almighty god scripture says but the end of all things is at hand how many believe that this morning because you know it's easy to read over those words but if you truly believe that the end of all things are at hand it will cause you to govern yourself differently the end of all things is at hand now he's going to give some instructions peter's going to give some instructions if you truly believe that in all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and now he's going to give further instructions and this is where we're going to draw emphasis on this morning because we read some things about love in the book of john and it says in above all things it's a lot of things you need to have but above all those things have fervent charity among yourselves seem like a simple thing but nevertheless at the end time he's saying above all else have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins amen let's just buy his this morning father god in the name of jesus lord we just thank you for the opportunity to come out this morning lord gather together with believers of light precious faith look into your word lord and see what you have to say for your people lord lord we kind of a great blessing lord that lord despite this year lord being such an unusual year father god nevertheless lord we're still standing here this morning lord proving lord that you're still in the business of taking care of your people father lord i pray that lord you're blessed each and every believer that's here lord the different ones that may be listening lord through the internet by different means father god a lot of different ones on the road lord lord take care of your people father god you've done it so far lord and we always trust you continue to do so lord lord as we turn our attention to the word this morning lord lord we always look to lead this place different to how we came in and lord we know that by the power of your holy spirit father god that's always in us lord that we always leave this place different than how we came in we think in the lovely name of jesus christ let's saints say amen amen you can be seated this morning when we're looking at the instructions that that peter laid out and when we were reading to you about how i was saying at the end of all things is at hand the end of all things is at hand and he peter he lays out some different instructions and different directions and what he says is above all things have fervent charity among yourselves amen now we know that word charity it means love amen and we've been well taught through the through the message amen there's different types of love amen brother branham took a lot of time to break down to us the different types of love because if you were to take this word love amen and look at a greek translation of the bible we know that the term that it uses instead of saying charity and instead of saying love it actually uses the word of goth payment and a god for love amen is something that's different all together and you know we talk about eros love amen that's just a man looking at a woman with a short skirt on lord help us all amen then they talk about feeling love that might be the love that a man has for his wife amen but when we start to talk about the agape love it talks about the divine love that almighty god has shown us amen and as he's shown that divine love towards us his expectation is that we start to show divine love back one to another now it's one thing for us to be able to show and demonstrate agape love but see what peter is talking about he's talking about the end time amen and if you believe that we're at the end time there's a certain way that you got to govern yourselves even so our title for the swarming is going to be fervent agape at the end time even fervent agape at the end time amen i'm not here so much to preach you a love message this morning there man but this is an end time message the brother is sitting there saying you know it's different things going to be on but the end of all things is at hand and see if you truly believe that the end of all things are at hand amen then you make a proper preparation you're getting yourself ready come on now we know that the message of the hour it didn't come to make us good people it didn't come just so the sisters can have long hair and what skirts amen that's all fine and good amen that's what the word asks us to do but what the message came to do is get us ready for the second coming of almighty god it's come to prepare us amen and get us ready god sent a prophet amen to get our hearts turned into the right direction so the message didn't come just to make us good people but it's making us good people amen to move towards the rapture amen and if you're looking for a rapture then you've got to believe that in all things is at hand amen god sent a prophet to get the people out of the nominations amen because we were doing all kind of things nominations get the people back into the bible amen get them back into the word because christ is coming and the people needed to get ready how are we going to get ready unless he sent us a messenger to let us know exactly what we needed to be doing to get ready and here all along we think well we're doing this and that's allowing me to get ready but no he sends a messenger with a prophetic influence to let us know exactly what we need to be doing to get rid of it man and so us recognizing that we're getting ready amen and hopefully by now we're not just getting ready but we are ready glory to god i mean getting ready time is is widening up saints the bible is letting us know to end all things at hand and when peter wrote that amen surely things were moving so quickly at the time and then they thought christ was coming right then but no it was a a a a time period that things had to go through it man the prophet of god it meant brother branham in this day and age i mean he took us through how those seven church agents had to play out amen how god had to allow a portion of time for you to be here in the midst of 2020 in the midst of a pandemic in the midst of laid to see it going on all around us amen and maybe all through the ages that the saints will read the scriptures and say well they end all things at hand but no i can truly tell you this morning saints the end of all things is that ahead so we call us being endtime people we look at ourselves as a as being evening time people amen because we know time is winding up on the clock so so so what that does is it should put us in a certain sense of urgency it should always keep us in a certain sense of desperation and in a time period where where people are going to church less and we're comfortable at home watching things on the internet and maybe we're not reading our bible as much and but at the same time if we truly believe that the end of all things is at hand we should have that urgency about us you know some people might be sports fans of different things that man if you've got a team that you might like amen there's nothing worse than seeing that team it's the fourth quarter and they're not acting like it's the fourth quarter they're moseying around and they're dropping the ball and they're playing basketball he's taking his time bringing the ball up the court or the quarterback he not having to rush to snap the ball and different things if you know that the end of the game is coming all right you will move at a certain pace don't matter if you winning or not you still gonna have a certain pace about you and i'm here to remind you this morning since we are in the fourth quarter now is not the time to be dragging your feet all right now is not the time to be getting tired now is not the time to be distracted by the things of the world amen by the riches of the world amen man i've seen the political season come through it distracted so many people from the things of god now is the time to be focusing on the things that almighty god has for his people to enter all things is at hand you know if we believe at the end all things at hand then that means that almighty god has given us enough time to progress into a certain level of maturity spiritually that we know more babes that need the sense of milk or the gospel amen but if they end all things at hand then by the power of god preaching his word through his servants through pastors they've been through through wednesday's service they've been through sunday school on sunday mornings they mean we should be at a certain sense of maturity by now right we should have moved into our adoption amen that brother branham preached about all those years because when we talk about you being saved yeah that's one thing you believe amen almighty god takes care of you then the scriptures let you know how you receive the holy ghost since you believe praise god he put instills you with his power amen and now you got the ability to do things that you could not do on your own by the power of the holy ghost amen but you still have to come all the way into your adoption and that's a positional placing because all of us got a role within the body but once you come into your adoption you know exactly who you are you know exactly what you should be doing you know exactly what the father's business is and now you're not being laxed about the father's business but now you have developed to the point where you can run the father's business you develop to a point where where where your name being on the check is just as good as the father's name being on the check you develop to the point if you say so-and-so is hired then that means that they're hired and such such as fire that means that they're fired see the father even though you were a son all along he he held back a certain amount of responsibility but because you kept maturing now you had a certain level of responsibility and sometimes it seemed like we don't act like we should be at a certain level of responsibility when it comes to the things of almighty god still having to deal with little things amen still having to get our heart right for little things and hear the scripture letting us know that in all things is at hand we shouldn't still be saying well i'm gonna try to do better with that next time around now is the time to claim it that i am gonna do better with it by the grace of god amen hallelujah i'm gonna love the lord this morning just look at the scriptures this morning i'm not sure what time i started but we're not gonna be here long before you hallelujah amen not here to preach a love message to you but just to preach end time message to you because we need to be focused on the end time amen peter when he was writing out the scripture even he was writing out this epistle amen he said but the end of all things at hand be therefore the first thing he tells me is to be therefore sober be there for sober there's a lot of things that can cause you to be inebriated in this day and age of me to be drunk and people get drunk off of the things of life i mean people getting drunk by what their focus is and and getting drunk trying to make this amount of money or having this amount of carry man lord didn't call for us to be drunk off of the things of life amen if we're drunk off of anything we drunk off of this stimulation by revelation we're drunk off of this wine that almighty god has poured through the gospel amen that no matter what the enemy did he couldn't hurt not touch it amen praise god not to be inebriated by the things of the world amen but to be sober to be sober means that you're being alert you're looking at what's going on you're not getting mixed up by what's going on amen you're being vigilant hey man you're watching you're being short because you're not partaking in these things of the world that allows you to keep a laser light focused on the things that almighty god has for his people that's because you sober you know there's so much that that's going on that's starting to take people's eyes and minds off of the word of god and see we have to if you sober what will happen is you start to recognize the spirit behind different things and then when the world starts going through different things instead of you getting in a panic like the rest of the world you'll say you know what there's a spirit behind those things there's a spirit putting the world into a turmoil with different things hey man and yeah you got to recognize the the spirit that's that's moving amen because see what almighty god did for us people will tell you this morning the holy ghost does a lot of things for the people of god the holy ghost does a lot of things for the people of god what i like saying that court of god the holy ghost it does a lot of things for the people of god if you wish you wash and you need power guess what the holy ghost it'll give you power amen if you need a healing within your life amen the holy ghost will raise up your faith in man to claim your healing if you need to get right amen and stop doing little things that shouldn't be doing holy ghost to take care of that but you know one of the things that the holy ghost does for the people of god that we overlook sometimes is that the holy ghost it gives his people a spirit of discernment when i'm talking about a spirit of discernment amen that's you being able to look at something and not just see what's on the surface but you see the spirit that's that's pushing people in different directions people not upset and angry just to be upset and angry it's a spirit making people upset and angry amen and then you turn around now you got people that's angry at the ones that's angry man and now everybody's angry because it's spirits that's doing that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness high places amen and if you're sober you're watching what's going on you're not getting focused on the distraction well this one doing this and that one doing that what's going on with that no we're so reminded we're watching what's going on within the gospel because he said right there hey man why you being so baby he said be there for so baby man and watching not just watching just to know what's going on not just watching the news just to know what this person's doing that and this party wants this and that party want this and this candidate do that we're not just watching to watch for those things amen but we're watching a man onto prayer watching that god will keep his people in the midst of the stormy man watching the know what direction we need to be praying towards it man now your prayer in this day and age is god save america amen i'm gonna tell y'all now you you waste your time with that prayer if you're praying for lord put this candidate in office so he'll save the america for and take america back for god you you you missed the train all together i can show you in the book of revelation amen america's time is wide enough and then it's tied down in revelation 13 that's what brother brown showed us amen america had the opportunity and now it's all about god making sure that he has his wife ready without spot not blemish amen so if you're gonna pray towards anything in this hour say lord i pray that your bride or make herself ready because we got to get up out of here man i'm going to have to wear a mask for the rest of my life i i'm starting to realize you know i want to be able to go on different trips and do different things and i'm starting to realize you know the things that people took joy and within this world those things could be gone in the blink of an eye and there's got to be something greater that we're looking towards and i believe the lord allowed us to get shaken up a little bit because a lot of us were getting a little bit too comfortable with our nice cars and our nice houses and taking all of our trips and you can go on all these shopping discourages amen and all of a sudden those things get pulled away from you and you realize you don't got nothing to stand upon but the word of almighty god not but one thing that's certain and that is the power of the blood of jesus christ according to god amen people got mixed up they said if we put bond in office that'll make it more stable i beg your pardon they said well if we keep trumping office that'll make it more stable i beg your pardon there's not but one thing that can bring stability within your life hallelujah say that again there's not but one thing that will bring stability into your life there's nothing but jesus christ this morning hallelujah and it's good to know him amen he just said while you're watching be watching unto prayer amen y'all pray for one another as you see things going on pray for one another amen the ones that's out there working man i know y'all got a lot of saints here that work in the health care field they may pray for them even the different brothers had businesses and those businesses had to slow down because all that was going on y'all pray for one another pray for your past damn none of these pastors have have passed to the church doing a pandemic before we should be praying for one another the moms is at school at home and homeschooling the kids a minute maybe some had kids out in school and you had to bring them in amen y'all pray for the moms at home with them kids amen we ought to be praying one for another yeah our hearts and our minds in our conversation it should be more towards prayer because saints i'm here to tell you this morning prayer changes things hallelujah glory to god amen when they gave up on my father-in-law amen and they said well they call us at midnight so we're going to put them on the ventilator but you know it was people that was already praying amen and he got off that ventilator so quickly the doctors was amazed we said lord we need you to do a miracle and he did a miracle because prayer changes things and man when sister blue is in the midst of her battle amen in the doctors basically kind of said well we we we're not showing it but you know the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous the bible says that the veil of much amen and the lord uh because the lord has got the works of miracles amen because naturally it didn't look very good but god is still in the miracle working business he's praying scott he's still in the miracle working business so if you don't do nothing else pray for one another hallelujah and peter as he's saying those things he's saying i want you none of those things you've been sober as you've been watching and watching under prayer then he turned around and he said above all else have fervent charity among yourselves not just charity among yourselves fervent charity among yourselves and i told you that that a charity amen it talks about agape amen agape love divine love god's own love but the branham he had a vision we all familiar with he talks about it beyond the curtain of time and and and he came out of that vision and when he was uh was rehashing the vision to the people he man he was saying you know i'm convinced not more than ever that you're gonna need perfect love to be able to enter in over there man he had a vision of heaven and he was talking about uh oh my how the sisters were running up to him and how they could just hug him and there was no type of human sensation he was wondering what it was and he said a voice came down from heaven he said that this is perfect love and nothing can enter in here without it the prophet of god that we all follow amen that we believe that almighty god sent us amen as promised through the scripture through malachi 4 and 5 and he is saying that we won't be able to enter in without perfect love you know in a lot of ways love and when we talk about love it's a very elementary concept amen and i know we talk about a lot of mysteries and things but you know love is a very deep mystery and that the prophet is sitting here saying that without perfect love you won't be able to enter in what he's letting us know is that we can know the scripture frontlines and backwards we can know the quotes all kind of different ways we can come to the church every time the doors are open we can give all kind of money in church and if we have not reached the standpoint of perfect love we will not be able to enter in so now love comes from being a simple thing amen that's an elementary concept to it being a deep thing amen that you're not gonna be able to enter in without perfect love so if we can't get you to anything else in this hour i need to be getting you back towards perfect love cause you won't be able to enter in without it that's fervent charity amongst yourselves amen perfect charity you know the the christian experience what makes it a different type of experience from a lot of the other religions out there is when you talk about christianity you have to believe as an individual amen praise god you have to accept jesus christ as your personal savior you have to repent you have to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus for the remission of your sins so you got all these individual works that you're doing amen and then all of a sudden after you do all of those individual works then the bible lets us know because by one spirit we are baptized into one body so now all of a sudden your christian experience shows the individual experience amen that's how the gentiles had the cma man you have to see them individually compared to israel israel has set them as a nation the gentiles are settled individually but even in your gentile walk nevertheless you are part of a body so what happens is you got all of these individual works and all those individual works what it does it places you into a body amen and once you in the body you have to have perfect love that concept of a body amen it's a heavy concept amen by one spirit we baptize into one body amen and what happens is it takes the focus away from you as an individual what brother maurice could do or what brother so-and-so could do a man and what it does it puts the emphasis back onto the body because sometimes we get caught up in different things and the emphasis gets taken off for the body man i'm talking about the body of christ that all of us believers are part of but if we keep perfect love going amongst ourselves if we keep fervent charity amongst ourselves the focus and the mindset will always go back to the body you know the reason why these brothers ain't meant to dedicate their lives to preaching the gospel it's not so much for their sake amen glory to god hopefully it's not for their own gain or personal gain or whatever but it's because they want to see the health of the body they want to see the progress of the body amen we're doing these things for the benefit of the body of christ amen hopefully when we preach we all preaching the same thing because now we're showing you that there's order within the body and it don't matter if you take a preacher from green pond south carolina from north carolina from beautiful amen uh from uganda africa amen all over the globe we'll all be preaching the same thing by the grace of god because it's not about us it's about being part of a body amen hallelujah and almighty god has sent a ministry to keep the body in order and to keep the body alive so it takes the focus off of making it about us amen who got what revelation and who's spiritual well i'm the only one with this revelation no ain't about your revelation like daddy man it is but it isn't it's all about the body amen and that's why you need fervent charity man above all things have fervent charity among yourselves that word fervent that's an unusual word we don't use it very often so i had to look it up just to make sure i had to fully understand what that word fervent means fervent means that it's hot come on now it's not just dull it's not just moses alone fervent charity is hot it's intense it's enthusiastic sometimes it seems like people are no longer enthusiastic about the things of god they can get enthusiastic about other things i mean about your sports team about the political races going on about your garden and things they meant by these new clothes that you found on the internet amen let's get enthusiastic about the things almighty god let's get enthusiastic about our love towards one another amen i told you this is an end time message and peter's letting us know the end all things is at hand it's time for you to be hot in your love towards one another in an agape way man praise god intense enthusiastic passionate burning glowing those are all adjectives that you use to describe the word fervent amen see when the bible talks about this age that's all around us saving that age and laid to see how it's all around us remember the scripture refers to them as being a lukewarm age lukewarm age god has blessed us when we were able to come out of the lair to see amen but we see the influence all around us of that lukewarmness and the bible is letting us know in the midst of lukewarm being all around you know we talking about the church world now we're talking about the church world being lukewarm because the scripture lets us know that in the rest of the world they said the love of many will wax cold so you got the cold over here that's the world then you've got the church world that's the pentecostal church specifically amen the lay of the c.a.j man they're lukewarm but in the midst of them being cold over there and the nominal church being lukewarm god has called his people amen his bride his believers that he's cut out for his portion and set aside he's called for you to be fervent enthusiastic hot burning glowing for the things of god amen that's the example that he's called us to set forth with me now feeling your love for leo can go a long way man but you can't call that enthusiastic in this sense amen see the concept of agape love is such a deep and unusual concept uh you know it's hard for us to grasp it up front but you know your understanding of love and your standard of agape love it should grow more and more it should keep furthering itself it should keep developing itself amen even with a natural love you know uh when a young man finds a wife a man i see brother chris there with his wife amen he just you know when a young man finds i know they've been married for a while even but when a young man finds a wifey man you know he loves her man you know you might have seen different other women out there but there's something about this woman in there something about when i met sister tina she was different from any other woman i had ever met and it caught my attention i said you know what i think i love her and at that point in time i love her you know i didn't know if i could love any higher than that i just knew that i loved him it was nothing i ever felt or experienced before but you know with love it unfolds itself in different ways amen and as you spend more time together maybe uh your your wife maybe she bears a child for you man you start raising children together i mean now your love unfolds in a different way man maybe you might have a situation where you you get injured or you get hurt or you need something and now that spouse can take care of you amen so now that love is unfolding in a different way that you didn't have that opportunity for in the beginning amen maybe as you get older amen and you see your children and they have grandchildren all of a sudden you thought you loved your children and you did love your children but now that love is unfolding in a different way because different opportunities and different circumstances it allows more opportunity for love to unfold in a different way maybe y'all go through a hard financial difficulty and you see how the two y'all work together and y'all navigate that thing and you know you come out of it and say you're not always loving but you know i i i feel a higher level of love towards a now after i've come out of this thing that's because love it keeps unfolding really i'm gonna tell you this moment just like faith is a revelation perfect love is a revelation too amen and as different things take place amen and different things get revealed to you you'll find out that love keeps growing and so it is with the things of almighty god amen as you see him amen and when he saves you you love him in one way and then you see how he keeps you from a certain circumstance then you love him even more then you see him how he reveals himself to you by the power of his word then you love him even more man maybe somebody gets sick and then he he heals that person for you i mean you love him even more and then maybe you see what's going on in the world and how he's able to keep you from those things of the world and you see you know the lord if it wasn't for all your holy ghost i would have been right out there with the wrestling lord i see how much you love me amen and what he's doing he's given opportunities he he's given circumstances for the for the things of god to keep on fooling themselves because love is a revelation amen it's never stagnant it keeps growing it keeps moving hey man you should love your wife more today than you did 5 10 15 years ago because it keeps growing it it keeps moving by the grace of god you know one thing that that that's keeping me amen just as i see what almighty god is doing for the saints amen as i see him how he's kept all of these saints through all of these years and people are still on fire for god like it was in the beginning you know you know that's god and phone is love amen i appreciate that it man as he keeps us through all the storms i mean as he unfolds his love in that way man i appreciate that amen what we talking about we talking about agape man we talking about fervent agape man video love hey man feel the love it's all right amen but what fellow love does it works off of feelings feelings can be very wishy-washy up and down amen feelings can be back and forth you can't always trust your feelings when it comes to stuff hey you can trust your discernment but your feelings now you can feel one way and you can be totally opposite against the will of god because of your feelings amen so feelings and discernment are two totally different things feel your love it works off of feelings feel your love it works out for reasoning well this person is a good person so i guess i better love them because they're a good person and he got good shoulders and she got nice long pretty thick hair man feel your lover get you in trouble cause it works off of feelings and reasoning too much amen a god pay love it works off of revelation it's been revealed to me through the course of time how my god loves me it's been revealed to me through different circumstances and different situations how my god loves me man and one thing about a revelation saying whenever you get a revelation the almighty god has given you personally as an individual there's not a devil in hell that can rip that away from you that's your rock that's your revelation that's what god gave me and i'm not giving it back whatever almighty god reveals to you saints don't ever try to give it back a lot of people fall away because they never had a revelation to begin with but you know if you got your own rock that you standing on amen you might not be able to explain it you might not be able to explain to somebody else why you love so and so for such and such amen but the love of god amen if he's revealed himself to you you love him in a way you just can't explain to everybody else amen hallelujah that's a god they love him what happened too many people got filial love and agape love mixed up all of these years they man because a lot of times people think that they got a god for love and it's really feel your love amen people get tested and they feel this world got tested with his love just a few months ago all through the course this year and it failed the test in flying colors amen cause nobody else can put themselves in somebody else's shoes you know maybe if you somebody that lost the family member to the virus and different things you would say well you know maybe they should put on that maybe everybody should put on some masks because that's what you're looking at it from that's your point of view it man but then maybe if you somebody that you had a business that you poured your heart and your soul into and you dedicated your life to this business all your life savings was in it and just all of a sudden the virus come in and now all of a sudden you got to shut down but they're leaving walmart open and they're leaving lowe's open so that caused you to feel a certain way but this person over here well they lost a family member and what happens is because nobody got love for nobody else's situation everybody just sitting on the sides of the fence angry at each other but if we had love for one another maybe we could put ourselves in in my first cousin's shoes and my brother-in-law's shoes that lost his uh lost his mom a few weeks ago he made or maybe you could put yourselves in the shoes of that family that that lost everything that they had that had that good business that was going because things are booming things just looking good that dedicated their life to that thing but see it's hard for this human world to have that kind of love love got to be a revelation amen and talking about people race relations and people being upset with the police that's cause the world lost is loving man and people got angry man and one thing i i tell people all the time amen you know you might feel like well maybe my black life matters or white life matters or blue life matters but what i like to tell people is that your spiritual life matters your spiritual life matters and if i can get you to understand that your spiritual life matters then you're going to treat people a lot differently because you know people can be very evil that don't have the holy ghost now i'm saying tell you now people could be awful if they don't have the holy ghost man i've been done wrong by the police get out your car you've been drinking i don't i haven't been drinking well why are you driving so slow well i'm driving slow because the speed limit is a certain way and i know this is a speed trap well get out your car and they fussing and everything you know different things can happen there man people are evil man we we've had death threats our house and different things before with the little news and different things because people are evil you can't trust people without the holy ghost amen but one thing that i've learned amen and because god has put a certain amount of agape love into me amen so so those things are walking around making people better amen what those things cause me to do is is understand even one person that could change somebody's heart and that's numb but the man jesus christ say man we could march we could boycott we do all kinds of stuff ain't one person out there that can change hearts hallelujah how did i know he could change hearts because he changed my heart how do i know he could change hearts because he could change your heart amen if the world ever wanted an answer to the things that's going on in it it don't matter who you vote in or who you vote out but if you could elect jesus over your life in 2020 i promise you it will make all the difference in your life yesterday today and forever but what happened is distractions get people focused on other things where really we need to be getting back to the world of god amen to the word of god because the end of all things at hand you've got to have further charity one for another monster cells man and i understand that's not some something that everybody can attain because the prophet also shows us that love is a capstone revelation amen it's a simple concept but to move all the way to it eight minutes at the top of the parody you got to get through it through the holy spirit it's a capstone revelation and at the same time he told us we can't get where we're going without it even you know we have to show that forever agape man amongst ourselves and what happens is what you'll find out is that fervent agape love is not a weak love it's not a love of me and you buddy buddy today and then we fall out tomorrow amen but even how it says in first corinthians it man that love bears all things it believes all things hopes for all things endures all things amen that fervent charity understands shoulder to shoulder amen even at the end of this scripture it talks about how for charity for agape it should be able to cover the multitude of sins it makes me overlook your shortcomings and instead of me criticize you for your shortcomings i'ma pray for you man cause i'm supposed to be watching in the prayer man we can't get where we going without this capstone revelation man the prophet of god i mean he already told us that we won't be able to get in without amen what that perfect love does is it comes in it stabilizes you in a time where everybody is so unstable i mean in a time where where people are confused or maybe people are depressed and downtrodden amen what it's done is it provided us with some stability amen but brown he said when perfect love is coming to your heart all the demons in hell will never be able to upset it think about that now there's a lot of demons in hell but if perfect love is in your heart all the demons in hell won't be able to upset it now i'm not telling you about you getting upset over different things that go on in your life i mean show things have we human in me but i'm talking about that perfect love that you have in your heart one towards another i'm talking about that perfect love that you have in your heart towards the things of almighty god towards the things that's defending this message amen if you got it the right way it don't matter what the enemy tries to put against you you'll be able to stand in it amen and those things will never be able to upset what the kingdom of god has already established now is the time sinks for us to stay fervent with this message now is the time for us to stay enthusiastic with this message man it's time for us to be enthusiastic when it comes to the things of god amen fervent amen hot burning glowing we're not going back in the ladder to see it well it was a lukewarmness amen where people have a form of godliness but they're denying the power they help god has called these people to be fervently man hallelujah musicians y'all can come up this morning we ain't gonna be all morning amen the lord sent the example he said love one another as i have loved you that's a high example that's a heavy example but nevertheless the lord will never lay anything out that his people aren't able to walk into it man love one another as i have loved you amen that's our example amen and he said by this well all men know that you are my disciples now how well you know the seals book but that's very important inside you need to know what's going on amen but they'll know that you are one of his disciples if you can show love one for another but how you treat your fellow flock right here amen by how you treat the believers amen that's even at the different churches that's our love test and we want to make sure that we passing the love test man i'm gonna read a little piece too yeah the first corinthians 11 because it's hard to fully talk about amen it's basic scripture but at the same time first corinthians 13 i'm sorry amen it's basic scripture but at the same time you know sometimes we we have to look at those basic scriptures to remember exactly what we have amen first corinthians the 13th chapter in the first verse he said though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity man i become as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol i speak with tongues and if i don't have any love uh it's not much to me he said and though i have to get the prophecy of it and understand all mysteries now almighty god came through revelation 10 and 7 amen to reveal all these mysteries to us at the end time so i would think that somebody that has all understanding of all mysteries they've been and somebody that has the gift of prophecy i would esteem that person to be very high up on the totem pole because understanding all ministries is a very important thing but here the scripture says and though i had to give a prophecy and understand our mysteries and all knowledge and though i could have all faith so that i could remove mountains amen and i like that gift of faith for me hallelujah you get linked up to somebody that has a gift of faith y'all can go ask the way he's at and kick him off the problem that belongs to believers but nevertheless the scripture says you can have all of that amen and still not have love and it don't say that you halfway it says you are nothing all mysteries all my all knowledge all faith but no charity will make you nothing amen when you read on further down into the scripture a minute it talks about how it's going to get to a point amen and the eighth verse that says cherish he never failed if amen charity never faileth but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away but i'm here to tell you this morning saints you keep that very charity amongst yourself in the midst of the end time and that's what's going to carry you all away your walk is going to be different from the rest of this world your talk is going to be different from even the rest of the church world out there because god didn't just call you to any kind of love but he calls you to agape loving his hour and that's a divine love because we are divine people walking in maturity showing that we adopt the sons and daughters of god amen i'm gonna read this quote to you amen and then we'll turn over to brother jason man from beyond the curtain of time 1961 brother branham said he said i'm convinced i'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death oh god in a year where death been all around us death is finally defeated only supreme beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking come on the plane is rocking right now no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or the guns and the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love that's what he said even don't get caught up in the distraction saints these things do not matter the end of all things is at hand have fervent charity above all else have fervent charity amongst yourselves amen how many love the lord this morning according to god how many love one another this morning man how many want to be able to manifest that agape love one to another amen to your past amen to your brothers and sisters to your believers amen even when people meet you there they'll have to recognize that you're one of his disciples you're one of the disciples of christ because i recognize there's something different about you hallelujah glory to god this is about heads this morning father god in the name of jesus lord don't be just thankful lord for lord just a few moments in time lord just minister lord even love lord it could almost be like a sunday school topic father god but lord you called us lord to to manifest it more so even at the end time lord and lord we want to fully assure that we are end-time people lord we want to fully show that we are a fourth quarter people dear god that we're doing more and more for your kingdom and a time where everybody else is slowing down lord we thankful for lord the chance to be here before your people this morning there god lord we just asked the lord if there's things that that we're doing lord that's holding us back lord for better manifesting agape love dear god lord may we get those things right lord yes lord it's going home time lord we truly believe that the end of all things is at hand we could look at the scripture and we could see things matching up to let us know that the end of all things is truly at hand lord i pray for each and every believer that's here lord each one lord that's listening over to there's airwaves and sound waves and internet waves father god lord may you bless all of your bride lord universal lord oh may you add a blessing towards my pastor this morning lord and his wife their god you know all about them dear god and lord we've been knocking on your door father god on our behalf lord you've been blessing us lord you've been meeting our needs lord we thank you for that father god it's good to be able to trust in you in the lovely name of jesus christ at the same same amen hallelujah do you love him this morning amen praise the lord let's just stand give the lord a handclap of praise this morning by the grace of god hallelujah if things got you upset in this world don't worry this is still temporary yeah we're moving towards something else hallelujah time is filled with transition [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh more closely oh [Applause] this world's christian those things are very temporary oh [Applause] oh is is this morning hey [Music] hey [Applause] amen praise the lord amen praise the lord how many enjoyed the word of god today amen i i so enjoyed that i was thinking to myself that you know young people you know teenagers and even in your early 20s i know this from experience you you ha you have a hard time getting what i'm about to say but at the age i'm in now i realize that i'm racing time i'm racing time when you're young you you can't get that you could say it you could believe me but it's hard for you to really get that but at my age i realize i'm racing time and i got to make every minute count that's right i don't have time for any more uh inefficiency in my walk for the lord and then when i got thinking about that as brother maurice was ministering i thought you know something friends because of the age that we live in i'm here to tell you you're all racing time we're all racing time there is not much time left the world is falling apart and i thought about this brother maurice i thought that you know people who are um what would we say maybe uh i was even trying to figure out the best word people who are dispensers are people who spread uh agape love are the essential personnel wow they are the essential business that this world needs is people who are spreading [Music] agape love are the essential workers of today now you might think that that's just kind of you know a nice catchy thing to say but do you realize friends brother maurice was talking about the only thing that'll settle you and stabilize you is god's word is christ it won't matter about how you feel politically or how you feel socially or whatever education the only thing that will settle you and ground you and give you faith and give you courage is god's word because the whole world you know proof i was just reading a headline this morning brother maurice that that that in the island nation of japan they are like a go society i mean it's pedal to the metal it's in it's in their culture from earliest childhood you're taught to hit it and go hard all the time and when covid hit there and that island nation locked down and everybody had to stay home their suicide rate is several times higher than their coveted death rate covet death's rate are so many thousands in suicides from people suddenly they can't go anymore they have to stay home and they don't know what to do with themselves and they're literally checking out i think it was four or five times at a higher rate than covet is even killing people over there and i just thought wow when your life is that no wonder suddenly you don't have that anymore you can't cope i'm glad i got something that i can cope doesn't matter what comes our way the world is falling apart we have the coping mechanism amen and that is the word of god which is the life of god which gives us the love of god oh my how many want to be essential workers oh i thought what a statement brother maurice was making and encouraging us you know we ain't never been in a global pandemic so pray for these moms who are having to home school pray for pastors pray for pete preachers pray for the people pray for the workers because we've never been in this kind of a situation certainly not this late of an hour with the world falling apart amen praise the lord amen we're going to let you go how many enjoyed brother maurice today amen hey man praise the lord can't make it so long next time brother maurice i looked at my last notes i had on you it was in 2019. have you not been here this whole year i was here earlier in the year like right oh but i was out of town that's why i didn't have any notes on it okay i was looking back so praise the lord i so enjoyed that today so ain't no more going to be waiting that long we're going to have to do it on a little more regular basis amen praise the lord sister williams good to have you all and the kids wow good to have you all here today uh sister princess am i looking at you through that mass praise the lord sister god bless you happy to have her today amen happy to have all of you god bless you brother arvin sister martha happy to have you all here amen one big family of god aren't we amen let's sing some more that amen brother matthew hold to god's unchanging hand you can be dismissed in jesus name we'll we'll sing a little bit worship a little bit god bless you saints don't forget this wednesday night oh let me make an announcement dad stand by sister uh one of the things that we were going to do is next weekend we're going to have our little church get together we can't really call it a harvest fest because it just has the more the more we got into the logistics of trying to pull it off under the situation we're in it just became impossible we are hoping weather permitting to have a big thing here on the church grounds on saturday but uh we're gonna have you know we'll have all the food and all the fellowship the campfires and the games and the activities but uh it's still going to be way scaled down but we are going to have a lot of good time and so we want you to come hopefully whether we'll be permitting brother richie's going to come brother richie douglas good friend of mine i've wanted him to come for so long sat now we were going to have a friday night um and do a communion service have like a little abbreviated service and have a communion we can't do the foot washing because that's a little too close trying to do that in the fellowship hall and a little too close in proximity we're going to not do that right now but what we've decided to do is instead of doing that friday we're just going to have our regular wednesday night service this this week so on our regular wednesday night service brother richie won't be here myself for the matter i think jd won't be back in time yet myself or brother matt will take the wednesday service we'll abbreviate it a little bit and then have the lord supper at the end of that i've wanted to do that for a while and uh and then saturday brother richie will be the campfire preacher we'll have a we'll have our big campfire here we're gonna have to build it up big because it's gonna be cold amen and brother richie is going to uh maybe if the lord he we talked about it and if the lord is agreeable brother richie's going to you know give mainly just give his testimony and i'm here to tell you it is amazing it is powerful i'm hoping that every member of our senior youth will be there brother jason demars is going to take the younger the junior youth the class that he has in his home and he's going to go and have a different fire and he's going to do a little bible study with them at a different little campfire but we'll be out here gathered around as soon as it gets dark we're probably going to we're going to delay even probably we'll send out some announcements for the time frames probably somewhere around two to seven thirty two to eight uh and then we'll break and then brother rich he'll be back here sunday morning and then it'll be no holds barred we'll take all the restraints off of him and let him preach for us he is a wonderful brother um it's hard to describe brother richie if you've never met him but i promise you never meet anybody like him and you will like him he is adorable just a gigantic man but a teddy bear of a man who god has completely the lord wrecked his whole life he was like he was the he was a terror to the county where he lived i mean i think i think all law enforcement had a jubilee when the lord got a hold of his life i think they held a big church service just to praise the lord that that richie douglas gave his heart to the lord he was pretty rough so now you would never know you meet him now you would never know he had that kind of life so bring your teenagers bring your children and we're going to gather them around and hear brother richie pour his heart out at the campfire saturday but this wednesday we'll have kind of an abbreviated service and then the lord's supper so we haven't got to take that in quite a while and so make sure that you prepare your hearts for that amen all right i think that was all my announcements brother charles i'm going to send out an announcement when we have it all worked out and uh got to talk to the teams that are working on all that it looks like probably two to eight somewhere in that window to 2pm in the afternoon to maybe 8 o'clock that night so we are going to have all the different activities out there be plenty to do and fellowship and food and so we're looking for that then we'll have a campfire service as soon as it gets dark which don't take long it's dark what by 5 30 and so hopefully y'all be praying the lord has always given us a perfect weather and there's a little bit of a threat so we're gonna have to be praying now if we get to saturday and it ain't good weather i'm gonna know y'all didn't pray you'll say well no you didn't pray brother jason so we might all we're all under a little bit of pressure to get a hold of the lord and ask him for some good weather if not hey we'll bring it all in here we'll we'll eat under the canopy and in the fellowship paul we'll still have a good time we'll bring brother richie in here where it'll be warm and dry and let him give his testimony to us so we'll have a way to do it because it's here on the church grounds and that's kind of one of the advantages if you get rained out you just come inside so amen amen hold to god's unchanging hand god bless your friends we love you in the lord you're dismissed in jesus name saying brother hold to god's unchanging head [Music] oh build your hopes on things [Music] [Applause] [Music] time is filled with swift transitions [Music] can stand [Music] build your hopes all things [Music] rolled to god's unchanging hands [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] return [Applause] [Music] trust in [Music] whatsoever years maybe [Music] still more closely to him your hopes on things [Music] unchanging [Music] return [Music] changes [Music] [Music] okay [Music] that will never pass away [Music] [Applause] [Music] unchanging [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] [Music] you
