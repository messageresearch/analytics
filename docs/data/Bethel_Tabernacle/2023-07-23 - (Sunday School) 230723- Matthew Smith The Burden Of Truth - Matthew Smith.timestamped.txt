[0:00] morality is a necessary spring of
[0:02] popular government and human rights can
[0:04] only be assured among a virtuous people
[0:07] right
[0:09] so what's happened is
[0:12] around the mid-1800s
[0:15] is when this really started coming into
[0:17] effect though you didn't really see it
[0:19] really come into full force until 100
[0:21] years later
[0:22] the culmination of that
[0:25] would you had people
[0:27] operating politically under a framework
[0:29] of liberalism
[0:31] and morally under a framework of
[0:33] Christianity until the mid-1800s in
[0:35] which
[0:36] Christianity starts getting subverted by
[0:39] what I have heard called and I think
[0:42] it's a pretty good name for it of
[0:43] scientism
[0:44] right we believe in science science is
[0:48] the is the way to define truth
[0:51] well no science will tell you what the
[0:54] world is does not tell you what you
[0:55] ought to do with that world right
[0:58] liberal is you know politics can tell
[1:01] you that you are a free moral agent
[1:03] right you have the right to do what you
[1:04] want but it doesn't tell you what you
[1:05] ought to do with that freedom
[1:07] so
[1:15] what people have done is they've they've
[1:17] gotten a whole lot of freedom without
[1:18] any
[1:20] with no no
[1:24] more moral they don't know what to do
[1:26] with it anymore
[1:27] and because there's no there's no
[1:29] restriction on its Society has become
[1:32] the Pervert you know like I said it's a
[1:34] baby with a loaded pistol they don't
[1:35] know what they're doing you don't you
[1:38] know this is how when you when you strip
[1:40] all of the the moral what you ought to
[1:44] do right good Christian values you know
[1:47] uh uh the the law of God from people
[1:49] when you when people have no conscience
[1:52] no no
[1:54] um
[1:55] teaching on what's right and wrong
[1:56] nobody knows what to do this is how you
[1:59] get the same political framework that
[2:03] gave you
[2:04] the founding fathers
[2:06] will give you the people who marched
[2:09] down the street today
[2:11] you know talking about how you know
[2:14] we're here and we're queer and we're
[2:15] coming for your children
[2:17] it's the same liberal it's the same
[2:20] framework
[2:21] and
[2:24] or or I mean there's a whole there's a
[2:26] whole
[2:27] a whole uh you know we could spend a lot
[2:29] of time I don't want to get bogged down
[2:30] on you know how bad things are today and
[2:32] we can talk Ad nauseam on that the point
[2:35] is you all know where what time you're
[2:37] living in there's a lot of evil things
[2:39] that are happening and a lot of it is
[2:40] done under the under the the domain of
[2:43] well I'm a free American and I can do
[2:45] whatever I want
[2:47] fair enough
[2:48] but you should know better right if you
[2:51] were a Christian you'd know better
[2:55] and
[2:57] oh man I gotta
[3:00] so people people today they've developed
[3:02] a political system in which everybody's
[3:04] very free to do whatever they want
[3:08] but in doing so
[3:11] at the same time they've exchanged their
[3:14] morals
[3:15] for bondage for spiritual bondage
[3:18] right because you go to the average
[3:19] American and say ah
[3:21] you know you're a slave and they say we
[3:24] be sons of George Washington we've never
[3:26] been enslaved right
[3:29] it says uh yeah but
[3:32] are you sure about that right
[3:35] I wrote this as kind of like a little I
[3:37] don't know a parable or an allegory
[3:39] maybe says
[3:42] a slave to sin and depravity Works
[3:44] vigorously on the plantation of
[3:46] hedonistic pleasure
[3:48] the owner of the hellish estate has set
[3:50] over him three task Masters Mr eyes Mr
[3:54] flesh and Mr pride of life each drives
[3:56] the slave ever harder to harvest
[3:58] damnation with the lashing whips of lust
[4:01] and should this slave ever make his
[4:03] attempt at freedom and fail then the
[4:06] wrath of these cruel Masters is fierce
[4:08] indeed the blows rained down and burn
[4:11] the Flesh of The Wretched slave with the
[4:13] ever hotter flames of fiery passion to
[4:15] teach him the lesson of hopelessness
[4:18] and so you people like Oh I'm a free
[4:20] American okay Mr free American put down
[4:23] your booze and walk away and don't pick
[4:26] up alcohol ever again
[4:28] put down your pack of cigarettes or your
[4:30] vape and walk away and don't ever pick
[4:32] it up
[4:33] you know how many men are you are
[4:35] willing to say I'm free okay then walk
[4:39] away from porn
[4:40] you know how many how many people are
[4:43] okay I'm free I can do whatever I want
[4:45] okay stop gossiping stop backbiting drop
[4:48] your your hot temper
[4:49] you know don't you know your that
[4:52] bitterness that you won't let go of walk
[4:54] away from it try it once
[4:57] and when that thing comes around and
[4:58] whoops you and beats you into submission
[5:00] tell me how free you are of it
[5:04] right
[5:05] it's people are are
[5:09] are in bondage spiritually everywhere
[5:13] because there's no because because
[5:15] there's
[5:16] there is no there's no spiritual Liberty
[5:19] there
[5:20] is no spiritual freedom
[5:23] and so when
[5:25] when Jesus is saying
[5:28] the truth shall make you free
[5:31] that's what he's talking about right
[5:33] because
[5:36] and I I like the it's an interesting way
[5:39] he says this right Jesus said the truth
[5:41] shall make you free
[5:43] people always say that the truth will
[5:45] set you free
[5:46] and there's a and this might be a little
[5:49] bit you know getting lost in the exact
[5:51] verbiage Maybe
[5:52] but I think that it's important to think
[5:55] about it in the way that the truth will
[5:56] make you free right because if you bear
[5:59] the if you if if you are made free you
[6:02] now bear the burden of responsibility
[6:03] you have a responsibility to do with
[6:06] that freedom the right thing right
[6:08] and if you are if oftentimes people
[6:12] don't actually want freedom right
[6:15] in the book of Exodus
[6:16] um pull up uh if you wouldn't mind uh
[6:21] pull up Exodus 21 verse 1.
[6:32] you know yeah okay it says
[6:36] now these are the judgments which Thou
[6:38] shalt set before in verse two
[6:41] um yeah if they'll buy a Hebrew servant
[6:44] six years He Shall Serve and in the
[6:46] seventh he shall go out free for nothing
[6:50] if he came in by himself he shall go out
[6:52] by himself if he were married then his
[6:55] wife shall go out with him
[6:57] if his master have given him a wife and
[7:01] she have borne him Sons or daughters the
[7:04] wife and her children shall be her
[7:06] Masters and he shall go out himself
[7:10] and if a servant shall plainly say I
[7:12] love my master my wife and my children I
[7:15] will not go out free
[7:17] then his master shall bring him unto the
[7:20] judges he shall also bring him to the
[7:22] door or unto the doorpost and his master
[7:24] shall bore his ear through with an awl
[7:26] and he shall serve him forever
[7:30] so here's a situation in which you hear
[7:33] there's a Slave
[7:34] who
[7:36] really enjoys the lifestyle
[7:39] that his master has given him
[7:42] right
[7:43] he's got a family he's got maybe a nice
[7:45] job maybe he's not it's not too rough
[7:47] working here he's got plenty of food you
[7:50] know he's got a good he's got a good
[7:52] setup here he doesn't want to go out and
[7:55] live on his own and have to be the
[7:58] master of his own destiny
[7:59] right doesn't want to have to be the one
[8:01] who has to go out there and and and be
[8:04] responsible for what happens to him
[8:05] because as long as he's a slave
[8:07] something bad happens is really not his
[8:09] fault right it's the guy who was in
[8:11] charge's Fault
[8:13] so people will happily
[8:16] allow them like this is a reason why
[8:18] somebody might not want necessarily want
[8:20] freedom
[8:22] a lot of times people will
[8:25] they'll have some Vice
[8:28] they'll have some thing that they are
[8:30] that they are
[8:31] a slave to spiritually and they don't
[8:34] really want the responsibility that
[8:38] comes with freedom from that thing
[8:42] right they don't really want
[8:45] they don't they kind of like that demon
[8:49] that they've got right it just feels
[8:51] really nice right they like they like it
[8:54] now they might consciously yeah okay I
[8:57] can't you know I it's a bad thing I
[8:59] should do something about it yeah but
[9:00] you're not trying
[9:01] you know you're not you're not
[9:03] you don't really want free of it do you
[9:06] you know
[9:07] but the reality is
[9:09] when you come in contact this is why
[9:11] this is why the truth makes you free
[9:15] right
[9:16] oftentimes
[9:19] it's making you free because I feel like
[9:21] if you say it sets you free
[9:23] well that kind of implies a choice
[9:25] doesn't it
[9:27] but
[9:28] oftentimes the you know when you when
[9:32] you come in in contact with the truth
[9:35] right
[9:37] because if we read that again
[9:40] you know Jesus said that he was the
[9:42] truth the way in the life right
[9:44] you know we've so often said that you
[9:46] know when pilate asks Jesus what is
[9:48] truth and Jesus you know that's the
[9:50] wrong question to ask right it's who is
[9:52] truth
[9:53] because Jesus said in that in in John
[9:55] chapter 8 where we read
[9:57] he says
[9:59] um
[10:04] yeah it says in in verse 32 and he says
[10:06] and you shall know the truth and the
[10:07] truth shall make you free
[10:11] but then in verse 36 says if the son
[10:14] therefore shall make you free you should
[10:16] be free indeed so here's Jesus in his
[10:18] right there there saying implying that
[10:21] it is him the truth that will make you
[10:23] free is Jesus himself
[10:25] right
[10:27] so
[10:29] there's not a really what where people
[10:33] are um
[10:37] where people are
[10:40] get
[10:42] hung up
[10:44] in their in these situations where you
[10:47] you know people can't get out of it
[10:48] it's showing that really you know the
[10:52] solution so oftentimes people turn to
[10:56] all kinds of different different
[10:57] solutions right you know we want to
[10:59] analyze ourselves and make it oh well
[11:01] this you know maybe maybe I am the way
[11:03] that I am because of this or have some
[11:05] sort of psychological explanation or a
[11:07] medical explanation or whatever and
[11:09] that's not necessarily against that
[11:11] but really
[11:14] when people are are bound on up on
[11:16] things that they can't get rid of that
[11:18] they can't let go of that they can't and
[11:20] again I don't want to just make this as
[11:22] some sort of like addiction or a vice it
[11:24] could be anything I mean it could be
[11:25] bitterness or anger or a grudge that
[11:28] they can't let go of you know I mean
[11:31] this this happens people end up a slave
[11:34] to their own hurts
[11:35] and their own where people did them
[11:38] wrong
[11:40] well
[11:41] the reality is we can try to fix this on
[11:44] some sort of psychological level but but
[11:47] really the the the freedom from that is
[11:51] going to come through close the closer
[11:52] you get to God himself right the closer
[11:55] you get to the Lord Jesus the closer
[11:57] you're going to get to freedom because
[11:58] he is the he is the actual path to
[12:01] Freedom you know whatever whatever that
[12:03] solution may be God can fix it right
[12:05] whatever whatever your problem is God
[12:07] can can resolve that
[12:09] a relationship with the Lord
[12:13] is always going to bring freedom from
[12:16] things
[12:17] and it's going to make you free and it's
[12:19] him doing the make it's him making right
[12:21] it's not it's not you being allowed to
[12:23] be free and walking away it is Christ
[12:26] coming in and breaking that thing away
[12:29] and and making you free right it's his
[12:32] work not yours
[12:34] and um man I gotta I think I'm gonna
[12:37] wrap it up about right there and I don't
[12:40] want to steal too much time from the
[12:41] song leader I am the song leader of
[12:45] uh so we'll we'll stand and I'll wrap it
[12:48] up there and uh I'll try to pick this up
[12:51] at a later date
[12:53] it's about our hearts
[12:56] Lord father thank you for this
[12:57] opportunity to maybe say something that
[12:59] would help the people
[13:01] Laura asked that it would
[13:04] whatever with my my
[13:07] broken speaking would
[13:09] maybe be exactly what somebody would
[13:12] have needed to hear father not through
[13:13] anything that I could have done but
[13:14] because you would take the words and
[13:16] make them fall where they would need to
[13:18] fall
[13:20] so Lord that I ask that you would go
[13:22] with the people father that you would
[13:24] anoint our service going forward be with
[13:26] us throughout the song service be with
[13:28] us
[13:29] father you would hear our praise and our
[13:31] worship that we'd have the opportunity
[13:33] to praise your name and tell you how
[13:35] much we love you that you would be
[13:36] pleased to come down and speak to our
[13:38] hearts in the greatest form of worship
[13:40] which is the hearing of your word
[13:42] we asked these things in the holy and
[13:44] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:45] amen
