[1:03:08] oh they don't go straight to the words
[1:03:11] uh let's open our Bibles in the Book of
[1:03:14] John chapter 11.
[1:03:19] chapter 11 John chapter 11 John chapter
[1:03:22] owns verse 17 to 28.
[1:03:27] you just said he said I've been tweet
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:34] John chapter 11 verse
[1:03:36] 17 to 28.
[1:03:46] it's my first time to see some of y'all
[1:03:49] since the year started so I wanted to
[1:03:51] wish you a happy New Year
[1:03:57] it's my first time to see some of you
[1:03:59] know some of you since the year started
[1:04:01] oh says
[1:04:04] so I wanted to wish everybody Happy New
[1:04:07] Year
[1:04:09] I hope this new year had a great start
[1:04:12] because
[1:04:16] uh John chapter 11 verse 17-28
[1:04:20] Joshua Pittsburgh
[1:04:22] it's a familiar uh story of the Bible
[1:04:26] says
[1:04:28] either you've been to a Sunday school or
[1:04:31] you know
[1:04:33] okay
[1:04:34] or in normal church we have heard about
[1:04:37] the The Story of Lazarus
[1:04:42] amen so we'll be talking about this uh
[1:04:45] for a while today
[1:04:49] we will see where God will lead us
[1:04:53] amen John chapter 11 verse 17 to 28.
[1:04:59] the Bible says that when Jesus came he
[1:05:03] found that he had Lane in the grave four
[1:05:05] days already
[1:05:07] foreign
[1:05:18] about 15 furlongs off
[1:05:21] economy is
[1:05:26] and many of the Jews came to Martha and
[1:05:30] Mary to comfort them concerning their
[1:05:32] brother
[1:05:38] amen because here Lazarus was already
[1:05:41] dead
[1:05:42] now verse 20 the Bible says then Martha
[1:05:45] as soon as she heard that Jesus was
[1:05:47] coming went and met him but Mary sat
[1:05:51] still in the house
[1:05:55] applications
[1:06:01] then said Martin unto Jesus Lord if thou
[1:06:05] has been here my brother had not died
[1:06:13] but I know that even now whatsoever that
[1:06:16] will ask of God God will give a day
[1:06:24] Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[1:06:27] rise again
[1:06:30] says unto him I know that that he shall
[1:06:34] rise again in the resurrection of the of
[1:06:36] the last day
[1:06:41] Resurrection
[1:06:42] amen so here if you understand you'll
[1:06:45] see that Jesus was talking about the
[1:06:47] present time
[1:06:50] but Martha thought that Jesus was
[1:06:53] talking about first Thessalonians
[1:06:59] amen verse 25 Jesus said unto her I am
[1:07:03] to Resurrection I am the life
[1:07:05] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:07:08] dead yet shall he leave verse 7
[1:07:13] resurrection
[1:07:17] and whatsoever and whosoever liveth and
[1:07:22] believeth in me shall never die leave us
[1:07:26] doubt this
[1:07:27] is
[1:07:33] she said she's the Bible says that she
[1:07:35] saith unto him yeah Lord I believe that
[1:07:38] thou art Christ the Christ the son of
[1:07:40] God which shall come into the world
[1:07:49] and when she had said so
[1:07:52] she went her way and called Mary her
[1:07:55] sister secretly saying the master is
[1:07:57] come and call it 40. verse 7 to it
[1:08:01] is

[1:10:18] paragraph
[1:10:20] that the resurrection is not simply an
[1:10:23] event okay
[1:10:26] but the resurrection is a person
[1:10:30] and that person is the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:11:23] amen because we know that there is only
[1:11:25] one God that we believe
[1:11:29] who manifested himself in different
[1:11:33] attributes he said Manifesto remember
[1:11:36] he's the God the father he is the god
[1:11:38] the son and he is
[1:11:42] all one God
[1:11:45] Amen we don't believe that there are
[1:11:47] three persons in Christ or In God
[1:11:51] We believe that the father is the son
[1:11:54] the son
[1:11:56] official Center Street amen it's all one
[1:11:59] God you know manifesting himself in
[1:12:02] different attributes individuals
[1:12:06] amen so the Bible tells us that God
[1:12:09] promises us to promise to reveal him to
[1:12:11] reveal himself under three sons
[1:12:16] and my first thing he had to reveal
[1:12:20] himself as the son of man
[1:12:21] therefore it was a very common remember
[1:12:24] then he has to reveal himself again as a
[1:12:27] Son of God
[1:12:30] then in the Millennium he will reveal
[1:12:32] himself as the son of David yeah
[1:12:36] the prophet said that the son of man the
[1:12:39] prophet amen is also what we call the
[1:12:42] logos
[1:12:44] amen is that that created the entire
[1:12:47] universe
[1:12:50] because if you go to Revelation chapter
[1:12:53] four
[1:12:55] John's testified and said that
[1:12:57] everything was created by Him and
[1:12:59] foreign
[1:13:21] amen because he said that he saw one
[1:13:24] person sitting on the throne
[1:13:27] and then the the rainbow the bow was all
[1:13:32] around the throne
[1:13:36] amen and he was the son of man who was
[1:13:39] he was the son of David or it was God
[1:13:41] himself the son who was sitting on that
[1:13:43] Throne he said remember
[1:13:46] it was Jesus Christ was on that throne
[1:13:50] even he who was the pill of fire that
[1:13:53] created everything
[1:13:55] amen he who was the pill of fire that
[1:13:58] appeared to Paul
[1:14:01] amen he's the pillow fire that appeared
[1:14:04] to brother Branham
[1:14:07] and he's the pill of fire that began
[1:14:10] since the beginning of time
[1:14:13] so that same Son of God that same God
[1:14:17] had to manifest himself as his son
[1:14:20] remembers University
[1:14:22] amen because a son of man can be touched
[1:14:25] the alarm
[1:14:30] we see Jesus Christ
[1:14:32] amen he lived with us amen he walked
[1:14:37] with us amen he ate with us amen he
[1:14:41] fellowship with us
[1:14:42] people were able to see him
[1:14:46] people were able to talk to him
[1:14:49] amen so but God is the spirit
[1:14:53] so that's why Jesus couldn't be the Son
[1:14:56] of God
[1:14:59] because God is a spirit
[1:15:02] amen the spirit you cannot see a spirit
[1:15:05] amen so that's why he promised to reveal
[1:15:08] himself as the Son of God
[1:15:11] remember the Son of God which is the
[1:15:14] holy spirit
[1:15:16] so Jesus the son of man had to die first
[1:15:19] Allah
[1:15:21] Amen to give away to the Son of God
[1:15:24] which is the holy spirit
[1:15:28] amen because it says that uh uh that I
[1:15:31] am with I will be with you even in you
[1:15:36] amen he was with us as a son of man
[1:15:40] and he will be a nurse as the Son of God
[1:15:44] leading us and making us do the same
[1:15:47] work that he did
[1:15:49] remember amen so he promised that after
[1:15:53] that it will come as the son of David
[1:15:55] Allah
[1:15:58] the prophet comes and tells us that
[1:16:00] between the Son of God and the son of
[1:16:02] David and the prophet
[1:16:05] uh
[1:16:08] he has to come back again as a son of
[1:16:11] man
[1:16:13] because it's first coming past question
[1:16:16] amen was only for the Jews
[1:16:19] amen he wasn't for the Gentiles
[1:16:57] to reign
[1:16:59] to reign as king too
[1:17:03] so now the prophet here says in the
[1:17:06] message is is uh is it is the rising of
[1:17:09] the sun
[1:17:13] amen he said that and to be with again
[1:17:15] we realize in the last day
[1:17:19] according to Luke chapter 17 30.
[1:17:23] in the sun day again say
[1:17:30] in the day that the son of man will be
[1:17:33] revealed
[1:17:36] or waved again over the people who says
[1:17:40] now the prophet asks the question now
[1:17:42] who is the son of man the man like
[1:17:46] the prophet says that in the beginning
[1:17:48] was the word the prophet
[1:17:50] and the Word was with God
[1:17:53] and the Word was God
[1:17:56] and the Word was made flesh
[1:17:59] and dwelt Among Us
[1:18:02] and if all the teaching that we have
[1:18:05] heard that we that we have a two seasons
[1:18:07] and confirmation of the word of God
[1:18:12] by word of God
[1:18:14] by Signs by wonders
[1:18:17] we see today that in the Book of Luke
[1:18:20] here
[1:18:25] Luke chapter 17 the 17th
[1:18:35] and the different scriptures that we are
[1:18:38] acquainted with a daughter difference
[1:18:41] that that word again is waved over the
[1:18:45] people yes
[1:18:49] the Dead traditions of men is dead
[1:18:54] tradition
[1:18:55] and the Son of God is alive again with
[1:18:59] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:04] and he's giving us life
[1:19:07] amen the son of man
[1:19:09] amen those the word made flesh
[1:19:14] dwelt Among Us
[1:19:16] amen so we see in the Bible
[1:19:19] they are
