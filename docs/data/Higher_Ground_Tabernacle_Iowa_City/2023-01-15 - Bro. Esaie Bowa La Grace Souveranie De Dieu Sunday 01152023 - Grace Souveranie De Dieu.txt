the prey it's empty problem you see I'm struggling a little bit I think it's gonna be okay open our bubbles in a car because in Malachi chapter first chapter where we read last time see and it says [Music] the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi Japanese you have been loved by me says the Lord but you said why would you love where was your love for us is Jacob's brother says the Lord but Jacob was loved by me you did in solitude and I sent destruction on his mountains and gave his Heritage to the Beast of the Wasteland because we're going to add uh Ephesians chapter one verse from verse three to seven years praise be the god enough and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has given us every blessing of spirit in the heavens in Christ the foundation demand foreign from the first so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love as we were designed before him before by him for the position of sons to himself through Jesus Christ in the good pleasure of his purpose to the praise of Glory of this Grace which he freely gave to us in the loved ones in whom we have salvation through his blood the Forgiveness of our sins through the wealth of his grace foreign foreign I would like to add a little bit for from what we learned last time this morning I went to God I wanted to bring something else but my spirit wasn't going well with water prepared this is bringing me back to what I speak and we're going to add a little bit then we're going to dismiss to show that this scripture was exposure Andrew came some purple show us a God that loves his people that give us his grace and who's uh sovereign Abraham wasn't even called by his own words it was God's will sovereign he says he has predestinated to be his children of adopted children by Jesus Christ according to his own purpose so that's God that doesn't need uh somebody's Wheels we go back to his own ways to give of his grace we may further sir yes brothers and sisters if it doesn't need you need you to love you hello foreign foreign Jacob and I hate it is before or even thinking about good and uh bad sure I think an election God has made elections I love Jacob and I hate it even before one neither one of them did anything else that's why I say our works doesn't do anything is we always work with the grace of God look chairman that is in us I chose you and I establish you profit what did Jeremiah Google [Music] it was by his grace that did anything that doesn't depend to live to the one who run out who the ones to whom he wants to give our mercies it does not uh it depends on prediction it depends on the grace of God Allah [Music] didn't want to be anointed foreign overhead issue he can take you out of him that's how God works in the demand foreign about it so for that time fall man I want 24. yeah it shows like a journal done that things that God without even a spring everything that we hold from yeah to pass David we have proof with that is sovereign
