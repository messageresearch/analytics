foreign who are they worshiping if you have to come out because I'm preaching it I'm trying to tell you we must be more sincere we must be more consecrated hallelujah amen you asked me that you wonder why I asked that question because the Bible said the only way the worship God is in spirit and in truth we know that the rainfall on the Justice that's why we ought to thank God for elections how

intellectual messages how can you gonna tell me what I didn't see how much people myself anything about it I wasn't the only one that allocation I think it looks silica there was only 300 people in that tent that saw the pillar of fire Hallelujah listen people because of this message or this revealed word I've seen the dead raised twice I've seen cancel you can't tell me what it can't do it we

to see yourself the devil said you ain't nothing look look look but you see a few months ago you didn't see that about yourself that means you're getting closer to you is that right it's like a room if you cut a light on you might not be able to see what you're looking for thank you [Music] what everybody else is doing five seconds amen I'm screaming but let me say it like this so many people in this message I just dance when I came to this message I know never had a desire to worship brother Brandon ever I I just I said like this I was one of the brothers at my church anyway this man said
