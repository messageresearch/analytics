[58:32] remarkable truths for us say let's
[58:34] assemble God divinity and the Holy
[58:38] Spirit broke up the symbol of the lamb a
[58:41] little assembled Illinois and the lamb
[58:44] has from the beginning of Bible to the
[58:47] end very important in your police from
[58:53] the very beginning when man sinned
[58:55] dearly they become normal baby shaver
[58:57] clothes the lambskins
[58:59] is it
[59:01] Abel offered a palermo supplied the
[59:07] blood of the Lamb the prophets war lambs
[59:16] and how Jesus was identified as a lion a
[59:20] human with it and feel calm and anew and
[59:22] how Jesus was identified by shepherds
[59:26] come my little ant if he remembers you
[59:28] because God is revealing himself in the
[59:32] nature of a lion that alanna children on
[59:34] you only God can be revealed in such
[59:37] great ways to reveal a decision that God
[59:41] would identify himself of incidents fury
[59:44] man with an earthly animal with the
[59:48] nature of a liar in not to tell you why
[59:51] the nature of a lion because the lamb is
[59:55] the meekest of all creatures of the
[59:57] earth
[59:57] I know silly presumably duplicate you it
[1:00:00] is humble sweet it is dependent upon the
[1:00:10] Potter Shepherd the pundit cannot lead
[1:00:14] itself first ever Shepherd God
[1:00:19] identifies himself Jesse didn't feel
[1:00:22] that's why John the Baptist simple
[1:00:25] question only said behold the lamb you
[1:00:27] give what seal on your Lamb of God I
[1:00:29] knew it is you that taketh away the sin
[1:00:31] of the world
[1:00:32] you ought to let me share this amount
[1:00:33] and then we see another type of the Holy
[1:00:37] Spirit's God identifies himself us
[1:00:40] identify remember as a dove
[1:00:44] the lamb is the meekest of all earthly
[1:00:46] creature I knew simply do the to listen

[1:03:51] messenger but the Dove brings tidings
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:05] when he said this is my beloved son God
[1:04:10] was looking for something
[1:04:12] I love juicy cases I was so nature
[1:04:15] discipline at you something that he
[1:04:17] could love me because the Deaf make sure
[1:04:21] it's a lover brother branham said did
[1:04:25] you ever go in the morning and hear the
[1:04:28] doves cooing early morning something
[1:04:32] sacred about it there's something sweet
[1:04:36] about it and he said God wants to make
[1:04:39] love with human beings he's looking for
[1:04:44] something lovable he's shaken to show
[1:04:47] something that he can relate to like not
[1:04:50] sure the professor of what God founded
[1:04:53] in Christ and God so loved the world
[1:04:58] that He gave His only begotten Son he
[1:05:03] could fellowship with it he could relate
[1:05:06] to it because God's nature masculinity
[1:05:11] and Christ nature was the same he could
[1:05:15] unite with because it was the same
[1:05:18] brother branham said if it was a wolf
[1:05:21] nature for bottom indicates a tail on a
[1:05:23] children that Holy Spirit never woulda
[1:05:25] came to do solemly passive position
[1:05:31] because there are two different natures
[1:05:35] if you were proud honesty if you were
[1:05:38] critical civility if you were hateful
[1:05:41] see who's up here a lot of equity covers
[1:05:43] a VA lehand the Spirit of God could
[1:05:46] never come to it the Sun woo
[1:05:49] but Jesus was a man of proofed of God
[1:05:54] his voice was not heard in the streets
[1:05:57] of war movies upon the neighbors meek
[1:06:00] he was full of love you need a plan to
[1:06:03] move it was the expression of God's love
[1:06:07] John the Baptist was a roaring lion
[1:06:10] gambatesa T and you but Jesus didn't
[1:06:14] operate he didn't preach like a lion as
[1:06:18] she come he moved in humble Authority in
[1:06:21] my share but the Rams are great things
[1:06:25] or quiet things the gun show Sunday
[1:06:28] shows up economy there's a lot of blood
[1:06:30] for a lot of boasts in the world ya
[1:06:32] beaucoup de Xiang Kiki they don't keep
[1:06:34] Boston but Jesus packed something real
[1:06:37] mention see a vehicle cash was there al
[1:06:39] on me and Jesus revealed the very heart
[1:06:42] of God in a very low girl ma'am did you
[1:06:45] this was mystery God was revealing if a
[1:06:49] person wants the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:06:53] Spirit will only come to a niche like

[1:07:09] conquer him Perihan but jesus had a
[1:07:12] different weapon he humbled himself he
[1:07:17] said lower than the Angels because there
[1:07:25] is a power in humility availabe saucy
[1:07:28] Ella personal ability there is the
[1:07:31] secret here in secret that the power of
[1:07:33] God is revealed in a man or a woman that
[1:07:38] can hammer themselves mediator Jesus was
[1:07:42] humble
[1:07:44] but he was stern man unity oh he could
[1:07:47] separate right from wrong there
[1:07:49] oh he can rip out the unbelievers
[1:07:53] the church a special deal isn't quietly
[1:07:56] degrees but there was a love that the
[1:07:58] world had never seen a la dilamuca

[1:22:09] time but you will see kid I sent her to
[1:22:12] the moon a bunch of Aviva so incredible
[1:22:15] was this prophecy when my incredibly
[1:22:17] says that Baxter said brother branham
[1:22:19] are you sure he's on my side Monday s
[1:22:21] get you mr. Branum said I didn't say
[1:22:24] that he said he said God said that he

[1:22:30] completely healed my brother branham
[1:22:34] said her testimony up and up the way of
[1:22:39] Africa that started the revival of
[1:22:43] shimmer and a freak and those were some
[1:22:46] of the greatest meetings that were ever
[1:22:48] had on the face of the earth is greater
[1:22:53] than Pentecost
[1:22:56] why because God sent his message
[1:23:00] soonish time on the wings of a dove
[1:23:05] god help me we can't live without we
[1:23:14] needed have you ever noticed the nature
[1:23:18] of brother branham's meetings
[1:23:23] his campaigns were so different than the
[1:23:28] prosperity meetings the glamour and all
[1:23:35] the pomp
[1:23:37] brother branham operated in humble
[1:23:40] Authority oportunity before the services
[1:23:46] began oh he's come he would give
[1:23:48] instruction services how to approach God
[1:23:53] he would teach them that the Holy Spirit
[1:23:55] is very very timid brother branham
[1:24:01] strive to create an atmosphere of
[1:24:05] reverence it was not an environment of
[1:24:13] excitement fear but it was actually
[1:24:25] humility and dependence now he'd say be
[1:24:32] real reverence because the Holy Spirit
[1:24:36] is very timid muscular said to me and he
[1:24:40] said it'll leave like this brother
[1:24:46] Benham said now don't get excited this
[1:24:49] way but those who say belief make ye
[1:24:52] believed ye isn't that wonderful there's
[1:24:57] so many in those Pentecostal ranks
[1:25:00] woodwork the people this was beyond
[1:25:04] emotion he was dealing with the faith of
[1:25:07] the beat up by the motion see what the
[1:25:11] four
[1:25:12] message that turns our hearts our main
[1:25:15] suspect okay it is the dog that is
[1:25:17] leading our hearts Carlo Menotti no Kuni
[1:25:20] and the results of brother branham's
[1:25:22] meetings could not be compared to
[1:25:27] anything nearby a toy company or chose
[1:25:30] the closest thing you could find is the
[1:25:34] very Ministry of Jesus Christ himself
[1:25:36] sake is just two of us in ministers just
[1:25:38] accused to remember and I want you to
[1:25:40] notice the Azusa revival the birth of
[1:25:46] that revival beautifully was sold under
[1:25:50] the power of the Holy Spirit it did a
[1:25:52] muscle if you want a sentence that
[1:25:55] people would get saved
[1:25:56] even before the preacher got to the Pope
[1:25:58] unless they were just caught up in the
[1:26:03] glory of God but brother Branham
[1:26:07] recognized something has changed in the
[1:26:12] revival issues I mentioned anyway he
[1:26:14] noticed the nature of the Pentecostals
[1:26:17] change very monkeyland activity particle
[1:26:21] emissions they went on calling
[1:26:22] themselves para Costas impurity
[1:26:26] particles they went on singing the same
[1:26:28] song dimension reaching the same text
[1:26:32] but the nature from the nature they
[1:26:38] began with Sousa
[1:26:42] and the Prophet identified the nature
[1:26:46] was wrong something was wrong can you
[1:26:51] say man he said now you become a
[1:26:54] cut-and-dried program and the Lord
[1:27:00] revealed to brother Branham exactly what
[1:27:05] the problem was secretary problem making
[1:27:08] your valley ditches for niches
[1:27:12] brother branham said the other night
[1:27:14] when I was coming over here a few nights
[1:27:16] ago the Lord met me in the room some in
[1:27:24] a vision
[1:27:26] here's what's a matter with the church
[1:27:30] they got so much selfishness everywhere
[1:27:36] has so much difference simply fighting
[1:28:11] this is what happened to the Pentecostal
[1:28:14] revival
[1:28:18] he said we're supposed to be he said the
[1:28:30] first snow of the war the Holy Spirit
[1:28:34] could not stand at a snarl brother
[1:28:42] Burnham said now this is what has
[1:28:44] happened by vision he saw this church in
[1:28:48] its condition you get it he's giving a
[1:28:56] vision to the church this is the key to
[1:29:01] the Holy Spirit now I'm talking to the
[1:29:06] brim he said that's what's a matter
[1:29:12] around here let me see that's what makes
[1:29:15] the dev take its flies a secular
[1:29:18] community
[1:29:19] he said just let somebody start a little
[1:29:21] something around the church right then
[1:29:25] the Holy Ghost flies away as long as
[1:29:31] that lamb nature leaves you the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost just gone or sealant a cassette on
[1:29:36] your V listen test and that's what's the
[1:29:39] matter with
[1:29:41] that's the reason the people are in the
[1:29:44] condition that they're in the wrong
[1:29:49] spirit has come into their heart and
[1:29:51] life we must be peaceful
[1:29:56] we must be he said that's why we don't
[1:30:00] have victory we have become starchy and
[1:30:06] we don't allow the Dove and have
[1:30:08] preeminent power sentence bit of what a
[1:30:11] preemie now soon has anyone ever heard
[1:30:13] of Dawson Riley a Buddhist you probably
[1:30:15] did that's unlike also Riley was a lion
[1:30:18] hunter out west that's not really a lion
[1:30:21] see hundred lions brother branham loved
[1:30:26] him but at that time he was not a
[1:30:29] Christian man said upon occasion and and
[1:30:32] brother Branham would instruct him as a
[1:30:34] sinner
[1:30:34] fair enough of a compassion and Dawson
[1:30:40] loved brother Branham even is a sinner
[1:30:42] boy mmm facility and Garcon they hung
[1:30:45] together may he saw his own finishes
[1:30:48] ensemble and one day brother Branham
[1:30:50] told him and the Holy Spirit is like a
[1:30:55] dove let this be a common column and
[1:30:57] then if you do something wrong c-chief
[1:30:59] Aikens do man he said it'll fly away Eva
[1:31:02] boogity he said not very far oh he's
[1:31:05] real close if I suppose occupy he's
[1:31:08] watching to see if you get right it
[1:31:12] works away when you make it right
[1:31:14] comforter I said you come back and so
[1:31:19] Dawson Riley doesn't Holly was inspired
[1:31:22] by the story is this parable sit parable
[1:31:27] and so he's stacking wood with his
[1:31:29] brother and Dawson begins to tell his
[1:31:34] brother what brother Branham said about
[1:31:36] the DA doesn't ah c'mon Cyril atella

[2:04:22] dove coming down upon Jesus like a fire

[2:04:32] the pillar of fire accompanies the
[2:04:33] message

[2:04:46] so many adhere to the doctrine but until

[2:04:54] we're fighting I thank God for the
[2:04:58] doctrine but I want the love of God I
[2:05:02] want the nature of this message in my
[2:05:05] life I want to see it in the church we
[2:05:09] have seen divisions but I've got to see
[2:05:16] the nature of this message in me I've
[2:05:20] got to see the nature of this message I
[2:05:25] want to see it coming me right now John
[2:05:35] saw the holy city out of him
[2:05:42] and brother branham said it look like
[2:05:44] the Dove coming down to the earth
[2:05:48] because the heavenly nature
[2:05:51] was coming down into the new heavens and
