I heard another other I heard another out of the altar say even so Lord God Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments used amen amen let's go to Psalms please glad to see everybody this morning foreign quite cold in here this morning Psalm 37 we're going to read the 22nd through the 26th verse is feeling better now are you there betvula for such attitude blessed blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way later though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholded him with his hand I have been young and now I am old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lend it and his seed is blessed is let us pray Heavenly Father we are Celeste we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for giving us eyes to see with remissions this word of today Lord we see your grace [Music] Lord I pray that you bless the service in a special way in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated there's a lot of things that are on my heart this morning but I like to entitle this message God God's order of things God's order of things love that it shows that you we realize by the grace of God that uh we often get confused and nobody's life because we we don't know exactly what God is doing I believe this is why the word of God tells us to trust the Lord all of our hearts you don't understand in all foreign did you hear that last part of it acknowledge Him in all our ways to correct our path when we think about order we think about someone or some Authority command us or direct us or instruct us it's also when we think about order we can also think about an arrangement no performance or disposition of people or things in relation to each other who are in this position a lot this is why we have chairs in churches to maintain an order and we put these chairs in a particular position so that the the it won't look like a mass of confusion [Music] it is what we call order yes God is a god of order hello I remember when he created everything and he found that the Earth was void without shape God began to put it in order and everything that God put in order has remained in his order except for mankind except we are the ones that are out of order and everything that we see in a negative foreign but this is not Eternal not even the state is Everlasting it is because we know that God will place man back into his original order original we know by God's grace that we have come through I'm jumping a little bit we have come through what we call Seven Church ages and even at the end of that seven churches we find out that the church has got out of order they left their first love his own list and there's so much out of order God himself calls him Babylon Babylon a ball of confusion when God sent William Branham who is our Elijah Elijah came to put things back in order the first thing he uh one of the things that we know that he put back in place was the altar of God hallelujah amen how many people thought that the church was the thing that saved them but I don't care who whose Church you go to Allah Church represents a woman legally is represents in farm and there is no church that can save you it took a male lambes he was the Lamb of God who was Jesus Christ himself what are we doing why is this time what is the space and time that God has allotted to the Bride of Jesus Christ according to Matthew 25 to prepare herself to lead her Lord and believe you are not has been allotted to you prepare yourself to meet the Lord has an end to it one day the door will be shut and the Gentile age will hallelujah amen so this time was given to us you say not now but I asked the question if not now Hallelujah the Bible said that the bride is making herself ready nobody can make this is your time [Music] Queen Esther foreign we think the Judge foreign that's what Paul says he said basically wherever I find myself I am going to be content I am going to be content I'm going to be happy no matter what I go through I know who's leading me hallelujah amen those of us who are parents we we children lives by our judgments we watch over them like Shepherds see them endanger themselves and sometimes our warning only when the child is immature the child being immature sometimes take the chastisement that's a cruel punishment in a position sometimes children think their parents hate their foreign [Music] [Music] coming up I didn't get many weapons the Mama didn't beat me like she could have come on but she gave me one good one man I'll never forget it and I thought my mom was cruel because I didn't understand the endangerment of my life the thing that I did if I if my mom had not given me the good ones more than likely I would have been dead or in jail hallelujah amen it was only when I matured and look back and what she did there is when I said Thank you and I thank you for doing what you did um hallelujah amen my mom didn't cut off limbs my man doesn't treat me uh uh she didn't cut limbs off the tree she went down to the root of the tree John the Baptist in Italy and she uprooted she wanted to make sure that that would never return again Hallelujah to my mama that's the way God words you think God is true Hallelujah is that right even science scientists or this age memories this age believe in science oh they love science and they take science and they said but as soon as something go wrong man it shows it's no longer science anymore they blame God he'll blame you right yes they're correct as long as it's going good because there is a tsunami earthquake [Music] see even those who say they don't believe in God um I hope you get where I'm going to understand when you are grateful to where God leads you lead you don't you understand where and where a company hallelujah amen and it is for your goodness now I'm getting ready to go come to something here The Lord Is Our Shepherd listen yeah that's the word isn't it the Lord is ourselves Hallelujah the shepherd not only protects us the the the the the dangers of the world but the shepherd also Deliver us out of the hands of the enemy demand is enemy now I'm coming to something because I want you to understand in order for you to make a rapture I'm gonna say it again in order for you to make a Rapture you must mature you must mature and when you mature [Music] work together called according to his purpose Peter James and John he was shown in prison while they were in prison for counting them worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus that's where God he is in control still praise him the Bible says in all things give thanks about you coming from a message Revelation chapter four uh apocalypse part one my brother and sister it behooves us as Sons and Daughters of God to check up on ourselves every hour of the day Paul says I Die daily Paul says I Die daily yet I live not I it's your math sexual but Christ lives in me see we checked up because not just checking up every day hallelujah amen now the Bible says that I'm coming to something because as I said people don't understand that God is judging you all alone House of God when you become a Christian Christianity now the word of God says and he delighted in whatever how many of us want to make a Rapture oh God you're just a little bit too slow with that was it playing but you know it's like you you raised your hand yeah in hope to make a Rapture this is not a time to work with horses I I I'm gonna say it again we're not working with hope hallelujah amen the Bible says make your calling an election sure yes [Music] if you never you're going to make a Rapture until you understand the price has already been paid for you as you working with the laws of God you will find yourself foreign like I said in the morning we've got two Spirits working in the church spirit is working in in in in in denominations and this is in two Spirits if I would say like working in the message one is a liberal Spirit and the other one is a conservative Spirit local Expressions the liberal Spirit has made Grace Africa La grass a disgrace swazin discuss I'm gonna say it again the liberal spirit in the message a disgrace and the conservatives hey let's be Concepts has made the message Allah and they're both wrong walked in the middle of the road hallelujah amen the lord caught the woman in adultery but the middle of the road who was Jesus himself I am the Fulfillment of the Lord [Music] and he was the was the one who was able to impart Grace to that woman let me show you what I'm talking about oh magnify the Lord right now I'm going to magnify the Lord who is the Lord but the word of God hallelujah is written electrically that if a man take another man's wife let's magnify the Lord [Music] hallelujah in the minds of the Pharisees and the Sadducees so when you magnify the word of the Lord of God all have sinned to Encounter of the glory of God do something y'all understand me that's when the Bible says None is righteousness that person so we can sit in a position you're righteous and some others but none of us are righteous let me let me show you what we've done in the message Hallelujah we took the law expect of it and you know we did it ignorantly because you know what the Lord will do the law will puff you up and it will make you think you have a family and nobody else will it come from and all your preachers you thought was so righteous and holy give us Jesus said the whitest sepulchers why did sepulchers the people they trusted in listen to themselves say you won't go in and you won't let the subject your subjects go in either in other words you're holding the truth but the word in unrighteousness is I didn't call no names we elevated in those are foreign we did just what the word of God told us not to do hallelujah amen come on somebody it's the truth you see I'm gonna preach the truth whether you like me or not all right and I'm gonna tell y'all something preachers I ever seen yeah some of the meanest preachers it's in this message I'm gonna say hallelujah is that right so go ahead [Music] on Earth are they going to take you to a Heavenly place not there themselves God is tired of this nonsense don't look at me I can't take you nowhere but I know the God who cares check your password hallelujah amen the point is it's not the preachers you fall in love with the Holy Ghost to the center speed Paul said follow me hallelujah amen so it's not me you following me Hallelujah who is your husband he owes so many preachers use that one quote all right and they use that one one quote you into shape [Music] layer conception like I said the other day that Pastor yes who said that he loved brother you don't [Music] know you go dressed you make a statement like that how are you going to dress it up and make it say something different yeah hallelujah amen let me show you what brother Brandon says a true Mount Transfiguration experience [Music] it only glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ he said that a true man of God will not even glorify himself hallelujah amen y'all remember when I first came here some of y'all wanted to carry my books I appreciate thank you nonsense nonsense Vermont it ain't even scripture Hallelujah yeah I'm being real it's just you God has an order and we see the nucleation Spirit message tolerate it that man is leading to hell oh y'all don't think of it like that huh like I said if I had been sitting in this church he would have felt a wind go by him yeah mm-hmm Hallelujah you love the Lord you're different but I'm trying to come to something I can't get there something keeps taking me somewhere else but the Bible says when you fall into divers Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith y'all still need patience myself but you don't look at the trials as being a curse from God expects you to wait [Music] God wants you to be long suffering you've got to be long sufferings the trial brings a change every test brings a change without the test you'll never know but when you pass the test you know something has changed people say oh Lord have mercy I'm trying if you can get this message that I'm trying to give unto you this morning that God is allowing to come to you Paul said I'm going to rejoice in my infirmities that's a mature a person who can Rejoice hallelujah amen you know and I hope I'm not out of line but you know our brother Orville kabamba is expectations a young man I think he just turned 20. how many universities affliction this man is suffering with cancer out with cancer it is every time I go by to see him every time I call him I am getting better y'all understand what I'm saying my next question mark question how many of you have been praying for him because remember when Peter James and John in the prison the whole church went into prayer is that right amen I mean they were so consumed by prayer Tabitha thought it was a ghost but the point is they were so powerful in their prayers God dispatched foreign God would answer first he said the Son of God because we're closer are related to God y'all understand what I'm saying our prayer we pray can shake heaven Hallelujah you understand me we do not have to know different parts the Situation's linger before you approach god with hope that's all you're going to get is Hope who is this but even if you don't have to say ask God foreign yes you don't have the faith to overcome something in your life you should say God I don't have it is my Lord Jesus you just shall live by your face your face hallelujah amen it works Psalms 97 I'm trying to show you something someone else said you've ever taken shows because the Judgment of God is all not always it is not cruel like you think God judgment watches you not yourself not just your head he watches you in your heart he watches your heart July because the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart you understand me so God watches the power he protects you for potential come on folks how many of you in here have ever thought to do wrong [Music] but God protected you may give that position I I say like like this he ran a roadblock you don't have to say I know what I'm talking about you have an intention to do wrong foreign you might as well be truthful but take care of yourself because I know how he works that's because you're sick on myself you say oh God don't work like that oh Julius David was going to kill neighbor is that right but God watching majority see what God did was he spoke his judgment through Abigail yeah sometimes God will speak his judgment through somebody else they don't know what you intend to do and that word would be the very thing you need to hear okay that's God's judgment that is God who's watching over yourself and Abigail say don't worry about it my husband is a fool normally a temple right his name is fool his name is neighbor Sonos don't let his blood man listen be on your hands is that right over sometimes Revenge when somebody do what's wrong we won't reveal and when you desire Revenge vengeance is mine pass all your cares on him for he cares for you but when you try to fight um Zion heard and was glad Psalm 77 8-12 we uh dudes Hallelujah I don't have my watch oh it's 1208 I'll be done by three yeah give me a few more minutes I don't know which one of those times are right but Zion heard and was glad and the daughters of Judah Rejoice because of the Judgment of God of oh Lord because of that judgment oh Lord is you you hear that because of his judgments for thou Lord art high above all the Earth Thou Art exalted far above all gods you [Music] ye that love the Lord hate evil he preserveth the soul of his Saints he delivered them out of the hand of the wicked yeah y'all hear what I'm saying hallelujah it's amazing because a lot of time I I preached last week but we break promises and we say God if you do this for me I'll do this I don't ask for your promises but we'll make them anyways and the Bible says it's better for you not to break up now hallelujah amen how many of y'all remember the story of last uh uh uh a blind Bartimaeus versus foreign foreign God give you the job and you forget about it but we do that we do that we're human but God is a god of the middle of the road it still gives us Grace thank you but he won't kill you anyway God heals blind maname his wife and blind bottom is going up to the priest to take his lamb to take his lamb to be a a sacrifice and the priest says yes this lamb is your eyes Islam take you where you need to go I will buy you another lamb oh how many of us would have jump on now you hear what I'm saying to the priests [Music] because [Music] sacrifice that lamb like he promised God comes around and give Blind by the mayors benediction [Music] just the other day I was in need CVS and I was coming out a man was in that was working in the CVS he said you got your ticket yet I said one ticket he said the lottery is a billion now let's get the lottery he said you I said where are they selling The Mask what's going on what's going on he said we don't sell them here he said but you can go to the store he said Casey and get you a ticket or two who knows you might win it the human mind went yeah y'all may have already bought your tickets but I I ain't gonna do that no I can't do that can you see Pastor Isaiah Brooks all right well Pastor Isaiah Brooks a billion dollars some of y'all might criticize some of y'all gonna line up behind my door hey oh God help with Jesus pastor we forgive you but you see is being true to God because only the pure and heart shall see God Hallelujah y'all don't think I've been tempted in that way I have um there was one time I was a season in my life I forgot how much money it was and everywhere I would go I would see the same number everywhere and I told these brothers I said I really believe that's that lottery number foreign [Music] has brought us to one thing May journalism the church ages as I come they ended up out of order remember what they what they were doing they left Grace and they began to do a lot of Works they don't call myself some places it says your Works he comes and say Works twice Jesus comes and said to certain Church ages and your Works has been good and did you have any uh and what happened it's because they developed a system and that system it came along and leave your personal ity a place that you'll be governed only by the laws you won't even feel him sometimes but you'll be obedient to the things Crystal hallelujah amen and I'm not I'm not uh what I'm saying is as long as your your life if you allowing your your weaknesses to constantly condemn you you have not received the revelation of Calvary is that right I'll just take the message for what it is when God justifies you you are Justified as though you've never sinned in the first place but we allow our paths when something is placed under the blood and the devil has no Authority that's what the Bible [Music] dominion over you know you are on somebody's law or systems hello and when we harshly judge our brothers and sisters for errors what law are you running by I don't know because if you examine yourself Hallelujah I ain't never done that before I'm sure that's what the Pharisees thoughts and then Jesus said let the one who without saying am I making sense the Bible says they will know because of the love that you have of course [Music] that's it God is trying to bring us into love into his Divine Love Story Grace has played his part lagrasse Grace will lead us on but when you allow Grace you understand what I'm saying grace is just how can I say it as long as you continue to rely on Grace well she don't thank you I never mature you know what I mean by that I'm sorry if I do wrong I know he's going to forgive me so I'll do wrong you understand me and that's what people have been doing oh great we're on the grace and you never overcome Karma conquer the sin everyone y'all hear what I'm saying grace who fixes the problem said we continue in sin is that my word that Grace may have abound God forbid the church Ages was Grace Grace she did what she made herself ready she checked herself out every hour of the day control and got victory over over herself every day somebody help me this message comes to give us victory over ourselves [Applause] until we come into the full statue of Christ selfishness it has to leave your life bringing us into a condition and that condition must be holy a second condition Holiness without no man shall see the Lord oh I got the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost like I said God is not going to come in here and look into you [Music] that's right that ribbon there in Jericho had to be put out the window it was in the house but the Scarlet had to be taken outside the house and placed on the outside so people could see it yeah it's not on the outside they can't see it foreign I'm coming to a close it's so you can understand God order okay separated the darkness from the light the Lord [Music] this is what we're having a hard time I told you uh some service some messages ago about the message of Satan the flood of Satan when Satan comes in like a flood come if you have left everything and we're not talking about our natural flood we're talking about a spiritual flood amen Satan has flooded the World by these instruments and your phone and all those apps you've got on there I have two seconds that is not a representation of the Holy Spirit you better delete them because you know what's going to happen that's because I've been thinking if I said think about it every time you feel a little bored foreign [Music] [Music] for 15 with it this is my brother when I'm saying I'm gonna let me end this quote foreign Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7 7 Matthew said said how be it in vain do they worship me they sit down thank you teaching the doctrines of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be that's true there are other men dominance you say that ain't true then why are we divided only doctrines of menopause the Church of God I know what I'm talking about only doctrines of men is that a word let's say like brothers that was uh separated by a walk about the the Dogma they shook yourself he said and then the flood waters came up [Music] above the wall and then they began to Fellowship it says uh don't worry there's a flood coming and these little walls that these people got it says send me the hindrance of us us fellowshipping Hallelujah you won't worry about What doctrine somebody else has you'll be so glad to see a Christian somebody's standing for the word and if they feel the page we ought to be happy hallelujah amen you know Paul them didn't say What doctrine do you believe say have you received the Holy Ghost do you have any questions by one Spirit we're baptized and said let's pray somebody said call I'm almost done really yeah this is my last quote Yeah Do Me In Worship in vain the main worship they get says but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be foreign [Music] [Music] born of a virgin [Music] Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel social he is a nominal Christian it belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer spirituality that kind of believer is one who has been baptized in the body of Christ and he is a member of him but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tales grow up with the wheat okay not to be uprooted that is commandment of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet pancola so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group a lot less people I say as a group mix on the one hand he is praising and on the other hand he is rebuking he has told what is right with the True Believers now he warns what the false Vine must do that stand Justified before but my point is this until we break take the right attitude toward our trials toward uh the testing of the lord your attitude toward those things is the is the determining Factor so so whether you are mature you know still being vague an immature adolescence this is your time I wish I could have brought it out in in a greater way disrespective but I'm telling you now if you missed your opportunity this space right now I said it's nice to have good things nice to work hard to have good things that's not your priority oh it shouldn't be your priority yes your priorities should be making the Rapture your priorities should be off y'all understand me amen I can't cry it out enough I can't cry out enough just to give you a thought every natural thing has a spiritual application how many of y'all know that the river Euphrates is drying up he said again the river Euphrates is drying up the river you you can't be yourself that's a real truth celebrity and if you know your Bible you'll understand what is symbolism we know that the demons that came out of Euphrates what they did to to the Germans I mean to the Jews even on the hips those same demons [Music] two seconds [Music] and things like that took place that took place and it shows it was just as important as the now River was to Egypt and what happened with those demons left Germany they came here it's a demo said what happened America boomed technology technology you know what I'm saying everything with Scott with shadows of course because the antelope is now driving the people into the Judgment of God it won't be water this time it will be fire they're breaking down the people in prison so the people can become slaves taking away all your s everywhere they're doing the same thing what have they done they have United and even as the darkness is uniting the Bride of Jesus Christ supposed to be United right now let me say like I like I said there's so many seals that have already been opened yes thank you all these things are unfolding now foreign and we're looking at all of the chaos in the world we know the fire is about to fall and you know foreign yeah it's more than me nature is fighting us now he says we've never seen so many volcanoes and I'm trying to remember this is for you not me it's for you you think you got too much time on what's really happening and if you're not careful you're going to me you just thank you guys so much time you don't yeah no but God's waiting on us not he's waiting on us Let's Dance all the people yeah and next thing brother bear said the only thing left is for the Bride of Jesus Christ to take a Rapture yeah you cannot take place until the bride get in her conditions brother random saw the bride getting out of she has gotten out of it she began to allow systems in churches and everything like that she left her love she she it's time for repentance people that's all I'm saying search your heart and I've told you this before I will bring you here for me to preach the same message but how do you know that when law has taken place because we reveal more sin people who are on the law they become weaker because they realize what they cannot performance look at this Jesus said you dared me in Bones [Music] but the outside they look right foreign [Music] hello are we Millions followed Moses Moses God was trying to get them to see the god that Moses was following year it said you need to see the gods I tell you heard me say this and I said don't tell me you Jesus is your husband if you can't introduce me to [Music] I'm not what I want to be but correct [Music] I don't know what you're living [Music] may God help us but I can tell you the truth [Music] foreign to make sure the darkness [Music] have been easy [Music] [Music] yours I have no fear yes [Music] let us pray heavenly father versus I don't know how well the message was delivered but I surely hope is that the people really understood God I just know Lord that we don't have the time [Music] yeah yeah [Music] who's to say that we can die before the translation [Music] to empty out everything Lord [Music] Lord focus on you [Music] Let It Be Let It Be loved ever cause is our desires come to a place [Music] I've come through many Protestant trials [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] God [Music] yellow demo [Music] those lights everybody that knows some nice things [Music] even though [Music] many times [Music] here to me [Music] this time [Music] right now [Music] I'm not against any preacher it's just not going to uh against any church I have no enemies and when I speak the things that I say hey I have no one particular person in my mind because we all must get introduced and failed God I failed God in the past I was a part of a system and I didn't even know I was caught up in particular system because therefore I'm trying to tell you there's a system and if you're not spiritual enough but the moment you see him ask God to deliver you [Music] his arms out of that system and all the system into his arms you might think I'm crazy but thank you for football but I'll say I'm glad I didn't have to have a doctrine of divinity [Music] and I'm gonna tell you like this [Music] he's going to make a rapture because they see the difference they'll see the difference between systems [Music] [Music] thank you My God is Awesome
