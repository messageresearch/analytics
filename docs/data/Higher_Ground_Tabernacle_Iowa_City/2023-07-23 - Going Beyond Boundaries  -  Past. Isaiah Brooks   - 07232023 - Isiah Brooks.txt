those of you who made it ceremony it was great Whenever two come together as one and the person our Minister and brother our brother Williams yeah I met him last night we talked a little bit about living and we'll talk more it was just a busy time last night I wasn't trying to avoid you in the same here it was just one busy night last you know as a man of God and as a servant of God [Music] I don't have time for him for nothing else I want his will to be done no matter what that is so we love the Lord not prolonging the time we're going to ask that you turn with us to Joshua hello 24th chapter foreign he's growing God for his goodness I think with all of our heart we must remember the bride will be without spot wrinkle or blemish one of the things that keep me going in the shoes one of the things that keep me on my knees is to know that only the pure in heart foreign Joshua 24 we're going to read the 13th through the 16th verse says and then from there we go to Joshua 2. foreign the scripture says the community I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and out of yours which you planted not do ye eat foreign and put away the gods with your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord flavor [Music] eternal [Music] whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land ye dwell for as for me and my house we will serve the Lord foreign and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods yes can we all read that scripture together the 16th one it says God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods I trust that's everybody's response Joshua 2 and this is Joshua foreign first cities the street that is left behold when he come into the land thou shall bind this line of seek Scarlet thread in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shall bring thy fathers and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home into thee Olympia foreign foreign house in the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him University okay sir let us pray father God we come before you thank you we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy Lord there is no reason are you the only true Living God we honor you to this morning thank you for your goodness we thank you for the grace that you bestowed upon us words cannot express our gratitude in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you maybe see that remember that's why I was thinking the other day and just thinking about the time that we may have left to live on this Earth is brother Branham has come and gone since 65 we have been moving under the inspiration of Elijah and the song from us which is the true Holy Ghost [Music] we thank God for that but then you know the Bible is a book not just a book it is the book of redemption and it is amazing how that all books a pattern after the book you know every book have they have chapters they have headings of chapters and while I was thinking about that I thought about what point in time are we in is those of us who are book readers [Music] we know how a book starts out and how it is the first chapter shows like genesis is to us and then that last chapter is the wrapping up of all things that was first stated in the first chapter and I thought about episodes and many of us know what that what I'm trying to say those of you have been uh really into television or things of that nature you you know how the the enemy and [Music] they're good at it and right at the end of one series they have something so dramatically until stay all right and you say with yourself I'm gonna see this last one and I'll be done but they give you another chapter and it's better than the last amen and sometimes that ending is expected foreign [Music] don't know about you no no there were times when a series would end I would be disappointed but that's not the way the Bible is written hallelujah amen because you and I must understand amen that God has sting really great help me of the seventh Church age we can look back at it and see if what what but now we're now we're another series which is the final one for the Gentile Brown the script has already been written hallelujah amen but it's only written to those who are capable because everybody doesn't get the part because that part was written for specific person specific certain kind of people that knows how to enter into to the script he serves you're not a good actor you can't play a good role you don't know how to personalize the scripts the Bible is it's the true Living Word of God hallelujah but people people like to enter into amen am I wrong about that please because what Jesus says that he is the door he is the door no man can enter a person you got to come here for him to knock on the dog the door has to be open and you must walk into it what are you saying brother books I'm saying the Bible it's a book that you can enter into and you in the book become one and I'm thinking even uh I want to say this we are beyond the seven churches we know what brother random says each Church age overlaps I understand where she's at she must know amen that she's in a particular place a place a place that we've never walked foreign [Music] more than anything and that is the writer of the book of the book is that right when I study at the University of South Carolina and I was taking the a course of composition and and in my first grade on my first uh grade on my first exam I I didn't do well for my Beyonce so I went to the uh instructor's office God gave me that wisdom I was a Christian so I watched he was giving me his thoughts you understand me so while I was there I was thinking Japan said I must learn to learn Hallelujah so you understand that time I aced every one of my papers hey so when he would read [Music] so you say well what do you mean you mean I'm saying hello in order to understand the Bible you must come in contact with the person who wrote the Bible hallelujah amen and you must learn how to think like the authority you must learn how to think to think like the author whatever we have now the mind of Christ Hallelujah you will think like Christ you will live like Christ you will obey like Christ amen we're going Beyond these boundaries our ultimate goal is to become one with the word Christianity it's not about popularity [Music] the devil don't even care you belong to a message if you don't get the Authority nothing is Hallelujah amen now brother Bradham taught us that we were we are in an age of divine love and creation foreign in the preview of the Bride the Onward Christian soldier with the cross of Jesus going on before he ever said Christ must always be please our focal points hallelujah amen now you're wondering where I'm going with this because God has given us land he's given us land he's given us houses almost all the things that we so need in this world establish this we did not establish this this was always established when we got here y'all hear what I'm saying and now these blessing blessing to us hallelujah but you must always remember it was God who did it is not your employer is God who has done for you Hallelujah I believe in this age God will anoint us hallelujah without anointing that Joshua had somebody help me here the same anointing David had Hallelujah is that right every another thing every Victor victorious anointing Victoria Hallelujah was done by Christopher somebody help me here and the same thing they did yesterday God is able and will do today but we must focus on Perfection faith faith [Music] [Applause] we must always remember we cannot stop Hallelujah of your faith don't you understand our attitude we'll determine whether we're winners all right is that right yes slave me job said though he slayed me I will trust him hallelujah amen this government not just here in America everything is falling apart but my question is that somebody said well be that man oh man I'm in Babylon and through America Road through America saying the British is coming tonight he said I was there what happened what happened yes he not only stepped in the book but he stepped in the history and I think that was in Waterloo when he was preaching that is that there are Waterloo yeah and they said that all the ministers got up and walked out hey do they mean [Music] but see everything Christ you were there and that's what he was saying I am identified hallelujah amen when George Washington across the Delaware of it Delaware are available he said I was there I remember you now brother it took a while you and I must understand we must go beyond the boundaries do you know what I'm saying let's go for services somehow if you're not careful you take the spirit the spirit of the church on upon really is hmm you're not here to take on this churches the only Spirit you take on is Christ that's where the power is that right amen now the thing I'm the shoes because brother he said or the blood of Christ is above the Covenant you hear what I'm saying got a covenant unconditional Covenant only if you are if you're under the blood at least you got somebody say Amen it is attendance in church he said when I see the blood I pass over you and what I'm trying to say and you've heard me say ing you know so many people don't like me to say it yeah and you've got to go beyond those battles as long as you stay in the boundaries die spiritually because God is a progressive God is that right amen you keep crying out until God establishes Zion Hallelujah until we see Perfection on the inside Hallelujah because you'll be able to love your brothers as well as your enemy somebody help me here you'll act like Christ that that'll be the only thing that you'll have on your mind it's really a matter of life and death and death because there are so many people dying right now can I say it like this thinking that they're in the message you're not in the message until you're in Christ you you you might sympathize with it you might know it's right until you get before God to your thoughts and your idea so the holy God right into that Holy Place amen it doesn't matter who you are oh my God hallelujah amen see when God and this is why I read um Joshua the question it's a matter of life and death and death I'm so afraid that people are not seeing it we don't even see the [Music] and look how long it's been but now but now man no everything he preached we see it We Believe hallelujah amen and if though if the if the we are the tear they see is you 90. if the tears you 19. silly friend let me ask you a question because we know the terror always grow faster than the wheat is are you aware that in in this congression to pass laws to kill Christians to get rid of you I'm trying to tell you something it's going to turn you see what I'm saying because what you got the Liberals you got you got Sodom and Gomorrah thank you against abrahamas if I can say it like that what what you got now and it's not just did y'all know in Europe in Europe there is a woman who testified on social media that God Christ healed her he he's the loving and she had to go through traumatics uh things for two years they persecuted her for two years I know what I'm talking about there was also another man who testified that God delivered him from homosexuality put him in jail for two years they're trying to sign think that's going to stay there listen to what I'm trying to say even among the uh Republicans I'm neither one but my point is when it comes to that Christians are Republicans so they're not trying to get rid of the Republicans they're trying to get rid of the Christians Hallelujah and I don't know I had to be careful because of how I speak against ordinances because God raises up and God brings down thank you thank you and everything none of those people if it wasn't for God so you can't just speak evil about them if God put him there he's ridiculous Ah that's the truth so what I'm trying to say if he put him there hello there for a purpose hallelujah amen and what we need to see is that the purpose you should bring persecution on the bride is oh yeah my question is shake it like brother Brandon said it when the water begins to fall in Noah's day come on he said the door was already shut up please come if you're not in then you will you will not be interested this is the children this is not a time to the pushes to enter I look in the mirror we've got a picture of me when I was younger photos and and it might sound a little carnal but when I look at that picture man I wasn't so bad looking after all boys but when I look at me now I said Lord have mercy and I don't say that to be funny but the truth is y'all know what I'm saying some of us who are older we know what we used to look like yeah it is to invest in this hello emphasis it is the soul that needs salvation foreign hallelujah amen we fail to see can come up I'm coming let me read a question a quote here brother man who says coming from the message choosing of a bride uh and that's in 1965. [Music] he said your Eternal Destiny is a choice [Music] [Music] there is a yeah and it's a dangerous thing for a man or woman a boy or girl to step across that line yeah there's no return yeah it might be that time that many will make their decision where this spin the endless eternity I don't know about you I should say possible but I know that token must be applied and that's what I look for in people to see Christ you know I know how he behaves I know how he acts now I might as well finish it up we look at this thing and yeah I'm a reader I'm gonna jump I hit I'm sorry I'm gonna jump ahead of myself and read a quote here by God's grace yeah if you don't take this message seriously like I was telling somebody you say you got the Holy Ghost sent this pain you don't even have a prayer life you say you got Holy Ghost when you don't read your Bible you say you say listen to the message let me tell you this is you're either dead or you need Revival you understand what I'm saying so what you can only judge that but how can you love God you never talk to talk it's the truth when people get quiet because people don't like me preaching like this but Bible said judgment first began I can preach you some deeper things you know if the token is on display we won't have the confusion we have but that's true is that right because the token is not only the spirit of Love is the spirit yes is that right when troubles go bad Hallelujah the token knows how to correct it right amen coming from the mess it's kind of warm in here so I'm gonna slow it down Christ is the mystery 19 years brother Brandon says this is God's great mystery of Love expressed that God and man became one see the world the whole thing is God and man wait one two seconds God and man was one year alone and God and man is one here she's what it is being filled with his Spirit him having preeminence [Music] does he have preeminism that was God's achievement purpose to do that he might be in Christ Christ in us and all together the Holy Spirit one right the Holy Spirit same thing [Music] Christ he sounds is that right I like this how many times something moves you stop it that's simple Faith you knew you had a foot to stop it so you used it without even thinking it you understand what I'm saying so that's how Faith Works when you know God is in it you don't have to look for him and you use him the word automatically comes Hallelujah many other afflictions of the righteous but God delivered all of them delivered to he goes on to say hey continue 475 475 in the same that could say all this through Moses let there come frogs the same one could stand up there let this water be turned to wine is that is that right yes he's the same God the same one remember one thing I love about brother Branham but one of the scriptures that really he meditated on and thought about it was whatsoever you say if you say to this mountain whatsoever you say two seconds he saw it in the world and once you see something in the world and you have to say Lord manifest yourself manifest through this word is that right amen it's something I never wanted to know what that meant yeah if you see the word and you don't understand it and you want to know what it means we'll make that word come to life in your life did he do it for the prophet that's why he did it for the problem so that you and I can see he'll do it for us hey so simple example he just don't change it's God in man that's his manifestation he saw some manifestation and this is where people fall short s and I'm gonna say this is a quote yeah thank you too why it never was brother Brandon always crying and you don't have to say amen I really don't care um and you know when I say things like that trying to take away the office of brother Brown how can I take away his office his office has already been established it lives to this day hallelujah amen the thing is you better find yours you need to find your position amen hallelujah amen what do you think Elijah would have been thinking about if he just always thought about Elijah he didn't even ask for Elijah the question was where is the god that's what we want foreign things I thought I'd bring but you know when it comes to God and his children this is awful God always worked with them and if you've got eyes to see you know right from wrong hallelujah amen and you know I want to say this and and and and and I want to iterate it I want to really emphasize it is above the Covenant right rehab was given a covenant but the Covenant was this display the token hallelujah amen right now listen the prophet God said it wasn't for the lamb Delano [Music] hallelujah amen because the lamb was Jesus the life in the blood was gone is that right it was the spirit when I see the life of God in you yes I walk with brother brown but that is not what God is looking for the token lives hallelujah amen you know you gotta choose this day everybody yes like Joshua say choose you this Publishers hallelujah amen the saddest thing about it brother Brandon brought a word that exposure hello amen let me say it like this Paul must have had a terrible time trying to convince the Jews that their Traditions were wrong that the only thing that counts now blood of Jesus Christ all your Works nothing [Music] she wasn't really religious and it tip she wasn't religious she was a Christian she was saved she went born again she had the Life of Christ with the Life of Christ This is how we fight about it amen brother Adam said the Holy Ghost is the token that we have been pardoned because if the case is closed to every man and woman that truly has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has been tried he is identified with his attorney with his sacrifice and the token he holds in his possession it shows that his trip his trip is paid to Glory he holds I've got a handkerchief in my eyes and what's on the inside dress right I got the token hello messages hello amen oh if I don't do this if I don't do that some Catholics in their morals hallelujah amen it's not that easy foreign let me ask you a question what about that man who's got a better house that doesn't signify anything I told somebody the other day I said because God love you don't mean you saved they looked at me like what what I said the Bible said God Jesus loved the Rich Young Ruler uh [Music] are they are available he said well yeah that was that filial love what the Bible says the Bible said he loved him and he lifted his soul up in hell yeah I would not follow Jesus hallelujah amen now if he loved you and you following him you all right y'all looking at me crazy but it's true and that's what's wrong with a lot of people everybody they take the love of God for granted [Music] y'all get on me because I you know I'll Be Seeing Things I'll be trying not to see like Lord close my eyes close my eyes she did the shorts before people laughing you see my expression on my face is when I'm seeing things I don't like fast and she did the shows yeah they make fun of me but I'm gonna tell y'all when the Holy Ghost come I understand this he's going to tell you the same things I've been telling him hmm one of these old for you catch the revelation of it yourself out after the world and expect God to be pleased please is that all right correct let me let me finish this message right here uh coming and I'm trying to finish I win a totally different way it's a token message the senior song you know when Paul was trying to tell the Jews that Judaism wasn't going to work you know they tried to kill him you know all the time he had to run all the time because they said I don't tell me and you know attitude we've been doing that all these years mind your own business yeah we do we do is on oh I don't care if people don't love me I won't love you anymore I'm trying to think of something but I can't but let me move on [Music] the token message paragraph 36. [Music] they're trying to mix everything else with this increase and affiliations and all kinds of entertainment and everything won't mix but it won't mix there's absolutely it will not mix with anything the blood [Music] it must be eaten ready dressed the people and ready for the journey a when this was applied to the people must be ready for the journey it isn't for the unbelievers standing outside already under the blood already dressed [Music] in his hands hallelujah amen and when it comes down let me I'm gonna close this but one of the things that always uh I won't say always but uh it captures me La shows when Jesus Christ was on the cross brother by Adam said it like this he did not have a lowing cloth he had nothing covering his name and how humiliating that was saying God of Holiness personally I can't imagine what that must have felt like hallelujah amen you know I am a real particular person yeah I don't just dress naked around my house I had a before and after picture I was trying to lose weight and I took a picture of myself with my shirt off I think uh so you know my children never seen me like that yeah but one of my grand s got my got my mic I got pictures and he saw that one yeah and he showed his sister I felt stripped violated and I I didn't spank him but I just told him you know guys but then you're gonna show your sister you know what I mean all of that get my shirt off icious all he gay had was his nakedness and I'm closing on this all he has with his nakedness and all God it was his naked word of a uh he exposed himself so you can see yeah the real revelation of who he is he don't want you adding to it take away from it if you've never been to Calvary you never understand who is just to save you the only way you're going to make heaven you still love him he as we said in the marriage obey him the message you see it just is a love affair and in order to do that you got to go be Gold Beach beyond the boundaries you gotta love God more than anybody else I can't look at somebody else well I know they the Lord no you gotta love more yeah I don't mean no harm quite simple message when I say the preview of the Bride do you think that was just yes brother Brandon vision of the Bride how she walked how she presented herself the clothes she wore is he literally gave us a mirror this is when Esther needed to tire d of God you can't tell people something because they don't care what you say yeah don't worry about the word the word says and at the end was running do you love the Lord Amen Let Us Our Father God we come before you know thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for all that you do something better to me good to the people of God but they're born we praise you we thank you Lord being the God that you are Lord Jesus I wonder sometimes even why me thank you Lord is for the Amazing Grace that you bestowed upon us to love those who love me even my enemies Lord I know it's you Lord there's no

this message and see the time that we're living that will spend the time that we have left Victory Lord grant us Victory Lord in your name Jesus Christ for he's alive living in me to tell the world
