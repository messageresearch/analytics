speak about uh speak about God can build upon us old uh that's God's speciality it's when everything ruins that's when he can [Music] build so we're read in the book of Psalm 122 102 from to verse 17 I believe Israel you got the verse already 102 verse 12- 17 Jesus Christ on generation for you the Lord abide forever in our memory for Generation to generation and you will rise up that uh that we have mercy upon Zion for it's the time for gracious to her for the set time is come [Music] for thy servant take pleasure in her stones and favor her dust and the nation shall fill the name of the Lord and all Kings of the earth th glorify when the Lord shall build up Zion he will appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute one and not despise their prayer we shall pray Our Father Our God we just read your word now we need your spirit come and take this word food for each one of us let the anointing take us Lord and to hold the control Jesus Christ Our God Amen you may be seated I'm going to read another uh book on uh Isaiah 58 verse 11 and 12 we greeting the new comes among us there someone Among Us that's we want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus is there anybody that's new stand up so your brother can greet you we of our brother what is your name brother J okay so you heard you are welcome in the house of the Lord we are a small church but I believe we not a small church we are small because we in a small we a very big church we greet you welcome to the house of the Lord you may be [Applause] seated so God can build upon old runes reading Isaiah isah 58 says the Lord will always be your guide and will give strength to our body and you shall be like a garden that's are water God is speaking to us it's a prophecy that has to be fulfilled upon each one of us to whom the Lord is the guide Lord the Lord will be always your guide Isaiah 5 11 to 12 Lord will always be your guide will satisfy yourself joy and will strengthen your bones and you shall be like a watery Garden like a water spring whose water sees nor and those who belong to you your those that belongs to you for the Lord will be your guide all belongs to you those of yours we build the old west places and you will raise up the foundation and they we call you repairer of the brides the one that restores paths and makes the landable as I said brothers and sisters this Only God Can restore or rebuild upon on the old bridge in the first book we read in we see that Lord speaking about Zion z is the city that the Lord built through David and you see in the Bible it's called the city of David that's Zion he was bu upon and Mount Zion was built it Wells Jerusalem but I don't want to waste time on it we not it's not interesting us this morning talking about re building because the God said oh Lord the Lord will rebuild Z David says the Lord shall rebuild Zion he will show himself in his glory if we talk about reing can mention rebuilding if there was not distruction you cannot talk about if there was not a destruction you cannot talk about re if there was not destruction if there was not talk about rebuilding if there was not brothers and sisters in the same book of Psalm 102 shows the only one who can rep it's the Lord no one else can rebuild Z it's not Lord himself who could rebuild I want to tell you this morning when I'm talking about I'm not talking about Old Zion in the old test but I'm talking about I'm talking about God will reild this morning for God to rebuild I wanted to speak in English we have to testify Dem that there was there has Dem there has been a there has been those conditions that's when the Lord can re brothers and sisters God is waiting for the destruction is waiting for Destruction to reveal his glory that's why you see John 11 verse5 Jesus why did he cry he was in the of Lazarus also it has been and days his body has been Devastation already corruption was there and God was waiting for to manifest his glory so that he may not dispute his glory with somebody else brothers and S to announce you God wants to reveal his he wants to rebuild you but with Foundation that has been D we have to see you have to experiment there has to be destruction of all so that God can manifest his glory that's God's plan this is how he wants to act he's waiting for the board to getting for the things to get dark Glory that's God's ways to do things book of second Samuel chter 2 David was singing David gave the Lord his son says when the Lord delivered him from all his enemies from and he said David cry I glory be to God and I'm delivered from my enemies for the the flow of has environed me the torrent of Destruction has scared me the the link of death has ened me and the trap of death and the trap of death he say he says uh the Trap Of Death surprised me and in my my my I Cried unto the Lord I cried to my God from his he heard my voice Cry came into his ears you see that David singing the L of the day the Cod of the the the the the cord of and counter David the cords of death surprised surr David cried to the Lord he says those waves of accompass torr of Destruction had made me afraid the the board was have no hope brothers and sisters David was hopeless all hope was gone because he was about to die in that that state cried out to the Lord he Cried unto the Lord and from his Temple God heard David's voice to tell you this morning every time you're bornn your your pictures get every time you see things becoming difficult and there's no way to get out no hope for you from God's sto from his Temple God will hear your you cryto him my brothers and sisters I believe in from all my heart I know that God can rebuild on old old RS my brothers and sisters and God can also it's when things get it becomes complicated when God can rewrite your story I believe in God I can rewrite as somebody's I believe in that guy who can make somebody change from zero where he and took him I believe in that God who is able Jesus Christ take somebody from nowhere and take it to the top and I believe that God I can't rewrite a story of somebody brothers and I say because I know it God can do it he already did in the past days he can also do it this morning God can rewrite Our Story Only God you can rewrite your story if it can be to write our stories Focus men will stay focused on your mistakes on the bad that we have made in life they can say men who wants to write but when it comes to God to write your story oh my brothers and sisters I want to you when God writing down your story all your past is forgotten he takes your [Music] P forgiveness it transforms your life from nowhere where you to somebody of value somebody that's honorable somebody that's respect why because God he can restablish building on Old RS I believe God can rewrite somebody's story this morning that's how I believe it brothers and sisters now listen I want to say this God can remake somebody and he's the one who can change story David said in Psalm 140 uh Psalm 40 and it says the first verse it says I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and heard my cry I'm reading together with he brought me out of the of Destruction out of Mery and set my feet upon a rug he has established my going you see that David showing here all his hope inclined to the Lord through the Lord and the Lord heard his Cry of the on the pit of Destruction out of miracle and he establishes path upon the rock you understand from destruction from from the from the mirac from the pit of Destruction and God took him from to P him to place means from somewhere something that was from Death where in the darkness where he was God take him out it takes him out and put it's giving us a stable position establish God man cannot only God who can stabilize only God take you out of the PE and take you out of place you on the Rock of Ages God is a rock on a on on a uh dry Lane can can he is a a in a dry land means when somebody and comes to a where the condition is not good where there's no water the Lord God dry Lane you know the rooll of a ro to get you water the Lord God has to be the dry land the situation where you let God be the right the Lord God be your right in this situation you where you're going through right I believe it brothers and sisters that he is The Rock The Rock that was Wilderness by Moses the prophet said he never left the church the rock of always with the and his presence is here this morning believe is a spiritual that guides the church calling you come drink from that Ro Rock a ding Amen brother that's how I believe and it's the truth drun from that I know how those water I know what God has done I have drun from I have experience I know the experience that I had when I Dr from that yes brothers and this morning I'm inviting you to come drink freely to this uh fountain water you drink from that Fountain the water of we come out of also make out of [Applause] from R water come out of I want you to be that source of that can make all to come drink and I know that is possible God can rebuild Zion know it's the word of God and I know it's I know it's possible by faith it's possible when things gets dark and complicated God say when things will become difficult can complicate tell God oh Lord God this man this old man told us that that you I know this morning to whom things be and complicated Lord God is the same he can you the desire of your heart oh my brothers and sisters how much I feel my heart my soul to be that fountain that so that I can do something for someone this morning I believe it from all my heart the Fountain of that that that flows from Wings it's here and it's calling you this morning so you might so you might come and drink and get get solution everything that you need now hear this brothers and sisters what we're talking about what saying it's not just things that we read it's those things that we experienced if we just come and repeat what the Bible say and what the prophet say without having an experience it's going to be it's going to it's not going to but we know what we talking about David says he says he put in my mouth a new song I worship to our God and many have saw it and they fear and they conf in the Lord say bless the man that made the Lord is and that does turned to the proud he say you have you have multip God has so multiped he has done so many things has multiplied things he says your marvelous work God so multip his wonders no one is comparable to you I want to and Proclaim [Applause] it but their number is so big so that I what God has done in David it was so big he couldn't even write it down and he say bless that puts his confidence in that doesn't turn to the and those who tells lies why David say somebody that puts his trust in the Lord canot turn people that are proud can go to those people even because he has put his confidence in the Lord will multiply marous and his Wonders that has trust the Lord yes brothers and sisters I know it's the truth trust the Lord number of what God will do for will be we cannot write them down bless is a man that put his confidence in the Lord and turns not to the pray and those who tell lights brothers and sisters I want to say this talking about God who can rebuild upon all I want to speak about Father Abraham Our Father Abraham he known through all the Bible has the father of Faith as the father of our faith the faith the father of he lived to that his faith faith become as a memorial nobody in the Bible who has been tempted as our Father Abraham Abraham lived stood for 25 years without having a child I want to come back to his past life yall know that Abraham when God called him in Genesis chapter 11 Abraham was Idol worshiper he came from where people used to worship all where people was magician and were witchcraft they worship all kind of sort of God God didn't care about Abraham's he didn't cares Abraham being a worship he called out Abraham just by his grace and Abraham didn't do any for God to read so that God can choose because he was a worshiper of Idols like but it was just by God that God called AB chose he took him out his and told him get out of your country and I will bless you get out of your nation and I will bless you and Abraham came out he got out start started journey to a city that only God was the architect was going through that City when Abraham was in joury he had no children at the point where abra had Li had to lie according to his wife he said that Sarah was his s all know that story I want to tell you this morning I want to say something that the life of Abraham it was a story but when Paul came in the New Testament and he wants to comment on Abraham's life the holy goes through didn't write down the Abraham the Holy Ghost in Paul didn't say that Abraham lied the Holy Ghost he said that Abraham Our Father was justified by his Works brothers and sisters I know I believe that for us God giving us a respons if we have to write down our brother's life let not write down negative let not write down their faults let not write down let not write down but if we have something to is to write [Music] down that's what the Holy Spirit did through Paul writing down Abraham's life he says I made a lot of mistakes in my life but when when my testimony will be right would you Brothers not write down my my mistake Prophet as brother Brandon could say that he has made so many mistakes it's in says I've made so many mistakes but that day when my testimony will be in these days say my don't mention my mistakes and brother sing it if we have a t is to write down positive Point uh aspect because you know the mistakes that you mention it's probably that con uh that uh uh that's uh a Ru for that person maybe that's the thing that made his in which the Lord has to rebuild and that's why we have to we have to speak about positive things exalt our brother and tell them that they no matter what they have done no matter what they have let's exalt our brothers are we together you know God in the Bible when he's talking about the ages of churches because you know brothers and let me stop a bit I want to open this parentheses all that you see in somebody's life is always mistakes it's like you are the holy of holies you are you don't make you are most holy than we are You Are Holy of holy and when you want to reproach someone you always start with negative points but that's not how God is you know God when I'm reading the age of Church of I found out that before the spirit of God start blam God starting by exting you he says you Ephesus you didn't bear the the the we the wicked among you you you you you you have discovered those that calls while they were doing the works of Nite he said he exalted all the ages and then at the end says about what I have against you God starting by exalting and then after and then now he says what I have against you have forgotten your first love you understand God don't want to give us negative points in bad way one is's reproaching us start to accept it and stay with him that's why he's starting by tell telling us he says you didn't bear who calls apost as they were false Apostles you you Expos them those who were doing n works but what I have against you it's because you are no it's because are I will vomit you God is not stopping he says I I I advise you to come buy from me a pure that has been tested by fire God doesn't want to he wants us to be saved and he has that good way of reproaching someone with love do you do you reproach someone with love when you want to talk about your your sister do you do it with love do you do it with love maybe his mistakes as his life is in that state maybe that's ruins from his life that God has to rebuild upon those rooms upon those mistakes so I want to hurry we also have to go back because we have visitor that's coming to visit us now hear this Abraham and Abraham God made it go through all this uh for 25 years and he had that child because his faith didn't fail and his faith didn't fail and the prophet said somewhere he said God revealed himself in AB as the god that has because when ABR was TI he had to come abrah has to come to the Lord's and take strength to continue the journey when you shall be tired invting you to go to the Lord to the breast of the Lord Old and New Testament so you can get continue your journey let Nothing Stops you Nothing Stops you but even if your your faith gets weak let you come to so you can get strength now I want to speak about Joseph and Joseph know wrote down Joseph's story in a way that even his brothers even his brother couldn't stop Jose to live how how God wanted to Joseph was the blessing he was the son of prosperity the Bible say when jaob Jacob was saying blessings all his children Genesis 49 the Bible says because it was before the death of Jacob and he has to tell blessing on his children we will focus on Joseph's blessing chap in Genesis chapter 22- 26 Jacob start telling blessing upon Jose and you know what happened in Joseph's life without nothing he has been hated by brother he did not do anything just because his brother was jealous on him because of that they sold Joseph who was their blessing they sold out Jose they lied to their father that be found him and killed him you know the story his brother here in Egypt Joseph is already Governor where he's the first Minister now the the the the the the hate of his brother just helped Joseph to get to that throne in if Joseph was not hating he couldn't get to Egypt that's why certain circumstances happen in your life and sometimes we think it's curs but it's a way that takes us that leads us to our takes us to our elevation that's why we should not complain all the time a Christian is not complain a Christian is not somebody that compl a Christian lives by faith and I said the other day that faith is the boss let's read what the prophet faith is the boss it says this he say show me a little small church I saved it for you so I can read it for you he says faith comes by what we hear preaching 1954 and the prophet of God says because faith is the boss he says show me a old small church that's afraid to put his trust in God or a family let the spirit of God uh touch that that person or that church and just observe what's happening what's going to happen he says brother I assure you that those septic will go out as those insects go when you turn the lights during summer time exact that's exact exact that's the truth everything run away Faith start going and says and says that I'm the boss everything else runs away no matter what anybody says the word of God is Eternal and that's true faith is the and Joseph used to live by fa that's why every circumstance that would come in Joseph's life he was not worried it's true it could hurt you but Joseph everything is for the good of who loves God Joseph was not worried he lived by faith in a point that he could see that every condition was good for him to to succeed that's why I want to repeat it every time that many will see those condition for you to fail just look through the same window and see those condition re for your [Music] succeed through the same window that Pharaoh looked down and saw the people of Israel he says they were slaves through the same window looked down by faith and he saw that there was the people of God that was in Journey to get out of Egypt with big riches when they were get get out of pharaoh told Moses he says you go do three days wildness and come back Moses said no say we we will not come back here we get out of this country with all our belongings with our horses our all our riches and Moses say it says we will not even see it was the people of God who knew their right they were living for their right and they get they got out faith is the boss I want the faith that's to pay someone this morning Faith that's the boss to pay your works this morning because the other day I told you God doesn't pay doeses not pay woman God pay Faith When Faith Works God is obligated to pay because faith is the god consider Fai my brothers and sisters how much my soul is rejoicing this morning CU I did God could lead things in that way oh now hear this I want hear it to go to the end so we can pray a little bit you know he the prophet of God said I want to read the prophet he says in the message your posterity will possess the door the gates of that his enemy in paragraph 44 he says it says God likes to do it what God likes to do God likes to show his mighty he likes to do it he likes to manifest his power now he says now he's waiting tonight to manifest that in you God's power God is waiting to to manifest that in you to take that sin man to make him turn around Bad Evil reputation bad reputation and to a holy woman and to take that that girl who took a wrong the boy that took the wrong way take them back in a way that belongs to them to make them sound a daughter of God he says he's ready to take that who's dying from cancer and this man that's suffering from his heart the one that's blind that's Afflicted if they could simply put their faith in there it would turn and we change we take it to life will start T testifying and God is willing to do that he's just taking you to on a trap to see what you're going to do he took them to that trap isra it seemed like the nature is itself the nature was hiding his face God likes to do it he likes to show his power he likes to do it he's waiting for that man this woman bad reputation he wants to change that to a holy woman God can do it you ain't going do it not me who's going to do God it's to God to change bad reputation to get back that young woman who made a bad choice who follow a wrong way to get them back only God can do it he wants to manifest his power only can do it only God can do it not a man can do it not even a woman can do it it's only God's capacity to do it he wants that man who's dying from cancer a man that's suffering from his heart Who blind he can only place his faith God can put his faith in that person and the situation will be Chang yes my brother in the message exod preaching 19 paragraph 26 in paragraph 28 he says he says look at he say say first of all he says Moses started to pray he came down to the Red Sea and he he came forward and the Lord put down and that makes an escape to uh to the Red Sea oh how God always makes a way he said in every trials he will always make a way of his stand still don't go to jumping Don't Be Afraid just stand still and know that I am God and when the tries and the remember that it's God trying to demonstrate his love but remember no matter how many red SE there was God's way went through it no matter how many rates God sees and he saw a going through the the [Music] SE others sees obstacles God's way God's path went I believe were in the time of Moses and some of us could say it's now that we understand that Moses is you know that you're not worthy to leave how could you leave all other ways that can take us to the promised land you taking us to the and you telling us that God told me to leave you can God lead us so it was man's Wisdom but God his path went through it didn't see Israel going to a different way but the only way that God provided that he has to go through he has to go through the Red Sea it was a trial it was a r and C was dark that when they were going when the Army OFA started to follow them there were Wilderness FR of them the and the people started cryes why have you done to us why have you done to us God told Moses he says Moses why all these cries speak he sayses why all this cry God told says lift up your s to the Red Sea and God could see his his way going through the the every that happen in your life it's a path God wants to manifest that's why we got to be solid we got to be Spirit understand every difficulty it's not the devil we start looking for going to the house of and seeing people tell me a little bit what's going on in my life tell me my my auntie from Afric crafting me tell me tell me no brother every difficulty every difficulty that it's not always sat God sufferings trials and Peter say say I enjoy the Lord because the trials are worthy than God Tri for more than God how much I would like this morning to be to be in front of CH that's tried tasted by God a got a church that put this AR and that protect himself by faith and when the devil and they protect Faith they put and Faith protect all [Music] theet comes and hit ands down we not afraid we not shaking I like that church a church that don't complain a church that doesn't sh a church that's not church that's not stable but a church that's stable stabilized by the rock of age Christ the word of this day the man of our time this word a word that was revealed form in the form of a prophet a major prophet that Reed commission Moses received to get Israel out ofday receive the same commiss to get the out of tradition tradition get them to Christ who is the word the word made FLH Among Us that's Mal for nation I'm going slowly I didn't even start touching those things the time will come going slowly we're not in a hurry in the month of June I will be here we will have all time talk about those deep things because y'all know that a church doesn't know his position doesn't know who she is it's easy to be uh to but what made us is this word God in human FLH that what made then I cannot I can leave front of any situation because because I [Music] byi anybody but the message of the this message ofel manifest Christ himself on Earth in a body of human being manifesting as the Messiah the word anointing for the age Brothers don't be afraid don't be afraid the prophet said what is the word he said a person who's anointed and in his last day God has anointed the person from his all and his and when that word could stand in front of people because let me tell you this random he hears the word of God in this last day I want to see how the Pentecost is how they're going to [Music] react is the word of God in this time are you adult enough are you adult can I move on it seems a little let me say again Willam he is God on this last day now I want to see the Pentecost now the little children I want to explain to you those little children those Baby P you explanation let me explain to you the prophet of God said when Moses was in in front of Israel and he had the veil upon his head in his face the prophet said Moses was God for Israel and when he has that word before revealing that word Moses was God for Israel and when Moses when the glory was living he would become new [Applause] Moses are you well seated you will see now let's actualize in this last day he veiled God he was the temple of God that has toif he had to manifest God glory in the end time now hear this William Bram he was born in a difficult condition in a poor family people without in Kentucky it was in April 6 poor people who was in RS the picture it was a do picture God in last he chose that picture he chose that family people without worth and God he wants to make William build on William brandom a big name a great name oh brothers and sisters God by his grace he made William BR our absolute William William is our absolute how brother Isaiah says he's going to make us run with these things little children if you can run God will send and we will [Music] work you can sayy I am not a Pentecost but I'm a Pentecost to stand and preach I has to be a Pentecost I has to experience a Pentecost that way then I become a pente I know what I'm talking about God can rebuild on old was where people see without when people where people say you can't God can rebuild from there God can grant you your heart's desire where people neglected you what God has made will I can remember the time people could not speak to me because I came from a bad family poor people with bad reputation because my my my my drunk and people didn't want to in order for someone to they had to look around to look at us and they could talk to me but if somebody else could come and the person would run away from me was in that condition when David told I took you from the the the ships to make your name a great name and today William rand's name great among his people and I believe in my brothers and sisters that it's not for that God has done this because that was following something with you and I that's why he has done this that's why God he could send us a great prophet in this range because he could see he saw us and remember you're also Malachi 4 Mal is not just brother BR as I told you in Prophecy here I'll send you there's three people in there's a I am who's God there's a you it's us and there elij the three people concerned in your to restore your heart to the and there's somebody who has to do it Prophet William my brothers and sisters where I went to end 1249 I want to finish with this stay well because we this where we [Music] finish in question and answer number one in 1964 in paragraph 157 it says uh no 157 question here's the question in 1964 it say he say he says now they ask a question it's the question 248 paragraph 57 found the question 2 248 he says the third pool is speaking the word the person ask the question says it seems so possible to you to pronounce to speak the word and for someone to be completely restored and made perfect ready for the Rapture in the time of Resurrection it says the son of man is it so or not I don't know if you understand the question you didn't understand I
