[42:13] i guess i feel like brother branham
[42:18] [Music]
[42:30] [Music]
[42:42] some of your minds we had been
[42:45] discussing at times about
[42:47] trying to move the church and do
[42:48] something of that nature and
[42:51] of course that's out of the picture now
[42:53] we're just going to stay here till jesus
[42:55] come
[42:56] uh jesus
[42:59] [Music]
[43:09] yeah we're not trying to put a stress
[43:11] [Music]
[43:25] god is good amen
[43:26] [Music]
[43:27] hallelujah we're just going to go right
[43:29] into the word of god it's all one prayer
[43:31] upon the jew
[43:36] there's a lot of things that are on my
[43:38] heart yeah
[43:40] she won't care
[43:42] and i kind of started this little
[43:43] message there in des moines
[43:48] but i want to add i've added more to it
[43:52] yeah i believe that we're in a time
[43:58] a time where we we must
[44:03] uh we must redeem the time
[44:07] amen
[44:12] turn with us amen to
[44:16] second timothy the fourth chapter
[44:20] bladder
[44:41] second timothy the fourth chapter
[44:43] and we're going to read the eighth verse
[45:03] henceforth
[45:04] there is laid up for me a crown of
[45:07] righteousness
[45:09] which the lord the righteous judge
[45:12] shall give me at that day
[45:15] and not to me only
[45:18] but unto all them also that love
[45:22] is appearing
[45:28] here
[45:40] amen let us pray
[45:44] our heavenly father personalist once
[45:46] again we thank you for your grace for
[45:48] the peace
[45:50] we thank you for your mercy
[45:53] we thank you for all that you have done
[45:56] for us
[45:58] lord
[46:05] and we're so grateful to you lord
[46:08] recon
[46:09] father we pray that you bless each and
[46:11] every house
[46:49] well we are certain that this message is
[46:52] a hundred percent right
[46:54] some
[47:00] [Music]
[47:12] and i don't know about you but i'm
[47:14] willing to do both of them
[47:21] we know the scripture according to
[47:23] matthew 25.
[47:26] where there were five wives and five
[47:28] foolish virgins we have they sang from
[47:30] sahaja yog from fall
[47:33] the five that was wise
[47:36] had all an extra oil in the lamps
[47:41] and the other five
[47:44] a lesotho is our word considered foolish
[47:48] considering the fall
[47:50] because she did not discern the time
[47:54] and so therefore she was very slawful
[47:57] and she is a tale about making sure she
[48:00] had all in her lamp
[48:05] so i want to encourage everybody today
[48:10] because often times when we we we think
[48:13] to ourselves
[48:16] because we are the message
[48:18] in the song because
[48:33] because you feel quiet
[48:34] you have already been deceived
[48:38] because the spirit of laodicea
[48:40] fascinates me
[48:41] it's not a time nor is it a place
[48:46] but it is a spirit message dentistry
[48:50] amen amen and so we know by god's grace
[48:55] did you brother branham has been gone
[48:57] for about 56 years
[49:01] i thank god for the prophet of god
[49:04] for the prophet the truth i thank the
[49:05] lord for all that he did to you
[49:10] but i know that when the prophet left
[49:12] the scene
[49:28] but
[49:42] that anointed elijah
[49:45] will also anoint elijah
[49:49] is that right
[49:52] many people
[49:54] believe in different ways
[49:58] and they have a right to do so he's only
[50:00] out of the currency
[50:02] but
[50:04] our right ears
[50:07] that we must love one another knew their
[50:09] phone is amazing regardless
[50:22] it's not
[50:23] your faith
[50:26] in what you think you believe
[50:31] but divine love
[50:35] a vindication
[50:38] from god himself did you remember
[50:41] because it's not something
[50:44] that you can make up okay
[50:46] yeah understand me
[50:48] we have been fighting
[50:52] in this message
[51:01] he speaks of the systems that the
[51:03] laodiceans
[51:05] are governed by
[51:17] [Music]
[51:31] adam had to make a choice
[51:48] seems
[52:01] what the church says
[52:03] secondly
[52:04] versus what the word says
[52:08] sometimes it's what the brother says the
[52:10] force is
[52:11] over what the word says
[52:15] but brother tells us
[52:29] all the things
[52:43] even our way of thinking
[52:47] must change
[52:49] hallelujah amen because we are free
[52:52] basking
[52:53] we are not people that are in bondage
[52:57] to no man
[53:12] in order to remain free
[53:15] you must be able to hear the voice of
[53:17] god
[53:20] amen amen because those who are led by
[53:24] the spirit
[53:38] our bodies must be surrendered to god
[53:53] surrender to god
[54:06] so much closer okay sometimes
[54:18] [Music]
[54:22] don't know
[55:13] [Music]
[55:29] you know brother adam said it like this
[55:31] improving his word from
[55:34] he said uh
[55:36] the true believers
[55:40] he said he proves his word
[55:44] not by those who say they believe
[55:46] paparazzi
[56:14] because you understand basketball it is
[56:17] the make-believer the song
[56:20] with the word
[56:23] hallelujah but when you truly believe
[56:26] the word
[56:28] the
[56:30] [Music]
[56:40] we've been encouraged by paul right now
[56:54] y'all agree with that
[56:56] this is his
[57:10] in
[57:21] because this is the time
[57:23] the preparation so
[57:26] hallelujah
[57:27] lay of the seer has been spewing out of
[57:29] his mouth
[57:31] we've entered into an eternal age
[57:35] and brother branham said this bride is
[57:37] the next
[58:20] always
[58:32] god
[58:34] is always there
[58:36] je to jolla for our defense to another
[58:39] defense
[58:41] amen hallelujah amen
[58:44] now
[58:47] it's difficult
[59:02] hallelujah amen let me explain something
[59:05] to you listen more of the speaking this
[59:07] perfection set perfection cannot be
[59:10] processed
[59:12] in your mind
[59:14] because we do not know
[59:24] so when god drops perfection in you
[59:27] allah
[59:43] amen because it is with the heart i
[59:46] think look here we have vision
[59:49] vision
[59:51] a man sees
[59:54] love of war his heart
[59:56] doesn't care not these parts
[1:00:40] she's
[1:00:48] why don't you wipe
[1:00:50] these kind of people off the face
[1:00:54] of the
[1:01:07] because you and i could never reach
[1:01:09] perfect love
[1:01:12] looking through the natural senses
[1:01:16] and judging our brothers
[1:01:21] we must learn
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:02:04] hallelujah and what god is saying to the
[1:02:07] prophet of god
[1:02:10] come behind the door
[1:02:14] let me show you hey listen what the
[1:02:16] that you'll know better than this woman
[1:02:18] over here
[1:02:32] it's the same
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:13] jesus christ the
[1:03:52] that's why he let her do what she was
[1:03:55] doing
[1:03:56] because
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:25] let's use the woman
[1:04:26] when she wear makeup
[1:04:28] elevate the makeup she's a cover-up
[1:04:32] there's something
[1:04:33] there's something she's hiding
[1:04:37] not just because she want to be
[1:04:38] beautiful
[1:04:39] but there is something she's hiding
[1:04:42] and she wants to give you a different
[1:04:44] impression
[1:04:48] what's inside
[1:04:51] them hallelujah is that right
[1:04:54] gee that's the way church is due
[1:04:56] circumcision we will put a make-up on
[1:04:59] them we will carry on in services
[1:05:02] everything is fine
[1:05:05] just to give the visitors
[1:05:19] the love of god
[1:05:31] feel the love of god
[1:05:48] control
[1:05:58] amen
[1:05:59] hallelujah
[1:06:02] giving your whole body to god
[1:06:06] we don't have respect to a person none
[1:06:08] of a person respected a person but i'm
[1:06:11] just going to turn to matthew 9 16. you
[1:06:13] can just write it down if you like
[1:06:29] you need
[1:06:35] well you know
[1:06:36] i i i do believe this
[1:06:39] and maybe i'm wrong but this is what i
[1:06:41] believe and and and i believe in having
[1:06:44] assurance it's more than a belief
[1:06:50] call me to the ministry
[1:06:54] and my my whole desire a monday is to
[1:06:58] preach
[1:07:10] as far as the mysteries
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:40] because he knows now what they are right
[1:07:42] now
[1:07:45] not revelation now
[1:07:50] so you understand what i'm saying
[1:07:53] the devil saw legion i mean legion saw
[1:07:56] christ
[1:07:59] coming elon viveni
[1:08:02] it wasn't the natural man he was afraid
[1:08:04] of
[1:08:05] in a temper
[1:08:08] was not afraid of what he saw
[1:08:10] legends
[1:08:12] when he saw the body of christ
[1:08:16] but he knew that he said in that
[1:08:18] tabernacle
[1:08:21] fullness
[1:08:35] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:08:43] [Applause]
[1:08:49] but when you begin
[1:09:18] this
[1:09:32] when you don't
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:11] you're getting quiet on me
[1:10:13] see because
[1:10:42] you better hear what i'm saying because
[1:10:44] if you let the devil take your children
[1:10:48] guaranteed you're going to get them
[1:10:54] won't be nobody's fault
[1:11:00] and let me tell you something even if
[1:11:01] you're not going to teach them at home
[1:11:03] civilization
[1:11:05] you ought to at least have a sunday
[1:11:06] school here to be honest
[1:11:16] we have allowed ourselves to be selfish
[1:11:38] is
[1:11:40] don't do this
[1:11:42] it'll be a two second you should do it
[1:11:43] first don't do that
[1:11:44] never see don't do this
[1:11:47] and don't do that
[1:11:49] and you're not teaching them
[1:11:52] you are correct
[1:12:05] if you don't teach them
[1:12:08] the word
[1:12:09] they will come to love the world
[1:12:13] why because that world nature is in them
[1:12:18] it's already in them
[1:12:20] hallelujah
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:30] amen hallelujah
[1:12:34] you know there's a time
[1:12:37] you have anton
[1:12:40] brother branham he looked at his natural
[1:12:42] parents as being his parents
[1:12:47] but one day he said i'm no longer the
[1:12:50] the children of ella
[1:12:52] and i can't remember the daddy's name
[1:12:59] a change
[1:13:01] had taken place
[1:13:16] and that's where god is trying to take
[1:13:18] us it's like a juvenile back to the
[1:13:21] original father
[1:13:24] original hallelujah amen is that the
[1:13:26] truth
[1:13:27] back to the original fight
[1:13:43] religion is not going
[1:14:05] now let me finish let me read this
[1:14:06] scripture
[1:14:08] matthew 9 16
[1:14:10] no man
[1:14:12] putteth a piece of new cloth
[1:14:14] onto an old garment
[1:14:17] for that which is put in to fill it up
[1:14:21] taketh from the garment
[1:14:24] and rent
[1:14:25] is made worse you don't know what i'm
[1:14:28] saying
[1:14:30] says
[1:14:54] and my mama would would put a patch on
[1:14:56] it
[1:15:00] back in that day patches were not in
[1:15:02] style
[1:15:03] um
[1:15:10] oftentimes the patch that she would put
[1:15:13] on that on the pad
[1:15:18] would never be the same color of the
[1:15:20] pants
[1:15:36] a piece of garment
[1:15:39] a new piece of garment
[1:15:43] hallelujah you understand me
[1:15:45] so that's how it is with the message
[1:15:51] change from the inside out the lantern
[1:15:54] here alex you're trying to put that new
[1:15:56] something hello
[1:16:01] and it makes it worse
[1:16:04] that's
[1:16:18] you've got
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:32] into all bottles you met down there
[1:16:37] is that right
[1:16:38] in other words a lot of them put new
[1:16:41] wine in old bottles
[1:16:46] the bottles
[1:17:31] got a lot of quiet work folks this
[1:17:33] morning
[1:17:34] but i'd rather for you to be quiet and
[1:17:36] thinking about what's being said
[1:17:38] i wouldn't take it
[1:17:53] i'm trusting that somehow
[1:17:56] how could i say it like i'm gonna say it
[1:17:57] like brother brown said it
[1:17:59] basically he said
[1:18:01] christ should be so much in you
[1:18:05] when people see you
[1:18:07] jesus
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:25] you be wouldn't you rather
[1:18:28] would wouldn't you rather

[1:29:12] ma come and bless you
[1:29:15] as in today not in rioting and
[1:29:17] drunkenness not in chambering and

[1:30:27] lot of y'all thinking i'm going to go
[1:30:28] the other way but no
[1:30:32] is that right the bible said it is the
[1:30:34] little foxes
[1:30:37] the little foxes
[1:30:39] the spores the vine

[1:30:59] basket

[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:03] we know that if you miss the rapture
[1:32:05] that's horrific it's no secret
[1:32:13] and because we all have come out
[1:32:16] because we've all come out of
[1:32:18] denominations
[1:32:24] it's not good enough it's a system
[1:32:26] coming out is not good enough
[1:32:29] the most important part
[1:32:31] is going into say
[1:32:35] going into andre
[1:32:37] millions came out of egypt the
[1:32:51] we can't take it for
[1:32:52] granted because jesus christ is the same
[1:32:56] person yesterday
[1:32:57] today and forever
[1:32:59] he can't change for you
[1:33:03] you must change for him

[1:34:55] manage

[1:36:11] that's a spirit sustainable and it puts
[1:36:15] preachers in positions
[1:36:19] if they would fall
[1:36:23] it would be like a bowling ball
[1:36:27] the rolling ball
[1:36:29] hitting the pins

[1:36:32] and striking
[1:36:34] you understand
