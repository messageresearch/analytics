your hands in the precious and memorized names of jesus christ of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen we grace you in the precious name of the lord jesus christ and we appreciate the presence of each and every one of you and we apologize because we came late on a matching element now we win-win today we [Music] [Music] we shall read the scriptures foreign [Music] [Music] everything that happened to him or in his life he was always late and he also released people from the church late i'm praying for god not to take me earlier on but he should take me later on that's my prayer yes and i think it's a prayer of each and every one of you we shall read from one period chapter five we shall read in the name of jesus [Music] [Music] amen so we shall read from one period chapter five verse five to five six two six to eleven therefore humble yourself under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for his care for he cares for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour resist him steadfast in the faith knowing that the same suffering are experienced by your brother by a brotherhood in the world but may the god of all grace who call us to his eternal glory by christ jesus after you have suffered a wild perfect establish strengthen and settle you to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever amen amen i'm going to pray again our lord and our father we just read your word context again give us the understanding put me away lord and speak to your people they didn't come to see me for the jew but they are thirsty to see god and only god said come down lord hey and speak for your own glory jesus christ in the name of the lord jesus our god amen amen you may be seated javed to i'll entitle my little subject this morning it's over the promotion of devil no more promotion of devo or satan no more devil promotion yeah oh no more promoting satan hello [Music] who has called you in jesus christ to his eternal glory after you have suffered a while perfectionist is going to perfect you is going to strengthen you is going to fortify you and he's going to make it perfect for the day of christ it's for you to understand my brothers that is not a man who have called us not our father who is called us need our motto accord us to the word of god but he's god of all grace he's the one of god that's jesus christ not to something else but he has called us to the glory to the eternal glory and it's god who's going to strengthen us why did he say he's going to strengthen us what did he say is going to stress it's because we we may have some witnesses but when the weaknesses shall come just know one thing he has called us to the eternal glory i thank you remember so [Music] like for you to understand the second news i don't expect it that would be the basis on which you're going to be here and when if you are all watchful uh peter said after you have suffered a little while on the suffering we're not going to suffer every time and peter but just for a while second that's what peter said and it's what is written in the bible and if it's written in the bible it's the word of god and as it which is god has provided us to suffer a little while remember but it's only god who knows that little white suffering i can look at you and say you always say but for god it's just for a real one william said okay when christ was dying upon the cross and that's the day he overcome the sin killer he overcome sickness death and the we fighting with an enemy who's already overcome the chaplain approved the force the devil have got no strength in it he will have strength and power only the one that should be here but i want you to be watched for this one company for you to understand his death was the i would like you to say amen to that remain first that's instead of us or praising our advantage thank you we are there praising the enemy who's already overcome muammar oh my sickness i got after we have suffered a little while remember but himself the lord jesus christ perfection he is going to perfect yes my brothers and sisters i returned let us stop promoting the devil matthew sir my brothers and sisters listen to what william brown is saying he said that let them one in the preaching witnesses say program 37 satan secretly that's how the devil is coming [Music] he's gonna let you build a little bit of fear somewhere then it's going to increase that fear destruction is or losing the steps making somebody lose [Music] assurance by doing some act which is what's gonna bring him fear hello and it's going to start taking away or the assurance by telling you the umbrella i'm saying the reason is just because you let him do that never let the devil do that in you election is the emblem he's just a bluff and one legalized [Music] and god have taken the power to the church we manifest that yes my brothers and sisters [Music] have taken the soul from devil hands [Music] this morning he said the devil is nobody else than a liar in a corner it explodes he just or says something and explores himself that's the way i want you to understand certain enemies it's an enemy who's already overcome the grimace but he's just making some noise so you'll never stop him from making it they took the person that's why anyway the devil gonna make noises he said all the knowledge that is making is the thunders there is noise are the thunders without lightning those standards will never kill you explosive in the prophet he may explode he may shout out he can come and make it but it's just making the noise without lightning happening remember full surveillance unfortunately you've got the soul of god in your hands i cannot come back with you gonna fight the devil women yes my brother sisters william promised some food he's making the thunders without prayer i'm assuring him the the tunnels of the lord jesus christ they're going to place their their reality they're going to bring back the soul of man they'll have super smart them all and from the groaning of death say they say shows that they asked god gonna pull you from all those uh wealthy things to tonight the power of the thunders of the lord jesus christ gonna take somebody out of the slavery to and to bring this person to call things that are not there like they are dead better take everything maybe you didn't get what i'm saying the devil will come with these thoughts that's the thunders without life that you don't know that's your security by the power of the thalamus of the lord jesus them like they exist by the blood of the lord and called to come and put aside the neglect the church [Music] what i'm [Music] and that thing belongs to me dear [Music] it can take you out of the slavery [Music] that came to you this uh this afternoon has tried to push you in a tomb early on film this demon try to make you [Music] contest but just read this incontestable uncontestable uh [Music] today the holy ghost is righteous the lord of god is going to cast him out confident and they're going to vanitarian things it's just the lord jesus christ the sanctuary but just ring the lord jesus christ just bring him the center of things and see if something is not going to happen the angel of god is going to take position and these demons going to flee away you may stand there and say we miss you yes sir celebrity it's true memphis yes sir [Music] reality in the world [Music] [Music] uh he said i never had fear even the little dot of fear in my life did he pass in the cellar for if i could have fear say freely then i would run that time but i'm assuring you christopher what when jesus christ anoint you for not to them you are not made with a material that can run away i don't know if you understand that if you can see if i had fear shall free i would run by the grace of god and celebrate [Music] the devil may come in your life explosive he may explode in your life he may make knowledge in your life since you should kiss the fool but if the lord jesus christ and wherever you are you are now married with the material that are not going to run yes my brother and sister say my ten months this morning my my sister this morning my brother say americans i would like you to understand the material that you are made with the material that cannot run away don't defend that promotion and just stop from promoting the development for the devil shall come out he will do some noise we are not men with the material that can run away remember the lord himself [Music] be angry at him and say satan satan especially such a nothing person you are a liar i'm just come a liar and standard never run because god has made you all unshakeable yes my brothers and sisters celebrity is true shall you acquire mankind i believe it will work out promotion just be long that you've been promoting the heaven he knows in our life we have taken his sickness like this the devil came in our life we're suffering and we've taken no suffering and made it massive our belongings my sickness my suffering my problem the back of the children he was the master he was the chief dominator he was the master was the uh overcoming people as long as the trump wasn't sounded yet well memphis that sir my brothers the devil had the power on them to unpack the sun but once the trumpet is sounding that compared to you should be late the trumpet the truth is first and there's no strength basket god's the trumpet of sounds bringing us into life his problem is done we met first yes my brother sisters what i'm saying he said jesus is doing those three things once the shout of none of the plague is falling in israel millions of problems but their problems say that the applicant sin was to apply the talking listen and he didn't apply the token the plague was going to fall upon you better now but now israel israel was there goshen gathered in in ghosts they had a prophet [Music] [Music] we just thank the lord for the present time and that age is not uh is not over yet and god is shouted again and isha doesn't just go into a spiritual uh scripture people ears don't keep that you by the shout of god send a person my increased spiritual is not just the spiritual shout out the message in the person spiritually and the message is not just and his child is not only in the there's spirit on the spirit of people but even [Music] but it's also for one time a prophet in the united found god once more [Applause] and i'm sorry just be that's the message when that messenger the prophet shall speak and those who are going to receive that prophet and some people know in his own quality of prophecy they shall receive all the privileges of that ministry and those who are going to listen to him shall be blessed and there will be a part of the last bride of this man my brother sister prophet when that prophet when he will shall speak [Music] the privileges of his ministry that's why you compensate i would like you to understand this morning that everything we want god has blessed beneficial matter you the beneficiary of that remember him those who are going to listen to this messenger they will be blessed if they can try to cool it down a little bit because it's hot [Music] do you don't have to doubt about it not just to be blessed but there will be a power set they will be part of the last bride of the day secretly prophet hadid that's what the prophet says secular this is a second judge and what he said that's what god says what branham said that's what god said i will never believe other things [Music] [Music] that if people could receive the true revelation of the true church what church is able to do the second represent of what the church represents taking the power completely ground the server and he said the check and do make or do the great works then this church it shall be the invincible amendment once you've got the revelation of what you hear what you are supposed to say you've got a revelation of the deity of the lord jesus christ the revelation of who's this man of william branham and the devil will never do anything again yes my brothers and sisters listen now i would like to read this book so that it can mean it can do good to us listen to this on the message experience is saying or in the preaching experience three [Music] that's the unique thing that can do good to you vodka for foreign your faith in god foreign you see what i want to say son of worse impossible you should understand that it's your faith which is the unique thing that can do good to you and what i'm saying in the conflict between satan and god you're saying perhaps 62. whoever you meet with him okay wherever you meet the enemies say the power looking for you chili says you gotta use this word of god and jesus demonstrated when he fight with the devil he kept his children with the word of god common protection like protection against the enemy when your battle shall come [Music] [Music] we going forward with what we can find today knowing that their fault is already immediate and we're fighting with the enemy who's already over there come back the only thing that they uh the christian can fight with their sigil is that the lord remember and god himself already said thousands can follow your right or ten thousand on your left but you'll [Music] [Music] [Music] how can we be there complaining and accusing which uh each and every one of us what i'm living today oh my younger brother have done today [Music] i'm telling you that in africa there's people that are so kind where are we coming from there are people so kind yes the kindness that is in africa oh they john and turn africa people are so kind in africa yes such a point with their kindness he can he can wash the chicken of his neighbor with a hot water then the police come in and arrest him

can say no in africa there's kind people that are kind and african addiction there are so kind people in africa [Music] as if we've been created only one person in the world the suffering is not but it's not that time or where you if he has protested you to drink to the cup of trials you will drink those from that cup membership and it's true but the will of that human being that was not created the one mighty god elohim powerful in the bible shall die who brought us upon i pray from there he takes you from a push to the side by his own will it says by the advice of his own will amen is [Music] [Music] transformation until it drowned the last the last drop ancient maria a young man who just started his life he lose his wife a personal and god was still existing is [Music] that i can fight the devil in hong kong no matter where i meet with him yes my brother and sisters forever jesus said i'm saying this this is sick he's saying [Music] what is he doing and he stand first to the word of god and this picture of the angel of the world is going to make fear all the devils healing two times in heaven yes set the photos this picture of the angel of the lord that all kind of proof that can be brought up and god is proven here yes my brother sisters now listen to this i've got about 15 minutes but i'm saying i recognize he was talking about the the the board of israel in egypt and what is here is may god be praised [Music] [Music] [Music] and when i look back and see what happens what i'm saying my heart is full of choices to know that at a certain moment this temple in which i'm living shall be destroyed [Music] and i have one that is waiting for me now for now be careful you say i'm trying to take all the people they later here to shape these people to take them away from the things that are in the world [Music] [Music] sir there was a sister she attained my heart was sick cancer and she had cancer el avila cancer she had cancer effect abandoned she was forsaken by herself doctors just let her left her there to die [Music] she had no hope she came today to the end of her thought maybe it's a condition in which you can find yourself or maybe one of your children who left them or maybe one of the family members may say i just know this my brothers when we're getting to the end of our minds that medical insurance sir and that's it she was for second by the way and she heard this picture of the angel of the lord that's why wherever you go but the lord jesus christ accepted [Music] all the demons the pill of fire kills all the demons you know some parallels so we're not the worshipers of williamsport jesus existed even before jesus itself coming flesh upon the earth but if there is a person a body that we can worship is this body no matter what god have done in the life of william branham william branham remained the mission of god but he only had privileges that the almighty god who said it so i'm gonna repeat himself saying that [Music] of william god has helped me to have a balance in the world where william branham when he balance things i'm going to balance it as well so it's like that now but now listen no matter
