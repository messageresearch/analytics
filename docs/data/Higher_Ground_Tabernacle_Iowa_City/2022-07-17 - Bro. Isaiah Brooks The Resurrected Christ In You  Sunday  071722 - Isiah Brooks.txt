yeah yeah as we stand the way i do but one thing for certain i know he's here certainly i'm only saying this because you can get whatever you desire from the lord this morning forget about particle here at the honoring of our brother yesterday the funeral service i think it was bro yes and i just thought by god's grace i'll i am a junkie when it comes to the anointing there's nothing like it excuse me uh the eleventh chapter saint john shapiro owns the 25th verse verse 7 sank jesus said unto her i am the resurrect and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead [Music] whoever second chapter seven through the twelfth verse second chapter first second chapter the 7th to the 21st oh the panther division ascent you just got those you're there it's hula but we speak the wisdom of can we change this mic please history even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the foundation glory which none of the princes which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory [Music] but as it is written i have not seen nor heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god have prepared for them that love him my community says but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god make the is jew but what more what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god alone now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god oh we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being here lord oh god no money or any riches can ever afford your presence [Music] [Music] we pray this morning that you're perfect and the divine will will be done i have learned lord jesus of our peace and yeah that i personally have no ability more amen amen you may be seated there are so many things on my heart this morning and i trust by the grace of god that god will be able to utter through me the words of life that he you need to hear i'd like to entitle this message the resurrection of christ in you the resurrection of christ my question this morning what is your revelation of the message because your understanding and your revelation of it what god did in our day secretary it's beyond all ages and the real truth of the message has come to a selected [Music] what it was all about when jesus christ died and rose again many of us before coming to this light [Music] we worship jesus christ according to traditions tradition even though the word of god says ma'am see all about that that god is looking for those who will worship him in spirit and in truth i thank god for his faithfulness many of us take the message lightly and [Music] it is this generation generation it is this message that will produce jesus christ in a way that it will cause a resurrection resurrection hallelujah amen this is not some religion this is god hiding himself in simplicity [Music] in such a way i tell point you only those who have been chosen by god said my secret will be able to see the move of god movement hallelujah every but the people of every age they had substance in substance they had representation they had god amen delivering them by way [Music] he just did not call luther only in a person but god had predestinated it those who could have an ear to hear the message of luther [Applause] and they thought because god brought them out they were the ultimate of the age he's a different master failed to see that god was moving on what [Music] there's got to be more god somewhere what you've watched they began [Music] hallelujah was a messenger they were messengers of god hallelujah the wesleyans moved into what we call the pentecostal then come the pentecostals god began to restore the gifts hallelujah amen they're speaking in tongues miracles god began to do a mighty word [Music] [Music] his sick is a vegan it was preserved preserved for you and me hallelujah when the message of the hour came hallelujah but one thing i am saying that in short if they are seen there see he had the sense of god is not moving on them hallelujah they did go into the systematic worship hallelujah and when they defined it the holy ghost as the uh speaking in tongues of the holy ghost right there he's so muggler what are you saying there were many people who spoke in tongues you see the holy ghost and the tongue of a shoe hallelujah but the tongue is not the shoe hallelujah you understand what i'm saying i'm trying to bring you to a place i mean because what we did in this message that's the second zone instead of going all the way over said i said it's better going into the promised land oh yeah hold on because i'm gonna preach it instead of going all the way with god some of us are not god will go back and we put picked up all of pentecostals habits systematic worship oh come on somebody am i see what we must realize [Music] he could not preach what they preached in pentecost there had to be another message this is the hour of perfection this is the hour of moving into adoption this is not a religion this is christ himself this is a christian let me only provide a place of worship this is the holy ghost the only provided place of worship it's christ himself he's the women hallelujah it's not your church buildings your bishop said your pope hallelujah there's one place god requires a man to worship him in the name of jesus christ he's the only true god he's the only god hallelujah [Music] amen hallelujah amen we spent so much of our time forever complete submission oh don't get quiet on me now see we used him as an escape goat we used him as a covering hallelujah you better listen this is the spirit talking you don't god took something he did something in our day i'm gonna tell you something if you don't believe what i'm preaching here listen to the messages hallelujah after the seals will open hallelujah the messages change change from elijah [Music] occupy the pride of jesus christ hallelujah is that right the very works he did yesterday it's supposed to be done today the body of jesus christ of jesus christ hallelujah amen hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we got to understand this is not a religion hallelujah amen you see all of us know all of us know what the jews and dunks are the message hallelujah you you you we all of us don't all of us do excuse me all of us do know all the do's and don'ts of the message hallelujah you can [Music] hello somebody this is not something you practice says it is something you are born hallelujah amen you don't need a teacher on the chalkboard writing all the laws down for you because the greatest law of all laws basketball is the conquering force of today [Music] to people listen the prophet god is saying in the message god chosen place of worship brother said it like this his promise service will be interpreted in you by him interpreted in the word that he promised to fulfill in the day [Music] but what [Music] these signs get shall follow them that believe she wants to create that speaks through you yes he didn't say me he said through you he spoke of this agenda what would be now hallelujah amen this is a message after the seal so you can't you don't have anything so [Music] what he promised today [Music] yesterday today and forever download message [Music] [Music] the world is still missing until we see jesus not on the wall in a painting hallelujah a man not in the art gallery [Music] oh we must see him in you us against you jesus jesus jesus that's what we must see hallelujah amen and i'm not talking about israel just believing that jesus is the christ in your heart i'm talking about a upon the manifestation i'm tired of satan jesus fatigued satan coming in on the living saints of god kevier or sanders and defeating them [Music] some of y'all thinking about seeing a psychiatrist and while you seeing your psychiatrist he's seeing a psychiatrist [Music] there's only one prince of peace hallelujah and he's still alive listen let me ask you something how many of us can feel the presence [Music] of you if you can't feel his presence there's you [Music] the god translation somebody help me here i'm trying to i'm just going to quote this particular scripture i'm not going to read it [Music] because paul he said the sting of death is sin i don't know about you freed me from sin so if this thing of death is sin i don't see it and i have that god's blood of the blood of jesus christ has washed away all my sin then death has no victory over me he has no [Music] is [Music] don't [Music] amen hallelujah amen hallelujah is that right paul said but thanks be to god bless you ye steadfast film unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord now i'm going to bring you to something else because [Music] and you [Music] is a revelation because when the revelation of god comes [Music] i i meant hallelujah say this earlier christians don't have to practice righteousness you're born of righteousness you're born of righteousness [Music] so you understand what i'm saying you've never seen a dog go to school and shanky to learn how to bark upon let me ask you something what you've never seen a calf a little baby scream and say where is my mama that little calf knows you've always said where mama is now you say jesus christ is your husband and i've never met him it is where is your husband whoever mariello how can i believe you're married to him [Music] and you [Music] how can i believe you're married to jesus [Music] [Music] see you and i must understand this brother branham didn't say he was just married to him he was able to put him he was on the scene y'all felt funny when i said married to jesus but if you're the wife of jesus you must be married to him what time i'm fellowshipping with the mystery and the mystery is christ in you hallelujah amen you've got to know he's in there who the best of what clinton not based upon your feelings fascist but upon the revelation of god [Music] you become omnipotent [Music] this is what i try to tell people see the word of god says know ye not that you are the temple of god hallelujah and sometimes people say well i got to go to the church building to pray before the judge go to the church the bible said pray without ceasing pray wherever you are pray in your car wherever you are because you wake up people of god wake up would they ever ever hear people did you the devil don't want us to know these things you're afraid when you bring god out of heaven god will come in that's the way of the christian civil civil choir when you walk by the gate of beautiful silver and gold have i noticed that yes i have a second [Music] but what the early what we have done we've lost faith in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen that's what ephesians was talking about we see our brother branham nobody february and and i'm going back to him because i know brother branham could see what this message have turned into foreign and we want to point people to brother branham when brother branham pointed us to jesus christ elijah because when we preach the message brother branham preached we will get the same results brother brother god memorize you thank you for hallelujah we give credit and honor to the only living god he who's going so far today baptizing his name musa anybody that exhausts the profit higher than jesus christ if you don't like me if you don't agree with me but the truth is there is no other name amen amen if you want to see a resurrection it won't be william branham resurrecting you san diego jesus christ resurrection and some you know so many people you know we exalt his name so hard to if you say anything about brother branham that most people don't agree with they go like oh you're getting rid of the blasphemy [Music] controversy listen what brother says see when i read his quotes godzilla it's the quotes from the son of man he was a son of man he was a prophet of our day but is what was speaking through him and bringing the message of our day i heard i heard it you said but the messenger and the messenger is the same message but that's supposed to be true in you too huh yeah i'ma shout hallelujah you know i know god is here i can't tell you what i'm feeling i know it's that god is trying to quicken us because you've been taught once you come to the message you got it that is wrong you got to be justified you've got to be sanctioned you got to be filled with the [Music] [Music] people just do what they and they kept doing what they wanted to do and god wouldn't allow them to go into this project somebody helped me here all right why because they had the wrong spirits amen hallelujah he says but now but in this day there is to come a super hero in super royal seed of abraham in semester wild abraham how many of y'all feel super confident you understand what i'm saying it's more than a mind game it's more than convincing yourself simply for confidence it's got to be more than that hallelujah wouldn't it sound strange if you saw a real lion and he would open his mouth to roar and you would get a meow [Music] [Music] like this he said many people you know they died from a heart attack did they get this young when the lion roared reminded us they become fast food when satan [Music] [Music] it has to be controlling you it can become really aggravating a little better to pull you back over you love what you're doing but it's placed in there for your protection what you the holy ghost is in you to protect you you sent the spirit of he is your preserver it's got to be a spiritual seed [Music] and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her omum that everybody different ones sold seeds right [Music] may know and thank you legend we got a hold of the seed we say oh my god we got it and we failed to see when new man called the vote it had to grow questions and because people couldn't see hey what was coming after the prophets leaving us many of them walked away hallelujah we're the pride of jesus christ she speaks to identify [Music] the paper supernatural filled with the holy ghost example it's more than shouting jesus hallelujah is that right you've got to believe this message whatever quarks in order to make a rapture who are they going to live tomorrow say brother brooks proved that the only way they believed the only way they missed noah's flood was to believe noah he told those pharisees scholars scholars a doctorate of divinities says well educated again he's told them except you believe that i am he i want you for you shall be likewise in your sin those of us who who's struggling with the money you will likewise [Music] you know we did that you know us message people no thank you on the message for the most part we made a cult out of it somebody ought to say hallelujah son the moment you say that if a person don't believe like i believe he's lost he said it proves that you're lost that's hmm you don't know the mind of god when you say paul up and say did you you don't know god what god is doing votes everybody under the affair elijah thought he was the only one elia he said people can go a long time not realizing they are they are the bride for a long time a long time but when they get it there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers my question is have your heart been shaken i'm not talking about it in your head because in your heart you would be late being laid by the holy spirit the apostolics lisa didn't have the written word and we don't know how long it took yeah circulate we don't know how long it took paul's letters to circulate to the churches hallelujah holy ghost message they were led by the spirit spirit [Music] we you'll never get there without prayer i can tell when it's working cause y'all get quiet it's your soul not mine your heart every man has to give an account for himself you know we've had some good times in this message good services here but you know right now and we'll have a message that'll run right straight back to the word again i can read but i'm gonna go ahead and preach it begin to talk about all of the things that were prophesied he talks about the whirlwind that came to him when he was a boy or the cabin cancellation he talked about in in in 1933 with the voice of god on on on the river that ohio when that voice said your message shall forerun the coming of the lord he talked about the seven angels i'm jumping a little bit the seven angels he said he had he had dreams god himself julie ma'am a 33 year old man with a white wig over his head formed by the wings of angels he didn't understand and when he turned it to the right [Music] and yet hey we got people in here knows i won't call it he hasn't come yet you can't take a picture of nothing on paper photos [Music] so [Music] malachi 4 come come and i shall mention god will be sinned hallelujah glory to god what did he do left it on tape let's [Music] that god has selected they shall be rushed hallelujah not just nobody because he made me who i am hallelujah i didn't we need to unveil him in this wicked generation we need to let the people know we are not ashamed of the power of god because the power of god is unto salvation [Music] omnipotent i'm going to take with the words if the word says i am a messiah jesus i'm gonna take what the word if the word says that i'm that want deliverance this morning you need to worship god don't be ashamed of the people don't let them confuse you they can't put you in heaven and neither can they take you out [Music] glory to god amen [Music] if he tells me to rise amen glory hallelujah [Music] what's the christ of his day glory moses was the christ foreign [Music] [Applause] with his spirit and that one disorder with his spirit alex honestly hallelujah amen amen glory brother said it like he said the same things that jesus did the bride is supposed to be we've got to stop new devon coming to church with that old formal spirit hallelujah amen is that right yes you're coming here with that old form of jesus ain't none foreign you become antichrist that formerly help me here amen god want to see some noise in this place if you really enjoy jesus so you got him for such to worship him [Music] you should never leave church feeling like you've never been to church with first time take up some of the police no some of y'all never been to a club i guess dancing club [Music] how are you doing sir oh come on miss you you doing okay today but when i left my country kid i was different i couldn't even say it you understand what i'm saying when i left because if you just anoint me [Music] amen hallelujah why aren't you oh there's let me read this last quote and then i'm gonna let y'all go somewhat excuse you i gotta say it the reality uh those of you who still drinking wine repair repair i might not see vision like brother branham but gossip i've seen where people have come to church and they just smoked reefer they don't even know god just whispered in his ears [Music] he's the peace he said well i do it for medication well that's a different story so the part of my money made it but none of y'all been to the doctors it must be a lot of folks [Music] jude because i don't say nothing doesn't mean i don't know nothing past question god to the pentecostal church of this day or ponticotist may lord those men be some of them present here but this is the calling forth of the bride faith i believe this faith i believe this jacquard foreign because it's revealed by your your spirit through the word of god because it's revealed by your spirit through the word of god and has been vindicated it's like a confirmation it may manifest to the world certainly look away let the people here think like the queen did in that in that in the days of the great destruction of babylon there is a man among you named daniel yeah do you know it was to resolve all your doubts bring you to a place that jesus christ is to say yes amen amen now i'm closing there management but i want to say by the grace of god you already apologize did you i got a little excited up here and uh but i want to i want you to uh trust you heard what was being said [Music] dance dancing is that right brother branham told a little story about two cows the two of the vash one cow in vash was cultured taken care of one was skinny uh and the other one was fat goss and the skinny cow was malnourished but the fat cow was so had eaten so much it was just fat a lavash over them and say the little skinny cow looked over at the fat cow he got there at least we ought to you know get in a place where we are accused to be fanatics that is yeah are we in closing for germany i want to say this if there be anybody who desired prayer willing to pray i can't do it if you don't believe what i'm saying listen to the message uh faith uh works as faith expressed sifu [Music] the healing comes from so we we look at these things and you say well brother brooks what are you saying i just want to see but people say well the revival is over oh the universal revival universe the bride revival is still on [Music] out of your life [Music] it's true it sometimes can be such a painful experience in his time in his time you make all things beautiful in his time [Music] lord please show me every day as you're teaching me your way you will do just [Music] in your time you make all things beautiful in your time lord please every day as you're teaching me your way [Music] such a lovely lovely name such a lovely lonely name the name of jesus such [Music] such a lovely lovely name the

him in bondage when they take but if you don't call him according to the revelation of this day he may not just answer you but when that woman said thou son of david [Music] [Music] how miserable will be if a translation takes place and we're left behind because we failed to act upon the things we've heard of i see what god has given me i see you once again i have a vision that's what brother gave
