TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] May the Lord bless you. May we stand up to start the service this morning. We are going to open our Bibles in the book of Luke 18. Luke 18, there was in a city a judge. We fear not God, neither regarded men. And there was a widow in that city. And she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary, and he will not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubled me, I will avenge her, lest by a continual coming she me." And the Lord say, hear what the unjust unjust judge said. And shall not God aven avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him. Though he bear along with them, I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth. May the Lord bless his word.

Are we happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Good job the musicians. &gt;&gt; And you have improved a lot on the drums. So, keep going. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh go straight to Malachi chapter 4. verse 4-6 or verse five. Let's say The Bible reads like this. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Amen. Let's go to Zechariah chapter 4. And this is going to be a lengthy reading. &gt;&gt; So I'll probably just read two verses and read two verses faster. And the angel that talked with me, Zechariah chapter 4. &gt;&gt; And the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is waking out of his sleep. And said unto me, what seeest thou? And I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top there. set lamp and two olive trees by each, one up on the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these? My Lord. Then the angel that talked with me u with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what this be?" And I said, "No, my lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain? before Zerubbabel, thou shalt become a plain, and ye shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it. Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you. Grass grass grass. Amen. Let's bow our head. &gt;&gt; If you have a need, just raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we come before you &gt;&gt; in your lovely name, the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] Lord, Father, Lord, we thank you for keeping us healthy and coming into your house this morning. And heavenly father Lord because you give us a promise that wherever two or three are gathered in your name you shall be there. Lord we are gathered here in the name of Jesus Christ. Father you've seen your children raise their hand and their request. Lord I pray that you supply it to their to their needs &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, Lord, I commit myself into your into your Lord. I pray that you take me out of the way and that you use this vessel for your glory. And I also pray that your Holy Spirit here through the congregation, Lord, and that only you may be glorified. Lord, if there's any spirit that doesn't confess your name, &gt;&gt; I rebuke it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. So, the title for my sermon is going to be a part two of the last sermon that I preached here. So, it's going to be called, "What do you say of the message of the hour?" Parts two. &gt;&gt; Last time we preached on the same message and I didn't quite finish it and I'm going to bring a different aspect of it today by God's grace. So what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; You know, remember last time I preached here, we we read that scripture where Jesus asked the disciples, who do you say that that I am? And that's the question that each and every one of you are asked this morning. What do you say of the message of the hour? Your answer will only be a true answer if you have the revelation because your intelligence cannot reveal to you what this message is. The prophet even says the ability to compare scriptures to scriptures will not give you the revelation of what you teach. It takes the revelation of the Holy Ghost. What is the message of the hour? What is the message of the hour to you? Don't say what is the message of the hour to my parents. The question is what is the message of the hour to you? Young sisters, young brothers, &gt;&gt; what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Why are you here this morning? Why couldn't you go to other churches? Why are you believing the message preached by a man? What proves to you that he was the messenger? Because Satan will come test and knowledge in you. Satan will come test a revelation in you because Jesus had a revelation of who he was. That's why he even said you can kill this body and in three days my father will raise it up. But Satan came in the wilderness and tempted Jesus. He wanted to know if Jesus truly had a revelation of who he was. And those same spirits are here testing the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Those same spirits want to know if you actually know who you are. Because the only way Satan has an advantage of you is if you are ignorant. Because the Bible says that my people die for lack of knowledge. But we are not talking about the knowledge of human mind. &gt;&gt; But we are talking about the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; What is the message of the hour? The message of the hour is a message of restoration. It's a message that came to bring us back to our the faith of our fathers. We just read in Malachi chapter 4 that the Bible says that the spirit of Elijah will have two ministries. &gt;&gt; You know the first part was already accomplished to John the Baptist and the second part is for the end time and the second part is talking about restoring us to the faith of our fathers. It's restoring you to your original position. It's restoring you to the position where you can speak things into existence. Restoring you into the true position as sons and daughters of God. So that the fruits that were in the book of Acts may also be in the church tonight. You know, the prophet says that if you have the Holy Ghost, then you're going to rewrite the book of act again. You know that's what the message of the hour came to do. It came to make sure that you brother Joseph are writing another book of acts. He came to make sure that each and everyone sitting this morning can write their own book of acts. You know when you read the book of acts you you got to feel special because you should also be able to write your own book of acts. Brothers if you are not able to write your own book of acts then the message of the hour has not been applied in your life yet because the book of acts it was truly the act of the holy ghost in the apostles. If you have the same Holy Ghost in you, you know Jesus says that the works that I do you shall also do. You know the Paul even says the gospel did not come in word only but it came in the demonstration with power. The Bible says these signs shall follow the believers. As if you are a believer the signs got to follow you. But you got to know the order. You are not following the signs. The signs follow you. So you cannot manufacture a sign because the signs only follow the believers. If in your life you don't have the signs of a believer. Maybe you are not a believer yet because my Bible tells me that these signs shall follow the believer. It does not say shall follow the ministers only. It does not say shall follow the pastor only. But he will follow the believer. He will follow the bride. You know that's what the message of the hour came to do. It came to restore us back to because why? Because it's your inheritance. It's something that belongs to you. You know the prophet says restoring means to take you back to your original take you back to that position that you once had the devil stole from you. The devil deceitfully stole the joy from you. God did not intend for you to be sick. God did not intend for you to be sad. God did not intend for you to be miserable. So you ought to take back that joy that God gave you. You are to God gave you your salvation, you ought to take that back because it's your inheritance. That's why the prophet said that when the bride gets to know who she is, then the rapture will take place. Why? Because once you get to know your position, you understand that there are certain things that belong to you that the devil stole back from you. What is the thing? That thing is that when God says a word, I say amen to it. Then Satan came and he brought unbelief in your life. But the message came to bring you perfect faith. And now when you have perfect faith, nothing stays in your way. &gt;&gt; And then the rapture takes place. Gravity even is is is is defied. Gravity is defied &gt;&gt; because you know your positions. Then the rapture takes place. You have to have a revelation of who you are. You have to re have a revelation of where you come to church on a Sunday morning. If Satan tried Jesus, he will try you. It's a message of restoration. Some some somehow throughout the ages, &gt;&gt; the church had lost certain privileges, &gt;&gt; you know, you can see even in the the when the prophet preached on the message on this uh series the seven church ages, the angel of the Lord came and draw a picture. And you can see how the light started going dimmer and dimmer throughout each age. Satan tried to kill the influence of that tree of life. Satan tried to destroy the tree. Satan tried to remove all the lights out of the church. But God says, you know, I will restore. That's what the message is. When God says, "I will restore," he's talking about sending a prophet for your age. The prophet with the revelation for this season because if you read Psalm chapter one, &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter one, the prophet says that he interprets the scriptures and he says, "Blessed is the man that that meditate on this word day and night." He says, "He shall be planted. He shall be planted like a tree. He shall be like a tree planted &gt;&gt; by the rivers of water and he shall bear his fruit in his season. The prophet says he will bear fruit in the prophet's seasons. So that tree for our age was supposed to bear fruit. But you notice if you read Psalm 31, it says in his season So there are certain fruits, there are certain fruits that you ought to show in this level this year in church age. Certain fruits that could not be displayed in the time of Paul because they had the partial revelation. But Revelation 10 tells us that when the ministry of Malachi 4 begins to sound and you have the perfect revelation of the word because all the mysteries will be revealed a message of restoration. Let's get back into the the scriptures. &gt;&gt; So we just read Zechariah chapter 4. It's a type. It's a type of restoration. &gt;&gt; And I'll give you the what happens in that uh the preview of that chapter. &gt;&gt; So after Jeremiah prophesied that the children of Israel, Israel will go into captivity. They went to Babylon. And then after after that captivity, they they were supposed to go back to their land. So the king Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, he had destroyed the first temple, you know. And after they went they came back from captivity. They wanted to rebuild the uh the the the house of God. They wanted to rebuild the place where the glory of God will come. They wanted to restore the temple, you know. And that's what happens in the book of Zechariah. They had a prince called Zerubbabel. &gt;&gt; The sacri the the high priest was uh I believe Joshua. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then the the Zerubbabel was the prince tasked with rebuilding the house of the Lord. Yeah. And uh let's go to Ezra chapter 3. &gt;&gt; The book of Ezra chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. It's after the after 2 Chronicles. So I'm just going back as to what is happening in rebuilding the temple because we know that God is Christ is building a church. Christ is building another temple. But this time this temple is not built by by man you know because he says what househ which house will you build me? He cannot dwell in a house made by hands of men. &gt;&gt; He has to dwell in a temple. &gt;&gt; So that's what the message of of the hour was doing, restoring that temple. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet preached on the message the the statue of a perfect man. So, Ezra chapter 3 verse one, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And when the seventh month was come and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. Then stood up Joshua the son of Joak and his brethren the priest and Zerubbabel the son of Shel and his brethren and build the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereof thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. Jose. [Music] So before rebuilding the and I cannot really hear myself well. Before rebuilding the temple of the Lord, the first step was to restore the altar. They had to build an altar to the God of Israel. In order for you to get anywhere with God, the first step is to restore the altar. Is to what is the altar? The prophet in the message Christianity versus idolatry, &gt;&gt; he said, "May he be the one that fills their temple. Then the power of fire of the Holy Ghost will fall on the altar of their heart." He says there is where the real altar is is on the heart of each individual. The real altar is not up here. The real altar is in each and every one of your hearts. So when so God is God wants to rebuild you. God this message is rebuilding you into becoming in the stature of a perfect man. But the first step that needs to be done is you need to work on your heart. You need to examine your heart. Is your heart right with God. That's why in Ezekiel God said, you know, a new heart will I give you and then I will put a new spirit in you. Then I will put my spirit within you. God starts with your heart first. You have to work on your heart. Do you have any bitterness towards anyone? &gt;&gt; If you have any bitterness towards anyone, you will not go forward with God. You will just be stuck in a loop. You know, s cycle upon cycles, you know. Work on your heart first this morning. Examine yourself. Lord, examine my heart. If there be anything in me that's not like you, take it out of me. That's why also in Acts chapter 2, Peter also told them after they they received the Holy Ghost, they said what shall we do? Then Peter said repent. So first work on your heart. But you know even before Peter who told them to tell them to repent the Bible says they were pricricked in their hearts. That word means to be saddened you know to be hurt by what you did. So Peter had preached a word that so convicted their heart. But now we have believers that come to church Sunday after Sunday. They hear the word of God, but they go out as if nothing happens in their heart. The word of God condemns the sin in their lives. No, they don't have any pricked heart, no sadness for the sin that you are doing. The believers has has become comfortable with sin. The message came to take us back to Pentecost. This message came to take us back to where your heart can be priced again. God says, "I will remove that stony art out of you. Then I will give you a heart of flesh." Why? Because the heart of flesh can be pricricked. Lord, I come to church Sunday after Sunday, but the word does not convict me. You need to pray to God. You need to ask him to give you a heart of flesh because you will not go anywhere with God in that condition. This morning, there are people with a stony heart. There are people that have been coming to church years after years and no change has been happening in your life. That's not the message of the hour. The message of the hour keeps on taking you from glory to glory. The message of the hour is here to change your lives. The message of the hour is here to bring God in reality. We read last time that he brings the pillar of fire in the church. What is the pillar of fire? God is a consuming fire. A consuming fire burns everything that's on its way. But how come in your life things have not been burnt? The thing is you even know what those things are. You cannot lie to yourself. This morning you are sitting in this church very comfortable but you know that you are not right with God. Whoever you might be you need to repent. &gt;&gt; You need to repent because you will not go anywhere with God. The message of the hour came to make us repent to turn from our evil ways. The Bible says that when you will turn from your evil ways, then you will pray unto me. Then you will pray unto me and I will hear your prayers. Then you will seek me with all your heart and you will find me. Yes, you haven't found God yet because you have not turned from your evil ways. The word of God cannot lie. The word of God cannot lie. Repent. That's what the message of Malachi 4 was. Brother tells us that repentance is making a U-turn. Brother tells us that true repentance is not just saying I am sorry. No, there are people that say I'm sorry every day. There are people every morning they say I am sorry. But you keep on repeating the same sin day after day. Your saying I'm sorry doesn't mean anything to God. God wants your actions. God wants you to make a U-turn because that's what Malachi 4 says to take us back. &gt;&gt; So it means to make a U-turn and returning to Pentecost. We need to repent. That's the first step in getting anywhere with God. How do you repent? Revelation 2:5, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Remember therefore from whence thou are fallen." Revelation 2 verse 5. &gt;&gt; Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen. 25 &gt;&gt; and repent &gt;&gt; and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and I will remove that candlestick out of you out of his place except thou repent. So God is showing us how to repent here. What is the first step? remember from whence thou are fallen. The prophet says if you want to get anywhere, if you if you left God somewhere, in order to for you to find him, you need to go back where you left God. Remember from where they are fallen. And if you are having an amnesia where you cannot remember, ask God to revive your mind. Lord, help me remember from where I left you. Lord, help me find you back where I left you. Because you will go look him anywhere else. He will not be found. You will only find Jesus where you left him. Mary and Joseph were walking with Jesus. Mary and Joseph, they were walking with Jesus. &gt;&gt; And they thought that they were with Jesus. &gt;&gt; But where did they find him? They found him back where they left him. Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So the first step in your repentance is you need to even know the sin that you committed. You don't just go to God and just be like, "Lord, forgive me for everything." That's not the kind of repentance that God wants. God wants you to know exactly what you did. I I read even a place where the prophet even uh says that I don't believe in repentance without reparation. So which means that if you have done something bad to a brother or a sister you cannot just go to God and say God forgive me. Brother says God will not even hear you. you know, you have to go back to that person and tell them that forgive me. I don't remember what message that was. If I find it, I'll share with you. You know, the prophet says you have to go back to that person that you hurt and also the way you repent to that person matters. &gt;&gt; Let's say for instance, you um you said some lies about the brother or sister. you know you said some terrible things about that person then the best thing to do it's not just to go to the person say you know brother sister forgive me I just made a lie you know you know sometime we lie here and then but we cool you know like sorry about that sorry &gt;&gt; that's not a a a a true repentance That's not a sincere repentance. &gt;&gt; When you repent like that, God will not even hear you because you might be able to fool that person, but you cannot fool God. God knows that you haven't truly repented. So the best way to repent, I'll just use the example that the prophet used. He said, let's say if I cheated on my wife, He said I wouldn't just go to her and say, "Hey, you know, forgive me, you know, like like in in just in a very weird way, you know." Yes. He wouldn't say stuff like that. He said, "I I would say I understand that what I'm about to tell you may mean that we we probably never walk together again." So you understand the gravity of what you did. And then he asked for forgiveness. Forgive me. And if you choose to never walk with me again, I understand. &gt;&gt; That's what true repentance is. So we have people here, they come nothing but their blood. You raise your hand to God, you know, singing, worshiping God. They said, "I believe the message of Malachi 4. You come, you rejoice, &gt;&gt; but God is not in your rejoicing." &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says they had to build the altar first. They had to restore the altar. So you have to return &gt;&gt; and make your life right with God. Make your heart right with God. The Bible says that if your heart condemns you not then we have confidence in God. So you cannot have faith in God if you have sin in your life. After service go home examine re re reflect on your life. If there's anything that comes up, something where you let some loose ends somewhere, this is a message of restoration, we are restoring the altar of God. And I'm talking about your heart, each and every one of your hearts. Go make that right with that person. You go to God &gt;&gt; and you ask him to forgive you. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet said in the in the book the the the Ephesian Ephesian church age &gt;&gt; he said God tells them to remember &gt;&gt; evidently something had left had left their mind left their minds. So he's talking about the same scripture we just read. So he's saying that evidently some they had forgotten something. Yeah. He even say they had forgotten something. He told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin. You know like some of the parents here sitting this morning and sometime I hear you telling stories how you used to be on fire for God. &gt;&gt; You would even walk kilometers to go to church. You would walk a lot of kilometers to go to church. You you were burning for the message of the hour. The message was precious in your heart. I heard even stories how back in the com they used to not have all the message uh initially all the message books. So it's like when someone gets a hold of one book, they hide it very preciously, you know, but now we have all the messages on the table on your phones on YouTube. But some people the last time you listen to a message was probably a month ago. Whoever you are this morning, somehow you have forgotten something. That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Evidently something had left their minds. What? What is going on? Is it the US? &gt;&gt; You have been increased with goods like Leodicia says, &gt;&gt; you know, it's the spirit of Leodia that's catching up with you now. Because the Bible says you have been increased with goods and you said we know we don't need anything anymore. You don't understand the the message doesn't mean anything to you anymore. God has blessed you so much. He has given you cars. He has given you businesses. You know he has given you children. And now you don't listen to the prophet anymore. prophet. I don't know how you're going to make it to the rapture. You need to listen to the prophet because it will build up your body for the rapture. My word will fail. You know my world, my word will fail, but God's word, the prophet's word will never fail. feed on that word. &gt;&gt; The origin of the So the prophet says &gt;&gt; um he says let those who name his name depart from sin &gt;&gt; and keep their vessels pure for God. Depart from sin. This morning I'm crying out to you, depart from sin. Let today be the last day you ever commit that sin. Make it your resolution to God that God, by your grace, this is the last day. You have promised me a life of prosperity in the word and Satan has stole it from me. This morning I'm taking that back. You have promised me victory. We have come to church and singing victory in the name of Jesus. This morning I am taking back that victory in my life. You have promised me salvation this morning. I am taking back that salvation. You know you have promised me the Holy Ghost this morning. I am taking back the Holy Ghost for me. The prophet says that there was one thing that kept him from giving his life to God from a young age. And he was a demon. You know, if that demon could keep the prophet, he will also keep you. But then this morning, make it your resolution. Today is the last day. Satan, I am done with you. I am a son and daughter of God. I am here to take back what I need. Take back what belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Brothers, what does belong to you? Healing belongs to you. Salvation belongs to you. You know nothing can stand against you when you believe the word of God. God belongs to you. If you stand on the word of God, nothing will harm you. That belongs to you. You know salvation of your children. That belongs to you as parents. When you pray and God says if you ask anything in my name I will give it to you that belongs to you. So somehow Satan has stole that from you. You got to be sick and tired of that. You got to be like shame God. Shame God the enemy came and was still stealing all the crops from Shamgard. But one day shame God had enough of it. One day shame God had enough of it. He says, "God, you are blessing me with all these crops." But somehow the enemy is coming and stealing everything. And same God took a stick, you know, and out and he went and he beat all the Philistines. You know, the stick was not strong enough. But it's because same God was tired of the enemy. It's because same God wants like enough and enough. All these blessings belongs to me. I serve a living God. And because same God had enough of the devil. God stood in that stick. God became his strength. God will back you up. If you are tired of the enemy, God will back you up. If you are tired of the enemy, whatever you are this morning, he says, "I'm tired of you. You have been fighting me for years and years and years. I've been losing battles. You have come into my house. &gt;&gt; You have taken everything that God has given to me. I prayed to God and he's not even hearing my prayers anymore. &gt;&gt; I am tired of you. Take it back. I promise you in the name of Jesus Christ that Jesus will stand with you. &gt;&gt; Jesus will will fight your battles for you. But you ought to be tired of Satan. You ought to be tired of the spirit of alcohol. You ought to be tired of the spirit of pornography. You have to be tired of the spirit of lust. That's only then that God steps in. Young men, this morning you are fighting your battles alone and you have to be tired this morning. Let tonight, let this morning be the day that is the last day that the enemy has victory over you. God is looking for witnesses. &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that will say that the message of the hour is alive and well this morning. &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that will say that I I cry out to the Lord and he heard my prayer. God is looking for some people that will say, "I have been young and now I'm old, but I've never seen a righteous forsaken." God is looking for some people that will say that every time I ask God something, &gt;&gt; he has given that to me. God has given you prosperity. Take it back. God has given you health. Take it back. God has given you increase in your life, in your financials. Take it back. God did not intend for you to be poor. You are to take it back. God did not intend for you to be miserable. Take it back. God did not intend for you to have anxiety. Take it back. Satan, take your hands off of God's property. In the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke the spirit of anxiety. In the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke the spirit of depression. In the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke the spirit of lust. Why? Because the messenger is restoring you. These are sons and daughters of God that God has redeemed and he has kept vindicating with a pill of fire that he has redeemed you. So Satan has no right over you. Satan has no right over you. Satan has lost all his right at Calvary. Jesus said it is finished. That means everything I need it is finished. &gt;&gt; I need healing. It is finished. By his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; By his stripes I am healed. You know he was bruised for my iniquities. Everything that I need. Jesus has supplied. Jesus is my everything. Jesus is everything that I need. He's more than life to me. He's more than cars or money or women. Jesus is everything that this world could give. He's more than that. &gt;&gt; Take Jesus in your life. Invite the word in your life. Invite the word in your life and Satan has to flee. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to be tired of the enemy kicking you. God is directing me this way and I'll just keep talking about it. Somehow I'm feeling that there are demons here &gt;&gt; that are afflicting the believers have been afflicting you for years after years after years &gt;&gt; and you just cannot seem to be set free. You have cried out to God. You have prayed and prayed but you just cannot seem to be set free. Then God is looking for a shame God this morning. &gt;&gt; If Lord I don't care. I'm going to lay down here this morning. If my if they they they they kill me here. &gt;&gt; If my bones are here, I am going to stay here till I die. My God, I am resolved. I am desperate for you, Lord. You are to be desperate for God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are to be desperate for God because when you are desperate for God, he comes to your rescue. When you are desperate for God, then he becomes the fourth man in your fires. &gt;&gt; Jesus becomes the fourth man in your battles. &gt;&gt; Then you are no longer fighting your battles alone. &gt;&gt; Then he comes to rescue you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let those who depart from sin look at once you once were in your heart &gt;&gt; and mind and in your life then go back to it. That's what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; This is very important. Listen to me. Look at what you once were in your heart. Where where you remember that that day or that morning, that night that God saved you. You remember that day that you received the message of the hour in your life. Look what you once were. Not just in your mind, but in your life. You remember how you used to be on fire for God. The prophet says look back in that position and he says then go back to me and what is the way back. The way is the way of repentance. &gt;&gt; We don't want preachers that preach a sermon with that doesn't prick people's heart. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to just make you happy. &gt;&gt; Judgment starts in the house of the Lord. True happiness is to be all right with God. If you if if you are happy the in the condition that you are right now, I just hope you are correct in your life with God. But if you are not happy, I don't know what kind of happiness is that. That's definitely the devil's happiness. But remember, the devil's happiness is just for a short time. You will be happy for 5, 10, 15 years. But one day, the devil, the Bible says he comes to kill, steal, and destroy. One day, he's going to destroy you. You don't play with the devil. Don't play with the devil. If you know, if you read uh in in Genesis, you know when when mankind fell, &gt;&gt; God started talking to Adam and Eve and he came to Adam because the has done no he said he told Adam why have you done this thing? He says the wife that you've given me. Then God goes to Eve and he spoke he speaks to Eve. He went to even if he's the serpent life. But you notice that when God went to the serpent, he did not even I want to have a conversation with the serpent. He says because thou has done this thing. So have the attitude of God. Have a conversation with the devil. Play with the devil. Put the devil right in the place that he belongs. He's a devil. He's a tormentor. So when Satan comes to him, Satan in the name of Jesus Christ go. I'm not even going to bargain with you or have a conversation. You remember that the prophet talks to the story of that lady. You are saved and then she went too close to the devil. She went back to a to a bar. She wanted to have a conversation with the devil. And the devil got her. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean sometimes it doesn't mean you are you are not saved. &gt;&gt; You just you got like song you got too close to the cross. It's a it's it's a very dangerous place. The prophet says repent quickly. still the same. &gt;&gt; Don't hesitate. &gt;&gt; You see the prophet is even saying quickly. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we linger too long. &gt;&gt; You commit something in your heart, you know, something is checking me. &gt;&gt; But sometimes because of pride, you don't want to make it right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the messenger is saying repent quickly. &gt;&gt; So that means when you do something bad, &gt;&gt; the moment God puts that in your heart, excuse me. If you if you call Paul says I die daily. &gt;&gt; He didn't say I die yearly or monthly. Daily, every day, quickly. I do something bad, Lord. I want to die. Don't hesitate. If you are hesitating this morning, don't hesitate. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll just skip. Okay, let me just let me not skip. So, the prophet says, you know, uh evidently Ephesus did hesitate for her lifespan was not very long. Um if if Ephesis the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly. You see why the glory of God has decreased in your life. You have now repented quickly. You still have some unconfessed sins in your life. The Bible says that he that hides his sins prosperth not. No, the Bible says that he that hides his sins prospers not. The prophet says, it does not mean that she could not have repented. It does not mean that we cannot repent. We can, but it must be quicker. That's the prophet. It's in the Ephesus church age book. &gt;&gt; The prophet says we must now we might repent quickly. It must be a true heart cry to God in then God will restore. I want God to restore his glory in your life, &gt;&gt; but you must repent. &gt;&gt; So, let's go back to Ezra chapter the same chapter, chapter three. &gt;&gt; If I don't finish it, which most likely I will not, I'll continue it next time. Verse verse 10, chapter 3, verse 10. Ezra, &gt;&gt; and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priest in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asafat, with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David, king of Israel. Ezra chapter 3 verse 10. Mercedes. First trumpet. Verse 11. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. So you notice that they rejoice because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. And we know we know what the prophet tells us what the foundation is. It's revelation of Jesus Christ. And then verse 12, but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men that had seen the first house, when the the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, and many shouted aloud for joy. And then verse 13, so that the people could not discern the noise of the shouts of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people. For the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard a far off. So you notice here in verse 13 that it says again that the people could not discern the noise of the shouts from the noise of the weeping. So there was so it was an uncertain sound. You know that's how the prophet preached on the message the uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; They could not discern the noise. What is this? A shout of joy? Is this like it's an uncertain sound? And you notice it was around the laying of the foundation of the house of the Lord. So the uncertain sound comes around the the revelation of Jesus Christ. That's why we see that in the na council you know there was also discussion revolving that foundation of the of the lord which was the deity of Jesus Christ. There was confusion around the name of the lordus and now they made it father son and holy ghost. So God is building a spiritual temple. God is building a spiritual house. And we also see that after they lay the foundation, then there is an uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; And if we if we go to Ezra chapter 4, &gt;&gt; I'll paraphrase. This is still happening before Zechariah 4. So like I'll probably paraphrase. So in in uh uh Ezra chapter 4, so there the children of Israel while they were building the house of the Lord, there came adversity from the enemy. They wanted to join with the believers. Verse two says, "Let us build with you, &gt;&gt; for we seek your God." &gt;&gt; Verse two, chapter &gt;&gt; 4, you know. Yeah. For we seek your God as you do. And we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Ezeradon, king of Asher, which brought us up hither. We were saying that we are the same as you. You don't have to go to higher ground tabernacle. You don't have to believe the message of the hour. We all serve the same God. You know, we pay tithing like you guys do. We pray in the morning. We pray on Sundays. Can we not join? You know, the prophet warned us against that spirit. The prophet says that in the end time there will be a spirit of unity. But that's the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; The the the U council of all the churches will want to get all the churches under one because let us just build one church. Let us just build one church. But the prophet says stay away from that. That's the mark of the beast. There's not a circumstance where a believer can be joined with an unbeliever. circumstance calls for total separation from all unbelief. Not some but all unbelief. Your message are not to partake with unbelievers who don't. Do not let them lie to you. They don't serve the same God. you know the the So let's continue reading. that Ezra chapter 4. So we'll see the the response of Zerubbabel. &gt;&gt; He was a type of Malachi because he was restoring the temple. So verse three, the Bible says &gt;&gt; the same chapter, but Zerubbabel and Joshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them, you have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God. But we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel. So that's that's the response. That's the response that the bride will have. The bride will have a response of we will not join with you. You have nothing to do with us. Unbelief has nothing to do with the believers. You ought to separate yourself fully from unbelief and because of some question. &gt;&gt; So um and so let me just paraphrase what happens. So after after Zerubbabel answered like that. &gt;&gt; So then the ch those those unbelievers show their true colors they went to accuse the children of Israel to the Babylonian king. And then the Babylonian king caused them to cease building the house of God and they stopped. If you if you go to uh Ezra 5:1 the after they stopped building the house of God then this is what happens. Ezra 5. Then the prophet Hagi the prophet and Zachchariah the son of Edu prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of God even unto them. So then that's when comes in the book of Hagi. &gt;&gt; At this moment when they stop building the house of the Lord is writing the prophecy that we're going to go read and also if you notice they also also Zechariah prophesied. So that's the prophecy of Zechariah chapter 4. chapter 4. We won't we will not get into it because let's go to Haggi chapter one and I'll end it with that one. &gt;&gt; 1 verse 1-13. Yeah. in the second year of Darius the king. It's right after it's right before Zechariah. That's what Malachi Zechariah So verse one. &gt;&gt; So in the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by he the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son ofiel. And I skip and I skip to verse two. Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, "These people say, the time is not come, the time that the Lord's house shall be built." Then came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet saying, "Is it time for you, oh ye to dwell in your seal sealed houses, and this house lie in waste? So he's saying, "Is it time for you yourselves to be living in your panled houses while this house remains in ruin?" [Music] So the spirit of God was grieved that when adversity came, they started saying that maybe this is not the time to build the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they got very comfortable with their own lives that they started building their own houses [Music] while the house of God was remaining in ruins. If it grieved the spirit of God back then, it is grieving it today. &gt;&gt; The house of God, we can talk about physic and spiritual spir physically and uh spiritual you know either this church. God is blessing us and we are so concerned about our own business and houses but we let the house of God in rule. We don't support the Lord. We don't pay our tithing. We don't pay our offerings. And on the spiritual side, you also don't work on your spiritual body. &gt;&gt; Everything is just about work. Work. You go to work outside. I got to do some business. I got to build my house. But what about your house where the spirit of God is supposed to dwell? If you don't take care of it, that grieves the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Then look at what God is saying now in verse five. &gt;&gt; Now this is what the Lord Almighty says. Give careful thoughts to your ways. You have planted much but harvest little. That's what happens when you don't take care of the house of God. You are working too much but somehow the fruits of your labor cannot be seen. Somehow the profit is too little. You eat but you never have enough. You drink but never have your field. [Music] You are never satisfied. &gt;&gt; I don't understand everything I do. I'm just never satisfied. &gt;&gt; You put on clothes but are not warm. &gt;&gt; You earn wages only to put them in a purse with holes in it. That's that's the Bible. when you don't take care of the temple of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it's it's sort of like you are working for people out there because all your money. Amen. &gt;&gt; All your money you're just giving it back to the government. You work overtime this week. Then someone gets sick &gt;&gt; or the car breaks down &gt;&gt; or you get a speeding ticket and all your overtime money is gone. That's the Bible. You earn wages but you take those wages and you put that in your pockets and those pockets have holes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people, you know, I spoke about that in in demon the other day. A lot of people lost money with the LLC stuff. [Music] A lot of people lost their money with all sort of business that like it's because you have not taken care of the body of God and look at it as a punishment from God because he's the same yesterday, today and forever. [Music] No, the Bible says my people die for lack of knowledge. I've heard people have uh uh invested like 20,000 $10,000 into that business and everything gone like that. Taking loans, everything gone like that. You know, it's two reasons according to the Bible. One of them is because you have laid the house of the Lord in ruins. You are too concerned about the natural things that you forgot about your spiritual body. Because if you actually took care of your spiritual body, meaning that you have to eat the word for your day, you would have wisdom. Let me read you what the problem about this nonsense business that some people get into. You know, because we're preaching about the message of the hour. Let the prophet William Brandon tell tell us how to invest, what kind of business to get into. Let's go to the message. A trumpet gives an uncertain sound. If you can project that, that'll be that'll be nice. Paragraph 49, &gt;&gt; my people die for lack of knowledge. &gt;&gt; You know, maybe if you actually you were very sincere with God and you prayed and then you actually listen to the message. Maybe God would have caused you somehow to fall upon this message and you read that and that opens your eyes. You know the thing is we are too greedy for money. We just Oh, I I I even heard some one one person telling me, "Oh, if you invest like 50,000, you'll get like a million dollars." &gt;&gt; I was like, "Oh my god." You know, and I went online and I did my research &gt;&gt; and you see that online also says that they target a lot of Africans. Because they know that Africans we tremble before money. In African we can't even give up my brother for money. Imagine you take all your 401k. You know, even those billionaires out there, they will never make that mistake because there's a rule to entrepreneurship that says only invest in what you are comfortable losing. If you knew you were going to lose 50,000, okay, but also be careful. God didn't give you 50,000 to just The prophet against gambling. The prophet preached against gambling. You are gambling with God's money. You have worked all those over time. The prophet. Let me just paragraph 49. &gt;&gt; He says, "If you've got a business &gt;&gt; in which we got businessmen present, maybe many of them If you are running a business that's not certain, you are not going to put very much in it. So the prophet is even preaching you entrepreneurship or how to start a business. If you are not sure about something, don't put much in it. And he says he gives the reason why. He says because the dividend is uncertain and you wouldn't make very much investment in it. Is that the message of the hour? I hope you guys can read it over there. Or if you are a good shrewd businessman. So maybe the reason why you made all those investment because you probably don't even have the mindset of a business. I'm just reading the problem because he said if you were a good businessman, you wouldn't make those mistakes. That's why the message is there for teach us on how to be parents [Music] business everything even how to drive correctly the prophet talks how you &gt;&gt; he said if you're a good and sure business you you will wait and search out your did you hear about LSC? Oh man, look at me. I put 100. Okay, [Music] you also jump into that research. &gt;&gt; I would say maybe if you're expecting a benefit of like $50, $100. Okay, that's one thing. So a business that potentially supposed to give you millions of dollars and you don't even do any research about that sounds like message believers because a message believer we supposed to be the most intelligent because we have the most perfect wisdom. We are supposed to be better as believers. We are supposed to be the best workers that go to work &gt;&gt; because we have the revelation that as I go to work as Paul says I'm working as if I'm working to Christ believer God is God has given me money so I don't want to just waste it with any uncertainty shame that's that's a shameful But it's okay. We learn from mistakes. &gt;&gt; So if you are a good true business, you would wait and search out. If you got some money to invest until you find something that's certain, something that's reliable, something that you can depend on. Can you depend on LLC? Where is he at now? something that you can depend on. He says because you don't want to lose that little money that you've saved up for. I repeat that again because you don't So the prophet is even talking about you even knew you would have some savings &gt;&gt; and he's teaching you how to not waste that saving and just you don't want to lose that little money that you've saved up to because with that you have to make your living. out of the remuneration from the dividends that's drawn on this investment. Why? You have to get something to live by now. And this little money that you got saved up, don't put it in your pocket and leave it there. &gt;&gt; Lesson number two, according to the prophet of the hour, Don't keep all your money in your banks. Learn how to invest money. Learn how to reproduce or but you have to be certain in what do your research says that don't put it in your pockets and leave there because thieves will steal it. I remember during co at some points they even wanted to start taking our money from our 401ks. &gt;&gt; Thieves will steal it. I hope you on the screen. Can you see it? &gt;&gt; It's on paragraph 50. When someone want to take all your money, &gt;&gt; the prophet has a right word for that person. &gt;&gt; Whether it be the government, whether it be anybody else, whether it be LLC, &gt;&gt; he's a thief. Imagine all the money that you worked up for goes over time and some of us work in warehouses very hard to work there. I've worked it's imagine you do over time your body is tired &gt;&gt; and you have even people in Africa your family members that you could help 50,000 LLC &gt;&gt; and the guy is just in China chilling on his bed so you working for him that's not that's not the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; He says don't do that. &gt;&gt; If you got invested in something, do your researches on investing business. &gt;&gt; Even if you have $20, learn how to invest it. There are many, many ways of investing money. You can't get into crypto. I'm not going to get into all that. many ways but just don't keep your money just in your bank. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what billionaires do? &gt;&gt; You know, I used to work for my host dad in North North Dakota when I was a student in North Dakota. &gt;&gt; He used to build houses. They always they always had contract after contract. And I was like, "Wow, why so many people are buying houses and building houses?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was like, "Why? Why would they build all these houses? &gt;&gt; You know what he told me? He says that some of them are not building houses to live there. It's just a way for them to keep their money. After some time, it's going to produce more money. You know, when Trump he had to pay, I think that was $300 million for a case that he had lost. You know what? &gt;&gt; Trump is a billionaire. But he said he didn't have all the cash. I think he said he only had like 50 million or something like that. &gt;&gt; He didn't have all the 300 million cash. He wasn't even in his banks. &gt;&gt; Where where was that money? He was in businesses, in buildings. That's how that's how the billionaire keeps their money. And we have the prophet also telling us the same thing. Keep your money in your bank. Invest it into something you know. And it says and then you want to be sure of the certainty of your investment. If you don't why don't invest it uh the so businesses is certainly on a shaking and stand tonight. I'll just I'll just end it there. It it the reason why I read because it ties into hey guy you put you work so hard and you take all your money you put that in a pocket with holes because of you know but we are restoring the altar &gt;&gt; and in the in the restoring rebuilding the temple you somehow you have left God somewhere You have stopped building the house of the Lord and now God is saying that you have gotten too comfortable that now I am going to create LLC. Let me let me actually you know what let me continue you know because it's God you'll see that let me continue chapter one &gt;&gt; where was I yeah verse seven this is what the Lord says give careful thought to your ways okay verse n let's keep to verse n you expected much but see it turned out to be little [Music] &gt;&gt; you expected millions of dollars from your LLC investment it turned out to be few And look what God is saying now. What you brought home, I blew away. You know, verse n. So say Satan blew it away. I God blew it away. So I God created LLC to blow away all your earnings. That's the word. So don't so you know don't even be mad at the person who introduced LLC to you &gt;&gt; because God is saying he's the one that blew it away. Be mad at yourself because you have not taken care of the vessel of God. You have been too comfortable with sin in your life. Why? Declares the Lord Almighty. Now God explains because of my house. &gt;&gt; You know, you know sometime people they pray for so long and now You get mad and God this is your answer away and you ask God why did you blow it away? &gt;&gt; Because of my house which remains the room which each of you is busy with your own house. &gt;&gt; Lord be merciful to us. Therefore, because of you, the heavens have withheld their due and the earth its crops. You know, I called for a draw on the field. And then, okay, I'll just end it there. [Music] And yeah, that's verse 11, it says, I call the draw and and all the labor of your hands. God, that's your answer. You know, maybe you have some other businesses that you've tried to do that failed and that nobody take care of the house of God. You may stand. Put in everything that you do. Put God first in everything that you do. Pay your tithing. &gt;&gt; I repeat that. Pay your tithing. &gt;&gt; There's another scripture in Malachi 3 &gt;&gt; that God says the same thing. &gt;&gt; He says if you don't pay your tithing. &gt;&gt; Now for the tithing it's a little bit different because there God says that he let the enemy come and take all your away. Pay your tithing. &gt;&gt; Pay your offerings. &gt;&gt; We have believers that even brag about not paying tithing. The prophet says that when you you you choose a church as your church support your presence, your money, your presence. Are you members of higher ground? You need to support the church. Don't be greedy. You all you just want my own house, my own No, &gt;&gt; you know, it's going to go from the devil to God is going to be again. I'm going to blow it away again. &gt;&gt; If you don't repent, &gt;&gt; even that investment that you're doing that it may seem like it's working out. If you don't repent, God is going to come and blow in. That's a warning. May God bless you. And I didn't I hope I wasn't too harsh. I don't know why I just sometimes I just have to preach what God gives me. Don't be mad at me. I pray that we go home and we leave. [Music] I'm not saying that I'm like I I could I almost also got into LLC. The Bible says that when you go rebuke someone, you rebuke with the spirit that Lord forgive them because it could have that person could have been me. So I don't I don't but I just know if you take care of the temple of God first, he will bless you. May God bless you. [Music] May the Lord bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; While we get into the spirit of prayer, &gt;&gt; let's sing this one song. There's none. It's not like you [Music] [Music] There is none like you.
