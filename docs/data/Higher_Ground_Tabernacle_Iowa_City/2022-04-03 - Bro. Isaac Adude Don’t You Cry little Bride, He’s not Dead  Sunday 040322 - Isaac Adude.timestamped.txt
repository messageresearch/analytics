[40:38] the scripture is found in luke chapter
[40:40] 24
[40:42] we read from verse 13 to verse 35
[40:50] um this story happens after the death of
[40:53] jesus praise have been saying
[40:56] these stories after the death of jesus
[40:57] when the two disciples were going to the
[40:59] uh ems road
[41:01] uh say it says
[41:04] jesus some
[41:08] and behold two of them went that same
[41:10] day to a village called emeas
[41:13] which was from jerusalem about three
[41:15] school footlongs
[41:16] and they talked together
[41:19] of all the of all these things which had
[41:22] happened and it came to pass that while
[41:24] they communed together and
[41:27] and reasoned jesus himself drew near
[41:30] and went with him but their eyes were
[41:32] holding that they should not know him
[41:35] and he said unto them what manner of
[41:38] communications are these that you have
[41:40] one to another as you walk in or sad
[41:45] and the one of them whose name was
[41:47] cleopas answering said unto him are thou
[41:50] only a stranger in jerusalem
[41:53] and has not known the the things which
[41:55] have come to pass they're
[41:58] there in these days
[42:00] and he said unto them what things
[42:03] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[42:05] of nazareth
[42:07] which was a prophet mighty and mighty
[42:10] indeed and word before god and all the
[42:12] people
[42:14] and how the chief priests
[42:16] and our rulers delivered him to be
[42:19] condemned to death and have crucified
[42:21] him now verse 21
[42:24] it says but we trusted that
[42:27] he had been here which should have uh
[42:30] redeemed israel and beside of this
[42:35] to the day uh today is the third day
[42:38] since these things were done
[42:40] yay
[42:41] and a certain woman also of our company
[42:44] made us astonished where
[42:46] uh which were early in the sepulcher and
[42:49] when they found now his body they came
[42:52] saying that
[42:54] they had also seen a vision of angels
[42:57] which said
[42:58] that he was alive
[43:00] and a certain answer and certain of them
[43:02] which were with us
[43:04] went to the sepulcher and found
[43:07] found it even so as the women
[43:10] had said but him they saw not
[43:13] then he said unto them all fools and
[43:16] slaughter of heart
[43:17] believable that believe all that the
[43:20] prophets have spoken
[43:23] uh now christ
[43:25] to have suffered these things and enter
[43:28] into his glory
[43:30] and beginning at moses and all the
[43:32] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[43:35] the scriptures the things concerning
[43:37] himself
[43:38] and they drew nigh onto the village
[43:41] whether they went
[43:43] and he made as though he would have gone
[43:45] farther
[43:47] but they concerned him
[43:49] saying abide with us
[43:51] for it is toward evening
[43:53] and the day is far spent
[43:55] and he went in and to terry with him
[43:59] and he came to pass as he said and meet
[44:02] with him
[44:03] he took bread and blessed it and break
[44:06] and give and give to them and their eyes
[44:09] were opened
[44:11] to him
[44:13] and he vanished out of their side
[44:16] and they said one to another did not our
[44:18] heart burn within us while he talked
[44:20] with us by the way and why he opened to
[44:23] us the scriptures
[44:25] and it rose up the same hour
[44:29] ruslan and found the eleven gathered
[44:32] together
[44:33] and them that worked with them saying
[44:36] the lord is risen indeed
[44:38] and has appeared to simon
[44:41] and they talked
[44:42] what things were done in the way
[44:45] and how it was none of them in breaking
[44:48] bread
[44:49] amen you may be seated
[44:51] thank you
[44:53] amen uh
[44:54] but we're still sitting up i want to
[44:56] repeat the verse 21.
[44:59] because it's very important for us
[45:03] the bible says in verse 21 but
[45:05] but we trusted
[45:07] that he had been he which shall have
[45:10] redeemed israel
[45:12] and beside all this today is the third
[45:14] day since these things were done
[45:26] amen this morning
[45:28] by god's grace i have a little subject
[45:30] that i wanted to bring but
[45:36] we're entitled don't cry little bride
[45:39] he's not dead
[45:44] um
[45:49] don't you cry little brother he's not
[45:50] dead
[45:55] because as we we read in verse 21
[45:58] of only
[46:00] the disciples expressed to jesus their
[46:03] complain or they their regrets
[46:09] amen for the
[46:10] torah the death of jesus
[46:41] the word and we saw how god was going
[46:45] to do it so we were certain that this is
[46:47] the deliverer
[46:50] we're certain that this is the man who
[46:52] will set us free from
[47:22] amen they were crying
[47:24] because they saw the deliverance was so
[47:26] close
[47:30] and all of a sudden it just went away
[47:35] they were
[47:36] crying but you see that in the lowest
[47:39] time
[47:43] in the lowest moment
[47:46] where all hope was gone
[47:50] that was when jesus appeared to them
[47:54] that was when jesus decided to walk with
[47:56] him
[47:59] you see that jesus came to join them
[48:03] and jesus started to talk with him along
[48:05] the way
[48:08] he asked them why are you sad
[48:12] you asked them why are you crying
[48:15] didn't you know that according to the
[48:17] word that these things were supposed to
[48:18] happen
[48:22] himself told you that that you know he
[48:24] was supposed to be dead for three days
[48:26] jesus
[48:29] jesus gave you the example of jonah
[48:32] donald example
[48:44] jesus gave you the parable of the temple
[48:49] when he said destroy this temple and i
[48:51] will build it in three days
[48:54] amen jesus explained all the words to
[48:56] you
[48:58] but why are you guys still crying
[49:11] amen but the thing is that when jesus
[49:13] was talking to them
[49:17] the word that jesus was telling them was
[49:19] not revealed to them
[49:24] amen because there is a big difference
[49:25] between knowledge and revelation
[49:42] amen
[49:47] by the way this message was preached
[49:48] five times and i'm talking about this
[49:50] specific point
[49:54] amen you can you can go in detail and
[49:57] and quote the prophet or call the bible
[50:02] amen but as long as that word has not
[50:04] been revealed to you oh oh thank
[50:06] you sit back
[50:07] it doesn't help you
[50:09] amen because when when you will be
[50:11] tested
[50:14] you will forget the same word that you
[50:16] were quoting
[50:19] because these disciples image there was
[50:21] they walked with jesus disciples
[50:24] they've
[51:07] that was coming
[51:09] amen wouldn't shake them
[51:12] because that word was now revealed to
[51:14] them
[51:17] amen because revelation is stated
[51:20] a
[51:41] amen abraham didn't care how many people
[51:43] was laughing at him
[51:46] and abraham didn't care how many years
[51:48] that took in apartheid
[51:50] they competed
[51:51] amen the prophet said that he closed
[51:53] himself he closed all the doors of death
[51:58] and focused on that revelation
[52:02] he had the revolution
[52:15] they want a great
[52:16] awakening evil and grand revere
[52:19] evil and grange they're crying
[52:23] believing that there will be an
[52:25] awakening
[52:28] there they're good people
[52:36] they have not recognized the awakening
[52:39] of the bride
[52:44] by being a christian
[52:47] they feel the pull of the hour
[52:53] attraction
[52:54] but they haven't recognized what's been
[52:56] done
[53:33] [Music]
[53:49] [Music]
[54:00] because it was prophesied that they
[54:02] would be blind
[54:05] they were looking for something in the
[54:07] future
[54:19] [Music]
[54:46] [Music]
[54:50] in the future
[55:47] highways being created in the desert
[55:51] amen they were expecting angels coming
[55:53] down and crying that he is here
[55:58] but they forget that god was acting in
[56:00] simplicity
[56:03] as you said simplicity amen that's the
[56:05] same thing that happened to us
[56:08] amen mary was crying
[56:10] clearly mary was crying
[56:13] amen because jesus was gone
[56:16] amen but jesus came to her and said that
[56:18] why are you crying
[56:22] jesus said mary don't you weep
[56:25] mary don't you cry
[56:28] because i'm reason
[56:37] [Music]
[56:56] why are you crying and there was satan
[56:59] when satan thought that he wouldn't do
[57:01] it
[57:01] [Music]
[57:05] he wouldn't go through it
[57:08] he went through get germany hello
[57:37] isaac i've been dealing with this
[57:38] situation
[58:03] here is a good news for you
