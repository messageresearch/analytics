[38:39] pray amen amen you may be
[38:47] seated well I trust that we are
[38:50] encouraged this
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] morning uh we're getting ready to
[38:56] embrace what we call the
[39:01] translation and I am so happy about
[39:05] it to know that I am one of
[39:10] them we are what we call those Exodus
[39:15] children Those whom God has led out of
[39:18] organizations and
[39:25] denominationalism people who cannot be
[39:31] destroyed a people who can never
[39:37] fail
[39:38] because our
[39:41] Victory is not within
[39:44] ourselves but our Victory is in Christ
[39:49] Jesus I would like to
[39:52] entitle this message uh super Church
[39:57] super
[40:05] church and the prophet of God tells
[40:08] us that we are
[40:12] invincible and I said uh at the end of
[40:16] the
[40:17] service the other night that we're going
[40:21] to be preaching on positive
[40:25] things because I want you to to always
[40:31] remember who you
[40:34] are now we're going to make
[40:38] mistakes we we we we're going to have
[40:43] shortcomings but we know that those
[40:45] things have already been taken care
[40:49] of we have a
[40:53] message that has given us such a liberty
[40:59] a Liberty from organizational
[41:02] ISM a Liberty from
[41:07] denominationalism a Liberty from any
[41:10] manmade
[41:13] structure God has freed us from all of
[41:17] that hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible
[41:21] tells us that that there is no
[41:25] condemnation to those who walk not after
[41:28] the
[41:30] flesh but after the
[41:33] spirit Hallelujah and sometimes people
[41:36] just don't understand that
[41:39] statement because we're in the
[41:42] flesh but see our heart's
[41:46] desire is to walk after the
[41:49] spirit and as long as we're being led by
[41:52] the Holy
[41:53] Ghost there is no condemnation
[41:59] Hallelujah to those who are led by the
[42:02] holy
[42:04] ghost in the preview of the
[42:07] Bride in the
[42:10] preview brother Bram saw the Bride of
[42:13] Jesus
[42:15] Christ walking to the tune of the
[42:21] word and he also saw her walking to the
[42:25] tune
[42:27] of Onward Christian
[42:31] Soldier and if we could just
[42:34] think of that song just a little
[42:38] bit Onward Christian
[42:41] Soldier marching as to
[42:45] war with the cross of
[42:48] Jesus going on
[42:51] before now we're not
[42:54] marching or walking
[42:57] within the uh denominational
[43:01] rings but we're being led there
[43:05] something that we hold in
[43:08] view we must keep that in
[43:11] view Hallelujah with the cross of
[43:15] Jesus yeah y understand what I'm saying
[43:19] we must keep Calvary in
[43:23] view because of
[43:25] Calvary we are who we
[43:28] are hallelujah hallelujah and
[43:32] understand nothing can conquer the word
[43:37] of
[43:38] God I'm going say that
[43:40] again nothing can conquer the word of
[43:44] God and as and as long as you are the
[43:48] word hallelujah that means you cannot be
[43:55] conquered I like that
[43:59] hallelujah hallelujah let me read
[44:01] something
[44:03] here brother BR says now here's what I'm
[44:07] trying to say to
[44:09] you the law of
[44:12] reproduction bring forth of his
[44:16] kind that that excites
[44:19] me to know that the law of
[44:23] reproduction cannot fail
[44:28] whatever seed you
[44:30] plant is what crop you're going to
[44:34] get is that
[44:36] right it it's the
[44:38] word hallelujah amen that's right the
[44:41] law of
[44:42] reproduction bring forth other this kind
[44:46] and that's Genesis 111 he said in these
[44:49] last
[44:51] days true church Bride Comes To The
[44:56] Headstone will be the Super
[44:59] Church a super
[45:01] race Hallelujah as she nears the great
[45:07] headstone as she nears the great
[45:13] headstone Hallelujah and for whatever
[45:17] reason we always put that in the
[45:21] future is that right we forget we forget
[45:25] the prophet of God said is a natural uh
[45:29] uh man or way of a man to think about
[45:33] what God did
[45:35] yesterday Hallelujah and he's always
[45:38] putting God in the
[45:40] future Hallelujah but he fails to see
[45:44] God right
[45:47] now Hallelujah and we're serving a right
[45:51] now
[45:53] God if I could get the higher ground
[45:56] tabern
[45:58] to see that we're the
[46:00] now Hallelujah yesterday yeah today and
[46:06] forever we are Jesus
[46:10] today oh Lord have
[46:13] mercy am
[46:15] am if we could just really see that not
[46:20] with our
[46:21] heads but with our
[46:24] hearts we could transform
[46:28] I
[46:30] City hallelujah hallelujah the Bible
[46:33] said where two or
[46:35] three are gathered in my
[46:38] name they I am in the
[46:41] midst hallelujah amen and often
[46:46] times often times we
[46:48] think that we're we're looking at God in
[46:51] the
[46:52] midst that's not where he's talking
[46:55] about he's about in the
[46:58] midst Hallelujah you are
[47:03] agreeing with one another according to
[47:07] the Christ that's in your
[47:12] heart is that right in other words you
[47:15] are on one
[47:19] Accord threefold cord what is not so
[47:23] easily broken a threefold
[47:28] cord it's not so easily
[47:31] broken and when we can get two to three
[47:34] people with the same
[47:38] mindset Hallelujah and they're thinking
[47:41] to do the perfect will of God they
[47:45] become an invincible
[47:48] Army
[47:50] Hallelujah serve amen amen hallelujah
[47:54] hallelujah these last days this true
[47:58] bride a church Bride Comes To The
[48:03] Headstone will be the Super Church a
[48:07] super race as they near the great
[48:12] headstone they will be much like so much
[48:16] like
[48:18] him even they will be in his very
[48:22] image now
[48:24] remember I hope you remember
[48:27] there's a difference between image and
[48:31] likess Hallelujah because remember when
[48:35] Adam was first created he was first
[48:39] created in the
[48:41] image Hallelujah and brother Bram said
[48:45] that was actually the theophany part the
[48:48] word
[48:50] part the word part Hallelujah he was
[48:55] Spirit oh my God and then he was
[48:58] formed and when he was formed from the D
[49:01] dust of the earth it was then he became
[49:05] in his
[49:06] likeness you understand me the the image
[49:10] of God is the is the spirit
[49:12] man the likeness of God is the physical
[49:16] that part that you can see in reference
[49:19] to Hallelujah and the Bible brother Adam
[49:23] says here that God that we will come
[49:26] into the very image what is he saying we
[49:29] are now moving into divine nature of God
[49:33] hallelujah little by little from glory
[49:37] to glory we are now coming into the
[49:40] image do you understand what I'm saying
[49:43] we're coming into that that God man part
[49:48] Hallelujah that cannot be
[49:51] deceived neither can it be neither can
[49:54] it
[49:55] fall Hallelujah huj that's what Peter
[49:58] said he said if those virtues remain in
[50:01] you you'll neither fall neither will you
[50:04] be
[50:05] baren you won't fall and you'll bring
[50:09] forth
[50:10] fruit hallelujah hallelujah come on
[50:14] somebody in other words you got to stop
[50:17] looking at
[50:19] yourself as being a
[50:22] failure but you must allow God to
[50:24] transform your mind
[50:27] to a
[50:29] Overcomer Hallelujah I'm not even a
[50:34] Survivor Hallelujah Survivor means just
[50:37] to

[57:29] bride now the bride is coming into Plain
[57:34] View
[57:35] hallelu why do you
[57:38] think all of the pressure of the world
[57:42] is now not just in America but
[57:45] everywhere pressure
[57:48] everywhere why because a child is about
[57:51] to be
[57:53] born is that right
[57:57] Mary had a promise from God that that
[58:02] she would bring forth a son y'all hear
[58:05] what I'm saying it was a
[58:08] promise it was a supernatural promise
[58:12] given to her and she didn't have to do
[58:15] but one thing and that was to receive
[58:19] the promised
[58:20] word hallelujah and when she received
[58:23] the promised word life began to form in
[58:28] her somebody help me here now think
[58:32] about it Hallelujah she's got to bring
[58:35] forth the
[58:37] Messiah and God hasn't told her
[58:42] anything amen hallelujah even some of
[58:45] the
[58:46] scriptures about him being born in
[58:49] Bethlehem had not yet unfolded unto
[58:54] them but in that time
[58:56] time there was a political
[58:59] disturbance and a social
[59:02] disturbance Hallelujah come on somebody
[59:06] you even
[59:07] had those
[59:10] Jews who was
[59:12] fanatic who wanted to overthrow the
[59:15] government Hallelujah they were
[59:19] protesters Hallelujah bringing trouble
[59:21] to
[59:23] everybody Hallelujah and here then God
[59:26] says I'm going to tax
[59:29] you and everybody got to go back to
[59:32] their own
[59:34] land where you were
[59:39] born understand this you talking about
[59:43] pressure I can't imagine what Joseph was
[59:46] thinking more or less Mary was
[59:49] thinking she's got to carry a baby she's
[59:53] already 9 months full
[1:00:00] oh my God and she's got a ride on a
[1:00:07] donkey Hallelujah the least little

[1:00:17] amen the least love you know amen she's
[1:00:21] got to ride
[1:00:24] there and no doubt
[1:00:26] she's
[1:00:27] thinking this baby can happen at any
[1:00:32] time you don't think the devil was
[1:00:34] riding on
[1:00:35] her you don't think the devil was riding
[1:00:37] in her
[1:00:39] mind Hallelujah God ain't telling her
[1:00:44] nothing Hallelujah and then she think
[1:00:46] all this baby's doing in in any
[1:00:50] moment and she gets to a place look like
[1:00:53] a in y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:00:56] then she takes a big
[1:00:59] breath finally we've
[1:01:04] arrived and then the inke keeper
[1:01:07] says there is no room oh sorry y'all
[1:01:11] know what I'm saying I could I could I
[1:01:14] could make this a little more personal
[1:01:15] so but I'mma leave it just there so you
[1:01:18] can understand the
[1:01:21] trauma the trauma and the things they
[1:01:24] must have been going through as human
[1:01:27] being
[1:01:28] Hallelujah and
[1:01:33] then they said okay we do have a
[1:01:39] place but it's in the cow stand a cow
[1:01:42] cave over
[1:01:43] there y you understand when I'm trying
[1:01:46] to bring something to you don't you
[1:01:50] think that this squeeze or whatever we
[1:01:54] got to go through is going to be life
[1:01:57] is going to be
[1:02:01] very very uncomfortable to the
[1:02:04] flesh hallelujah it's going to be a
[1:02:08] time when you if you don't understand
[1:02:11] the
[1:02:12] promise you might even think the Rapture
[1:02:14] is already taken
[1:02:16] place hallelujah it's going to be just
[1:02:19] that dark but when you know who you know
[1:02:23] and you know who you are you know that
[1:02:26] you're right in the midst of the
[1:02:28] promise
[1:02:32] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:35] hallelujah and you might think
[1:02:42] well it's going to be easy but it won't
[1:02:45] be
[1:02:46] easy it can't be easy no birth is
[1:02:51] easy is no birth is easy you know I I
[1:02:55] heard the prophet God said nobody could
[1:02:57] have died like
[1:03:01] Jesus Hallelujah no man could have
[1:03:05] taken the beating that he
[1:03:08] took and

[1:03:26] broken
[1:03:27] heart Hallelujah you understand what I'm
[1:03:30] saying he went beyond
[1:03:34] measures to make this day
[1:03:38] possible hallelujah oh my and now he
[1:03:42] just needs somebody who's going to
[1:03:45] believe somebody who's going to believe
[1:03:48] what we think to be the
[1:03:52] impossible like Mary said how can this
[1:03:55] thing be
[1:03:57] Hallelujah and many of us have thought
[1:03:59] that how can this thing be but
[1:04:02] understand this thing is not because of
[1:04:06] you it's because he said it would
[1:04:10] be hallelujah hallelujah born in a
[1:04:14] stable and no
[1:04:16] doubt the reality
[1:04:19] came first of all they didn't even
[1:04:23] know what God was doing
[1:04:28] Here Comes these
[1:04:30] Shepherds declaring they seen angels
[1:04:34] and hallelujah hallelujah and then they

[1:04:45] imagine what brother brownon felt like
[1:04:47] when he first saw the pillar of
[1:04:49] fire can you imagine when he first
[1:04:52] understood what it
[1:04:54] was can you imagine how insignificant he
[1:04:58] felt that God would choose
[1:05:04] him that's the way I feel I feel
[1:05:09] insignificant that God would choose
[1:05:11] me Hallelujah to be his bride you ought
[1:05:15] to feel the same
[1:05:17] way and to know
[1:05:23] nothing can separate us
[1:05:31] hallelujah how many
[1:05:34] y'all was really in love when you got
[1:05:41] married I know some of y'all weren't
[1:05:48] but but when you really in love you get
[1:05:51] this tunn of
[1:05:53] vision y understand me all you see is
[1:05:57] him and all she sees is is all he see is
[1:06:03] you and and you know somebody could say
[1:06:06] well man you haven't noticed she she's
[1:06:08] got you know her her eyes you know they
[1:06:12] look kind of funny they can say whatever
[1:06:15] they want to about the person you
[1:06:19] love and you will never see what they're
[1:06:22] talking about
[1:06:27] it's the truth so in love you can't even
[1:06:30] see any fault or any
[1:06:36] error it's what we call tunnel
[1:06:40] vision Hallelujah and when you find a
[1:06:43] girl that has tunnel vision for a
[1:06:47] boy the best thing you can do especially
[1:06:49] if you think the boy is no
[1:06:51] good the best thing you can do is pray
[1:06:55] cu no matter what you tell them they're
[1:06:57] not going to see
[1:06:58] it and it works on the other hand
[1:07:02] Hallelujah you know that's what I'm
[1:07:04] trying to say is my God and your God has
[1:07:09] tunn of
[1:07:10] vision Hallelujah when he sees you no
[1:07:14] matter what the Devil comes and tells
[1:07:17] him he can't even see it Hallelujah he
[1:07:21] cannot recognize it all he know is that
[1:07:25] you he is and he you know and the
[1:07:28] relationship that y'all have together
[1:07:30] it's a love that cannot be
[1:07:34] broken
[1:07:35] Hallelujah that is
[1:07:38] why that is why we cannot remain there
[1:07:42] in the seventh age of Brotherly
[1:07:46] kindness Hallelujah you canot remain
[1:07:50] there you must be United with God in
[1:07:54] love
[1:07:56] his love you understand me because once
[1:08:00] you are united with him in love you can
[1:08:04] say like
[1:08:05] Paul who shall separate me from the love
[1:08:08] of God hallelujah nothing can separate
[1:08:12] me nothing can separate you from the
[1:08:16] love of
[1:08:22] God Amen I hope I don't step on nobody's
[1:08:28] foot but I don't think much of a
[1:08:32] man when he's getting
[1:08:36] engaged and he give his his uh wife to
[1:08:39] be a little
[1:08:44] Diamond unless he can't afford if you
[1:08:46] can't afford it that's a different
[1:08:50] thing but they give a little Diamond
[1:08:53] that you almost need a magnifying glass
[1:08:54] to see it
[1:09:00] I know somebody like that that's why I'm
[1:09:02] preaching
[1:09:04] on now if you can't afford it that's all
[1:09:06] right give her the best you got but you
[1:09:08] going to give her the best you can give
[1:09:11] her Hallelujah I had a friend of mine
[1:09:15] who loved this girl and to be honest
[1:09:18] with you I thought she was ugly
[1:09:25] I really
[1:09:27] did there was no Beauty to be
[1:09:31] seen I I don't mean to be funny but it's
[1:09:33] the
[1:09:34] truth but he loved her
[1:09:38] so he loved her and
[1:09:46] I'm and I know he did he went out and
[1:09:50] got her such a big
[1:09:52] diamond it was no fake either and
[1:09:57] fake it was huge now these are little
[1:10:00] but it
[1:10:02] was it was such a huge diamond I thought
[1:10:06] where did you get I asked him he he said
[1:10:10] well I I got it on
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:14] credit I'm not finished paying for it
[1:10:17] yet Hallelujah but you see that is the
[1:10:20] kind of a thing that a a a man will do
[1:10:23] when he really really love a
[1:10:28] woman because she's
[1:10:30] materialistic hello she like nice
[1:10:34] things and so he worked that
[1:10:41] area you brothers who not married yet
[1:10:44] I'm telling
[1:10:45] you so my point is and that's what God
[1:10:50] he does the same thing when you first
[1:10:52] get saved he gives you almost any
[1:10:55] everything you
[1:10:56] want that's the
[1:10:58] truth he's he's moving he's moving in
[1:11:01] that realm to just make you even love
[1:11:03] him even
[1:11:05] more Hallelujah come on somebody and
[1:11:08] what is he doing he's bringing into that
[1:11:10] Harmony I'm way off my notes but anyway
[1:11:13] amen let me get back to that what
[1:11:15] happens we must come into the harmony
[1:11:18] with
[1:11:19] God I I I look at myself and I think oh
[1:11:23] my god look how far you have brought
[1:11:27] me see y'all don't know me but when I
[1:11:30] was a
[1:11:31] sinner I was a
[1:11:34] sinner don't look at me like I'm going
[1:11:36] to tell you nothing I ain't telling you
[1:11:37] nothing but that right I was a
[1:11:45] sinner hallelujah
[1:11:48] hallelujah and when God saved me I
[1:11:50] didn't even know I could be saved but
[1:11:52] when he saved me
[1:11:55] he saved
[1:11:57] me I was so bad my whole neighborhood
[1:12:01] heard and you know my whole neighborhood
[1:12:03] said it'll never
[1:12:05] last Hallelujah my own brother-in-law
[1:12:09] brought me a Coke
[1:12:11] 45 right after
[1:12:15] church
[1:12:20] here but had no
[1:12:22] idea the old man was dead
[1:12:27] y'all y'all hear me that was no
[1:12:30] temptation but if that had happened
[1:12:32] before I got saved oh yeah it would have
[1:12:37] happened you know what I'm saying so
[1:12:39] that's that's just a little
[1:12:41] example hallelujah hallelujah I was a
[1:12:44] real
[1:12:45] dancer Hallelujah I love the
[1:12:49] dance and that stuff they doing right
[1:12:53] now I would have found a
[1:12:58] way y understand what I'm saying hey and
[1:13:01] when they told me I couldn't dance you
[1:13:04] saved now you can't do
[1:13:07] that oh I went through a
[1:13:09] trauma I went through a
[1:13:12] birth Hallelujah and then God gave me
[1:13:16] another
[1:13:19] dance y' he never takes anything from
[1:13:22] you and don't give you something better
[1:13:26] let me move on let let me move on now
[1:13:29] notice what
[1:13:31] Harmony Jesus never did anything until
[1:13:35] he seen of the father or the father
[1:13:38] showed him
[1:13:40] first Harmony between God and Christ see
[1:13:44] John
[1:13:47] 5:19 so will the
[1:13:49] bride and he shows her his word of life
[1:13:54] he shows her
[1:13:55] and she receives it she never doubts it
[1:14:00] that's the part shows her she receives
[1:14:04] it and she never doubt
[1:14:09] it y
[1:14:12] understand how many of us believe that
[1:14:14] we're more than
[1:14:18] conquerors I'm not talking about how you
[1:14:22] feel I'm talking about what you received
[1:14:24] in your heart
[1:14:27] your feelings will always deceive
[1:14:29] you
[1:14:31] Hallelujah your feelings will make you
[1:14:33] lazy when you're not even
[1:14:38] lazy Hallelujah let me move on is this
[1:14:41] okay I'm trying to bring you to a place
[1:14:43] where I know some of y'all know these
[1:14:45] but if I could just reiterate it if I
[1:14:47] could just redo it or resounded to do
[1:14:51] something within us because remember all
[1:14:55] the shouting we do all the dancing we
[1:14:59] do doesn't make that
[1:15:02] it it's good to do it Hallelujah is that
[1:15:05] all right think about what we what we
[1:15:08] experience on New Year Hallelujah and
[1:15:11] how many of you have been struggling
[1:15:13] since
[1:15:14] then you understand what I'm saying
[1:15:17] hallelujah amen but you see that makes
[1:15:19] you feel good but listen you need
[1:15:22] something that's going to keep you
[1:15:24] something that's going to hold you and
[1:15:27] that's where the word of God comes
[1:15:30] in yeah you got to understand that you
[1:15:34] must become the
[1:15:36] word hallelujah it's not your
[1:15:39] flesh your flesh will be
[1:15:42] changed but that inner man must become a
[1:15:45] strong man you must become
[1:15:48] United hallelujah hallelujah somebody
[1:15:51] was
[1:15:52] saying just the other night
[1:15:57] I I don't know what what you were
[1:15:59] thinking but when we took communion I
[1:16:02] was so blessed by
[1:16:03] it because it it proved to me that you
[1:16:07] you you got something that you're not
[1:16:09] afraid of

[1:20:44] wonders Hallelujah in the midst of all
[1:20:47] of that he said that's not

[1:21:22] already had that Hallelujah but there is
[1:21:26] a super
[1:21:27] Church there is a church that's on the
[1:21:30] move and she's being formed and shaped
[1:21:35] into His Image right

[1:23:13] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:23:16] you know it may not have been natural
[1:23:19] sight but a spiritual sight there was a
[1:23:21] time that Samson realized who he was and
[1:23:27] what his purpose was he had forgotten
[1:23:30] about it many of the people in the
[1:23:32] message have
[1:23:33] forgotten what their purpose is
[1:23:37] hallelujah but 2020 should have awakened
[1:23:41] us hallelujah to our existence to who we
[1:23:46] are and what we are come for hallelujah
[1:23:50] hallelujah you got to know that you're

[1:28:20] age it was a age of impersonation did
[1:28:23] y'all know that
[1:28:24] brother bam even said it there was a
[1:28:27] there was demons among the
[1:28:29] Pentecostals in our day in our day they

[1:28:43] Hallelujah I'll read a quote to you if
[1:28:45] you don't mind he said thus what was
[1:28:48] thought to be the restoration and the
[1:28:51] final quickening unto the Rapture had
[1:28:54] not
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:29:07] come he said in it was a mixture of the
[1:29:10] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[1:29:13] blessings and the manifestation in the
[1:29:15] Holy Ghost
[1:29:32] as we have kept pointing out to
[1:29:37] you he said in it also was demon
[1:29:44] power as men were under the control of
[1:29:49] devils yet no one seemed to realize it
[1:29:56] then to prove that it was not the
[1:29:58] real these
[1:30:01] people even before the generation had
[1:30:06] appeared
[1:30:08] organized and wrote their unscriptural

[1:40:53] and if the Life of Christ is in the
[1:40:56] Church of

[1:41:00] character of
[1:41:01] Christ it'll produce the Life of Christ

[1:41:25] tell people maybe you hadn't stirred up
[1:41:28] the Kool-Aid long enough it's been a
[1:41:30] while how many of y'all drank
[1:41:32] Kool-Aid y'all know what Kool-Aid is and
[1:41:35] if you set that Kool-Aid in the
[1:41:36] refrigerator long enough all the sugar
[1:41:39] goes to the
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:42] bottom and if you don't Stir It Up and
[1:41:45] you just go get your glass that first
[1:41:48] glass of Kool-Aid is going to taste like
[1:41:49] you don't have any sugar
[1:41:54] hallelujah what your problem is you
[1:41:56] haven't stirred the Kool-Aid in a long
[1:41:58] time Hallelujah get that sugar in
[1:42:04] there see what I'm
[1:42:07] saying some of y'all looking at me in a
[1:42:09] [Music]

[1:42:15] don't know what I'm talking about buy
[1:42:16] you some Kool-Aid get you some water
[1:42:17] make some Kool-Aid set it and then you
[1:42:20] understand the revelation will come to
[1:42:21] you
[1:42:24] Hallelujah is that all right righto
[1:42:28] listen and identify with Christ of all
[1:42:30] ages I'm trying to wrap it
[1:42:32] up and So Divine
[1:42:36] Healing the main thing is Divine Healing
[1:42:38] of the
[1:42:41] soul the body of Christ it needs
[1:42:47] healing worse than anything that I know
[1:42:51] of is the body of Christ
[1:42:54] is the body of
[1:42:58] Christ it's been so
[1:43:04] broken yeah okay oh see yeah he's
[1:43:08] basically saying the body of Christ need
[1:43:13] healing worse than anything he knows he
[1:43:16] says you in bad the body of Christ is in
[1:43:18] bad shape is what he's
[1:43:20] saying hello this is in 19
[1:43:25] 1964 hallelujah hallelujah y'all don't
[1:43:28] think so huh but the prophet said
[1:43:31] it and if that was in
[1:43:33] 1964 which they were doing better than
[1:43:35] what we doing
[1:43:37] now H y'all hear what I'm saying then
[1:43:40] where are
[1:43:42] we we need healing of the
[1:43:45] Soul we've got so many things in our
[1:43:48] lives to we're losing our
[1:43:50] identity Hallelujah Jesus is still the
[1:43:54] bomb of Gilead he still can heal and he
[1:43:58] still
[1:44:00] delivers you amen am amen huh he said
[1:44:06] it's been so broken up by men's
[1:44:09] Theology and denominational
[1:44:13] differences until it's a sick
[1:44:17] body and I tell you it needs
[1:44:21] healing great great
[1:44:24] healing I trust the Lord will do a great
[1:44:27] thing
[1:44:28] toward the healing of his part of the
[1:44:32] body that's in
[1:44:36] here and and I'm wrapping
[1:44:40] it but we must
[1:44:43] understand it's all right to be
[1:44:47] sick even brother Bram said you don't go
[1:44:50] to the doctor and don't take his
[1:44:52] medicine
[1:44:55] if you going to go to the
[1:45:00] doctor and you don't take his
[1:45:03] medicine and you don't get
[1:45:06] well don't blame the
[1:45:10] doctor and he liking that to God and God
[1:45:14] is bringing you the word and you don't
[1:45:16] take the word that will bring you
[1:45:20] healing don't blame God
[1:45:23] Hallelujah is that all right if you
[1:45:25] don't have joy in your
[1:45:28] life don't blame
[1:45:36] God I tell you last
[1:45:42] night I had my grandboys grandbabies
[1:45:45] with me
[1:45:46] and well he might be listening I don't
[1:45:48] want to Hur his
[1:45:50] feelings but you know what I tell you
[1:45:52] what it was about three o'clock before I
[1:45:54] got to bed got to
[1:45:57] sleep and I woke up this
[1:46:01] morning I was like Lord have mercy on
[1:46:05] me I was so
[1:46:09] tired but all things work
[1:46:13] together because when you feel like a
[1:46:15] fair that's when God uses
[1:46:20] you you know we said the other night and
[1:46:23] I want you to understand when God
[1:46:25] changes his mask that's what brother say
[1:46:28] he never changes his character or his
[1:46:30] nature but he changes his
[1:46:35] mask I can't help
[1:46:37] believe that I'm one of the mask of
[1:46:40] God you've got to believe the same
[1:46:43] thing and if you believe that God is in
[1:46:46] you then you become an invincible
[1:46:48] Army you're going to be challenged
[1:46:50] you're going to be challenged that's
[1:46:52] part it it's part of the battle but one
[1:46:55] thing for certain I'm a
[1:46:57] Overcomer Hallelujah I will not go down
[1:47:00] with a surrender
[1:47:02] flag Hallelujah the only surrendering
[1:47:05] I'm surrendering to is God
[1:47:09] himself there's other qu that I could
[1:47:12] read but I'm going to close
[1:47:15] it the brother brother
[1:47:17] says that God was in
[1:47:20] Moses God was in Joseph
[1:47:25] definitely God was in
[1:47:27] Jesus God was in
[1:47:31] Paul God was in William
[1:47:35] brandham and God is in
[1:47:40] you so when God is in
[1:47:43] you let let God show
[1:47:46] himself
[1:47:48] Hallelujah y'all understand what I mean
[1:47:50] by
[1:47:51] that Hallelujah Hallelujah you know when
