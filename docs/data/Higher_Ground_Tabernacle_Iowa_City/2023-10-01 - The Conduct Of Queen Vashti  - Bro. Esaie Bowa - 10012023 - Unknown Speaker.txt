we shall pray heavly father we just read your word in the presence for which we not perfect that's why we coming to expose ourselves to this word the word the mirror in which we Mir our when you sh out Lord we may see ourselves through the word of God and we may see where it doesn't work Lord and we may fix it according to your word we want to surrender ourselves unto you the preacher up to the one in the last you may take the premin and you may give us the eternal life speak the way you want to Lord never let me speak on your behalf Lord but take my lips and speak accordingly to as we Ser unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen you may be seated we going to car on today with the conduct or the Disobedience of of F and next Sunday we're going to speak about the The Queen Esther if the p is going to come down then I'm going to preach it the the following Sunday if it's me who's coming down the next Sunday I'll speak about Easter and about the Queen Esther going speak about two weeks or one or two weeks after that I'm going to bring a message upon the mission that God have given to the church then we're going to speak about another thing of the love of God I don't know how the Lord going to help us to do that but we just surrend ourself unto him I'm going to add up something else this morning and I hope everybody is doing good this morning who came with sleepiness in his pocket who came sleepy if you sleepy just stand up that's what shall be done now listen to this we talking about the conduct or the disobedient or the queen V V being a woman she represent the church but you will notice that because of his Disobedience she been replaced by by Esther I'm say it every time we talk about woman in the Bible ity the church last Sunday and today when I'm going to speak about the conduct or Disobedience of I'm not preaching it with a mind that our brothers should reject their wives but the thought behind what I'm preaching the church that has been represented by just because she was disobedient to a King Christ as well today if is in the presence of a church that is disobedient is going to reject that woman so we taking the type that happen in the natur to understand the spiritual things understand that we preaching it for our brothers to uh to to to divorce their wives or to beat their wives or something if you beat your wife and report you to the police that's your problem you going to answer for yourself you're not going to be there brother says the true man doesn't B his wife if you're really a man and something of man you never beat your wife not only your wife but the prophet say to know the level of the church you got to know what is or the level the spiritual level of the wom in that church see the spiritual level of women in that church then you will understand what is that church that's it is my brother and I also remember Prophet said in the Bible it says that the woman was the first to be seduced she has been deceived by the sep and since she has been deceived by the sep it's because she paid attention to the word of sep but the poison in the word of serpent didn't look like the poison seent words seem to be sweet to the ear of the woman the way the serpent was saying to a woman seemed to be so sweet to the ears of woman that's what made her to pay attention the woman understood that that was wonderful what the from that moment she pay attention to the devil she to what God Said now the woman consider much more what the enemy is saying than what God is telling her even what her husband is telling here now the woman has disobeyed to the word of God who the matter of all the living people she disobeyed to the word of God that's why we had all those suffering and difficulties yes my brother and sister so when Eve was listening to the word of serp the deceiving of certain in this last days it will never look like a seducing because he has changed the techniqu the devil have changed the Techni to things many people are being deceived by Satan today without knowing it you see why you've got this part in that is for such a purpose it's for such a work so Satan opened the knowledge of Eve and it wasn't a work of one day Satan was speaking to Eve every evening and she was paying attention to that in the meantime Adam wasn't around that's why the prophet [Music] says a true a true man will never leave his wife for long alone can we say Amen to that that's how Eve is Fallen she paid much more attention to what the enemy was telling her then she end up falling and God said unto her when all that sin came she even brought Adam to sin and God said Adam Adam he was running away he said here I am where are you I'm hiding why are you hiding because I'm netive who told you that you're NE they were all neged all along but the prophet said that they had a holy Veil if a man is a master in his home [Music] and his people comes to pay him a visit people who came to visit a man who the master the man the master of the home should speak the same language why should he speak the same language with because when is going to say to his prepare food for my friends they have to understand that he gave the order to his woman visitor should understand that the master of the home as they speaking the same language now people will be observing to see if the order will [Music] be that's why he shouldn't be only he should be a master and speak the language of his so that when he gives his ERS we'll be waiting to see are the orders going to be executed or not it's read the Bible now when you say something to your wife or we get to your home and because you're afraid that people shouldn't see how your wife is disobedient that's what it means you are the master you speak the language of your people when we come to you you give your orders to then we observe it we wait to see if the because you've said it in our language don't use any other language speak the language of your people speak in our language it's written in the Bible we read it together with you to be a master so are they exed when they visit that's the problem don't just be a master when we're not there I'm a master I'm controlling my home when we come to your home you are the master yes it's only when we there that we can see master especially if you give the orders in our language the language of our people okay yes we understand that part that everything was going on until the queen disobeyed and it caused its divorce the same way with the church the church was going well from the Pentecost the church was get on well when we get through the church the church start becoming the sin entered in the church Disobedience entered in the church and people become so Str all the sin came to the church and the church became disob and such a church Christ will never take such a church as a bride Christ going to reject you as a church because the Church of God is to be obedient obedient to every principle obedient to every word of to every commandment of God that is what behind my spirit my mind when I'm speaking about this now listen to this V have done everything that's where I got idea when she was answering God the go tell the king never come maybe her friends with with with whom she was told her why your husband is calling by this time we we weing here why why is calling you just tell that we buy that was she had also a own advice the wrong advice that she got caused the divorce I can imagine myself the queen I can see her and telling your friends you see what you've done to me that's why my brother and sister especially our sisters never pay attention to all women you don't know what can happen to you the only friend that you have you should have as advisor is God himself the word of God should be the first advisor before any other thing you can see the queen vas she lost the kingdom she was rejected that's why the church have done today yes my brother and sister I know how we're going to get to but I'm counting on God so that we may understand something here that's why the prophet said that woman shouldn't take authority above men but she should be submissive to that's why it said in the word that women be submissive and husband love your wife I was reading in the Book of Proverbs where Solomon was saying a wise woman build house but the unwise one she destroy her house it's not a man who's building a house is the woman is WR in the a wise woman build a house you have to understand about wisdom a woman should use a wisdom to stay in the marriage stay longer in the marriage you should be wise it's not to every question not to every problem that you got something to say a wise woman build a house but unwise destroy house she destroy with their own hands so my brother and sisters every that everything that I'm is for us to understand what the church is the behavior of the church before God today and and the place of as we said it last time especially in America it's hard to find the woman in the kitchen if you wanted to be in the kitchen then you can show us your riches for six years like the King has done the queen vas was over there and the King shows his riches for six years to if you want your woman to be just sitting somewhere as a then you have to show your riches for six months that no is that true sh his riches for six month and the queen was at rest that's why I'm not of that idea that the place of a woman is just in the kitchen if God help me to have a lot of money yes my my wife that's why she have but as long as I don't have enough I don't see it important to be just in the kitchen but somebody can say Prophet said the of a woman is yes he said but here also the place of a woman is to be a queen at home how can she be a man's Queen if if you know how to to support her for the so if you can take charge of everything for a woman then she can stay in the Christian then vas was rejected while she was even at rest in the kchen she's been disobedient yes my brother and sister that's how it has been to the that the king needed another queen that's what I'm going to speak about upon about I want to say this the prophet was saying they have shown that the queen vas was disobedient and he said the type of a queen V is the type of believers who have been in the message for longer I'm going to read it so that we can be together I'm in the the the marriage of the land did let me say this now I don't say to make a joke but I'm I'm saying it for you to understand it's exactly what you Christian of that's what you're doing to those young believers is true you're supposed to be you Christian that is being Christian for you should be a role model you part people who pretend to have a holy ghost you should be an example Baptist and Presbyterian not to be like the first lady like Queen vas but you supposed to be like Jesus he's telling you here what to do how to do [Music] it we got to we got to follow his commandment and his examp that's how we found it so this queen never wanted to to obey V refused and humiliated the king if the first lady of the land gives such example all the women will do the same thing and when the man shall invite his woman and the woman could say don't play around with me what the queen V have done in that it was like a prediction upon America we've seen that by acting in that way there was a wise man who advised the king that he has to do what he did is to get out and send a message through all around the nation and call all the virgin to go all the young virgin and choose a queen among them and it it pleased the king the prophet is showing here just because vas was a type of a church today the vas creation that has been in the message for a long time we supposed to give a good example we supposed to live in such a way that the new creation those just get converted they may see our way of living and they may follow the way of God but the worst part we behaving the same way like the Lord is the Lord have sent us his word but the long we refusing to act according to the Commandment of the Lord and we giving a bad impression bad example to those young CHR those just believe the word of God that's what is bad those Christians for long time [Music] we we know in the Bible because it's about the example that we have to give Joseph was living ater so potifa went out and left Joseph at home with his wife and the wife of P first started flirting with Joseph because Joseph was [Music] handsome and Joseph never give up to the Temptation from the woman Joseph understood the only way I can do is to escape to run away then Joseph escaped he went us today Christian for long the long long what example we giving it's not even it's not even the woman who came to we going to attempt the woman that's the bad example we're giving how would you want such a church how would you want this group of people like that God can speak about how would you want God to oh God bless them because we giving a bad examples but God want a church or need a church that is is obedient God want a church that is obedient when the Bible says when the Lord promis something it has to happen so why don't we see those promises being fulfilled why don't we see the Fulfillment of the prom in the church is because we we've given a b examp as the chrisan of we disobey to the command we disobey to the orders of God to the orders of the Lord Christ that's why the church it it seems to be St it's so c not even one tongue is spoken in the church not even sick people healed in the church no blessing in the church even the joy of Sal not the church it's because the church has given bad examples I said it last time the prophet was saying that a man you will never see a man acting badly without a woman acting bad first that was just a portion of a scripture the same Prophet saying the same way a man cannot act badly without woman a woman can never act badly before the man so all the problem we have in the marriage either is the man or either is the woman then the man is not happy that's why we have troubles but in all of that God want the church to be obedient before the word of God and he want a woman to be obedient to his to a hus that's why he said woman beiss because he knew that in the woman there's always a fight to be sub she always want to have a first position that's why God seeing that he said the woman be submissive he knew it that a woman is in the [Music] fight that's why American women never understood when they voted the 19 Amendment that made a woman to have a right of vote that's what created everything that we have today and the country the land is Fallen without any hope spiritual manual woman they may they may see America with eyes then understand that America is Fallen but the one who's you know America is a country we've got right equal right between men and man is not Superior to to a woman a woman is equal to man and she can do everything I said the same way clap his his wife and the woman canap that is not in the Church of God that's why we we learn fromo but here in the church we PR Supremacy and the authority of a man that's what we're talking about the same way a man has got Authority above his wife the same way a man has Domin his wife the same way Christ is is having a Dom the church we don't have any church that that is above Christ a church that have a Domin of Christ is the church like Catholic Church oh yes they're leading [Music] themselves they've killed the Holy Ghost and they cannot speak because they wanted to lead themselves but us right we need we need a church that is leaded by the Holy Ghost the church in which the Lord can reveal when somebody the Lord reveal it in the church that's the church if I've got a vision of church is that kind of a church that I have but a church which is where we only GA we sing and then go back home and people are singing like foolish people no that's not a church then we're going to need to stay each and everyone at home but as long as there's a church the Bible says the Lord God is aesome in the Church of holies if God is so wonderful in the church he's going to reveal what is not what is not right in the church when somebody have SE somewhere God reveal it I remember one time that was before I come to I I come to us while I could see how long it has been taken before come I was feeling something in my a voice in my heart I call my wife and tell her I felt something telling me in my heart then I told her you always ask us ask God to help so what have you done you got to do something that you feel like it's over your capacity wit of what I'm saying when when we left to Dubai I told her that I want to go preach in the village that's what God is telling me then I went I went and preached in back in maybe two or three churches the time I was preaching over there because it says that the Lord is so wonderful in the Assembly of there was a couple that about get married they introduced them to the church I was living at past this place the time I was sleeping God showed me something I saw that young couple and they were busy having love I just saw a piece of it in the morning I thought Pastor I said look what I've seen the new couple that you're going to they knew each other as man so ask them then Pastor went to ask them just after I've preached and the man said pastor is true I need a church where God can reveal sin I don't want to change where when we come people are so disobedient to the word of God but we just come and what are we doing you better stay home so as I was in I had only two days to leave then they send me a message that go to the Embassy are you going to say that the devil that spoke to me it was God who spoke to me we need people who can capture the word of God the voice of God and to be totally obedient to God at such a point when God tells them something they just captur the thought of God and put it in practice yes my brother and sister I want to move for just to up something I said it we reading the example of Joseph in the Bible so where are the true Joseph today Joseph uh Joseph all old test him it was a woman who wanted him but people of they are the ones who are going to seek those womans that's so PR you know my brother and sister it's easy to commit Trey yes you can do it to fix it that's a big problem yeah go do whatever you want to is good but how to fix it if you didn't fix it well you're going to go to hell doing it it's good but how to fix it I'm going to read how the prophet says how how he showing how fix adultery question answer number he said this woman has committed adultery with this then she confessed it to her husband then she went with her husband with the husband to see the men that they commit she confessed and fixed the [Music] situation but now a man who committed adultery with the same woman because him also was married he has to go back to his [Music] wife bring his wife and see the woman then everything is is right I was telling my wife God have given me a beautiful woman that I've got thousand reasons not to look outside then I always tell my wife you hear that or or you oh so expecting that I'm going to commit adultery it's easy to do that but just because it's difficult to fix it I can never go do it because said when you are a married woman you go and commit adultery with a mar woman that sin to fix it is not easy you got to take your wife you said my wife committed adultery with that woman andam say you going to take your wife it doesn't stop from there you take your wife you take her to that woman with which you commit then you said unto your wife this is the woman with whom I've committed adul and you think it's easy you can the fight can so when he says take your wife go see the woman you don't know the consequences that can come up but now the other woman over there because a man have fixed his situation with his wife he took his wife they went to see the woman then it's done if that woman has to fix the she has to tell it to a husband it's not going to stop from there you take your husband you go see the man with whom you commit adultery and you think it's easy that's why I cannot do that and just by grace of God I'm counting now five years of marriage I don't know any other woman beside my woman I don't know any other woman in the name of the Lord and you think I'm not a man I'm a man like you and when I was in K I was telling one brother I was telling you God going to take me as a role model at the Judgment all those men that Fallen with women in the absence of their wives God going to take me as a mother he's going to tell them when they will say Lord I Fallen because I was a away from my wife I couldn't do any other thing said but God going to call me come here he's going to tell you wasn't away from his wife for long time the church has become Disobedience when you hear that somebody is you can you got a Grace to to see somebody who he come to church but I want to tell you there so many backers in the church this morning just because they are ashamed of staying home but they come to church and when you hear that somebody is backl it's always is with woman is now drinking that's all God has created you a man just to be in dark or just drinking no who is the man a man is the one who's telling himself why God created me the purpose of me being upon what's the mission God has given me so that I can fulfill it every man every woman is born under a God is he made us born under a mission and we've got a mission each and every one of us when you leave and you got no vision no mission you don't even recognize that God has placed you upon the Earth in a mission that's so PR our first mission us as a church of living God is to give a good example to give a good example and once we give this good example then the chur church will be in fire I said it last time that as the king assures divorced a queen his Queen I mean I'm not preaching upon about uh marriage and divorce I don't have responsibility to do that because I'm not a pastor of this church but now listen to what say but for what is to fix this question of for you to know who was right and who was wrong and is's showing it clearly in this Ty he said there's one Christ with so many members that form the he said noce [Music] himr he can put us away because of fornication and adulteries whenever he want but how can you try to put him out thinking that you can get to that point we don't have that right to reject but Christ can put us he [Music] said a man can put away his wife and get married to another but a woman has is got no right put away his wife his his her husband and get married to another husband a woman can never do because it's breaking even the type of the scripture but remember but I'm preaching this just to show how much the church and the church that is Christ can put it out the same way a man can reject his wife and get married to another one I'm just [Music] reading do you see all the shadows and the types in a in in a in a balance Perfect Balance not the church but the bride by the word not a woman but a man every time that's why it has been said a man shall not do it but it's only a woman who should should not do it yes my brother and sister the church has to be obedient to the word of God because if she's not obedient Christ is going to put her out and don't understand the church that is a member of people but the church is you today God is saving people individually and the prophet said Israel God is saving them as a nation but gentile people God is saving each one of us individually if you're not obedient to the word of God then God going to put you out Christ going to put you out your king going to put you out God want to have men and women obedient to him God want to have men and women that are subjective to his word God and to his authority yes my brother and sister the prophet told us that we are at the seventh age of the church we are at the seventh day of the church where God supposed to be at rest and we are the ones supposed to work so what are we doing we are at a seven seventh Church age of the chur what are we doing and the Lord helped me to understand this today upon the Earth we got four categories of people according to the promises of God and to his word upon the Earth today there are people men and wom who doesn't know what God has promised they are ignorant to everything and they are living their own Liv they are leaving it happily and they can see the way how it's moving forward and they're moving with it [Music] but the second category of people people who knows what God has promised for this they know that God has made promises for this hour but they can't do anything I know they know that there are promises God has made those promises for this last and they can't do anything about it just because they got no power to make alive those promises and they just let things go that way the third category of people that knows that God has made promises for this day but they are regretting they are crying they are crying they saying oh Lord when those promises are they going to when the promise is going to be fulfilled in our Liv and they bus they are crying and the promises of God are right there and they just see the promises the fourth category of and the last one people knows that God has made promises and they're looking at those promises and they're saying those promises belongs to us there has to be fulfilled and they can make those promises put in action and God honor their words so in which category of people are you before the promises of God of this day God need men and women obedient to him those who can be obedient to God so that we can see the will of God being fulfilled in our lives God want to rest himself in a man he want to rest in the church so in what church God going to rest if the church was just what we see with you today that's so P my friend and sister what I'm preaching this morning is to awaken each and every one of us it's for myself to be aw it's for you to be be aware so that you can be conscious you can say no this is not a church the church should not should not be this way so that all of us we can go to this true church the church in fire the church obedience church the church that works always in Victory no matter what the Satan do the CH should have solution to every problem and a man and woman so God needs men and women that are obedient so how much we need those men and women obedient to God so that God can bring a total Deliverance to the church God want to deliver us totally he want to Deliver us from our he want to Deliver us from our actions from our words every promise that God has made is supposed to be fulfilled in this day God said You shall be the her and all the Tails shall be prosperous everywhere as your soul prosper how can we expect Prosperity while our souls are not prosperous our soul should be prosperous first then we can see the things of God being fulfilled in our lives it's hard my friend but I pray that uh the Lord should speak the way you want to my brother sister I will end up by this the prophet says that there was one lady a mechanic man who was in a workshop somewhere [Music] for he was there in front of a motor that wasn't working he touched her he touched he tried to touch everything that engine and the engine couldn't startop so he tries by all means it didn't work after a while he saw a man appearing before he said Young Man Press with this for the engine to start just touch here touch again over there and that side con connect this remove this then the guy did the same thing started we've always learned that this is applied to the healing Divine Healing but the Lord help me to understand also if we have to be standing and walking the engineer of Our Lives the one who comes in his word and say for you to move forward for you to have such a thing that you need he's telling us just remove the internet Conn connect the Bible uh move move away from masturbation take away the tou you put away this thing because if you don't take it away the engine is not going to St so God want to be want us to be a church that is moving forward for us to be moving forward we have to connect this and connect other we have to connect this and that and after all let's come and see ourself in the middle of the word of God let's come in the presence of God when the word of God is being preached let us see ourself through the mirror and see where there's imperfection and let's tell God lord I I can still
