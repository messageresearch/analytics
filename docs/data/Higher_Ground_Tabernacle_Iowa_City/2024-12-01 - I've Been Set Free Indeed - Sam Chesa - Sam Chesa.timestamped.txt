[59:20] of the seventh month in the day of
[59:23] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[59:25] sound throughout your
[59:35] land and ye shall hallow the 50th year
[59:39] and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[59:42] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[59:44] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[59:47] shall return every man unto his
[59:50] possession and ye shall return every man
[59:53] unto his family
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:08] and verse 13
[1:00:10] reads in the year of this
[1:00:14] Jubilee you shall return every man unto
[1:00:17] his
[1:00:19] possession may the Lord add blessings to
[1:00:21] the reading of his word
[1:00:26] amen amen for a short while I want to
[1:00:28] speak on
[1:00:31] um I've been set free
[1:00:37] indeed I've been set free
[1:00:40] indeed in The Book of Leviticus where we
[1:00:44] read God gave the children of Israel a
[1:00:47] statute or a
[1:00:51] Commandment that after every 49 years
[1:00:57] the 50th year he called it a Year of
[1:01:02] Jubilee amen and the Year of
[1:01:05] Jubilee meant that each and
[1:01:09] everyone who had been
[1:01:12] bound or lost their possession during
[1:01:14] those 49
[1:01:18] years when they hear the trumpet of
[1:01:23] Jubilee it meant that if you were bound
[1:01:25] you have to be set
[1:01:28] free amen when you hear the trumpet of
[1:01:33] Jubilee you knew that you could walk
[1:01:36] back and take back your
[1:01:40] possession Hallelujah and wish she God
[1:01:43] had already opened Grace for them in the
[1:01:46] Old
[1:01:49] Testament it said whatever you had
[1:01:52] done it does not matter what it was
[1:01:57] you had to go
[1:02:00] free even if they had the
[1:02:03] records that you committed a
[1:02:05] crime but because that trumpet has sound
[1:02:08] a
[1:02:10] jubilee you had to go
[1:02:13] free and God said on the 10th day of the
[1:02:16] seventh
[1:02:19] month this is when the trumpet would be
[1:02:23] sounded and we know that the 10th day of
[1:02:26] the seventh month was the day of
[1:02:31] atonement where the high
[1:02:34] priest would walk in with a ball of
[1:02:39] blood and he would sprinkle it on The
[1:02:41] Mercy
[1:02:46] Seat he would sprinkle it on the mercy
[1:02:49] seed that was in the holy of
[1:02:52] holies and he was atoning for the sins
[1:02:54] of all the children of
[1:02:59] Israel and we know that that was a
[1:03:02] type of what was coming in the New
[1:03:06] Testament so each and every 10th day of
[1:03:09] the seventh month on the Year of
[1:03:16] Jubilee Aaron would go
[1:03:18] in and sprinkle that
[1:03:21] blood and say and God would forgive all
[1:03:24] their sins
[1:03:27] but all that was a type of of the New
[1:03:30] Testament and we knew that Christ
[1:03:33] came as the high
[1:03:36] priest that was doing away with the
[1:03:38] priesthood of
[1:03:42] Aaron and he was coming in as the high
[1:03:45] priest that's touched by the feeling of
[1:03:46] our
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:50] infirmities so the day of
[1:03:53] atonement was signify that day on
[1:03:58] Calvary amen but in the Old
[1:04:01] Testament the blood that Aon would put
[1:04:04] on the mer
[1:04:07] SE it it did not erase it did not erase
[1:04:11] the
[1:04:13] sins it just covered
[1:04:16] them but when
[1:04:18] the high priest came Jesus
[1:04:22] Christ he was not only covering the sins
[1:04:27] but he was erasing all of
[1:04:30] them as if you have never done it in the
[1:04:33] first
[1:04:34] place amen amen so on the 10th day of
[1:04:37] the seventh
[1:04:39] month the high priest would go blowing
[1:04:41] that
[1:04:43] trumpet so people had lost some of their
[1:04:48] inheritance that Joshua had a portion to
[1:04:51] them when they left Egypt
[1:04:56] maybe they got in
[1:04:58] debt or they committed a
[1:05:01] crime their land would be
[1:05:05] taken or their families and their
[1:05:07] children will be taken to be
[1:05:11] slaves and they start working for their
[1:05:13] task
[1:05:15] Masters to try and uh to to to try and
[1:05:19] uh atone for what they had
[1:05:22] done but but on the 50th
[1:05:28] year it does not matter whe that they
[1:05:31] were in the
[1:05:32] field as soon as they hear the
[1:05:36] trumpet each and every man knew they had
[1:05:38] to draw instrument they were
[1:05:42] using and they would run out shouting
[1:05:44] I'm
[1:05:48] free things that used to bind me they
[1:05:50] don't bind me no
[1:05:52] more Hallelujah and we know that Israel
[1:05:55] is the type of the
[1:05:58] bride and we had a bigger
[1:06:02] Jubilee that sounded for you and
[1:06:05] me when Christ was on
[1:06:08] Calvary and he shouted it is
[1:06:11] finished that was a jubilee for you and
[1:06:15] me whatever they used to bind
[1:06:18] you it don't bind you no
[1:06:21] more amen amen so everyone who had lost
[1:06:24] their property
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:28] they would have to walk back and grab
[1:06:32] it it doesn't matter who was on
[1:06:35] there you say it is my god- given
[1:06:39] right I'm taking it back do you have a
[1:06:43] promise of
[1:06:44] yours that Satan is trying to fight you
[1:06:47] for you not to get
[1:06:49] it you got to walk to him and say I've
[1:06:53] heard the message of the hour
[1:06:56] I've heard the trumpet of
[1:06:58] Jubilee I'm taking back my god-given
[1:07:03] possession I'm taking my god-given
[1:07:07] health Hallelujah I'm taking my
[1:07:10] god-given
[1:07:13] peace the prophet of God says Jubilee
[1:07:16] was God's manner of expressing Grace to
[1:07:19] his
[1:07:23] people for restoring or brought back to
[1:07:26] their rightful
[1:07:31] position they were being brought back to
[1:07:34] their rightful
[1:07:38] position so which means at some point in
[1:07:41] time they had lost their rightful
[1:07:47] position the prophet told us that we
[1:07:51] were born Sons amen we were born Sons
[1:07:57] but we just didn't know it because we
[1:07:58] had
[1:08:01] Amnesia but thank God for the message of
[1:08:03] the
[1:08:05] hour that came to open our
[1:08:08] eyes to show us our rightful
[1:08:13] position because we were born in
[1:08:16] sin shaped in
[1:08:18] iniquity but as soon as you hear that
[1:08:20] trumpet
[1:08:21] sound that scene has no hold over you no
[1:08:24] more
[1:08:26] that iniquity has no hold over you
[1:08:29] anymore because God's grace was there to
[1:08:33] bring you back to your rightful
[1:08:36] position Hallelujah don't think you were
[1:08:39] just born here to grow up until you
[1:08:42] die you were born with a
[1:08:45] purpose amen the Bible says we were
[1:08:50] predestinated sons of God predestinated
[1:08:54] before the foundation of the
[1:08:57] world remember God told
[1:08:59] Jeremiah before you were formed in your
[1:09:02] mother's
[1:09:03] wom I knew you before you were even
[1:09:08] conceived I knew you so he already had a
[1:09:12] purpose for
[1:09:14] him he was going to be a prophet before
[1:09:17] he was even
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:20] born each and every child of God has a
[1:09:24] purpose amen amen in this world they
[1:09:27] tell you you can become whatever you
[1:09:30] want you shouldn't become whatever you
[1:09:33] want you should become what God wants
[1:09:36] you to
[1:09:38] be because he is the one who has their
[1:09:40] purpose for
[1:09:41] you he is the one who he is the one who
[1:09:45] created
[1:09:47] you when you buy a
[1:09:50] device or anything that you have to
[1:09:53] assemble you have to to go and try and
[1:09:56] find the owner's
[1:09:59] manual and this owner's manual was
[1:10:02] written by the person who created
[1:10:07] it you can say I'm
[1:10:10] smart and you will spend five hours
[1:10:13] trying to figure out which P which piece
[1:10:15] goes
[1:10:18] where but all you need to do go find the
[1:10:22] user manual
[1:10:25] that was created by the maker of
[1:10:29] it and it will tell you the interned
[1:10:32] purpose of
[1:10:35] it God has your us
[1:10:38] manual it is
[1:10:40] written what you were supposed to
[1:10:43] do what your internal purpose
[1:10:47] is so if you go to him he will tell you
[1:10:51] your
[1:10:52] purpose amen amen Hallelujah but Satan
[1:10:57] he tries to bring sin and confuse
[1:11:01] us so that we lose our
[1:11:05] position but we thank God for his
[1:11:08] grace we thank God for the message of
[1:11:10] the
[1:11:12] jub that came to remind us that you have
[1:11:16] been free in the from the first
[1:11:19] place go back to where you belong
[1:11:25] go back to your
[1:11:27] position Amen in a jubile the prophet of
[1:11:31] God
[1:11:33] says says many hundred years has
[1:11:36] passed but the same God that sent the
[1:11:39] jubilees in them
[1:11:42] days is the same God who sends jubilees
[1:11:47] today all the people that had been
[1:11:51] captured that was in captivity
[1:11:55] come an acceptable
[1:11:58] year where the trumpet
[1:12:01] sounded and all the ones that were in
[1:12:05] captivity didn't have to pay any
[1:12:08] price they could absolutely Go
[1:12:11] free they could drop their ho if they
[1:12:13] were
[1:12:15] hoing whatever instrument they were
[1:12:17] working
[1:12:20] with they would have to drop it because
[1:12:23] the trumpet has sounded
[1:12:27] without money or without price you have
[1:12:30] to go back to your
[1:12:31] position I'm here to tell you that the
[1:12:34] blood of
[1:12:35] Christ was enough to pay for the
[1:12:39] promises all you just have to do is walk
[1:12:41] back and claim
[1:12:44] it because it belongs to
[1:12:47] you amen
[1:12:50] amen in return in Jubilee the prophet of
[1:12:53] God says
[1:12:56] he says somehow the individual lost
[1:12:57] their
[1:13:01] inheritance that was given to them by
[1:13:05] God there
[1:13:07] came a year called The Jubilee
[1:13:12] year every seven years they had to
[1:13:16] rest and in this
[1:13:19] Jubilee every man that had lost his
[1:13:21] inheritance by some means
[1:13:25] if he was a Freeborn and true blooded
[1:13:29] Israelite no matter who held the
[1:13:33] position it had to go back to him
[1:13:38] free he didn't have to pay a
[1:13:41] thing he didn't have to do a
[1:13:43] thing but just stop what he was
[1:13:47] doing and go back to his
[1:13:50] inheritance the Israelites could go
[1:13:53] free but the slaves could
[1:13:56] not amen and we know we Are Spiritual
[1:14:01] Israel amen if you are bought by the
[1:14:05] blood of
[1:14:06] Christ and you are
[1:14:08] saved you are a child of
[1:14:11] Abraham and that guarantees you each and
[1:14:15] every promise that God has for the
[1:14:16] children of
[1:14:19] Abraham amen the promise is only for the
[1:14:22] predestinated seed
[1:14:25] hallelujah amen how many believe they
[1:14:28] are predestinated this
[1:14:30] morning Hallelujah if you raise your
[1:14:33] hand God's promise is to
[1:14:35] you amen not no one
[1:14:39] else and on the 10th day of the seventh
[1:14:43] month these sins would would be
[1:14:47] forgiven but we now know that the sea
[1:14:50] the sins are thrown in the sea of
[1:14:52] forgetfulness
[1:14:56] once God forgives
[1:14:58] you he does not
[1:15:01] remember I had one brother went to um he
[1:15:04] went to Brother
[1:15:06] brandham and says brother
[1:15:08] Bram I always feel guilty about a sin I
[1:15:11] committed a while
[1:15:14] ago he says every time I just feel
[1:15:16] guilty and I keep on repenting about
[1:15:21] it I keep on kneeling down and say Lord
[1:15:24] I'm sorry about this thing that I
[1:15:27] did the prophet of God told him you know
[1:15:31] what every time you kneel down to
[1:15:35] pray God is hearing that sin for the
[1:15:38] first
[1:15:40] time because he doesn't remember
[1:15:45] it when you kneel down to
[1:15:48] pray say Lord I'm sorry for what I
[1:15:51] did he doesn't even remember what it is
[1:15:55] because he already forgave
[1:15:57] you and he does not
[1:16:00] remember but the
[1:16:02] people people never
[1:16:04] forget when God when God throws it in
[1:16:07] the sea of
[1:16:09] forgetfulness we have very good
[1:16:13] fishermen that like taking a
[1:16:16] rod and throw it in that sea of
[1:16:21] forgetfulness and reel it out
[1:16:25] no matter how much you have
[1:16:27] changed they'll come to you and says we
[1:16:29] have the
[1:16:31] receipts 10 years ago you did this you
[1:16:35] did
[1:16:36] that I don't care about that God says I
[1:16:40] never did in the first
[1:16:42] place if you confessed
[1:16:44] it God forgave it it does not matter
[1:16:48] what people
[1:16:50] say what matters is what does God say
[1:16:53] about it
[1:16:55] and God's word says I'm
[1:16:57] Justified I haven't even done it in the
[1:16:59] first
[1:17:00] place amen so brother sister if you have
[1:17:04] confessed
[1:17:05] it you haven't even done it in the first
[1:17:09] place God does not remember
[1:17:12] it do not let men or Satan try to
[1:17:15] condemn you for something God already
[1:17:17] forgave
[1:17:19] you because him who the son has set free
[1:17:25] free
[1:17:26] indeed there is no going
[1:17:29] back
[1:17:30] Hallelujah so when the priest was going
[1:17:33] to sacrifice for this day of
[1:17:37] atonement they were examining the
[1:17:41] lamb that was representing the
[1:17:45] people and God told them God take a lamb
[1:17:49] that does not have any
[1:17:52] blemish and this lamb was representing
[1:17:55] people that had
[1:17:59] blemishes and when the priest was
[1:18:01] examining this
[1:18:03] lamb he would see that he doesn't have
[1:18:06] any
[1:18:07] fault he doesn't have any spot or
[1:18:10] wrinkle or any
[1:18:12] blemish and they'll say this is a
[1:18:14] perfect
[1:18:17] lamb and they would sacrifice
[1:18:19] it so the perfect lamb was representing
[1:18:23] the people
[1:18:25] but the priest was not examining the
[1:18:29] people he was examining the lamb that
[1:18:31] was representing the
[1:18:34] people so examining the perfect
[1:18:38] lamb was signifying that the people have
[1:18:40] been made
[1:18:43] perfect amen so God he provided his
[1:18:50] lamb when he wanted to pay the ultimate
[1:18:52] sacrifice
[1:18:57] he sent a
[1:18:58] lamb his own son Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ and before he went to
[1:19:05] Calvary they sent him to be
[1:19:08] examined pilate
[1:19:11] says I find no fault in
[1:19:13] him this man is perfect they couldn't
[1:19:17] find a reason why they were crucifying
[1:19:20] him what were they doing they were
[1:19:23] fulfilling the scriptures
[1:19:25] the lamb had to be
[1:19:28] examined and Jesus Christ was the
[1:19:30] perfect
[1:19:32] lamb that did not commit any
[1:19:35] sin he was the only man who never ever
[1:19:38] committed any
[1:19:41] sin hallelujah amen so when they looked
[1:19:44] at the perfect lamb
[1:19:46] Christ who was representing you and
[1:19:50] me Christ did not have any blemish or
[1:19:53] spot or wrinkle
[1:19:58] he was perfect so when you got to God In
[1:20:03] Prayer he does not look at your
[1:20:06] mistakes he looks at the
[1:20:09] lamb and the lamb is Christ who is
[1:20:12] perfect Hallelujah so we can stand
[1:20:16] perfect and blameless before
[1:20:19] God because he does not look at you and
[1:20:22] me he looks at the lamb that he sent to
[1:20:26] us hallelujah when you were supposed to
[1:20:29] be
[1:20:30] guilty he looks at the lamb the lamb say
[1:20:34] is not
[1:20:35] guilty when you are
[1:20:37] unworthy he looks at the lamb and the
[1:20:40] lamb says it's
[1:20:42] worthy so he looks at the lamb and
[1:20:45] examines the Lamb on your
[1:20:47] behalf and he see the lamb is perfect so
[1:20:51] you can stand before him blameless and
[1:20:53] perfect
[1:20:56] the prophet of God says that's the way
[1:20:57] it is
[1:20:59] today we are guilty unworthy and she
[1:21:03] die we are guilty and unworthy we should
[1:21:09] die we are not worthy of
[1:21:12] leaving we are not worthy to even come
[1:21:15] to
[1:21:16] Christ we are not worthy to ask for
[1:21:20] anything but God never looks at your
[1:21:23] unworthiness
[1:21:25] Hallelujah he looked at the
[1:21:28] lamb now if he can find no fault in
[1:21:33] Christ then you are free if he can't
[1:21:37] find fault in the
[1:21:39] lamb then there is no fault in the
[1:21:41] person
[1:21:42] either see he died in your
[1:21:45] stad there's no fault with
[1:21:48] him so you are free God doesn't examine
[1:21:53] you he examines the
[1:21:56] lamb you say I'm not worthy to walk out
[1:21:58] of this
[1:22:02] wheelchair that's why you are not
[1:22:05] worthy but God doesn't examine
[1:22:08] you he examined
[1:22:11] Christ is worthy then you can walk out
[1:22:14] of that
[1:22:15] wheelchair depends on what you think
[1:22:17] about
[1:22:18] it you can say brother Bram I'm an Al
[1:22:22] I'm an I'm an awful woman
[1:22:25] I've lived
[1:22:27] illegally I've even broke my marriage
[1:22:31] vows and you can say Mr
[1:22:34] Bram I tell you I've been a
[1:22:38] drunker I've done this I've done that
[1:22:41] but no matter what you
[1:22:43] done God never looks at
[1:22:46] you he looks at the
[1:22:48] lamb and he has already accepted the
[1:22:52] lamb so you are free
[1:22:55] God can't see
[1:22:56] you he sees the lamb that dies in your
[1:23:00] stad Hallelujah that's enough to make
[1:23:04] you
[1:23:06] shout when you think about it upon the
[1:23:09] basis of the
[1:23:12] word hallelujah it makes me get so much
[1:23:18] joy to know that God does not look at
[1:23:22] me Jesus Christ
[1:23:25] and Jesus Christ is
[1:23:27] perfect so all my
[1:23:30] mistakes God does not see them he looks
[1:23:33] at Christ in my on my
[1:23:35] behalf and because Christ shed his blood
[1:23:38] for
[1:23:39] me being set free indeed turn around to
[1:23:43] your neighbor and say I've set free
[1:23:47] indeed hallelujah amen so atonement is a
[1:23:52] Reconciliation between God and man
[1:23:56] because sin separated God from his
[1:24:01] people but the high priest would go
[1:24:04] sprinkle that
[1:24:06] blood to for God to forgive the sins so
[1:24:09] he can be reconciled back to his
[1:24:14] people and the Old Testament was a
[1:24:16] shadow of the
[1:24:18] new if you open our Bibles to the Book
[1:24:21] of Luke 4 and verse 17
[1:24:28] Luke the scenery we are
[1:24:31] reading is when Jesus had gone to the um
[1:24:37] synagogue and they say every day in the
[1:24:39] synagogue when they went to
[1:24:43] church they gave seven men that would
[1:24:46] have to open the scroll and read
[1:24:52] it and Jesus was the seventh man to read
[1:24:55] the
[1:24:59] scroll and he was given the
[1:25:02] Bible which was the SC the Scrolls in
[1:25:04] that
[1:25:06] day and it says and there was delivered
[1:25:08] unto him a book of the Prophet
[1:25:13] isas say
[1:25:15] Isaiah and when he had opened the
[1:25:18] book he found the place where it was
[1:25:22] written the spirit of the Lord is is
[1:25:24] upon
[1:25:25] me because he has anointed me to preach
[1:25:28] the gospel to the
[1:25:32] poor he had sent me to heal the
[1:25:37] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:25:39] the
[1:25:41] captives recovering of sight to the
[1:25:45] blind to set at Liberty them that are
[1:25:50] bruised to preach the acceptable year
[1:25:56] and he closed the
[1:25:59] book and he gave it again to the
[1:26:03] minister and sat
[1:26:05] down and the eyes of all them that were
[1:26:08] in the
[1:26:13] synagogue were fasting on
[1:26:16] him and he unto
[1:26:19] them this
[1:26:21] day this scripture
[1:26:24] as fulfilled in your
[1:26:26] ears Hallelujah he didn't he he didn't
[1:26:30] go back to the Book of
[1:26:32] Genesis he went to the
[1:26:35] part that was talking about
[1:26:39] him he went into the book of
[1:26:42] Isaiah so in other words he was telling
[1:26:46] them what his mission
[1:26:49] was was telling them what he had been
[1:26:52] sent on Earth for
[1:26:56] after he read and says this is what I've
[1:26:58] been sent to
[1:27:01] do this day this scripture is
[1:27:05] fulfilled amen amen and verse 19 says he
[1:27:09] says to preach the acceptable year of
[1:27:11] the
[1:27:13] Lord the prophet tells us that he says
[1:27:17] the acceptable year of the
[1:27:19] Lord in the old
[1:27:21] writings is the Year of Jubilee
[1:27:25] so in other words he was saying I have
[1:27:28] come to
[1:27:29] preach the Year of
[1:27:31] Jubilee Amen to set free all those that
[1:27:34] were
[1:27:37] bound bound by
[1:27:40] sicknesses Bound by
[1:27:42] blindness he says I have come to break
[1:27:45] those
[1:27:46] chains and I have come to give
[1:27:49] Liberty amen and they saw it when he was
[1:27:53] walking on the streets of
[1:27:56] Jerusalem Mary Magdalene magd she would
[1:27:59] give a
[1:28:01] testimony and say I was bound by seven
[1:28:04] demons and Christ came to set her
[1:28:08] free
[1:28:10] Hallelujah
[1:28:12] Legion will say I was bound by a
[1:28:14] thousand
[1:28:15] demons but because of Amazing
[1:28:18] Grace Jesus Christ set me
[1:28:23] free Hallelujah Lazarus he will say I
[1:28:28] was bound by the chains of
[1:28:30] death but when Jesus came he set me
[1:28:35] free Hallelujah one day he was on the
[1:28:38] sea with his
[1:28:41] disciples and the demons started being
[1:28:44] troubless on the Sea of
[1:28:47] Galilee and they started causing
[1:28:50] waves but because he was the high priest
[1:28:54] that had been sent who was the final one
[1:28:56] of them
[1:28:58] all when he spoke peace be
[1:29:02] still all those demons on the Sea of
[1:29:05] Galilee had to calm down they had to
[1:29:10] stop because he was sounding
[1:29:14] Jubilee if Christ speaks peace be still
[1:29:17] in your
[1:29:19] life no demons can trouble you no
[1:29:22] more Hallelujah
[1:29:24] because that's his mission he says
[1:29:27] that's what I've been sent
[1:29:30] for he wasn't sent for the
[1:29:32] self-righteous
[1:29:34] people he wasn't sent for the Pharisees
[1:29:37] and the
[1:29:39] Sadducees but he says I was sent to
[1:29:42] preach Deliverance to the
[1:29:45] captives I have come to heal the
[1:29:49] brokenhearted so brother sister if you
[1:29:51] are
[1:29:52] bound I got good news for you Christ
[1:29:55] came to set you
[1:29:57] free if you have a broken
[1:30:00] heart he can M your
[1:30:03] heart amen he has come to set you
[1:30:07] free he has come to give you
[1:30:11] Liberty Hallelujah and he was anointed
[1:30:14] for the
[1:30:16] job he was
[1:30:18] saying this is my
[1:30:21] mission and no one else could take that
[1:30:24] position from
[1:30:25] him cuz that's what he had been created
[1:30:29] for when God creates you for
[1:30:33] something no one can take that place
[1:30:35] from
[1:30:37] you amen am you are unique no one can
[1:30:42] step in your
[1:30:44] place Hallelujah remember
[1:30:47] David David was
[1:30:50] King in God's mind David was King
[1:30:54] but when the prophet Samuel came to
[1:30:56] Jesse's
[1:30:58] house they were looking for the
[1:31:01] king and there were seven
[1:31:04] others more eligible looking
[1:31:08] people that looked like they could be
[1:31:12] Kings even the prophet Samuel thought
[1:31:15] that sha and all of the brothers they
[1:31:18] could be
[1:31:21] Kings and he had that horn of oil
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:26] he he tried to pour
[1:31:29] it nothing came
[1:31:31] out number two
[1:31:34] came he tried to pour
[1:31:36] it nothing came out three four five six
[1:31:42] came he tried to
[1:31:44] pour nothing came
[1:31:46] out number seven came tried to
[1:31:51] pour nothing came out and Samuel is like
[1:31:55] something is wrong
[1:31:56] here because God's word never
[1:31:59] fails then he's like are you sure
[1:32:01] there's no other
[1:32:04] one there's like oh yeah there's a
[1:32:06] little boy who's out
[1:32:09] there he's taking care of the
[1:32:12] sheep you see even David's own
[1:32:16] father didn't even consider him to be
[1:32:19] able to be a
[1:32:21] king but God
[1:32:24] that purpose for
[1:32:25] him says oh yeah this little boy he's
[1:32:27] busy shepherding the
[1:32:30] Sheep then the prophet is like go call
[1:32:33] him let him come over because the king
[1:32:37] is definitely not one of these
[1:32:39] seven when David came and he Nails right
[1:32:44] there the oil started coming
[1:32:47] out Hallelujah because that was his
[1:32:52] purpose it does not matter how many
[1:32:54] people come before
[1:32:56] you if it is yours it is
[1:33:00] yours no one can take away what's
[1:33:04] yours because it is your
[1:33:08] predestinated god
[1:33:11] G your
[1:33:14] predestinated God given
[1:33:18] inheritance
[1:33:20] Hallelujah so your
[1:33:22] anointing is
[1:33:24] alone what God Made You
[1:33:27] for is yours
[1:33:29] alone no one can come in undo it or try
[1:33:33] and tell you that no you cannot do
[1:33:36] it and your
[1:33:38] anointing your
[1:33:40] purpose will sustain
[1:33:44] you if you haven't completed the
[1:33:48] purpose that God brought you on this
[1:33:50] Earth
[1:33:51] for nothing will happen to you
[1:33:55] because that anointing will protect
[1:33:58] you it will have a fence around
[1:34:02] you David was anointed to be
[1:34:05] king but then he went right back to the
[1:34:10] Sheep but he knew I'm supposed to be
[1:34:14] king then one day his father sent him to
[1:34:17] go give um his brother some food
[1:34:24] who were in the
[1:34:25] Army you know the whole
[1:34:27] story and he saw
[1:34:30] Goliath who was disrespecting the army
[1:34:34] of the Living
[1:34:36] God David looked at him and he looked at
[1:34:41] himself and he knew he was
[1:34:45] anointed to be
[1:34:47] king So no matter what was going to be
[1:34:51] happen he wasn't going to die until he
[1:34:54] became a
[1:34:57] king so even if Goliath swung a sword at
[1:35:02] him nothing was going to happen to
[1:35:05] him because God anointed him to become a
[1:35:09] king Hallelujah that's why he took that
[1:35:13] stone he put it in that
[1:35:15] sling sling short he swung it around he
[1:35:19] swung it
[1:35:20] around and he just let it go
[1:35:24] God was responsible to bring that
[1:35:28] Victory because in God's books David was
[1:35:33] King so whatever God has to be for
[1:35:37] you nothing will
[1:35:39] happen until you become
[1:35:42] that sickness cannot take you
[1:35:45] out until you become
[1:35:48] that death cannot take you out until you
[1:35:52] become that
[1:35:54] because God's word stands for
[1:35:57] sure the Bible says God's word when it
[1:36:00] is
[1:36:00] spoken it doesn't come back to him void
[1:36:04] but it only comes back to
[1:36:06] him after it has
[1:36:09] accomplished that which he has sent it
[1:36:12] for
[1:36:13] am oh turn around to your neighbor and
[1:36:16] say I know my
[1:36:18] purpose say nothing can touch
[1:36:22] me Hallelujah am amen
[1:36:27] amen so that was Jesus mission H that
[1:36:31] was
[1:36:33] Jesus that was his
[1:36:35] mission come to redeem you and
[1:36:39] me no one else could do it there were so
[1:36:43] many prophets that
[1:36:45] came but none of them could do
[1:36:48] it it only take the unblemished Lamb of
[1:36:51] God Jesus Christ
[1:36:56] he's the only one who could pay your
[1:36:58] price he's the only one who could
[1:37:00] forgive your
[1:37:02] sin that's why when he was in that
[1:37:04] Garden of
[1:37:06] gsan he thought about it he says Lord if
[1:37:11] this cup could pass over
[1:37:14] me I would let
[1:37:17] it but you know
[1:37:19] what he had you on his mind
[1:37:23] had me on his
[1:37:25] mind he says but
[1:37:28] nevertheless I will
[1:37:31] go Jesus was man and
[1:37:35] God but when he went to
[1:37:38] Calvary he was not
[1:37:40] God he was only man because he had to
[1:37:44] carry your
[1:37:45] sins and my
[1:37:47] sins God Is So righteous he cannot touch
[1:37:52] sin so God had to leave
[1:37:55] him and he had to walk all the way to
[1:37:59] Calvary as a man carrying the sins of
[1:38:03] the whole
[1:38:04] world you know that thing you did last
[1:38:07] week he was carrying it to the
[1:38:10] Cross he carried it as a
[1:38:13] man that's why he said why has Thou
[1:38:17] forsaken
[1:38:20] me my God why has Thou forsaken me
[1:38:24] because God had left
[1:38:26] him and he went to Calvary as a
[1:38:30] man so he became our
[1:38:32] sin so we could become his
[1:38:36] righteousness Hallelujah he became
[1:38:39] sick so we could be
[1:38:42] healed he became poor so we could be
[1:38:46] rich so you do not have to live under
[1:38:49] your
[1:38:51] privileges because Christ already Di
[1:38:53] done that for
[1:38:54] you when you were praying you say God I
[1:38:59] know you already did this 2,000 years
[1:39:03] ago I'm claiming it it's already there
[1:39:07] that's all you have to do is claim
[1:39:09] it and he went on the cross of
[1:39:12] Calvary as a man carrying all your
[1:39:17] sins and after that after he his Spirit
[1:39:22] left
[1:39:24] and he
[1:39:26] died they took him
[1:39:28] down and they put him in a borrowed
[1:39:33] grave I thought about it for a minute I
[1:39:36] was like I've never heard of a borrowed
[1:39:39] grave who has ever heard of someone
[1:39:41] being uh
[1:39:43] buried in a borrowed
[1:39:46] grave they buried him in the grave of
[1:39:49] Joseph of Ara
[1:39:54] so what was Joseph of AR going to do
[1:39:57] when he was going to
[1:40:00] die because Jesus would have already
[1:40:02] taken his
[1:40:05] grave they didn't even know what they
[1:40:07] were
[1:40:08] doing but there was a prophetic
[1:40:11] gesture that borrowing a grave meant he
[1:40:15] wasn't staying in
[1:40:17] there it meant he was going to come
[1:40:20] out Hallelujah he was going to come out
[1:40:24] Victorious so he was a man who died
[1:40:28] remember Jesus was both man and
[1:40:32] God he was the prophet says he was 100%
[1:40:35] men and 100%
[1:40:39] God so he was not 50% man and 50%
[1:40:44] God because that would be unfair to you
[1:40:46] and
[1:40:50] me if he was 50% man and 50%
[1:40:54] God he wouldn't feel exactly what you're
[1:40:56] going
[1:40:59] through but he wouldn't have enough
[1:41:01] power he also wouldn't have enough power
[1:41:04] as God to overcome
[1:41:07] it but he was a 100% man and 100% God
[1:41:13] that's why he says he's the high
[1:41:15] priest by the feeling of our
[1:41:18] infirmities so whatever you are going
[1:41:21] through whatever you were going through
[1:41:25] he says I know because he's been through
[1:41:29] it there's no temptation you can go
[1:41:31] through that Jesus never went
[1:41:35] through so whenever you are going
[1:41:37] through whatever you were going
[1:41:39] through say Lord I know you
[1:41:42] know if it were
[1:41:45] you how would you feel being in this
[1:41:49] position and he is touched by that
[1:41:51] feeling because he went through it
[1:41:54] and he able to come deliver
[1:41:56] you he was man enough he was man enough
[1:42:01] to go through each and everything you
[1:42:03] went
[1:42:05] through but he is God enough to deliver
[1:42:08] you out of all that you are going
[1:42:11] through Hallelujah so they laid him in a
[1:42:15] borrowed
[1:42:17] grave not knowing what they were doing
[1:42:19] they were already
[1:42:20] prophesying that he's not staying there
[1:42:22] he's coming
[1:42:25] out Friday night they put him in
[1:42:29] there and they had lost all hope we
[1:42:33] thought he was going to Deliver Us from
[1:42:34] the Roman
[1:42:35] government but they didn't know while
[1:42:37] his body was laying in the
[1:42:40] grave he had another
[1:42:42] mission before he arose there is one
[1:42:46] more stop he had to
[1:42:48] make because remember the key of death
[1:42:51] Hell In The Grave was held by Satan
[1:42:57] so he wasn't going to be victorious if
[1:42:59] he wasn't going to come and overcome
[1:43:03] him so whil his body was laying in the
[1:43:07] grave he went down to Hell and the
[1:43:11] prophet of God talks about it he says he
[1:43:13] went in and opened that
[1:43:15] door and the in torment he
[1:43:18] says 57
[1:43:21] 0420 57 70420 paragraph 87 he
[1:43:26] says I can hear him say
[1:43:29] Satan come here he is boss
[1:43:34] now he say Satan come
[1:43:37] here Jesus he is boss
[1:43:40] now he reaches over and take that key of
[1:43:44] death and hell off his
[1:43:47] side and hung it on his own
[1:43:51] side and Jesus said to say Satan I want
[1:43:53] to serve notice onto
[1:43:57] you you've been a bluff long
[1:44:01] enough I'm a virgin born son of the
[1:44:04] Living
[1:44:05] God my blood is still wet on the
[1:44:09] cross my blood is still wet on the
[1:44:16] cross and the full debt is
[1:44:20] paid you have no rights no
[1:44:23] more you are stripped he says give me
[1:44:27] those
[1:44:28] keys that's right and Jesus turns around
[1:44:32] and gives him a good healthy
[1:44:36] kick and slams the door together and say
[1:44:40] you stay in there I am boss from now
[1:44:45] on and he had overcome death hell and
[1:44:48] the
[1:44:49] grave because he had taken those keys
[1:44:52] from Satan
[1:44:54] Hallelujah they were all
[1:44:57] crying
[1:44:59] Friday Saturday they were
[1:45:01] crying they didn't know what was going
[1:45:04] on but they forgotten he had said you
[1:45:07] can take down this Temple but I'll
[1:45:09] rebuild it in three
[1:45:12] days all the that were given in the Old
[1:45:17] Testament we coming into
[1:45:20] fruition Hallelujah and Sunday early
[1:45:25] morning there was no grave that could
[1:45:27] hold him
[1:45:29] back they tried to seal his
[1:45:33] tomb but that wasn't going to hold him
[1:45:37] back and there was an earthquake That
[1:45:40] Shook and he came out of that
[1:45:43] grave he came out
[1:45:46] Victorious Hallelujah mission
[1:45:49] accomplished it sounded that Jubilee
[1:45:53] he has broken all the
[1:45:55] chains he has set the captives
[1:45:58] free he did it 2,000 years
[1:46:01] ago but you can still claim it
[1:46:04] today the blood of Christ never loses
[1:46:07] its
[1:46:08] power is as powerful as it was back
[1:46:13] then hallelujah you just have to believe
[1:46:18] it believe the word the prophet of God
[1:46:21] says
[1:46:23] believe
[1:46:25] it the evidence will
[1:46:28] follow I'll read it right quick it says
[1:46:31] as soon as you hear the
[1:46:33] word that God says you can be set
[1:46:38] free believe
[1:46:40] it Rejoice with
[1:46:43] it oh I like this part it says God will
[1:46:47] show the evidence after you have
[1:46:49] accepted it
[1:46:53] But first you accept
[1:46:55] it that's all you need to
[1:46:58] do he says Christ died for
[1:47:01] Sinners I believe it I accept it I start
[1:47:07] rejoicing Works righteousness by
[1:47:11] it I believe he was stripped for my
[1:47:15] healing I believe it I accept
[1:47:18] it God's work's healing for me
[1:47:25] soon as I believe it he can't help me
[1:47:29] till I
[1:47:30] believe so you have to believe it and
[1:47:34] confess
[1:47:35] it and then
[1:47:37] God know that he has an
[1:47:40] option not that he has to choose to but
[1:47:44] the word says God under
[1:47:48] obligation to his word all you have to
[1:47:51] do is accept it
[1:47:54] do you remember Mary Mary was told
[1:47:56] you're going to
[1:47:58] conceive as soon as she said amen that's
[1:48:02] when God started working in
[1:48:04] her she hadn't seen the baby yet but she
[1:48:08] ran to
[1:48:09] Elizabeth said I've had good
[1:48:12] news I'm carrying the

[1:52:50] word amen amen Amen in 52810
[1:52:56] a the prophet of God
[1:52:58] says when the children of Israel was led
[1:53:01] out of
[1:53:03] Egypt God promised to take care of
[1:53:06] them as they Journey Through the
[1:53:11] Wilderness God said he will take care of
[1:53:13] them and he did do
[1:53:16] it no matter where the path
[1:53:20] LED if any en got in it God in God's
[1:53:24] path it gave
[1:53:28] way that's why you need to trust God
[1:53:32] even if you don't understand
[1:53:35] it just go do it because God knows what
[1:53:39] he's
[1:53:40] doing you don't know what he is
[1:53:43] doing he says I can see them come up to
[1:53:45] the Red
[1:53:47] Sea God had his map draw out
[1:53:53] the way he was going to take them he
[1:53:54] knew
[1:53:56] it so God delivered the children of
[1:53:59] Israel out of
[1:54:00] Egypt setting them
[1:54:03] free and he's leading them right into
[1:54:06] the Red
[1:54:08] Sea the children of Israel have no idea
[1:54:11] why is
[1:54:12] this Moses does not know why is
[1:54:16] this he is just following the pillar of
[1:54:20] fire and the cloud by day
[1:54:24] that's what we need to do in this last
[1:54:26] days follow the pillar of
[1:54:28] fire follow the word it will never lead
[1:54:32] you
[1:54:34] astray and he says God had his map Dr
[1:54:40] out and he knew the way he was going to
[1:54:42] take
[1:54:44] them they will move right up to the Red
[1:54:48] Sea there's no way at all to cross it
[1:54:53] and he was Pharaoh's
[1:54:55] Army mountains on one
[1:54:58] side Pharaoh's Army on one
[1:55:01] side and the red she right in front of
[1:55:05] them Moses lifted up his
[1:55:08] hands says God looked
[1:55:12] down he seen that path laying right on
[1:55:16] the bottom of the
[1:55:20] sea there was his children right
[1:55:23] there needing a
[1:55:26] promise take word they were taking God
[1:55:31] at his word but they didn't know that
[1:55:33] God already had a path laid out under
[1:55:35] the
[1:55:37] sea
[1:55:39] amen paragraph
[1:55:42] 25 the prophet says God looked down
[1:55:44] through that Pillar of
[1:55:47] Fire and with angered
[1:55:50] eyes when he when the sea he did the sea
[1:55:55] got scared and moved back like
[1:56:00] that and he made a dry
[1:56:03] path and Israel walked through on dry
[1:56:07] ground take God at his
[1:56:09] word hallelujah amen God looked at that
[1:56:14] sea with Angry Eyes and that sea got
[1:56:18] scared and he had to open away
[1:56:22] they could walk through I don't care
[1:56:24] what your problem is I don't care what
[1:56:27] that trouble is when God looks at it
[1:56:30] with his Angry
[1:56:31] Eyes it got to give way so that you go
[1:56:36] through because that's the way he has
[1:56:38] provided for
[1:56:41] you when he looks at your
[1:56:43] sickness with Angry Eyes that sickness
[1:56:47] got to
[1:56:48] go when he looks at your depression
[1:56:52] Angry Eyes that depression got to
[1:56:56] go because God knows what he is
[1:56:59] doing you remember the three Hebrew
[1:57:02] boys they were being told they were
[1:57:04] going to go into the
[1:57:06] fire the prophet talks about this the
[1:57:09] angel started asking one went to
[1:57:12] God and say Lord me please let me
[1:57:17] go I want this
[1:57:19] assignment shed Mish in the bed Neo
[1:57:23] had been told they were going into the
[1:57:26] fire Gabriel said Lord please let me
[1:57:31] go God says no no no this is not you
[1:57:34] wormwood the angel called wormwood
[1:57:37] came the angel called wormwood
[1:57:42] came the angel that caused the the
[1:57:44] floods to rain in the days of
[1:57:48] Noah and you said Lord you know in the
[1:57:51] days of Noah did a very good
[1:57:54] assignment let me go and water down that
[1:57:58] fire God said no this is not you another
[1:58:02] angel came and said Lord please send me
[1:58:06] God said no this is my own
[1:58:09] assignments when it comes to my
[1:58:12] children who are standing for me it
[1:58:15] becomes my personal
[1:58:17] assignment Hallelujah and when they were
[1:58:20] thrown in the fire
[1:58:23] there is no
[1:58:25] heat that got to
[1:58:27] them they were not even smelling like
[1:58:31] smoke that's why the people who had
[1:58:33] thrown them
[1:58:35] in they were behind them but the people
[1:58:39] who threw them in who were behind them
[1:58:40] are the ones who got
[1:58:42] burned
[1:58:44] Hallelujah and the chains that were
[1:58:46] binding them got burnt by the
[1:58:50] fire but not even one hair on their head
[1:58:53] got
[1:58:55] Burns why because God was delivering his
[1:58:57] own
[1:58:59] children when it comes to his
[1:59:01] children God takes personal
[1:59:05] responsibility amen he says you are my
[1:59:09] responsibility so in any Affairs that
[1:59:12] concern you know that God is coming on
[1:59:15] the
[1:59:15] scene and when he comes on the sin he's
[1:59:19] going to deliver you
[1:59:22] nothing is going to stop in God's way my
[1:59:26] brother

[1:59:44] just your
[1:59:45] brother by the grace of God but when the
[1:59:49] angel of the Lord moves down
[1:59:53] it becomes then a voice of God to
[1:59:57] you says maybe if I offended you by
[2:00:00] saying that forgive
[2:00:02] me but I felt that might have been
[2:00:08] resented but I'm God's voice to

[2:00:20] first time

[2:00:27] myself but what he shows
[2:00:30] me you believe it and Watch What
