[40:58] there's somebody here that can praise
[41:07] the Lord it's good to be in his person
[41:10] his name he's here you realize that
[41:15] right now but we're sitting in the seat
[41:19] where all things are possible let that
[41:22] sink in for a moment right now we're
[41:26] gathered together in a place where all
[41:29] things are possible maybe you read
[41:32] stories in the Bible about blind eyes
[41:34] being open we read stories about the
[41:37] dead being raised back to life I hear
[41:39] stories about withered arms being made
[41:42] straight again I want to declare to you
[41:45] the gospel of Jesus Christ he's the same
[41:48] yesterday today and forever and he's
[41:53] here to meet your knee
[41:55] maybe you've been believing for somebody
[41:57] somebody else may maybe you have
[42:02] something that's been on your heart
[42:05] the Masters here he has come and you
[42:10] know that the world looks at grandeur it
[42:13] looks at glitter and fancy programs but
[42:18] it's little humble places like this
[42:21] where Jesus comes
[42:23] [Music]
[42:24] you know before the world ever formed I
[42:29] want you to catch this now before the
[42:32] world was ever formed he knew that we
[42:35] would be in this place tonight
[42:38] and if he knew you would be here
[42:43] then he have something for you you know
[42:46] whenever Jesus came it was never the
[42:48] same Jesus just didn't come with no
[42:53] agenda he didn't come with no purpose
[42:56] but when Jesus came he come to perform
[43:00] something he said I do nothing but look
[43:05] what the father shows me to do he said I
[43:08] must go by Samaria
[43:10] he said I must go this way and tonight
[43:15] the Lord Jesus says I must come here
[43:19] because I have my bride that's gathered
[43:22] together they've been praying and
[43:24] they've been faithful and I've come
[43:27] tonight to prove to them I'm the same
[43:30] yesterday today and forever let's just
[43:32] approach the Lord and pray our Heavenly
[43:33] Father how we love you and we thank you
[43:37] for the victory that you have wrought in
[43:39] our life Lord to know that when you
[43:42] spread your arms there on Calvary and
[43:44] you said it is finished Lord we're still
[43:48] trying to grasp the revelation what
[43:52] truly that means the Lord with the
[43:55] little understanding and the unfolding
[43:57] revelation that you've given us Lord we
[44:01] thank you for it we thank you that you
[44:04] paid the price for our sins and that
[44:06] you've forgiven us Lord and that we
[44:09] could come and be gathered together and
[44:11] just be able to worship the Lord in
[44:13] spirit and in truth we're not because of
[44:16] anything that we've done Lord but by
[44:19] your grace but if every one that's
[44:22] gathered Lord we could say it's by grace
[44:26] how we thank you for your grace Lord let
[44:30] us never lose sight of Calvary Lord not
[44:34] let us never think that were somebody or
[44:36] we deserved it
[44:37] but what may we out there we always know
[44:40] it's by your divine grace that you
[44:44] imparted to us and for that Lord we give
[44:46] you our lives that's why we serve you
[44:48] Lord that's why we've come tonight they
[44:51] haven't come to be seen of man we
[44:52] haven't done with some agenda but we
[44:56] come because we love you Lord Lord as I
[44:58] heard the prophets say one time
[45:01] he said I'm tired
[45:04] week my toes are bunched up in my shoes
[45:06] I can't sleep I can barely talk oh it
[45:12] was love that drove me to do Lord and
[45:15] we're driven by the same love that
[45:16] you've given in our hearts Lord a baby
[45:19] shed abroad one to another
[45:20] oh we commit the service to you we thank
[45:23] you for this and the lovely name of the
[45:28] Lord Jesus Christ really looks just turn
[45:33] in our Bibles a man it's good to be in
[45:37] the presence of the Lord I mean once
[45:40] again we're just humbled by the
[45:41] invitation of her brother Isaiah Brooks
[45:45] to be here and we we never take it
[45:50] lightly when we step in front of the
[45:53] bright Jesus Christ and I just want to
[45:56] let you know I'm humbled to be in your
[45:57] presence to think that you're the
[45:59] redeemed purchased the reason why Jesus
[46:02] Christ went to Calvary was for you he
[46:05] paid the price for you and so I believe
[46:08] any minister of the gospel never takes
[46:10] it lightly that the words that we speak
[46:13] to the bride of Jesus Christ we we want
[46:15] those words to be his words so we want
[46:18] to yield our vessel to him and we're
[46:20] just thankful for that
[46:21] a man praise the Lord we bring you
[46:23] greetings from our Pastor David McGarry
[46:25] there and the Dallas Fort Worth area and
[46:28] many of the Saints they send their love
[46:30] and greetings to you see you make it
[46:33] down a man we're just good to be here
[46:36] each one of you if we'll turn in our
[46:37] Bibles to Luke chapter eight and maybe
[46:43] just as a place to launch from tonight
[46:45] we spoke a little last night on fear not
[46:48] only believe a man Luke chapter 8 verse
[46:55] 49 says while yet spake spake there
[47:00] cometh one from the ruler of the
[47:02] synagogue's house saying to him my
[47:05] daughter is dead trouble not the master
[47:07] but when Jesus heard it he answered him
[47:10] saying fear not believe only and she
[47:14] shall be made whole
[47:16] maybe let's just approach the Lord one
[47:18] more time Heavenly Father we've read
[47:19] your word we thank you for it now we
[47:21] surrender ourselves to you that you
[47:22] might have the preeminence Lord and
[47:24] speak words of life to your people we
[47:26] pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[47:28] you may be seated man we also read from
[47:32] a second Timothy 1:7 it says for God
[47:38] hath not given us the spirit of fear but
[47:41] of power and of love and of a sound mind
[47:45] and you know as I thought on those
[47:50] things for God hath not given us a
[47:52] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[47:56] and of sound mind it struck me as we
[48:02] read these scriptures jesus said fear
[48:04] not only believe and fear is something
[48:08] that has a lot of effect on the
[48:10] believers life whether we like that or
[48:12] not but many times we we fear or were
[48:15] afraid or we draw back when God has
[48:17] given us his word and we start to reason
[48:19] or we start to doubt and I'm reminded of
[48:22] of Peter on the water where when Jesus
[48:25] come and he said it is I be not afraid
[48:27] he said if it's you Lord bidden me to
[48:29] come you know and as long as he kept his
[48:32] eyes on Christ and as long as he was
[48:35] looking at him as long as he was looking
[48:38] at the word he started to walk and he
[48:40] started to walk on the water but as soon
[48:43] as he got his eyes off of Christ and he
[48:45] started to look at the situation's
[48:47] around him and he started to maybe
[48:49] reasoned like you know what man's not
[48:51] supposed to be able to walk on water and
[48:55] maybe we look at the promises of God say
[48:56] well maybe I'm not the one that could
[48:58] lay my hands on the dead and they raised
[49:00] her life well we start to look at the
[49:02] promises of God and then we start to
[49:04] reason within ourselves and look at our
[49:05] inabilities or our weaknesses and we
[49:07] think it's not for us and we shrink back
[49:09] and so what the word is going for
[49:11] tonight is fear not only belief all
[49:14] things are possible the Prophet said
[49:17] there's only two faculties that
[49:18] government governor human and one of
[49:21] them is faith which brings results and
[49:23] the other is fear which has no value in
[49:26] it at all faith is of God
[49:29] is of the devil fear makes you weary and
[49:31] fear makes you wonder and we we know
[49:36] that the way that the enemy works just
[49:38] like he attacked even the Garden of Eden
[49:41] he always wants to show his little lies
[49:44] of discrepancy he wants to show is
[49:46] little lies of deceit and that's always
[49:49] his way of doing it how he wants it in
[49:51] part fear and tear is it just little
[49:53] white lies he wants to cause doubt he
[49:55] wants you to doubt the Word of God and
[49:57] he wants you not to stand upon the
[49:59] promises and that he's given us but the
[50:01] scripture says he hasn't given you a
[50:03] spirit of fear but he's given you a
[50:05] spirit of power you know we are a people
[50:08] that we have a spirit of power and that
[50:10] is something that is available to you
[50:12] and we don't want to see the church on
[50:15] weak we don't want to see the church's
[50:16] going through day by day under a spirit
[50:19] of fear no power in their life and Oh
[50:21] victory life but God has given you a
[50:23] spirit of power he's giving you his life
[50:26] not just to sit there like a bump on the
[50:28] log but he wants you to manifest the
[50:30] very life that Jesus Christ manifested
[50:32] look this isn't some dead religion this
[50:35] isn't a dead gospel but he's the same
[50:37] yesterday today and forever and he said
[50:39] the works that I do the same works you
[50:42] shall do we want to embrace that we want
[50:45] to have a boldness and say Lord I'll be
[50:47] it unto me according to thy word but you
[50:53] know no text one came to giorious and
[51:00] told him you know don't trouble the
[51:01] master your daughter is already dead and
[51:04] you could imagine how his heart would
[51:06] have been failing him you know many
[51:09] times we get to that place and what
[51:11] we're gonna do it seems like all hope is
[51:14] gone and we just don't know what to do
[51:16] but that's what I love about the Word of
[51:18] God is if you can just stand upon the
[51:21] Word of God if faith can just rest right
[51:24] there there came a voice to giorious and
[51:27] Jesus said fear not oh please and that
[51:31] word is the same word for you tonight
[51:33] fear not only believe I know what you're
[51:36] going through I know that
[51:37] I know the heartache I know the hard
[51:39] decisions I know you got turned down
[51:41] from your job I know you lost your job
[51:44] so you can't pay the bills but okay
[51:46] there these trials and these frictions
[51:48] it's just for them I mean it's just
[51:49] temporary it's not worthy to be compared
[51:52] with the glory that he has in store for
[51:55] you so now with that in mind okay Lord
[51:59] this is your will for my eyes if this is
[52:02] the cross I have to bear the suffering I
[52:04] have to bear
[52:05] oh just stand upon his word cuz you know
[52:07] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[52:10] Oh hallelujah there's already one
[52:12] waiting for you hallelujah one of these
[52:15] days we're gonna step right out of here
[52:17] into eternity oh and all these trials
[52:20] and all the tribulations Oh there'll be
[52:23] a thing of the past
[52:24] for a moment Church fear not only
[52:27] believe hallelujah writing that crucial
[52:34] moment Jesus gave him the words that he
[52:37] needed to hear we know the Word of God
[52:39] is it's quick its oh it's sharper than
[52:42] any two-edged sword
[52:44] you know the words a discerner of the
[52:46] font in 10th of the heart and so if you
[52:51] have a need the word discerns what
[52:54] you're going through it knows where
[52:56] you're at in your life and if you have
[52:58] an open heart and you're willing to
[53:00] receive the word is coming for you
[53:03] it's coming for you it's looking for you
[53:06] looki you can't hide from it if you're a
[53:09] son or daughter of God it's gonna search
[53:11] you out it's gonna find you you can run
[53:14] from it all you want to run but you
[53:16] can't get away Jonah tried that one time
[53:19] he received a word from the Lord and he
[53:23] said you know what I'm not ready for it
[53:24] many times we feel like that we're not
[53:26] ready for it but you know what's gonna
[53:28] happen if you don't surrender your head
[53:29] to God oh you're gonna make a decision
[53:31] you're gonna start going the wrong way
[53:33] you're gonna be going to wet from the
[53:35] divine will that God had wanted you to
[53:38] do and you're gonna get up on there on
[53:41] life's oceans and then also those storms
[53:43] gonna come across
[53:44] and everything's gonna just start
[53:46] breaking up and what a Jonah do jonah
[53:48] knew it and you know so many times we
[53:52] get into places in a we just if we just
[53:55] humble ourselves you know sometimes
[53:57] that's the hardest reliever to do is
[53:59] humble themselves and just say you know
[54:01] what I'm wrong we got so much pride
[54:04] inside of us we think that was somebody
[54:08] you know people will sit in the church
[54:10] about demonic spirit because of their
[54:14] pride when they could just make a few
[54:16] steps up to the altar and be delivered
[54:19] of pornography to be delivered from lust
[54:22] I'll be delivered from alcohol I'll be
[54:24] delivered from all of these spirits that
[54:26] bind you but pride will hold you right
[54:30] there maybe everything in ups in your
[54:34] life will talk buttoned up you're
[54:36] looking pretty good but you know God's
[54:38] interested in all of your heart he wants
[54:41] all of you he didn't come for a part of
[54:43] you he wants all of it and he made a way
[54:47] for you he made a way for yours you have
[54:50] to accept it but so many times we don't
[54:53] want to humble ourselves oh we got too
[54:55] much pride and sadness we can't just
[54:57] walk up and say you know what I'm wrong
[55:00] Lord I need help you realize that's why
[55:03] he came he didn't come for people that
[55:06] didn't need help he came for people that
[55:08] needed help is there somebody here that
[55:11] needs help
[55:12] oh I know Jesus is coming tonight for
[55:15] you I'll praise the Lord hallelujah you
[55:24] know as I was thinking about that the
[55:26] word being sharper than any two-edged
[55:28] sword there's a story in the Bible about
[55:31] the king of Syria and he's making war
[55:36] with Israel and so he he he's making his
[55:40] little plans and preparations and and
[55:42] and you know Israel every time he SATs
[55:44] sets up his trap Israel goes the other
[55:46] way
[55:46] and the king of Syria starts to think
[55:48] you know what there's a rat amongst us
[55:51] somebody is going and sneaking off over
[55:55] to Israel and telling them and tipping
[55:56] them off of our every
[55:57] move you know one of the servants there
[56:00] was like hold wait a second no you got
[56:03] it all wrong King you realize there's a
[56:06] profit over there and he knows the very
[56:09] words that you're spinning your bedroom
[56:13] you know that God knows every thought
[56:16] that you're thinking but see Satan tries
[56:19] to turn that right around and condemn
[56:20] you
[56:21] he puts the thought in your in your mind
[56:23] and then condemns you for it when the
[56:25] word goes forth or says God knows every
[56:27] thought that you're thinking of you're
[56:29] like oh my goodness I'm so ashamed I
[56:31] should have never done that you know
[56:33] he's the kind of guy that will talk to
[56:34] you robbing the bank and call the cops
[56:36] on you you know that's the devil he's
[56:38] the one that done it but see Jesus shed
[56:41] his blood that you could be set free
[56:43] from that you just claim the blood don't
[56:47] listen to his reasoning don't listen to
[56:48] his I also hear this king of Syria he
[56:51] this servant tells him that and look at
[56:54] the ignorance of this guy so he decides
[56:57] to set up a trap and go get him
[56:58] and say were you not hearing what I just
[57:00] told you he's gonna know they coming to
[57:05] get him but nonetheless the story goes
[57:07] and and and I believe it's the the army
[57:10] of Syria comes down Elijah standing
[57:13] there and a servant comes out and
[57:14] there's a host and kept against them and
[57:16] the servants like my goodness a master
[57:21] we're in trouble and the Prophet comes
[57:24] out looks around and this servants he's
[57:28] like what are we gonna I don't know what
[57:31] I'm gonna do I'm fearful it looks like
[57:34] they're gonna take her life Master what
[57:36] should we do and he's like don't fear
[57:38] you got nothing to fear about there's
[57:40] more with us then are against us and in
[57:44] his carnal mind here the servants
[57:46] looking at why I know this is a man of
[57:47] God but I can do math pretty good that's
[57:51] our problem any times we can do math
[57:52] pretty good we looked at the colonel we
[57:55] add it all up and we and we are we think
[57:59] that look if you're depending on your
[58:01] ability to pay your bills you're selling
[58:03] yourself short
[58:04] if you're depending on your abilities to
[58:07] pay your bills you're selling your self
[58:10] short because we have a father owns a
[58:12] cattle on a Thousand Hills and if you're
[58:14] depending on yourself you're gonna be
[58:16] disappointed all but when you start
[58:18] relying on him when you start putting
[58:20] your trust and your hope in him he's
[58:22] gonna take care of every need you had
[58:24] made up I never seen the righteous
[58:27] forsaken never seen them begging bread
[58:29] you just put all your faith and all of
[58:31] your trust in him and he's gonna take
[58:33] care of you
[58:34] it's just how many times we need we need
[58:37] some something supernatural to take
[58:39] place we need the Word of God to strike
[58:42] that predestinated seed on the inside
[58:44] you know that's supernatural that's only
[58:47] an ability that supernatural people
[58:50] possess is an ability for the word of
[58:53] God to strike a predestinated seat on
[58:56] the inside and what does it do it
[58:57] quickens it to life something happens
[59:01] power comes forth and it starts to grow
[59:04] and it starts to grow in the stature of
[59:06] a perfect man and that's that manifests
[59:08] the fruits of Jesus Christ oh my what a
[59:12] beautiful thing God has done for you
[59:14] that he placed that seat of God inside
[59:16] of you and he put everything that you
[59:18] ever had an eater on the inside of it
[59:20] and he sipped his word to reveal to you
[59:22] that you are a son of God that you are a
[59:25] daughter of God don't fear little flock
[59:27] it's my father's good pleasure to give
[59:29] you the kingdom you can't miss it
[59:32] don't want to have already paid the
[59:33] price it was finished on Calvary you
[59:36] won't fall short because I've made sure
[59:38] in myself that you can't lose you can't
[59:40] fall you can't not make it that's the
[59:43] kind of God we serve and hear this this
[59:46] servant standing there like man is not
[59:49] quite adding up to me not quite adding
[59:52] up to me it looks like there's a lot
[59:54] more here and what does the public say
[59:55] Lord open his eyes and I say if God
[1:00:01] could just open our eyes to the revealed
[1:00:03] word tonight Oh God give me a revelation
[1:00:07] this church is founded upon revelation
[1:00:10] and something we ought to pray for more
[1:00:13] than we've ever prayed for before is
[1:00:14] revelry
[1:00:15] we want prevailing revelation look we're
[1:00:19] in the end time it's not getting any
[1:00:20] easier it's only going to get harder and
[1:00:25] we want to take advantage of these
[1:00:26] opportunities we have now to be gathered
[1:00:29] together with our brothers and sisters
[1:00:30] of precious like faith as the scripture
[1:00:32] says gather yourselves together more
[1:00:34] often as you see that day approaching
[1:00:37] but it seems more than ever before the
[1:00:39] Satan's getting us all bound up with all
[1:00:41] of our responsibilities of work and
[1:00:43] school and family that we find no time
[1:00:46] for the house of God we find time for
[1:00:48] the things of God we find ourselves
[1:00:50] online and on the internet and paying
[1:00:52] attention to the news maybe not even a
[1:00:54] quarter of the time we spend in prayer
[1:00:55] and I can be ashamed myself and I say Oh
[1:00:57] God let me give you my life Lord let me
[1:01:00] find myself in the prayer closet let me
[1:01:03] find you in your presence all hallelujah
[1:01:05] the scripture says that he has blessed
[1:01:08] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:01:10] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's
[1:01:13] not just out anywhere come on that's in
[1:01:15] heavenly places the Prophet said that if
[1:01:18] I'm prayed up and that's you're prayed
[1:01:20] up oh we can be caught up in a heavenly
[1:01:22] atmosphere that's where we want to live
[1:01:24] as a believer in a heavenly atmosphere
[1:01:26] and in that place all things are
[1:01:28] possible to them believe oh praise the
[1:01:31] Lord hallelujah
[1:01:47] we just want God to open our eyes and
[1:01:50] give us more revelation prevailing
[1:01:53] revelation I love how you look at how
[1:01:57] God just and his perfection did it when
[1:02:01] when Jesus asked Peter who do you say
[1:02:03] that I am
[1:02:05] he said well some say you're this but he
[1:02:07] got down the hard no matter who do you
[1:02:09] say that I am he said how art the Christ
[1:02:15] the Son of the Living God and he said
[1:02:19] flesh and blood have not revealed that
[1:02:21] to you you realize that what he's saying
[1:02:24] is that all time you've spent with me
[1:02:27] because others have done it to think of
[1:02:31] a message or in the prophet in this day
[1:02:32] many men spent time with the messenger
[1:02:35] that they went hunting with them they
[1:02:38] sat in the meetings and they saw Jesus
[1:02:42] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:02:43] forever and he stood there night after
[1:02:46] night and said if Jesus Christ was here
[1:02:48] he would do the same things that he did
[1:02:50] and he said he said it over and over and
[1:02:55] over but just like them Jews there was a
[1:02:58] veil over the eyes they couldn't see it
[1:03:00] but all to that predestinated seed oh
[1:03:03] say old wall open my eyes are also
[1:03:05] available comes across and you see the
[1:03:08] Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:03:10] today forever revealed in the Ministry
[1:03:13] of a son of man what was it to do to
[1:03:15] come and catch your breath
[1:03:19] say it wasn't it wasn't flesh and blood
[1:03:23] that revealed it if you try to
[1:03:26] understand this message intellectually
[1:03:29] you won't be able to do it and I have
[1:03:31] found today more than ever
[1:03:33] men are trying to make sense of all the
[1:03:35] quotes look if you try to take the
[1:03:38] paradox out of the message you'll take
[1:03:40] the bride right out of it too because I
[1:03:42] want to tell you the brides are paradox
[1:03:45] you can't understand this miss grace you
[1:03:48] can't understand this Miss Jesus Christ
[1:03:50] and you won't understand it because a
[1:03:52] lot of these days a moment in a
[1:03:54] twinkling of an eye she'll be gone but
[1:03:58] when you try to explain it away if it's
[1:03:59] not my faith if you try to catch it with
[1:04:03] your mental conception and sometimes you
[1:04:08] know as believers there's things in the
[1:04:10] word we hear that are hard and we can't
[1:04:12] make sense of look but the word doesn't
[1:04:14] make any mistakes and so many times we
[1:04:17] hear the prophets say something over
[1:04:19] here and we hear him saying something
[1:04:21] over here and we think he made a mistake
[1:04:22] or he just didn't mean that no no we're
[1:04:25] just lacking revelation pray that the
[1:04:29] God would reveal it to you so many times
[1:04:36] we sell God short and and we and we
[1:04:41] allow our thinking to get him in the way
[1:04:43] of of the manifestation of Malachi 4
[1:04:46] that it was the voice of God to you some
[1:04:50] people take that on the other side and
[1:04:52] they try to make him God
[1:05:15] it's a personal relationship between you
[1:05:18] and Jesus Christ don't worry about what
[1:05:21] everybody else is saying don't worry
[1:05:24] about what everybody else was doing and
[1:05:25] he say Lord I hear a lot of stuff being
[1:05:28] said but just as you revealed to Peter
[1:05:32] who Jesus Christ is Lord reveal this
[1:05:36] message to me we get so dependent upon
[1:05:40] men's explanations and men's ideas that
[1:05:45] we run here and we run there and we
[1:05:47] wonder why we're tossed to and fro
[1:05:49] because we haven't gotten on our knees
[1:05:51] and we've ignored that the inheritance
[1:05:54] that has been given to the believer that
[1:05:55] you can get on your knees and if you
[1:05:58] have need of something you have not
[1:06:00] because you ask not and ask the Heavenly
[1:06:04] Father to reveal it to you and it's the
[1:06:06] same thing that happened to Peter that
[1:06:09] revelation will come to you and it won't
[1:06:11] be my flesh and blood look if it's my
[1:06:13] flesh and blood flesh and blood can take
[1:06:15] it away from you flesh and blood can
[1:06:18] talk you out this way and flesh and
[1:06:19] blood can talk you out that way but when
[1:06:21] you catch the revelation I'll bring all
[1:06:23] the flesh and blood in the world I don't
[1:06:25] scare me none
[1:06:26] why because I know who I am I know where
[1:06:29] it came from
[1:06:30] I'm all where I'm going and I fix my
[1:06:33] hope and all my trust in the revealed
[1:06:35] Word of God glory fear not only belief
[1:06:44] as I thought on this sphere just to
[1:06:48] maybe look at this a little bit while
[1:06:49] longer as I was thinking of that my my
[1:06:56] cousin she was shot in a school shooting
[1:07:00] she was was the first reported school
[1:07:02] shooting that had ever happened in the
[1:07:04] United States there was two killed a
[1:07:07] wounded thankful to the Lord my cousin
[1:07:09] wasn't killed but she was wounded the
[1:07:13] principal was killed the janitor was
[1:07:15] killed and eight other students at the
[1:07:18] Elementary School were were shot and I
[1:07:22] remember when we would we would go over
[1:07:24] to their house and years would have
[1:07:26] passed on from this but we wanted to be
[1:07:29] sensitive of slamming doors we wanted to
[1:07:32] be sensitive to loud noises because that
[1:07:34] is that event had impacted her so much
[1:07:38] in her life that if she would hear a
[1:07:41] loud bang or if she would hear a balloon
[1:07:43] pop or if she would hear a door slam it
[1:07:46] would actually strike fear into her and
[1:07:49] that she was no longer in control of the
[1:07:53] moment anymore she was no longer
[1:07:55] comfortable no matter where she was the
[1:07:58] whole atmosphere change and fear had
[1:08:00] taken over her heart and there's things
[1:08:03] that happen in our lives when were
[1:08:04] children and things that we go through
[1:08:06] when were growing up that that hang in
[1:08:10] there and we never even realized that
[1:08:12] the reason that we have about maybe
[1:08:14] mistrust or distrust or we're having a
[1:08:17] hard time receiving something from the
[1:08:19] word or we're having a hard time in our
[1:08:21] relationships it's because of things
[1:08:22] that you've gone through in the past and
[1:08:25] you know I've heard it may be said like
[1:08:29] this before some people feel like well
[1:08:31] you know just get over that you know
[1:08:34] gods already taking care of that just
[1:08:36] get over that but we never want to
[1:08:37] belittle the trials and all hardships
[1:08:41] that people go through in their life
[1:08:43] because these are deep wounds and deep
[1:08:45] scars and and by God's grace and the
[1:08:48] Holy Spirit he can deal with you and
[1:08:51] reveal to you in your heart if you've
[1:08:53] been going through something in your
[1:08:54] life and you've never been able to
[1:08:55] figure out why you just can't make it
[1:08:57] past this Lord why can I never seem to
[1:09:00] go all the way with you Lorna how come
[1:09:03] whenever I take you at your promised
[1:09:05] word I always seem to come up short Wow
[1:09:07] how come Lord I know I've never received
[1:09:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:09:11] what we want God to do is reveal to you
[1:09:14] the profits that you can have something
[1:09:17] in your life and unconfessed sin and a
[1:09:19] spirit will stay right there and it
[1:09:21] won't go anywhere you can bathe them in
[1:09:23] oil and pray over them and that devil
[1:09:25] will sit right there because he has a
[1:09:26] right to but it's the grace of God that
[1:09:29] will come to you and reveal to
[1:09:31] where you're lacking review - in your
[1:09:33] life where you're coming up short reveal
[1:09:35] to you where you've been hurt and the
[1:09:37] things that you have gone through in
[1:09:38] your past and you'll start to do
[1:09:40] something in you that's supernatural and
[1:09:42] that word will come forth to you and
[1:09:44] start to deliver you and start to heal
[1:09:46] you and start to take care of you why
[1:09:48] because that's the grace and mercy of
[1:09:51] Jesus Christ why so many people go
[1:09:53] through hardships they go through
[1:09:55] turmoil they lose loved ones and they
[1:09:57] die from cancer and sickness and news
[1:10:00] children in the war and car wrecks and
[1:10:02] they're shot on the street and babies
[1:10:05] die and all this pain and suffering that
[1:10:07] is in the world one would come to say
[1:10:09] like my grandma used to say all the time
[1:10:11] she says life is hard hard hard hard
[1:10:14] hard and I would say life is hard and
[1:10:18] and if we didn't have the hope of Jesus
[1:10:20] Christ oh my how miserable would we be
[1:10:23] and I've talked to people who have gone
[1:10:26] through some extremely hard trials and
[1:10:29] and I always ask them are you a
[1:10:31] Christian because I couldn't imagine
[1:10:34] going through that type of heartache
[1:10:37] going through those type of trials and
[1:10:39] not having Jesus Christ Oh am I not
[1:10:43] having Jesus Christ to be able to be
[1:10:45] your comfort I love the scripture it
[1:10:48] says if I go away
[1:10:49] I will send you the comforter well thank
[1:10:53] God for the comforter I've been in too
[1:10:56] many trials and I've been in a minute of
[1:10:58] hard places and I still thank God for
[1:11:00] the comforter that he would come to you
[1:11:02] and he can even be I easy sits closer
[1:11:05] than a brother when it seems like
[1:11:07] everybody's forsaken you and everybody
[1:11:09] that's close to you and everybody has
[1:11:12] turned their back on you all the Lord
[1:11:14] Jesus Christ he'll never turn his back
[1:11:16] on you the prophet of God said it's when
[1:11:19] you get discouraged that's when the
[1:11:21] devil can really pour it on you you
[1:11:24] watch that when you start getting
[1:11:26] discouraged and you feel like you're
[1:11:28] getting depressed that's when the devil
[1:11:29] are really poured on you and the Prophet
[1:11:32] knows what he's talking about the
[1:11:34] Prophet went through very very hard hard
[1:11:37] trials and one of them that sticks out
[1:11:40] most - especially all of us is where he
[1:11:43] had been working
[1:11:44] Arden and the floods had come in and
[1:11:47] he'd been out on the water and and his
[1:11:49] wife had gotten sick and and a hope she
[1:11:53] passed away and and and here she is in
[1:11:56] the morgue and he gets a call brother
[1:11:57] Brandon gets a call says now it's your
[1:11:59] baby baby girl and so brother Branham
[1:12:03] comes to the hospital and now he's
[1:12:04] holding his little Sharon Rose and he's
[1:12:07] looking at her and he describes and have
[1:12:09] a little fat on her leg is quivering
[1:12:10] back and forth and she's shaking from
[1:12:12] muscle spasms her and her eyes are
[1:12:14] crossed in her head and her life is
[1:12:16] going from her in the profits looking at
[1:12:18] this he said by my wife's laying over
[1:12:22] there and the mother and now my baby
[1:12:24] girl has been taken from me and it was
[1:12:27] in that moment that the devil started to
[1:12:29] pour it on and the Prophet said the
[1:12:31] devil couldn't come to him and tell him
[1:12:33] that God was a real come way too late
[1:12:36] for that he knew he was real but we said
[1:12:39] what the devil was able to tell him was
[1:12:42] that God didn't love him and he say you
[1:12:45] you standing here and preaching the
[1:12:47] gospel all these years and you're giving
[1:12:49] your life for this gospel and this is
[1:12:52] how God's gonna treat you and he started
[1:12:54] saying your brother died and your daddy
[1:12:56] died and and this has happened and
[1:12:59] that's happened and now your wife and
[1:13:01] now your baby girl and he makes a
[1:13:04] profound statement he says everything
[1:13:06] the devil was showed it was true and
[1:13:10] then he added that little seed of
[1:13:12] discrepancy there it said God really
[1:13:15] doesn't love you serious it was in that
[1:13:17] time of discouragement that the devil
[1:13:20] really starts to pour it on and you want
[1:13:23] to make sure you know where you're
[1:13:24] standing you want to make sure you know
[1:13:26] him who you have believed like Joe when
[1:13:29] he had lost everything and his whole
[1:13:31] family had been taken away from him and
[1:13:33] there his wife came into him said why
[1:13:35] don't you just curse God and die oh my
[1:13:37] job was going through the hardest trial
[1:13:39] in his life
[1:13:40] and they're in that trial and it seemed
[1:13:44] like all hope was gone and he seemed
[1:13:45] like maybe he would give up all the
[1:13:47] lightning was flashing and all sudden of
[1:13:50] a revelation shrunk oh my if I die
[1:13:53] although the skin worms eat my flesh yet
[1:13:56] in my flesh shall see God and we want to
[1:13:59] have that kind of revelation that we
[1:14:01] know that we know that we know that
[1:14:03] we've met Jesus Christ and we pass from
[1:14:05] death to eternal life then no matter
[1:14:07] what storms no matter what trials come
[1:14:10] our way we know we're safe and secure in
[1:14:12] the bosom of Jesus Christ praise the
[1:14:16] Lord it has to be a revelation your mind
[1:14:26] won't keep you your mind don't fail you
[1:14:29] I tell you what it's the grace of God I
[1:14:33] don't know about any of you but I've
[1:14:35] gotten to a place where my mind I feel
[1:14:36] like I'm going insane but all thank God
[1:14:39] there's an anchor thank god there's a
[1:14:42] deep inside they're calling to her deep
[1:14:44] thank god there's a sixth sense that
[1:14:47] when when the five senses of this flesh
[1:14:49] couldn't keep me there was something
[1:14:50] greater there was faith in God's Word
[1:14:52] there was grace - it made me make it
[1:14:55] through the trial oh the name of the
[1:15:00] Lord is a strong tower that the
[1:15:01] righteous run into it we're thankful for
[1:15:05] the blood if somebody here hasn't come
[1:15:09] to know the grace of Jesus Christ if you
[1:15:13] haven't applied the blood to your heart
[1:15:15] you know that little story there and in
[1:15:18] the Old Testament and the Exodus you're
[1:15:21] one of the plagues was that death angel
[1:15:22] coming and that death angel was going to
[1:15:26] pass you imagine being the firstborn in
[1:15:29] that home so Daddy is the blood applied
[1:15:34] daddy are you sure
[1:15:36] because if it's not I'm gonna die you
[1:15:41] know that's a real that should be a
[1:15:42] sobering message to each one of us that
[1:15:46] our days are numbered on this earth and
[1:15:48] if you haven't applied the blood that
[1:15:51] the death angels can't
[1:15:52] and we want to make sure that we've bled
[1:15:55] the blood of Jesus Christ and asked him
[1:15:57] to forgive us of our sins because if we
[1:15:59] don't do that and you haven't claimed
[1:16:01] that atoning power of the blood that day
[1:16:04] is coming and you don't want to be found
[1:16:06] that day without the blood the Prophet
[1:16:10] says why and why are people so tossed
[1:16:12] about the Christian faith is based
[1:16:15] solidly upon rest that's right a
[1:16:19] Christian is not tossed about a
[1:16:20] Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:16:22] place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume
[1:16:25] and worry about things a Christian rest
[1:16:29] it's all over it was all finished for
[1:16:33] the believer at Calvary oh thank God for
[1:16:36] Calvary my I just feel like I ain't here
[1:16:43] in Calvary preached too much in the
[1:16:44] churches but there at Calvary I'm
[1:16:49] thankful for Calvary well it was there
[1:16:52] that my sins were forgiven it was there
[1:16:54] that he took all of my sin and shame
[1:16:56] upon his back was that Calvary well
[1:16:59] thank God for Calvary just as John said
[1:17:03] and of Moses as Moses lifted up the
[1:17:06] serpent in the wilderness even so must
[1:17:08] the Son of Man be lifted up that
[1:17:10] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:17:12] perish but have everlasting life all
[1:17:15] sickness may come to you my
[1:17:17] disappointments may come to you hard
[1:17:19] trials might come to you all but faith
[1:17:22] keeps you faith and what God has done in
[1:17:25] faith in the spoken word and faith in
[1:17:27] Calvary
[1:17:28] oh my it'll take care of you just stay
[1:17:30] right there and stand upon the word and
[1:17:32] fear not only believe all just let us
[1:17:36] hold fast to the profession of our faith
[1:17:37] without wavering for he that promised is
[1:17:41] faithful one thing I like about faith is
[1:17:43] it puts you into action
[1:17:45] faith puts you into action Abraham the
[1:17:48] father of our faith I believe it's in
[1:17:50] Genesis chapter 12 he finds them in and
[1:17:52] God just speaks to Abraham it says
[1:17:55] Abraham depart from here you don't see
[1:17:57] them fussing and fighting and trying to
[1:18:00] to figure it all out but know that
[1:18:03] of God came to that predestinated see
[1:18:05] him and put him in action
[1:18:06] I say Oh God put me in action but let us
[1:18:13] hold fast to the profession of our faith
[1:18:15] without wavering well what do we have to
[1:18:19] fear search what shall separate us from
[1:18:22] the love of God can't can't can't can
[1:18:26] your job can your friends can your
[1:18:30] sickness nothing can separate you from
[1:18:33] the love of God Roma says for I am
[1:18:36] persuaded are you persuaded tonight and
[1:18:40] there's somebody that's persuaded in the
[1:18:42] grace of God hallelujah I am persuaded
[1:18:45] that neither death nor life nor Angels
[1:18:47] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:18:49] present nor things to come nor height
[1:18:51] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:18:54] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:18:55] God which is in Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:18:58] were at rest Church the anchor holds
[1:19:02] that's faith final resting places the
[1:19:04] Word of God hallelujah well the Prophet
[1:19:07] said he prepared you before the
[1:19:09] foundation of the world to receive him
[1:19:11] in this age he prepared you before the
[1:19:16] foundation of the world to receive him
[1:19:18] in this last age we talked last night
[1:19:20] about Jesus Christ coming to the grave
[1:19:22] of Lazarus and say Lazarus come forth
[1:19:26] you realize when this message came when
[1:19:29] Malachi 4:5 came and Luke 17:30 come in
[1:19:33] this last day and as that word went
[1:19:36] forth God had already prepared you just
[1:19:39] as that word came forth from jesus to
[1:19:42] lazarus to come forth he didn't ask him
[1:19:45] he didn't say oh when would you like to
[1:19:49] well know that word of God went forth
[1:19:51] and call for that son of God to come
[1:19:54] forth and just like you God had prepared
[1:19:57] your heart before the foundation of the
[1:19:59] world that when that message came and he
[1:20:02] said come out of her my people something
[1:20:04] as sorry you just was drawn to it and
[1:20:07] all of a sudden you were quickened alive
[1:20:09] life started putting one foot in front
[1:20:11] of the other and he started to come out
[1:20:13] of all the denominational systems he
[1:20:15] started to come out of all that darkness
[1:20:16] and all that gloom and into the
[1:20:18] marvelous light of the gospel why
[1:20:20] because God had prepared you before the
[1:20:22] foundation of the world with that
[1:20:24] ability to respond to the Word of God
[1:20:28] Amen let's turn in our Bibles to 2nd
[1:20:30] Kings chapter 5 2nd Kings chapter 5
[1:20:54] verse 9 says so naman came with his
[1:20:59] horses and with his chariots and stood
[1:21:01] at the door of the house of Elijah
[1:21:02] Elisha sent messengers unto him saying
[1:21:05] go and wash in the Jordan seven times
[1:21:07] and thy flesh shall come again to thee
[1:21:10] and thou shalt be clean but naman was
[1:21:12] wroth and went away and said behold I
[1:21:14] thought he will surely come out to me
[1:21:16] and stand and call in the name of the
[1:21:18] Lord his God and strike his hands over
[1:21:20] the place and recover the leper or not
[1:21:22] Gabanna and and far part rivers of
[1:21:25] Damascus better than all the waters of
[1:21:27] Israel may I not washing them and be
[1:21:29] clean so he turned away and went in a
[1:21:31] rage and his servant came near unto NIR
[1:21:35] and spake on him and said my father if
[1:21:36] the prophet had bid thee do some great
[1:21:38] thing wouldest thou not have done it
[1:21:41] how much rather then when he saith unto
[1:21:43] the wash and be clean then went down and
[1:21:47] dipped himself seven times in the Jordan
[1:21:50] according to the saying of the man of
[1:21:51] God and his flesh came again like under
[1:21:54] the flesh of a little child and was
[1:21:57] clean and I just want to say that God
[1:21:59] has a provided way for the believer and
[1:22:01] his way is his word and the Prophet said
[1:22:05] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:22:07] promise of God will bring it to pass and
[1:22:09] as believers we must have the right
[1:22:12] approach to the Word of God and if you
[1:22:15] look at the word here what stuck out to
[1:22:17] me here is naimans response in verse 11
[1:22:21] it says but name and was
[1:22:22] laughs I went away and said said behold
[1:22:26] I thought that's where we get ourselves
[1:22:28] in all the trouble right there is I
[1:22:30] thought there is the trouble neighbor
[1:22:34] was mad because it didn't happen the way
[1:22:36] he wanted to you know it's sad as mature
[1:22:40] Christians that we can find ourselves in
[1:22:42] the same place as naman oh we pray and
[1:22:45] we ask God to do certain things and when
[1:22:47] it doesn't happen the way we thought it
[1:22:48] should we pout about it but uh God's
[1:22:53] God's not sitting up there and it's just
[1:22:55] wondering oh my goodness I wonder how
[1:22:57] I'm gonna make everything work out today
[1:22:58] we're the ones that get fearful were the
[1:23:01] ones that are troubled were the ones
[1:23:02] that are worrying he has it all under
[1:23:04] control i if you have done your part and
[1:23:07] you've prayed and you've laid it before
[1:23:09] the Lord and you've done all you I know
[1:23:10] to do rest that's thank God that's in a
[1:23:14] bad that's a promise to the believer
[1:23:15] just rest
[1:23:17] look I'll tell you an amazing thing in
[1:23:19] the adoption series when brother Branham
[1:23:21] preaches he preaches adoption and and in
[1:23:24] the very beginning of the message he
[1:23:26] tells the story before he even starts he
[1:23:27] tells the story about going beyond the
[1:23:29] curtain of time I thought how wonderful
[1:23:32] here he's gonna he's taking us into
[1:23:35] adoption but before he even ever gets
[1:23:36] into it he starts to describe out that
[1:23:38] place that we're going is real and how
[1:23:41] he went over there and and he saw the
[1:23:44] loved ones in me and what what comfort
[1:23:46] that gave to that brokenhearted prophet
[1:23:48] to be able to go across the curtain of
[1:23:52] time over there and then what's amazing
[1:23:54] is at the very end of the first sermon
[1:23:58] there there's a sister that comes up for
[1:24:00] prayer and actually I believe she's the
[1:24:04] last one of brother Brent says well it
[1:24:05] looks like you're the last one and it's
[1:24:08] really neat there at the very back he
[1:24:09] goes now just for a little teaching the
[1:24:12] crowds maybe have dwindled down and he
[1:24:14] starts to tell this sister because she's
[1:24:17] up there she's praying for her sons and
[1:24:19] her daughters and she's recognized and
[1:24:22] she's believing the Word of God but her
[1:24:24] her her babies are out there in the
[1:24:26] world and she's coming up there and you
[1:24:27] could hear her crying because she's
[1:24:29] she's wanting her children to catch the
[1:24:32] Word of God I want
[1:24:33] ever and brother Brandon goes all just
[1:24:35] for a little teaching sister you ever
[1:24:38] heard about the story of the jailer Paul
[1:24:40] and Silas were in jail he had he knows
[1:24:43] and and you know that the the jail
[1:24:46] started his shaking their chains were
[1:24:48] loosed and the jailer was about to kill
[1:24:49] himself he's like yeah he's like and he
[1:24:53] said fear not don't take my life we're
[1:24:57] all here and they led him to Jesus
[1:24:59] Christ what did he tell them he said he
[1:25:02] said if you believe upon Jesus Christ
[1:25:04] you and your house shall be saved and
[1:25:06] the prophet of God said if you have
[1:25:08] enough faith for salvation
[1:25:10] you got enough faith for your house look
[1:25:12] if you've been praying and you've been
[1:25:14] believing for your loved ones I just
[1:25:16] want to tell you tonight just rest oh
[1:25:18] that's the promise that God gave you
[1:25:20] just rest you put it all in his hands
[1:25:23] and just rest
[1:25:24] all the father has given me will come o
[1:25:29] children of God you can rest tonight
[1:25:32] because of what God has done for you he
[1:25:34] has it only control but it's our
[1:25:39] thinking that gets ourselves in trouble
[1:25:42] and naming it was mad because it didn't
[1:25:45] happen the way he wanted to talk the
[1:25:48] Prophet said that's the reason people
[1:25:49] miss it they want to get it the way they
[1:25:52] you want to get it they they want to get
[1:25:55] the Holy Ghost the way they want to get
[1:25:56] it they want the revelation to be
[1:25:59] according to their thinking the way that
[1:26:01] I thought it was going to be you know
[1:26:05] people say they have the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:07] you see in their lives they're not
[1:26:09] saying Amen to every word of God
[1:26:11] you know the pastor preaches against
[1:26:14] address and and preachers holiness and
[1:26:16] they keep doing it any kind of way they
[1:26:18] want to the word shows that we shouldn't
[1:26:20] cut her hair or clip her hair look uncut
[1:26:22] hairs it's it's that's what long hair is
[1:26:25] is uncut hair and I'll never forget my I
[1:26:29] was just amazed and I tell you what I
[1:26:31] was really amazed by God's grace he kept
[1:26:35] me contained but I was sitting there and
[1:26:38] a sister was trying to justify the
[1:26:39] clipping of her hair and she said well
[1:26:42] you know the way I said it's just like
[1:26:43] take take a bunch of girls and line them
[1:26:46] up and have them altar
[1:26:47] backwards and you can tell he has long
[1:26:48] hair and on and I had a I had a bone to
[1:26:52] pick with that I say you want to tell me
[1:26:53] that my Blessed African sister who can't
[1:26:56] grow hair passed here you're gonna try
[1:26:57] to tell me your hair's longer than hers
[1:26:59] I said no if she's never put scissor to
[1:27:02] it or she's caught the revelation and
[1:27:04] has honored that revelation her hands
[1:27:06] long in God's eyes but so many times we
[1:27:09] want to interpret the Word of God with
[1:27:11] our denominational ways of thinking to
[1:27:14] appease our own beliefs but we gotta
[1:27:16] have a revelation we want the word the
[1:27:19] way God gave it not the way we think it
[1:27:23] should happen no but if we have the Holy
[1:27:32] Spirit working in our lives we say amen
[1:27:35] to every single word of God the Prophet
[1:27:38] said God when he comes into a person or
[1:27:42] two persons into a congregation into a
[1:27:44] man or woman he vindicates his presence
[1:27:48] Oh hallelujah
[1:27:51] I said O God vindicate your presence
[1:27:53] here tonight
[1:27:55] God vindicate your presence to this
[1:27:58] people God proves that he's there for
[1:28:02] when God comes supernatural signs begin
[1:28:04] to appear this person becomes a changed
[1:28:07] person they're not no more like they
[1:28:09] used to be seen as vanished from their
[1:28:10] life fear and doubt have vanished and
[1:28:13] frustration they are solid stable live
[1:28:18] or die it's Christ they don't care what
[1:28:21] comes or what goes nothing shakes them
[1:28:24] they move forward
[1:28:26] Oh God by your grace tonight I want to
[1:28:29] move forward I let me go on with God
[1:28:32] away from my own thoughts away from my
[1:28:34] own thinking the promise that works is
[1:28:37] faith expressed you know as we're
[1:28:41] dealing with this place here in
[1:28:43] scripture about naming you know leprosy
[1:28:45] is a type of sin don't tell me you got
[1:28:48] the cure of sin and I can see it all
[1:28:50] over your face and all over the way
[1:28:51] you're dressing the way you're talking
[1:28:52] the way you're carrying on no but if
[1:28:57] you're having the Spirit of God working
[1:28:59] in your life you move
[1:29:00] word you don't make excuses for the sin
[1:29:03] and unbelief in your life but you you
[1:29:05] you take God at His Word you say Lord if
[1:29:07] you said it I believe it I can't make
[1:29:09] sense of it but being unto me or Jesus
[1:29:12] and then you start to see that faith
[1:29:16] working in your life look at Abraham's
[1:29:18] faith it was accounted to him unto
[1:29:20] righteousness because God looked at his
[1:29:23] heart and he counted unto my
[1:29:24] righteousness because he believed in
[1:29:26] something that had not happened yet but
[1:29:29] when James picks it up says you're
[1:29:30] justified by faith he's talking about
[1:29:32] that that word having an effect in your
[1:29:35] life and seeing the results of it is
[1:29:39] that right and in verse 11 here I just
[1:29:46] want to pick this up here in a second
[1:29:48] but namings response to the word if your
[1:29:52] response to the word is is crucial that
[1:29:56] can be term in the outcome it's how you
[1:29:59] respond to the Word of God you know the
[1:30:02] preacher says this and he says that even
[1:30:04] even in a service like this the preacher
[1:30:06] could preach about the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:08] then all of a sudden the devil goes to
[1:30:09] start to working in your mind go over
[1:30:11] there the guy said I don't have the Holy
[1:30:12] Ghost if you're having those type of
[1:30:15] thoughts I want to challenge you to what
[1:30:18] you really have because if you have the
[1:30:20] Holy Ghost when the word goes forward
[1:30:22] you say Lord if there's something in my
[1:30:23] life lacking be it unto me according to
[1:30:26] thy word oh but when the word goes forth
[1:30:28] and all of a sudden you're getting mad
[1:30:30] at the preacher or you're getting mad at
[1:30:32] the word or you said I just don't quite
[1:30:34] see it like that and all of a sudden you
[1:30:36] see bitterness and you see you you
[1:30:40] pushing back and not receiving the word
[1:30:42] you want to check up on your life and
[1:30:44] start to wonder what kind of spirit is
[1:30:45] upon you because the Spirit of the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost says yeah and amen to every word
[1:30:49] of God I often say if the shoe fits wear
[1:30:53] it you know if it sounds like the the
[1:30:56] preachers preaching your exact situation
[1:30:59] if the shoe fits wear it
[1:31:02] look I grew up in a pastor's home and
[1:31:04] yep sometimes the pastor might get
[1:31:06] inspiration about things that happen in
[1:31:08] the family but you know what if your
[1:31:10] heart is right then don't worry about it
[1:31:13] but if the shoe fits wear it if you
[1:31:15] think the pastor's talking to you and
[1:31:16] he's like man he's telling my exact
[1:31:18] situation I can't believe he would do
[1:31:19] that if it's the truth believe it but I
[1:31:22] just want to be right I don't want to be
[1:31:25] wrong you know if if the word keeps
[1:31:32] going forth and the part of its for you
[1:31:34] and then the rest keeps going on you
[1:31:36] like well you know I'm not struggling
[1:31:37] with that well praise God but just
[1:31:40] accept the part that's for you but we
[1:31:41] always want to push it out on somebody
[1:31:42] else but look at this here in verse 11
[1:31:46] they struck me what is your response to
[1:31:51] the word we must only believe in verse
[1:31:54] 11 it says but naman was rough and went
[1:31:58] away and said behold I thought he will
[1:32:02] surely come out to me and stand and call
[1:32:05] in the name of his god and strike his
[1:32:07] hand over the place and recovers the
[1:32:09] leper I kind of thought it was
[1:32:12] interesting he spoke to of himself in
[1:32:14] the third person he says and strike his
[1:32:19] hand over place and he didn't say me but
[1:32:20] it struck me you know what we have to do
[1:32:23] is we have to see ourselves in the word
[1:32:25] we have to see ourselves as part of the
[1:32:28] equation just like when that lady come
[1:32:31] to Jesus and she kept begging unto him
[1:32:34] he said look it's not meat to give you
[1:32:37] the children's bread under dogs but you
[1:32:39] know what's so amazing about faith faith
[1:32:41] Sola portion in the word for herself and
[1:32:45] faith agreed with the word faith in us I
[1:32:49] can't believe you would say something
[1:32:51] about me like that my I'm a
[1:32:52] predestinated seen of God and I believe
[1:32:55] God sent a prophet and how dare you talk
[1:32:57] to me like that I'm entitled to this
[1:33:00] don't don't tell me I'm Moroccan my
[1:33:03] goodness gracious don't you realize I
[1:33:05] was in brother branham's meetings don't
[1:33:07] you realize I went hunting with and
[1:33:09] don't you realize my mommy and daddy was
[1:33:11] in the meetings well I got one of his
[1:33:12] prayer cloth do you realize that you're
[1:33:14] talking to preacher Oh watch it now my
[1:33:20] but no what did that true seed of God do
[1:33:23] when
[1:33:25] word came forth that seed of God said
[1:33:27] truth Lord whatever you say is true and
[1:33:32] if I'm a dog let me be a dog at your
[1:33:35] table hood oh I don't care how I did in
[1:33:38] the kingdom of God just let me in Lord
[1:33:41] Jesus I'm gonna call on your name the
[1:33:43] Bible says if you call on the name you
[1:33:45] shall be saved
[1:33:46] Lord Jesus I don't have to be the
[1:33:48] greatest Lord let me be the least I just
[1:33:50] want to be their Lord let me just have a
[1:33:52] crumb for your table oh you got to see
[1:33:55] yourself in the Word of God truth Lord
[1:34:02] even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall
[1:34:05] from the master's table faith always
[1:34:07] agrees with the word Lord I'll take
[1:34:11] whatever you'll give me maybe tonight
[1:34:15] somebody needs to say Lord I'll take
[1:34:17] whatever you give me
[1:34:18] you know he's willing to give you

[1:45:45] care of me I'm afraid of what my
[1:45:48] neighbor might say cuz he might slash my

[1:45:53] register will say because I don't want
[1:45:55] to be embarrassed oh my it's true this
[1:46:01] is the gospel
[1:46:03] look we say that were we when the last
[1:46:06] one comes in we're gonna go in a rapture
[1:46:08] nobody's nobody's concerned about it
[1:46:11] yeah when the last one comes in but I
[1:46:13] ain't gonna do none to help you know I
[1:46:17] can't wait to go to the rapture when
[1:46:18] somebody finds that last one I'll be
[1:46:19] thankful
[1:46:20] hey brother Isaiah thanks for getting
[1:46:21] that last one may not be waiting on you
[1:46:23] a long time that's not the love of God
[1:46:25] the love of God should be compelled in
[1:46:28] you the scripture says when the love is
[1:46:30] shed abroad in your heart one to another
[1:46:32] but that doesn't just mean the household
[1:46:34] of faith why don't you get up there and
[1:46:36] show somebody that Jesus Christ is the
[1:46:38] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:46:40] look up on somebody's need and telling
[1:46:42] you know what oh my tell you what I
[1:46:44] don't like people smoking around me it
[1:46:47] kind of gets on my nerves but you know
[1:46:49] what I thought I got a really good
[1:46:51] tactic if somebody's smoking around you
[1:46:55] just go tell them that they could be
[1:46:57] delivered and nine times out of ten they
[1:47:00] won't smoke around you it's a good
[1:47:03] solution but that person knows they're
[1:47:07] in bondage they know they don't want to
[1:47:08] do that and so you never know they might
[1:47:11] be going through a trial they might have
[1:47:13] tried so many times you talk to most
[1:47:15] smokers they'll tell you man I've thrown
[1:47:17] down this thing twenty thirty times and
[1:47:20] you come over there and tell him you
[1:47:21] know there's such things arisen sader
[1:47:23] name Jesus Christ who all power and
[1:47:25] authority was given to you and he laid
[1:47:27] his life down at Calvary and not only
[1:47:29] did he have power to lay his life down
[1:47:30] but he had power to take it up again did
[1:47:33] you know he sit that spirit back upon
[1:47:35] man that if you'll just repent of your
[1:47:36] sins and you're baptized the name of the
[1:47:38] Holy Ghost you'll get power over that
[1:47:40] demon and you'll be delivered and you'll
[1:47:42] become one of them oh that's the gospel
[1:47:46] hallelujah that's the gospel
[1:47:49] that's preaching Jesus that's preaching
[1:47:53] Jesus that's living Jesus hey man just
[1:47:58] working towards the close here or we all
[1:48:00] right should we keep going
[1:48:03] praise the Lord have that that attitude
[1:48:09] of faith I'll take I'll take whatever
[1:48:10] you'll give me Lord I'll take whatever
[1:48:13] you'll give me tonight if we can have
[1:48:15] that type of a heavenly atmosphere and
[1:48:17] that type of expectation
[1:48:19] tonight Lord I'll take whatever you
[1:48:21] you'll give me
[1:48:22] oh just make make your heart right put
[1:48:25] all the sins under the blood to be an
[1:48:27] expectation for the power of the Holy
[1:48:29] Ghost to sweep through here and start
[1:48:30] believing upon the Lord everybody in one
[1:48:33] mind and one Accord moving into a
[1:48:34] heavenly atmosphere believing for people
[1:48:37] to be born again in the power of the
[1:48:38] Holy Ghost to come and in that type of
[1:48:40] expectation those are in
[1:48:42] the times are not heavenly atmosphere
[1:48:43] when things break when things start to
[1:48:45] move we're looking for it Lord Jesus
[1:48:48] granite but Satan wants to bind the
[1:48:53] people with fessor you men of Judea are
[1:48:56] you men of Des Moines Iowa you that

[1:49:21] we've the ministry in many places have
[1:49:23] preached so hard against speaking in
[1:49:25] tongues being the evidence of the Holy
[1:49:26] Ghost that people are afraid to speak in
[1:49:28] tongues we fight something so hard one
[1:49:30] way that we scare the people from her
[1:49:32] from doing everything the other way we
[1:49:34] preach Urza preach so hard against
[1:49:36] Pentecost its preached so hard against
[1:49:39] speaking in tongues as the evidence all

[1:50:10] living to me to tell hallelujah Laurie

[1:50:23] fear what man shall do under me we just
[1:50:27] need some victory in her life that's

[2:32:28] Hey
[2:32:34] you know what we cannot allow ourselves
[2:32:37] to believe that we received the Holy
[2:32:41] Ghost in a Pentecostal way and when I
[2:32:45] say that I'm talking about denominations
[2:32:47] right if you remember the story that
[2:32:51] brother Branham read told he told about
[2:32:53] this man who had went from pillar to
[2:32:55] post seeing whether or not he had and
[2:32:59] brother Ellen said you got it when you
[2:33:01] read that track and you turned around
[2:33:04] from where you were how do you know you
[2:33:08] got the Holy Ghost is this okay brother
[2:33:10] cuz you turn from where you used to be
[2:33:15] to where you are now
[2:33:18] right and that Holy Ghost comes in you
[2:33:21] to mature you yes you gonna fall like a
[2:33:25] baby sometime you gonna stumble like a
[2:33:27] toddler hallelujah but down the road
[2:33:32] you'll learn how to walk upright just
[2:33:35] let the life of God and you bring you to
[2:33:38] that place you can't rush God you know
[2:33:42] what I'm saying I wanted to be 6-3 6-4
[2:33:44] it ain't happening because it ain't the
[2:33:50] will of the Lord but I'm satisfied with
[2:33:52] what I have and God can feel this bottle
[2:33:56] just like he can feel the baby's bottle
[2:33:58] hey man god knows what he's doing half
[2:34:02] how much help trust have faith in God
[2:34:06] have faith in God it
[2:34:09] no man can add a cubit to his statue God
[2:34:12] don't tease people and say hey here's
[2:34:14] the Holy Ghost here's the Holy Ghost
[2:34:17] he never teased he hands it out there is
[2:34:21] that right brother Ellen said God wants
[2:34:23] to give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[2:34:25] want it hallelujah and then let me say
[2:34:28] it like this how many times you've had
[2:34:31] your keys in your hands and you're

[2:34:34] where my key where are my keys and
[2:34:36] everybody start laughing and saying you
[2:34:38] got them in your hand see that's how it
[2:34:40] is right that's how it is the Holy Ghost
[2:34:43] sometimes you got it you looking for it
[2:34:46] and you got it already you got it you
[2:34:48] need to water it I tell people and I
[2:34:51] don't mean no harm you know I can't

[2:40:29] know the devil is gonna fight you right
[2:40:30] after this meeting he's there he may
[2:40:35] even come to you before you get out the
[2:40:37] building right because she said oh my
[2:40:41] god don't hit garden you know I'm prayed
[2:40:43] and I'm praying I don't pray but you let
[2:40:45] me tell you something what really
[2:40:46] encourages me and I'm gonna shut my
[2:40:47] mouth
[2:40:48] at least try anyway but the thing that
[2:40:52] really encourages me is will not think
[2:40:54] about the Saints of old you know I don't
[2:40:58] know nobody who's been boiled in oil I
[2:41:01] don't know anybody who's been tied to a
[2:41:04] rotisserie and roasted over the fire
[2:41:06] because the people are trying to get
[2:41:09] them to denounce Jesus I don't know
[2:41:12] anybody who's whose mothers and had
[2:41:14] babies within themselves and the men
[2:41:17] would cut them open and rip their babies
[2:41:19] out because they wouldn't did not Jesus
[2:41:21] come on my trials are bad but they're
[2:41:24] not like they're not that bad you said
[2:41:27] I'm saying I don't have a worthy cause
[2:41:30] to denounce Jesus my trials may be hard
[2:41:34] my tests are hard sometimes you feel
[2:41:37] alone but the Bible said you're never
[2:41:39] alone now who you're going to breathe
[2:41:41] the devil's die
[2:41:43] or what God said he said I'll never
[2:41:45] leave it nor will I forsake you ain't no
[2:41:50] way I have been that I am determined the
[2:41:54] devil will never steal my joy
[2:41:56] [Music]
[2:41:58] if I gotta look like a clown to
[2:42:00] everybody else
[2:42:01] I am determined to not let the devil oh
[2:42:05] you saw her brother was are you gonna
[2:42:06] get have your moments just a moment
[2:42:09] it'll be just a moment right not a
[2:42:12] season a moment because I spring back
[2:42:18] all I need is one word from the Lord one
[2:42:21] thought of his word to know that God is
[2:42:24] never leaving nor he wears it and I've
[2:42:26] been ordained for this battle y'all know
[2:42:28] what I'm saying let me say it like this
[2:42:30] when you are deign for the battle you
[2:42:32] like David you're like David you got
[2:42:36] everything you need to conquer Goliath
[2:42:39] and like the brother said cast away the
[2:42:41] fear and go after the giant you love the
[2:42:45] Lord I don't mean the priest but I
[2:42:47] surely enjoyed the Word of God I enjoyed
[2:42:51] every bit of it
[2:42:52] I appreciate the Lord Jesus I appreciate
[2:42:54] our brother Matthew for open his heart
[2:42:57] to us and letting the law to use him in
[2:43:00] the way he did his heart some time to
[2:43:04] get up here after a preacher and I hope
[2:43:06] I didn't enter into his message for
[2:43:08] tomorrow but that's okay we served the
[2:43:12] same God and I know the Lord will bless
[2:43:14] y'all come believing that God is going
[2:43:16] to reward you look for God not brother
[2:43:20] Matthew Luke beyond that veil hear what
[2:43:23] the voice of the Lord is saying to you
[2:43:25] believe it's not just a man see that's
[2:43:28] what happened with brother everybody
[2:43:29] thought it was just a man but believe
[2:43:31] it's God moving behind that veil and
[2:43:35] preaching and giving you the Word of God
[2:43:40] when uh when God pray I said that right
[2:43:44] brother I'm said when a man pray and he
[2:43:46] prays in the name of Jesus Christ he
[2:43:48] said there's no longer that man that's
[2:43:51] Jesus Christ praying so when I preach is
[2:43:54] telling you something and encouraging
[2:43:56] you and and ending it up in the name of
[2:43:58] Jesus Christ that's Jesus not brother
[2:44:03] Brooks not brother Matthew
[2:44:05] Brett Jesus if you can take it as Jesus
[2:44:08] and not as a man you'll come out
[2:44:10] conquered conquering a devil
[2:44:12] every time father God we thank you for
[2:44:16] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[2:44:19] Lord we appreciate you everything you
[2:44:24] have done for us Lord we know that you
[2:44:29] wanted us to have these meetings and
[2:44:32] Satan has fought in every
[2:44:36] but lord I know when you ordained
[2:44:38] something something to do or something
[2:44:41] to happen no matter what Satan tries to
[2:44:44] do the purpose will be accomplished and
[2:44:48] father I don't know what all the young
[2:44:50] people need and the elders we all stand
[2:44:53] in need Lord and we just pray tonight
[2:44:56] that they will see that this is not just
[2:45:00] another meeting but you ordain these
[2:45:05] meetings you pressed upon my heart to
[2:45:08] have these meetings and Lord we have
[2:45:13] learned through the prophet of God that
[2:45:16] you keep all of your appointments and
[2:45:20] not one person should leave out of this
[2:45:23] meeting without receiving what they
[2:45:29] asked for because even in your word you
[2:45:33] say where two or three are gathered in
[2:45:35] my name there you are in the midst and
[2:45:39] Lord you've been in our mist you are in
[2:45:41] our mist
[2:45:42] we pray father god bless each and every
[2:45:45] heart tonight even as we depart and go
[2:45:48] to our different destinies
[2:45:50] let us continue to be united with
[2:45:53] and as we pray we want to pray father
[2:45:56] God for the food that has been prepared
[2:45:59] we pray that you bless the food sanctify
[2:46:03] to the nursing or bodies longing in
[2:46:05] Jesus Christ's name we pray
