blue ain't touching [Music] be the same [Music] amen he is him oh the holy I will best your name again [Music] you you can't touch be the same amen foreign [Music] foreign foreign pond with our house which is from heaven is foreign earnestly upon with our house tears from heaven the unfold but clothed upon that mortality might be up of life the universities also have given unto us our history is therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from us by faith not by side foreign [Music] foreign yes thank you we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you may be seated by the grace of God I like to speak uh mainly on the resurrection Resurrection Hallelujah and if I was to have a sub-topic I would it would be changing from glory to glory I'm not sure that most people really understand this age that we're living in but to me this is the greatest of all ages since time began and just to think chose Hallelujah to use to put the devil under his feet when I think about the approaching time and the approaching event that we're getting ready to pop be partakers of I realize but there are two resurrections there's a resurrection for the good and there's a resurrection for the evil but I trust that you and I will be part of the first resurrection hallelujah amen now we know according to Paul that this body that we're now living in it's not the final body of of who we are we realize by the grace of God that we have what we call a theophany it is a word body hallelujah amen so when Paul was speaking about this Earthly Tabernacle being dissolved he was talking about how death strikes this body all of us know the longer you live the worst this body becomes that's the scripture says the grass with us the grass withers and the flowers fade away Hallelujah but the word of the Lord shall stand so we're living in a time where God is going to take these bodies change them Hallelujah into a position where we can take on positions not the off anybody and then the body will take on the glorified body but mind you this is not for everybody this is for our chosen people this is for a chosen generation Hallelujah there's only a special class of people take the Rapture Hallelujah we can call it the translation the thing that excites me because I realize we're living in the last days if you understand if a company that we have already embraced what we call world war three it has not yet escalated but we can see it moving in that direction Hallelujah and if that be true how much time do we have who is going to be surprised because the Rapture would have taken place and they would be left behind us who call themselves Christians I'm talking about people who claim to follow this message will be left behind why Wow because they fail [Music] now you and I must come to know [Music] why because brother Brandon has gone off the scene then if that be the case [Music] the scripture is from here brother tied that particular scripture where Jesus read in Isaiah when he said just he stops because he realized the day of Vengeance was yet to come there and read that scripture he did not only say this is the acceptable year of the Lord You may call this global warming in [Music] um it said [Music] talking about you and me we are we are Kingdom s hallelujah amen is that right understand it's later than we think Hallelujah through the scripture brother type the bride and Enoch was translated he pleased God he had a testimony he walked with God and if you read the scripture and you look look with God there's something missing in the equation but the missing part is the part that God began to [Music] so the word was it yeah to escape and whatever God told also in William brothers and he told us in order to make Heaven you've got to have perfect love and then he preached the message the statue of a perfect man and this is how we walk with God hallelujah he had a preview of the bride was walking but as she walked she was going up that is how it is with the word of God [Music] yes no Rapture for you hallelujah amen when we look at this thing we'll talk about the resurrection what really strong foreign you know how translations Translate Philip oh Philippe Phillip Thomas she translated from here yes it takes you from one place so you know you can be so sure amen now this is my own little Theory but I'm gonna throw it out at you if you had since she was in Arizona Mountain s because as a young man I can barely make it thank you foreign [Music] something things will unfold to us born of this dimensions [Music] [Music] let me ask you a question myself Paul was dead three times what made him give it up yeah it was [Music] you've heard testimonies what I've seen in communion apply the bread and the wine that's today and the Bible says hallelujah amen now what God you say what what do you mean brother bro was carried up with it now why Hallelujah because that was only like also remember [Music] the Hebrew children yeah hallelujah amen because you understand they were in the Fox don't live here even Angel smoke amen was all that garments Hallelujah [Music] we put it looks like the Son of God we the bride of Jesus Christ he's not afraid of the fire fire [Music] got a building on me amen let me tell you something people of God as I was in service [Music] wasn't even aware of it is charging because to my understanding the way I saw it his whole face is like a transfer formed into the face of Jesus now the brother wasn't even aware of that's why I know this message is right this is why I'm preaching on the Earth things happening those who are Spirituals [Music] foreign I'm dealing with you and they began to sing to the Lord and all of a sudden prayer that was the out do it will make sure amen they began to praise God all of a sudden the Bible said that the jailhouse rocks about [Music] a god we're not expecting that now that we've got the words no matter what happens if they come in during The Squeeze [Music] same thing for us [Music] God is still good and welcome to shoes someone yesterday this is not being Methodist Baptist or any other kind of religion y'all looking at me y'all like you're looking at the ghosts I mean I'm telling you the truth Christianity hallelujah amen we come to show the world the life of Jesus Christ and if we come to show the world of life fantastic oh my he's the same Hallelujah man you know I've out myself to get a little cool you know you run away people to take your virtue replace your car run long gas that's how it is with you yeah [Music] yourself on the news [Music] and she wasn't she wasn't cold and now that God is killing me you and I must realize amen hallelujah amen that brother said it's a friend he didn't see what I saw it is I said I just want you to know I saw something Supernatural hallelujah amen y'all better hear what I'm saying and then the Lord brought my attention how that drug that he said when he put the prescription in the woman's hands he said woman's hair when I looked up he said it was in the woman's face you've done it unto me if you look for the supernatural if you know with the Holy ghosts doesn't have Supernatural events happening how can you have the Holy Ghost and you don't see Jesus amen you know how that scripture that song says he talks with me and he tells me Amy I am his own wind has the last the wind has it when the last you heard he'll talk with you [Music] foreign he's real yes in the power of his resurrection Resurrection hallelujah amen how can you believe you'll be raptured if you don't believe God Is A Healer the self-existing Hallelujah [Music] but the Jesus they know excuse me excuse me it's still in a Manger they're still on the cross but my God and he's alive Hallelujah [Music] VMware hallelujah amen I'm not ashamed like Paul says I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ unto salvation Hallelujah is that right see the power of the Resurrection is eternal life it's Elohim Hallelujah the self-existing ones Hallelujah but before we knew him as God is that right he said he was a self-existing one hello he was the only one covered all time and space amen he was the only one that's like he created time and he created space he has no beginning he has no ending but they put it in our terms [Music] has no no significance we miss you [Applause] no weapon okay y'all hear what I'm saying did you and he don't ever change amen amen he told me we have our place everything is and Christ Jesus has made us join here everything when Jesus got hungry and he wanted to go eat eat corn but he didn't have to ask for it we forget you need a new car yeah [Music] I mean children of God we don't lack anything I'm in is that right she said [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying God knows what he's doing don't blame God [Music] he removed [Music] he removed that curse before you say how can that be this is Hallelujah [Music] amen but we over there working and working so much we don't have them hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah that's not where God wants you to be amen is that right excuse me when he delivered Israel out of Egypt under the task Masters [Music] because he that said the son he that set you free I'm not saying you don't have to work when God can give you a better job [Music] this is what you hear foreign [Music] hallelujah hallelujah I believe that with all my heart I've seen I've seen him do it I've seen him do it coming from the message brother random said it like this and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection will be raised up foreign [Music] the earnest the benefits it turns it turned Heavenly and tuna so listen now the earnings that you're going that's the earnest so I said it's a little benefit that you're going in the Rapture yeah man but you know people say well yours on your spirit about your life he's still away [Music] I might not be quoting Barbados when the Rapture takes place [Music] Inside Man foreign [Music] [Music] that God kept to himself from the beginning of the police they did not understand when God called Abraham was gone amen now under the Hallelujah that's right Right Touch the Stars he receives his Mercy amen people don't understand this third pool is moving it's moving and one of these old days of days of the Terry London here y'all better hear what I'm saying amen if one of your legs are missing yeah [Music] amen why because God will fix it here first [Music] Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] we pray is God Hallelujah Hallelujah 's Clinic you know to find out how come her blood was so clean [Music] [Applause] God is moving God is moving even if you're not moving if you want to hold on to the world and we're listening I'll be somewhere squishy Hallelujah you know I brought me one of them little Jesus shirts yesterday you know for a long time I wouldn't wear a shirt like that right because I thought well you know I want them to see me a far off you understand me see if I just had God on there they'll come up to me if I just only had God on the shirts they've approached me but because you got ships they don't like that is I've watched it because I want people to people in the word inside and out I went over there by the salad bar because my wife at Ruby Tuesday evening um I just like that shirt see foreign [Music] Maybe let me let me read some more that's okay the unveiling of God legitimately uh brother when I'm preacher one paragraph 118. how God could have mercy on foul Sinners as us when he hid himself it's the Issa is p word of God today when Jesus they would have seen um God gave him Grace [Music] God had you and my foreign [Music] you know but you can't play with this foreign the last one so if you don't witness if you think mercian is over around [Music] and he said just give him he said when that one even if it's a book and if they accept the message see what we don't understand election is totally different questions because the Holy Ghost was given ESS before you even foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] nobody Moses saw s [Music] from the hand of God from top to the bottom [Music] [Music] two years and he began to walk the door myself completely [Music] wrong [Music] sometimes you know [Music] [Music] it's not him that [Music] him how can you not know him how can you not know him man you you go testimony and when your troubles come he's asking you to trust him if the moment [Music] what was the Holy Ghost given for foreign Son of God of God that's the only way you know the Resurrection The Holy Ghost Bear's record of the Holy Ghost don't see a change you're a new creature fight with these worldly things you got people still doing wrong and you deliberately and you don't even see that God God's watching you if women oh ain't nobody see me yeah God sees you if it is you're never alone brought me all the way up to now and he said where you ran into trouble [Music] we think God has forsaken us when you think yeah is always watching you thank you the deacons may not see you may not see us [Music] may not see you she's everything and the Bible says he's going to have the given account the 100 of the sins that's done in the flesh glad you let me finish this please the only way you'll know the resurrection is when the Holy Ghost bear records foreign [Music] that's the only way that you'll ever come back Hallelujah [Music] gradu ain't God good Ness I'm looking for something special here oh brother I'm talking about the resurrection he said what goes down is the same that goes up don't even think if you go down as a sinner you going up coming up as a saint s foreign that's resurrection and so we we want to make sure he says then when when a man is born again he becomes a thumbs up and when this robe of flesh is dropped there's a natural body theophany a body that the body not made with hands that we go too that's the reason Jesus preach to the souls that is um let me see what we what we see let me say it like this for those of us who are not Christians and those of us who perhaps may not understand what I'm trying to do if I had a million dollars over here I said the first one that that gets up and touched me a million dollars I don't care if you're sitting in the back door by the back by the back door you would muster up some strength they'll be pushing and shoving and knocking and keep everything just to get to that million dollars what God is offering more than that he's offering eternal life and he ain't asking you to you believe on me your body will flow rivers of Living Waters okay so you see what I'm saying wait the question but we'll pass that by it seemed like yesterday when I was just a young boy in January I'll be 68.00 foreign whether we like it or not I don't care what kind of cream you put on ageless pills [Music] I want you to listen closely you're not going to remain here forever something gonna take you out you gonna die one way or another hallelujah amen but if this Earthly Tabernacles body must die I don't want to die with my body there's something that tells me is life after death who doesn't want to live I don't care how bad this world is that people still don't want to die think about it and there's a word there's no business no earthquakes [Music] and God says all you gotta do believe in me and trust me I came to give the world alive you say about brother Brooks I make a lot of mistakes you probably will do until Jesus comes he became that's why he went to Calvary he even with the health he went to hell for you that means you don't have to go to hell for you he did all of that for you he got whipped he he got beaten for you with his stripes we're healed every time he was beaten is because of your sins because of your transgressions [Music] me and my brothers were you know we were okay real close but that would have been a lie but but we were okay but when it came for me to get a whipping I can't okay no no no no they didn't do that you know you know they went on the outside of the door and they're laughing every time you wait but that ain't how Jesus Works he literally went to hell she suffered everything he suffered so I'm gonna tell you how the Judgment would be hello then you become one that says crucified on the side that says crucifying it's like you spending me and somebody say this and closings close to God as you possibly can remember we have you troubled me seeing that you have become the enemy of God Mercy jobs he would say listen Sam yourself because of what you've done you're going to be with me tomorrow is that right amen don't you see that was the grace of God even say s God's grace is great Hallelujah see God to keep his promise even even if we don't keep ourselves God said he loved the backslider you can't yeah [Music] and even though see God and this is my story we're living in the last days I can't scream it enough I don't know about you but God is dealing with me in a mighty way I'm grateful foreign and I've cried out for this for a long time because because we let our trials bring us down let our tests you know kind of almost put the fire out but in all of that I've learned that no matter what I've gone through in my life he never left me more now than I ever when I see the Lord prayer yeah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] with us [Music] always [Music] [Applause] [Music] over you care face of Sinners Jesus we said oh he is [Music] [Music] I will be [Music] [Music] I said it wrong [Music] [Applause] oh I said [Music] I said it loud [Music] oh judgment is coming oh we're better [Music] I listening [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] compassion open this love [Music] Faithful and True Foundation [Music]
