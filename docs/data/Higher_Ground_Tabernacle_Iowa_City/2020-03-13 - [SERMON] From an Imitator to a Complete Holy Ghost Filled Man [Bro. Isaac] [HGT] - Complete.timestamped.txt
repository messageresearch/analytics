[25:34] oh man
[25:42] [Music]
[25:48] and when God bless you it's good have
[25:51] been the house of the Lord man we're so
[25:54] happy to be here tonight you thank
[25:56] everybody for coming so without taking
[26:00] much time we can stand with the Bible so
[26:05] we were hoping we open the Bible in the
[26:08] book of first Corinthians chapter 13 so
[26:16] we will read the entire chapter I think
[26:22] I believe he only has 13 verses so we're
[26:27] trying to read the entire chapter first
[26:30] Corinthians chapter 13 it's a familiar
[26:33] scripture talking about charity the
[26:37] verse first verse the Bible says there
[26:40] was speak with the tongues of men and of
[26:42] angels and have not charity I am
[26:46] becoming I am become as a sounding brass
[26:49] or a tinkling a tinkling cymbal and
[26:54] though I have the gift of prophecy and
[26:56] understand all mysteries and all
[26:59] knowledge and though I have all faith so
[27:02] that I could remove mountains and have
[27:05] not charity I am nothing and though I
[27:09] bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
[27:12] though I give my body to be burned and
[27:16] have not charity it profiteth me nothing
[27:21] charity suffereth long and is kind
[27:24] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[27:29] itself is puffed up i mean is not puffed
[27:33] up doth not behave itself unseemly
[27:37] seeketh not her own is not easily
[27:42] provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not
[27:46] in iniquity but rejoices in the truth or
[27:50] in other versions he says that you
[27:52] Richard he rejoiced with the truth
[27:55] beareth all things believeth all things
[27:59] hopeth all things endure
[28:01] all things charity never faileth but
[28:04] whether there be no prophecy whether
[28:07] there be prophecies they shall fail
[28:09] whether there be tongues they shall
[28:12] cease whether there be knowledge it
[28:15] shall vanish away for we know in part
[28:19] and we prophesy in part but when that
[28:22] which is perfect is come then that which
[28:25] is in part shall be done away when I was
[28:29] a child I spake as a child I understood
[28:31] as a child I thought as a child but when
[28:35] I became a man I put away childish
[28:37] things for now we see through glass
[28:41] darkly but then face to face now I know
[28:46] in part but then shall I know even as
[28:51] also I am known
[28:53] and now by it now abideth Faith Hope
[28:57] charity these three but the greatest of
[29:01] these is charity amen let's go back to
[29:05] Ezekiel chapter 36 really Ezekiel
[29:11] chapter 36 we read on verse 22 the 22nd
[29:16] verse to the 27th
[29:29] Ezekiel 36
[29:37] Isaiah chapter 36 verse 22 to 27 the
[29:41] Bible says therefore say under the house
[29:45] of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do
[29:50] not this for your sakes over house of
[29:53] Israel but for my own name's sake which
[29:56] he have profaned among the heathen
[29:58] whither he went and I was sanctified my
[30:03] great name which was profaned among the
[30:06] Eden which ye have profaned in the maze
[30:10] of them and the heathen shall know that
[30:13] I am the Lord saith the Lord God
[30:16] when I shall be sanctified in you before
[30:19] their eyes for I would take you from
[30:23] among the even and gather you out of the
[30:26] countries and will bring you into the
[30:29] into your own land then will I sprinkle
[30:32] clean water upon you and you shall be
[30:35] clean from all your filthiness and from
[30:40] all your idols will I cleanse you now
[30:44] verse 26 that's the one we want to focus
[30:47] on and 27 the Bible says 26 and no heart
[30:51] also will I give you and a new spirit
[30:54] without pool within you and I will take
[30:56] away the stony heart out of out of your
[30:59] flesh and I will give you an and heart
[31:02] of flesh and I will put my spirit within
[31:05] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[31:09] and ye shall keep my Commandments and do
[31:13] them amen let's bow our head before the
[31:16] Lord dear Jesus Lord we thank you for
[31:19] your grace in your mercy Lord we thank
[31:21] you Father God for this privilege father
[31:24] Lord - as mortal father God - come in
[31:27] the presence of the Almighty God Lord
[31:30] Jesus Christ we humbly father God come
[31:33] before you and ask you Jesus Christ to
[31:35] speak O Father Lord Lord Jesus take me
[31:38] out of the way Lord Jesus and speak to
[31:40] your people or bless their heart or
[31:42] father the way that we're here and bless
[31:44] Oh father Lord Jesus Christ
[31:47] everybody Lord Lord we ask you to take
[31:49] the first place to pray - Lord Jesus
[31:51] Christ come on Ord and deliver father
[31:54] guy your word to your people Lord and at
[31:57] the end of the service Lord Jesus will
[31:59] not miss to say thank you thank you for
[32:01] everything that you have done and thank
[32:03] you for everything that you are doing
[32:05] now and thank you for everything that
[32:06] you would do in Jesus Christ's name we
[32:08] pray amen amen you may be seated
[32:11] so tonight I have a little thought that
[32:15] I'd like to share with you and if I can
[32:18] Title II it'll be from an imitator to a
[32:23] complete Holy Ghost field man so we
[32:28] still you know with the same the same
[32:30] thought that we were dealing on last
[32:33] Friday before the youth meetings about
[32:36] the faith faith in God and tonight where
[32:39] we're trying to change a little bit the
[32:42] angle and bring you to a journey from an
[32:46] imitator to a complete - accompli holy
[32:49] spirit filled man so the verse that we
[32:52] read in Corinthians chapter 13 the Bible
[32:55] is very clear saying that I might have
[32:58] all the gift that is in the Bible my F
[33:03] I might have everything written in the
[33:05] Bible but if I don't have charity which
[33:08] charity is the Holy Spirit which the
[33:10] Holy Spirit's God if I don't have that
[33:13] you know all the things that I might do
[33:15] is in vain am I even you know it goes
[33:18] even farther saying that I might give my
[33:20] own body to be burned for my brother or
[33:23] I might give all my gift or all my money
[33:26] everything that I do have for somebody
[33:27] else but if I don't have charity or if I
[33:31] don't have the love of God inside of me
[33:33] all those good things that all those
[33:35] good things that are we trying to do or
[33:38] that I would like to do for somebody
[33:39] else it doesn't mean anything you know
[33:42] that that shows that you know therefore
[33:45] the most important thing that we need to
[33:47] have is charity is the Holy Spirit and
[33:50] then that's why I said from an imitator
[33:53] to a complete holy spirit filled man you
[33:55] know that the verse in the chapter in
[33:58] Corinthians you know shows the
[34:01] somebody who doesn't have charity and
[34:03] who is trying to do all those work he
[34:06] only is trying to imitate what the Holy
[34:10] Spirit what the product of the Holy
[34:11] Spirit would do and that means basically
[34:14] and it clearly saying that you know if
[34:16] you don't have charity though you would
[34:18] try to imitate all those things that
[34:21] would mean nothing not mean nothing to
[34:23] you because we see that when God created
[34:25] the man he put inside of the man of
[34:27] thirst and the thirst it put a thirst to
[34:30] look for God they put in every man
[34:33] though you may be Christian or not
[34:34] though you may be a message believer or
[34:36] not though you may be a child or anybody
[34:39] else in this earth God when he created
[34:42] you he put inside of you our thirst and
[34:44] that thirst can only be filled or that
[34:47] thirst can only be completed by God
[34:50] himself but now we see the devil seeing
[34:53] the power of the threat of the thirst
[34:55] that is inside of a man seeing the power
[34:57] of that thirst goes something for sure
[35:00] that if you have that thirst inside of
[35:02] you that first which way will push you
[35:04] or where do we we push you to go look
[35:08] for God to go look for more God and the
[35:11] devil seeing the power of that thirst
[35:13] out that thirst of God is leading people
[35:15] to Calvary of how the thirst of God is
[35:19] leading people to receive more Christ of
[35:21] how the thirst of God is leading people
[35:23] you know to have more crushing them you
[35:26] know he saw that power of the thirst and
[35:28] then he started not to create things to
[35:31] shut that thirst off it started not to
[35:34] create things to you know to like to
[35:38] satisfy the thirst
[35:40] that's what we see that people always
[35:42] trying to imitate or we see that people
[35:44] always trying to do something you know
[35:47] to try to imitate the things and we see
[35:49] that thing started in the beginning in
[35:51] Genesis we see that when and when Adam
[35:53] and Eve what were created by God and you
[35:56] know God put God gave them you know God
[36:00] created them and he made them in a
[36:01] certain way and then he told them you
[36:03] know they're the eyes was blind they
[36:05] couldn't see their nakedness you know
[36:08] they couldn't see any evil you know
[36:10] everything was perfect everything was
[36:12] loved and everything wasn't
[36:14] our money and the Bible says that in
[36:16] evening you know God was coming to
[36:18] fellowship with them and in evening I
[36:21] was coming to to have a communion with
[36:23] them but we see that after the fall we
[36:27] see Adam you know realizing that he was
[36:29] naked and we see Adam realizing who it
[36:32] was and we see Adam his eyes now being
[36:35] opened you know it went and he tried to
[36:38] hate him see try to hide himself and
[36:40] when he was hiding you know the devil
[36:42] came and it could ever forgive him you
[36:45] know an idea of imitating what God was
[36:48] doing what he did was that he took the
[36:51] fig leaf and then it tried to hide is
[36:53] you know his nudity or his run and hide
[36:56] is his nakedness because we see that in
[36:58] the beginning when they were created God
[37:00] hided their nakedness they couldn't see
[37:02] themselves Nick naked but when they fall
[37:05] went after the fall you know the devil
[37:07] came and he trying to be you know he
[37:09] told you know it try to help him to
[37:11] create a religion or he trying to help
[37:14] him to imitate what God was doing but he
[37:18] did that didn't not work out you know
[37:20] God came down and he asked them cuz the
[37:23] thing is that when we try to create
[37:25] something that is not original or one
[37:28] we're trying to create something that is
[37:29] not from God nothing will not last you
[37:32] know what that thing will have an end
[37:33] that thing were you know we're one day
[37:36] nothing will perish one day that thing
[37:38] you know you have to move into another
[37:41] level that's the same thing with Adam
[37:43] when he created that religion with the
[37:45] fig leaves you know what they forgot
[37:47] that you know that fig leaves will
[37:49] wither now filled lives you know hasn't
[37:52] handed that fig leaves you know after
[37:54] the for now that fig leaves had an end
[37:56] you know one day you know it will wither
[37:58] and the one day we will try to create
[38:00] another thing but when God came we know
[38:02] what what God did for us and what God
[38:05] did for them you know he killed the lamb
[38:06] to make you know and to make a sacrifice
[38:10] and you forgive the sin and then we are
[38:12] last Friday when we were talking we took
[38:14] we so we took the story of ETO of Isaac
[38:19] with our Jacob and I so we see that
[38:22] Jacob was trying to imitate that what it
[38:27] was doing
[38:28] Jakub when when God went he arrived at
[38:31] the time of blessing we see that Jacob
[38:33] you know was trying to imitate that's
[38:35] why he went and it took the court of his
[38:38] brother because it dad was going to know
[38:41] who it was is that what's going to smell
[38:43] him and they died was going to say that
[38:45] this is not in so by its Jacob you know
[38:48] that's how we have the some other people
[38:50] that want the experience to be schooled
[38:53] you know they want to be schooled or
[38:56] they want experience to be school you
[38:58] know that will not happen you know you
[38:59] cannot you cannot miss you can your
[39:02] experience cannot be schooling to you
[39:04] you know it's something that is to be
[39:06] real it's something that is to come
[39:08] inside of your life inside of you that
[39:10] needs to produce those experiences so
[39:13] you try to imitate something or try to
[39:15] fake something or try to impersonate
[39:18] something doesn't help because one day
[39:20] it'll come to an end one day it'll have
[39:23] to stop and then we see that Jacobs
[39:26] thought that he said only you know after
[39:29] going to his father after lying that he
[39:31] was it so he thought that everything was
[39:33] fine and everything was settled but
[39:35] after years after you know he found
[39:38] himself in trouble he finally said about
[39:40] what tells us that ISA was coming to
[39:42] Jacob with 400 armed men you know with
[39:45] 400 men that was powerful than him and
[39:47] there were you know they were going to
[39:51] kill him and they were you know we
[39:53] didn't say that you know today is the
[39:55] last day you know we're going to kill
[39:57] him but after that after he realized
[40:00] that you know schooling experiences or
[40:02] or imitating doesn't help me he had to
[40:06] go look for the face of God he had to go
[40:08] look for God he had to go look for the
[40:10] genuine God we see that in the Bible
[40:12] explains that you know first as a man
[40:15] you know he tried to create to have his
[40:19] own you know to have his own ways how
[40:21] out to get out of the situation you know
[40:24] he divided his group he divided his
[40:26] servants he divided everybody that he
[40:29] was with him but you know after that at
[40:31] the end of the day he understood that
[40:32] that was not going to help him he
[40:35] understood that you know the only thing
[40:36] that was going to happen was a personal
[40:38] relationship with God he understood that
[40:41] the only thing
[40:41] I was gonna help him it was the person
[40:44] he wants to know God personally not to
[40:46] know God by what my mother has told me
[40:48] not to know God by what my father has
[40:51] told me not to know God by what my dad
[40:53] my wife and my pastor has told me but to
[40:56] make God personally to have an own
[40:58] experience my own experience with God
[41:00] that I can say that's from that time you
[41:03] know girl from dad's and from that
[41:05] experience from meeting God in that
[41:07] place for meeting God in that time my
[41:09] experience has changed my life has
[41:11] changed and Jacob you know he had those
[41:14] experiences you know he had experiences
[41:16] that was cool to him by his mother you
[41:19] know his mother was telling him what
[41:20] that was right his mother was telling
[41:22] him you know the story how you know God
[41:25] told his father to you know by God or
[41:29] his grandfather to get out of this land
[41:31] and to go you know to a land where God
[41:33] will show him you know he had all those
[41:35] experiences his mother told him how his
[41:38] father was born by faith his mother told
[41:41] him you know everything is experience
[41:43] that he had but that was not enough to
[41:46] change the life of Jacob you know that
[41:48] was not enough to change the life of
[41:50] Jacob Jacob I've heard about faith Jacob
[41:53] ever heard about God Jacob have heard
[41:55] about you know what God has done Jack
[41:57] I've heard about how God brought down
[41:59] you know his father from his land by
[42:02] Jacob needed to have his own experience
[42:04] that one day when they we asked him
[42:07] Jacob what do you think that that is
[42:08] real to you Jacob what makes you saying
[42:11] that God is real what makes you saying
[42:13] that you've met God what makes you
[42:15] saying that you've been changed you know
[42:17] Jacob needed to have something to show
[42:19] people as a token that from that time
[42:22] from that day that my life has been
[42:24] changed and here we see that Jacob try
[42:26] to imitate his brother he took the court
[42:29] of this record of his brother tried to
[42:30] fake it so but it did not work out that
[42:33] jacob arrived at a point where the angel
[42:36] now came in and you know it gave his
[42:39] name who his name was Jacob and he gave
[42:41] you know it's all the angel water but
[42:43] you know everything about him and he was
[42:44] changed and then and then we see that
[42:49] you know after the blessings of Jacob
[42:53] you know nothing changed
[42:55] you know he went and he went a trouble
[42:58] after troubles
[42:59] but after God after chick I met the
[43:01] angel that's where that's where you know
[43:03] things were changed and we see two dead
[43:06] people
[43:06] where I referred and I've heard this
[43:09] story of a man I think you all know him
[43:12] who was a message believer who wasn't a
[43:15] message before because of his posture
[43:18] you know his posture did something that
[43:20] was wrong and the man had to live the
[43:22] message you know I was thinking about
[43:23] Dinah I said something that you know I
[43:26] thought about something I said that you
[43:29] know if you look at the beginning that
[43:30] man did not have a personal relationship
[43:33] with God because if somebody is in
[43:36] relationship with God if somebody really
[43:39] made God personally no matter what can
[43:42] come to him no matter what can come to
[43:44] him you know it will not move because is
[43:47] you know is hope isn't God it's not in
[43:50] something he's not in somebody oil it's
[43:52] not in something else but when we lean
[43:54] on somebody instead of leaning on God
[43:56] when we watch somebody instead of
[43:58] watching God you know that's what
[43:59] happened you know we see in the Bible
[44:01] there was a prophet who was watching
[44:03] after a king you know he was watching
[44:05] after I think I forgot his name by he
[44:08] was watching after a king but one day
[44:11] that that King did something that was
[44:12] wrong that King you know was punished by
[44:15] God that troubled the life of the
[44:17] Prophet
[44:18] you know that trouble the left of the
[44:19] Prophet why because he had all this hope
[44:23] on somebody else you know it was comfort
[44:25] and you know by seeing other people
[44:28] living you know it was about till the
[44:30] day that himself met God he understood
[44:33] that this is not about somebody else
[44:35] it's about God and me this is about you
[44:37] know it's a it's a business between God
[44:39] and I you know I don't care no matter
[44:41] how many people will leave the message I
[44:44] don't care no matter how people will
[44:46] forsake this but if I met this and if I
[44:48] know that this message is the truth you
[44:51] know I don't care if I you know we sing
[44:53] the same we sing this song that I will
[44:55] follow Jesus if everybody don't want to
[44:58] go with me but if it's myself following
[45:00] Jesus I would go I will not turn my you
[45:03] know this is this surance happens when
[45:06] we have at what we have a personal
[45:09] experience
[45:09] with God this assurance happened you
[45:12] know when you know God personally want
[45:14] you to know that you know no matter what
[45:15] I do God will never fail me because I
[45:18] know where I was I know where I've been
[45:20] I know who I was and I know now how I am
[45:23] so now it's not effects of imitating
[45:26] anymore
[45:27] now it's a fact of living what is inside
[45:29] of you the prophecies that the
[45:33] prophecies that I want to read the
[45:35] prophets he said that well you say that
[45:38] do you believe that you can drink no I
[45:42] never said that look a grant of we can
[45:46] only produce wheat it can't produce
[45:48] cocklebur there is no desire in it there
[45:52] is no life in it to produce cockle burrs
[45:55] with and if we are in cross Jesus he
[46:00] jumped in and he said again in paragraph
[46:02] 63 don't be deceived you had better
[46:06] you'd better search this close now see
[46:08] if you keep on saying I don't condemn me
[46:11] to do this and I don't condemn me to do
[46:14] that things of the world of you know
[46:17] he's talking about things of the world
[46:18] I'm going to hurt you just a little bit
[46:21] put the father's back the other way
[46:24] but it's this one sure evidence you have
[46:29] never been to Christ you've never been
[46:32] born again you know you know when you
[46:35] say that you know I don't I don't
[46:36] condemn me gossiping I don't condemn me
[46:38] lying I don't condemn me you know
[46:40] wearing makeup I don't condemn me you
[46:42] know doing this I don't condemn me doing
[46:45] you know all those wrong things I don't
[46:47] condemn myself you know father listening
[46:50] to this music I don't condemn myself
[46:51] doing this and that the Prophet is
[46:54] basically saying that you know you have
[46:56] never been born again or you have never
[46:59] had the experience with God and there's
[47:02] another quote that the Prophet says that
[47:04] if there's a question in your mind about
[47:06] something that you want to do there's a
[47:09] question or you questioning yourself
[47:10] about something he said that you better
[47:12] not do it I want to read the prophecies
[47:14] that now but if there's a question men
[47:17] come say that do you think is wrong it's
[47:20] wrong to smoke what are you asking about
[47:23] for it it's a question in your mind
[47:26] leave it alone for anything you don't do
[47:29] by faith is sin that's right
[47:32] got to beat by faith so how can you
[47:36] smoke and have faith see it's right in
[47:40] your in your own conscience shows you
[47:42] that you're wrong so if it's uncertain
[47:45] you better leave it alone cuz that might
[47:48] be the one thing that keeps you out of
[47:50] the kingdom of God you know that might
[47:53] that might be the one thing that might
[47:55] keep you out of the kingdom of God that
[47:57] thing that you question yourself you
[47:59] know it happens up you know we--you many
[48:01] happens that sometimes you want to do
[48:03] something but you know you have
[48:05] questions about that you is this right
[48:08] or is this you know according to the
[48:10] word or is this you know God's program
[48:13] or is this this or you know this am i
[48:15] right doing this the Prophet is
[48:17] basically saying that you know when you
[48:19] have those questions when you have those
[48:21] kind of doubts inside of you you better
[48:23] leave that thing alone because you have
[48:26] to do everything by faith faith doesn't
[48:28] have any questions faith doesn't have
[48:30] you know doubts faith is something that
[48:33] when you say that you go and you for it
[48:35] but if there's something you know in
[48:37] your mind asking you know you asking
[48:39] yourself that if this music right or you
[48:42] know is this a closed right or you know
[48:45] is makeup right or is you know wearing
[48:47] this right or if doing this right the
[48:50] Prophet said that if it was right you
[48:52] couldn't ask yourself questions but if
[48:54] you ask yourself questions meaning that
[48:57] there's something with it you know but
[48:58] you better live because that thing that
[49:00] you're asking yourself questions can it
[49:03] can be the only thing that can keep you
[49:05] out of the kingdom of God and I know the
[49:07] desire of everybody here is not to be
[49:09] kept out of the kingdom of God it's to
[49:11] go you know with God you know and we see
[49:15] that you know you know but Habakkuk
[49:17] going back to the experience we see that
[49:19] the experience is something that was
[49:21] it's good you know having experience
[49:24] with God is good but we have not only to
[49:27] stop there but we have now to have no
[49:29] idea our life being changed because we
[49:32] see the Esther when she was asked her
[49:35] and all her friends
[49:36] for going to the before going to the
[49:39] King everybody was saying that you know
[49:42] I would meet the King and I'll be the
[49:43] one who will be chosen will be chosen
[49:45] and and I'll be that the Queen but we
[49:49] see that all those concubines when they
[49:51] went to meet the king you know they did
[49:54] not talk about concubine Styles they
[49:56] talk about men and wife you know about
[49:58] their future but after that you know
[50:01] after that after being with the King
[50:03] they laughs not was once worth changed
[50:05] you know they were not chosen you know
[50:07] it's the same thing you know you might
[50:09] have experiences you know with God you
[50:11] might have experienced no you know I
[50:13] felt one day I was praying and I felt
[50:15] that way wind coming and touch me or I
[50:18] felt somebody touched my hand or I saw
[50:21] an angel or you know I prayed for
[50:23] somebody and you see it and I prayed
[50:24] this and I prayed this you know those
[50:26] are the women's can also tell you that
[50:29] they've been with the Kings you know
[50:31] what they spend the night with the King
[50:33] they talk with the King you know they
[50:35] did the King told them you know why what
[50:37] kind of wives oh you know he wants you
[50:40] know you can have all those kind of
[50:42] experience but that really thing is that
[50:43] after that experience where is your life
[50:46] now after that experience you know where
[50:49] are you now from what you from where you
[50:52] was before after that experience where
[50:54] are you now
[50:55] the Prophet said that you know you might
[50:57] have an experience with God and today
[50:59] you feel that you feel with the Holy
[51:00] Spirit and you say that I won't do this
[51:03] and I won't do that but after one day or
[51:05] two days or after a month or three
[51:07] months you find yourself doing the same
[51:10] thing that you say that you want to say
[51:11] that you have to question yourself you
[51:14] have to question your experience with
[51:15] God you know because we see that in this
[51:18] time that we have too many imitators
[51:20] then - then they then people who I feel
[51:23] really filled with the Holy Spirit you
[51:25] know we see that in this time that in
[51:26] this label alive for journey that we
[51:28] live in that we see that people stop by
[51:32] imitating they only stop that this cause
[51:34] it's a journey you know I give my own
[51:37] experience that myself I was an imitator
[51:39] before but it was a journey that I had
[51:42] to step out of it you know I had to step
[51:44] up you know to live that level of
[51:46] imitating what the word was saying to me
[51:49] to live that level of
[51:50] imitating what other was doing do you
[51:52] know to go into a personal relationship
[51:55] with God to go into you know a
[51:57] one-on-one you know talk with God to go
[52:00] on into a one-on-one you know
[52:02] relationship with God I tell you my my
[52:04] own experience then you know I I was
[52:07] born in the message you know as most of
[52:09] us are you know and then mama you know I
[52:12] went to a message high school
[52:15] you know and then up there you know I
[52:17] saw people you know first before getting
[52:20] to that school I saw how those people
[52:22] those other students you know the head
[52:24] they were quoting the Prophet they were
[52:27] quoting the Bible and I found myself I
[52:30] didn't know anybody first in my head I
[52:32] never you know probably I never you know
[52:35] read the message before and when I found
[52:37] those people and I admired them and I
[52:39] wanted to be like them but when I got
[52:42] into the school I understood that
[52:44] something was different that they were
[52:46] only quoting by the lines most of them
[52:48] their life were not reflecting what they
[52:50] were doing and and then and I'm you know
[52:53] I went and I looked my I had friends
[52:57] that were filled with the Holy Spirit
[52:58] then I started not to make myself a
[53:00] picture of how a person filled with the
[53:03] Holy Spirit needs to be you know but I
[53:05] give you an example that back and you
[53:07] know when we're in the school you know
[53:09] what they were doing that you know that
[53:11] we're not talking to girls you know it
[53:12] was a sin you know talking to them you
[53:15] know you have to be sweet when you talk
[53:16] to somebody you have to be serious you
[53:18] have to do this you have to be that you
[53:20] have to do this and I pictured myself
[53:22] that this is how a holy spirit filled
[53:24] man needs to be and I tried not to
[53:26] imitate you know to copy that certain
[53:29] life without how they were living why to
[53:32] to fit myself you know in the picture
[53:35] but that did not help me you know I
[53:38] always had something inside of me that
[53:40] was lacking I always had something
[53:42] inside of me that was missing by the day
[53:45] I found Christ you know I understood
[53:46] that you know it's not about how my life
[53:49] is or it's not about you know how all
[53:51] holy I look you know to people it's not
[53:55] about how serious I look to people it's
[53:57] not about how you know I don't smile all
[54:00] I don't do this I don't do that but it's
[54:02] all about you know God
[54:04] being inside of him because one thing is
[54:07] that the Holy Spirit is the teacher when
[54:09] the Holy Spirit comes in you you don't
[54:11] need somebody else you know you don't
[54:13] need somebody to tell you that this is
[54:14] wrong or this is true you know sometimes
[54:17] we do need that but most of the time the
[54:19] Holy Spirit inside of you you know we
[54:20] tell you as brother Brooks always says
[54:22] that there is no such things like God
[54:25] forgive my mind my own unseen he said
[54:27] that if the Holy Spirit is inside of you
[54:29] everything wrong that you do that you do
[54:32] the Holy Spirit will tell you that this
[54:34] is wrong that you need to repent you
[54:35] know the Holy Spirit will tell you
[54:37] because the Prophet the Bible says that
[54:39] the Holy Spirit is a teacher is a
[54:40] comforter it would teach us in all truth
[54:43] you know it will show us the way you
[54:46] know sometimes you feel weak and
[54:48] sometimes you do something that you
[54:49] never thought about that day this was
[54:51] wrong or you never read about that in
[54:53] the Bible or you never heard about the
[54:55] Prophet talking about this is wrong but
[54:57] after doing it you feel there's
[54:59] something wrong inside of you or that
[55:01] this little small voice is telling you
[55:03] that brother what you did is wrong that
[55:04] you need to go repent you know that's
[55:06] the Spirit of God that's the Holy Spirit
[55:08] inside of you and most of the time what
[55:11] we do what we do is like we try to shut
[55:14] down voice off we try to shut that voice
[55:16] or we don't want to hear about it you
[55:18] know we - our pride and we think that we
[55:21] all right and we try to you know to shut
[55:24] that voice but that's the worst thing
[55:26] that we can do you know is to try to
[55:28] shut that little voice that is telling
[55:30] us every time that you know what you do
[55:32] is right oh is wrong you know we always
[55:35] have to hear or to listen cuz the holy
[55:38] spirit of prophecy that is shy you know
[55:40] after doing this it'll come and what
[55:43] point that you will never hear about him
[55:46] again you know you will never hear about
[55:48] the small voice again you know and then
[55:51] at that time you are in a dangerous
[55:54] place you know you really need to repent
[55:56] and you really need to have that thing
[55:57] back in you you know you know the
[56:00] Prophet says that the church doesn't
[56:03] need a smartest man or the smartest guy
[56:05] in the world to run it but it needs the
[56:08] baptism of the Holy Spirit the Prophet
[56:11] says that now the church doesn't need a
[56:13] group of intellectuals the church needs
[56:16] a birth the church needs to
[56:18] be born again if the Holy Spirit is
[56:21] going to lead the church then the Holy
[56:23] Spirit will lead the church not
[56:25] according to some ritual but according
[56:28] to the Bible so this is the rules he
[56:31] laid down in the beginning the church
[56:34] needs to miss the baptism the church
[56:37] doesn't need a polishing up that doesn't
[56:39] need a polishing up a better school or
[56:41] in the pulpit a better trans man a
[56:44] better dress congregation it needs a new
[56:47] and new hearts is what the church needs
[56:50] it needs the Holy Spirit it needs you
[56:54] know in this the great unction that
[56:56] changes men and women's life how God
[56:59] promised now he will take the old stony
[57:03] heart it would take the old stony hard
[57:05] out and put a new heart in you then when
[57:09] this happens I'll change he has been
[57:11] made you know a change has been made you
[57:14] know God promised first and where we
[57:17] read that he would take the stony heart
[57:19] out of you and it will give you the
[57:21] heart of flesh you know that way I
[57:23] remember months ago what we said about
[57:25] this about how the Bible says that God
[57:28] would never put a new oil into the oil
[57:30] bottle you know he has first to change
[57:33] the bottle you know why because the
[57:35] batter the old bottle cannot contain the
[57:39] new oil
[57:39] he cannot contain the stimulation the
[57:42] stimulations now that comes with the new
[57:44] oil that's why we see that in Ezekiel
[57:46] where we read verse 26 the Bible says
[57:49] that a new heart also will I give you a
[57:51] new spirit will I put within you and now
[57:55] we take away the stone the heart out of
[57:57] your flesh and I will give you an heart
[57:59] of flesh and then I would put my spirit
[58:03] within you and cause you to walk in my
[58:05] statutes and you shall keep my judgment
[58:09] and do them we know we see that in verse
[58:11] 26 the Bible is first talking you know
[58:14] the Bible is first saying that God will
[58:16] first take away the you know the heart
[58:19] of the heart in the stony heart of us
[58:21] you know it would take that out and then
[58:23] it will put you know it will put first a
[58:26] new heart and a new spirit now you have
[58:29] to know something that a new heart and a
[58:31] new spirit
[58:31] it's not the Holy Spirit that's not the
[58:35] Holy Spirit because if you understand
[58:37] the verse 27 they said that after
[58:39] putting a new heart and a new spirit
[58:40] within you he will now put my spirit
[58:43] verse 27 said that I would put my spirit
[58:46] within you so I was putting my spirit in
[58:49] the new heart that I give you in a new
[58:51] spirit they profit the way he explains
[58:53] it he said that God takes first you know
[58:57] the heart of layout the heart of you
[58:59] know that are sown your heart out of you
[59:01] and then you put a new heart and then in
[59:03] the middle of the new heart it puts a
[59:05] new spirit and then in the middle of the
[59:08] new spirit it puts the new it puts a
[59:10] spirit which is the Holy Spirit you know
[59:13] that's why that comes together with you
[59:15] know this bible scripture that the Bible
[59:17] says that he will never put a new wine
[59:19] to an old bottle you know God had first
[59:22] to change your heart God has first to
[59:24] change your spirit you first was loving
[59:27] you know doing wrong you you didn't want
[59:30] to go to church or you worried about you
[59:32] know that you were doing this wrong you
[59:34] were doing this wrong but God first
[59:36] before he puts his spirit inside of you
[59:38] he has first to change it he has first
[59:41] to change their hearts he has first to
[59:43] give you the heart of flesh has first to
[59:45] change your spirit yes first to give you
[59:47] a spirit that will make you love him yes
[59:49] for us to give you the spirit that will
[59:51] make you I know love your neighbor now
[59:53] gossip not you know literally they love
[59:55] everybody and then after the spirit is
[59:58] important inside of you he would then
[1:00:00] put his spirit you know his spirit
[1:00:02] inside of you that is the Holy Spirit
[1:00:04] and then and then the Holy Spirit that's
[1:00:08] the spirit that we got everything and
[1:00:11] the Prophet compared it to a men's
[1:00:13] spring can I have the the image please
[1:00:16] can I have that image replacing the the
[1:00:19] Prophet compare that spirit a new spirit
[1:00:22] with the mainspring of the watch you
[1:00:24] know if you have mechanical watches you
[1:00:28] know this is how mechanical watches it
[1:00:31] looks inside you know inside that that's
[1:00:33] how it looks so the Prophet compared the
[1:00:36] holy spirit to the mainspring this is
[1:00:39] the mainspring and if you study the
[1:00:41] mechanic behind it behind the mechanical
[1:00:44] watches
[1:00:45] you will see that the mechanical the
[1:00:48] mainspring it's what gives power you
[1:00:51] know it's what gives power to the watch
[1:00:53] it's what you know makes the watch you
[1:00:57] know move and makes the watch you know
[1:00:59] do everything without the mainspring in
[1:01:02] the watch nothing as we work without the
[1:01:05] mainspring in a watch you know you will
[1:01:06] have no time you know that's why you
[1:01:08] will see that after you know the demand
[1:01:10] spring gives power to the watch this in
[1:01:13] our wheels will start moving and you
[1:01:16] know where it'll move one after one and
[1:01:18] you see that these wheels are connected
[1:01:19] and all of them are connected together
[1:01:22] and this is connected you know that's
[1:01:24] the symptom with the Holy Spirit when
[1:01:26] God God will first give you a new heart
[1:01:29] it will give you you know with a new
[1:01:31] heart and it gives you in a new spirit
[1:01:33] and then you will put the mainspring and
[1:01:35] I believe that in the construction of
[1:01:38] the watch you know they don't
[1:01:40] first put the mainspring first this come
[1:01:43] like this comes last you know that we do
[1:01:45] this that we put all the wheels that
[1:01:47] will make sure that all the mechanics we
[1:01:49] you know works together and then that
[1:01:51] will put the men's spring inside of the
[1:01:53] watch so that the mainspring can control
[1:01:55] everything you know you might have also
[1:01:58] us as Christian as you know human body
[1:02:01] you know we also have wheels
[1:02:02] you know those wheels we have them you
[1:02:04] know our five senses you know our wheels
[1:02:07] you know a new heart a new spirit and
[1:02:10] those wheels needs to be controlled or
[1:02:13] this those wheels needs to be powered by
[1:02:15] the Holy Spirit you know the Holy Spirit
[1:02:17] inside of you in the middle of your new
[1:02:20] year of your new spirit will make that
[1:02:22] these wheels give the good hour and give
[1:02:25] the good minutes you know will make that
[1:02:27] these wheels you know that's good it
[1:02:30] will make that these wheels you know
[1:02:31] it's good it will make you the Holy
[1:02:33] Spirit inside of you will make you acts
[1:02:35] good will make you love your brother you
[1:02:38] know will make you you know you know
[1:02:39] sing for God will make you come to
[1:02:41] church you know will make you read your
[1:02:45] Bible will make you pray we make you
[1:02:48] have a good Spirit will give you
[1:02:49] strength we give you victory you know to
[1:02:51] overcome the devil that the men spring
[1:02:54] inside of you the Holy Spirit inside of
[1:02:56] you will change your life completely and
[1:02:58] it
[1:02:59] become a new person you know you will
[1:03:01] first you know you first was an imitator
[1:03:04] you first were an imitator you first
[1:03:06] were in the situation or in a step or in
[1:03:09] a journey that you stopped by imitating
[1:03:11] people but inside of you you still have
[1:03:13] you know this inside of you that you
[1:03:15] know I'm not truly born again yet you
[1:03:18] know I'm not yet where I want to be you
[1:03:20] know I still have the desire of me I see
[1:03:23] have this bad desire of me inside of him
[1:03:25] but once the mainspring is put inside of
[1:03:28] you
[1:03:29] I'm sorry when once the Holy Spirit is
[1:03:31] put inside of you the Holy Spirit not
[1:03:34] will take control of everything the Holy
[1:03:37] Spirit now which I control you know of
[1:03:39] all the you know of the move of your
[1:03:43] heart and all the other move you know of
[1:03:46] me know of your body the Prophet says
[1:03:48] that on the day of Pentecost there was
[1:03:52] 120 new skins lay on the floor now you
[1:03:57] find out that the old skin was cut was
[1:04:00] cast outside but when God came from the
[1:04:03] heavens and filled these new skins they
[1:04:07] got new life and began to bounce all
[1:04:09] over the floor even bounce out of door
[1:04:12] out the door and through the windows
[1:04:16] into the streets new skins with new
[1:04:19] bottles new wine oh holy Oh Holy Ghost
[1:04:24] wine poured out full of life just
[1:04:27] stretching and giving oh brother John I
[1:04:31] don't care what denomination you belong
[1:04:34] to I love you anyhow there you are I
[1:04:37] don't care where you want as 2 and s 3
[1:04:40] and S 5 nice we are brothers
[1:04:43] that's the new skin whether we us
[1:04:46] Assemblies Church of God Foursquare
[1:04:48] whatever we are the new skin stretch
[1:04:51] plumb out and take everything and take
[1:04:54] and taking every brother there is a
[1:04:58] every brother there's around but the old
[1:05:01] by the old one won't do that that's
[1:05:06] right I want I mean in one dude they
[1:05:09] won't do it somehow it's just one doing
[1:05:12] it Sarge
[1:05:13] and said and it will burst you know
[1:05:16] that's what the Holy Spirit does that's
[1:05:18] why the new one does you know the new
[1:05:20] ones take away everything take away all
[1:05:23] our differences you know you see that
[1:05:25] you know in the message that you see
[1:05:27] that these people from this church
[1:05:29] doesn't fellowship with the other
[1:05:30] brother from that church you see that
[1:05:32] these people from this church you know
[1:05:34] because they don't believe the same
[1:05:36] thing or because they don't have the
[1:05:37] same you know roots that don't
[1:05:39] fellowship with the others you see the
[1:05:40] message because this belief in this and
[1:05:43] the other way one don't believe in this
[1:05:45] you know we give ourselves you know the
[1:05:48] authority to say that these people would
[1:05:51] go to hell or you know they don't have
[1:05:52] the truth or you know bury or they're
[1:05:55] not chosen by God or you know whatever
[1:05:57] whatever else we can say the Prophet now
[1:06:00] here is saying that if you have this
[1:06:01] true one inside of you if you have the
[1:06:04] Holy Spirit inside of you it says that I
[1:06:06] don't care about you by your
[1:06:08] denomination I don't care about what you
[1:06:10] believe in this I don't care either you
[1:06:12] want is to nest three days five days I
[1:06:15] don't care whether you believe in the
[1:06:17] second coming or not I don't care what
[1:06:19] you do this or not you know you still my
[1:06:21] friend you still my brother you know the
[1:06:23] Holy Spirit will take away our
[1:06:25] differences and we will only see one
[1:06:28] thing cross inside of you man and the
[1:06:31] new spirit and the new heart is the Holy
[1:06:35] Spirit that will make it that will make
[1:06:37] you stop doing wrong the Prophet says
[1:06:40] that yet you get a new spirit you quit
[1:06:44] drinking
[1:06:44] you quit your drinking you get a new
[1:06:47] spirit your quit lying you get a new
[1:06:50] spirit you can do most anything with the
[1:06:55] spirit but that isn't what God's talking
[1:06:59] about what God is talking about a new
[1:07:01] spirit he said I'll give you now watch I
[1:07:05] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:07:08] why he'd have to give you a new spirit
[1:07:12] to live for him why you couldn't even
[1:07:16] live with yourself with the spirit you
[1:07:19] did have before you couldn't live with
[1:07:22] your neighbor
[1:07:23] you couldn't associate with the next man
[1:07:27] on the next corner you couldn't
[1:07:29] associate with these Christians y-you
[1:07:32] have had an awful spirit so he has to
[1:07:36] give you a new spirit I give you a new
[1:07:39] heart and a new spirit now watch and I
[1:07:42] will put my spirit in you there's the
[1:07:45] did there's the difference I would put
[1:07:47] my spirit in you now hear the Prophet is
[1:07:50] expanding or saying what we said earlier
[1:07:52] that a new spirit I would give to you he
[1:07:55] said that before you had a bad spirit
[1:07:57] that spirit didn't I even want you to
[1:07:59] fellowship with the others
[1:08:01] you know forgot to put his spirit inside
[1:08:03] of you had for us to change that bad
[1:08:05] spirit that you have you know to give
[1:08:07] you first a new spirit that will make
[1:08:09] you love Christ and a new spirit that
[1:08:12] will make you quit drinking a new spirit
[1:08:15] that will make you quit lying a new
[1:08:17] spirit what would that would make you
[1:08:19] quit lasting a new spirit that would
[1:08:21] make you quit you know uh singing
[1:08:24] wordless song and new spirit that will
[1:08:26] make a quick swearing the new spirit
[1:08:29] that will make you quit all the bad
[1:08:31] things and then how will put my spirit
[1:08:33] now here's the thing that we don't have
[1:08:36] to stop by only receiving a new spirit
[1:08:38] we don't only have to stop by receiving
[1:08:41] a new heart and a new spirit you know we
[1:08:43] have to go beyond that but most of the
[1:08:45] time what we do that you know we stop by
[1:08:48] only receiving a new spirit you know you
[1:08:50] see a brother you know after a change
[1:08:52] has been made in the scar you know it
[1:08:54] doesn't smoke anymore it doesn't lie
[1:08:57] anymore it doesn't do it this anymore it
[1:08:59] doesn't do that anymore you know he
[1:09:00] consent himself you know with what he
[1:09:02] has you know instead of going in the
[1:09:05] step where God will not have to put the
[1:09:07] spirit inside of you you know you only
[1:09:09] stop you know with the new spirit that
[1:09:12] you have you only stop with the
[1:09:13] everything the Prophet said that that is
[1:09:15] right by the Bible did not step there
[1:09:17] with the Bible but did not stop there
[1:09:18] the Bible went on saying that I would
[1:09:21] put my spirit inside of you you know
[1:09:24] that spirit that mainspring that will
[1:09:26] make you now do right that would make
[1:09:28] you now you know stop imitating that
[1:09:30] will make everything or any actions that
[1:09:33] will you would do original coming out of
[1:09:37] you you know coming from you know the
[1:09:38] Spirit of God
[1:09:40] the Prophet asked these questions he
[1:09:42] says that why is there so many
[1:09:44] Christians find it so hard to live a
[1:09:47] Christian life he asked that question
[1:09:50] what is it hard you know when when you
[1:09:52] read the when you listen to this sermon
[1:09:54] you see that the Prophet is asking that
[1:09:56] why today you see that somebody said
[1:09:59] that he had an experience with God and
[1:10:00] tomorrow you see him failing what
[1:10:02] there's so many ups and downs in our
[1:10:04] Christian lives why there's so you know
[1:10:06] many things going wrong in our Christian
[1:10:09] lives you know why is it so hard you
[1:10:11] know to find you know a white walk why
[1:10:14] why is it why is it that so many
[1:10:16] Christians find it so hard to live a
[1:10:18] Christian life you know the answer is
[1:10:21] that because they never get to a point
[1:10:23] of living the stage of imitating to a
[1:10:28] personal life with God you know the
[1:10:31] answer is that they never met God
[1:10:32] personally you know they only start by
[1:10:35] imitating cuz that's the thing is that
[1:10:37] when you imitate you know one day you
[1:10:40] would you will find yourself you you
[1:10:42] know one day what is inside of you will
[1:10:44] reveal itself I give an example you know
[1:10:46] I had a friend at work you know he was
[1:10:49] she was cursing and you know she was
[1:10:52] saying those bad words she knows that
[1:10:55] I'm a Christian and she didn't want to
[1:10:57] do it she didn't want to say those words
[1:10:59] before me you know in front of it she
[1:11:00] didn't want to say this cuz she knows
[1:11:02] that I don't like it I'm a Christian and
[1:11:04] she tried to act as if that she doesn't
[1:11:07] say it but when something is inside of
[1:11:10] you and that old serpent is not dead yet
[1:11:13] you know one day you will reveal what
[1:11:15] you are you know it happened to
[1:11:17] something all of a sudden happen and she
[1:11:20] did not control herself and she said it
[1:11:22] you know that made me just say that you
[1:11:24] were not a Christian life is not a life
[1:11:26] that you will try to satisfy somebody a
[1:11:28] Christian life is not a life that you
[1:11:30] were trying to satisfy you know a pastor
[1:11:33] a Christian life is not a life that you
[1:11:35] were trying to satisfy your parents a
[1:11:36] Christian life is not alive that you
[1:11:38] were trying to satisfy your wife or your
[1:11:40] husband a Christian life is a life that
[1:11:42] eats between you and God
[1:11:44] you know something as first to be
[1:11:46] changed inside of you you know no matter
[1:11:48] how good you may act an outside no
[1:11:52] matter how good you may you know
[1:11:53] showed out do you know sure the people
[1:11:55] how are you good you know as long as
[1:11:57] there's something inside of you that is
[1:11:59] not dead yet
[1:12:00] one day that thing will come out one day
[1:12:03] you will reveal your true personality
[1:12:04] you know one day you will reveal who you
[1:12:07] truly are you know that's that's the
[1:12:09] same thing you know because if we
[1:12:11] understand that in this message we have
[1:12:13] too many Pharisees you know Pharisees if
[1:12:16] you read the Bible and you study about
[1:12:18] the Pharisees the Prophet calls them the
[1:12:20] actors people who were acting at the
[1:12:23] outside they were acting as if they were
[1:12:25] Christian but in the inside you know
[1:12:28] they were not following the words you
[1:12:30] know you see people who knows the
[1:12:32] message who knows the Bible who knows
[1:12:34] everything who knows all the
[1:12:35] commandments but inside of them you know
[1:12:38] they don't even follow
[1:12:40] they don't even obey what they say you
[1:12:42] know you see people can you know what
[1:12:44] the Prophet who can quote the Bible can
[1:12:46] call the speaker in Scripture but after
[1:12:49] going out you see the same man living
[1:12:52] about life you see the same man you know
[1:12:54] threatened you know women's you see if
[1:12:56] the same man doing you know things that
[1:12:58] is wrong you know why because he never
[1:13:01] been changed or he never been born again
[1:13:03] he's trying to act you know you see that
[1:13:05] we read Matthew I think chapter 16 verse
[1:13:09] 6 the Bible says Matthew 16 verse 6 this
[1:13:20] is Jesus talking it says that then jesus
[1:13:23] said unto them take heed and beware of
[1:13:27] the leaven of the Pharisees and of the
[1:13:30] Sadducees be aware of this leaven you
[1:13:35] know the leaven if we we go and we
[1:13:37] studied 11 in the Bible we see that 11
[1:13:40] is something that is unpure that's why
[1:13:43] when at the exodus of the children of
[1:13:46] Israel when they wanted to come out you
[1:13:48] know when the angel when the Death Angel
[1:13:51] was going to pass God told them make
[1:13:53] sure to not have the leaven you know in
[1:13:56] your house you know it you know the
[1:13:58] bread without leaven and then after them
[1:14:00] after that I told them that you will do
[1:14:02] seven days without having leaven inside
[1:14:04] of you and eleven is something that
[1:14:07] not pure is something that is seen you
[1:14:09] know consider as seen and Jesus is now
[1:14:11] talking now telling us to be aware to be
[1:14:15] to be aware of this leaven of those
[1:14:18] things that is not pure other words in
[1:14:20] other words that something that is not
[1:14:22] sincere that's what it's called leaven
[1:14:24] and we see that if you want to read you
[1:14:26] see that you will find it in Matthew 23
[1:14:29] verse 25 to 28 you'll find in a Luke
[1:14:33] chapter chapter 12 verse 1 you'll
[1:14:36] finally look 16 14 to 15 you find any
[1:14:39] mark 38 and 40 what Jesus is telling us
[1:14:44] to be aware of the Sadducees and then
[1:14:46] the Sadducees today nowadays is compared
[1:14:49] to those Christians who are externalism
[1:14:52] you know they like to are to show people
[1:14:56] that there are Christian so they you
[1:14:58] know in the outside you know they
[1:15:00] they're Christian but in the inside
[1:15:02] there are now Christians you know when
[1:15:04] they are amongst Christians they behave
[1:15:06] like Christians when they are amongst
[1:15:08] Christian they talk like Christian when
[1:15:10] they are quiet among Christian they walk
[1:15:12] like Christian when they are among like
[1:15:14] Christian they sing like Christian when
[1:15:16] they are among Christian they watch you
[1:15:18] know Christian things but when they are
[1:15:20] you know among the among those people
[1:15:23] you know they do what they do you know
[1:15:26] what other people say in other words to
[1:15:28] say that you know there are hypocrites
[1:15:30] you know those people who never been to
[1:15:33] Christ who never been to Calvary you
[1:15:35] know that's the same thing that you've
[1:15:36] seen in I think in Revelation chapter 3
[1:15:39] you see that in Revelation Bible the
[1:15:41] Bible is talking about loud this year
[1:15:43] saying that God will vomit hey you know
[1:15:47] God would take it out you know God
[1:15:49] because it's not cold is not it's not
[1:15:51] warm and that spirit of their you know
[1:15:53] that verse of the Edition it's not just
[1:15:55] somebody or John thinking about the
[1:15:58] strata verse but it was a real a reality
[1:16:01] you know if you read the Bible or if you
[1:16:03] read the story of Lao Edition you said
[1:16:05] you see that there was in the old time
[1:16:08] you know there were some sickness that
[1:16:11] was healed
[1:16:12] you know by taking hot water or quarter
[1:16:15] or I'm sorry you see that the the the
[1:16:18] the reef
[1:16:20] cuz laude Australia is a river you see
[1:16:24] that our dish was the combination of two
[1:16:26] rivers the river that was in North I
[1:16:29] believe was called and the one that was
[1:16:31] in South was hot and when those rivers
[1:16:34] were coming together the place that
[1:16:36] those rivers were crossing you know that
[1:16:38] was making that was where our dish it
[1:16:41] was that was where you know it was not
[1:16:43] hot it was not cold it was warm
[1:16:45] and then you see that people where it
[1:16:48] were water Bible says that people you
[1:16:49] know that you you think that you you
[1:16:52] reach you think that you dis you that
[1:16:54] you see that people Martian were not
[1:16:56] coming allow initiative to sell their
[1:16:59] stuff to sell their goods you know
[1:17:01] that's why the Bible say this and then
[1:17:04] when the Bible says that you know I will
[1:17:05] vomit you or I would take you out of me
[1:17:08] you see that when people were sick or
[1:17:10] they wanted to take out why they've
[1:17:12] eaten you know that they were drinking
[1:17:15] of this water because the warm water
[1:17:17] actually makes you wanna you know take
[1:17:19] out everything that you yet that you
[1:17:21] ain't you know that we're drinking out
[1:17:23] of the loud dishes water and then that
[1:17:25] will help them you know you know take
[1:17:27] out everything that I wanted to take out
[1:17:29] you know that's the state you know
[1:17:31] that's the kind of state that you know
[1:17:33] that Jesus or God doesn't like then and
[1:17:35] then and that's the same thing with the
[1:17:38] Pharisees you know they do that you and
[1:17:40] I act out good they're trying to you
[1:17:42] know if they in church you see them this
[1:17:44] sweet they come you know you know they
[1:17:46] do things according to the Bible but
[1:17:48] once they're out they changed the change
[1:17:50] they've they now be you know different
[1:17:52] people may be prophets is that the same
[1:17:55] thing he did when he come on earth he
[1:17:58] found the people and the Pharisees and
[1:18:00] so forth after the law what was their
[1:18:04] doing just not sincerity in it at all
[1:18:08] just go ahead and slap and slap you
[1:18:11] through any SAP slap you through any
[1:18:15] other way just as long as they they
[1:18:18] joined the church that's all they needed
[1:18:21] and that's what they want that that's
[1:18:24] what he found
[1:18:25] and that's why he's founding he's
[1:18:28] founding again he's finding again he
[1:18:31] finds the same thing people
[1:18:33] doesn't change so if he sent his program
[1:18:36] and the people disbelieved it it is
[1:18:40] believed that there and they perished
[1:18:43] they believed it they believed it and
[1:18:46] leaved now on those two it's got to be
[1:18:50] the same on this time it's got to be the
[1:18:54] same you know if God sent His Word back
[1:18:56] there when Jesus was on earth you know
[1:18:59] people who believed that lived and
[1:19:01] people who disbelieve they perished he
[1:19:04] has to be the same thing again the
[1:19:06] Prophet says that when Jesus is coming
[1:19:07] again buck now you know is finding the
[1:19:11] same kind of people the same kind of
[1:19:12] Christians you know cause the Spirit
[1:19:15] doesn't die you know he is finding the
[1:19:17] same kind of Christians you know you
[1:19:19] might feel yourself in this room that
[1:19:21] you know that you are one of them you
[1:19:24] might feel yourself in this room that
[1:19:26] you are one of them that you changed

[1:19:50] that you are among them or you are one
[1:19:53] of them

[1:20:02] imitators or to become adaptator
[1:20:04] you know what I don't know if that words
[1:20:07] exist or not you know they just came out
[1:20:09] of my mind you know God doesn't call us
[1:20:12] to be those kind of man God doesn't want
[1:20:15] to call it God calls us to show one
[1:20:17] color and the only color that we needs
[1:20:20] to show is Christ God calls us to show
[1:20:23] Christ to live like God to live like him
[1:20:25] to live that Christ that's why he sent

[1:24:17] something the Prophet says that the Holy
[1:24:19] Spirit inside of you will create
[1:24:20] atmosphere you know will create a
[1:24:23] certain you know a sweet atmosphere that

[1:24:50] I am me you know I'm free I do
[1:24:52] everything I do
[1:24:53] but there's something inside of me that
[1:24:55] is reflecting God's life inside and
[1:24:58] that's the thing that we are needs to
[1:25:00] look for that's the thing that we're all
[1:25:02] needs to have you know to have that
