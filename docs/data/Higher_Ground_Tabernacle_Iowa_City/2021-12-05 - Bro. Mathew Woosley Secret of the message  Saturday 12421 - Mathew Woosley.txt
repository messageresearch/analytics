interpret his own word amen amen we just certainly appreciate it i never thought i'd be in iowa before but here i am if i see you here you are yeah amen so uh i'm not scared amen but i'm glad amen amen so let's bow our hearts before the we go to the word [Music] [Music] and i pray may you come and preach lord the word given that they need today [Music] and lord may i yield unto the holy ghost lord who is my lord and savior and other seniors oh god in jesus christ's name we pray [Music] amen amen but let's uh go to uh luke uh chapter two verse forty if i were to entitle it it would be the secret of the message amen and i believe that we have the greatest thing on earth amen which is the revelation of god's word now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old and they went up to jerusalem after their custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus carried behind in jerusalem and joseph his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company when a day's journey and they sought him among their kinsmen and acquaintances and when they found him not they turned again back uh turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that hurt him were stein is at his understanding in answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorry and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wished ye not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart we descended amen so we see in the scripture that jesus being about 12 years old and the word being young i want to read a quote to you amen uh the and this is brother brown i'm in in the uh message the seed does not air with the shock and this is where i got the title of the message the word yet being young spake for itself and know not that i must be about my father's business the message is the secret message there is the secret of the message now the security message just exactly the father's business what's the father's business exactly could you think of what the father's business was in him to fulfill what isaiah said a virgin shall conceive fulfill what isaiah said again the lame shall leap like a heart right here that's where it was the lamb the lame shall leap like a heart and all these things would take place like like moses like moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet among you it was the father's business to fulfill that word amen so the the secret of the message in jesus day was to fulfill the scripture that pertained to him so the security message projected are completely critically and see what the prophet would say it was a secret secular prophet but yet he was fulfilling that secret it wasn't a secret to him he understood the father's business this is affirmative he didn't come to church playing games he understood the scriptures and he had a wisdom and an understanding that he had the authority to complete and manifest that word and they behooved him to sanctify himself that he will be able to come and manifest that word to us that jesus had a testimony that he always did will please the father amen so therefore we can have that same testimony and everything that we do we can please god amen because i'm about my father's business i'm not about myself i mean i'm not about my my friends or the world but i'm about the father's business and the prophet of god would say at that time their word was young because those are the amen that we must have a a desire and a passion to fulfill god's word amen jesus had a lot of passion in the book of acts it said that his passion was before him in acts chapter 1 verse 3. amen the bible says to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by million many infallible proofs one three acts one three uh act uh antoine appreciate it amen so we recognize that jesus had a desire it was his passion he made it his life's work so what's your business what is your passion [Applause] [Applause] but his life is now coming to me take away all my and the things that control us amen amen to take away our flesh your desires and bring him to subjection to the word first john 2 16. because we have desires wrestle against the word we have desires as men to that wrestles against the spirit combat uh don't love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him john do says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the lust and the pride of life it's not of the father but it is of the world [Music] and the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god about us forever so we have the lust of the flesh we have the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and they come to take away from the father's business it comes to take away my attention and devotion it comes it comes to distract us from our purpose young man of god amen who who know the truth and hold it in righteousness amen that the world amen will try to pervert you and to take away your god-given rights amen and jesus had said i give you the mysteries of the bible for is given unto is given unto you to know the mysteries of the word amen amen amen praise the lord has given unto us to know the mysteries we may walk as sons of god to become the bride of christ to be made aware of these things that we know we now we know that wrestle against flesh and blood so jesus wants to give us the keys to the business this amen amen let's turn to uh uh genesis because we are the children of abraham and the in the message uh the abraham's grace covenant let's turn to genesis 18. now we are children of abraham by faith and we can honestly say that abraham's life would depict the life of the believer today abraham the 18th chapter uh let's verse 16 18 verse 16. this uh says and the man rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way regardless and the lord says shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do hello so god is going to reveal to abraham his his plans seeing that abraham shall surely now listen this is what god knew saying that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him so god had already promised abraham these things because god by predestination knew abraham [Applause] that's why god gave us this message amen in the 13th chapter god called out abraham and then that was a type of his justification in genesis 15 it was a type of abraham sanctification amen and in genesis 17 it was the type of abraham receiving the holy ghost now today the justification and sanctification is not the holy ghost justification it's the work of the holy ghost but it takes an infillion of the holy ghost [Music] our very best is all but vanity uh our very best our the best we can do um all scripture must be fulfilled abraham had prophecies in scripture that pertain to him and god will reveal abraham his secret in you and you will i establish my son in you when i speak the word my life but it tells you to go a little further where are we going we're going to canada that's the holy ghost but you can't stop there if you want the holy ghost you could have went back [Applause] [Applause] has an inheritance but assad also has a tutor amen a servant a son doesn't have amen is that a servant um [Applause] clay and put you on the word [Applause] a revelation of who jesus is the gishes you ate i see that picture i see god don't miss your experience with the living god i thank god for our prophet but i got a greater witness than the prophet muhammad hallelujah amen his spirit bears witness with my spirit that we now are the sons of god man didn't give it to me you can't take it from me baby [Applause] amen amen praise god for god still if you ever experience was with wasn't her husband the one she was with wasn't her husband but he still came to her they wouldn't be calling adultery amen jesus still came to the lowly he came to the lost jesus came to the lord he came to the broken in the in the loneling he lived in new zealand he said this day this scripture [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] knew me before the foundation of the world [Applause] uh [Applause] the love of god that we can become the sons of god abraham had uh the scripture or abraham had prophecy regarding him the lord said i should do this and i should i should do this matter of fact he said i've already done it usually so we recognize that god had already established his covenant with uh with abraham so the prophet of god in genesis 17 he said that that was a type of brother of abraham receiving the holy ghost a quicken abraham's body back into a young man sucking off the paths of el shaddai [Music] the fully breasted one let's look listen listen amen i mean the fully breasted god yeah legitimately second off his strength amen his power suffers his authority not my own let it's the father's business to establish his business god's desire is to manifest himself [Music] are you willing amen prophet god would say in the in the message uh abraham's grace covenant i'm sorry abraham's grace covenant [Music] abraham amen amen so we know that god called abraham by justification and sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost i had it but i lost it he said then what is it now amen to be transformed into a adopted son of god abraham abraham was a type of adopted son of god more than a baptized with the holy ghost blue scale critical of the adoption of the sons of god what shall we do with this abraham was able to speak for god abraham could fulfill the scripture by the spoken word abraham had a relationship father-son with the lord face to face first genesis 18 god came and spoke to abraham [Music] and abraham's in verse 23 it says in abraham junior son of god has a responsibility abraham i don't want to say bargain with god but abraham interceded for lot to god to have mercy abraham um what's the right way to say that the power of the spoken word and god listen to abraham and god did what abraham asked him to do abraham knew what had happened to him secular abraham had boldness but he had courage amen abraham uh when he's joined as with christ amen and abraham could intercede for his his brethren and god had mercy and abraham could uh abraham as a type and an adopted son of god today is a is a type i'm saying that that first adopted the jewish community is also our inheritance today amen but there's a lot of a lot of men in the bible god has called to this purpose have lost their way a lot of men start out on the journey samson amen david amen david david had passions the bible says david had a desire for god he said that first for the living god but david allowed his passion to override the thoughts of god got in trouble for it but god still loved him is [Applause] god's purpose in your life is greater than your own life and your own purpose because god has that desire god calls you in and he spoke to you but have his eye become your desire [Applause] the police they please you to just don't freak the further you get away from god i've been there i've done that you're living and i came back amen amen women amen greatest temptation there ever was money in popularity delilah wanted to know he played [Applause] [Applause] she will take your secret to stay in your glory don't get close run run for your life amen i mean evil is always there run for your life why i mean david said my my enemies are too strong for me that you keep missing me joseph was in part of his wife's bedroom joseph had to run joseph joseph david that's too strong for me as a man greater is he that is in me than that that is in the world amen always providing a way of escape [Applause] i felt dependent amen it takes the holy ghost amen amen delilah wanted to steal the glory of god and she was very successful because it's the father's business that we fulfill all scripture god is doing something in his final hours from the from the altar of the holy ghost amen sorry i hope you got it amen much prayer much prayer jesus spent a lot of time in prayer because your head is staying fellowship with the father father had to he could do nothing except the father first showed him so don't you go out there and try to do something god hasn't showed you you wait on god you stay in prayer you stay in fellowship with the holy with the lord nothing good downtown um in genesis abraham had a name change not only did abraham have a name change he took on a part of his name abram went to abraham abraham elohim elohim put his name on abraham when you become a son of the living god you amen amen you are about his business the wife is about her husband's business business that's why god tells us to do certain things a brother called pastor isaiah today he said that god is doing things for the fellow shoes he was talking about how great and wonderful it is and in my heart i was thinking to myself the sons of god that god is yet doing things [Applause] i found myself in the scripture jesus went through the scrolls and he went through the lines he went to isaiah 61. he said this day [Applause] foreign oh whatever she said for you
