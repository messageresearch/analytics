[0:23] verse 11 lest Satan should get an
[0:25] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[0:27] of his devices
[0:37] so Paul is saying that if in other words
[0:39] he's saying if we if we ignore his
[0:42] devices he's going to take an advantage
[0:44] over
[0:49] us you notice he didn't say device he
[0:51] said devices so the enemy has multiple
[0:54] devices
[1:00] and so this morning we are going to be
[1:02] exposing the devil's
[1:07] devices and you noce Satan does not like
[1:10] to be
[1:12] exposed you know I'll read a quote where
[1:14] the Prophet says he doesn't like this
[1:16] kind of
[1:19] services and we can already see this
[1:22] morning he's already fighting with the
[1:24] mics and all
[1:28] that but one thing we want to let Satan
[1:30] know is that he's going to be exposed
[1:36] anyhow and I want you to pay attention
[1:39] to what I'll be reading a few scripture
[1:41] a lot of scriptures and
[1:45] quotes and and I pray that God gives you
[1:48] the revelation of
[1:50] it let's bow our head one more
[1:54] time Heavenly Father Lord
[1:57] Jesus Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01] I commit the service into your
[2:03] hand father every aspect of the service
[2:06] I give it to you
[2:08] Lord starting with me
[2:11] here to The
[2:13] Interpreter to everyone in the
[2:15] congregation all the way in the back
[2:17] lord
[2:18] Jesus father Lord every Spirit of
[2:22] distraction every Spirit that's going to
[2:24] hinder the
[2:26] service I rebuke it in the name of Jesus
[2:28] Christ
[2:31] Lord I pray that you have your
[2:33] prominence in the
[2:34] service father you made an appointment
[2:37] with us that you will be with us this
[2:38] morning
[2:40] Lord and Lord we take you at your
[2:43] word and we thank you in the name of
[2:45] Jesus Christ
[2:47] amen you may have your
[2:52] seats like I said so the title is for we
[2:54] are not ignorant of his devices
[3:04] and I don't know is the projector
[3:10] working I'll continue by if you can
[3:13] please um keep it
[3:15] up so um Paul is telling us that if we
[3:19] are ignorant of how Satan operates Satan
[3:21] has an advantage of
[3:27] us like for instance if we go to war and
[3:30] your enemy has an atomic weapon but you
[3:32] have a
[3:39] knife and if you go to war with a knife
[3:42] versus someone who has an atomic weapon
[3:44] then he's obviously going to
[3:50] win the prophet says that every country
[3:53] has they have
[3:57] spies why because they we even see that
[4:00] even in in the Book of
[4:03] Joshua they send those
[4:07] pies to go uh to go uh uh check spy the
[4:13] land you know and then some came with a
[4:15] good report and other came with a bad
[4:22] report so we need to know how Satan
[4:25] operates in order for us to also have an
[4:27] advantage over
[4:31] and many times Satan hide Satan likes to
[4:37] hide and brother Bram says that when
[4:39] that's that's when that's why when you
[4:41] have certain sins in your life if you
[4:42] hide the devil you don't confess that
[4:45] demon still has power over
[4:53] you the prophet says uh when you confess
[4:56] your sin it's like those grips those
[4:57] nails that you have the that the has
[5:00] they get
[5:07] cut so he can't hurt you
[5:09] anymore that's that's why the prophet
[5:11] says he's just a
[5:13] bluff making all the noise but he cannot
[5:16] do
[5:18] anything but he takes Revelation to know
[5:21] how Satan
[5:24] operates because the prophet says that
[5:26] it took the seals to be broken in order
[5:29] for us to know the true meaning of the
[5:30] serpent
[5:36] seed Satan he tried to he came in at
[5:40] first in if you read the seals in first
[5:41] se he came in as a white
[5:44] horse a man on a
[5:49] white trying to impersonate the uh Jesus
[5:55] Christ and he he had to take the lamb to
[5:58] open the book to reveal revealed to us
[6:00] that that person was the
[6:07] Antichrist and like I said my subtitle
[6:09] will be the
[6:12] woman so this morning I'll will be
[6:14] talking a lot to the
[6:17] sisters why because the prophet says if
[6:19] you want to know how spiritual a church
[6:21] is look at the women in the
[6:27] church you know let's go to the that
[6:30] that quotes real quick it's the SEC the
[6:32] third
[6:34] [Music]
[6:36] slide um yeah so the the prophet says uh
[6:39] it's the no second slide but like number
[6:43] three by second slide if you go be one
[6:45] more the prophet said if you want to
[6:47] know where the church is standing watch
[6:49] the
[6:53] women watch the morals among the
[6:58] women cu she's a representation of the
[7:03] church when you see the pollution among
[7:05] the women you find the pollution in the
[7:11] church so if we want to know where
[7:13] Higher Ground is standing we just have
[7:15] to look at the sisters in the
[7:23] church because the prophet says the
[7:25] church is a woman
[7:30] so this morning we are pretty much also
[7:33] inspecting the level of spirituality of
[7:35] higher
[7:41] ground ground you know because the
[7:43] prophet also say if you want to know a
[7:44] man the true man's character just look
[7:46] at his
[7:50] wife the choice that a man makes for his
[7:53] wife says a lot about that person
[8:03] amen the pro the prophet says that the
[8:05] bride that a man would choose is going
[8:07] to reflect his
[8:12] character he reflect what in
[8:16] him that's why we need we I mean for all
[8:19] especially for all the single brothers
[8:21] that are here we need to be careful on
[8:23] what choice we need to make
[8:31] it's one thing to come up here and say
[8:32] that you are a
[8:35] Christian but then the choice of a wife
[8:37] that you
[8:40] pick will let us know truly what what
[8:42] what your character
[8:46] is amen amen so we'll see how Satan is
[8:50] working through the
[8:52] woman and he's coming in the
[8:56] church he's com in the church
[9:00] and we also see that uh uh uh Paul said
[9:03] that but if we are ignorant you know of
[9:06] his devices then he has an advantage of
[9:12] us ignorance is the absence of
[9:16] knowledge when you are not knowledgeable
[9:18] about something then you are ignorant of
[9:22] it you know the Bible says that my
[9:25] people perish for lack of knowledge
[9:30] so even God said that my people perish
[9:33] for lack of knowledge I think it's in
[9:34] the book of
[9:37] Hosea lack of
[9:40] knowledge and let's go to proverb
[9:42] chapter
[9:45] 7 where the Bible is talking about a
[9:47] young man who who was void of
[9:56] understanding Proverbs Chapter 7
[10:00] verse
[10:04] 4 says say unto wisdom Thou Art my
[10:09] sister verse four say unto wisdom thou
[10:13] are my sister and call understanding thy
[10:15] King's
[10:22] woman amen so that they may keep thee
[10:26] from the strange woman from The Stranger
[10:29] which flattereth with her
[10:40] words why am I talking about the woman
[10:43] because the prophet says that there are
[10:45] three things that can get a man of God
[10:47] to
[10:52] fall he said it's
[10:55] popularity you know it's women and it's
[10:57] money
[11:00] know and he gave an example Samson it
[11:02] was a woman Del like that got Samson a
[11:05] man of God to
[11:11] fall so the prophet is saying that Satan
[11:14] uses women also as a tool to get men of
[11:17] God to
[11:21] fall the Bible says that the sons of God
[11:24] saw that the daughters of men were fair
[11:26] and took them as wives
[11:30] [Music]
[11:39] so we that's why we need to be careful
[11:41] brothers let's continue so verse
[11:44] proverbs four uh uh seven it says that
[11:47] so that they may keep thee from the
[11:49] strange woman from The Stranger which
[11:51] flattereth with her words
[12:03] so Solomon is saying that wisdom and
[12:06] understanding will preserve you from
[12:08] that from that strange
[12:16] woman for at the window of my house I
[12:19] look through my
[12:22] casement verse
[12:27] 6 verse six is it
[12:36] and verse S and beheld among the simple
[12:39] ones I discern among the youths a young
[12:42] man void of
[12:52] understanding so young
[12:55] Brothers Solomon is talking he saw a
[12:57] young man that was void of
[13:03] understanding you know let's keep
[13:05] reading and passing through the street
[13:07] near her corner and he went the way to
[13:11] her
[13:20] house for the sake of time because it's
[13:22] a lengthy scripture let me skip to verse
[13:28] 24 he says hearken unto me now thereof
[13:31] therefore oh ye children and attend to
[13:34] the words of my mouth verse
[13:44] 24 let not thy heart decline to her ways
[13:48] go not astray in her
[13:55] path for she has cast down many wounds
[13:59] indeed yeah many strong men have been
[14:02] slain by
[14:07] her so you notice it's saying many
[14:10] strong men have been slain by
[14:15] her so it doesn't matter how strong you
[14:18] think you are you need to be careful
[14:20] with a
[14:23] woman especially an ungodly woman
[14:29] verse 27 her house is the way to Hell
[14:32] going down to the chambers of
[14:41] death so if this uh if this woman is
[14:45] such a powerful tool to the hands of
[14:47] Satan then how is he working on
[14:54] her the prophet says the prophet says
[14:56] that an ungodly woman can cast millions
[14:59] of millions of souls to
[15:06] hell that's why in Hollywood in every
[15:09] like all the advertisement the woman is
[15:11] always featured as the main
[15:17] character because that's Satan's
[15:19] greatest weapon especially in this
[15:23] generation it's such a great weapon that
[15:25] the prophet says that the woman is the
[15:27] god of these evil
[15:31] age it's such a grateful weapon that
[15:34] Satan decided to make the woman the God
[15:37] of this
[15:41] age and it takes understanding to
[15:44] escaped that
[15:49] woman in the message marriage and
[15:51] divorce paragraph 121 the prophet
[15:55] says but in the human race it's the
[15:57] woman that's pretty
[16:09] not the
[16:10] man if he is there is something
[16:15] wrong there is crossed up seed
[16:21] somewhere notice the prophet use the
[16:23] word
[16:26] pretty not handsome there's a difference
[16:28] between hands handsome and
[16:30] pretty pretty pretty that's more for
[16:35] women when you see a man that looks so
[16:37] beautiful like a
[16:41] woman the prophet is saying there is
[16:43] something
[16:45] wrong there is crossed up seeds
[16:49] somewhere you know he says originally
[16:52] it's that
[16:54] way why was it done it was it was to
[16:57] deceive by
[17:02] right so the prophet is saying the woman
[17:04] was made a certain way to be a tool of
[17:07] Satan to
[17:11] deceive and he says her designer
[17:19] Satan her designer is Satan and he's
[17:22] still working on her in these last days
[17:29] so Satan is not taking PTO on working on
[17:32] the
[17:34] woman the prophet says that God let
[17:37] Satan design the
[17:43] woman you know and Satan is always
[17:47] featured in
[17:51] beauty and my key word here is that so
[17:54] first you have to understand that your
[17:57] designer is Satan
[18:00] and that he is still working on
[18:03] you when in these last
[18:06] days the prophet didn't say he stopped
[18:11] working and we'll go on and show you how
[18:13] Satan is still operating on the
[18:18] woman and sisters I want you to make the
[18:21] difference between a sister and just a
[18:26] woman so just identify yourself with the
[18:32] word don't say that don't say that I
[18:35] called you something evil or anything
[18:37] like I'm not talking about you I'm
[18:38] talking about the ungodly
[18:44] woman but you are Daughters of
[18:48] God only when you stay with the
[18:53] word but when you want to pattern after
[18:56] God of this evil age then you these
[18:59] quotes apply to
[19:06] you and and and and and and and another
[19:09] thing I want to bring up to you it's not
[19:11] I'm not even addressing you I'm
[19:12] addressing the spirit that's behind
[19:18] you because the prophet says that they
[19:21] have a evil spirit on them but they
[19:23] don't even know
[19:26] it the prophet says when you see women
[19:28] working walking outside with shorts and
[19:31] all that they have a demon that's
[19:33] anointing them but they don't know
[19:39] it the key word says they don't know
[19:42] it's so lack of
[19:48] understanding but now we want the words
[19:50] to expose that that
[19:53] [Music]
[19:55] demon in Psalm chapter 139:14 the Bible
[19:59] says I will praise
[20:04] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[20:21] made I am fearfully and wonderfully
[20:25] made Psalm 139 verse 14
[20:40] sorry maybe next time I'll translate all
[20:42] these words probably that'll make it
[20:45] easier verse
[20:52] 14 you know cuz now we have people they
[20:55] are no longer content of how God created
[21:02] us and that's how Satan is creeping in
[21:05] especially to the woman you showing you
[21:06] that you are not made the way you should
[21:09] be
[21:13] made the prophet says he's gotten into
[21:17] Hollywood and that's setting the
[21:19] standard for our women
[21:22] now
[21:24] Hood but in order instead of us going
[21:27] back to the scripture that says I am
[21:29] fearfully and wonderfully
[21:36] made we are no longer content of how God
[21:39] created
[21:42] us you know the the the the the prophet
[21:45] says that the the beauty of the Lord is
[21:48] in Holiness and
[21:54] power sisters I'm not against you look
[21:58] trying to look pretty that's a normal
[22:00] thing for you to
[22:01] [Music]
[22:03] do the prophet says you were made to be
[22:07] beautiful and he saids it's a normal
[22:09] thing for a woman to want to be
[22:13] beautiful but we want to make sure that
[22:15] we are beautiful according to what the
[22:17] word says beautiful
[22:21] is not according to what Satan calls
[22:27] beautiful the beauty beuty of the Lord
[22:29] is in
[22:32] Holiness when you dress you need to
[22:34] dress in
[22:37] Holiness it's the next quotes uh it's in
[22:39] the message they identify Christ of all
[22:43] age he says not in
[22:46] paint not in
[22:49] paint
[22:56] here and powder and short and everything
[22:59] else that they're trying to wear and do
[23:06] it it's in beauty of the Holiness and
[23:13] righteousness why because we are not of
[23:15] this
[23:18] world this world they have their own
[23:22] God this image this woman that Satan has
[23:25] put them and told them this is your
[23:26] example
[23:31] but we are of of the Heavenly
[23:35] Kingdom and God is telling us that we
[23:38] need to look beautiful according to the
[23:40] in Holiness and
[23:44] righteousness we are from we are from a
[23:47] kingdom that's
[23:51] above you know and Paul is saying also
[23:54] in first Timothy I'm just laying the
[23:55] foundation real quick
[24:00] so in first Timothy 2
[24:05] ver9 in like manner also that women
[24:08] Adorn themselves in modest
[24:19] apparel with shamefastness and
[24:25] sobriety not with broaded hair or gold
[24:28] or pearls or costly
[24:38] array so Timothy is telling us that the
[24:40] woman needs to Adorn himself you need to
[24:43] to look
[24:48] modest and every time you want to buy
[24:51] clothes online just refer back to the
[24:53] scripture does this align with modesty
[25:00] why because you are reflecting the
[25:02] Church of Higher
[25:05] Ground if the world want to see how
[25:07] spiritual Higher Ground is the according
[25:09] to the prophet they should look at the
[25:16] women you know even in the in the vision
[25:19] that the prophet saw of the
[25:22] Bride you know he the prophet almost
[25:26] began crying when he saw he thought
[25:28] thought that the first bride was the
[25:30] bride that he preached
[25:36] about because she was dressed so
[25:42] immodest to the point that the prophet
[25:44] felt like he failed his entire
[25:48] Ministry Brothers our ministry will be a
[25:51] failure if the sisters in this church
[25:53] don't align with the word of God
[25:59] the prophet says that a true uh Revival
[26:02] is getting the trash out of out of your
[26:09] lives in order for the power of God to
[26:11] move in this church we need to get rid
[26:13] of all the
[26:16] trash and when I'm talking don't don't
[26:18] point at a specific sister or brother
[26:20] look at
[26:24] yourself because we all have things that
[26:26] the Lord wants to give R of Our
[26:32] Lives you know if you show the the the
[26:35] stats the next stats to show you that
[26:37] Satan is still working on the woman like
[26:39] the prophet said uh I it's probably not
[26:43] clear enough for you to see but it's
[26:45] showing that um those are what they call
[26:49] um uh bbls like
[26:52] the plastic surgeries
[27:02] like women they are no longer content of
[27:04] how God made them now they want Satan is
[27:07] like I got to make you in a way that's
[27:09] more appealing to to to to get the sons
[27:11] of
[27:19] God so we see that um in
[27:24] 2019 the total procedures for like
[27:27] plastic surgeries were 11
[27:42] Millions 11
[27:45] million and then in 20 and then in 20
[27:49] 2022 it went up to 14
[27:55] Millions what are they doing they're
[27:57] doing Leos suction
[28:00] lios section is when you take a certain
[28:01] F of the body and you put it somewhere
[28:14] else and then what was the number two
[28:17] surgery done in the US breast
[28:19] augmentation
[28:32] you know at first it was 1 million and
[28:34] it went up to 2
[28:35] million and I can share this with you
[28:38] after service why is that because women
[28:41] they are no longer content of how they
[28:43] were
[28:45] created why because Satan has put an
[28:48] image of what an ungodly woman is
[28:53] like and now all the women instead of
[28:56] looking what the word says they should
[28:58] be like they want a pattern after what
[29:00] Satan is giving
[29:06] them if you go to the next two the one
[29:09] after the one it's another not this one
[29:11] the next
[29:13] one this this is a a research that I
[29:16] made and it says with the rise of social
[29:24] media social media bad augmentation has
[29:28] has been T tedly Ted by influencers and
[29:33] celebrities who often refute any claims
[29:36] of getting work work
[29:44] done there's influencers and
[29:51] celebrities you see how Satan is
[29:55] evolving the prophet says that first he
[29:57] began with television
[29:59] Vision I was reading a quote this
[30:01] morning the prophet says that the devil
[30:03] was like I know how I'll get them I'll
[30:05] set Television right in their
[30:12] house and what is he doing with
[30:14] television he's giving you his
[30:17] program but the prophet said Satan
[30:19] always keeps
[30:22] evolving he's still
[30:24] working now now he created social media
[30:30] now it's no longer just at home on the
[30:32] big screen now it's on your
[30:36] phones and what is he doing he setting
[30:38] what the world we call
[30:45] Stars a star is a reflection of a
[30:51] light you know the star reflects the
[30:54] light of the
[30:56] Sun and we also know that Satan also was
[31:00] was was was a
[31:04] star and there were stars in heaven but
[31:07] those stars were
[31:12] Fallen brother bam says that the spirit
[31:14] in order for a spirit to work they need
[31:16] a human body in order to dwell
[31:24] in and Satan is getting those stars like
[31:27] the Kardashian
[31:31] Clan they said notably notably members
[31:34] of the Kardashian Clan have famously
[31:37] contributed to the procedure's
[31:39] popularity with their hourglass
[31:49] figures what they call is what they call
[31:52] like when a woman has a shape of like a
[31:53] they call it a shape of a Coca-Cola
[31:55] bottle
[31:56] [Music]
[32:02] and
[32:05] so it says that bbls became more popular
[32:09] in the US in the middle of the last
[32:12] [Music]
[32:21] decade the Society of plastic surgeons
[32:24] called 2015 another year of the rear and
[32:33] so in 2015 there were bad o procedures
[32:36] such as such as lift implant performed
[32:40] every 30
[32:47] minutes coincidently 2015 was the year
[32:50] after Kim Kardashian in famous um
[32:53] internet breaking cover of paper
[32:56] magazines coinci
[33:02] and in the in the cover magazine she was
[33:04] showing her
[33:08] behind and I'll read what this one young
[33:10] woman says her name was
[33:13] Brian she said Brian said that as a
[33:16] young black teen in the late
[33:22] 90s no in the late 90s and early 2000s
[33:28] Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez were the
[33:30] women of the
[33:34] hour their bodies were perceived as the
[33:37] ideal pausing as a star contrast to the
[33:41] mainstream culture of
[33:48] flatb Brian felt like she lacked an
[33:51] hourglass figure and wanted a natural
[33:53] looking BBL to feel more
[33:56] womanly Brian
[34:01] so in order for her to feel more womanly
[34:03] she had to look like beyon or Jennifer
[34:12] Lopez this was just talking about the
[34:15] influence of those
[34:18] celebrities the influence of social
[34:22] media and we have a lot of young
[34:24] daughter young sisters here in the
[34:26] church
[34:28] unfortunately who patterns after after
[34:32] Hollywood
[34:34] too and sometimes it can be an
[34:36] unconscious things you're not trying to
[34:38] purposely pattern after them but it's
[34:40] just the world that we're living
[34:45] in but I'm telling you it's the devil
[34:48] that's working on the
[34:51] woman why the prophet says to deceive
[34:56] by to deceive who to deceives the sons
[35:00] of
[35:01] God when the prophet says in these last
[35:05] days that's one of the signs of the
[35:08] return of the
[35:09] Lord the prophet says women be becoming
[35:12] more
[35:15] prettier because Satan understand that
[35:17] his time is running
[35:20] out and he's working over time to try to
[35:23] deceive as many sons of God as possible
[35:28] you know in the message
[35:31] influence the prophet
[35:33] says it's become a joking and a carry on
[35:37] Hollywood glamour
[35:43] now Hollywood through
[35:47] television has took the pulpit
[35:54] over our women has bowed to the goddess
[35:58] of fashion of
[36:05] Hollywood the Hollywood then the pulpit
[36:08] got into Hollywood through
[36:16] singers and so forth talented
[36:21] men oh how a shrewd man the devil
[36:26] is so you noce the devil he takes those
[36:29] people that have a lot of
[36:33] talent you know the beyon of the
[36:36] world uh Elvis
[36:39] Presley those are people that were given
[36:41] God given
[36:44] talent but unfortunately they sold that
[36:47] talent to the
[36:49] devil why to carry out his
[36:53] agenda to to get the sons of God to fall
[37:00] and the prophecy say our women not their
[37:02] women but our women has bowed to the
[37:04] goddess of
[37:12] fashion back I'm like if you do your
[37:15] research back back in the days women
[37:17] used to not be wearing tight tight
[37:19] fitting
[37:20] [Music]
[37:23] clothes the prophet has talked so many
[37:25] times against Kennedy's wives
[37:30] saying that all the women were looking
[37:32] at her as an example
[37:36] now so the prophet saying Satan always
[37:39] used one person that he puts there as a
[37:41] figure and everybody now is looking
[37:43] that's my
[37:49] example and with the coming of Hollywood
[37:52] women start wearing tight fitting
[37:54] clothes
[37:58] and unfortunately we even see that in
[38:00] the
[38:02] church we should let the world copy the
[38:04] world but we Christians shouldn't copy
[38:06] the
[38:08] world why because the prophet says that
[38:10] our kingdom is from
[38:13] above we have a kingdom that's higher
[38:16] than what this world can
[38:19] offer and remember that the Bible says
[38:22] that you will respond for adultery with
[38:25] the man that uh that lost it after you
[38:33] when you wear those tight fing clothes
[38:35] you yourself you know that those clothes
[38:37] are very
[38:42] tight and especially with the African
[38:46] wom they built a different
[38:50] way when you wear those tight fitting
[38:55] clothes you are committing a you you're
[38:57] going to respond for adultery with the
[38:59] man that's going to all
[39:04] us even in the
[39:06] church there is a quote I don't know if
[39:08] I have it in my notes
[39:10] Here the prophet is saying that how when
[39:12] you see a woman walking in the church
[39:14] twisting with tight Feit and
[39:19] clothes and he says everybody turns to
[39:22] look at her even the preacher
[39:27] it disrupts the
[39:30] service so if the way you dress can
[39:33] disrupt the service this
[39:38] morning I think I might have said that
[39:40] in the morning especially for the
[39:41] brother sitting in the
[39:43] back you the sister sitting in the front
[39:46] with tight Feit and
[39:49] clothes we have so many battles out
[39:52] there in the
[39:54] world why do we have to come fight
[39:56] battles in the church
[40:00] those are the things we need to worry
[40:01] outside but not in the Church of the
[40:03] Living
[40:05] God you know we are supposed to be a
[40:09] family we are supposed to be helping
[40:11] each
[40:13] others sisters you are not helping the
[40:17] brothers because you just make them
[40:20] having tougher
[40:23] battles now instead of PR singing
[40:26] nothing but the blood got to worry I
[40:28] don't want to I don't want to look
[40:32] down what is that it's the
[40:39] devil the the prophet says
[40:42] that the woman is a nice
[40:46] woman I don't say she's
[40:50] demoralized but the thing of it is there
[40:52] is an honary filthy Spirit that's on her
[40:59] it's making her do that but she don't
[41:01] know
[41:04] it he says you are
[41:08] pretty but if you haven't got the Holy
[41:10] Spirit there to protect those
[41:15] morals you you would have been better to
[41:18] be so ugly nobody would have even looked
[41:20] at you and went to
[41:22] [Music]
[41:23] heaven so he saying you are pretty
[41:26] that's a good to be pretty but you need
[41:29] the Holy Spirit in order for you to use
[41:31] that prettiness in a good
[41:34] way because he says that if you don't
[41:36] have the Holy Spirit and you are
[41:41] pretty the prophet said it would even be
[41:43] better for you to be
[41:46] ugly that is a strong
[41:48] statement beauty is
[41:52] deceiving beauty is
[41:56] vain it's it's a good thing for you
[41:58] sisters to be
[42:00] beautiful but what do you call
[42:03] Beautiful do you call beautiful what
[42:05] Hollywood calls
[42:07] beautiful or do you call beautiful what
[42:10] the word calls
[42:12] beautiful the bride of
[42:15] Christ will not pattern after the
[42:18] world the bride of Christ will be the
[42:23] word the bride of Christ will say Amen
[42:25] to the word
[42:28] the Bri brother brother says that she
[42:31] will be just like
[42:36] him you are the reflection of this
[42:41] church and and then God had to give you
[42:43] that responsibility he did not let man
[42:46] be a
[42:50] reflection give you sisters to reflect
[42:53] your
[42:55] husband to reflect this
[42:58] church so if you truly love your
[43:01] husband you don't want to reflect him in
[43:04] a bad
[43:06] way because according to the prophet
[43:08] don't look at the man just look at the
[43:17] wife you know um you know the prophet
[43:20] says the girls and the young ladies they
[43:22] pattern after Hollywood
[43:29] I'm just going to skip
[43:31] this and I'll read this one the prophet
[43:33] says the invasion is
[43:39] on it's sweeping from house to
[43:43] house from place to
[43:46] place from church to
[43:50] church from man to
[43:53] man Brothers The Invasion is on
[43:58] let's not close our eyes and being
[43:59] ignorant of
[44:01] it because it's coming to your
[44:04] house because it's going from house to
[44:07] house and if you are
[44:10] blind then you let that devil creep into
[44:13] your house without even recognizing that
[44:18] it's and I was listening to another
[44:20] message this
[44:22] morning where the Prophet says it's it's
[44:24] actually not the woman's fault it's the
[44:26] man's fault
[44:30] especially for married
[44:34] couples because the prophet says you
[44:36] were to be the ruler of your
[44:41] house you know let me just read that
[44:43] real quick here uh so you know I'm
[44:44] taking it from the prophet I think I
[44:46] heard it if you go to the message it's
[44:48] not on the slides but if you go to the
[44:49] message painted face
[44:52] Jezebel paragraph 27
[44:59] he says but but you little weekly
[45:04] men I am ashamed of you as Christian
[45:11] brothers that we let your wife do such a
[45:14] thing as
[45:16] that he shows what you are made out
[45:20] of he says now women you ought to say
[45:25] Amen after fasting at you like that cuz
[45:29] he is the
[45:30] ruler he says you ought to say amen
[45:33] after I fasted you like that because the
[45:35] man is the
[45:40] ruler he said he said that's right the
[45:43] way he let you live it's his
[45:48] fault and God is going to hold him
[45:51] responsible for
[45:55] it if you a enough to take up and put
[45:58] your own house in
[46:03] order say God be merciful to
[46:08] you cuz the Bible said in the very
[46:11] beginning that he shall rule over
[46:17] thee and the prophet says now sees not a
[46:20] doormat
[46:23] now she is your sweetheart
[46:30] so there's a certain way you also talk
[46:31] to your wife about how she needs to
[46:34] dress uh there's a certain way you talk
[46:37] to your wife about how she needs to
[46:40] dress the prophet says this is how you
[46:42] do it you should sit down and talk to
[46:47] her and reason it with
[46:50] her what does reason mean that means you
[46:52] also give your partner room to explain
[46:54] herself
[47:00] wife this is what the word says what do
[47:01] you think
[47:02] about let her speak
[47:05] to and tell her and read the Bible don't
[47:09] just tell her it's wrong but show her
[47:10] where it's
[47:11] [Music]
[47:14] wrong and the most important thing that
[47:16] people forget the prophet said and pray
[47:21] together so after today's sermon when
[47:24] you go home you talk to your wife it's
[47:27] just you need to pray
[47:32] together because why do you need to pray
[47:34] because the the war that we fighting is
[47:37] not against flesh and blood but it's
[47:38] against
[47:43] principalities she's anointed by demons
[47:46] without knowing
[47:49] it in order for those demons to go you
[47:51] need to pray
[47:57] amen amen so the prophet is saying the
[48:00] invasion is on is going from house to
[48:07] house he said what is it it's the
[48:11] devil it's the devil The
[48:15] Invasion he swept into this nation like
[48:18] a roaring
[48:22] lion you know he sat down there in the
[48:25] best place they had in Holly
[48:31] and what did he say he said I can't get
[48:33] the movies here until the television
[48:35] comes
[48:44] on so Satan is sitting in
[48:49] Hollywood and how is he doing the
[48:51] prophet saying he's using
[48:54] television nowaday he's even using
[48:56] social media
[48:58] you know I was reading on the Ser I was
[49:00] working on a sermon called the the word
[49:10] diet where the Prophet says you be you
[49:13] what you feed on says a lot about what
[49:15] you
[49:18] are if you he say if you constantly feed
[49:21] on those worldly music those bad movies
[49:24] he says a lot about what you are
[49:30] Satan has placed himself in
[49:33] Hollywood and through those movies you
[49:35] are constantly feeding on
[49:42] him and what and there's a say that says
[49:44] you become what you
[49:47] eat the more you feed on
[49:49] Satan you become like
[49:52] Satan but the more you feed on the word
[49:55] you become the
[49:59] word and and we have to know that it's
[50:02] only one thing that can expose
[50:06] Satan it's the word of
[50:09] God that's why I'm reading all this
[50:11] because I I could just be skipping but I
[50:13] want you to if you can take notes and
[50:15] you go home and you also study
[50:20] that because these things are very
[50:24] important you know we we need to we need
[50:26] to clean the
[50:28] church we need to clean our
[50:31] houses because we want God to be
[50:36] welcome the prophet Compares a life full
[50:39] of sin to like a toilet that's that is
[50:42] so
[50:48] stinking so imagine you inviting Christ
[50:51] into your house but your house is
[50:52] stinking
[50:57] and Christ is just there the whole time
[50:58] like so
[51:02] uncomfortable so he said let's clean
[51:04] let's clean that trash out of our
[51:09] Lives now I'm going to switch to a
[51:11] different aspect of
[51:13] it I will talk about the high heels
[51:18] shoes and I will show in the
[51:22] scripture and what the prophet also says
[51:24] about
[51:25] it and again if you can take notes that
[51:28] will actually be
[51:31] nice no if you can take notes that will
[51:33] be a nice
[51:35] thing let's go to the book of Isaiah
[51:38] chapter 3: 16
[52:09] chapter three if you go to chapter three
[52:12] is
[52:15] verse so the Bible says moreover the
[52:20] Lord saith because the daughters of Zion
[52:23] are howdy and walk with straight forth
[52:27] necks and want on eyes walking and
[52:30] mincing as they go and making a tinkling
[52:34] with their feet
[52:57] yeah so you have to understand that the
[52:59] prophet says that prophets back in the
[53:01] days they only had to use the words that
[53:03] were available to them in their
[53:09] dictionaries for instance if you go to
[53:12] the the N chapter 2:4 the Bible says the
[53:16] Chariots shall rage in the streets they
[53:19] shall jle one against another in Broad
[53:22] ways
[53:26] [Music]
[53:33] the Chariots shall rage in the
[53:39] streets they shall just to one against
[53:41] another just means like to bump against
[53:44] each
[53:45] other in the broad
[53:48] ways they shall seem like
[53:52] torches and they shall run like the
[53:55] lightings
[54:02] the prophet says that n was talking
[54:04] about modern day
[54:08] cars but he didn't know how to call them
[54:10] like for instance the prophet Isaiah
[54:12] that say that the Jews will get back on
[54:14] the wings of an
[54:16] [Music]
[54:23] eagle you know so he didn't he didn't
[54:26] know that those things will be called an
[54:27] airplane he just used
[54:29] eagle or bird
[54:32] sorry and naom is also talking about the
[54:35] Chariots but in other way the prophet is
[54:37] telling us this is the description of a
[54:44] car so why did I say all that to show
[54:46] you that Isaiah also he's talking about
[54:49] something else here but he's just using
[54:51] what the words he could use during his
[54:53] time
[54:59] so let's let's actually let's go into
[55:02] details about this verse 16 go back to
[55:05] the previous
[55:07] verse so three yeah so it says moreover
[55:10] the Lord says because the daughters of
[55:13] Zion are
[55:16] howdy
[55:18] says yeah because the daughter because
[55:21] the daughters of Zion says that they are
[55:24] howy
[55:43] 316 so in French he even use the better
[55:46] word he even says
[55:49] or but in English is used the word
[55:53] howy and if you go two slides after that
[55:56] the definition of how it means to
[55:58] bloodly and dis disdainfully
[56:03] [Music]
[56:11] proud having or showing an attitude of
[56:15] superiority and contempt for people or
[56:18] things perceived to be inferior
[56:26] show so whatever these Daughters of Zion
[56:29] there were something that they were
[56:30] wearing that was making them feel
[56:35] Superior Wasing them they were they
[56:41] were and the prophet says and they walk
[56:44] I mean the Bible says they walk with
[56:45] stretch forth necks and want
[56:52] eyes so they had something was changed
[56:55] about them the word the prophet used the
[56:57] word pitched
[57:00] over so their neck was uh stretched
[57:12] forth and then walking and mincing as
[57:16] they
[57:21] go no no uh it's
[57:37] so the French translation is kind of
[57:39] missing a few words to like it's not as
[57:42] detail as the English
[57:45] translation but we stick with the
[57:47] version that the prophet
[57:50] used because the prophet preach on this
[57:53] verse as well he says walking and means
[57:56] sing as as they
[58:02] go exact that's the word so what is what
[58:06] is the word what does mincing mean can
[58:08] you go to the definition of the word
[58:10] [Music]
[58:13] mincing uh go a few slides
[58:20] after it's like the third one after that
[58:26] okay I'll continue so meaning means it
[58:29] occurs the it says it occurs in the
[58:32] prophets description of the behavior of
[58:34] the daughters of
[58:38] [Music]
[58:44] Jerusalem the Hebrew word as well as the
[58:47] AR Arabic uh refers to the taking small
[58:50] steps and quick
[58:53] steps Arabic
[58:59] the affected PA of a coish
[59:09] woman the way a coish woman works that's
[59:13] the meaning makes her way walk the same
[59:15] way and it says it's like the modern
[59:17] practice of swaying the body in walk
[59:26] so these Daughters of Zion were wearing
[59:28] things that were making their body uh uh
[59:31] uh sway in a certain
[59:39] way so it was a normal normal shoes that
[59:43] were making them do
[59:47] that and you see that he says that he
[59:49] was it was making a tinkling with their
[59:52] feet
[59:56] have you ever noticed when a woman wears
[59:58] a high heel suit in a place where it's
[1:00:00] so quiet in a pavement
[1:00:06] somewhere tinkling with the feet
[1:00:12] that's what Isaiah
[1:00:15] saw and the prophet I I'll read the
[1:00:18] quotes in in a short
[1:00:22] here so walking and meaning they go so
[1:00:27] there's just something I don't know
[1:00:28] women you you maybe you can attest to
[1:00:30] this but there's something about when
[1:00:31] you
[1:00:33] were high heel shoes you just feel it
[1:00:35] gives you that certain
[1:00:39] confidence that certain Pride about
[1:00:41] yourself it just makes you prideful it's
[1:00:43] the spirit that on
[1:00:49] it
[1:00:51] and the let's let's see where the
[1:00:53] Prophet refers to the scripture again
[1:00:55] let's go to the mage is the Kinsman
[1:00:56] redeem Redeemer it's a quote after
[1:01:02] this the prophet says a woman that's
[1:01:05] beautiful that beauty will fade just as
[1:01:06] sure as you give it a few
[1:01:12] years maybe today she's twisting down
[1:01:15] the street some little half-dressed
[1:01:16] woman sending more souls to Hell than
[1:01:19] all the B rooms in the
[1:01:24] country this is what I said earlier like
[1:01:27] a Godly woman can send he's sending more
[1:01:29] souls to Hell than all the barrooms in
[1:01:32] the country one
[1:01:40] woman she'll twist herself down the
[1:01:43] street thinking she is
[1:01:50] something the prophet says as the Bible
[1:01:52] says they'll have stretch out necks
[1:01:59] one
[1:02:03] Mining and the prophet says that means
[1:02:05] twisting as they
[1:02:10] go so the prophet agrees with the
[1:02:12] definition we just read that mining
[1:02:13] means that they are twisting as they are
[1:02:24] walking yeah yeah that's the word right
[1:02:29] so I'm just going to skip a few because
[1:02:31] I'm running out of
[1:02:33] time
[1:02:37] um okay let's go to the message it is
[1:02:39] the rising of the sun we're still
[1:02:41] talking about the high heels let's see
[1:02:43] what the prophet actually says about
[1:02:45] it uh in the message it is the rising of
[1:02:48] the sun I think it's uh if you keep
[1:02:50] going if you yeah there we
[1:02:52] go it's going to be a lengthy quotes but
[1:02:54] pay close attention to this is very
[1:02:57] important you think that those high
[1:02:59] heels oh it's just something small but
[1:03:01] they can lead you to
[1:03:04] hell because disobeying the word of the
[1:03:08] Prophet The Prophet says uh my own
[1:03:11] mother she's gone on
[1:03:14] now she was a very oldd
[1:03:19] woman you know about half in Indian she
[1:03:22] was odd
[1:03:28] she was a person that didn't
[1:03:32] dream she would only have four or five
[1:03:34] dreams all over her
[1:03:37] life but every time she dreamed the
[1:03:39] dream it was
[1:03:42] true she had a dream and it was
[1:03:47] true he says I remember one time when I
[1:03:51] first started preaching many years ago
[1:03:58] I was preaching right here at this
[1:04:01] church and she dreamed a dream that I
[1:04:04] was standing here by the side of three
[1:04:10] steps and I was standing preaching to
[1:04:13] everybody that they must walk up these
[1:04:15] three steps before they hit the
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:23] highway so the prophet in that dream is
[1:04:25] like there is a highway this is the
[1:04:27] highway but in order to get in the
[1:04:28] highway there are three
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:36] steps and on the highway is a little
[1:04:40] pearly like white
[1:04:45] line so there is a highway but in the
[1:04:48] highway there is a a little white line
[1:04:51] that narrow way
[1:04:56] and he says the line runs right into the
[1:04:59] doors of
[1:05:05] Heaven and the Pearl had been stretched
[1:05:08] out to the top of the steps so let's say
[1:05:10] for instance so Heaven is on the wall
[1:05:14] there and all this is the
[1:05:17] highway but in the middle there's a line
[1:05:20] a small line that's going from Heaven
[1:05:22] straight to the to those three steps
[1:05:28] so the prophet was saying in order to
[1:05:29] even be on your way to heaven you got to
[1:05:31] go through those three steps
[1:05:35] first and he says if that am my message
[1:05:39] exactly
[1:05:40] today if that that is not my message
[1:05:43] exactly
[1:05:45] today
[1:05:47] justification
[1:05:49] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:52] Ghost and I was saying that a person has
[1:05:54] to come by this three
[1:05:59] steps to be able to walk the
[1:06:03] highway and he says there was a lady
[1:06:06] that came
[1:06:08] by now you know what kind of shoes
[1:06:11] people were 35 years
[1:06:15] ago there was a lady come by and had on
[1:06:18] Great Big pair like they were
[1:06:24] today Spike heel
[1:06:27] shoes
[1:06:29] the that that woman was wearing Spike
[1:06:32] heeled shoes and she come by and I said
[1:06:35] wait a minute
[1:06:40] sister he says you can't walk the
[1:06:42] highway with
[1:06:47] that you can't do
[1:06:50] that the prophet is saying you cannot
[1:06:52] walk in the highway to Heaven with those
[1:06:54] high he
[1:06:58] and what did the lady said and she said
[1:07:01] ah she said looked around at the right
[1:07:03] of the women and say don't believe
[1:07:10] him he is a mad
[1:07:13] man so this morning I'm telling you you
[1:07:15] cannot be walking on your way to heaven
[1:07:17] with those high heel shoes you will fall
[1:07:19] eventually but it depend you either take
[1:07:22] the attitude of this woman or you take
[1:07:24] the attitude of The Godly
[1:07:31] woman because everything I've told you
[1:07:34] today I took it from the prophet
[1:07:41] himself and he says don't believe him
[1:07:43] he's a mad
[1:07:45] man I'll show you I can be justified
[1:07:49] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:07:51] Ghost and still walk that
[1:07:56] so in another way say I can show you
[1:07:58] that I can't go to heaven wearing these
[1:08:02] shoes I can't get the Holy Ghost I can't
[1:08:04] get justification
[1:08:06] sanctification don't believe that man
[1:08:08] he's
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:13] mad and you know this Prophet says I
[1:08:15] just let her
[1:08:18] go I couldn't do no more about
[1:08:21] it sisters they get to a point where if
[1:08:24] the word has been said so time after
[1:08:26] time and you don't listen he'll just let
[1:08:28] you
[1:08:34] go he says I couldn't stop
[1:08:37] her that's don't ever get to that place
[1:08:40] where the word cannot stop you
[1:08:45] anymore the prophet says that God is not
[1:08:47] going to keep knocking on your door time
[1:08:50] there will be a time that will be his
[1:08:51] last time to knock at your door
[1:08:58] and she jumped up on the
[1:09:02] highway she looked back at the sister
[1:09:05] and said see I told
[1:09:09] you so she was able to get on the
[1:09:13] highway but it's not about how you start
[1:09:15] it's how you
[1:09:18] finish many people have studied have
[1:09:20] studied they gotten Justified satified
[1:09:22] but they didn't go all the way to the
[1:09:24] baptism of the
[1:09:28] there will be many people that say have
[1:09:29] I not preached in your name have I not
[1:09:31] healed at your name but Jesus will say
[1:09:33] depart from me because I never knew
[1:09:38] you who are those people those people
[1:09:40] that ignored the the the word of the
[1:09:43] prophet of the
[1:09:47] age she thought she knew better than the
[1:09:53] prophet always that prideful spirit that
[1:09:55] anoints anoints those kindful
[1:10:00] women see I told
[1:10:03] you and he says you know as the Bible
[1:10:06] said in Isaiah 5th chapter that they
[1:10:08] would have outstretch
[1:10:14] necks the prophet says they have
[1:10:19] to why because they are pitched
[1:10:23] over so if you can go to par uh the
[1:10:27] slide 42 I will show you what what does
[1:10:29] the prophet means that they are peached
[1:10:31] Peach is like they have been
[1:10:38] changed so you can see there's a
[1:10:41] difference this is a me on the left it's
[1:10:42] a woman without high heels right is a
[1:10:44] woman with
[1:10:50] heels high heels actually highlight the
[1:10:54] curves of the
[1:11:02] woman if you notice it's actually
[1:11:05] highlighting the breast the hip the the
[1:11:08] the um uh the the the breast and
[1:11:11] especially the
[1:11:16] behind go to the next one
[1:11:19] again that's another image pitched over
[1:11:22] she's been changed this is the straight
[1:11:24] woman but this heels are making her
[1:11:26] peached she's her form is
[1:11:30] changed well I go to the next
[1:11:35] one how is so normally we are this is z
[1:11:39] degrees I mean uh uh yes 90° I
[1:11:45] guess so when when you wear high
[1:11:50] heels you supposed to kind of lean
[1:11:52] forward as if but according to the laws
[1:11:54] of gravity gravity you are supposed to
[1:12:00] fall if you wear the high heels you you
[1:12:03] you're leaning as if you were about to
[1:12:07] fall that's why we have to now we have
[1:12:10] to deform to pit the body and then you
[1:12:13] are like
[1:12:16] this and then your breast is coming
[1:12:19] forth and your behind is going
[1:12:22] out that's why the prophet says they
[1:12:24] have been peached this is you are
[1:12:26] peached
[1:12:31] over you are the devil Satan is
[1:12:34] designing the
[1:12:41] woman amen let's go back to that course
[1:12:43] I was reading earlier preached
[1:12:46] over you know so meaning and then he
[1:12:50] says they have
[1:12:52] to they have to twist
[1:12:58] meaning as they
[1:13:02] go Prophet now interpret says making a
[1:13:05] tinkling with their
[1:13:09] heels who are those the daughters of
[1:13:11] Zion in the last
[1:13:16] day we are singing We Are Mar into
[1:13:21] Z but you are not going to reach Zion if
[1:13:25] you keep wearing those high
[1:13:29] heels because you will
[1:13:31] fall let's continue the story The
[1:13:33] Prophet says again the next quote so and
[1:13:35] she started up the
[1:13:40] highway just as hard as she could
[1:13:44] run and after a while the road got
[1:13:47] narrower and
[1:13:53] narrower sister reing meaning like that
[1:13:57] and off she
[1:14:01] went and mother said the horriblest
[1:14:04] screams that I ever heard in my life was
[1:14:06] that woman falling into those flames and
[1:14:09] smoke going down like
[1:14:17] that and said I turned around and said
[1:14:23] see the prophet she she just obeyed
[1:14:27] everything but one
[1:14:32] word everything by one
[1:14:41] word and she failed
[1:14:45] it the prophet says and I said she I
[1:14:47] said see she would have went on in all
[1:14:50] right but she failed to listen
[1:14:55] fa to listen to to telling her what was
[1:15:01] ahead okay and I'll end with this um uh
[1:15:05] this one quote where the Prophet is
[1:15:07] talking also about the prophet also saw
[1:15:09] another
[1:15:12] woman but this wasn't the vision of the
[1:15:17] Bride he saw two women two w two
[1:15:23] Brides the Godly
[1:15:27] bride and the Bride of
[1:15:31] Satan now I want you when you read this
[1:15:34] identify yourself what are you feeding
[1:15:38] with let's read that let's read that
[1:15:40] question birth pains paragraph
[1:15:46] 205 and I was to have a preview of the
[1:15:49] church
[1:15:56] and I was taken by someone who I could
[1:15:58] not
[1:16:01] see I was set up on like a
[1:16:06] stand and I heard the sweetest music I
[1:16:10] ever
[1:16:12] heard and I looked coming and a bunch of
[1:16:16] little
[1:16:20] ladies about looked to be some age
[1:16:23] around 28 18
[1:16:28] 20 and they all had they all had long
[1:16:34] hair and was fixed in different dresses
[1:16:37] type of dresses thank
[1:16:40] you they were marching just as perfectly
[1:16:43] in step with the music as it could
[1:16:48] be and they went from my left going
[1:16:51] around this way
[1:16:57] so this is he's talking about the good
[1:17:03] bride now in the next paragraph he says
[1:17:07] then I heard a rock and roll band
[1:17:13] coming so notice that music is also very
[1:17:18] important because a sweet he said a
[1:17:20] sweet music was accompanying the Bride
[1:17:22] of Jesus Christ
[1:17:27] the Bride of Satan
[1:17:29] was forign by rock and roll band
[1:17:37] coming so even in the church we need to
[1:17:39] be careful what kind of music we play
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] we at home what kind of listen we listen
[1:17:47] to Because those those music also the
[1:17:51] the King
[1:17:53] Nebuchadnezzar when he wanted to the
[1:17:56] people to worship the the the the
[1:18:00] idol the Bible say the first step was to
[1:18:03] play music
[1:18:06] first so I don't know but there is
[1:18:08] something about music that even when the
[1:18:10] prophet saw that Vision music was
[1:18:12] accompanying the the two
[1:18:18] brides and when I looked over to my
[1:18:21] right side coming up this way here come
[1:18:24] churches of
[1:18:29] World each one carrying their Banner
[1:18:32] from where they were
[1:18:36] from so it wasn't about oh this is this
[1:18:39] is my culture we do things this way no
[1:18:41] no every culture was represented
[1:18:47] there some of the dirtiest looking
[1:18:50] things I've ever seen in my life
[1:18:55] and then when the American Church come
[1:18:57] up it was the awfulest I have ever
[1:19:02] seen the heavenly father is my
[1:19:06] judge they had on these TL tail gray
[1:19:14] skirts like one of those barroom girls
[1:19:18] with no back on it up
[1:19:21] here and holding like a gray looking
[1:19:23] piece of paper
[1:19:28] and like H
[1:19:33] dancing so the prophet is saying that
[1:19:35] this dirty bride the Bride of Satan was
[1:19:38] walking to the beat of rock and
[1:19:42] roll and she was dancing a dance like
[1:19:45] hola
[1:19:48] dancing so when I saw that I was like
[1:19:50] let me go check what the hoola dancing
[1:19:52] is like
[1:19:57] so can you please project show them um
[1:20:00] if you go to media and then you um
[1:20:02] select whoa
[1:20:07] dancing so you see how they dancing the
[1:20:10] whoa
[1:20:11] dancing you just keep playing it again
[1:20:14] oh it's
[1:20:14] bugging but it's a dance where they are
[1:20:17] shaking their
[1:20:20] hips can you try to just yeah you see
[1:20:24] how they dance
[1:20:32] sing that's what the prophet saw that
[1:20:34] that dirty bride was
[1:20:40] dancing now if you go to the dance that
[1:20:42] we all know called
[1:20:47] M can you play that
[1:21:00] isn't it even worse than the hoola
[1:21:07] dancing it's actually the same dance but
[1:21:10] this is just a little bit
[1:21:13] worse and the prophet is telling you
[1:21:16] that he saw the Bride of Satan was
[1:21:18] dancing to this kind of
[1:21:23] music their hips
[1:21:27] so he probably saw the even the Bride of
[1:21:30] Congo maybe dancing
[1:21:35] M the dirty bride of Satan the Cong
[1:21:38] bride dancing and we call it
[1:21:45] culture I am not against culture but
[1:21:47] culture should not supered the word of
[1:21:53] God word of God must come
[1:21:57] first if your culture is making you do
[1:22:02] what the prophet saw the Bride of Satan
[1:22:04] do then you need to throw it
[1:22:12] away what we are doing is we are
[1:22:14] exposing the work of
[1:22:18] Satan and many of us have done it by
[1:22:22] ignorance but now the word has
[1:22:25] come and the word has told you that
[1:22:27] brother bam actually saw a d you know he
[1:22:31] he used the word like hola dancing so he
[1:22:33] didn't say it was exactly hola he just
[1:22:35] saw a dance that looked like hula
[1:22:40] dancing so anything of that manner where
[1:22:42] they were shaking the
[1:22:47] heaps that was the Bride of
[1:22:51] Satan so you need to stop dancing mut
[1:22:58] you know I'm not I'm not telling you
[1:23:00] what you what what you need to do but
[1:23:02] it's up to you to see if you want to
[1:23:03] identify with the bride of
[1:23:08] Christ or if you want identify with the
[1:23:11] bride of
[1:23:13] Satan but I know that me and my house We
[1:23:17] Shall Serve the
[1:23:20] Lord you need to come to that
[1:23:22] realization yourself that you and your
[1:23:25] house you will be with the bride of
[1:23:29] Christ know he said with paint short
[1:23:32] bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and the
[1:23:34] last part of is and I stood there
[1:23:38] looking she passed on
[1:23:43] by and you can you can imagine the back
[1:23:46] part of
[1:23:48] her with nothing
[1:23:52] on holding this in front of her she went
[1:23:55] Shing like
[1:23:58] that the prophet keeps in what is Shing
[1:24:01] the if you look up the definition of the
[1:24:03] shimi dance is it's a it's an American
[1:24:06] dance marked by shaking of the hips and
[1:24:16] shoulders so the prophet seems like
[1:24:18] everything you saw about the dirty bride
[1:24:20] was just involved in a dance where she
[1:24:22] was moving her hips
[1:24:32] by like that to this
[1:24:35] twist throwing her limbs out like
[1:24:41] that it says he was
[1:24:47] vulgar how she was caring
[1:24:51] on her body shaking around like
[1:24:57] that if the brother called that vulgar
[1:25:00] what he saw back then I also say it's
[1:25:02] vulgar
[1:25:05] today this is cleaning up times we need
[1:25:08] to clean ups in our
[1:25:13] Liv those High heill shoes go home and
[1:25:16] throw them
[1:25:19] out because you are housing Satan in
[1:25:22] your house
[1:25:25] and when you come in the church you wear
[1:25:27] those things you are also uh bringing
[1:25:30] Satan in the
[1:25:34] church and why why is Satan doing that
[1:25:37] he's doing that to to deceive the sons
[1:25:39] of
[1:25:42] God he's using you women as the his
[1:25:48] tool why are you letting Satan use you
[1:25:51] as as his tool
[1:25:54] instead of letting God use you as his
[1:26:00] tool God is looking for daughters of
[1:26:05] God daughters who fear
[1:26:08] God daughters who want to addess
[1:26:12] modest daughters who who say like Mary
[1:26:15] Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word
[1:26:25] so I really pray that you know it wasn't
[1:26:27] preaching it was just exposing the the
[1:26:30] the devil in the lives of
[1:26:36] sisters but the prophet put it back on
[1:26:38] the brothers he said it's actually not a
[1:26:40] sister's fault it's the
[1:26:47] brothers he said because you are letting
[1:26:49] them go out like that you are supposed
[1:26:52] to be you are supposed to be the ruler
[1:26:55] of your
[1:26:58] house so today when you go home go rule
[1:27:01] your house the way you were meant to
[1:27:03] rule your
[1:27:11] house we all claim to be Believers of
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:15] message the messages told us that you
[1:27:18] cannot make you to heaven wearing high
[1:27:20] heels
[1:27:24] are we trying to go to
[1:27:27] hell I don't think there's anybody here
[1:27:29] why would you come to church if your
[1:27:31] goal is to go to
[1:27:35] hell if your goal is to go to hell then
[1:27:37] don't come here and and affect someone
[1:27:39] else then just go go outside
[1:27:42] there the house of God is a house of cor
[1:27:46] correction the word has corrected
[1:27:49] us and the Holy Spirit is saying that we
[1:27:52] need to clean our lives
[1:27:55] we need to clean this
[1:27:57] church because you are reflecting the
[1:28:00] bride of Christ in this
[1:28:03] city in every city God has a in every
[1:28:06] place God has a
[1:28:10] witness you know God is when other
[1:28:12] people will be like oh but we never know
[1:28:14] God will be like I had set a witness
[1:28:17] there in that town
[1:28:24] it's not it's not a coincidence that you
[1:28:26] found yourself here in Iowa
[1:28:29] City God brought you here because he
[1:28:32] wanted the world to see that there are
[1:28:33] still women that will dress according to
[1:28:36] the
[1:28:41] word amen amen you may
[1:28:47] stand I trust this was a blessing to
[1:28:52] you and and like the prophet
[1:28:56] said you know you need it takes prayer
[1:28:59] for you to if the prophet says that one
[1:29:02] thing is bad I don't know if I have this
[1:29:07] code he says but if you if you don't
[1:29:10] pray it will do you
[1:29:13] nothing you know you need to pray in
[1:29:15] order for God to reveal to
[1:29:19] you I can come here and
[1:29:22] preach I can come here and
[1:29:26] preach but if that not revealed to you
[1:29:28] it's not going to do you
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:39] anything the
