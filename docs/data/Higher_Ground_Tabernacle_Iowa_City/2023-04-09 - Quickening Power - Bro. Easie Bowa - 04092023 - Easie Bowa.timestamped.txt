[45:23] about Easter in Des Moines in my way we
[45:26] see the mountains

[50:15] 28
[50:20] is
[50:24] m
[50:25] Matthew Mayfield chapter 28 from verse 1
[50:29] up to 10.
[50:39] after reading our pray then you will sit
[50:44] down and also read into
[50:47] other quotations
[50:50] foreign
[51:00] [Music]
[51:06] now after the Sabbath as the first day
[51:09] of the week began to drown Mary
[51:12] Magdalene and the other Mary came to see
[51:15] the tomb he was
[51:27] and behold there was a great earthquake
[51:30] for an angel of the Lord descendant from
[51:32] heaven and came and rolled back the
[51:36] Stone from the door and sat on it is
[51:45] in the Book of Mark those women were
[51:48] wondering who's gonna roll back the
[51:49] stone for them
[51:57] you see the angel of the Lord came down
[51:59] and rolled back the storms
[52:01] [Music]
[52:07] his continence was like lightning and
[52:10] his clothing was his white snow Le
[52:13] Garden more
[52:18] [Music]
[52:28] and the god shook for fear and him of
[52:31] him and became like dead man but the
[52:34] angel answered and said to the woman do
[52:37] not do not be afraid for I know that you
[52:40] seek Jesus who was crucified
[52:51] um
[52:56] foreign
[53:04] he is not here for his reason as he said
[53:08] come and see the place where the Lord
[53:10] lay and go quickly and tell his
[53:13] disciples that he is risen from the dead
[53:16] and indeed he is going before you into
[53:19] Galilee for you will you will see him
[53:23] discipline
[53:33] so they went they went out quickly from
[53:35] the tomb with fear and great joy and run
[53:39] to bring his disciples words
[53:52] and as they went to tell his disciples
[53:55] behold Jesus met them saying Rejoice so
[53:59] they came and held held him by by the
[54:01] field by defeat and worship him
[54:13] then Jesus said to them do not be afraid
[54:16] go enter my burden to go to Galilee and
[54:20] there and there they will see me
[55:10] [Music]
[55:20] Victory on scene foreign
[55:47] [Music]
[56:08] I wanna read again uh Revelation chapter
[56:11] one verse one no 10 to 17.
[56:17] 17 to 18. Revelation chapter one more
[56:28] foreign
[56:34] foreign
[57:06] but he laid his his right hand on me
[57:10] saying to me do not be afraid I am the
[57:13] first and the last
[57:15] foreign
[57:54] amen
[58:08] in the Book of Romans chapter 8 verse
[58:11] 11.
[58:16] but if the spirit of him of him who
[58:20] raised Jesus from Day from the dead
[58:22] dwells in you he who raised cross from
[58:26] the dead will also give life to your
[58:29] mortal bodies through his Spirit who
[58:32] dwells in you okay
[58:35] may the Lord bless the reading of Israel
[58:37] this is a Christian Amen in the name of
[58:40] the Lord Jesus
[58:43] like I said this morning when I speak
[58:46] about the view uh
[58:49] the quickening power is
[58:57] preaching every time it was
[59:02] he could change the subject of his
[59:05] preachers
[59:09] but the content was was the quickening
[59:13] power it prevented
[59:16] title it like uh the rising of the sun
[59:21] he could entitle the the the
[59:25] Easter sale
[59:27] Resurrection or the proof of his
[59:30] resurrection
[59:34] all of that is because you wanted to
[59:37] speak about it quickly
[59:42] so we know this Easter is the most
[59:45] eventful or for Christians Pasco Parker
[59:50] Resurrection because Easter is the
[59:53] resurrection amen amen
[1:00:03] I don't think you're taking a position
[1:00:05] to sleep
[1:00:10] because if you're now taking position to
[1:00:13] sleep that's not good huh
[1:00:16] is
[1:00:18] I can see people taking a position to
[1:00:21] sleep
[1:00:22] so don't do that please
[1:00:32] so Easter is the most important event
[1:00:35] for uh for Christians
[1:00:38] because Easter is the resurrection
[1:00:42] Resurrection
[1:00:46] said Resurrection means restoration
[1:00:51] when our Lord Jesus Christ was raised
[1:00:54] from Death
[1:00:59] he proved that everything that the
[1:01:02] scriptures were talking about him was
[1:01:04] true
[1:01:12] and we know that the resurrection of our
[1:01:14] Lord Jesus Christ brought to us the
[1:01:16] victory that have never been Sunset
[1:01:19] Resurrection because without this
[1:01:21] Resurrection
[1:01:22] without this victory
[1:02:23] foreign that's why the Lord said
[1:02:28] I got the power to give my life and get
[1:02:31] it back
[1:02:33] so if the Lord just died
[1:02:37] and didn't rest again
[1:02:41] we are going to still be
[1:02:46] we are going to be still potentially
[1:02:51] because the sense of the whole whole
[1:02:57] but they were dead
[1:03:02] and the devil had a kiss
[1:03:24] Elementary
[1:03:48] and put him inside
[1:03:51] that's why is
[1:03:55] why the Lord has to raise up
[1:03:59] the Lord is Rich
[1:04:03] he proved by more
[1:04:10] about him they were true
[1:04:13] that's what David said
[1:04:17] by is the spirit of God
[1:04:24] I will never let my holy to get
[1:04:27] corrupted
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:38] should happen to him but David was
[1:04:41] talking about Christ
[1:04:44] but that could not let the body of Jesus
[1:04:47] Christ
[1:04:50] without that Victory
[1:04:53] without that Resurrection
[1:04:57] we're going to be still
[1:05:15] died like a man
[1:05:18] and raise up again like God
[1:05:23] that's what
[1:05:26] that's what makes this
[1:05:30] that's the only true religion in the
[1:05:33] world
[1:05:34] because
[1:05:42] it's the one that the founder is not in
[1:05:45] the grave this is
[1:05:48] trying to find my my uh
[1:05:52] my base
[1:05:59] thank you
[1:06:02] so Christian religion is
[1:06:25] my feet I want the tomb to be really
[1:06:28] excited
[1:06:30] that Christ shouldn't be making it
[1:06:34] should be the original
[1:06:37] in each and everywhere
[1:06:45] that's what we're talking about this
[1:06:47] morning
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:57] when he was dying on the cross
[1:06:59] ES
[1:07:06] he ruled it forever this animal we're
[1:07:09] calling Satan we Satan certain animal
[1:07:11] because Saturn is the prophet
[1:07:14] of God is
[1:07:18] when Jesus
[1:07:36] is a great animal
[1:07:58] has been broken
[1:08:03] the rape of the devil has been broken
[1:08:05] today the kidney kidney
[1:08:08] oh the kidney the devil kidney has been
[1:08:11] um
[1:08:17] he has been wounded forever
[1:08:20] and his back has been uh
[1:08:24] foreign
[1:09:03] foreign
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] we may be in a position that Christ is
[1:09:41] living in us this morning
[1:09:44] I want to go bit by bit
[1:09:47] that's why
[1:09:48] the Lord could say
[1:09:54] I got the power to give my life and take
[1:09:57] it back the prophet the judge is
[1:10:01] the prophet of God is saying in the
[1:10:04] restitution of the uh bride Bright Tree
[1:10:10] he said now it's Easter
[1:10:14] Sunday preaching 1962.
[1:10:20] recedition of a Bright Tree
[1:10:27] I'm saying it for Israel to protect it
[1:10:30] but now it's Easter Park I love Easter
[1:10:36] we met India
[1:10:49] concerning this little rabbit concerning
[1:10:52] this herd and all this or the rope
[1:10:56] and all of that is
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:04] like in the shop I've seen people buying
[1:11:07] flowers
[1:11:12] all right people gonna eat a rabbit
[1:11:16] they're gonna eat the dark foreign
[1:12:04] because Easter is is spring
[1:12:10] and the Earth was coming from the uh
[1:12:13] from the cold
[1:12:15] processes
[1:12:19] it's in the process of going into its
[1:12:22] normal process
[1:12:25] and God is busy restoring the Earth
[1:12:30] while it was struck by the uh by the
[1:12:33] court of winter Jack fell foreign
[1:13:01] please don't take that position
[1:13:04] position
[1:13:08] s
[1:13:12] take long three hours
[1:13:15] I can do also like that
[1:13:18] give a compression
[1:13:23] are you sure
[1:13:25] what a permission with your permission
[1:13:28] I'm gonna push for three hours
[1:13:30] okay second
[1:13:33] position
[1:13:35] so those who want to take positions
[1:13:39] go sleep for three hours
[1:13:42] just take your position
[1:13:44] I've got the uh allowance to preach for
[1:13:47] three hours
[1:13:49] Jim
[1:13:52] the prophet of God said
[1:13:57] the Earth went a distance
[1:14:02] that's why they call structure
[1:14:06] and everything is
[1:14:09] because gold is the type of death
[1:14:15] and when we start coming out
[1:14:22] it means the Earth is getting close it's

[2:28:24] since we're talking about Easter
[2:28:27] and we all know what happened
[2:28:30] during Easter time right so remember we
[2:28:32] had three
[2:28:34] subject right we spoke about the first
[2:28:36] one was what
[2:28:39] those three things happened
[2:28:42] the first one
[2:28:46] the first one it was the Betrayal
[2:28:51] betrayed by who
[2:28:54] do it and then by the crucifixion of
[2:28:57] Jesus Christ right and then
[2:29:00] the resurrection right so
[2:29:04] I had some kids that had a Bible verse
[2:29:07] to memorize
[2:29:09] and um
[2:29:11] we're supposed to start with
[2:29:15] Isaiah chapter well 53
[2:29:19] verse 3
[2:29:21] so forth
[2:29:24] but
[2:29:25] we're kind of like we could
[2:29:28] change it because I give I give someone
[2:29:30] to Bible verses I got confused myself so
[2:29:33] we're going to start with Israel yeah
[2:29:36] verse 5 right okay
[2:29:44] went through for us he died for us he
[2:29:48] went through a lot of stuff for us so I
[2:29:50] gave them some Bible verse to memorize
[2:29:52] and saying to you guys
[2:29:56] uh Isaiah 53 verse
[2:30:00] Isaiah 53 verse verse 5.
[2:30:04] first five
[2:30:06] but he was wounded for our transgression
[2:30:08] uh Bruce for our iniquities the
[2:30:12] transplant of our peace was upon him and
[2:30:16] with his stripes we are healed
[2:30:19] amen
[2:30:24] Knight William
[2:30:28] Isaiah verse 6 for Isaiah chapter 53
[2:30:32] verse 6.
[2:30:34] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[2:30:37] have turned we have turned everyone to
[2:30:38] his own way and the lord has laid I have
[2:30:42] laid on on
[2:30:47] oh the Lord have laid on his inquency of
[2:30:50] us all
[2:31:02] okay now we're going to give Grace
[2:31:05] she's going to
[2:31:07] watch your Bible verse can you have a
[2:31:09] look up one
[2:31:13] um Acts 3 verses chapter oh no um Acts
[2:31:18] chapter 3 verses 50.
[2:31:22] and killed the Prince of Life whom God
[2:31:24] has no um
[2:31:27] killed the Prince of Life whom God has
[2:31:30] raised from the dead where I'll pray
[2:31:32] with resistance
[2:31:34] so the price of life was killed by God
[2:31:37] raised him who is the Prince of Life
[2:31:41] who's God
[2:31:44] okay so now we're going to jump
[2:31:49] to
[2:31:53] Jean Didier
[2:31:56] so Jesus Christ said himself who he
[2:32:00] really is
[2:32:01] okay
[2:32:05] Jesus said I am the resurrection and the
[2:32:08] life
[2:32:14] it does that uh believe in me even when
[2:32:17] they die they shall still live for under
[2:32:19] Resurrection in the life
[2:32:22] all right
[2:32:25] now we have Margaret she's going to give
[2:32:30] us like a summary of John chapter
[2:32:36] 18 questions
[2:32:50] so uh late
[2:32:53] um like at Doc on the first day of the
[2:32:57] week Mary Magdalene like came to this
[2:33:01] tall the tomb and saw that the stone was
[2:33:06] like removed so she came to the to Simon
[2:33:09] and Peter and said that the Tom has been
[2:33:13] removed and so Simon and Peter went
[2:33:17] there but Simon got there first and
[2:33:19] didn't go in but he saw the Lin
[2:33:23] um lying there and then uh Peter went
[2:33:25] there Peter got there and then
[2:33:29] um then he went inside and saw the limb
[2:33:33] pieces of cloth
[2:33:36] um
[2:33:37] then
[2:33:40] um Mary like was there crying
[2:33:44] um as she left she looked inside and
[2:33:47] then she saw two angels one at the foot
[2:33:51] and one at the head and so uh the Angels
[2:33:55] asked her why are you crying
[2:33:58] um and then she said that because
[2:34:02] um they have taken my Lord away and I
[2:34:04] don't know where they put him and so at
[2:34:07] that point she turned around and she saw
[2:34:10] Jesus but she thought it was the
[2:34:11] gardener so uh Jesus said that woman who
[2:34:16] are you looking for and she said
[2:34:18] um I am looking for my reward and then
[2:34:21] Jesus said Mary and Mary uh
[2:34:25] Cried Out Rabbi which means teacher and
[2:34:29] I'll I'll block and then uh and then
[2:34:34] Jesus said that do not come to me yet
[2:34:37] because I have not ascended to my father
[2:34:40] so go tell my brothers
[2:34:42] um that I I am ascending to my Father
[2:34:46] which is your father and my God which is
[2:34:48] your god and so she went um she went to
[2:34:52] tell the disciples and she went with the
[2:34:55] news and she said that I have saw him
[2:34:58] and told them everything that he has
[2:35:02] said
[2:35:10] I was literally crying like
[2:35:13] I told her you're gonna tell the parents
[2:35:15] what happened to the day of resurrection
[2:35:17] and she literally told you guys
[2:35:19] everything that happened so if you guys
[2:35:21] don't know she just

[2:39:04] your nose
[2:39:10] yeah I'm trying to make it sure I didn't
[2:39:11] want to take too long I'm tired okay so
[2:39:15] Jesus Christ got arrested right and when
[2:39:18] it got arrested one of his disciple or
[2:39:22] his friend denied him when they asked
[2:39:25] him do you know Jesus Christ as you guys
[2:39:28] are doing you guys are denying Jesus
[2:39:30] Christ by now bring your Bible in school

[2:39:48] you guys were okay guys wait until
[2:39:51] you'll see it

[2:39:58] [Music]
[2:39:59] Peter are you sure about that
[2:40:04] yeah that's right
[2:40:07] okay so Jesus Christ was crucified right
[2:40:10] and it was in the mountain
[2:40:14] right
[2:40:15] I think it was month in Sinai
[2:40:18] where
[2:40:24] [Music]
[2:40:30] what
[2:40:33] happened
[2:40:34] [Music]
[2:40:49] [Music]
[2:40:55] um because Jesus Christ got crucified
[2:40:57] right he was on the cross was he by
[2:41:01] himself
[2:41:02] he had how many people
[2:41:07] two
[2:41:09] I think there were four
[2:41:14] you got me on that yeah that's right
[2:41:15] that's right but what a child think
[2:41:18] there were five
[2:41:23] right right
[2:41:25] so okay
[2:41:29] so when Jesus Christ was carrying the
[2:41:31] cross right he was killed on the cross
[2:41:33] and we all know the cross was heavy
[2:41:35] right
[2:41:37] and there was someone I don't know if it
[2:41:39] was Papa John
[2:41:42] oh it was professional
[2:41:45] but he has a name uh who's that person
[2:41:51] Simon who
[2:41:56] do you mean
[2:41:58] the the guy went there and helped Jesus
[2:42:01] Christ carry what
[2:42:04] carry the crowds okay
[2:42:07] so number seven
[2:42:10] Jesus Christ when he was dead right they
[2:42:13] were supposed to bury him
[2:42:15] right
[2:42:17] and there as someone who was a rich guy
