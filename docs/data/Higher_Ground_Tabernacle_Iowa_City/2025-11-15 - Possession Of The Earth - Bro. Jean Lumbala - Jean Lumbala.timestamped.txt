[0:22] experience with God. He will never be
[0:24] discouraged.
[0:26] How are you going to discourage him? How
[0:28] are you going to do it to discourage
[0:30] him? There's no way you can discourage
[0:31] somebody with bad experience with God.
[0:36] I I got a testimony from someone.
[0:39] Let me just give it before we start.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a family in
[0:47] &gt;&gt; a family that I know.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Or the wife of brother Jimmy.
[0:56] So the big sister of brother Jimmy's
[0:59] wife passed away.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; She left behind a daughter.
[1:11] So that that that girl grew up in a in a
[1:15] auntie's house.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; She was so disturbed.
[1:21] She she used to go out and do things out
[1:23] there.
[1:28] And she she was in a a Catholic family
[1:30] and no one could could pay attention to
[1:33] her. But one day
[1:39] Then she start having some uh thirst of
[1:42] God in her in her HOME
[1:45] and she started praying in the house.
[1:49] Lord, you know my condition.
[1:52] I'm an orphan of a FATHER AND MOTHER.
[1:57] I I'm
[1:59] I'm I grew up in a house of my
[2:03] but the way that I'm taking right now
[2:06] it's NOT A GOOD WAY.
[2:08] I JUST WANT TO be your servant.
[2:11] Please God,
[2:15] may you lead me where I can start
[2:17] praying.
[2:18] I don't want to be a Catholic member
[2:20] anymore. God, may you lead me. So that's
[2:24] the testimony they gave me just
[2:25] yesterday.
[2:29] And that sister went out of her house
[2:31] after three days of praying.
[2:34] She said right now as I'm going out,
[2:37] I'm not going to come back.
[2:41] You God, you lead me where I'm going to
[2:44] follow and listen to the true word of
[2:45] God. NOBODY PREACHED HER.
[2:49] SHE prayed and PRAYED PRAYED SO MUCH and
[2:52] God led her
[2:56] until she found a tabernacle.
[3:01] She she found herself in front of a
[3:03] tabernacle. She start saying in her
[3:05] heart,
[3:06] Lord,
[3:11] I pray so that you can lead me where I
[3:13] can listen.
[3:16] How can you bring ME TO THE FATHER
[3:19] MISS THOSE WHO WORSHIP?
[3:21] THOSE WHO ARE WORSHIPING ME
[3:24] ARE raising a man.
[3:27] I want to go where I can just listen to
[3:29] your word.
[3:33] She wanted to pass by and she didn't
[3:35] have any to go.
[3:38] She wanted to LEAVE THAT CHAIR AND GOD
[3:39] SAID UNTO HER, "THIS IS THE PLACE I'm
[3:42] sending you.
[3:44] You ask me then I led you to this place.
[3:47] Then she finally entered that church.
[3:51] She appreciated the word of God. The
[3:52] first day the second day SHE CAME AGAIN.
[3:56] FOURTH day she came TO THE SAME PLACE.
[3:59] [screaming]
[3:59] AFTER A MONTH AND TWO MONTHS SHE TOOK
[4:02] HER BAPTISM
[4:04] AND SHE became one of our members.
[4:08] THE BIG SISTERAPT WHO WAS ALSO HER
[4:11] MOTHER. SHE WAS
[4:14] UNCLE WHO WAS A HUSBAND TO A FATHER was
[4:17] also baptized.
[4:19] Everybody they are now believers of
[4:21] mercy today just because of ONE PERSON
[4:26] JUST because of one offer
[4:29] who pray with sincere heart and God led
[4:32] her.
[4:33] But now God tell that sister,
[4:36] "No, just go get her there or go listen
[4:39] to a place." And all those who are
[4:43] CRITICIZING THE MESSAGE, IF THEY CAN GO
[4:45] TELL her that the message is wrong,
[4:49] she's not going to agree with her. SHE'S
[4:51] NOT ACCEPTING IT
[4:55] because she heard her own EXPERIENCE
[4:57] WITH GOD.
[5:00] SHE HEARD THE VOICE OF GOD WITH HER OWN
[5:02] EARS.
[5:05] Someone like that, you'll never
[5:06] discourage her.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; She said, "Whatever you can say, it's
[5:10] not it's not going to DISTURB YOU.
[5:14] SHE went in the
[5:16] she went to the church of her father
[5:19] or a church of her husband.
[5:22] I met a brother like that in
[5:24] Johannesburg. A brother like that in
[5:26] Johannesburg.
[5:28] So when they came, we welcomed them. We
[5:31] were going to church with them.
[5:34] After a while, we didn't see each other
[5:36] for two years. Then I saw him wearing
[5:39] short with a with a whiskey in hand.
[5:43] Then I said, "What's going on?" said,
[5:46] "Ah, big brother. Don't worry." I was
[5:49] going to the church of my parents. I've
[5:51] never been convicted.
[5:54] Then I say, "Okay, may God bless you
[5:55] because you're sincere.
[5:58] You were going in the CHURCH OF
[6:02] &gt;&gt; AND we've got so many people like that
[6:04] SITTING IN THE PAIN.
[6:06] THOSE WHO ARE ATTENDING CHURCHES OF
[6:08] OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE the
[6:11] message.
[6:13] Maybe she believed in the message of her
[6:15] husband or maybe her friend. I I always
[6:20] people like that.
[6:22] THERE ARE many those kind of people. And
[6:25] another one said, "No, that's the church
[6:27] of my husband. So what can we do? We
[6:30] just GO
[6:33] because if you've already loved
[6:34] somebody, you got to love his church as
[6:36] well. It's his church. So I don't have I
[6:40] got nothing to do with that.
[6:43] We are just like fishes.
[6:46] We just follow where waters are leading
[6:48] us. As the husband is going to that
[6:50] church, I'LL FOLLOW HIM THERE."
[6:53] NO, THAT'S NOT OUR SISTER.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Our sister
[6:57] is someone who has got his her own
[7:00] experience with the Lord.
[7:03] Somebody like that, YOU NEVER DISCOURAGE
[7:05] HER.
[7:06] THAT'S WHAT PAUL HAVE DONE. [screaming]
[7:09] WHEN PAUL MET THE PILL OF FIRE, now
[7:13] listen what he said.
[7:15] after he has met the pill of FIRE
[7:20] me ascender from THE LOVE OF CHRIST.
[7:22] [screaming]
[7:23] NEITHER THE HURT,
[7:25] &gt;&gt; NEITHER THE DEEPNESS
[7:28] OR EITHER THE
[7:30] NEITHER DEATH OR LIFE
[7:33] AND NOBODY
[7:36] nobody will separate me from the love of
[7:38] the message OF THE END TIME.
[7:41] I'M THE MESSAGE MYSELF
[7:44] AND THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT HERE.
[7:47] THIS IS A message to one person. There's
[7:50] no way you can separate us.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; SO who can say that?
[7:55] &gt;&gt; It's only somebody who have who have
[7:57] done an experience with God.
[8:02] Then you see you see some an example.
[8:04] You see someone in church
[8:06] and he's able to say
[8:09] uh that's their church. It's not mine.
[8:12] How can you SAY THAT THEIR CHURCH
[8:15] WHICH MEANS IT'S NOT your church?
[8:22] &gt;&gt; We just counted. We've got a brother
[8:24] Simba, we've got brother Kabong and
[8:26] brother such a brother. We just counting
[8:29] number of members sister. We're just
[8:32] COUNTING THE HEAD OF
[8:34] BUT THEY ARE NOT our our our PEOPLE
[8:38] because someone like that
[8:41] if you just go on social media
[8:44] if you see somebody who's just
[8:48] I'm coming from Kentucky
[8:50] I know William Brham very well HE WAS A
[8:53] MAGICIAN
[8:55] SOMEBODY
[8:57] YOU SEE he was not a a Christian so What
[9:01] can PUSH THAT PERSON TODAY?
[9:04] IT'S BECAUSE HE never had an experience
[9:05] with the Lord.
[9:08] He never test God by himself.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz on the way of faith,
[9:17] there's only one place for two people.
[9:20] One place is for you
[9:24] and the other place is for your creator.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Only two places.
[9:29] It's only you and your creator. You go
[9:32] in that place in a higher place.
[9:37] So may God bless us for tonight.
[9:39] Let us stand. We're going to read
[9:41] something.
[9:45] Uh I don't know. I don't understand. I
[9:47] appreciate last time.
[9:52] I've got a lot of note.
[9:56] We're going to skip things by the grace
[9:58] of God.
[10:02] So we're going to read in
[10:05] Genesis or chapter 1 verse 26 to 28
[10:13] as we're going to speak about the same
[10:15] message
[10:18] to pos to possess the earth.
[10:26] May God bless you once more.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; You are so special
[10:33] &gt;&gt; just to come in this place every time
[10:39] and I understand that you are serious in
[10:41] what you're doing.
[10:43] If I can understand what you're doing,
[10:47] then God will understand better than me
[10:50] and he will bless you for what you're
[10:52] doing.
[10:54] So we're going to read in the name of
[10:56] the Lord Jesus.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; And God said,
[11:02] &gt;&gt; "Let us make man in our image
[11:05] and after our likeness,
[11:09] and let them have dominion over the fish
[11:11] of the earth, and over the f of the air,
[11:16] and over the cattle,
[11:19] and over all the earth,
[11:27] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[11:27] &gt;&gt; and also over every creeping things.
[11:33] Bless the reading of his word. We may be
[11:35] seated. Okay.
[11:43] So, we're going to continue with the
[11:45] message that we preached last Friday
[11:49] &gt;&gt; to possess the earth.
[11:53] So what we just read,
[11:57] &gt;&gt; it's a blessing
[12:02] &gt;&gt; and it's also a promise
[12:06] that our creator have done to us
[12:10] to possess the earth.
[12:14] So when God created US
[12:18] in his mind and in HIS HEART,
[12:21] &gt;&gt; the purpose why he created us,
[12:27] it's for us to be a little God upon this
[12:30] earth. Amen.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[12:37] God has created us to have dominion ON
[12:39] THE EARTH.
[12:43] GOD HAS created us to instruct.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; God has created us to lead.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; We can reign,
[12:57] to reign upon the earth.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; To have a position of the earth.
[13:07] To possess the earth is to have dominion
[13:10] upon you.
[13:13] Is to put it down on YOU
[13:17] is to be the master of the earth.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; It's our inheritance
[13:25] and the victory is also our promise.
[13:30] That's what God HAS PROMISED TO US.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; TO BE HEADS
[13:36] AND NOT tails
[13:40] to BE THE FIRST
[13:42] &gt;&gt; AND not the last.
[13:46] That's our promise.
[13:51] Everywhere going to put YOUR FAITH.
[13:54] I'll give you that place as inheritance.
[14:00] So if there's hairs of God, WE ARE THE
[14:03] ONES.
[14:05] IF THERE'S a hair, it's me.
[14:09] It's me. May God bless you.
[14:15] So we are hairs
[14:18] all promises of our Lord.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what God want us to be.
[14:28] Now notice
[14:34] &gt;&gt; children of Israel, Jewish people,
[14:39] &gt;&gt; they were in a foreign land
[14:45] while being there. They were slaves
[14:53] in order to leave Egypt to promised
[14:56] land.
[15:01] THEY HAD TO FIGHT, fight and fight AGAIN
[15:05] before even they leave Egypt.
[15:08] [screaming]
[15:11] They had to overcome the Egyptian ARMY
[15:16] to overcome all the politician of in
[15:18] EGYPT
[15:22] to overcome even the security of Egypt.
[15:26] called order or the FBI,
[15:32] they had to rule on them
[15:36] before they leave Egypt.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; That's why we need victory.
[15:44] You can't have victory if you don't KNOW
[15:46] HOW TO FIGHT.
[15:48] BEFORE YOU GET A VICTORY,
[15:51] the first that the thing that comes
[15:52] first is the fight.
[15:56] You ought to fight first.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Before even you leave this world,
[16:02] there's a war. There's a battle you got
[16:04] to fight.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; When you have dominion,
[16:12] then you can go out of here.
[16:16] So once you go out of Egypt
[16:20] until you get to promised land which is
[16:22] YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST WHICH IS THE
[16:25] LAND THAT YOU NEED TO POSSESS.
[16:28] THERE'S kingdoms around.
[16:31] THERE'S also a PRIEST
[16:35] and they're not going to leave you
[16:36] alone.
[16:38] They're not going to let you pass.
[16:41] And children of Israel, they could come
[16:44] on their way from Egypt when they get
[16:47] somewhere.
[16:50] They could say
[16:53] or we want to go through this land.
[16:56] So we which kingdom is there.
[17:02] So they take some messengers.
[17:05] They write a letter,
[17:08] &gt;&gt; go tell the king OF THE KINGDOM.
[17:13] THAT WE WANT TO GO THROUGH their
[17:14] territory.
[17:20] If we eat something,
[17:25] even our even if our flocks eat their
[17:28] produce, we're going TO PAY FOR THAT.
[17:32] EVEN IF we drink your water, we're going
[17:35] to pay for it.
[17:37] But so what THESE PEOPLE SAY,
[17:40] WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET you pass through
[17:42] us.
[17:45] So they are imposing battle even if you
[17:48] DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT
[17:50] BUT THE devil is imposing the battle on
[17:52] you.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something
[17:57] &gt;&gt; for every step that YOU HAVE TO MAKE
[18:01] FOR FOR EVERY SUCCESS
[18:04] FOR EVERY VICTORY
[18:07] you ought to fight for it.
[18:14] The devil will never leave you alone.
[18:18] He's not going to let YOU GO.
[18:21] He's going to impose the battle on you.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; You're not going to JUST GO FREELY FROM
[18:28] You're not going to enter the canal
[18:30] walking freely as I went to another
[18:34] church in Kesa.
[18:38] Oh, we're going to go to heaven then we
[18:39] go to heaven. No to go to heaven not
[18:42] walking freely like that. IT'S A FIGHT.
[18:45] YOU ARE TO GO FROM fight to another
[18:47] fight until you finish all the fight.
[18:50] WHEN YOU FINISH THIS FIGHT, ANOTHER ONE
[18:53] COMES.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; So we going to fight until we possess
[18:58] the earth. Amen.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:02] And the devil is not going to let you go
[19:04] freely as if you going to the picnic.
[19:10] The almighty God
[19:13] is not going to let us walk freely like
[19:15] that
[19:17] on the easy WAY
[19:20] while other people fought. They paid FOR
[19:24] THEIR LIVES.
[19:26] THEY THEY SPEND THE TIME. THEY FASTED.
[19:31] They prayed.
[19:32] And you just woke up and say, "No, I'm
[19:35] going to go to heaven freely."
[19:37] No, you're not going to go like that.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; You ought to go somewhere first.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; That's how another big brother was
[19:45] telling me. He was telling me in Chula,
[19:50] if you want to go, if you want to go in
[19:54] peace, if you want to walk in peace,
[19:58] you may go. Surely, you can. You may go.
[20:02] But you're gonna get to to the to the
[20:05] city of Jul. But not in heaven. That
[20:08] will be in the city OF JUL SOMEWHERE.
[20:10] NOW you will get somewhere which is like
[20:14] heaven BUT IT'S NOT HEAVEN. But to go to
[20:16] heaven. YOU are to prepare for a fight.
[20:20] You should be a a fighter, a a strong
[20:23] fighter. Someone who can fight.
[20:27] You're not just fighting.
[20:30] Someone who's going to rule. Who's going
[20:31] to overcome and rule?
[20:35] For every victory,
[20:38] you ought to prepare for a fight.
[20:42] Why are we fighting?
[20:48] In Matthew 48 to10,
[20:54] &gt;&gt; the Bible is telling us this
[20:59] &gt;&gt; that one day the devil.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; He took our Lord.
[21:08] The devil bring our Lord upon the
[21:10] mountain.
[21:12] Now it was the devil speaking to to our
[21:14] Lord Jesus. Now listen,
[21:18] the devil was telling Jesus that you
[21:20] ought to worship ME
[21:24] so that I can give you the position of
[21:26] the earth.
[21:31] So the devil HAVE SHOWN UNTO
[21:34] JOHANNESBURG, New York, all those big
[21:36] CITIES THAT YOU KNOW and they said unto
[21:38] Jesus,
[21:40] if you worship me, I will give you all
[21:42] those cities.
[21:44] And if you read carefully in the Bible,
[21:48] he must never argue with the devil what
[21:50] he say. And the devil also,
[21:54] he can't GIVE YOU
[21:57] SOMETHING THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE.
[22:00] IF THE DEVIL SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE
[22:01] YOU, WHICH MEANS HE HAD SOMETHING
[22:06] and Jesus never argue with him. He said
[22:10] the word is not yours.
[22:12] And he said he BELIEVED THAT THE WORD
[22:14] BELONG TO THE DEVIL. So how how come the
[22:17] devil is going TO
[22:20] HEARD IT
[22:22] BY FRAUD?
[22:26] The word was supposed to be
[22:30] to the son of God TO RULE
[22:33] THE devil by HIS MERS.
[22:36] [screaming]
[22:37] HE WENT AROUND OUR FALL TO STEAL OUR
[22:40] POSSESSION.
[22:41] NOW HE WANT TO MAKE A SIGN FOR some
[22:43] stuff.
[22:45] Cuz everything that you want to do IN
[22:46] THE WORLD,
[22:48] YOU OUGHT to overcome the devil first
[22:51] BEFORE YOU POSSESS IT. SO WHAT THE
[22:53] DEVILS HAVE done
[22:56] is going to bring you into negotiation
[23:00] as he did it to our Lord.
[23:03] He said unto him, if you worship me,
[23:05] then I will give you.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; So we never heard such promise.
[23:10] THE PROMISE THAT WE HEARD IS TO SAY UNTO
[23:13] DEVIL,
[23:15] IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN,
[23:18] you will worship only THE LORD YOUR
[23:20] CREATOR.
[23:21] THAT'S THE promise that we have.
[23:24] OTHER PROMISE THAT WE HAVE
[23:27] IS TO FIGHT against the devil,
[23:30] fight until the last BREATH HE HAD and
[23:33] to be victorious.
[23:35] That's the promise with God.
[23:38] Because if you don't fight him until the
[23:40] last breath, IF YOU DON'T FIGHT HIM, THE
[23:44] ONE is the one who's GOING TO FIGHT YOU.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; AND I'M assuring you, he's not GOING TO
[23:49] MISS YOU.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY way to do
[23:53] is to FIGHT THE DEVIL,
[23:56] TO FIGHT HIM,
[23:58] to fight until we eliminate him.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; There was a war in Israel.
[24:09] And children of Israel, God said unto
[24:11] them something.
[24:13] When you go fight against Philistine,
[24:17] &gt;&gt; you ought to finish them.
[24:21] Even their little ones, you got TO
[24:22] FINISH THEM
[24:24] BECAUSE THEY are demons.
[24:28] So if you're fighting against demons,
[24:30] you're not just going to say,
[24:34] "No, I'm going to fight the
[24:36] prostitution.
[24:37] I'm going to fight against
[24:40] I'm going I'm going to fight against
[24:42] hatred.
[24:44] But you leave the envy over ruling on
[24:47] you.
[24:50] You also leave the TV, the spirit of
[24:53] WATCHING TV ON YOU. YOU OUGHT TO rule
[24:57] the fact of watching TV. Even the phone,
[25:00] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE
[25:03] YOU GOT to be free from the phone.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; You got to overrule on your phone.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Social media today,
[25:15] it's now stronger than
[25:18] if was there. I don't know what he could
[25:21] say about social media. I don't know
[25:24] what he's going to say about
[25:24] smartphones,
[25:29] &gt;&gt; but it became more dangerous more than
[25:32] TV.
[25:35] Your phone can get can KEEP YOU AWAY
[25:37] FROM
[25:39] IT, IT CAN TAKE ALL your time,
[25:42] even the time that you're supposed to
[25:44] dedicate yourself to God, but social
[25:47] media can keep YOU AWAY FROM THAT. BUT
[25:49] BEING A SON OF GOD,
[25:52] &gt;&gt; WE ARE TO FIGHT all the Philistines.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; What is Philistine today?
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Everything that PUT ITSELF
[26:04] &gt;&gt; BETWEEN YOUR CREATOR
[26:06] &gt;&gt; AND YOU
[26:08] ENEMY.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Everything that is in the in between you
[26:14] &gt;&gt; negligence.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Negligence.
[26:17] uh spiritual amnesia,
[26:20] &gt;&gt; LACK OF FAITH,
[26:22] ALL OF THEM.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; They are enemies of you.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; YOU ought to fight against them.
[26:30] And they have TO FEEL YOUR YOUR SOUL.
[26:34] THEY HAVE TO FEEL HOW can you react?
[26:37] They have to feel the power that you
[26:39] have. The power that YOU HAVE.
[26:42] WE HAVE TO CAST THEM out
[26:44] until we eliminate them.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; So when you're fighting,
[26:52] REMEMBER YOUR PREVIOUS VICTORIES. IT'S
[26:55] GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE strength in THE
[26:57] PRESENT FIGHT.
[26:59] I'VE GOT no shame when I'm fighting
[27:01] against my enemy. I'll tell you such an
[27:04] enemy as I I sight his name. Listen,
[27:09] JUST GO ASK
[27:11] the marijuana that I USED TO SMOKE.
[27:13] WHERE IS IT? WHERE'S cigarette that I
[27:15] USED TO SMOKE?
[27:17] WHERE'S THE BEER THAT I USED TO TAKE?
[27:19] THEY'RE YOUR BROTHERS.
[27:21] GO ASK THEM HOW I OVERCOME THEM. GOD HAS
[27:25] GIVEN ME VICTORY upon all THE DEMONS.
[27:29] Not only on some demons, but God has
[27:31] given me victory upon all demons. You
[27:34] may count them. all the demons.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:43] That's what God is require
[27:46] because to possess the earth.
[27:51] That's the final way.
[27:54] That's the end of our wondering
[27:58] children of Israel.
[28:01] They couldn't enter in the promised
[28:03] landu
[28:05] like refugees
[28:07] or maybe enter at night.
[28:11] If they entered in the promised LAND
[28:13] THAT WAY,
[28:15] THEY couldn't rule upon that that land.
[28:18] But the promise was for them to RULE
[28:20] UPON THAT LAND.
[28:22] THEY HAD TO COME in there being
[28:24] OVERCOMERS
[28:27] to bring down to have control upon
[28:29] everything that was there as the devil.
[28:35] He he he took the the the promised land.
[28:39] How how did they get in that land?
[28:45] They took chance of the absence of the
[28:46] children of ISRAEL
[28:49] when they FALL INTO SLAVERY.
[28:53] WHEN THEY WERE BACKSLIDERS,
[28:56] when they were in sin,
[28:59] when they were in their form,
[29:03] then those robbers, they came and took
[29:05] care of them to take their land.
[29:10] So they illegally based in that LANDED
[29:15] and the devil is HOLDING TO OUR BLESSING
[29:18] ILLEGALLY.
[29:20] [screaming]
[29:20] THE DEVIL IS HOLDING TO OUR VICTORY
[29:22] ILLEGALLY.
[29:25] In meanwhile, THE PROMISE THAT WE HAVE
[29:28] TO POSSESS THE EARTH
[29:31] all the resources that is in the earth.
[29:35] That's our promise.
[29:37] We are to possess everything. If we are
[29:40] children OF GOD,
[29:42] WE ought to possess IT
[29:46] and we are obligated
[29:49] &gt;&gt; to possess it
[29:51] &gt;&gt; if we are children of God.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; So as individual
[30:01] you ought to fight and win the battle
[30:05] before you go further IN YOUR LIFE.
[30:09] A A A BACHELOR
[30:12] before you get married,
[30:17] &gt;&gt; you have to have dominion all the demons
[30:19] that want keep you a bachelor.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying this,
[30:34] &gt;&gt; every country
[30:36] &gt;&gt; has got his own spirit.
[30:39] Do you know that?
[30:42] &gt;&gt; And the Bible is telling us about the
[30:44] prince of darkness.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; They are existing in every country.
[30:49] There's those principles.
[30:52] Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:59] you know, elsewhere in this country to
[31:01] come over
[31:02] when they get to the country,
[31:05] &gt;&gt; there's a president,
[31:07] there's vice president,
[31:10] there's all those administrative until
[31:13] the the mayor of the your area. That's
[31:16] how it is in THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.
[31:20] IF YOU want to rule in the United
[31:22] States,
[31:25] &gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO OVERCOME, you have to
[31:28] overrule all the the princes, all the
[31:30] administrative of this country.
[31:34] And if you want to have a blooming
[31:36] church,
[31:40] we ought to overcome all the demons that
[31:42] are in United States from and especially
[31:46] the demons that are in in Iowa City.
[31:51] We ought to overcome them. And I'll tell
[31:54] you something.
[31:57] If from today we can say
[32:02] we will stop having church here
[32:05] and we will start selling beers.
[32:09] If it was that business, we're going to
[32:12] have a lot of people and this church
[32:14] going to be small. If we just start
[32:17] selling beers,
[32:19] if we put those worldly music,
[32:22] negative women,
[32:24] I'M TELLING YOU, we're going to have
[32:26] MORE MEMBERS.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; BUT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THE WORK OF
[32:31] the Lord,
[32:35] the power of darkness is not happy.
[32:40] But the victory that we have
[32:43] &gt;&gt; is to give him more punch.
[32:46] and to cast him out OF HERE.
[32:49] There's demons who are fighting the work
[32:51] of God. You ought to know it. YOU ought
[32:54] to pray against those demons.
[32:59] And I've seen it with my own eyes in one
[33:01] of the church. I've seen it.
[33:06] You just go in the church.
[33:09] If a church that was flourishing and
[33:11] blooming and at a certain moment
[33:15] You see people start vacating and people
[33:18] no longer coming to church
[33:21] &gt;&gt; and one day we came
[33:24] &gt;&gt; there's a a a daughter of God who enter
[33:26] into SPIRIT
[33:29] and start speaking in tongues
[33:32] you know me the lord there's someone who
[33:34] have done wrong
[33:37] I'm asking my servant to remove the PIT
[33:41] under the pit is something that has been
[33:43] placed
[33:45] Why did they put that thing? AND I
[33:46] PREPARED
[33:48] IS TO BRING DARKNESSES IN THAT CHURCH.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Then we said, what is it?
[33:55] I didn't understand it. What's going on?
[34:02] So we didn't pay attention to that that
[34:04] much. We neglected.
[34:10] After two weeks,
[34:12] the same person speak again in tongues
[34:15] and we neglect it.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; And the following time it was another
[34:20] another person who have seen a vision
[34:23] and I'VE SEEN
[34:25] then people came at night
[34:28] they do some similar ceremonies just
[34:30] remove the pit
[34:33] at the end. Okay, let us just remove the
[34:34] pulpit.
[34:37] When we remove the pit, we found some
[34:38] stuff.
[34:41] Who did it? Demons, the word of God.
[34:45] When we REMOVE ALL THE STUFF.
[34:48] THE FOLLOWING DAY,
[34:51] IT was now a brother WHO ATTENDING THE
[34:52] CHURCH. WE WE THOUGHT HE was our
[34:55] brother.
[34:57] He was just a follower.
[35:00] HE CAME.
[35:02] HE WAS coming there to do his own stuff.
[35:04] No. No. Pray for me. I've got this.
[35:09] Go pray for yourself outside.
[35:14] The guy that you're fighting, you want
[35:15] us to pray him, JUST GO PRAY HOME.
[35:19] HE CRIED UNTIL HE DIED.
[35:22] JUST
[35:24] DEMONS that are fighting the work of
[35:26] God.
[35:29] We want to move FORWARD IN THIS PLACE.
[35:32] THERE'S ANOTHER KINGDOM.
[35:34] THE DARKNESS KINGDOM DOESN'T WANT US TO
[35:36] MOVE FORWARD.
[35:37] WHEN WE NEED LIGHT,
[35:40] HE'S BRINGING US DARKNESS.
[35:42] HE'S GIVING US THE CONTRARY. BUT THE
[35:44] PROMISE THAT WE HAVE
[35:47] &gt;&gt; IS THE PROMISE OF VICTORY.
[35:49] HOW ARE WE GOING TO OVERCOME?
[35:52] WE are to follow the principle of the
[35:53] way.
[36:00] We got to put oursel all the demon that
[36:02] are forbidding us to move forward.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; We all understand it that way
[36:09] &gt;&gt; in this world.
[36:11] We've got our kingdom.
[36:14] And there's also a kingdom of the enemy.
[36:18] Enemy's kingdom is against us and also
[36:20] against OUR KINGDOM.
[36:24] WHEN God gave us the power TO POSSESS
[36:26] THE EARTH,
[36:28] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "NO,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; THE EARTH BELONGS TO ME.
[36:33] IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE EARTH,
[36:35] &gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO SIGN a contract to me."
[36:38] So that's the principle of this world,
[36:41] the powers of darkness
[36:43] that are governing this world. But we
[36:47] are in this world, but we are not of
[36:49] this world.
[36:52] That's why we've got victory.
[36:54] Let him come at night or during the day.
[36:58] The Lord has given us a victory.
[37:04] So when you're praying, PRAY AGAINST
[37:07] PRIESTS and kings of this world because
[37:10] the Bible say we're not fighting against
[37:12] the flesh
[37:13] but we fighting against the spirits
[37:16] that are in her.
[37:19] WE DON'T SEE THEM, but they are there.
[37:25] We want to have a big church, a good
[37:27] church, a flourishing church. So, we are
[37:30] to fight against the devil against IT
[37:34] BECAUSE the devil is not going to leave
[37:35] us walk freely until we GET A VICTORY.
[37:38] NO, WE ARE TO FIGHT against him so that
[37:41] we can have victory.
[37:44] Beloved ones in this world, in this in
[37:47] this country, United States, the spirit
[37:49] that is ruling in this country,
[37:52] &gt;&gt; it's the stubbornness of women,
[37:56] &gt;&gt; rebellion of children,
[38:00] if you want to touch him when you go to
[38:02] school, they teaching those children
[38:06] the right of children,
[38:10] BUT THEY ARE JUDIST, they don't talk
[38:12] about it.
[38:14] They don't talk about the duties of
[38:16] children. This is your right. So where
[38:18] are the juries?
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Where are your judies? What you supposed
[38:23] to do? Nobody's talking about it.
[38:27] When they talking to women, no, this is
[38:29] your right. They can't beat you. They
[38:30] can't DO THIS AND THAT. So which demon
[38:33] IS
[38:35] THE DEMON OF DIVORCE? WHO DOESN'T like
[38:39] couples TO BE STABLE?
[38:42] IF YOU NEED A STABLE COUNTRY,
[38:45] YOU HAVE TO fight against those spirit,
[38:49] you are TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM
[38:52] and screw them around.
[38:57] You're going to have a stable couple.
[39:00] When are you going to have it?
[39:02] After a fight,
[39:05] after a strong fight against demons,
[39:09] then you're going to have your victory.
[39:11] God has given us victory. But we have to
[39:14] fight first
[39:16] to possess.
[39:19] God has given us the earth.
[39:22] But we are to fight
[39:24] in order to possess it
[39:27] because our
[39:31] visit from the the uh promised land to
[39:34] Canaan
[39:36] from this way until we get to heaven.
[39:39] It's only fight and FIGHT AND FIGHT
[39:43] UNTIL WE FIGHT THE FINAL ONE.
[39:46] AND IT'S ALSO IT'S A VICTORY and victory
[39:51] and victory until the last victory until
[39:54] we get to heaven.
[39:56] That's the promise we have. Let us read
[39:59] something
[40:02] in the uh end time message before we
[40:06] pray.
[40:09] We believe in the message.
[40:12] Let everybody forsake the message, but
[40:14] we believe in the message.
[40:19] Let everyone say whatever they want to,
[40:21] but we going to live in the message and
[40:24] we're going TO READ THE MESSAGE. We're
[40:26] going to listen to the MESSAGE
[40:30] until we lose our VOICE TO READ.
[40:33] UNTIL we lose our audition,
[40:38] nothing will set us a sender from the
[40:40] love of God.
[40:42] Nothing will set us a sender from the
[40:44] love that we have for the message.
[40:47] And we're going to read in the message
[40:49] which is concerning us, our father's
[40:51] business. And we are so free.
[40:54] When we read, we we seeing that is GOD
[40:56] SPEAKING TO US. We read it with faith
[40:58] and confidence
[41:01] because we know that is the law of God.
[41:04] Now we're going to read in the name of
[41:05] the Lord Jesus.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; We possessing everything.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Possessing everything of 1962.
[41:25] We're going to read from 56 to 64.
[41:30] Our time is gone. Maybe we'll be
[41:32] skipping
[41:34] &gt;&gt; so that we can have time to pray.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Now listen and pay attention to this.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Listen to the voice of God.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And today
[41:51] the true believer is cast out of people.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; They are treating him as a fanatic.
[42:00] uh holy rollers.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; It's not a prophet who's saying this,
[42:06] but I'm just saying
[42:09] they are calling him a branomist.
[42:13] They calling him bromist to diminish
[42:16] shame
[42:17] to bring shame on him.
[42:21] They calling him names just to insult
[42:23] him.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; A kind of religious fanatics.
[42:29] But regardless of THAT
[42:35] hair of ALL HEAVEN AND EARTH,
[42:38] &gt;&gt; WHO'S A HAIR of heaven and earth?
[42:41] I'm a hair. May God bless us.
[42:51] Blessed are those who are humble in
[42:53] their heart because they got to they
[42:55] will possess the earth. our promise to
[42:57] possess you.
[43:04] You're talking about finding yourself in
[43:06] a little home or SOMEWHERE
[43:12] less money just to pay your rent.
[43:16] Meanwhile,
[43:18] EVERYTHING BELONGS TO YOU.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:26] You ought to work.
[43:29] You have to suffer.
[43:31] And you have to sweat for just some
[43:33] little dollars to earn your life
[43:39] to to to
[43:41] dress up your children
[43:47] and to give them food.
[43:50] And
[43:54] while you possessing,
[44:00] &gt;&gt; you are the hair of everything that IS
[44:02] UPON THE EARTH.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; But those who are humble in their heart,
[44:06] they going to hear possess the earth.
[44:09] They will possess the earth.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; POSSESSORS OF THE EARTH.
[44:19] WHO IS HE?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; He's the believer.
[44:24] A believer has got a title.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; It's got a title DEED
[44:31] IS TRUE
[44:33] &gt;&gt; BY JESUS CHRISTESS
[44:37] who says that the believer will be a
[44:39] possessor of the entire universe.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Those humble in their heart going to
[44:46] possess the earth.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[44:51] could possess this land
[44:55] and everything that was in
[45:00] God has given unto him
[45:04] and Lot who was part of this land.
[45:09] So Abraham had a right to that land
[45:14] and he could claim that right
[45:17] or he could take possession of it. He
[45:19] said now
[45:22] God that has given me a promise
[45:25] that this land and everything that is in
[45:28] belongs to memise. God, you've done a
[45:30] promise to me
[45:32] and my
[45:38] relative has been taken away and
[45:41] everything that belongs to him have been
[45:42] taken.
[45:45] Lord.
[45:50] Behold.
[45:53] In another way, if I could say it,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; the church could say, "Lord,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; God
[46:02] here is my brother is laying down
[46:05] is is is having a cancer
[46:08] &gt;&gt; and Tibi.
[46:11] Now I'm taking the promise.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; It's my possession.
[46:15] It's you who said unto me,
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; You can cast out this enemy.
[46:29] This demon is killed. The same way
[46:31] Abraham killed the kings and bring back
[46:34] what belongs to you. I love that. It's
[46:37] for believers.
[46:39] Now listen.
[46:41] Just pay attention to this place.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Even though Abraham had a promise,
[46:57] &gt;&gt; had a right to a promise and belong to
[46:59] it.
[47:03] TO POSSESS IT. AMEN.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; That's the believer today.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; PAY ATTENTION TO THIS.
[47:14] EVEN THOUGH WE OF EVERYTHING,
[47:19] even though we OF ALL SPIRITUAL
[47:21] BLESSINGS and all physical blessings,
[47:25] he of the promises, I MEAN BLESSINGS
[47:28] promised in the Bible.
[47:31] We should fight to get the the ines of
[47:34] the end.
[47:36] And God has provided IT THAT WAY.
[47:41] GOD IS PROVIDED BY the fight.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; It is always like that.
[47:49] YOU OUGHT TO FIGHT
[47:51] TO POSSESS.
[47:55] You have to fight to possess what
[47:57] belongs to you.
[47:59] YOU OUGHT TO FIGHT
[48:01] TO POSSESS IT.
[48:04] That's what we have to do right now.
[48:08] We have listened to that advice from the
[48:10] prophet. Now we're going to read
[48:13] 108.
[48:16] We're going to skip and read 108.
[48:19] Paragraph 108.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; we there.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to read so that we can
[48:35] pray and close. Pay attention to this is
[48:38] the voice of God.
[48:41] Listen
[48:44] and it's reminding me something that
[48:46] I've lived.
[48:52] If you were the drunkest in the world
[48:58] and your father left behind,
[49:03] whether you are worthy or not,
[49:09] But
[49:12] either you are worthy to be his hair or
[49:14] not.
[49:17] You are the hair of the inheritance OF
[49:20] YOUR FATHER. Whether you are worthy or
[49:23] not, you are the hair of the inheritance
[49:27] of your father. Amen. Amen.
[49:32] Now listen to a story that I lived in my
[49:34] family.
[49:35] My big sister had a child
[49:38] and that child didn't want to go to
[49:40] school.
[49:42] She went in the wrong way. She started
[49:44] drinking. She started doing all those
[49:47] kind of sin.
[49:49] But his father
[49:52] wanted to punish him to to but he was
[49:55] running away from home.
[49:58] But the worst came unto him.
[50:00] But his father wanted to die.
[50:04] He was about to die. He was a a CEO of a
[50:08] energy company. Now he called his son.
