[36:50] message
[36:51] of each church agenda
[37:15] [Music]
[37:20] remember the word of god
[37:24] even spoke la paul de diade to the
[37:27] samaritan woman
[37:31] and he made a statement that's
[37:34] that the jews knew who they were
[37:35] worshiping
[37:40] but he said to the samaritan woman
[37:43] you know not what you're worshiping
[37:48] that that's pretty scary
[37:51] you think that you're worshiping god do
[37:54] this
[37:55] god tells you
[37:58] that your worship is in vain
[38:02] you
[39:13] he said the end time oh my god he said
[39:16] the anti-spirit
[39:18] anti-christ spirit edica less please
[39:21] addicted that already work
[39:25] just like we had the mystery of
[39:27] godliness
[39:33] and that mystery of iniquity is to know
[39:35] that you're doing wrong
[39:39] can you do it anyway
[39:41] hallelujah amen right
[39:44] it was hidden
[39:46] among the traditions of men family
[39:49] tradition
[39:50] hallelujah amen you don't believe me but
[39:53] i'm by god's grace i hope to prove what
[39:55] i'm talking about
[39:59] you see that statement brother branham
[40:01] made way closer
[40:03] he said it places us this this opening
[40:07] of the seven seals
[40:13] [Music]
[40:22] all men's creeds
[40:25] hallelujah
[40:27] he brought in a consciousness
[40:31] god that we did not even know
[41:02] [Music]
[41:05] in the time of adam and eve
[41:07] ever they didn't have to look up to
[41:09] heaven and pray
[41:13] oh y'all understand me let's go for the
[41:15] company because their consciousness
[41:18] their connection
[41:27] [Music]
[41:34] that we speak out don't look along
[41:36] sharing of blood
[41:38] if you show this of a lamb
[41:40] only kane
[41:42] everything enter the fall
[41:47] but now maybe no that the blood has been
[41:50] applied
[41:52] and everything has been restored
[41:57] you and i must move
[41:59] who's your mother
[42:04] [Music]
[42:11] hallelujah amen this is why brother
[42:13] branham
[42:17] [Music]
[42:35] [Music]
[42:42] until
[42:56] uh
[43:08] [Music]
[43:23] you were deceived
[43:40] [Music]
[43:52] that spirit set the street started even
[43:55] in paul's day i'll come and say that
[43:57] they should definitely say i am of
[43:59] cephas for somebody some say i am
[44:02] appalled
[44:05] that's carnal thinking
[44:07] satisfaction there's only one man who
[44:09] died for you
[44:12] jesus christ said
[44:14] and him alone
[44:17] this is why
[44:19] brother branham
[44:23] [Music]
[44:32] he start rubbing us with words that we
[44:34] never
[44:42] the evidence of the holy ghost was
[44:44] speaking in tongues
[45:01] you only believe that because you were
[45:04] taught that
[45:08] the real holy ghost
[45:12] hallelujah
[45:14] but it was not the evidence
[45:21] [Music]
[45:44] you
[46:01] [Music]
[46:10] you must first find out where he is
[46:28] he said you should be able to see christ
[46:33] and if you read the scriptures
[46:52] gave us a true revelation
[47:04] christ mean anointing he is the only one
[47:06] there's not a second holy ghost
[47:17] [Music]
[47:18] so
[47:19] we find where christ is
[47:37] hallelujah amen the word of god said god
[47:40] wants wink that ignorance
[47:42] god does not weaken ignorance anymore he
[47:45] requires
[47:47] do you
[47:48] demand us god will judge us do you
[47:50] evaluate

[48:07] when you don't know god
[48:11] ignorance is in your house when you
[48:14] don't know god
[48:16] says
[48:20] but the hour
[48:22] coming

[48:29] and now he is
[48:31] when the true worshipers
[48:47] yes you're plugged
[48:48] you see what i'm saying
[48:50] even as a man
[48:52] he's saying there's one greater thing

[53:40] amen because god was looking for a woman
[53:45] he was looking for a church
[53:47] he was looking for a bride
[53:50] that would make him

[1:17:24] in uh speaking you know
[1:17:26] brother bannon's message was so
[1:17:28] different
[1:17:30] because he wasn't carrying his own
[1:17:32] message
[1:17:35] he had a message from the father
[1:17:41] and that message came
[1:17:44] in a way that
[1:17:45] the language that only the those who are
[1:17:48] elected will hear
[1:17:50] everything
[1:17:55] you look crazy this morning

[1:19:10] can care about this accusation
[1:19:19] luke 11
[1:19:21] through one through thirteen okay
[1:19:29] i'm a junkie when it comes to the
[1:19:31] anointing so
[1:19:49] that as he was praying in a certain
[1:19:51] place
[1:19:53] when he ceased
[1:19:55] one of his disciples said unto him
[1:19:57] lord teach us to pray as john
[1:20:01] also taught his discipleship
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:16] and he said unto them when ye pray say
[1:20:19] our father
[1:20:21] which art in heaven
[1:20:22] hallowed be thy name
[1:20:24] thy kingdom come
[1:20:26] thy will be done
[1:20:28] as in earth
[1:20:29] so in heaven
[1:20:41] give us this day
[1:20:43] give us day by day our daily
[1:20:55] and forgive us of our sins
[1:20:57] for we also forgive everyone that is
[1:20:59] indebted to us
[1:21:01] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:21:04] deliver us from evil.
[1:21:36] you know it's equivalent to matthew 28
[1:21:38] 19.
[1:21:57] the same scripture let me make it to you
[1:21:59] with no understanding
[1:22:01] repetition
[1:22:03] as if god commanded us to do it come see
[1:22:06] no recommended affair where is it in the
[1:22:09] scripture
[1:22:11] did paul ever tell us to quote it
[1:22:14] you understand me
[1:22:16] it came by way of tradition
[1:22:20] just like just like wearing a cross
[1:22:35] like a tradition where water saves you
[1:22:38] if i get baptized okay okay in the name
[1:22:40] of jesus christ
[1:22:45] not necessarily
[1:22:47] because your salvation is based upon
[1:22:49] your heart conditions
[1:22:54] you can be baptized every day in the
[1:22:56] name of jesus christ
[1:23:04] hallelujah and you know brother branham
[1:23:07] said it like this
[1:23:09] if people would probably repent see with
[1:23:12] me

[1:23:32] it's literally
[1:23:47] with it let's please you're holy

[1:24:02] kingdom come
[1:24:05] thy will be done
[1:24:08] in earth
[1:24:10] as it is in heaven
[1:24:13] what is jesus praying
[1:24:16] to pray
[1:24:18] the prayer
[1:24:19] that the restoration
[1:24:22] restoration of god
[1:24:24] did you in man
[1:24:28] suffer
[1:24:32] as it is in heaven

[1:24:42] daily break

[1:24:58] i am the prayer of the life he says
[1:25:01] hallelujah the church is built upon
[1:25:04] revelations

[1:37:29] this is the invisible union of the
[1:37:31] problem
[1:37:46] hallelujah
[1:37:49] it was the holy ghost that brought us to
[1:37:50] him now the sentence we can use
[1:37:55] it funny
[1:38:00] oh come on somebody
[1:38:04] and she becomes one with isaac
[1:38:12] riding the camel
[1:38:14] or in the tent with
[1:38:29] excuse me
[1:38:30] y'all quiet
[1:38:32] it was in the tent with isaac
[1:38:41] okay i i feel y'all putting brakes on me
[1:38:43] now but i'm gonna tell you something
[1:38:44] think about what i just said
[1:38:48] i didn't take away from the holy ghost
[1:38:52] because i brought you to the man who
[1:38:53] sent the holy ghost
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:10] amen and while she was in the tent with
[1:39:13] isaac
[1:39:15] she was no longer saying no
[1:39:18] and exactly i think
[1:39:20] eliezer was so great
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:36] isaac was whispering secrets
[1:40:18] this man who was supposed to be a
[1:40:20] christian said don't be the veteran
[1:40:21] carried some kind of statue with him
[1:40:26] and he said well if this don't work
[1:40:30] i think the fire or something he said
[1:40:32] what this will
[1:40:46] but let me tell you like this
[1:40:48] there's a lot of message people who are
[1:40:50] idolaters and don't even know
[1:40:58] they don't even know it you know and as
[1:41:01] soon as you try to help him
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:30] but there are some of us who steal yeah
[1:41:35] i'm not even catching what brother
[1:41:36] branham told us to catch he says this
[1:41:38] man passed against him
[1:41:40] himself he was introducing jesus christ
[1:41:57] he did just what john the baptist did
[1:42:00] they can come here
[1:42:02] to jesus christ
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:12] amen
[1:42:14] the bible says and i'm closing the
[1:42:16] people
[1:42:18] know ye not
[1:42:20] that you are the temple of god
[1:42:27] hello
[1:42:28] come on
[1:42:30] it ain't the church you go to
[1:42:32] the public you are the temple
[1:42:37] let me go on down to this and i'm gonna
[1:42:39] close
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:05] why
[1:43:06] because they were using his temple
[1:43:08] for the wrong
[1:43:34] and they can just drive and they find
[1:43:36] cars and everything else
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:46] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:43:48] a preacher should never live higher than
[1:43:50] his people
[1:43:53] if his people power he should live paul
[1:43:57] if he's preaching if his people rich he
[1:43:59] can live rich
[1:44:04] that's
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:11] even the prophet god said it like this
[1:44:14] he said how is it
[1:44:16] in the new testament church
[1:44:32] now
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:45] don't tell mr truth i have to be careful
[1:44:47] let me probably have to be careful
[1:44:50] because i can do the hollywood thing
[1:44:52] basketball should show us the hollywood
[1:45:00] i can do it
[1:45:02] i've come through it
[1:45:03] it's just faith
[1:45:05] i was an apostolic preacher
[1:45:12] listen have you ever seen one on tv
[1:45:43] and if i go somewhere and and you know
[1:45:45] it calls for an evangelistic type of
[1:45:47] preaching
[1:45:52] evangelist
[1:45:56] uh
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:24] they had
[1:46:38] you are the musicians uh who was it
[1:46:40] natural that's why i made something i'm
[1:46:43] telling you some plan of some altos
[1:46:50] listen equity
[1:46:52] when they were hiding from the romans
[1:46:57] the early church do you say do you think
[1:46:58] that bring all your instruments
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:09] they knew how to reverse and sing
[1:47:12] in a way that the anointing would just
[1:47:14] move
[1:47:20] but they were fire
[1:47:24] i understand fire don't have to make
[1:47:25] noise
[1:47:28] fire can be quiet
[1:47:32] but there's some fire that would it
[1:47:34] can't make noise too man
[1:47:38] but you understand me
[1:47:40] but traditions make us feel the
[1:47:42] traditions on face and take up see if
[1:47:44] the people are not just so emotional
[1:48:12] and all i get is a wall
[1:48:14] then i know nobody's pulling
[1:48:44] and and uh to a saints house
[1:48:49] on they were breaking tradition
[1:48:54] did you all know that yes they were
[1:48:56] breaking tradition
[1:48:58] because under the law they couldn't pray
[1:49:00] like this
[1:49:03] priesthood could pray
[1:49:07] only the priesthood they only they were
[1:49:08] the ones who handled the lambs
[1:49:22] without all the ceremonies
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:54] the people gathering
[1:49:57] their confidence was in the people
[1:49:58] gathering yeah yeah yeah
[1:50:05] no yeah
[1:50:50] first of all she was praying without him
[1:50:53] remember
[1:50:54] she didn't go by the way of the priest
[1:50:57] she had her own prayer meeting
[1:51:00] you understand me
[1:51:03] and so god
[1:51:04] honored her
[1:51:10] and somehow levi eli caught her
[1:51:13] attention she caught eli's attention
[1:51:19] and the guy who was supposed to be the
[1:51:22] priest
[1:51:24] more than likely hadn't seen the spirit
[1:51:26] move in so long
[1:51:31] he thought she would draw
[1:51:37] [Music]
[1:51:44] and i've got something weighing heavy on
[1:51:47] me
[1:51:48] i need god to answer this prayer
[1:51:51] hallelujah yeah you understand me uh why
[1:51:55] god use a woman
[1:51:57] she represents the bride fascinating
[1:52:03] and she she went to god in prayer alone
[1:52:06] and let her deliver you and prayer god
[1:52:09] answered her prayers
[1:52:11] and gave her a prophecy
[1:52:28] i guess this is what they call drawing
[1:52:29] it out it's your past secondly
[1:52:33] but i'll always think about that woman
[1:52:35] with the issue of blood vegeta
[1:52:41] what what was it that the priest
[1:52:43] couldn't help them
[1:52:47] they had the ability to heal you know
[1:52:50] through sacrifices
[1:52:54] or travel
[1:52:55] sacrifices
[1:52:57] but she knew the priest in that area
[1:52:59] couldn't heal her
[1:53:00] man
[1:53:06] all those years she was sick
[1:53:09] she wasn't dead
[1:53:12] hallelujah
[1:53:14] but when she heard about jesus
[1:53:18] let me tell you something everything
[1:53:20] this message it's a message it's the
[1:53:22] only thing
[1:53:24] that can heal
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:39] will give you an issue of blood vapor
[1:53:42] don't need it y'all understand me no
[1:53:44] power in it
[1:53:47] but there's only power in the blind

[1:54:56] i couldn't find the parents and i
[1:54:57] couldn't find
[1:54:59] him in trouble
[1:55:05] so god's grace was on that little
