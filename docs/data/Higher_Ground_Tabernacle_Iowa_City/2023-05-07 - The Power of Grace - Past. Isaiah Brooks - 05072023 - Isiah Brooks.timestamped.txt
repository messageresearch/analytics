[1:00:25] number of them was Ten Thousand Times
[1:00:28] Ten thousands and thousands of thousands

[1:00:43] saying with a loud voice Worthy is the
[1:00:47] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:00:50] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:00:54] and glory and blessings
[1:01:07] and every creature which is in heaven

[1:01:18] honor and glory and power be unto him
[1:01:21] that seated upon the throne and upon the
[1:01:24] lamb forever and ever again
[1:01:43] and the four

[1:02:34] service in a special way
[1:02:39] be careful give me the Praise
[1:02:44] Jesus Christ
[1:02:47] amen amen you may be seated
[1:02:57] you know my my subject this morning is
[1:03:00] the is the power of Grace
[1:03:07] that may not sound
[1:03:10] uh message to you
[1:03:14] it may not even sound deep to you okay
[1:03:19] but in my walk with Jesus Christ
[1:03:24] come to find out
[1:03:26] that Grace is a revelation
[1:03:30] Revelation and true Grace
[1:03:34] will bring you to your knees
[1:03:39] let me say that again
[1:03:41] true Grace
[1:03:44] revelation of Grace
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:54] when we think about the open book
[1:03:58] or the opening of the word
[1:04:02] we must come to understand
[1:04:06] that God has taken us to another level
[1:04:11] we're not on the level of the
[1:04:13] Pentecostals
[1:04:16] but God has moved us into the headstone
[1:04:20] Ministry
[1:04:24] where not only do we have the ability
[1:04:29] to understand the New Testament
[1:04:33] but we Now understand the Old Testament
[1:04:38] and we have come to find out
[1:04:41] that the god of the Old Testament is
[1:04:44] the god of the news Hallelujah
[1:04:50] and the only way we have come to see
[1:04:52] this is
[1:04:55] because the grace of God
[1:04:58] came to this generation
[1:05:02] in the form of a man called William
[1:05:04] Brothers
[1:05:09] now many people may not be able to
[1:05:14] understand that
[1:05:17] but God always work through men
[1:05:21] whenever he wants to do something
[1:05:26] he works through men
[1:05:29] for example for example in the days of
[1:05:33] Noah
[1:05:34] when God wanted to show
[1:05:37] Grace
[1:05:39] to a wicked age
[1:05:41] he raised up a man
[1:05:46] by the name of Noah
[1:05:49] and Noah had the Plan
[1:05:52] of Salvation
[1:05:55] Noah no way was the only one
[1:05:59] that had the plan he ever LeBlanc
[1:06:03] of salvation
[1:06:07] when Israel needed the Deliverance
[1:06:11] out of Egypt
[1:06:14] God raised up a man
[1:06:17] by the name of Moses
[1:06:21] not only did Moses have the power of
[1:06:24] Supernatural
[1:06:27] but he had the only plan
[1:06:30] to Salvation
[1:06:33] hallelujah amen Pharaoh didn't have it

[1:07:21] death angel passed
[1:07:23] hallelujah amen now when I talk about
[1:07:27] the power of His grace
[1:07:31] because Grace
[1:07:33] really is an action word
[1:07:37] it is something that God do for us
[1:07:42] by definition
[1:07:44] they said the unmerited favor
[1:07:48] of God and when God brings grace to you
[1:07:54] he acts it out
[1:07:58] Hallelujah he just doesn't drop
[1:08:01] the word grace in your head
[1:08:09] but he acts it out
[1:08:12] so much
[1:08:14] you know it's Grace
[1:08:17] Hallelujah whatever goodness
[1:08:30] and the power of Grace

[1:08:44] is that right is it correct you say what
[1:08:46] are you talking about

[1:08:50] found a woman caught in adultery
[1:08:55] Hallelujah
[1:08:57] wanted to kill her
[1:09:01] grace stepped in
[1:09:04] you hear what I'm saying
[1:09:07] he was worthy of death
[1:09:12] but God I like that
[1:09:16] but God stepped in
[1:09:19] hallelujah amen and he wrote on the
[1:09:22] ground
[1:09:23] see what I'm saying
[1:09:26] that Grace
[1:09:30] whatever the grace is given to you
[1:09:34] they sometimes stand in awe
[1:09:38] in bewilderment
[1:09:43] it's hard for them to believe
[1:09:47] that they have escaped the situation the
[1:09:50] quack is
[1:09:52] because they know they should meet death
[1:09:57] to meet life
[1:09:59] Hallelujah I don't know about you
[1:10:03] I just know where God brought me from
[1:10:17] [Music]

[1:11:12] hallelujah amen now remember
[1:11:15] Grace is not always given to everybody
[1:11:19] Hallelujah is that right when the when
[1:11:22] when the Ark of the Covenant
[1:11:26] was founded uh captured by the
[1:11:29] Philistines God said I take up to Europe
[1:11:35] y'all hear what I'm saying wait a second

[1:15:13] took to another level 11 by faith
[1:15:18] on a higher planes
[1:15:23] and the reason how it did that
[1:15:26] he had to bring me low
[1:15:43] in Heavenly places

[1:15:51] here

[1:15:56] that every honor
[1:15:59] hour
[1:16:07] they had ever received
[1:16:11] in this life
[1:16:14] goes to the lamb
[1:16:18] you know what I'm saying

[1:17:46] right
[1:17:49] I did nothing
[1:17:51] nothing to receive it yeah
[1:17:55] I'm experiencing right now it's because
