that we all understand each other may God bless you for that and I also thank the church for the trust that you put in me it has not been given to everybody and I don't know why you put this trust in me and I also give you my trust in return and I'm waiting for the the good time so I can talk to the church it's not the good time yet I don't have enough things to say for now and I will all ask you to stand and we will read the Holy scriptures open our Bible in the book of Isaiah chapter 6 verse one all the way to verse 8 and the year the king died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple the SF above it stood the sarapin each one had six wings with TW he covered his face and with twin he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I who is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the serpant unto me having a live ho in his hands which he had taken from the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go before us then said hi here I am send me let's all pray our heavenly father with reverence we come before you and humility of heart we want to commit into your presence and to give you our hearts because we came to this place so you could speak to us and here we are in this place your Prophet taught us and said that you come 30 minutes before the meeting place and here father we trust that you were already here before us now take the POS have the possession of the lips of the human and take in control the ears the ears that's going to hear and circumcise every Hearts that's going to listen we want this word to assist every one of us that it helps help us take away all our sin help us help us become better Christians than yesterday all of this for your glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may regain your seat this morning we're going to talk about influences preached a lot in the message influenceu in some other place he titled it influences in some other place he titled it influence in singular in other places he titled it the influence of another it's a message he's been preaching since the 50s and he even preached the same message in the 54 in 1954 and that's what we we're going to talk about today because we're not going to be here next Sunday so when we come back for the following Sunday we're going to talk about the influence of the parents to their toward their children so according to how that the Lord is going to help us and we just commit oursel to the Holy Ghost for this so the word influence the dictionary [Music] says that the word influence means it's an General action that continues that acts upon somebody or some something so for example you have the the influence of the of the the weather on on the vegetation you also the you have the influence of television on on on the youth that's the dictionary is and in English it said that the word influence the capacity to have an effect on a character or a [Music] development or the behavior of someone or something or sometimes the effect of itself is the influence now we're going to talk about how we influence other [Music] people the following Sunday we're going to talk about the influence that the parents have toward their children but for this morning we're going to talk about the influence that as that that an individual has toward another individual now the prophet in the anywhere [Music] else he mentioned a lot Isaiah chapter 6 where he read and he finishes with 2 Chronicle chapter where they was talking about King oah whenas was living the Bible says King goah had the privilege to have pure [Music] parents because he had Pious parents it gave him an advantage to the point that he was raised after the law of the Lord now the Bible tells us that in his life oah he did what was right in the in the eyes of the [Music] Lord and the Bible says he did just like his father and what didah the Bible says that he tried to find God throughout the life of Zak and he sought God in the days of Zakaria who had understanding in the vision and as long as he sought the Lord God made him to prosper so the prophet is showing to us he says that the advantage that hoseah because he was born from the parents who fear the lord so he was raised after the the word and so it made that lived for his child to the point that the child acted just like his father the best thing he [Music] did was that he started looking for the face of God during the days of Zaria prophet and God made him to prosper and if I don't see anything I don't see this Prosperity that comes outside of God oiah was prosperous because he applied his heart to seek after God search after God like his father did but that's not what we're going to talk about today I just wanted to show you what we're going to talk about the following Sunday now look because we're going to talk about something now let's go little by little the prophet says the young prophet Isaiah saw the influence that if you read second 26 you're going to see that he became a King when he was 16 and when he was 16 or in that age 16 the child became king and he will sat upon the throne and the prophet says listen to what he says in the serman influences he says now listen we saw that it was the same with this child this boy as he had his P parents I'm in the sermon uh the influence preaching 1964 paragraph 22 he says this because he had those Pious Spirit he did what was right once he became King when he was 16 years old he ignored all the politics and the popular opinions of his day and served god with reverence that made him a real king to IGN the politics and the modern opinion and serve god with reverence that was very good his kingdom God blessed it was so [Music] great it was next to Solomon so his kingdom came right after Solomon Solomon had the greatest that ever was but this boy was next to Solomon and the prophet says was a great help to the young prophet Isaiah and being a young child at that time and just coming on Isaiah was born a prophet he was observing the influence that this man had on people and he saw where this influence came from he saw where the influence of came from the prophet says that it was that he he had a full trust in God and he noticed [Music] Isaiah God will bless those who will stay who will trust the Lord what does the prophet want to say here he says that Isaiah noed that the king had a great influence on people and he noticed that his great influence on people came from the fact that he put his full trust in God he noticed that and what did he notice the prophet he noticed [Music] again God blesses those that remain faithful to his word because that's what happened to O remain faithful to the word and that's why God [Music] blessed God made his kingdom [Music] prosperous and he built so much of a great Kingdom tell to the point that there was peace everywhere the Bible says he had in his kingdom he was the first king to bring an engineer the first engineer that created Canon powdered weapon he made big things to the point that his people loved him so much and his influence on people were great was great now brother bream says this exactly what Isaiah saw isah had a great influence in the life of Isaiah notice that Isaiah was a [Music] prophet but someone else had an influence on his life him who was a he influenced the life of a prophet amen amen let's be together let's not be in the cold leave the cold do it job we do ours now listen this the prophet [Music] says we realize that this young fellow wanted to stay with the principles of of what God Said So that was his biggest worry he wanted that every time he wanted to steal with the principles of God [Music] and he kept his the laws of God the Bible says what the prophet says wouldn't turn right or left he stayed right with what the word said and God honored him blessed him in everything he done prospered he went right on what an example that is for for any young person so if we want to be prosperous today if we want to be great if we want to have blessing the only thing that we got to is to act like desire remained faithful to the word of God he remained faithful to that word he did not turn right or left exactly like like God told J he said joshu my servant rise up cross this Jordan with your people observe the law of my servant [Music] Moses the law that I give to Israel in or he said that let the never leaves your mouth meditate it every day night because it's in that time that you will succeed in everything you will do God was exhorting Joshua to meditate upon the law of Moses he said that it's the book of the law let this book of the law never turn away from your mouth so what has to come out of our mouth is the word of God and what we have to is to meditate on this word every day and night he said that it's in that time at that moment that you so our success is not produced from whatever our success depends on the way on the way we meditate on the word of God that's where our success remains we meditate it every day and night because it's in that time that you will succeed and everything you will do did I not tell you that have courage do not fear strengthen yourself and have courage because I will be with you as I was with Moses God was speaking to joshu he was fortifying he was telling him that the same God who was with Moses will be with him as long as he meditates on that word every day and night it's at that moment that he will succeed now us as well Brothers God has lived so much with the prophet he done great things with the prophets and the world is aware of it's It's aware that God worked with brother BR now the problem is us we that come after as the people of what Have We Become we need Victory we need success where will the success come from it will only come if we meditate the law of Moses today is the message of the hour meditate on the word meditate on the message every day night it's in that moment that you will succeed brother brother says he says I think if we had people today our churches who claim to be Christians if they would abrain from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it would influence the younger Christians to do so if our churches claim to be Christian churches if they would abrain from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it would influence the younger Christians to do so but today when they let down drink and smoke and Carry On and still try to hold their confession as Christian as Christianity that puts it puts a bad stumbling block in other people's way big issue that we have today we fail in our lives we fail in what we do and when we do it not with notwithstanding we keep saying that we're Christians you are Christian I'm baptized with the spirit of God not knowing that what we were doing the young Christians children among in in your midst we're placing a stumbling block in their Christian Life and we're going to block them from living a Christian Life That's why in the days that are coming or in the Sunday the following Sunday we're going to talk about the influence of the parents towards the children so the parents know they have a heavy duty to live the word of God not just for God not just for themselves but because of their children as well so because of my children I will live the word of God because you know my brothers at a certain age you have to become responsible and we tell ourselves that this thing I can't do that thing because of my children what you know Pastor was given an example and saying he was saying the the age that I'm at you guys are believers of my truth as he was saying now one day I was I was jogging I'm Excuse me that I give this example and as I was jogging I wanted to yeah I I wanted to use the restroom somewhere in the in the in the the woods and at a certain time something came in in myself I told myself it's a natur natural desire now what would happen if I would just on the road and I would see someone that says good morning Pastor what kind of an image would I give to that person he said even if that need was so pressing I because I have to live to a Time sense of responsibility KN I have people to whom I'm so I can't just do whatever because there are people who are looking and they need an influence from me and that's why as parents you have a heavy responsibility to not live the word just for God not just for yourself also for your children you said for this thing that thing right there I can't do this because of my young boy because of my daughter I can't fall in this thing what will my children when they will hear that I did what would my children become so we have to live to in a way knowing that there are people that need people that need an influence from us and when we can't give them that good influence placing a big stumbling block in their Christian Life and the prophet said that we will respond answer for this because you blocked someone from living a Christi because of your life that's why I I was with a couple young ones with whom I was living with excuse me I'm going to give this this other example every time I would go to a restroom you know how kids would de you you see that the rest he didn't clean up he just left everything like that and every time you go there you have to flush you have to crush at but you know in the toilets over there you got to get water from somewhere and every time I was telling so how do you live like that why do you do that I was telling oh you're you're 16 or 18 years old the other one is probably 23 how can you live like that I was telling them I they they asked them one day if you see me go to a restaurant and that you saw me do exactly what you what kind of an image would you have of me you won't respect me but why can you do this you're aware that it's not a good thing to do so there are some things that at certain age you can't do this anymore kids it won't be a problem you can't do this that's why we always have to live accordingly to say that Lord what I'm about to do what kind of an influence would that give if people see me do this what would they say about what would they say of me what I'm doing closer to you or push him away from you those are the questions we need to ask ourselves and the prophet says that when you have something that you're about to do and that you have a lot of doubts in your heart so don't do it but do we have Christians who that still ask themselves questions like that what I'm about to do can that bring someone closer to my way my way of neighbors with my sisters and my brothers can that bring someone closer to what kind of an influence would I have in someone else's life if you could ask yourself those questions this church will be a church on fire it will be a different Church the prophet says we have people our churches that claim to be Christian if they would upam from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it will influence the younger Christians to do so but today when they lay down and drink and smoke and carry on still try to hold their confession as Christianity brother says it puts a bad stumbling block in other people's life and it makes it even very hard because you forget brothers that we are living beings we're living script we're living Epistles of all men the prophet says in this sermon the world tired to read the Bible if I asked anybody who read his Bible I don't I'll have five five hands the world is tired of reading the Bible why are they tired because the life that the Bible is talking about they're no longer seeing it in people that's why they're tired and the prophet says it says they're tired of reading the Bible but they because they're expecting to read living BBL that are men living the word instead of reading the Bible That's why brother bream says live me a sermon instead of preaching a seron because we have to reflect of what we say we have to be living beings Epistles read can read because the Bible the Bible itself are Pap it doesn't run but we don't need dead letters we need a a living B and how can the Bible live it's going to live in our hearts in our lives when the people of the world will see us they can know that God does not accept sin God does not love adultery they'll see that God doesn't like smoking they'll see that God doesn't like drinking why because they did not read it in the Bible because they faced someone to all the Temptations went through but they could not take him The Temptations could not take he did not smoke you know the environment influences people that's what they saying just notice in our life how we were living when we were in Africa a lot of parents know what we talk what I'm talking about now look how we have become here in this country country of pharaoh where we work as slaves the devil gives us so much time to to be at work you want to have a beautiful car you got to go work so because you want to have a a c to impress somebody else you got to work harder you want to have a beautiful home to impress somebody else go work harder and you're going to work like that without resting you're you're gonna get tired when you get home you don't even pray you eat you sleep the next day you wake up again same cycle and it's going to keep on going like this we're a church that's expecting the rapt the Rapture will occur in those conditions and you're going to go in there it's a demonic system the devil knew what he was doing and you need need to be spiritual people to understand that this is unacceptable you have to free yourself now you see people today they have big cars they have big homes but they don't have time to sleep at home what would that home do to you what what does it what good is it if it if you don't have time with children the father is always always gone what would it do to you I I'm about to buy a home too but I told you last time that I'm not going to buy a home to impress somebody else I'm going to buy a home according to what God gives me so I can live in that house and enjoy that home with my little family sometimes we do things and we don't understand did God tell you to buy that house at that price is that God tell you to buy that house at that price nope we do things from ourselves and it's those things that are putting us in prison you don't know how to set yourself free you don't know how to travel anymore because the time to travel oh no no no I can't I can't travel I I won't I will miss all the money set yourself free let's live our life in the way that God wants us to don't impress anybody and this church will go forward so I will try to finish too quick this just like an introduction for today and we're going to develop on this another day the following we we are living Epistles read of all men and a lot of people don't want to read the Bible anymore and brother bam says it says that we have to think about it tonight why the pagans don't want to read the Bible anymore he says because every man every woman every boy and every girl know that there comes a judgment you might skip this that or the other you might beat the the income tax IRS IRS brother talked about IRS can try to escape all the taxes brother you might beat the income tax so that you don't pay it you might beat the income tax and you might esip the internal revenue you might do one thing or another he [Music] says you might have run over the speed limits and the cops never catch you but one [Music] day judment is going to catch you I'm I'm guilty too because they've already pulled me over by the cops I exceeded the speed limit and I promised that I wouldn't do it again so when they preach the word we preach it to ourselves I'm also going I'm going toward perfection I also want to go to heaven and I'm trying to make efforts because I never read this so you that heard it today as a Christian when they wrote 70 they they can allow you to go to 75 don't go to 80 don't go to 100 says if the cops did not CCH you today but the Judgment of God will catch you so there is a God who's watching you there's an eye that's watching even if the eye of the world is not seeing you there's an I watching you now you did your thing you stole from IRS you didn't pay here next year you do the same thing because today Christians kill conscious conscious to be Christians so you can find yourself in but you still claim that you are a Christian so you just heard brother say if you didn't hear it before that's something else but brother said it here you try to beat the to steal you know how you do it yourself you know how you always do it but the Judgment of God will catch you you might Escape today but the Judgment of God will catch you so we have to live in a way that our life has an influence on somebody else he says you see the influence that you're will obligate you to [Music] respond for the many Souls that you have put us turned that you turned as side away from Christ The Influence that that you will make you respond so put yourself in the balance ask what influence does your life produce in somebody else's life you keep turning people away from the Christ you keep turning away from the Life of Christ you will enter I think it behooves us tonight to think see Judgment of God will catch us it's certain brother says it's certain and we know that man must die and after that the Judgment death is not a hard thing it's the Judgment after death that's the bad part and there what you've done on life and how you've influenced others that day you'll have to answer for it in that day the prophet says it clearly I don't know if the prophet is not clear here but the prophet is very clear on this subject now let's look in our lives let's see what the things that we do that cannot bring people closer to God let's reject those things Paul says satisfy the the the the bird the burdens that beset [Music] us let's reject set us put aside the the the burdens that set and let's have our our eyes fixed toward Christ him who is the consumer of our faith yes my so everything we do that does not bring people closer to God Christ let's let's set set them aside let's put them aside and Christ obligates us he obligates he calls for Holiness he oblig he asks us to respect his word he obligates us to live in a way that that people find him through US yes my brothers I would love to say this I'm gonna read this then maybe we'll finish from today for today and we'll come back maybe next Sunday how we should think on them things friends sternly and reverently as we see this day approaching and knowing that anytime your life's Pages the book may be closed tonight and tomorrow it be too late for you for you to do it don't put off what you can do today for tomorrow for tomorrow may never come it may never come men and women boys and girls maybe sitting here [Music] tonight will be in the morg before daylight it's true and then your book is closed and you'll never have another chance this may be the last chance that you'll ever have think of it seriously you say Well it probably isn't probably isn't but it could be but it could be remember someday the book is going to be closed what you are doing now now he says especially you people who are claiming to be Christians separate your from the things of the [Music] world have nothing to do with the world sh it for some person is watching you somebody's watching you you're going to not only send yourself there you're going to take them to the bad place and you're going to have to answer for your influence youve heard the prophet enough this morning who said that every one of us we have the right to live the word of God so that our life prints an influence on somebody watch on what we do that's not the word come before God In Prayer let's ask God Lord I'm I'm guilty I want you to assist forgive me for everything I've I want you to give me another chance I promise that I'll be a better
