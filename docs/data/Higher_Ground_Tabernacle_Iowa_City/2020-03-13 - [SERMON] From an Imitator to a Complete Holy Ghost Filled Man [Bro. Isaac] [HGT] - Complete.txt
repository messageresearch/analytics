oh man [Music] and when God bless you it's good have been the house of the Lord man we're so happy to be here tonight you thank everybody for coming so without taking much time we can stand with the Bible so we were hoping we open the Bible in the book of first Corinthians chapter 13 so we will read the entire chapter I think I believe he only has 13 verses so we're trying to read the entire chapter first Corinthians chapter 13 it's a familiar scripture talking about charity the verse first verse the Bible says there was speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am becoming I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling a tinkling cymbal and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is puffed up i mean is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth or in other versions he says that you Richard he rejoiced with the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endure all things charity never faileth but whether there be no prophecy whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now by it now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity amen let's go back to Ezekiel chapter 36 really Ezekiel chapter 36 we read on verse 22 the 22nd verse to the 27th Ezekiel 36 Isaiah chapter 36 verse 22 to 27 the Bible says therefore say under the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not this for your sakes over house of Israel but for my own name's sake which he have profaned among the heathen whither he went and I was sanctified my great name which was profaned among the Eden which ye have profaned in the maze of them and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for I would take you from among the even and gather you out of the countries and will bring you into the into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you now verse 26 that's the one we want to focus on and 27 the Bible says 26 and no heart also will I give you and a new spirit without pool within you and I will take away the stony heart out of out of your flesh and I will give you an and heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my Commandments and do them amen let's bow our head before the Lord dear Jesus Lord we thank you for your grace in your mercy Lord we thank you Father God for this privilege father Lord - as mortal father God - come in the presence of the Almighty God Lord Jesus Christ we humbly father God come before you and ask you Jesus Christ to speak O Father Lord Lord Jesus take me out of the way Lord Jesus and speak to your people or bless their heart or father the way that we're here and bless Oh father Lord Jesus Christ everybody Lord Lord we ask you to take the first place to pray - Lord Jesus Christ come on Ord and deliver father guy your word to your people Lord and at the end of the service Lord Jesus will not miss to say thank you thank you for everything that you have done and thank you for everything that you are doing now and thank you for everything that you would do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated so tonight I have a little thought that I'd like to share with you and if I can Title II it'll be from an imitator to a complete Holy Ghost field man so we still you know with the same the same thought that we were dealing on last Friday before the youth meetings about the faith faith in God and tonight where we're trying to change a little bit the angle and bring you to a journey from an imitator to a complete - accompli holy spirit filled man so the verse that we read in Corinthians chapter 13 the Bible is very clear saying that I might have all the gift that is in the Bible my F I might have everything written in the Bible but if I don't have charity which charity is the Holy Spirit which the Holy Spirit's God if I don't have that you know all the things that I might do is in vain am I even you know it goes even farther saying that I might give my own body to be burned for my brother or I might give all my gift or all my money everything that I do have for somebody else but if I don't have charity or if I don't have the love of God inside of me all those good things that all those good things that are we trying to do or that I would like to do for somebody else it doesn't mean anything you know that that shows that you know therefore the most important thing that we need to have is charity is the Holy Spirit and then that's why I said from an imitator to a complete holy spirit filled man you know that the verse in the chapter in Corinthians you know shows the somebody who doesn't have charity and who is trying to do all those work he only is trying to imitate what the Holy Spirit what the product of the Holy Spirit would do and that means basically and it clearly saying that you know if you don't have charity though you would try to imitate all those things that would mean nothing not mean nothing to you because we see that when God created the man he put inside of the man of thirst and the thirst it put a thirst to look for God they put in every man though you may be Christian or not though you may be a message believer or not though you may be a child or anybody else in this earth God when he created you he put inside of you our thirst and that thirst can only be filled or that thirst can only be completed by God himself but now we see the devil seeing the power of the threat of the thirst that is inside of a man seeing the power of that thirst goes something for sure that if you have that thirst inside of you that first which way will push you or where do we we push you to go look for God to go look for more God and the devil seeing the power of that thirst out that thirst of God is leading people to Calvary of how the thirst of God is leading people to receive more Christ of how the thirst of God is leading people you know to have more crushing them you know he saw that power of the thirst and then he started not to create things to shut that thirst off it started not to create things to you know to like to satisfy the thirst that's what we see that people always trying to imitate or we see that people always trying to do something you know to try to imitate the things and we see that thing started in the beginning in Genesis we see that when and when Adam and Eve what were created by God and you know God put God gave them you know God created them and he made them in a certain way and then he told them you know they're the eyes was blind they couldn't see their nakedness you know they couldn't see any evil you know everything was perfect everything was loved and everything wasn't our money and the Bible says that in evening you know God was coming to fellowship with them and in evening I was coming to to have a communion with them but we see that after the fall we see Adam you know realizing that he was naked and we see Adam realizing who it was and we see Adam his eyes now being opened you know it went and he tried to hate him see try to hide himself and when he was hiding you know the devil came and it could ever forgive him you know an idea of imitating what God was doing what he did was that he took the fig leaf and then it tried to hide is you know his nudity or his run and hide is his nakedness because we see that in the beginning when they were created God hided their nakedness they couldn't see themselves Nick naked but when they fall went after the fall you know the devil came and he trying to be you know he told you know it try to help him to create a religion or he trying to help him to imitate what God was doing but he did that didn't not work out you know God came down and he asked them cuz the thing is that when we try to create something that is not original or one we're trying to create something that is not from God nothing will not last you know what that thing will have an end that thing were you know we're one day nothing will perish one day that thing you know you have to move into another level that's the same thing with Adam when he created that religion with the fig leaves you know what they forgot that you know that fig leaves will wither now filled lives you know hasn't handed that fig leaves you know after the for now that fig leaves had an end you know one day you know it will wither and the one day we will try to create another thing but when God came we know what what God did for us and what God did for them you know he killed the lamb to make you know and to make a sacrifice and you forgive the sin and then we are last Friday when we were talking we took we so we took the story of ETO of Isaac with our Jacob and I so we see that Jacob was trying to imitate that what it was doing Jakub when when God went he arrived at the time of blessing we see that Jacob you know was trying to imitate that's why he went and it took the court of his brother because it dad was going to know who it was is that what's going to smell him and they died was going to say that this is not in so by its Jacob you know that's how we have the some other people that want the experience to be schooled you know they want to be schooled or they want experience to be school you know that will not happen you know you cannot you cannot miss you can your experience cannot be schooling to you you know it's something that is to be real it's something that is to come inside of your life inside of you that needs to produce those experiences so you try to imitate something or try to fake something or try to impersonate something doesn't help because one day it'll come to an end one day it'll have to stop and then we see that Jacobs thought that he said only you know after going to his father after lying that he was it so he thought that everything was fine and everything was settled but after years after you know he found himself in trouble he finally said about what tells us that ISA was coming to Jacob with 400 armed men you know with 400 men that was powerful than him and there were you know they were going to kill him and they were you know we didn't say that you know today is the last day you know we're going to kill him but after that after he realized that you know schooling experiences or or imitating doesn't help me he had to go look for the face of God he had to go look for God he had to go look for the genuine God we see that in the Bible explains that you know first as a man you know he tried to create to have his own you know to have his own ways how out to get out of the situation you know he divided his group he divided his servants he divided everybody that he was with him but you know after that at the end of the day he understood that that was not going to help him he understood that you know the only thing that was going to happen was a personal relationship with God he understood that the only thing I was gonna help him it was the person he wants to know God personally not to know God by what my mother has told me not to know God by what my father has told me not to know God by what my dad my wife and my pastor has told me but to make God personally to have an own experience my own experience with God that I can say that's from that time you know girl from dad's and from that experience from meeting God in that place for meeting God in that time my experience has changed my life has changed and Jacob you know he had those experiences you know he had experiences that was cool to him by his mother you know his mother was telling him what that was right his mother was telling him you know the story how you know God told his father to you know by God or his grandfather to get out of this land and to go you know to a land where God will show him you know he had all those experiences his mother told him how his father was born by faith his mother told him you know everything is experience that he had but that was not enough to change the life of Jacob you know that was not enough to change the life of Jacob Jacob I've heard about faith Jacob ever heard about God Jacob have heard about you know what God has done Jack I've heard about how God brought down you know his father from his land by Jacob needed to have his own experience that one day when they we asked him Jacob what do you think that that is real to you Jacob what makes you saying that God is real what makes you saying that you've met God what makes you saying that you've been changed you know Jacob needed to have something to show people as a token that from that time from that day that my life has been changed and here we see that Jacob try to imitate his brother he took the court of this record of his brother tried to fake it so but it did not work out that jacob arrived at a point where the angel now came in and you know it gave his name who his name was Jacob and he gave you know it's all the angel water but you know everything about him and he was changed and then and then we see that you know after the blessings of Jacob you know nothing changed you know he went and he went a trouble after troubles but after God after chick I met the angel that's where that's where you know things were changed and we see two dead people where I referred and I've heard this story of a man I think you all know him who was a message believer who wasn't a message before because of his posture you know his posture did something that was wrong and the man had to live the message you know I was thinking about Dinah I said something that you know I thought about something I said that you know if you look at the beginning that man did not have a personal relationship with God because if somebody is in relationship with God if somebody really made God personally no matter what can come to him no matter what can come to him you know it will not move because is you know is hope isn't God it's not in something he's not in somebody oil it's not in something else but when we lean on somebody instead of leaning on God when we watch somebody instead of watching God you know that's what happened you know we see in the Bible there was a prophet who was watching after a king you know he was watching after I think I forgot his name by he was watching after a king but one day that that King did something that was wrong that King you know was punished by God that troubled the life of the Prophet you know that trouble the left of the Prophet why because he had all this hope on somebody else you know it was comfort and you know by seeing other people living you know it was about till the day that himself met God he understood that this is not about somebody else it's about God and me this is about you know it's a it's a business between God and I you know I don't care no matter how many people will leave the message I don't care no matter how people will forsake this but if I met this and if I know that this message is the truth you know I don't care if I you know we sing the same we sing this song that I will follow Jesus if everybody don't want to go with me but if it's myself following Jesus I would go I will not turn my you know this is this surance happens when we have at what we have a personal experience with God this assurance happened you know when you know God personally want you to know that you know no matter what I do God will never fail me because I know where I was I know where I've been I know who I was and I know now how I am so now it's not effects of imitating anymore now it's a fact of living what is inside of you the prophecies that the prophecies that I want to read the prophets he said that well you say that do you believe that you can drink no I never said that look a grant of we can only produce wheat it can't produce cocklebur there is no desire in it there is no life in it to produce cockle burrs with and if we are in cross Jesus he jumped in and he said again in paragraph 63 don't be deceived you had better you'd better search this close now see if you keep on saying I don't condemn me to do this and I don't condemn me to do that things of the world of you know he's talking about things of the world I'm going to hurt you just a little bit put the father's back the other way but it's this one sure evidence you have never been to Christ you've never been born again you know you know when you say that you know I don't I don't condemn me gossiping I don't condemn me lying I don't condemn me you know wearing makeup I don't condemn me you know doing this I don't condemn me doing you know all those wrong things I don't condemn myself you know father listening to this music I don't condemn myself doing this and that the Prophet is basically saying that you know you have never been born again or you have never had the experience with God and there's another quote that the Prophet says that if there's a question in your mind about something that you want to do there's a question or you questioning yourself about something he said that you better not do it I want to read the prophecies that now but if there's a question men come say that do you think is wrong it's wrong to smoke what are you asking about for it it's a question in your mind leave it alone for anything you don't do by faith is sin that's right got to beat by faith so how can you smoke and have faith see it's right in your in your own conscience shows you that you're wrong so if it's uncertain you better leave it alone cuz that might be the one thing that keeps you out of the kingdom of God you know that might that might be the one thing that might keep you out of the kingdom of God that thing that you question yourself you know it happens up you know we--you many happens that sometimes you want to do something but you know you have questions about that you is this right or is this you know according to the word or is this you know God's program or is this this or you know this am i right doing this the Prophet is basically saying that you know when you have those questions when you have those kind of doubts inside of you you better leave that thing alone because you have to do everything by faith faith doesn't have any questions faith doesn't have you know doubts faith is something that when you say that you go and you for it but if there's something you know in your mind asking you know you asking yourself that if this music right or you know is this a closed right or you know is makeup right or is you know wearing this right or if doing this right the Prophet said that if it was right you couldn't ask yourself questions but if you ask yourself questions meaning that there's something with it you know but you better live because that thing that you're asking yourself questions can it can be the only thing that can keep you out of the kingdom of God and I know the desire of everybody here is not to be kept out of the kingdom of God it's to go you know with God you know and we see that you know you know but Habakkuk going back to the experience we see that the experience is something that was it's good you know having experience with God is good but we have not only to stop there but we have now to have no idea our life being changed because we see the Esther when she was asked her and all her friends for going to the before going to the King everybody was saying that you know I would meet the King and I'll be the one who will be chosen will be chosen and and I'll be that the Queen but we see that all those concubines when they went to meet the king you know they did not talk about concubine Styles they talk about men and wife you know about their future but after that you know after that after being with the King they laughs not was once worth changed you know they were not chosen you know it's the same thing you know you might have experiences you know with God you might have experienced no you know I felt one day I was praying and I felt that way wind coming and touch me or I felt somebody touched my hand or I saw an angel or you know I prayed for somebody and you see it and I prayed this and I prayed this you know those are the women's can also tell you that they've been with the Kings you know what they spend the night with the King they talk with the King you know they did the King told them you know why what kind of wives oh you know he wants you know you can have all those kind of experience but that really thing is that after that experience where is your life now after that experience you know where are you now from what you from where you was before after that experience where are you now the Prophet said that you know you might have an experience with God and today you feel that you feel with the Holy Spirit and you say that I won't do this and I won't do that but after one day or two days or after a month or three months you find yourself doing the same thing that you say that you want to say that you have to question yourself you have to question your experience with God you know because we see that in this time that we have too many imitators then - then they then people who I feel really filled with the Holy Spirit you know we see that in this time that in this label alive for journey that we live in that we see that people stop by imitating they only stop that this cause it's a journey you know I give my own experience that myself I was an imitator before but it was a journey that I had to step out of it you know I had to step up you know to live that level of imitating what the word was saying to me to live that level of imitating what other was doing do you know to go into a personal relationship with God to go into you know a one-on-one you know talk with God to go on into a one-on-one you know relationship with God I tell you my my own experience then you know I I was born in the message you know as most of us are you know and then mama you know I went to a message high school you know and then up there you know I saw people you know first before getting to that school I saw how those people those other students you know the head they were quoting the Prophet they were quoting the Bible and I found myself I didn't know anybody first in my head I never you know probably I never you know read the message before and when I found those people and I admired them and I wanted to be like them but when I got into the school I understood that something was different that they were only quoting by the lines most of them their life were not reflecting what they were doing and and then and I'm you know I went and I looked my I had friends that were filled with the Holy Spirit then I started not to make myself a picture of how a person filled with the Holy Spirit needs to be you know but I give you an example that back and you know when we're in the school you know what they were doing that you know that we're not talking to girls you know it was a sin you know talking to them you know you have to be sweet when you talk to somebody you have to be serious you have to do this you have to be that you have to do this and I pictured myself that this is how a holy spirit filled man needs to be and I tried not to imitate you know to copy that certain life without how they were living why to to fit myself you know in the picture but that did not help me you know I always had something inside of me that was lacking I always had something inside of me that was missing by the day I found Christ you know I understood that you know it's not about how my life is or it's not about you know how all holy I look you know to people it's not about how serious I look to people it's not about how you know I don't smile all I don't do this I don't do that but it's all about you know God being inside of him because one thing is that the Holy Spirit is the teacher when the Holy Spirit comes in you you don't need somebody else you know you don't need somebody to tell you that this is wrong or this is true you know sometimes we do need that but most of the time the Holy Spirit inside of you you know we tell you as brother Brooks always says that there is no such things like God forgive my mind my own unseen he said that if the Holy Spirit is inside of you everything wrong that you do that you do the Holy Spirit will tell you that this is wrong that you need to repent you know the Holy Spirit will tell you because the Prophet the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is a teacher is a comforter it would teach us in all truth you know it will show us the way you know sometimes you feel weak and sometimes you do something that you never thought about that day this was wrong or you never read about that in the Bible or you never heard about the Prophet talking about this is wrong but after doing it you feel there's something wrong inside of you or that this little small voice is telling you that brother what you did is wrong that you need to go repent you know that's the Spirit of God that's the Holy Spirit inside of you and most of the time what we do what we do is like we try to shut down voice off we try to shut that voice or we don't want to hear about it you know we - our pride and we think that we all right and we try to you know to shut that voice but that's the worst thing that we can do you know is to try to shut that little voice that is telling us every time that you know what you do is right oh is wrong you know we always have to hear or to listen cuz the holy spirit of prophecy that is shy you know after doing this it'll come and what point that you will never hear about him again you know you will never hear about the small voice again you know and then at that time you are in a dangerous place you know you really need to repent and you really need to have that thing back in you you know you know the Prophet says that the church doesn't need a smartest man or the smartest guy in the world to run it but it needs the baptism of the Holy Spirit the Prophet says that now the church doesn't need a group of intellectuals the church needs a birth the church needs to be born again if the Holy Spirit is going to lead the church then the Holy Spirit will lead the church not according to some ritual but according to the Bible so this is the rules he laid down in the beginning the church needs to miss the baptism the church doesn't need a polishing up that doesn't need a polishing up a better school or in the pulpit a better trans man a better dress congregation it needs a new and new hearts is what the church needs it needs the Holy Spirit it needs you know in this the great unction that changes men and women's life how God promised now he will take the old stony heart it would take the old stony hard out and put a new heart in you then when this happens I'll change he has been made you know a change has been made you know God promised first and where we read that he would take the stony heart out of you and it will give you the heart of flesh you know that way I remember months ago what we said about this about how the Bible says that God would never put a new oil into the oil bottle you know he has first to change the bottle you know why because the batter the old bottle cannot contain the new oil he cannot contain the stimulation the stimulations now that comes with the new oil that's why we see that in Ezekiel where we read verse 26 the Bible says that a new heart also will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and now we take away the stone the heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of flesh and then I would put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgment and do them we know we see that in verse 26 the Bible is first talking you know the Bible is first saying that God will first take away the you know the heart of the heart in the stony heart of us you know it would take that out and then it will put you know it will put first a new heart and a new spirit now you have to know something that a new heart and a new spirit it's not the Holy Spirit that's not the Holy Spirit because if you understand the verse 27 they said that after putting a new heart and a new spirit within you he will now put my spirit verse 27 said that I would put my spirit within you so I was putting my spirit in the new heart that I give you in a new spirit they profit the way he explains it he said that God takes first you know the heart of layout the heart of you know that are sown your heart out of you and then you put a new heart and then in the middle of the new heart it puts a new spirit and then in the middle of the new spirit it puts the new it puts a spirit which is the Holy Spirit you know that's why that comes together with you know this bible scripture that the Bible says that he will never put a new wine to an old bottle you know God had first to change your heart God has first to change your spirit you first was loving you know doing wrong you you didn't want to go to church or you worried about you know that you were doing this wrong you were doing this wrong but God first before he puts his spirit inside of you he has first to change it he has first to change their hearts he has first to give you the heart of flesh has first to change your spirit yes first to give you a spirit that will make you love him yes for us to give you the spirit that will make you I know love your neighbor now gossip not you know literally they love everybody and then after the spirit is important inside of you he would then put his spirit you know his spirit inside of you that is the Holy Spirit and then and then the Holy Spirit that's the spirit that we got everything and the Prophet compared it to a men's spring can I have the the image please can I have that image replacing the the Prophet compare that spirit a new spirit with the mainspring of the watch you know if you have mechanical watches you know this is how mechanical watches it looks inside you know inside that that's how it looks so the Prophet compared the holy spirit to the mainspring this is the mainspring and if you study the mechanic behind it behind the mechanical watches you will see that the mechanical the mainspring it's what gives power you know it's what gives power to the watch it's what you know makes the watch you know move and makes the watch you know do everything without the mainspring in the watch nothing as we work without the mainspring in a watch you know you will have no time you know that's why you will see that after you know the demand spring gives power to the watch this in our wheels will start moving and you know where it'll move one after one and you see that these wheels are connected and all of them are connected together and this is connected you know that's the symptom with the Holy Spirit when God God will first give you a new heart it will give you you know with a new heart and it gives you in a new spirit and then you will put the mainspring and I believe that in the construction of the watch you know they don't first put the mainspring first this come like this comes last you know that we do this that we put all the wheels that will make sure that all the mechanics we you know works together and then that will put the men's spring inside of the watch so that the mainspring can control everything you know you might have also us as Christian as you know human body you know we also have wheels you know those wheels we have them you know our five senses you know our wheels you know a new heart a new spirit and those wheels needs to be controlled or this those wheels needs to be powered by the Holy Spirit you know the Holy Spirit inside of you in the middle of your new year of your new spirit will make that these wheels give the good hour and give the good minutes you know will make that these wheels you know that's good it will make that these wheels you know it's good it will make you the Holy Spirit inside of you will make you acts good will make you love your brother you know will make you you know you know sing for God will make you come to church you know will make you read your Bible will make you pray we make you have a good Spirit will give you strength we give you victory you know to overcome the devil that the men spring inside of you the Holy Spirit inside of you will change your life completely and it become a new person you know you will first you know you first was an imitator you first were an imitator you first were in the situation or in a step or in a journey that you stopped by imitating people but inside of you you still have you know this inside of you that you know I'm not truly born again yet you know I'm not yet where I want to be you know I still have the desire of me I see have this bad desire of me inside of him but once the mainspring is put inside of you I'm sorry when once the Holy Spirit is put inside of you the Holy Spirit not will take control of everything the Holy Spirit now which I control you know of all the you know of the move of your heart and all the other move you know of me know of your body the Prophet says that on the day of Pentecost there was 120 new skins lay on the floor now you find out that the old skin was cut was cast outside but when God came from the heavens and filled these new skins they got new life and began to bounce all over the floor even bounce out of door out the door and through the windows into the streets new skins with new bottles new wine oh holy Oh Holy Ghost wine poured out full of life just stretching and giving oh brother John I don't care what denomination you belong to I love you anyhow there you are I don't care where you want as 2 and s 3 and S 5 nice we are brothers that's the new skin whether we us Assemblies Church of God Foursquare whatever we are the new skin stretch plumb out and take everything and take and taking every brother there is a every brother there's around but the old by the old one won't do that that's right I want I mean in one dude they won't do it somehow it's just one doing it Sarge and said and it will burst you know that's what the Holy Spirit does that's why the new one does you know the new ones take away everything take away all our differences you know you see that you know in the message that you see that these people from this church doesn't fellowship with the other brother from that church you see that these people from this church you know because they don't believe the same thing or because they don't have the same you know roots that don't fellowship with the others you see the message because this belief in this and the other way one don't believe in this you know we give ourselves you know the authority to say that these people would go to hell or you know they don't have the truth or you know bury or they're not chosen by God or you know whatever whatever else we can say the Prophet now here is saying that if you have this true one inside of you if you have the Holy Spirit inside of you it says that I don't care about you by your denomination I don't care about what you believe in this I don't care either you want is to nest three days five days I don't care whether you believe in the second coming or not I don't care what you do this or not you know you still my friend you still my brother you know the Holy Spirit will take away our differences and we will only see one thing cross inside of you man and the new spirit and the new heart is the Holy Spirit that will make it that will make you stop doing wrong the Prophet says that yet you get a new spirit you quit drinking you quit your drinking you get a new spirit your quit lying you get a new spirit you can do most anything with the spirit but that isn't what God's talking about what God is talking about a new spirit he said I'll give you now watch I give you a new heart and a new spirit why he'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him why you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you did have before you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate with the next man on the next corner you couldn't associate with these Christians y-you have had an awful spirit so he has to give you a new spirit I give you a new heart and a new spirit now watch and I will put my spirit in you there's the did there's the difference I would put my spirit in you now hear the Prophet is expanding or saying what we said earlier that a new spirit I would give to you he said that before you had a bad spirit that spirit didn't I even want you to fellowship with the others you know forgot to put his spirit inside of you had for us to change that bad spirit that you have you know to give you first a new spirit that will make you love Christ and a new spirit that will make you quit drinking a new spirit that will make you quit lying a new spirit what would that would make you quit lasting a new spirit that would make you quit you know uh singing wordless song and new spirit that will make a quick swearing the new spirit that will make you quit all the bad things and then how will put my spirit now here's the thing that we don't have to stop by only receiving a new spirit we don't only have to stop by receiving a new heart and a new spirit you know we have to go beyond that but most of the time what we do that you know we stop by only receiving a new spirit you know you see a brother you know after a change has been made in the scar you know it doesn't smoke anymore it doesn't lie anymore it doesn't do it this anymore it doesn't do that anymore you know he consent himself you know with what he has you know instead of going in the step where God will not have to put the spirit inside of you you know you only stop you know with the new spirit that you have you only stop with the everything the Prophet said that that is right by the Bible did not step there with the Bible but did not stop there the Bible went on saying that I would put my spirit inside of you you know that spirit that mainspring that will make you now do right that would make you now you know stop imitating that will make everything or any actions that will you would do original coming out of you you know coming from you know the Spirit of God the Prophet asked these questions he says that why is there so many Christians find it so hard to live a Christian life he asked that question what is it hard you know when when you read the when you listen to this sermon you see that the Prophet is asking that why today you see that somebody said that he had an experience with God and tomorrow you see him failing what there's so many ups and downs in our Christian lives why there's so you know many things going wrong in our Christian lives you know why is it so hard you know to find you know a white walk why why is it why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live a Christian life you know the answer is that because they never get to a point of living the stage of imitating to a personal life with God you know the answer is that they never met God personally you know they only start by imitating cuz that's the thing is that when you imitate you know one day you would you will find yourself you you know one day what is inside of you will reveal itself I give an example you know I had a friend at work you know he was she was cursing and you know she was saying those bad words she knows that I'm a Christian and she didn't want to do it she didn't want to say those words before me you know in front of it she didn't want to say this cuz she knows that I don't like it I'm a Christian and she tried to act as if that she doesn't say it but when something is inside of you and that old serpent is not dead yet you know one day you will reveal what you are you know it happened to something all of a sudden happen and she did not control herself and she said it you know that made me just say that you were not a Christian life is not a life that you will try to satisfy somebody a Christian life is not a life that you were trying to satisfy you know a pastor a Christian life is not a life that you were trying to satisfy your parents a Christian life is not alive that you were trying to satisfy your wife or your husband a Christian life is a life that eats between you and God you know something as first to be changed inside of you you know no matter how good you may act an outside no matter how good you may you know showed out do you know sure the people how are you good you know as long as there's something inside of you that is not dead yet one day that thing will come out one day you will reveal your true personality you know one day you will reveal who you truly are you know that's that's the same thing you know because if we understand that in this message we have too many Pharisees you know Pharisees if you read the Bible and you study about the Pharisees the Prophet calls them the actors people who were acting at the outside they were acting as if they were Christian but in the inside you know they were not following the words you know you see people who knows the message who knows the Bible who knows everything who knows all the commandments but inside of them you know they don't even follow they don't even obey what they say you know you see people can you know what the Prophet who can quote the Bible can call the speaker in Scripture but after going out you see the same man living about life you see the same man you know threatened you know women's you see if the same man doing you know things that is wrong you know why because he never been changed or he never been born again he's trying to act you know you see that we read Matthew I think chapter 16 verse 6 the Bible says Matthew 16 verse 6 this is Jesus talking it says that then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees be aware of this leaven you know the leaven if we we go and we studied 11 in the Bible we see that 11 is something that is unpure that's why when at the exodus of the children of Israel when they wanted to come out you know when the angel when the Death Angel was going to pass God told them make sure to not have the leaven you know in your house you know it you know the bread without leaven and then after them after that I told them that you will do seven days without having leaven inside of you and eleven is something that not pure is something that is seen you know consider as seen and Jesus is now talking now telling us to be aware to be to be aware of this leaven of those things that is not pure other words in other words that something that is not sincere that's what it's called leaven and we see that if you want to read you see that you will find it in Matthew 23 verse 25 to 28 you'll find in a Luke chapter chapter 12 verse 1 you'll finally look 16 14 to 15 you find any mark 38 and 40 what Jesus is telling us to be aware of the Sadducees and then the Sadducees today nowadays is compared to those Christians who are externalism you know they like to are to show people that there are Christian so they you know in the outside you know they they're Christian but in the inside there are now Christians you know when they are amongst Christians they behave like Christians when they are amongst Christian they talk like Christian when they are quiet among Christian they walk like Christian when they are among like Christian they sing like Christian when they are among Christian they watch you know Christian things but when they are you know among the among those people you know they do what they do you know what other people say in other words to say that you know there are hypocrites you know those people who never been to Christ who never been to Calvary you know that's the same thing that you've seen in I think in Revelation chapter 3 you see that in Revelation Bible the Bible is talking about loud this year saying that God will vomit hey you know God would take it out you know God because it's not cold is not it's not warm and that spirit of their you know that verse of the Edition it's not just somebody or John thinking about the strata verse but it was a real a reality you know if you read the Bible or if you read the story of Lao Edition you said you see that there was in the old time you know there were some sickness that was healed you know by taking hot water or quarter or I'm sorry you see that the the the the reef cuz laude Australia is a river you see that our dish was the combination of two rivers the river that was in North I believe was called and the one that was in South was hot and when those rivers were coming together the place that those rivers were crossing you know that was making that was where our dish it was that was where you know it was not hot it was not cold it was warm and then you see that people where it were water Bible says that people you know that you you think that you you reach you think that you dis you that you see that people Martian were not coming allow initiative to sell their stuff to sell their goods you know that's why the Bible say this and then when the Bible says that you know I will vomit you or I would take you out of me you see that when people were sick or they wanted to take out why they've eaten you know that they were drinking of this water because the warm water actually makes you wanna you know take out everything that you yet that you ain't you know that we're drinking out of the loud dishes water and then that will help them you know you know take out everything that I wanted to take out you know that's the state you know that's the kind of state that you know that Jesus or God doesn't like then and then and that's the same thing with the Pharisees you know they do that you and I act out good they're trying to you know if they in church you see them this sweet they come you know you know they do things according to the Bible but once they're out they changed the change they've they now be you know different people may be prophets is that the same thing he did when he come on earth he found the people and the Pharisees and so forth after the law what was their doing just not sincerity in it at all just go ahead and slap and slap you through any SAP slap you through any other way just as long as they they joined the church that's all they needed and that's what they want that that's what he found and that's why he's founding he's founding again he's finding again he finds the same thing people doesn't change so if he sent his program and the people disbelieved it it is believed that there and they perished they believed it they believed it and leaved now on those two it's got to be the same on this time it's got to be the same you know if God sent His Word back there when Jesus was on earth you know people who believed that lived and people who disbelieve they perished he has to be the same thing again the Prophet says that when Jesus is coming again buck now you know is finding the same kind of people the same kind of Christians you know cause the Spirit doesn't die you know he is finding the same kind of Christians you know you might feel yourself in this room that you know that you are one of them you might feel yourself in this room that you are one of them that you changed colors or you change forms you know you adapt you of yourselves you know you know you you adapt yourselves you know in situations or you adapt yourself in different atmosphere you know if you are with worldly friends you know you adapt you become worldly if you are you know with sense you become sense and you adapt yourself and if you feel yourself that you are among them or you are one of them God is always God wants to change you God never called us you know to to become adapters or you know to become imitators or to become adaptator you know what I don't know if that words exist or not you know they just came out of my mind you know God doesn't call us to be those kind of man God doesn't want to call it God calls us to show one color and the only color that we needs to show is Christ God calls us to show Christ to live like God to live like him to live that Christ that's why he sent the Holy Spirit you know if you feel yourself that you are one of them that you don't have you know you don't have positions you know you know you everywhere if this says this you go with if that says you go with it you know you don't you don't have this certain certainty you know inside of you that God really changed your life you know why don't you come across now you know we see that all those sicknesses that is coming all those virus and we see people you know trying to protect themselves we see people trying you know created the vaccine and all the self and we see also we see also people are message delivery now they're trying to wake up you see that and now on every almost every post on what's up you see bible scriptures talking about you know diseases you see the court of the prophet talking about this is you know don't wait until something like this wakes you up you know don't wait until something comes and we will wake you up that you will tell you now to go read your Bible will tell you now to bring all the message or the bible scripture that you're had you know bring it back to your mind you know don't wait until at that time you know as long as there's still time you know for you to be safe you know you better run to you better run into it don't wait until you know you'll see that one of your family members you know well we wish it will not be the case or being with coronavirus or being with other kind of viruses now you will now come to the altar you know don't wait until something will push you to pray don't wait until something we push you to read the Bible why don't we don't wait until something will wake you up to check your relationship with God now it's check up times now is check up time it's the time that you really need to check where the do I am I saved or not do I have the Holy Spirit or not you know you might try to fake it you might try to live right you might try to do everything that you can but one day you know that the Holy Spirit is like a token you know the Prophet given give an example of a magnet he says that I did the day of rapture it'll be a magnet and a you know on the top you know he's trying to come is will come and it will pass you know the entire earth and only those people who will have the same chemical you know better the same that you know the same body then that big magnet those are the ones that will be caught up you know if you don't have the think inside of you you know no matter everything that you can do you know that thing will never you will never be caught up you'll be screwed down you know you need first to have something inside of you that is the life of Christ you need first to have you know that that thing that you know one plus one equals one you know but God's life plus my life equals one it's not two different lives you know it's the same life you know if somebody sees you you know it's his Christ if somebody sees you you know it can tell that you know he's Christ I remember one day I went to the store you know I I believe it was I went to buy this shirt you know I was I went in the store and I was there buying this shirt and then it happened the lady that was you know be selling me the shirt I didn't talk to him or I didn't say a word to him you know I was just answering all the questions I did you know he was asking me about you know my credit cards about money about stuff and then she looked at me and then he she asked me a question she said are you a Christian I said yes I am I asked her why I said yes I can tell cause your spirit is different you know that's the Holy Spirit you know when the Holy Spirit inside of you you don't need to hide it you know everywhere you will go you know people will notice that there's something the Prophet says that the Holy Spirit inside of you will create atmosphere you know will create a certain you know a sweet atmosphere that will bring the presence of angels you know I've had that experience many times you know at work I was talking to somebody and he looked at me and asked me are you a Christian I said yes I said I asked him why and they say you know you can feel it you know many times you know why because that spirit it's not me forcing it or it's not me you know trying to talk like a Christian it's not me trying to live like a Christian or try not behave like a Christian you know I am me you know I'm free I do everything I do but there's something inside of me that is reflecting God's life inside and that's the thing that we are needs to look for that's the thing that we're all needs to have you know to have that certainty inside of us that if the rapture happens now I'm not staying I'm going because you know what happened to you you know you know where you are you know how you know the relationship that you have with God and if you have that certainty inside of you nothing else in this world will stop you in closing I want to read the prophet the prophecies for though I speak with tongues as men and angels do I have gifts till I can't move mountains don't understand all the words do I have all knowledge I am nothing o simply feel like if I could only had the knowledge or the something to express to you my people all the people are the prophecy that if I could have the knowledge or something to expect you to express to you my people or the people of God don't live off the mainspring no matter how pretty it looks how much of a watch it looks it looks like if that mainspring isn't there it will never keep time we can call ourselves Foursquare Assembly Presbyterian Baptist we can call ourselves Pentecostal whatever we want to we can call ourselves run and hide or be you know message believer whatever we want to call ourselves but as long as that mainspring the Holy Ghost isn't there ticking of love joy peace goodness long-suffering we're just putting a show you know the Prophet says that you know we can call ourselves I don't care what kind of name you want to call yourself message believer Pentecostal whatever Brown tonight whatever you want to call yourself but if the mainspring is not inside you know you you have mechanical watches you know you can call it any kind of bridge you were any kind of branch you want you know Gucci whatever whatever you want to call it but if it's a mechanical what I don't know how you know those Smart Watch works but if it's a mechanical watches mechanical watch you know it doesn't the mainspring you know whatever whatever the cost of the watch can be or whatever how pretty the the watch look look in the outside if it doesn't have that mainspring you will be you were you know it'll be hard to tell the time you will never tell the time you know that's the same thing we can call ourselves whatever we want we can call ourselves Christian we can call self God's follow where we can call ourselves you know any kind of name that you can check out of the dictionary but as long as you don't have something or the Holy Spirit the mainspring inside of you the Prophet is very clear you're just putting a show you're just imitating you know you're just impersonating you know you you just manufacturing you know the Holy Spirit but it's not really the Holy Spirit you know that's why we're we can stand and then the musician can come you know if you feel like you know God has talked to you when you don't have it you know it's okay you know if you don't have it you know just pray okay God you know have this desire you know God what God will help you God will give it to you you know God is the only one who can feel you can it can give it to us you know we don't have to go and try to fake it or try to force ourselves you know to finally give us a song please and trying to force ourselves you know to do it but God is the only one who can do it and the only time that God can do it's when you surrender everything the only time that God can do it when you have no will inside of you you know that can do it you know you say Lord I want to forsake myself Lord you know that I've tried so many times to live a Christian life don't you know that I've tried so many times to be obedient at home no you know that I've tried so many times to you know to to follow you Lord you know that I've tried so many times I read my Bible and I do this but still there's nothing inside of me that is making this natural you know I'm forcing myself I'm doing too much work you know in doing this my lord - now now is the day enough is enough you know I wanna have this dispenser personal experience though now today - now I want to know you personally I want to get out of this room being changed I want to get out of this room having a new experience or a new you know experience when people will look at me and we said that you know I said what happened to you you know there's something that changed inside of you yesterday I was with you you weren't like this you know you can go back and tell them you know what I met with God and I was changed jack about the men with the angel he had something to show with people you know to show the people his walk first changed you know he went there a prideful man walking as normal but when he way now you know it wasn't walking as he came in you know his name was changed he had now a new name the name was changed to Israel so you need something that needs to show people that I've been changed with it you know and the only thing that needs to show is not that how many shouts that you have shouts or it's now how many song that you can sing it's not how emotional not that you are the only thing that you need to show that I've been changed is your life you know I don't care or you know how emotions or how many tears that you can cry or how many scripture that you can
