[6:52] grace
[6:55] representatives amen and then god died
[6:57] on calvary he divided himself
[7:02] he took the body and then he gave us the
[7:04] spirit
[7:06] amen these types were representing jesus
[7:08] christ himself tipped any more
[7:10] representation
[7:11] amen that was introducing a covenant of
[7:14] grace
[7:22] [Music]
[7:46] but he know but he knows his way back
[7:48] you know his way back home
[7:52] so from calvary's cross
[7:56] where the bruised him
[8:06] he made his flight from calvary and he
[8:08] landed in heaven's door he allowed
[8:10] foreign
[8:37] [Music]
[9:21] upon him

[9:31] whatever you're going through
[9:33] whatever you whatever it is is battling
[9:35] you foreign you can go to him like

[9:44] open up that really that that prayer
[9:47] meant for you to go
[9:50] amen abraham hate that revelation
[9:53] he could go to god
[9:55] amen and we see that he played his case
[9:57] before god
[9:58] and jesus gave him a son
[10:01] and even though people could have mocked
[10:03] their life
[10:05] and even though people thought that
[10:06] abraham was foolish members of relation
[10:08] abraham knew that god i was believing
[10:12] abraham knew the god that he was serving
[10:14] so when he was going to able to god
[10:44] amen to offer sacrifice for free
[10:46] amen if someone had to be do you have a
[10:48] revelation
[10:50] about was revealed the word of god was
[10:52] referred to abraham
[10:55] that god was requiring the blood okay
[10:58] amen
[11:32] [Music]
[12:08] amen but you'll see that the people who
[12:10] gets healed
[12:12] it's those people that faith is revealed
[12:15] whatever the faithful that has answers
[12:18] from god
[12:20] it's those type of people that faith is
[12:22] a revelation
[12:35] from point a to point b
[12:51] in christ
[12:52] amen amen the bible says in romans
[12:54] chapter 5 verse 1 to 5.
[12:58] therefore being justified by faith
[13:01] we have peace with god through our lord
[13:03] jesus
[13:06] also we have access by faith into the
[13:09] grace into this grace wherein we stand
[13:11] back
[13:14] and rejoice in hope for the glory of god
[13:33] and patience experience
[13:36] experience
[13:37] and experience hope
[13:40] and experience work with hope the
[13:43] patients
[13:44] and hope mick is not ashamed
[13:50] because the love of god is shared abroad
[13:52] in our hearts by the holy ghost which is
[13:54] given unto us
[13:59] when we were yet when
[14:14] for erectus
[14:19] foreign for a good man same would even
[14:22] dare to die
[14:27] but god commendeth his love toward us
[14:31] in that in that while we were yet
[14:34] sinners
[14:36] cross died for us please
[14:38] man i love verse six someone read it
[14:39] again
[14:41] the bible said that for when we were yet
[14:42] seniors but when we were yet without
[14:45] strength
[14:47] in due time
[14:49] christ died for us
[14:52] yet where we were where you were yet
[14:54] without strength counsel
[15:31] amen so therefore i can just go to him
[15:34] and he should pick he should pick a
[15:35] level having the faith that he already
[15:37] forgiven
[16:16] the bible clearly say that the angel
[16:18] told daniel before you even open your
[16:20] mouth
[16:48] yes
[16:53] [Music]
[17:30] that's what he died for him
[17:32] and that's why he shared his god
[17:35] so that we can guard him who can you
[17:37] push all over and bring all our needs to
[17:38] him
[17:39] and he will give us so that our joy be
[17:41] perfect
[17:43] amen because he said that you asked not
[17:45] because you don't want to take care of
[17:46] them
[17:48] amen
[17:53] he's the one who spoke the word
[17:56] none of us asked god to speak
[18:12] this
[18:25] god will give it to you yeah
[18:54] it's nothing you did yeah
[18:56] you didn't work yourself into faith
[19:00] you ever have faith if you ever have
[19:02] faith
[19:04] it's given to you by grace of god
[19:07] amen and god reveals it to you
[19:10] therefore faith is a revelation
[19:13] and the whole church of god is built
[19:15] upon the river
[19:18] the whole church of god is built upon
[19:20] the revelation
[19:21] of the jews the revolution that was
[20:03] you have to be a part of it
[20:28] a man has a soul
[20:30] but a man has a soul
[20:33] amen amen has a soul
[20:39] and therefore thus so he's a part of god
[20:43] and even it's and even in his fallen
[20:45] race in a foreign state
[20:49] amen yet it's the most greatest species
[20:54] of all species of the earth
[20:58] especially the species exists like there
[21:00] is
[21:10] amen and then get him in connection with
[21:13] his maker a menace
[21:17] [Music]
[21:22] amen because he is the son of god
[21:25] amen he becomes acquaintance
[21:27] with his maker
[21:39] acquainted with his maker
[21:42] becomes
[22:00] no wonder people can't believe divine
[22:03] healing today
[22:05] quite like like arizona because they
[22:07] haven't got nothing to believe
[22:12] [Music]
[22:25] there the pancake how can this be even
[22:28] commercial and explain it all the way
[22:30] hey you value explicit amen but when god
[22:34] ever takes his position into a human
[22:36] heart
[22:49] [Music]
[23:45] you have all the attributes
[24:03] repetitious attention amen and the son
[24:05] of god is god
[24:08] and he has the ability to speak the word
[24:12] he has the ability to bring things into
[24:14] existence
[24:16] he has given
[24:30] amen
[24:58] to vindicate the presence of the lord
[25:00] jesus christ
[25:08] he has risen from the dead
[25:11] he lives among us
[26:08] i want you to
[26:50] uh
[27:46] before those philistines
[27:49] and it reinforced the law of god did i
[27:51] impose it
[27:52] that everything that they have given to
[27:54] you belongs to you
[28:00] and they claim
[29:10] you have
[29:34] the woman who was losing blood
[30:48] broke
[31:31] this unfortunately at that point because
[31:33] a woman had faith
[31:34] in the family and took the strength that
[31:36] was in jesus name
[31:39] and gave her the healing
[31:41] even this morning
[31:44] you can have
[32:08] [Music]
[32:25] [Music]
[32:39] [Music]

[33:21] uh uh
[33:36] gave that prophecy the country has done
[33:38] he said prophecy that the virgin shall
[33:40] conceive
[33:42] but certainly people
[33:43] found him as foolish
[33:46] how can a virgin conceive come on if you
[33:48] have special say amen people didn't
[33:50] understand the company isaiah himself
[33:52] didn't understand what it is
[33:55] but he just had a revelation
[33:59] but years after me
[34:01] amen their faith was revealed to that
[34:03] woman
[34:16] now listen mary only asks one question
[34:18] to the angel marina
[34:21] how is this going to happen
[34:24] amen the angel told him that you will be
[34:26] covered by the holy spirit
[34:29] after that mary didn't ask how the holy
[34:32] spirit will recover
