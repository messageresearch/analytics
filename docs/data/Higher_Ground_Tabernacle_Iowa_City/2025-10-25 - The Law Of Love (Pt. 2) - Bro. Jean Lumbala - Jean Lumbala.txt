TRANSCRIPT
========================================
A gone be a forever. [Music] Oh sh [Music] [Music] [Music] may on Our ma [Music] what they say Savior. Oh, come v. [Music] Oh. [Music] Oh. You have Oh, she my [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Amen. Father John, we greeting you in the name of the Lord Jesus. May the Lord bless all of us tonight. We are so grateful to the Lord who kept us alive till today. Matthew 22 36- 40 because we're going to continue with the last subject we had the law of which is the great commandment of the law. Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." The love of God is the first commandment. And the Lord is giving her the second commandment. &gt;&gt; The second is like unto he unto it. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. &gt;&gt; Now listen. Verse 40. On these two, we so grateful unto you for this wonderful moment you gave us in your house. We came in this place. We know that you are the great dynamic, the great dynamic, the great power station. [Music] May you accept for us to be connected to you so that we may have fire from you. Divine fire that destroy all sins and darkness. May you be with us Lord. Why we talking about love in this place may not go back as in your word nobody can come in. go back the same way you came because you believe in the cross there's a transforming power in the cross there's everything that we need all kind of blessing you say without you we can't do anything we want to do everything with you Lord we want to love you like your children we want to save you the Lord Jesus on our way back home we We may say that God has changed us. We may we may say like those who were on the road of Moses that our heart were burning while he was talking to us. You never change. You're still the same. You were on the way. You can still be with us in this. It's possible. Two or three are my Amen. May the Lord bless us once more &gt;&gt; and we greeting you in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't see brother Stefan. &gt;&gt; But you know a a subject like love We can't close it. We can't finish it because love is God himself. We can't talk about God and finish wrote about love and I believe we singing that in the in the in the song that love is so great and there's no way you can go around it. Love is so high. So if everybody was a writer and would like to write about love, oceans going to run dry. So there's no way we can explain about love. So we will just say something each one of us and we trust the Lord &gt;&gt; because it's the Lord who's going to make us. &gt;&gt; He knows how to teach each one of us. That's how I believe it &gt;&gt; and I also believe that's the way you you taking it. So we to and he said everything that prophet have said everything that you believe everything that Moses Jeremiah and all these prophets up to John the Baptist everything that they've done the Lord has put them together compacted them together he has put them together and said &gt;&gt; what came out of them is love. That's why we coming to church. We coming to church to seek for love and prophecies will cease. There'll be one day that the prophecies will cease to be where they speaking in tongues. One day those speaking in tongues will close be done. One day, [Music] one day &gt;&gt; marriage, there won't be marriage anymore. &gt;&gt; The love of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Only the love of God is eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Christians, that's why sons of God, you as a son, you should be love. You should have that that love. &gt;&gt; You are a man because you are the son of a man. Animal. &gt;&gt; It's a little one of another animal. So if you are the son of God and your father is less than God, hatred has been found in a in a heart of God and the revelation today about that telling us that is not from God because in Adam there wasn't hatred. The entire life of Adam, he was full of hatred. And at the end, we can see what what he have done. It was death. He killed. He was a mror. He killed somebody because he wasn't he wasn't the son of God. So every son of God should have love. So according to what the master said first the love for God a love for your neighbor that's the victory from God. So how are we going to serve God? Servant of God they will serve God by by love. That's the only way we can save God. And God, &gt;&gt; he will accept only the works that you've done by love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you should serve God by love. The love of God first. God first. Last time we read about it somewhere in the message &gt;&gt; where the prophet was saying that God first &gt;&gt; just notice King Solomon. I don't know if I've got a right way to say it. &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's going to be the right word for him. He wasn't intelligent from the start, but he had the grace of God to be in the presence of God face to face as you as well today right where you are. You should believe that you are in the presence of God if you don't believe it. And nobody going to believe on your behalf if you don't believe. You're not going to see the glory of God to see God's glory. You should believe first. What do you mean? You believe in the word of God. And what the word of God where two or three are guided my name, I'll be in their midst. If we are guarded in the name of the Lord Jesus that we should believe that Jesus is right here. We should believe it. We are obligated to believe that to believe that God is now me. So how are you going to believe? There's no way you can believe in God if you don't love God. [Music] So if you love God first then you can believe in him. That's why the Bible says everything that a prophet have done all their preachings in short. It means the love of God then the love for your neighbor. King Solomon found himself in the presence of God. So now listen what God required him now that you are in my presence. What do you want me to do for you? That's a good question. If it was asked from to me, I would say God listen. Give my give me my wife and my children next to me. God give me money, give me purpose. That's what I will ask. I will ask to from God. But Solomon, he knew that he was idiot first. I love this an idiot whose caution that is idiot. He's not idiot cuz he knows that he's lack of something then he can go forward and look for what he's missing. But the dangerous one is the idiot who doesn't know that he's idiot who think is intelligent that one is so int dangerous but an idiot who knows his condition may God bless that son of that's what the king was. So he said He found himself in front of God. Jehovah Jar himself &gt;&gt; who had eternal life, &gt;&gt; who had gold and silver, &gt;&gt; who had everything that he wanted to have and those things were there with him. God could give him everything that he wanted. But now listen what Solomon asked from God. &gt;&gt; Lord, Give me wisdom. Why wisdom? &gt;&gt; So that I can judge your people. So what was his benefit? He didn't ask wisdom for himself, but he asked wisdom, blessings of the people of God. He said if you give me wisdom if you give you give me wisdom I will use the wisdom to the service of people your people. So God found his portion in that in the prayer of Solomon. Amen. Amen. So Solomon want to be a good leader. He wanted to do the right judgment for the people of God. So God found his portion in that. &gt;&gt; That's why God never we we we uh we withhold that for him. He gave unto Solomon what he asked for. He also gave him even what he didn't ask for. fulfill his word. He said, "Seek first the kingdom of God and it its righteousness and the rest. You're not going to look for it." God was going to give it for you. That's what he did. [Music] First ask for the kingdom of God. But the advantage of the benefit of God and or when God have seen his portion in his prayer He found the sincerity in the heart of Solomon. Then he gave Solomon what he asked for, wisdom and intelligence, he also gave him, gold and silver. And the Bible says so since the word is the world, nobody has been blessed like Solomon. But if you read in the prayer, never said God give me money. He never asked for money but he asked for wisdom &gt;&gt; not for himself but he asked the wisdom for the people of God. My beloved one I want to tell you something. So God the creator is more interested to our soul salvations than any other thing. Soul salvation is the first thing that God hold to God want is soul salvation. When we pray, you ask something from God. You should know why you asking that thing from God. Does God have a portion in what you asking or give me a good health? &gt;&gt; Why are you asking that? &gt;&gt; No, I just want to be in good health to go to work. No, that's not asking from God. &gt;&gt; We don't ask God in that way. &gt;&gt; You ask the good help. to serve God. If I'm in good health, Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm going to save you. If you give me good health, see what I'm going to do with her. I'm going to go visit you. I'll go pray for your children. I'm not going to be absent from I'm not be absent from. And I will save you with a good head that you give to me. That's how we pray. And one day there was a a feast, a party. Why was that party? Because a son of a king wanted to get married. So that son came in a city. It was a a land of his father. So they they bring together all the the girls and women around the world. those girls came out because the son of a king wanted to get married. So there were people who were getting those girls ready. So they came so in numbers. So they came up, those who were getting those girls ready. They said, "So today the son of a king is going to get married. So what do you want us to give you? Because maybe it may it may probably it's going to be you if the son of a king take you as a wife. So you the one who's going to be so there's more benefit if the if the king is the priest who's going to be a new king. So if you want something like for your preparation or give me the red stick, give me the short short skirt, give me this and that. So they gave all those things to them. Everything that those girls asked for, they were just useless thing they were asking for. But there was one girl who was different from all others. She was working. They ask her a question. So you as well. You can be a queen. You can be they can you can get married to a son of a king. What do you want for your preparation? Now listen to the answer. She said this. I want the king the son of king himself. If the son of a king is my husband then all the things the rest of the things will be mine. Seek first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness. All other things will be given unto you as a benefit. That's how that's how we've been taught. Ask first the goodness of God. Ask first as for the kingdom of God and its righteousness. Then God will give unto you the rest of the things. So that girl she was working. She never asked anything. She said, "I only want the son of the king himself. because all other things will be given unto me. So when all the girls just passed by and the son of king was discouraged, he said, unfortunately if it's only those ones that are the girls that I have to get married to. So while he was working in the rain, he noticed another girl was working. So those who were in the party inside so they've used they've used the dishes and and cups and stuff and is that girl who was washing them. She was washing those dishes and cups and stuff glasses and she was she was well dressed up. So the the son of the king came up to her. Why didn't go inside together with other girls? I'm not going to be in there. I'm working right now. That's how we have to do things. Keep on working for the Lord in the good time and in the bad time in hard time and just working for the Lord. So she was a real worker that the son of the king was interested not to a lazy one somebody who's just sleeping just a little. You start sleeping only the time of the service. When it's the service time is the time for you to sleep. When you're at home you're not sleeping. You start sleeping only in the church. the same person only when it's the time for the service that the time to sleep but when it's time to sleep home. No bed dreams. So how come that you got bedrooms only the time of the service time to come to church? There's no nightmare. There are even those who are coming to sleep in the church. Regardless of the noise that we make, &gt;&gt; there's no nightmare here. So you got to check those nightmares comes from the enemy. The enemy doesn't want to be concentrated to receive your blessing. You are to fight for your blessings. No one else will fight on your behalf. When we talking about spiritual fight, you think it's a job. It's not a joke. The spiritual fight, spiritual battle exist, it exist. And the first battle of the devil is to bring you far away from the word of God. That's the first fight to bring you to believe that you can sleep when when they preaching. It's brother John. Who's brother John? He doesn't even know how to preach. Who is he? I can I can have a nap while we preaching and you are you are dreaming. How come? May God bless you. So we are to be workers, real workers. So to work is to work hard to endure the pain, &gt;&gt; difficult times, that's working. When it's cold, you still come to church. And the Lord is a just judge. He knows your heart. He knows your motives. He knows your objectives. He knows how to reward you. Whoever will save God should save him by love first. God bless and God gives money to you. But seek first for the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all the rest. You're not going to look for them. It's God who's going to give it to you freely. He's going to give it to you. He doesn't lie. God is going to give it to you freely. When you came in this place, you could be somewhere else. I know because I used to do delivery. I know time is money. Maybe in one hour, two hours I could get some money. Maybe $30, $20. &gt;&gt; But if you say I will stop this and go to church. I have to go save my Lord. And then the heaven sees you. There's an eye observing you somewhere and there's a blessing waiting for you. So God is going to give you those blessings. It's not me who saying. I'm just repeating what God have already said. He said he's going to bless you. And you ought to work by love for the Lord. You ought to work for by love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So once you work by love, there's a reward for you. Everything that we do in this world is the seed. We sowing seed &gt;&gt; one day. It's going to bring up. &gt;&gt; If you sow good seed, &gt;&gt; you will harvest good things and you will harvest them in abundance. Cuz when you throw your bread upon waters, your bread that you throw on the waters will come back to you. By the time the bread come back to you, it will come in numbers bigger. The the bread is observe absorbed waters. Maybe you throw it, maybe you throw a little bread, a a little piece of bread, but when you put more water in it, when it absorbed waters, that bread becomes bigger. You can eat it and get full of it. You can even throw it again on the waters and it will come back to you. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; The word of God is so wonderful. &gt;&gt; We we love our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whoever doesn't have love &gt;&gt; doesn't come from God. &gt;&gt; If you don't have love, which means you don't come from God and everything that comes from God. All those who comes from God have got a sign. &gt;&gt; And the sign for these people &gt;&gt; is love. They don't force themselves to love. &gt;&gt; They automatically love. They love their God and they also love their neighbors to all the questions of the entire universe that you know. God have given the answer and the answer that God have given is love. We are in tr. Why are we in trouble? It's because we don't want to respect the law of God. &gt;&gt; That's why we are in trouble. The murdering that we have, wars that we have, the forces that we have because we've broken the law of God somewhere. Instead of having love for God, instead of having love for your neighbor, we've got hatred for God. Curiously, in our generation there, there's many artherist. In this generation, we have many atheist. There are those who don't believe in God. They've got their philosophy. If God exists, which means man doesn't exist. So, if man exists, which means God doesn't exist. That's being idiot things. &gt;&gt; I'm insuring God exist. Never believe in those earthies. They are descenders from devil. They can only deceive the sons of the devil. &gt;&gt; There were war in heaven. Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Lucifer. He fought against Michael. Michael was the greatest one and strong one. Even though there were so many, Michael cast them down all of them. Even if we are not so many, we are the victorious. Even if we are only two or three people, we are the victorious. &gt;&gt; Victory is now a camp and the Lord is with us and you should believe it in the name of the Lord Jesus. for you to move forward. You should believe that you're not alone and God is with you to believe in that way. You should love God first. Love God first. Once you love God, then you can believe in what he's saying. Otherwise, you know, if you don't love him, you will never believe in him. But us in our meeting, we are the believers. We are believers. We've got love for our God and also love for our neighbors. It's impossible. Will you not love your neighbor? your brother and believe of the same message. The message that you believe, &gt;&gt; the brother and sister who are going to be raptured together, brother and sister who are going to heaven together, just imagine you get there and you don't talk to each other. Is that normal? &gt;&gt; Do you know how we love each other in the family? When you come in the family like I'm not the firstborn of the family. When you come in the world, you just come. You see someone else who's like you. &gt;&gt; He calls Your father, he also call him his father. Where you go sleep, you see him going to sleep in the same place. When your dad make his project, he does it for you and for him on the on his identity. You've got same you've got same then you understand. Oh, so this person is from my family. I don't understand. So my father is his father too. So I'm forced to love that person because that person is like me is almost like me. The blood that flows in me is the same blood in him. So then you understand that this person next to me, we've got the we've got the blood bound, &gt;&gt; but we we've got the same person. &gt;&gt; He calls Braham his prophet. You also call brother Brham your prophet. So if he's not against us, which means he's for us. If he's not against us, which means ours, we should just love him and accept him as he is. Because the brother, you don't choose him. Is God who gives you your brothers and sisters. You just come in the word and you find out your brothers are there, your sisters are there. You don't choose them and you are obligated to accept them as they are. If you can love your brother who believe the same message like you, how are you going to love the God that you don't see? How are you going to love your enemy? Someone who criticizes. The Bible is asking us to love them. You can't even love somebody who says amen at the same time with you. When they preaching the son of man is also standing and say amen to the world. &gt;&gt; That person is saying amen the same time with you but you failing to that amen. You're failing. You say oh look at this person since he bought a new car. So when God bless one of us, it means he has blessed the entire team of us. We should be happy of a blessing of your neighbor. You know many prayers that we we make. God can respond to those prayers by one person only. God can bless one person and from the person and that person just buy a land for us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we were in a meeting last Sunday with musician or they were complaining, we we're missing this, we're missing this, we're missing that. God can just raise one person among us who can buy everything that we're missing. and those people that we're looking for. We saying that God has given us all the equipment. But God doesn't open heaven to come now. He's going to use human being. He can use you or use some among us. And I'm praying that let it be me. &gt;&gt; So you're going to say say the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Okay. Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we going to read something in the message of the end end time before we close. There's war in this world. It's because we don't want to apply the law of God. There's divorces in this world &gt;&gt; because people don't want to apply the law of God. &gt;&gt; We're going to read what the prophet is saying. So the day the world is going to apply the law of God, all the wars going to stop. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you this, this war are not going to stop because the word is already written. We need a new world. Today's word is the word of peace. The word of peace is the word that is full of love. And that world, the only person who can give it to us is the king of Salem. It's him who can give us the word of peace. But in the meantime, as his children, we've got a right. We do have right to live in peace. The king of Salem, the king of peace is our father. beyond the curtain of time. [Music] Uh from paragraph 41 just two places then we close. Okay. So, brother Bam is telling us a story of a vision that they have seen. The vision that he had when he went beyond in the sixth dimension, beyond the curtain of time of 1931, paragraph 41. Then the voice asked me, &gt;&gt; "Do you want to see beyond the c the curtain?" &gt;&gt; Then I say that will be benefit to me. So what happened? I I'm not going to be able to say what I've seen. I don't know whether I was in my body or out of my body. Or maybe I was just taken out of it. I don't know. But it wasn't like a vision. It wasn't like one of the vision that I had before. But I could see the place where I was taken out out to see myself laying down on a couch on my bed. Then I said, "Oh, it's strange." &gt;&gt; So, there was a number of people, great number of people. Yeah, I was. I'm among them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, who wasn't there? I want to see who was in that vision of William Brown. Who was in the vision? May God bless you. &gt;&gt; So we are all in that vision. All that you have loved and those who loved you all of them I gave it to unto you. Who doesn't love Braan who love who love Braan may God bless you. Now I believe that we were all in a vision. We have just forgotten. We were all in a vision. We have just forgotten. Why? Because we bypass our theophony that's why we forgot but in reality we were in that vision we were in the vision we are reading in our vision I was in that vision so if you were not there that's your problem but now listen what the vision is saying there was a great number of people and they were running toward me welcoming me saying, "Oh, our beloved brother, our precious brother." So, first it was the number of women who came to me. They were they were all young around 20 years old. They were hugging me and saying our precious brother. And the young young people, young brothers, they were all young and they their eyes were bright. They were they were shining like stars in the darkness of night and their teeth were were white like like jewelries. And they were hugging me and saying our precious brother. Then I also noticed that I became also younger. &gt;&gt; This is wonderful. I would like to be young again. You know when I was still young. I told the the youth is going to be eternal. The youth state is going to be eternal. So when I was looking to the elders, they're going to die soon, but I'm still young. But when I sleep and wake up, I see myself older. Those were calling me young brothers. Now they are dying. I don't see them anymore. But I see the little ones that getting great and greater and bigger, they are saying unto me that I'm old now. &gt;&gt; And the word is so complicated. &gt;&gt; Now Now I notice that I became also younger. &gt;&gt; I look at myself &gt;&gt; and I turn around to see my old body laying on the on the bra on the bed and my hands fall on my back. Then I said I don't understand this and I try to understand what was it where was the place where I was finding myself. Then I start becoming conscious [Music] that in the place where I was there were no yesterday or even tomorrow it was eternity and nobody seemed to be getting tired while the multitude of people the young girls the most beautiful that I've never seen before they were jumping on me hugging me. And I also noticed there was only the great feelings of love. &gt;&gt; Only a great feeling of love that was uh that was uh uh getting over me without any physical attraction as it could be in a human behavior. And I also noticed that those young girls had a long hair that reaches their wrist and they had a long skirt is long skirt that reached their wrinkles. Let me skip. I just want to skip. &gt;&gt; So to on paragraph 50 then I ask where is Jesus? &gt;&gt; I would like to see him. And those people answered is a little bit higher and one day he will come to you because you've been sent as a chief and when God will come to you he will judge you according to what you've preached then I ask are Paul and others going to be judged as me the answer was yes then I say I preach like they they preached so I didn't get a straight neither both either side. He was baptizing in the name of Jesus. I did the same. They were teaching the baptism of Holy Ghost. I did the same. So everything they teached, I also teach them. We know it. And they said and those people say one day we'll go down and Jesus will come down and judge you according to the word that you've preached. And after you will present us to him and we will go back on earth to uh to live forever. 52. &gt;&gt; So while I was now leaving that beautiful place I was and joy and as I could see it far away and many people were coming toward me just to hug me and they were saying our precious brother and suddenly I found myself again on the bed. Then I say, "God, that's what I wanted to read. Help me that I should I shouldn't do compromises about your word. Let me stick sincerely to the word of God. No matter what uh what other people can do, let me keep running toward this beautiful place. I'm more convinced that I've never been. And we should have a perfect love to enter in that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a place a a a city of peace, a city of beauty of beauty. The place where Jesus went to prepare for us and in that vision is the history repeating itself. Children of Israel were were leaving Egypt. They were going to the promised land and they got somewhere. They had to send spies. Spies went those spy came with the with the same testimony. And I'm telling you the history is still the same. We have also left all the the land is real. We want to get in there. What God have done He took our leader. He said you come and spy the land come and see what is happening in the land. Then you go with a testimony. Why did he give us that testimony to encourage us so that our faith can increase and not fall? We can keep on believing that the land exist. People are taking the flight to go and seek for that land. They will never found that land. God have taken one of us who went and visit that land. He visit the land and say the land is real. And I'm repeating you tonight that the se of it's a real land. It exist. Brother Brandham visited the land. Brother Brandham spied the land and he came with a testimony. He said, "The land that you're talking about, it existed. There's food in abundance. There's blessings in that land. This youth that is eternal." And what is he saying at the end? Only love can get in there. If you've got no love, forget about that land. &gt;&gt; Forget about it. If you've got love, may God bless you. You've got a ticket for your journey. So, we're reading the last quote. Only one paragraph, divine love of 1966, uh 1956. Paragraph 17 uh 173. Listen to what the prophet saying. &gt;&gt; Why the love was projected and uh sovereign grace of God take over. It's so important. You have to understand this. &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister. &gt;&gt; Now they're talking to me. God bless you. &gt;&gt; They also talking to who? &gt;&gt; My God bless you. &gt;&gt; So my brother and my sister, &gt;&gt; so the there's one thing that you have to do in your life. There's one thing that you have to do in your life is to love the Lord God, &gt;&gt; your God, &gt;&gt; with all your heart. with all your soul &gt;&gt; and with all your strength &gt;&gt; and with all your mind and to believe that every word that is said is true. Amen. Amen. Who does believe? May God bless you and believe that every word that you say is true. Now listen and when you get to the end of your your road that you could not move forward anymore then the sovereign grace of God the divine grace of God will be projected onto you. When God is going to project divine grace is when you've got his love in you. Then you can receive the divine grace of God. May God bless us tonight. Let us stand and we're going to pray. We're going to ask for the love of God. A shot.
