TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but as long as you don't show me what what their faith has done to me it'll be hard to believe amen because we all know the word we you know until they have received the the uh the the the holy spirit jesus christ then there will be his witness and she is [Music] you have amen all his brothers all of them knew the word all of them knew that god said that he would deliver them in terms of troubles amen they knew that you know nothing was standing before me amen they knew that they heard the ark of the government that god will always deliver them but nevertheless with all the knowledge that they made they couldn't that was the same word that those people knew it's like amen he grew up serving people you know other gods never heard about the god of israel remember when the voice spoke to him and abraham didn't doubt and believe abraham amen here you find that god promised abraham alain amen genesis chapter 15 verse 7 to verse 10. jeanette versus he said amen the bible says and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of earth of childish to give to this land to inherit it verse seven verse seven yeah fifteen verse seven chapter fifteen verse seven jesus christ and he said lord god whereby shall i know that that that i shall inherit it of three years old and a she good of three years old and a realm of three years old and a turtle off and a young pigeon hey why and he took unto him all these and divided them in the mids and he laid each piece against one another but the birds divided he not abram visa video amen to show us that you know it's good to ask for the sign to ask for signs when god is talking to you guys you know he doesn't he doesn't hurt us when we ask god's signs but here you find out that god gave abraham those signs you'll notice that all the animals that that god told him about in in in verse 9. i mean all of those animals were clean animals two centimeters amen and then he told him to take five animals you'll notice that we had a hair for a she go a ram and a turtledove in the pigeon five animals uh and then all of those animals were of three years old amen god gave him a sign that was representing jesus christ jesus christ amen you will notice that after the baptism of jesus christ to his death was three years old [Music] after the baptism of jesus christ to his death uh amen jesus was about three years old jesus i mean it was about three years apart say it wasn't the difference amen and then he gave him five clean animals and we know that number five represented grace representatives amen and then god died on calvary he divided himself he took the body and then he gave us the spirit amen these types were representing jesus christ himself tipped any more representation amen that was introducing a covenant of grace [Music] but he know but he knows his way back you know his way back home so from calvary's cross where the bruised him he made his flight from calvary and he landed in heaven's door he allowed foreign [Music] upon him you can go to him like abraham stop pleading your kids whatever you have two seconds or whatever you're going through whatever you whatever it is is battling you foreign you can go to him like abraham and stop playing your case amen because he opened up that gate open up that really that that prayer meant for you to go amen abraham hate that revelation he could go to god amen and we see that he played his case before god and jesus gave him a son and even though people could have mocked their life and even though people thought that abraham was foolish members of relation abraham knew that god i was believing abraham knew the god that he was serving so when he was going to able to god amen to offer sacrifice for free amen if someone had to be do you have a revelation about was revealed the word of god was referred to abraham that god was requiring the blood okay amen [Music] amen but you'll see that the people who gets healed it's those people that faith is revealed whatever the faithful that has answers from god it's those type of people that faith is a revelation from point a to point b in christ amen amen the bible says in romans chapter 5 verse 1 to 5. therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus also we have access by faith into the grace into this grace wherein we stand back and rejoice in hope for the glory of god and patience experience experience and experience hope and experience work with hope the patients and hope mick is not ashamed because the love of god is shared abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us when we were yet when for erectus foreign for a good man same would even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward us in that in that while we were yet sinners cross died for us please man i love verse six someone read it again the bible said that for when we were yet seniors but when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for us yet where we were where you were yet without strength counsel amen so therefore i can just go to him and he should pick he should pick a level having the faith that he already forgiven the bible clearly say that the angel told daniel before you even open your mouth yes [Music] that's what he died for him and that's why he shared his god so that we can guard him who can you push all over and bring all our needs to him and he will give us so that our joy be perfect amen because he said that you asked not because you don't want to take care of them amen he's the one who spoke the word none of us asked god to speak this god will give it to you yeah it's nothing you did yeah you didn't work yourself into faith you ever have faith if you ever have faith it's given to you by grace of god amen and god reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon the river the whole church of god is built upon the revelation of the jews the revolution that was you have to be a part of it a man has a soul but a man has a soul amen amen has a soul and therefore thus so he's a part of god and even it's and even in his fallen race in a foreign state amen yet it's the most greatest species of all species of the earth especially the species exists like there is amen and then get him in connection with his maker a menace [Music] amen because he is the son of god amen he becomes acquaintance with his maker acquainted with his maker becomes no wonder people can't believe divine healing today quite like like arizona because they haven't got nothing to believe [Music] there the pancake how can this be even commercial and explain it all the way hey you value explicit amen but when god ever takes his position into a human heart [Music] you have all the attributes repetitious attention amen and the son of god is god and he has the ability to speak the word he has the ability to bring things into existence he has given amen to vindicate the presence of the lord jesus christ he has risen from the dead he lives among us i want you to uh before those philistines and it reinforced the law of god did i impose it that everything that they have given to you belongs to you and they claim you have the woman who was losing blood broke this unfortunately at that point because a woman had faith in the family and took the strength that was in jesus name and gave her the healing even this morning you can have [Music] [Music] [Music] amen so that he can go and kill and stop the scene uh uh gave that prophecy the country has done he said prophecy that the virgin shall conceive but certainly people found him as foolish how can a virgin conceive come on if you have special say amen people didn't understand the company isaiah himself didn't understand what it is but he just had a revelation but years after me amen their faith was revealed to that woman now listen mary only asks one question to the angel marina how is this going to happen amen the angel told him that you will be covered by the holy spirit after that mary didn't ask how the holy spirit will recover [Music] amen amen amen let's go to matthew chapter 13 and verse 18 to 23. lisa amen to show that it's not our works it's not it's not us that will create that faith set forth it's him who creates the phrase amen here is jesus he's giving a parable of the sword a parable of the sower matthew chapter 13 verse 18 to 23 machetes matthew chapter 13 verse 18 to 23. amen the bible say verse 18 hear you there for the parable of the sower of the sower when anyone hears the word of the kingdom now jesus here is he's giving the uh he's explaining the parable that he gave in you know the first verse of this chapter amen verse 19 he says that when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understands this and understands it not then cometh the wicked one and catch the way that which was sown in his heart this is he which received the seed by the way side lost but he that received the seed into the stony places the same is that is is he that hears the word and a nun with joy receives it [Music] himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended may inaudible among the resistance he also that received seed among the thorn among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choked the word and he becometh unfruitful seed into into the good ground is that is he that heareth the word and understand of it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some some 100 fold some 60 and some 30. [Music] how are you going to have that good that good lane [Music] amen because if you see farmers amen the land when they when they want to you know sow seeds amen you'll notice that that lane has multiple stuff i guess you've set the right darling has tones yeah there's a ping amen stones yeah yeah yeah man all kinds of things that are nice yeah to choose the to suck at the shows you know but you you have to but that farmer will have to work on the land amen and put all the chemicals met with this all the vitamins to make the land a good we had all kinds of you know of of things that will

his healing in that same you know physically the prophet wasn't healed physically amen but he saw the vision they said said columbus and he knew for certain that his healing was coming so that's why he could have stood before the church and speak that he was here amen because it because that faith was revealed to muscular fall with everything i mean he knew that it doesn't matter you know how
