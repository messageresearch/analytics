[32:43] table in the message
[32:47] to see what brother branham said about
[32:49] assembling
[32:53] brother what stood out to
[32:55] [Music]
[33:07] and addressed the audience the
[33:09] congregation
[33:13] how many times

[33:17] he thanked god
[33:20] he said i thank you lord i thank you god
[34:10] [Music]
[34:22] [Music]
[34:32] in israel
[34:35] it wasn't his adoption that made him
[34:38] faithful
[34:41] it was his faithfulness
[34:44] that set him aside for
[35:12] [Music]
[35:13] to our service to god
[35:44] [Music]
[35:54] i want to thank our pastor brother
[35:56] brooks

[36:09] if you're ever in arizona
[36:12] on arizona
[36:14] we want to invite you to come
[36:17] if you're ever in phoenix area
[36:22] in fact we're going to have your pastor
[36:34] i'm trusting he'll sing and play his
[36:36] tambourine for us too
[36:52] i've
[37:32] i would like to
[37:34] read here
[37:36] out of revelations chapter 10.
[37:41] and
[37:42] i'm going to read
[37:45] starting here well we'll start with
[37:47] verse 8.
[37:51] all of us are very familiar here with
[37:53] revelations 10 1-7
[37:59] certainly is
[38:01] the
[38:02] keynote chapter in our bible the keynote
[38:06] here of our day and its message
[38:11] days are the voice of the seventh angel
[38:30] brother branham said that john the
[38:32] apostle john in the vision
[38:39] that this book was given to him
[38:42] that in this vision he represented the
[38:45] bride of christ
[38:49] he was given this book by an angel
[38:55] brother said it was as though
[38:58] in the vision
[39:01] that john was transmitted off patmos
[39:10] into our day
[39:26] angel and brother bannon pointed out it
[39:28] was a prophet
[39:32] john was transmitted into our day
[39:35] received this message
[39:37] i believe from the same angel you and i
[39:40] received it from israel
[39:44] brother branham said that john had a
[39:46] revelation
[39:49] but did not understand it
[39:53] it's what he said
[39:55] because the history of it wasn't made
[39:57] yet
[40:00] and brother that lack of understanding
[40:02] was displayed by john is a monk
[40:07] because more than once in your bible
[40:11] john tried to worship
[40:16] the angel that showed him this book
[40:21] john knew better than to be an idolater
[40:26] john
[40:27] jesus
[40:29] rested on his bosom for three and a half
[40:31] years
[40:36] john being transmitted into our day
[40:40] receiving this message
[40:44] he thought the angel that give it to him
[40:58] what did the angel tell him
[41:02] john jean see that you do it not the
[41:06] paper because i'm of thy fellow servants
[41:11] you've been transmitted into my day
[41:15] to get this revelation
[41:18] it wouldn't be till our day that this
[41:20] angel would get it
[41:25] christ gave it to him
[41:28] christ took the book
[41:31] out of the original owner's hands in
[41:34] 1963
[41:37] chris sent it
[41:39] to the earth
[41:42] angel
[41:43] don't give it to you
[41:46] god
[42:14] man
[42:17] they asked him
[42:18] questions and answers
[42:21] i've still got you all standing
[42:24] you don't cause me to forget my church
[42:26] manners
[42:38] they asked him brother branham some say
[42:40] you're the son of man
[42:41] this is
[43:05] he's son of god son of abraham son of
[43:07] david's son of man he's the jew if he's
[43:09] the lone pista but notice your bible
[43:24] he says
[43:52] the llama
[43:55] he addressed the second portion of the
[43:57] question
[43:59] he said when she said i thought the
[44:01] pillar of fire was the sun
[44:05] the dollar fires jesus christ
[44:31] is
[44:47] you've got the glorified son of god
[44:50] you've got christ himself
[44:53] not a second person of a trinity but you
[44:56] know god himself
[44:58] spirit form on from this he wore a mask
[45:02] in our
[45:48] praise the lord
[45:50] this is your fault
[45:52] you could have just been all starchy and
[45:54] stiff
[45:56] so i wouldn't feel like this
[46:12] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[46:14] spake unto me again
[46:16] and said go
[46:18] and take the little book which is open
[46:21] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[46:23] upon the scene upon the earth
[46:34] and i went unto the angel
[46:36] and said unto him give me
[46:39] the little book
[47:08] that's exciting for me
[47:14] and he said unto me take it
[47:16] and eat it up
[47:18] and it shall make thy belly bitter
[47:21] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet
[47:34] and i took the little book out of the
[47:35] angel's hands
[47:49] let's pray
[47:50] father
[48:04] that we could lord in our age
[48:08] recognize its day
[48:11] and its message

[49:00] ourselves this lovely group of your
[49:03] redeemers

[49:43] all get quiet
[49:45] i'll pull over
[49:50] we'll see how this works out tonight
[49:53] praise the lord
[49:55] brother branham said
[50:22] revelation biblically
[50:43] [Music]
[50:50] that the honey coming into the honeycomb
[50:54] lumiere
[50:55] talking about the church being
[50:57] a buzz
[51:00] it don't sit in sect so i want to speak
[51:02] a little bit tonight
[51:05] about honey dumb
[51:21] some at some point sometimes
[51:25] they have uh sayings about the bee like
[51:29] busy as a bee
[51:31] yeah
[51:33] because bees are not slothful
[51:37] these are not lazy these are bathing sun
[51:40] in fact bees lizabe work themselves
[51:45] to death
[52:02] rather to be a strain on the hive
[52:10] rather there yeah to be a strain on the
[52:12] hive
[52:16] they will just not come back
[52:20] they'll just pass
[52:24] because they want to
[52:25] [Music]
[52:27] live
[52:28] for the other bee
[52:30] vivre
[52:44] it's made inside of the bees
[52:50] honey is made
[52:52] a fabric
[52:54] by the bee
[52:55] ingesting two things
[53:15] and also it drinks the nectar you'll see
[53:19] what the nectar which is the life of the
[53:22] flower
[53:25] the type of the word
[53:40] it must be word and spirit
[53:44] mechanics and dynamics
[53:51] the result of nectar and and pollen
[54:08] b
[54:10] honey is the only
[54:13] food source known to man
[54:19] will not grow bacteria
[54:36] crystallized in the pharaoh tombs of
[54:39] egypt
[54:42] 4 000 years old
[54:45] they heat it up
[54:47] you don't
[54:48] eat it
[54:50] and it's still edible
[54:54] it's a type of revelation
[54:57] it's gold in color see
[55:01] speaking of dears
[55:04] and it's so sweet
[55:07] everything loves honey
[55:12] everything loves honey
[55:14] you'll take a bear out in the woods
[55:17] he comes across fresh honey
[55:22] he doesn't care how many times he gets
[55:24] stung
[55:27] honey is worth it
[55:30] it's worth every trial
[55:32] it's
[55:45] oh
[55:46] it's worth it when we're tired
[55:48] it's worth it when we don't feel good
[55:51] we come to the house of god
[55:53] to receive revelations
[56:04] now the foundation of the hives
[56:09] is the wax
[56:11] comb
[56:12] see
[56:13] wax
[56:15] uh honeycomb
[56:16] uh see jimmy
[56:18] now
[56:19] the wax is actually made by the bee
[56:23] the what
[56:25] if you're
[56:26] a germatized
[56:28] born
[56:39] [Music]
[56:43] the wax comes
[56:45] out
[56:46] of the bee's body the whites saw in
[56:49] small little
[56:51] plates platelets
[56:55] and then the bee shapes
[57:00] it's shaped into a seven
[57:02] part
[57:04] cell or chamber
[57:07] fabric
[57:08] don't form the city has a foundation
[57:32] [Music]
[57:38] she
[57:49] and one of her eggs
[57:50] is enough and puts them together
[57:55] so all the bees that you see
[57:57] working
[57:59] in the flowers
[58:02] buzzing around the hives
[58:05] every one of those bees is female
[58:08] queen this is a bay if it means because
[58:10] the germantized
[58:12] egg produces a female bee lefties
[58:18] the unfertilized
[58:34] is made up of female bees
[58:36] [Music]
[58:38] brother she's a type of the bride
[58:42] now the reason she's female
[58:45] she has received the male germs
[59:03] and they all work for the common
[59:06] health and reproduction of the hives
[59:15] holds
[59:17] brood uh the
[59:19] that's the young the next generation
[59:24] generation
[59:25] and they store honey in it
[59:29] pollen and honey the
[59:42] brother that's what the church of the
[59:44] living god should be doing
[59:47] this where we come to be fed
[59:49] and see the next generation born again
[59:55] that's why they're so protective
[1:00:12] their
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:51] and brother sister there's three stages
[1:00:53] the egg goes
[1:00:54] through this is right out of science
[1:00:59] egg
[1:01:01] larva
[1:01:07] those are there's three stages
[1:01:10] justification from the sanctification
[1:01:13] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:16] and there's bees
[1:01:19] that specifically look after the brood
[1:01:22] specifically
[1:01:50] in the hive
[1:01:52] because the queen and order reproduce
[1:01:56] has to be kept at a certain temperature
[1:01:59] no matter how hot it is
[1:02:17] generate heat
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:31] brother i'm gonna let you in on a little
[1:02:32] something i haven't got to it yet
[1:02:34] these are pentecostals
[1:02:37] i'm going to prove it to you in a minute
[1:02:39] they're pentecostals
[1:02:45] so once that
[1:02:47] egg
[1:02:48] decreases it develops through those
[1:02:50] stages
[1:02:54] brother sister it's still earthbound
[1:02:58] so what they do
[1:03:00] when
[1:03:15] look
[1:03:16] and what takes place in that little
[1:03:18] chamber
[1:03:25] creation takes place
[1:03:48] and this is what it does just like john
[1:03:50] did
[1:03:52] in the book of revelation don't leave
[1:03:53] the apocalypse in the vision
[1:03:56] when the little bee
[1:03:59] is changed
[1:04:01] and it's grown its wings
[1:04:06] it hasn't flown yet nabanko couldn't
[1:04:09] because it had no wings
[1:04:12] brother under that seal it's given wings
[1:04:17] it eats
[1:04:19] the seal
[1:04:22] just like a little a chick a pep peeps
[1:04:26] itself out of the egg
[1:04:28] the little bee eats the seal
[1:04:32] he's like john ate the bomb bonjour
[1:04:34] i'm not making this
[1:04:37] this is god in his creation brother
[1:04:40] these bees have more revelation than
[1:04:42] some message folks
[1:04:45] where they eat this book
[1:04:48] feast on it this is the bread of life
[1:05:05] and then it's taught to fly
[1:05:09] it takes flying lessons
[1:05:15] it must humble itself
[1:05:18] and it's the custodian of
[1:05:33] so with its flying lessons
[1:05:38] there is a b now this is my favorite b
[1:05:44] it's called the scout b
[1:05:47] scout b scout b okay uh you've got one
[1:05:51] sitting right there
[1:05:54] you've got a a scout being named brother
[1:05:56] brooks
[1:05:57] scout be uplifted
[1:05:59] what the scout b does this is amazing
[1:06:01] it's
[1:06:01] scout b
[1:06:02] the scout bee
[1:06:05] leaves the hive
[1:06:08] and it can fly as far as five miles
[1:06:13] without a road map
[1:06:17] and because it's got the common gene
[1:06:19] within the hive
[1:06:24] with a gps
[1:06:27] gps it can find its way back
[1:06:30] no
[1:06:41] is looking
[1:06:42] for good nectar and pollen
[1:06:49] because when it comes back
[1:06:52] it's not going to preach a word-only
[1:06:54] message
[1:06:56] it's going to let the bees that are
[1:06:58] listening
[1:07:03] what it found
[1:07:05] it wasn't going to leave the nectar in
[1:07:07] the pollen just for itself
[1:07:09] it's going to share
[1:07:27] the pastor said i'm doing okay
[1:07:32] what draws if you don't know whether
[1:07:35] it's a vegetable or whether it's a tree
[1:07:37] or something
[1:07:39] in order for brother in fact bees are
[1:07:41] responsible
[1:07:44] for the pollination
[1:07:47] of our fruits and vegetables
[1:07:50] without bees
[1:07:53] we would be extinct as
[1:07:56] human beings
[1:08:01] because bees fertilize
[1:08:05] our plants and our vegetables our fruits
[1:08:10] that's why the plant knows that it
[1:08:12] cannot reproduce itself without the bees
[1:08:16] that's why it puts its flower out
[1:08:20] and the flower has color
[1:08:22] it's not trying to attract you and me
[1:08:25] no it couldn't care less
[1:08:27] we're going to eat what it produces
[1:08:30] but in order for it to produce it needs
[1:08:32] to be
[1:08:33] eaten
[1:08:36] put the flour
[1:08:58] it was such a
[1:09:00] wonderful just time i had and and our
[1:09:03] dear sister cooked us a wonderful meal
[1:09:06] but i noticed
[1:09:07] that she had a little candle on the
[1:09:09] table
[1:09:10] and had the little candle going
[1:09:13] it gave off such a nice my wife does
[1:09:15] that my family has a candles
[1:09:18] it was
[1:09:45] and the flower knows
[1:10:01] oh brother
[1:10:05] i've known this a long time
[1:10:08] brother it's so perfect
[1:10:10] our god is so personal
[1:10:13] brother don't fear the devil don't fear
[1:10:17] his circumstances
[1:10:19] god knows who you are
[1:10:21] he predestinated you
[1:10:23] or the foundations of the world
[1:10:26] and there's nothing the devil can
[1:10:42] thank the father father thank you for
[1:10:44] those
[1:10:46] ones
[1:10:49] the b is born this way
[1:10:53] the flying bee
[1:10:54] if you've ever looked close
[1:11:09] it causes an
[1:11:10] electromagnetic transition
[1:11:17] electricity
[1:11:20] and when the bee
[1:11:22] hits the flower
[1:12:07] he saw the flower he's coated in pollen
[1:12:11] i've seen him
[1:12:13] the bee will be yellow this is
[1:12:16] coated in pollen
[1:12:18] but he's got to fly back maybe miles
[1:12:35] you see those two little yellow pods on
[1:12:39] his legs
[1:12:40] when they get loaded down
[1:12:44] they can't fly very fast
[1:12:46] because they're bearing a burden
[1:13:11] and god made sure
[1:13:13] that the baskets were on both sides
[1:13:29] paul taught timothy to rightly divide he
[1:13:33] said study the word
[1:13:36] that you can be a workman not to be
[1:13:39] ashamed
[1:13:40] but rightly dividing the word of god
[1:13:43] brother you can't just take part of the
[1:13:45] message you've got to take all of the
[1:13:47] messages
[1:13:51] from genesis to revelation
[1:13:55] so once he balances those baskets
[1:14:26] that congregation gathers around the
[1:14:28] scouts
[1:14:33] and what the scout does next
[1:14:36] it's dangerous
[1:14:37] see don't see
[1:14:40] the scout be
[1:14:41] dancing
[1:14:44] they call it the honey dance
[1:14:48] i've watched it
[1:14:51] it's either in a figure eight
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:08] the scout the school only delivers
[1:15:13] his instructions through the dance the
[1:15:16] delivery
[1:15:19] and it's delivered in real time
[1:15:28] the same instructions given through that
[1:15:31] dance at noon
[1:15:34] don't work at four o'clock well no oh
[1:16:03] is to point the bees
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:14] the instructions are triangulated
[1:16:18] instructions
[1:16:28] the instructions these instructions are
[1:16:30] based on where the hive is
[1:16:33] issue
[1:16:35] giving the instructions
[1:16:39] in relation to the position of the sun
[1:16:42] at that moment
[1:16:45] and where the flower is that he got the
[1:16:49] pollen from
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:51] tasting
[1:16:53] brother
[1:16:54] that's why we've got these quotes
[1:16:58] so we can tell you where we got our
[1:17:00] pollen
[1:17:12] the instructions are for you
[1:17:28] didn't know
[1:17:42] but they've been able to finally
[1:17:43] interpret this
[1:17:46] realizing that the dance is done in
[1:17:49] correlation to the sun's position
[1:18:09] the bees that are really
[1:18:18] [Laughter]
[1:18:19] the whole group becomes pentecostals
[1:18:44] brother they get the same nectar and the
[1:18:46] same pollen for themselves
[1:18:51] rather the holy ghost isn't just for the
[1:18:53] pulpit it's for whosoever will
[1:18:57] come
[1:19:01] okay
[1:19:04] i'm gonna stop on that for a moment
[1:19:20] in this message
[1:19:23] he says
[1:19:25] take a trip with me
[1:19:30] he says i'm going to take you back
[1:19:33] before god was god
[1:19:38] because god isn't the word means object
[1:19:40] of worship
[1:19:43] before there was any space
[1:19:46] any planets
[1:19:48] there was
[1:19:56] god dwelling alone with his attributes
[1:19:59] his thoughts
[1:20:01] is invisible
[1:20:29] says in the beginning
[1:20:39] there could be nothing new for god
[1:20:43] thought-wise
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:21:12] and the word
[1:21:23] so right there brother banham says in
[1:21:25] this message
[1:21:31] now he says he says take this journey
[1:21:34] he said it was just god
[1:21:36] this great supernatural being
[1:21:40] who covered all space and all places at
[1:21:42] all times
[1:21:44] he was from everlasting to everlasting
[1:21:47] that's all there was
[1:21:52] he says now
[1:22:09] what is that sequel it's called by bible
[1:22:12] readers logos
[1:22:16] the anointing
[1:22:19] he says god
[1:22:22] gave himself birth
[1:22:26] brother every time i read that
[1:22:29] every time i say that
[1:22:32] now you can only think about that for so
[1:22:35] long
[1:22:36] as you like
[1:22:50] it
[1:23:04] created
[1:23:17] so existing
[1:23:19] for eternity at a point in his existence
[1:23:25] create his own presence
[1:23:28] there's your beginning
[1:23:32] now here's what he says next
[1:23:36] brother this is powerful
[1:23:39] equity
[1:23:42] he says now
[1:23:46] when this little halo comes
[1:23:50] he said he did it so he could begin
[1:23:54] to put himself
[1:23:58] in a position
[1:24:00] that you and i could begin to understand
[1:24:05] ultimately he wanted fellowship
[1:24:08] because we are spirit sons and daughters
[1:24:12] of god
[1:24:13] he defeated
[1:24:21] those of you that are possessed with a
[1:24:23] portion of this angelic being that
[1:24:25] resisted the devil's lie in heaven
[1:24:43] in genesis 2 was formed from the dust of
[1:24:46] the earth
[1:24:50] here's what he says now this is even
[1:24:52] before
[1:24:52] he created you and i that's the avocado
[1:24:55] we were just in thought formula
[1:25:05] but just by the eyes just supernatural
[1:25:08] we see a halo standing there
[1:25:20] now i can see him playing
[1:25:35] steps in and feels his own presence oh
[1:25:39] manifestation for the first time
[1:25:42] and the very first thing he does
[1:25:46] he plays
[1:25:48] he plays
[1:25:50] listen to this
[1:25:52] this brother this is what opened my eyes
[1:25:56] why god took such a hard stand
[1:26:00] against those that made fun of that
[1:26:03] church at pentecost
[1:26:06] in the spirit don't sit on this plane
[1:26:09] brother
[1:26:10] because that wasn't them doing it
[1:26:13] that was all my brother that was that
[1:26:15] logos
[1:26:17] this presence that came into that room
[1:26:30] they started acting foolish
[1:26:37] look at this look at this you see he
[1:26:39] said
[1:26:41] he gave birth to himself
[1:26:44] and i can see him playing around
[1:26:48] like a little child before his father's
[1:26:52] door call me um
[1:26:57] god reacted
[1:27:01] to his own presence as
[1:27:08] think about it
[1:27:09] i looked the word up in the webster
[1:27:11] dictionary
[1:27:13] the word means to frolic the more
[1:27:15] significant
[1:27:43] it means
[1:27:45] merriment
[1:27:46] it means joy
[1:27:49] means dancing don't see
[1:27:52] to frolic is to dance
[1:28:39] of that father
[1:28:44] on the day of pentecost
[1:28:47] when that holy ghost came into that room
[1:28:50] broke himself up
[1:28:52] went on them and in there
[1:29:02] just like their father
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:22] adultery
[1:29:36] blasphemy
[1:29:44] he said how did the jews cut themselves
[1:29:47] off
[1:29:50] how did the jews cut themselves
[1:29:54] remember on the day of pentecost
[1:29:57] when that 120.
[1:30:00] acting like a bunch of drunks as you can
[1:30:02] come staggering out of that upper room
[1:30:08] that
[1:30:09] peter got himself out of the gutter
[1:30:16] because they were mocking and making
[1:30:19] peter said these are not drunk like you
[1:30:22] think
[1:30:25] you didn't deny they weren't drunk
[1:30:29] they're not drunk like you
[1:30:32] think they're drunk on the new wine they
[1:30:35] saw
[1:30:36] peter
[1:30:37] took them right back to the word
[1:30:40] to them
[1:30:41] that this was prophecy coming to pass
[1:30:45] this is that which the prophet joel
[1:30:46] spoke in the last jesus i'll pour out my
[1:30:49] spirit
[1:30:51] brother i'm in the last days
[1:30:53] and i want his spirit
[1:30:55] and i don't want to be ashamed
[1:30:57] or afraid
[1:30:59] how i'm gonna act
[1:31:27] you said by making
[1:31:40] how much that means to him
[1:31:55] oh
[1:31:56] hallelujah aren't you thankful tonight
[1:31:59] for the word of god
[1:32:01] oh brother there's nothing to be afraid
[1:32:03] of
[1:32:04] i don't care what the devil tells you
[1:32:07] brother sure there's all kind of false
[1:32:10] but that has nothing to do with me
[1:32:14] okay
[1:32:16] i know i'm supposed to pull over
[1:32:18] five o'clock
[1:32:19] i don't know how long i've been
[1:32:22] i know i'll pay for it
[1:32:24] tomorrow
[1:32:34] glory to god
[1:32:38] i grew up
[1:32:41] i'm old
[1:32:43] i'm 64 years old born in 1957.
[1:32:47] in the 50s
[1:32:48] like your dear pastor
[1:32:50] because he looks younger than i do
[1:32:51] basketball
[1:32:57] but i grew up
[1:32:58] my dad was
[1:33:00] an old arkansas farm boy
[1:33:04] we always i can remember had a garden
[1:33:14] we're okay all right god bless you thank
[1:33:17] you lord
[1:33:19] so dad had a garden
[1:33:22] farm and i was very inexpensive labor
[1:33:26] um
[1:33:29] i grew up with a shovel in my hand
[1:33:33] we would prepare the garden
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:45] and then god
[1:33:47] my dear dad would hand me i never forget
[1:33:49] as a little guy
[1:33:53] onion
[1:33:54] bulbs
[1:33:57] and i liked onion balls
[1:34:00] because of their shape you knew where
[1:34:02] the top was
[1:34:06] so i was told how far apart
[1:34:08] so i'd plant that row and put those
[1:34:10] onion bulbs press them into the dirt
[1:34:22] that worried me
[1:34:24] because the corn had no top
[1:34:27] top
[1:34:29] i was so concerned because the last
[1:34:30] thing i wanted was to plant those seeds
[1:34:33] upside down and all the corn grew down
[1:34:36] and not up
[1:34:39] on this you can tell
[1:34:41] it wasn't the sharpest knife in the
[1:34:43] drawer
[1:35:12] praise the lord he was teaching me the
[1:35:15] bible
[1:35:16] didn't even know it
[1:35:20] well sure enough
[1:35:22] he would water the garden
[1:35:26] my dad was never worried about the weeds
[1:35:33] the thought of weeds did not keep him
[1:35:35] from sowing the seed
[1:35:39] of the vegetables he wanted
[1:35:50] i'm worried that we won't have enough
[1:35:51] weeds
[1:35:57] he knew they would be there
[1:35:59] because the same water that watered the
[1:36:01] seeds watered the weeds
[1:36:06] water the holy ghost waters the just and
[1:36:08] the unjust
[1:36:12] but brother i'm amazed
[1:36:15] people are so worried
[1:36:18] about somebody shouting and dancing and
[1:36:20] backsliding
[1:36:22] [Music]
[1:36:36] if you've got the
[1:37:04] down brother
[1:37:06] the weeds came
[1:37:08] he wouldn't even let me pull them up
[1:37:10] right away
[1:37:12] they were close to the road
[1:37:16] because you might uproot
[1:37:31] you shall know
[1:38:14] there's plenty for everybody
[1:38:18] but let's make sure
[1:38:20] that we're not a terror
[1:38:23] except the word of god
[1:38:25] and no substitute
[1:38:28] god bless you
[1:38:30] thank you
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:36] if we could stand and
[1:38:38] i promise to get out of the way
[1:38:44] we'll have your dear pastor
[1:38:47] to come up
[1:38:48] as a musician would you play something
[1:38:50] just softly for us tonight
[1:38:54] thank you
[1:38:56] so much
[1:39:00] god bless you sir
[1:39:02] but i would like us for just a moment
[1:39:05] if we could just
[1:39:06] take this time
[1:39:09] if we could close our eyes and family
[1:39:12] bow our heads for just a moment
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:16] our dear brother would just play
[1:39:18] something softly
[1:39:21] i know i know god has
[1:39:23] spoken
[1:39:24] to

[1:40:39] young person
