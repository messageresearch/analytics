[49:04] that is god's grace that's going to
[49:05] carry it
[49:08] out we are in the most difficult times
[49:14] pretty a time when we can now see
[49:18] the manifestations of the fifth and
[49:20] sixth i don't know
[49:25] political wars
[49:42] and cannot declare that it is the truth
[49:47] he is truly blind
[49:52] for right now we see the unfolding
[50:12] that god has given to his bride could
[50:14] you have done something
[50:15] it's unfolding as well
[50:19] amen amen what we need to see this
[50:24] evening
[50:36] [Music]
[50:51] but this is not the mind i believe god
[50:54] is working with me
[50:57] with the mind
[51:00] hallelujah when the messenger came
[51:04] called the message he declared himself
[51:10] to be a man born out of season
[51:15] born out of caesar
[51:17] [Music]
[51:18] and he came amen with a message he lived
[51:22] very newt have that come inside
[51:24] uh most of the pentecostals can i
[51:26] prepare the political team could not
[51:28] see or understand
[51:32] but this message was for a
[51:36] [Music]
[51:52] that god is a god of contrast it's you
[51:55] and you and your divine
[51:56] hallelujah so god just
[51:59] in his mind had to bring his
[52:02] final he development message
[52:07] to the gentiles at a time when the age
[52:11] would be at its best
[52:15] [Music]
[52:16] god
[52:25] he still was going to bring forth life
[52:30] hallelujah
[52:42] he not only played eleazar
[52:50] [Music]
[52:59] to hold the joshua hallelujah and he
[53:02] also played the part of jesus he now
[53:04] sees joey
[53:04] hold there's his new priest now we
[53:06] realized this morning
[53:09] that this man william brown
[53:12] was
[53:18] [Music]
[53:27] he took a nobody and he made him
[53:30] somebody you know
[53:32] hallelujah now the world didn't like him
[53:35] no no
[53:36] no nothing but he came into the world
[53:49] whatever they did in the green tree
[53:52] circuit do you have if you don't they're
[53:53] going to do it in the drive
[53:56] it feels don't hear what i'm saying in
[53:58] other words how they treated jesus
[54:01] how are they going to treat the
[54:02] christians
[54:05] hallelujah people may think we're crazy
[54:15] [Music]
[54:21] to know that i'm not of this
[54:26] [Music]
[54:35] this world is
[54:43] [Music]
[55:04] my second portion of this message
[55:08] would be entitled so i uh
[55:12] the person the person of the logos
[55:18] hallelujah because you must realize
[55:23] that god is a spirit could you eternally
[55:25] spread
[55:26] hallelujah amen and the bible has
[55:29] declared
[55:29] and abide that no man have seen him at
[55:33] any time
[55:36] hallelujah amen but in john 10
[55:39] 30. but don't make the only booty jesus
[55:43] to all the pharisees
[55:54] [Music]
[56:00] [Music]
[56:23] [Music]
[56:23] [Applause]
[56:35] [Music]
[56:55] that that was not just for william brown
[56:59] william you understand me he was the
[57:02] first fruit
[57:05] hallelujah that was waved over the bride
[57:09] so that she could see spock in his
[57:12] autopsy her
[57:13] destiny somebody help me here
[57:16] he was the first fruit but we must
[57:19] understand that he was just an example
[57:24] what
[57:27] [Music]
[57:40] [Music]
[58:03] i said i don't know about you this
[58:06] morning
[58:08] [Music]
[58:14] hallelujah i was in the mind of god of
[58:20] god
[58:24] [Music]
[58:33] the prophet god says it like this
[58:35] perfect dude
[58:37] in his thoughts don't sap on him he was
[58:39] a father
[58:42] but you cannot be a father
[58:45] without having children songs that
[58:47] brought his own form
[58:48] hallelujah
[59:11] [Music]
[59:15] there's a light that came out of god
[59:20] the company it was not the light that
[59:22] was gone
[59:24] he was clothed in light
[59:28] it was the spirit of god in there
[1:00:08] and the logos begin to dance and the
[1:00:10] logos
[1:00:11] i don't sing brother madam said father
[1:00:14] prophet
[1:00:15] that when jesus as the lord god calls
[1:00:17] israel
[1:00:18] create things also
[1:00:22] danced why he did it
[1:00:25] every time something would come
[1:00:35] when you see a man or woman anointed
[1:00:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:58] what we've come to see secret news of
[1:01:00] you is that when
[1:01:01] god used the prophet of god i truly said
[1:01:04] the prophet to you
[1:01:05] it was absolutely not only the presence
[1:01:08] of god
[1:01:36] away from
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:48] because remember when
[1:02:04] yeah he said well what do you mean
[1:02:06] brother
[1:02:07] don't you know that adam luke
[1:02:10] i don't was essential y'all know what he
[1:02:13] said
[1:02:14] essential
[1:02:18] it's not it he was he was he was
[1:02:22] a part of god that was needed
[1:02:30] you know how they do it all day
[1:02:46] is
[1:03:14] the lord
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:29] because the bible tells us
[1:03:32] that this god that was so far away
[1:03:38] don't say and now it is
[1:03:53] [Music]
[1:03:57] put on the whole arm of god
[1:04:02] how many of us know what the whole arm
[1:04:04] of god is
[1:04:07] i used to think that somehow i'm gonna
[1:04:10] i to make sure i got a helmet
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:17] i've got to make sure i have a uh i mean
[1:04:21] a shield of faith
[1:04:39] different japan secrecy
[1:04:42] indifferent of the armor the difference
[1:04:46] but i came to know me the armor is one
[1:04:50] piece
[1:04:51] it used to work
[1:04:58] and paul put it in simplicity and paul
[1:05:01] likes because that's something
[1:05:02] he said put on christ
[1:05:19] what god had in store for us
[1:05:24] he tried to make us see he said that we
[1:05:26] did not come to be
[1:05:28] just church members
[1:05:33] we are a new
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:48] all
[1:06:16] sometimes we think that christ
[1:06:20] is different from elohim
[1:06:25] hello hello and you know why we somehow
[1:06:28] think that
[1:06:29] hey papa
[1:07:05] we've seen the pentecostal movement
[1:07:07] really move on the point
[1:07:09] and the pentecostal movement because
[1:07:12] they would not move on with malachi
[1:07:14] 4.
[1:07:18] they they have done more harm
[1:07:22] to the gospel of christ than good he's
[1:07:24] on joseph
[1:07:25] he's only tweeted
[1:07:40] hallelujah
[1:07:43] if there is such a thing of evolution
[1:07:46] see the evolution hallelujah
[1:07:50] then the bride of jesus christ is
[1:07:52] evolving
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:08] spiritual man hallelujah is that right
[1:08:12] and this is what corinthians 15 says the
[1:08:15] secular book
[1:08:16] yes we bore the image of the earth
[1:08:20] we shall also build the image of the
[1:08:22] heavens

[1:08:27] my face
[1:08:29] that is earthly long
[1:08:32] but the main inside melon hallelujah

[1:08:40] so that you understand what we were
[1:08:44] yesterday yeah cannot remain
[1:08:49] hallelujah what's the true baptism of
[1:08:52] the holy ghost

[1:09:04] son hallelujah she had put on christ

[1:51:05] jesus bringing in the brotherly love and
[1:51:09] brotherly kindness
[1:51:14] and then you see the divine love kicking
[1:51:15] in
[1:51:17] not only did he forgive his brothers
[1:51:32] and
[1:51:59] for 14 years
[1:52:14] and put him in jacob's tent and i've
[1:52:17] immediately had those i don't
[1:52:18] that was his godliness
[1:52:26] he felt defiled is that right excuse me
[1:52:30] yeah you did that's why he was mad
[1:52:33] but he didn't he didn't go at his his
[1:52:35] father-in-law and beat him up
[1:52:39] but let me put it this way so you can
[1:52:42] understand
[1:52:56] problem says she was ugly and uh
[1:53:03] you know when the bible said you don't
[1:53:04] look too good you don't look too good
[1:53:06] you see that
[1:53:08] that's my bad that's my bad hallelujah
[1:53:15] so he's being tested so united prove it
[1:53:19] his heart was for rachel
[1:53:22] but god was building characters
[1:53:36] when you talk about virtue you look
[1:53:38] throughout the scriptures and then you
[1:53:39] find out that when jacob
[1:53:41] why can't jacob come to the place of
[1:53:43] brotherly kindness
[1:53:46] he had to forgive uh uh
[1:53:49] esau esau had to
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:54:05] he had enough godliness in him
[1:54:09] to know that the righteous cannot dwell
[1:54:11] in the tent of the unrighteous
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:16] and that's something we need to learn
[1:54:18] can you devote
[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:55:02] jesus
[1:55:45] is that only thing you'll do you can't
