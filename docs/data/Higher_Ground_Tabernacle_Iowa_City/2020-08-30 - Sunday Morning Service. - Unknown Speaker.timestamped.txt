[50:29] that are in earth visible and invisible
[50:32] whether there be thrones
[50:33] or dominions or principalities or powers
[50:36] all things were created by him
[50:53] he is before all all things and by him
[50:56] all things consists of want to choose
[51:00] etude churches but only
[51:03] he is the head of the body the church
[51:06] who is the beginning
[51:07] the the firstborn from the dead that in
[51:10] all things he might have the preeminence
[51:25] please the father that in him should all
[51:28] fullness dwell
[51:29] god you have looked at plenitude
[51:34] and heaven made peace through the blood
[51:35] of his cross
[51:37] by him to reconcile all things unto
[51:40] himself
[51:41] by him i say what they'll be throwing
[51:44] things in earth
[51:45] or things in heaven
[52:02] father we so thank you for your grace
[52:04] this morning
[52:07] thank you for being so good to us
[52:12] we thank you for the protection that you
[52:14] give us
[52:17] as we travel along the dangerous streets
[52:20] and highways
[52:25] we pray this morning that the people
[52:28] would be blessed
[52:30] the purpose we pray lord god that you
[52:33] will open our
[52:34] eyes of our hearts
[52:38] and give us understanding in revelation
[52:42] give us a zeal lord to press forward
[52:47] in this evil day don't say this movie
[52:50] have your way to this morning
[52:52] oh paul paul controlled in jesus
[52:54] christ's name we pray
[52:57] amen amen you may be seated as well
[53:04] we have been really uh
[53:08] working by god's grace with
[53:11] things of the seals and of the thunders
[53:13] and things of that nature
[53:21] and to be honest with you i'm really
[53:26] anticipating
[53:28] coming of the lord when god
[53:31] would change our bodies from mortal to
[53:35] immortality
[53:39] brother branham in this little quote
[53:42] [Music]
[53:45] coming from the uh identified
[53:48] masterpiece of god
[53:49] oh vernon the um all right
[53:54] let's
[54:03] and he said it like this he said
[54:06] anything to choose that's in the bible
[54:09] is inspired
[54:11] by the spirit whether it is history
[54:15] whether it's songs whatever it is
[54:20] it's inspired jesus said
[54:24] jesus have not you read what david said
[54:27] in the psalms
[54:31] and then i think er psalms of course
[54:34] is songs lip song yes your
[54:38] and if songs are inspired of god they
[54:40] see something
[54:41] which i believe they are you sacrificing
[54:44] prophetic also uh prophecy
[54:48] and i hope i am standing that day
[54:51] there's your quackers
[54:52] when this song comes to pass god says
[54:57] there is going to be a meeting in the
[54:59] air in your heart
[55:00] you know in the sweet sweet by and by
[55:17] such singing ever heard
[55:32] will be the leading one
[55:36] at that meeting in the air
[55:39] he says oh what a time ladies
[55:43] i'm sorry he says oh i want to be there
[55:48] at that time
[55:51] this is why i believe that the message
[55:55] of the hour
[55:58] goes beyond all that we have been taught
[56:06] because the things that are that were
[56:07] taught in the church
[56:11] could not bring us to perfection
[56:16] it actually took the opening of the word
[56:21] it took the mystery of malach of
[56:24] revelation
[56:25] 10. let me say this in malachi
[56:28] 4.
[56:30] [Music]
[56:40] nothing man made uh
[56:56] sets us free
[56:59] i'm gonna say that again the opening of
[57:02] the word
[57:04] which we know as the third pool
[57:08] sets us free
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:37] is what we raise you up again
[57:42] that word is what will raise you up
[57:45] again
[57:47] you become part of that word
[57:51] you identified with
[57:58] [Music]
[58:06] he said
[58:11] [Music]
[58:28] and you know i have tried to tell us
[58:32] that even though the message have not
[58:33] become an organization
[58:36] we have systemized our worship system
[58:40] and it has gotten to a place right
[58:43] through this system
[58:46] we literally shut him out
[59:02] we claim
[59:06] and here god has moved forward
[59:11] and we want to stay in the seventh age
[59:13] instead of the eighth
[59:14] floor and then we argue with one another
[59:19] and whether we in the eighth day or the
[59:22] eighth age
[59:25] when god has clearly
[59:28] pronounced the change
[59:44] when the seals were open and the seven
[59:47] thunders uttered their voices hallelujah
[59:51] god did not do that
[59:55] in the seventh city he did it in the
[59:58] eighth faith
[1:00:01] somebody help me here see we must
[1:00:03] understand
[1:00:05] that we must move forward
[1:00:08] we can't stay where we used to be
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:39] but when you see that god has done a
[1:00:43] dispensation on change
[1:00:46] hallelujah you move forward into that
[1:00:49] change
[1:00:51] what was good for laodicea
[1:00:54] it's not
[1:01:07] just like what was in
[1:01:22] to see a rapture fulfill on left more
[1:01:26] hallelujah is that right because we
[1:01:29] realized that the age of leonis
[1:01:33] has already been judged
[1:01:37] god found them lukewarm
[1:01:40] and he has spilled them out of his mouth
[1:01:44] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[1:01:50] how
[1:01:56] and speaking in tongues is that the
[1:01:59] pentecostal church
[1:02:01] do now secondly god still have
[1:02:05] judged them dead
[1:02:09] hallelujah they have a name that they
[1:02:12] live
[1:02:13] and they are dead listen
[1:02:18] you and i must be careful
[1:02:21] we must be watchful because the same
[1:02:24] devil that slipped lay on the seer into
[1:02:28] blindness
[1:02:31] can also slip us into blindness
[1:02:35] somebody help me here you see this is
[1:02:38] why
[1:02:38] it's an individual walk this is why god
[1:02:42] is calling for
[1:02:43] individuals individuals who will
[1:02:46] love him with all of their hearts
[1:02:50] is that right who will love him
[1:02:53] with all of their hearts
[1:02:56] hallelujah brother talks about
[1:03:26] the music was great no doubt they were
[1:03:29] shouting and dancing
[1:03:31] hallelujah and they thought that's what
[1:03:33] god was looking for
[1:03:36] somebody help me here you see because
[1:03:38] paul says
[1:03:40] you can have faith to move mountains
[1:03:54] and it still will profit you nothing
[1:03:57] if you don't have divine love
[1:04:01] hallelujah a man is not saved
[1:04:06] because he's a preacher a man is not
[1:04:09] saved
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:25] and he's able to see the light
[1:04:29] of his day y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:04:33] you must see the light
[1:04:36] of your day you must
[1:04:40] follow the pillar of fire
[1:04:44] you must stay in tune with the holy
[1:04:47] spirit
[1:04:48] and what he's doing for this day
[1:04:52] my message
[1:04:59] i'm anticipating a greater move of god
[1:05:04] among the bride of jesus christ
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:20] you know
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:34] when the bride comes to understand who
[1:05:37] jesus is
[1:05:41] he did not say when the bride comes to
[1:05:44] understand who the father
[1:05:46] is he said when the bride comes
[1:05:50] to know who jesus is
[1:05:53] see you said amen he did not say it he
[1:05:56] said when the bride
[1:05:57] comes to know who she is
[1:06:00] i didn't mean to trick you but when the
[1:06:03] bride comes to know who she
[1:06:04] is the rapture will take place
[1:06:09] so you must understand the move is
[1:06:12] on for the bride
[1:06:30] those things that are unfolding are
[1:06:33] unfolding
[1:06:35] for the bride to come into her position
[1:06:41] so that she will recognize who she is
[1:07:09] and then god began to unfold himself
[1:07:24] but that wasn't the final uh unfolding
[1:07:27] of god
[1:07:28] he then unfolded himself into a man
[1:07:33] somebody help me here until we recognize
[1:07:38] that we are part of the godhead
[1:07:42] somebody help me here you see because
[1:07:45] adam was a part of the godhead
[1:07:48] i don't know oh somebody am i preaching
[1:07:50] what he preached
[1:07:52] because you and i must understand when
[1:07:55] god
[1:07:56] unfolded himself into a man don't you
[1:07:58] say
[1:07:59] transform finish
[1:08:03] he rested from his labor
[1:08:07] hallelujah but it was the devil
[1:08:11] amen who broke the very system of god
[1:08:16] hallelujah because when sin entered in
[1:08:21] adam lost the ability
[1:08:24] to have that communion with god
[1:08:28] by way of his body
[1:08:31] hallelujah nothing could change what
[1:08:35] adam was on the inside but now his flesh
[1:08:38] was defiled
[1:08:40] and satan had become god of the whole
[1:08:44] world
[1:08:45] hallelujah amen this is why satan
[1:08:50] for
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:19] if we we could most of us if we could
[1:09:21] peel off this flesh
[1:09:25] we will stand perfect
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:29] because the inside has already been
[1:09:32] regenerated
[1:09:45] to redeem your body
[1:09:48] hallelujah it's not just redeeming of
[1:09:50] the soul
[1:09:52] hallelujah because those of us
[1:09:55] who was with god from the foundation of
[1:09:59] the world
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:14] so you got to realize that had to come
[1:10:18] something okay
[1:10:21] that could sanctify us
[1:10:25] not only sanctifiers
[1:10:38] is that right remember the last
[1:10:41] thing to be changed
[1:10:56] the redemption of your what body
[1:10:59] but your soul in spirit has already been
[1:11:03] redeemed
[1:11:05] you see we got to understand god
[1:11:09] you must have
[1:11:23] could never be animals that had been
[1:11:26] yoked
[1:11:28] they had to be free animals
[1:11:31] you understand what i'm saying so in
[1:11:34] order for god to
[1:11:36] bring us into a complete redemption
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:12:02] and the thing about it is i believe that
[1:12:04] so many of us are still not
[1:12:06] understanding
[1:12:20] when you have to dress on uh uh preach
[1:12:22] on dress codes
[1:12:24] it shows that that individual is not
[1:12:27] maturing
[1:12:29] or is not matured
[1:12:32] is that all right remember
[1:12:36] amen the god is coming for a matured
[1:12:38] bride
[1:12:40] he's not coming for children
[1:12:43] per se you understand what i mean by
[1:12:44] that he's coming for
[1:12:47] one who knows what to do
[1:12:51] is that right because uh
[1:12:55] is that right he explained to rebecca
[1:12:59] because oh uh uh uh that that abraham
[1:13:03] it first for his son isaac
[1:13:06] right and he began to explain
[1:13:10] amen to her what isaac
[1:13:14] liked is that right and
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:29] it was only when she saw him she
[1:13:33] leaped off of her camel and brother said
[1:13:36] that was likened to the rapture
[1:13:38] she lifted up her camel unveiled herself
[1:13:44] and went into isaac's tent
[1:13:48] hallelujah and isaac's tense was his
[1:13:51] mama's tent
[1:13:54] which was sarah's tent which was the old
[1:13:58] time religion
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:08] let me hurry up here now i'm moving too
[1:14:10] slow
[1:14:12] so
[1:14:16] is it time sir that's good i miss you
[1:14:19] you know a lot of people think that
[1:14:23] brother branham knew everything
[1:14:26] and he did oh you better not say that
[1:14:32] but there was times he did not know
[1:14:37] and god had to reveal it to
[1:14:41] is him right you remember when that
[1:14:44] blast he kept seeing that vision of a
[1:14:46] blast
[1:14:48] brother branham thought brother
[1:14:51] thought he was going to die
[1:15:22] he knew it was a message from god
[1:15:24] somebody helped me
[1:15:26] and he knew that something was coming
[1:15:28] forth but he didn't know what it was
[1:15:31] that was the main part hallelujah
[1:15:35] but then god comes along hallelujah
[1:15:40] oh somebody help me here in 1963
[1:15:46] when that blast went off constant the
[1:15:49] reality of the dream
[1:15:59] and when god when that prophet we get
[1:16:02] took that cockapoo
[1:16:04] off
[1:16:19] now you know people want to argue with
[1:16:21] that description yourself
[1:16:23] that was a pre rapture call it what you
[1:16:27] want to do
[1:16:28] but if the angels had taken him up in
[1:16:30] the clouds
[1:16:32] he
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:39] and if he had gone that high he would
[1:16:42] have froze to death
[1:16:50] you agree with me that's good so
[1:16:52] something supernatural took place
[1:16:56] and he was caught up into the clouds
[1:17:00] now you must he was he he was caught up
[1:17:04] is that what that's right the scripture
[1:17:06] says
[1:17:07] that one day we will see him
[1:17:11] face to face
[1:17:15] somebody help me here and so you see
[1:17:18] he was caught up and it was
[1:17:22] 1963 1965
[1:17:26] two years later
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:35] even the prophet of god at that point
[1:17:39] up until two years later had never seen
[1:17:42] the face of god
[1:17:45] in the cloud hallelujah
[1:17:49] this is very significant
[1:17:52] because at this time sit down
[1:17:55] something changed there was no longer
[1:18:00] he was no longer the messenger
[1:18:03] if i could say it like this of the seven
[1:18:06] church
[1:18:06] ages only he was kind of like
[1:18:10] john the baptist he stood in the midst
[1:18:15] of two ages of two time changes
[1:18:19] he was the actually covenant angel that
[1:18:22] god had brought to us in this day
[1:18:25] hallelujah he was bringing a new
[1:18:28] covenant
[1:18:29] to a new people hallelujah
[1:18:32] this was not for laodicea this message
[1:18:36] is for the bride age
[1:18:37] only those
[1:18:40] who comes out of laodicea will be able
[1:18:44] to see
[1:18:44] the message of the hour
[1:18:48] hallelujah brother branham didn't bring
[1:18:51] his true message
[1:19:00] you know what this is what he said he
[1:19:02] kept telling us
[1:19:04] i got to go away i gotta
[1:19:09] two prophets can't be on the scene at
[1:19:11] the same time
[1:19:14] that's what he said he said two can't be
[1:19:18] who is the eighth one now hallelujah
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:28] every country every country brother
[1:19:32] but all of you everyone got an eighth
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:48] was to introduce rebecca to isaac
[1:19:52] hallelujah it wasn't going to be ella
[1:19:55] easy coming from the team
[1:20:00] who came out of the tent he ever knew
[1:20:02] that it wasn't abraham
[1:20:05] it was isaac
[1:20:09] the introduction was to isaac
[1:20:13] is that right this message was to
[1:20:22] why because many of us knew him
[1:20:26] as a denomination uh with the
[1:20:28] denomination revelations
[1:20:32] but we have to come to see him
[1:20:35] as he is oh somebody help me and we
[1:20:39] know that the bible says as he
[1:20:42] is so are we
[1:20:45] in this present wow now i want you to
[1:20:48] think about that
[1:20:50] because if you don't know who you are
[1:20:53] you will never know what you come to do
[1:20:59] is that right see god unfolded himself
[1:21:02] to adam
[1:21:05] but in adam there was still another
[1:21:08] mystery
[1:21:10] hallelujah so god cuts adam open
[1:21:14] he breaks the seal somebody help me here
[1:21:18] and he pulls adam out
[1:21:21] i didn't say i said he pulls adam out
[1:21:26] and then he began to express to adam
[1:21:30] who she is and where
[1:21:34] she came from you understand me
[1:21:38] so you got to understand that this
[1:21:40] message
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:08] um
[1:22:23] see but we're so afraid of that i know
[1:22:26] something
[1:22:27] we are we're afraid to say we're joined
[1:22:30] heirs with christ
[1:22:34] we're afraid to say we can be
[1:22:48] and we must stand on that word
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:23:03] that's been proven to be the
[1:23:04] supernatural
[1:23:14] he says to me it was the same light that
[1:23:17] struck down
[1:23:18] saint paul it was the same light that
[1:23:22] led the children of israel by night
[1:23:27] did you notice here his angel
[1:23:30] he was clothed in a cloud
[1:23:34] now listen brother branham is always
[1:23:38] speaking in parables
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] this message is not given to everybody
[1:23:48] the intellectual can pick up this
[1:23:51] message
[1:23:52] and he may be able to explain something
[1:23:55] intellectual
[1:23:57] but he'll miss the revelation of it
[1:24:00] a million miles away
[1:24:05] hallelujah there were times
[1:24:10] if you listen to the tapes it seems like
[1:24:13] brother brandon was stuttering around
[1:24:15] so they come see the prophet beginning
[1:24:18] and the whole time he did it
[1:24:22] to confuse the intellect
[1:24:26] things he was trying to says
[1:24:41] so he would just go around answering
[1:24:44] their questions
[1:24:47] for an example jesus christ is the same
[1:24:50] yesterday today and forever
[1:24:54] they asked jesus christ a question
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:22] and they said now if we say
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:37] then the people gonna stone us
[1:25:41] hallelujah so they came up with
[1:25:44] so you saw a political correct answer
[1:25:48] [Music]
[1:25:50] we cannot tell and then jesus
[1:25:54] said i cannot tell you
[1:25:58] if you're not gonna tell me i'm not
[1:26:02] gonna tell you
[1:26:04] but then he goes on to say but my
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:19] you and i ought to be in in anticipation
[1:26:23] brother branham has been going off the
[1:26:25] scene for more than 50 years now
[1:26:29] hallelujah is that right and we know
[1:26:32] that a generation
[1:26:34] is about 40
[1:26:42] i knew somebody should be on the scene
[1:26:45] somebody that's going to
[1:26:46] hear what the spirit is saying to the to
[1:26:50] the bride of christ
[1:26:53] hallelujah you don't believe that
[1:26:56] it is the truth because remember
[1:27:01] when joshua
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:14] now if you say today that brother
[1:27:15] branham is dead they want to stone
[1:27:23] tell the people that moses is there
[1:27:26] now was moses that's the most no no
[1:27:30] but what he was saying is that the
[1:27:33] ministry of moses
[1:27:35] has come to an end
[1:27:38] hallelujah and now joshua is on the
[1:27:41] scene
[1:27:42] somebody help me here we are no longer
[1:27:45] here to be
[1:27:46] spectators
[1:27:50] hallelujah in moses day everybody waited
[1:27:53] to see moses do miracles
[1:27:56] is that right people went all down to
[1:27:58] jeffersonville to see
[1:28:00] god do miracles to through william
[1:28:02] branham
[1:28:03] and then william brandon was trying to
[1:28:05] tell the people god can do miracles
[1:28:08] through you
[1:28:10] hallelujah and what he was doing
[1:28:13] he was literally preparing the people
[1:28:16] for the ministry that would come after
[1:28:18] him
[1:28:21] oh come on somebody so you can
[1:28:24] understand
[1:28:25] that when when joshua
[1:28:29] you know this this came through uh
[1:28:31] brother ben because
[1:28:32] he this message it struck me so so well
[1:28:37] he said joshua made the people
[1:28:40] participate
[1:28:55] amen to take them in hallelujah
[1:28:58] and you failed to see the prophet of god
[1:29:02] without the pill of fire was just a man
[1:29:05] it did so much hallelujah
[1:29:09] y'all understand you understand where we
[1:29:11] are
[1:29:12] but he came to show us that the power
[1:29:16] and the authority
[1:29:18] in which he had was the same kind of
[1:29:21] power
[1:29:22] and authority that was to come on the
[1:29:25] bride of jesus christ
[1:29:28] he was just a wave shielded he was the
[1:29:32] power of god in a man
[1:29:35] born by a woman hallelujah
[1:29:38] he was showing the redemption power
[1:29:41] of the blood of jesus christ that not
[1:29:44] only was the blood able
[1:29:47] to cleanse us from our sins
[1:29:52] had the power to positionally place us
[1:29:56] back in the place where we had fallen oh
[1:29:59] let me get back with this
[1:30:02] so you know this message
[1:30:18] is that right because joshua was also a
[1:30:21] type of
[1:30:22] uh a furtherance if i say it
[1:30:25] joshua was a furtherance of the
[1:30:27] commandment of adam
[1:30:30] joshua was a further runs
[1:30:37] in the sense that he had to possess the
[1:30:39] land
[1:30:40] is that right god told adam
[1:30:43] should do everything don't mean to
[1:30:46] choose
[1:30:47] bring that bring it into subjection i'm
[1:30:50] meant to choose
[1:30:51] in other words i have given you dominion
[1:30:55] and everything must be subject to you
[1:30:59] that is the move that's on the right
[1:31:02] she's going to be tried she's going to
[1:31:06] be tested
[1:31:07] but you and i have the ability
[1:31:11] the ability the possibility of bringing
[1:31:14] everything into subjection
[1:31:19] hallelujah why because god has given us
[1:31:23] in this ministry
[1:31:26] amen preeminence
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:42] nothing shall stand in your way if you
[1:31:45] can get the people to believe
[1:31:47] nothing shall stand in your way
[1:31:50] hallelujah
[1:31:51] if that's what's happening with us now
[1:31:54] if you believe
[1:31:55] i'm bringing it down to you if you
[1:31:57] believe
[1:31:58] i'mma say it again if you believe
[1:32:02] nothing shall stand in your way
[1:32:05] man hallelujah it didn't he didn't say
[1:32:09] it wouldn't come
[1:32:10] and i find the country but he said you
[1:32:12] would gain victory over it
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:16] can i say it like this your lady victory
[1:32:29] it was the same light that led the
[1:32:31] children of israel by night
[1:32:34] did you notice here's the angel he was
[1:32:36] clothed in a cloud see
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:51] not understanding first
[1:32:55] thought it was wrong that i was just
[1:32:58] saying that
[1:33:00] but the holy spirit happened to hide the
[1:33:02] scientific
[1:33:03] instruments
[1:33:07] and the people there were for
[1:33:08] vindication
[1:33:11] and took the picture of it
[1:33:14] several times that all right
[1:33:18] from shillong and that the gross
[1:33:22] darkness that's upon the church
[1:33:26] things today to fail to see the light
[1:33:29] that's shining see
[1:33:31] monk there seemed to be
[1:33:34] such a heavy press
[1:33:39] we take some of the noted evangelists
[1:33:41] today
[1:33:43] they are constantly screaming for a
[1:33:44] revival
[1:33:46] and working against it
[1:34:02] now we've seen
[1:34:16] you got the only truth there is in the
[1:34:18] world
[1:34:19] no that is wrong see no i'm
[1:34:22] only saying it in the light of the hour
[1:34:25] that we're
[1:34:26] walking in
[1:34:30] hallelujah now he didn't say other
[1:34:32] people didn't have truth
[1:34:36] but he said it in such a way a wise way
[1:34:41] hallelujah well he says listen but i'm
[1:34:43] just trying to tell you
[1:34:45] he could have said oh that's right he
[1:34:48] could have easily said no they don't
[1:34:49] have truth
[1:34:51] because what was truth yesterday is not
[1:34:52] true
[1:34:56] but he says no i'm just working
[1:35:11] and for the benefit of the people
[1:35:18] jesus said no man can can come to me
[1:35:22] except my father draws him no man will
[1:35:25] never see it
[1:35:28] it's the soup it's it's that
[1:35:30] predestinated seed
[1:35:34] that only is going to receive it
[1:35:37] but we come to that place again
[1:35:43] that you're the light of the world
[1:35:47] oh my goodness hallelujah
[1:35:50] what was it you know brother branham
[1:35:53] couldn't you say listen
[1:36:03] you see what i'm saying they would have
[1:36:05] the devil would have twisted that thing
[1:36:08] he could have easily
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:36] the intellect
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:50] going back to the cloud going back to
[1:36:53] the cloud
[1:36:54] because in the opening of the seventh
[1:36:57] seal
[1:36:58] without you i explained that to you all
[1:37:00] the last time
[1:37:01] in the opening of the seven seals
[1:37:04] six of those seals had already been
[1:37:06] opened sisters were so hungry
[1:37:08] through the time of history because they
[1:37:10] didn't know it
[1:37:13] they had no idea what was going on
[1:37:16] but they god used them each one of those
[1:37:20] angel was being used hallelujah
[1:37:24] oh come on somebody oh but then when the
[1:37:28] seventh angel came
[1:37:29] to city that's how we know it's the end
[1:37:31] of the day
[1:37:32] we
[1:37:45] he was the mighty angels
[1:37:56] the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:37:59] of god
[1:38:13] and when it unveiled itself it
[1:38:16] constituted the violence it was the
[1:38:18] mighty angels
[1:38:24] is he not a god of immorphy
[1:38:27] he's a god that changes his mass
[1:38:30] hallelujah he was god the word standing
[1:38:34] right there protecting the world
[1:38:41] and found out that the tomb was empty
[1:38:44] somebody helped me here
[1:38:47] been the same by the angel that
[1:38:50] resurrected
[1:38:52] comes in revelation 10 1.
[1:38:56] hallelujah jesus stood there
[1:38:59] this is your idea as a man did you see
[1:39:01] me at the tomb of lazarus
[1:39:03] that same body anger hallelujah who was
[1:39:07] god himself
[1:39:10] said that i
[1:39:22] he came with the book opener
[1:39:52] and if the seventh seal was open under
[1:39:54] the sixth see
[1:39:56] the seventh seal could not be opened
[1:39:59] until the seventh angel messenger came
[1:40:03] hallelujah in other words that was his
[1:40:07] true ministry
[1:40:10] amen is that right
[1:40:13] because he said every messenger comes at
[1:40:16] the
[1:40:17] end of the age yeah so he came
[1:40:20] at the end of laodicea and if he came at
[1:40:23] the end of laying this here

[1:41:23] what they had to do
[1:41:24] the only thing they had to do is to
[1:41:27] believe what moses said
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:42] how do you know when a man but don't
[1:41:44] believe me

[1:42:33] leave egypt when joseph died
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:53] they had it so easy god had to raise up
[1:42:56] a pharaoh who did not know joseph
[1:42:58] 24 11
[1:43:01] hallelujah come on somebody let me tell
[1:43:04] you like this
[1:43:06] wait in the time of william branham even
[1:43:09] the white house knew who you are
[1:43:13] political leaders from here to england

[1:43:17] but now we're living in a generation
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:20] knows nothing about joseph
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:36] and guess what's happening we the bride
[1:43:39] of jesus christ
[1:43:41] we are taking it so easy

[1:43:55] don't read our messages
[1:43:59] hello we're too busy
[1:44:02] we're too relaxed

[1:45:03] hallelujah oh that's good revival is not
[1:45:06] adding more to the church
[1:45:09] all of that's good revival is taking
[1:45:12] that thing that
[1:45:13] already is and cleaning it
[1:45:17] up hallelujah that means the bride needs
[1:45:20] a cleaning up
[1:45:22] and she's got to clean up there is no
[1:45:26] spot

[1:46:13] as long as you you are in the church you
[1:46:16] are secured with the church
[1:46:18] you get it now then how do we get
[1:46:21] into the church by joining no no
[1:46:33] but by one spirit that's first
[1:46:36] corinthians 12.
[1:46:38] we are baptized into one fellowship
[1:46:41] and in there as long as we're in this
[1:46:44] fellowship
[1:46:46] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[1:46:49] continually
[1:46:51] god looking through the red as we had
[1:46:53] last night see
[1:46:57] and it's a red sinner but you see
[1:47:01] you white through the red blood
[1:47:05] so uh
[1:47:18] some of us ought to be you know
[1:47:31] oh lord have mercy god don't
[1:47:48] that sees the giants in the land and
[1:47:51] come back and say we can't do it
[1:47:54] we've got to be like joshua
[1:47:58] is that right lord we are more than able
[1:48:02] to conquer this land oh i'm coming to
[1:48:05] you
[1:48:06] we are more than able to put this
[1:48:09] disobedient body
[1:48:10] under subjection hallelujah paul said
[1:48:14] you must crucify this flesh
[1:48:16] you
[1:48:31] what was this uh uh uh seals opening
[1:48:35] brother branham showed us what was under
[1:48:37] the fifth seal in the sixth seal and
[1:48:40] all of these things and he began to say
[1:48:42] that each
[1:48:57] is that right and we didn't even know
[1:49:00] that
[1:49:01] we we just saw history we didn't know
[1:49:03] what
[1:49:04] we didn't know that that was here
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] is that right and then he begins to tell
[1:49:12] us
[1:49:13] that the first woe was world war one
[1:49:17] and the second woe is world war ii
[1:49:20] and in between world war ii and world
[1:49:22] war three the rapture has to take place
[1:49:25] hallelujah now the move is on for the
[1:49:28] bride
[1:49:30] so now the economy has crashed
[1:49:34] right you haven't seen nothing yet you
[1:49:37] just heard the news yesterday or the
[1:49:38] other day
[1:49:39] where the stock market has crashed you
[1:49:41] don't know it has crashed
[1:49:44] and nobody knows how it's going to be
[1:49:46] picked up a person
[1:49:48] hallelujah but every nation
[1:49:51] is undetermined hallelujah is that right
[1:49:56] you know that's the truth if i run out
[1:49:58] of food
[1:50:00] and my neighbors got food i'm gonna
[1:50:03] break into my neighbor's house
[1:50:08] hallelujah now i don't know whether you
[1:50:11] captured some of these things
[1:50:15] but brother told us he said the russian
[1:50:17] soldiers
[1:50:19] will be upon our soil
[1:50:22] that's what he said
[1:50:35] and now trump
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:48] like what we gonna do we got to choose
[1:50:52] the lesser evil
[1:50:54] if there is a less senior
[1:51:00] y'all understand what i'm saying because
[1:51:03] pelosi is saying i heard of myself
[1:51:06] and i know i shouldn't be preaching
[1:51:08] politics but i'm trying to bring you to
[1:51:09] somewhere
[1:51:10] she's basically saying even if
[1:51:13] trump wins he will not remain
[1:51:18] president
[1:51:30] the democrats these liberals
[1:51:47] you don't america has never been in a
[1:51:49] situation before
[1:51:51] maybe in other countries y'all have seen
[1:51:52] it happen but in america we've never
[1:51:56] we've never gone hungry
[1:51:59] y'all understand me and so now it's a
[1:52:02] place where
[1:52:04] everybody is really frustrated we're
[1:52:07] frustrated about the math
[1:52:12] i don't mean not but we are most of us
[1:52:14] we are
[1:52:15] now you and i know that that that the
[1:52:18] coronal virus is real
[1:52:21] it really is but but anyway
[1:52:24] you know everybody's tired of being
[1:52:25] controlled is what i'm trying to say
[1:52:28] so now we know what's going to happen if
[1:52:31] they come if trump wins trump
[1:52:35] it's going to be a war and if
[1:52:38] nancy
[1:52:42] lord forgive my thoughts about that lady
[1:52:51] it's going to be a war so we're
[1:52:54] right now why because we've got too many
[1:52:58] riots going on now
[1:53:00] this is something we never had like on
[1:53:02] the scale
[1:53:03] in the history of them so people are now
[1:53:06] frustrated they're angry they're mad
[1:53:09] people have lost their home they've lost
[1:53:10] their business y'all understand me
[1:53:12] they're looking for a change
[1:53:15] hallelujah y'all understand me and when
[1:53:19] all of this fall wars begin to
[1:53:22] and that's matthew 24. wars and rumors
[1:53:25] of wars nation against nations
[1:53:27] kingdom is king against kingdom we are
[1:53:29] now getting ready to pay for
[1:53:31] rejecting the gospel hallelujah
[1:53:34] is that right this country has been
[1:53:37] judged since 1962
[1:53:40] hallelujah when alaska almost sunk
[1:53:42] brother
[1:53:43] said judgment has struck the west coast
[1:53:47] hallelujah since 1962
[1:53:50] judgment struck the west coast and she's
[1:53:53] been under judgment
[1:53:54] ever since now don't get me wrong
[1:53:55] because y'all think just america
[1:53:58] the whole world is under judgment
[1:54:03] y'all hear what i'm saying i'm drawing
[1:54:06] this scenario
[1:54:07] so you can see that that's how close it
[1:54:11] is to the rapture
[1:54:12] because the prophet god said before one
[1:54:14] bomb drop
[1:54:18] maybe you don't get excited about things
[1:54:20] like that
[1:54:24] [Laughter]
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:32] the bride will be gone
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:43] and the u.n will get involved when
[1:54:46] america loses control
[1:54:50] the u.n army which consists of russia
[1:54:54] which consists of russia which consists
[1:54:58] of
[1:54:58] china and you know china don't like us
[1:55:01] right now
[1:55:02] and all of those uan nations whatever
[1:55:04] and whoever it takes
[1:55:06] to bring us under control they're going
[1:55:08] to sin
[1:55:10] hallelujah why why why why
[1:55:15] because mama wants this country
[1:55:29] and guess what folks
[1:55:41] they're worse than the fbi the cia
[1:55:44] whatever you name it
[1:55:45] they're murderers they'll do anything
[1:55:49] to bring a person or a country under the
[1:55:52] rulership of the catholic church
[1:55:56] that's why he's doing what he's doing
[1:56:03] he's one of the main advocates of this
[1:56:05] whole virus
[1:56:08] you can believe it's just conspiracy if
[1:56:10] you want to there's a corner of yours
[1:56:12] but if you believe the coronavirus just
[1:56:14] evolved
[1:56:15] then you believe in evolution
[1:56:21] hallelujah you believe that a turkish
[1:56:24] can mate with a
[1:56:25] mate with a chicken and have a chicken
[1:56:26] turkey
[1:56:36] you'll never see that happen it has to
[1:56:39] be manipulated
[1:56:42] and this coronavirus is manipulated it
[1:56:45] is something
[1:56:46] man put together whether it was
[1:56:48] intentional or not only god knows
[1:56:49] but it's still the judgment of the lord
[1:56:52] science got us into this mess
[1:56:54] y'all hear what i'm saying i'm trying to
[1:56:56] close now so i can tell you
[1:56:58] we are at the end
[1:57:01] and you've got to come to believe who
[1:57:03] you are
[1:57:05] you don't know who you are you don't
[1:57:06] know where you are you'll never know
[1:57:08] where you're going
[1:57:10] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:57:13] christ
[1:57:14] jesus hallelujah you can't
[1:57:17] tell me this world is not sodom and
[1:57:18] gomorrah the whole world is
[1:57:21] everywhere you go you don't you know
[1:57:24] come on
[1:57:25] you know it's the truth you're sick
[1:57:28] when i was growing up as a boy it was
[1:57:30] every now and again you see a sodomite
[1:57:33] now i know every y'all think all y'all
[1:57:35] think i'm talking about homosexuals
[1:57:36] no i'm talking about that and us and
[1:57:38] other things
[1:57:40] about this you say no i ain't never been
[1:57:42] perverted
[1:57:43] yeah you weren't good all of us were
[1:57:47] one way or another
[1:57:57] [Music]
[1:58:03] the devil from your birth made you think
[1:58:06] perverted
[1:58:08] holy is that the truth anything that's
[1:58:10] not word is perverted
[1:58:15] now you see everywhere i was in a
[1:58:18] i was in a uh uh a gas station
[1:58:22] with my wife and my grandbaby and here
[1:58:25] was this man had tattoos all over his
[1:58:27] face
[1:58:29] and cut his hair in such a way and had
[1:58:32] horns and everything sticking
[1:58:34] out and when i saw him i ran
[1:58:37] to catch my grandbaby because i didn't
[1:58:39] want her to see that
[1:58:42] it about scared me and i know what it
[1:58:45] would have done to her
[1:58:48] [Laughter]
[1:58:57] hello you ought to come to iowa
[1:59:00] des
[1:59:08] big man bigger than me high-heeled shoes
[1:59:11] and a dress
[1:59:17] no trans could do that we understand
[1:59:21] nothing no knife could have helped him
[1:59:24] yeah but he's proud oh come on people
[1:59:27] what i'm trying to tell you it's not
[1:59:29] going to get better it's getting worse
[1:59:33] and like i was telling the people out
[1:59:35] there when we were witnessing yesterday
[1:59:36] it don't matter what a person is all of
[1:59:39] us had problems when we came to god
[1:59:53] you lying
[1:59:58] well i ain't never did nothing the bible
[2:00:00] said if you look at a woman and left
[2:00:02] for her in your heart you've committed
[2:00:05] adultery
[2:00:07] don't tell me that
[2:00:14] sanctify me jesus see
[2:00:17] you know we i i'm hitting everything
[2:00:20] because i don't want people to think
[2:00:22] your righteousness of yourself you ain't
[2:00:25] got no righteousness
[2:00:28] you're righteousness of god
[2:00:33] you present what you do every day is
[2:00:35] still filthy right to god
[2:00:37] i'm almost done but thank god for his
[2:00:40] righteousness
[2:00:43] he gives us a message to clothe
[2:00:46] ourselves again
[2:00:48] a message that will keep keep our
[2:00:50] nakedness from being
[2:00:52] appearing hallelujah to keep us from
[2:00:55] feeling ashamed
[2:00:58] hallelujah is that right
[2:01:01] brother said he had to confess his sins
[2:01:03] every day
[2:01:06] and i want to find out if there's
[2:01:07] anybody in here who can't don't have to
[2:01:09] confess every day then
[2:01:10] something ain't quite right maybe you
[2:01:12] don't reach that perfection already
[2:01:18] in closing i keep saying that but i am
[2:01:20] closing with this knowing that the
[2:01:22] seventh seal
[2:01:23] so god unfolded those seven seers to us
[2:01:26] they said so
[2:01:27] but in the seven thunders there was a
[2:01:30] secret part there anything is given
[2:01:33] it's in there you like this and then
[2:01:37] because brother branham said in one of
[2:01:39] the quotes he said one day you'll find
[2:01:40] out where it's written
[2:01:45] and then brother tells you he says
[2:01:48] individual
[2:02:00] if you even tell them they ain't gonna
[2:02:02] understand what you're saying
[2:02:12] the thing what i'm trying to say is this
[2:02:15] if you if if your if your life is not an
[2:02:17] intimate relationship with god
[2:02:19] at this point in time you need to repent
[2:02:23] you need to ask god for his mercy and
[2:02:25] his grace
[2:02:26] because we don't have much time
[2:02:29] hallelujah
[2:02:30] remember joshua joshua was something
[2:02:33] else
[2:02:35] you know moses let the people complain
[2:02:38] and complain and complain
[2:02:41] but when joshua tries to take worldly
[2:02:44] things
[2:02:44] i see and bring them into the promise
[2:02:49] i mean did i say joshua i mean a can
[2:02:52] when he can
[2:02:53] took those wedges and and and garments
[2:02:56] and and
[2:02:57] guess what did god
[2:03:02] he killed the man y'all understand me
[2:03:05] and there is a spiritual death going
[2:03:07] around
[2:03:07] right now and people don't realize
[2:03:11] what's happening to them
[2:03:16] so that you'll know that what god did in
[2:03:19] 63 is
[2:03:20] you could have failed what we what we
[2:03:23] have feasted on
[2:03:24] you just looking at the message we
[2:03:26] praise god
[2:03:40] that's children's play
[2:03:44] hallelujah i was trying to show you now
[2:03:46] god in
[2:03:47] jesus christ interprets his own word
[2:03:49] however he interprets it
[2:03:50] we take it right but what he did in 1963
[2:03:55] got to be in the scripture
[2:03:57] hallelujah it doesn't erase the the
[2:04:01] literal corporate body
[2:04:08] and he brought a message to prepare you
[2:04:12] for a rapture hallelujah
[2:04:15] and i believe when the rapture takes
[2:04:17] place we'll look up
[2:04:19] and we will see him oh somebody help me
[2:04:23] here
[2:04:24] i don't think we're going to be flying
[2:04:25] into in the air
[2:04:27] looking at nothing
[2:04:34] however he interprets it it's his own
[2:04:36] business
[2:04:37] you just be part of it that's the most
[2:04:41] important thing
[2:04:43] like once he's coming on a white horse
[2:04:49] who cares how he's coming as long as he
[2:04:52] comes
[2:04:55] to argue about nothing to fuss about
[2:04:59] the point is you make yourself ready
[2:05:04] with anticipation like that little girl
[2:05:07] waiting on him already in the door
[2:05:13] so that you understand you're not going
[2:05:15] to say god
[2:05:17] i couldn't overcome this because i was
[2:05:20] born with it
[2:05:22] just like i said yesterday the man that
[2:05:25] was born blind for 30 years
[2:05:27] he could have had an excuse too
[2:05:31] but god healed him
[2:05:47] the mane the halt no matter what it is
[2:05:51] the power of god it lays within this
[2:05:53] message
[2:05:55] and it's for you and i that's that's the
[2:05:56] session but we got to have faith to
[2:05:58] believe it
[2:06:00] claim it speak it declare it
[2:06:04] it doesn't matter if you fail because
[2:06:06] the same god that lets you fall
[2:06:09] it's the same god will pick you up
[2:06:11] hallelujah
[2:06:12] but he wants you to venture out there he
[2:06:15] wants you to move forward
[2:06:18] is that right it's all i ain't closing
