[Music] uh January 21st 1955 but there's also another uh preaching of June 1955 also talking about the separation Waters 14 God sees true the blood please it doesn't see you like a sinner but when God sees you through the blood pressure he doesn't he doesn't see you like he sees you as a redeemed amen amen so you are ready because he always sees you through Christ say foreign [Music] Paul is trying to explain the Lord that has got a shadow of things to come and not like the sector representation and not exact representation of things could never bring the assistant to Perfection because God regardless could see through the blood of animals he sees you through the blood of his son Perfection comes by Jesus Christ in your side I'm not perfect it is that's where the thing is if you are born in the body of Christ if you are born in the body of Christ God sees you in the same manner he says God sees you the same way he says Jesus Christ the difference is to be born in the flesh Supreme by one Spirit we've been we've been baptized to form one body [Music] in the body enough [Music] [Music] in the sight of God by the blood foreign any any Focus any disabilities Jesus never it is because he didn't have anything the sins today the blood of Jesus foreign let us read uh from Romans chapter 8. and listen to what Paul is saying because we got no blemish no wrinkle not in the sight of man may they found you but in the sight of god Apollo this is it the Paul is saying this Roman Roman chapter 8. he said there's no therefore there's no now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus for those who are in Jesus do you believe to the Bible apology is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death God shows them possibly Allah for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God did by sending his own son Jesus in our card of sin he condemned his own flesh dancing share some problems in that Russia or Iran foreign that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled it has to walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit say an effective for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who lives according to the spirit they think uh set their their mind upon the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to to be spiritually murdered is life and peace because the candle mind is is enemy against God for it is not subject to the law of God law indeed can be or second view so then those who are in the flesh cannot please to God but but you but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if indeed the spirit of God dwells in you now if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ he is not of him [Music] I'm busy talking to those who are in Christ Jesus see in Christ you become a new creation you're becoming a new president you're becoming a new brother sir you're becoming a new sister and in that time when God sees himself and for him is your sins are forgiven yeah she sees Jesus Christ that is to slot before they assembly [Music] they had to wash that red heifer on the air to burn that on the on the breasts which was the altar of sacrifice and we said that the breast means the Judgment that's why God recommend to Moses when the serpent were biting children of Israel for them and also for their hearings that's why they have to raise that breast serpent Between Heaven and Earth and the breath always means judgment sacrifice on the same the priest memories even the higher priest before getting to the services and watch the prince himself that's why separation was Jesus himself here tell no very Tumblr significant who was the true higher priest s he accepted to be washed by John the Baptist why did he accept to be white he said many people say so what's the true truth foreign [Music] from the paragraph 85. let me find it for you you're saying this is why do they have to be baptized or else to be washed many said yes Jesus was washed because he was our example yes that's true up until at a certain point at a certain level it's true but that's not all the truth the truth is was an entity the Young The Young or the the red effort was a tip was a type Aaron was a type two says all the sacrifice was until they were representing the anti-type was the Lord Jesus Christ the type is the Shadows and the shadow is the negative negative is not a positive when we see the negative opposite we've got a way to see them everything they were doing in all systems Jesus is an anti-type is the higher priest and before the higher priest be unwanted he has to be washed first the Jordan shall Faithfully but I'm saying I'm gonna read you a scriptures and the thing is so verse 19 that I've noticed chapter 29. hey shall welcome and said chapter 29 verse 4 you shall be through Bentley chapter 29 Exodus chapter 29. I'm gonna found it while he's reading Exodus Exodus chapter 29. you may also check in your books from verse 4. listen to what God said unto Moses 29 verse 4. yeah foreign and Aaron and his sons you shall bring them to the door of Tabernacles of meeting and you shall wash them with water then you shall take the the government put the tunic on Aaron and the robe of the airport the airport and the breast and the breastplate and decree and guide him with the intake uh intercately woven band of the airport foreign foreign before they can be there to be unwinded do you see that our own restaurant sacrification air on the high priest s they have preached before is unwanted he has to be washed with Waters challenges that's why when Jesus before being unwinning like our priest Elijah he was unwinded with water it's a love he was watched with Waters and it was not the unwinning oil that was power on him to be on Wednesday like it was a case he was unwanted by the Holy Spirit because John gave testimony seeing the spirit of God coming down [Music] and the voice was heard this is my beloved Son in whom I found pleasure to dwell when Jesus came to Georgia Jones look at him [Music] he is the Lamb of God that takes the sin away are the Jewish people all these people [Music] they were waiting to see a walking lamb [Music] s but they forgot [Music] when God is changing these concessions they were used to see a walking animal but this time when John look at Jesus he didn't see him with the nature spiritual but he sees him with a spiritual eyes he understood that it was the same lamb foreign Prophet John was the prophet you know the way always comes to a prophet is this why Jesus he went straight to John was the prophet and all of them found themselves the eyes of the prophets and the eyes of the word of God they met and looked at each other John look at Jesus and Jesus but Jesus said John Let's fulfilled you're the word of God yellow Prophet you're the prophet cause a prophet are in a certain age to wish we cannot take away or we cannot add anything a prophet we never discuss with the prophets a prophet is an absolute a prophet we're gonna fulfill that word of God right now I'm saying the prophet today the prophet said before being unwinded it is they have to fulfill all their rushes he has to be washed with Waters and that was a wonderful time a beautiful type that consonants as a priest before God we're going to be baptized first conference confessing ourselves and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is require every believer Circle every believer s to go through the washing process to confess his sins to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of his sins then you're gonna receive the gift of Holy Spirit no pressure first foreign [Music] to produce a testimony for God believe the gift of Holy Ghost and you can give up a testimony and Christ was a testimony reconciling the word he says from everybody was we were born for the woman you know why because he was the one who introduced The Word Flesh that's why it was broken and today we had also a greater than just First and William Brothers foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you are a foreign you'll see the word of God for this day is to be fulfilled by us and come because it's up to us it's about us it's good for us there's so many scripture that has to be fulfilled and it's up to us it's up to us to make that all the justices be fulfilled it is Johnny you know who I am I am the higher priest it's true and I need to be baptized and we have to fulfills I have to be baptized by you to fulfill the word of God foreign [Music] when the Dove and the lamb met together Jesus who was the high priest make himself made himself sacrifices because he was the sacrifice so as a sacrifice has to be washed but I'm saying in the message dedication yeah we have innocence July 8 1959 today at paragraph 22. on the computer is 22 but 47. not being in any uh in any burden everything the citizens it has to be burned and when the bend that is to put a promise what they said of the Cedarwood and the lizard and also the eyesore we have seen that last Sunday in foreign and the faith shouldn't be something complicated in the word of God we're gonna be lift out of God without doubting anything so you gotta believe to the word of God without asking ourselves questions hello Prophet today and the prophet says for God to come down today after believing in God I will be living in Jesus Christ foreign [Music] [Music] it because believing in God itself believing in Jesus Christ be living into Holy Spirit he doesn't make you different from Pentecostal people because they also believe in God people believe in Jesus Christ because the people believes in the Holy Spirit themselves people but today love shows the difficult things that a human can do is to believe in a mortal man that's what people were saying that you are a man why you make yourself that's why the Jewish will tell Jesus they were not believing them left Heaven yet he was in that moment Jesus Christ me and my father Jesus were telling them you pretend to be Abram children he saw my day and he rejoiced but look at this child you are not even 50 years before Abram was foreign [Music] foreign thing [Music] for a mortar man to be living just this Brother John Brother John should I believe in brother John I shouldn't believe me yes no more but you know you'll be living in God that's the thing says he rest with us that's why I can bring God in existence they have to take that eyes up mix it with the cedar wood and grams the cross to mix the Silverwood and the chroma syrup said or they see the wood is white and the white color is justice but right inside of Cedarwood there's a red red line and that's red line that's the Redemption that's varnigating the righteousness we don't have our own righteousness but it's Christ that makes us the the cross was a was a curse yes read the Bible guess whoever will be uh on the cross it was a case but when Christ came in the processary he took that curse for you and me becomes a blessing amen amen he became cursed for us so that we may become blessings he became sin and thank you so that we may become Russia and we are the Righteous of God okay [Music] you know the devil doesn't like this kind of things he always trying to disturb anism he may disturbed by the children or made by the Mike things that we're doing it's like a Doctor Who's Making surgeries and God is busy making surgeries distractors she may leave the knives in the in the in in some yeah and once the person go back with those knives in the body so the doctor was distracted was negligent and left something inside the man just take care of yourself and be attentive to that so you should avoid all or going around because this is the important moment I'm listening to the word of God that's the most important thing is mixed up with blood the chromosy the red is representing our Redemption the red is our Redemption the cross was a curse but it became our blessings when every time we sing in the blood of Jesus blood of Jesus we're not just singing it from our way we could understand the the meaning the meaning of the cross the meaning of the Bible we're reading things that we don't even see in Africa here when we talk about sunset Mountain you can drive and go to Sunset Mountain to have people from Africa drive to or fly to Sunset is not easy if we talk about the cabinets it's not easy for us he was going passing by a museum to the win of the museum took off his heart he put it in his hands after bowing down when it start going foreign you see the Red Dot on the Garment it took it's a touch on my bed and the university he said what do you feel on my back cars on your back says cause of slavery just because of this man everything because of this red dot I was freed from slavery and what can freed a black man from slavery how much more the blood of the Lord Jesus May free us from sin from sickness from slavery and from all those things [Music] the most powerful God the blood that freed us from everything in paragraph 50. the answer is then the eyes up was added to the promise look what they said to the Cedarwood the eyes they were taking from the blood of the Lamb the eyes of place the blood that we're applying all the doors and the opposed in the Israel leads up the eyes of the plantages that was making so simple this uh this uh Gospel of aspiration Waters in fact it's the word of a living God show something that we're talking about the word of God had to burn all of this together what they said all of them were burned together [Music] no no by the word of God is to be kept in the pure vessels [Music] the word of God is to be kept in a pure heart the word of God is to be kept in a pure Church es of the of this world you are the ambassadors of Christ where you have to be among your friends you gotta keep this word pure lesson what what this separation Waters we're doing ready when they unbelievable the one was born in Israel and who went astray who played [Music] the first thing that was happening outside in the outside where they were saving food where the word of God was preached there were three the first part was the outside Court the second part was the Holy place and the third part was the holy of holies three three parts we've got a flesh before the spirit and we've got a soul so brother I'm saying is like all the houses every every house has got three offices there's a kitchen where we're eating there's a living room where we finish and the bedroom where we rested no matter how many rooms you may have the house is the three main rooms from the outside Court foreign he has to know how to repent himself he has to know how to come in Christ he has to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus in order to enter [Music] when the unbeliever the one was born in Israel and went astray or maybe a stranger that comes to church the first thing he has to do outside the outside it was a man with the people there should be out there a man with a pure heart with a pure hands that could um maneuver the chromosome the ashes and sprinkle upon that unbelief with separation Waters because the word of God cannot be worked out with the man with unclean hands somebody who has got a confused testimony it has to be a man with pure hearts men with Clean Hands foreign with the dirty things of the world not unclean in the useless things not unclean you know many things you start the farm not unclean with women he has to have a pure heart he knows innocent without a DOT says his head shouldn't even shouldn't even unclean set the predication this preaching

says By the Waters of the word of God the separation Waters from the word of God what are we doing we are getting into that house [Music] before somebody enter into that house far away from God who wants to who was once backslotted okay he has to come back he has to come first to be sprinkled with dispersion Waters so who's gonna sprinkle upon that person because the one who's preaching is not even worthy he who's gonna sprinkle upon him they want us to understand the waters to help the person foreign just to help him to come back into Fellowship if somebody was born outside he has to be sprinkle with inspiration from the word things so that is love support his desires be upon the word of God than any other things yeah the word of God has to have a first place in your heart please
