[2:11] [Music]
[2:16] Amen.
[2:19] Father John,
[2:37] we greeting you in the name of the Lord
[2:39] Jesus.
[2:41] May the Lord bless all of us tonight.
[2:47] We are so grateful to the Lord who kept
[2:49] us alive till today.
[3:06] Matthew 22
[3:10] 36- 40
[3:15] because we're going to continue with the
[3:18] last subject we had the law of which is
[3:21] the great commandment of the law.
[3:28] Jesus said unto him,
[3:39] "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[3:42] all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
[3:45] and with all thy mind."
[3:49] The love of God
[3:51] is the first commandment.
[3:56] And the Lord is giving her the second
[3:57] commandment.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; The second is like unto he unto it. Thou
[4:08] shall love thy neighbor
[4:11] as thyself.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Now listen.
[4:20] Verse
[4:26] 40. On these two,
[4:32] we so grateful unto you for this
[4:33] wonderful moment you gave us in your
[4:35] house.
[4:38] We came in this place. We know that you
[4:39] are the great dynamic,
[4:42] the great dynamic,
[4:45] the great power station.
[4:48] [Music]
[4:50] May you accept for us to be connected to
[4:52] you
[4:54] so that we may have fire from you.
[4:57] Divine fire that destroy all sins and
[5:00] darkness.
[5:02] May you be with us Lord.
[5:05] Why we talking about love in this place
[5:10] may not go back as
[5:15] in your word nobody can come in.
[5:19] go back the same way you came
[5:23] because you believe in the cross there's
[5:25] a transforming power
[5:28] in the cross there's everything that we
[5:30] need all kind of blessing you say
[5:32] without you we can't do anything
[5:35] we want to do everything with you Lord
[5:38] we want to love you like your children
[5:40] we want to save you
[5:43] the Lord Jesus on our way back home
[5:47] we We may say that God has changed us.
[5:50] We may we may say like those who were on
[5:52] the road of Moses that our heart were
[5:55] burning while he was talking to us.
[5:58] You never change. You're still the same.
[6:00] You were on the way.
[6:04] You can still be with us in this. It's
[6:06] possible.
[6:08] Two or three are my
[6:11] Amen.
[6:13] May the Lord bless us once more
[6:17] &gt;&gt; and we greeting you in the name of the
[6:18] Lord Jesus.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; I don't see brother Stefan.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; But you know a a subject like love
[6:43] We can't close it. We can't finish it
[6:48] because love is God himself.
[6:52] We can't talk about God and finish
[6:57] wrote about love
[6:59] and I believe we singing that in the in
[7:01] the in the song
[7:03] that love is so great
[7:07] and there's no way you can go around it.
[7:10] Love is so high. So if everybody was a
[7:14] writer
[7:16] and would like to write about love,
[7:20] oceans going to run dry.
[7:23] So there's no way we can explain about
[7:25] love.
[7:27] So we will just say something each one
[7:29] of us
[7:31] and we trust the Lord
[7:35] &gt;&gt; because it's the Lord who's going to
[7:36] make us.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; He knows how to teach each one of us.
[7:42] That's how I believe it
[7:46] &gt;&gt; and I also believe that's the way you
[7:47] you taking it. So we to and he said
[7:51] everything that prophet have said
[7:55] everything that you believe everything
[7:57] that Moses Jeremiah and all these
[7:59] prophets up to John the Baptist
[8:04] everything that they've done
[8:07] the Lord has put them together
[8:11] compacted them together
[8:14] he has put them together and said
[8:17] &gt;&gt; what came out of them is love. That's
[8:20] why we coming to church.
[8:24] We coming to church to seek for love
[8:32] and prophecies will cease.
[8:35] There'll be one day that the prophecies
[8:36] will cease to be
[8:40] where they speaking in tongues.
[8:43] One day those speaking in tongues will
[8:46] close be done. One day,
[8:50] [Music]
[8:52] one day
[8:54] &gt;&gt; marriage, there won't be marriage
[8:56] anymore.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; The love of God is eternal.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Only the love of God is eternal.
[9:08] Amen.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:12] That's why Christians,
[9:15] that's why sons of God,
[9:18] you as a son, you should be love. You
[9:20] should have that that love.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; You are a man
[9:26] because you are the son of a man.
[9:33] Animal.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; It's a little one of another animal.
[9:41] So if you are the son of God
[9:45] and your father is less than God,
[9:50] hatred has been found in a in a heart of
[9:52] God
[9:56] and the revelation today about that
[10:01] telling us that is not from God
[10:05] because in Adam there wasn't hatred.
[10:10] The entire life of Adam, he was full of
[10:12] hatred.
[10:14] And at the end, we can see what what he
[10:17] have done. It was death. He killed.
[10:22] He was a mror.
[10:24] He killed somebody because he wasn't he
[10:26] wasn't the son of God. So every son of
[10:29] God should have love.
[10:33] So according to what the master said
[10:37] first the love for God a love for your
[10:40] neighbor
[10:42] that's the victory from God.
[10:49] So how are we going to serve God?
[10:54] Servant of God they will serve God by by
[10:58] love.
[11:01] That's the only way we can save God. And
[11:04] God,
[11:08] &gt;&gt; he will accept only the works that
[11:10] you've done by love.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:15] So you should serve God by love. The
[11:18] love of God first. God first.
[11:24] Last time we read about it somewhere in
[11:28] the message
[11:30] &gt;&gt; where the prophet was saying that God
[11:32] first
[11:36] &gt;&gt; just notice King Solomon.
[11:43] I don't know if I've got a right way to
[11:45] say it.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's going to be the
[11:50] right word for him. He wasn't
[11:52] intelligent from the start,
[11:57] but he had the grace of God to be in the
[12:00] presence of God face to face
[12:03] as you as well today
[12:05] right where you are.
[12:09] You should believe that you are in the
[12:10] presence of God if you don't believe it.
[12:14] And nobody going to believe on your
[12:16] behalf
[12:18] if you don't believe.
[12:21] You're not going to see the glory of God
[12:25] to see God's glory.
[12:28] You should believe first.
[12:31] What do you mean? You believe in the
[12:32] word of God. And what the word of God
[12:37] where two or three are guided my name,
[12:39] I'll be in their midst.
[12:42] If we are guarded in the name of the
[12:44] Lord Jesus that we should believe
[12:47] that Jesus is right here.
[12:52] We should believe it. We are obligated
[12:54] to believe that to believe that God is
[12:57] now me.
[12:58] So how are you going to believe?
[13:02] There's no way you can believe in God if
[13:06] you don't love God.
[13:10] [Music]
[13:11] So if you love God first
[13:14] then you can believe in him.
[13:17] That's why the Bible says
[13:20] everything that a prophet have done
[13:23] all their preachings
[13:27] in short.
[13:29] It means the love of God
[13:32] then the love for your neighbor.
[13:38] King Solomon found himself in the
[13:40] presence of God.
[13:42] So now listen what God required him
[13:46] now that you are in my presence.
[13:49] What do you want me to do for you?
[13:52] That's a good question.
[13:55] If it was asked from to me, I would say
[13:58] God listen.
[14:01] Give my give me my wife and my children
[14:04] next to me.
[14:07] God give me money,
[14:09] give me purpose.
[14:12] That's what I will ask. I will ask to
[14:14] from God.
[14:15] But Solomon,
[14:18] he knew that he was idiot first.
[14:22] I love this
[14:24] an idiot
[14:27] whose caution that is idiot. He's not
[14:31] idiot cuz he knows that he's lack of
[14:33] something
[14:35] then he can go forward and look for what
[14:37] he's missing.
[14:39] But the dangerous one is the idiot who
[14:42] doesn't know that he's idiot who think
[14:45] is intelligent that one is so int
[14:47] dangerous
[14:49] but an idiot who knows his condition may
[14:52] God bless that son of that's what the
[14:55] king was. So he said
[15:00] He found himself in front of God.
[15:04] Jehovah Jar himself
[15:06] &gt;&gt; who had eternal life,
[15:08] &gt;&gt; who had gold and silver,
[15:11] &gt;&gt; who had everything that he wanted to
[15:13] have
[15:14] and those things were there with him.
[15:19] God could give him everything that he
[15:20] wanted.
[15:22] But now listen what Solomon asked from
[15:24] God.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[15:29] Give me wisdom.
[15:32] Why wisdom?
[15:37] &gt;&gt; So that I can judge your people.
[15:42] So what was his benefit?
[15:46] He didn't ask wisdom for himself,
[15:49] but he asked wisdom, blessings of the
[15:52] people of God.
[15:54] He said if you give me wisdom
[15:57] if you give you give me wisdom I will
[16:01] use the wisdom to the service of people
[16:03] your people.
[16:06] So God found his portion in that in the
[16:09] prayer of Solomon.
[16:10] Amen. Amen.
[16:14] So Solomon want to be a good leader.
[16:20] He wanted to do the right judgment for
[16:22] the people of God. So God found his
[16:25] portion in that.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; That's why God never we we we uh we
[16:32] withhold that for him.
[16:36] He gave unto Solomon what he asked for.
[16:41] He also gave him even what he didn't ask
[16:43] for.
[16:45] fulfill his word. He said,
[16:48] "Seek first the kingdom of God and it
[16:51] its righteousness
[16:53] and the rest.
[16:55] You're not going to look for it."
[16:57] God was going to give it for you. That's
[17:00] what he did.
[17:01] [Music]
[17:03] First ask for the kingdom of God. But
[17:06] the advantage of the benefit of God and
[17:09] or
[17:11] when God have seen his portion in his
[17:13] prayer
[17:15] He found the sincerity in the heart of
[17:16] Solomon.
[17:18] Then he gave Solomon what he asked for,
[17:22] wisdom and intelligence,
[17:24] he also gave him, gold and silver.
[17:29] And the Bible says
[17:32] so since the word is the world,
[17:36] nobody has been blessed like Solomon.
[17:40] But if you read in the prayer,
[17:45] never said God
[17:48] give me money. He never asked for money
[17:50] but he asked for wisdom
[17:53] &gt;&gt; not for himself
[17:56] but he asked the wisdom for the people
[17:58] of God.
[17:59] My beloved one I want to tell you
[18:01] something.
[18:04] So God the creator
[18:08] is more interested
[18:13] to our soul salvations than any other
[18:15] thing.
[18:18] Soul salvation is the first thing that
[18:20] God hold to
[18:24] God want is soul salvation.
[18:28] When we pray,
[18:30] you ask something from God.
[18:34] You should know why you asking that
[18:36] thing from God.
[18:41] Does God have a portion in what you
[18:43] asking
[18:46] or give me a good health?
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Why are you asking that?
[18:53] &gt;&gt; No, I just want to be in good health to
[18:56] go to work.
[18:59] No, that's not asking from God.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; We don't ask God in that way.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; You ask the good help.
[19:08] to serve God.
[19:11] If I'm in good health, Lord,
[19:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to save you.
[19:18] If you give me good health,
[19:21] see what I'm going to do with her. I'm
[19:23] going to go visit you.
[19:26] I'll go pray for your children. I'm not
[19:28] going to be absent from
[19:30] I'm not be absent from.
[19:34] And I will save you with a good head
[19:36] that you give to me.
[19:40] That's how we pray.
[19:42] And one day
[19:45] there was a a feast, a party.
[19:48] Why was that party?
[19:51] Because a son of a king wanted to get
[19:53] married.
[19:55] So that son came in a city. It was a a
[19:59] land of his father.
[20:02] So they they bring together all the the
[20:04] girls and women around the world.
[20:07] those girls came out
[20:10] because the son of a king wanted to get
[20:12] married.
[20:15] So there were people who were getting
[20:17] those girls ready.
[20:20] So they came so in numbers.
[20:22] So they came up,
[20:26] those who were getting those girls
[20:28] ready. They said,
[20:31] "So today the son of a king is going to
[20:33] get married.
[20:35] So what do you want us to give you?
[20:40] Because maybe it may it may probably
[20:42] it's going to be you if the son of a
[20:45] king take you as a wife.
[20:48] So you the one who's going to be
[20:50] so there's more benefit
[20:54] if the if the king is the priest who's
[20:57] going to be a new king.
[20:59] So if you want something like for your
[21:02] preparation
[21:04] or give me the red stick,
[21:07] give me the short short skirt,
[21:11] give me this and that.
[21:14] So they gave all those things to them.
[21:17] Everything that those girls asked for,
[21:21] they were just useless thing they were
[21:23] asking for.
[21:25] But there was one girl
[21:27] who was different from all others.
[21:31] She was working.
[21:34] They ask her a question. So you as well.
[21:40] You can be a queen. You can be they can
[21:42] you can get married to a son of a king.
[21:45] What do you want for your preparation?
[21:48] Now listen to the answer. She said this.
[21:53] I want the king the son of king himself.
[21:57] If the son of a king is my husband then
[22:00] all the things the rest of the things
[22:02] will be mine.
[22:05] Seek first for the kingdom of God and
[22:07] his righteousness.
[22:09] All other things will be given unto you
[22:10] as a benefit.
[22:12] That's how
[22:15] that's how we've been taught.
[22:18] Ask first
[22:23] the goodness of God.
[22:26] Ask first
[22:32] as for the kingdom of God and its
[22:34] righteousness.
[22:36] Then God will give unto you the rest of
[22:38] the things.
[22:41] So that girl she was working. She never
[22:43] asked anything. She said, "I only want
[22:45] the son of the king himself.
[22:48] because all other things will be given
[22:49] unto me.
[22:51] So when all the girls just passed by
[22:55] and the son of king was discouraged, he
[22:58] said,
[23:02] unfortunately if it's only those ones
[23:05] that are the girls that I have to get
[23:06] married to.
[23:09] So while he was working in the rain,
[23:13] he noticed another girl was working.
[23:16] So those who were in the party inside
[23:20] so they've used they've used the dishes
[23:22] and and cups and stuff
[23:25] and is that girl who was washing them.
[23:28] She was washing those dishes and cups
[23:30] and stuff glasses and she was she was
[23:33] well dressed up.
[23:36] So the the son of the king came up to
[23:38] her.
[23:40] Why didn't go inside together with other
[23:41] girls?
[23:43] I'm not going to be in there.
[23:46] I'm working right now.
[23:50] That's how we have to do things.
[23:53] Keep on working for the Lord
[23:56] in the good time and in the bad time
[24:00] in hard time and
[24:03] just working for the Lord.
[24:07] So she was a real worker
[24:11] that the son of the king was interested
[24:15] not to a lazy one
[24:17] somebody who's just sleeping
[24:21] just a little.
[24:24] You start sleeping only the time of the
[24:25] service.
[24:27] When it's the service time is the time
[24:29] for you to sleep. When you're at home
[24:31] you're not sleeping. You start sleeping
[24:33] only in the church.
[24:36] the same person
[24:39] only when it's the time for the service
[24:41] that the time to sleep
[24:44] but when it's time to sleep home.
[24:48] No bed dreams.
[24:51] So how come that you got bedrooms only
[24:53] the time of the service time to come to
[24:56] church?
[24:58] There's no
[24:59] nightmare.
[25:02] There are even those who are coming to
[25:04] sleep in the church.
[25:06] Regardless of the noise that we make,
[25:08] &gt;&gt; there's no nightmare here.
[25:11] So you got to check those nightmares
[25:14] comes from the enemy.
[25:17] The enemy doesn't want to be
[25:18] concentrated to receive your blessing.
[25:22] You are to fight for your blessings.
[25:26] No one else will fight on your behalf.
[25:30] When we talking about spiritual fight,
[25:32] you think it's a job.
[25:34] It's not a joke. The spiritual fight,
[25:38] spiritual battle exist, it exist.
[25:42] And the first battle of the devil
[25:45] is to bring you far away from the word
[25:47] of God. That's the first fight
[25:50] to bring you to believe that you can
[25:52] sleep when when they preaching. It's
[25:55] brother John. Who's brother John? He
[25:56] doesn't even know how to preach.
[26:00] Who is he?
[26:04] I can
[26:06] I can have a nap
[26:09] while we preaching and you are you are
[26:11] dreaming. How come?
[26:14] May God bless you.
[26:18] So we are to be workers, real workers.
[26:24] So to work is to work hard
[26:28] to endure the pain,
[26:30] &gt;&gt; difficult times, that's working.
[26:35] When it's cold, you still come to
[26:36] church.
[26:38] And the Lord is a just judge. He knows
[26:42] your heart. He knows your motives. He
[26:45] knows your objectives.
[26:48] He knows how to reward you.
[26:57] Whoever will save God should save him by
[26:59] love first.
[27:01] God bless
[27:03] and God gives money to you.
[27:06] But seek first for the kingdom of God
[27:09] and its righteousness
[27:14] and all the rest. You're not going to
[27:16] look for them. It's God who's going to
[27:19] give it to you freely.
[27:21] He's going to give it to you. He doesn't
[27:23] lie. God is going to give it to you
[27:25] freely.
[27:29] When you came in this place,
[27:32] you could be somewhere else.
[27:38] I know because I used to do delivery. I
[27:40] know time is money. Maybe in one hour,
[27:43] two hours I could get some money. Maybe
[27:46] $30, $20.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; But if you say
[27:51] I will stop this and go to church. I
[27:54] have to go save my Lord.
[27:56] And then the heaven sees you.
[28:00] There's an eye observing you somewhere
[28:03] and there's a blessing waiting for you.
[28:06] So God is going to give you those
[28:08] blessings.
[28:10] It's not me who saying. I'm just
[28:13] repeating what God have already said. He
[28:15] said he's going to bless you.
[28:18] And you ought to work by love
[28:22] for the Lord.
[28:25] You ought to work for by love.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; So once you work by love,
[28:33] there's a reward for you.
[28:35] Everything that we do in this world
[28:39] is the seed. We sowing seed
[28:43] &gt;&gt; one day.
[28:45] It's going to bring up.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; If you sow good seed,
[28:54] &gt;&gt; you will harvest good things
[28:58] and you will harvest them in abundance.
[29:02] Cuz when you throw your bread upon
[29:04] waters,
[29:05] your bread that you throw on the waters
[29:08] will come back to you.
[29:10] By the time the bread come back to you,
[29:13] it will come in numbers bigger.
[29:19] The the bread is observe absorbed
[29:22] waters.
[29:24] Maybe you throw it, maybe you throw a
[29:27] little bread, a a little piece of bread,
[29:31] but when you put more water in it, when
[29:34] it absorbed waters,
[29:37] that bread becomes bigger. You can eat
[29:40] it and get full of it.
[29:43] You can even throw it again on the
[29:45] waters and it will come back to you. May
[29:49] God bless you.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; The word of God is so wonderful.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; We we love our Lord.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:01] Whoever doesn't have love
[30:06] &gt;&gt; doesn't come from God.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; If you don't have love, which means you
[30:13] don't come from God
[30:17] and everything that comes from God.
[30:21] All those who comes from God have got a
[30:23] sign.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; And the sign for these people
[30:26] &gt;&gt; is love.
[30:31] They don't force themselves to love.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; They automatically love.
[30:38] They love their God
[30:41] and they also love their neighbors
[30:47] to all the questions of the entire
[30:50] universe that you know. God have given
[30:52] the answer
[30:54] and the answer that God have given is
[30:57] love.
[31:00] We are in tr. Why are we in trouble?
[31:03] It's because we don't want to respect
[31:05] the law of God.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we are in trouble.
[31:12] The murdering that we have,
[31:15] wars that we have,
[31:17] the forces that we have
[31:22] because we've broken the law of God
[31:24] somewhere.
[31:27] Instead of having love for God,
[31:30] instead of having love for your
[31:31] neighbor,
[31:33] we've got hatred for God.
[31:36] Curiously, in our generation
[31:39] there, there's many artherist.
[31:42] In this generation, we have many
[31:44] atheist. There are those who don't
[31:46] believe in God. They've got their
[31:48] philosophy. If God exists, which means
[31:51] man doesn't exist. So, if man exists,
[31:54] which means God doesn't exist.
[31:57] That's being idiot things.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; I'm insuring
[32:03] God exist.
[32:08] Never believe in those earthies.
[32:11] They are descenders from devil.
[32:15] They can only deceive the sons of the
[32:17] devil.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; There were war in heaven. Lucifer.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Lucifer.
[32:23] He fought against Michael.
[32:26] Michael was the greatest one and strong
[32:28] one. Even though there were so many,
[32:32] Michael cast them down all of them.
[32:35] Even if we are not so many, we are the
[32:37] victorious.
[32:41] Even if we are only two or three people,
[32:44] we are the victorious.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Victory is now a camp
[32:49] and the Lord is with us and you should
[32:53] believe it in the name of the Lord
[32:54] Jesus. for you to move forward.
[32:58] You should believe that you're not alone
[33:00] and God is with you
[33:04] to believe in that way. You should love
[33:06] God first.
[33:09] Love God first.
[33:11] Once you love God, then you can believe
[33:14] in what he's saying.
[33:16] Otherwise, you know, if you don't love
[33:19] him, you will never believe in him.
[33:24] But us in our meeting,
[33:26] we are the believers. We are believers.
[33:30] We've got love for our God
[33:34] and also love for our neighbors.
[33:40] It's impossible.
[33:44] Will you not love your neighbor?
[33:47] your brother
[33:50] and believe of the same message.
[33:53] The message that you believe,
[33:58] &gt;&gt; the brother and sister
[34:01] who are going to be raptured together,
[34:05] brother and sister
[34:08] who are going to heaven together,
[34:12] just imagine you get there and you don't
[34:15] talk to each other.
[34:17] Is that normal?
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know how we love each other in
[34:25] the family?
[34:28] When you come in the family
[34:31] like I'm not the firstborn of the
[34:32] family.
[34:34] When you come
[34:36] in the world, you just come.
[34:39] You see someone else
[34:42] who's like you.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; He calls
[34:47] Your father, he also call him his
[34:49] father.
[34:51] Where you go sleep, you see him going to
[34:53] sleep in the same place.
[34:55] When your dad make his project, he does
[34:59] it for you and for him on the on his
[35:02] identity.
[35:05] You've got same
[35:08] you've got same
[35:11] then you understand.
[35:14] Oh, so this person is from my family. I
[35:17] don't understand.
[35:19] So my father is his father too.
[35:22] So I'm forced to love that person
[35:26] because that person
[35:28] is like me
[35:31] is almost like me.
[35:34] The blood that flows in me is the same
[35:37] blood in him.
[35:39] So then you understand that this person
[35:41] next to me, we've got the we've got the
[35:44] blood bound,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; but we we've got the same person.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; He calls Braham his prophet. You also
[35:57] call brother Brham your prophet.
[36:02] So if he's not against us, which means
[36:04] he's for us.
[36:06] If he's not against us, which means
[36:08] ours, we should just love him and accept
[36:12] him as he is.
[36:15] Because the brother, you don't choose
[36:16] him. Is God who gives you your brothers
[36:19] and sisters.
[36:21] You just come in the word and you find
[36:22] out your brothers are there, your
[36:23] sisters are there. You don't choose them
[36:27] and you are obligated to accept them as
[36:29] they are.
[36:31] If you can love your brother who believe
[36:35] the same message like you,
[36:39] how are you going to love the God that
[36:41] you don't see?
[36:45] How are you going to love your enemy?
[36:49] Someone who criticizes.
[36:51] The Bible is asking us to love them.
[36:55] You can't even love somebody who says
[36:57] amen at the same time with you. When
[36:59] they preaching the son of man is also
[37:02] standing and say amen to the world.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; That person is saying amen the same time
[37:06] with you but you failing to that amen.
[37:10] You're failing. You say oh look at this
[37:12] person
[37:15] since he bought a new car.
[37:18] So when God bless one of us,
[37:22] it means he has blessed the entire team
[37:25] of us.
[37:27] We should be happy of a blessing of your
[37:30] neighbor.
[37:32] You know many prayers that we we make.
[37:37] God can respond to those prayers by one
[37:39] person only. God can bless one person
[37:44] and from the person and that person just
[37:46] buy a land for us. Amen. Amen.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; As we were in a meeting last Sunday with
[37:53] musician
[37:55] or they were complaining,
[37:58] we we're missing this, we're missing
[37:59] this, we're missing that.
[38:03] God can just raise one person among us
[38:06] who can buy everything that we're
[38:07] missing.
[38:11] and those people that we're looking for.
[38:14] We saying that God has given us all the
[38:16] equipment. But God doesn't open heaven
[38:19] to come now. He's going to use human
[38:22] being.
[38:23] He can use you or use some among us.
[38:28] And I'm praying that let it be me.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; So you're going to say say the same
[38:35] thing.
[38:37] Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; So we going to read something in the
[38:48] message of the end end time
[38:52] before we close.
[38:55] There's war in this world.
[39:01] It's because we don't want to apply the
[39:03] law of God.
[39:05] There's divorces in this world
[39:09] &gt;&gt; because people don't want to apply the
[39:11] law of God.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to read what the prophet is
[39:19] saying.
[39:22] So the day the world is going to apply
[39:25] the law of God,
[39:28] all the wars going to stop.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you this,
[39:37] this war are not going to stop
[39:40] because the word is already written.
[39:44] We need a new world.
[39:49] Today's word is the word of peace. The
[39:52] word of peace is the word that is full
[39:55] of love.
[39:57] And that world,
[40:00] the only person who can give it to us is
[40:03] the king of Salem.
[40:06] It's him who can give us the word of
[40:09] peace.
[40:11] But in the meantime, as his children,
[40:14] we've got a right.
[40:17] We do have right to live in peace.
[40:22] The king of Salem, the king of peace is
[40:25] our father.
[40:30] beyond the curtain of time.
[40:34] [Music]
[40:40] Uh from paragraph 41
[40:45] just two places then we close. Okay.
[40:51] So, brother Bam is telling us a story
[40:55] of a vision that they have seen.
[41:00] The vision that he had when he went
[41:01] beyond in the sixth dimension,
[41:09] beyond the curtain of time of 1931,
[41:14] paragraph 41.
[41:18] Then the voice asked me,
[41:23] &gt;&gt; "Do you want to see beyond the c the
[41:26] curtain?"
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Then I say that will be benefit to me.
[41:32] So what happened?
[41:35] I I'm not going to be able to say what
[41:37] I've seen.
[41:40] I don't know whether I was in my body or
[41:43] out of my body.
[41:45] Or maybe I was just taken out of it. I
[41:48] don't know.
[41:54] But it wasn't like a vision.
[41:58] It wasn't like one of the vision that I
[42:00] had before. But I could see the place
[42:04] where I was taken out out to
[42:08] see myself laying down on a couch on my
[42:11] bed. Then I said,
[42:14] "Oh, it's strange."
[42:20] &gt;&gt; So, there was a number of people, great
[42:22] number of people.
[42:29] Yeah, I was. I'm among them.
[42:34] Yeah.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; So, who wasn't there?
[42:38] I want to see who was in that vision of
[42:40] William Brown. Who was in the vision?
[42:42] May God bless you.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; So we are all in that vision.
[42:47] All that you have loved and those who
[42:50] loved you
[42:52] all of them I gave it to unto you. Who
[42:55] doesn't love Braan
[42:57] who love who love Braan may God bless
[43:00] you. Now I believe that we were all in a
[43:03] vision. We have just forgotten.
[43:06] We were all in a vision. We have just
[43:08] forgotten. Why?
[43:11] Because we bypass our theophony
[43:14] that's why we forgot
[43:17] but in reality we were in that vision
[43:20] we were in the vision
[43:23] we are reading in our vision I was in
[43:26] that vision so if you were not there
[43:27] that's your problem but now listen what
[43:30] the vision is saying
[43:33] there was a great number of people
[43:36] and they were running toward me
[43:39] welcoming me saying, "Oh, our beloved
[43:42] brother,
[43:44] our precious brother."
[43:49] So, first it was the number of women who
[43:51] came to me. They were they were all
[43:54] young around 20 years old. They were
[43:57] hugging me and saying our precious
[43:59] brother. And the young young people,
[44:02] young brothers,
[44:04] they were all young
[44:07] and they their eyes were bright. They
[44:10] were they were shining like stars
[44:13] in the darkness of night
[44:16] and their teeth were were white like
[44:18] like
[44:20] jewelries.
[44:21] And they were hugging me and saying our
[44:23] precious brother.
[44:26] Then I also noticed that I became also
[44:29] younger.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; This is wonderful.
[44:34] I would like to be young again.
[44:37] You know when I was still young.
[44:41] I told the the youth is going to be
[44:43] eternal. The youth state is going to be
[44:46] eternal. So when I was looking to the
[44:49] elders,
[44:51] they're going to die soon, but I'm still
[44:52] young. But when I sleep and wake up, I
[44:56] see myself older.
[44:58] Those were calling me young brothers.
[45:01] Now they are dying. I don't see them
[45:03] anymore. But I see the little ones that
[45:06] getting great and greater and bigger,
[45:08] they are saying unto me that I'm old
[45:10] now.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; And the word is so complicated.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Now
[45:19] Now I notice that I became also younger.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; I look at myself
[45:25] &gt;&gt; and I turn around to see my old body
[45:29] laying on the on the bra on the bed and
[45:31] my hands fall on my back. Then I said I
[45:34] don't understand this
[45:38] and I try to understand what was it
[45:40] where was the place where I was finding
[45:42] myself.
[45:46] Then I start becoming conscious
[45:48] [Music]
[45:50] that in the place where I was
[45:53] there were no yesterday
[45:55] or even tomorrow
[45:58] it was eternity
[46:01] and nobody seemed to be getting tired
[46:08] while the multitude of people the young
[46:10] girls the most beautiful that I've never
[46:12] seen before they were jumping on me
[46:14] hugging me.
[46:16] And I also noticed there was only the
[46:18] great feelings of love.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Only a great feeling of love
[46:26] that was
[46:28] uh that was uh uh getting over me
[46:33] without any physical attraction
[46:36] as it could be in a human behavior.
[46:49] And I also noticed that those young
[46:51] girls had a long hair that reaches their
[46:53] wrist and they had a long skirt is long
[46:57] skirt that reached their wrinkles.
[47:02] Let me skip.
[47:23] I just want to skip.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; So to on paragraph 50
[47:31] then I ask where is Jesus?
[47:35] &gt;&gt; I would like to see him.
[47:39] And those people answered is a little
[47:42] bit higher
[47:44] and one day he will come to you
[47:47] because you've been sent as a chief and
[47:50] when God will come to you he will judge
[47:53] you according to what you've preached
[47:55] then I ask
[47:59] are Paul and others going to be judged
[48:01] as me the answer was yes
[48:05] then I say I preach like they they
[48:07] preached so I didn't get a straight
[48:10] neither both either side. He was
[48:13] baptizing in the name of Jesus. I did
[48:15] the same. They were teaching the baptism
[48:18] of Holy Ghost. I did the same. So
[48:21] everything they teached, I also teach
[48:24] them. We know it. And they said
[48:31] and those people say one day we'll go
[48:32] down
[48:34] and Jesus will come down and judge you
[48:36] according to the word that you've
[48:38] preached. And after
[48:42] you will present us to him
[48:49] and we will go back on earth to uh to
[48:52] live forever.
[48:56] 52.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; So while I was now leaving that
[49:01] beautiful place I was and joy
[49:05] and as I could see it far away
[49:09] and many people were coming toward me
[49:12] just to hug me and they were saying our
[49:15] precious brother
[49:18] and suddenly I found myself again on the
[49:20] bed. Then I say, "God,
[49:24] that's what I wanted to read.
[49:27] Help me
[49:31] that I should I shouldn't do compromises
[49:33] about your word.
[49:38] Let me stick sincerely to the word of
[49:40] God.
[49:43] No matter what uh what other people can
[49:46] do,
[49:49] let me keep running toward this
[49:51] beautiful place.
[50:00] I'm more convinced that I've never been.
[50:09] And we should have a perfect love to
[50:11] enter in that place.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; So there's a place
[50:18] a a a city of peace,
[50:21] a city of beauty of beauty. The place
[50:26] where Jesus went to prepare for us
[50:29] and in that vision
[50:33] is the history repeating itself.
[50:39] Children of Israel were were leaving
[50:41] Egypt. They were going to the promised
[50:43] land
[50:45] and they got somewhere.
[50:48] They had to send spies.
[50:51] Spies went
[50:55] those spy came with the with the same
[50:58] testimony.
[51:00] And I'm telling you the history is still
[51:01] the same.
[51:03] We have also left all the
[51:07] the land is real. We want to get in
[51:09] there. What God have done
[51:12] He took our leader. He said you
[51:16] come and spy the land
[51:19] come and see what is happening in the
[51:20] land. Then you go with a testimony.
[51:25] Why did he give us that testimony
[51:28] to encourage us
[51:30] so that our faith can increase and not
[51:32] fall? We can keep on believing that the
[51:36] land exist.
[51:39] People are taking the flight to go and
[51:40] seek for that land. They will never
[51:42] found that land.
[51:44] God have taken one of us who went and
[51:47] visit that land. He visit the land and
[51:50] say the land is real.
[51:54] And I'm repeating you tonight
[51:57] that the se of
[52:00] it's a real land. It exist.
[52:04] Brother Brandham visited the land.
[52:07] Brother Brandham spied the land and he
[52:10] came with a testimony. He said, "The
[52:12] land that you're talking about, it
[52:14] existed.
[52:17] There's food in abundance.
[52:19] There's blessings in that land.
[52:22] This youth that is eternal." And what is
[52:24] he saying at the end?
[52:26] Only love
[52:29] can get in there.
[52:34] If you've got no love, forget about that
[52:36] land.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Forget about it.
[52:40] If you've got love, may God bless you.
[52:44] You've got a ticket for your journey.
[52:47] So, we're reading the last quote.
[52:50] Only one paragraph,
[52:52] divine love
[52:57] of 1966, uh 1956.
[53:03] Paragraph 17 uh 173. Listen to what the
[53:07] prophet saying.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Why
[53:11] the love was projected
[53:16] and uh sovereign grace of God take over.
[53:20] It's so important. You have to
[53:22] understand this.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Now they're talking to me.
[53:33] God bless you.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; They also talking to who?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; My God bless you.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So my brother and my sister,
[53:45] &gt;&gt; so the there's one thing that you have
[53:47] to do in your life.
[53:50] There's one thing that you have to do in
[53:52] your life
[53:55] is to love the Lord God,
[53:57] &gt;&gt; your God,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; with all your heart.
[54:02] with all your soul
[54:05] &gt;&gt; and with all your strength
[54:09] &gt;&gt; and with all your mind
[54:13] and to believe that every word that is
[54:15] said is true.
[54:18] Amen. Amen.
[54:20] Who does believe? May God bless you
[54:30] and believe that every word that you say
[54:32] is true. Now listen
[54:37] and when you get to the end of your your
[54:39] road
[54:42] that you could not move forward anymore
[54:46] then the sovereign grace of God
[54:49] the divine grace of God will be
[54:51] projected onto you.
[54:54] When God is going to project
[54:57] divine grace is when you've got his love
[54:59] in you.
[55:01] Then you can receive the divine grace of
[55:03] God. May God bless us tonight. Let us
[55:06] stand and we're going to pray.
[55:09] We're going to ask for the love of God.
[55:11] A shot.
