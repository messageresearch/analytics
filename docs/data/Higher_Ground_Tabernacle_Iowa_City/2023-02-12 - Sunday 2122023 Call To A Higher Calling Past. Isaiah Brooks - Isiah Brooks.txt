to Joshua one two and three way Capital Premiere versus [Music] Philippians 3 14. he is a living God foreign [Music] are you there Philippians 3 14. I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Christ [Music] Joshua Olivia the first chapter premiere they said second verse and it reads Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel passage Israel every place [Music] every place [Music] and let us pray dear heavenly father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy who am I Lord that you would call us to be your servant I pray Lord God did you give me Grace to move completely out of your way speak to the hearts of your people speak in the life that's within them Lord that we all may see the great calling in which you have called us to La pal lot we humble ourselves before you we're nothing within ourselves but Lord Jesus You're Everything bless your service we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated or my subject this morning is called to a higher calling many of us perhaps are and have been like me when I first got saved I thought that the product was finished when I got filled or when God filled me with the Holy Ghost yeah I thought that I had reached that ultimate goal and then the message came to me and then the message came to me I didn't find it but it found me and in my studying the word of God I came to realize as the prophet of God said when you get the Holy Ghost you only just begun who come and says but you see there weren't anybody telling me these things there wasn't anybody you know really emphasizing what I should be doing and she's this your second chance I came to this message after many people yeah come to the message and when they come to the message they really believe that they have arrived but the message is isn't the message itself is instructions the message itself will take you on a journey the message itself but if we don't see what it really is more than quoting a prophet remember it's more than quoting the scriptures because there are many people theologians who can out quote all of us but we realize by the grace of God each and every one of us must truly be born again that is just the beginning of your journey [Music] [Applause] is that right amen so did Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had to find his identification in the word and even as Jesus Christ even as Jesus Christ each step it up the prophet made forward okay meet more death to self more deaths and more consecrations hallelujah amen it wasn't just oh I'm Malachi Falls but he had to pursue Hallelujah drive him forward Hallelujah I'm feeling pretty good this morning but in this message we have forgotten who we are we call our Hallelujah but you're not in this Jesus Christ until you become like he is the Bible never say it like this media called but you are chosen hallelujah amen you you got you got what I'm saying the reason I use because many were called by Moses were called by Moses Hallelujah I must know hallelujah amen and you've got to come to know this is the identification identification God gave to us this is the identification God gave to us okay do you have anywhere by way of Malachi hallelujah amen because media people basketball I've heard this message hallelujah amen [Music] have gotten rich off this message [Music] I became popular of this message did not come to make you rich message came to make you Jesus Christ [Music] that means you've got to die you get to God [Music] amen I'm gonna read a quote coming from once more info in foreign death [Music] hell and the grave the Bible said he had a new name and when Jacob overcomes see what he said if the church can overcome she will stop saying I'm Methodist Presbyterian message now I threw that one in when she can overcome her Creeds and the world that draws her in there she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ [Music] there's some things you must do yeah amen I'm talking about a higher calling Japanese because the Bible said gee uh Israel heard the word when Moses when Moses and they Rose this is a time of sincerity now you know I don't know what you're thinking about your vision let me let me say it like this your purpose for being born if you're a doctor if you're a lawyer she said if you're a policeman those things are of this world you won't need that in the world Hallelujah so you but your your main purpose for which you were born it should be a Christian Sons and Daughters of God feasted you it doesn't matter how rich you become a house hey man you have failed your purpose now I don't have to worry about certain things but when I think about I think about myself Carlos Japan as far as I'm concerned I'm still trying to figure out why he called me just say the company the one who was nothing Hallelujah in heaven that'll put me to shame it wasn't my singing it wasn't even birth [Music] hallelujah amen you had no event Advantage over the person next to you Hallelujah only reason why we're setting here in his own mind it's his calling not your calling the preacher though he didn't bring you here but one thing God is calling foreign my sister be more sincere produces all of that but only to the sincere message hallelujah amen I want to see a real Revival people throw I preach it it's your question but I want you to know it's not so easy you got to fight every day you gotta fight every day to achieve this goal and you can't allow to death the devil make you lose your focus keep your eyes on Jesus I'm back keep your eyes on him you're not reading every day read everything they pray every day hallelujah amen that's how you get closer to God and praying hallelujah hallelujah amen there's so many people in this message because us we haven't been consecrated hallelujah amen we've been living in in the muck of the mud movies then God calls us hallelujah you can't live an ungodly life I don't have to I don't have to get amen hallelujah is that right amen you can't go around lusting out the women and expect God to call you bride them down you gotta battle with those devils demo amen you know we can't live absolutely if you think that's what's going to happen Hallelujah come on somebody you've got to be justified you've got to be Sanctified you've got to be filled with the holy God and God will bring you to perfection yes sir it's amazing because James tells us that we can't control our tongue hello yes sir amen amen and that's the problem with a lot of people they may not be committing adultery yeah you know doing all those kind of things they can't keep their mouths glory to God Amen consecration is what God is asking for what is consecration it's sincerity it's the quality of being free [Music] from pretense deceit is hallelujah amen what a blessing when somebody say Okay of his belief is unquestionable you hear what I'm saying something's amazing and say hey he is glory to God I'm talking about a higher calling Japan you have been called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ yes sir and we if you got the spirit of Jezebel on you don't even if God is taking you in the right Hallelujah all right he's not coming for Jezebel yes Hallelujah he's calling for a pride without wrinkles without blemish no unclean thing will enter into the city I hope I'm hurting somebody's feelings look what the prophet of God says in the message once more he said and I want you to believe me as a servant I want you to say to God when he met me he said if you get the people to believe [Music] [Music] there's nothing wrong with the message yes there's nothing wrong with the message the people that follow the message [Applause] hallelujah amen now the only reason why I'm speeching this way there's a Clear Vision the vision the people perish and the prophet of God [Music] what God is expecting Jesus Christ he even gave us a preview and experience he himself had that Jesus Christ is God hallelujah and he's the same yesterday we did yesterday he's able to do it today let me say it like this sometimes we fail to see how great God is God can hold the moon in place [Applause] of you Hallelujah that the scripture says from falling Hallelujah amen hallelujah amen let me tell you something it's about issues I I talked about Jezebels and ahabs but let me put it this way I'm not preaching down to anybody this morning because all you need me it's the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you get the Holy Ghost make you walk right it'll make you talk Hallelujah [Music] because when you get the Holy Ghost in your soul Hallelujah it brings you to a change you don't have to change yourself it will change you Hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen the prophet of God says in the message Israel in the church he said the Bride of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ [Music] baptized in his Spirit but he said in his name is his righteousness hallelujah amen there she is I've noticed that if it was a gentile bride yes Hallelujah let me tell you something I have no righteousness of my own but I rode in his righteousness by his blood hallelujah amen hallelujah he is my Hiding Place Tabernacle that Higher Ground Tabernacles but he is my hiding Hallelujah foreign [Music] hey man hallelujah amen from that time 172. that's about the way that's about the way serving the lord you know say this is you got to put all you got to put your heart into it you got to meet God do not go to church until something happens we don't know but I know a prophet is so he wrote him a letter yes sir if that's all you can do when it comes to Jesus write him a letter and if you're sincere in yourself [Music] [Applause] [Music] the problem is the problem is we're not sincere enough Hallelujah foreign [Music] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen glory to God Watchmen what of the night Hallelujah glory to God is that all right here he prays he still pray Heavenly Father verse as the day is growing dim now the signs of his appearing is at hand let's sing a song we see the church that little handful is destinated before the beginning of the world names are put on the Lambs before there was a foundation the Holy Spirit has sought through the Nations amen I'm the only one in my natural family all of your brothers Hallelujah all right that's right sister God loves people that's messy shoes don't you think you use some curse thing Hallelujah I always watch you yeah because when you was in a ditch God saw you there ma'am I'll abuse you God saw you there it's on you God saw you there but you know what he saw he didn't see a failure he saw a conqueror Hallelujah Brothers amen don't you look at your life what you used to be yes I got saved this way that's what the devil always did he would always bring my paths amen but I want you to understand foreign [Music] [Music] you gotta let all that stuff goes Hallelujah God see you as being beautiful you don't need it all all the stuff the world gives you you don't need all that God hallelujah amen glory to God oh Heavenly Father he said what she's elected name put on a Lamb's Book of Life before there was a foundation of the world has sought through the Nations

her she's gotta move forward get closer to God be more consecrated be more sincere Hallelujah and she does not care she doesn't care what anybody else thinks about her in the verb of him hallelujah amen she ain't like some of these people she's not like some some people at this but in her heart where the caucus is some people say it's too cold outside not if there's a whale not if there's a way Hallelujah [Music] nothing yeah nothing yeah she's in Pursuit Hallelujah is that right so correct the songs of Solomon says where is my beloved hallelujah amen she was in Pursuit he was in Pursuit Hallelujah to catch someone glory to God is that the truth let me tell you something when you've got a real calling on your life you like that woman at Simon's house I know this house is full of Pharisees when they see me they ain't not gonna like me hey hello everybody I'm not going to church because sometimes people don't like me ma'am I don't care they can get sick to their stomach the word of God Hallelujah that's what she said no she had that attitude she crashed through that old religious crowd y'all know how it is you come to church and everybody's dead and you're the only one stimulated and if you don't care you don't be careful with that woman said I see him in the corner I told him I'll meet him here y'all hear what I'm saying she had no previous conversation with Jesus but she knew where Jesus was Hallelujah she knew how to find him Hallelujah she didn't stop for nothing she went straight to the floor that's what we need to do when you come the tracks you need to show God hallelujah I don't care if all the churches are sitting still remember Hallelujah [Music] but a few people in there Wednesdays don't you think that's gonna stop me no if it doesn't matter he's gonna hear my voice so correct amen Hallelujah yeah man let me tell you something this ain't no eat just this ain't like some Bishop calling you a some Presbyterian calling you a group of people

you love the Lord hallelujah I hope you're not tired cause I'm not tired either yeah Hebrews the third chapter one through six I'm enjoying this anointing Hallelujah I feel good in this place Hallelujah whenever he's dead I don't care where he's at when I feel his anointing cause yourself to myself it doesn't have to be [Music] all of a sudden you just feel that tingling Spirit you know what I mean Hallelujah like the pillar fire is just dancing them up your head [Music] It Feels Like Rain anybody know what I'm talking about I don't care when he comes yeah Hallelujah we are going to dance together hallelujah amen it is so funny it's so funny because when I was in the uh Baptist Church we weren't allowed to dance then when I went to the Methodist Church I was the only one out of order because nobody else wanted you to dinner and then when I went to the apostolic church that's Jesus Name Church the Holy Ghost Field church but then when I was there they told me I danced too much hallelujah amen and then I get to the message church and they say the days of of the Pentecostal day is over that spicy Hallelujah it may be over for them but it's not over for me y'all coming the real Holy Ghost I'm coming the real Pentecostals I'm tired of this system just trying to shut me down you're right Hallelujah you gotta press your children needs this understanding if you're not enjoying Jesus how do you expect them to enjoy [Applause] amen hallelujah yeah man you come to church and you fired up about God they don't need a PlayStation when you got Jesus that's enough Hallelujah but what happened we we've done just like Mary and Joseph did we care though we went on thinking Jesus was still there Hallelujah Gideon God be with us hallelujah amen brother random status he said Mary and Joseph go back they left him they left him at Pentecost foreign somebody help me yeah you can you can say whatever you want to say but if it doesn't apply to me I let it go ahead on Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying amen glory to God Roger let me read this scripture wherefore beginning at the first verse because I want you to understand is from above he wasn't here on Earth see even when Jesus said Peter come yeah when he called his disciples he was just doing something that had already been done he was manifesting what the father had done before the foundation of the world y'all hear what I'm saying so you got to understand when you when God called you to this message hallelujah amen you came come on somebody there's only one father there's only one father and that's Jesus Christ somebody help me here amen oh Lord hallelujah amen I remember when I left that old Apostolic church and I was they didn't want me to leave because I was when I would preach the church would fill up and you know bringing in a lot of money when I was in the apostolics I preached like the apostolics oh so I knew how to put it on yeah sometimes I have to be careful because I can feel that thing move yeah but let me say it like this piece they didn't want to lose me right yeah but when I left when I left one of those old Godly sisters saw me in the department store he wasn't being nice she was hitting me like she was upset with me where you got the Holy Ghost where you were born I'm like what about this message you know that's a lie Hallelujah no sir I wasn't born in the organization in my heart Hallelujah in a dimension that's eternal nobody can claim me nobody but Jesus himself I belongs to God and God belongs to me yeah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah hey we can produce the atmosphere yeah hallelujah amen ain't no Eagle no Eagle coming out of a chicken egg best it is [Music] to read the scripture I'm trying to get there for a holy brethren and partake us of the Heavenly calling nobody called Paul always called Simple my God himself and that's the way God calls all of his people hallelujah amen he called he chooses he elects Hallelujah I'm dumb enough to believe I'm bride yes we are saying corrected you say dumb sheeps are done okay put it together so let's go to the second verse who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house second verse over the third chapter okay okay foreign for this man third verse was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who had built the house had honored had more honor than the house that's that's it for every house is built by some man but he that built all things is God Amen and Moses barely was faithful in all his house as a servant for Testimony of those things which were to be spoken after now put it together put it together as a servant I thank you for Testimony of those things which were to be spoken why do you think we needed the seals to be open [Music] because brother was a day hallelujah amen but he had to lay something down here after yeah hallelujah amen and that's why he God had him to put the message on books and tapes Hallelujah you don't know how blessed you are because you believe and have not seen sounds [Music] oh my heart foreign and that's what is he went out and Hunt don't get me wrong I'm not coming to you now but there was time the brother Brandon and God was stood in the same body yeah foreign [Music] Glory amen amen amen amen amen amen this is a Heavenly calling hallelujah amen you couldn't see this thing if you wanted to GPS a Heavenly calling Celeste is above the sky it's a Celestial calling is that right that's what he said when you hear this word when you receive this message [Music] Onward Christian and Soldier marching come against us are we we gotta fight we gotta fight for every age the one thing he told Joshua he said wherever you put your foot you claim it Joshua your foot stops Hallelujah he's giving it to me say brother Brooks I don't have long suffering like I need to put yourself and let the angel take care of it say brother I don't have brotherly kindness yeah man let the angel hear you Proclaim it and they're selling songs that's the way it was statistics Abraham never did get discouraged all those years 20 25 years Sarah didn't have a baby yet the problem that God said he they fashioned a little baby room together [Music] that's what I will wait until God hallelujah I don't care how long it takes I'm gonna wait till I change amen Glory glory to God Amen amen this is a call this greater than the king calling it hallelujah amen it's like king of calling Esther Hallelujah [Music] glory to God yes sir did she come yes she did Hallelujah and because she came in past 11 so you can understand what I'm saying Esther had to go through a process instead of it yes I had to go through a process and as long as she did what the chambermen told her to do Hallelujah as long as you live the life or should I do with the prophet of God said dude yourself in the king's chamber Hallelujah come on Glory hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah Psalms 138. one more minutes the sixth verse foreign [Music] [Music] yet have he respect unto the lowly Hallelujah though he be high let the anality has respect for the lonely Hallelujah he saw a woman who had an issue of blood yeah Hallelujah but God had respect he saw a woman at a well Jesus said I have need to go by Samaria Hallelujah and the reason why Jesus had a need because God had a need to come by your house God had a need because he saw you yesterday is mine you may have been covered with mud you might have been covered with dirt but in the mind of God of God nothing can change that if yeah [Music] Hallelujah even when those are hypocrites those Pharisees wanted to Stone a woman who was caught in US they saw an adulterer but God saw a daughter Hallelujah what kind of perversion you've gotten into nothing with God you succeed that you carrying somebody help me yeah [Applause] amen Hallelujah am I I like this because church people always trying to judge others they want to judge everybody church people judge everybody hey everybody Wicked for you I have to laugh at that was that family foreign the journey is on yeah the leading of the Holy Spirit leads a manification and on to Perfection did you hear what I said God will wait on you come little sheep come come and when he can't get you to come yeah he goes and he breaks your legs that's how important you are to him Hallelujah before he lets the devil get full control of you Shepherd he's a good shepherd and his name is jealous his name is jealous hallelujah amen and he's going to do everything he can do to keep you saved [Music] Hallelujah hallelujah amen faith will over overcome all fears I'm almost done will have you overcome overcome your past yeah and presence and future faith will cause you to overcome Beyond fear a witnessing to the others gospel to the gospel you know a lot of time we have you been there before you you need to testify on your job and you're afraid to do it okay to say something if I say something I might get fired which one you want to want to fire you God or your boss man elujah amen they told those disciples Don't You Preach in this name of Jesus no more and what did they say hey I'd rather obey God than you gonna tell me not to preach a witness in Jesus name see you got to overcome that Allah that's all I'm saying if you want to
