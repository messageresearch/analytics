[37:29] and let your precious Holy Spirit have
[37:31] its way in Jesus name we say amen thank
[37:37] you musicians if you guys have your word
[37:43] which you Scriptures the Bible are we
[37:48] gonna go ahead and go to two different
[37:50] scriptures this morning
[37:55] if you don't even my name is uh brother
[37:59] Paul Jean come all the way down from
[38:01] Boynton Beach Florida and I'm just happy
[38:04] to be up in the cold and are you were
[38:07] but even the area could be cold but the
[38:11] Holy Spirit is hot so we just pray that
[38:14] the Holy Spirit will have his way this
[38:16] morning if we had a the word witchy this
[38:21] morning we got to go to two verses two
[38:23] scriptures the first one is in 1st
[38:25] Samuel 1st Samuel Chapter 7 verse 3
[38:39] First Samuel chapter seven verse three
[38:46] and when you get to say hey man if to
[38:48] let me know that she got there first
[38:53] time you'll chapter 7 verse 3 you know
[38:55] and the scripture reads like this and it
[38:57] says and Samuel spake unto all the house
[39:00] of Israel saying if you do return unto
[39:05] the Lord with all your hearts then put
[39:07] away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from
[39:10] among you and prepare your hearts unto
[39:13] the Lord and serve him only he will
[39:16] deliver you out of the hand of the
[39:17] Philistines that was first time he said
[39:20] in verse 3 the next one is first Kings
[39:23] chapter 18 verse 21 first Kings chapter
[39:29] 18 verse 21
[39:41] the scripture reads and Elijah came unto
[39:44] all the people and said how long halt ye
[39:49] between two opinions if the Lord be God
[39:53] and follow him but if Beldon follow him
[39:58] and the people answered him not a word
[40:01] you may have your seats this morning we
[40:05] just gonna jump straight into the the
[40:08] word anointing and I like to always
[40:11] start off with a the inspiration of what
[40:15] I'm preaching about and the inspiration
[40:18] that I have this morning with this
[40:20] subject that I've been studying on and
[40:22] reading and meditating is either you
[40:25] have the Holy Spirit or you don't have
[40:27] it but if you don't come and get it
[40:31] either you have the Holy Spirit or you
[40:33] don't have it but if you don't have it
[40:36] come and get it so my title is are you
[40:40] all in or are you all out
[40:43] are you all in or you are allowed to
[40:47] begin we got a from the messenger from
[40:51] the Colts the time of decision 1959 it
[40:56] says you know we have been forced to
[40:59] make decisions there is times when we
[41:02] have to come to a place where we got to
[41:04] say yes or no that's just human life
[41:07] there's a time where we cannot stand
[41:09] neutral if God shall permit I don't
[41:13] believe that we are able to lead this
[41:14] church tonight or this morning in the
[41:16] same condition that we did when we come
[41:19] into it if the Holy Spirit shall come
[41:21] and do his work among us then we are
[41:22] forced to say yes or no we cannot remain
[41:24] the same Samuel saw the children of
[41:28] Israel worse were serving in going after
[41:31] strange gods even though they were
[41:34] commissioned to only serve the true and
[41:36] living God the god of Jehovah
[41:39] Elijah also saw that Israel was confused
[41:43] they were not sure on what grant to
[41:46] stand on who to believe they were stuck
[41:49] between bill and God
[41:51] and you know today it seems like people
[41:53] do not know where to stand he also
[41:56] wanted to know where the people stand
[41:59] therefore that there comes upon
[42:02] questions there are moments in your life
[42:05] when you got to make a decision see the
[42:09] children of Israel stayed silent when
[42:11] the time of showdown came see either
[42:14] they were serving God or they were not
[42:16] serving God so this morning actually
[42:20] again
[42:21] are you all in tagada are you not
[42:24] because God needs people to believe in
[42:26] him if you're not gonna believe in him
[42:27] then don't believe in him at all
[42:29] because it is your decision everyone has
[42:32] to make a decision everyone has choices
[42:35] to decide about your future which are
[42:38] you going to what you're gonna eat what
[42:39] you're gonna wear God gave man and
[42:42] angels a choice see the ability to
[42:46] decide or to pick or to truth is in you
[42:50] but you have to make a decision when you
[42:54] make a decision you choose you make a
[42:57] choice about it you got to stick to it
[42:59] because every choice has rewards and
[43:02] consequences the Prophet who said in
[43:06] paragraph 11 the time of decision he
[43:09] said you see God don't make all of our
[43:11] decisions there's many times that God
[43:15] doesn't tell his prophets just what to
[43:18] do
[43:20] because they have to make the decision
[43:23] if there is no decision that we have to
[43:26] make just wait every move on God then
[43:29] there is no overcoming on our part and
[43:32] sometimes they make the wrong decision
[43:36] God's anointed prophets make the wrong
[43:39] decisions and many times they are
[43:40] deceived
[43:41] time decision paragraph 11 1959 if you
[43:44] want to read it so my question is very
[43:48] simple very direct whose team are you on
[43:52] whose side are you on are you going
[43:56] after God are you going after the world
[43:57] because you got to figure out are you a
[43:59] believer of that are you not you got to
[44:01] make a decision you just can't keep
[44:04] coming
[44:04] just because you felt like coming to
[44:06] church it got to be a real decision when
[44:09] you make a choice you got to know that
[44:10] you made the touch with all your heart
[44:12] everybody got to make a choice but it
[44:15] seems like many of people who come to
[44:18] church or who are in God horn or word
[44:19] there are stuck between living for God
[44:21] and living for the world you cannot
[44:24] serve two masters either God is your
[44:26] master or the devil is your master
[44:27] there's no in-between maybe if not no so
[44:30] either you serve God or you're not if
[44:32] you're not serving God you got no choice
[44:34] but to serve the devil when God made man
[44:43] god made man with a choice but it is man
[44:49] choice whether you want to be like God
[44:51] or you don't want to be like God God
[44:53] doesn't force anybody to be like him but
[44:55] you got to have it in your heart it got
[44:57] to be a CD it has to be something in you
[45:00] that wants to be just like God so a
[45:05] decision got to be made so we need we as
[45:11] people got to make a decision it is a
[45:14] time of decision too many people are in
[45:17] and out so I say one more time
[45:23] you got to pick a side you got to figure
[45:26] out are you all left or you all out are
[45:29] you going to stay with the Word of God
[45:30] or are you not going to stay what a guy
[45:32] cuz many people gonna come and then
[45:33] people gonna leave but you got to know
[45:37] if God has put something in your heart
[45:39] to believe in him you gotta stick to it
[45:46] like I said every decision that you make
[45:49] has rewards and it also has some
[45:52] consequences it can be good or it can be
[45:56] bad they can be right or can be wrong
[45:58] but you have to make a decision who are
[46:04] you going to serve and what are you
[46:08] going to do because to serve God you got
[46:12] to have some guts you got to have faith
[46:14] and then you got to stand with the word
[46:16] you got
[46:17] and true when you make a decision you
[46:21] got to be committed so you can't serve
[46:23] God today and serve the devil tomorrow
[46:25] either you're serving God every day
[46:26] you're serving the devil every day but
[46:28] you got to pick one
[46:33] when you make a choice you gotta mean
[46:36] what you say you got to stick to it you
[46:38] got to give it everything that you have
[46:43] because some decisions that you make
[46:46] choices that you make either will set
[46:48] you free or will keep you in slavery for
[46:49] your life the Prophet said here and why
[46:57] is it why is it that so many Christians
[46:59] find it so hard to live a Christian life
[47:02] he says here because well now we got all
[47:05] kinds of everything coming and you
[47:07] haven't got it till you get it but
[47:10] brother you haven't got it until it is
[47:13] the Spirit of God that comes from heaven
[47:15] and changes your life that makes the
[47:18] fruits of your life a different person
[47:20] by their fruits you shall know them
[47:23] that's the reason you have so much ups
[47:25] and down - they're gonna come to church
[47:28] and some Christians and then some are
[47:30] not but when you have something when he
[47:33] when he had a power when you have a Holy
[47:35] Spirit in your life you know that you're
[47:37] a believer and that is my mission that
[47:40] is my goal dad we got to have the Holy
[47:42] Spirit without that you can never be a
[47:45] real Christian you could pretend all you
[47:47] want to but you gonna show your colors
[47:54] the Prophet said in total deliverance
[47:56] paragraph 49 he said if you are a
[48:00] Christian see God don't make halfway
[48:03] Christians God makes complete Christians
[48:07] God don't make halfway preachers but the
[48:10] preacher can be halfway and God makes
[48:13] his children Christians remember that
[48:15] God makes his children Christians but
[48:19] sometimes they're halfway Christian but
[48:22] it is not God's intention for them to be
[48:25] that way it's their own ways that God
[48:30] makes
[48:31] with the plan of God for their life
[48:34] that's what makes them what they were
[48:37] the way they are
[48:38] God doesn't don't want them to be
[48:40] halfway Christian or halfway preachers
[48:42] or compromising on either side he wants
[48:45] them to be to completely stand in the
[48:47] breach meaning that you got to make a
[48:48] choice and stick to it if you're going
[48:51] to be a real Christian be the best real
[48:53] Christian that she can be but you got to
[48:55] have the Holy Spirit first the same
[49:02] sermon he says in paragraph 77 he says
[49:05] we want complete deliverance we don't
[49:09] want to be a halfway Church I can't
[49:11] stand out I don't want to be halfway we
[49:14] want to be a real church or no church at
[49:17] all we want to be real Christians or no
[49:19] Christians at all but you got to make a
[49:22] choice you got to stand strong believing
[49:26] that either God called you to be a
[49:28] Christian like he not but if he called
[49:30] you then he'd get you something to equip
[49:32] me to become a real Christian we call it
[49:34] the Holy Spirit it is the holy the owner
[49:38] the Holy Spirit is the only thing I can
[49:40] make you like Christ you can read books
[49:43] or you want to watch movies try to
[49:45] imitate but if you don't got something
[49:47] in your soul a real Spirit of God to
[49:49] change your life you will never become
[49:51] it either you're all in or you're all
[49:57] out
[49:58] you got to make have a commitment you
[50:00] got to have some guts to serve God you
[50:04] got to be firm in your choice because
[50:06] you can't just keep come to church
[50:08] because it's a good thing to do Church I
[50:12] realized I don't see in some people some
[50:14] athletes like LeBron James Kobe Bryant
[50:17] some people doing weed these people give
[50:19] so much effort just to play basketball
[50:23] LeBron James spent a million dollars on
[50:26] himself so he can play basketball people
[50:31] spend so time to look good they look
[50:33] pretty but we don't want to we don't
[50:35] want to take that same kind of effort to
[50:36] be a real Christian but we watch these
[50:40] people on you know dunking the ball
[50:41] playing movies playing different roles
[50:44] and stuff like we wanted
[50:45] coming just like that person but God
[50:47] hasn't called us to be somebody else
[50:48] that he did not create us for to be when
[50:51] God made us he made it to be a Christian
[50:53] but sometimes we we we get relaxed we
[50:58] get lazy we get tired you know but what
[51:04] I like about Kobe Bryant is that he made
[51:06] a choice to pursue excellence even in
[51:08] playing basketball everything he did he
[51:11] said that he wanted to win and be the
[51:13] best everything that he and this is a
[51:15] man of the flesh LeBron James is the
[51:18] same way Dwyane Wade Michael Jordan was
[51:21] the same way he said he he wanna win and
[51:23] everything but everybody wants to be
[51:26] like Jordan but Christ people don't put
[51:31] their effort to be like Christ
[51:33] but let me tell you if you have the Holy
[51:35] Spirit and you stick to it you stay what
[51:37] the word it will make you just like
[51:39] Christ the best version of Christ is the
[51:43] Holy Spirit but you gotta have it in
[51:45] your Sony it ain't no maybe you can't
[51:47] pretend it gotta be a real thing a real
[51:50] experience
[51:51] they gotta be real life listen I grew up
[51:54] in church my dad was a pastor I knew I
[52:00] was supposed to be living right but I
[52:01] didn't have something in me to make me
[52:03] live right brother Brooks I went to the
[52:07] world I went basketball games I went to
[52:08] football games I left Hannah's country I
[52:10] was born and raised here so I know what
[52:12] it is to be in church and be in an out
[52:14] of church I had worldly friends but you
[52:18] know what something always told me I got
[52:20] to live better even when I was out there
[52:24] stealing lying doing all kinds of wrong
[52:27] things
[52:28] I knew this something in me that had to
[52:30] be better and then sometimes we we come
[52:34] to church when we get confused we know
[52:36] that God is speaking to us but sometimes
[52:37] we don't respond to when God is talking
[52:39] to us listen I don't been to some youth
[52:44] services where I see the power of God I
[52:45] fell down and I still left worse but
[52:51] they came a point in my life that either
[52:52] I had to make a choice or I wasn't
[52:55] either I was with God or I was with the
[52:58] devil but
[52:59] had to make a decision and I thank God
[53:01] that I made the right decision but just
[53:06] because I made a decision is just a step
[53:08] I needed I needed I needed a power in me
[53:11] to make me just like Christ and the Holy
[53:13] Spirit that power I don't care if you're
[53:16] seven years old 1735 we need more of the
[53:18] Holy Spirit to become just like Christ
[53:20] because without it you can never be a
[53:21] real Christian
[53:22] you can come play music listen I play
[53:25] music I played the drums and I was still
[53:29] living like the world still lying still
[53:32] cheating still don't whole bunch of
[53:33] foolishness but when I got a real
[53:35] experience in my life that changed me
[53:37] forever
[53:38] I don't got to pretend to be myself I am
[53:41] a real Christian do I make mistakes you
[53:44] better believe it do I do wrong yes sir
[53:47] but I'm telling when you have the Holy
[53:49] Spirit it makes you just like Christ
[53:51] that you will confess every one that you
[53:53] did being afraid to be corrected you
[53:56] ain't afraid to pursue greatness in God
[54:00] when I look at these people on TV I'm
[54:02] like we paying them money to play a game
[54:07] and then God has given us life for free
[54:11] but people rather go to again and rather
[54:14] go to church and see God moving but they
[54:15] try to see a basketball player moving
[54:18] what any man can die but if you have God
[54:22] you will never die even in their grave
[54:25] he was still resident wretched but you
[54:26] got to have a Holy Spirit inside of you
[54:31] they say know me pretend this is my life
[54:33] I know the way I was living I know what
[54:37] I did I was a pastor's child kid my dad
[54:41] was the first one so I got all the
[54:43] rebuke sort of criticism but I know
[54:48] people always wanted me to be something
[54:50] great but the only way that you can be
[54:52] really great is if you had the Holy
[54:53] Spirit and it's not just being great
[54:56] just like the world know is it's
[54:58] allowing the Holy Spirit of God to live
[55:01] himself in you but sometimes you know
[55:05] when God is speaking I don't be in a new
[55:08] services with the anointing came down
[55:10] God has spoken I
[55:11] setting up my arms cause like yeah
[55:13] mm-hmm it's good and I left worse
[55:16] knowing that I should've gave my life to
[55:17] Christ now that I got older I realized I
[55:22] should know what I should have served
[55:23] God earlier but you know what God has a
[55:26] time to catch you but you never don't
[55:30] want to cross that line that you can
[55:31] never come back and but you got to make
[55:33] the right decision now you got to stay
[55:38] strong you got to be committed that if
[55:40] God is calling me if God put me in this
[55:42] church that means there's something more
[55:43] to be waiting to be seen you see I know
[55:50] what my life is I know what I'm called
[55:52] to do and I ain't scared to do it
[55:54] I'll let the devil know that I am called
[55:56] to be a real Christian I don't got to
[56:00] pretend I don't got to put on I don't
[56:02] got to be no fake no I'm a puppy but I
[56:04] make mistakes yeah even with the Holy
[56:07] Spirit you can still do things that are
[56:08] wrong it is on it that the grace of God
[56:11] can't keep you from sinning that's the
[56:13] only thing I'm telling but when you have
[56:15] the Holy Spirit you don't got a world
[56:17] about if you're gonna live right or
[56:18] wrong
[56:19] the Holy Spirit gonna make you live
[56:20] right and even when he's living wrong
[56:22] it's gonna make you live wrong to the
[56:23] right but you gotta have it they say no
[56:30] maybe pretend I think so I might so no
[56:33] no you got to have it it's something
[56:37] that when you play music people don't
[56:39] wanna see me they'll see your life
[56:40] through the music turn I want you to
[56:46] leave out of here this weekend knowing
[56:48] that if you don't have it do everything
[56:50] that she can to get it the Prophet said
[56:55] that he said uh-uh
[56:57] if you want to be somebody got to get
[56:59] into their spirit people want to be like
[57:03] Jordan people listen I don't want to be
[57:04] like Michael Jordan to like Kobe Bryant
[57:06] like Dwayne Wade see but you have to get
[57:08] under their spirit you can see the devil
[57:10] knows that but if you want to be like
[57:12] Christ you got to get into his spirit
[57:14] and once you get into his spirit in his
[57:16] spirit is in you you will be just like
[57:18] Christ people can say all sort of things
[57:21] about you they can kind of mistreat you
[57:22] and you would still love them
[57:25] when nobody want to come to church you
[57:27] would still come to church and still
[57:28] love God and shout sing jump and dance
[57:30] and do whatever but sometime you know we
[57:33] come to church come on come on people
[57:35] let's sing let's jump let's Dan listen
[57:38] when he had the Holy Ghost you don't got
[57:39] to be forced it's natural and you know
[57:43] what if you want to be a natural
[57:44] Christian you gotta have the Holy Spirit
[57:45] first the Holy Spirit is don't they now
[57:49] make you a natural Christian day-in and
[57:51] day-out at home last school I work
[57:53] anywhere any place any time people would
[57:56] know that you're a real Christian
[57:57] because they see the Spirit of Christ in
[57:59] you that is the goal that is the motive
[58:02] of this message ain't ain't about just
[58:04] going to the Russia to go to Russia
[58:05] gotta have the Holy Spirit first if you
[58:08] want to be a real preacher got a
[58:09] preacher with the Holy Spirit first you
[58:12] want to be a real musician gotta have
[58:13] the Holy Ghost first listen I tell you
[58:17] I've done it and I tell you we play
[58:21] music without the Holy Spirit we don't
[58:24] try to you know sound good but you know
[58:25] what at the end of the day our life feel
[58:27] empty there was something that was
[58:31] missing there was a power in our life
[58:34] that wasn't there sometimes just because
[58:38] you know you're under an anointing under
[58:40] your pastors ministry or under your
[58:42] father under your parents it can be
[58:44] covered by certain things but there
[58:46] comes a point that when you see the
[58:47] devil you got to make a choice
[58:49] either you're with me or you're not
[58:51] either you with God or you're not and
[58:54] that's why I aspire to say either are
[58:56] you all into Christ or you not because
[58:59] Christ don't want people who are halfway
[59:01] any real believers got to be a real
[59:04] believer in God but sometimes you know
[59:08] we get confused sometimes we get
[59:09] conflicted sometimes we come to church
[59:12] and we like what the world does we like
[59:14] you know we like how the world looks you
[59:17] know we like making things you know make
[59:20] us laugh and what now you know we left
[59:22] you know you know we love having all
[59:24] these different kind of things the
[59:25] jewelry the fashion we like looking good
[59:27] we like wearing a frightening or latest
[59:29] outfit the new sneakers the Jordans the
[59:31] Nikes the haraki's they're airmax we
[59:33] like looking cool well I can looking
[59:35] nice and at school that whatnot
[59:37] you know we like having all the good
[59:39] stuff you know all the Gucci bags
[59:40] Versace we all like but I'm telling what
[59:44] the best name-brand she can have is
[59:45] Christ in your life he's the greatest
[59:49] thing that there ever is on earth right
[59:51] now and he's not hitting him up but he's
[59:54] living through a bunch of people who are
[59:56] called his bride his Christians his real
[59:58] believers but she got to have the brand
[1:00:00] mark inside your soul ain't just maybe
[1:00:05] listen I don't been there I don't see
[1:00:07] listen I don't been deter I don't play
[1:00:09] music I don't make people dance and
[1:00:11] shout and scream but I left worse
[1:00:15] knowing that God called me to be
[1:00:17] something more but I left worse because
[1:00:19] the spirit told me I come and get the
[1:00:22] spirit but I like nah I'm too young I'm
[1:00:26] not ready excuse me I'm not ready yet I
[1:00:32] don't want to give up my friends I don't
[1:00:36] want to give up my influence I don't
[1:00:38] want to look like I'm not cool well you
[1:00:42] know what if you don't have the Holy
[1:00:43] Spirit you ain't cool I touched my
[1:00:48] church last week I said if you don't
[1:00:49] have the Holy Spirit you look ugly I
[1:00:52] said if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:00:53] look nasty your attitude is dirty but if
[1:00:58] you have the Holy Spirit LLL make you
[1:00:59] sweet humble kind patient and you don't
[1:01:04] gotta force it it just naturally uses
[1:01:06] out of your life but you got to make a
[1:01:10] choice now you got to make a stand you
[1:01:12] got to be committed now either you're
[1:01:14] gonna get this Holy Spirit or you're not
[1:01:16] either you're gonna have your only
[1:01:18] revival or you're not either you're
[1:01:21] gonna really serve God or you're not but
[1:01:24] I can't force it to you the pastor came
[1:01:26] for it but you got to make your own
[1:01:27] decision and God respects when people
[1:01:30] make their own decisions even God has to
[1:01:34] respect the choice that you make ain't
[1:01:36] that crazy the person that created you
[1:01:39] has to respect your choice well I think
[1:01:43] God that I made a choice to serve Him
[1:01:45] long ago and even when I'm falling he
[1:01:48] stood there to help me each and every
[1:01:49] single day
[1:01:51] even when I'm not kind he makes me kind
[1:01:53] even when I'm not humble he makes me
[1:01:55] humble even when I'm not holding he
[1:01:58] makes me holy ain't no put on put its
[1:02:00] thought it's a real power of the Holy
[1:02:02] Spirit what changed you to make you
[1:02:04] become like a Christian there ain't no
[1:02:07] real Christian without the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] get that in your mind put it in your
[1:02:10] heart write it down memorize it they
[1:02:12] ain't never will be a real Christian
[1:02:14] without the Holy Spirit I'm telling you
[1:02:17] if you want to be real if you if you if
[1:02:19] you really know that your card of God go
[1:02:21] all the way get everything that God has
[1:02:24] every power every blessing every victory
[1:02:27] every every every anointing that you
[1:02:30] have is in the Holy Spirit but you got
[1:02:32] to go and get it you got to go and get
[1:02:35] it yourself you got to make a choice you
[1:02:37] can't be in between maybe I'll come to

[1:02:42] all in or you are not even when you come
[1:02:46] structure give your best or you don't
[1:02:47] don't give God no half-crab foolishness
[1:02:51] sometimes we give God garbage I'll be
[1:02:55] the first to tell you me me me too
[1:02:56] sometimes a preacher too sometimes we
[1:02:59] come to church retired we're lazy we
[1:03:01] don't want to sing and we promise God
[1:03:03] God if you change my life I'll sing for
[1:03:05] you I'll do this I'll do that and you
[1:03:07] know we lying but you know what the Holy
[1:03:10] Spirit would still help you the power of
[1:03:13] God would still help you if you want to
[1:03:16] be cool at school don't worry get the
[1:03:18] Holy Spirit you'll be cool because you
[1:03:22] have something that will make you live
[1:03:23] forever if you want to be great you
[1:03:29] gotta have a great God in you but if you
[1:03:33] want to be average wouldn't be just like
[1:03:35] everybody else then go ahead and be like
[1:03:37] everybody else but you got to make a
[1:03:40] decision you got to know that God has
[1:03:42] called you to be greater listen
[1:03:45] everybody has a purpose in life but you
[1:03:48] got to know your purpose some people
[1:03:52] could be the carpet the chairs the car
[1:03:54] you could be anything in life but if you
[1:03:57] know in your heart that God calls you to
[1:03:59] be a Christian be the best Christian
[1:04:01] that you can be a real one but first you
[1:04:04] got to have the
[1:04:05] holy spirit you gotta have a fresh
[1:04:07] baptism if you don't have it pray that
[1:04:10] you get it fast pray read ask the pastor
[1:04:14] to help you see I need something that
[1:04:17] when I can't be a Christian that there's
[1:04:19] something in me that will make me be a
[1:04:20] real Christian but you gotta have it but
[1:04:27] they got to be your own choice
[1:04:28] your mom can't force you dad I can't
[1:04:30] force you the pastor can't force even
[1:04:32] God himself the creator of you came and
[1:04:35] forcing but you got to know that you got
[1:04:38] to make a real choice you gotta be
[1:04:41] all-in to God or not either you're gonna
[1:04:45] ride with God are you gonna die without
[1:04:46] them
[1:04:47] either you're gonna ride with Christ or
[1:04:50] you're gonna die without them and the
[1:04:52] only way to ride to a crisis to have the
[1:04:54] Holy Spirit okay that's the only thing
[1:04:56] that if you ride into the ground he'll
[1:04:57] ride you back up if you want to go to a
[1:05:01] rapture you got a ride with Christ in
[1:05:03] his heart in your soul but if you don't
[1:05:06] want to go okay well don't then don't
[1:05:08] come to church then if you don't want to
[1:05:10] go then don't serve Him but if you
[1:05:13] really want to go if you know that
[1:05:14] you're called to be great and you know
[1:05:17] well a and I'll be strange to say this
[1:05:21] but the only great thing that there is
[1:05:23] is the Holy Spirit that is the greatest
[1:05:26] thing that can change this whole entire
[1:05:28] world is the Holy Spirit that's the only
[1:05:31] thing that will make you become a great
[1:05:32] Christian not just the way you talk
[1:05:35] number but if you have a real anointing
[1:05:38] of the passage of the Holy Spirit in
[1:05:39] your life
[1:05:40] a real power a real fruit changing a
[1:05:43] real character changing of the Holy
[1:05:45] Spirit that will make you be a real
[1:05:47] Christian don't settle for being average
[1:05:52] don't settle for being okay don't settle
[1:05:56] for being less than B greater be more be
[1:06:01] stronger be faster be smarter be more
[1:06:05] holier through the Holy Spirit only
[1:06:15] got a few more minutes here the Prophet
[1:06:19] said here 1950 56 the arrows of God
[1:06:23] deliverance are from a bow he said
[1:06:25] brother when you got the baptism of the
[1:06:28] Holy Ghost
[1:06:29] it takes that old temper out of you so
[1:06:31] if you got a temper you need the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost it puts on a dress and makes you
[1:06:37] act like a lady so if you have a
[1:06:39] dressing you're not a lady get the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost
[1:06:41] it'll make you quit smoking drinking
[1:06:43] lying stealing and everything brother
[1:06:46] when you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost it separates you it delivers you
[1:06:52] from the things of the world amen it
[1:06:54] makes you love God you can't really love
[1:06:57] God until you have a real Holy Ghost in
[1:06:59] your life it makes you go to church it
[1:07:03] makes you worship Him it makes you tell
[1:07:06] your neighbor about it it makes you live
[1:07:08] above sin hallelujah but you got to have
[1:07:12] the Holy Spirit but you first you got to
[1:07:15] make your own choice remember what I
[1:07:18] said every choice every choice that you
[1:07:22] make in life has rewards or Consequences
[1:07:24] has blessings and cursings
[1:07:27] but you got to make that choice
[1:07:29] sometimes it's scary but let me tell you
[1:07:32] if you make the choice for a god you
[1:07:34] don't got to worry about it for the rest
[1:07:35] of your life you might have some ups and
[1:07:38] get downs but one thing's for sure that
[1:07:39] if you got God that's all you need the
[1:07:46] only thing that you need in life is a
[1:07:48] true Holy Spirit of God once you have
[1:07:53] the Holy Ghost you have everything that
[1:07:55] you need see the main thing is to have
[1:07:58] the main thing the main thing is to have
[1:08:02] the main thing what is the main thing
[1:08:03] the main thing is the Holy Ghost down
[1:08:06] into your soul then you can be like the
[1:08:08] main thing then you will be a main thing
[1:08:10] but to be the main thing you got to have
[1:08:12] it the main thing what is the main thing
[1:08:15] the main thing is the Holy Spirit in
[1:08:16] your soul not in your mind not on your
[1:08:18] flesh not on your body but deep down in
[1:08:21] your soul that that will take out that
[1:08:22] temper
[1:08:23] take out all that anger or that
[1:08:25] depression or that anxiety or that
[1:08:27] stress or that lust only the Holy Spirit
[1:08:31] can change your life you can only be a
[1:08:36] real Christian if you have a real Holy
[1:08:38] Spirit in your soul I'll say one more
[1:08:44] time you can only be a real Christian if
[1:08:46] you have a real Holy Spirit in your soul
[1:08:49] you got to be either all into it or
[1:08:55] you're all out
[1:08:56] there's no mate between God there's no
[1:08:59] neutral in God
[1:09:02] there's no neutral in the devil either
[1:09:04] either you're on God's side or you're on
[1:09:06] the wrong side see but when you pick
[1:09:09] God's side you're on the winning side so
[1:09:11] you're on the winning team but if you're
[1:09:13] not on God's side and I'm sorry to tell
[1:09:15] you you ain't gonna be winning anything
[1:09:20] so you got to make a choice what side of
[1:09:23] do you want to be on are you gonna be on
[1:09:26] God's side or not cuz Israel had to make
[1:09:30] a choice either they were gonna serve
[1:09:32] the Lord God or serve bill but they had
[1:09:34] to make a choice
[1:09:35] all the Prophet did was show them who
[1:09:38] was the real God and that was it but the
[1:09:41] people had to make a real choice they
[1:09:43] had to make a real decision are we
[1:09:46] serving God for real are we not are we
[1:09:49] just just having this church that's the
[1:09:51] half Church all we want to be a real
[1:09:52] church when a realtor's got to have any
[1:09:55] real word a real word gonna have a real
[1:09:57] Holy Ghost just that simple
[1:10:11] whose team are you on and whose side are
[1:10:15] you on you got to make a choice if you
[1:10:21] want to be on the winning team then you
[1:10:23] got to pick Christ but if you don't pick
[1:10:26] Christ and you automatically go to the
[1:10:28] losing team but you got to pick a team
[1:10:32] you got to pick a side
[1:10:33] you got to pick a squad you got to pick
[1:10:36] a game I like to my turn I said the best
[1:10:40] game that there is is the Bride of
[1:10:41] Christ I said the best group that there
[1:10:44] is is the Bride of Christ because that's
[1:10:48] the people who got the real Holy Spirit
[1:10:50] of God that's people who look like
[1:10:51] Christ but if you want to be what the
[1:10:54] best team if you want to be on a winning
[1:10:56] team that you got to pick Christ if you
[1:11:00] want somebody to be with you at all
[1:11:02] times and you got to pick Christ he's
[1:11:05] the only person that even when
[1:11:06] everything is dark he still is the light
[1:11:10] even when are you drowning in sin he's
[1:11:13] gone person I can pull you up out of sin
[1:11:17] even when you're minors confused he's
[1:11:19] the only one I can give you peace in
[1:11:21] your mind but you got to make a choice I
[1:11:26] can't tell you not anymore but you got
[1:11:28] to make your own choice you got to know
[1:11:32] what do you really want to serve God are
[1:11:34] you not as the musicians come I got a
[1:11:40] few things that I heard that I'm gonna
[1:11:42] share with you and you can take note of
[1:11:49] this and you young people remember this
[1:11:53] for your life okay the first thing is
[1:11:58] when you make a choice stick to it
[1:12:03] whatever choice that you make stick to
[1:12:06] it
[1:12:07] whatever choice that you make in your
[1:12:09] life stick to it if you're gonna stay
[1:12:14] with the word and stay with the word if
[1:12:16] you're gonna stay with God's name of God
[1:12:17] if you can stay with the true state
[1:12:18] you're gonna stay in church stay in
[1:12:19] church
[1:12:20] but don't be in between if you find
[1:12:24] yourself in between make a stand make a
[1:12:26] choice they committed to it that's the
[1:12:28] only way that God can truly bless you
[1:12:30] but you got to stick to it you got to
[1:12:34] stick to it the next thing is that you
[1:12:36] got to stand fast stand fast means that
[1:12:40] you got to hold on to it nobody can't
[1:12:43] take it from you as I said last night
[1:12:44] whatever God gives you is non-negotiable
[1:12:48] if God gives you something if God puts
[1:12:51] something in your heart do not negotiate
[1:12:53] it with the devil because whatever God
[1:12:56] gives you it is for you so if God gives
[1:13:00] you a love of God for him it is for you
[1:13:03] to love God but you gotta stand fast you
[1:13:08] gotta stick to it
[1:13:10] the next thing is that you got to show
[1:13:12] your colors you got to let people know
[1:13:15] what side are you on see every team got
[1:13:18] a uniform every team got a logo every
[1:13:25] team also got a coach every team got
[1:13:28] players every team if you want to win
[1:13:32] you gotta practice so if you want to be
[1:13:35] a real Christian where you got a
[1:13:36] practice prayer want to be a real
[1:13:39] believer you got our practice fasting
[1:13:41] want to be a real believer you gotta
[1:13:43] practice love but first you need a power
[1:13:47] of the Holy Spirit in your life first
[1:13:49] and foremost you got to prove yourself
[1:13:57] believers just believe their actions are
[1:14:03] seen by their fruits their testimonies
[1:14:08] and witnesses how do we know that
[1:14:11] somebody is playing great or how
[1:14:14] somebody is looks great because of their
[1:14:16] actions however somebody is a Christian
[1:14:20] because of their actions how does the
[1:14:23] body is a real Holy Ghost Christians
[1:14:24] because of their actions
[1:14:28] remember you got to stick to it you got
[1:14:31] to stand fast and you got to show your
[1:14:33] colors as I said in closing every team
[1:14:37] got a uniform every team got a logo the
[1:14:43] logo of Christianity is Christ's the
[1:14:47] uniform is the Holy Spirit but for you
[1:14:52] to wear that Holy Spirit it has to be
[1:14:54] inside of you just don't think that this
[1:14:58] is just a regular service that I can't
[1:15:00] hear for nothing I can't because the
[1:15:01] reason is something I really need the
[1:15:03] Holy Spirit somebody got my needle of
[1:15:07] fresh or refilling of you you just can't
[1:15:10] come to church and play music just
[1:15:11] because it's a good thing to do
[1:15:14] listen I tell you when you have the Holy
[1:15:16] Spirit it would change your church
[1:15:17] service
[1:15:19] it will change our neighborhood even
[1:15:24] attention even though all the people to
[1:15:25] get closer to God but it starts with you
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:32] don't leave here this weekend without
[1:15:35] having a real experience with that then
[1:15:37] you know what I'm saying buddy Brooks I
[1:15:39] don't got to be even in church you can
[1:15:43] experience God in your bedroom in your
[1:15:46] car at school in the bathroom you can
[1:15:48] experience God anywhere sometimes that
[1:15:52] becomes traditional we got to come to
[1:15:54] the altar to pray I in traditional early
[1:15:58] church right now and say you know you go
[1:16:00] find a hole that goes at your house
[1:16:03] because sometimes we limit God that way
[1:16:06] listen God is God is unbelievable he can
[1:16:08] do anything anywhere anytime that he
[1:16:10] wants to but you got to be committed you
[1:16:14] got to make a choice if you got to know
[1:16:20] that God is calling you to be greater
[1:16:23] God is calling you to live more when God
[1:16:28] called Christians he don't caucus it to
[1:16:30] be average but I don't want to be
[1:16:32] average Church if LeBron James ain't
[1:16:35] average Kobe Bryant ain't average Dwyane
[1:16:38] Wade any Arab I me as I believe I would
[1:16:40] not be average people out in a music
[1:16:45] world you got car D but you got jay-z
[1:16:46] you got a whole bunch of these people
[1:16:48] and they give their whole entire life to
[1:16:50] serve the devil but we asked Christians
[1:16:54] we do what oh no no I am committed this
[1:16:59] year to be a excellent Christian by all
[1:17:02] means necessary
[1:17:05] but you got to know that you got to make
[1:17:07] the choice you got to make the choice
[1:17:13] you got to make the choice remember
[1:17:17] every choice has consequences of rules
[1:17:19] but you got to make the choice if you
[1:17:22] want to be great the only great thing
[1:17:24] there is is the Holy Spirit
[1:17:26] ain't nothing greater than that but once
[1:17:30] you have it I'm telling it will change
[1:17:32] your life
[1:17:33] you don't gotta come and pretend to be a
[1:17:37] Christian pretend to be a believer
[1:17:42] pretend to be real but it's naturally
[1:17:44] inside of you it oozes out of your life
[1:17:48] even demons will be scared of you but
[1:17:55] sometimes us as the church we're more
[1:17:56] scared of demons and people are scared
[1:17:58] of us but that will change once you have
[1:18:02] the Holy Spirit God knows that we need
[1:18:07] help
[1:18:08] God knows that some of y'all here need a
[1:18:11] fresh experience with God some of y'all
[1:18:13] need a new experience or something I
[1:18:15] guys need a personal change and
[1:18:17] experience from them so don't leave this
[1:18:22] weekend don't leave this morning don't
[1:18:25] leave tonight without knowing that God I
[1:18:28] got to get closer to you God what the
[1:18:32] brother was saying I needed
[1:18:35] what the man was saying this morning
[1:18:37] Lord I know I needed I'm telling I'm not
[1:18:43] I don't want to be an average I don't
[1:18:45] want to just be a routine I want you to
[1:18:50] leave here this morning knowing that God
[1:18:52] spoke to you and you heated his calling
[1:18:54] that he will change at my church I don't
[1:18:59] need prayer calls the altar is in your
[1:19:03] heart you can pray standing up sitting
[1:19:06] down anywhere in your car going home but
[1:19:08] just make sure that you speak to God and
[1:19:10] find out what God wants you to be as
[1:19:15] brother Brooks come make sure that you
[1:19:19] got what you came to get for listen
[1:19:22] whatever that you need God has it but
[1:19:26] you got to make a choice you got to make
[1:19:29] a decision don't let your friends and
[1:19:32] don't even let your parents influence
[1:19:34] and make your true it is your choice
[1:19:35] God gave every man a choice
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:41] but you gotta choose Christ that's what
[1:19:45] I was hoping that you would do but I
[1:19:47] can't force you but if you choose Christ
[1:19:52] I'm telling you he will pay you in
[1:19:53] abundance come on but the Brooks God is
[1:19:58] the only person I will pay for every
[1:20:00] second of your life every choice that
[1:20:04] she made for him he will pay for you so
[1:20:08] that said don't don't leave because it's
[1:20:11] a regular and a regular service but you
[1:20:15] got to make your choice for yourself you
[1:20:20] got to know that if I want to be their
[1:20:24] Christian that God wants me to be then I
[1:20:25] need the Holy Spirit they know maybe I
[1:20:28] know tomorrow next week next year when I
[1:20:32] get older when I when I'd be 12 21 24 30
[1:20:35] you may not have that long so whatever
[1:20:40] you can't get Christ now in your life
[1:20:42] because he's the only person he's the
[1:20:45] either is the best thing that's for you
[1:20:50] as we all stand
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:56] check your life
[1:20:58] if you don't got it come get it you
[1:21:02] don't got to pretend you don't got a way
[1:21:05] for it to be a revival to go to you've
[1:21:07] can't go to a youth conference to go to
[1:21:09] a youth service down in a different
[1:21:11] country or a tent revival have the
[1:21:14] revival by yourself in your life right
[1:21:16] now but like I said again you got to
[1:21:20] make your choice we can't force them The
[1:21:22] ministers can't force the pastor can't
[1:21:24] force he would he would love to
[1:21:26] sometimes we would love to but we can't
[1:21:27] do it but if you make that real choice
[1:21:30] I'm telling you I promise you that the
[1:21:33] Holy Spirit is the best thing that you
[1:21:35] would ever need
[1:21:39] may God bless you

[1:25:43] take that what

[1:25:50] make a choice
[1:25:52] I may get shot oh they're mean
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:09] you know as out musicians continue to
[1:26:12] pray pray I just wanna say this morning
[1:26:18] a lot of times we look for the drama we
[1:26:23] look for the Hollywood scene before we
[1:26:25] can hit the door but after
[1:26:27] when I think about the way Jesus must
[1:26:30] have breached I think about how he spoke
[1:26:35] in such a sincere way I can see how his
[1:26:45] words may be in the way it wasn't you
[1:26:51] know his mission was that he came to
[1:27:04] save the Lost
[1:27:05] the gospel is impossible we greeted we
[1:27:09] throw it out so hope in and pull it back
[1:27:12] in and movie when we pull it back in we
[1:27:14] we may be trusting that when it comes
[1:27:17] back here we'll have fish sometimes when
[1:27:21] we pull that man in it it has other
[1:27:24] things but one thing about a fish it
[1:27:27] become a fish when it was caught in the
[1:27:31] net
[1:27:32] it was a fish before the mentee and the
[1:27:36] gospel of Jesus Christ kiss ha the word
[1:27:40] from God a word from heaven that
[1:27:42] actually talks to you cussing with
[1:27:47] you're not a Christian you know that
[1:27:50] you're supposed to be one when you have
[1:27:52] been predestinated one see that
[1:27:55] something ain't no only inside of you
[1:27:57] always tell you that you're different in
[1:28:01] the way of the world
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:06] you don't feel satisfying about it and
[1:28:10] there's always a pool there's always a
[1:28:12] guilty plea that you go through and what
[1:28:15] people fantasy is that God put that in
[1:28:18] you that's God so that when the preacher
[1:28:21] preached your responses he's calling you
[1:28:25] he's pulling of you because he's trying
[1:28:27] to clue you into the place where you
[1:28:30] belong I was born to be a Christian I
[1:28:33] enjoy being a Christian hallelujah
