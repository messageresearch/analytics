[0:13] we leave the meeting
[0:25] we commit ourselves the remainder of the
[0:28] service into thine hands
[0:32] to your glory and honor
[0:35] in the lovely name of jesus christ
[0:39] god's people said
[0:43] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[0:45] seated
[0:54] amen
[0:55] amen
[0:56] i would like to start this evening
[1:00] by quoting
[1:03] from
[1:04] the message of the hour
[1:08] from the message brother bannon preached
[1:14] when he started on the series of the
[1:16] seven church ages
[1:20] the first message in that series the
[1:24] premier
[1:25] dance series was the message he entitled
[1:28] the patmos vision
[1:32] now what i'll be reading tonight
[1:36] directly off the tape say
[1:38] from
[1:40] and brother branham addresses this
[1:42] scripture that we used as texts this
[1:44] evening
[1:51] and he says
[1:53] all right now
[1:54] in the spirit
[1:56] on the lord's day
[2:01] he says now remember the first thing you
[2:04] have to do is what
[2:12] [Music]
[2:20] going
[2:35] in the spirit
[2:37] get in the spirit
[2:42] so you see brother and sister
[2:45] we're not
[2:47] to
[2:48] wait till we get the holy ghost
[2:52] to get in the spirit
[2:57] of want
[2:58] we're to get in the spirit first
[3:11] when you were in this when you were as a
[3:14] sinner god wasn't your picture and you
[3:16] went to a dance okay
[3:19] party i didn't dance you got in that
[3:21] spirit position
[3:24] he says
[3:27] you started clapping your hands
[3:30] patting your
[3:43] when we come to the house of god
[3:47] that's why the lord ordained
[3:49] singing
[3:53] clapping our hands
[3:57] the purpose of that
[4:12] god
[4:26] that's why we do that
[4:29] it's not as a tradition
[4:33] it's not to be a ritual
[4:36] but we come to the house of god on
[4:39] purpose
[5:08] don't feel like it
[5:10] comes
[5:12] because if you came and you felt like it
[5:15] but
[5:17] where's the sacrifice
[5:20] sacrifice
[5:21] god knew
[5:23] god knew the battle
[5:26] he knew that satan
[5:29] would be against us
[5:33] so god said come
[5:36] and offer your sacrifice
[5:39] sacrifice amen so it's not based on
[5:42] whether we feel like
[5:45] you should say
[5:47] that we're a christian
[5:50] brother when you make that sacrifice
[5:53] sacrifice
[5:55] god honors it
[5:57] because he knows your heart
[6:00] he knows what your purpose is
[6:03] he knows what your desire
[6:31] that if you claim
[6:56] [Music]
[7:27] but we're all sons and daughters
[7:32] amen glory praise the lord
[7:38] i don't mind saying this
[7:42] i
[8:11] he said you
[8:14] go to the ball game
[8:20] somebody knocks a home run
[8:23] or
[8:24] a frappe
[8:28] and you say well i guess that was pretty
[8:30] good
[8:33] he said you wouldn't be a baseball fiend
[8:36] a baseball fan
[8:40] when somebody knocks a home run can't
[8:43] get cam for my uh
[8:45] frapple ball you raise up
[8:50] win
[8:52] knock somebody's hat off
[8:56] and nobody says a word about it
[9:02] brother sister
[9:04] we are
[9:05] jesus fan
[10:02] he said by the blood of jesus christ
[10:06] and the life that lived in him
[10:09] come back and live in me
[10:13] and along with that promise
[10:25] that certainly is worthy
[10:28] of an amen
[10:44] i want to
[10:46] take some things here
[10:54] brother branham said
[10:57] concerning
[10:58] this
[11:03] and
[11:04] i'll be reading
[11:06] some statements here from the message of
[11:08] the hour
[11:12] brother branham says
[11:16] he says god hasn't got any shortcuts
[11:25] you come by the cross
[11:29] born again
[11:32] filled with the holy ghost
[11:36] or you're gone
[11:39] you're lost
[11:53] a person
[11:55] cannot be born again until they have
[11:58] received the holy ghost
[12:03] you can't
[12:06] you are not even converted
[12:29] there is
[12:30] one work of grace
[12:32] yeah only one work of grace and that's
[12:35] the holy spirit
[12:39] and it's made in three manifestations
[12:45] he says there is three works of grace
[12:53] there is a manifestation of
[12:55] justification by manifestation
[13:00] a man believes god and says yes sir i
[13:02] believe
[13:14] i accept jesus christ
[13:17] his son as my personal
[13:30] and then the next stage your
[13:32] manifestation
[13:47] the baptism of the holy spirit
[13:50] he said those three
[13:51] things the torsos
[13:54] make up the new birth vote
[13:58] brother madam gave us a great example
[14:42] you're not going to use it
[14:45] it's full of dirt
[14:48] so then you take it in the house
[14:51] you wash it out
[14:54] you clean it up
[14:57] and then you set it aside for service
[15:02] and then you feel it
[15:04] and drink from it
[15:08] that
[15:09] is what constitutes a new birth
[15:15] now let's uh let's let's look at this
[15:19] i know this is simple
[15:22] but it's the word of god
[15:38] substitute
[15:40] for the holy ghost
[15:45] psychology is all right
[15:50] correct but it's
[15:51] no substitute for the holy spirit
[15:55] because brother sister
[15:57] the holy ghost is god's ordained way
[16:02] without it saul sent this please you've
[16:04] got to teach people
[16:19] a lot of things should i fix the book
[16:21] with this because now you must have got
[16:24] the nature of christ
[16:33] and the one that wrote
[16:44] amen
[16:46] amen
[16:48] glory
[16:51] brother branham
[16:54] he gave us a lot of information
[16:58] brother i believe today
[17:01] with what god has sent us by this
[17:04] messenger
[17:07] with these 1200 tapes
[17:12] without an excuse
[17:16] not to be born again
[17:22] amen
[17:25] praise the lord
[17:30] brother branham if you study through the
[17:33] message
[17:35] the number one word
[17:38] that he used to describe the new birth
[18:23] brother you are not sister going to get
[18:25] the holy ghost
[18:53] he says that's why so many it is
[18:57] try to dodge the new birth
[19:01] he said they want it classic
[19:06] they don't want it messy
[19:22] brother branham use the word squall
[19:28] squall
[19:30] it means a tearful screams girl
[19:37] he used the word ball
[19:39] it is useless
[19:40] he used the word flock
[19:44] flop stagger
[19:46] stagger screaming
[19:49] acting like a maniac
[19:53] these are the words
[19:59] he said i don't care
[20:02] if you flop like a chicken with his head
[20:10] [Music]
[20:18] the word
[20:21] snotting
[20:23] snotty snotting
[20:26] that's a runny nose
[20:32] that's how he described a new bird
[20:35] circumcised
[20:37] cheers
[20:42] streaming decree beating on an altar
[21:00] evil
[21:12] just to be in a holy ghost atmosphere
[21:18] which we've got to start somewhere
[21:22] that's why we worship the lord
[21:25] yeah
[21:28] years ago yeah
[21:30] i read an article
[21:34] in a scientific magazine
[21:41] magazine
[21:42] what caught was a actually called the
[21:44] national geographic uh
[21:47] uh
[21:48] and they had articles
[21:51] that was entitled the wars within
[21:54] uh
[22:11] he tied it to the children of israel
[22:13] getting over into canaan
[22:18] and although god promised him that land
[22:23] they had to fight forever
[22:51] it's a promise
[23:00] it was a study
[23:02] on our immune system
[23:06] system
[23:22] as i read the article
[23:28] they said
[23:30] that the reason that when you get sick
[23:40] the virus itself has no life in it
[23:44] it has to have a host that has to have
[23:46] another life to draw from
[24:44] is
[24:56] the cell looks
[24:57] healthy on the outside
[25:01] it can look inside
[25:04] and see if there's an infection
[25:09] and what it does
[25:12] it stops guessing let's send it to
[25:14] something reaches in it
[25:17] takes an antigen takes a piece of the
[25:19] virus
[25:22] and holds it out
[25:40] and they
[26:07] that immune system
[26:36] it's the
[26:37] immune response
[26:41] that brings on the fever
[26:45] it's not the virus
[26:48] it's the response
[26:50] of the
[27:04] but you're not
[27:32] is
[27:58] [Music]
[28:00] that god's word who can have power with
[28:02] you and drive out the enemies
[28:06] praise the lord benedict
[28:08] amen glory
[28:11] hallelujah
[28:26] brother madam said
[28:31] that you must
[28:33] be willing to die out
[28:35] of us
[28:37] what he said
[28:39] it's not enough just to come under the
[28:40] anointing
[28:41] of the lord
[28:48] but it's got to move
[28:50] from around us
[28:53] it's going to go past the
[28:55] bottom
[29:24] it's still the holy spirit doing the
[29:26] work
[29:29] but brother sister we've got to be
[29:31] filled
[29:34] with the holy ghost
[29:37] he said you've got to die out and rot
[29:43] out
[29:45] like an old potato
[29:47] but
[29:53] amen
[29:54] brother i've seen those you have two
[29:57] that can come into a meeting the holy
[29:59] spirit's moving
[30:06] where the freaky creed
[30:21] now
[30:24] i want to read something to you brother
[30:26] bannon said
[30:29] this is in the ephesian church age said
[30:35] brother bannon
[30:36] says here the true vine
[30:39] hated
[30:41] the formal deeds of the nicolaitans
[30:59] formal religion in religion former
[31:10] is no different than catholicism
[31:13] the catholicism
[31:22] there's a lot of things that
[31:24] god doesn't like
[31:29] a lot of things
[31:32] we've got the word of god
[31:35] that lets us know the mind of god you
[31:38] know
[31:39] without faith it's impossible
[31:42] for us to deficient faith
[31:44] by hearing
[31:58] now in
[32:01] serving god
[32:05] with all the things that we know god
[32:07] doesn't like
[32:11] okay
[32:12] you're gonna start
[32:33] [Music]
[32:40] the word formal
[32:43] formalism in the webster dictionary
[32:46] in the dictionary
[32:50] formal means
[32:52] stiff
[32:54] uh
[33:06] what do they call a dead person
[33:36] in order to be formal
[33:38] poetry
[33:40] you have to act formal
[33:43] fairly formalism
[33:46] so when we come to the house of god
[34:03] the bible
[34:04] says to show forth his praises
[34:11] the bible has the book of acts
[34:15] act the
[34:17] book of acts
[34:35] [Music]
[34:46] but
[35:11] hey man
[35:12] let me read something today
[35:27] in the message ephesian church age
[35:32] defense brother branham points out
[35:37] how that
[35:39] the church at ephesus
[35:41] commanders
[35:43] which
[35:44] this is the ephesian church age isis
[35:48] that god is addressing
[35:53] there in the book of revelation
[35:59] that of all of paul's churches
[36:04] of all of paul's churches
[36:08] church at ephesus was the
[36:11] what do most
[36:11] say
[36:15] he said that he could teach
[36:18] people first things to them
[36:23] then he could any of his other churches
[36:39] how that god complimented them
[36:46] he said i appreciate your labor
[36:50] your work
[36:56] how that you cannot bear those which are
[36:58] evil
[37:01] and you found those that say they are
[37:04] apostles to be liars it was a vessel
[37:18] they would compare what was being
[37:20] preached
[37:40] but the bible says
[37:43] after god complimented them
[37:47] for
[37:48] their many good ways
[37:54] he said i have someone against you
[37:59] he pointed out a direction they were
[38:01] taking
[38:18] you've held up for my name
[38:21] wouldn't that be just a
[38:24] good thing of this tabernacle today
[38:42] his followers says
[38:48] he said wouldn't this be a good thing
[38:50] for the tabernacle today
[38:54] you've had labor
[38:56] you've had words
[39:26] that you've
[39:40] you left the
[39:54] listen to
[40:06] for those good old-fashioned
[40:11] holy ghost meetings
[40:14] notice this ramekin
[40:16] this was a group
[40:19] that once had holy ghost meetings
[40:36] is
[40:49] that don't know what a holy ghost
[41:18] to let
[41:32] head on to say amen to the word of god
[41:36] not ashamed
[41:38] to say praise the lord the lord said
[41:40] you're unashamed to say glory to god
[41:43] the dead are jewish
[41:45] amen
[41:57] [Music]
[42:12] but what gets in the way
[42:47] because he packs
[42:49] the dirty name of holy roller
[42:54] he packs the dirty name of holy roller
[43:09] within our own message
[43:13] that pentecost
[43:15] has become a dirty word
[43:20] pentecost
[43:21] not a dirty word
[43:23] pentecost is
[43:34] to restore the pentecostal denominations
[44:06] it's
[44:13] these tapes will never make you afraid
[44:15] of the holy ghost
[44:19] how could malachi 4.
[44:23] make us afraid
[44:26] of the very experience the experience
[44:28] that he was ordained to take us back to
[44:33] restore us to the faith
[44:47] it has the same action
[44:52] in his children that is our fault praise
[44:55] the lord benefited
[44:57] amen
[44:59] amen
[45:02] he says
[45:05] you left that love
[45:08] that you once had
[45:10] for them good old-fashioned holy ghost
[45:12] meetings
[45:14] [Music]
[45:16] the
[45:17] and
[45:20] you're
[45:23] you've begun to kind of slide backwards
[45:26] into that formal
[45:58] [Music]
[46:00] brother sister when you're on fire for
[46:02] god
[46:04] there's a protection
[46:07] guard did you against the world
[46:11] but when you begin to
[46:42] he exposed their mistake
[46:47] and he said therefore repent
[46:51] that means you do something about it
[46:54] okay whatever
[47:08] god said repent
[47:19] go back to pentecost
[47:24] amen
[47:25] amen
[47:27] amen praise the lord venice
[47:31] don't you love the word of god
[47:38] i want to read this to you
[47:42] let me just check this watch
[47:46] brother
[47:49] brooks i
[47:50] honestly don't know when i started here
[47:52] so i'll i'll try to finish
[47:55] it
[47:56] i i understand brother brooks we'll be
[47:58] back sunday night
[48:03] dear pastor lets me come
[48:10] praise the lord listen to this
[48:14] brother quotes this scripture probably
[48:18] takes you
[48:21] and he says remember therefore he's
[48:24] quoting scripture here remember
[48:26] therefore from whence thou art fallen
[48:33] he says where did you come from
[48:37] from pentecost you fell down to where
[48:39] you are now back
[48:41] now
[48:43] and repent
[48:46] do thy first works
[48:50] he says go back to pentecost
[48:56] not to
[48:58] the denomination
[49:15] he got it
[49:16] justification
[49:19] was preached by luther 400 years ago
[49:24] we're way beyond that age
[49:28] then
[49:42] without
[50:06] let's let's rightly divide this word of
[50:10] truth look
[50:25] age
[50:26] and his message
[50:28] was without holiness
[50:30] you shall not see god
[50:33] sanctification
[50:34] sanctification the sanctification now
[50:37] brother sister men afraid we're
[50:53] amen take the next age
[50:56] the age of pentecost
[50:59] god restored the gifts
[51:01] the holy ghost
[51:03] back to the age
[51:06] oh
[51:20] we're in the
[51:35] without being first born in the family
[52:16] m
[52:57] than being born in the family
[53:02] when you're born in the family that
[53:04] makes you a son
[53:06] for me
[53:09] but not every son born in the family
[53:26] unless you were born in the family
[53:30] so brother sister
[53:31] we have much more to be responsible
[53:37] than just being born again
[53:40] over
[53:42] but you see brother sister by the way
[53:44] you cannot dodge the new birth
[53:47] no matter how far along in the age we
[53:50] are
[53:53] just like you can't dodge justification
[54:01] you must be born
[54:08] the experience is the same as it's
[54:11] always been experienced
[54:15] i'm closing for tonight
[54:19] but brother branham from adam
[54:22] he addressed as he said my dear catholic
[54:26] friends
[54:30] he said you claim mary the mother of god
[54:35] [Music]
[54:49] acting like a drug she will see coming
[54:52] from evil
[54:54] that's what he said the second idea
[54:58] that's what the messenger said
[55:01] she had to act
[55:04] married
[55:31] which is the last stage the seventh
[55:36] he addresses the scripture where jesus
[55:39] is standing at the door knocking
[55:41] repeat
[55:45] trying to get back into his own church
[55:50] now brother sister
[55:52] you can never have
[55:54] the holy ghost moving in the church to
[55:57] the people foreign
[56:14] never have revival in the church
[56:21] it's got to start somewhere
[56:24] in the individual's heart
[56:28] gentiles
[56:55] standing outside of his own
[57:23] with pentecost
[57:36] here's what he says
[58:06] brother let's
[58:20] i've
[58:32] [Music]
[58:34] brother
[58:48] look
[59:30] that they did
[59:43] brother sister why would we take a
[59:45] substitute
[59:46] [Music]
[59:48] when we've got the real
[59:50] question
[59:54] he said my dear catholic friends my
[59:56] catholic friend
[59:58] catholic the virgin mary being the
[1:00:01] mother of jesus christ
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:06] had to go up to pentecost
[1:00:09] and be filled with the holy ghost
[1:00:12] and she acted like a drunk
[1:00:14] she come in in person evil she was
[1:00:17] amongst 120.
[1:00:20] had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:23] speaking in tongues
[1:00:25] and acting like a drunk woman coming
[1:00:28] from under the spirit of god
[1:00:31] and if the virgin mary
[1:00:34] had to do that in order to get into
[1:00:36] glory
[1:00:40] how are you
[1:01:08] i care what
[1:01:20] praise the lord
