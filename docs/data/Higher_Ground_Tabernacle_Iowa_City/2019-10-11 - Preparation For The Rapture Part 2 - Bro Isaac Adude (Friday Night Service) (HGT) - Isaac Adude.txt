sermon last Friday when I come on sis it's pretty concerned I didn't know that you would check miss it would take another Friday to finish it or I didn't know it would take another Friday to continue the same but the grace of God we said the foundation last Friday epilogue our students are on battle-ax foundation and by His grace will continue and the way will lead us a pastor class because we just depending on anybody on the leading of the Holy Spirit we show last Friday that things had to be happened or to be done the message that God gave Moses hello mr. Scrooge mo to tell the platoon of Israel what to do before going out of agent the deal was orphan Israel fell upon the Sociology because he was going to judge age him asked in a new jersey he was going to smile Egypt in a little Egypt it was going to kill all the firstborn as we read man and beast madam yeah and he was going to kill them but the the words there were certain people children who who needed to be saved who couldn't have the same judgment with the other you know and they had those people had to be had to do certain thing it was only certain shoes you know to keep them from that hooligan and then it was that time that I denied that they had to go out of it you told us it's no children and the Prophet said that God before sending a God in the time of Moses sent two or three things hello confetti dick go to the movies on Weight Watchers you know to tell them three things to prepare them was pudding kappa he said the first thing he said was a prophet let you know from your shoes you don't worry uncle faith was moses a prophet with a message the second thing is saying was the pillar of fire to identify the message of the prophet do some shusuke long waist it ela : do fuku I don't and the third thing is st. was de but the third day they descended and the third thing was together talking was him so scale of a tendency was the message of Moses and in this last day in this last day that will ever know Sweetland on the King movie we found out that God also has sent us those three things that send us a prophet Judah saw an improvement even decayed his message with the pillar of fire in our confirming so Minister of Economy food and he gave us the talking you Lucy and if you go read the message the talk and you will see a sympathy Leo listens to silver that the Prophet said that the message of the hour of this evening time is the token color poetically mistletoe necessarily see ya God send us those three things we Jews always it was shoes so now the third was the token every wavelet was him shoes you see the the first three things that I mean that the three things that was God doing or God preparing his children or sent your gods preparing the first three things that we just see name was what would that was God's part did one from your shoes candidly a statistical Judah and the people also add something to do manly Joseph the people also have their own part to accomplish envelope or party are complete I sent the Prophet General when he gave him a message you know how to do miss you indicated his message is a confirming some with wonders and miracles effective would easily be done you know with signs advocacy your with the pill fire you know or even the natural no knew that there was a profit on earth remember now Joseph eventful fetch Allah and then he sent that profit with the message that was the talking you know well so makes a profit I become a such key to Lucy and telling us what we have to do in duty so you know is did the Prophet reminded us what God has done for us happily he told us that God is key God has chosen a lamb you said you could Jewish was a new he told us that God has killed the lamb he said you could watch each other that the lamb has been tested in radical annuity he told us that he told us that the blood has been shed in radical Toyota versus and it's turning out now the message is to apply the blood that was shed in only massage with a particular so cute offensive and that was the talking he said tell you see because one thing is that when that time we come god we only got only requires they're talking masculine shows like a concert or en la jeune exudes courtesy you know nothing else but they're talking doses courtesy you know the devil now nowadays is now try not to create some sublet you know you could do create some substitute men only the case advances you know trying to lie the people the bride of cross that there is another thing that can replace that you notice it reduces Amonte boost you know he's sending people telling them that there's another thing that can replace that token machine but you know there is nothing that can replace that you know the only thing that that requires in what God wants is the token there's our live shows culture exists Allah sees is the life of Christ you know that's the purchased of his they just to prove that yes Barbara protesters you know that's the only thing that we are going to show him sailor suit comes on remotely nothing else you go to now the devil is coming trying to tell the people that come into church is me coming to church or that's the only thing that I see Rose manolio job you know coming to church it's good but you have to have something inside of you you know coming to church is good but you have to meet that God personally should you anymore you know believe in a message is good but you have to make that the inner God personally once we massage the area honk until you do person because we say believing the message is the Holy Spirit yes so they could koala misogynist entity we but we have to know what is believing the message about you know believing the message doesn't mean to be a church member koala missus we party like my mama do you know you just come to church and sit there and provide saying that you believe in a message introducing whether will suit us why you decode your pocket Alamos out you conquer town or sentence free no that's not it no so you person do you believe in their message and you act and you do everything that a message is saying well let me say I feel it feels to school Amin says do you think and that's even the proof that you have the Holy Spirit's other proves evolution you know you will love your neighbor people to watch yeah we love your brothers that am able to fight if you don't do those things it's even fake purses shoes but you just come in a church and hoping that if the rapture takes place now that you will go is Priscilla left movement no with any party you know but it's like you losing your time cause you will stake she comes to tapas alienation you know cause the only thing that is required was the is the Holy Spirit it's gonna surskit exactly and we saw that last time that the lamb had to be taken particular new territory they left the lamb had to be checked dilemma to make the requirement I knew to be they had to keep the lamb till and you or four days cause we read the lamb was beat it was going to be taken the tenth day of the mount and be killed the fourteenth days pass on a vehicle and you develop realities my advocate awesome and then they had to kill the lamb and if you go to verse 46 you will notice that when they were killing the lab no bones will be broken it comes on Machiavelli conversation you can use it on to the tree line you who kun oh okay no divert oh yeah and then there to apply the blood hey Luke you lose Lucy you know where they work go where they left where the lamb was eaten the blood should be applied lovely so eighty it la nuit americaine and we said that you know it's it's like when we read the Word of God you can lean upon the tree you know when we meditate the Word of God comedy juniper only if we only read the Word of God just for the sake of the knowledge and hoping that the blood of Christ or the order the Holy Spirit will be implied applied in our souls that will not happen because the Bible says that you know you will apply the blood where the lamb will be eaten vascular Lola you show emotion you know where the lambie's is being eaten that's where the blood should be applied to the Tomasello loosen topic and they had to eat they dare to eat the flesh a dream until I share they had to roast it with fire you had to dress up you dress up they dare to take that the leavened 11 bread and we see that we saw that you know the lamb represented Christ on a vehicle I knew her present Chris and Christ was also checked Christos it when you went to Pilate echoing I live a happy life you know they were asking him questions while we are to model the kiss you know when for him to give an answer that will condemn himself they didn't find anything any bad thing in him may know they didn't find anything that condemned him you know shows critic on the cross he was hauling vasculitis and I learned that the Lamb who was Jesus cross was checked he said he was kept because the Bible says that Jesus Christ was taken and he came out just after the resurrection reliability Christa a deeply religious television at you yeah it was kept you did take out this and then he was killed they are pretty true that day on Calvary to Jacques as well they kill them when I true that evening well it was killed due to tree and now the thing is now is that with the hand out to apply the blood I mean honestly fake we develop liquor Lucy and the lamb was killed near 83 everything was done to chose it and now we need to apply the blood you know to a particular see we learn the LA last Friday that you know God had to do those first part taking the lamp killing the lab when I appear on the deepest of Judea see premiere party upon I knew it you know and then we as children we had just to apply the blood new calmly that was the only thing that we were required to do there are social community because in Exodus chapter 12 the lamb was going to be taken by the dadada fathers don't exhaust a little dude like new developer only pair the father had to care to check the lamb repaired with beautiful on you and the children had to make sure that the blood was applied Elizondo so that's really cool blue soybean it is the same thing today that we have to make sure that the blood is applied and then we will show last Friday we saw that we saw that Jesus put the lamb and the lamb was without blemish new la nuit is on blonde and we are now today we are now going to keep on with the killing the lamb continue avec la you know to see in the vert in the Bible where you know what the Bible says about it and I said last Friday and I will repeat it again de you will have to bear with me you know because we we have so we have many our Bible readings so let's turn our Bible in the first Exodus chapter 12 verse 6 News vs. the Bible says and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall carry in the evening we look after a juice Coca told him Jude assume what a toothless omelet Israel the moon rock on Quora du soir and if we go to the New Testament the New Testament we we see that in John 12:24 what also dude rocket let's turn there real quick a lot of zones a bit reduced even cut let's start from verse 23 the Bible says and jesus answered them saying the hour is come die the son of man should be glorified logical topology well if you verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if we die it bringeth forth much fruit on virility silicon the Blake you told me on to tell número you - discern this verse was talking about Jesus himself telling us that you know for a tree or or a corn of wheat to bring forth fruit he had to die look on the blip or movie and Jesus Christ to bring more forth fruit we reinforced by merit Jesus that Miss Jesus today he had to die this is a crystal porn movie because he died - he died and when he died is setting back his spirit vascular mark only more long ways from universities you know to be or to be in every man's soul donated or lamb do suck on to bring the same fruit that he brought you know to have the same life that he did that he had you know to do the same work that it did that he did and to be you know to be a said to be written a Pistols that will be born so he had to die to bring forth much fruit I like blues to food because if we didn't die we would not even have the remission of our sins vicinity Palmer or not that's why Jesus cry had to die so that's what the lamb had to be killed suppose loculi new territory if we go again to Hebrews chapter 9 verse 19 to 28 feet without 25 to 28 know yet that know yet that he should offer himself oh I know yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with with blood of others as any papal so feel remain pleasure luckily Andre calmly Sudan certificate for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice by the sacrifice of himself Ultimo you know if I used to feel pleasure for the predication revolt don't Iike mad no and I found this yet in a parable and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment you community they believe in self well so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many the man kissed he said to fair Jim self and not to them that that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation a parrot so peaceful so here the Bible is talking about Jesus Christ he's saying that you know the the Lamb that was killed in the Old Testament was the the type of Jesus Christ the Liberal Party sister Jacqueline knew kitty emolia on sentimentality pleasure and the chief priests had to come with the blood of many lambs to kill the blood the blood was going to come once a year coming with the blood of many lambs will ania killing many many lamps for people who stood up yeah because people were bringing their own names in there in the temple you know too big care for them for for for their for their scenes for everything that I have done to be killed the lamb was going to be killed to take to take their places and nothing was going what was repeating every year but here the Bible is saying that Jesus died one time to bear the sin of every man you know to take the sin of the entire world of them that believed him the circular quoi you know of them that believed Jesus Sookie kwanghee's Ruth and that does the purpose that Jesus died and then they had to apply the blood but before applying the blood they had to make sure about one thing you know they had to take the leaven out of the day they are their house 11 Dunamis or you know they had to take the leaven out of their house because the barbers tell them that to keep that there for seven days that level should not be in the house and the leaven represents sin and for seven days they could they did a heavy and the prophet said that this seven days means the seven Church ages throughout the street who travel the city literally vandal repair totally real you know the leaven should be keep there to be care or I should be out Alex tell that you eat the bread unleavened unleavened you should eat the unleavened bread you the memos and we saw last time that lived 11 is something that is not sincere and sincerity is something really important for God even the Prophet for him to to to to to to to to to stand against the devil or to bind the serpent he had to be sincere man full of faith for 20 of the early when we are something new god we have to be sincere and now the Bible is saying that sincerity was to be kept throughout the seven churches and now we saw that when their windows that the first churches that are from the first church to the sea to the sixth church another one kilometers degrees they all started well you ought to see oh come on say you know with they kept the leaven out but at the end of every edges you know that they they put the lever in Honolulu even you know they break denomination that word that they broke Creed's you saw me the cradle they brought any kind of stuff you know but the prophets say that you know this this age you don't see this last aged eleven should be kept out Louisville and and that's the edge that will bring us to the rapture and the leaven should be the leaven is not tolerated meaning that sin is not tolerated no matter how lido it is you know no matter how it seems you know I can you know I can just sleep and forget about it Pokemon's awesome location it is not tolerated salon new party you know in order for you to make the rapture you know you have to take the leaven out you know when I'm saying that yeah I see our sin is not tolerated even the leader one has to be confessed because of the Confessor you know try to see that the story of the of the after that the legend the demand so it's olive leaves leaves you you know that man who had many demons inside of him Satan caveat when we read the Bible we see that sometimes we think that you know that man was born with many demons by the Prophet was so deep to explain to us how it happened that he became to in that state you know he said he was a kind man a Christian going to church you know he had a good parents he had good wife he had children he was a good fathers for a good father for his children book you know we're all every type in his post of duty sexuality also posted you know he was working hard for his children he was working hard for his family travel Joseph a my one thing that he was a didn't realized that he had a buzz surrounding kinematical a bad surrounding in a movie over one mo you know he had bad friends he'll a very odd the movies I mean and times after time these friends were telling him you know why don't you come in and take our like one drink one cup of a beer you know he was saying that you know III don't drink beer you know I'm a Christian I don't drink beers right instead of separating himself from disparate people or you you know he kept on being with them being with him he's a you know guy talk are living with them and time after time those people were repeating the same thing you know why don't you why don't you come and drink with us and one day is saying that we said that you know yeah I'll come today bar when I drink I would just you know sit with you talk with you another day he came again he did the same thing the next day the following day did the same place and then one day he said that white white let me try just a cup of beer and the Prophet said that the first time it took the cup of beer any drink that was the first day of okay man hello fellow judaculla Palmilla Palmilla Coupe de aquila Petoskey Blacula ta-da-da-da-da-dah you know he came again and he drank again the second one was the second and those demons came deputy that they invited their friends and they invited in friends they found them they found in him an empty place he told us a meal and the Jordan became a legend he leaves you and and then and then all of a sudden a that the man became so rude to tell me the man became savage Sauvage you know coming going back to his house they are beating his wife local Amazon comments of Appeals affirmed you know beating his children pieces on phone you know being a misbehaving Bhutto you know so and by the end of the by the end of the day you know he went to leave where we're dead people were yeah a party you know you you know why because at the first at the beginning it didn't take Delta the sin seriously was a passcode arena pop he'll appreciate series mo and that's the consequence when we don't take sin seriously when we don't confess our sins confess open OPC hoping that you know we come to church and you know another devil plus you know that they seen my brother will forget about it and we we will you know be again friends but we didn't forget it I'm sorry but we forget it but we didn't confess it when a pal confusion that demon demo we're coming getting invited again another one you will invite again then you see people become cold values of theirs church but they're nobody's in there kruseman your personality you know people are taking care of other stuff Haley's also people to show you know people not loving their fur that they their brothers and sisters really the joking improving of and where we think we're seeing their

inside of him if the comments are going to you you know manifesting adafruit's that's why we see divisions division thats why we see you know this brother is not talking the other brother you know that's why we seek gossip you know that's why we see that this sister is not talking in the other sister as we get close to the end you know we see the signs you know we see the climate you know as everything is is going so bad moving you know we see that the earth the earthquake and other stuff you know signs everywhere / - we see wars and rumors of wars well again you know telling us that we are at the end time telling us that it is not time to play you know telling us that you know this time is time to be serious - Lucas you know telling us that it is time it is time to prepare ourselves to through total nuclear power and then to prepare ourselves we have to make sure that our lives is right yeah because there were to eat the unleavened bread because the lamb was wholly past cool and you it is son Jesus is holy He gave His life is life is holy his blood is holy so show it soon and the people that needs to attack dog line and apply they have to be all the holy so those who saw inapplicable son you know the blood should not be applied on any kind of any kinds of doors who's available so that the vapor symmetrical in a podcast or with any kinds of you know any kind of way of the facility they had a parade ahead are a way to apply the blood of the particular that was required by the messenger it takes the problem is Debra wants to be applied on the doorpost and on the lentil your blood application to the Laporte issue doorpost poster teleport only potato peeler okay yet that's where the blood had to be applied nowhere else and godsend again debris messenger or this last time any taste telling us that the blood needs to be applied in our souls we have to circumcise ourselves with the holy spirit you know taking out that the surplus you know cutting off that the flesh the remaining fresh you know cutting of the scene you know circumcised in our souls you know and in the end that's that that's what the messenger is telling us you know it's telling us that you know that's the thing that we have to do we are in the end time you know we see we seen things coming the way all these shows are available and now what the devil is doing now the minosa Calogero say

pulpits don't least gonna share everywhere you know trying to kill people spiritual people will come to church people we still come to church to contribute but they will not know that they are already dead man you saw package so these are more but now we have to be so we have to be we have to pay close attention because the Bible is telling us the enterprise will not be anywhere else it will be in the church and in the church and kill people don't really you know China bring people out of the way and now the devil is right now to get into our children also may know the job cause he knows that taking the children the mind of the children basket circle blood well opposed it is awful you know he's getting everything because their minds that what operates in their body is a loser you know if
