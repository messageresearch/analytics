[56:28] and he came thither unto a cave and
[56:32] large there and behold the word of the
[56:35] Lord came to him and he said unto him
[56:39] what Dost thou hear
[56:53] Elijah
[57:11] and he said I have been very jealous for
[57:14] the Lord God of
[57:16] host for the children of Israel have
[57:19] forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine
[57:22] altar slain thy Prophets with the sword
[57:26] and I even I only am left and they seek
[57:30] my life to take it
[57:53] away
[57:56] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[58:00] mount before the Lord and behold the
[58:04] Lord passed by and a great storm strong
[58:08] wind rent the mountains and break it in
[58:12] pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the
[58:16] Lord was not in the wind and after the
[58:19] wind an
[58:21] earthquake but the Lord was not in the
[58:24] earthquake
[58:25] and after the earthquake a fire but the
[58:28] Lord was not in the fire and after the
[58:32] fire a still small
[58:53] voice
[59:11] for and it was so when Elijah heard it
[59:18] that he wrapped his face in his mantle
[59:20] and went out and stood in the entering
[59:24] in of the cave and behold there came a
[59:28] voice unto him and said what do what do
[59:33] thou he
[59:53] El let us pray our gracious father God

[1:00:25] word and against your people Lord in
[1:00:29] your name Jesus Christ we surrender the
[1:00:32] service into your hands let that perfect
[1:00:34] Divine will be done in Jesus Christ name
[1:00:38] we pray amen amen you may be
[1:00:45] seated my thought this
[1:00:49] morning actually came from the
[1:00:52] message what doest thou
[1:00:55] here
[1:00:59] brother
[1:01:09] 19591 anyhow we know that the Lord is uh
[1:01:13] doing
[1:01:16] something and with all of the things
[1:01:19] that are occurring in the
[1:01:23] world if we're not careful we be uh
[1:01:30] distracted uh when God call us to this
[1:01:37] message he knew that all of the things
[1:01:40] that are occurring would
[1:01:44] occur but if you can
[1:01:47] remember the preview of the
[1:01:52] Bride her f face were set like a
[1:01:58] flint she kept her eyes on Jesus
[1:02:04] or on the cross of
[1:02:07] Jesus and she was marching to the tune
[1:02:10] of the
[1:02:12] word the moment she began to look
[1:02:16] around the moment she was
[1:02:20] distracted uh she left and she lost her
[1:02:23] step
[1:02:26] hallelujah amen and if you could
[1:02:28] remember the prophet of God was
[1:02:32] screaming stay in
[1:02:34] line get in line stay in
[1:02:37] line Hallelujah am and then the vision
[1:02:41] left
[1:02:43] him I I would like to encourage
[1:02:47] you to listen to that
[1:02:50] message it is a it is a powerful message
[1:02:54] in the depth of this
[1:02:56] message it is not just talking about
[1:03:00] Jezebel and
[1:03:03] Ahab but it is a
[1:03:07] scene telling us about
[1:03:10] Elijah it is a
[1:03:13] scene telling us about
[1:03:16] Elijah and what he had to go
[1:03:19] through Hallelujah during this time of
[1:03:23] crisis
[1:03:25] you say it was a time of
[1:03:27] Crisis absolutely it was a time when the
[1:03:31] storms were
[1:03:34] raging the squeeze and the pressure was
[1:03:37] on the
[1:03:40] church Jezebel had uh sworn that she
[1:03:44] would kill prophets 400 I
[1:03:48] believe Hallelujah she has swore to
[1:03:52] herself that he would kill
[1:03:56] Elijah and Elijah was in a
[1:04:00] position where he felt all
[1:04:04] alone and and he felt
[1:04:09] deserted but God comforted
[1:04:12] him and said unto him I have
[1:04:20] 7,000 that have not bowed their knees to
[1:04:23] bail
[1:04:26] Hallelujah you know history repeats
[1:04:30] itself but before I go any
[1:04:33] further I want you to understand what
[1:04:35] the
[1:04:36] gospel of Elijah
[1:04:40] did the gospel of
[1:04:43] Elijah placed a judgment on
[1:04:46] Jezebel and plac the judgment on
[1:04:50] Ahab and God said to Ahab that he would
[1:04:55] take his
[1:04:56] life and God said to
[1:04:58] Jezebel that the dogs would lick your
[1:05:02] blood Hallelujah so I want you to know
[1:05:05] this
[1:05:06] morning that the spirit of
[1:05:09] Ahab is still
[1:05:12] alive and the spirit of
[1:05:15] Jezebel is still
[1:05:17] alive Ahab was a
[1:05:20] compromiser
[1:05:22] Hallelujah he allowed
[1:05:25] Jezebel to bring
[1:05:28] Israel into
[1:05:30] idolatry Hallelujah but we had a voice
[1:05:33] in the land we had an Elijah in the land
[1:05:38] and brother Bram said it like this even
[1:05:41] though Jezebel hated
[1:05:44] Elijah Hallelujah Elijah was Jezebel's
[1:05:48] Pastor Hallelujah you see it doesn't
[1:05:52] matter if the whole world hate this
[1:05:56] message Hallelujah
[1:05:59] Elijah is still the
[1:06:02] pastor Hallelujah and you and I must
[1:06:06] recognize that
[1:06:07] Elijah was not a
[1:06:10] compromiser Hallelujah he had to stand
[1:06:13] against
[1:06:14] Israel he had to stand against Ahab he
[1:06:18] had to stand against
[1:06:20] Jezebel Hallelujah and it took its all
[1:06:24] on
[1:06:27] him hallelujah amen coming from the
[1:06:31] message hallelujah what doest thou
[1:06:35] here hallelujah beginning at paragraph
[1:06:39] 30 brother vom says Elijah had a hard
[1:06:47] day he had been on Mount
[1:06:50] Carmel and he had seen the glory of the
[1:06:53] Lord comeing come
[1:06:55] down he had prayed for fire of the
[1:06:59] heavens and then prayed for rain down
[1:07:02] upon the
[1:07:04] Earth and and under all of this
[1:07:08] strain his nerves was about
[1:07:12] Broken Oh how can I I can feel for
[1:07:17] him Hallelujah and here we find him
[1:07:22] first preaching to a backsliding nation
[1:07:25] of
[1:07:27] people and to Jezebel that wanted her
[1:07:32] way and to Jezebel that wanted her way
[1:07:36] and the people had to come to a place
[1:07:40] that they had forsaken
[1:07:43] God forsook all of his
[1:07:46] promises and all of his
[1:07:48] Commandments and no longer kept his
[1:07:52] statue nothing for him Hallelujah and
[1:07:58] Elijah in the midst of all of it he
[1:08:01] could not
[1:08:03] compromise he had to stand true to his
[1:08:07] conviction hallelujah oh how that
[1:08:10] reflects in this day let me just pause a
[1:08:14] moment because we have the message of
[1:08:17] Elijah and therefore we cannot be
[1:08:21] compromisers Hallelujah you might not
[1:08:24] understand it but a little leavens leav
[1:08:27] the whole
[1:08:28] lot you can allow sin to come in the
[1:08:31] camp and before you know it it's going
[1:08:34] to affect
[1:08:36] everybody Hallelujah I don't care about
[1:08:40] friendship I don't care if nobody loves
[1:08:43] me but one thing I do care
[1:08:46] about on whether or not he loves me
[1:08:50] Hallelujah my aim this morning
[1:08:54] it's not to
[1:08:57] preach hallelujah amen to make you
[1:09:00] happy my this morning is a
[1:09:05] preach hoping that one day you will
[1:09:10] change Hallelujah see we allow too many
[1:09:15] things to go
[1:09:18] unchecked we allow too many things to go
[1:09:22] unchecked
[1:09:26] Hallelujah that's not the way of a real
[1:09:30] believer Hallelujah and the reason why
[1:09:33] we do it because we don't have the
[1:09:37] love one for the other Hallelujah that's
[1:09:41] right because if you love one another
[1:09:45] you will be a keeper of one
[1:09:47] another Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:09:51] saying what see you what is it that you
[1:09:56] see I want you to look into your heart
[1:09:59] and tell me what do you
[1:10:03] see what's going on in your
[1:10:06] life hallelujah amen I want to say
[1:10:10] something here this morning but I don't
[1:10:12] want to jump ahead of
[1:10:15] myself but I will say
[1:10:18] this what this message came to
[1:10:22] do to give us a greater
[1:10:26] experience with
[1:10:28] God a greater
[1:10:31] experience with with God than what the
[1:10:33] Pentecostal era
[1:10:36] did Hallelujah y'all better hear what
[1:10:39] I'm
[1:10:40] saying this message is a deep
[1:10:43] message but we fail to
[1:10:47] see how deep it really
[1:10:50] is hallelujah you can understand
[1:10:53] understand all
[1:10:55] Mysteries Hallelujah but the Bible says
[1:10:59] if you don't have
[1:11:01] charity if you don't have
[1:11:03] love your so-called
[1:11:07] deepness is not deep at
[1:11:09] all Hallelujah because when you when
[1:11:13] love of God is in your heart that's what
[1:11:17] we call
[1:11:20] Deep why because love of God passes all
[1:11:28] understanding Hallelujah no intellectual
[1:11:31] person can teach
[1:11:33] you how to love the way God wants you to
[1:11:36] love y'all better hear me and I want you
[1:11:39] to understand that's what God calls
[1:11:43] deep
[1:11:45] hallelujah it's not how elegant I can
[1:11:49] speak Hallelujah it doesn't matter how
[1:11:52] good my grandma
[1:11:54] is but the ability to allow the Holy
[1:11:58] Ghost to speak through me to you that's
[1:12:03] what you call
[1:12:06] Deep hallelujah amen being able to move
[1:12:10] out of his way so that he can speak to
[1:12:13] your
[1:12:14] heart Hallelujah because brother Brooks
[1:12:17] can't change
[1:12:19] you you cannot change you the only
[1:12:23] person that can change you is Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ
[1:12:28] himself no man can add a CU to your
[1:12:32] statute Hallelujah it is the master
[1:12:36] builder Jesus Christ is the master
[1:12:42] builder we are the pter he is the pter
[1:12:47] he is the poter and we are the
[1:12:51] CL Hallelujah amen see we I keep saying
[1:12:56] these
[1:12:57] things cuz the message can you cannot
[1:13:00] allow you
[1:13:04] experience
[1:13:06] Hallelujah to become a what we call it
[1:13:13] systematic just a
[1:13:15] habit the way we do things Hallelujah
[1:13:20] God hates
[1:13:22] that amen hallelujah amen it's like
[1:13:27] communion we have communion when we do
[1:13:31] but communion is a sacred
[1:13:34] thing if you take
[1:13:36] communion because you say I'm supposed
[1:13:38] to take
[1:13:40] it God hates that it's just a system to
[1:13:46] you just a law laid out for
[1:13:49] you but communion is supposed to be
[1:13:52] approach in
[1:13:54] Holiness in
[1:13:57] reverence in
[1:13:59] respect in Divine
[1:14:01] love remembering what he did for
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:07] yesterday and remembering what he's
[1:14:09] doing for
[1:14:13] youday hallelujah amen let me move on in
[1:14:17] this quote and they had a queen
[1:14:21] here in the quote
[1:14:28] 32nd and they had a queen there by the
[1:14:32] name of
[1:14:33] Jezebel and she had led all the children
[1:14:35] of Israel
[1:14:37] astray with her and fantastic way of
[1:14:42] living she CA them to commit
[1:14:47] fornication and to do evil
[1:14:50] things if that isn't good parallel to to
[1:14:57] today Hallelujah brother said that
[1:15:00] parallels
[1:15:02] today me say like this if there be a
[1:15:06] fornicator among you and you allow that
[1:15:09] fornicator to remain that spirit is
[1:15:13] going to jump on somebody
[1:15:15] else hallelujah amen and from there it's
[1:15:18] going to keep going like a
[1:15:22] wildfire before you know it the church
[1:15:25] will be
[1:15:27] corrupt hallelujah amen that's why the
[1:15:30] church is
[1:15:31] here hallelujah to separate ourselves
[1:15:35] from all
[1:15:37] unbelief I don't care who it
[1:15:43] is and if you know somebody doing stuff
[1:15:46] like that and you don't make it
[1:15:50] known you are as guilty as they
[1:15:56] are
[1:15:59] am Hallelujah I didn't come to make you
[1:16:02] shout this morning but I want you to
[1:16:05] listen to what I'm trying to
[1:16:07] say because you say you know brother
[1:16:10] Bram is a prophet do not guarantee you
[1:16:13] in the
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] Rapture hallelujah amen you can quote
[1:16:21] every
[1:16:22] scripture you can quote every message
[1:16:26] book and that do not guarantee
[1:16:30] you hallelujah amen hey but the Bible
[1:16:34] says if that same
[1:16:37] spirit that was in Christ
[1:16:40] Jesus if it be in your moral
[1:16:44] body it will Quicken you what are you
[1:16:48] saying brother Brooks you can have all
[1:16:51] of these things I'm going to read it
[1:16:53] and you don't have the Holy
[1:16:55] Ghost say well brother Brooks people say
[1:16:59] well brother
[1:17:00] Brooks you could have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:03] every day of your
[1:17:05] life and still go to
[1:17:09] hell I'm not talking about the Holy
[1:17:11] Ghost on your
[1:17:12] spirit I'm not talking about the Holy
[1:17:14] Ghost on your
[1:17:16] flesh I'm going deeper than that when
[1:17:19] the Holy Ghost is in your soul there is
[1:17:23] no way you could be
[1:17:26] lost hallelujah amen because the holy
[1:17:29] ghost in your
[1:17:31] soul is God's
[1:17:36] approval oh let me hurry up amen
[1:17:39] hallelujah I'm being taken somewhere
[1:17:40] else 33rd verse I mean uh uh
[1:17:45] uh amen but
[1:17:48] Elijah in the midst of it all yet many
[1:17:51] of the children of Israel
[1:17:55] of had done what
[1:17:58] compromise and wanted to live the Modern
[1:18:01] Trend of
[1:18:04] Life hallelujah amen yet Elijah would
[1:18:08] not
[1:18:10] compromise you know
[1:18:13] amazing because even when I preach on
[1:18:15] things that that you know that Holiness
[1:18:18] people shouldn't be uh a wearing oh
[1:18:23] we get this funny
[1:18:26] response and if you can't say
[1:18:29] Amen if you can't say
[1:18:32] Amen to the things I say that brother
[1:18:35] Bram has
[1:18:37] said then you are
[1:18:42] compromis that's it this is not my
[1:18:46] message it's his
[1:18:48] message and I'm just repeating what he
[1:18:51] said
[1:18:54] hallelujah amen but we think because
[1:18:59] everybody come listen it's not about
[1:19:02] having a big
[1:19:04] church Hallelujah you can have a church
[1:19:07] full of
[1:19:09] people and all of them still could be
[1:19:13] Devils it's not in the
[1:19:16] number that's not what God looks
[1:19:20] at hey it's a Catholic Church
[1:19:23] the Catholic church has more numbers
[1:19:26] than
[1:19:27] anybody Hallelujah so that does not make
[1:19:30] it
[1:19:32] right this is what makes it right fear
[1:19:36] not little
[1:19:40] flock fear not little
[1:19:42] flock it is a father's good
[1:19:45] pleasure to give you the
[1:19:51] kingdom amen
[1:19:53] he told
[1:19:54] Jezebel her place Elijah did now he
[1:19:59] wouldn't compromise and he told Jezebel
[1:20:02] her place and how she she must

[1:23:54] paragraph he said oh there's a lot of
[1:23:58] times they don't want to claim
[1:24:01] it but a God sent man to a
[1:24:06] community is a pastor of the entire
[1:24:10] Community whether he he be
[1:24:13] baptized
[1:24:14] Presbyterian or who he is God anoints
[1:24:19] his
[1:24:19] man and he will not comp
[1:24:23] romise that people sometimes hate

[1:24:30] truth but but yet he's God Pastor for
[1:24:33] the
[1:24:34] hour Hallelujah 35th verse Oh She
[1:24:38] despise

[1:24:42] kill
[1:24:44] him yet he was true to God's principles
[1:24:48] and God's
[1:24:50] standards and what we we know we can't
[1:24:53] kill the man but we kill the man
[1:24:56] influence our
[1:24:58] Tong Hallelujah am yes sir that's what
[1:25:03] we
[1:25:08] do some of y'all wouldn't have even
[1:25:10] allowed Jesus to be your
[1:25:15] pastor because he didn't come to your
[1:25:17] church every
[1:25:19] day he was going he was led go wherever
[1:25:23] he was led to
[1:25:25] go y'all that ain't script yes it is
[1:25:29] Mary and Martha says
[1:25:31] Lord you should have been
[1:25:35] here had you been
[1:25:37] here is that right my my brother would
[1:25:41] not have
[1:25:43] died where was Jesus he was about his
[1:25:47] father's
[1:25:48] business preaching somewhere else
[1:25:55] I'm just saying they that are led by the
[1:25:58] spirit they are the sons of
[1:26:01] God and I know some of y'all don't like
[1:26:04] this it
[1:26:09] anyway yes sir oh she she she despised
[1:26:15] him she would do anything she could to
[1:26:17] kill
[1:26:18] him but yet he was a true he was true to
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:23] principles and God standards her modern
[1:26:27] parties and
[1:26:32] socials and her paintings of her
[1:26:36] face and the wearing of her
[1:26:41] clothes had polluted that
[1:26:50] Nation had polluted that
[1:26:53] Nation so when you got Christians who
[1:26:56] claim to be
[1:26:58] Christians and they wearing ungodly
[1:27:02] clothing and they're coming into this
[1:27:05] church you don't understand it is a
[1:27:13] pollution if it was then what it is
[1:27:17] now

[1:27:23] easy he told her right where she was
[1:27:28] standing hallelujah oh
[1:27:31] yeah God send us some more Elijah in
[1:27:34] this
[1:27:37] day that will not compromise with
[1:27:41] sin somebody who will preach the truth
[1:27:45] no matter how bad it
[1:27:47] hurts God has still got got servants in
[1:27:51] every
[1:27:53] community that won't compromise with the
[1:27:56] things of the
[1:27:57] world Hallelujah you know why I'm
[1:28:00] preaching
[1:28:02] this the other week when I wasn't here I
[1:28:06] had to go to that women's
[1:28:08] retreat anyway I was coming back
[1:28:11] home I was stuck in in Atlanta atanta
[1:28:16] Georgia Atlant Georgia I was supposed to
[1:28:18] get home that morning at
[1:28:21] 9:30 got home around 11:30 12:00 that
[1:28:24] night I was very weary I was very tired
[1:28:29] but the thing that bothered me more than
[1:28:31] anything
[1:28:32] else I saw evil on such a
[1:28:36] scale
[1:28:40] F but instead of
[1:28:42] breaking instead of crying instead of
[1:28:46] feeling a love for those
[1:28:50] Souls I had allowed myself to get on the
[1:28:52] hardened
[1:28:54] side you know we we don't like being
[1:28:56] hurt we don't like that hurt feeling and
[1:28:59] sometimes we protect
[1:29:01] ourselves You by allowing ourselves to
[1:29:04] get
[1:29:05] hardened but that's not the way of
[1:29:08] the is that right the Bible says seal
[1:29:14] those who sigh and
[1:29:17] cry because of the
[1:29:19] Abomination done in the city
[1:29:22] I want you to listen to this message
[1:29:25] because brother bam said they're the
[1:29:28] only ones that will make
[1:29:30] it and he says how many of you s and
[1:29:37] cry not just in the city not just in the
[1:29:41] city but sigh and cry because of the
[1:29:45] things that goes on in this
[1:29:50] ass see y act like all santimon and
[1:29:53] things don't go
[1:29:55] wrong but I know
[1:30:00] better and because you think you know
[1:30:03] the message you have a bad attitude
[1:30:05] about
[1:30:07] things it shows the Holy Ghost where you
[1:30:10] think he is in
[1:30:13] you because let me tell you something
[1:30:15] about the word of God and the of Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ she is
[1:30:20] am
[1:30:23] and she she knows the
[1:30:28] voice of her husband she knows that
[1:30:31] voice and whether she likes it or not
[1:30:34] she will always say
[1:30:37] Amen is that right amen hallelujah when
[1:30:40] God called that woman a
[1:30:42] dog it is not neat for me to give you
[1:30:45] the children's bread you are dog your
[1:30:49] people are dog Hallelujah
[1:30:52] and she says even
[1:30:54] so in other words that was
[1:30:57] amen even
[1:30:59] so the dogs desire the crumbs that fall
[1:31:02] from the
[1:31:03] table
[1:31:05] Hallelujah yes sir listen what I'm
[1:31:08] trying to get you to do with all I've
[1:31:10] just
[1:31:10] said I want you to
[1:31:14] seek within
[1:31:17] yourself the proof that Christ is in you
[1:31:23] seek it you got to know that you know
[1:31:26] that
[1:31:27] you
[1:31:29] Hallelujah understand me like I was
[1:31:31] telling the churches up uh in in De Mo
[1:31:35] we have different
[1:31:37] churches with different
[1:31:39] pastors but when we come together there
[1:31:42] shall never be a funny
[1:31:47] feeling if it's a funny feeling you got
[1:31:50] going on
[1:31:52] you are a
[1:32:02] denomination hallelujah
[1:32:09] amen and that's the
[1:32:12] truth because you supposed to love not
[1:32:14] only your Christian
[1:32:16] Brothers but you supposed to love your
[1:32:20] enemies that's when you know you got
[1:32:22] something you can love your
[1:32:27] enemy go to with me to Second
[1:32:31] Corinthians
[1:32:44] Corinthians I pray God don't let this
[1:32:46] word slip from
[1:32:48] you even if you criticize it
[1:32:52] I would be
[1:32:55] happy does that mean you won't forget it
[1:32:58] that means God is going to work with
[1:33:04] you beginning at the second
[1:33:07] verse at the third verse
[1:33:10] brother second Corinthians
[1:33:19] 133 since ye since ye seek a proof of
[1:33:24] Christ speaking in me which to you are
[1:33:28] is not
[1:33:29] weak but is mighty in
[1:33:38] you for though he was crucified through
[1:33:42] weakness yet he liveth by the power of
[1:33:45] God for we also are weak in him but we
[1:33:50] shall live with him by the power of God
[1:33:54] toward
[1:34:04] you examine yourselves whether you be in
[1:34:07] the faith prove your own selves you hear
[1:34:12] what I'm saying prove your own
[1:34:16] selves know ye not your own
[1:34:20] selves that Jesus Christ is in

[1:34:27] reprobated Hallelujah every
[1:34:30] individual who claims to be a Christian
[1:34:34] should know whether he's in there or
[1:34:38] not hallelujah amen glory to
[1:34:45] God what do you
[1:34:48] see are you seeing an individual this
[1:34:52] trying to be
[1:34:55] something uhh that's not in the will of
[1:34:59] God what life runs your
[1:35:03] life what is it because there is
[1:35:06] something in you it's either life or
[1:35:11] death which one is running your
[1:35:14] life you need to look into
[1:35:17] that hallelujah amen because you say you
[1:35:20] believe the m message doesn't mean
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:24] anything all followed Moses all followed
[1:35:28] Moses Millions followed
[1:35:31] Moses but Millions
[1:35:35] died you understand me you really don't
[1:35:39] follow the
[1:35:40] prophet until you obey what he
[1:35:44] says and he's not telling you nothing
[1:35:48] different than what the word commands of
[1:35:50] us
[1:35:54] oh
[1:35:56] hallelujah
[1:36:02] hallelujah people don't
[1:36:05] understand somebody was we were we were
[1:36:07] discussing the other
[1:36:10] day rapt make
[1:36:14] the the truth of the matter is the
[1:36:18] rapture is given to a special class of
[1:36:20] people
[1:36:23] it doesn't mean other people aren't
[1:36:26] Christians they will not there are those
[1:36:28] that will not be
[1:36:31] translated this message brother Bram
[1:36:34] states God gave him the
[1:36:38] message dress the bride
[1:36:41] with so if you don't have the
[1:36:44] message you don't have the proper at
[1:36:48] TI you understand what I'm saying you
[1:36:51] know I was telling the brother the oil
[1:36:54] that was in the
[1:36:55] lamp brought us to the
[1:36:58] door is that right but that door had a
[1:37:04] keeper he had a servant there that would
[1:37:08] give out the
[1:37:11] robes y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:37:14] and so brother BR was the only
[1:37:20] man give out the
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:24] road so if you don't know about brother
[1:37:27] Brandon or the message in which he
[1:37:30] preached you won't know the
[1:37:35] Rob hallelujah amen the foolish
[1:37:39] virgin had enough Holy
[1:37:41] Ghost to bring them to
[1:37:45] sanctification Hallelujah but the Bride
[1:37:48] of Jesus Christ not only had enough a
[1:37:51] holy
[1:37:52] ghost to be filled with it but she had
[1:37:56] extra oil she knew the door she
[1:38:00] understood the door and she was able to
[1:38:02] go in the
[1:38:05] door why because God gave her a
[1:38:08] message he gave her
[1:38:11] instruction he gave her a
[1:38:14] direction list no
[1:38:16] Jesus no Jesus no Baptist Jesus no no
[1:38:21] Methodist Jesus no Pentecostal
[1:38:24] Jesus listen this Jesus whom we were
[1:38:29] worship it's a true and living God
[1:38:33] hallelujah how do you know that brother
[1:38:36] Brooks he proved himself hallah we serve
[1:38:42] the Jesus Christ of yesterday the
[1:38:47] Hallelujah that Jehovah God hallelujah
[1:38:51] of
[1:38:52] yesterday is Jesus Christ of the day
[1:38:56] Hallelujah we serve a God that changes
[1:39:00] not Hebrews 13 and8 said that Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:39:07] forever how do you know that brother
[1:39:11] because God stepped in Malachi
[1:39:14] fall himself in a world of a prophet and
[1:39:18] he spoke to us we saw him we understand
[1:39:22] him
[1:39:24] Hallelujah it was more than a man it was
[1:39:27] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:39:36] forever hallelujah
[1:39:39] amen I had somebody
[1:39:42] say to me the other day somebody whom I
[1:39:47] love said to me well you know what
[1:39:52] said how can people not believe brother
[1:39:53] Brandon was a
[1:39:55] prophet and when the person said a
[1:39:58] prophet I thought no the
[1:40:01] prophet and and and and the person says
[1:40:05] and I I gota I believe it basically he
[1:40:07] said but he got a few
[1:40:10] issues what were you talking about you
[1:40:12] got a few
[1:40:13] issues
[1:40:15] Hallelujah maybe I hope your issue is
[1:40:19] because he had a Kian accent
[1:40:22] Hallelujah maybe maybe you didn't like
[1:40:25] his the way he
[1:40:26] dressed I hope that's your issue because
[1:40:30] when it comes to the
[1:40:31] word hallelujah if you got an issue with
[1:40:35] the word hallelujah you got an issue
[1:40:38] with
[1:40:40] God hallelujah amen one thing you got to
[1:40:43] know about a prophet he cannot give out
[1:40:46] his own
[1:40:48] seed Hallelujah the only SE seed he can
[1:40:51] give out is a seed of God hallelujah
[1:40:55] y'all hear what I'm
[1:40:57] saying hallelujah and that's what people
[1:41:00] don't understand I'm saying what do you
[1:41:03] see this is more than
[1:41:08] religion you got to grow in this thing
[1:41:12] Hallelujah you got to mature in this
[1:41:14] thing we're not Pentecostal babies we
[1:41:18] are maturing into the full wi of God
[1:41:22] and the only way you're going to do that
[1:41:24] you first must be born
[1:41:28] again Hallelujah Psalms
[1:41:32] 119 Psalms 119 Psalm you know I just get
[1:41:36] I just get so
[1:41:38] grieved I get
[1:41:41] grieved burdened when I see my wife

[1:41:47] can't even come out of my bedroom
[1:41:49] because so
[1:41:51] and I'm so
[1:41:53] troubled you know I know you can cry too
[1:41:56] much but I was saying to the Lord what
[1:41:58] on
[1:41:59] Earth be done know we cry we pray for
[1:42:05] Revival and we try to bring
[1:42:08] correction we to do
[1:42:11] that the more hardened the people
[1:42:16] become you understand me you know you
[1:42:20] try to tell
[1:42:21] what they shouldn't be
[1:42:24] doing I found out that I was I've been
[1:42:28] trying to
[1:42:29] do the work of the Holy
[1:42:32] Ghost I can't do it it takes the Holy
[1:42:35] Ghost to do
[1:42:40] it the Bible
[1:42:44] says except the Builder build the
[1:42:49] house the laborers work in
[1:42:53] vain if God don't build a
[1:42:55] house you work in
[1:42:58] vain hallelujah hallelujah Psalms 119

[1:43:15] air with all of that you need to be you
[1:43:19] need to I don't how I don't know how to
[1:43:21] say it but something in you ought to be
[1:43:24] driving
[1:43:26] you down on your
[1:43:28] knees because you know what is
[1:43:32] required and you know what you're
[1:43:35] lacking Hallelujah and Jesus said we
[1:43:38] have not because we
[1:43:41] ask Hallelujah is that right brother
[1:43:45] Bram even preach a message on the token
[1:43:47] he said out of all the messages he
[1:43:50] preached
[1:43:52] that was the
[1:43:53] one why because without that you make no
[1:44:01] Rapture he said it takes
[1:44:06] desperation

[1:48:48] he said an old St story of some years
[1:48:52] ago there was a man and he thought he
[1:48:55] would go out and have a little friendly
[1:48:57] drink Christmas
[1:48:59] time just for
[1:49:01] fellowship and he went out among his
[1:49:04] neighbor and he was exchanging
[1:49:08] presents and everybody would say to him
[1:49:12] now John just take a drink of
[1:49:15] this and a little sip here and a little
[1:49:19] sip there
[1:49:21] and he got really
[1:49:23] intoxicated and on his road
[1:49:26] home there had come a
[1:49:28] snow about six

[1:49:35] him and he couldn't pack he couldn't
[1:49:38] pack
[1:49:39] him he was too drunk and he was on his
[1:49:43] road
[1:49:44] home and he happened to turn around and
[1:49:47] noticed this little boy just almost was

[1:49:52] snow and he said Son why are you
[1:49:56] wallowing in the
[1:49:59] snow he said daddy I'm trying to follow
[1:50:03] your
[1:50:05] footsteps and he picked the little L lad
[1:50:08] up in his
[1:50:09] arms and he said God from this day on
[1:50:14] I'll never take another
[1:50:17] drink Hallelujah I'm saying that
[1:50:20] because somebody's watching your
[1:50:23] footsteps your children are looking at

[1:52:05] people let me tell y'all something
[1:52:07] people of God the only way God could say
[1:52:11] this to any people is that they were
[1:52:15] covered by the
[1:52:18] blood
[1:52:21] that's the only way covered elected
[1:52:25] chosen that that that's the only way
[1:52:29] Peter could ever say that because he's
[1:52:33] recognizing the effect of the
[1:52:36] blood he said that ye should show forth
[1:52:40] the
[1:52:43] Praises of him who have called you out

[1:56:46] new what we need is a Revival like that
[1:56:51] today really it's
[1:56:54] true oh we've had dip of dips of the
[1:57:00] spirit we've had spiritual blessings and
[1:57:03] spiritual
[1:57:07] uprises listen to what he says but we

[1:57:26] of the
[1:57:28] spirit or Spiritual
[1:57:31] Awakening we need a
[1:57:34] Revival that Revival what we've
[1:57:37] got not a spiritual
[1:57:41] awakening sometimes that causes mixed
[1:57:44] multitude we need a Revival that'll sift

[1:58:08] it Hallelujah am fifth or sixth verse
[1:58:12] that's what the church need is Revival
[1:58:16] to shake it from all of the worldliness
[1:58:20] and the things of the world and bring
[1:58:22] back
[1:58:24] Purity Holiness of God in the heart of

[1:59:07] while on their Spirit they become so
[1:59:12] carnal and so
[1:59:15] indifferent till they get self styled
[1:59:27] self-righteous they read and
[1:59:30] study and that's good but that ain't the
[1:59:33] thing we're talking
[1:59:35] about you know more about the word it's
[1:59:39] good to know the word but it's better to
[1:59:42] know the author of the
[1:59:44] word see that's the little
[1:59:47] something that you leave out there
[1:59:51] something in the heart that makes you
[1:59:54] what you

[2:02:53] page just get a new
[2:02:57] life Christ is the
[2:03:01] answer hallelujah amen and I'll say in
[2:03:07] closing I know I've said a few rough
[2:03:12] things and but I'm going tell you
[2:03:15] something it's for it's for your
[2:03:17] good
[2:03:19] and and understand everything I've
[2:03:22] said I've got to give an account before
[2:03:25] God because I said anything that's
[2:03:28] outside of love for
[2:03:30] you going to judge me for
[2:03:34] that hallelujah amen now people of
[2:03:38] God I'm all for the great
[2:03:42] Mysteries with all of that knowing all
[2:03:46] of
[2:03:47] that how much
[2:03:50] change have you
[2:03:54] made what what did it change
[2:03:56] you what what see because the prophet
[2:04:00] God tells us this you can have a mental
[2:04:04] conception hallelujah amen and when your
[2:04:08] when your Holy Ghost is just in your
[2:04:10] mind if I could say it like that you're
[2:04:13] going to
[2:04:15] fail you know why because your
[2:04:20] eyes will determine on how much you have
[2:04:24] faith in your
[2:04:26] mind right y'all know that's the truth
[2:04:29] it's like taking a baby's
[2:04:31] temperature you just pray for that
[2:04:34] person and the temperature went
[2:04:36] up and the and then the devil says Rush
[2:04:40] the child to the
[2:04:41] hospital but then you just
[2:04:46] pray which one you believe
[2:04:50] and often time we pray for a
[2:04:54] child yourself because I understand the
[2:04:56] conflicts there use yourself you're sick
[2:05:01] and you done prayed for God to heal
[2:05:04] you but your temperature go up and the
[2:05:07] first thing you say I'm getting
[2:05:10] worse that's because your faith is in
[2:05:12] your
[2:05:14] head it's not in your
[2:05:17] heart when it's in your heart it's a
[2:05:22] revelation God done already showed you
[2:05:24] you done not you healed he already
[2:05:27] showed you you delivered hallelujah it's
[2:05:31] in your
[2:05:32] heart that's where Abraham called those
[2:05:35] things that be
[2:05:38] not but he believe those things that be
[2:05:41] not with his
[2:05:42] heart hallelu that's the
[2:05:46] message and as long as you have this
[2:05:50] intellectual
[2:05:52] faith never take you
[2:05:54] nowhere and it'll get you to a place
[2:05:58] where you will even question the message
[2:06:01] whether it be right or
[2:06:05] not that's where Eve messed
[2:06:08] up she let the devil talk to her
[2:06:12] mind and she followed that lust in her
[2:06:17] mind
[2:06:19] that lust brought her to
[2:06:22] death let let me say this one more
[2:06:25] thing uh before I close you know the
[2:06:27] Bible says that when lust is conceived
[2:06:30] y'all ever thought about that I heard
[2:06:32] somebody say this I heard somebody say
[2:06:35] this and I have not been able to forget
[2:06:38] it he said when lust is
[2:06:46] conceived you are impregnated whatever
[2:06:50] whatever that is you just lost
[2:06:53] for you
[2:06:56] are what you're going to have
[2:07:02] a right because what happens when is
[2:07:10] conceived like a
[2:07:17] child
[2:07:19] y'all hear I'm saying so you got to
[2:07:22] understand what devil is doing to
[2:07:25] you it gives you stuff that's not of the
[2:07:29] word accept it you have now accepted his
[2:07:37] seed and no way of getting way of rid of
[2:07:40] it unless you ask God to take it
[2:07:44] out but for the most
[2:07:46] part sin is conceed
[2:07:50] is already
[2:07:52] there and you don't forgot you a
[2:07:58] Christian and Satan don't wake you
[2:08:01] up until you have produced that
[2:08:06] child y' know it's
[2:08:08] true you know it's true because we would
[2:08:12] never do or even think some of the
[2:08:13] things we
[2:08:14] do always remember who we are
[2:08:20] that's why James says don't look in the
[2:08:23] mirror of the word walk away and forget
[2:08:26] you
[2:08:28] are you love the Lord I want you to look
[2:08:32] inside
[2:08:34] yourself and tell tell yourself what you
[2:08:39] see is the Holy Ghost living in
[2:08:43] you is God ring your
[2:08:47] life or are you
[2:08:51] struggling this is what the Holy Spirit
[2:08:52] spoke to me the other
[2:08:54] day many people are
[2:08:58] performing performing like a
[2:09:01] Christian but a lamb don't perform to be
[2:09:04] a
[2:09:05] lamb lamb is a
[2:09:09] lamb Hallelujah you don't want to act
