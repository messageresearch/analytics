[15:40] where the mysterious white rock was not
[15:43] written off
[15:46] and the angel took me into the pyramid
[15:48] of himself
[15:51] watch this now he said the angels
[15:54] to be into the pyramid of themselves
[15:58] hallelujah the mysteries of god
[16:02] known only to them
[16:47] that had no words on it
[17:30] jesus
[17:55] there isn't that many christians
[18:11] people say if you listen brother branham
[18:15] tells us
[18:16] he don't know how and when right now
[18:20] so what we've had in our minds
[18:23] all these years have been the
[18:43] [Music]
[19:06] this is not a conditional covenant
[19:22] is
[19:50] is that
[20:18] moses and elijah is a sixth
[20:32] not the flesh sealer the man
[21:00] hallelujah
[21:07] to allow god's mind to be in me
[21:10] but god is saying you must
[21:28] in order
[21:42] 18 19
[21:50] that you may know what is the hope of
[21:52] this calling
[21:54] and what the riches of the glory of the
[21:56] inheritance in saints
[21:59] and what is the exceeding greatness
[22:02] of his power to us what who believe
[22:06] according to the working of his mighty
[22:09] power is that right now goes all the way
[22:12] back
[22:14] and he tells us that we were in the mind
[22:16] of god
[22:18] before time begins now god's
[22:22] thoughts about you it does not evolve
[22:28] [Music]
[22:38] perfection
[22:52] now
[23:05] the relationship
[23:13] [Music]
[23:18] oh thank god for the blood of jesus
[23:48] i know some of you all know these things
[23:50] already but just
[23:52] refresh your mind
[23:56] we're in a different age which we are so
[23:58] [Music]
[24:00] hallelujah how many all know that the
[24:03] prophet god
[24:04] likened the seven church ages
[24:07] as the wilderness
[24:11] after uh
[24:15] as a wilderness the church in the
[24:17] wilderness
[24:21] [Music]
[24:26] their experience and i'll get there in
[24:27] just a moment
[24:29] next year our experience
[24:36] see god always allow history
[24:39] to repeat itself you have to shoot
[24:41] perfect
[24:43] but this is the last round
[24:48] they're not cleaning another church age
[24:51] there's not coming another messenger
[24:56] amen so when somebody rise up and say
[24:59] they're the only angels
[25:02] know that they all walk in the world
[25:05] hallelujah
[25:09] hallelujah if there is an eighth angel
[25:11] it must be jesus christ
[25:31] that thou may be rich and white raymond
[25:34] the dominant be clothed and that the
[25:37] shame of that nakedness do not appear
[25:40] and anoint their eyes with eyeshadow
[25:43] that thou mayest see
[25:54] hallelujah
[26:08] we must anoint

[26:27] god allowed him to put a little light
[26:29] there
[26:31] hallelujah is that right
[26:34] hallelujah and he said when god
[26:36] testified
[26:39] [Music]
[26:50] that
[26:59] on the board
[27:15] is that right that's why god
[27:58] [Music]
[28:14] hallelujah
[28:17] [Music]
[28:27] as long as they spoke in time they claim
[28:30] that to be the holy ghost
[28:33] and give your revelation it's like the
[28:36] pentecostal revelations
[28:46] for the man of god
[29:10] let the prophet of

[29:30] [Music]

[36:45] [Applause]
[36:52] i see him
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:01] [Music]
[37:04] hope in himself
[37:28] [Music]
[37:34] oh

[38:22] [Music]
[38:27] this flesh has a tendency to fight
[38:44] god

[38:58] god
[39:12] right
[39:26] hallelujah
[39:40] is

[40:07] [Music]
[40:08] this is
[40:14] [Music]
[40:22] it
[40:36] authority
[40:50] oh
[40:53] [Music]
[41:03] it's yours
[41:22] listen let me say it like this the word
[41:24] of god
[41:47] foundation for faith
[41:59] now god may
[42:42] but this is
[42:56] is
[43:10] oh
[43:24] is
[43:33] of the seals
[43:48] [Music]
[44:15] [Music]
[44:41] [Music]
[45:07] [Music]
[45:15] and then he turned to his
[45:30] god
[45:36] [Music]
[45:38] just like those disciples
[45:47] [Music]
[45:59] [Music]
[46:40] let me ask you a question
[46:51] i know
[47:08] um
[47:22] they are
[47:39] [Music]
[47:50] christ had redeemed us back to that he
[47:52] let him remind you
[47:53] now listen he said christ has redeemed
[47:56] us back to that
[47:57] all right
[48:00] to redeem anything to bring it back
[48:17] about your supernatural experiences
[48:20] because they think you're trying to be
[48:22] like brothers
[48:42] [Music]
[48:46] like
[48:59] supposed to be doing far more
[49:10] you know one of the things i'm feeling
[49:13] joshua here quickly
[49:18] but you know when it comes to joshua
[49:20] josh was like the seventh seal
[49:24] hallelujah represent the holy ghost
[49:28] with yourself
[49:56] together
[50:07] the seals were opened
[50:38] god
[50:50] nobody knew him
[50:59] whether they want to believe it or not
[51:20] oh
[51:34] hallelujah
[51:47] he was getting his position then
[52:02] that's why the people with moses
[52:05] they're kind of like under the law
[52:08] that's right
[52:09] all right
[52:26] [Music]
[52:27] everybody was coming from the east west
[52:44] you can lay
[53:15] [Music]
[53:25] tell the people
[53:30] in other words
[53:53] he was praying
[53:57] [Music]
[54:08] he goes up to this great man
[54:13] [Music]
[54:28] of the lord
[54:47] [Applause]
[54:50] oh
[55:01] that's what god is doing with us
[55:18] oh
[55:27] he was getting his positions
[55:44] nowhere has ever been compared with
[55:46] joshua
[55:58] so when he's seen this man what was
[56:01] [Music]
[56:08] and that leader is none other than
[56:10] christ himself
[56:28] i don't even know what
[56:45] [Music]
[56:50] no man could open the shield
[57:15] [Music]
[57:52] them
[58:02] one of the things that joshua taught
[58:06] them
[58:34] hallelujah
[58:48] amen
[59:03] [Music]
[59:16] um
[59:18] amen joshua just alone by himself
[59:22] and i said seeing just what it was she
[59:24] said
[59:26] that he led him as an angel he stood and
[59:30] called himself
[59:51] against the walls of jericho
[1:00:11] of course
[1:00:25] [Music]
[1:00:26] abraham many many years before then
[1:00:30] i had no father
[1:01:07] himself to his people
[1:01:24] separation from the earthly jerseys
[1:01:30] which were spiritual things
[1:01:34] and they eat of the old chords
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:04] real food
[1:02:30] you didn't build them
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:45] everything comes free
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:11] so wherever i wish i could do this
[1:03:56] go to the first chapter of joshua you
[1:03:58] love the lord
[1:04:00] amen hallelujah
[1:04:04] remember i think i i i preached it here
[1:04:07] last time i'm not sure
[1:04:08] but i dealt with uh inheritance and how
[1:04:12] the in the in in the earthen vessel you
[1:04:14] had the
[1:04:15] sealed vessel the seal documents and the
[1:04:18] regular documents that were given

[1:04:32] seal
[1:04:34] of document in the bottle according to
[1:04:36] jeremiah
[1:04:38] so here's the dawn

[1:05:08] thunders
[1:05:10] even though the seals made way open
[1:05:14] and then the thunder's uttered
[1:05:19] and there was like the space of a half
[1:05:21] hour
[1:05:24] and brother branham brings it out that
[1:05:26] that cloud lasted about 28 minutes
