[0:03] time.
[0:05] God is not stupid. He knows the ANGRY
[0:13] to you. Amen.
[0:18] He gave you hospitality.
[0:22] Hospitality is your
[0:25] keep on.
[0:28] One day you're going to receive angels.
[0:31] So that's your gift.
[0:33] You will be blessed by them.
[0:37] Everyone can be can.
[0:41] But there are other people
