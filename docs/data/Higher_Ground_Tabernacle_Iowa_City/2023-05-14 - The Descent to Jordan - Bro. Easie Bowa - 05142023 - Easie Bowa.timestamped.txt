[51:51] before we started
[51:53] uh
[51:58] if someone wants to sleep
[52:00] during the preach the service
[52:08] I have one skills that are the Lord
[52:11] helped me to help people doing the
[52:12] questions
[52:17] so whenever somebody sleeps we're just
[52:20] gonna ask a question who's going to yeah
[52:24] and you can find that the person
[52:26] sleeping
[52:29] and everybody gonna know that the person
[52:32] says
[52:34] so pay attention
[52:40] because I'm gonna ask that question in
[52:43] the time
[52:46] and when you don't understand what they
[52:48] say
[52:49] are you going to hell
[52:57] I mean
[53:00] he had a friend named John Jean is
[53:05] John went because he had to go to church
[53:08] yeah very uncertain manifestation
[53:11] and there were a manifestation of power
[53:15] so John Wayne asked his brothers
[53:25] can I borrow your shoes because I want
[53:28] to worry wear it yeah
[54:10] [Music]
[54:30] oh John you went with my shoes
[54:36] it is a disgrace to sleep in church
[54:41] instead of Rejoice
[54:46] with my shoes you have to bring me back
[54:49] my shoes
[54:52] it's not a good thing to sleep during
[54:54] the service okay
[54:57] now we just uh turn on your spirit
[55:01] so we can start up
[55:07] this morning we're going to start uh
[55:09] with the service
[55:11] teaching that we started
[55:16] and I want to finish this at least three
[55:19] Sundays
[55:21] and then we can bring for something
[55:25] but I would like to tell the church
[55:32] I thank the pastor to give me this
[55:34] opportunity
[55:36] to stand here and to bring together
[55:39] and I thank you for coming
[55:42] to listen to us
[55:45] because you know that if you're not here
[55:47] we have one person acupressure we do not
[55:49] have anybody to pray
[56:14] the Lord has put in my mind in my heart
[56:17] a message in uh
[56:32] what's the mission of the church
[56:37] and everything that the church is all
[56:40] about
[56:41] that's why if you pay attention foreign
[56:58] [Music]
[57:20] that God went through uh politics are
[57:23] also churches
[57:26] it's now every girl in that church
[57:29] but church
[57:37] people who are in themselves temple of
[57:41] God
[57:43] says
[57:48] Whenever two or three are guarded in my
[57:51] name is
[57:53] [Music]
[58:03] not supposed to be here
[58:08] if we come in here with different
[58:10] motives
[58:16] the Lord will not be here
[58:31] [Music]
[58:43] that is church
[59:22] now let's read the word of God
[59:25] foreign
[59:43] uh we're going to read the second book
[59:46] of uh King versus
[59:55] second book of Kings uh chapter two
[59:59] where
[1:00:02] and verse 3.
[1:00:05] it is written
[1:00:13] and
[1:00:18] and Elijah said unto Elijah
[1:00:21] Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has
[1:00:25] sent me to to better it is
[1:00:35] and Elisha said unto him as the Lord
[1:00:38] lived it as thy soul liveth I will not
[1:00:42] leave thee so they went down to birth
[1:00:53] and the sons of the prophets that were
[1:00:56] at better came forth to the Elijah and
[1:00:59] said unto him notice that that the Lord
[1:01:02] will take away thy master from thy head
[1:01:04] today
[1:01:09] and he said yeah I know it hoji your
[1:01:13] peace foreign
[1:02:08] foreign
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:20] and Elijah said unto him stay here I
[1:02:24] pray thee here for the Lord has sent me
[1:02:27] to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth
[1:02:30] and isolated I will not leave thee and
[1:02:33] they went to win
[1:02:42] and 50 million of the sons of the
[1:02:45] Prophet went and stood to view a fall
[1:02:47] off and they they too stood by Jordan
[1:02:59] and Elijah took His Garment and wrapped
[1:03:02] it together and smote the waters and
[1:03:05] they were divided here and Tighter so so
[1:03:09] they too went over on dry ground
[1:03:12] may God bless the rhythm of the word we
[1:03:16] may be seated
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:38] Christ the type of Christian in his
[1:03:40] church
[1:03:42] Elisha Elijah that means it is
[1:04:03] called to be uh to replace the Prophet
[1:04:06] Elijah
[1:04:08] it wasn't an easy tasks
[1:04:12] it was a really difficult time
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:21] at the same way the church is called to
[1:04:23] replace the ministry of Christ
[1:04:28] because Elijah has to replace Elijah
[1:04:35] and to replace means to come to a
[1:04:38] position
[1:04:42] or doing the test that the other one was
[1:04:45] doing
[1:04:46] that means uh replace
[1:04:56] Elijah Allah
[1:04:59] it was not an easy thing
[1:05:33] not only it was in a Revival but it was
[1:05:36] the Revival
[1:05:38] and brothers and sisters
[1:05:43] we understood that Elisha means a tip
[1:05:47] typified the type of Christ
[1:05:53] so the church that was simplified by
[1:05:56] Elijah is
[1:06:00] to receive his Revival after the
[1:06:03] departure of the Christ
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:25] to turn back to the words
[1:07:29] Jordan
[1:08:08] now here we are in the Jordan
[1:08:11] now listen
[1:08:13] uh the same Prophet the Jew the holy the
[1:08:17] the the same Prophet God
[1:08:25] in order for Elijah to see Elijah being
[1:08:29] raptured Elizabeth
[1:08:33] in order for Elijah to see those
[1:08:35] churches
[1:08:40] and those horses that came down to take
[1:08:43] away
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:49] to come down to the Jordan
[1:08:52] segment
[1:08:54] will only speak for 450 ones
[1:08:58] just know that you already use my 20
[1:09:01] minutes

[1:09:07] I'm not gonna abuse your time
[1:09:13] just be patient with me especially when
[1:09:16] I've been out away from him
[1:09:20] so I'm not in a rush of living away from
[1:09:24] here
[1:09:26] I'm not in a rush
[1:09:43] if you see somebody sleeping we already
[1:09:46] know what's going to happen
[1:09:50] just say you're a candidate
[1:09:52] to the one that's sleeping it's you
[1:09:55] welcome in Hell tell him

[1:10:10] now listen
[1:10:13] foreign
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:12:11] to take away early to take uh Elijah
[1:12:15] home
[1:12:17] that was that was a foreign
[1:12:25] he had had enough to to to argue to talk
[1:12:29] with those people
[1:12:34] arrested and being with hungry and are
[1:12:37] talking disputes
[1:12:40] Elijah was ready to go back home

[1:12:51] said
[1:12:54] he wanted to see a vision

[1:14:58] I'm the Prophet The Prophet said
[1:15:03] when God took away Elijah Elizabeth
[1:15:57] when he was ready for Revival now notice
[1:16:05] this meant I was a young uh

[1:16:19] there yes they called The Prophet from
[1:16:21] the schools
[1:16:23] now we're standing in 50 minutes
[1:16:33] they were forced to bow down him before
[1:16:36] him across the day because of what
[1:16:38] basketball
[1:16:40] because he had the problem the power of
[1:16:44] God in on him brothers and sisters
[1:16:49] nothing can bring this I suppose to bow
[1:16:54] down before you
[1:16:56] if you are a like
[1:16:59] the only thing
[1:17:02] that we bring the world

[1:22:30] the farm
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:23:26] where God can find them
[1:23:43] it's because we have people who never
[1:23:46] cross over it
[1:23:48] I keep in your mind
[1:24:06] with Christ
[1:24:10] today today
[1:24:19] is
[1:24:23] bringing us
[1:24:34] so Elijah bro

[1:25:40] God is trying to empty us three
[1:25:49] is
[1:26:43] foreign
[1:28:02] we all know with Brothers
[1:28:14] and to empty us completely
[1:28:18] Farms to be men and women sample without
[1:28:22] fear mature who love God
[1:28:26] and we can stand with God
[1:28:31] we can reach the line of Separation yes
[1:28:37] I can cross over Jordans
[1:28:41] so that he can use us for his glory
[1:28:46] this is the time
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:48] they will
[1:30:48] all the wisdom
[1:30:53] and that was a knowledge
[1:31:00] but you know when Moses wants it to
[1:31:02] deliver
[1:31:05] based on that knowledge that never
[1:31:08] worked
[1:31:09] thank you
[1:31:11] is
[1:31:15] when he found the Egyptian that was
[1:31:17] beaten yeah
[1:31:27] according to the words
[1:31:41] when Moses found those two Israelites
[1:31:49] you are brothers
[1:31:55] you want to kill me as you killed that
[1:31:58] Egyptian you have or is that completely
[1:32:01] and Moses knew that the thing is
[1:32:36] foreign
[1:32:57] and that took 40 years
[1:33:00] now listen
[1:33:02] it was the teachings
[1:33:04] Moses had four years of training
[1:33:08] of knowledge of Egyptians
[1:33:11] and God also takes 40 years
[1:33:16] to take away those knowledge
[1:33:18] it takes another 40 years
[1:33:23] to be the leader of Israel
[1:33:26] now look what we need you but when we
[1:33:30] come to God
[1:33:33] we just want things to happen
[1:33:37] we don't want to take time
[1:33:40] so that God can empty us
[1:33:44] from our knowledge of the word
[1:33:48] this is what we do wrong
[1:34:03] to his own School of training
[1:34:06] something happened to Paul
