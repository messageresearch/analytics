[20:41] and we will open our Bibles
[20:46] [Music]
[20:49] chapter 2.
[20:53] [Music]
[20:55] from verse 1 to 6 second king chapter 2
[20:58] from verse 26.
[21:03] [Music]
[21:09] I've always
[21:12] before we read the scriptures
[21:17] with a prayer
[21:22] our heavenly father
[21:25] the moment has come
[21:28] time has come where you want to speak to
[21:31] us
[21:33] Lord we want Jesus Christ
[21:39] you come and see all the leaps lips the
[21:42] human lips
[21:44] so that you speak
[21:48] because the person that's here
[21:53] people that are here did not come to
[21:55] listen to me
[21:57] they came here to listen to you speak
[22:59] they don't have amen
[23:17] for this morning
[23:23] I love to bring something
[23:25] with that uh maybe
[23:28] it's God's grace
[23:33] you can go with this on four or three
[23:36] Sundays
[23:39] and we'll see how the spirit leaves us
[23:56] [Music]
[24:24] the theme of this is going to be Elisha
[24:27] and his calling
[24:31] foreign
[25:11] we want you to be ready for this
[25:16] so we read the word
[25:23] it came to pass when the Lord will take
[25:25] up Elijah into heaven
[25:44] what the Lord has sent me to Bethel
[26:44] and he said as the Lord liveth as thou
[26:47] so liveth I will will not leave thee so
[26:49] they came to Jericho the sister prophets
[26:54] and the sons of the prophets that were
[26:57] at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto
[26:59] him
[27:06] notice now that the Lord will take away
[27:08] thy master from thy hat today and he
[27:10] answered yeah I know it holding your
[27:12] peace
[27:19] Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has
[27:21] sent me to Jordan
[27:31] and he said as the Lord liveth as I so
[27:34] liveth I will not leave thee and they
[27:36] went they and they went on
[27:39] the Lord blesses the reading of his word
[27:47] so as I said this morning
[27:51] we'll talk about
[27:53] Elisha and his hauling
[28:00] yes
[28:02] I think the microphone is working okay
[28:13] [Music]
[28:16] he said that Elijah and Elisha are the
[28:19] type of the Church of the Church of the
[28:21] church and God
[28:23] is
[28:28] Christ and Elisha typifies the church
[28:34] now God calls the young Prophet Elijah
[28:38] [Music]
[28:40] to be the successor of the great Prophet
[28:43] Elijah
[28:45] it was not as simple a simple Affair
[28:50] the responsibility now it was a great
[28:53] responsibility that he had to take
[28:59] and the word is to be a successor means
[29:02] to come out
[29:04] or to take the place
[29:10] had to come after Elijah
[29:13] to take the place
[29:17] he had to come back and take the place
[29:22] so it was a very heavy response
[29:29] [Music]
[29:36] Elijah and Elisha were the type of
[29:38] Christ
[29:40] was here on Earth
[29:44] an accomplished great Miracles and Great
[29:47] Signs
[29:53] Spirits were sent down on Earth
[29:56] to come back to the church
[29:59] that means to the believer
[30:03] so if we go back to the history
[30:06] where we read in the first verse
[30:10] the sixth verse
[30:12] [Applause]
[30:17] I made their journey in three steps
[30:21] [Applause]
[30:23] when Elijah he wasn't
[30:27] where he was a plowing
[30:33] and Elijah Elijah went to Elijah
[30:36] he told them he asked him
[30:39] and they started walking it is
[30:51] Jericho to the Jordan
[30:53] three walks
[30:57] that's how God calls his church
[31:01] God calls his church and everybody
[31:09] in three three steps
[31:18] foreign
[31:53] foreign
[32:53] they could cross the Jordan
[32:56] Matthew now
[33:02] because there were three steps of Grace
[33:10] some water here
[34:48] across the Jordan
[34:54] now what is the problem again
[34:57] [Music]
[35:00] now sometimes we can be in Jericho or
[35:02] better
[35:04] the sons of the prophets
[35:08] they're also uh people that cause
[35:10] confusion the troublemakers
[35:14] sings that the preachers
[35:20] they're the ones that cause a lot of
[35:22] trouble to the children of God
[35:52] of Fire
[35:55] amen
[36:33] the Revival
[36:35] amen
[36:39] methanol now kindly said when Elisha
[36:43] became the Revival
[36:47] now people saw that the same God who was
[36:52] the same God of Elijah
[36:55] my problems
[36:57] we are the
[37:00] bride of Christ
[37:03] but the spirits that was in Christ
[37:06] we don't see that same Spirit today
[37:27] and the three steps
[37:43] struck his Road
[37:45] the sons of the prophets they saw it
[37:48] from the others
[37:49] Elijah and Elijah
[37:52] not coming back
[37:54] when Elijah
[37:56] when Elijah comes back
[38:00] yeah
[38:06] [Music]
[38:11] and
[38:14] they all he also crossed
[38:18] and the sons of the prophets
[38:38] you know
[38:41] he left his Spirit
[38:48] God never kept the spirits
[38:54] and he never went back to him
[38:57] to this day this morning
[39:00] where is that Spirits
[39:04] Among Us
[39:07] where is the spirit
[39:11] says
[39:15] now listen to what he says and a man
[39:19] called by God don't sit down time
[39:24] a man called by God
[39:26] I was crying
[39:29] I was crying every time
[39:44] of what the church says
[39:48] today
[40:19] what about us disciples
[40:22] we're here like orphans
[40:30] we remained
[40:35] and Brenham told us
[40:38] we remain
[40:41] as if brother Brown told us
[40:46] then you're out there saying
[40:50] you know I don't know I don't know about
[40:52] those things
[40:54] that's how we are
[41:00] foreign
[42:08] are in the states where they can handle
[42:10] this revival
[42:14] it did he says
[42:17] we cannot have a Revival
[42:21] as long as we will not happening
[42:25] and call by God there's
[42:29] been trained by God
[42:33] cannot buy it there for me who are not
[42:36] trained
[42:41] and by normal schools made their summer
[42:45] so late but solid people there's some of
[42:48] their salt men of agiles that God
[42:52] instructed
[42:54] by his school leader foreign
[43:14] God needs those people first
[43:17] Ahmed the giant sweet Alec called the
[43:21] solid the people who are trained in his
[43:23] solid school
[43:26] people who are not afraid
[43:29] Fearless people
[43:33] who have entered into the presence
[43:44] they know his power of healing
[43:47] man who have been trained
[43:54] the Living God
[43:58] so if we need a Revival
[44:01] we need to have manners
[44:04] and the states
[44:16] they know his healing power
[44:19] cannot pay attention from it on the
[44:20] televolution they have not been trained
[44:22] by theology
[44:24] those are the people of God there's so
[44:27] much
[44:28] people cannot be shaked they're shocking
[44:31] on Papa people who aren't Fearless
[44:37] for the Revival
[44:44] my brethrens
[44:47] foreign
[45:06] where
[45:10] is the church going yeah
[45:30] the Rapture will not come in this
[45:32] condition look on the shoulders
[45:41] the Rapture does not come like that
[46:07] the Bible says okay
[46:10] Daniel that Daniel is
[46:14] when he interpreted the the the the the
[46:16] the the
[46:18] the dream of the king
[46:21] is
[46:24] now the king understood that he could uh
[46:27] challenge Daniel
[46:29] he couldn't make Daniel
[46:32] and he made a statue of days
[46:48] he told everybody to worship that the
[46:51] statue made in the images
[46:59] it started with the worship of a man who
[47:03] was dangerous
[47:08] people will worship a Holy Verse
[47:12] that's what we see today
[47:14] people are worshiping brother
[47:19] [Music]
[47:45] before the statue of their Prophets
[47:49] worshiped
[48:35] evil remain ing
[48:38] yes
[48:44] it remains good
[48:49] today
[48:52] there's a trend in the message
[48:57] when you see someone use a certain form
[49:01] to get to a certain results
[49:04] it becomes an inspiration for everybody
[49:09] how are you telling me are you telling
[49:11] me not to do this
[49:13] why do you not want me to do it
[49:18] when the other guys
[49:28] evil remains evil
[49:34] and now
[49:37] it was on fireplace the three boys
[49:41] because of their testimony
[49:44] we have a different story
[49:47] It Was Written in the Bible
[49:49] because of their testimony
[49:56] because of their brain
[49:59] because they were Fearless men
[50:03] they were the kind of men that God is
[50:05] looking for
[50:24] he's not looking for it
[50:27] if
[50:31] it is
[50:33] you don't have your place in front of
[50:35] before God
[50:38] foreign
[51:24] in the defeat
[51:27] in defeat
[51:31] foreign
[51:36] just go go ahead and go
[52:05] I can carry this message
[52:13] just staying like this
[52:24] that says
[52:26] the church
[52:28] is
[52:30] the power that shakes
[52:33] it's the day every day
[52:44] right now
[52:46] to shake this hour
[52:48] distracted
[53:10] we have to finance
[53:25] the days
[53:32] prepared herself
[53:34] foreign
[54:06] and then we were gone no no no no
[54:11] you'll never go to heaven as a camera
[54:14] but you have to work
[54:17] God give you the holy spirit
[54:20] for you to work
[54:24] for you to work for the kingdom of God
[54:31] the center is
[54:35] then you just remain
[54:45] God gives you something to do
[54:49] he gives you something to do
[54:53] and brother Brown says you see hey
[54:58] no matter it is
[55:04] to go in the fiery furnace even in
[55:07] defeat
[55:13] they're ready to go
[55:17] because they have been in the presence
[55:20] and they know that he does exist
[55:24] furnace
[56:38] to our God
[56:40] and brother Brennan says
[56:44] when they were taken into the fire
[56:46] department
[56:48] I can't see the Mighty God yeah
[56:55] see what's going on down there
[56:58] do you not seeing himself
[57:18] look at the time of
[57:21] God's time will certainly come
[57:41] seven times
[57:51] even in defeat
[58:31] the devil can do for you
[58:49] the God needs
[58:54] and you see
[58:56] twice foreign
[59:22] all of them go through the blood
[59:26] says on purpose God makes his people
[59:31] passes on purpose God makes us speak
[59:33] about the gun disappears go through
[59:36] great challenges
[59:37] to do what to do what
[59:41] to purify them to cleanse them
[59:45] that's what those those that's what
[59:49] if Trials
[1:00:11] of of God
[1:00:15] oh
[1:00:18] I believe that tonight
[1:00:24] what I believe tonight is
[1:00:29] that God is training those type of
[1:00:32] people
[1:00:36] to stand in there
[1:00:39] people that go therefore and they
[1:00:43] sometimes
[1:00:45] they're shaking they're shaken to where
[1:00:48] they even lose uh they can't even walk
[1:00:50] anymore
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:06] we already receive the Revival
[1:01:13] Revival
[1:01:16] if this church wasn't a Revival
[1:01:19] people from outside
[1:01:24] just because of what was what was
[1:01:31] she even talk about talk to our
[1:01:34] co-workers about dogs
[1:01:40] we're no different than that
[1:01:44] we can't tell them about it
[1:01:46] because
[1:01:53] it would have taken people together
[1:01:56] if we were in a Revival
[1:02:02] Revival
[1:02:04] is
[1:02:10] if we're jobless in the Kingdom
[1:02:14] that's why there is not anything
[1:02:16] anything
[1:02:27] for his salvation
[1:02:33] thank you
[1:02:37] like I say brothers
[1:02:39] it's
[1:02:40] gonna hurt
[1:02:42] but if we don't do it
[1:02:46] it's not going to give you good results
[1:02:50] if you're just content with coming to
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:54] and go back to your review yeah
[1:02:58] and maybe next Sunday you won't come
[1:03:02] and then
[1:03:46] when you become the Revival
[1:03:55] to be in a Revival for you
[1:04:05] there's man like David there's someone
[1:04:07] coming Joseph men like Joseph
[1:04:10] correct brave people
[1:04:16] when the when his Masters
[1:04:21] make him do something bad
[1:04:23] he will go out he'll run away he will
[1:04:28] escape
[1:04:30] the people that we need
[1:04:33] Mariah
[1:05:06] so that this church goes forward
[1:05:10] I was reading in the message
[1:05:12] I think it was uh yes the other day
[1:05:15] brother Brown
[1:05:17] there was a woman that came here she was
[1:05:21] sick
[1:05:24] he prayed for a lot of times and she was
[1:05:27] still not healed
[1:05:28] in a certain times
[1:05:34] my sister I see you jayate
[1:05:38] you have been unfaithful to your husband
[1:05:43] and it's because of that that you're
[1:05:44] saying
[1:05:49] cursing you because of that thing that
[1:05:52] you did
[1:05:54] fix it with your husband
[1:05:57] no brother brothers
[1:06:02] my marriage well we'll finish right
[1:06:06] there yes because you love your marriage
[1:06:09] more than you
[1:06:27] being faithful to God
[1:06:29] that you know foreign
[1:07:24] things like that
[1:07:27] everything
[1:07:46] says told her
[1:07:50] secretary
[1:08:05] that's all I'm seeing right now
[1:08:11] I know
[1:08:18] bring him here
[1:08:21] and as they arrived because you know
[1:08:25] there's something ready
[1:08:38] the problem is right here
[1:08:40] tell me what you did yeah
[1:08:49] just tell me what you did
[1:09:15] it's true
[1:09:19] he didn't go four ways
[1:10:08] that's where God will condemn you
[1:10:41] foreign
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:11:17] man
[1:11:27] but the second is
[1:11:34] our Revival to be here
[1:11:41] when in that that day yeah
[1:11:45] this man
[1:11:48] you probably know about the history
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:12:01] because of the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:02] God needs people
[1:13:11] little things that happen
[1:13:15] whatever little things
[1:13:19] we lack patience
[1:13:23] patience is
[1:13:25] what makes us miss a lot of things
[1:13:29] we want things to go too fast
[1:14:13] [Applause]

[1:15:14] I was talking to Brother John as we were
[1:15:16] disabled he said
[1:15:18] he said what year was your car when I
[1:15:22] told him to hear my car
[1:15:29] they brought another model for my car
[1:15:32] you know I said those people yes they're
[1:15:35] playing with people that's what I said
[1:15:43] every year they have to bring them up
[1:15:45] another month
[1:16:03] and it will be new again
[1:16:15] his children
[1:16:18] you're happy of your success
[1:16:22] somebody else will be happy

[1:16:31] successful anymore
[1:16:36] clap your hands for him
