John 11 verse 41. I don't know if uh we got the slides that we can project here okay the Bible says then they took away the stone is and Jesus lifted up his eyes father I thank thee that thou has heard me so when I read my Bible yeah there are a lot of things that uh that that that stand out to me because I'm trying to find out how does God think how was Jesus thinking because when you read this verse he says take away the stone it and then Jesus lifts up his eyes now just try to think Jesus standing there and we saw Jesus lift up his eyes the first reflects is going to be to look up thinking that something's coming up and Jesus said father I thank thee that now has hurt me he has not even started praying yet but he already knew that God has already answered his prayer now that's at that level that's where God is calling him out calling us because there will be situations where you won't have time to pray mention Ed but you have to be certain that God has already entered your prayers if there is a time that you have to be certain what's serious with God it's right now if you know that you don't have God start searching for him now if you know that you're not in line with God start putting start putting your life in order with us because we don't have any time anymore amen can you say Amen now Jesus continues verse 42 and he says I know that down here is me always but because of the people which stand by I said it I think foreign that they may believe that thou has sent me so Jesus is trying to make you understand that the problem is not it's not me the problem is the crowd what's only a second uh because I know that you have already heard me but the problem is those people who are not believed so if I spoke it's because of the crown says the crown represents most of the time the problem is us it's never God when you say Amen I'm gonna go to the book of Psalm chapter 82 verses 6 verse 6. the Bible says I sent [Music] is revelation 10 verse 8. and the voice that I heard from Heaven spoke again and take the little book which is open in the end of the Angel which stands upon the sea and upon the Earth let's say a word or God or father thank you amen hello Montana now I would like the title uh the sermon the junction of time no let them the theme the theme of this topic is the function of time the teeth and the title is going to be prophesy again so the junction of time and the title is going to be prophesy again I like to read what the prophet says so just stand with just keep up with me now brother Brian in his sermon a door in the door is very unusual but you know sometimes it's on it's sometimes it's unusual things that God Appears in he says God Appears in the unusual because God is unusual [Music] he does unusual things [Music] he appears at unusual times so I'm going to go down when we get into a usual trend of things we miss God when we try to get into a trend our things we miss God what are the trend of things it's a it's a it's a it's a [Music] [Music] let's expect foreign [Music] so now they were waiting they were asking what was he going to do [Music] in other terms look look at what I'm about to do now this is the part that God loves me Jesus looks at the man and he says he says uh stretch out your hands the question I'm asking myself did Jesus know that that hand was dry or not is now the Bible says uh happy [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] stretch out [Music] the angel went in the pool in foreign I don't know about you can't be a problem [Music] that's a quick action we find people he said oh if I was in a meeting but I won't read the search they're healing okay can you say man he says to try no [Music] [Music] that's the most important thing today it's just so quiet there yeah foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my theme is [Music] it's every disposition foreign he will always manifest his powers he always manifests his powers that's the first thing [Music] he continues in a junction of time yes [Music] [Music] now the king Hezekiah was in under the dominance of the Kingdom they had to pay a tribute Oh What A series to the king of Assyria no what is it just a monkey now the king is a coyote did not pay his tribute and the king of Assyria got mad he said who do you think you are second king verse 18. verse to verse he says he told him the great king the king of Isis Syria in which trust are you are you are you putting yourself on who are you dead for meat woman that for me to for for me to for you to confront me for me for you to come from what is this power what is this trust that you're praying yourself he says you said that you must have proof you must be careful and have the power amen but those are just being vain words in whom did you put your trust on YouTube [Music] I'm [Music] he he foreign God said that the problem is [Music] if you foreign to get what you want online we have we have raised uh Christians Christians who are who act like women that means you have to give them everything even Jesus who are you for you not to suffer yeah I raised my eyes [Music] [Music] you have a bad annoying if you're there that means good Devils stand up yeah tell the devil whether you want it he says foreign it knew they knews that he's going to receive and he will go back to his country [Music] and I'm gonna make him fall by before now God is speaking course no matter what I see concerning the king he says go tell him when he rises she go watch she go take a shower I see him [Music] [Music] you have touched me they're strong without even fighting the same Prophet want to tell him fix your house you're gonna die very soon Isaiah said that everyone was aware now look at the reaction the moment as soon as Isaiah turned his back and left brother says you're now more than a child of God than me the only difference go back [Music] foreign I'm gonna put a challenge so I'm not there this morning at the end pray let's do my portion next Sunday one year you're gonna come here and testify Rebecca the problem is we don't believe in our prayers but prayer change his things I love it so now we're talking about the junction we get to where Jesus himself comes on earth when we're in a junction of time God don't Manifest this episode has to manifest his powers the angels have to come down Prophet has to appear now Jesus Grant in the city and he opens the scroll the Pharisees were shocked oh this guy doesn't know how to read there's a comma right there he was supposed to finish now they saw Jesus dude stand up he said guys can't finish what you started now Jesus comes there instead of reading he closes and he says today this word of the scripture that you have heard and are complete it's fulfilled that's a complete how did that scripture because what he was reading left the scroll and became a man walking he says nobody goes that way because at the end of that road there is a fool so now listen to the reaction of the Demons okay okay foreign [Music] do you think that God will not Grant you something there's a problem if God is able to Grant a wish of a demon [Music] like any other that all he has to do something say the word um [Music] about yesterday oh I'm sorry I love it Brothers wonderful brother says here here here I am all readers of the Bible that reads the Bible know that God M loves God M laws display his power he puts you in a situation it's written right there that's why you don't think with God going to understand and then he says the situation that you're in I'm gonna get you out of it self it's the god that we share so brother Bradman continues foreign [Music] the junction of time foreign The Prostitute women shocks people sometimes they caught her in adultery that means that day even if she didn't want to do it she committed adultery I mean so they caught her they know what they knew what to do with an adulteressor but why do they want to send this adulterous woman oh they said we're gonna see what he's going to say because in their hearts it became a man what do you say on our business we need your final decisions the one who has never seen let him throw the first stone spotty they all laughed and Jesus told me where are your accusers I'm not accusing you go in the best place and don't sin no more that word set her free party that means that she can no longer go and sin because the omnipotence she's finished washing the clothes the hair of Jesus crying she was crying in pain if now Jesus student said I know that your sins are made and then he looked at Simon I got into your house Simon but you didn't take care of me but because you said it from a woman left stand up go problem I don't know your problems because I can't help you but there is someone who can help you so when they say speak so you say the angel had to be on the Earth go get the book that's in the end of the angel don't take the book to put it you just put it on your desk at home go and eat the
