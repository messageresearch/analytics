[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen amen amen we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and uh we're so happy to be here this morning Amen to fellowship with you amen amen we'll uh go straight to the word and uh open our Bibles in the Book of Romans Romans chapter 8 verse 18-23 Romans chapter 8 verse 18-23 amen uh today what we'll do will just uh uh place a foundation of the of the teaching that we're about to do here and by the grace of God if next time we were to come we will continue from amen amen Romans chapter 8 verse 18-23 romen the Bible says that for I reckon that the suffering of of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the create of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God the faith for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now verse 22 for we know that the whole creation the whole creation granth and travelleth in the pain in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body amen I'll read the verse 23 again and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body amen let's pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we we thank you Father for everything that you have been to us Lord father God now we read your word now we asking you father to come down and expend it to us father Lord you know that me as a as a human being I cannot do it father so I I am depending on you Lord father I pray father God that you help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit Lord so that I can say what you want me to say father Lord I also pray father God that you bless the hearts that will hear this word God Lord let this word father God help us to become Sons and Daughters of God lord to know who we are and what we capable of Lord we thank you for everything Lord we give you this service father come God and speak to us Lord thank you father in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated amen so this morning uh for a little time here for a little time we will be talking about uh a subject called adoption amen but uh we will not really get into it like into the adoption part so we will start by placing a foundation first and then from there we will move to uh wherever God will lead us so the adoption that will be that what we'll be talking about amen because the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 where we read that the creation is waiting for us amen the creation is waiting for the Sons and Daughters of God to be manifested amen the creation is waiting for us to go before the fall amen and Paul goes on and says that even it's not only the creation even ourselves amen even ourselves we waiting for our own adoptions the redemp of our bodies amen so to start to start us off amen we have to go back to the beginning amen we have to go back to the creation so we know that in the creation before before God created man amen the prophet says that he was Elohim amen which means the self-existing the one who existed by himself so that was God before so in that stage amen he created the the Earth he created a universe he created the trees and everything but he felt himself he was lonely amen he was in a need of Fellowship amen he was wanting somebody to talk to amen he wanted to have someone who looks like him amen he wanted to have someone who has the same nature as him amen he wanted to have someone that he can relate to because the nature I mean the animals amen they don't look like him amen animals they don't have the same nature as him amen animals don't have his image amen so then then here in Genesis 1 verse 26 then God decided Amen to create a man and then the prophet said that when he created a man amen he left from being Elohim Amen to become Yahweh or Jehovah which means amen God who exists with his family because he wanted a family amen he wanted somebody to talk to now here in Genesis chap 1 verse 26 amen we'll stay in here uh for for a while now amen the Bible says Genesis 1: 26 and God said let us make men in our image after our like and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth amen here God said let us amen the prophet said that he was talking to his attributes if you read the question and answer on Genesis the prophet says that the father was talking to the son Amen Let us make men in our image am to make someone who's like us amen someone who looks like us amen the prophet said that he made an amateure God Amen someone who was like him amen because if we read in I believe John chapter we're not going to read it but amen John chapter 4: 23 to 25 amen the Bible tells us that God is a spirit so everyone who worships who worship God has to worship Him in spirit and in truth so when God said that let us make men in our image in our likeness amen the man that he made amen he wasn't this body amen he was a spirit man amen he was a man like him amen who looked like him amen who talked like him amen Who Walks Like Him amen who resembled to him amen because he was making him in his own image Amen to be like him so now this man the first man we're going to refer him as the first man amen God says that let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air and over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creeping things that creepeth upon the Earth verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created them amen he created them so now notice one thing here when God created this first man the spirit man amen he gave that Spirit man Dominion amen he gave that man government he made him a governor amen Dominion amen he he gave him Authority Amen to rule over the entire cre creation amen that was the spirit man amen the prophet says that it's the same thing as the Holy Spirit am the Holy Spirit who's also the son of God God made the God gave the Holy Spirit dominion over over the church amen to rule over the church so that's the same thing that God did with this man so now if we go to uh Genesis chapter 2 because if you read Genesis 1 amen after God created everything amen verse 31 the Bible says of Genesis 1 and God saw everything that he had made and he and and behold it was very good amen God created everything and he saw that everything was perfect but one thing was missing because if we turn to Genesis chapter 2 let's read verse uh five let's start from verse five amen God created in Genesis 1 he created everything and he saw everything was good perfect but one thing was missing so now in verse five of Genesis chapter 2 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb let's start verse four to make more sense these are the generations of the heavens and and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before he grew for the Lord God had not caused it to to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to teal the ground amen here God created everything in Genesis one amen he created everything and he was perfect amen but then God noticed that there is something missing amen I have the soil I have the trees and the herb and everything they're about to grow but I'm missing something I am missing a man a physical man to teal the soil Amen to teal the ground amen he was missing that man amen to do the labor work because remember the first man that God created amen he was not created to do the labor work amen the first man that God created amen he was created to have dominion amen he was created to rule so then after ruling God noticed that the Earth needed some work so verse six the Bible continues and said that but there but there went up a Mis from the earth and water the the the whole face of the ground amen so because we know that before Noah amen he didn't rain before Noah amen so the way God did for that uh uh those herb and trees and everything to grow he pulled water from the ground amen up Amen to for it to uh uh uh uh uh uh for for it to uh to help for that for those uh for those trees to grow up very fast so now verse seven and the Lord God after he noticed that we needed something a man to teal the to teal the ground now verse seven and the Lord God formed a man formed men of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and this man we will will refer him to uh as the second man amen now look at the difference here Amen in Genesis 1 verse 26 the Bible said that God created a man amen to create means to bring something into existence amen he created that first man amen he brought him into existence amen he created him in his own image and in his own likeness amen amen and and but the second man he did not create the second man amen the Bible says that the second man he formed the second man amen and forming to form means that to put things together amen into a certain form amen because if you read the Bible here he said that he formed That Man Out of the Dust of the ground amen he put things together Amen to make something out of it so the second man was not created the second man was formed amen then God breathed into that man that was formed in other words what it means amen God took the first man that he created amen he put it into the second man that was formed amen and that second Man became a living Soul am with the spirit of the first man amen so now if we continue verse 15 of Genesis chapter chapter 2 now God put that second man into the garden and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to do what to dress it and to keep it amen the first man was was there to rule but the second man amen was there as a steward of the earth amen he was there to keep it amen to dress it and then also one thing here when God created the first man if you read that God created that man God never gave that first man any condition God never set conditions to the first man because that first man was in his own image he knew that that first man will never fall he knew that that first man will never sin because it's the spirit amen it's after his own imageen is after his own likeness but when God created the second man then God put a condition to that second man the prophet says because because the second man was not created in the image of God Amen but he was created in the image of an animal amen so he was amen he was he was he was destined to sin amen amen to rebel against amen so that's why God put condition amen saying that and the Lord God verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying every tree of the garden thou May thou May freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for the day you will eat that day you will die amen the first man amen did not have any condition amen he had the authority amen he had a dominion over the earth and the things that are therein amen the first man amen was made in the image of Goden he was the amateur God amen but the second man amen was a steward of the earth amen he was given a condition to eat everything except for the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen so let's read what the prophet says here D Amen in the uh in the adoption part one amen the prophet says here and God say let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air oh sorry that I was reading the Bible my bad so now here the prophet here says when God made man or before he made man he called himself Elohim the word means in Hebrew the self-existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence there ever was self-existence one Elohim means the all sufficient all powerful Almighty self-existence one Amen in Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 the Bible says that the in the beginning the Earth was void and and and without a form amen the Earth did not have anything amen the prophet says that even in the emptiness of the earth amen the God was there amen the spirit of God was there amen even in that emptiness of the earth amen because he was the self-existence one the one without a beginning the one without an End Amen the all powerful one amen the all sufficient the almighty the self-existence one now the prophet continues and says but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am Yahweh Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existence I the all existence one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine amen I don't know if you're getting this amen the prophet said that I am the the self-existence one amen who has created something off of myself amen the prophet says amen that the logos came out of the father came out of God Amen and out of the logos came out of the logos amen so the logos came out of the father came out of God and man you and me amen we came out of the logos amen which means amen we are that we have the same nature we have the same attributes so that's why the first man amen was given dominion over the Earth the first man had the authority over the Earth because he had the same nature as the logos he had the same nature as the one who created everything amen the prophet says amen who has created something off of myself Amen to be a son of mine amen or a a temporary or an amateur little one of mine amen for me to have a son who has my DNA amen that son has to come off has to come out of me amen if I go and I adopt another son another person son I might call that person my son my DNA for him to have my DNA amen that son has to come out of me amen so that's why God the first Man was created created in his own image Amen in his likeness for him to be like God Amen to be a smaller God a smaller version of himself amen having the same DNA amen the one who has I have created something off of myself Amen to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine Glory why he gave man Jehovah means he gave men to be an amateur God because he is the father God he made man he made a man an amature God so he is he is not self-existence anymore amen now he exists with his family he's no longer the lonely God that was in the creation before he's no longer the lonely God who was looking for a fellowship but now that lonely God now has a family he's no longer The God Who Exist by himself he's now a God who exists with his family that's the reason why he was coming down in the cool of the day amen to talk with Adam have that fellowship with Adam because adamen was an adopted son it was a son who was adopted it was a son who who reached the maturity he was a son who had the power to govern the Earth amen he was an amateur God Amen so that's the reason why amen Adam could see an animal so big with his Trump going like this and says that you calling you an elephant and the father looks at him and he says that Amen to this this is exactly what I was thinking about this is the the the name that I had in my mind but you took it out of me amen because Adam amen was the same thing as the father Adam amen he had in him the spirit Man Who had who was in the image of the father amen the prophet says if I can jump ahead amen the prophet says in he here hear him I believe all right he say it says here here he him the 56 amen he says that then after that the father then taken his son out and robbed him in a beautiful robe robbed him in a beautiful Rob amen this is after because when you understand about adoption amen after the fall amen man lost his place amen man lost his power he lost his he lost everything that he had in theen so now to restore the man to the place where he was God sent a tutor Amen to teach that kid that son Amen to become a mature son so now after the lesson is done the prophet says that now he will take his son out and robed him in a beautiful robe and set him out before the public as an example as an ins amen and all man estation and declared this is my son and he has received in the ceremony the rights Amen in other words his name on the check will be just as good at the bank as his own father's name before he was a hair of all things Amen in other words amen the name of the son will be as good as the name of the father amen so that's why Adam could have done all this things amen because the word of the son was as powerful as the word of the father because the son was adopted the son was given the full right am the son was given the full leadership Amen to do things as he see pleased because the father had trusted his son was to confidence in his son that the son would never disappoint him that's why he let the devil go to job because job was not just some type of just some simple human being was a type of an adopted son to know that no matter what happens to him amen I know that job I have my full confidence in job no matter what happens to him job will never forsake me job will always be there for me so you Satan you can go to him am go tempt him amen go prove that what I'm saying is right so that's why you have problems coming to you amen some problems it's not just because you've sinned some problems is because the tutor amen who is the holy spirit amen he wants to make sure that you're mature enough am he will let you go through things the way you will handle those things am he will go back to the father and say father your hair he's growing up very good amen I let him go through this amen I took the loved one from him amen but he did not forsake you amen he went ahead and he praised your name amen I took the job I took I took I took money away amen but he kept on going with your word the tutor always brings report to the father amen he brings the report to the father amen of your progress am everything that you do amen it goes to the father it said that here's the progress of your son amen today was challenge 101 amen I let somebody criticize him amen and and I let him hear how people were criticizing him am to see his reaction Amen to see if he's going to forgive amen I let someone insult him Amen to see how he's going to respond amen I let somebody slapped him to see how he's going to respond and your response amen the tutor will take it and bring it to the father and say father he's this was his response amen this what he did amen and then from those from those report the father now will judge is it really good for me to give him the full Authority because the Bible the adoption amen means the placement amen you can't receive the Holy Spirit you can receive the holy spirit amen you can be baptized with the holy spirit amen and still be lost amen but when you are an adopted son amen that's something different amen you receive the Holy Spirit amen that's the beginning of your journey amen now you are a son amen you are that little boy amen you have now to go through uh uh you have now to go through tutoring amen and then when you become a man that's when you get adopted amen when I said that if you receive the Holy Spirit say can be lost the prophet said that when you receive the holy spirit in your spirit but not in your soul yeah cuz if you receive the holy spirit in your spirit you still can go to hell amen if you can look at it in the uh events made clear by the prophecy the prophet talks about amen amen amen to continue here Amen in question and answers in on Genesis chapter uh paragraph 79 amen here now the prophet is making connection between the first man and the second man amen the prophet says here the first man amen is the second man made manifest in five senses amen is the first man is the second man man manifest in five senses see right now you can't touch god with your hands like that you can't see God with your eyes like that amen he didn't give you to do that amen because God was a God is a spirit amen you can't see him like this amen so that's why we see the Bible says that Jesus amen is the man manifestation amen of the image of God Amen he's the manifestation of that God's spirit amen for us to be able to touch him amen for us to be able to talk to him for us to be able to uh uh uh to fellowship with him so the prophet continues he says that now men sinned not in his Spirit but his body this body here amen the spirit didn't sin amen the spirit never sin that's why the the Bible I believe John says that uh oh I forgot I forgot that that Bible verse that you don't it's like you don't see something like that amen amen it's not this body but he's talking about the spirit amen now men sinned not in his Spirit but in his body last [Music] passion amen then when he sinned he separated his from his maker and then God the logos the very creator of of him came down and was made in the image of man man was made in the image of God and then he was made in the image of the Beast amen man the spirit was made in the image of God Amen then that spirit and then God formed man the the the body one in the image of the Beast and he fell this body fell and God came down Amen in the image of men in the man Christ Jesus to suffer pain God could not suffer pain in his spirit amen how could he suffer physical pain in the spirit amen he couldn't do it so God unfolded himself and was made in the image of man amen to redeem the man that was lost amen so that's why the spirit could the spirit go God did not send the spirit to die on the cross because a spirit cannot die amen because that that spirit that when God created the first Spirit the first man amen in other words he couldn't really manifest his attributes when man was a spirit because a spirit does not feel pain amen a spirit does not fall amen the spirit does not sin amen a spirit does not go through what this body goes through so to manifest his attributes he had to form this body of Flesh this body of clay amen for him to manifest his attributes amen so that's why when men sinned and fail amen it wasn't the spirit God who came down but God made himself a flesh amen that resemble to this flesh of of ours Amen to come and to redeem this body that was lost because the prophet said that man sinned not in his Spirit but in his body amen that's why God God had to come Jesus had to come as a man made looking like us amen so when man sin he became now uh a product of time amen he's sted now to get old to grow old amen men started to die amen and when men started to die amen God did not just stop there amen God created two other bodies amen remember in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse1 the Bible says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens amen the prophet says when you die amen let's just read let's just read let's just read this in the message who is this it says that then when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit baby in Christ baby and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theop a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to amen then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell and and he when he died and the souls that were in prison Amen to turn turn them back into that turn back turned back into that theophany amen so how this works when this body here expires amen the prophet says that the spirit man that God made in Genesis 1:26 that man who will jump into another body amen it's not this one amen this is just a temporal habitation of man amen that's what brother bham says amen you know I mean you you you you see me but you don't know who Bram is you don't see the real brand you see me but you don't know who the real Isaac is because the real ISAC amen is not Genesis 27 amen but the real ey amen he's Genesis 126 amen he's that Spirit man amen he's that real Isaac amen because when this body here amen will expire that real Isaac who inside he will jump into another body that we got a Celestial body amen which is also a theop body amen amen that will be the body that we will use when we'll be in heaven amen now notice God did not create us to stay up there amen we are Earthbound amen we are created to be here when God created God gave the man dominion over the Earth and over every creeping things that's in the Earth amen God did not create you to be in heaven Amen in heaven we will only go for a few moments amen that's when we will use our Celestial body then when our time in heaven will be done amen the prophet said that we will come back here on Earth somebody will pick up another body in other words the same Isaac inside we jump into another body amen that we call a glorified body amen and that body will stay here on Earth Amen to rain Amen to govern amen so now where is that body the question we asked amen because the body is not will not be created when you die or when the Rapture will happen no amen the body is already here so now we ask ourselves where is it in questions and answers number one paragraph 264 the prophet says here he says that your glorified body is right here at the Tabernacle now amen the presence of the Holy Spirit which is your glorified condition amen you're glorified you're you are glorified in Christ right now amen those who Justified he also glorified and your own glorified body the prophet says is standing near you right now amen in Christ Jesus to do what Amen to give you a strength like a charge going into a battery amen that's what the that body is doing right now amen it's standing right next to you Amen to give you a strength amen like a charge going into a battery amen the holy spirit is in you amen it is to charge your body to give you new Strength Amen to heal you from the sickness Amen to make you well am when you feel tired amen and all of a sudden amen a strength that you don't understand comes to you amen what is it where is that strength coming from it's coming from that glorified body that glorified body it's like a charging port amen whenever you tired whenever you sick am you drawing from that body you drawing life from that body because that body is eternal amen that body doesn't know any weakness that body does not know any pain that body does not know an End Amen it's a body amen like the body of Jesus Christ himself amen because when Jesus died amen he went he was into a Celestial body Mary tried to touch him Jesus said do not touch me yet because this body this Celestial body cannot be in contact with you wait I have to go up amen I have to get that glorified body and when he got that glorified body he came to Thomas amen Thomas that was that was doubting he said Thomas here's the scars thrust your hand thrusting it means to go in and out which means that body was not just a spirit it wasn't a ghost amen he was was it was it wasn't a ghost amen he was a body that Thomas could touch am and feel something amen because Jesus told Thomas to thrust his hand in that body thrust him means to go in and out Amen in that body amen so that will be your body that you will have amen because the celesti your body am the prophet says that it's like that body where uh uh uh those uh uh uh I believe Saints of old were were asking they're saying that Lord until when I mean no no the the souls that are in the altar amen they had a certain body amen they were there they couldn't touch each other they couldn't talk to each other amen that's why they were crying Lord until when amen they want to come back to this body Amen to be able to have Fellowship Amen to have this physical body so now what is the adoption so when Adam Lo when Eve fell amen Adam chose to go with his wife for for her Redemption amen they lost they lost their placement amen so that's why God now amen has that adoption for us Amen to put us back where we were before the foundation of the world the prophet said listen adoption number two it says listen your adoption is not your birth when you receive the holy spirit that is not not your adoption amen that is not your adoption amen that is your birth amen that is your birth amen your adoption amen is your placing amen it's when when when uh uh you were born we said that when you were born again John 1:17 when we are born of the spirit of God we are sons and daughters of God Amen but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to you for these sons of the last days of the last day you see we were predestinated onto adoption unto means that it's something that you have to become or you have to be amen it's not something that you are right now amen but there will come a time amen where you will have to be that thing so we were predestinated onto the adoption amen means that when we are born of the spirit amen there will come a time amen where we will be adopted in other words we will be placed adoption the prophet says amen God put some as mothers as wife am some as pastors some as teachers amen some as ministers and for and so on amen he said that it's not us putting ourselves amen I don't just wake up and decide to be a pastor no I have to be placed amen into that position amen because it's your adoption amen you just don't wake up and decide to be something but for you God has to place you Amen to adopt you amen into a certain position amen Galatians 4: 1-7 amen Galatians chap 4: 1-7 G the prophet the Bible says here now I say that the hair that the air that the air as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant be Lord of all but is on the tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world Amen but when the fullness of the time was come amen God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law Amen to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying AB father wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of of God through Christ amen when you are a child amen even though you are fear with the holy spirit amen you're not different from a servant amen even though you be Lord of all amen but there will be a time when this child will come into maturity this child will be adopted amen and now he will become a son amen no more a child he will become a son and at that point his name will be as good as the name of the Father the father will go and make a public declaration am the same way he did with Jesus amen this is my beloved Son Amen in whom I am pleased hear he him amen and when you get to that place amen when you get to that level amen there is nothing amen that you can't do fa amen there will be nothing that will be impossible to you amen you will just have to pronounce the word will be done to you amen when you look at Peter Peter was under the TR of Jesus Christ amen Peter was was justified Peter was Sanctified amen amen amen amen amen Peter was there under the under the leadership of God of Christ amen but when God told to send them to go pray for the sick Peter met a demon a demon that he couldn't overcome he came back crying to the father said Lord I don't have enough power to do this Lord I don't have enough power to do this amen Jesus in other words looked at Peter he said Peter wait until you are adopted nothing will stand against you so that's why you see Peter after Acts chapter 2 he was walking at that get beautiful he saw that man amen the Bible did not say that Peter prayed for the man amen but Peter being an adopted child adopted son only spoke a word amver and God have I not what what I have amen what did he have amen he had that spirit of God in him I give to you the same Peter who could not hear someone after praying amen but after a certain transformation that same Peter did not need to close his eyes and pray for 2 hours for somebody to be healed with a simple word pronouncing the word someone who was born could recover his legs and start jumping up and down amen why is that amen is that what Jesus said I'm going to close now I'm going to jump amen and before I do that amen I'll read one more quote which is very important here amen it's found in the believer's position in Christ paragraph 50 amen here's what brother Bram says amen he says that now into his church you that positionally is seated in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen now he's to us amen now you who are positionally seated in Christ in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the prophet says be humble Brethren be humble amen that is very very very important amen he says be humble because someday the holy spirit will speak to you am may call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin on the hillside or in the washroom or somewhere and there will anoint you for a certain service or a certain thing to do amen it's not ourselves choosing what we want to do amen but it's that holy spirit amen who will anoint us amen for a certain service but the prophet says when that time hasn't come yet he says be humble and wait until the Holy Spirit anoint you for that service amen it won't be laying on the uh uh it won't be laying on the hand of the pr or of the Presbyterians or the or the elders or Elders amen it will be laying on the hands of the of God Almighty amen himself to put a new ministry in you amen a new robe on you and to set you out as an example and another demons out of another demons out of torments will never upset you amen it says that it's the work of the god almighty himself Amen to put a new ministry in you amen not something that you have to go look for yourself amen but it has to be placement am so that's what Jesus was telling his disciples am wait he told them to T wa until I put that new ministry in you I know right now you want to do greater things I know right now you want to do great things I know right now you want to do Miracle you want to stop the storm you want to raise the dead you want to do this and that amen but don't be in a rush be humble wait until myself amen I put a new ministry in you until the appointed time I will put a new ministry in you for you to be able to do that that's why Jesus said the prophet says now now notice that's what Jesus said amen that these things that I am doing amen you will do it also am even greater than this will you do you will do amen the prophet says now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out devils devils by by prayer amen but to impart the eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church amen to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took deaded men and women deed and lifted them up he lifted them into a place Amen to be Sons and Daughters of Goden to heal sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers amen men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual in part spiritual and in part spiritual eternal life amen and this it's not only for anybody this is for the adopted Sons this are for people who have reached the maturity amen only them amen will be able to import that eternal life the prophet continues and says how much greater is it to say this sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then amen when Jesus said The Works that I am doing you will do also amen what were those Works am was to stop the storm amen was to heal the sick was to give the Blind Men to see was amen was to to raise the dead amen was to give the legs to walk those are great works they are great works amen but Jesus did not stop there amen but he said greater than raising the dead greater amen than stopping the storm greater amen than giving a creep or legs to walk greater work than this you will do in other words The Works that Jesus Christ himself in physical body could not do amen he's given you now that ability Amen to do it amen because for him to do that the Bible says that he had to go up amen for him to send down his spirit amen so Jesus in his flesh and blood body amen could only do great works amen but the Greater Works was reserved Amen to the adopted kids the adopted Sons amen the Greater Works amen was reserved to you and me amen for you and me to do amen he said that great works you will do but greater than this you will also do now the prophet says how much greater is it to say to this sick woman I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed amen that's a great work amen that's a great thing that's what he was doing then amen but said greater than this shall you do I am going to give you power amen not only to raise him up for a while amen but to give him eternal life amen which will be Eternal forever amen not only to be able to raise him up for a while Jesus went to Lazarus tomb Lazarus was dead Jesus raised him up Lazarus did not live eternally laus after his resurrection end up dying again amen but Jesus says amen but I will give you power not to do only temporary things but to give him eternal life to make this man to become Eternal amen for that man to have no end Lazarus was there was resurrected the daughter of jerus was resurrected am but they end up dying again amen but the greater work that Jesus was was saying was to give eternal life to make someone Eternal amen which would not have an end to be forever the prophet continues and say poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is amen that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life amen what is eternal life the prophet said that eternal life is the life that Jesus lived amen that's the life amen the life that was in him Jesus amen import to others amen he said can a man do that it says a Son of God can not just a simple man but a Son of God a man who has reached the adoption a man who has reached the maturity can is able Amen to give that eternal life amen Jesus says whosoever sins you remit whosoever sins you remit can to REM Amen to them they are remitted whosoever sin you retain Amen to them they are return they retain amen he's even giving you the ability Amen to remit sins and to retain sin you're not just a normal person walking amen other people the salvations of other people are in your hands amen because you have that power because you have that ability amen to remit sin amen and to retain sin Amen in the message that day on Calvary I'm going to close this one amen paragraph 134 amen the prophet says how did they get sins forgiven forgiven Peter answered that question and said on that day on the day of the Pentecost they asked Peter what can we do to be saved amen this is the Peter who was afraid amen who locked himself in a room for 10 days amen being afraid of the Romans coming and knocking to kill them as they killed Jesus this is the Peter who went to pray for a child and that child could not be heal and Peter ran back to Jesus crying and asking why he couldn't do it but that same Peter now people are asking Peter Peter what can we do to be saved amen how can we get what you have amen how can we get that power that you have amen Peter laid down the prescription amen he told them what to do amen for him to impart that eternal life to them for him to be able to remit that the sins of the sins of those people he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for the remission of your sin there is the greater works there is the Greater Works Amen to be able to remit the sins to remit me to cancel amen as if someone never did it in the first place amen you are able Amen to give someone the remedy how to do it you are an adopted son amen so the Holy Spirit which is your tutor amen has given one job to train you Amen to become that one that son that God wants Amen to become that son that that God wants and and every day amen that Holy Spirit is returning back to the father and telling the father amen here's the son amen he's worthy amen he believes the entirety of the word amen he believes in the Seven Seals amen he belied that the seven SE the seven seal is open amen he believe that you are the same yesterday today and forever he believes that the son of man amen who visited Abraham amen he's the son amen who walked in Jesus time who was Jesus amen he's the same son of amen that came down in the last age that's the adopted son he beli the entire word of God so the holy spirit amen takes your reproach Tak your takes your report and brings it to the father father this son is worthy to be adopted amen this son is not worthy to be placed is not worthy [Music] to be placed Amen to a service amen so what is the report that the Holy Spirit brings on your behalf now look at look at your own life when you go through things what do you do are you like the children of Israel amen the little family started complaining amen a little Pharaoh in their back they started crying amen a little red sea before them they started crying almost amen or amen are you that one amen like Paul amen it doesn't matter amen even death comes amen I know whom I am believed amen are you like job amen it doesn't matter amen look at the life of Job if you can give me a few minutes amen job I was telling this to my wife amen I said look at Job amen job had sons that he was praying for every single day amen job was praying for his sons every day amen offering sacrifices so that God can keep his son amen he the God that he was praying to allow the devil to come and take those precious things from him amen imagine the pain that the parents will you wake up in the morning you pray for your son and daughter amen you offer sacrifices for the sins that they have done and the the sins that they will do in the future and then it happens that God takes those precious ones from amen but job was an adopted son amen the Holy Spirit was able to go to the father said father I took his sons from him amen his wife even asked him to curse you amen his friends forsake his friends forsook him amen asking him to curse you amen but never even one day not even a second job cursed you amen he was there praising your name saying that the lord gave and the Lord took blessed be the name of the Lord amen so what is the report that the Holy Spirit brings to the father on your behalf amen it's not only the amens that you see at church amen what do you do when you are criticized when you when you when do you do when people insult you am what do you do when people stepped on you amen what do you do when people kills your ego amen what is your reaction

that holy spirit amen that will help you endure will make you like Jesus Christ someone slaps you on the on the right give back the left doesn't mean that you're soft amen it means that you're different doesn't mean that you're weak amen it means that you're different you built different people can make fun of you amen and you go and you stop praying for this people amen that's the report
