Daniel chapter 12 7 cut offices the Bible says that then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto the unto his counselors did not we cast uh did now we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and say unto the king true O King he answered and say lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the force is like the son of God verse 26 the Bible says the Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego yet Servants of the most high God come forth and come hither then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth in the midst uh of the midst of the fire foreign foreign foreign father God will humbly come before Eternal Grace Lord just to say thank you dear Mercy Lord thank you for everything that you have done for us Lord thank you for everything that you are doing for us right now thank you for everything that you would do for us Lord we come here we came here father God in your presence or to have a good time with you foreign amen amen amen you may be seated I mean uh this morning we have a little subject that we'll be sharing with you that we entirely the Fourth Man In The Fire uh amen because Jesus was the fourth man in the fire saying amen Jesus Is My Friend Jesus Is My Rock Jesus Is My All In All amen when you need a friend you can go to jail amen when you need help you can turn to him when you need something he's already there he's always there to I mean to provide when you need a counselor he's always there president and because they stood for God they were cast Into the Fire foreign because they say that even if we go there and we die we will still praise the Lord [Music] amen they had no idea of the thing that was supposed to happen they didn't know what God had in store maybe people their family members or maybe some of their friends maybe some of them started to cry because it might be the last year maybe some of them started thinking about the great times that they spent together because everybody thought that this was their end hey if I was there too I would I would have thought that this was this is because the fire was already hot and because they stood for God the king requested to hit the fire seven times harder than it was yeah it killed the two Guardians that were outside of that foreign I was thinking coming down here our country listening to the song The Fourth Man in the fire from Brother Orion song even listen to that song and I started to think I was like did God really had to go down in that fire escape look he's God he could have said a word and that fire will be quenched amen he could have said a word and that fire will be you know saying amen he could have spoke the word and the king and all those soldiers were dying instances I started to think I was like did God really had to go down in there he went in there to show you that every time that you go through something foreign [Music] the he says that I was with I I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace is he couldn't burn to him because of the presence of the fourth man says he said that I was with Daniel in the Lion's denial I was identified in there when the angel of the Lord identified him in there God launched the launched the letter I was with I I was more surely with him at Calvary I must be identified with him at Calvary Universe amen I must be there to a place uh uh that were now also was not identified within a Calvary I died with him recovery every Christian Must Die within recovery if you don't die within a coverage you can't be none of this I was there when he died I died with him and then I was with him when he raised out from the dead I come up on Easter morning with him Amen in the resurrection whatever he did I was there with him every believer was the same hey man now here's the question so if you were there with him amen during his lowest time of his life you were identified amen they're at Calvary when he was crying father Juarez Thou forsaken you were there with him amen when he was being beaten down amen you were there with him can't you later amen when he was given the uh vinegar to drink you were there amen when people made fun of him they mocked at him man because he was there naked at the cross Amen in every a stepper away you were there with him Amen in good times and bad times you were there with him so if I was there with him during those times would he not be with me when I'm going through trials if I was with him there at the cross if I was with him there on the cross will he not be with me when I need him the most if I was with him during his best moment and his worst moment of his life amen where would I go where could I go when all the friends are forsaken I go to that Rock of Ages unbreakable Kingdom it's unshakable kingdoms amen when the earth and Heavens will pass away amen but his kingdom will never happen amen and as long as you are in his kingdomen you have not to fear anything amen because you will always be safe is with us he said the Bible says that wherefore in all things he behooved him to be made lock unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people uh now in verse 18. the Bible says therefore in that himself has suffered being tempted pasculars he's able to sucker them that are tempted the [Music] himself he suffering suffered suffered and been paste and because of everything that he went through he is able to sympathize with them that are attempted amen because he knows exactly what it is meant to sympathize that the reason he become this that he might be sympathetic with you when you have your ups and downs and your little incense announced and your Temptations get so great you can't hardly stand it please come he won't forsake you there is not a backslider in the building by what no that God knocks at his heart daily in Japan in the building their God will not knock in his heart daily in Japanese and he would do it as long as you are Immortal on the on this Earth he has loved you was anime and redeemed you amen he will do it for you amen because he knows how to sympathize amen imagine the worst situation of your life amen and when you find that time that situation that you think it's worse amen and you know that that situation is worse I know that God knows exactly how you feel hey because one day he felt the same amen one day you went through the same thing one day he had to go through that same situation amen he knows exactly how you feel amen that's why he's the fourth man in the world is your help when everything feels that there is no happening that's why it comes to your rescue when there is no hope at all amen because he knows exactly how you fast can say amen he knows exactly what you're going through amen you had to do he had to go through it yeah he didn't have to go through that fire you didn't have to go to that fire yeah to show you that he's always there with us amen that we have to be that we have to keep courage amen and know that God is always there with us at the Bible verse I said [Music] stand still amen that's what we have to do amen is to stand still to know that he's got Festival foreign and if you are serving that same God Amen when you're going through that time amen when you are about to be casting that foreign [Music] and know that God will always stand foreign amen I will read the uh the new version of the King James version the King James Isaiah 53 verse 3 to verse 6. is Amen to know that God will always stand in the gap for us and here is an example of it if I see an example in the Bible says that he was despised and rejected by mankind like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised and we held him in low still amen now verse 4 the Bible says that but surely he took up he took up but surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering yet we considered him punished by God and striking by him and Afflicted but it was pierced for transgressions amen he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed we all like sheep have gone astray each of us has turned to our way to our own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of amen the lord has laid on him amen when he was going there on the cross amen we thought that God was judging him when he was there going there on the cross amen we saw that we thought that God was punished punishing him amen nobody was there to was standing alone Jesus was taking our place our places he was going to the cross ES their cross wasn't supposed to be Jesus Christ amen that cross was supposed to be myself that cross was supposed to [Music] [Music] he wanted to go die for us amen so that we can be justified amen he wanted to die for us amen he went and he died foreign started and up until now there's never been a minute there's a big record there is no record of him making a mistake in the Bible amen there is no record of him sinning in the Bible there is no record of him lying in the Bible but he went to Die the most on the the most uh painful death that was received that was reserved for for Tears for thieves and and Robbers for people who are breaking laws amen there on the cross naked prophecy that he didn't have any clothes on him when he was crucial Kings who created good care of survey amen the Fourth Man In The Fire he didn't have to go through that fire amen he didn't have to go to that cross he didn't do anything condemning him yes he didn't do anything binding him to that cross remember when he was given the option to either drink from the cupboard but he said Lord now my will but thy will be done amen as a human being amen he wanted to drink and thank you amen you know he wanted to drink amen as a human being he wanted to throw the white flags and say Lord I'm done with it I can't take it because it was painful he was painful painful through all of them and he wanted to forsake everything and say Lord I'm just gonna drink that coffee but right at that time that you wanted to forsake man he thought of you and me rather that time amen he thought of you and me then he said Lord now my will yeah but I will O Lord because my will I'm forced to drink volunteer I wanna drink this from this cup but Lord not my will by thy will they say Amen right in that moment it's not about you yes he was thinking about it he was when he was lying there on the underground is that thought of you and me that kept him going says amen that kept him going it's the song that shows like you know fake amen if he did that for you amen what else can he do okay can he not do for you amen he will do everything just to make sure that you're safe everything just to make sure that you're happy he will do everything just to make

belly of a wealth maybe because it doesn't matter what you do okay amen it is Grace that's gonna find amen when he says that come unto me you are heavy laden I will give you peace and I will give you rest he knew who foreign he knows how you foreign remember in the Bible Christian family with your backslide to save one person that was Ruth is that three members of that family died just to save one person to save Ruth it took 40 years it took the children of Israel 40 years in the desert amen and become mature and married to someone amen he will do everything just to save you Allah if we did
