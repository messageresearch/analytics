TRANSCRIPT
========================================
broke it he broke it so god had to make a covenant with himself hallelujah yes sir and he made a covenant with himself and he swore by himself yes sir he made an old hallelujah that would produce a bride without spot wrinkle of blemish is not what we can do for him [Music] so when the devil tries to accuse you a locality is thank god for confession somebody help me here confession thank god for confession because when you can confess the blood covers you hallelujah and that's why god give those people give some the holy ghost because he knows they don't mean to do it okay they don't mean to do wrong you know and they surrender all to god who's gonna deliver me where is your stain [Music] oh great where's your victory asked the question paul had the answer hallelujah he said thanks be to god who gives us the uh the liberty who's giving us the freedom hallelujah who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ without jesus christ like david said he's my battle axe he is my battle axe that's what they say amen amen psalm 16. uh some says i know it's late some says oh i'm not even where nowhere i wanted to be but let's move on i'm almost done with this portion but when god came in 1963. on his nephew somebody had the thought that he did not come so i asked him then who was that in the revelation the third chapter is jesus came even when he you know in a way that they weren't expecting him to come he exposes himself he said explosively right and they still didn't know him hallelujah amen even when in the age of his thirties he said the works that i do i can't do these words the father hallelujah he said i didn't come in my own mind pharisees met him at a whale and said to him when the messiah comes he's going to have this gift of discernment accept this be the messiah somebody help me here man and when god came again a conscience just the son of man hallelujah they didn't recognize him because he came in a way [Music] you know always had trouble understanding the scriptures he's losing countries but that's true but in a different time yeah i understand he said in like man i'm coming [Music] the bible said there were two angels but that was moses and elijah hallelujah you said how do you know that because when he comes again to receive the jews hallelujah he comes with the host of heaven and moses and elijah is on the scene then hallelujah but when he came this day hallelujah he wore the clothing of a prophet he was a prophet and he was bailing the very seventh seal he was failing the seventh seal that's why god had him say that there would be he said how did i do that i knew better i know there'll be seven thousands in the days of elijah that did not bow hallelujah but what god was doing he was unveiling the seventh shield and at the same time he was veiling it he was feeling it to the skeptics to the intellectuals [Music] because he said my sheep hearing my voice and a stranger they will not follow hallelujah hallelujah glory hallelujah [Music] but this is this is [Applause] in my books hallelujah is that right brother branham said how about i'm lord look at billy graham look what he's got look at this lord look at all roberts hallelujah look what he's got they got two seconds and god said what business is that of yours hallelujah i am your portion somebody help me here the wealth of this world is not my portion the lord is my portion that's when he descended in 1963 he opened my eyes he opened the eyes because the law is our portion that's what brother branham said he saw that cloud and he said that's my law and if it's his lord it's my [Music] lord glory amen amen hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah correct amen you see because he said the dead in christ in reality amen there is no such thing in your intentions but you must catch the revelation of what paul is the second point is it though your relatives okay though their bodies though their bodies be in the grave they're not there in a supplement hallelujah you see because when brother branham saw those that were asleep they were not in the sixth dimension with pillars under their heads with pillows they weren't up there [Music] [Music] you understand what i'm saying he said they were so real i can't tell you what kind of body that was but one thing i do know i could hug them and there was no sensation somebody help me here so you must understand he was giving us a vision fear death hallelujah he said death has been conquered somebody helped me here and death is just a wagon it's just a cut to pull us into the presence of a glove hallelujah that's why paul that's why paul was caught up [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what he saw it he'll come and tell you that the people is alive and well yeah i'm going to be vulnerable i'm gonna hallelujah until my change come that's what job says about this i'm gonna wait until that change comes just follow me you say will your change come true it'll amen amen amen [Music] glory amen amen hallelujah let me move on let's continue god is good god is good jab on i'm gonna close with this scripture here let me know there's no way i could preach at all this morning to choose and god was so gracious she he allowed her to come back and make a final confession hallelujah amen now she was already there she's an old bill you can't imagine what it's like hallelujah you can't imagine what it's like you've been preaching this all alone but you don't have no idea what it is hallelujah and he said honey she said honey you know where we went wrong you know what mama said don't have nothing to do with that trash don't have nothing to do with that that trash hallelujah and say we should obey the voice of god he could understand and move on with god too hallelujah amen remember god got him you know he was on the ohio river [Music] he was getting ready to go over he need to i put it this way god put him on the pause line lord he said here you see it's amazing said people i don't know what to pray for oh god will not make you know what to pray for what have i done two seconds of faith and then all of a sudden yeah that thing he never [Music] that trash was holy ghost filled people you're not here to do that you don't know what's in inside of somebody somebody help me here amen jacob looked like he was the schneister jacob he looked like the evil one hallelujah but he was the chosen one y'all hear what i'm saying there's a lot of people that really just need the real baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah they'll get it they will get it in god's appointed time hallelujah we are commanded to love one another now that loving one another is judging each other the first thing you should do is examine yourself in the way of you going to hell no but every brother and sister knows that when they're wrong it's afghanistan countries unfortunately they must make it right some things are not easy to make right hello are we and sometimes the devil make you think oh i can hide i don't have to be a preacher like brother branham but god will bring me thoughts may jesus be going right to your heart if somebody talks to me comes with the only person to talk to me is something i look at you understand me don't i'm almost just my last scripture yesterday i get you beginning at the first verse as the heart painted for after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee oh god for the living god when shall i come and appear before [Music] and the blood was on the doorpost application that angel did not say well i think that's blood oh yeah it's red [Music] and know that god will never give you a serpent it's a work if you're asking for bread of the lord but our biggest problem man we don't want to empty out we don't want to pray look somebody said how do you empty out come on this comes with i said you first addressed god in reverence i began to make all known confessions and cry out to god you make it right can you bring me your gift hallelujah and then you begin to cry out to god lord i don't have the patience in is and then if you can't see in the darkness you should ask god reveal the darkness in me if there's somewhere show me lord what it is then when god shows it to you allah [Music] something bring a change m [Music] because sometimes we're confessing things to god if i could be in a human way man and saying what are they talking about they've got my sacrifice because because you don't remember it in a human way you know men right like like for example we use the human term by example lord remember me when did god forget you contest hallelujah what are you asking god when you say lord remember me come for this gift you're saying lord let's say my dear things that you have promised to do in my life please perform them i'm almost done my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god comedy when i remembered these things i poured out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with the multitude that kept holy days why aren't they outcasts but my point is this in closing you know you when the joy of the lord is not there and you see everybody you go i go to church [Music] that means you have not oh i believe in a greater rapture but you know things must take place first spirits hallelujah amen oh my god oh my god my shoulders cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan let's just jump down let's just jump down to the seventh first that's the point i want to make a gallon deep call it unto the deep at the noise of thy water sprout all thy ways in that billows are gone over me does this seven that's the seventh verse that's the seventh verse of that particular chapter forty two seven months [Music] seven 427 okay okay so everybody knows yeah so anyway when we talk about the deep call to the deep wood this is the floor appeal a lot of flow or breathe the zone that is on okay so i'm closing my nose tell me so that you understand hallelujah man you you remember the little boy i believe it was a little baby that was eating on the pedals they were lacking minerals thirst is a driving force [Music] like in the desert so come down to this you'll begin to hallucinate in his hallelujah but the part we play let go and let god say then they say jew and when the devil comes to me and tried to make me think that i'm not going to make it amen [Music] oh and heaven and earth [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is
