[25:55] in his presence

[26:21] so why coming in his house
[26:24] you're not ready to worship Him amen
[26:26] amen
[26:28] and we're not coming to church for
[26:30] somebody
[26:31] not for the preacher
[26:36] a preacher is just a man like you
[26:45] know
[26:46] you know the young people that wants to
[26:49] know this technology
[26:50] we are from the old school
[26:54] we are from all schools
[26:58] may God bless you okay
[27:01] that's it
[27:03] we thank the Lord Jesus this morning
[27:06] for the breath of life
[27:09] to be in good health it's a Grace amen
[27:13] amen
[27:14] um
[27:23] so that you can know how to appreciate
[27:27] that's what I'm saying thank you Lord
[27:29] for the goodness it doesn't have a price
[27:31] it's priceless
[27:34] we thank God for that
[27:37] [Music]
[27:40] and we also thank Pastor Brooks the
[27:42] pastor uh
[27:44] you might call me or
[27:46] on the week
[27:48] and I was I was at work and he I missed
[27:52] his call
[27:54] and then he left me a message that I
[27:57] should call him back
[28:01] and he asked me if it was possible for
[28:04] me to preach while he's not there
[28:08] and I told him that it's always a great
[28:10] joy for me
[28:13] that's why we've been called personal
[28:15] service for each service
[28:20] thank you we thank you for his trust
[28:23] that he put in US
[28:26] and that trust is through you that are
[28:30] working with him
[28:34] if you guys didn't trust us
[28:37] he wouldn't trust us too
[28:41] if the pastor trust us is because of you
[28:44] amen amen that's why
[28:48] uh
[28:49] we don't want to abuse that trust
[28:54] as long as Lord would like for us to
[28:57] come again
[28:58] and we want to stay in the uh in the
[29:02] inner rules
[29:04] in the rules of the king amen
[29:09] that's why we've also spoken about the
[29:11] principle of the world
[29:17] he cannot show the people the principle
[29:19] if yourself you're not living by those
[29:21] principles
[29:24] the principle is to know how this this
[29:27] house works
[29:28] or what the father believes what the
[29:32] mother believes
[29:33] how do they eat their children then you
[29:37] respect those rules
[29:39] when you get into a house
[29:43] you're not going to place your feet upon
[29:45] somebody's table who received you amen
[29:47] amen
[29:49] that's how we're gonna walk
[29:52] because if we have a spirit of Christ
[29:54] we're going to show manifest Christ
[29:57] because Christ is
[30:00] the
[30:02] peace
[30:05] may the Lord be blessed
[30:08] we also thank you who because without
[30:11] you we wouldn't be precious hallelujah
[30:14] amen it's because of you amen amen
[30:21] as it says in First Corinthians
[30:24] he said it's because of you no songs
[30:28] that we are called Egypt
[30:31] hallelujah amen Because of You amen amen
[30:37] and since I've been praying
[30:40] Lord what would I like to preach
[30:48] and what do you want me to preach them
[30:51] amen amen
[30:53] so that was since yesterday
[30:55] that I was seeking for his his will
[30:59] not seeking for the preaching but it's
[31:02] weird
[31:04] because you are on this
[31:06] on this road since 20 years ago we
[31:09] couldn't miss anything to preach amen
[31:12] amen
[31:15] then something came to my mind it is
[31:18] inspiration
[31:23] and this morning what I preach upon why
[31:26] the message of the end time
[31:32] I didn't want to continue with the
[31:34] principle of the world because it's
[31:35] going to take us more months
[31:39] but everything that we're preaching is
[31:41] upon the principle of the word of God
[31:44] but we want to place that like a
[31:46] foundation amen amen
[31:49] it's not a preaching foreign
[32:22] God is looking only to his own word
[32:29] you only look at his words
[32:32] once you respects his words
[32:34] and the word gives you the answer
[32:37] that's how God has blessed it
[32:40] self but it's him who's saying through
[32:43] his Prophet amen amen amen
[32:46] that's why it's more important
[32:51] those who make or realize many things
[32:55] it's not necessarily those who have got
[32:58] a lot of money no no
[33:01] but there are those who respect the
[33:04] principles
[33:06] you see for example
[33:10] you know like the the kind of the job
[33:12] that we're doing is
[33:14] [Music]
[33:16] the base salary is around two thousand
[33:19] three thousand
[33:23] someone else can earn more than that six
[33:26] thousand seven thousand
[33:28] it doesn't mean it's only him who can
[33:30] make more money than you no no amen amen
[33:49] [Music]
[33:53] you go together in your house
[33:56] you can't
[34:02] wait you're gonna realize more than what
[34:05] someone else is anyway
[34:08] I know what I'm talking about
[34:11] amen amen
[34:13] that's the principles
[34:17] you can earn a lot and you don't spend
[34:19] it in the beans and in many things
[34:27] or you are in those things that people
[34:30] are in a showing up like people have to
[34:32] see me I mean
[34:34] we've seen that with the people in the
[34:36] world and they ain't not being poor amen
[34:39] amen
[34:41] but you once you got a vision that's the
[34:44] principles hallelujah amen
[34:46] that's the same thing with the word of
[34:48] God why are we coming to church
[34:51] why God has created us
[34:54] here
[34:57] today
[35:03] and where are we where are we going to
[35:18] Sunday School
[35:22] with their child understanding
[35:27] are you a Christian yeah
[35:32] yeah because daddy said I'm a I'm a
[35:34] Christian
[35:36] I mean
[35:45] Sunday school we are
[35:48] yeah
[35:49] [Music]
[35:57] and then we put
[35:59] we put hey and then we go home yeah
[36:05] that's the Christianity for that
[36:07] children
[36:08] that's the kind of gospel
[36:12] hallelujah amen
[36:16] do I want but it's not that for you and
[36:19] me
[36:20] custom we're not coming to church as a
[36:22] custom amen amen
[36:30] oblige to come to church
[36:37] maybe in Congo you can go to church so
[36:40] that they can give you something
[36:43] nobody's gonna come and seek you home
[36:45] let's go to church
[36:48] it's for your from your own from your
[36:51] own way that you come back because you
[36:53] know because you believe that going to
[36:56] church
[36:57] there's something more important than my
[36:59] sleeping
[37:01] there's something more important than my
[37:03] work
[37:04] change there's something more important
[37:07] so when we're coming to church
[37:10] we should be more serious
[37:13] to get to that goal
[37:16] otherwise you should come to church
[37:20] especially here in America
[37:23] everybody is independent
[37:27] rent for somebody and nobody's giving
[37:29] someone's money so when you come to God
[37:32] you should be serious
[37:34] that's foreign
[37:41] that's why the message of the end time
[37:46] message of end time
[37:51] today with those uh results
[37:55] there's a lot of things going on on the
[37:57] on the uh social media
[38:00] we don't even understand what is going
[38:02] on with social media amen amen
[38:06] every people out there they don't
[38:08] understand what is going on the social
[38:09] media I
[38:11] amen
[38:15] there's a bride who's preparing yourself
[38:19] and I believe that bride issue there's
[38:22] somebody who said us with the word of
[38:24] God
[38:25] this is somebody who knows why I believe
[38:29] there's someone who knows why is he
[38:31] going to church hallelujah amen
[38:36] why the end message or the message
[38:41] maybe we can ask a question from
[38:43] everyone here
[38:47] everyone could explain the message of
[38:50] the end time in his own way
[38:53] and I know most of the people are going
[38:54] to speak about Burnham it's a message
[38:58] and what is it that message of brother
[39:00] amen amen
[39:02] God have sent William
[39:04] [Music]
[39:06] talk about the pillow fights
[39:09] maybe we're going to talk about Jesus of
[39:11] men
[39:12] so why this message
[39:20] to bring us what is he going to bring
[39:23] and what are we wearing from this
[39:25] message amen amen if
[39:27] Brandon said
[39:30] you cannot seek for the Holy Ghost
[39:33] if you don't know what you can produce
[39:35] for you
[39:38] why are you seeking for something that
[39:40] you don't know hallelujah amen
[39:42] means
[40:04] the family
[40:07] how are they going to be married
[40:12] how how the how the father could accept
[40:15] his daughter to be married if you've got
[40:16] nothing
[40:24] my daughter just finish up your schools
[40:27] get a job then come and marry my
[40:30] daughter
[40:31] because you're not going to eat peppers
[40:34] hallelujah amen
[40:37] so the job
[40:40] so we know what the job means
[40:44] when I got to work
[40:46] I go to work because
[40:48] it gives me money and makes me
[40:50] independent and once I'm independent
[40:53] financially
[40:55] and just because I've got money
[40:57] I can leave my father's home
[41:01] I can be or with my salary
[41:04] I can be able with myself
[41:08] I can plan my life
[41:11] when I go to church
[41:14] I'll be praying God and looking to weigh
[41:18] our sisters
[41:20] now you're confident
[41:24] because your pocket of money and you
[41:27] working yes
[41:35] you're not gonna play
[41:38] six o'clock you're there amen yeah
[41:44] because I know the consequences of the
[41:45] world
[41:46] the result that the job gives me
[41:50] then I'm not gonna play with my job
[41:51] Hallelujah
[41:54] so the same thing in spiritual manner
[41:57] unless you know
[41:59] you know
[42:01] the result of the thing I love
[42:03] constantly conventory then you'll be
[42:06] concerned and and uh
[42:11] you be concerned Hallelujah
[42:16] when they talk about the Holy Ghost
[42:20] then you know what the Holy Ghost is
[42:23] you know where the Holy Ghost is taking
[42:25] YouTube
[42:26] you know what the Holy Ghost is bringing
[42:28] to you then you want to play with the
[42:31] play with the Holy Ghost amen
[42:36] the message of the end time
[42:39] what is he going to bring to you
[42:42] know the results
[42:44] foreign
[43:14] amen amen
[43:17] why the message of the end time
[43:23] oh we're gonna do with that like the
[43:26] same way we did with the plane of
[43:27] redemption
[43:30] is not important to go fast and people
[43:34] don't get anything
[43:37] hoping that we're still gonna be alive
[43:41] once more guy gonna play something in
[43:44] the heart of a possibility
[43:46] to call me to come and preach again
[43:48] then we can still continue the message

[1:40:44] peoples of God amen amen
[1:40:47] paragraph 141. what I'm saying
[1:40:50] the first thing
[1:40:54] was that God wanted to reveal himself to

[1:41:01] couldn't see he wanted to reveal himself
[1:41:03] so that people may know him amen
[1:41:10] he could not do that being a great
[1:41:14] Jehovah God
[1:41:15] who was covering all the space the Time

[1:42:28] it was to become a son of man hallelujah
[1:42:31] amen God the Father
[1:42:34] becoming the son the son of man
[1:42:39] that's what that was the way to become a
[1:42:41] father
[1:42:42] there is a necessity that's the reason
[1:42:45] why Jesus was saying
[1:42:47] the son of man
[1:42:49] do you see please
[1:42:52] many among them did you know what he was
[1:42:55] talking about but now do you get that do
[1:42:59] you get down the church amen well yeah
[1:43:04] he wanted to express himself
[1:43:09] that was a great purpose that he had
[1:43:11] among those three the six women to
[1:43:14] express himself
[1:43:15] to identify himself through the human
[1:43:19] beings and to reveal himself to reveal
[1:43:23] true crust
[1:43:25] hallelujah amen
[1:43:28] and the second
[1:43:32] to have preeminence upon his body
[1:43:36] the body of the Believers
[1:43:38] which is bright
[1:43:43] so that he may live in people
[1:43:49] after being expressed himself through
[1:43:51] Christ

[1:43:55] comes now in people
[1:43:58] that I is bright
[1:44:01] is church
[1:44:03] and when he's now in his people
[1:44:05] he has a preeminence
[1:44:08] he's the one who's walking with you he's
[1:44:11] the one who's speaking through the beach
[1:44:12] people he's the one who's acting through
[1:44:15] his people
