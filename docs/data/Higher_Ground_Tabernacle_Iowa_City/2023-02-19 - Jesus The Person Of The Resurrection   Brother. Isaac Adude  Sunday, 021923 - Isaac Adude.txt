TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so Martha had to say Amen to that word that Jesus said amen so let's stop a little bit here we will see that Mary and Martha amen represented the sins that are still alive Representatives amen and Lazarus represented the sins that are asleep amen because if we go to first uh Thessalonians first Thessalonians uh uh chapter four um foreign hopefully I can find it all right uh verse 16 and 17 and 18. amen you notice that Martha and Mary represented the sins that are still alive and Lazarus was representing the sense that are asleep so first Thessalon first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse verse 16 Verse 18 the Bible says therefore the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen and then then we which are still our life and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air as sweet and so shall we ever be with the Lord that's the type of Mary and Martha amen you have the living has to happen first before the Rapture resolution amen because the Rapture is only for the bride for the elected for for the elected ones amen so here you will see uh uh let's go back to uh John chapter 11 again amen verse verse 28 let's read verse 28 when when Jesus you know talked to Martha and they had their conversation amen the Bible says that and when she had said when she had suicide she went her away and called Mary her sister secretly the master is come revenue and call USD amen so here Mary was not with Jesus and Jesus was not even in the room amen because Martha heard people talking about Jesus coming amen she didn't wait for Jesus to come in the in the room amen but she rose up and she went to meet Jesus she rose up she went to meet Jesus Christ amen because wherever Jesus was going amen vote noises were already people far off we'll hear about Jesus before himself even so Martha when Martha heard about Jesus coming amen she rose up to go meet Jesus said [Applause] whatsoever you will ask God God will give it to secretary amen and Jesus saw the faith that was in Mars and then he said that you know I am the resurrection and the life amen so now you have to understand that Martha before the resurrection Martha had first to meet Jesus to have to be to be in contact with Jesus Christ amen because Jesus is the person of the Resurrection before the resurrection happens you have to meet Jesus Christ Jesus Christ after meeting Jesus [Music] to comfort to support you to give you strength and all of that but where is Jesus Jesus that you call Jesus he's nowhere to be found when Lazarus was dead Jesus was not here to heal him and Mary was there in that environment amen so nothing could happen to her as long as so Martha after being in contact with Jesus Amen in other words she became the voice of the Resurrection because the Bible said that she wants secretly her way Amen to go call Mary amen he wasn't a public shows amen it wasn't something public she want in the secrets she was using the third pool amen because the first and the second pool was a public is coming the master is coming there's a quote that I want to read yes yeah here Martha became the voice of the Resurrection amen because Martha was representing also the bride representative amen because Jesus Christ was the word amen and you have to know that the bride is the voice amen that is used to call the bride the bride is the voice that is used to call the bride amen I know most of you are looking at me and saying brother I said what are you talking about regardless amen here's a quote it's found in uh laodicean Church in the church amen the prophet said that a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is but my consideration in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word the lutherans spoke the word spoke uh spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for for organ uh the pure the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dogma and Creeds organization and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent wesely and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles red and none of us for their generation when the method is failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day now listen what the prophet says there is again another people in the Land There is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age am I talking about the bride this last stage amen who under their messenger the Messenger will be the final voice of the final age amen he said that yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece its own mouthpiece is so God is turning on her Allah he will confirm her it will confirm her through the prophet and the bride is for the voice of God will be in her pascara talking about the boy yes it is are we for it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17. the spirit and the bride yes say come a a elephant once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word will be reputed repudiated as in the first age amen so the bride is that voice except for that is used to call the bride congratulations she became their voice to go called Mary said foreign of translation foreign amen Jesus Christ had to go to them amen when they will meet him and have that personal relationship amen and then after that the Bible says that they appeared in many numbers amen all the works that they did two seconds amen was not able to raise them out out of the ground was not able to raise them out of the grounds everything there was back then but whoever there was back then two seconds they tell her amen was not able to give them that power to be resurrected Jesus Christ amen who is the person of the Resurrection in order for them to receive their Resurrection in order for their body to be changed Amen in order for the body to be transformed amen so that is the same thing with us Amen in order for you to be resurrected Amen in order for you to be counted among the few okay in order for you to be counted Among The Chosen Few Bobby uh you have to meet him personally I mean you have to meet him personally amen because Jesus didn't go to that house and call Mary yeah man he was in Jesus Jesus to say that the master is here and he's calling for you Amen in other words Martha became the fight for Ministry amen Martha became the father Ministry Amen to go give that good news amen that the master is here that Mary you have to go meet him before the resurrection happens you have to meet him personally here in verse 31. amen the Bible says that verse 31 of the same chapter the Bible says that uh now the verse 30 the Bible says that now Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where Martha met him verse 31 the Jews then which were with her in that house and comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to whip there is so verse 32 the Bible said that then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died amen Mary had the same faith that Martha had married they said the same thing is Lord if you were here our brother will still be alive notice that Mary had to leave that room Mary had to leave that environment Mary had to leave that culture amen Mary had to leave their Church Mary had to leave for that because they were keeping her from going forward amen they were keeping her from going forward amen so if you find yourself in an environment amen the people are there they're keeping you from going forward with Christ [Music] [Music] as my sermon last night that he's the place where God put his name the only place to worship he says that you are not a Christian because you are Protestant you are you are Protestant you're not a Christian because you're Catholic Catholic you're not a Christian because you Methodist Methodist you're not a Christian because you baptism amen he said that you are a Christian because you've been baptized into Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit not by water Papa Lou there is one Faith yeah in for one Lord yeah one baptism and said about them that's the Holy Spirit he says that what a baptism may only inducts you into a fellowship about ten percent this week you were found water but water baptism inducts you into a fellowship okay but the Holy Spirit baptism about ten percentage you into Christ there is the truth amen you're not a Christian because you call yourself a name you're not a Christian because you call yourself a message Believers you're not a Christian because you call yourself a Brandon Knight or whatever you choose you're not a Christian because you call yourself a Pentecost Christianity it's something that is supposed to be alive it's something that's supposed to be lived amen you have to be baptized into Jesus amen calling yourself names doesn't help amen remembering in Isaiah Think chapter 4. amen the Bible is talking about the five women who that was going to a man Allah thank you amen they went to a man they said that we just want to be called by your name uh it's a family or whatever that we're gonna do it doesn't matter to you man two seconds we just want to have your name so if we go smoke that's not your problems if we go drink that's not your problem we just want to become message Believers we just want to be able to fellowship with message to the word that's not your problem that is not Christianity amen it doesn't matter what name you choose to be called the vampire the second place amen that's not Christianity that will not help you at all he was divorced that Abraham heard [Music] foreign that voice that was with them amen they were able to do all those great things I've accepted foreign amen meaning that we have the same God inside of us amen because John said that greater is he that is in you amen then he that is in the world Amen greater is he that is in you so who is in you it's Jesus Christ remember it's the Son of God Amen it's the holy spirit in you so he's greater amen than he that is in the world Amen he's greater than the nature itself amen so he who was the flesh chairman was able to do all those great things amen meaning that now he's a nurse him in the Bible the prophet said that he became our flesh amen he took our flesh amen now he's being able to walk with our feet amen he can only touch with our hands he can only see with our eyes amen he can only talk with our mouth amen amen he is now Tabernacle in Us in other words the men and God has merged them as long as yes amen they have become one amen the bride is now the word the bread is now the word amen because the groom is the word amen and the Bible tells us that one plus one equals one so the bride has the same ability as the same natural as the girls and because the bride is called by his name amen the God has taken the name of the Grooms so the bride has become the world Amen now the bride is able to speak the words Amen to do all those great things because he has big she has become one with the girl even she has become one if the spirit becoming one the prophet says there are three things that's supposed to happen the first thing is a shout what is a shout it's a machine it's a messenger getting people ready getting them together we are here together you say it's a voice of the Resurrection it says that that same voice their loud voice set of War said in Saint John chapter 11 verse 33 verse 38 to 44. Lazarus from the grace is getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead and say it's a trumpet you have a voice you have a shout available now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets amen is calling the people to the feast and that I will be uh and and and that'll be the bright supper is supper with the bride in the sky see the first thing to come the first thing that comes forth is a message is his message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride last second the ones died back in back in the other ages they're caught up together is there why that's the thing that takes place amen it's the same thing that happened you know before Lazarus was was resurrected he meant they had to have a voice a man a voice calling getting the people ready and Martha became that voice Amen to go call Mary he meant to get her ready Mark that they said foreign amen with that Ministry amen calling Mary a mess of the American Experience the same thing that she has experienced very much experiment amen so it doesn't matter how good you can quote the prophet salallah it doesn't matter how good you can quote the Bible says amen you have to experience the same things if the prophet had to have the Holy Spirit you too you must have the holy spirit amen you have to have that same experience amen Martha Mary had to have that same experience than Martha Marie experience to meet Christ himself the Bible said that she went her way and she went and met Christ so if the prophet and where to have the Holy Spirit you must have the horses so being only calling yourself a message Believers doesn't automatically give you the Holy Spirit doesn't give you a Christianity it doesn't give you that that Christianity therefore don't pass it the Christian is my last quote before I close I read the prophet he says it says here we might belong to church we might be foreign people we might be a good character in the neighborhood a fine mother in Baltimore a fine son and Buffy's a fine daughter in bonfi but unless we are germanized with the spirit of God we will never rise in the resurrection it's finished you might be a good person with a good character I became more character everybody speaks this brother is a good brother look you give gifts to people donations to many things there is nothing wrong against it but he said that unless you are germatized with that Spirits you will never rise Paul said that in first Corinthians chapter 13. if I be able to speak all the tongues give all the prophecies but if I don't have the Charities amen and God is love so if I don't have God you all of that it's in vain amen he even went farther away to say that even if I'm able to give my body to me try to imagine you give your body to be burned sacrifice amen that's something that even me right now I don't think that I'll be able to do it memorization people Affair unless God helps me today amen but are you able to do that if you don't have God inside of it [Music] the resurrection happens to Abraham and all the others amen they had to meet Jesus Christ there is a resurrection there's a promise of Resurrection for us amen that we will be rise I mean the dead in Christ will rise again and those dead amen they have to mean Christ first it is word that promise of the Resurrection because the resurrection is not an event but it's a person amen and that person is Jesus Christ amen he is the king of kings he is the Prince of Peace man he's the one who was at the cross foreign he did all of that knock sick you call him with all sincerity you call him serious amen because he hears the sincere heart secures herself so just be honest with him tell him like I always say that tell tell him the thing how it how it is deal with say the Lord you know that this period you know the Bible says that you know I'm not supposed to do it but Lord I love it I love it but the Bible says that I can't do it so Lord I need your help to come and deliver me because myself I can't do it man you tell her the thing to foreign [Music] or not church but to your heart with you whose uh with you who didn't have it to have that relationship because he knows that before you be raptured before you be resurrected you have to meet a person he has to break the bread for you he developed let's sing
