[0:00] possibly
[0:12] yeah you got to love each other
[0:26] [Music]
[0:29] it goes on to say today
[0:32] is what happening are we getting the
[0:36] people to God
[0:38] are we getting them to church
[0:42] hello oh y'all come God sent a prophet
[0:46] then when you give them to the place
[0:48] that God sent a prophet what was the
[0:50] prophet about
[0:56] Jesus
[0:59] why because the system of the
[1:02] Pentecostal world had put him out
[1:10] if he's out according to level
[1:13] a chapter
[1:18] foreign
[1:36] who are they worshiping if you have to
[1:39] come out
[1:58] because I'm preaching it
[2:02] I'm trying to tell you we must be more
[2:05] sincere we must be more consecrated
[2:10] hallelujah amen
[2:22] you asked me that you wonder why I asked
[2:24] that question because the Bible said the
[2:26] only way the worship God is in spirit
[2:27] and in truth
[2:32] we know that the rainfall on the Justice
[2:42] that's why we ought to thank God for
[2:44] elections
[2:48] how erroneous a church is
[2:52] if you're the seed of God God is going
[2:56] to draw
[2:58] God is going to pull on you Hallelujah
[3:02] and once you hear the truth nothing
[3:06] can turn you away from it
[3:09] I don't care if
[3:12] it's too much if everybody in this
[3:16] Fall Away
[3:17] Tom and don't want to serve God no more
[3:20] please
[3:22] maybe in a lot of
[3:25] times
[3:34] I've had a lot of friends
[3:41] you understand me
[3:43] I know it's true even if I don't fully
[3:47] understand everything you know that it's
[3:49] true let me hurt let me move on I'm
[3:53] taking too much time
[3:56] when you come to the church confident
[3:58] that's good but go on to Christ
[4:03] because we must receive this quickening
[4:05] power
[4:07] we ever expect to be in that general or
[4:11] the resurrection
[4:14] because it's the only thing thing that
[4:17] will ever bring us from the dead
[4:23] that raise up Jesus
[4:26] dwell in yeah
[4:31] that's the word of God
[4:33] without the
[4:35] other side you cannot be quicker
[4:41] now I'm going to read too much more but
[4:42] I just wanted to read those things
[4:45] because a lot of times we don't
[4:47] understand
[4:54] but it took an eagle the hero ego
[4:59] lately to understand
[5:04] is that right amen and once the eagle uh
[5:08] cry is is heard in foreign
[5:18] to
[5:20] find out where is
[5:25] Hallelujah amen let me say it like this
[5:28] how many of y'all know that the true
[5:33] is Jesus Christ
[5:37] some of y'all thinking I'm talking about
[5:39] I know let me clarify that
[5:43] I'm talking about the true Eagle
[5:46] the true Eagle is God himself
[5:50] William Branham didn't lose anybody
[5:54] it was God
[6:23] [Music]
[6:26] nothing can change your mind
[6:30] see one thing I love about experiences

[6:37] nobody can take it from me
[6:41] hallelujah amen I remember the first
[6:44] time I saw the pillar fights

[7:01] how can you gonna tell me what I didn't
[7:04] see how much people myself anything
[7:06] about it I wasn't the only one that
[7:08] allocation I think it looks silica there
[7:10] was only 300 people in that tent that
[7:13] saw the pillar of fire Hallelujah
[7:24] listen people because of this message or
[7:28] this revealed word
[7:30] I've seen the dead raised twice

[8:40] [Music]
[8:43] that's the problem you want to use your
[8:46] preachers as a priest
[8:48] you want to use your preachers as a
[8:50] priest
[8:52] but the Bible tells us that we are all
[8:56] priests
[8:57] hello
[9:02] there's nothing wrong with praying with
[9:04] each other
[9:08] but when it comes down to my soul
