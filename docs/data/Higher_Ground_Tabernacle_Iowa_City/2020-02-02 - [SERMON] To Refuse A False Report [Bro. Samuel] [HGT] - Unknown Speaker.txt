Caleb were looking at the promis measures wake eleven Miguel upon us and we know we are a type of Joshua and Kelly a new servant you know so many teachers make eleven we are the royal seed of Abraham Lou similar has last month's wild up how when we look at all of God's promises and oregano to TA Prohm st.jude we don't look at what the situation saying Vega don't particular situation we don't look at what the circumstance is saying like I don't power circumstance we look at what the Word of God says to us Manu Ricardo a second about the Judy because it is only the promise that stands Frances al

compromise could be done who cannot promise do this what so it doesn't matter how situation is the candidacy choice just look at what God says God is the second GID he will condition you if on the condition he will change the environment and rush on here wouldn't even make his promise come to a circus a promise accomplished amen amen so that's what we ought to do say second as the children of Abraham and confront them when we look at what the promise of God says to Allah promised did you just even and get going it was awesome you see Joshua and Caleb Josue a collab they knew the promise that Abraham was given a baby Allah promised his javelin upon the icy shall possess the gates of the enemy Decatur CMOS posted a Harlequin enemy when they saw when they went to see Canaan a low

army trained or not who kiddies and find is many tip on Bienvenue pas they were going to get it easily positively because that's what God's promises say kg is taking a promise to Judy and he never fails in Asia may fight so we have to refuse the false report of a new variable we gotta know the devil always lies but they want some work eligibility human t anything the devil tells you Chuck shows you the geography don't take it because it is a lie I pass it up asked is a team and so on you see the devil is so smart legibly tell my intelligent minute he comes through reasoning olivier de voto rhizoma when you have a situation and you're contemplating come with a valency to achieve ouya that's enough and you think you were the one who's telling yourself if open second si vous vous parlez

even let wrote elephant and he says do use you so you see this this King in you a decayed Chihuahua and this other King they said total war and this other King a cetera I destroyed them jealousy between now I am coming to destroy you know she hinted at weird one and when Hezekiah looked at a common secure surrogate elect it was true City way that's what's that's what's inaccurate sickest in a
