[47:34] their head today and he said I also know
[47:37] it be silent
[47:39] Elizabeth
[47:53] please stay here for the Lord has sent
[47:55] me to Jericho but it says as the Lord
[47:59] leaves and as yourself leave I will not
[48:02] leave you
[48:07] [Music]
[48:13] [Music]
[48:19] Elisha and said to him do you know that
[48:22] today the Lord will take away your
[48:24] master from over you and he answered yes
[48:27] I know keep quiet
[48:29] rest is
[48:42] then Elijah said to him please stay here
[48:46] for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan
[48:48] but he said as the Lord lead us and as
[48:51] yourself leave I will not leave you so
[48:54] the two of them went on sent out
[48:59] the prophet is
[49:09] the sons of the Prophet also went and
[49:12] stood at the sun this at some distance
[49:15] from them as they both were standing at
[49:18] the Jordan
[49:20] hello
[49:31] and wrote it up and struck the water
[49:34] struck the water and the water was
[49:36] supported to the one side and the other
[49:38] the other till the two of them could go
[49:42] over and dry ground
[50:01] every man educator can read your words
[50:09] if your spirit doesn't come to confirm
[50:12] those scriptures
[50:21] [Music]
[50:50] [Music]
[51:02] so that every of us can find a place in
[51:05] this world
[51:08] so the works of the Holy Spirit
[51:17] so we let we let the world
[51:23] trusting our soul unto your hands
[51:26] Christians amen amen
[51:30] you may be seated
[51:56] um
[52:01] [Music]
[52:07] and this morning I'm going trying to
[52:10] talk about the descending of the Jordans
[52:20] as we already started it I don't know if
[52:22] this is the fourth week already
[52:33] and with the help of the Holy Spirit I
[52:36] believe things are gonna go the way it's
[52:38] supposed to go
[52:48] [Music]
[52:51] hello
[52:53] comes available
[52:58] I promised that I was gonna talk about
[53:01] The Descent of Elijah and Elijah in the
[53:05] Jordan
[53:13] Israel you can project uh The Descent of
[53:17] the Jordan
[53:43] and say to him does that know that the
[53:47] Lord will take away that muscle from
[53:49] over their
[53:50] heads
[53:57] in the previous preaching I showed you
[54:00] that brother Brown says better means the
[54:02] house of the Lord House of God
[54:06] means the house of God means Church
[54:10] those who were in church
[54:13] said do you know
[54:16] they knew it is
[54:28] because there were people from church
[54:45] but he was not pleased by the same
[54:48] knowledge that those people had
[54:50] said chicken
[54:53] when they told him do you know that your
[54:56] master would say take away from you and
[54:59] he says I know it keep quiet
[55:04] Elisha needed a higher knowledge amen
[55:10] because they told him do you know
[55:16] people means they knew that Eli Elijah
[55:19] was gonna
[55:20] take it
[55:21] they knew that Elijah was gonna take
[55:24] Rapture
[55:26] and Elisha also knows
[55:32] Elisha was not just pleased to have the
[55:35] same knowledge as there was
[55:38] that's what it says I know it be quiet
[55:54] I will go with you till the end it is
[56:01] in Jericho verse five
[56:07] and the Bible says they were again the
[56:10] sons of the prophets
[56:12] and they say the very same thing
[56:18] do you know the Lord is taking away your
[56:20] master over your head today
[56:31] and the second Church Elisha is missing
[56:33] has no riches
[56:38] Elisha was not pleased with knowledge
[56:43] he needed something that's high
[56:47] he wanted to descend to the Jordan
[56:50] foreign
[57:43] [Music]
[57:49] [Music]
[57:57] in order for him to see
[58:28] they
[58:32] knew the word
[58:40] they stood from distance
[58:52] they came from the school what why
[59:07] it ain't just about to have knowledge no
[59:13] nature of the word yeah it's good we
[59:17] have to have
[59:19] we have to have a higher
[59:22] and that's Supreme
[59:26] shall only come when we cross the
[59:28] Jordans
[59:45] they don't want a cruise
[59:55] yeah
[1:00:00] in order for you to see Elijah being
[1:00:04] raptured
[1:00:05] women yes brothers and sisters
[1:00:28] and they both crossed the Jordan
[1:00:32] uh
[1:00:56] uh those people that knows
[1:01:04] if he's not he doesn't have knowledge he
[1:01:07] can leave the properties
[1:01:11] but I'm not showing this to show you how
[1:01:13] much I know
[1:01:16] I'm showing this because they can't help
[1:01:19] the church that's why I'm bringing it
[1:01:24] we can we get a lot of things to raise
[1:01:27] our people
[1:01:29] but if you have the sense of
[1:01:32] responsibility in you
[1:01:34] knowing what God has called you
[1:01:37] you will have that burden of helping
[1:01:40] people
[1:01:42] that's what makes us sustainable
[1:01:55] that's not what is in my mind
[1:01:58] and behind my mind
[1:02:00] I won each one
[1:02:03] after this service
[1:02:08] so we can reach that experience
[1:02:10] personally experience with God
[1:02:13] so we understand that God is not only
[1:02:15] the god of History
[1:02:19] is not just in the Bible and brushes
[1:02:27] and the same God that said the prophet
[1:02:29] of God in this day
[1:02:33] I think God shall can send a profit
[1:02:39] and just leave us being filled with the
[1:02:43] knowledge
[1:02:46] and nothing has power to uh I felt the
[1:02:50] uh to attack the enemy
[1:02:52] I don't think it's so
[1:02:57] now listen
[1:02:59] a
[1:03:01] a any any machine
[1:03:07] Elijah had worked with Elijah foreign
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:33] well schools of knowledge
[1:03:37] but Elijah didn't take uh Elisha there
[1:03:43] is now every time they reach those
[1:03:45] places
[1:03:47] Elijah told him stay here
[1:03:53] just stay with this knowledge that you
[1:03:56] have
[1:03:59] a little help
[1:04:01] fulness
[1:04:06] he was not pleased with these two School
[1:04:08] knowledge foreign
[1:04:42] foreign
[1:04:51] with his family
[1:04:56] whenever he wants to work with that
[1:04:58] person
[1:04:58] that's why
[1:05:02] Elisha was following Elijah
[1:05:06] Elijah had a permission
[1:05:09] to separate Elisha from the world
[1:05:12] to separate him from the school of
[1:05:15] knowledge
[1:05:17] that was the mission of that was the
[1:05:19] mission of Elijah says
[1:05:25] who do you think there is disease
[1:05:29] in paragraph 52.
[1:05:33] God is a separate
[1:05:37] segregationists
[1:05:39] so I am
[1:05:41] so I am it is
[1:05:46] every question is
[1:06:03] what do we do together
[1:06:06] and he said every Christian is a
[1:06:09] separatist
[1:06:11] or segregation
[1:06:17] if you can project it is
[1:06:23] who do you say it is
[1:06:36] is a
[1:06:39] separate
[1:06:45] our woes
[1:06:49] and he says
[1:06:53] oh God separates his people from
[1:06:56] everything
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:07:00] there always has been a subject of
[1:07:03] segregation
[1:07:09] see God chosen Israel
[1:07:18] he has done all the nations
[1:07:24] but it shows Israel as a nation for his
[1:07:27] own people
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:35] a genuine Christian has to be a separate
[1:07:41] he's he's got to separate himself from
[1:07:44] the world
[1:07:48] and to accomplish one purpose that is
[1:07:50] Jesus Christ
[1:07:52] a genuine Christian
[1:07:55] is gone
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:07:58] always we separate
[1:08:01] he's a separatist
[1:08:04] he always separates from the word
[1:08:08] because God has his father
[1:08:12] always separates his people
[1:08:14] from the rest of the world
[1:08:16] so children were gone today
[1:08:19] is their God
[1:08:22] that we always separate
[1:08:24] from the things of the world
[1:08:27] to accomplish one purpose that is Christ
[1:08:30] Jesus
[1:08:32] so Christ Jesus is our purpose
[1:08:36] if we have a purpose in life
[1:08:38] It's gotta be Jesus Christ
[1:08:41] we cannot have
[1:08:43] another purpose
[1:08:45] if it's not Jesus Christ
[1:08:48] so let's ask our self a question
[1:08:51] everything we do
[1:08:53] in everything we do
[1:08:55] what's the goal we are we pursuing
[1:08:59] downstairs
[1:09:01] in this journey of life
[1:09:04] everything you're doing
[1:09:06] what's the purpose
[1:09:10] because Jesus Christ says to be our
[1:09:12] purpose
[1:09:14] he's got to be what we need
[1:09:17] what we seek the most
[1:09:20] there's got to be Jesus Christ
[1:09:22] so what are the Muslims
[1:09:25] behind this journey of life that you
[1:09:28] have
[1:09:29] foreign
[1:09:33] Jesus Christ is our only purpose
[1:09:36] no matter where I am
[1:09:39] no matter what I'm doing everything that
[1:09:42] I'm doing
[1:09:44] all that I wanna do
[1:09:46] I'm pursuing one purpose that's Jesus
[1:09:49] Christ
[1:09:54] so a Christian God separate from the
[1:09:57] things of the world
[1:09:59] and from everything
[1:10:02] to accomplish one purpose that's Jesus
[1:10:04] Christ
[1:10:06] why do we have so much problems today
[1:10:10] be a church or in her homes
[1:10:14] it's because we have people
[1:10:17] who do not accomplish the purpose of
[1:10:19] Christ
[1:10:21] that's
