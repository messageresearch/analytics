[51:57] and five of them were wise and five were
[52:04] foolish they that were foolish took
[52:06] their lamps and took no oil with
[52:15] them but the wise took all in their
[52:18] vessels with
[52:23] their while the bridegroom tarried they
[52:27] all slumbered and
[52:33] slept and at midnight there was a a cry
[52:36] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[52:40] out to meet
[52:45] him then all those virgins arosed and
[52:49] trim their
[52:54] lamps and the foolish said unto the wise
[52:57] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[53:00] gone
[53:06] out but the but the wise answer saying

[54:57] that we automatically will be
[55:03] raptured but the Rapture comes for those
[55:06] who love
[55:11] disappearing those and it is for those

[55:20] ready see as brother bandam said there
[55:23] must be something

[56:50] it you had nothing to
[56:53] overcome

[1:45:26] something the God is trying to perform
[1:45:30] in his
[1:45:32] church and the church is trying to
[1:45:35] perform by the
[1:45:38] Creed and two can't work
[1:45:41] together you got to get rid of the
[1:45:44] Creed get Christ in you how can you do
[1:45:48] it when he sees the blood when the blood
[1:45:52] has been applied with a sincere
[1:45:55] heart and a hand laid Upon Jesus
[1:45:58] Christ and a heart that's true before
[1:46:03] God to confess his
[1:46:06] wrong and to be born of the Holy
[1:46:09] Spirit then the works of God would
[1:46:13] follow as he said it would
[1:46:16] do Church want to perform through their
[1:46:19] creeds
[1:46:21] and see how many members they can get
[1:46:25] God wants to perform through the power
[1:46:26] of the
[1:46:27] blood to get Christians born
[1:46:31] again that's exactly the difference of
[1:46:34] it do you must you must
