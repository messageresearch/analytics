[45:27] amen amen you may be seated
[45:36] we have come
[45:39] at a time that
[45:44] that is real it how can i say it it's
[45:46] very serious
[45:49] [Music]
[45:51] and and if we
[45:53] we don't allow the holy spirit to focus
[45:58] on the
[46:10] in saint john i so appreciate the lord
[46:13] jesus
[46:17] for the one thing he said there in the
[46:19] 30th verse
[46:24] he said that satan is coming
[46:39] is that there is no darkness in me
[46:43] there is nothing that satan can pull
[46:46] from me
[46:49] to make me fall
[46:52] to make me bow
[46:54] hallelujah
[46:57] [Music]
[47:08] hallelujah amen but
[47:10] man i will allow him
[47:14] to take my life depending on my view so
[47:16] that i might rise again
[47:20] so that the world will know
[47:23] this testimony is true
[47:27] hallelujah
[47:28] see jesus was fully aware
[47:32] of who he was
[47:35] hallelujah
[47:36] and he understood
[47:39] the journey in which he had to take live
[47:42] affair hallelujah amen he understood
[47:46] jesus

[48:07] so that the father was sin
[48:11] hallelujah and we understand who the
[48:14] comforter is
[48:24] [Music]
[48:32] however you
[48:44] like a flood
[48:46] like a flood
[48:54] and
[48:55] the reasons why
[49:00] it's because brother branham teaches us
[49:03] i'm saying
[49:04] that the
[49:05] lid that was once on hell
[49:09] the top the lid
[49:11] that was once on here
[49:20] [Music]
[49:24] and all of the demons
[49:28] that
[49:29] destroyed the world
[49:33] in the days of noah
[49:37] has now been set free
[49:42] we have seen
[49:44] by way of history
[49:48] what they did to germany secondly
[49:53] in that portion of the world
[49:57] and had not god intervened
[50:02] the world in itself would have been
[50:04] destroyed
[50:07] hallelujah amen
[50:08] but god intervened
[50:12] and brother branham tells us
[50:14] that those demons
[50:18] left germany
[50:21] and came to the west coast is
[50:27] they became what we call hollywood
[50:31] song they need to continue west oh come
[50:32] on
[50:33] hollywood now you must understand
[50:37] they have an
[50:38] agenda from an agenda they have a plan
[50:42] for my employ and that plan is to
[50:45] destroy a surplus the bride of jesus
[50:48] christ
[50:50] hallelujah amen remember it was the
[50:53] angel
[50:56] stop the four winds
[50:58] hallelujah
[51:01] from destroying the earth
[51:04] because the servants of god
[51:14] [Music]
[51:22] because now this is the ceiling time
[51:27] hallelujah amen but the demons
[51:30] are moving in such a way
[51:34] they are
[51:49] now when we talk about a flood menace
[51:53] first of all we must understand who's
[51:55] god of this age
[51:59] brother said god
[52:02] he's not god
[52:05] it's not god of this age
[52:09] but satan is god of this age
[52:13] hello amen
[52:14] jesus will be god jesus
[52:27] he is the god of this evil age says
[52:37] [Music]
[52:42] this is the darkness of all darkness
[52:46] [Music]
[52:56] and in his way of doing things
