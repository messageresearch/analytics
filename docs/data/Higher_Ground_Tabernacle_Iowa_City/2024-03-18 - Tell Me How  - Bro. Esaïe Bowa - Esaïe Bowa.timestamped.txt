[45:24] touch so when we leave out of

[45:31] presence thank you our
[45:33] father thank you all
[45:36] Eternal thanks for
[45:38] everything as we
[45:41] pray bless the word that
[45:43] we in Jesus Christ's name amen
[45:48] amen I will ask you to
[45:51] [Music]
[45:54] se
[45:55] uh
[46:02] as of this morning I would like to speak
[46:04] about a
[46:09] question and the title of my sermon is
[46:12] tell me
[46:16] how you know my brothers and
[46:22] sisters sometimes God don't give us
[46:25] explanation for what he's going to
[46:29] do he doesn't tell us this or
[46:33] that how it's going to do that
[46:38] thing why God doesn't do
[46:42] it because God is waiting for
[46:46] us to to believe in his
[46:51] word that's why God surpris us sometimes
[46:54] by
[46:55] events
[46:58] he don't tell us what's going to
[47:01] happen he don't tell us what's how is
[47:04] going to
[47:07] happen but all we see we surprised in
[47:10] the events in the of the
[47:13] event and when we see the things
[47:17] happening and that shows the
[47:21] sity because the Bible
[47:23] [Music]
[47:25] say
[47:29] that God do everything according to his
[47:32] own
[47:33] [Music]
[47:35] Pur everything he does he does it
[47:37] according to his own
[47:40] will so I would like my brothers and
[47:46] sister sometimes we have people among
[47:51] us who wants to understand what God
[47:54] do and how he does it
[48:00] and sometimes we we miss we lost the
[48:02] quality of
[48:05] believer because we will start
[48:08] thinking and
[48:12] reasoning how come God can
[48:14] do how could he do such
[48:18] thing in God's
[48:20] domain we don't
[48:23] culate God calls us believer
[48:28] he don't say that we are
[48:30] thinkers he calls us
[48:34] Believers when someone
[48:38] believes he doesn't wants to understand
[48:41] how not
[48:43] wondering that's God's
[48:46] domain it's God's work
[48:50] himself that God is asking us to
[48:53] do is to believe in his own word
[48:57] that's why he calls us
[49:00] Believers he's calling us
[49:04] Believers we supposed to believe in his
[49:08] word and a Believer is not
[49:12] just but it's an
[49:15] attitude do you
[49:18] know that we have preachers
[49:21] today who fighting because of
[49:25] believers one says
[49:28] he he took my
[49:30] believer because
[49:34] believer Believers has lost a
[49:39] true they just became member of
[49:43] church that's why preachers can fight
[49:46] for
[49:47] them but I'm saying
[49:49] this attitude a belief has to
[49:54] beud that each person has to be
[49:57] to have in front of God in front of the
[50:03] word feel I'm losing my
[50:06] mic if you can fix
[50:10] it now
[50:13] listen and what we call today
[50:20] Believers and those who the preachers
[50:23] can even fight
[50:25] for many has become
[50:28] thinkers they
[50:31] think people who reason up according to
[50:35] the word of
[50:39] God God is not waiting for us to
[50:43] reason but what did Mary
[50:46] do Mary just
[50:50] believed when the angel told her that
[50:52] she's going to conceive
[50:54] her one question
[50:59] [Music]
[51:00] Mary how is this going to be happened
[51:03] because I do not know a
[51:04] man and the angel
[51:07] told the Holy Ghost will come unto
[51:11] you and the holy power will cover
[51:16] you and Mary just
[51:19] believe he
[51:22] said Let It Be according to your word my
[51:25] and my brothers and sisters
[51:27] I want to tell you this
[51:30] morning that God we cannot
[51:34] understand you don't understand God you
[51:37] only

[51:41] this I just surrended
[51:44] myself I looked up on his
[51:47] face and I don't know what he's going to
[51:50] do I want to tell you this
