[36:38] Jesus and uh we're so happy to be here
[36:41] this
[36:42] morning Amen to fellowship with
[36:46] you
[36:54] amen amen we'll uh go straight to the
[36:57] word and uh open our Bibles in the Book
[37:00] of
[37:06] Romans Romans chapter 8 verse
[37:23] 18-23 Romans chapter 8 verse 18-23
[37:32] amen uh today what we'll do will just uh
[37:36] uh place a foundation of
[37:39] the of the teaching that we're about to
[37:42] do
[37:45] here and by the grace of God if next
[37:47] time we were to come we will continue
[37:52] from amen amen Romans chapter 8 verse
[37:56] 18-23
[37:59] romen the Bible says that for I reckon
[38:03] that the suffering of of this present
[38:05] time are not worthy to be compared with
[38:07] the glory which shall be revealed in
[38:15] us now verse
[38:17] 19 for the earnest expectation of the
[38:20] create of the creature waiteth for the
[38:23] manifestation of the sons of God the
[38:27] faith
[38:31] for the creature was made subject to
[38:34] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[38:38] him who has subjected the same in
[38:47] Hope because the creature itself also
[38:50] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[38:53] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[38:56] the children of God
[39:07] now verse 22 for we know that the whole
[39:10] creation the whole creation granth and
[39:13] travelleth in the pain in pain together
[39:16] until
[39:25] now and not only they but ourselves also
[39:30] which have the first fruits of the
[39:32] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[39:36] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[39:39] with the Redemption of our
[39:52] body amen I'll read the verse 23
[39:56] again and not only they but ourselves
[40:01] also which have the first fruit of the
[40:06] spirit even we even we ourselves grown
[40:09] within
[40:11] ourselves waiting for the
[40:14] adoption to with the Redemption of our
[40:19] body amen let's pray father God we thank
[40:23] you for your grace and your
[40:25] mercy Lord we we thank you Father for
[40:28] everything that you have been to us
[40:31] Lord father God now we read your
[40:34] word now we asking you father to come
[40:36] down and expend it to us
[40:39] father Lord you know that me as a as a
[40:42] human being I cannot do it
[40:46] father so I I am depending on you
[40:49] Lord father I pray father God that you
[40:51] help me to be so sensitive to the Holy
[40:55] Spirit Lord so that I can say what you
[40:57] want me to say
[40:58] father Lord I also pray father God that
[41:01] you bless the hearts that will hear this
[41:03] word
[41:05] God Lord let this word father
[41:08] God help us to become Sons and Daughters
[41:12] of
[41:14] God lord to know who we
[41:17] are and what we capable
[41:20] of Lord we thank you for
[41:22] everything Lord we give you this service
[41:25] father come God and speak to us Lord
[41:29] thank you father in Jesus name we
[41:32] pray amen you may be
[41:34] seated amen so this morning uh for a
[41:37] little time
[41:41] here for a little time we will be
[41:43] talking about uh a subject called
[41:49] adoption amen but uh we will not really
[41:52] get into it like into the adoption part
[41:57] so we will start by placing a foundation
[42:02] first and then from there we will move
[42:04] to uh wherever God will lead
[42:07] us so the adoption that will be that
[42:10] what we'll be talking
[42:12] about amen because the Bible says in
[42:15] Romans chapter 8 where we
[42:18] read that the creation is waiting for
[42:24] us amen the creation is waiting for the
[42:27] Sons and Daughters of God to be
[42:33] manifested amen the creation is waiting
[42:35] for us to go before the
[42:42] fall amen and Paul goes on and says that
[42:46] even it's not only the creation even
[42:50] ourselves amen even ourselves we waiting
[42:53] for our own
[42:55] adoptions the redemp of our
[42:58] bodies amen so to start to start us
[43:02] off amen we have to go back to the
[43:05] beginning amen we have to go back to the
[43:08] creation so we know that in the creation
[43:12] before before God created
[43:15] man amen the prophet says that he was
[43:20] Elohim amen which means the
[43:22] self-existing
[43:24] the one who existed by himself
[43:28] so that was God
[43:30] before so in that
[43:33] stage amen he created the the
[43:36] Earth he created a
[43:38] universe he created the trees and
[43:41] everything but he felt himself he was
[43:45] lonely amen he was in a need of
[43:50] Fellowship amen he was wanting somebody
[43:53] to talk
[43:54] to amen he wanted to have someone who
[43:58] looks like
[43:59] him amen he wanted to have someone who
[44:02] has the same nature as
[44:04] him amen he wanted to have someone that
[44:07] he can relate
[44:10] to because the nature I mean the
[44:13] animals amen they don't look like
[44:15] him amen animals they don't have the
[44:18] same nature as
[44:20] him amen animals don't have his
[44:24] image amen so then
[44:27] then here in Genesis 1 verse
[44:33] 26 then God
[44:36] decided Amen to create a man and then
[44:40] the prophet said that when he created a
[44:42] man amen he left from being
[44:47] Elohim Amen to become
[44:49] Yahweh or
[44:51] Jehovah which means amen God who exists
[44:55] with his family
[44:58] because he wanted a
[45:00] family amen he wanted somebody to talk
[45:04] to now here in Genesis chap 1 verse
[45:08] 26 amen we'll stay in here uh for for a
[45:11] while
[45:13] now amen the Bible says Genesis 1:
[45:18] 26 and God
[45:20] said let us make men in our
[45:25] image after our like
[45:28] and let them have dominion over the fish
[45:31] of the
[45:32] sea and over the foul of the
[45:35] air and over the
[45:37] cattle over all the Earth and over every
[45:42] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[45:46] Earth amen here God said let
[45:49] us amen the prophet said that he was
[45:52] talking to his
[45:55] attributes if you read the question and
[45:57] answer on
[46:00] Genesis the prophet says that the father
[46:02] was talking to the
[46:04] son Amen Let us make men in our
[46:08] image am to make someone who's like
[46:12] us amen someone who looks like us amen
[46:16] the prophet said that he made an
[46:17] amateure
[46:20] God Amen someone who was like him amen
[46:24] because if we read in I believe John
[46:26] chapter
[46:29] we're not going to read it but amen John
[46:31] chapter 4: 23 to
[46:35] 25 amen the Bible tells us that God is a
[46:40] spirit so everyone who worships who
[46:43] worship God has to worship Him in spirit
[46:45] and in
[46:49] truth so when God said that let us make
[46:51] men in our
[46:54] image in our likeness amen the man that
[46:57] he
[46:58] made amen he wasn't this
[47:01] body amen he was a spirit man amen he
[47:05] was a man like
[47:07] him amen who looked like him amen who
[47:11] talked like him amen Who Walks Like Him
[47:14] amen who resembled to him amen because
[47:17] he was making him in his own
[47:20] image Amen to be like him so now this
[47:25] man the first man we're going to refer
[47:27] him as the first man amen God says that
[47:31] let us make men in our
[47:33] image after our
[47:35] likeness and let them have
[47:38] dominion over the fish of the
[47:42] sea over the foul of the air and over
[47:45] the cattle over all the Earth and over
[47:50] every creeping things that creepeth upon
[47:52] the
[47:53] Earth verse 27 so God created man in his
[47:57] own
[47:58] image in the image of God created he
[48:02] him male and female created
[48:07] them amen he created
[48:10] them so now notice one thing here when
[48:14] God created this first man the spirit
[48:18] man amen he gave that Spirit man
[48:22] Dominion
[48:27] amen he gave that man government he made
[48:30] him a
[48:32] governor amen
[48:34] Dominion amen he he gave him
[48:38] Authority Amen to rule over the entire
[48:41] cre
[48:43] creation amen that was the spirit
[48:46] man amen the prophet says that it's the
[48:48] same thing as the Holy
[48:51] Spirit am the Holy Spirit who's also the
[48:54] son of God
[48:56] God made the God gave the Holy Spirit
[48:58] dominion over over the
[49:02] church amen to rule over the
[49:05] church so that's the same thing that God
[49:07] did with this
[49:09] man so now if we go to uh Genesis
[49:13] chapter
[49:16] 2 because if you read Genesis
[49:20] 1 amen after God created
[49:23] everything amen verse 31 the Bible says
[49:26] of Genesis
[49:28] 1 and God saw everything that he had
[49:32] made and he and and behold it was very
[49:40] good amen God created
[49:42] everything and he saw that everything
[49:45] was
[49:46] perfect but one thing was
[49:49] missing because if we turn to Genesis
[49:53] chapter 2
[49:57] let's read verse uh five let's start
[49:59] from verse
[50:01] five amen God created in Genesis 1 he
[50:04] created
[50:06] everything and he saw everything was
[50:09] good
[50:10] perfect but one thing was
[50:12] missing so now in verse five of Genesis
[50:15] chapter
[50:16] 2 and every plant of the field before it
[50:21] was in the earth and every herb let's
[50:24] start verse four to make more sense
[50:29] these are the generations of the heavens
[50:31] and and of the earth when they were
[50:38] created in the day that the Lord God
[50:41] made the earth and the
[50:45] heavens and every plant of the field
[50:48] before it was in the earth and every
[50:51] herb of the field before he grew for the
[50:54] Lord God had not caused it to to rain
[50:57] upon the Earth and there was not a man
[50:59] to teal the
[51:10] ground amen here God created everything
[51:14] in Genesis
[51:17] one amen he created everything and he
[51:19] was
[51:21] perfect amen but then God noticed that
[51:23] there is something missing
[51:26] amen I have the soil I have the trees
[51:29] and the herb and everything they're
[51:31] about to
[51:34] grow but I'm missing
[51:37] something I am missing a
[51:40] man a physical man to teal the
[51:44] soil Amen to teal the
[51:47] ground amen he was missing that man amen
[51:51] to do the labor
[51:53] work because remember the first man that
[51:55] God created
[51:58] amen he was not created to do the labor
[52:01] work amen the first man that God
[52:04] created amen he was created to have
[52:09] dominion amen he was created to
[52:12] rule so then after
[52:15] ruling God noticed that the Earth needed
[52:18] some
[52:19] work so verse six the Bible continues
[52:23] and said that but there but there went
[52:25] up a Mis from the earth and water the
[52:28] the the whole face of the
[52:37] ground amen so because we know that
[52:40] before
[52:41] Noah amen he didn't rain before
[52:44] Noah amen so the way God did for that uh
[52:48] uh those herb and trees and everything
[52:50] to
[52:53] grow he pulled water from the ground
[52:58] amen
[52:59] up Amen to for it to uh uh uh uh uh uh
[53:04] for for it to uh to help for that for
[53:07] those uh for those trees to grow up very
[53:14] fast so now verse
[53:16] seven and the Lord
[53:20] God after he noticed that we needed
[53:22] something a man to teal the to teal the
[53:25] ground
[53:29] now verse seven and the Lord God formed
[53:32] a
[53:33] man formed men of the Dust of the
[53:39] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[53:42] the breath of
[53:45] life and Man became a living
[53:49] soul and this man we will will refer him
[53:53] to uh as the second man
[53:58] amen now look at the difference
[54:01] here Amen in Genesis 1 verse
[54:06] 26 the Bible said that God created a
[54:10] man amen to create means to bring
[54:13] something into
[54:16] existence amen he created that first
[54:20] man amen he brought him into
[54:23] existence amen he created him in his own
[54:26] image and in his own
[54:29] likeness amen amen and and but the
[54:32] second
[54:34] man he did not create the second
[54:37] man amen the Bible says that the second
[54:39] man he formed the second
[54:44] man amen and forming to
[54:47] form means that to put things
[54:51] together amen into a certain form
[54:56] amen because if you read the Bible here
[54:59] he said that he formed That Man Out of
[55:02] the Dust of the
[55:06] ground amen he put things
[55:09] together Amen to make something out of
[55:12] it so the second man was not
[55:17] created the second man was
[55:21] formed amen then God
[55:25] breathed into that man that was
[55:29] formed in other words what it
[55:32] means amen God took the first
[55:36] man that he created amen he put it into
[55:40] the second man that was
[55:44] formed amen and that second Man became a
[55:48] living
[55:49] Soul am with the spirit of the first
[55:53] man amen so now if we continue
[55:57] verse 15 of Genesis chapter chapter
[56:03] 2 now God put that second man into the
[56:06] garden and the Lord God took the
[56:09] man and put him into the Garden of
[56:14] Eden to do what to dress it and to keep
[56:19] it amen the first man was was there to
[56:25] rule but the second
[56:28] man amen was there as a steward of the
[56:35] earth amen he was there to keep
[56:38] it amen to dress
[56:43] it and then also one thing
[56:46] here when God created the first
[56:50] man if you read that God created that
[56:53] man God never gave that first man any
[56:59] condition God never set conditions to
[57:02] the first
[57:04] man because that first man was in his
[57:07] own
[57:09] image he knew that that first man will
[57:11] never
[57:13] fall he knew that that first man will
[57:15] never
[57:16] sin because it's the spirit amen it's
[57:20] after his own
[57:22] imageen is after his own likeness
[57:26] but when God created the second
[57:29] man then God put a condition to that
[57:32] second
[57:33] man the prophet says
[57:36] because because the second man was not
[57:39] created in the image of
[57:42] God Amen but he was created in the image
[57:45] of an
[57:47] animal amen so he was amen he was he was
[57:51] he was destined to
[57:54] sin amen amen to rebel
[57:58] against amen so that's why God put
[58:02] condition amen saying that and the Lord
[58:05] God verse 16 and the Lord God commanded
[58:08] the man
[58:11] saying every tree of the
[58:14] garden thou May thou May freely
[58:17] eat but of the tree of the knowledge of
[58:20] Good and
[58:23] Evil thou shall not eat of it
[58:27] for the day you will eat that day you
[58:29] will
[58:31] die amen the first
[58:33] man amen did not have any
[58:37] condition amen he had the
[58:39] authority amen he had a
[58:42] dominion over the earth and the things
[58:45] that are
[58:47] therein amen the first man amen was made
[58:51] in the image of
[58:53] Goden he was the amateur God
[58:57] amen but the second man amen was a
[59:00] steward of the
[59:01] earth amen he was given a
[59:06] condition to eat
[59:08] everything except for the tree of the
[59:11] knowledge of Good and
[59:14] Evil amen so let's read what the prophet
[59:18] says
[59:19] here
[59:20] D Amen in the
[59:23] uh in the adoption
[59:26] part
[59:31] one amen the prophet says
[59:35] here and God say let us make men in our
[59:41] image after our
[59:43] likeness and let them have dominion over
[59:46] the fish of the
[59:48] sea and over the foul of the
[59:52] air oh sorry that I was reading the
[59:55] Bible my bad
[59:56] so now here the prophet here
[59:59] says when God made
[1:00:02] man or before he made
[1:00:05] man he called himself
[1:00:09] Elohim the word means in Hebrew the
[1:00:14] self-existence all by
[1:00:17] himself nothing existed before
[1:00:20] him he was all the existence there ever
[1:00:24] was
[1:00:27] self-existence
[1:00:29] one
[1:00:31] Elohim means the all
[1:00:34] sufficient all
[1:00:36] powerful
[1:00:37] Almighty self-existence one Amen in
[1:00:41] Genesis chapter 1 verse
[1:00:43] 2 the Bible says that the in the
[1:00:46] beginning the Earth was void and and and
[1:00:49] without a
[1:00:52] form amen the Earth did not have
[1:00:54] anything
[1:00:56] amen the prophet says that even in the
[1:00:58] emptiness of the
[1:01:02] earth amen the God was there amen the
[1:01:06] spirit of God was there amen even in
[1:01:10] that emptiness of the earth amen because
[1:01:12] he was the self-existence
[1:01:15] one the one without a
[1:01:18] beginning the one without an End Amen
[1:01:21] the all powerful one amen the all
[1:01:24] sufficient
[1:01:26] the
[1:01:27] almighty the self-existence one now the
[1:01:30] prophet continues and says but in
[1:01:33] Genesis
[1:01:34] 2 when he made man he said I am
[1:01:41] Yahweh
[1:01:42] Jehovah what did it mean I am the all
[1:01:47] existence I the all existence
[1:01:50] one who has created something off of
[1:01:53] myself
[1:01:56] to be a son of
[1:01:58] mine amen I don't know if you're getting
[1:02:01] this amen the prophet said that I am the
[1:02:04] the self-existence
[1:02:06] one amen who has created something off
[1:02:09] of
[1:02:11] myself amen the prophet says amen that
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:15] logos came out of the father came out of
[1:02:19] God Amen and out of the logos
[1:02:26] came out of the
[1:02:27] logos amen so the logos came out of the
[1:02:31] father came out of God and man you and
[1:02:36] me amen we came out of the
[1:02:38] logos amen which means amen we are that
[1:02:42] we have the same
[1:02:44] nature we have the same
[1:02:47] attributes so that's why the first man
[1:02:51] amen was given dominion over the Earth
[1:02:56] the first man had the authority over the
[1:02:59] Earth because he had the same nature as
[1:03:02] the
[1:03:03] logos he had the same nature as the one
[1:03:06] who created
[1:03:09] everything amen the prophet says amen
[1:03:13] who has created something off of
[1:03:20] myself Amen to be a son of
[1:03:24] mine amen or a a temporary or an
[1:03:29] amateur little one of
[1:03:32] mine amen for me to have a son who has
[1:03:36] my
[1:03:38] DNA amen that son has to come off has to
[1:03:41] come out of
[1:03:42] me amen if I go and I adopt another son
[1:03:46] another person
[1:03:48] son I might call that person my
[1:03:52] son my
[1:03:54] DNA for him to have my
[1:03:57] DNA amen that son has to come out of
[1:04:01] me amen so that's why
[1:04:04] God the first Man was
[1:04:08] created created in his own
[1:04:10] image Amen in his
[1:04:13] likeness for him to be like
[1:04:16] God Amen to be a smaller
[1:04:19] God a smaller version of
[1:04:23] himself amen having the same DNA
[1:04:27] amen the one who has I have created
[1:04:29] something off of
[1:04:32] myself Amen to be a son of
[1:04:35] mine or a temporary or an
[1:04:39] amateur little one of
[1:04:42] mine
[1:04:44] Glory why he gave
[1:04:48] man Jehovah
[1:04:51] means he gave men to be an amateur God
[1:04:57] because he is the father
[1:04:59] God he made man he made a man an amature
[1:05:05] God so he is he is not self-existence
[1:05:11] anymore amen now he exists with his
[1:05:16] family he's no longer the lonely God
[1:05:18] that was in the creation
[1:05:21] before he's no longer the lonely God who
[1:05:24] was looking for a fellowship
[1:05:28] but now that lonely God now has a
[1:05:31] family he's no longer The God Who Exist
[1:05:34] by
[1:05:35] himself he's now a God who exists with
[1:05:38] his
[1:05:40] family that's the reason why he was
[1:05:42] coming down in the cool of the
[1:05:45] day amen to talk with
[1:05:48] Adam have that fellowship with
[1:05:52] Adam because
[1:05:54] adamen was an adopted
[1:05:56] son it was a son who was
[1:06:00] adopted it was a son who who reached the
[1:06:04] maturity he was a son who had the power
[1:06:07] to govern the
[1:06:10] Earth amen he was an amateur God Amen so
[1:06:14] that's the reason why amen Adam could
[1:06:17] see an
[1:06:19] animal so big with his Trump going like
[1:06:23] this and says that you calling you an
[1:06:27] elephant and the father looks at him and
[1:06:30] he says that Amen to this this is
[1:06:33] exactly what I was thinking
[1:06:35] about this is the the the name that I
[1:06:38] had in my
[1:06:39] mind but you took it out of me amen
[1:06:43] because Adam amen was the same thing as
[1:06:47] the
[1:06:48] father Adam amen he had in him the
[1:06:52] spirit
[1:06:53] Man Who had who was in the image of the
[1:06:57] father amen the prophet says if I can
[1:07:00] jump
[1:07:01] ahead amen the prophet says in he here
[1:07:04] hear him I
[1:07:08] believe all right he say it says here
[1:07:11] here he him the
[1:07:14] 56 amen he says that then
[1:07:17] after that the father
[1:07:20] then taken his son out and robbed him in
[1:07:23] a beautiful robe robbed him in a
[1:07:26] beautiful
[1:07:28] Rob amen this is after because when you
[1:07:31] understand about
[1:07:34] adoption amen after the
[1:07:36] fall amen man lost his
[1:07:39] place amen man lost his power he lost
[1:07:42] his he lost everything that he had in
[1:07:45] theen so now to restore the man to the
[1:07:48] place where he
[1:07:50] was God sent a
[1:07:54] tutor Amen to teach that kid that
[1:07:57] son Amen to become a mature
[1:08:00] son so now after the lesson is
[1:08:04] done the prophet says that now he will
[1:08:06] take his son
[1:08:09] out and robed him in a beautiful
[1:08:14] robe and set him out before the public
[1:08:17] as an
[1:08:19] example as an
[1:08:23] ins amen and all man
[1:08:26] estation and
[1:08:28] declared this is my
[1:08:31] son and he has received in the ceremony
[1:08:34] the
[1:08:36] rights Amen in other
[1:08:38] words his name on the
[1:08:43] check will be just as good at the
[1:08:49] bank as his own father's
[1:08:53] name before he was a hair of all
[1:08:59] things Amen in other words amen the name
[1:09:03] of the son will be as good as the name
[1:09:06] of the
[1:09:08] father amen so that's why Adam could
[1:09:10] have done all this
[1:09:12] things amen because the word of the
[1:09:15] son was as powerful as the word of the
[1:09:19] father because the son was
[1:09:22] adopted the son was given the full
[1:09:26] right am the son was given the full
[1:09:30] leadership Amen to do things as he see
[1:09:35] pleased because the father had trusted
[1:09:38] his
[1:09:39] son was to confidence in his
[1:09:43] son that the son would never disappoint
[1:09:47] him that's why he let the devil go to
[1:09:51] job because job was not just some type
[1:09:54] of just some simple human
[1:09:57] being was a type of an adopted
[1:10:02] son to know that no matter what happens
[1:10:05] to
[1:10:07] him amen I know that job I have my full
[1:10:10] confidence in
[1:10:13] job no matter what happens to
[1:10:16] him job will never forsake
[1:10:19] me job will always be there for me so
[1:10:23] you Satan you can go to him
[1:10:26] am go tempt him amen go prove that what
[1:10:30] I'm saying is
[1:10:32] right so that's why you have problems
[1:10:34] coming to
[1:10:35] you amen some problems it's not just
[1:10:38] because you've
[1:10:40] sinned some problems is because the
[1:10:44] tutor amen who is the holy spirit amen
[1:10:48] he wants to make sure that you're mature
[1:10:51] enough am he will let you go through
[1:10:53] things
[1:10:55] the way you will handle those things am
[1:10:58] he will go back to the
[1:11:00] father and say father your
[1:11:04] hair he's growing up very good amen I
[1:11:08] let him go through
[1:11:10] this amen I took the loved one from
[1:11:13] him amen but he did not forsake you amen
[1:11:17] he went ahead and he praised your
[1:11:20] name amen I took the job I took I took I
[1:11:23] took money away
[1:11:26] amen but he kept on going with your
[1:11:29] word the
[1:11:30] tutor always brings report to the
[1:11:38] father amen he brings the report to the
[1:11:41] father amen of your progress am
[1:11:45] everything that you do amen it goes to
[1:11:48] the
[1:11:50] father it said that here's the progress
[1:11:52] of your son
[1:11:55] amen today was challenge
[1:11:59] 101 amen I let somebody criticize
[1:12:03] him amen and and I let him hear how
[1:12:06] people were criticizing
[1:12:09] him am to see his
[1:12:11] reaction Amen to see if he's going to
[1:12:14] forgive amen I let someone insult him
[1:12:18] Amen to see how he's going to
[1:12:20] respond amen I let somebody slapped
[1:12:23] him to see how he's going to
[1:12:27] respond and your
[1:12:29] response amen the tutor will take
[1:12:32] it and bring it to the
[1:12:34] father and say father he's this was his
[1:12:39] response amen this what he
[1:12:43] did amen and then from those from those
[1:12:47] report the father now will
[1:12:50] judge is it really good for me to give
[1:12:53] him the full Authority
[1:12:58] because the Bible the
[1:13:01] adoption amen means the
[1:13:04] placement amen you can't receive the
[1:13:06] Holy
[1:13:07] Spirit you can receive the holy spirit
[1:13:11] amen you can be baptized with the holy
[1:13:13] spirit amen and still be
[1:13:16] lost amen but when you are an adopted
[1:13:20] son amen that's something
[1:13:22] different amen you receive the Holy
[1:13:24] Spirit
[1:13:26] amen that's the beginning of your
[1:13:28] journey amen now you are a
[1:13:31] son amen you are that little boy amen
[1:13:34] you have now to go through uh uh you
[1:13:37] have now to go through
[1:13:39] tutoring amen and then when you become a
[1:13:43] man that's when you get
[1:13:45] adopted amen when I said that if you
[1:13:48] receive the Holy Spirit say can be lost
[1:13:49] the prophet said that when you receive
[1:13:51] the holy spirit in your spirit but not
[1:13:52] in your soul
[1:13:57] yeah cuz if you receive the holy spirit
[1:13:58] in your
[1:14:00] spirit you still can go to hell amen if
[1:14:04] you can look at it in the uh events made
[1:14:07] clear by the prophecy the prophet talks
[1:14:11] about amen amen amen to continue here
[1:14:15] Amen in question and answers in on
[1:14:17] Genesis chapter uh paragraph
[1:14:22] 79 amen here now the prophet is making
[1:14:25] connection between the first man and the
[1:14:27] second
[1:14:30] man amen the prophet says here the first
[1:14:35] man amen is the second man made manifest
[1:14:39] in five
[1:14:44] senses amen is the first
[1:14:47] man is the second
[1:14:50] man man manifest in five senses
[1:14:58] see right
[1:15:00] now you can't touch god with your hands
[1:15:03] like
[1:15:04] that you can't see God with your eyes
[1:15:07] like
[1:15:09] that amen he didn't give you to do
[1:15:12] that amen because God was a God is a
[1:15:16] spirit amen you can't see him like this
[1:15:19] amen so that's why we see the Bible says
[1:15:21] that
[1:15:23] Jesus amen is the man
[1:15:26] manifestation amen of the image of
[1:15:29] God Amen he's the
[1:15:31] manifestation of that God's spirit amen
[1:15:35] for us to be able to touch
[1:15:37] him amen for us to be able to talk to
[1:15:41] him for us to be able to uh uh uh to
[1:15:44] fellowship with
[1:15:46] him so the prophet continues he says
[1:15:50] that now men
[1:15:53] sinned not in his
[1:15:55] Spirit but his body this body
[1:15:59] here amen the spirit didn't
[1:16:01] sin amen the spirit never sin that's why
[1:16:04] the the Bible I believe John says that
[1:16:07] uh oh I forgot I forgot that that Bible
[1:16:10] verse that you don't it's like you don't
[1:16:12] see something like
[1:16:15] that amen amen it's not this
[1:16:18] body but he's talking about the
[1:16:20] spirit amen now men sinned
[1:16:25] not in his Spirit but in his body last
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:34] passion amen then when he
[1:16:37] sinned he separated his from his
[1:16:43] maker and then God the logos the very
[1:16:48] creator of of
[1:16:50] him came
[1:16:52] down and was made in the image of
[1:16:57] man man was made in the image of
[1:17:02] God and then he was made in the image of
[1:17:05] the
[1:17:07] Beast amen man the spirit was made in
[1:17:10] the image of
[1:17:11] God Amen then that spirit and then God
[1:17:14] formed man the the the body one in the
[1:17:18] image of the
[1:17:21] Beast and he fell
[1:17:25] this body
[1:17:26] fell and God came
[1:17:28] down Amen in the image of
[1:17:32] men in the man Christ
[1:17:36] Jesus to suffer
[1:17:38] pain God could not suffer pain in his
[1:17:42] spirit amen how could he suffer physical
[1:17:45] pain in the
[1:17:49] spirit amen he couldn't do it so God
[1:17:53] unfolded himself
[1:17:56] and was made in the image of
[1:17:59] man amen to redeem the man that was
[1:18:04] lost amen so that's why the spirit could
[1:18:07] the spirit go God did not send the
[1:18:09] spirit to die on the
[1:18:12] cross because a spirit cannot
[1:18:14] die amen because that that spirit that
[1:18:17] when God created the first Spirit the
[1:18:19] first
[1:18:20] man amen in other words he couldn't
[1:18:23] really manifest his attributes when man
[1:18:25] was a
[1:18:29] spirit because a spirit does not feel
[1:18:33] pain amen a spirit does not
[1:18:35] fall amen the spirit does not
[1:18:38] sin amen a spirit does not go through
[1:18:41] what this body goes
[1:18:43] through so to manifest his
[1:18:46] attributes he had to form this body of
[1:18:51] Flesh this body of clay
[1:18:55] amen for him to manifest his
[1:18:59] attributes amen so that's why when men
[1:19:01] sinned and
[1:19:03] fail amen it wasn't the spirit God who
[1:19:06] came
[1:19:07] down but God made himself a
[1:19:12] flesh amen that resemble to this flesh
[1:19:15] of of
[1:19:17] ours Amen to come and to redeem this
[1:19:22] body that was lost because the prophet
[1:19:25] said that man
[1:19:27] sinned not in his
[1:19:30] Spirit but in his
[1:19:33] body amen that's why God God had to come
[1:19:37] Jesus had to come as a man made looking
[1:19:39] like
[1:19:42] us amen so when man
[1:19:46] sin he became now uh a product of
[1:19:51] time amen he's sted now to get old to
[1:19:54] grow
[1:19:56] old amen men started to
[1:20:00] die amen and when men started to
[1:20:03] die amen God did not just stop
[1:20:07] there amen God created two other
[1:20:11] bodies amen remember in 2 Corinthians
[1:20:14] chapter 5 verse1 the Bible
[1:20:17] says for we know that if our Earthly
[1:20:20] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:20:28] we have a building of
[1:20:32] God and house not made with
[1:20:36] hands Eternal in the
[1:20:41] heavens amen the prophet
[1:20:43] says when you
[1:20:46] die
[1:20:48] amen let's just read let's just read
[1:20:50] let's just read this in the message who
[1:20:53] is this
[1:20:57] it says that
[1:20:59] then when a man is Born
[1:21:02] Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit
[1:21:05] baby in
[1:21:09] Christ
[1:21:11] baby and then when this robe of flesh is
[1:21:17] dropped there is a natural body
[1:21:22] theop a body not made with
[1:21:26] hands neither born of a
[1:21:29] woman that we go
[1:21:35] to amen then that
[1:21:38] body returns
[1:21:40] back and picks up the glorified
[1:21:44] body that's the reason Jesus went to
[1:21:47] hell and and he when he
[1:21:51] died and the souls that were in prison
[1:21:55] Amen to turn turn them back into that
[1:21:58] turn back turned back into that
[1:22:01] theophany amen so how this
[1:22:04] works when this body here
[1:22:07] expires amen the prophet says that the
[1:22:11] spirit
[1:22:12] man that God made in Genesis
[1:22:17] 1:26 that man who will jump into another
[1:22:22] body amen it's not this one amen this is
[1:22:27] just a temporal habitation of
[1:22:29] man amen that's what brother bham says
[1:22:33] amen you know I mean you you you you see
[1:22:36] me but you don't know who Bram
[1:22:39] is you don't see the real
[1:22:42] brand you see me but you don't know who
[1:22:44] the real Isaac
[1:22:46] is because the real ISAC amen is not
[1:22:50] Genesis
[1:22:52] 27 amen but the real ey
[1:22:55] amen he's Genesis
[1:22:57] 126 amen he's that Spirit man amen he's
[1:23:02] that real Isaac amen because when this
[1:23:05] body
[1:23:06] here amen will
[1:23:08] expire that real Isaac who
[1:23:12] inside he will jump into another
[1:23:15] body that we got a Celestial
[1:23:19] body amen which is also a theop
[1:23:22] body amen amen that will be the body
[1:23:26] that we will use when we'll be in
[1:23:29] heaven amen now notice God did not
[1:23:32] create us to stay up
[1:23:35] there amen we are
[1:23:38] Earthbound amen we are created to be
[1:23:42] here when God
[1:23:44] created God gave the man dominion over
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:49] Earth and over every creeping things
[1:23:52] that's in the Earth
[1:23:56] amen God did not create you to be in
[1:23:59] heaven Amen in heaven we will only go
[1:24:01] for a few
[1:24:03] moments amen that's when we will use our
[1:24:06] Celestial
[1:24:07] body then when our time in heaven will
[1:24:10] be
[1:24:11] done amen the prophet said that we will
[1:24:13] come back here on
[1:24:16] Earth somebody will pick up another
[1:24:20] body in other words the same Isaac
[1:24:23] inside
[1:24:25] we jump into another body amen that we
[1:24:28] call a glorified
[1:24:31] body amen and that body will stay here
[1:24:34] on
[1:24:35] Earth Amen to rain Amen to
[1:24:42] govern amen so now where is that body
[1:24:45] the question we
[1:24:47] asked amen because the body is not will
[1:24:50] not be created when you die or when the
[1:24:52] Rapture will happen no
[1:24:57] amen the body is already here so now we
[1:25:00] ask ourselves where is
[1:25:02] it in questions and answers number
[1:25:07] one paragraph
[1:25:11] 264 the prophet says
[1:25:14] here he says that your glorified
[1:25:18] body is right here at the Tabernacle

[1:25:55] Jesus to do what Amen to give you a
[1:26:00] strength like a charge going into a
[1:26:04] battery amen that's what the that body
[1:26:07] is doing right
[1:26:08] now amen it's standing right next to you

[1:26:46] strength coming from it's coming from
[1:26:49] that glorified
[1:26:51] body that glorified body it's like a
[1:26:54] charging
[1:26:56] port amen whenever you tired whenever
[1:27:00] you sick am you drawing from that
[1:27:04] body you drawing life from that
[1:27:07] body because that body is
[1:27:10] eternal amen that body doesn't know any
[1:27:14] weakness that body does not know any
[1:27:17] pain that body does not know an End Amen
[1:27:21] it's a body amen like the body of Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ
[1:27:26] himself amen because when Jesus
[1:27:29] died amen he went he was into a
[1:27:31] Celestial
[1:27:32] body Mary tried to touch him Jesus said
[1:27:36] do not touch me yet because this body
[1:27:39] this Celestial body cannot be in contact
[1:27:43] with
[1:27:44] you wait I have to go up amen I have to
[1:27:49] get that glorified
[1:27:51] body and when he got that glorified body
[1:27:55] he came to Thomas amen Thomas that was
[1:27:58] that was
[1:28:00] doubting he said Thomas here's the
[1:28:04] scars thrust your
[1:28:07] hand
[1:28:09] thrusting it means to go in and
[1:28:13] out which means that body was not just a
[1:28:17] spirit it wasn't a ghost amen he was was
[1:28:21] it was it wasn't a ghost amen he was a
[1:28:25] body that Thomas could touch am and feel
[1:28:29] something amen because Jesus told
[1:28:32] Thomas to thrust his hand in that
[1:28:35] body thrust him means to go in and
[1:28:39] out Amen in that body amen so that will
[1:28:42] be your body that you will
[1:28:45] have amen because the celesti your
[1:28:49] body am the prophet says that it's like
[1:28:51] that body where uh uh uh those uh uh uh
[1:28:55] I believe Saints of old were were asking
[1:28:58] they're saying that Lord until
[1:29:01] when I mean no no the the souls that are
[1:29:04] in the
[1:29:07] altar amen they had a certain
[1:29:11] body amen they were there they couldn't
[1:29:14] touch each
[1:29:15] other they couldn't talk to each other

[1:29:20] crying Lord until when amen they want to
[1:29:24] come back to this
[1:29:26] body Amen to be able to have
[1:29:29] Fellowship Amen to have this physical
[1:29:33] body so now what is the
[1:29:35] adoption so when Adam Lo when Eve
[1:29:40] fell amen Adam chose to go with his wife
[1:29:43] for for her
[1:29:46] Redemption amen they

[1:30:03] back where we were before the foundation
[1:30:05] of the

[1:30:51] God we are sons and daughters of God
[1:30:55] Amen but we were
[1:30:58] predestinated now here's what I'm trying
[1:31:00] to get to
[1:31:02] you for these sons of the last days of
[1:31:05] the last
[1:31:07] day you see we were
[1:31:12] predestinated onto

[1:31:24] amen it's not something that you are
[1:31:26] right
[1:31:27] now amen but there will come a time amen
[1:31:31] where you will have to be that
[1:31:33] thing so we were
[1:31:36] predestinated onto the adoption amen
[1:31:39] means that when we are born of the
[1:31:42] spirit amen there will come a time amen
[1:31:46] where we will be
[1:31:47] adopted in other words we will be
[1:31:51] placed adoption the prophet says
[1:31:54] amen God put some as mothers as
[1:31:57] wife am some as
[1:32:00] pastors some as teachers amen some as
[1:32:05] ministers and for and so on amen he said
[1:32:08] that it's not us putting
[1:32:11] ourselves amen I don't just wake up and
[1:32:13] decide to be a pastor
[1:32:16] no I have to be
[1:32:18] placed amen into that position amen
[1:32:22] because it's your adoption
[1:32:24] amen you just don't wake up and decide
[1:32:26] to be
[1:32:27] something but for you God has to place
[1:32:30] you Amen to adopt you amen into a
[1:32:34] certain position amen Galatians 4:
[1:32:48] 1-7 amen Galatians chap 4: 1-7 G
[1:32:56] the prophet the Bible says here now I
[1:33:00] say that the hair that the air that the
[1:33:05] air as long as he is a
[1:33:10] child differ nothing from a
[1:33:15] servant be Lord of
[1:33:18] all but is on the tutors and governors
[1:33:23] until the time appointed of the
[1:33:27] father even so
[1:33:30] we when we were
[1:33:33] children were in bondage under the
[1:33:35] elements of the
[1:33:38] world Amen but when the fullness of the
[1:33:42] time was
[1:33:43] come amen God sent forth his
[1:33:47] son made of a woman made under the law
[1:33:52] Amen to redeem them that were under the
[1:33:56] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:33:59] of
[1:34:01] sons and because you are
[1:34:05] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:34:08] his son into your
[1:34:10] hearts crying AB
[1:34:13] father wherefore thou are no more a
[1:34:17] servant but a son and if a son then an
[1:34:23] heir of of God through
[1:34:26] Christ amen when you are a
[1:34:29] child amen even though you are fear with
[1:34:31] the holy
[1:34:33] spirit amen you're not different from a
[1:34:37] servant amen even though you be Lord of
[1:34:40] all amen but there will be a time when
[1:34:44] this child will come into
[1:34:47] maturity this child will be
[1:34:50] adopted amen and now he will become a
[1:34:52] son
[1:34:54] amen no more a
[1:34:56] child he will become a
[1:34:59] son and at that point his name will be
[1:35:03] as good as the name of the
[1:35:05] Father the father will go and make a
[1:35:08] public
[1:35:09] declaration am the same way he did with
[1:35:13] Jesus amen this is my beloved Son Amen
[1:35:17] in whom I am pleased hear he him amen
[1:35:21] and when you get to that place amen when
[1:35:24] you get to that level amen there is
[1:35:27] nothing amen that you can't
[1:35:30] do fa amen there will be nothing that
[1:35:34] will be impossible to you amen you will
[1:35:37] just have to pronounce the
[1:35:40] word will be done to you amen when you
[1:35:44] look at
[1:35:45] Peter Peter was under the TR of Jesus
[1:35:48] Christ amen Peter was was
[1:35:52] justified Peter was
[1:35:54] Sanctified amen amen amen amen amen
[1:35:57] Peter was there under the under the
[1:36:00] leadership of God of
[1:36:02] Christ amen but when God told to send
[1:36:05] them to go pray for the
[1:36:08] sick Peter met a demon a demon that he
[1:36:11] couldn't
[1:36:13] overcome he came back crying to the
[1:36:16] father said Lord I don't have enough
[1:36:18] power to do
[1:36:20] this Lord I don't have enough power to
[1:36:22] do this
[1:36:24] amen Jesus in other words looked at
[1:36:27] Peter he said Peter wait until you are
[1:36:31] adopted nothing will stand against
[1:36:34] you so that's why you see
[1:36:37] Peter after Acts chapter
[1:36:39] 2 he was walking at that get
[1:36:43] beautiful he saw that man amen the Bible
[1:36:47] did not say that Peter prayed for the
[1:36:50] man amen but Peter being an adopted
[1:36:52] child adopted
[1:36:54] son only spoke a
[1:36:57] word amver and God have I
[1:37:00] not what what I have amen what did he
[1:37:05] have amen he had that spirit of God in
[1:37:08] him I give to
[1:37:10] you the same Peter who could not hear
[1:37:13] someone after
[1:37:15] praying amen but after a certain
[1:37:19] transformation that same Peter did not
[1:37:22] need to close his eyes and pray for 2
[1:37:24] hours for somebody to be
[1:37:27] healed with a simple word pronouncing
[1:37:31] the
[1:37:32] word someone who was born
[1:37:35] could recover his legs and start
[1:37:37] jumping up and
[1:37:40] down amen why is that amen is that what
[1:37:44] Jesus said I'm going to close now I'm
[1:37:46] going to
[1:37:48] jump amen and before I do that amen I'll
[1:37:52] read one more quote which is very
[1:37:53] important
[1:37:55] here amen it's found in the believer's
[1:37:57] position in Christ
[1:38:02] paragraph 50 amen here's what brother
[1:38:05] Bram
[1:38:06] says amen he says that now into his
[1:38:11] church you that positionally is seated
[1:38:15] in the Heavenly places in Christ
[1:38:21] Jesus amen now he's to us amen now you
[1:38:27] who are positionally seated in Christ in
[1:38:29] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:38:34] Jesus the prophet
[1:38:36] says be
[1:38:38] humble
[1:38:40] Brethren be humble amen that is very
[1:38:44] very very
[1:38:45] important amen he says be
[1:38:48] humble because
[1:38:50] someday the holy spirit will speak to
[1:38:53] you
[1:38:54] am may call you out to one
[1:38:58] side somewhere in a little
[1:39:01] cabin on the
[1:39:04] hillside or in the washroom or
[1:39:07] somewhere and there will anoint you for
[1:39:11] a certain
[1:39:14] service or a certain thing to
[1:39:17] do amen it's not
[1:39:20] ourselves choosing what we want to do
[1:39:24] amen but it's that holy spirit amen who
[1:39:27] will anoint
[1:39:28] us amen for a certain
[1:39:31] service but the prophet says when that
[1:39:35] time hasn't come
[1:39:37] yet he says be
[1:39:39] humble and wait until the Holy Spirit
[1:39:43] anoint you for that
[1:39:47] service amen it won't be laying on the
[1:39:50] uh uh it won't be laying on the hand of
[1:39:52] the pr
[1:39:55] or of the Presbyterians or the or the
[1:39:57] elders or
[1:40:02] Elders amen it will be laying on the
[1:40:05] hands of the of God
[1:40:09] Almighty amen himself to put a new
[1:40:14] ministry in
[1:40:17] you amen a new robe on
[1:40:20] you and to set you out as an
[1:40:26] example and another demons out of
[1:40:29] another demons out of torments will
[1:40:32] never upset
[1:40:36] you amen it says that it's the work of
[1:40:39] the god almighty
[1:40:42] himself Amen to put a new ministry in
[1:40:46] you amen not something that you have to
[1:40:49] go look for
[1:40:51] yourself amen but it has to be
[1:40:54] placement am so that's what Jesus was
[1:40:57] telling his
[1:40:58] disciples am wait he told them to
[1:41:03] T wa
[1:41:05] until I put that new ministry in
[1:41:09] you I know right now you want to do
