[Music] let's go to the book of jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 4. verse 4 is then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou comest fought out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations jeremiah 1 and verse 4 and 5 your god is telling jeremiah that before you were born before you were formed in your mother's womb i had already known you i had already predestinated you amen amen may the lord add blessings to the reading of his word whilst we're getting siri we just want to open uh another scripture in ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4. the bible says according as he has chosen us in his in him according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself amen according to the good pleasure of his will [Music] volunteer amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of sons and to the adoption of children by jesus christ amen amen as we are reading through the bible we see all these different scriptures letting and we know nowadays we are living in a time where everyone wants to know their origin people are longing to trace their rules they want to check their dna amen but we know we don't have to worry about that because the word tells us where we came from before the world was created you is taking advantage of that people trying to find out what their identity is or where they come from [Music] we know nowadays people are being told you can be what you be you can be what you want to become if you are born a woman and you think that i'm a man you can just say i'm a man if god said before the foundation of the world you are my daughter nothing can change that yeah so all we have to do is look back into the word of god and see who we are and where we came from two seconds so when god says to jeremiah before you were formed in your mother's belly i knew you allah can't you ideas and i come and i read the scriptures predestinated means chosen before the predestination so before anything happened before god said let there be light you were that's why the bible says nature is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god because the predestinated sons of god were given authority and he had a beginning satan had a beginning and he's going to have an end alec but you and me we are eternal but bruce we don't have a beginning like our father and we don't have an ending that's why we came from god and we are going back to this you are a son you are a daughter of god you are the same as your father was that the feast was it laffy did you visit [Music] amen we thank god for his predestination amen he predestinated us by elections and he predestinated us by his and he put every name on the lam's book of life so when jesus came on the cross of calvary our conscience you have an issue with what happened to take us back to where we were because we know because of the fall past [Music] but the prophet tells us that you only came to the realization that i was a son we all know the story of the prodigal son when he was out there eating with the pigs cantilever that did not change who he was he was still the son of his father but because of sin of course there's some patience he forgot and he was living under his privilege because he forgot that he was a son he it doesn't matter what scenes you were doing that did not change who you were you were already at predestination and fish predestinated you and we thank god for the message that came to open our eyes so we could remember we were saying before the foundation of the world before you were saved you were already a son hey man amen so it is really important say foreign wherever you come from [Music] that nothing [Music] so whatever anything that comes in in your lineage of your family there's no right to have a wholesaler because you are a son of basketball you come from heaven moving educal so if it is diabetes and they tell you that diabetes runs in your family you say that's not it was that my father would have diabetes and everyone [Music] because you say i [Music] there is something called the mercy and grace yeah misery there is a song that says mercy rewrote my life hey man it says whatever you have done they get two seconds of effect god will erase it it doesn't matter what whatever you touched on god will forget it jeff if you repent of all the sins you did two seconds god cannot remember it a journey there was one brother who came to brother branham and he said um and every time i kneel down to pray to god asking for forgiveness the prophet said you know what every time you are telling god do you that's the first time he's hearing it because the moment you confessed it to god the first time he erased it he forgot it he cannot even remember in a penalty please [Music] whatever you did in your past does not matter he sees you as blameless amen we all know the story of um the woman at the well no consumption of she was known of having an but when jesus was right there my conscience you tell her and he was talking to her the disciples saw jesus talking to a prostitute jesus in prostitutes but jesus did not see that he was seeing her how she was before the foundation and he had come to restore her being a daughter of god and then she was changed she was a daughter of god although people were singing differently allah the kind of woman whom jesus is entertaining he stop living under your privilege [Music] was at the thrashing floor and gideon when he he was hiding harvest from the media knights he is a cashier definitely made janito because the media would come in and take all the harvest that the children of israel would have had pascale and gideon was in an act of being a coward hello he was in the midst of hiding louis cashier the vance emiliani he was in the midst of running away from him but then the angel of god came down to him an angel is a messenger [Music] but once he was in the middle of running away the angel said thou mighty man of valor did you have any questions it was not it was not looking at him with what gideon was seeing himself in london foreign it doesn't matter how many battles you have lost god sees you at him as a mighty conqueror continue and say thank you lord [Music] amen and the prophet of god dramatize it and say his his uh his daughter was getting thin the prophet uh and he was a little farmer and uh the philistines were coming to steal their harvest away from them and then there was a crisis at hand increase of a he started thinking my family is uh is not even enjoying the harvest that we're making he saw he was a farmer he says but then he remembered something he said i played the character he looked into the word of god and he saw a promise that was made to abraham his father that promise says thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy so that word was responsible give him victory amen amen the prophet of god he says you know i'm not a fighter but i am a son of abraham i'm of the tribe and the lineage i know my god still lives there was a crisis at hand here and he killed 600 philistines yeah election season see some philistines and that was a paradox because he was standing on the word he saw the word says we are going to overcome all the gates of the enemy enemy so he knew he was not a fighter he was not a trained fighter that word was responsible to give him victory so wherever you are you might say i don't have the courage to do it just stand on the word of god that victory the bible promised that you and me will possess all the gates just stand on that word the prophet god says he says that's the death struck to satan say suffer when a man takes god at his word that'll kill satan each and every time [Music] they won't suffer we are predestinated we gotta know that once a while whom we were called out to be king and nothing will ever stand in your way the prophet god also says he says now remember christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts uh they live for this actor you see satan he fights that revelation revelation he cannot stand it in a paper accepted he knows that if the people get to the true revelation of what the true church is [Music] that's why satan is always trying to decide because he knows that the moment you know who you are the moment you know that you are a son of god it will be trouble for him in the day to the prophet of god says no brother sister deity is in you like say he is hidden in me so it becomes christ himself doing the work and not yourself you say christian remember this effort because he said i will be in you even up to the end of the world basically so we know that everything that was in god two seconds according to christ everything that was in christ maturity adam was given authority over creation when he told a lion to say move over there or the kitty that lion had to move when he told a river to switch directions because he was speaking with authorities [Music] [Music] speak to hornets and hornets would hear that voice we proved hornets would hear that voice because the sons of god realized that true identity may the name of god be praised get the song leader to sing as one song amen hey man let us think i must tell jesus [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] jesus can jesus [Music] is [Music] a bird [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music]
