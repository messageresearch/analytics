[15:26] walk with st. Paul much of examples to
[15:29] offices the segment's much cervix a
[15:31] discipline to walk with Jesus Christ
[15:33] much that make surgical Easter I would
[15:35] love to be able to do that by defensive
[15:39] them but in reality we are doing that
[15:43] right here in the mud sauce over it
[15:46] aluminum
[15:54] we are right now living in Bible days we
[16:00] are living in the days at this time the
[16:05] scripture is justice able to be
[16:06] fulfilled now lazy please useful to see

[16:16] as they were amen we have the same
[16:19] ability the lawmakers a mess wit you

[16:30] why
[16:31] angels don't appear anymore that is open
[16:34] like in Asuncion um you know it's
[16:37] because we don't reverence him enough
[16:38] the amen we don't give Christ enough
[16:43] reverence
[16:44] don't nobody I mean honestly we have the
[16:47] wrong atmosphere in our lives I want to
[16:49] soothe a way that most feel helping a
[16:51] man if we really lived like we were
[16:53] living in Bible days before going home
[16:56] so you get on the issue the people I
[16:58] acted like we're living in my eyes you
[17:00] see then we would see the actions of the
[17:04] Bible in our life and I don't exactly
[17:08] know but we received a greater
[17:14] think about it now it's great how great
[17:19] was it for the men that received the
[17:21] prophet Isaiah beautiful in the Shankill
[17:26] as she did with the perfect you say I
[17:28] know it's a great thing that people who
[17:29] receive the Prophet Jeremiah supportive
[17:33] effective jelly amen everyone that
[17:36] receives a prophet is blessed and then
[17:42] those that reject the prophet remember
[17:47] we're living in the days even people
[17:49] done issues where we have the
[17:51] possibility of receiving a provocation
[18:06] let me tell you that pillar fire did not
[18:09] leave when brother Brandon soon a ship
[18:11] going to fit up Bucky pick up about a
[18:13] bit bumpy boat as brother Branham says
[18:15] that pillar of fire someone asks me
[18:17] questions a man boom from what I'm
[18:19] letting you see me the winning that gets
[18:21] you a sophomore they asked him what is
[18:23] that pillar of fire that follows you
[18:24] around give this little defeat this
[18:27] cheaper he said it's God and not just to
[18:34] me it busts it multiple one but you
[18:36] every true believer now look at if you
[18:41] receive a prophet in the name of a
[18:43] prophet you receive the prophets
[18:48] [Applause]
[19:17] [Music]
[19:22] hey we may not see it with this the Lord
[19:27] Jesus Christ gave a promise he's here
[19:39] he's brooding over now brother Brant and
[19:45] receive the pillar and we see the fruits
[19:50] of his ministry everything the
[19:55] Scriptures do now st. Paul came to this
[20:02] earth is simple definition said death
[20:04] ain't set up before King Agrippa yeah
[20:07] you know he told T Agrippa about a great
[20:12] light that came you know yeah but that I
[20:15] do not believe me a q-tip initially and
[20:17] smoke about from his horse a it's on
[20:23] Shabbat and as he fell to the ground
[20:24] this less light gave him a commission
[20:30] and when Paul is telling us to King
[20:33] Agrippa
[20:33] I love got bored by mr. shioma argue but
[20:36] he said I was not disobedient to the
[20:39] heavenly will be solid visuals in it and
[20:43] then we see the evidence of that
[20:45] heavenly vision in this desert
[20:50] now brother branham had a similar
[20:52] experience where an angel came down a
[20:57] visitation of the Tree of Life
[21:19] and then a greater Commission will be
[21:22] giving you later they took that vision
[21:30] and confirm an absurdity da a pre-set
[21:32] commission and serpent branch a vertical

[22:20] the heavenly male God is it they did it
[22:22] with this schism pretty gosh
