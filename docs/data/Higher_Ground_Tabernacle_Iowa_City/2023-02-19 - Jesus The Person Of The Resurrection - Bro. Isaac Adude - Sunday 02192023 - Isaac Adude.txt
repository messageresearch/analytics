fine it's all right because it says that [Music] it says that if I'm caught by by men I would draw all men unto me you say uh amen let's stand and start the service oh they don't go straight to the words uh let's open our Bibles in the Book of John chapter 11. chapter 11 John chapter 11 John chapter owns verse 17 to 28. you just said he said I've been tweet amen John chapter 11 verse 17 to 28. it's my first time to see some of y'all since the year started so I wanted to wish you a happy New Year it's my first time to see some of you know some of you since the year started oh says so I wanted to wish everybody Happy New Year I hope this new year had a great start because uh John chapter 11 verse 17-28 Joshua Pittsburgh it's a familiar uh story of the Bible says either you've been to a Sunday school or you know okay or in normal church we have heard about the The Story of Lazarus amen so we'll be talking about this uh for a while today we will see where God will lead us amen John chapter 11 verse 17 to 28. the Bible says that when Jesus came he found that he had Lane in the grave four days already foreign about 15 furlongs off economy is and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother amen because here Lazarus was already dead now verse 20 the Bible says then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house applications then said Martin unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever that will ask of God God will give a day Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again says unto him I know that that he shall rise again in the resurrection of the of the last day Resurrection amen so here if you understand you'll see that Jesus was talking about the present time but Martha thought that Jesus was talking about first Thessalonians amen verse 25 Jesus said unto her I am to Resurrection I am the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he leave verse 7 resurrection and whatsoever and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die leave us doubt this is she said she's the Bible says that she saith unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou art Christ the Christ the son of God which shall come into the world and when she had said so she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and call it 40. verse 7 to it is Father God we humbly come before your turn of Grace this morning [Music] Lord just to say thank you volunteers Mercy Lord thank you for protecting us Lord Mercedes of our Protege Lord thank you for keeping us Lord Jesus alive Lord for giving us this good health Lord now we're here father God as the song says well we want to talk about you Lord talking about Jesus the king of kings of Peace Lord Jesus Christ Lord so now we ask you father God to continue to be with us Lord we pray that you take me out of the way Lord and you speak to your people Lord we pray father God that you help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit okay please say yeah Lord I can say exactly what you want me to say to you Lord we pray father God that you bless their hearts so father God that we hear this word let the quickening power father God that goes with the word may Quicken our mortal bodies Lord we give you all the praise we give you all the young they don't know Jesus Christ and we pray amen you may be seated remember this morning we do have a little subject that we wanted to share with you so much it meant that we entitled it Jesus the person of the Resurrection Jesus the person of the Resurrection de la Resurrection yes Jesus the person of the Resurrection amen so throughout my my uh throughout by the grace of God we'll try to show paragraph that the resurrection is not simply an event okay but the resurrection is a person and that person is the Lord Jesus Christ because he says that I am the resurrection Believes In Me will not die amen so before we start I would like to make a small introduction you may not preached about this long time ago but I just wanted to remind us about this that will help us Amen to talk for a while for a few minutes about the Trinity the Trinity of God as Sons the Trinity of God that Sons come fish amen because we know that there is only one God that we believe who manifested himself in different attributes he said Manifesto remember he's the God the father he is the god the son and he is all one God Amen we don't believe that there are three persons in Christ or In God We believe that the father is the son the son official Center Street amen it's all one God you know manifesting himself in different attributes individuals amen so the Bible tells us that God promises us to promise to reveal him to reveal himself under three sons and my first thing he had to reveal himself as the son of man therefore it was a very common remember then he has to reveal himself again as a Son of God then in the Millennium he will reveal himself as the son of David yeah the prophet said that the son of man the prophet amen is also what we call the logos amen is that that created the entire universe because if you go to Revelation chapter four John's testified and said that everything was created by Him and foreign amen because he said that he saw one person sitting on the throne and then the the rainbow the bow was all around the throne amen and he was the son of man who was he was the son of David or it was God himself the son who was sitting on that Throne he said remember it was Jesus Christ was on that throne even he who was the pill of fire that created everything amen he who was the pill of fire that appeared to Paul amen he's the pillow fire that appeared to brother Branham and he's the pill of fire that began since the beginning of time so that same Son of God that same God had to manifest himself as his son remembers University amen because a son of man can be touched the alarm we see Jesus Christ amen he lived with us amen he walked with us amen he ate with us amen he fellowship with us people were able to see him people were able to talk to him amen so but God is the spirit so that's why Jesus couldn't be the Son of God because God is a spirit amen the spirit you cannot see a spirit amen so that's why he promised to reveal himself as the Son of God remember the Son of God which is the holy spirit so Jesus the son of man had to die first Allah Amen to give away to the Son of God which is the holy spirit amen because it says that uh uh that I am with I will be with you even in you amen he was with us as a son of man and he will be a nurse as the Son of God leading us and making us do the same work that he did remember amen so he promised that after that it will come as the son of David Allah the prophet comes and tells us that between the Son of God and the son of David and the prophet uh he has to come back again as a son of man because it's first coming past question amen was only for the Jews amen he wasn't for the Gentiles to reign to reign as king too so now the prophet here says in the message is is uh is it is the rising of the sun amen he said that and to be with again we realize in the last day according to Luke chapter 17 30. in the sun day again say in the day that the son of man will be revealed or waved again over the people who says now the prophet asks the question now who is the son of man the man like the prophet says that in the beginning was the word the prophet and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if all the teaching that we have heard that we that we have a two seasons and confirmation of the word of God by word of God by Signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here Luke chapter 17 the 17th and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with a daughter difference that that word again is waved over the people yes the Dead traditions of men is dead tradition and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he's giving us life amen the son of man amen those the word made flesh dwelt Among Us amen so we see in the Bible they are
