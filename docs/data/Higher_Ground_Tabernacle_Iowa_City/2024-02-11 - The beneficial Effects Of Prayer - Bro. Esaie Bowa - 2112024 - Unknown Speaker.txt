TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is not going out of the curtain go back to the world and come back or trying to come back through the curtain again you come and ask things from God when he gives you you go back in the world the day after you come back to God things from God then you go back into into the world if you dwell in me and my word abide in you in other words if you are like Aon STI that has been brought in the CH Glory close to the port uh to the port of Mana where you can eat every time and your soul is refreshed so when you enter into his presence Glory your soul is refreshed it's blowing and bearing fruit he said then abide there stay there and let my words abide in you then ask everything that you want it should be granted unto you IID like to give you a secret if you know that you have or you got something that requires or God's assistance because there's a sin that require repar if you got to fix the thing go and fix it with the person don't come and waste your time in the prayer the church go fix up the thing with the person you criticize somebody go fix fix it with somebody don't say I've criticized you I had evil thought about you about somebody it's a sin now you're going to say my brother you know I had a evil thought about you in that time when I've seen what you've done I thought like you've done this because of this then forgive me for having those evil thought that's a sign of a true Christian because there there you are sinc and in the prayer God requires sincerity that when you're making your prayer you feel a condemnation in your heart stop praying that would be useless to continue pray go fix up the thing with a person a sin that only requires bring it in the presence of God and when you are so and you entered into the presence of God by crying you going to feel yourself that the condemnation is gone and you're going to have assur that you have been forgiven the Bible says if your heart doesn't condemn you Assurance before God but most of the time we trying to enter into God's pres but we don't have that assurance that we have been forgiven then we we come out of that and our sins keeps on accumulating accumulating accumulating but when we come to church and the church becomes so heavy because people have got sins their that they didn't confess light in the presence of God when we come in the Pres of we we we we got to be like popcorn when just the word of God is it jumping in the presence of God but people they've got so many and they don't want to conf they don't want to repent but they waiting for for the miracle how can the miracle come you are the order of your own Miracle you are the one who have to seek for your own by the way of living you need God to do something for you so how do you behave if it's so hard so just bear with me I didn't want to hurt somebody but I'm just preaching is for us to have some techniques of how to pray it's going to help us enough there's so many to say so I just okay make it sure uh you know the prayer is like a vapor when the vapor is going up it's invisible now I'm talking about the effect of the prayer when the VAP is going up to create rain sometimes it's not seen we don't see it but we will realize that that there's a rain when there's a rain falling that's where we remember that there been and when the rain is falling it may do so it can bring it can or or take out the trees it can crumble houses when the when the rain is fall it's that Vapor that went coming down in another which is rain and everything that we know it's the same thing with the prayer sometimes the prayer when it's going up it's invisible pray for something that we don't know when the results start coming then you realize it's taking out the sickness it's crumbling sins it's doing so many chaos that's why my brother and sisters we got to pay attention to a s when you that this man is a Christian a holy man pay attention the returns of pray can bring so many chos to because the prayer of a holy man can create so many chaos that you can't realize you just find yourself in a situation you don't know why you are in that situation it's because you despise one of the Saints you despise one of the little ones in the kingdom of God so you got to watch out with a son of God who pray with a daughter of God who prays in a deepest sincerity because the prayer of righteous has got more efficiency it produce results positive negative positive or negatives my yes my brother and we know what we're talking about when the saint and Peter was in the prison the prayer of saints freed Peter from the prison Peter didn't pray in but it was a prayer of saints gaed somewhere they were in prayer and the angel of the Lord came down Peter freed Peter so that's the effect of prayer the prayer liberating When you pray you can free yourself or you can Free People of your house dad is praying for the family m is praying for the family they're all praying for the kids that notice when she received those pray for the Salvation of and the member of her family so the prayer can people so the prayer want us to intercede yes my brother and sister I would like to say something before we finish up that the the prayer itself is not sufficient you going to ask yourself why am I saying this prayer itself is not enough why notice in the Bible when those 400 prophet of Bal were at a mountain the Bible says they prayed since morning until evening there wasn't any answer from their God there wasn't any answer from their God B they are God never answer their prayers but the prayer itself is not enough but now be attentive the prayer itself is not enough just because thein people are also praying they' got the kind of pray fight something see somebody with the Eyes Wide Open fighting looking at people and then say kick the devil give him a kill so pray because the prophet of they prayed from morning and they never been answered but now listen when Elijah the prophet came Elijah didn't start by praying but he have done something what Elijah have done he gaed the 12 Stones that were making the of God he established the of God that was the 12 stes and the prophet of God says that was the Apostle teaching it was the word of God restoring the word of God he started restoring the word of God the teaching of Apostles He restored He restored when he restored the it was from the restor that he offered his prayer the prayer of was going to to to to to to POS itself upon the establish and now my brother and sisters we have received the restoration message El of Mal he came to establish the order of God and our prayer to has to be posed upon the Resto prayer restor is to know God to know the Lord you know that I know you from the message of Mal the restored order it's upon that that I'm coming to you our faith is to be upon that yes my brother and sisters but now the Bible says also whoever comes to God should believe that God exist and you can't just come in the Pres if you don't if you doubting exist when you're coming in the presence of the Lord be assured that the Lord is going to listen to you he's going to answer to you because who com come into the presence of God has to believe that God that is the one who's going to answer to those who are now brother s just because of pray EAS was sick he was a king the Bible says that the Lord said sent him a prophet said that tell going to die the sickness that is going to die go tell him that said the Lord imagine the prophet proud I can imagine that the same journalist who were there with their cameras and they ask brother Prophet what is going to happen to the king and isah he was so proud of himself the Lord the king ezekias is going to die just because it's God who said [Music] it and he entered in the house of he said unto him that's the Lord you're going to die of that sickness and the prophet said when Isaiah said that to he went out and Ezekiel St his face against the wall he asked for the grace of the Lord he said unto God Eternal God you know that acted according my heart with sincerity I don't want to die right now I want you to grant me 15 more years because I want to strengthen my kingdom and the prophet of God said he didn't spend 15 minutes same Prophet who brought the the Lord saying that ezas is going to die he was the same Prophet God said unto him go back to e what am I going to say just go back and tell him that ezas you're not going to die anymore my brother and sisters it's a greater resource that we have to exploit just because of prayer God to and Grant unto him 15 years more now I'll finish up with this a certain day there was this woman that we know hisory that the child was sick and he was about to die the prophet saying she pray the entire night she said oh God this uni child you g when I see in the Bible I'm just like thisam to whom you gave a child and now my child is dying without knowing you I pray the god that you may intercede for my child I see myself like that woman my my boy is like that of that woman but when I see there's Elijah there's no elij in the board in the Bible there was El I'm like that woman Lord my child is sick I need Elijah I'm identify myself to that woman so where I would like you I need lar that woman prayed for the whole night she stayed in the presence of the Lord and she spoke to God and God said unto her stand at the door of your home I will send you Elijah my brother and sisters Elijah was a was in the flight but just because that woman ascended it's a prayer to God to the throne of God that prayer entered to God's presence created something in made flight to land in the city where woman was stay was leaving and the flight the pilot said I don't know why but I think we got to we got to land first then we're going to continue the flight when they landed was in the flight he went out and said something said unto him just continue go forward keep walking said where I going the word told me just continue walking forward just move forward because there was a woman was like aam woman stay in the in the presence of God she created an atmosphere and atmosphere went up created the the break into the flight prayer made with the deepest deepest sincerity going to create an atmosphere an atmosphere going to produce result and continue walking because he was a prisoner of Christ a true type of a prisoner of Christ he didn't ask himself why he Wasing he didn't ask himself questions so he just moved forward by singing I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so happy to be one of them that's why so many times we got to sing because the songs created create atmospheres and Bram moved forward after walking a long distance he he perceive something he perceive a woman standing with a woman weing some the woman greet said morning Pastor who knows me in this place that I'm a pastor and and I said to that woman do I know you she said no you don't know me but I know you because the Lord the Lord showed me your your face at night when I was praying he said that you will come that's why I was standing here since since early in the morning believing that you are going to pass by here when you've done a sincere prayer to God you're going to see you have to believe to your prayer yes my brother and sisters and that woman they entered in the house in the [Music] house I found a child was a boy was saying the it's dark in this place I can feel that in the darkness in hell too dark who can get me out of here and the child was crying so the child was dying the child needed somebody to save and in that condition I had compassion of the child I had compassion of that woman and I said unto her woman you should start praying first andam said when the woman started praying I was in front of a person who knows to whom she was talking to she never to pray but I realized that was in front of somebody who knows the person to whom she was talking to she really prayed and they were all on their knees Pray when she finished praying started praying he started praying and finished before finished praying the child child Mama now it's clear it's now clear and the child has been saved and the sicknesses that that he had God gave him a baptism of and later on two years later on saw somebody greeting him morning Pastor he said brother don't you know me anymore I'm that boy that you prayed for the Lord didn't only heal my sickness but he have saved me now I'm a preacher of the word of God yes my brother and sisters because of Prayer woman who was so sincere God has saved the life of a child that's
