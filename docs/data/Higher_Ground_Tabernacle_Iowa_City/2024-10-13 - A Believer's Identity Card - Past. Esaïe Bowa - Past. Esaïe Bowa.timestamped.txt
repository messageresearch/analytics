[55:41] it only reason why I came late and may
[55:45] you forgive me one more
[55:51] time we're going to open our Bibles
[55:57] in The Book of Mark
[56:01] 16 verse 14 to
[56:04] [Music]
[56:24] 20 afterwards as they lay at the table
[56:28] he was manifested to the 11 and
[56:30] reproached them with their unbelief and
[56:33] hardness of their heart because they had
[56:35] not believed those who had seen him
[56:39] risen and he said to them go into all
[56:43] the word and preach the Glad Tidings to
[56:45] all the
[56:46] creation he that believes and he his
[56:50] baptized shall be saved and he that be
[56:53] disbelieves shall be condemned and this
[56:56] sign shall follow those that believed in
[56:59] my name they shall cast out demons they
[57:02] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[57:05] take up Serpent and if they should drink
[57:08] any deadly thing it shall not injure
[57:10] them they shall lay L upon the infer and
[57:14] they shall be well the Lord therefore
[57:18] after he had spoken to them was taken up
[57:21] into heaven and sat at the right hand of
[57:24] God and they going forth going forth
[57:28] preach everywhere the Lord working with
[57:31] them and confirming the word by the
[57:33] signs following upon
[57:36] it we
[57:39] pray Our Father
[57:44] God as we approaching to you with the
[57:47] word we just
[57:49] read you're the best interpreter of your
[57:52] own word
[57:56] come and translate this word to
[58:01] us we want your presence to be real
[58:03] among
[58:08] us to take this word and give us the
[58:10] bread of life that in
[58:14] it because we know that we're living
[58:16] through
[58:18] it forgive us sin
[58:22] and forgive us uh transgressions
[58:28] forgive our
[58:33] laziness we want to give you this moment
[58:35] unto your
[58:37] hands May the Holy Spirit the the best
[58:42] teacher come and teach his word to his
[58:46] children as we surrend ourselves unto
[58:49] you in Jesus Christ Our God amen
[58:54] amen uh
[58:59] I would like to start say something to
[59:01] the
[59:06] church that some of reason that made me
[59:09] leave this
[59:15] area I believe I spoke with the
[59:19] deacons we had a conversation
[59:25] [Music]
[59:28] and I had some reason that made me leave
[59:31] you and go to the other
[59:36] side and I promise to be here every day
[59:39] of
[59:42] service but it happened for the service
[59:44] on
[59:48] Wednesday since I'm very far away I will
[59:51] not be able to be here on Wednesday
[59:57] and all that we spoke with the deacons
[59:59] the pastor know knows
[1:00:02] it he is your pastor he's also my
[1:00:07] pastor and he knows everything that's
[1:00:09] going on
[1:00:11] here and he will be here next
[1:00:14] Sunday to
[1:00:21] preach so don't worry everything is
[1:00:23] under the pastors
[1:00:27] so I couldn't stop myself come and
[1:00:30] preach because it was one of my
[1:00:34] promises but when it comes to uh the
[1:00:36] Wednesday
[1:00:40] service the pastor suggest that y can
[1:00:43] listen to the
[1:00:46] tape either listen to the de
[1:00:54] service if there's any servant of God to
[1:00:56] preach that's not a problem amen amen
[1:01:07] okay for this morning we will speak
[1:01:09] about 30 or 40
[1:01:14] minutes we we will speak about the
[1:01:17] identity card of a
[1:01:21] Believer the identity card of a believer
[1:01:26] because you
[1:01:28] know today in the entire
[1:01:32] world to do
[1:01:35] something we have to be
[1:01:39] identified to go to the
[1:01:42] Army go to
[1:01:45] univers to do whatever
[1:01:48] else we have to be
[1:01:51] identified is that true
[1:01:57] is a very important
[1:02:00] thing especially in the world in which
[1:02:02] we
[1:02:06] living so Charles brother Charles
[1:02:09] read
[1:02:11] Mark verse 14 to
[1:02:16] 20 I want to reread the verse 1 it says
[1:02:26] and these are the signs that shall
[1:02:28] follow those that are that have
[1:02:31] believed in my name they shall cast our
[1:02:35] demons they shall speak with new tongues
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:40] amen and in French he
[1:02:45] says we have to interpret
[1:02:47] it that
[1:02:53] means in this sign we will will
[1:02:56] recognize or known who those who
[1:02:59] believe so if you
[1:03:03] have there there are signs that have to
[1:03:09] identify in this sign there we recognize
[1:03:12] those who have
[1:03:15] believed there is an
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:18] identification it's an identification C
[1:03:23] of it is certified for a
[1:03:29] so those Miracles
[1:03:31] gathers the
[1:03:35] Bible these are the sign that shall
[1:03:37] follows those who have
[1:03:40] believed and many time the church
[1:03:44] has it was only about the
[1:03:49] preacher but these scriptures not only
[1:03:51] concerns the
[1:03:53] preacher a preacher is a believer
[1:03:58] before him to be a preacher he's got to
[1:04:00] be
[1:04:02] a he's got to identify himself as a True
[1:04:06] Believer even the one listening to the
[1:04:08] word he is a
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:14] Believer the same range as the the
[1:04:18] preacher that's why Jesus
[1:04:24] say these are signs shall follow those
[1:04:26] have
[1:04:28] who Jesus
[1:04:32] didn't these are the same that shall
[1:04:34] follow the
[1:04:35] preacher
[1:04:39] he these are the sign that shall follow
[1:04:41] who has
[1:04:43] belied if somebody claims to be
[1:04:46] a the signs has to
[1:04:49] follow anybody that claims to be a
[1:04:55] got to be signed to identify him as a
[1:04:59] Believer so believer doesn't come by
[1:05:02] your you don't identify by yourself by
[1:05:08] it but there are signs that has to
[1:05:11] follow
[1:05:13] you has to confirm you as a
[1:05:16] Believer so
[1:05:19] to saying claiming that you're a
[1:05:21] Believer it's not
[1:05:23] enough but if you are believer
[1:05:27] the signs has to
[1:05:30] follow I know we spoke about long time
[1:05:34] ago the spirit bringing back to
[1:05:37] it now hear
[1:05:40] this there are signs and wonders as
[1:05:43] Jesus
[1:05:45] said these are signs that shall
[1:05:48] follow those who have
[1:05:51] beli in my name they shall cast out
[1:05:54] demons
[1:05:56] if they drink any any any deadly
[1:06:00] thing shall not inure
[1:06:03] them we work upon
[1:06:07] the we land their hands upon
[1:06:10] the and they shall be
[1:06:13] well here's the card of
[1:06:16] identity if you
[1:06:19] are that sign have to follow
[1:06:22] you but before that sign to accomp
[1:06:28] before these wonders and
[1:06:30] miracles to be fulfilled in your
[1:06:33] life you're not a
[1:06:36] Believer that's what it
[1:06:40] means so those signs and
[1:06:45] wonders they strengthens the the uh the
[1:06:48] engagement of who those who
[1:06:51] preaches and those who listen to the
[1:06:53] word
[1:06:56] because the one who is preaching the
[1:06:58] preacher he has to be followed by sign
[1:07:02] and the one
[1:07:04] listening it has to be followed by those
[1:07:07] signs yes my brothers and
[1:07:10] sisters now hear what the
[1:07:13] prophet in the confirmation of the
[1:07:16] commission
[1:07:18] sayag
[1:07:21] 22 19
[1:07:25] and I think if you go down the
[1:07:29] street somewhere there at your
[1:07:32] job somebody approaches you and
[1:07:37] say I'm a commissioner of the police of
[1:07:40] the United
[1:07:44] States it's under this quality that I'm
[1:07:46] arresting
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:51] you say you will have the right to say
[1:07:53] to that man
[1:07:55] if you look at
[1:07:57] him he's in
[1:07:59] uniform he's wearing his badge
[1:08:05] that therefore that doesn't make him
[1:08:10] a it's not the fact that he's wearing a
[1:08:13] bad makes him
[1:08:17] officer officer of the United
[1:08:20] States
[1:08:24] say anybody can wear that that
[1:08:28] badge you can buy you you can buy a
[1:08:33] BGE to
[1:08:36] store a
[1:08:44] store you can go to good and buy you
[1:08:48] a you can go
[1:08:50] to and get you a
[1:08:52] uniform or anything else
[1:09:00] brother that doesn't make him an officer
[1:09:02] of United
[1:09:04] States even if he has a
[1:09:06] b and wearing a
[1:09:12] unifor making him a
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:17] officer for him to
[1:09:22] Iden he's got to hold that
[1:09:25] ification
[1:09:30] card to affirm his declaration that he
[1:09:33] is a officer of United
[1:09:38] States says otherwise he's nothing as
[1:09:40] long as that he's not
[1:09:43] confirmed he has confirmed his
[1:09:46] commission he does it by by
[1:09:51] De to confirm that he's an agent
[1:09:57] his commission has been sealed by the
[1:09:59] United States of
[1:10:01] America that's why when you look at your
[1:10:06] it see there's a seal of the there's a
[1:10:10] token on
[1:10:13] your and that's that's what
[1:10:16] makes but
[1:10:19] insist says for him wearing a badge
[1:10:23] or being uniform or
[1:10:28] not as long as he got his little
[1:10:32] identification he's a worker of the
[1:10:35] police and that's his
[1:10:38] commission that's his
[1:10:41] job just a
[1:10:43] uniform that will not
[1:10:47] work well we know that Jesus
[1:10:50] say mark
[1:10:55] all that is sent by
[1:10:58] commission there had to be a a
[1:11:01] Vindication what is that
[1:11:05] Vindication these are the miracle the
[1:11:08] signs that shall follow those have
[1:11:12] believed the prophet
[1:11:17] says he didn't say maybe it shall follow
[1:11:21] them or maybe it would it may follow
[1:11:24] them but he said
[1:11:27] says go
[1:11:28] everywhere
[1:11:31] says somebody wants to delete this
[1:11:35] commission is that way to make it a
[1:11:38] little
[1:11:41] bigger and he
[1:11:45] say seems like somebody wants to delete
[1:11:48] that
[1:11:50] commission 2,000 years ago but Jesus
[1:11:54] say
[1:11:56] everywhere to the entire
[1:11:59] creation these are the sign that shall
[1:12:03] follow
[1:12:04] everywhere to the entire
[1:12:07] nation
[1:12:15] Prophet those were miracle that has to
[1:12:18] follow them to to to vindicate the
[1:12:22] creation identification
[1:12:27] as long as you don't have
[1:12:30] Miracles that means you're
[1:12:32] not that means he's not a
[1:12:35] Believer that's why I want
[1:12:39] you in you to be born that
[1:12:42] desire of
[1:12:44] seeking your
[1:12:48] identity God
[1:12:53] identify he say it was
[1:12:57] that had to
[1:12:58] follow to approve that
[1:13:03] identification says in paragra
[1:13:08] 33 how come a man can claim that the
[1:13:10] baptis or the Holy
[1:13:14] Spirit how come a man can claim that the
[1:13:17] the healing of the
[1:13:20] sickness how come a man can
[1:13:23] declare speaking in tongue doesn't
[1:13:26] exist that casting demons out doesn't
[1:13:31] exist those were the signs of
[1:13:36] identification that Jesus put on under
[1:13:38] each uh believer that he have
[1:13:42] S says that's the
[1:13:45] authority says you can go to scho and
[1:13:48] get a doctor philosop get a
[1:13:52] PhD phos
[1:13:55] in PhD

[1:13:59] do it's in
[1:14:04] right your identification according to
[1:14:07] that
[1:14:08] organization I'm
[1:14:11] saying but the identification through
[1:14:14] Jesus when he's sending
[1:14:17] some his
[1:14:21] identific these are the Miracles or the
[1:14:24] signs that shall follow those that have
[1:14:30] believed that's this is what identify a
[1:14:33] man that has been sent from God am amen
[1:14:36] brothers and
[1:14:38] sisters if we are
[1:14:41] believers signs have to follow
[1:14:44] us I am not
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:48] saying you have to start looking for
[1:14:50] miracles and want that's not what I'm
[1:14:52] saying but I want to say
[1:14:56] if you are a
[1:14:57] Believer the signs and wonders shall
[1:15:01] follow I am not telling you to go seek
[1:15:04] for those sign that's not what the
[1:15:06] prophet's saying amen
[1:15:12] amen the signs has to identify the
[1:15:15] Believers andam
[1:15:18] say no matter any
[1:15:21] any unifor can g a uniform
[1:15:27] to get the identity
[1:15:31] card that that has been certified
[1:15:36] and with a
[1:15:41] judgment to prove that your birth is uh
[1:15:47] undoubtable that only requires
[1:15:50] Jesus only Jesus who has to confirm
[1:15:55] and it will confirm that to your a
[1:15:57] Believer when the the signs shall
[1:16:01] follow and you will approve your
[1:16:04] birth for you to get an
[1:16:06] identity you have to first be born and
[1:16:10] when you
[1:16:12] born there's got to be a
[1:16:15] confirmation that this child is
[1:16:17] alive they give him an ID
[1:16:21] card now
[1:16:26] we can never receive from
[1:16:28] God the
[1:16:31] confirmation if we have never been
[1:16:35] born you got to be born in the kingdom
[1:16:37] of God amen amen
[1:16:42] amen I know some
[1:16:44] of thought they
[1:16:47] elsewhere I was
[1:16:51] expecting they thinking of something
[1:16:54] else they say
[1:16:59] if you can clear off everything from
[1:17:01] your mind we are in the house of the
[1:17:05] Lord there's nothing that's impossible
[1:17:07] to
[1:17:10] God so please clear off everything that
[1:17:12] can come in your
[1:17:14] mind you know when we come in the house
[1:17:16] of the
[1:17:17] Lord our mind has to be
[1:17:21] pure you cannot be sitting in the house
[1:17:23] of the Lord
[1:17:25] and uh
[1:17:28] minimizing that means you don't know
[1:17:29] what you came
[1:17:31] to if you in a house of the
[1:17:34] Lord you got to love the
[1:17:37] person and in that way you'll be
[1:17:40] help but if you start
[1:17:43] taking say what is it
[1:17:46] saying you will get out of
[1:17:48] here as you
[1:17:50] can promising
[1:17:52] you that you can even get wor wor than
[1:17:55] you what you
[1:17:57] wear so in the house of the
[1:18:00] Lord we got to have a pure
[1:18:03] mind yes brothers and sisters now hear
[1:18:07] this I'm trying to tell you this that as
[1:18:11] a
[1:18:13] Believer we have to be Vindicated by
[1:18:17] God it's not
[1:18:20] about that we took that day
[1:18:24] about that
[1:18:26] testimony you gave that
[1:18:29] day if you a
[1:18:31] Believer them signs has to follow
[1:18:34] you the prophet
[1:18:37] teaches there are three types of
[1:18:39] Bel the True
[1:18:42] Believer the
[1:18:45] unbel and a semi
[1:18:49] believer so what
[1:18:52] happened we all believe that we were all
[1:18:56] believers when we speak when we
[1:19:00] speak the entire church identifies the
[1:19:03] because I have never
[1:19:06] seen somebody claiming that he's a half
[1:19:09] believer I have never
[1:19:12] seen a person saying that I'm
[1:19:15] an we all claim to be a
[1:19:18] believer but to be a
[1:19:21] believer you have to be Vindicated
[1:19:25] God has to Vindicated that you a
[1:19:28] Believer it's not the water
[1:19:30] of it's not the brother in which we
[1:19:35] are that makes you say that you're a
[1:19:38] Believer I want us to get to that
[1:19:42] level but each one of us identifies as
[1:19:45] believer I am called you are called
[1:19:50] belever God know us as believers
[1:19:54] why I have brought this to you the
[1:19:57] prophet
[1:19:59] said that was been transmitted to the
[1:20:01] Saints
[1:20:03] once paragraph
[1:20:06] 114
[1:20:09] says now
[1:20:12] no Jesus was
[1:20:14] rejected
[1:20:17] well let's take the great Paul St Paul
[1:20:20] excuse sorry
[1:20:44] that's why sometimes I don't like to use
[1:20:46] this iPad
[1:21:01] and the prophet
[1:21:03] says Mage faith that was transmitted to
[1:21:08] the paragraph 114 it
[1:21:12] says now notice
[1:21:15] friends Jesus was
[1:21:21] rejected let's consider the Great
[1:21:25] now let's take this line he say here
[1:21:32] says fight for the faith that was
[1:21:38] W that was that has been transmitted to
[1:21:41] the Saints once for
[1:21:43] all that's even the title of
[1:21:48] the that has been transmitted to the
[1:21:50] Saints once for all now the prophet says
[1:21:55] and Paul
[1:21:56] say fight for the
[1:22:00] faith transmitted to the S once for
[1:22:04] all that was from the beginning
[1:22:07] transmitted
[1:22:09] the and what is that
[1:22:13] faith those are
[1:22:15] Miracles and
[1:22:21] wonders that's the faith that was that
[1:22:24] has been
[1:22:27] but today
[1:22:28] everyone we are called
[1:22:31] belever this one has his own
[1:22:34] faith and he's calling his
[1:22:37] Doctrine he says I don't believe in such
[1:22:41] things in our church we don't believe in
[1:22:44] this as we believe in this as we believe
[1:22:47] such
[1:22:49] way our church don't believe in
[1:22:53] such people call their
[1:22:57] faith their way
[1:22:59] of they call it they call
[1:23:02] it that's not what called Faith he says
[1:23:07] faith he says faith is Miracles and
[1:23:11] wonders
[1:23:14] see God has confirmed his
[1:23:17] church with
[1:23:20] what all along with
[1:23:25] he say it was not by
[1:23:28] an but God has
[1:23:31] Church Miracles
[1:23:34] and says is that
[1:23:38] right not the one who has the greatest
[1:23:45] group not the one who has the the
[1:23:47] greatest
[1:23:49] Doctrine but he has confirmed
[1:23:53] them vindicate them with
[1:23:59] Miracles it says that's where God
[1:24:03] dwells we want to see
[1:24:06] God God dwelling in mirac and
[1:24:13] wonders I told
[1:24:15] you that I'm
[1:24:19] tired preaching with
[1:24:22] scriptures I want for a moment
[1:24:26] after
[1:24:27] preaching using
[1:24:30] scriptures I want to say
[1:24:33] now we put the scriptures
[1:24:36] aside and now we want to see God to come
[1:24:40] down vindicating his
[1:24:44] scriptures that's the purpose of the
[1:24:47] church that's the goal of a
[1:24:49] Believer please don't
[1:24:52] sleep we mys and S my brothers and
[1:24:58] sisters and
[1:25:00] now he
[1:25:05] say says Jesus cannot accept a
[1:25:10] man who is not born from water and
[1:25:13] spirit amen amen he
[1:25:18] says he will not enter to the kingdom
[1:25:24] after receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:25:27] spirit said these are
[1:25:30] signs that shall follow those who that
[1:25:33] have and
[1:25:35] brother he says that that is straight
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:42] amen even before getting the Holy
[1:25:45] Spirit you were not yet a
[1:25:49] beli before I get the Holy Spirit
[1:25:54] wasn't yet a
[1:25:57] Believer anybody to to get the
[1:26:00] holy they were not yet the
[1:26:03] believer yes brothers and
[1:26:06] sisters now the prophet
[1:26:09] says
[1:26:13] message
[1:26:20] parag says this is straight ahead
[1:26:24] after you receive the Holy
[1:26:29] Ghost now these are the sign that shall
[1:26:31] follow those that have
[1:26:35] believed says it's not
[1:26:39] going but it's coming from straight from
[1:26:42] the Bible Jesus has never
[1:26:46] said maybe those Miracle Miracles will
[1:26:51] accompan but Jesus said that shall
[1:26:54] follow
[1:26:56] them and I found in the message
[1:27:00] today people that have created
[1:27:04] groups there are people who
[1:27:07] says us is only the
[1:27:11] word we don't need all these other stuff
[1:27:15] oh speaking in
[1:27:18] Tong Divine Healing you don't want those
[1:27:24] but people are
[1:27:26] sick how are they going to get
[1:27:30] healed says when we
[1:27:32] read he says since
[1:27:34] when Divine
[1:27:37] Healing has stopped to exist since
[1:27:41] when the Holy
[1:27:43] Ghost stopped to
[1:27:45] exist the same holy
[1:27:48] ghost that anoints the pre for the
[1:27:52] word it is the same
[1:27:55] that has to operate Mir signs and
[1:28:06] wonders cannot happen if they don't
[1:28:09] work a church
[1:28:12] sleep and expecting
[1:28:18] Miracles it's never going to
[1:28:20] Happ Miracles and wers
[1:28:25] there are signs that vindicate a
[1:28:27] Believer a
[1:28:29] Believer is not the one sleeping but
[1:28:33] aever is the one who
[1:28:37] works who works his soul
[1:28:40] out and when he works his
[1:28:43] home signs start following
[1:28:50] him I remember one day
[1:28:57] I had a friend who called me he told me
[1:29:01] my friend my
[1:29:03] wife my wife is in a
[1:29:07] hospital and she's pregnant with
[1:29:11] twin it seems like one of the
[1:29:14] twin where he's
[1:29:19] sitting they said that he's the liquid
[1:29:22] that's uh in the baby
[1:29:24] in the mother's room is getting
[1:29:31] low and the mods know that a child
[1:29:33] cannot be born with
[1:29:35] that cuz where that child
[1:29:37] is he is in
[1:29:42] that in that liquid that's
[1:29:47] where protects the
[1:29:49] child there's a lot of nutrition in that
[1:29:52] liid but now
[1:29:55] one of the twin
[1:29:58] was because that liquid was getting
[1:30:01] lower and it was
[1:30:05] fading brother was in the hospital with
[1:30:07] his
[1:30:08] wife and I was going to work he called
[1:30:12] me
[1:30:13] say we in the hospital
[1:30:16] now I want you to pray for us I told him
[1:30:21] my dear friend I'll pray for you
[1:30:24] Lord will do something it was on
[1:30:28] Friday Sunday I came here to
[1:30:31] preach when I left here I went back
[1:30:36] home I felt a
[1:30:39] presence i f an
[1:30:42] anointing when I came home around 8:00
[1:30:45] p.m. I started
[1:30:48] praying I'm feeling
[1:30:50] this I've got to pray for that brother
[1:30:54] I went to my closet I closed it up my
[1:30:58] wife wasn't
[1:30:59] there she
[1:31:01] was I started praying started
[1:31:05] praying so I was
[1:31:07] praying and I felt an
[1:31:11] anointing I felt like I was talking with
[1:31:13] somebody in front of
[1:31:14] me and I found
[1:31:18] myself speaking words I said Lord God
[1:31:24] I'm taking
[1:31:25] control and I'm claiming that child in
[1:31:30] the other that is going
[1:31:32] to and that
[1:31:35] liquid will be
[1:31:39] refilled and I end up my prayer around 8
[1:31:44] p.m. and I found out that I've prayed
[1:31:46] for 30
[1:31:47] minutes and when the prayer
[1:31:51] was I went to pick up my wife
[1:31:54] came back
[1:31:56] home on Monday I didn't call my
[1:31:59] friend and on Tuesday he's the one call
[1:32:02] he started telling me how are you doing
[1:32:05] I
[1:32:06] said and we spoke about different things
[1:32:09] and then I ask
[1:32:11] him even before I asked him he told said
[1:32:14] my friend do you know said what's going
[1:32:17] on he say you
[1:32:20] know you know remember the other twin
[1:32:23] that was in the other
[1:32:25] room the doctor told
[1:32:29] us that the situation is getting
[1:32:34] better and they don't
[1:32:36] understand here in the United
[1:32:39] States and I told
[1:32:45] him I don't want to claim that
[1:32:48] miracle I said wait tell
[1:32:51] me when did the doctor
[1:32:57] that that liquid has refilled he
[1:33:03] said say they told us around 8 p.m. on
[1:33:08] Sunday I told him now listen my
[1:33:11] friend it was around the same
[1:33:14] time that I was in praying for yourid I
[1:33:18] pray the
[1:33:19] Lord I felt a
[1:33:22] presence and I spoke the
[1:33:24] word and
[1:33:26] now now I can
[1:33:29] vindicate that God can exhaust
[1:33:35] prayer before receiving the Holy
[1:33:39] Spirit we're not a
[1:33:42] Believer God is not calling
[1:33:45] us even if we go to the
[1:33:48] Bap God is not calling us believers
[1:33:54] and we stayed
[1:33:55] there because we uh we
[1:33:59] took in a certain
[1:34:02] church and we start working with the
[1:34:05] faith of the church with the doctrine of
[1:34:08] the church and we claiming and we
[1:34:11] say this is the faith of our
[1:34:15] church
[1:34:17] but brand
[1:34:20] says so Paul says he say
[1:34:26] let's
[1:34:27] fight for
[1:34:29] the that faith that has been
[1:34:32] trans once for all for all the saints
[1:34:38] brother faith that was
[1:34:41] transmitted he says
[1:34:43] that are the
[1:34:45] sign that shall follow those that have
[1:34:49] believed if we have to
[1:34:52] fight the only way
[1:34:55] for us to
[1:34:58] fight it's not
[1:35:01] for to say
[1:35:05] that we are
[1:35:07] in we are in
[1:35:10] eternity the only time we have to
[1:35:13] fight to have a
[1:35:15] debate it's when we
[1:35:18] com to say that what what was the fa
[1:35:21] that transmitted to the Saints once
[1:35:24] in my life and in your
[1:35:29] life I will read
[1:35:33] it cuz I
[1:35:36] know I know how many people have been
[1:35:40] IND by many
[1:35:42] things and sometimes they don't make no
[1:35:47] sense have any relationship with the
[1:35:50] what the message the purpose of the
[1:35:51] message
[1:35:53] Miss says in the message
[1:36:06] uh says the last commission that he gave
[1:36:10] to his
[1:36:13] church the sign shall follow
[1:36:17] those he says go to
[1:36:19] Jerusalem to every
[1:36:24] the gospel to entire
[1:36:26] nature he said preach to the white
[1:36:29] man preach to the black
[1:36:31] man to the brown to the
[1:36:34] yellow even to the
[1:36:36] r to the entire nature and
[1:36:41] say he says the gospel is the new good
[1:36:46] news preach it to the entire
[1:36:50] nature until the end of the world
[1:36:53] go to
[1:36:55] the preach the
[1:36:59] gospel and now have a
[1:37:03] question what is that gospel we have
[1:37:07] preached oh maybe we have preached to
[1:37:11] our or we just got ourselves as
[1:37:15] Africans
[1:37:17] saying says preach to the
[1:37:19] white PR preach to the yell preach to
[1:37:22] the red
[1:37:26] why are we
[1:37:27] Gathering only
[1:37:31] con that we have made the the the works
[1:37:34] of the
[1:37:35] Gospel there's something that's missing
[1:37:39] because the
[1:37:39] gopel it's the good news and Paul say he
[1:37:46] says preaching it's not about
[1:37:49] repeating
[1:37:51] spech Paul says I didn't come
[1:37:55] with our
[1:37:57] pers our speech
[1:38:00] of but I've came to
[1:38:02] you the
[1:38:04] demonstration of the power of
[1:38:07] God so preaching the
[1:38:09] word is demonstrating the
[1:38:12] power that's why there's no white
[1:38:16] man that's why there's no red
[1:38:18] man because we know each other somebody
[1:38:22] lives
[1:38:24] you got to come to the church where the
[1:38:27] child of my unle you cannot live
[1:38:31] here if you don't go to the same church
[1:38:34] as and that's why we find our between
[1:38:40] conges but if the the gospel is
[1:38:43] pre and being
[1:38:46] demonstrated and when the go will with
[1:38:51] demonstration of God's power
[1:38:54] a white man will come down red man will
[1:38:57] come
[1:38:59] down will preached to the entire
[1:39:04] nature and now you will say who is a
[1:39:07] white
[1:39:08] man do we need a white man here no no
[1:39:13] the
[1:39:15] gopel preach to the entire
[1:39:18] nature as long as we are just between
[1:39:21] us we have failed to the of the
[1:39:24] church I will never cease to
[1:39:28] repat as long as we just
[1:39:30] between between
[1:39:33] us we have lacked the we have missed the
[1:39:36] the purpose go of the
[1:39:40] Gospel the gospel has to be preached
[1:39:43] with demonstration of God's
[1:39:46] power in the entire world
[1:39:54] preach I have to speak about 45
[1:39:57] minutes
[1:40:02] says says in the
[1:40:06] message where we just
[1:40:10] read says in paragraph
[1:40:13] 27 let's read paragraph 26
[1:40:18] first says
[1:40:23] not just here these are the miracle that
[1:40:26] may follow those who has
[1:40:29] made they got to follow
[1:40:32] them if they cl
[1:40:35] to they are genuine
[1:40:39] believer Miracles has to follow
[1:40:43] them but the
[1:40:45] ver the verb
[1:40:47] has it is a
[1:40:50] must if we are believers
[1:40:54] miracles must follow
[1:40:58] us it shall follow those has that have
[1:41:03] believed speaking
[1:41:08] correctly and man cannot be a
[1:41:12] believer before this
[1:41:14] happen what has to be
[1:41:16] happen these are signs that shall follow
[1:41:21] those that have believed
[1:41:23] paragraph
[1:41:24] 27 it says None one
[1:41:27] church has the right to claim to be a
[1:41:30] church that
[1:41:33] believes before this miracle follow have
[1:41:37] followed says that's what Jesus
[1:41:40] say that's what he what does does it
[1:41:45] makes the word being
[1:41:48] manifested my brothers and
[1:41:50] sisters when a man is born from God
[1:41:55] each word that God
[1:41:58] has if you feel like you got God in
[1:42:01] you you will believe in this
[1:42:03] word but if you just
[1:42:06] take and reject the other
[1:42:08] side that means you don't have God in
[1:42:14] you when you are filled with the Holy
[1:42:18] Spirit when he's filled the Holy
[1:42:21] Ghost Reed the holy spirit that
[1:42:25] given if he was born by the spirit of
[1:42:28] God Jesus said in Mark
[1:42:30] 16 these are sign that shall
[1:42:33] follow yes my brothers and
[1:42:37] sisters this is the sign that has to
[1:42:39] follow the
[1:42:40] Believers brother
[1:42:45] says three C of people the
[1:42:49] believer this soal believer the
[1:42:54] unbeliever he
[1:42:57] says only those three category of
[1:43:01] people group
[1:43:05] of a group
[1:43:07] of and a group of
[1:43:10] unbelief
[1:43:13] says if you a genuine believer Jesus
[1:43:18] said these are signs that shall follow
[1:43:21] those that have believed
[1:43:23] in my name they
[1:43:25] shall and they will speak new
[1:43:27] tongues if they have to
[1:43:30] be if they have to walk upon
[1:43:34] Serpent and will not injure
[1:43:38] them if they lay their hands
[1:43:41] upon sick shall be
[1:43:43] healed that's
[1:43:46] true as long as the word of God is
[1:43:50] true they will walk upon serpents
[1:43:55] today we all
[1:43:57] scared when we all see
[1:44:01] a when we we see an we all
[1:44:06] afraid but I remember in the
[1:44:08] Bible when a snake came out from the
[1:44:12] bush and bite beaten
[1:44:15] somebody and that person
[1:44:18] was Paul just took SN and
[1:44:23] thrw him in a fire he didn't
[1:44:27] cry he didn't
[1:44:29] wonder and the people that
[1:44:32] was they were expecting Paul to
[1:44:35] die or maybe something to happen to but
[1:44:38] the man was standing he stood
[1:44:42] alive nothing happened to
[1:44:44] him I
[1:44:46] remember
[1:44:48] day
[1:44:50] brother he was beaten by his
[1:44:55] when was fishing
[1:45:00] with saw that big
[1:45:03] fish so he couldn't get it out of the
[1:45:05] water brother
[1:45:08] said for you
[1:45:13] brother and he dived into the
[1:45:17] waters says he took off his
[1:45:21] shoes and when he got to the
[1:45:24] he was in
[1:45:26] a and there was a
[1:45:29] snake that that bites
[1:45:35] brother saw him
[1:45:37] crying
[1:45:40] started he felt like his
[1:45:45] bones was fighting between
[1:45:47] them he had big
[1:45:50] pains says
[1:45:53] I get I got closer and we got him out
[1:45:56] water and I got closer to
[1:45:59] him Brown says I just looked at his feet
[1:46:02] I could see I could see the teeth the
[1:46:05] the print of
[1:46:06] the I just laid my hand on his feet and
[1:46:11] I said I said Lord
[1:46:13] God said in your
[1:46:16] word they shall walk upon serpent
[1:46:23] injured
[1:46:24] them say once in
[1:46:27] a and all the pain disapp and
[1:46:34] even and we fished for three days
[1:46:38] without having any
[1:46:40] issues when he went back
[1:46:42] home he told it to people and people
[1:46:45] told
[1:46:47] him you better go see a
[1:46:50] doctor said
[1:46:53] if the Lord
[1:46:56] God
[1:46:59] rescued he had rescued me since that day
[1:47:03] I
[1:47:04] believe that he will
[1:47:06] take take care
[1:47:09] of I do not need to see a
[1:47:15] doctor never die because of that bite of
[1:47:19] the
[1:47:21] serpent We Got to Believe In such God
[1:47:25] God I know medicine
[1:47:28] heals but I don't think
[1:47:31] medicine has to be our first
[1:47:34] option as
[1:47:36] Believers we got to
[1:47:39] know that we have
[1:47:41] gotten the
[1:47:43] authority walk under the
[1:47:45] snakes and
[1:47:48] Scorpion even if it's a deadly thing
[1:47:52] drink
[1:47:53] it's not going to hurt
[1:47:57] you now
[1:47:59] listen and in this message we
[1:48:02] had we had many cases
[1:48:05] of where people has
[1:48:08] been they didn't even know it was and
[1:48:11] God kept them
[1:48:13] alive we have we need that God if we
[1:48:17] come here
[1:48:18] church for the word to be preached
[1:48:22] not to just to fill our head with
[1:48:25] knowledge so that we don't use those
[1:48:27] knowledge the word is
[1:48:30] preached for us to practice
[1:48:35] it yes my brothers and
[1:48:38] sisters and I'll finish with
[1:48:45] this we can continue with this next
[1:48:48] time I'll close by here
[1:48:53] knowing that Pastor will be here next
[1:48:56] Sunday and
[1:48:58] now he
[1:49:02] says says not only those who
[1:49:07] say but the belever that's
[1:49:10] identif I'm in the
[1:49:14] message they
[1:49:17] will they probably uh follow them
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:24] he wants to say that it's not what the
[1:49:25] scripture say the scripture didn't
[1:49:29] say they probably will not follow
[1:49:32] them that
[1:49:35] probably maybe they shall
[1:49:37] follow Jesus
[1:49:39] say
[1:49:41] shall those that have
[1:49:44] believed
[1:49:47] say it says it's ABS
[1:49:50] absolutely so that for that not
[1:49:53] be because he
[1:49:56] said You shall do the same works that I
[1:49:59] did that's the
[1:50:02] identification identification of
[1:50:06] Jes about to manifest the word of God
[1:50:09] that who he is he
[1:50:11] was if we
[1:50:13] claim that we've received the
[1:50:16] word we cannot
[1:50:19] manifest we cannot
[1:50:22] that means we didn't receive that
[1:50:26] word I told
[1:50:28] you I'm trying to
[1:50:30] make that
[1:50:33] thirst of using the
[1:50:35] word the word that we have listened for
[1:50:39] all these
[1:50:40] years
[1:50:42] it's it's not important just to listen
[1:50:45] and
[1:50:47] listen without practicing what we
[1:50:51] listen we are called
[1:50:54] without any sign following
[1:50:56] us it doesn't even B
[1:50:59] us that means we not even
[1:51:03] Believers if you are a
[1:51:05] Believer sign has to follow you if I am
[1:51:09] a the signs has to follow
[1:51:12] me but before the follow
[1:51:16] me then we not beli we just read it
[1:51:21] that's what the prophet say
[1:51:23] and
[1:51:24] today the identification of the
[1:51:28] church
[1:51:31] manifesting that was promised for this
[1:51:34] by the same
[1:51:36] spirit that that that
[1:51:41] was
[1:51:49] and that quickened the word in that time
[1:51:53] he says
[1:51:55] today he said today the same the word
[1:51:59] for the
[1:52:00] believer and is's manifesting the
[1:52:05] same showing that the sign is on that
[1:52:07] that person
[1:52:10] means the life resurrected of Jesus
[1:52:13] Christ Living in his
[1:52:16] believer that had to to burn in the
