of the Lord I'm happy to see the of faces of people Shining we're coming in this presence being happy we're not coming to church for somebody and we gotta show him that we so happy in his presence amen because sometimes you're asking ourselves are people worshiping in a church but you'll see another one sitting there and he's very squeezed so we ask is he uh is he angry against God no you came for that God so why coming in his house you're not ready to worship Him amen amen and we're not coming to church for somebody not for the preacher a preacher is just a man like you know you know the young people that wants to know this technology we are from the old school we are from all schools may God bless you okay that's it we thank the Lord Jesus this morning for the breath of life to be in good health it's a Grace amen amen um so that you can know how to appreciate that's what I'm saying thank you Lord for the goodness it doesn't have a price it's priceless we thank God for that [Music] and we also thank Pastor Brooks the pastor uh you might call me or on the week and I was I was at work and he I missed his call and then he left me a message that I should call him back and he asked me if it was possible for me to preach while he's not there and I told him that it's always a great joy for me that's why we've been called personal service for each service thank you we thank you for his trust that he put in US and that trust is through you that are working with him if you guys didn't trust us he wouldn't trust us too if the pastor trust us is because of you amen amen that's why uh we don't want to abuse that trust as long as Lord would like for us to come again and we want to stay in the uh in the inner rules in the rules of the king amen that's why we've also spoken about the principle of the world he cannot show the people the principle if yourself you're not living by those principles the principle is to know how this this house works or what the father believes what the mother believes how do they eat their children then you respect those rules when you get into a house you're not going to place your feet upon somebody's table who received you amen amen that's how we're gonna walk because if we have a spirit of Christ we're going to show manifest Christ because Christ is the peace may the Lord be blessed we also thank you who because without you we wouldn't be precious hallelujah amen it's because of you amen amen as it says in First Corinthians he said it's because of you no songs that we are called Egypt hallelujah amen Because of You amen amen and since I've been praying Lord what would I like to preach and what do you want me to preach them amen amen so that was since yesterday that I was seeking for his his will not seeking for the preaching but it's weird because you are on this on this road since 20 years ago we couldn't miss anything to preach amen amen then something came to my mind it is inspiration and this morning what I preach upon why the message of the end time I didn't want to continue with the principle of the world because it's going to take us more months but everything that we're preaching is upon the principle of the word of God but we want to place that like a foundation amen amen it's not a preaching foreign God is looking only to his own word you only look at his words once you respects his words and the word gives you the answer that's how God has blessed it self but it's him who's saying through his Prophet amen amen amen that's why it's more important those who make or realize many things it's not necessarily those who have got a lot of money no no but there are those who respect the principles you see for example you know like the the kind of the job that we're doing is [Music] the base salary is around two thousand three thousand someone else can earn more than that six thousand seven thousand it doesn't mean it's only him who can make more money than you no no amen amen [Music] you go together in your house you can't wait you're gonna realize more than what someone else is anyway I know what I'm talking about amen amen that's the principles you can earn a lot and you don't spend it in the beans and in many things or you are in those things that people are in a showing up like people have to see me I mean we've seen that with the people in the world and they ain't not being poor amen amen but you once you got a vision that's the principles hallelujah amen that's the same thing with the word of God why are we coming to church why God has created us here today and where are we where are we going to Sunday School with their child understanding are you a Christian yeah yeah because daddy said I'm a I'm a Christian I mean Sunday school we are yeah [Music] and then we put we put hey and then we go home yeah that's the Christianity for that children that's the kind of gospel hallelujah amen do I want but it's not that for you and me custom we're not coming to church as a custom amen amen oblige to come to church maybe in Congo you can go to church so that they can give you something nobody's gonna come and seek you home let's go to church it's for your from your own from your own way that you come back because you know because you believe that going to church there's something more important than my sleeping there's something more important than my work change there's something more important so when we're coming to church we should be more serious to get to that goal otherwise you should come to church especially here in America everybody is independent rent for somebody and nobody's giving someone's money so when you come to God you should be serious that's foreign that's why the message of the end time message of end time today with those uh results there's a lot of things going on on the on the uh social media we don't even understand what is going on with social media amen amen every people out there they don't understand what is going on the social media I amen there's a bride who's preparing yourself and I believe that bride issue there's somebody who said us with the word of God this is somebody who knows why I believe there's someone who knows why is he going to church hallelujah amen why the end message or the message maybe we can ask a question from everyone here everyone could explain the message of the end time in his own way and I know most of the people are going to speak about Burnham it's a message and what is it that message of brother amen amen God have sent William [Music] talk about the pillow fights maybe we're going to talk about Jesus of men so why this message to bring us what is he going to bring and what are we wearing from this message amen amen if Brandon said you cannot seek for the Holy Ghost if you don't know what you can produce for you why are you seeking for something that you don't know hallelujah amen means the family how are they going to be married how how the how the father could accept his daughter to be married if you've got nothing my daughter just finish up your schools get a job then come and marry my daughter because you're not going to eat peppers hallelujah amen so the job so we know what the job means when I got to work I go to work because it gives me money and makes me independent and once I'm independent financially and just because I've got money I can leave my father's home I can be or with my salary I can be able with myself I can plan my life when I go to church I'll be praying God and looking to weigh our sisters now you're confident because your pocket of money and you working yes you're not gonna play six o'clock you're there amen yeah because I know the consequences of the world the result that the job gives me then I'm not gonna play with my job Hallelujah so the same thing in spiritual manner unless you know you know the result of the thing I love constantly conventory then you'll be concerned and and uh you be concerned Hallelujah when they talk about the Holy Ghost then you know what the Holy Ghost is you know where the Holy Ghost is taking YouTube you know what the Holy Ghost is bringing to you then you want to play with the play with the Holy Ghost amen the message of the end time what is he going to bring to you know the results foreign amen amen why the message of the end time oh we're gonna do with that like the same way we did with the plane of redemption is not important to go fast and people don't get anything hoping that we're still gonna be alive once more guy gonna play something in the heart of a possibility to call me to come and preach again then we can still continue the message victim there we're not going to abuse your time once it's time you can just uh let me know that it's time [Music] then you can let me know how many minutes are left from it finished I don't want to abuse with your time I would like to ask you to stand upon your feet to read the word of God amen amen foreign of redemption on the second part we're going to talk about the Roman Tommy from John 14 foreign [Music] foreign [Music] you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many missions and if it were not if it were not so I would have told you I got to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you to myself that way I am there you may be also and where I go you know and the way you know Thomas said to him Lord we did not we do not know where you're going and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth the life no one comes to the father except through me amen amen I'm gonna take it as a career Zechariah 14 or 14 1 2. Zechariah 14. State weakness fourteen one um much yeah foreign [Music] [Music] one to seven sorry foreign behold the day of the Lord is coming and your spoil will be divided in your mind on your meat for I will get all the nations against Jerusalem the series shall be taken the house reveal oh yeah so we're gonna jump to verse it shall be one day which is known to the Lord neither day nor night but at evening at evening time it shall happen that it will be light and in that day it shall be that Living Waters shall flow from Jerusalem half of them towards the Eastern Eastern Sea and half of them toward the Western sea in both summer and winter it shall occur we thank you for the reading of the word thank you Lord for the atmosphere that is Among Us this morning to connect the preacher to the to the audience so that all of us we can be taken in the high places in Jesus Christ where the holy spirit is going to speak to us this morning so that when we leave this place that our hearts were not burning we saw inside of us while speaking to us take the control of the meeting from the beginning to the end as we have so prayed basically in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior and our King amen amen what we see why are you sitting we'll take those scriptures two more scriptures we go into the Book of Joel 2 yeah Joel 2 20 20 23.

First Corinthians 15 45 47. [Music] government said is amen First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 and so it is written the first man Adam became a living being the last Adam became a living a life-giving spirit however the spiritual is not first but the natural and after all the spiritual the first man was of the earth made of dust the second man is the Lord From Heaven amen amen I believe we understand that the first Adam became a living living Soul the time of creation but the last Adam [Music] a Living spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen the first man was taken from the dust amen and the second is from Heaven the Lord Jesus amen amen the second and the last the second and the last Adam is from Heaven amen we are talking about why the end message of the message of the end time and we started with the Redemption plan thank you amen amen so before we go into our subject we want to say something brother Abraham said it's more important amen amen He suggests you stupid and it's also talking uh toward the preachers said it in you should be born again amen amen oh you gotta be born again of uh December 31st 1961. well anyway idea what I'm saying is in the west regions in there's a bad tree that animals are eating they call it or local wheat yeah yeah I mean it doesn't sound good in French but it's local it amen amen I don't know if people have heard people think about it or not I don't raise uh characters and stuff I don't know about that wheat yeah if uh if a horse eat that logo with he cannot do anything with that horse he becomes River Hallelujah foreign you cannot pull the wires and stuff on that horse amen amen he cannot do anything with that kind of uh of a horse they call it a local wheat your horses and all your cattle away from that location foreign [Music] [Music] you should be a bad Cowboy if you let your your horse eat such a witch [Music] it shows that you don't mind about it hallelujah amen to her you got your horse is a Shepherd who's got a ship hey you see that there's a local wheat over there just sit freely and you let them eat the lock wheat it's just that you don't mind you don't care about your sheep you don't care about your horse hallelujah amen break every if you let them eat the local wheat it shows that you negligent and a true Pastor every person a true seven of Christ it should be a bad representative a bad uh representative of Christ see [Music] if you let it ship eat something bad that's gonna take him away or the thing that gonna let me let him be uh somebody's gonna break the word of God somebody's gonna break the Commandment of God you cannot let your ship do that [Music] you should watch upon the ship attentively hallelujah amen what problems that's a proper uh food for the for the ship in our house the proper food for our children you always see how father our fathers are watching when somebody brings food at home not only to be a good food but it's not proper food for your children there's some children that are allergic to some kind of food and your children you know what to give your children or what not to give them so that when somebody's bringing food you watch upon the food you want to know what kind of food is that Hallelujah even if your sister or your your brother you always watch so that it doesn't disturb the health of your children it's the same with God we gotta eat the proper food for us hallelujah amen and we've got to watch upon the food so I'm not just anybody bring any food to your children even spiritually that kind of food can take them away from God or they can start showing some kind of a behavior please that can uh or disturb the church hallelujah amen maybe you can hear some situations somewhere what is happening or maybe the stuff the food that the children are eating what are you giving it to your children so that your children can be Rebel Hallelujah amen so when we give in to our children the proper food [Music] that's why we're talking about the message of the end times prepared for us and given in this end time by E7 the prophet that's the proper food for the children in this end time hallelujah amen that's why he says that was proper for the time of Florida that food is no more a proper food for us today the food for the time is no longer a proper food for us the food of the time of Pentecostal people it's no longer a proper food for us the child shall live by faith amen amen justification with Wesley and uh sanctification without the witch nobody gonna see God hallelujah amen and at a time of Pentecostal there was a manifestation of the gifts January it was a time of Luther amen amen amen and the son of the February it was a a son of January with a lot of intensity hallelujah amen [Music] and the son or the light of the match is the light of February with more intensity and the light of July at the end times it's daylight with more intensity to bring the sea to maturity amen but with more intensity with more intensity with more intensity is just the same Jesus but with more manifestation hallelujah amen praise God God be praised the message in this time and why the message of the end time amen amen Redemption [Music] which means redeeming what are we redeeming it's not buying but it's redeeming hallelujah amen oh we can only buy something new like brother John is selling his cars I need that I need your car brother to buy his car I wanna resell the cars I see brother John coming is not coming to buy it is him is coming to buy but if his brother John was coming to buy his own huh he's coming to redeem his call because from the start it was his own car he's just coming to take it back hallelujah amen amen amen and the Redemption plan is the plan of redeeming it means god want to redeem what belongs to him you want to take back what belongs to him at the start and that he has lost amen amen the Redemption plan amen amen why the plant we've been created in the image of God and God when he's doing something he may he make a plan don't be more intelligent you never plan something yeah and you you think that you're gonna do good what you're doing no you gotta sit down just make a plan for what what you want to do then see what you're gonna do ask the husband we sit down with our way see what we're gonna do let me say do you think do you think this and that oh no let me see this one let's do this way we're gonna do it this way when the plane is clear nobody gonna complain about it amen amen president nobody want to complain about it when everything is clear God is plenty even in the creation hallelujah amen when God wanted to redeem a man that Fallen here Redemption plan it was before the creation amen amen knowing the end before the beginning knowing already what is going to happen he prepared everything in advance for the Sinners before even a Man Has Fallen God has already planned for us the Redemption plan I'm saying this in the preaching foreign [Music] had a dream brother Lee had a dream on test the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus he wanted to do it in the name of the father son and spirit you didn't believe in the baptism of the in the name of the Jesus entrepreneur he was an entrepreneur and he was building houses [Music] I just had a dream he said a dream that I went to New Albany and I was building a house of someone and the guy gave me a plane of his house is it the way he place his windows [Music] at the same at a certain point corresponding so then Brother John want me to build him a house brings me a minute his house mrsen consumers build me this house I'll find my house when I take the blueprints I start checking the blueprint friends and brother John left I look to the windows I said no this doesn't look good now it shouldn't be here I gotta fix all those things on the blueprint foreign things according to myself and I build a house he said I changed the disposition of the things it's very nice I built a house in the manner that I thought it was the good one in the way that I think it's the right way hallelujah amen because when I look like he said this is not current he said this it's not gonna work then I'll preach in the way that I found it that people can please to people so that when people are gonna look at that they're gonna sing they're gonna jump they're gonna Shout hallelujah amen it's impossible hey when coming back from Florida I've already finished his house and he went looking for the blueprint when the men come he took back his blueprint Hallelujah amen and he said he didn't build the house the way I want you to be then I said unto him no I didn't even build your house they shouldn't be there then he said it shouldn't be there he said you gotta destroy this amen if you want me to pay you you gotta build a house according to my blueprint hallelujah amen if you want to be paid you're gonna respect my blueprint amen amen I have to respect the blueprint your message the message of William Branham just say what the depth Say Amen is becomes the wishes can affect from the beginning to the end you're just talking about what you know and we never hear what I'm talking in that no no no no no no no brother where is the blueprint the blueprint amen amen you know precious we can say things and people are confused everybody shall say Amen to that amen God continue the minister when he uh give Ministry it's beyond the prophet amen amen we are coming and um we only bring one the prophet of what the fool for the ship amen amen foreign to bring the sea to maturity Hallelujah praise God he said destroy this man this house if you want me to pay you [Music] there's a creek somewhere there's a stream somewhere that is Flowing flowing beside the house and we went to the Stream Jennifer parking I don't want to be I don't want demolish nobody Among Us never said would not like to see that demolition that day you finish the work you waiting for your salary and they're telling you to demolish that because he never followed the blueprint it's because you add the lock with it and it's affecting even the Builder and the ship he doesn't look only at his word he doesn't have fevers when brother is telling us today the food the book of The Master this book is in your hands it's in your hands why so that you don't eat a lot of weight the scriptures read the scriptures read even one page a day today things are made Are Made Simple we've got phones we've got phones for different things stop spending your time in your social media just take 10 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes listening to William Brothers listen to your pastor Maybe everything is online amen amen that's how we're growing spiritually that's how I will be saved amen amen the wolves that are coming into the Frog amen amen they are bringing the lock away to us amen amen and he said I don't want demolition of today hey I said before it's right now that we're supposed to do a thing correctly everybody just build according to the blueprint according to the plane look what what has given us uh given us the inspiration look how we uh while we're talking about the Plan of Redemption the play the Redemption plan has been made before the world is performed yeah God I've seen before the Redemption before even the form the word ordained and one and he was a slain Lamb of God before the foundation of the world before the world has been [Music] Redemption plain he said it in job seven of God 23rd of March February 23rd or 1955. paragraph 11 and job my seventh job the seven of God amen amen let's see what up innocent preaching 72. but I'm saying this the capital of Good Works has been paid the capital of welcoming has been placed the Redemption plan of God by the blood of Jesus Christ once for all [Music] cleans the the the the uh the guilty ones he said the the and where the sinners [Music] and to bring them to reconcile with God to restore and worry in the Garden of Eden with his wife with his beloved ones for no longer dying amen amen for no longer falling for no longer having source for no longer having funerals for no longer having tombs today oh God nothing everything is done wash in the blood of the Lamb with this perfect assurance that Jesus Christ once we went through his blood related the angel of the Dead the deaf angel will never touch us amen the Redemption plan once you go through the blood of the Lamb the deaf angels will never touch you because God in the condition he used to be amen amen God be praised that's why we're talking about the Redemption plan that God doesn't change his Redemption plans he gives us the idea upon the principle of the word he said it in the future home of the bride and the bridegroom he preached in 1964. amen August 2 1964. oh my God paragraph 77. and notice how God is showing us clearly The Plan of Redemption it filled my soul with with happiness when I've seen it I was showing to us clearly is redemption plan amen he said now let's compare with what we see with our own eyes amen thank you what God has done to redeem his words form the same plane [Music] what God doesn't change any place he doesn't change anything about it it's a glorious thing God doesn't change his plans it doesn't change his way of doing things is unshakable unchangeable unchanging God amen amen anyone the Redemption plan is exactly the same in everything is using the same method it doesn't change and don't change the way of saying the first man listen to that the man that they've never saved he's saying this see if you have saved us the first man never saved before they are innocent blood You're Gonna Save The Following one hey you say kill yourself he has to do the same thing for everyone that he's gonna save God saved the first man but the blood of a nonsense Islamic and the rest of the people that has to be saved they've got to be saved as a matter by the blood of a Nelson man amen moment he healed a man the true is life Journey either in the day of Jesus or in the days of Apostles the days of prophets no matter when if the same condition are fulfilled he's gonna say do the same thing remember the book of God was the same condition are fulfilled hallelujah amen what is going to happen the same answer gonna be there um one plus one it equals two as long as the same condition and the same answer gonna be the same healing gonna be the same salvation gonna be and if God doesn't change his way of doing things amen it's true it doesn't change a man can change amen can change the age can change these transitions can change but God Remains the Same is perfect what hope should it give to us to the sick people should be given to Christians because this car doesn't change amen it's more important was the same condition I met when the conditioner met hallelujah amen we're walking with the principle of God what you're seeking in order to get to that what this is what God requires and be sure that you are dead to fulfill the same condition and God will never refuse his word he is going to fulfill it again amen we know receiving say the Bible you're praying and not receiving because you don't asking in the right way you don't respect the rules we gotta be sure that the condition of fulfilled that's why people we want to keep this message we can so that we can eat the good food to see the consequences of this message the promises of the end time fulfilling hallelujah amen the reward of a prophet you gotta beyond the prophet amen praise God God be praised don't just get us astray from Malachi foreign [Music] thank you Jesus he ever hit somebody foreign [Music] all the times that's why he said in me there's no favors because my word is there sealed just respect the word of God then you go what you need Amanda amen God God be praised the Redemption plan it started from it started even before the the creation this is taking us back before the creation amen before the Creations God wasn't God amen amen he was Elohim that was existing Church the great rainbow the great pillow fight the great diamond he was there amen amen and he was thinking god with attributes Redeemer A Healer parent El Shaddai amen amen but he was alone being alone how are you gonna who are you gonna hear because there's no sick people hallelujah it's like a child yeah who's born with a gift of football um he's going to kick everything in the house just because the gift is boiling in here using like a microphone singing with a spoon amen that's the gift boiling in him himself but God was born in himself buddy it was a Kingsman Redeemer there wasn't anybody amen then he sits somewhere he said I gotta do something I want to create God this creation should be perfect then he created something you cannot create people that are sick he said oh now I got an idea I got an idea I gotta do something okay place somebody there who's gonna provoke this amen it's gonna provoke a situation so that people can break my laws then the consequence is Gonna Come oh let me prepare the product the antidote how are we going to resolve the problem when the problem comes how are we going to resolve it so he created the plane of redemption amen before you start the creation he prepared the Redemption plane from his foreign that is already slain hallelujah amen is going to finish up with Christ that's William Branham Hallelujah amen the lamb was was slain oh yeah I see it's gonna work well then he start his plane amen oh come on at the beginning God has three projects and he said a free project S three purpose yeah that's what he had God the great diamond the the rainbow colorful that people couldn't see he said I would like to manifest myself so that people can see me through the net [Music] the second purpose it was in his plane and the plane should remain like that everything that is happening that we see it's in the plan of God that's what he said foreign right that is reflecting from Genesis to water to uh to Revelation he said I don't believe if the angel of the Lord comes to me and he tells me something that doesn't correspond to the word of God from the Genesis to Revelation it's not a word because this is the plan of God everything should be in the pen of God the Bible amen I don't want to skip things amen amen the three purpose of God and secondly God wanted to have preeminism on his feet God was manifesting him instead you want to have a control the the the the Dominion on his son amen amen his bride you want to have dominion in this church God is coming to manifest himself in his church in his bride amen and the third purpose is to take back his wife to bring her back in the Garden of Eden amen amen he said that's how it's going to happen that's how things gonna happen a man gonna fall I'll manifest myself through my sons [Music] I'll manifest myself to my bride and after that when God is doing all of this he fulfilled he wanted it yes being the Healer has been exercised is satisfied and he's going back together and no more sickness no more healers no more Kingsman Redeemer everything is done is satisfied amen we are we are crawling of the event everything that is happening we are in the plan of God where's the door where's the window sit down on the floor it's all in the plane the Wolves we just checked the blueprint hallelujah amen it's in your hands of the student today the blueprint of giving God [Music] and brother was saying in the cross the mystery of God foreign 1963. [Music] a paragraph 140. it's very important we shall read it so that we may understand what God had is in mind amen amen anybody understand why the message what I'm waiting from the message once you've got a plan of God the blueprint of God in our heads God had a treat Ables [Music] in his great secret mystery God in this secret mystery he heard before even the world began three purpose to what we wanna reach this morning what is these three purpose of God do you see maintenance I believe with the help of God who's present yeah and he's gonna show it to us if we have these three people we want to discover what is these three peoples of God amen amen paragraph 141. what I'm saying the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to people an invisible God that people couldn't see he wanted to reveal himself so that people may know him amen he could not do that being a great Jehovah God who was covering all the space the Time and Eternity do that it's so great to be revealed in the states because it was going to be so mysterious people couldn't understand it how can this great be that never started after Crossing or the cycle of uh hundreds and hundreds of years three arms and trillions of light and after going through the infinite in The Eternity and is this a great creature that he used to be and it is always but what he wanted to do [Music] he liked to be a fatherhood amen he wanted to be a father God he was a father and the only way you could express that again it was to become a son of man hallelujah amen God the Father becoming the son the son of man that's what that was the way to become a father there is a necessity that's the reason why Jesus was saying the son of man do you see please many among them did you know what he was talking about but now do you get that do you get down the church amen well yeah he wanted to express himself that was a great purpose that he had among those three the six women to express himself to identify himself through the human beings and to reveal himself to reveal true crust hallelujah amen and the second to have preeminence upon his body the body of the Believers which is bright so that he may live in people after being expressed himself through Christ he left Christ comes now in people that I is bright is church and when he's now in his people he has a preeminence he's the one who's walking with you he's the one who's speaking through the beach people he's the one who's acting through his people do we understand something when Jesus Christ in flesh he left the same hallelujah amen what was going after December in his church through the beings this little Messiah to manifest the same God amen Church we don't come to church as we said it about the children we just come here and go back we come and go no we're coming to feed from the food so that when we go out we can Manifest this God the food that makes us grow yes the sound that is maturing in the way that we will go out we may Manifest this God hallelujah amen and in this end time after the scene went through the Ducks and that Dark Ages God has to give a great shocked to give a great shock of Life the seed went through the edges the dark edges it needed the same Jesus to be manifested in this end times borrowing a human body Big Brother Donald Trump in the field who get to maturity and people look at him and say that we've seen Jesus Christ in this 20th century and the same God loves that objects the purpose of God is to be manifested himself through his people we see that God is a living God and when we eat from this food we're going to manifest the same God amen but a problem with the church and that's the danger for the body in the local church we all that is God we only give it to Pastor it's only passed away is God should be to Pastor [Music] the faith that was given to the Saints once for all ah not the faith given to the preacher but the faith that was given to the Saints once for all and upon that basis that will fulfilling everything amen the pastor or the man of God it's just a backup thank you when you fought you feel like there's a resistance then you can call a backup you use a backup because a man of God when God give him a missionary he gives him also a uh foreign first of all you as a Christian amen amen foreign the devil has convinced you cannot do this it's only the pastor yeah you don't even pray it's called your past is the one who can do something he's the one who's consecrating himself that's the devil convincing but when we praying you know the trust the prayer that's the great Secret that's what gives you the confidence to serve it you feel like no I've got God right here and it gives you more you feel like you're gonna pray you feel like God is right here you feel like you're the Son of God and you feel like you are saved and when there's a situation immediately You Gotta Fight For That we all everything we send it to pass now we get to the level of Christians in the body all the preachers every situation they send it back to William Brothers he brought us God and he left the city we now taking the God and send him back to brother come on how are we doing that now it's only Abraham King who can do that he rose the deathly now only him who can do that yes he did to show you you as well that's where you gotta be you're gonna arrest the dead people amen using William Brothers it is experience to work up Amen to wake us up God you've done it with your servant and you can still do it with us in his church hallelujah amen praise God I'll be praised he like the fatherhood don't secondly having preeministration amen amen paragraph 145. you know he said now I died you want to do that in Adam and Eve but the scene separated them and now it should be a way to bring that again and this is so rich for me just to think about it you see what is the purpose of God why did he just kept Adam and Eve the way they used to be in which I kept them that way you shouldn't be able to express what he is but he was also a savior if he kept Adam and Eve he should be a father because he created his children but he could not be a savior perfect because they were perfect creatures Creations without sickness Vegeta and you say how do you know that he was a savior you something [Music] you know that he's a savior just because you have saved you amen he have taken you from the dust of sin that's why we know that he's a savior he's a savior and he has to express that and how could he do it just through Christ how could it be a Healer just through Christ everything is contained in this unique person who's who's crust crust foreign when I think about it amen that they plan the Redemption plan of God everything is happening through that same person that God who came to manifest himself to people through that person and he took preminence in his church through that same person by the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of Christ the physical body on the throne and his Spirit back in the church through that man hallelujah amen oh praise God God is saying this firstly to reveal himself through Christ the fullness of daily 2. to bring this fullness of deity he put it in people who's those people people who is this prize is this church hallelujah amen that's the plan of God amen amen the surveillance and the lead amen amen it's the first lead to express himself completely in Christ in his church which is his body the bride until he have the full premium to express himself through them hallelujah amen God expressed himself through them that's how it is he expressed himself in this end time the same Jesus and when the people have seen it they have seen Jesus Christ the same Jesus for us I want to say hallelujah but it says to stop there it's going to go down in the church hallelujah amen how is it going to be he's got to manifest himself in his church amen amen the Church of the Living God is not just a community oh we gotta go there to me if there's a problem then we're gonna come together no no no hallelujah amen yeah we're coming to church so that the same God he manifested to us so that the same guy May fulfill us with this spirit and we becoming the little Jesus so that we can express Jesus when we speak is Jesus speaking Hallelujah when we look is Jesus looking when we walk is Jesus walking that's why we're coming here so be sure that we begin to be manifested amen amen third time 156. to restore the Fallen Kingdom through the sin the first Kingdom from the first Adam to go back where he used to walk through the freshness at the evening working together with these people in the way he could speak with them and fellowship with them so we going back to where we used to be where we used to die where Adam and Eve has fallen amen amen that's the plane going on to take us back to the person now that the sin is dead and separate them separate them from his presence and his expression before the foundation of the world to expressions that's why I created this sin where we are right when we first we just cry to him and the great God Of Heaven comes out when we are in the scene we cry unto him the Savior comes down then he pay the price he's a king smell Redeemer he goes back and say I'll fulfill my plane I understand yeah amen but now all the fullness of the deity being in the body dwelling in his church the prime ministers it was powered in the church then the believer not the damnation but the Believers of the message of the end times me beloved ones never under underestimate yourself never understimate yourself I remember one day I went to preach down there in South Africa I say in nature when you go somewhere you always have that tendency of giving my chef first oh men of God just sit down first no I'm gonna wait for the second chair not like that in the kingdom of God hallelujah amen it's happening right here imagine you are before the door of heaven

you you're gonna fall down let me go hallelujah amen heaven yet and brother said it's only brothers and sisters in heaven amen amen and you gotta know who you are you see down here God is choosing among these people that is giving gifts to his to everyone and it doesn't make them greater than you believe gift doesn't make them privileged people and you're gonna know where you're standing a man of God he went into our spiritual I don't speak about Daniel Curie [Music] and he found himself in heaven and the angel was presenting two uh two crowds that's what I'm saying the the big crown and the small crown foreign and the angel told him among those crowns take yours and the great evangelists he brought many souls to Christ certainly he was looking at him at the big crown he wanted to take the big question and the angel told him no no that's not your crown that's mine or yours is the small one he was curious to ask so the big one to whom belongs the big one is that the big crown for a member of your church I said what a member of my church me the Great eventually saving all these souls in the world a member of my church having the background he said who's preaches that in my church it's not even a preacher it's not for a preacher in your church yeah it's not even for the Deacon in your church who's that Crown though power is for a woman what hallelujah amen and the mommy is helped over there that big Crown is for a woman in your church she doesn't even know the scriptures explain to me how we come he said you see your ministry it's a fruit of her Ministry of her friends when you're going in the future she's kneeling down in prayer so that we can be successful in your mission and God is listening to her prayers and answering her prayers that's why you are you what you are so you are what you are because of her praise fingers foreign to come today but the Christian doesn't live in sin when it comes he correct the thing and go forward may people say what they want to but you know that you you fix up things with God and you go for it amen that's where the devil is getting us stripping us he want to show us the our past sin look what you've done look what you've done you are disarmed you got no more strength now you start calling Pastor if the past is not there you're calling the legal you're calling the brothers and yourself remember mamas out of

the way we see things the way we come to change the way we do no we don't have to force you to do things amen amen you gotta know why did we receive this message because there's a God who want to manifest himself through you want to express himself through you in his uh three purpose amen amen what is purpose today is to express himself like a son amen and now our fan the fullness of deity dwelling in the body I mean Colossians she is right here before me he was written in the Bible the second that's why the purpose of God is saying through the scriptures then through the life of his sons it says the blood of the Cross oh thank you thank you so that he may reconcile a body a bride which is Eve the second Eve with himself amen amen and God have given that in the form of times when
