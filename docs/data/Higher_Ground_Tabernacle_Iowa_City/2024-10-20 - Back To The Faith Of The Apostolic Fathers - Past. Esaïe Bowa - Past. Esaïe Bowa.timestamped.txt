[1:00:38] identity card of a
[1:00:42] Believer and today we're going to uh
[1:00:46] keep
[1:00:50] talking to talk about the uh the way
[1:00:53] back to the faith of
[1:01:05] in this great subject we're going to
[1:01:07] speak about fighting uh fighting for for
[1:01:11] the faith that was that was transmitted
[1:01:14] once and for all the
[1:01:18] sins as you notice with me
[1:01:26] where we spoke about faith in the
[1:01:27] scriptures we just
[1:01:30] read Paul speaking about common
[1:01:35] faith it says once for
[1:01:42] all there's no two or
[1:01:44] three he only speaking about one
[1:01:48] time it says there's one
[1:01:51] Lord one time
[1:01:56] and one
[1:02:01] baptism I want us to understand this
[1:02:06] morning that according to the there is
[1:02:08] no many
[1:02:09] Faith there's only one
[1:02:14] Faith this faith that Paul
[1:02:18] ising that he wrote to the Ephesians to
[1:02:21] tell them to remind them that there's
[1:02:23] only one Lord one faith
[1:02:27] and one
[1:02:30] baptism and that only faith that Paul is
[1:02:33] speaking
[1:02:35] about it says in verse
[1:02:38] 13 it says until we we we
[1:02:42] reach to the unity of
[1:02:45] faith God made some
[1:02:48] Apostles some
[1:02:50] prophets some
[1:02:52] shepher some uh doctors
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:03:02] for the perfectioning of the works of
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:06] ministry and to the edifying of the body
[1:03:09] of
[1:03:13] Christ and all the until we arrive to
[1:03:16] the unity of the
[1:03:20] faith so the same Fai he
[1:03:23] mentioned and mentioning to
[1:03:28] it says that God made
[1:03:30] some are
[1:03:33] she are dark
[1:03:35] Prophet others are
[1:03:38] evangelists for all of
[1:03:41] us to bring the entire
[1:03:45] church to
[1:03:47] fath and remember I told
[1:03:51] you that Paul says there's only one
[1:03:53] faith
[1:03:56] the faith Paul is talking
[1:03:59] about it's not comparable to
[1:04:03] doctr or a way of understanding some
[1:04:07] scriptures that's not what Paul is
[1:04:09] talking
[1:04:10] about but Paul is talking
[1:04:13] about a common
[1:04:15] Faith that's one
[1:04:19] Faith that's where we can
[1:04:22] fight if we can fight
[1:04:26] it's not about something
[1:04:28] different it's not for these things of
[1:04:30] the
[1:04:31] world it's not about
[1:04:34] doctr the understanding of the
[1:04:38] scriptures but if we have to Le a
[1:04:41] fight if we have to hold a
[1:04:43] fight it's
[1:04:46] for it's for the the faith that was
[1:04:49] delivered once for all all the and it's
[1:04:53] about that faith that Paul told
[1:04:57] Titus Titus my son he
[1:05:02] said in our common
[1:05:05] Faith May the grace and peace God be
[1:05:10] given unto you
[1:05:12] AB from our
[1:05:16] God from Jesus Christ Our
[1:05:18] Savior yes my brothers and
[1:05:21] sisters so this faith is very important
[1:05:26] and that's why we
[1:05:29] found that many of us don't use that
[1:05:34] Faith many has forgotten to talk about
[1:05:37] that
[1:05:39] fa talking about that faith that was
[1:05:42] delivered once for all the
[1:05:44] sins and that's
[1:05:47] why there's all kind different
[1:05:51] fight we have uh uh useless fight
[1:05:57] why
[1:05:58] because because
[1:06:00] preachers they didn't
[1:06:03] insist of the only
[1:06:05] Faith the common
[1:06:07] faith that
[1:06:11] faith that doesn't have to be
[1:06:14] disputed because the common fath that
[1:06:17] faith that Paul
[1:06:24] ising when he makes
[1:06:28] them actions cannot be
[1:06:30] undis because when faith is
[1:06:34] on made
[1:06:36] action action you cannot argue with
[1:06:39] them and many
[1:06:41] preachers many
[1:06:44] believers they have forsaken the common
[1:06:48] Faith just to establish themselves in
[1:06:52] the things that useless to develop
[1:06:57] doctrines that's not even important and
[1:07:00] we fighting we arguing about and we
[1:07:03] stting
[1:07:04] arguing this is not my faith I don't
[1:07:07] believe such you believe
[1:07:10] such don't believe in this
[1:07:14] way it's not about that faith that we
[1:07:17] talking about but the common
[1:07:20] faith that faith that was that once
[1:07:23] belong to
[1:07:25] that that faith that belongs to
[1:07:27] Peter it was the same faith that belongs
[1:07:31] to
[1:07:33] Titus and it's about the same F that
[1:07:36] Paul spoke to the
[1:07:38] Ephesian and many has forgotten
[1:07:43] it now hear
[1:07:46] this as I say we talking about the
[1:07:48] coming
[1:07:49] back to the fa to the Faith of Our
[1:07:52] apostol the prophet says
[1:07:56] in the
[1:07:59] message to the the message of faith of
[1:08:02] the
[1:08:03] Apostles in paragraph
[1:08:06] 12 preached in

[1:10:46] testimony seven times we my friends sir
[1:10:49] yes brothers and
[1:10:51] sister as you can hear what the prophet
[1:10:53] says
[1:10:55] say that Apostolic
[1:10:57] Faith is being
[1:11:00] ready to seal your testimony with
[1:11:05] blood and to believe the true story of
[1:11:07] Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ that's the true Apostolic
[1:11:11] Faith and I want to read
[1:11:16] here says in the
[1:11:18] message
[1:11:21] demonology paragraph 21st
[1:11:26] he says I still have two meeting to hold
[1:11:30] host one in
[1:11:35] Florida and today I've just heard that
[1:11:37] we're going to
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:42] Africa it says there are meeting that's
[1:11:45] being
[1:11:47] organized and then when I'll get there
[1:11:50] and come back here
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:55] I think you're going to see a different
[1:11:57] Ser
[1:11:58] service because you know brothers and
[1:12:02] sisters each time We Gather here in the
[1:12:05] church each meeting we have to
[1:12:09] have has to be a different
[1:12:12] service if it's not a different
[1:12:14] meeting it means God has ceased to be
[1:12:18] God cuz it's true that God
[1:12:21] is he reveals himself to his people
[1:12:26] differ than he has done it before and
[1:12:29] the prophet say he says you
[1:12:33] see and I think that the thing
[1:12:36] is I want to take a group of
[1:12:40] preachers and GA
[1:12:42] them the thing is
[1:12:48] about if you have to understand that the
[1:12:51] preachers are evolving with the spirit
[1:12:53] of God
[1:12:56] he
[1:12:58] says then you have got something you
[1:13:04] see they shall bring it to the
[1:13:08] church and the church will bring it here
[1:13:11] and there and from here from there and
[1:13:14] somewhere El maybe you didn't
[1:13:16] understand let me explain this to you
[1:13:20] brother
[1:13:21] say says when I will come back here from
[1:13:26] I will take a group of preachers and I
[1:13:28] will gather them and he
[1:13:31] say he says the thing it
[1:13:34] is if you can
[1:13:39] get that the preacher are evolving with
[1:13:42] the spirit of
[1:13:44] God if you can
[1:13:46] make to make
[1:13:49] preachers involve with the spirit of God
[1:13:55] that that that then you have got
[1:13:59] something then something is going to
[1:14:03] Evol something is going to
[1:14:05] evolve if the
[1:14:08] preacher can evolve in the spirit of
[1:14:11] God then something will move forward you
[1:14:16] see see when something else and from
[1:14:19] there to another
[1:14:21] place not a new organization
[1:14:27] but a Revival of what we
[1:14:30] have going back to the kingdom of
[1:14:34] God coming back to the apostolic
[1:14:38] faith if we
[1:14:41] have we get to the level of gathering
[1:14:44] the
[1:14:45] preachers and if they can evolve with
[1:14:48] the spirit of
[1:14:49] God certainly something will move
[1:14:53] forward and that's what we seek
[1:14:56] if we are
[1:14:57] preachers we have to gather
[1:15:00] ourselves and when we
[1:15:03] Gathering it's for us to bring
[1:15:05] Revival that's the purpose and the
[1:15:07] mission of the
[1:15:09] preachers bringing forth rival and when
[1:15:12] he brings the Revival the member of the
[1:15:16] church that we bring that same
[1:15:19] Revival that we bring it
[1:15:21] outside that we bring it somewhere
[1:15:25] until that M Revival we go all around he
[1:15:29] says it's a
[1:15:30] Revival that we
[1:15:34] have coming back to the
[1:15:37] kingdom coming back to the apostolic
[1:15:41] faith he says may Lord bless you my
[1:15:47] friend I know I I believe that we about
[1:15:50] to do
[1:15:52] something and now my brothers and S
[1:15:57] since we speaking about the coming back
[1:15:58] of the spirit of the
[1:16:01] fathers the faith of the Fathers as I
[1:16:05] told that faith of the father is not a
[1:16:08] doctrine of the
[1:16:09] church these are
[1:16:13] do that has nothing to do with our
[1:16:16] Salvation brother Bram
[1:16:18] says that not not even one do will get
[1:16:22] to
[1:16:23] heaven the only anything that we get to
[1:16:26] heaven it's perfect love and perfect
[1:16:30] love is the Holy
[1:16:33] Ghost you cannot talk
[1:16:36] about if you don't have the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost because it's the Holy
[1:16:41] Ghost In which Malachi 4 has come to
[1:16:45] bring us back to that's why he
[1:16:48] said he says be
[1:16:51] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:16:53] prophet
[1:16:55] before that great day of the
[1:16:58] Lord I'm trying to go slower for my
[1:17:02] interpret I feel like I'm ring
[1:17:08] him now hear
[1:17:10] this the faith of the father that we
[1:17:13] talking about
[1:17:15] here it's not a Doctrine from a
[1:17:18] church we
[1:17:20] mention and I told you that the other
[1:17:23] day it's not a doctrinal
[1:17:28] church I just left those argument
[1:17:32] useless argument from
[1:17:34] doctr I can believe what I
[1:17:37] believe it doesn't concern the
[1:17:40] church I cannot force somebody else to
[1:17:43] believe what I
[1:17:45] believe the faith that I'm talking about
[1:17:47] this morning I I aming to I'm obligating
[1:17:52] you to have that faith
[1:17:56] because it's not my it's not my
[1:18:00] faith but it was the faith that
[1:18:03] was not many times but one time only to
[1:18:08] the
[1:18:09] Saints and Jude
[1:18:11] say let's fight for
[1:18:15] it if we have to have a
[1:18:19] fight or a brother and a brother
[1:18:22] fighting each other
[1:18:25] let it be for the
[1:18:31] faith if there's a fight battle let it
[1:18:35] be a legi battles for about faith I'm
[1:18:40] saying what is Faith say did you receive
[1:18:45] faith that was delivered to the sense
[1:18:48] once for
[1:18:53] all that's that's what we mean when if
[1:18:56] we have to have a
[1:18:58] b that's why personally I left those
[1:19:02] useless and fighting with people
[1:19:06] uselessly I got out of those you you
[1:19:09] look for me in your fights you will
[1:19:10] never find
[1:19:13] me it's a legitim
[1:19:16] battle for the faith that was delivered
[1:19:19] once for all for
[1:19:20] the that's where I
[1:19:23] fight that's where my
[1:19:26] fa that's where my my my my true battle
[1:19:32] is so I'll
[1:19:34] fight no you
[1:19:39] see why doesn't he preach us why doesn't
[1:19:42] he preach the Catholic
[1:19:48] Church they would say we certainly are
[1:19:50] the mother
[1:19:52] church because of their faith
[1:20:02] and they would say that our church is
[1:20:03] the church that has the faith that was
[1:20:05] delivering to
[1:20:06] the and he say if I go to a Baptist
[1:20:10] Church the church in which I was
[1:20:13] ordained that will say the
[1:20:15] fundamentalist doct we are the one who
[1:20:18] got the the apostolic
[1:20:21] faith and if I can go to the Methodist
[1:20:24] Church
[1:20:25] the Church of my
[1:20:26] mother and they would
[1:20:28] say
[1:20:32] chur we the one who got the the the
[1:20:35] faith that was uh delivered to the
[1:20:38] same and if I keep going to different
[1:20:41] churches each one of them say that it
[1:20:44] was about a
[1:20:47] church all those
[1:20:51] churches they are defending their
[1:20:53] Doctrine
[1:20:56] and they comparing their Doctrine to the
[1:21:01] faith in the church called
[1:21:04] message people fighting
[1:21:08] battles to defend their
[1:21:11] doctr and say that that's
[1:21:14] Faith while it's not even
[1:21:16] faith those are
[1:21:19] do that can that's useless
[1:21:24] shall never send you to heav that's what
[1:21:27] the prophet said he says I'll
[1:21:30] prefer having a bad wrong but having
[1:21:35] God's love and go to
[1:21:38] heaven then having a true Doctrine and
[1:21:41] being lost and go to
[1:21:45] hell why Doctrine is important
[1:21:49] for say now
[1:21:56] sorry oh Jude told us to fight for the
[1:22:00] faith to fight for the
[1:22:03] faith it says not one
[1:22:06] Faith but a
[1:22:12] faith because he was delivered to the
[1:22:14] Saints once for
[1:22:18] all it says there's something reasonable
[1:22:20] to do
[1:22:22] it there's only one way of of doing
[1:22:26] it is to go back to the
[1:22:30] past and see what kind of Faith they
[1:22:33] have our Apostolic
[1:22:36] fathers what kind of Faith do they
[1:22:40] have and when we would find out what
[1:22:42] kind of Faith they
[1:22:44] had then we will fight for
[1:22:49] it now John now as as a Baptist
[1:22:55] I will live
[1:22:56] mine my
[1:22:58] faith he says me as a
[1:23:01] Baptist he says I will leave my

[1:25:01] of I don't want to be
[1:25:07] long because they have that
[1:25:10] Faith the
[1:25:14] apostolic we saw the Miracles that went
[1:25:17] along
[1:25:20] with could say Paul standing at the door
[1:25:23] called
[1:25:25] with
[1:25:27] Angel and there
[1:25:31] was they
[1:25:33] were have nothing
[1:25:36] from the only thing they had was
[1:25:41] faith that faith that was delivered to
[1:25:43] the that's why they told him what we got
[1:25:47] to in Jesus Christ and we telling
[1:25:51] you get up and walk
[1:25:54] and the handicap man
[1:25:57] worked that was the faith of the
[1:25:59] apost the Faith of Our
[1:26:03] Apostolic but today the church has
[1:26:05] lost the church has lost that
[1:26:09] power and they
[1:26:11] are happy to say that we have the word
[1:26:14] you see we have the
[1:26:16] word but the word without
[1:26:19] power it's just a spirit of lust
[1:26:24] I don't want that word
[1:26:28] without now let's ask
[1:26:40] our the Bible says God himself say I
[1:26:44] will send you Elijah the
[1:26:48] prophet before that day AR he shall
[1:26:52] bring back to the
[1:26:55] fathers but
[1:26:57] today we claiming that we have received
[1:27:00] Elijah by our heart has G back to to the
[1:27:05] apostolic father
[1:27:07] why why did our heart didn't go
[1:27:11] back why are we still in
[1:27:13] sin but we claim we encouraging us see
[1:27:18] we have belied in the message I have
[1:27:20] beli in the message I'm in the message
[1:27:23] since 20 years ago
[1:27:24] I mean a message 30
[1:27:27] years no matter how long
