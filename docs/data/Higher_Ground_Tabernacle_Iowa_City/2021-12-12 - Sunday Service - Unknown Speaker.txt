i feeling about those uh about the information she had just across the tandem two seconds and i told him that i'm a christian i believe in the message of the end time and she's also a christian everything that you've said we don't believe in that they say that they're gonna go they're gonna call other doctors because it was so serious and the doctor asked me if i knew about the situation in which the girl the woman was the way they said i told them that everything that you've said to her that she's going to die we're not going to do this operation so back in back home we don't say things like that to a person so we don't believe in everything that you said no and they say that she should be bleeding a lot because there's two operations that are going to do the second one it will be more difficult and ask them what danger do you see in that operation because when i look at her she's in good shape so how can you say that when we do the operation she's going to die zandi okay in first then they told me to sign to accept that they have told me that she's going to die when we do the operation like this then i say this is the second test that they're giving to me the first one was rapid and this is the second one to sign for something like this then i say i'm going to sign life and not death then they gave me many appointments on the same day they say we're gonna finish up with all those appointments because once you come back we're gonna go to this uh to the next step part to all those appointments after signing i asked them how do you feel about this they said no it's fine you can just sign so it's okay after all the appointment are done we went back to the to the doctor who's supposed to do the surgery then when we went back to the doctor supposed to do the surgery he he acted like he didn't know that he should do the surgery on that day he said no i'm not aware of that i'm not going to do anything if they're supposed to do the surgery there should be another doctor not me i can see that she's good shape she can continue like that then they say we have arranged everything for the surgery the doctor said no i'm not going to do it if if it's today i'm not going to do it she must come back on the 3rd we went back on the 3rd of december and they say you're not going to go back home she's going to stay at hospital [Music] then they say the the doctor misunderstood the program the surgery going to take place on tuesday prepared did i say we're not going to stay at the hospital because she's got children i have children too so who's going to take care of them we have to go back and arrange things then we're going to come back on tuesday then they start talking among themselves then they ask the woman how do you feel about this is it okay the woman said no it's not okay to be uh to pass through surgery today i told her that if you're supposed to believe if it's time to believe is this time you have to believe in jesus christ they've already told you that you're gonna die when they do the surgery and you rejected that that's fine so just take my faith then believe that you're not gonna die and you're not gonna die then when went back home i started praying then i remind to god that william branham said all the sicknesses are the demons but if we believe all those demons gonna be blood sugar is very high when we get there they say the blood sugar is high so much elendi then they start poking on their fingers from saturday up until sun monday and on tuesday it was around 7 00 p.m doctor maddie oh you are here already then when they see me they are they they say are you already here and on that monday we prayed all night with the woman and i was praying that god may assist the woman during the surgery in his own way then when we're praying i've seen like aeroplanes like helicopters like soldiers helicopters with those soldiers uniform and they were all around then i opened my eyes as we were praying so i wanted to see if she was praying or she was sleeping then i realized that we were still in the hospital the time we were praying and i understood that it was god was fighting for us then on tuesday morning they called us they gave us the garment for the surgery room then they say we can be ready for then in the surgery room they asked me if i had something to say i said no we can just go forward when i finished praying then the woman holding my garment and say i believe in your faith i i'll take your faith and i believe god want to do something then i say my faith never fails if i believe in malkaifo you will see it hey guys and when they finish the surgery she asked me if i could see when they started they started surgery they asked me if i could see how they are doing it i said yes i want to see my sofa i've seen everything how they open and take everything out it wasn't easy then they told me to go or at his head and hold his hand until the it was darkness inside yeah the dark the lights were deemed but i could see that there was the light around it's on for 2 seconds we thanks god all the doctor who's supposed to do this he was not here we are a new team we don't know how we make it but the woman is good and the baby is good hey i pray the doctor they gave me the baby and they say you should show the baby to when she saw the baby she started crying and saying i'm not gonna forsake you i'll be with you i said no don't don't say you're gonna be with me don't just for uh forsake the lord be with your lord believe in your lord continue so as they were doing everything they were doing there was another doctor who said a nigerian doctor he said i've got something to say [Music] uh administrated enough anesthesia on the woman because when we were doing the operation she could feel the pain and she was saying i can feel the pain i can feel the pain but is dear god who assisted us [Music] thank you so much for praying for the sick people because while we're praying we don't know where the prayers goes may god bless you sister now we're gonna listen to the word of god why are we singing jesus the light of the world brother troy can come forward [Music] so [Music] oh yes oh oh way so well oh oh [Music] oh oh [Music] group of people together here in iowa city group the iowa city hello [Music] christmas my family will be moving up to michigan [Music] new zealand we've taken a job up there in northern michigan and uh coming this end of the year here we'll be transferring up there as a local church up there we'll be attending [Music] so but it's not that far away you see and i know that we'll be returning back this direction and let's expect that we'll still be coming by this place every once in a while so i just want to say god bless you and uh let's go ahead and stand in honor and this morning i want to read from 2nd peter chapter 3. we're going to read the ninth verse through the 14th verse now this morning i want to speak a message called being eternally minded um so let's read here second peter chapter three we'll start with the ninth verse and it says the lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but as the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with further heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up forecast now we'll stop here with verse 11 it says seeing then all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness entertained we just come into your presence this morning knowing that you are the almighty all-powerful eternal god we didn't come here this morning out of tradition [Music] or by the commandment of man the lord we came here out of a desire to be in your presence knowing that many will be lukewarm in this age but lord you have called us to rise above that messenger you overcome those things [Music] and all things will be found faithful to you okay let it be known and let it be done unto us according to thy word in the name of jesus christ we pray this year to have our minds on eternal things that this world has fallen from the glory that god designed those things have fallen away and out of reach from this world but as a prophet in our day is come by our way and he began to open our minds to the things of eternity brother adam he said that see the things of eternity dip down into time it started way back in eden when the things of eternity came down into time a way of the crimson blood [Music] and it wrapped itself up into the day of jesus christ where jesus christ was the eternity of god coming down into time when he opened his mouth to speak impossible things took every time and everything jesus does is supernatural because jesus is the ones that created the natural laws of the universe everything that he does is supernatural and you when you catch that revelation allah that is not the time that you that you are a part of god from back before the foundations he began to talk about what perfect faith was and he said he said see the greatest part of our faith is just mental faith see that sounds pretty good to our minds but when you begin to give yourself over to the word of god that the supernatural presence of the lord jesus christ comes on the scene the power of the holy ghost begins to come into the room and as you have been storing up this mental faith in your mind and as you have the word of god in your in your natural memory that the spirit of god begins to move across those things in your memory and that faith begins to sink down into your heart a supernatural faith a perfect faith and your mental faith begins to give birth well i won't say gives birth but that perfect faith begins to get revealed on the inside of you it's because you were born from eternity that supernatural faith is your inheritance it's it's laying buried there it's buried in as paul said in an earthen vessel [Music] and then the eternal faith begins to become revealed in your life now you who in your flesh were just animal beings god took the body of an animal the highest order of the animals and he placed his own spirit inside of there his own nature inside of there it's a proponent of a an ability to to reject the animal side of our being and to look up higher and to accept our positions he came to this earth and was given and receive the way of his father amen he was not born of the earth he said i was born of the heavens and every being on this earth but the seed of god that dwells on the inside because one of these days in a moment in a twinkling of an eye this is you on england that this fleshly body will give away second [Music] and has become eternally minded brother branham said the spiritual revelation is of more importance than you can importance of spiritual revelations upon this rock i'll and he began to reject everything to his mental conception and gave himself over to what his eternal mind but jesus had come from the father i was going back to the father and so peter looked at jesus it says thou art the christ [Music] the son of the [Music] to me but the father has been speaking to you who are the son of man it when we like jesus christ when we begin to shake ourselves away from the foolishness of this world simone and all the the distractions of this totally distraction and lay them off to the side let's say i am going to focus on my lord you remember the time when jesus went to marry martha's house and he was going over there for lunch and mary martha they wanted him to have a good lunch mariam martha was worried [Music] she was worried that things weren't prepared like they ought to be for jesus to come and have dinner with him and when jesus came knocking on the door [Music] mary went and answered the door martha stayed busy in the kitchen and as jesus sat down in the living room mary begin to sit down there with him begin to ask him questions is but spiritual revelation began to take place in the room and they began to have a divine fellowship between christ and his bride because she was a part of the bride of christ and martha was busy there in the kitchen and she was worried that they had more to do and the dinner wouldn't be done on time she finally came into the living room and she began to interrupt that divine fellowship and matt she said master don't you care we have all this work to do and mary is not helping out okay and jesus looked over at martha yes mary has chosen the best things and this moment will not be taken away from her this this moment of divine fellowship will not be stolen she had chosen the best things you know we all have those times in our lives where we have to make that choice think about a church service or service we some can sit here in peace at their pew oh and even here in a church service you see ma'am down the service so i used to attend to preach in the gospel but despite the various duties that we all have in the church of god malgrey two seconds come to our father to to let our spiritual lives go down towards the animal side the lesser knowledge animal and to not be eternally minded but there has to be a dedication in our minds that will not allow those distractions i believe it took place there in uh shreveport japan shreveport and as he is preaching he began to talk about a vision you can tell bandai because he's just preaching and all suddenly says those and when he begins to say something like i can see hey you have to know that he's not just speaking but he began to break into eternity the word of god being our absolutely and he is our typos [Music] and nothing can take us away from i can see eternity break and come down into time ever since eden he says and when it did it there came a line [Music] but they were just being obedient to what moses said from calvary up to jesus upon the cross jesus that that bloodline was tied to jesus christ or let me say a little bit better that jesus christ was the typos the bloodline was tied to uh as jesus was resurrected was walking around the thai post rose up into the heavens television and the old testament saints went up in the old testament i hope [Music] and someday when he comes to claim his own angel everyone that's tied to that ultimate they have been in eternity all the time so we're not animals after all i don't need some parties anymore anyway we ought to be eternally minded let our mind get away from these walls and the things that around us the responsibilities of this life he said they were predestinated and he says and when that big rope will be dropped right up into eternity again we have an opportunity opportunity to right now be seated with him in his throne but when you reject the things of this world and be transformed a perfect revelation of the lord jesus christ that's who brother bran and what that's who we are to be here yes our responsibilities on this earth that distract us from the responsibility to sit at the feet of jesus christ he preached a message called a man running from the presence of the lord from appreciate a message he was speaking about jonah jonas let's turn over to the book of jonah um i can see brother bran i'm coming up with the revelation for this message and he went down to joppa to find a ship going to tarshish and it says and he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with him into tarshish from the he began to give the drama of it about how jonah was commissioned by god to go down to the gentiles he wasn't being eternally minded you know i think every one of us has been in those situations where the word of god says this but we have going to go and do that direction and as the bi or the book of joy there says in multiple places and he went and he paid the price to go into this ship as the ship went out into the sea uh god caused a storm to come by that way as the waves begin to get worse and worse the waves and then go i was had an opportunity to go on a sales ship in lake michigan a while ago jail opportunities it's one of those old-fashioned ships with all the sails on it about 10 different sails looked like what they would call a pirate ship [Music] and when we got out where you couldn't see land anymore the waves were bigger than our boat and i didn't think they could have waves that big on lake michigan and our boat just seemed like that boat would be going up for several seconds and then when it got to the top of the wave it started going down and it was a little discomforting and comfortable and we were like that for quite a while i can't imagine what jonah was and everybody was feeling in this boat they began to realize that that there there was probably no hope for them they got to the point they did everything they knew how to do it and [Music] everyone cry out to the god that maybe one of these gods [Music] that you serve [Music] did because someone on this boat has done something wrong so i said let's cast slots and find out who that is as they begin to cast the lots the lot fell to jonah and i am running away from his presence and they said until why would you do this you have risked all of our lives and they threw him into the sea and then they began to pray unto jehovah uh jehovah forgive us we don't know what else to do jonah had been running throw me into those stormy waters bound up hand and foot only the will of god can save him son of god and as a predestinated son of god thank you fish did you predict no matter how hard you try to get out of the will of god he said jonah paid the price to get into that ship jonah paid the fare to go in his own will just throw yourself back into the will of god you've you need to stop you are so busy and worried about so many earthly things but your sister mary has chosen the best things you're always focusing on natural things instead of supernatural spirituality after a while church becomes a big boring to you when church becomes becoming tiring too if you don't want to read your bible or pray anymore you're a lukewarm and you need a revival definitely from my tears [Music] there's other scriptures that said there will be some that is on fire for god that they be overcomers in the laodicean age those are the scriptures we came and that's where you belong and he's already paid for the price hey man in closing let's turn over to isaiah 26. lisander is isaiah 26 verse 3. verse 1 it says in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah saying we have a strong city salvation will god a point for walls and bulwarks salute the gates that the righteous city which keepeth the truth may enter in just a fidel that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth the need for do you know who your provider is we got to be one or the other whatever land does it do but i there's something inside of me that rises up it says i didn't come here to be a lukewarm christian supervision but every single thing that brother branham prophesied for the bride of christ i have come to fulfill that practice a complete prophecy amen amen it's our inheritance it belongs to us amen and he'll keep you in perfect peace when you keep your mind on him it's when you break into eternity you can have things wrong in your life for a long time and not even know it it is a memphis [Music] that realization comes when you're in his presence if you haven't prayed for a long and all of a time you go and pray on your knees for an hour [Music] you begin to ponder on your life [Music] oh [Music] yeah those things were wrong all along hello [Music] [Music] [Music] for that [Music] [Music] keeping you away [Music] is [Music] [Music] because that's how we get back to him [Music] if we prayed more often pray daily like we ought to come to the devil then you wouldn't have those things that are wrong stacking [Music] but those things will be taken care of constantly [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] bow our heads and word of prayer lord you said that that day would come as a thief in the night [Music] he said that the heavens being on fire that all these natural things will be dissolved [Music] broken up [Music] as peter was writing those words in second peter [Music] it was prophesying on a day when all these things will break [Music] but those lukewarm church members [Music] they have never focused on eternity will see their life tore apart [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everyone that's holding on to that bloodline will be pulled up in a rapture lord let it be unto us according to thy word we're waiting for [Music] [Music] amen amen amen amen god bless you saints [Music] in the presence of the lord jesus christ [Music] foreign [Music] there is love in the presence of the lord there is peace in the presence of the lord there is healing [Music] [Music] [Music] is is lord is oh is is yes is oh is hey hello foreign we oh [Music] but we don't ever want to leave your presence [Music] he was a little discouraged he let them pay the question and all of a sudden you heard a little a real sweet voice coming soon for the never failing presence of the lord jesus christ [Music] lord as the beneficiaries of this message [Music] [Music] as we leave this place [Music] [Music] it might be [Music] those that are on [Music] [Music] that you may always be with us in the name of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Laughter] [Music] we are seeing amazing grace while we going out [Music] [Music] [Music] is was
