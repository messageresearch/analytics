that you turn with us to First Kings we're going to read uh the 19th Chapter from the 9th to the 13th verses of that chapter I'm glad to have my wife and my grandson with me today everybody there first king 19 we'll read from the 19 from the 9th verse 13th verse try to go slow ton and he came thither unto a cave and large there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what Dost thou hear Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of host for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altar slain thy Prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great storm strong wind rent the mountains and break it in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice for and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what do what do thou he El let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we thank you for all that you do I pray this morning that you would bless the service anoint the word anoint the people Hallelujah Lord give us a heart to receive your word in your name Jesus Christ we bind every spirit that stands against this word and against your people Lord in your name Jesus Christ we surrender the service into your hands let that perfect Divine will be done in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated my thought this morning actually came from the message what doest thou here brother 19591 anyhow we know that the Lord is uh doing something and with all of the things that are occurring in the world if we're not careful we be uh distracted uh when God call us to this message he knew that all of the things that are occurring would occur but if you can remember the preview of the Bride her f face were set like a flint she kept her eyes on Jesus or on the cross of Jesus and she was marching to the tune of the word the moment she began to look around the moment she was distracted uh she left and she lost her step hallelujah amen and if you could remember the prophet of God was screaming stay in line get in line stay in line Hallelujah am and then the vision left him I I would like to encourage you to listen to that message it is a it is a powerful message in the depth of this message it is not just talking about Jezebel and Ahab but it is a scene telling us about Elijah it is a scene telling us about Elijah and what he had to go through Hallelujah during this time of crisis you say it was a time of Crisis absolutely it was a time when the storms were raging the squeeze and the pressure was on the church Jezebel had uh sworn that she would kill prophets 400 I believe Hallelujah she has swore to herself that he would kill Elijah and Elijah was in a position where he felt all alone and and he felt deserted but God comforted him and said unto him I have 7,000 that have not bowed their knees to bail Hallelujah you know history repeats itself but before I go any further I want you to understand what the gospel of Elijah did the gospel of Elijah placed a judgment on Jezebel and plac the judgment on Ahab and God said to Ahab that he would take his life and God said to Jezebel that the dogs would lick your blood Hallelujah so I want you to know this morning that the spirit of Ahab is still alive and the spirit of Jezebel is still alive Ahab was a compromiser Hallelujah he allowed Jezebel to bring Israel into idolatry Hallelujah but we had a voice in the land we had an Elijah in the land and brother Bram said it like this even though Jezebel hated Elijah Hallelujah Elijah was Jezebel's Pastor Hallelujah you see it doesn't matter if the whole world hate this message Hallelujah Elijah is still the pastor Hallelujah and you and I must recognize that Elijah was not a compromiser Hallelujah he had to stand against Israel he had to stand against Ahab he had to stand against Jezebel Hallelujah and it took its all on him hallelujah amen coming from the message hallelujah what doest thou here hallelujah beginning at paragraph 30 brother vom says Elijah had a hard day he had been on Mount Carmel and he had seen the glory of the Lord comeing come down he had prayed for fire of the heavens and then prayed for rain down upon the Earth and and under all of this strain his nerves was about Broken Oh how can I I can feel for him Hallelujah and here we find him first preaching to a backsliding nation of people and to Jezebel that wanted her way and to Jezebel that wanted her way and the people had to come to a place that they had forsaken God forsook all of his promises and all of his Commandments and no longer kept his statue nothing for him Hallelujah and Elijah in the midst of all of it he could not compromise he had to stand true to his conviction hallelujah oh how that reflects in this day let me just pause a moment because we have the message of Elijah and therefore we cannot be compromisers Hallelujah you might not understand it but a little leavens leav the whole lot you can allow sin to come in the camp and before you know it it's going to affect everybody Hallelujah I don't care about friendship I don't care if nobody loves me but one thing I do care about on whether or not he loves me Hallelujah my aim this morning it's not to preach hallelujah amen to make you happy my this morning is a preach hoping that one day you will change Hallelujah see we allow too many things to go unchecked we allow too many things to go unchecked Hallelujah that's not the way of a real believer Hallelujah and the reason why we do it because we don't have the love one for the other Hallelujah that's right because if you love one another you will be a keeper of one another Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying what see you what is it that you see I want you to look into your heart and tell me what do you see what's going on in your life hallelujah amen I want to say something here this morning but I don't want to jump ahead of myself but I will say this what this message came to do to give us a greater experience with God a greater experience with with God than what the Pentecostal era did Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying this message is a deep message but we fail to see how deep it really is hallelujah you can understand understand all Mysteries Hallelujah but the Bible says if you don't have charity if you don't have love your so-called deepness is not deep at all Hallelujah because when you when love of God is in your heart that's what we call Deep why because love of God passes all understanding Hallelujah no intellectual person can teach you how to love the way God wants you to love y'all better hear me and I want you to understand that's what God calls deep hallelujah it's not how elegant I can speak Hallelujah it doesn't matter how good my grandma is but the ability to allow the Holy Ghost to speak through me to you that's what you call Deep hallelujah amen being able to move out of his way so that he can speak to your heart Hallelujah because brother Brooks can't change you you cannot change you the only person that can change you is Jesus Christ himself no man can add a CU to your statute Hallelujah it is the master builder Jesus Christ is the master builder we are the pter he is the pter he is the poter and we are the CL Hallelujah amen see we I keep saying these things cuz the message can you cannot allow you experience Hallelujah to become a what we call it systematic just a habit the way we do things Hallelujah God hates that amen hallelujah amen it's like communion we have communion when we do but communion is a sacred thing if you take communion because you say I'm supposed to take it God hates that it's just a system to you just a law laid out for you but communion is supposed to be approach in Holiness in reverence in respect in Divine love remembering what he did for you yesterday and remembering what he's doing for youday hallelujah amen let me move on in this quote and they had a queen here in the quote 32nd and they had a queen there by the name of Jezebel and she had led all the children of Israel astray with her and fantastic way of living she CA them to commit fornication and to do evil things if that isn't good parallel to to today Hallelujah brother said that parallels today me say like this if there be a fornicator among you and you allow that fornicator to remain that spirit is going to jump on somebody else hallelujah amen and from there it's going to keep going like a wildfire before you know it the church will be corrupt hallelujah amen that's why the church is here hallelujah to separate ourselves from all unbelief I don't care who it is and if you know somebody doing stuff like that and you don't make it known you are as guilty as they are am Hallelujah I didn't come to make you shout this morning but I want you to listen to what I'm trying to say because you say you know brother Bram is a prophet do not guarantee you in the [Music] Rapture hallelujah amen you can quote every scripture you can quote every message book and that do not guarantee you hallelujah amen hey but the Bible says if that same spirit that was in Christ Jesus if it be in your moral body it will Quicken you what are you saying brother Brooks you can have all of these things I'm going to read it and you don't have the Holy Ghost say well brother Brooks people say well brother Brooks you could have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still go to hell I'm not talking about the Holy Ghost on your spirit I'm not talking about the Holy Ghost on your flesh I'm going deeper than that when the Holy Ghost is in your soul there is no way you could be lost hallelujah amen because the holy ghost in your soul is God's approval oh let me hurry up amen hallelujah I'm being taken somewhere else 33rd verse I mean uh uh uh amen but Elijah in the midst of it all yet many of the children of Israel of had done what compromise and wanted to live the Modern Trend of Life hallelujah amen yet Elijah would not compromise you know amazing because even when I preach on things that that you know that Holiness people shouldn't be uh a wearing oh we get this funny response and if you can't say Amen if you can't say Amen to the things I say that brother Bram has said then you are compromis that's it this is not my message it's his message and I'm just repeating what he said hallelujah amen but we think because everybody come listen it's not about having a big church Hallelujah you can have a church full of people and all of them still could be Devils it's not in the number that's not what God looks at hey it's a Catholic Church the Catholic church has more numbers than anybody Hallelujah so that does not make it right this is what makes it right fear not little flock fear not little flock it is a father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen he told Jezebel her place Elijah did now he wouldn't compromise and he told Jezebel her place and how she she must do he said she hated that Prophet but just the same but just the same she wouldn't claim him but he is but he was her pastor [Music] hallelu if I am a God sent man here to preach or Pastor it doesn't matter what you think about me it's what God has already [Music] ordained you know well he ain't deep enough people will say I'm not deep enough but let me say it like this have you changed with all of the Revelation you got far up the latter have you come is that right some of us are still mean evil you don't like me telling but I'm some of us can still hate y'all hear what I'm saying some of us can there's no change you just there because you're in the message I grew up in the message my mama was in the message my dad's in the message my my daddy was a preacher God don't care nothing about that hallelujah amen have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe all your goodness I'm I don't know why I'm preaching like this but I've got to preach it anyway all your goodness mean nothing in the eyes of God why because your righteousness is as filthy rags your righteousness is as filthy racks hallelujah amen let me tell y'all something whether you like me or not it doesn't matter I can tell by your facial expressions you have ISS I don't have no ISS with you I have issues with sin hallelujah amen I had to settle a situation the other day and I told this person I'm not on your side and I'm not on the other person's side I'm on the side of the word y'all hear what I'm saying and what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong to our visiting friends I don't know if anything's going on here I'm just preaching what God told me to preach nobody's called me nobody has gossiped to me nobody has told me anything I'm just preaching what God told me to preach this morning Hallelujah so before you justify your your stories understand this that if I'm saying something that is true if I'm saying something that's bringing conviction this is not brother Brook speaking this is the Lord speaking to you and I hope you will repent and ask God to forgive you hallelujah amen and when I say the other day I don't mean months ago I mean just what I said the other day Hallelujah you love the Lord I don't know I'm trying to get somewhere Hallelujah third 4th paragraph he said oh there's a lot of times they don't want to claim it but a God sent man to a community is a pastor of the entire Community whether he he be baptized Presbyterian or who he is God anoints his man and he will not comp romise that people sometimes hate him because that he stands for the truth but but yet he's God Pastor for the hour Hallelujah 35th verse Oh She despise him she would do anything she could to kill him yet he was true to God's principles and God's standards and what we we know we can't kill the man but we kill the man influence our Tong Hallelujah am yes sir that's what we do some of y'all wouldn't have even allowed Jesus to be your pastor because he didn't come to your church every day he was going he was led go wherever he was led to go y'all that ain't script yes it is Mary and Martha says Lord you should have been here had you been here is that right my my brother would not have died where was Jesus he was about his father's business preaching somewhere else I'm just saying they that are led by the spirit they are the sons of God and I know some of y'all don't like this it anyway yes sir oh she she she despised him she would do anything she could to kill him but yet he was a true he was true to God principles and God standards her modern parties and socials and her paintings of her face and the wearing of her clothes had polluted that Nation had polluted that Nation so when you got Christians who claim to be Christians and they wearing ungodly clothing and they're coming into this church you don't understand it is a pollution if it was then what it is now hallelujah oh Elijah wasn't easy he told her right where she was standing hallelujah oh yeah God send us some more Elijah in this day that will not compromise with sin somebody who will preach the truth no matter how bad it hurts God has still got got servants in every community that won't compromise with the things of the world Hallelujah you know why I'm preaching this the other week when I wasn't here I had to go to that women's retreat anyway I was coming back home I was stuck in in Atlanta atanta Georgia Atlant Georgia I was supposed to get home that morning at 9:30 got home around 11:30 12:00 that night I was very weary I was very tired but the thing that bothered me more than anything else I saw evil on such a scale F but instead of breaking instead of crying instead of feeling a love for those Souls I had allowed myself to get on the hardened side you know we we don't like being hurt we don't like that hurt feeling and sometimes we protect ourselves You by allowing ourselves to get hardened but that's not the way of the is that right the Bible says seal those who sigh and cry because of the Abomination done in the city I want you to listen to this message because brother bam said they're the only ones that will make it and he says how many of you s and cry not just in the city not just in the city but sigh and cry because of the things that goes on in this ass see y act like all santimon and things don't go wrong but I know better and because you think you know the message you have a bad attitude about things it shows the Holy Ghost where you think he is in you because let me tell you something about the word of God and the of Jesus Christ she is am and she she knows the voice of her husband she knows that voice and whether she likes it or not she will always say Amen is that right amen hallelujah when God called that woman a dog it is not neat for me to give you the children's bread you are dog your people are dog Hallelujah and she says even so in other words that was amen even so the dogs desire the crumbs that fall from the table Hallelujah yes sir listen what I'm trying to get you to do with all I've just said I want you to seek within yourself the proof that Christ is in you seek it you got to know that you know that you Hallelujah understand me like I was telling the churches up uh in in De Mo we have different churches with different pastors but when we come together there shall never be a funny feeling if it's a funny feeling you got going on you are a denomination hallelujah amen and that's the truth because you supposed to love not only your Christian Brothers but you supposed to love your enemies that's when you know you got something you can love your enemy go to with me to Second Corinthians Corinthians I pray God don't let this word slip from you even if you criticize it I would be happy does that mean you won't forget it that means God is going to work with you beginning at the second verse at the third verse brother second Corinthians 133 since ye since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me which to you are is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves you hear what I'm saying prove your own selves know ye not your own selves that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobated Hallelujah every individual who claims to be a Christian should know whether he's in there or not hallelujah amen glory to God what do you see are you seeing an individual this trying to be something uhh that's not in the will of God what life runs your life what is it because there is something in you it's either life or death which one is running your life you need to look into that hallelujah amen because you say you believe the m message doesn't mean [Music] anything all followed Moses all followed Moses Millions followed Moses but Millions died you understand me you really don't follow the prophet until you obey what he says and he's not telling you nothing different than what the word commands of us oh hallelujah hallelujah people don't understand somebody was we were we were discussing the other day rapt make the the truth of the matter is the rapture is given to a special class of people it doesn't mean other people aren't Christians they will not there are those that will not be translated this message brother Bram states God gave him the message dress the bride with so if you don't have the message you don't have the proper at TI you understand what I'm saying you know I was telling the brother the oil that was in the lamp brought us to the door is that right but that door had a keeper he had a servant there that would give out the robes y'all better hear what I'm saying and so brother BR was the only man give out the [Music] road so if you don't know about brother Brandon or the message in which he preached you won't know the Rob hallelujah amen the foolish virgin had enough Holy Ghost to bring them to sanctification Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ not only had enough a holy ghost to be filled with it but she had extra oil she knew the door she understood the door and she was able to go in the door why because God gave her a message he gave her instruction he gave her a direction list no Jesus no Jesus no Baptist Jesus no no Methodist Jesus no Pentecostal Jesus listen this Jesus whom we were worship it's a true and living God hallelujah how do you know that brother Brooks he proved himself hallah we serve the Jesus Christ of yesterday the Hallelujah that Jehovah God hallelujah of yesterday is Jesus Christ of the day Hallelujah we serve a God that changes not Hebrews 13 and8 said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever how do you know that brother because God stepped in Malachi fall himself in a world of a prophet and he spoke to us we saw him we understand him Hallelujah it was more than a man it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever hallelujah amen I had somebody say to me the other day somebody whom I love said to me well you know what said how can people not believe brother Brandon was a prophet and when the person said a prophet I thought no the prophet and and and and the person says and I I gota I believe it basically he said but he got a few issues what were you talking about you got a few issues Hallelujah maybe I hope your issue is because he had a Kian accent Hallelujah maybe maybe you didn't like his the way he dressed I hope that's your issue because when it comes to the word hallelujah if you got an issue with the word hallelujah you got an issue with God hallelujah amen one thing you got to know about a prophet he cannot give out his own seed Hallelujah the only SE seed he can give out is a seed of God hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying hallelujah and that's what people don't understand I'm saying what do you see this is more than religion you got to grow in this thing Hallelujah you got to mature in this thing we're not Pentecostal babies we are maturing into the full wi of God and the only way you're going to do that you first must be born again Hallelujah Psalms 119 Psalms 119 Psalm you know I just get I just get so grieved I get grieved burdened when I see my wife would tell you sometimes I can't even I can't even come out of my bedroom because so and I'm so troubled you know I know you can cry too much but I was saying to the Lord what on Earth be done know we cry we pray for Revival and we try to bring correction we to do that the more hardened the people become you understand me you know you try to tell what they shouldn't be doing I found out that I was I've been trying to do the work of the Holy Ghost I can't do it it takes the Holy Ghost to do it the Bible says except the Builder build the house the laborers work in vain if God don't build a house you work in vain hallelujah hallelujah Psalms 119 130 I tell you it's later than what people think it's all over everywhere in the air with all of that you need to be you need to I don't how I don't know how to say it but something in you ought to be driving you down on your knees because you know what is required and you know what you're lacking Hallelujah and Jesus said we have not because we ask Hallelujah is that right brother Bram even preach a message on the token he said out of all the messages he preached that was the one why because without that you make no Rapture he said it takes desperation Hallelujah people are not desperate people are not desperate most people are not desperate we have been choked by the cares of this life let me read on I'm a little bit let me at least get my hour in amen balance it out now come on the interest of the word gives light give it light 30 that word ENT means Revelation so let me read it like that the revelation of Thy word giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple I open my mouth and panted for long for that commandment I'm thirsting I'm hungry I'm thirsting for your Commandments Lord hallelujah look thou upon me and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those unto those that I that love thy name this is what I love right here Order My Steps in thy word and let not my iniquity have dominion over me SC what order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me come on somebody how many of us fight with iniquity you don't have to raise your hand but the truth of the matter is Iniquity is when you know to do good and you do it not and every one of us fight with that glory to God I'm going tell the story that brother brand told it was a little story about a man and his son in the message what see thou he says Hear thou he says paragraph eight what doest thou here I'm sorry I always mix them up but do it without here paragraph eight he said an old story of some years ago in England there was a man and he thought he would go out and have a little friendly drink Christmas time for fellowship and he went out oh let me tell you somebody somebody thinking let me tell y you don't have the Holy Ghost this message is only potential yours the message M was sent to Holy Ghost fill people or those who would receive the Holy Ghost right remember said Judas because he wouldn't go to Pentecost he elected he was chosen he was a preacher he cast out Devils y hear what I'm saying but he still did not have the Holy Ghost say what you want to say that's the word and so many of us we don't even love each other and think you got the Holy Ghost you don't love the listen holding grudges and all kinds of stuff I know y'all think some call me on the phone I'm just saying it the way he wants me to say whoever this is for I hope you receive it nobody has called me I'm reading your letter his him he he's the one is telling me what you've been doing hallelujah amen amen amen let me finish let me go back up cuz he said an old St story of some years ago there was a man and he thought he would go out and have a little friendly drink Christmas time just for fellowship and he went out among his neighbor and he was exchanging presents and everybody would say to him now John just take a drink of this and a little sip here and a little sip there and he got really intoxicated and on his road home there had come a snow about six Ines and his little boy was following him and he couldn't pack he couldn't pack him he was too drunk and he was on his road home and he happened to turn around and noticed this little boy just almost was wallowing in the snow and he said Son why are you wallowing in the snow he said daddy I'm trying to follow your footsteps and he picked the little L lad up in his arms and he said God from this day on I'll never take another drink Hallelujah I'm saying that because somebody's watching your footsteps your children are looking at you you supposed to be the example and just as sure as you carrying a bad spirit that spirit is going to jump on them Hallelujah somebody is going to follow your footsteps let's walk that straight line from the cradle to Calvary that the footsteps let have them to walk in Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah why I'm almost closing I'm closing but we we need to know who we are first Peter 2:9 I'm different from everybody else I'm not trying to be like everybody else sometimes it get a lonely it gets lonely you feel like you're the only one trying but I know what I'm looking at you understand me I know one of these old days should you make it you'll say thank you brother Brooks and you know what I'm going to say thank you Jesus Hallelujah because I can't do nothing other than preach what he wants me to preach Hallelujah first Peter 29 first Peter 2 29 but ye are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people let me tell y'all something people of God the only way God could say this to any people is that they were covered by the blood that's the only way covered elected chosen that that that's the only way Peter could ever say that because he's recognizing the effect of the blood he said that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light now I'm I'm going to skip a lot cuz I want to come on down to this last quot I'm going to let you go because I want you to know this got to be deeper than we've allowed it to be hallelujah amen you love the Lord hallu that's okay I want you to get this talk about brother talking about you know when I'm speaking about Elijah I'm speaking about brother he was Elijah for our day and a lot of people don't understand what he went through the scripture tells us what he went through you being elij Elisha this is for you too you know what I was preaching on the message the other day eternal life and I say eternal life is like an onion that to describe it because you peel a a a a leaf off in onion there's there's another fold behind it and it keeps unfolding it keeps un but Heaven is inexhaustible that these will always unfold you never get bored in heaven hear I'm saying and God will always have something that's going to excite you why because he loved the the expression of Joy did you know that did you know that it was God who created Joy he created that so he loved that expression he love praise he loved Joy is that right presence of the Lord there is fullness of what Joy come in here y'all come in here looking all sad and I'm going tell you like this forgive me if it sound like I'm being racist but when I first met most of the con people I didn't even know they could smile I'm like Lord and you be preaching hard though like they got an attitude right and some people still that way I love you anyway I really do cuz now I know there's some progress here you're smiling like you're happy listen let's move on by the grace of God uh for the message what doest thou here okay paragraph 54 almost done when God get a hold of a man the first thing he does in a church is bring it from worldliness to Holiness did you hear that not my words from worldliness to Hol and he brings it from Death unto life it's born again it's new its ideas are new what we need is a Revival like that today really it's true oh we've had dip of dips of the spirit we've had spiritual blessings and spiritual uprises listen to what he says but we don't need that no more we need a Revival of the spirit of the Living God in the hearts of the people we don't need so much of the dips of the spirit or Spiritual Awakening we need a Revival that Revival what we've got not a spiritual awakening sometimes that causes mixed multitude we need a Revival that'll sift down shake down and will cut out all the things Hallelujah am hey you know when God does it he does it right hallelujah amen but if you quit because of me you go back to it Hallelujah am fifth or sixth verse that's what the church need is Revival to shake it from all of the worldliness and the things of the world and bring back Purity Holiness of God in the heart of his Believers [Music] humility I tell you what there's some of you I wouldn't want to have a fist fight with is the TR yall look no no I shouldn't be doing that forgive me why men to why men to suit himself they don't get a Revival once in a while on their Spirit they become so carnal and so indifferent till they get self styled self-righteous they read and study and that's good but that ain't the thing we're talking about you know more about the word it's good to know the word but it's better to know the author of the word see that's the little something that you leave out there something in the heart that makes you what you are that's thing y'all hear what he saying it's not reading the word the message coming to know the author of the message Hallelujah one more qu I'm let you go 60th verse he said you know people under the junal tree is like they like to sleep he said I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world people is so tired they so mentally strained until they're feeling the insane institions in hospitals everywhere they went in such a nervous condition so they don't know what they do believe and what they want they just laying there they don't know what to do oh it's such a sad sight listen here my brother you can't you can't drink it off you can't shout it off neither can you play CS till dog and you could take a thousand cestas try to sleep it off you can't all of our little remedies only thing it does is help the symptoms we've got to have a cure for the disease Hallelujah is that right we got to have all the psychiatrist in the world canot cure it it only helps the symptoms The Cure is in the blood of Jesus [Music] Christ not take a rest at the seashore not go to an Anthem a chir to sing anthems that's what we're trying to do today sing it off oh we'll make ourselves like Jonas's and we'll try to do something different we'll try to educate it out there's only one way to do it and that's face the facts that's right oh if you're upset and frustrated and don't join Church come to Christ don't join the church come to Christ that's the only remedy don't apply and turn a new page just get a new life Christ is the answer hallelujah amen and I'll say in closing I know I've said a few rough things and but I'm going tell you something it's for it's for your good and and understand everything I've said I've got to give an account before God because I said anything that's outside of love for you going to judge me for that hallelujah amen now people of God I'm all for the great Mysteries with all of that knowing all of that how much change have you made what what did it change you what what see because the prophet God tells us this you can have a mental conception hallelujah amen and when your when your Holy Ghost is just in your mind if I could say it like that you're going to fail you know why because your eyes will determine on how much you have faith in your mind right y'all know that's the truth it's like taking a baby's temperature you just pray for that person and the temperature went up and the and then the devil says Rush the child to the hospital but then you just pray which one you believe and often time we pray for a child yourself because I understand the conflicts there use yourself you're sick and you done prayed for God to heal you but your temperature go up and the first thing you say I'm getting worse that's because your faith is in your head it's not in your heart when it's in your heart it's a revelation God done already showed you you done not you healed he already showed you you delivered hallelujah it's in your heart that's where Abraham called those things that be not but he believe those things that be not with his heart hallelu that's the message and as long as you have this intellectual faith never take you nowhere and it'll get you to a place where you will even question the message whether it be right or not that's where Eve messed up she let the devil talk to her mind and she followed that lust in her mind that lust brought her to death let let me say this one more thing uh before I close you know the Bible says that when lust is conceived y'all ever thought about that I heard somebody say this I heard somebody say this and I have not been able to forget it he said when lust is conceived you are impregnated whatever whatever that is you just lost for you are what you're going to have a right because what happens when is conceived like a child y'all hear I'm saying so you got to understand what devil is doing to you it gives you stuff that's not of the word accept it you have now accepted his seed and no way of getting way of rid of it unless you ask God to take it out but for the most part sin is conceed is already there and you don't forgot you a Christian and Satan don't wake you up until you have produced that child y' know it's true you know it's true because we would never do or even think some of the things we do always remember who we are that's why James says don't look in the mirror of the word walk away and forget you are you love the Lord I want you to look inside yourself and tell tell yourself what you see is the Holy Ghost living in you is God ring your life or are you struggling this is what the Holy Spirit spoke to me the other day many people are performing performing like a Christian but a lamb don't perform to be a lamb lamb is a lamb Hallelujah you don't want to act like a lamb you want to be a you love the Lord let's stand I'll sing out a song I'll sing out a love song to Jes in moment like I

came across my heart I don't want you to think I don't understand I know how difficult it is for you but I know what God can do hallelujah amen God saved me when I was 19 years old 181 1918 I've never had a mind to turn back not my power he kept me hallelujah amen and I'm going tell you right now because you're young you so much more for the kingdom of God then when you get to be my age you understand you know I know sometimes I could be misunderstood one you need to know is that I love you and I care for you I wouldn't preach it the way I preach it if I I know you may not believe that but God is my wit not against flesh and blood spirit in high places you know I can't help you God can't even if you love the demons that possess you if you love certain things of the world the lord
