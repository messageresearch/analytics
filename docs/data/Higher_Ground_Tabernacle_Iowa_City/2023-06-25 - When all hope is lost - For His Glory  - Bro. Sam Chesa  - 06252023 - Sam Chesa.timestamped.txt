[50:28] uh verse 1 says
[50:31] now a certain man was sick named Lazarus
[50:34] of Bethany the town of Mary and her
[50:37] sister mother
[50:41] obvious
[50:49] ly
[50:50] therefore his sister sent unto him
[50:53] saying Lord behold
[50:56] ERS is sick
[50:58] first three
[51:01] verses
[51:08] when Jesus heard that he said this
[51:12] sickness is not unto death
[51:14] but for the glory of God that the Son of
[51:17] God might be glorified by
[51:20] itself
[51:33] amen amen
[51:35] Jesus said this sickness is not unto
[51:38] death
[51:41] but for the glory of God that the Son of
[51:44] God might be glorified by it is
[51:50] you think this sickness that Lazarus has
[51:55] so that God might be glorified
[52:00] when all hope is lost
[52:15] subtitle for his glory
[52:19] amen amen how many have ever come to a
[52:22] point in time in their life
[52:26] how many have ever come to a point in
[52:28] their life
[52:30] and they they don't know what to do and
[52:33] soja Rivera
[52:36] you have just come to the end of your
[52:38] words
[52:40] you do not know how tomorrow is going to
[52:43] be like
[52:45] but you know that you pull through
[52:49] why because God came right in time for
[52:52] you
[52:54] amen amen I know you've had situations
[52:57] in your life
[52:59] where you have cried and cried all you
[53:02] can
[53:05] and you just throw your hands in the air
[53:09] it says I've done all I can
[53:12] I don't know what's going to happen
[53:16] but God just came in right on time for
[53:19] you
[53:21] amen amen how many has ever come to a
[53:24] point in their life
[53:25] a
[53:33] and all your hope is gone
[53:37] it says Lord I've prayed all I can pray
[53:43] I'm just living everything into your
[53:45] hands
[53:47] but you are seated there as a witness
[53:50] this morning
[53:52] and as a testimony that God came right
[53:55] to your needs
[53:59] he came to deliver you continue to
[54:03] probably be discouraged
[54:06] it says I cannot take it anymore
[54:10] the doctor said I'm sick
[54:13] I don't know how I'm getting together
[54:16] but because he is Jehovah
[54:20] he has provided all you need
[54:23] you wanted money
[54:26] you don't know where that money was
[54:28] going to come from
[54:29] but you never got homeless
[54:33] why because God came right on time
[54:37] hallelujah amen because he's the God who
[54:40] comes when all hope is lost
[54:44] and he will come to save you and deliver
[54:47] you
[54:49] know why he does that for us the Bible
[54:53] says it's for his glory
[54:56] so that we can know that he is
[55:00] we read of the woman
[55:02] um of the issue of blood in the Bible
[55:06] the Bible said she had spent everything
[55:09] that she had
[55:12] she had spent all her money
[55:15] her hope was gone
[55:18] was emotionally drained a day uh
[55:22] emotional uh
[55:59] he can do the same thing today
[56:02] all you just have to do when you see him
[56:04] walking by two seconds
[56:11] doesn't matter even all your hope is
[56:13] gone
[56:15] I can guarantee you his word never fails
[56:20] and he always comes through
[56:23] he always comes right
[56:34] he said our brother your friend is sick
[56:37] please
[56:40] come and pray for him
[56:44] they did the right thing his own failure
[56:47] they called Jesus
[56:49] it doesn't matter whatever
[56:51] whatever
[56:53] hold the right person
[56:56] hold Jesus onto your situation
[56:59] because he has been proven over and over
[57:02] again
[57:04] to succeed he has never failed
[57:08] hallelujah amen and what Jesus
[57:15] say this sickness is not unto death
[57:20] but this sickness is for the glory of
[57:23] God
[57:25] so that the Son of God might be
[57:27] glorified by this
[57:31] but we all know that later on Lazarus
[57:34] died
[57:36] so what was he saying
[57:39] this was a prophetic speech
[57:42] and the school poverty that even if
[57:45] Lazarus dies
[57:47] the glory of God was going to be shown
[57:50] he was is going to be glorified like
[57:53] that
[57:56] so you have no idea why you're going
[57:59] through problems in your life
[58:03] you have no idea why you are facing
[58:06] trials and tribulations
[58:09] I have an answer for you this morning
[58:13] you are going through what you are going
[58:15] through so that God can be glorified you
[58:18] have two seconds
[58:20] he wants to show up
[58:34] so brother sister your trial is not
[58:37] going to make you suffer our friends
[58:41] your sickness is not going to make you
[58:43] suffer foreign
[59:18] [Music]
[59:47] hey man so he will come for you
[59:51] also read off another story in the Bible
[59:56] Jesus was walking with his disciples
[1:00:00] and they walked by a man who was blind
[1:00:05] and the disciples asked Jesus and said
[1:00:07] why is this man blind
[1:00:13] is he blind because his parents probably
[1:00:17] sinned or he sinned
[1:00:22] Jesus answered them and said the parents
[1:00:25] did not see a Jesus
[1:00:29] this man did not sin he said
[1:00:33] but he is blind so that the works of God
[1:00:36] might be made manifest in him
[1:00:40] in other words this man was born blind
[1:00:45] so that at the opening of his eyes
[1:00:49] God might be glorified
[1:01:19] says God shall deliver them out of them
[1:01:22] all hey continue
[1:01:26] not some of them but out of them
[1:01:31] so it is your duty to take that word
[1:01:36] and look at yourself
[1:01:39] and say this that I'm dealing with
[1:01:44] considered in that all
[1:01:47] it is part of that all said
[1:01:51] so you call God on the word Allah
[1:01:55] say Lord you promised us that we were
[1:01:58] going I'm going I was going to get
[1:01:59] afflictions
[1:02:03] your word you also promise that you
[1:02:05] deliver me out of them all
[1:02:08] right
[1:02:10] he is bound to deliver you
[1:02:14] because he has done it before past we
[1:02:17] laughing is doing it right now
[1:02:20] and he can still keep on doing it
[1:02:23] Hallelujah
[1:02:27] because the end result
[1:02:29] is for God to get the glory
[1:02:32] [Music]
[1:02:34] doesn't matter even all your hope is
[1:02:38] you have tried for so many years
[1:02:42] I can tell you that God is coming
[1:02:45] through anyway
[1:02:48] Jesus came and healed Lazarus whilst he
[1:02:51] was just sick
[1:02:55] we were going to be talking about a
[1:02:58] healing testimony
[1:03:04] but that would be less glory for him
[1:03:13] but if you wanted to come when the
[1:03:16] things had gone to their worst measures
[1:03:20] so he can get the glory that he's the
[1:03:23] one who raised someone from the dead
[1:03:27] foreign
[1:03:30] you are in something that's not savable
[1:03:34] but I'm here to tell you that the more
[1:03:37] unsavable it looks like
[1:03:40] uh
[1:03:47] a greater problem is a greater testimony
[1:03:55] so God wants to use you Allah he wants
[1:03:59] to use me
[1:04:00] so when people look at you
[1:04:04] how did he get out of there is a problem
[1:04:08] then you can say it was God
[1:04:12] so he can get all the glory
[1:04:16] all rid of Abraham in the Bible
[1:04:21] you see back then in the day they
[1:04:23] worshiped so many gods
[1:04:26] they worship the son God
[1:05:09] the name of God was just amongst other
[1:05:12] gods
[1:05:16] that's why he raised Abraham
[1:05:19] and took him out of the land of the
[1:05:22] Hidden
[1:05:25] and he made Abraham to prosper yeah
[1:05:29] Prosper when he's uh when his nephew lot
[1:05:33] was taken the council
[1:05:36] he went to fight with people from his
[1:05:38] household
[1:05:41] and he won the battles
[1:05:45] God was just not making Abraham do that
[1:05:50] God was establishing his name
[1:05:56] so when people look at Abraham
[1:06:00] they can start saying the god of Abraham
[1:06:05] he was standing out from those other
[1:06:08] Idols
[1:06:10] he was standing out from the Moon God he
[1:06:13] is
[1:06:14] and he started being called the god of
[1:06:18] Abraham
[1:06:20] so the glory was not to Abraham
[1:06:24] but the glory washed
[1:06:28] amen amen so we are Sons and Daughters
[1:06:31] of Abraham blow some defeated hallelujah
[1:06:34] amen God wants to do the same with you
[1:06:36] and me
[1:06:38] he wants to raise you you've ever sees
[1:06:41] it he wants to deliver you out of your
[1:06:43] problems
[1:06:45] he wants to make you prosper you've ever
[1:06:48] Prosperity so that when people look at
[1:06:50] you
[1:06:51] they can say your God
[1:06:54] and that's the identification you get
[1:06:57] hey
[1:07:00] so whenever you get out of any situation
[1:07:04] God loves to receive the glory
[1:07:07] so when he heals you can't you forget
[1:07:10] he's going to say I did that
[1:07:13] when he delivers you out of your
[1:07:15] problems
[1:07:20] because he loves to get the glory
[1:07:24] and he will make you go through what
[1:07:26] you're going through so he can deliver
[1:07:29] and get the glory amen
[1:07:33] Sarah was Barren for 25 years
[1:07:39] foreign
[1:08:33] for about 14 years
[1:08:38] foreign
[1:08:42] he was Barren for 14 years they never
[1:08:44] had any babies
[1:08:47] God came true
[1:08:49] and gave her two sons
[1:08:51] and they started saying the god of
[1:08:54] Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:08:57] that's the name he was known by I said
[1:09:02] and when he came to Moses in the burning
[1:09:06] bushes
[1:09:09] and say whom am I going to say has sent
[1:09:12] to me
[1:09:13] and he says I am the god of Abraham
[1:09:17] I'm the god of Isaac and Abraham Jacob
[1:10:20] foreign
[1:10:40] why can't you do it for me
[1:10:43] we know Hannah in the Bible
[1:11:45] so he can get the glory foreign
[1:12:25] what did the children of Israel says
[1:12:32] and the sword of the Lord
[1:12:35] they were giving back the glory where it
[1:12:38] belongs
[1:12:40] so they could say God did it
[1:12:48] for the children of Israel were around
[1:12:50] Jericho
[1:12:54] they called on the same God of Abraham
[1:12:57] the god of Isaac and Jacob
[1:13:01] he did what he did because
[1:13:07] foreign
[1:14:09] ago he was telling you went to the
[1:14:10] doctors
[1:14:12] the doctors told him that he had cancer
[1:14:16] and he left and went back and he said I
[1:14:19] don't have cancer
[1:14:22] and he prayed about it
[1:14:25] and you went back to the doctors
[1:14:28] and they scanned him they said we don't
[1:14:31] see nothing
[1:14:34] why God did it
[1:14:37] and he said the doctor says I can't see
[1:14:41] this is a miracle
[1:14:44] why did God heal him
[1:14:47] so he can get the glory
[1:14:50] Lord he can say I did that okay
[1:14:54] so he's trying to do the same thing for
[1:14:57] you
[1:15:00] and Jesus loved mother and her sister
[1:15:03] and Lazarus
[1:15:07] is
[1:15:10] when he had therefore the Lazarus was
[1:15:12] sick
[1:15:15] he stayed for two days in the same place
[1:15:18] where he was
[1:15:20] then after that he said to the disciples
[1:15:23] let's go into Judea again
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:27] he was delaying
[1:15:30] they told him Lazarus is about to die
[1:15:35] but the moment that he even went away
[1:15:43] the prophet God here says
[1:15:46] he says look at Mary and mother Mary
[1:15:50] when a brother was dead and she sent for
[1:15:52] Jesus and instead of coming he went away
[1:15:59] she sent again and he went farther
[1:16:02] Massachusetts
[1:16:06] that was building up pressure
[1:16:10] said I asked him today
[1:16:14] and he went further
[1:16:41] they were going to leave
[1:16:43] there for Jesus to come raise
[1:16:47] they still had hope for Lazarus to get
[1:16:50] healed it
[1:16:51] was dead body right there so that Jesus
[1:17:01] but they gave up
[1:17:03] manually
[1:17:06] they went and they buried him
[1:17:09] this is the Hopeless case
[1:17:17] so let's go bury your brother
[1:17:21] now history
[1:17:25] amen amen like our friend he's not
[1:17:28] interested
[1:17:33] let's just have a funeral and move on
[1:17:37] continue but Jesus had spoken a word of
[1:17:40] prophets
[1:17:43] it says that sickness was for God to get
[1:17:46] his glory yes
[1:17:49] amen when Jesus comes nothing stays the
[1:17:53] same Consciousness
[1:17:57] daughter was dead
[1:18:01] he came and turned the funeral into a
[1:18:04] celebration
[1:18:10] and then
[1:18:11] these things he said does Jesus
[1:18:15] Jesus talking to the disciples he says
[1:18:17] our friend Lazarus sleepeth
[1:18:23] but I go that I may awake him out of his
[1:18:27] seat
[1:18:29] then his disciples said Lord if you
[1:18:32] sleep he shall do well
[1:18:37] then as soon as you say that Jesus
[1:18:39] realized that we are on different levels
[1:18:45] they don't understand what I'm saying
[1:18:48] it is like let me explain it to you
[1:18:53] he says
[1:18:55] he then Jesus said to them plainly
[1:19:00] Lazarus is dead he's gone but when Jesus
[1:19:06] was looking at the death of Lazarus
[1:19:09] because
[1:19:12] sleeping
[1:19:14] but when other people were looking at
[1:19:17] Lazarus
[1:19:19] they saw Lazarus dead
[1:19:22] and we see her that there is a
[1:19:24] perspective
[1:19:27] perspective Jesus perspective and these
[1:19:30] people's perspectives
[1:19:35] perspective is how you see things
[1:19:40] and how you see things is determined by
[1:19:43] where you are seated
[1:19:48] if you are seated all the way to my
[1:19:50] right here
[1:19:52] you're seeing my rights
[1:19:55] and if you see that all the way to my
[1:19:58] last year
[1:19:59] you can see my right side you can only
[1:20:01] see my lips perspective
[1:20:06] determined by where you are a lot of
[1:20:08] perspective
[1:20:09] the LA position of the directions that's
[1:20:13] why we need to trust God's perspectives
[1:20:19] because he is seated in a higher seats
[1:20:24] where you see to the corner he sees
[1:20:27] around the corner
[1:20:30] when you see towards the hill he sees
[1:20:32] behind the heels
[1:20:36] that's why you have to trust him
[1:20:39] in his word he says I know the plans
[1:20:42] that I have for you
[1:20:45] plans for you to prosper
[1:20:48] Prosperity don't know that his plan is
[1:20:51] based on his perspective
[1:20:55] so like Paul says we have to elevate
[1:20:58] ourselves
[1:20:59] and he said we are seated in Heavenly
[1:21:02] places when
[1:21:06] you are seated in Heavenly places
[1:21:11] the way God
[1:21:14] issues if the disciples were seated in
[1:21:17] Heavenly places they would know what
[1:21:19] Jesus was talking about
[1:21:23] but they were on different levels
[1:21:27] he said he's sleeping I'm going to wake
[1:21:29] him up
[1:21:32] he was saying he was dead
[1:21:35] so that's why you gotta trust God's
[1:21:38] perspective about you
[1:21:41] and his perspective about you is in the
[1:21:44] Bible
[1:21:51] you gotta look around what does the word
[1:21:53] say about me
[1:21:57] that's what I'm gonna believe
[1:22:00] I don't care what everyone else says
[1:22:06] I don't even care what I say about
[1:22:08] myself
[1:22:11] it doesn't align with the word of God
[1:22:13] see
[1:22:15] what I say about myself he doesn't if he
[1:22:17] doesn't know align with the word of God
[1:22:19] she said
[1:22:23] don't consider that
[1:22:25] what does the word say about you Allah
[1:22:31] take that and personalize it Allah
[1:22:36] the Bible says I'm above and not beneath
[1:22:42] that's the perspective I'm taking
[1:22:44] perspective the Bible says I shall be
[1:22:48] the lender and not the borrower
[1:22:53] that's the perspective I'm taking says
[1:22:57] the word of God says I am a chosen
[1:23:00] generation
[1:23:03] that's the perspective
[1:23:07] hallelujah amen do you take God's
[1:23:10] perspective over yours or
[1:23:16] then Jesus came and he found that they
[1:23:19] laid Lazarus in the death Allah
[1:23:27] as soon as she heard that Jesus was
[1:23:29] coming or she took a mouth
[1:23:32] she ran and she went to meet him
[1:23:37] she did the right thing and I feel like
[1:23:39] bunches although the situation was done
[1:23:42] it was hopeless they said we are done
[1:23:44] with this
[1:23:47] because Jesus was coming
[1:23:50] said I am running to him
[1:23:53] brother sister run to Jesus
[1:23:57] to have tried all you can you ever
[1:24:00] married
[1:24:16] because when Jesus comes nothing stays
[1:24:19] the same
[1:24:22] hallelujah amen very uh Martha ran to
[1:24:26] Jesus
[1:24:28] and she said Lord
[1:24:30] thou has been here
[1:24:35] my brother would not have died
[1:24:40] but you were not here so he died
[1:24:44] and we buried him and he's done with no
[1:24:47] love on theory in a party but she knew
[1:24:49] whom she was talking to me
[1:24:52] she knew what Jesus had done in the past
[1:24:57] she did not end there is
[1:25:00] she says but I know
[1:25:04] even now
[1:25:06] whatsoever you will ask of God two
[1:25:09] seconds
[1:25:10] God will give it to you
[1:25:13] amen amen although My Hope Is Lost
[1:25:18] I know that if you speak the words
[1:25:21] things will happen
[1:25:24] and Jesus said to Mother
[1:25:26] your brother shall rise again
[1:25:31] despite it having been four days passed
[1:25:34] by
[1:25:36] the new foreign
[1:26:28] when the weakest of Christians kneel
[1:26:31] down to pray
[1:26:37] I'll read that again I'll read it
[1:26:45] it's also written
[1:26:48] and he took the father's word and
[1:26:50] defeated Satan right on his ground
[1:26:56] what did he do he was proving to the
[1:27:00] weakest of Christians that you can
[1:27:01] defeat Satan anywhere anytime on the
[1:27:04] plain word of God
[1:27:10] just take it and say that says the Lord
[1:27:12] it is written here
[1:27:17] is
[1:27:24] the weakest of Christians kneels down to
[1:27:27] pray
[1:27:32] they can shake oh hell
[1:27:37] if you think you are not strong and you
[1:27:39] feel like my Christian Life is weak uh
[1:27:42] foreign
[1:28:19] oh there's a squad and Jesus said unto
[1:28:22] her
[1:28:23] I am the resurrection resurrection and
[1:28:27] the life
[1:28:28] he that believeth in me
[1:28:31] though he were dead yet
[1:28:35] so Jesus was telling math that right now
[1:28:39] is you are looking at me
[1:28:43] I am the resurrection
[1:28:46] I am the life
[1:28:48] so he was Resurrection walking on two
[1:28:51] followers
[1:28:55] Resurrection was coming on two feet
[1:28:59] and they believed in him and he says
[1:29:03] though you were dead
[1:29:05] you shall live
[1:29:07] and he said where have you laid him
[1:29:10] he said unto him Lord come and see
[1:29:14] they took Jesus to the Grave where they
[1:29:17] laid Lazarus
[1:29:37] that's what your faith is foreign
[1:29:46] use that use that Faith to Broad and
[1:29:49] belief away
[1:29:52] when you call Jesus on the scene
[1:29:56] because it's not going to help you if
[1:29:58] you call him and you're not believing
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:02] so he told them you rolled that stone
[1:30:05] away
[1:30:07] amen you roll that impatience away
[1:30:11] and only believe all things are possible
[1:30:17] believing is an environment
[1:30:21] believing is an environment
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:45] that egg
[1:30:47] has the potential to be a chicken
[1:30:51] the egg has a potential to be a chicken
[1:30:53] left out to the potentiality
[1:30:58] there is no environment the heat that
[1:31:02] the hand puts on the alaus
[1:31:11] stay left there is life in there
[1:31:15] there is a promise for a chicken to come
[1:31:18] out of that area
[1:31:22] but if that heat environment is not put
[1:31:25] around it messes
[1:31:32] but when the air when the hen chicken
[1:31:35] lies on the egg uh
[1:31:40] egg
[1:31:49] foreign
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:16] there are so many dormant promises in
[1:32:19] this Bible yeah
[1:32:21] if you do not believe in this Bible in
[1:32:24] those promises they will do you no good
[1:32:29] but if you bring your presence you
[1:32:32] create that atmosphere of beliefs
[1:32:37] promises in the Bible are made manifest
[1:32:39] to you
[1:32:45] manifests
[1:32:48] because when you believe
[1:32:51] all things are
[1:33:21] but
[1:33:26] then Jesus said unto her
[1:33:29] did I not tell you that if you believe
[1:33:35] you shall see the glory of God
[1:33:38] remember earlier on he said this
[1:33:40] sickness is not unto death
[1:33:45] but it is for my glory
[1:33:48] he is reminding her Allah
[1:33:51] did I not tell you if you create that
[1:33:55] atmosphere yes
[1:33:58] you shall see the glory of God
[1:34:01] and when Jesus was standing there
[1:34:05] he cried out with a loud voice
[1:34:09] he cried out with a loud loud voice
[1:34:14] Lazarus Lazar Tom Ford saw the same
[1:34:19] voice
[1:34:21] the same voice that says let there be
[1:34:24] light
[1:34:27] is the same voice that was speaking
[1:34:31] the same voice that was able to create
[1:34:34] the whole world
[1:34:37] is the same voice that says Lazarus come
[1:34:40] forward
[1:34:42] now the Bible says when God speaks
[1:34:46] his word does not go back to his voice
[1:34:52] only goes back to him after it is
[1:34:55] accomplished that which he sent it
[1:34:56] foreign
[1:35:17] why because he was the almighty one who
[1:35:20] had spoken
[1:35:22] he stood there and Lazarus grave Allah
[1:35:31] that word was not going back to him
[1:35:34] until Lazarus said already
[1:35:38] that's the only outcome this whole
[1:35:40] situation was gonna end
[1:35:44] and he cried Lazarus come forward
[1:35:49] Lazarus
[1:35:50] he was he was in heaven already
[1:35:55] they tell us that when go to heaven the
[1:35:58] way
[1:36:01] well the prophet told us when he went to
[1:36:03] heaven he didn't want to come back
[1:36:06] no one goes to heaven and come once you
[1:36:09] come back
[1:36:11] I believe Lazarus was already having
[1:36:14] fellowship with Father Abraham
[1:36:17] but he heard that voice
[1:36:21] Lazarus come back
[1:36:24] it does not matter how much of a good
[1:36:26] time he was having
[1:36:30] but he heard that voice that had
[1:36:32] Authority
[1:36:35] says listen I'm enjoying this Fellowship
[1:36:42] greater Authority that's calling me back
[1:36:48] and he was lying there
[1:36:51] human body start decaying after three
[1:36:53] days
[1:37:01] life came back into him
[1:37:07] worms were already eating on his body
[1:37:12] and he was already smelling
[1:37:15] but when those worms they had Lazarus
[1:37:18] come back
[1:37:21] they had to stop what they were doing
[1:37:25] this in our job here is done
[1:37:32] because they heard a voice that had
[1:37:34] Authority
[1:37:36] amen amen Lazarus he stood there is
[1:37:46] amen amen demons have been troubling you
[1:37:49] a little more
[1:37:51] amen they've been having a party with
[1:37:53] you
[1:37:56] trying to destroy you
[1:37:58] but when God speaks
[1:38:01] they have to stop whatever they are
[1:38:04] doing
[1:38:45] it won't go back to him until those
[1:38:49] afflictions are gone
[1:38:55] and Jesus said unto them lose him
[1:39:00] and they said and he said let him go
[1:39:05] God reverse the process uh
[1:39:23] or town Potter
[1:39:25] maybe four days late
[1:39:29] but your late does not mean that God is
[1:39:32] late man you fed the veneer uh
[1:39:35] he always comes right on time
[1:39:40] you trust God's timing Allah
[1:39:44] when he comes that's the perfect time he
[1:39:47] was supposed to come here
[1:39:51] and when he comes nothing ever stays the
[1:39:54] same can't you live here
[1:39:56] hallelujah amen
[1:40:47] come on
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:24] so when the prophet of God says he will
[1:41:27] disintegrate anything that tries to
[1:41:29] bother you yeah
[1:41:32] he says oh it might attack you but thank
[1:41:35] you but it cannot harm you in the paper
[1:41:40] scripture that says
[1:41:42] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:41:45] prosper okay now I'm a foreign
[1:43:18] Do it For Your Glory
[1:43:25] the Bible says the prayer of a righteous
[1:43:28] and availeth much
[1:43:32] the prophet tells us a definition of a
[1:43:35] righteous man
[1:43:38] a righteous man is not a perfect man
[1:43:42] but a righteous man is a person when
[1:43:44] when they fall
[1:43:47] to get up and keep going
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:53] and realize your mistakes
[1:43:56] they I'm sorry Lord
[1:43:59] get up and keep on going living
[1:44:02] you are considered a righteous man
[1:44:06] or a righteous woman
[1:44:14] and he will come right on time
[1:44:17] roll that doubt away
[1:44:21] role that impatience away
[1:44:24] and he's going to speak life into your
[1:44:27] situation
[1:44:28] he's going to speak life into your
[1:44:30] problems
[1:44:32] and it will resurrect
[1:44:35] I am the resurrection
[1:44:40] and he is doing all that for his own
[1:44:43] glory
[1:44:45] amen amen God will hear your prayers
[1:44:48] hear the prophet that God says
[1:44:52] an angel is a servant
[1:44:55] an angel is a servant attention be our
[1:44:59] sons and daughters of God
[1:45:01] so who is more important a servant or a
[1:45:04] son or daughter
[1:45:06] is more important
[1:45:10] so you and me we are more important than
[1:45:13] Allah
[1:45:15] because all of us we have Guardian
[1:45:18] Angels around us
[1:45:25] protecting you from all harm and dangers
[1:45:31] so right now when you kneel down to pray

[1:45:38] and start praying too
[1:45:41] God would answer your prayer first
[1:45:45] he will listen to your prayers

[1:45:53] daughter

[1:46:14] and they cast them in the fire
[1:46:17] they say listen Equity even if God does
[1:46:21] not come to save us foreign
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:59] he sent one to come and flood the Earth
[1:47:04] that was an angel's assignment
[1:47:08] when God wanted to destroy Sodom and
[1:47:11] Gomorrah
[1:47:13] he sent angels to go do that assignment
[1:47:18] there are some assignments that are for
[1:47:21] angels to take care of yes
[1:47:25] but when the three Hebrew boys were put
[1:47:28] in the fire

[1:53:21] better of her
[1:53:24] then one day something woke me up in the
[1:53:27] middle of the night
[1:53:29] woke up and I started praying
