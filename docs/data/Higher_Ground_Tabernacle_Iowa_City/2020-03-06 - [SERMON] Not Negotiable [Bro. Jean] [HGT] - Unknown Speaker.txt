up here and I said you know what I were coming here you know supporting the church supporting the young people in this way so we're not gonna be too much longer here standing if you got brought your word with you you brought your word with you the Bible your sword we're gonna go to a couple of scriptures starting in the book of Exodus chapter 10 verse 24 through 26 exodus chapter 10 and if you dare say Amen if you got it in the King James Version it reads and Pharaoh caught on to Moses and said go ye served the Lord only verse 24 let your flocks and your herds be stayed and let your little ones also go with you first 25 and Moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice until the Lord our God verse 26 our cattle also shall go with us there shall not in hoove be left behind for dare of must we take to serve the Lord our God and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come hither second verses Joshua chapter 1 verses 2 through 6 Joshua chapter one verses two through six verse two says Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over to this Jordan down and all these people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the wilderness in this 11 on even unto the great river the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites and unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the Sun shall be your coasts there shall not any man be able to stand before the all the days of that life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee verse 6 says be strong and of good courage for unto this the people shall divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give to them every head bowed every eyes closed Lord gracious heavenly father God we thank you once again for giving us an opportunity to be here this evening to worship You Lord nor the most important thing is that we come to hear your word so we can change to become just more like you Heavenly Father God let your holy spirit have control Lord no matter if we're great in numbers or small in numbers Lord the most important thing is that your Holy Spirit is here among us tonight Heavenly Father God have your way take control of all things no we cast down every evil spirit every devil every demonic power that comes against us tonight as your children as your bride Heavenly Father that have your way in Jesus mighty name we pray amen you may have your seats if you want to because the topic that I have I hope it shakes you and just a few moments we're going to talk about what God gives you is not negotiable that means whatever God has in store for you whatever God has commanded to give you it's non-negotiable to start off to begin with I read in Exodus chapter 10 Moses was commissioned to deliver the people we all know that it was a divine commissioned by God God commanded for Moses to deliver the people and we know that deliverance come through revelation if God is giving you something it's by revelation we know that from the message faith is revelation what is revelation revelation is something that is made known or made to understand the purpose of something by the Spirit of God you may not have to understand something but I long that you know that it came from God is a revelation to you therefore a revelation is a reality revelation it's a life is just not knowledge but it's a life so the first principle I want to establish this evening is that when God gives you something by revelation it belongs to you I'll say one more time when God gives you something by revelation it belongs to you as we start off again Moses we know that was commissioned to deliver the children of Israel from Pharaoh so that means everything that belongs to the children of Israel was to be delivered that means everything that belonged to God belong to Israel since Moses was to deliver Israel everything that Moses delivered for Israel Israel had to be delivered when Moses came to deliver Israel Pharaoh came with a scheme it's called negotiating in other word is called compromise negotiating is used as a tool of compromise meaning that when you're compromising something you're trading something to get something back in return either form or value equal value or less to see when you compromise you have to give up something to get something sometimes you can come out with less even though you had more so even though all the power and the blessings of God were in the children of Israel from God through Moses Pharaoh came with a scheme to negotiate he told Moses you know what you can leave but leave your children behind leave your cattle behind leave otherwise leave your food supply behind and I'm afraid sometimes as a child of God in this message in the bride is that that we negotiate with the devil we compromise with sin we compromise with the world we compromise with sickness however Moses was not going to negotiate because Moses understood that everything that belonged to God belonged to him everything that belonged to the children of Israel belonged to him Moses that was not going to compromise welfare he refused to do so so anything that belongs to the Bride of Christ the children of God we are not no longer going to negotiate with the devil about anything see as believers even as people many times I see that we give into negotiations with the devil we compromise what's in the world the message the word our families our churches even our children but we need to be like Moses and make a statement that everything that God gives us belongs to us every promise of the word belongs to us every believer of this church belongs to us we are not leaving anything or anyone behind so if you don't have a brother who is here assisted as here a father mother you got the claim by the blood of Christ and you gotta not negotiate with the devil you have to have a certain confidence otherwise you got to be bold you got to have confidence in the Word of God you got to understand that whatever God gives you by revelation is non-negotiable when something is non-negotiable you don't come to the table to talk about it because it's no longer being talked about it is a done deal when God healed us he heard us completely from the day of the Cross when he saved you he saved you completely right but whatever that you desire you got to claim her yourself the message total deliverance paragraph 80 through 82 the Prophet said here brother William Branham he said Pharaoh wanted to agree remember that Pharaoh is the one that's trying to make the deal it's always the devil it's always trying to make deals what the children of crazy that isn't that strange he said Moses you can all go but you leave your children behind or you leave some of your cattle back here paragraph 81 that's the way the devil wants a Christian to come it will be all right for you to join church but you don't never forgive the Joneses it will be alright if you can bring in if if you don't have to give up your smoking if you don't have to give up your drinking you're lying you're still in your fall fighting you don't have to get that up just join the church but I like paragraph 82 he said but Moses wasn't a compromiser Moses wanted complete deliverance he said we would not leave one wolf behind we'll take everything that belongs to us when we go to worship the Lord and sometimes I felt like in a message we get complacent but the Brooks about how we worship God we serve God how we expect the power of God to move but if you want God to move first you got to move yourself into prayer you got to believe God that he's going to do something you know man on a Monday night Wednesday night Friday night five people ten people it all matter when you come to church you got to believe that God is here you got to have a confidence that know that anything is possible if you believe in God but you got to know what God gives you it's non-negotiable if your body is hurting it and you need some kind of healing deliverance it's non-negotiable God already healed you you just got to believe in and apply it and sometimes you realize that in your spiritual life you are not where you need to be well you got to tell the devil that I know I'm not there but I'm going to be there that's not negotiable I'm not negotiating being a halfway Christian I want to be a full complete Christian well you got to speak it to yourself you got to have your own confidence in God that whatever God gives you is non-negotiable paragraph 83 that's what the church ought to be we'll take righteousness will take holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the altar we'll be a real group we'll leave nothing behind we'll take everything there won't be one who stay back here you know and people can pray in such a way - the devil will have to give in that's the way Moses and his group did they got over there and got under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total deliverance Moses his self he was unified with God but Israel wasn't there still was sin they murmured against Moses and they said why why do you do this you bring more trouble upon us Pharaoh just double double their tally the bricks and so forth that was Moses he was completely in the hands of God totally delivered from sheepherding to her to her as God's sheep he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because they were still murmuring among them murmuring means that you you know that God is doing something but should go back and complain about it they God really healed me did that brother really pray for me with all his heart am I really delivered murmuring you're complaining your accent questions about if God did it or not but see Moses wasn't question about if God did it or not most had the Commission when your Commission that means you have an inspiration from God that means if God is sending you that I mean God has to back up his word as we move on to our next point we see that Joshua was a disciple of Moses he was a serpent under Moses ministry after Moses Joshua was ordained to lead the children of Israel to the Canaan land we know that Joshua means Jehovah Savior is also as the Prophet says type that as the Holy Spirit he was commissioned by God to take the land so he had to go and claim what belonged to him in the children of Israel see Joshua understood that the land was theirs since they were free people so God had to tell Joshua to be courageous to be strong and go and get everything that belongs to you because in my third point here because deliverance gives you access to claim your rights when you are free you can claim your belonging in your promises as long as you stay with the word in the Holy Spirit you you will have all your promises you will have all of your rights as a Christian as a born-again believer but for you to go and claim and fight for your rights it requires some sacrifices it requires some effort it requires some heart every Christian has a role to play and if you want the promise of God the promises of God in your life to be manifested then you got to have faith you got to believe in God and he will reward you if you seek Him diligently and a message Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever 1961 January 18 paragraph 23 the Prophet says here God told Joshua every foot of ground wherever every piece of ground that your foot steps upon I give you two for possession so footprints means possession and God's given us every blessing that we have need of and will ask for and the only thing we have to do is take it now God is not going to bring it and give it to you you've got to go and get it it's yours you understand I everyone we've got to possess it it's ours see God Tomos done in Egypt I'll give you the land but it was invested with her in more with the ammonites the Hittites and all different kinds of i'ts and mites but God could have went up there and caused a storm to come by and swept it all out and said coming my children he doesn't do that way he said I give it to you now go take it when I look at this word when I look at the message look at the promises of God I realized that God is calling for believers to be bold that means you got to have some guts you gotta have some confidence about you in other words how to kiss it today gotta have some balls you got to be sure that God is giving you a promise that you can hold on to coz member God is the only one that can fulfill his word I can't I'm gonna fail I'm a man even the Prophet said that he said that I'm a man I'm gonna fail too but God cannot fail but you got to believe in God you got to believe in his word you you gotta you gotta make it personal that I'm not negotiating with the devil well sometimes we do sometimes we don't feel like coming to church sometimes we don't feel like praying sometimes the preachers don't feel like praying sometimes we don't feel like singing a song sometimes we need to see other people in church we need to see a whole group a large number of people know a lot of people left Egypt but a lot of people left Egypt with Egypt in their heart still see they were negotiating with the devil because they can't to a point where they started to murmur Moses take us back there's a place that when you get it to God there is no going back but you gotta know that it's non-negotiable it's not to be talked about when the devil comes in say stuff in your mind it stays up in your ears and your head tells you certain things at some point of time you got to tell the devil to shut up you can't let certain things just keep coming to your mind and you know putting certain thoughts and ideas into your mind you got to take a stand for yourself spiritually it could be in prayer it can be in your car wherever you go you but you got to make a stand you got to let God know that I'm standing upon your word it's your job to fulfill your word that is not already pushing that if he said something he mean what he saved I can try all as I want this to me what I say but I'm gonna fail we say that we want to come to church on time sometimes we try to come on time or you know we get stuck in traffic we come on but what God there's no traffic every time that God has is the right time everything that he says is the right thing to say but you know us being human beings you know we're gonna fail that's why the Holy Spirit is here to help us it's gonna make us overcomers it's gonna make us to be overachievers yeah we were going to achieve but first you got to believe in God you got to have faith you got to have a certain confidence about you God has to trust you Church I realize that a lot of people just come to church let me tell you I've been in the church where they had 300 people and in the same day I seen it come down to 50 people even 25 people but my dad stays strong with the word and now we're back to 300 plus people it's not about him it's about staying with the word the word is what it's going tract and bring results but sometimes we get away from the world we get lazy if we get into our flesh you know sometimes you know many of us you know we watch Netflix we watch YouTube you know we watch all kind of different things you know instead of coming to service on Friday night you know we out doing shopping doing other things you know thinking about what we're gonna cook tomorrow or we fun to eat we finna put a microwave how we fun to go to work you know we have all kinds of things in our minds but not the promises of God but if God can find some believers the who can let's take his word and there's trust in him in an aromatic visit for on campus two three people God can still move I can still heal the power God is still real but you got to be bold you got to have a certain confidence about the Word of God about coming to worship the Lord if God called you he called you for a reason when God was making you he couldn't find no better person but to meet but you the best version of you is when you have a real Holy Ghost inside of you but you have to not negotiate with the devil sometimes he makes you want to come to church and then you fall asleep in church the preacher is preaching and your eyes start wandering off and then can you start daydreaming about tomorrow what you're gonna do it in the week after next week I know but you have to have a certain bonus that I refuse to let the devil come and make me sleepy in church Church you gotta get to a point that any service anything can happen sometimes we don't gotta wait to even be in church we could be in the parking lot and God can still move but sometimes we limit God I work in the jail so I would say sometimes we put handcuffs on God we restrain them if there's nobody who's gonna believe in God in this world it has to be us we are the only believers that God has left in this day people are turning it back on a message on Christ onward on God on the church on on you on your friends let people leave but let you stay with the word there's no negotiating about your friends your family if you want your fam to be in Christ then you got to stand with Christ if you want to have a real choice you got to stand with the word to have a real church if you want to be a real believer you got to stand with the word you got it can't negotiate with a devil no matter how I feel sometimes I don't feel like praying as a minister sometimes I don't feel like fasting and praying sometimes I don't feel like doing what I need to do but when you have a certain ambition a certain desire motivation I commissioned be the only person in church and I was still doing that God would still speak I don't look at Church in numbers and it got don't care about how many quantity is about quality but God is looking for some real believers in this day because the world that believers in sin they believe is in the devil but what about God well his believers that we cannot let the devil rob us of our promises if somebody is not here in this church and you want to be here where you got to take that stand oh brother Brooks preface on so know what about you pray for that brother what about you pray for that sister the pastor can do it all or the ministers or the song leaders or the musicians we can't do everything it takes everybody got to make a personal decision to make a commitment what do you want to serve God are you not what God gives you is non-negotiable it God gives you a church you better do it your best to keep this church and God give you a Holy Spirit you better do your best to keep that Holy Spirit if God is giving you an or thing on your life make sure that you do your best to keep that anointing in your life because the devil will try to come and talk to you say you know you don't have to do that you don't have to pray you don't have to do certain things what do you mean that's what a devil wants you to do he want us to compromise but God's children are not compromisers we don't have time to compromise we got time to exploit destroy and kill every demonic force that comes against the Bride of Christ that is the mission it all matter to me if you're 10 years old 20 30 40 50 60 I don't care a believer is a believer a believer it can be a believer at any age but you got to believe the Word of God and take action Moses took action Joshua took action they heard the Word of God they aren't a new by revelation it belongs to them sometimes certain situation look difficult look hard but you got a state with the word now people don't read their Bibles no more better Brooks people don't read the message but they could be on YouTube and Facebook 24/7 but yet they want to see a power of God if you were just want to see a real power of God in your life just not the church but in your life you got to make some sacrifices you got to be willing to put all that foolishness behind I ain't saying I wrong with Facebook or Instagram whatever but sometimes somethings ain't necessary sometimes we gotta cool we got to find a way to create time for God sometimes we got a we got a minimize the time that we spend with friends eating out food buying food everyday eating all this food and and sometime we waste all this food too but if we really took the time to understand that God is God God God only has one believer on this world earth and it is you if you believe that with all your heart it will change your life if you are the only believer on this earth is you don't look to your pastor your brother whoever you got to believe it for yourself that God can have anything happen through you but you got to put in some effort you got to put in some prayer it's gonna require for you to come to service says even when you don't feel I could come anyways even if it's the last minute still come because God can speak to the beginning to the end in a parking lot God can speak 24/7 anytime anywhere any place God can still speak in your bedroom at your house in your car at work God can speak to you but sometimes we fail to listen to when God is speaking to us sometimes we get caught up doing a whole bunch of different things we listening to music friends people talking watching TV and and God is trying to speak the guy's trying to get us to the church to a level where he can fully express himself in the children of God can only be nothing but just like God the Bride of Christ can only be nothing but to look like her husband just like Christ but what a Christ dude oh Christ had to put in some work peahats are fast and pray he had to deal with some sufferings and sufferings can be different for different people it might be your coworker it might be your best friend it might be a husband your wife it it varies for different people but you got to stay into prayer now people don't want to pray take the time in to end until really consecrate yeah but talks about going to the next if you want to go to the next level you got to do more now to get there if you want to see every vowel you got to put in some work now so the revival can take place as I said one time in preaching I said God doesn't pay lazy workers in other words lazy workers do not get paid so if you want to find the full benefits of God you got to put in some work you got to put in some time to prayer read and come and church on time fasting meditating calling other people to share but knowing about the word and whatnot you got to keep that right atmosphere because the Bible says first Corinthians 15 verse 33 that bad company corrupts good character or good habits you see if Moses had a different influence it would have changed the whole outcome if Joshua would have had a different influence would have changed the whole outcome but look how when men were in the presence of God that they found a revelation from God ahead changed a whole nation one man delivered a whole nation and might he wasn't you know yet him he was an older man with a with a stick with a rod one man was able to change a whole nation what about one per one Bride of Christ member can't we change the whole city Church as the bride I'm not looking for just my church I'm looking for the whole city to be changed I want my city to see the glory of God not to show off that we believers that we believe a message no no it's about the real Holy Spirit manifesting through real people that is the purpose of this message that's the reason I came I can talk about the Holy Ghost so that the Holy Ghost can be in action in your life in my life so when people leave we don't leave here the same I don't want to be an average Christian the Prophet said in the same message God doesn't call us to be a halfway Christian I halfway a preacher but we can be halfway we can so sometimes sometimes we we want the best in everything else but God we weren't the best cars won the best clothes worn the best jewelry when the best things that smell good we want the best food to eat but we don't want to be the best Christians but yeah we want every promise we want every reward that comes of being a Christian but we don't put into work we don't put in a time we don't put in the effort Church the prophet of God could not get you if he did not pray and fast the church can never get to where it needs to get to if we don't pray and fast if we don't meditate if we don't read this Bible if we don't read this message if we don't stay in fellowship but you got to be committed you got to have a certain bonus about you that I'm no longer negotiating with me being a mediocre I don't want you to be mediocre when I come back next time I want you to be better than where you are now I want to see a power of God moving this place that even a parking lot that people are screaming and shoving but first it starts with you don't leave here tonight be the same old you know what brother preached a good word I don't care about preaching a good word the preachers want to see results the preachers also got to be a result just before our clothes a couple years ago 20 18 I believe I see in our church our young people and the Holy Spirit came down so strong that there was not a person in church who could not feel the presence of God but you know what I realize not everybody received the promise of God like they were supposed to see some people conscious just to feel good let's to hear a good word or the preacher but I preached a good message today and about preaching a good message and about paying tithes and offering it's about all do you have something in you that can make you be like Christ 24/7 is there something any that when somebody cuts you out cut you off wanting to take your life do you have enough guiding you to change that person do you have enough God that changed any situation it only takes the best ISM of the Holy Spirit that is the most important thing that that will makes the devil afraid of you but first you got to make a stand you got to make a commitment if you got to be a committed to excellence that's what Christians are we're committed to be excellent every single day sometimes honest now we're not gonna get there by ourselves we're not sometimes you know we get tired God God understands us so water that's what he gave us the Holy Spirit he gaves us weekday services he gave us a pastor he gave us ministers because sometimes we need to be recharged what tonight I'm recharging you take every promise that God has given you claim it for yourself for your child don't wait to Sunday for the north end of thought no the north thing is right here you just got a claim and believe it even when you get home say god I'm standing with your word I'm I'm not negotiating with any devil any longer any form of sickness how you feel about kabhi medial no no God I'm not negotiating of what what you gave me some of you guys are called to do great things call it the sing call to minister not interest but outside of church car to be a good housewife to be a good husband but you first gotta have a certain belief in your heart that that is what God called you to do and then once you have that revelation it becomes life it's natural church an app which you don't have to force to be an apple tree it just stays on the ground receives water and sunlight and it grows and it pushes out you don't have the full yourself to be a Christian just receive the Holy Spirit one time and just feed upon that word and it would slowly push out the fruits of the spirit goodness gentleness peace loving kindness love mercy but not if you don't want that no more people want to be just an average Christian I don't want to be an average Christian that doesn't cook God never called anybody to be an average Christian but we come make ourselves average as a musicians come don't come tonight this thinking is a regular serve it's not a regular service you gotta take what God has given you God wants you to be great but you got to put in effort to be great not great to show off but a Holy Spirit I can demonstrate the great power of God in your life God is not calling us to be normal just because we have five people in church I don't care who we got in church if God is here that means God has something to do and if we can believe God anything is possible God can shake any situation he can change any problem but you got to believe in him you got to be willing that you're gonna make some sacrifices that you that you want a Holy Spirit to change you in a few minutes as we're closing please do not forget that what God gives you is not negotiable if God gave you children they are known non-negotiable don't allow the devil to have your children even if he got your children still claim them anyways because by faith whatever that you have has to come to pass even if your husband is not here your wife is not here and I'm not by faith that's you're claiming them into the church

negotiating with the devil any longer by my brother by my sister by my spiritual life i Lord I don't I need to do better I need to do more lord help me I'm not giving the devil anymore rights I'm

you if you need a house whatever that you need you need children you need a wife you need a husband yeah I can provide anything but you gotta believe it God is looking for believers and God only has

that once again [Music] [Music] they conference grace it is first let's just get gone around an applause so many wonderful things were said tonight I thank God for His grace one of the things that really stood out in my heart and mind when God spoke and said you know we as people want the best of everything except when it comes to Christ and that is so true I was thinking about how when we go shopping for cars we may have but a certain amount of money but we want the best of those cars whatever that money can purchase we want the best so we're just not gonna let the salesman give us any kind of thing we want the best of what we we can see in purchase and now we can come in Christ and we can you know we ought to desire to be the best of Christian that's what I pray for I believe this message with all our heart and I says God if there's not one person in this world the desire to see the message of Malikov will be made manifest and lived this is man this man this man this man you know that's my ambition to see it come alive to live through us I really I like that are more than like it none the good not much you need no deal me ain't got time to talk about it it's fixed right amen the message is fake ain't no use in talking about it people discussing this discussing that no every promise of the Lord is yay when you believe with all your heart with all your mind to go get it you fight for I believe that brother thank God for that message I I didn't write that down when I got I wrote it in my heart I got a lot of stuff there I got I was really messed up people y'all got a line I mean if I had the energy had to you and you guys gotta that's with those two fellas with those baby faces I say y'all make me feel real old today but you know I appreciate the Lord you know and something else I wanted to say let me tell you I was sobered and I wanted to go to Liberia I've never been there before I really wanted to go part of me did and part of me did not but the greater part of my heart wanted to go and I was just really concerned you know says Lord I said you know I want you're perfect in divine will you know God had to give me a witnessing because I couldn't sleep I was I was not sleeping for days on you know because I thought well if they shut it down if they quarantine it it's okay if it's the will of God you understand me because that's the way Peter was God said turn around Peter's time for you to could be crucified he went on in anyway and that's the way I was feeling even though I had to tell her brother you know I don't want to hear it nobody's opinion or what you're thinking I want to hear from God and it was God who gave me a witness not to go but if God would have told me to go brother I would have gone I still got the ticket I don't even know what I'm gonna do with it you know because I'm not afraid of anything even if I if it mean he said go and you're gonna be quarantined for 34 days even so as long as I'm in his arms that's all that matters people but I'll tell you one thing too and I'm not gonna prolong I see that we're tired we got here a little late I appreciate your effort I appreciate your coming supporting the young people and you know I like to be around young people because they keep me young amen and and I like the energy the energy is what I need you know and so I look at that and I wanna I want to say by God's grace we we are blessed people and we need to keep pushing and pressing on I expect great things I just do when young people I've seen God do it and you know when it comes to the will and the work word of God I want to see the Lord manifest and I really brother if we could follow the things that God said tonight see God is a God of a riot II I mean you know we don't have to we don't have to act like Hollywood in order to get the message over you know I believe it just like it is that's how Jesus preached just like that you know you know in me I get to screaming in Holland but that's not necessary as long as the words are coming floor and they are anointed and your heart is right see that's what what counts so but anyway we love the Lord it was something else I wanted to say but I can't remember what it is right now that comes with the age you know but I really take God seriously I really do keep where we are today and all of the things that's what I want to say thank you Jesus I don't know how this cool coronavirus is going to end up it's bad they say you know some of it could be politic political I don't know but I'll tell you what the Lord told me just the other day when I was in prayer the Lord told me when they come up with a vaccine don't take it that was just for me now why would God tell me that because the same God that told me not to take a flu shot it's the same God that tells me not that why we don't know what they put in in this stuff let God talk to you people this this look like a political thing I mean weak this thing could be moving right into the stock market crashed by the way it looking you understand me it looks bigger than what it is but if they put this thing out there so bad because now they're saying this thing is mutating I gotta let you know this they say it's mutating so what if it goes into a big old big old thing if it's real you don't mean like they say it is they won't have to force people to take the vaccine they'll run to the slaughterhouse like a you know people animals to the slaughter my point is the just shall live by faith we know America y'all better know America then give you some medicine or some injection and have you grown an extra arm trusting God y'all understand because we Tama that one world order and communica y'all know all these things I'm taking place let's say this is the time and you move into that thing like everybody else and this you know and I know this is just to me this is no brainer I know some people because they work in hospitals and and work in schools and stuff it's a mandatory thing they have to take shots but if you take a flu shot what are they giving you the flu Pisa I took a flu shot and then I caught the flu you took the flu shot you didn't catch it with your nose or your mouth you caught it by injection and sometimes it's worse then and I'm like okay I rarely get the flu I rarely get a cold right my point is God keeps me I don't need a shot to get a flu these are no-brainer that's what I caught this is a no-brainer so what I'm trying to say is if if this corona virus if they keep you a shock what the very thing you running from you can't take it your heart it makes no sense to me no keep it and if they make it mandatory then you know it's political you love the Lord amen the watchman is on the wall folks I'm watching everything I love the word rose I thought I mean just wonderful looking forward to tomorrow service we're not gonna prolong it [Music] if you didn't bring your offering today bring it tomorrow and that's just to help the brother out you know we love the Lord and whether y'all give or not we don't give we just know that that's part of the service - is that right and you don't give a nickel or dime that's not your best we all got quiet even the pee on the stop god no y'all think I love money but God knows that no I don't know you know I've seen people big and carry on I don't do that but I do believe my revelation about money is that the more you give that is a that is that's nothing but the truth but it has to be a revelation it has to be a revelation fill my cup [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] service will be Warren liver 11 a.m. or never third 11 a.m. so it's our it's a youth meeting tomorrow [Music] [Music] he does got nuts right or the bow the bow nice nice with the Word of God that we've heard make yourself a
