[39:21] 10 verse 24 through 26
[39:38] exodus chapter 10
[39:47] and if you dare say Amen if you got it
[39:51] in the King James Version it reads and
[39:56] Pharaoh caught on to Moses and said go
[40:00] ye served the Lord only verse 24 let
[40:07] your flocks and your herds be stayed and
[40:09] let your little ones also go with you
[40:11] first 25 and Moses said thou must give
[40:15] us also sacrifices and burnt offerings
[40:17] that we may sacrifice until the Lord our
[40:20] God
[40:20] verse 26 our cattle also shall go with
[40:24] us there shall not in hoove be left
[40:27] behind for dare of must we take to serve
[40:31] the Lord our God and we know not with
[40:34] what we must serve the Lord until we
[40:36] come hither second verses Joshua chapter
[40:41] 1 verses 2 through 6
[40:57] Joshua chapter one verses two through
[40:59] six verse two says Moses my servant is
[41:03] dead
[41:03] now therefore arise go over to this
[41:07] Jordan down and all these people unto
[41:10] the land which I do give to them even to
[41:13] the children of Israel every place that
[41:17] the sole of your foot shall tread upon
[41:19] that have I given unto you as I said
[41:22] unto Moses from the wilderness in this
[41:25] 11 on even unto the great river the
[41:27] river Euphrates and all the land of the
[41:30] Hittites and unto the Great Sea toward
[41:32] the going down of the Sun shall be your
[41:33] coasts there shall not any man be able
[41:37] to stand before the all the days of that
[41:39] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[41:43] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[41:46] forsake thee verse 6 says be strong and
[41:49] of good courage for unto this the people
[41:53] shall divide for an inheritance the land
[41:55] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[41:58] to them every head bowed every eyes
[42:00] closed Lord gracious heavenly father God
[42:03] we thank you once again for giving us an
[42:05] opportunity to be here this evening to
[42:07] worship You Lord nor the most important
[42:10] thing is that we come to hear your word
[42:12] so we can change to become just more
[42:14] like you Heavenly Father God let your
[42:16] holy spirit have control Lord no matter
[42:18] if we're great in numbers or small in
[42:20] numbers Lord the most important thing is
[42:22] that your Holy Spirit is here among us
[42:24] tonight
[42:24] Heavenly Father God have your way take
[42:27] control of all things
[42:28] no we cast down every evil spirit every
[42:31] devil every demonic power that comes
[42:33] against us tonight as your children as
[42:36] your bride Heavenly Father that have
[42:37] your way in Jesus mighty name we pray
[42:39] amen you may have your seats
[42:43] if you want to because the topic that I
[42:46] have I hope it shakes you and just a few
[42:53] moments we're going to talk about what
[42:55] God gives you is not negotiable
[43:01] that means whatever God has in store for
[43:04] you whatever God has commanded to give
[43:06] you it's non-negotiable
[43:10] to start off to begin with I read in
[43:14] Exodus chapter 10
[43:16] Moses was commissioned to deliver the
[43:18] people we all know that it was a divine
[43:22] commissioned by God God commanded for
[43:26] Moses to deliver the people and we know
[43:30] that deliverance come through revelation
[43:33] if God is giving you something it's by
[43:36] revelation we know that from the message
[43:38] faith is revelation
[43:39] what is revelation revelation is
[43:43] something that is made known or made to
[43:46] understand the purpose of something by
[43:48] the Spirit of God you may not have to
[43:51] understand something but I long that you
[43:53] know that it came from God is a
[43:55] revelation to you therefore a revelation
[43:58] is a reality revelation it's a life is
[44:03] just not knowledge but it's a life so
[44:07] the first principle I want to establish
[44:08] this evening is that when God gives you
[44:11] something by revelation it belongs to
[44:13] you
[44:15] I'll say one more time when God gives
[44:18] you something by revelation it belongs
[44:20] to you as we start off again Moses we
[44:27] know that was commissioned to deliver
[44:30] the children of Israel from Pharaoh so
[44:33] that means everything that belongs to
[44:36] the children of Israel was to be
[44:38] delivered that means everything that
[44:42] belonged to God belong to Israel since
[44:46] Moses was to deliver Israel everything
[44:50] that Moses delivered for Israel Israel
[44:53] had to be delivered when Moses came to
[44:57] deliver Israel Pharaoh came with a
[45:00] scheme it's called negotiating in other
[45:06] word is called compromise negotiating is
[45:12] used as a tool of compromise
[45:14] meaning that when you're compromising
[45:16] something you're trading something to
[45:18] get something back in return either form
[45:21] or value equal value or less to see when
[45:25] you compromise you have to give up
[45:28] something to get something sometimes you
[45:32] can come out with less even though you
[45:34] had more so even though all the power
[45:39] and the blessings of God were in the
[45:42] children of Israel from God through
[45:43] Moses Pharaoh came with a scheme to
[45:46] negotiate he told Moses you know what
[45:50] you can leave but leave your children
[45:53] behind leave your cattle behind leave
[45:56] otherwise leave your food supply behind
[45:58] and I'm afraid sometimes as a child of
[46:03] God in this message in the bride is that
[46:05] that we negotiate with the devil we
[46:08] compromise with sin we compromise with
[46:12] the world we compromise with sickness
[46:17] however Moses was not going to negotiate
[46:21] because Moses understood that everything
[46:25] that belonged to God belonged to him
[46:27] everything that belonged to the children
[46:29] of Israel belonged to him Moses that was
[46:35] not going to compromise welfare he
[46:37] refused to do so
[46:40] so anything that belongs to the Bride of
[46:43] Christ the children of God we are not no
[46:46] longer going to negotiate with the devil
[46:48] about anything see as believers even as
[46:52] people many times I see that we give
[46:55] into negotiations with the devil we
[46:58] compromise what's in the world the
[47:00] message the word our families our
[47:02] churches even our children but we need
[47:05] to be like Moses and make a statement
[47:07] that everything that God gives us
[47:12] belongs to us every promise of the word
[47:17] belongs to us every believer of this
[47:21] church belongs to us we are not leaving
[47:25] anything or anyone behind
[47:27] so if you don't have a brother who is
[47:29] here assisted as here a father mother
[47:31] you got the claim by the blood of Christ
[47:33] and you gotta not negotiate with the
[47:36] devil you have to have a certain
[47:38] confidence otherwise you got to be bold
[47:40] you got to have confidence in the Word
[47:42] of God you got to understand that
[47:46] whatever God gives you by revelation is
[47:49] non-negotiable when something is
[47:53] non-negotiable you don't come to the
[47:55] table to talk about it because it's no
[47:57] longer being talked about it is a done
[48:00] deal when God healed us he heard us
[48:03] completely from the day of the Cross
[48:04] when he saved you he saved you
[48:06] completely right but whatever that you
[48:09] desire you got to claim her yourself the
[48:16] message total deliverance paragraph 80
[48:19] through 82 the Prophet said here brother
[48:22] William Branham he said Pharaoh wanted
[48:24] to agree remember that Pharaoh is the
[48:27] one that's trying to make the deal
[48:28] it's always the devil it's always trying
[48:31] to make deals what the children of crazy
[48:33] that isn't that strange he said Moses
[48:38] you can all go but you leave your
[48:41] children behind or you leave some of
[48:44] your cattle back here paragraph 81
[48:48] that's the way the devil wants a
[48:50] Christian to come it will be all right
[48:53] for you to join church but you don't
[48:57] never forgive the Joneses it will be
[49:00] alright if you can bring in if if you
[49:03] don't have to give up your smoking if
[49:04] you don't have to give up your drinking
[49:07] you're lying you're still in your fall
[49:08] fighting you don't have to get that up
[49:11] just join the church but I like
[49:14] paragraph 82 he said but Moses wasn't a
[49:17] compromiser Moses wanted complete
[49:21] deliverance he said we would not leave
[49:25] one wolf behind we'll take everything
[49:29] that belongs to us when we go to worship
[49:31] the Lord and sometimes I felt like in a
[49:35] message we get complacent but the Brooks
[49:37] about how we worship God
[49:40] we serve God how we expect the power of
[49:43] God to move but if you want God to move
[49:45] first you got to move yourself into
[49:47] prayer you got to believe God that he's
[49:51] going to do something you know man on a
[49:52] Monday night Wednesday night Friday
[49:53] night five people ten people it all
[49:55] matter when you come to church you got
[49:57] to believe that God is here you got to
[50:00] have a confidence that know that
[50:01] anything is possible if you believe in
[50:04] God but you got to know what God gives
[50:07] you it's non-negotiable
[50:09] if your body is hurting it and you need
[50:13] some kind of healing deliverance it's
[50:15] non-negotiable God already healed you
[50:17] you just got to believe in and apply it
[50:19] and sometimes you realize that in your
[50:22] spiritual life you are not where you
[50:24] need to be well you got to tell the
[50:26] devil that I know I'm not there but I'm
[50:28] going to be there that's not negotiable
[50:30] I'm not negotiating being a halfway
[50:32] Christian I want to be a full complete
[50:34] Christian well you got to speak it to
[50:37] yourself you got to have your own
[50:40] confidence in God that whatever God
[50:42] gives you is non-negotiable
[50:48] paragraph 83 that's what the church
[50:52] ought to be we'll take righteousness
[50:56] will take holiness we'll take the Holy
[51:00] Spirit
[51:00] we'll take a unified group when we go to
[51:03] the altar we'll be a real group we'll
[51:06] leave nothing behind we'll take
[51:08] everything there won't be one who stay
[51:13] back here you know and people can pray
[51:15] in such a way - the devil will have to
[51:18] give in that's the way Moses and his
[51:22] group did they got over there and got
[51:25] under the blood you notice until they
[51:28] got under the blood there was no total
[51:30] deliverance Moses his self he was
[51:36] unified with God but Israel wasn't there
[51:39] still was sin they murmured against
[51:43] Moses and they said why why do you do
[51:46] this you bring more trouble upon us
[51:50] Pharaoh just double double their tally
[51:53] the bricks and so forth that was Moses
[51:56] he was completely in the hands of God
[51:58] totally delivered from sheepherding to
[52:01] her to her as God's sheep he was totally
[52:05] delivered himself but the people wasn't
[52:09] delivered because they were still
[52:11] murmuring among them murmuring means
[52:14] that you you know that God is doing
[52:16] something but should go back and
[52:18] complain about it they God really healed
[52:20] me did that brother really pray for me
[52:24] with all his heart
[52:25] am I really delivered murmuring you're
[52:28] complaining
[52:29] your accent questions about if God did
[52:32] it or not but see Moses wasn't question
[52:36] about if God did it or not most had the
[52:38] Commission when your Commission that
[52:41] means you have an inspiration from God
[52:43] that means if God is sending you that I
[52:46] mean God has to back up his word
[52:57] as we move on to our next point we see
[53:03] that Joshua was a disciple of Moses he
[53:08] was a serpent under Moses ministry after
[53:13] Moses Joshua was ordained to lead the
[53:16] children of Israel to the Canaan land we
[53:18] know that Joshua means Jehovah Savior is
[53:21] also as the Prophet says type that as
[53:23] the Holy Spirit he was commissioned by
[53:27] God to take the land so he had to go and
[53:31] claim what belonged to him in the
[53:34] children of Israel see Joshua understood
[53:38] that the land was theirs since they were
[53:40] free people so God had to tell Joshua to
[53:44] be courageous to be strong and go and
[53:47] get everything that belongs to you
[53:55] because in my third point here because
[54:01] deliverance gives you access to claim
[54:05] your rights when you are free you can
[54:10] claim your belonging in your promises as
[54:13] long as you stay with the word in the
[54:16] Holy Spirit you you will have all your
[54:18] promises you will have all of your
[54:22] rights as a Christian as a born-again
[54:23] believer but for you to go and claim and
[54:28] fight for your rights it requires some
[54:30] sacrifices it requires some effort it
[54:34] requires some heart every Christian has
[54:39] a role to play and if you want the
[54:43] promise of God the promises of God in
[54:45] your life to be manifested then you got
[54:48] to have faith you got to believe in God
[54:51] and he will reward you if you seek Him
[54:55] diligently and a message Jesus Christ is
[55:02] the same yesterday today and forever
[55:03] 1961 January 18
[55:06] paragraph 23 the Prophet says here God
[55:10] told Joshua every foot of ground
[55:14] wherever every piece of ground that your
[55:16] foot steps upon I give you two for
[55:19] possession so footprints means
[55:23] possession and God's given us every
[55:27] blessing that we have need of and will
[55:30] ask for and the only thing we have to do
[55:34] is take it now God is not going to bring
[55:38] it and give it to you you've got to go
[55:42] and get it it's yours you understand I
[55:45] everyone we've got to possess it it's
[55:47] ours see God Tomos done in Egypt I'll
[55:51] give you the land but it was invested
[55:54] with her in more with the ammonites the
[55:56] Hittites and all different kinds of i'ts
[55:58] and mites but God could have went up
[56:01] there and caused a storm to come by and
[56:03] swept it all out and said coming my
[56:05] children he doesn't do that way he said
[56:08] I give it to you now go take it when I
[56:14] look at this word when I look at the
[56:16] message look at the promises of God I
[56:17] realized that God is calling for
[56:20] believers to be bold that means you got
[56:23] to have some guts you gotta have some
[56:25] confidence about you in other words how
[56:29] to kiss it today gotta have some balls
[56:32] you got to be sure that God is giving
[56:35] you a promise that you can hold on to
[56:37] coz member God is the only one that can
[56:39] fulfill his word I can't I'm gonna fail
[56:41] I'm a man even the Prophet said that he
[56:44] said that I'm a man I'm gonna fail too
[56:45] but God cannot fail but you got to
[56:49] believe in God you got to believe in his
[56:50] word you you gotta you gotta make it
[56:52] personal that I'm not negotiating with
[56:54] the devil well sometimes we do sometimes
[56:58] we don't feel like coming to church
[57:00] sometimes we don't feel like praying
[57:02] sometimes the preachers don't feel like
[57:03] praying sometimes we don't feel like
[57:07] singing a song sometimes we need to see
[57:10] other people in church we need to see a
[57:11] whole group a large number of people
[57:13] know a lot of people left Egypt
[57:18] but a lot of people left Egypt with
[57:21] Egypt in their heart still see they were
[57:26] negotiating with the devil
[57:28] because they can't to a point where they
[57:29] started to murmur Moses take us back
[57:32] there's a place that when you get it to
[57:35] God there is no going back but you gotta
[57:40] know that it's non-negotiable
[57:42] it's not to be talked about when the
[57:46] devil comes in say stuff in your mind it
[57:47] stays up in your ears and your head
[57:49] tells you certain things at some point
[57:53] of time you got to tell the devil to
[57:54] shut up
[57:57] you can't let certain things just keep
[57:59] coming to your mind and you know putting
[58:02] certain thoughts and ideas into your
[58:04] mind you got to take a stand for
[58:07] yourself spiritually it could be in
[58:11] prayer it can be in your car wherever
[58:12] you go you but you got to make a stand
[58:15] you got to let God know that I'm
[58:17] standing upon your word it's your job to
[58:19] fulfill your word that is not already
[58:23] pushing that if he said something he
[58:24] mean what he saved I can try all as I
[58:28] want this to me what I say but I'm gonna
[58:30] fail we say that we want to come to
[58:33] church on time sometimes we try to come
[58:35] on time or you know we get stuck in
[58:36] traffic we come on but what God there's
[58:38] no traffic every time that God has is
[58:41] the right time everything that he says
[58:44] is the right thing to say but you know
[58:46] us being human beings you know we're
[58:48] gonna fail that's why the Holy Spirit is
[58:50] here to help us it's gonna make us
[58:52] overcomers it's gonna make us to be
[58:55] overachievers yeah we were going to
[58:57] achieve but first you got to believe in
[59:00] God you got to have faith you got to
[59:03] have a certain confidence about you God
[59:06] has to trust you Church I realize that a
[59:11] lot of people just come to church let me
[59:15] tell you I've been in the church where
[59:16] they had 300 people and in the same day
[59:19] I seen it come down to 50 people even 25
[59:21] people but my dad stays strong with the
[59:24] word and now we're back to 300 plus
[59:27] people it's not about him it's about
[59:29] staying with the word the word is what
[59:31] it's going
[59:32] tract and bring results but sometimes we
[59:35] get away from the world we get lazy if
[59:36] we get into our flesh you know sometimes
[59:39] you know many of us you know we watch
[59:40] Netflix we watch YouTube you know we
[59:42] watch all kind of different things you
[59:44] know
[59:44] instead of coming to service on Friday
[59:46] night you know we out doing shopping
[59:48] doing other things you know thinking
[59:49] about what we're gonna cook tomorrow or
[59:51] we fun to eat we finna put a microwave
[59:52] how we fun to go to work you know we
[59:54] have all kinds of things in our minds
[59:56] but not the promises of God but if God
[59:59] can find some believers the who can
[1:00:01] let's take his word and there's trust in
[1:00:04] him in an aromatic visit for on campus
[1:00:05] two three people
[1:00:06] God can still move I can still heal the
[1:00:09] power God is still real but you got to
[1:00:13] be bold
[1:00:14] you got to have a certain confidence
[1:00:17] about the Word of God about coming to
[1:00:19] worship the Lord if God called you he
[1:00:21] called you for a reason when God was
[1:00:26] making you he couldn't find no better
[1:00:28] person but to meet but you the best
[1:00:32] version of you is when you have a real
[1:00:34] Holy Ghost inside of you but you have to
[1:00:38] not negotiate with the devil sometimes
[1:00:42] he makes you want to come to church and
[1:00:45] then you fall asleep in church the
[1:00:47] preacher is preaching and your eyes
[1:00:49] start wandering off and then can you
[1:00:50] start daydreaming about tomorrow what
[1:00:52] you're gonna do it in the week after
[1:00:53] next week I know but you have to have a
[1:00:59] certain bonus that I refuse to let the
[1:01:02] devil come and make me sleepy in church
[1:01:06] Church you gotta get to a point that any
[1:01:08] service anything can happen
[1:01:10] sometimes we don't gotta wait to even be
[1:01:12] in church we could be in the parking lot
[1:01:14] and God can still move but sometimes we
[1:01:18] limit God I work in the jail so I would
[1:01:23] say sometimes we put handcuffs on God we
[1:01:26] restrain them if there's nobody who's
[1:01:31] gonna believe in God in this world it
[1:01:33] has to be us we are the only believers
[1:01:36] that God has left in this day people are
[1:01:40] turning it back on a message on Christ
[1:01:41] onward on God on the church on on you on
[1:01:44] your friends let
[1:01:45] people leave but let you stay with the
[1:01:47] word there's no negotiating about your
[1:01:51] friends your family if you want your fam
[1:01:53] to be in Christ then you got to stand
[1:01:55] with Christ if you want to have a real
[1:01:58] choice you got to stand with the word to
[1:02:00] have a real church if you want to be a
[1:02:03] real believer you got to stand with the
[1:02:05] word you got it can't negotiate with a
[1:02:06] devil no matter how I feel sometimes I
[1:02:09] don't feel like praying as a minister
[1:02:11] sometimes I don't feel like fasting and
[1:02:13] praying sometimes I don't feel like
[1:02:17] doing what I need to do but when you
[1:02:19] have a certain ambition a certain desire
[1:02:23] motivation I commissioned be the only
[1:02:27] person in church and I was still doing
[1:02:28] that God would still speak I don't look
[1:02:32] at Church in numbers and it got don't
[1:02:35] care about how many quantity is about
[1:02:37] quality but God is looking for some real
[1:02:42] believers in this day because the world
[1:02:45] that believers in sin they believe is in
[1:02:48] the devil but what about God well his
[1:02:51] believers that we cannot let the devil
[1:02:55] rob us of our promises if somebody is
[1:03:01] not here in this church and you want to
[1:03:02] be here where you got to take that stand
[1:03:04] oh brother Brooks preface on so know
[1:03:07] what about you pray for that brother
[1:03:08] what about you pray for that sister the
[1:03:11] pastor can do it all or the ministers or
[1:03:13] the song leaders or the musicians we
[1:03:14] can't do everything it takes everybody
[1:03:17] got to make a personal decision to make
[1:03:20] a commitment what do you want to serve
[1:03:22] God are you not what God gives you is
[1:03:29] non-negotiable it God gives you a church
[1:03:32] you better do it your best to keep this
[1:03:34] church and God give you a Holy Spirit
[1:03:38] you better do your best to keep that
[1:03:39] Holy Spirit if God is giving you an or
[1:03:42] thing on your life make sure that you do
[1:03:43] your best to keep that anointing in your
[1:03:45] life because the devil will try to come
[1:03:49] and talk to you say you know you don't
[1:03:50] have to do that you don't have to pray
[1:03:54] you don't have to do certain things what
[1:03:58] do you mean that's what a devil wants
[1:03:59] you to
[1:03:59] do he want us to compromise but God's
[1:04:07] children are not compromisers we don't
[1:04:11] have time to compromise we got time to
[1:04:14] exploit destroy and kill every demonic
[1:04:17] force that comes against the Bride of
[1:04:19] Christ that is the mission it all matter
[1:04:21] to me if you're 10 years old 20 30 40 50
[1:04:24] 60 I don't care a believer is a believer
[1:04:27] a believer it can be a believer at any
[1:04:30] age but you got to believe the Word of
[1:04:33] God and take action Moses took action
[1:04:40] Joshua took action they heard the Word
[1:04:44] of God they aren't a new by revelation
[1:04:47] it belongs to them sometimes certain
[1:04:50] situation look difficult look hard but
[1:04:53] you got a state with the word now people
[1:04:58] don't read their Bibles no more better
[1:04:59] Brooks people don't read the message but
[1:05:02] they could be on YouTube and Facebook
[1:05:04] 24/7 but yet they want to see a power of
[1:05:07] God if you were just want to see a real
[1:05:11] power of God in your life just not the
[1:05:13] church but in your life you got to make
[1:05:14] some sacrifices you got to be willing to
[1:05:17] put all that foolishness behind I ain't
[1:05:21] saying I wrong with Facebook or
[1:05:23] Instagram whatever but sometimes
[1:05:24] somethings ain't necessary sometimes we
[1:05:28] gotta cool we got to find a way to
[1:05:30] create time for God sometimes we got a
[1:05:33] we got a minimize the time that we spend
[1:05:37] with friends eating out food buying food
[1:05:39] everyday eating all this food and and
[1:05:41] sometime we waste all this food too but
[1:05:46] if we really took the time to understand
[1:05:48] that God is God God God only has one
[1:05:52] believer on this world earth and it is
[1:05:53] you if you believe that with all your
[1:05:57] heart it will change your life if you
[1:06:00] are the only believer on this earth is
[1:06:02] you don't look to your pastor your
[1:06:04] brother whoever you got to believe it
[1:06:06] for yourself that God can have anything
[1:06:08] happen through you but you got to put in
[1:06:11] some effort you got to put in some
[1:06:12] prayer
[1:06:13] it's gonna require for you to come to
[1:06:15] service says even when you don't feel I
[1:06:17] could come anyways even if it's the last
[1:06:20] minute still come because God can speak
[1:06:22] to the beginning to the end in a parking
[1:06:24] lot God can speak 24/7 anytime anywhere
[1:06:26] any place God can still speak in your
[1:06:28] bedroom at your house in your car at
[1:06:30] work God can speak to you but sometimes
[1:06:32] we fail to listen to when God is
[1:06:34] speaking to us sometimes we get caught
[1:06:37] up doing a whole bunch of different
[1:06:39] things we listening to music friends
[1:06:41] people talking watching TV and and God
[1:06:43] is trying to speak the guy's trying to
[1:06:44] get us to the church to a level where he
[1:06:47] can fully express himself in the
[1:06:52] children of God can only be nothing but
[1:06:54] just like God the Bride of Christ can
[1:06:59] only be nothing but to look like her
[1:07:01] husband just like Christ but what a
[1:07:04] Christ dude oh Christ had to put in some
[1:07:06] work peahats are fast and pray he had to
[1:07:10] deal with some sufferings and sufferings
[1:07:13] can be different for different people it
[1:07:16] might be your coworker it might be your
[1:07:18] best friend it might be a husband your
[1:07:19] wife it it varies for different people
[1:07:21] but you got to stay into prayer now
[1:07:27] people don't want to pray take the time
[1:07:29] in to end until really consecrate yeah
[1:07:33] but talks about going to the next if you
[1:07:35] want to go to the next level you got to
[1:07:37] do more now to get there if you want to
[1:07:41] see every vowel you got to put in some
[1:07:42] work now so the revival can take place
[1:07:44] as I said one time in preaching I said
[1:07:48] God doesn't pay lazy workers in other
[1:07:51] words lazy workers do not get paid so if
[1:07:53] you want to find the full benefits of
[1:07:55] God you got to put in some work you got
[1:07:58] to put in some time to prayer read and
[1:08:00] come and church on time
[1:08:01] fasting meditating calling other people
[1:08:03] to share but knowing about the word and
[1:08:05] whatnot you got to keep that right
[1:08:07] atmosphere because the Bible says first
[1:08:09] Corinthians 15 verse 33 that bad company
[1:08:14] corrupts good character or good habits
[1:08:21] you see if Moses had a different
[1:08:24] influence it would have changed the
[1:08:25] whole outcome if Joshua would have had a
[1:08:28] different influence would have changed
[1:08:30] the whole outcome but look how when men
[1:08:32] were in the presence of God that they
[1:08:35] found a revelation from God ahead
[1:08:37] changed a whole nation one man delivered
[1:08:42] a whole nation and might he wasn't you
[1:08:44] know yet him he was an older man with a
[1:08:46] with a stick with a rod one man was able
[1:08:51] to change a whole nation what about one
[1:08:53] per one Bride of Christ member can't we
[1:08:58] change the whole city Church as the
[1:09:00] bride I'm not looking for just my church
[1:09:02] I'm looking for the whole city to
[1:09:03] be changed I want my city to see the
[1:09:07] glory of God not to show off that we
[1:09:09] believers that we believe a message no
[1:09:11] no it's about the real Holy Spirit
[1:09:14] manifesting through real people that is
[1:09:17] the purpose of this message that's the
[1:09:19] reason I came I can talk about the Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost so that the Holy Ghost can be in
[1:09:23] action in your life in my life so when
[1:09:26] people leave we don't leave here the
[1:09:27] same I don't want to be an average
[1:09:29] Christian the Prophet said in the same
[1:09:33] message God doesn't call us to be a
[1:09:35] halfway Christian I halfway a preacher
[1:09:37] but we can be halfway we can so
[1:09:40] sometimes sometimes we we want the best
[1:09:43] in everything else but God we weren't
[1:09:45] the best cars won the best clothes worn
[1:09:48] the best jewelry when the best things
[1:09:51] that smell good we want the best food to
[1:09:53] eat but we don't want to be the best
[1:09:55] Christians but yeah we want every
[1:09:59] promise we want every reward that comes
[1:10:01] of being a Christian but we don't put
[1:10:05] into work we don't put in a time we
[1:10:08] don't put in the effort Church the
[1:10:11] prophet of God could not get you if he
[1:10:12] did not pray and fast
[1:10:18] the church can never get to where it
[1:10:20] needs to get to if we don't pray and
[1:10:21] fast
[1:10:21] if we don't meditate if we don't read
[1:10:23] this Bible if we don't read this message
[1:10:24] if we don't stay in fellowship but you
[1:10:29] got to be committed
[1:10:31] you got to have a certain bonus about
[1:10:34] you that I'm no longer negotiating with
[1:10:37] me being a mediocre I don't want you to
[1:10:42] be mediocre when I come back next time I
[1:10:43] want you to be better than where you are
[1:10:44] now I want to see a power of God moving
[1:10:49] this place that even a parking lot that
[1:10:51] people are screaming and shoving but
[1:10:56] first it starts with you don't leave
[1:11:00] here tonight be the same old you know
[1:11:02] what brother preached a good word I
[1:11:04] don't care about preaching a good word
[1:11:06] the preachers want to see results
[1:11:08] the preachers also got to be a result
[1:11:14] just before our clothes a couple years
[1:11:19] ago 20 18 I believe I see in our church
[1:11:22] our young people and the Holy Spirit
[1:11:27] came down so strong that there was not a
[1:11:32] person in church who could not feel the
[1:11:34] presence of God but you know what I
[1:11:36] realize not everybody received the
[1:11:41] promise of God like they were supposed
[1:11:44] to see some people conscious just to
[1:11:46] feel good let's to hear a good word or
[1:11:48] the preacher but I preached a good
[1:11:51] message today and about preaching a good
[1:11:53] message and about paying tithes and
[1:11:56] offering it's about all do you have
[1:11:58] something in you that can make you be
[1:12:00] like Christ 24/7
[1:12:01] is there something any that when
[1:12:04] somebody cuts you out cut you off
[1:12:07] wanting to take your life do you have
[1:12:10] enough guiding you to change that person
[1:12:13] do you have enough God that changed any
[1:12:15] situation it only takes the best ISM of
[1:12:20] the Holy Spirit that is the most
[1:12:23] important thing that that will makes the
[1:12:25] devil afraid of you but first you got to
[1:12:29] make a stand
[1:12:31] you got to make a commitment if you got
[1:12:35] to be a committed to excellence that's
[1:12:37] what Christians are we're committed to
[1:12:39] be excellent every single day sometimes
[1:12:42] honest now we're not gonna get there by
[1:12:45] ourselves we're not sometimes you know
[1:12:47] we get tired God God understands us so
[1:12:50] water that's what he gave us the Holy
[1:12:51] Spirit he gaves us weekday services he
[1:12:56] gave us a pastor he gave us ministers
[1:12:57] because sometimes we need to be
[1:12:58] recharged what tonight I'm recharging
[1:13:02] you take every promise that God has
[1:13:05] given you claim it for yourself for your
[1:13:07] child don't wait to Sunday for the north
[1:13:10] end of thought no the north thing is
[1:13:11] right here you just got a claim and
[1:13:13] believe it even when you get home say
[1:13:16] god I'm standing with your word I'm I'm
[1:13:18] not negotiating with any devil any
[1:13:20] longer any form of sickness how you feel
[1:13:25] about kabhi medial no no God I'm not
[1:13:28] negotiating of what what you gave me
[1:13:32] some of you guys are called to do great
[1:13:34] things
[1:13:34] call it the sing call to minister not
[1:13:37] interest but outside of church car to be
[1:13:40] a good housewife to be a good husband
[1:13:42] but you first gotta have a certain
[1:13:44] belief in your heart that that is what
[1:13:46] God called you to do and then once you
[1:13:50] have that revelation it becomes life
[1:13:52] it's natural church an app which you
[1:13:57] don't have to force to be an apple tree
[1:13:59] it just stays on the ground receives
[1:14:04] water and sunlight and it grows and it
[1:14:05] pushes out you don't have the full
[1:14:08] yourself to be a Christian just receive
[1:14:10] the Holy Spirit one time and just feed
[1:14:12] upon that word and it would slowly push
[1:14:14] out the fruits of the spirit goodness
[1:14:18] gentleness peace loving kindness love
[1:14:22] mercy but not if you don't want that no
[1:14:26] more people want to be just an average
[1:14:27] Christian I don't want to be an average
[1:14:30] Christian that doesn't cook God never
[1:14:32] called anybody to be an average
[1:14:34] Christian but we come make ourselves
[1:14:36] average as a musicians come
[1:14:42] don't come tonight this thinking is a
[1:14:44] regular serve it's not a regular service
[1:14:47] you gotta take what God has given you
[1:14:50] God wants you to be great but you got to
[1:14:52] put in effort to be great not great to
[1:14:55] show off but a Holy Spirit I can
[1:14:57] demonstrate the great power of God in
[1:14:59] your life God is not calling us to be
[1:15:05] normal just because we have five people
[1:15:08] in church I don't care who we got in
[1:15:10] church if God is here that means God has
[1:15:12] something to do and if we can believe
[1:15:15] God anything is possible
[1:15:19] God can shake any situation he can
[1:15:22] change any problem but you got to
[1:15:24] believe in him
[1:15:26] you got to be willing that you're gonna
[1:15:28] make some sacrifices that you that you
[1:15:30] want a Holy Spirit to change you in a
[1:15:36] few minutes as we're closing please do
[1:15:38] not forget that what God gives you is
[1:15:40] not negotiable if God gave you children
[1:15:45] they are known non-negotiable don't
[1:15:49] allow the devil to have your children
[1:15:51] even if he got your children still claim
[1:15:53] them anyways because by faith whatever
[1:15:56] that you have has to come to pass even
[1:15:59] if your husband is not here your wife is
[1:16:02] not here and I'm not by faith that's
[1:16:04] you're claiming them into the church the
[1:16:08] church looks kind of empty tonight I
[1:16:09] don't matter who's here who's not
[1:16:11] whoever that you want to be here claim
[1:16:13] them by faith if they're not living
[1:16:15] right claim them by faith say god I'm
[1:16:17] not negotiating with the devil any
[1:16:19] longer by my brother by my sister by my
[1:16:21] spiritual life i Lord I don't I need to
[1:16:24] do better I need to do more lord help me
[1:16:27] I'm not giving the devil anymore rights
[1:16:29] I'm taking them back
[1:16:32] I'm taking back every promise that God
[1:16:35] it gives me I'm taking it back
[1:16:39] if you need money God listen God God has
[1:16:42] God is more than money if you need it
[1:16:45] just claiming God will give it to you if
[1:16:49] you need a house whatever that you need
[1:16:51] you need children you need a wife you
[1:16:52] need a husband yeah I can provide
[1:16:55] anything but you gotta believe it God is
[1:16:58] looking for believers and God only has
[1:17:00] believers only because only the
[1:17:03] believers can find a reward in God as we
[1:17:08] all stand take the time to consider now
[1:17:13] whatever that gate see is a revelation
[1:17:18] and there is nothing that God cannot do
[1:17:22] God can do anything as a child I the
[1:17:28] tumbler but it Brooks earlier I seen a
[1:17:30] dead child come back to life what my
[1:17:33] aunt why they say no history I seen it
[1:17:35] with my own two eyes I seen people young
[1:17:39] people living in the world and their
[1:17:41] lives changed

[1:17:48] not be afraid of any devil cuz I know
[1:17:49] God is with me
[1:17:51] I don't worry about when the devil can't
[1:17:54] do because I know what I can do with God
[1:17:56] [Music]

[1:18:01] but never more effort into your printer
[1:18:04] life to serve God more do better because
[1:18:10] it's time to get ready to go home but

[1:23:22] the things that really stood out in my
[1:23:24] heart and mind when God spoke and said
[1:23:27] you know we as people want the best of
[1:23:29] everything except when it comes to
[1:23:32] Christ and that is so true
[1:23:35] I was thinking about how when we go

[1:23:40] certain amount of money but we want the
[1:23:42] best of those cars whatever that money
[1:23:45] can purchase we want the best so we're
[1:23:47] just not gonna let the salesman give us
[1:23:49] any kind of thing we want the best of
[1:23:51] what we we can see in purchase and now
[1:23:54] we can come in Christ and we can you
[1:23:56] know we ought to desire to be the best
[1:23:59] of Christian that's what I pray for
[1:24:02] I believe this message with all our
[1:24:05] heart and I says God if there's not one
[1:24:08] person in this world the desire to see
[1:24:12] the message of Malikov will be made
[1:24:15] manifest and lived this is man this man

[1:25:00] message I I didn't write that down when

[1:25:05] of stuff there I got I was really messed
[1:25:06] up people
[1:25:07] y'all got a line I mean if I had the
[1:25:10] energy had to you
[1:25:13] and you guys gotta that's with those two
[1:25:16] fellas with those baby faces I say y'all

[1:25:22] I appreciate the Lord
[1:25:25] you know and something else I wanted to
[1:25:28] say let me tell you I was sobered and I
[1:25:30] wanted to go to Liberia I've never been
[1:25:33] there before I really wanted to go part
[1:25:35] of me did and part of me did not but the
[1:25:38] greater part of my heart wanted to go
[1:25:40] and I was just really concerned you know
[1:25:43] says Lord I said you know I want you're
[1:25:45] perfect in divine will
[1:25:47] you know God had to give me a witnessing
[1:25:49] because I couldn't sleep I was I was not
[1:25:51] sleeping for days on you know because I
[1:25:53] thought well if they shut it down if
[1:25:56] they quarantine it it's okay if it's the
[1:25:57] will of God you understand me because
[1:25:59] that's the way Peter was God said turn
[1:26:01] around Peter's time for you to could be
[1:26:03] crucified he went on in anyway and
[1:26:05] that's the way I was feeling even though
[1:26:07] I had to tell her brother you know I
[1:26:10] don't want to hear it nobody's opinion
[1:26:12] or what you're thinking I want to hear
[1:26:14] from God and it was God who gave me a
[1:26:17] witness not to go but if God would have
[1:26:20] told me to go brother I would have gone
[1:26:22] I still got the ticket I don't even know
[1:26:25] what I'm gonna do with it you know
[1:26:28] because I'm not afraid of anything even
[1:26:31] if I if it mean he said go and you're
[1:26:33] gonna be quarantined for 34 days
[1:26:34] even so as long as I'm in his arms
[1:26:37] that's all that matters people but I'll
[1:26:41] tell you one thing too and I'm not gonna
[1:26:43] prolong I see that we're tired
[1:26:45] we got here a little late I appreciate
[1:26:47] your effort I appreciate your coming
[1:26:48] supporting the young people and you know
[1:26:51] I like to be around young people because
[1:26:53] they keep me young amen and and I like
[1:26:57] the energy the energy is what I need you
[1:26:59] know and so I look at that and I wanna I
[1:27:03] want to say by God's grace we we are
[1:27:05] blessed people and we need to keep
[1:27:08] pushing and pressing on I expect great
[1:27:11] things I just do when young people I've
[1:27:13] seen God do it and you know when it
[1:27:16] comes to the will and the work word of
[1:27:18] God I want to see the Lord manifest and
[1:27:21] I really brother if we could follow the
[1:27:24] things that God said tonight see God is
[1:27:28] a God of a riot II I mean you know we
[1:27:30] don't have to we don't have to act like
[1:27:32] Hollywood in order to get the message
[1:27:33] over
[1:27:35] you know I believe it just like it is
[1:27:37] that's how Jesus preached just like that
[1:27:40] you know you know in me I get to
[1:27:43] screaming in Holland but that's not
[1:27:45] necessary as long as the words are
[1:27:47] coming floor and they are anointed and
[1:27:50] your heart is right
[1:27:52] see that's what what counts so but
[1:27:55] anyway we love the Lord it was something
[1:27:57] else I wanted to say but I can't
[1:27:58] remember what it is right now that comes
[1:28:00] with the age you know but I really take
[1:28:03] God seriously I really do keep where we
[1:28:11] are today and all of the things that's
[1:28:13] what I want to say thank you Jesus I
[1:28:14] don't know how this cool coronavirus is
[1:28:19] going to end up it's bad they say you
[1:28:24] know some of it could be politic
[1:28:27] political I don't know but I'll tell you
[1:28:30] what the Lord told me just the other day
[1:28:33] when I was in prayer the Lord told me
[1:28:36] when they come up with a vaccine don't
[1:28:39] take it that was just for me now why
[1:28:44] would God tell me that because the same
[1:28:48] God that told me not to take a flu shot
[1:28:51] it's the same God that tells me not that
[1:28:53] why we don't know what they put in in
[1:28:56] this stuff let God talk to you people
[1:29:00] this this look like a political thing
[1:29:02] I mean weak this thing could be moving
[1:29:04] right into the stock market crashed by
[1:29:07] the way it looking you understand me
[1:29:09] it looks bigger than what it is but if
[1:29:12] they put this thing out there so bad
[1:29:15] because now they're saying this thing is
[1:29:17] mutating I gotta let you know this they
[1:29:19] say it's mutating so what if it goes
[1:29:21] into a big old big old thing if it's
[1:29:23] real you don't mean like they say it is
[1:29:25] they won't have to force people to take
[1:29:28] the vaccine they'll run to the
[1:29:30] slaughterhouse like a you know people
[1:29:32] animals to the slaughter my point is the
[1:29:35] just shall live by faith
[1:29:37] we know America y'all better know
[1:29:39] America then give you some medicine or
[1:29:42] some injection and have you grown an
[1:29:44] extra arm
[1:29:47] trusting God y'all understand because we
[1:29:52] Tama that one world order and communica
[1:29:54] y'all know all these things I'm taking
[1:29:57] place let's say this is the time and you
[1:30:01] move into that thing like everybody else
[1:30:04] and this you know and I know this is
[1:30:06] just to me this is no brainer I know
[1:30:08] some people because they work in
[1:30:10] hospitals and and work in schools and
[1:30:11] stuff it's a mandatory thing they have
[1:30:13] to take shots but if you take a flu shot
[1:30:16] what are they giving you the flu Pisa
[1:30:24] I took a flu shot and then I caught the
[1:30:26] flu you took the flu shot you didn't
[1:30:30] catch it with your nose or your mouth
[1:30:31] you caught it by injection and sometimes
[1:30:34] it's worse then and I'm like okay I
[1:30:37] rarely get the flu I rarely get a cold
[1:30:39] right my point is God keeps me I don't
[1:30:44] need a shot to get a flu these are
[1:30:49] no-brainer that's what I caught this is
[1:30:51] a no-brainer so what I'm trying to say
[1:30:53] is if if this corona virus if they keep
[1:30:58] you a shock what the very thing you
[1:31:03] running from
[1:31:04] you can't take it your heart it makes no
[1:31:07] sense to me no keep it and if they make
[1:31:12] it mandatory then you know it's
[1:31:15] political you love the Lord amen the
[1:31:19] watchman is on the wall folks I'm
[1:31:21] watching everything I love the word rose
