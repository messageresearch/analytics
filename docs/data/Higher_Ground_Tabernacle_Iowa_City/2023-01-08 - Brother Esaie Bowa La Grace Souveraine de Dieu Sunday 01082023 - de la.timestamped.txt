[4:36] yes my brothers
[4:58] thank you
[5:45] Jesus Christ
[5:47] but I introduce you in the new year
[5:51] which is not a family that you used to
[5:53] be okay
[5:54] and in the family of the Lord Jesus
[5:56] Christ
[5:57] there's no failure in the family of the
[6:00] Lord Jesus Christ there's only success
[6:03] in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:06] we are in good health
[6:11] in Jesus family
[6:15] we don't have to put our hands on the
[6:17] cheek
[6:18] when you do this
[6:21] whom do you want to be uh sympathizing
[6:25] with you they are not your family in our
[6:28] family
[6:29] in this wire family
[6:36] [Applause]
[6:42] walking
[6:45] boldly
[6:47] because
[6:50] we are not slaves yes
[6:57] according to the uh to the instructions
[7:00] to be slave to the word of the to the
[7:02] things of the world
[7:04] but we're going to work we're gonna walk
[7:07] boldly sometimes feeling waiting for
[7:10] everything
[7:11] to do everything because our father in
[7:15] Heaven is able for everything
[7:19] I want you this morning that you
[7:22] understand
[7:23] the sovereign
[7:32] it's not because of your words
[7:35] I want you to take it out of your mind
[7:39] it's not because of your sacrifice
[7:42] but it's because of the love of God is
[7:45] because of the grace of God
[7:47] [Music]
[7:51] some Christian in the same situation
[7:55] some people were in the same situation
[7:58] so how come you came out of them
[8:01] how did you escape from those situations
[8:04] it's the grace of God it's a grace of
[8:08] God
[8:09] yes it's a grace of God
[8:12] the grace of God has made us what we are
[8:16] the grace of God has created Our Lives
[8:19] the grace of God and forgiven our sins
[8:23] the grace of God
[8:25] has given us marriage the grace of God
[8:29] it's giving us everything the grace of
[8:32] God
[8:33] has made us what we are today yes my
[8:36] brother sister that's why people
[8:40] you got something to be uh grateful to
[8:43] God
[8:51] the blood of an animal
[8:56] couldn't be perfect
[8:58] I want to say something so every day
[9:03] but I have to read what Brahman said
[9:05] here he said in the Lord
[9:10] paragraph 33 he says
[9:22] but the blood of Christ was perfect
[9:55] that's not where I am
[10:10] in the side of the Lord
[10:14] how much in the sight of God
[10:19] I'll never be perfect
[10:23] in my sight you will never be perfect
[10:26] let's put it aside
[10:30] how much more in the sight of God
[10:34] when I look at you
[10:36] man and see you as a human
[10:39] [Music]
[10:41] friend see you like your brother man
[10:47] God is looking looking at you through
[10:50] his son
[10:51] and
[10:54] sees you like you're redeemed foreign
[12:00] that's what is written the word of God
[12:04] but according to the Judgment of God
[12:07] he doesn't mean
[12:10] that we cannot do mistakes but God is
[12:14] prophesies
[12:20] or near anything like that
[12:42] to whom he wants to
[13:35] it's like you've never done it before
[13:38] remember but I compare about the problem
[13:41] you may have problem with you
[13:44] maybe you've hurt me you said
[13:48] you can ask him
[13:53] forgiveness and I can say I forgive you
[13:56] yeah
[13:57] and my mind
[14:01] every time I see this car
[14:04] I'll say this car is
[14:14] foreign
[14:38] and we don't have access to that
[14:46] for forgetting things
[14:50] that's why
[14:54] let me say it even in my language
[15:00] let us be nice to everyone
[15:03] let us avoid hearing each other yeah let
[15:07] us hurting each other for nothing
[15:09] just for little things
[15:11] of children
[15:14] let us let's put it aside
[15:17] kindergarten
[15:32] already
[15:58] just look when the children are playing
[16:00] in the garage
[16:02] all right this one is played with this
[16:04] toy
[16:24] just play together
[16:32] sometimes we are I don't know what to
[16:34] wear to you
[16:38] we're hearing that bill
[16:41] Christians are fighting for useless
[16:43] things
[16:44] they were telling me another story
[16:47] the the food
[16:50] we are very full there were two fools
[16:54] and one say to another okay
[16:57] as we go here
[17:01] if it happened that we found a hundred
[17:03] dollar somewhere okay see
[17:07] if we get that hundred dollars
[17:10] how much are you gonna take
[17:13] and how much am I gonna take Lindsay
[17:15] another one says no system
[17:17] if it's me who have seen it first
[17:20] I will take seventy dollars
[17:24] another one says
[17:31] [Music]
[17:35] they start fighting
[17:38] now people
[17:40] stop doing that stop fighting why are
[17:44] you fighting yes
[17:47] wait what's going on
[17:49] what's going on oh no
[17:54] we were telling each other if we see a
[17:57] hundred laying down
[17:59] if I'm the one to see it first
[18:02] even if he's the one who picked up
[18:08] and give me 30.
[18:14] that's what we're fighting for
[18:17] eign though
[18:25] that's children in the kindergarten
[18:29] there are things
[18:32] we don't even understanding what we're
[18:35] doing
[18:38] maybe we didn't get to understand
[18:43] we are in one family
[19:13] because God have raised your brother
[19:16] tomorrow
[19:23] is maybe to wait for your turn
[19:26] so why are we fine while we criticize
[19:30] each other because we want to have the
[19:33] same thing at the same time
[19:35] that's the cause of every description
[19:39] and what is destroying the church
[19:42] and that makes the church put it aside
[19:45] with my friends yes sir
[19:55] let's stop jealousy Among Us
[19:58] the church without the wrinkle or
[20:01] blemishes it's according to the Judgment
[20:04] of God himself
[20:18] but you keep on telling people
[20:21] and according to the Judgment of God
[20:25] God does not count that mistake again
[20:28] foreign
[21:14] basket
[21:17] s okay
[21:21] maybe you think it's about it's because
[21:24] of your Works
[21:26] no it's not because of your words
[21:52] everything that is in me bless the Lord
[21:56] forget
[22:01] all is good to me
[22:05] and it's him who's forgiving all my
[22:09] iniquities
[22:15] when you do something
[22:19] while you know that you shouldn't do it
[22:23] and God still forgiving that
[22:47] is fearful to forgive you about it
[22:52] not me
[22:57] beautiful pattern when you ask him for
[22:59] forgiveness
[23:01] he forgives
[23:05] the Lord is the one who heals all my
[23:06] sickness
[23:08] if God
[23:10] is with us
[23:13] yes his grace upon us
[23:16] and nothing can hurt us
[23:23] as long as the will of God is not yet
[23:25] fulfilled in our lives
[23:35] while we're going to the end
[23:39] what I'm saying
[23:43] no matter what you've done
[23:46] Journey
[23:48] God doesn't look at you
[23:52] he's looking
[23:55] and yes he has accepted the Lamborghini
[23:58] if God is accepted the Lamb of God which
[24:01] is the Lord Jesus
[24:03] accept us it means god is accepting us
[24:07] because it's not our problem
[24:12] we are the one we are not the one push
[24:16] ourselves
[24:18] I want to remind you that the scene was
[24:21] it the original plan of God God
[24:26] God is the one who made that decision
[24:30] if you came to see him
[24:33] that was according to the will of God
[24:37] according to the to the to the will of
[24:40] God
[24:41] so is God we have arranged all those
[24:44] things
[24:53] that's his problem yes
[25:00] I want to say something
[25:04] and I'm trying to see how I can say
[25:07] the grace of God today
[25:11] is
[25:19] a Prophet
[25:22] The Sovereign Grace of God today
[25:25] have raised William Brothers
[25:28] as a prophet of the end times
[25:32] he came with the word of God for this
[25:35] day
[25:36] to redeem the church
[25:39] to bring the church to its original
[25:42] position
[25:43] today
[26:06] is the greatest Prophet that God is
[26:10] raised by his grace
[26:13] God is send William Brothers
[26:32] that the name of Joshua means
[26:39] he was the Jehovah's Savior and I want
[26:43] to remind you again
[26:45] when he shared his blood
[26:48] he went in a holy place
[26:51] until
[26:54] they were still died in their sins
[27:00] and on the entire Earth why
[27:03] in other person there was nobody worried
[27:11] but when
[27:14] John was crying weeping he had a voice
[27:18] John never weep anymore because there
[27:22] the Lamb of God has overcome
[27:32] before the opening of the sales
[27:36] though this the blood has been shared
[27:39] by the national foreign
[27:51] so that the entire Humanity
[27:55] the humanity to be free completely
[28:03] Jehovah the Savior has to be manifested
[28:07] in the end time
