[16:34] [Applause]
[16:43] beloved Lord Jesus our savior.
[16:50] You the first and the last
[16:56] doesn't m in in trouble time.
[17:04] You never reject anyone who comes to
[17:06] you.
[17:12] Every time someone comes to you, you
[17:14] receive him with much love, Lord.
[17:19] You are always available to receive us,
[17:21] Lord.
[17:24] We are so proud to have a Lord and a
[17:27] father like Jesus Christ.
[17:29] The God who doesn't betray.
[17:34] The God who loved us before the
[17:36] foundation of the world.
[17:45] If the lion can for can't forget about
[17:49] his children,
[17:54] you'll never forget about your children.
[17:55] Lord,
[17:58] you always think about us every time.
[18:00] Lord,
[18:03] you are always busy for our good sake.
[18:05] Lord,
[18:09] you fighting for us even if we don't
[18:11] see.
[18:13] In the darknesses, you fighting for us,
[18:16] Lord.
[18:18] In the light, you always fight for us.
[18:21] [Music]
[18:23] Our life today is a great testimony,
[18:25] Lord.
[18:30] Many
[18:35] people, even the devil himself, he
[18:37] doesn't understand why we still alive.
[18:41] Because the way he fought against us,
[18:44] he thought that he was going to finish
[18:46] us, Lord.
[18:48] Glory be unto you.
[18:51] Cuz when he came to fight against us,
[18:55] you raise your standard, Lord.
[18:59] May you continue and fight for us.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Not for our our merit
[19:06] because we don't deserve it. Lord,
[19:10] &gt;&gt; that your grace may protect us.
[19:14] We came in this place just to pray.
[19:18] We got an appointment of coming in this
[19:20] place every Friday.
[19:22] We know that you are already in this
[19:24] place because
[19:27] we believe that your angels are
[19:31] your Holy Ghost is here with us Lord.
[19:35] We also believe that your anointing
[19:39] when I'll be speaking let it not be me
[19:41] Lord but it must be speaking to your
[19:45] children. What did what do I have to
[19:48] speak to your children? A little man
[19:50] like me. What can I tell your children?
[19:53] Beloved God,
[19:56] you don't use animals.
[19:58] You don't use things or trees, but you
[20:02] use
[20:04] because a man is a
[20:06] may use me in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:10] so that I can transmit little things to
[20:14] your children
[20:16] that will help them
[20:19] to get better, Lord.
[20:22] counting on your grace in everything.
[20:24] Bless the time we're going to spend
[20:26] together.
[20:27] Be with us from the beginning to the end
[20:30] for your own glory and for in the name
[20:33] of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; We saying amen.
[20:37] May the Lord richly bless you.
[20:44] I don't understand today. I'm so
[20:45] emotional
[20:48] since morning. I got some emotions.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[20:56] we going to read where we read last.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 26.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 2 verse 26.
[21:39] And he that overcomemeth and keep it
[21:43] keep kept my works unto the and to him I
[21:46] will give power over the nations.
[21:53] and also in in the book of Revelation
[21:55] chapter 3 verse 12.
[22:22] No,
[22:23] him that overcomemeth, I will make a
[22:25] pillar
[22:27] in the temple of my God, and he sh and
[22:31] he shall go no more out, and I will
[22:34] write upon him the name of my God, and
[22:37] the name of the city of my God, which is
[22:40] New Jerusalem,
[22:42] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[22:45] God, and I will write upon him my new
[22:48] name.
[22:53] Add a blessing to the reading of this
[22:54] word. We may be
[22:58] not going to be long tonight,
[23:03] but we talk about the same subject we
[23:05] spoke last Friday
[23:08] about how to overcome
[23:16] Because we see that in the Bible there's
[23:17] many blessings
[23:21] but the blessings of God
[23:23] they are for those who overcome.
[23:29] If we talk about overcomers
[23:32] before talking about overcomers or
[23:34] victories,
[23:38] we are obligated to talk about the fight
[23:44] if you don't talk about the battle. How
[23:45] how we going to have victory?
[23:49] If you are victorious,
[23:52] which means you overcome the fight,
[23:56] you won the fight, you won the battle,
[23:58] you won something, then you are vic
[24:01] victorious.
[24:04] Uh the fight that we're talking about,
[24:07] it's a spiritual battle.
[24:10] It's not a carnal battle.
[24:14] Muslim people don't understand it.
[24:17] Their prophet didn't understand it
[24:20] that they fight that the battle the
[24:23] spiritual battle they never understand.
[24:26] That's why
[24:28] they train militaries people who are
[24:30] bombing others.
[24:34] They thought they're going to kill Satan
[24:36] with bombs.
[24:39] But if he was spiritual enough,
[24:43] he would understand that it's the devil
[24:45] who's using him to bomb out.
[24:48] But he think he's doing the holy fire.
[24:52] That's not a holy battle.
[24:55] That's the curse battle.
[24:58] It's not a good battle.
[25:02] We don't attack people. We don't fight
[25:04] people.
[25:06] We're not fighting against the flesh,
[25:10] but we are fighting against spirits.
[25:14] So to fight against those spirit,
[25:17] you ought to have those spiritual
[25:19] weapons
[25:22] to get where demons are.
[25:25] You should know what kind of weapon to
[25:27] use. Demons are spirit.
[25:31] Even angels, they also spirit.
[25:34] The devil himself is a spirit.
[25:37] God also is a spirit.
[25:41] So if you want to fight demons,
[25:46] &gt;&gt; we should use spiritual weapons.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; So spiritual weapons, we've seen them
[25:55] last Friday
[25:58] that God gave us two weapons
[26:02] &gt;&gt; that never fail.
[26:05] Amen.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; So God gave us an example of the
[26:11] weakness
[26:14] because he himself have used one of
[26:16] those weapons
[26:18] and he became victorious at the end.
[26:22] He used the word of God
[26:26] and also the prayer.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; So when the devil came
[26:32] with the It it has been written.
[26:38] The Lord responded to him. It's also
[26:41] written.
[26:43] And the Lord went won the battle with
[26:46] the word of God.
[26:49] So when the devil came to take his life
[26:51] away,
[26:53] the Lord won the battle by praying.
[26:57] He prayed day and night.
[27:00] He fasted.
[27:03] He prayed,
[27:05] &gt;&gt; he fasted and he prayed.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; So at the end
[27:11] he came out victorious.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; So how can I overcome?
[27:20] So you should know how to fight or fight
[27:22] according to the rules.
[27:24] How should how would I overcome?
[27:29] You should overcome.
[27:33] by imitating the person who have
[27:35] overcome so far.
[27:38] We've given an example last time.
[27:51] Like when they are they giving us a test
[27:53] of math,
[27:57] our knows how to get to the right
[28:00] answer,
[28:02] but it doesn't show you that thing. He's
[28:06] hiding it. Why is he hiding the way to
[28:09] get to the answer? Because he want you
[28:10] to fail. He want to be the first,
[28:15] but he want you to be the last.
[28:17] But at the end of every
[28:21] you will see that the person who knows
[28:23] all the formulas of math
[28:26] is the one who's asking you $100.
[28:29] The one who knows all the math, all the
[28:31] formulas, everything.
[28:34] He thought in his mind that he was more
[28:36] than you. But in a practical life
[28:40] is now seeing you above everything.
[28:45] That's the uh that that's the mouth of
[28:47] God.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't depend to the person who want
[28:52] or neither to the person who want
[28:55] neither to the person who intelligent
[28:58] but all depends to God who does mercy to
[29:01] whoever he want to.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; But we've got the Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; He overcome the devil.
[29:15] And he didn't hide from us the formula
[29:17] to get a victory.
[29:20] He show unto us the formula to get
[29:24] to show us that he's a good friend.
[29:27] He never hide it from us. He's like
[29:30] Peter, you know,
[29:32] Peter,
[29:38] he he wanted to fish.
[29:41] He went fishing the whole night
[29:44] and he got nothing.
[29:49] But one day he met the Lord and the Lord
[29:52] asked him.
[29:54] Just put back the net in the water where
[29:57] you were fishing the last night. He
[29:59] said, "No, no, Lord. I know this place.
[30:03] I've been fishing the whole night
[30:06] and you know it's at night that we're
[30:08] getting more fishes.
[30:11] fishes are getting caught at night.
[30:14] He said, "It's not all all about us, but
[30:17] just listen to my voice.
[30:20] Put back your net in the waters."
[30:23] So Peter understood. He said, "For me, I
[30:25] couldn't do it
[30:28] for your for for your word.
[30:31] I'll put my net back in waters." So when
[30:35] he put his net in waters
[30:38] &gt;&gt; and the the net were sinking on the same
[30:41] place
[30:45] just because he trusted the word of God
[30:49] and he found more blessing that he have
[30:52] been seeking there all night.
[30:54] So when he got blessings,
[30:58] the first thing he have done,
[31:02] he knew that other people were in
[31:03] trouble. So he start calling his
[31:05] friends. Oh, Andrew, come over.
[31:09] Then he start calling other people
[31:11] through his blessings.
[31:15] That's that's the personal blessing.
[31:17] That's what the Lord have done. He
[31:20] didn't hide from us the formula to get
[31:22] to victory.
[31:25] show to us. If you want to win, if you
[31:28] want to overcome, this is what you have
[31:29] to do.
[31:34] But there are many people when they are
[31:36] blessed, they're hiding the formula to
[31:38] get
[31:40] they hiding the way to get
[31:44] you see as we got in this place.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; If God just bless one person,
[31:53] He has already blessed all of us. Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; He has already blessed all of us
[32:04] &gt;&gt; because God,
[32:08] he will ever come down
[32:12] and start giving us connection of work,
[32:15] the business connections and stuff. But
[32:18] God is going to use brother John. He
[32:21] said, "Listen,
[32:23] in what I'm doing, I'm already blessed.
[32:26] See how you're going to get blessed as
[32:28] well. So, he's calling someone else
[32:32] and that person call another one as well
[32:35] until everybody's blessed.
[32:39] That's how God is doing his things.
[32:42] So, a man is an action of God. So, we
[32:45] here to complete each other.
[32:48] We here because we are the family.
[32:51] And because we are a family,
[32:54] we should think about what is happening
[32:55] on the other side. You see, you know how
[32:58] it's happening in the family
[33:01] in a in a good family.
[33:05] So I I'm eating well. I've got no
[33:07] problem.
[33:08] There's food every time on my table.
[33:12] But I want to know
[33:14] my little sister.
[33:16] Did she eat as well?
[33:21] &gt;&gt; So I'm worried about her but
[33:26] the work God is doing with 10 children.
[33:29] Are they going to do it well?
[33:31] So why do I do I want to know about it?
[33:35] My children are for
[33:38] why am I worried about them? my cousins,
[33:41] my my my uncles, children, and a lot of
[33:45] people.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; That's a that's a a blood affair.
[33:51] And the blood that unite us today
[33:55] is the blood of the lamb himself
[33:59] stronger than the blood of our families.
[34:03] I'm assuring you the blood of the lamb.
[34:07] The blood that have saved us is not any
[34:09] other blood.
[34:12] We should be worried about what is
[34:14] happening to other brothers. If the
[34:16] brother is moving forward or not,
[34:19] they inform me about something.
[34:22] I was so happy about it.
[34:26] And I believe it's a testimony I will
[34:28] give.
[34:30] There's a the sisters in Johannesburg.
[34:35] We talk about good things.
[34:38] every time. Oh, sisters are doing this
[34:40] and that.
[34:42] When sisters are doing good things, we
[34:45] should talk about it.
[34:48] Good testimony. Cuz if you talk about
[34:50] the wrong things, you are the mockery.
[34:53] Your place is not here. If there's
[34:55] something good to talk about, we should
[34:57] encourage it.
[35:02] Sisters in Johannesburg is not like
[35:03] here.
[35:05] There's many churches in Johannesburg
[35:08] there and there.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; So once she was inspired,
[35:14] &gt;&gt; she created a group, a WhatsApp group,
[35:20] she connected all the sisters in those
[35:22] who are interested.
[35:26] So we are in this country as foreigners.
[35:30] So we we we we notice that when we got
[35:33] problems
[35:35] And we we are on our own
[35:44] instead of waiting for the the
[35:45] government service doesn't even allow
[35:47] us. We don't haveh insurance.
[35:53] We should do something.
[35:56] We will start putting money.
[36:00] If there's someone who's in trouble,
[36:04] or maybe a sister's in trouble with
[36:05] children. We're going to support her.
[36:09] And I'm assuring you
[36:14] the report about that sister.
[36:18] Uh there's a little young brother of
[36:20] mine who died in Jerusalem.
[36:25] So sisters put their money together
[36:27] about 50,000 ring and it's not easy.
[36:32] is those sisters who are selling
[36:35] their husband are doing security stuff.
[36:41] So I understood that it's just a
[36:43] question of willing.
[36:47] So they gave to that of my young brother
[36:51] around 50,000 rand.
[36:53] Then I said let God bless sisters in
[36:56] China.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:02] sister from Jonasburg. May God bless you
[37:05] one day. If you if you come to this
[37:07] video,
[37:09] we praying for you and we encouraging
[37:11] you.
[37:12] Let other sisters behed
[37:16] by the same spirit.
[37:18] Let it go around. It's a good thing that
[37:21] you've done. May the Lord bless you.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; So we also said
[37:31] We should know the techniques of our
[37:33] enemy,
[37:35] the techniques of our enemy.
[37:38] If we don't know them,
[37:40] he's going to overcome on us.
[37:43] So how do we know his techniques
[37:46] is by searching in ourselves
[37:49] is searching in ourselves
[37:53] is by doing the inventory to know from
[37:55] where he's attacking us.
[38:00] is by doing the
[38:03] know where we are strong and where we
[38:05] are weak.
[38:07] You should know it
[38:09] where you are strong
[38:11] or where you are weak.
[38:14] So if you know that
[38:17] you are tempted by the act
[38:20] and you always around the nightclub you
[38:25] you go to nightclubs just take a
[38:29] If you know that you are with someone,
[38:32] you should start by running from
[38:33] nightmares
[38:35] because you know already yourself.
[38:39] Another
[38:41] philosopher.
[38:46] Okay. Okay.
[38:50] You should know yourself. You ought to
[38:52] know yourself.
[38:56] You ought to know how how you working
[39:00] the devil's techniques. Do you know how
[39:02] that is?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; He will just show you the sickness of I
[39:06] mean the the sin of other people.
[39:09] That other person is wrong. The other
[39:12] one is wrong.
[39:15] You see the other one on the other side
[39:17] is wrong.
[39:20] is showing you that other people
[39:23] yourself
[39:26] you are full of all demons but you don't
[39:28] see it
[39:30] you only see the mistakes of Christ but
[39:33] Jesus said unto the person you are
[39:35] hypocrite
[39:38] just remove the piece of wood in your
[39:40] eyes
[39:42] you to remove the the piece of wood in
[39:44] the eye of so if you know that you are
[39:48] not in order
[39:51] You should start by fixing them.
[39:54] That's how we start the victory.
[39:59] So you start your victory by recognizing
[40:01] your own mistakes.
[40:03] That's where you start.
[40:06] You start looking at yourself
[40:10] before looking at others
[40:12] because the word of God
[40:15] is a mirror that God has placed before
[40:17] each one of us. And that mirror
[40:22] has to show you your own mistakes.
[40:25] When you look in the mirror, you see
[40:26] yourself in your comparison to the word
[40:28] of God. Am I agreeing with the word of
[40:31] God before you see other people's
[40:34] mistakes?
[40:36] So you should see your own mistakes. So
[40:38] victory starts from there. Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] So we going to add on something else
[40:53] &gt;&gt; about the uh the battlefield.
[40:58] I believe I believe we've already
[40:59] started that
[41:04] just in few minutes we'll be done.
[41:13] the front line or the the the the battle
[41:16] line.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; So the devil is attacking from two uh
[41:24] two two front line.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] The first battle line of the devil,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; it's your own, your eye,
[41:40] &gt;&gt; your free moral agency.
[41:46] So your free moral agency is the spirit
[41:48] that you receive from your birth
[41:52] is the world spirit.
[41:57] And I'm telling you that is the best
[41:59] spirit that you getting in this world
[42:00] when we when we born.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; So it's your eye, your free agency.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; And that free agency is based upon uh uh
[42:12] uh selfishness.
[42:15] It's it's on your selfishness.
[42:22] Everything which is good,
[42:24] &gt;&gt; you want it to be yours.
[42:28] Everything that is good upon the earth,
[42:31] you want it to be yours.
[42:35] Everyone should do your own.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Now listen to the prayer.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Our heaven, our heavenly father.
[42:45] May your name be glorified.
[42:48] May your will be done on the earth
[42:52] as it done in heaven.
[43:02] So the will of God which is done in
[43:04] heaven should be done also on your
[43:05] flesh.
[43:08] Why Jesus has said that to us?
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus knew
[43:14] &gt;&gt; the earth and and and heaven
[43:18] They are they in opposition
[43:22] &gt;&gt; but he want this
[43:26] &gt;&gt; but he want the will that is done in
[43:28] heaven should be done upon the earth
[43:32] because on the earth there's opposition
[43:34] Paul said
[43:39] the good that I want to do
[43:41] I don't get to do it
[43:44] &gt;&gt; but the evil that I don't want to
[43:47] is attached to my flesh.
[43:53] So we are living in a permanent fight
[43:59] &gt;&gt; and we should win that battle
[44:02] &gt;&gt; because
[44:05] in this spiritual fight.
[44:10] There's no win-win.
[44:14] You know in soccer or in football they
[44:17] will say no it's a win-win.
[44:20] In this fight there's no win-win.
[44:23] Either you are overcomer
[44:25] or you are a loser
[44:28] cuz your enemy comes
[44:31] to kill and to slay. That's what the
[44:33] devil is coming to do.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; So you should kill your enemy and you
[44:38] should slay your enemy. If you don't
[44:41] kill your enemy, he's the one who's
[44:42] going to kill you.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; So your free agency is our great enemy.
[44:52] your I or your free moral agency is your
[44:55] first husband
[44:58] is the one we under his power when we
[45:00] are born we are we are under his control
[45:05] everything that we want is for our ego
[45:08] even when I come to preach
[45:11] if I don't preach for Jesus
[45:14] you know am I preaching for who I'm
[45:17] preaching for myself if it's not for
[45:19] Jesus that I'm preaching
[45:21] which means I'll be preaching for myself
[45:23] so that I can show to people that I'm a
[45:25] great I'm a Dr. John
[45:28] the best preacher in
[45:33] that's the ego that has to be tonight
[45:38] because God has to find his portion in
[45:40] everything that we do. God has to be
[45:42] glorified in everything that we do.
[45:45] When you go to work, yes, you're going
[45:47] to work.
[45:49] Has God found his account in your work?
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm bringing up my children.
[45:57] Does God find his portion in everything
[45:59] that you do?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; I bought a new car.
[46:04] Does God? Does God find his glory in
[46:07] everything that you do?
[46:10] Or I bought my clothes.
[46:13] Does God has his portion?
[46:18] or you just want to dress up and show
[46:20] that you are the one who knows how to
[46:21] dress up.
[46:23] So that is based upon your ego that is
[46:25] to die. When we dress up, we dress up
[46:28] for the Lord.
[46:30] When we buy our cars, our cars are for
[46:33] the Lord.
[46:35] When we buy our homes and our home are
[46:38] for the Lord
[46:41] and the purpose why we are in this world
[46:43] is to glorify our Lord.
[46:47] So glorify him in our life to glorify
[46:49] our Lord in our work to glorify him in
[46:52] our home to glorify him everything in
[46:56] our in our marriage in everything that
[47:00] we are. We dare to glorify the Lord.
[47:06] We don't want to we don't want to take
[47:07] the glory of our Lord.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; We want his glory to be unto him.
[47:15] So when you you leave for yourself, for
[47:18] your own eye, for your own ego, for for
[47:22] your own glory that you live,
[47:26] it means you're going to die for your
[47:28] own sake.
[47:31] And when you die for your own sake,
[47:32] who's going to raise you up? Who's going
[47:34] to bring you back to life? Because you
[47:36] live for yourself.
[47:38] Everything that you've done, you've done
[47:40] it for your own sake, for your own
[47:41] glory. So that people may know that it's
[47:44] only you. And at the end when you die,
[47:49] you'll never come back to life.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; You will die forever.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Uh Job
[47:58] one day.
[48:02] He was in trouble when he noticed
[48:03] something. He said, "Oh,
[48:07] &gt;&gt; the tree when it dies,
[48:11] &gt;&gt; it comes back to life.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; But when a man dies,
[48:17] &gt;&gt; he dies for good.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Then he saw the resurrection
[48:23] until he said,
[48:25] "My redeemer lives."
[48:28] He saw the resurrection.
[48:32] The person who who's going to resurrect
[48:34] it
[48:36] &gt;&gt; is the person who lives for God.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; So if you live for God,
[48:43] then God will bring you back to life.
[48:46] And whoever live for God
[48:50] is the person who killed his ego.
[48:53] So when we saying that we're victorious,
[48:57] it means we have killed our ego.
[49:01] We have killed our first husband.
[49:07] There's no way we can be married to
[49:09] boss.
[49:11] If our first husband is still alive,
[49:16] our our master knows the word of God.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; He want to check out.
[49:22] Oh Naomi, you came with Ruth, right? So
[49:25] where is her husband?
[49:28] Her husband died.
[49:32] When I found out,
[49:35] want to find out if really the the
[49:38] husband of Ruth is is dead.
[49:41] If we confirm that he's dead,
[49:45] then Boas can get married to us.
[49:51] So Boas can can't get married to a
[49:53] person who's still alive, who still
[49:55] having his own ego.
[49:58] So what is happen when you win the war?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; To win the battle is to kill your own
[50:04] ego.
[50:07] So once you kill your own ego,
[50:12] &gt;&gt; what is coming automatically after
[50:15] is the new birth
[50:18] is a new spirit that comes to you.
[50:23] The trees can be dead
[50:26] and the tree can come back to life
[50:29] because the tree doesn't live for
[50:31] itself.
[50:32] But do you know that right?
[50:35] The Lord God never live for himself.
[50:40] That's why he couldn't die forever.
[50:42] He should raise up.
[50:45] He was using his power for others.
[50:48] He was killing sick people.
[50:51] So when they came to kill him,
[50:54] he had all the powers. He never used
[50:57] that power for himself.
[50:59] Then God saw that from heaven.
[51:03] He said, "I will enter myself. I'll come
[51:06] down myself in the fall." Then he rose
[51:09] my the Lord from death.
[51:12] Trees can die and come back to life
[51:16] because trees don't live for themselves.
[51:20] Uh the mango tree,
[51:22] they don't eat their own mangoes.
[51:28] It's other people that comes and eat the
[51:29] mangoes.
[51:31] So the mango tree lives for others for
[51:35] the entire life. It doesn't need to
[51:36] complain about it its own mangoes.
[51:40] It problem is just produce more mangoes
[51:43] and other people are coming to eat from
[51:44] it.
[51:46] So a person who lived like that
[51:49] and got right to resurrection
[51:53] because the universal uh goodness
[51:56] is to live for others
[51:59] and the only way to live in that way
[52:04] is when you get to the point of killing
[52:06] your own ego. So your ego should die.
[52:10] There's only one way to get to eternal
[52:12] life and that way is the death in
[52:17] yourself.
[52:19] The first husband should die.
[52:22] The first husband that we received when
[52:24] we came in this world, he has to die.
[52:28] So once that husband died,
[52:31] then we can get a new husband.
[52:34] The new husband which is the Lord Jesus
[52:35] Christ, he can come and rule on us.
[52:41] because he's the one who win your soul
[52:44] who's going to rule on you.
[52:47] If it's your ego that win your soul,
[52:49] then you are controlled by your own
[52:51] will. But if it's the Lord Jesus that
[52:54] own your soul, he is the one who's
[52:56] controlling your soul. Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] So we ought to understand that
[53:03] that's the way to eternal life.
[53:06] So we ought to overcome this fight.
[53:10] And it's possible to win the battle
[53:14] because they've already shows us the
[53:15] process to win the battle.
[53:18] We ought to fight by faith. And Paul
[53:21] taught us.
[53:23] Let us fight a good fight
[53:26] by keeping our faith
[53:30] and good conscience
[53:32] that others have lost.
[53:36] But we didn't lose our faith.
[53:39] And we didn't lose our conscience.
[53:42] We continuing to believe in victory.
[53:45] We also continuing to believe in the
[53:48] victorious God.
[53:50] We continue to believe in a overcome
[53:54] promises
[53:55] and we believe that everything that you
[53:57] say it will come to happen
[54:00] because he said as I overcome you as
[54:03] well you should overcome.
[54:05] It's him who promised to us the victory
[54:08] and he has already given to us because
[54:10] we're not fighting by ourselves.
[54:13] But we fighting with him.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; There's also external enemies.
[54:28] So the external enemies that the weakest
[54:30] ones
[54:34] they are weak if you've already warn the
[54:37] enemies the insiders
[54:41] &gt;&gt; oh let's say brother John
[54:44] if I want to come to your place
[54:48] while you're sleeping
[54:51] &gt;&gt; and I want to get something from your
[54:52] home I want to sneak
[54:57] Get your baby card. Thank God. I will
[55:00] never know it
[55:03] because I'm from outside
[55:06] to start. It will be hard for me to get
[55:08] into your house.
[55:11] I will have trouble to get into your
[55:12] house.
[55:14] Just because I'm from an outsider,
[55:17] [Music]
[55:18] but if I've got someone inside your home
[55:21] who lives with you,
[55:23] who knows when you are sleeping,
[55:25] Who knows when you are weak?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Then tell me to come over
[55:32] because you're sleeping.
[55:35] If that person tell me everything,
[55:38] then I've got a possibility to come and
[55:40] do wrong
[55:42] because I've got someone from inside
[55:44] who's in connection with me.
[55:51] That's the ego, the eye that is which is
[55:54] in connection with us who's inviting
[55:57] them to attack us.
[55:59] So external enemies, they are weak.
[56:03] They are witches.
[56:05] They magicians.
[56:08] You should know something.
[56:14] You know the devil has also his own
[56:15] government.
[56:17] He has his own government.
[56:19] Devil has his government.
[56:22] Brother taught us that everywhere you go
[56:26] in every city,
[56:28] every city has its own demons, has its
[56:31] own spirit. That's what us. So the devil
[56:34] is organized that way. He has also its
[56:37] own meetings.
[56:39] By example, you will find
[56:43] in the spiritual world,
[56:47] you see in this area,
[56:51] they told me about I don't know if
[56:55] I'm I'm I'm saying it according to the
[56:57] to the court from the prophet you found
[57:01] somebody
[57:02] I don't know a magicians or avenue
[57:06] for this for this avenue.
[57:10] No girl.
[57:12] So they do meetings like that and you
[57:15] don't know about it and me also I don't
[57:17] know about while we are sleeping
[57:21] they organizing a meeting and they
[57:24] saying in this avenue church nobody will
[57:27] get married.
[57:29] We only notice that girls don't get
[57:32] married in on our avenue.
[57:36] is only an old woman
[57:41] don't get married on this avenue because
[57:43] we decided
[57:45] they decided in their word but I'm
[57:48] following you those people are so weak
[57:54] if we have already overcome our ego
[57:59] the ego which is always attached
[58:02] knows our weaknesses
[58:04] if we overcome our ego
[58:07] outside the enemies are so weak.
[58:12] We should overcome them every time.
[58:15] They may come at night or daylight
[58:19] because it's not even us that are
[58:20] fighting.
[58:22] It's our Lord who's fighting.
[58:26] outside enemies are weak
[58:29] and the Lord has already overcome them
[58:30] for us because the victory is in the
[58:34] blood.
[58:35] The victory is in the blood
[58:38] and the one who got the victory.
[58:42] He never hide from us the formula.
[58:46] He never hide from us
[58:49] because his life was not in the ego.
[58:53] He lived for others.
[58:56] Even when he got a victory, he went
[58:58] above
[58:59] and he shares his victory with us.
[59:03] But I'm telling you, each one of us
[59:08] is able to get the victory
[59:12] and to keep our victory on
[59:15] because winning is one thing
[59:19] &gt;&gt; and keeping the victory is another part.
[59:23] You know, every time you win a battle,
[59:27] when the devil leaves, that's what the
[59:28] Bible says.
[59:30] He will come back and see what has
[59:32] happened in your home.
[59:34] If the house is clean and protected,
[59:39] he will never come back. But if he found
[59:41] a struggle in your home, he will call
[59:44] other demons
[59:45] to come and fight against you.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says
[59:51] the condition of that person
[59:54] who become more worse than the first
[59:56] condition.
[59:58] But we believe
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; that we got bit we got victory
[1:00:03] because we are the children of victory.
[1:00:06] We will overcome the devil in
[1:00:10] we will overcome in
[1:00:13] overcome.
[1:00:16] There's no way that the the devil can
[1:00:17] win upon us
[1:00:20] because the victorious has shared his
[1:00:23] victory with us and the victory is our
[1:00:25] promise.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; The victory is our promise.
[1:00:34] But there something that I want to add
[1:00:35] on before I close.
[1:00:40] Everything that happened to us on our
[1:00:42] way on
[1:00:46] It's not always the devil attack.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to do the the
[1:00:53] inventory.
[1:00:56] When something happened to you on your
[1:00:58] way or an opposition
[1:01:02] or a fight,
[1:01:04] the good thing,
[1:01:06] you should check first.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Whom did you offended?
[1:01:12] Did you offend somebody?
[1:01:15] Then you check.
[1:01:17] I got no problem with with brothers. I
[1:01:20] got no problem with someone.
[1:01:22] So you look into the word of God.
[1:01:26] Where did I step on the word of God? You
[1:01:29] check that.
[1:01:31] You found that you never offended the
[1:01:33] word of God.
[1:01:36] So once you say,
[1:01:40] you should understand that that's a test
[1:01:41] from your God.
[1:01:45] Because the Lord is training us in a
[1:01:47] fight.
[1:01:49] It's in the in the fight that we are we
[1:01:52] train.
[1:01:54] The trials are are so precious for us.
[1:01:57] It's more than gold
[1:01:59] because after all,
[1:02:02] for us to become overcomers, we should
[1:02:05] fight first.
[1:02:09] Uh it's like the the prophet is
[1:02:11] explaining it to the eagles of God. When
[1:02:14] eagles have got his own on little ones,
[1:02:17] he blesses the soft things in the nest.
[1:02:22] He plac the soft things in the nest to
[1:02:23] protect his little ones. As long as
[1:02:26] those little ones are growing up, he
[1:02:29] start removing
[1:02:31] the soft stuff in the nest. He start
[1:02:33] removing them. At a certain point,
[1:02:38] the knees to become substantial
[1:02:42] and they start having some spike.
[1:02:45] What is that? What's the ego trying to
[1:02:47] get?
[1:02:49] He want those little ones to fly.
[1:02:53] Because the ego is not meant to stay in
[1:02:56] the midst. He's not meant to live
[1:02:58] anywhere. The eagle has to fly up.
[1:03:02] But if he's comfortable where he's
[1:03:03] sleeping, there's no way that he can
[1:03:05] fly. That's why. So God is is starting
[1:03:10] to remove the comfort so that you can be
[1:03:12] in trouble.
[1:03:14] But it's not for you to die.
[1:03:17] But every time that you fly
[1:03:19] on when you want to fall down, the
[1:03:22] mother is always around to to protect
[1:03:25] you
[1:03:28] so that your feet doesn't hit against
[1:03:30] you.
[1:03:32] That's what our master is doing.
[1:03:36] We got our promise. It's called victory.
[1:03:41] The promise that God gave unto us, it's
[1:03:43] called victory.
[1:03:45] Either the enemy is eternal or is
[1:03:48] external.
[1:03:51] Our promise is to overcome on him. Amen.
[1:03:53] Amen.
[1:03:56] May the Lord bless his word.
