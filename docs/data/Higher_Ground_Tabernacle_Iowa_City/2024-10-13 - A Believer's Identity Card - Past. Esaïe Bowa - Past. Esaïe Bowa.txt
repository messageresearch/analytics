know that I don't live around here no more and that now I live in Nebraska it's not a secret everybody know it only reason why I came late and may you forgive me one more time we're going to open our Bibles in The Book of Mark 16 verse 14 to [Music] 20 afterwards as they lay at the table he was manifested to the 11 and reproached them with their unbelief and hardness of their heart because they had not believed those who had seen him risen and he said to them go into all the word and preach the Glad Tidings to all the creation he that believes and he his baptized shall be saved and he that be disbelieves shall be condemned and this sign shall follow those that believed in my name they shall cast out demons they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up Serpent and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them they shall lay L upon the infer and they shall be well the Lord therefore after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God and they going forth going forth preach everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs following upon it we pray Our Father God as we approaching to you with the word we just read you're the best interpreter of your own word come and translate this word to us we want your presence to be real among us to take this word and give us the bread of life that in it because we know that we're living through it forgive us sin and forgive us uh transgressions forgive our laziness we want to give you this moment unto your hands May the Holy Spirit the the best teacher come and teach his word to his children as we surrend ourselves unto you in Jesus Christ Our God amen amen uh I would like to start say something to the church that some of reason that made me leave this area I believe I spoke with the deacons we had a conversation [Music] and I had some reason that made me leave you and go to the other side and I promise to be here every day of service but it happened for the service on Wednesday since I'm very far away I will not be able to be here on Wednesday and all that we spoke with the deacons the pastor know knows it he is your pastor he's also my pastor and he knows everything that's going on here and he will be here next Sunday to preach so don't worry everything is under the pastors so I couldn't stop myself come and preach because it was one of my promises but when it comes to uh the Wednesday service the pastor suggest that y can listen to the tape either listen to the de service if there's any servant of God to preach that's not a problem amen amen okay for this morning we will speak about 30 or 40 minutes we we will speak about the identity card of a Believer the identity card of a believer because you know today in the entire world to do something we have to be identified to go to the Army go to univers to do whatever else we have to be identified is that true is a very important thing especially in the world in which we living so Charles brother Charles read Mark verse 14 to 20 I want to reread the verse 1 it says and these are the signs that shall follow those that are that have believed in my name they shall cast our demons they shall speak with new tongues amen amen and in French he says we have to interpret it that means in this sign we will will recognize or known who those who believe so if you have there there are signs that have to identify in this sign there we recognize those who have believed there is an [Music] identification it's an identification C of it is certified for a so those Miracles gathers the Bible these are the sign that shall follows those who have believed and many time the church has it was only about the preacher but these scriptures not only concerns the preacher a preacher is a believer before him to be a preacher he's got to be a he's got to identify himself as a True Believer even the one listening to the word he is a [Music] Believer the same range as the the preacher that's why Jesus say these are signs shall follow those have who Jesus didn't these are the same that shall follow the preacher he these are the sign that shall follow who has belied if somebody claims to be a the signs has to follow anybody that claims to be a got to be signed to identify him as a Believer so believer doesn't come by your you don't identify by yourself by it but there are signs that has to follow you has to confirm you as a Believer so to saying claiming that you're a Believer it's not enough but if you are believer the signs has to follow I know we spoke about long time ago the spirit bringing back to it now hear this there are signs and wonders as Jesus said these are signs that shall follow those who have beli in my name they shall cast out demons if they drink any any any deadly thing shall not inure them we work upon the we land their hands upon the and they shall be well here's the card of identity if you are that sign have to follow you but before that sign to accomp before these wonders and miracles to be fulfilled in your life you're not a Believer that's what it means so those signs and wonders they strengthens the the uh the engagement of who those who preaches and those who listen to the word because the one who is preaching the preacher he has to be followed by sign and the one listening it has to be followed by those signs yes my brothers and sisters now hear what the prophet in the confirmation of the commission sayag 22 19 and I think if you go down the street somewhere there at your job somebody approaches you and say I'm a commissioner of the police of the United States it's under this quality that I'm arresting [Music] you say you will have the right to say to that man if you look at him he's in uniform he's wearing his badge that therefore that doesn't make him a it's not the fact that he's wearing a bad makes him officer officer of the United States say anybody can wear that that badge you can buy you you can buy a BGE to store a store you can go to good and buy you a you can go to and get you a uniform or anything else brother that doesn't make him an officer of United States even if he has a b and wearing a unifor making him a [Music] officer for him to Iden he's got to hold that ification card to affirm his declaration that he is a officer of United States says otherwise he's nothing as long as that he's not confirmed he has confirmed his commission he does it by by De to confirm that he's an agent his commission has been sealed by the United States of America that's why when you look at your it see there's a seal of the there's a token on your and that's that's what makes but insist says for him wearing a badge or being uniform or not as long as he got his little identification he's a worker of the police and that's his commission that's his job just a uniform that will not work well we know that Jesus say mark all that is sent by commission there had to be a a Vindication what is that Vindication these are the miracle the signs that shall follow those have believed the prophet says he didn't say maybe it shall follow them or maybe it would it may follow them but he said says go everywhere says somebody wants to delete this commission is that way to make it a little bigger and he say seems like somebody wants to delete that commission 2,000 years ago but Jesus say everywhere to the entire creation these are the sign that shall follow everywhere to the entire nation Prophet those were miracle that has to follow them to to to vindicate the creation identification as long as you don't have Miracles that means you're not that means he's not a Believer that's why I want you in you to be born that desire of seeking your identity God identify he say it was that had to follow to approve that identification says in paragra 33 how come a man can claim that the baptis or the Holy Spirit how come a man can claim that the the healing of the sickness how come a man can declare speaking in tongue doesn't exist that casting demons out doesn't exist those were the signs of identification that Jesus put on under each uh believer that he have S says that's the authority says you can go to scho and get a doctor philosop get a PhD phos in PhD inw whatever you want to do it's in right your identification according to that organization I'm saying but the identification through Jesus when he's sending some his identific these are the Miracles or the signs that shall follow those that have believed that's this is what identify a man that has been sent from God am amen brothers and sisters if we are believers signs have to follow us I am not [Music] saying you have to start looking for miracles and want that's not what I'm saying but I want to say if you are a Believer the signs and wonders shall follow I am not telling you to go seek for those sign that's not what the prophet's saying amen amen the signs has to identify the Believers andam say no matter any any unifor can g a uniform to get the identity card that that has been certified and with a judgment to prove that your birth is uh undoubtable that only requires Jesus only Jesus who has to confirm and it will confirm that to your a Believer when the the signs shall follow and you will approve your birth for you to get an identity you have to first be born and when you born there's got to be a confirmation that this child is alive they give him an ID card now we can never receive from God the confirmation if we have never been born you got to be born in the kingdom of God amen amen amen I know some of thought they elsewhere I was expecting they thinking of something else they say if you can clear off everything from your mind we are in the house of the Lord there's nothing that's impossible to God so please clear off everything that can come in your mind you know when we come in the house of the Lord our mind has to be pure you cannot be sitting in the house of the Lord and uh minimizing that means you don't know what you came to if you in a house of the Lord you got to love the person and in that way you'll be help but if you start taking say what is it saying you will get out of here as you can promising you that you can even get wor wor than you what you wear so in the house of the Lord we got to have a pure mind yes brothers and sisters now hear this I'm trying to tell you this that as a Believer we have to be Vindicated by God it's not about that we took that day about that testimony you gave that day if you a Believer them signs has to follow you the prophet teaches there are three types of Bel the True Believer the unbel and a semi believer so what happened we all believe that we were all believers when we speak when we speak the entire church identifies the because I have never seen somebody claiming that he's a half believer I have never seen a person saying that I'm an we all claim to be a believer but to be a believer you have to be Vindicated God has to Vindicated that you a Believer it's not the water of it's not the brother in which we are that makes you say that you're a Believer I want us to get to that level but each one of us identifies as believer I am called you are called belever God know us as believers why I have brought this to you the prophet said that was been transmitted to the Saints once paragraph 114 says now no Jesus was rejected well let's take the great Paul St Paul excuse sorry that's why sometimes I don't like to use this iPad and the prophet says Mage faith that was transmitted to the paragraph 114 it says now notice friends Jesus was rejected let's consider the Great now let's take this line he say here says fight for the faith that was W that was that has been transmitted to the Saints once for all that's even the title of the that has been transmitted to the Saints once for all now the prophet says and Paul say fight for the faith transmitted to the S once for all that was from the beginning transmitted the and what is that faith those are Miracles and wonders that's the faith that was that has been but today everyone we are called belever this one has his own faith and he's calling his Doctrine he says I don't believe in such things in our church we don't believe in this as we believe in this as we believe such way our church don't believe in such people call their faith their way of they call it they call it that's not what called Faith he says faith he says faith is Miracles and wonders see God has confirmed his church with what all along with he say it was not by an but God has Church Miracles and says is that right not the one who has the greatest group not the one who has the the greatest Doctrine but he has confirmed them vindicate them with Miracles it says that's where God dwells we want to see God God dwelling in mirac and wonders I told you that I'm tired preaching with scriptures I want for a moment after preaching using scriptures I want to say now we put the scriptures aside and now we want to see God to come down vindicating his scriptures that's the purpose of the church that's the goal of a Believer please don't sleep we mys and S my brothers and sisters and now he say says Jesus cannot accept a man who is not born from water and spirit amen amen he says he will not enter to the kingdom after receiving the baptism of the holy spirit said these are signs that shall follow those who that have and brother he says that that is straight amen amen even before getting the Holy Spirit you were not yet a beli before I get the Holy Spirit wasn't yet a Believer anybody to to get the holy they were not yet the believer yes brothers and sisters now the prophet says message parag says this is straight ahead after you receive the Holy Ghost now these are the sign that shall follow those that have believed says it's not going but it's coming from straight from the Bible Jesus has never said maybe those Miracle Miracles will accompan but Jesus said that shall follow them and I found in the message today people that have created groups there are people who says us is only the word we don't need all these other stuff oh speaking in Tong Divine Healing you don't want those but people are sick how are they going to get healed says when we read he says since when Divine Healing has stopped to exist since when the Holy Ghost stopped to exist the same holy ghost that anoints the pre for the word it is the same that has to operate Mir signs and wonders cannot happen if they don't work a church sleep and expecting Miracles it's never going to Happ Miracles and wers there are signs that vindicate a Believer a Believer is not the one sleeping but aever is the one who works who works his soul out and when he works his home signs start following him I remember one day I had a friend who called me he told me my friend my wife my wife is in a hospital and she's pregnant with twin it seems like one of the twin where he's sitting they said that he's the liquid that's uh in the baby in the mother's room is getting low and the mods know that a child cannot be born with that cuz where that child is he is in that in that liquid that's where protects the child there's a lot of nutrition in that liid but now one of the twin was because that liquid was getting lower and it was fading brother was in the hospital with his wife and I was going to work he called me say we in the hospital now I want you to pray for us I told him my dear friend I'll pray for you Lord will do something it was on Friday Sunday I came here to preach when I left here I went back home I felt a presence i f an anointing when I came home around 8:00 p.m. I started praying I'm feeling this I've got to pray for that brother I went to my closet I closed it up my wife wasn't there she was I started praying started praying so I was praying and I felt an anointing I felt like I was talking with somebody in front of me and I found myself speaking words I said Lord God I'm taking control and I'm claiming that child in the other that is going to and that liquid will be refilled and I end up my prayer around 8 p.m. and I found out that I've prayed for 30 minutes and when the prayer was I went to pick up my wife came back home on Monday I didn't call my friend and on Tuesday he's the one call he started telling me how are you doing I said and we spoke about different things and then I ask him even before I asked him he told said my friend do you know said what's going on he say you know you know remember the other twin that was in the other room the doctor told us that the situation is getting better and they don't understand here in the United States and I told him I don't want to claim that miracle I said wait tell me when did the doctor that that liquid has refilled he said say they told us around 8 p.m. on Sunday I told him now listen my friend it was around the same time that I was in praying for yourid I pray the Lord I felt a presence and I spoke the word and now now I can vindicate that God can exhaust prayer before receiving the Holy Spirit we're not a Believer God is not calling us even if we go to the Bap God is not calling us believers and we stayed there because we uh we took in a certain church and we start working with the faith of the church with the doctrine of the church and we claiming and we say this is the faith of our church but brand says so Paul says he say let's fight for the that faith that has been trans once for all for all the saints brother faith that was transmitted he says that are the sign that shall follow those that have believed if we have to fight the only way for us to fight it's not for to say that we are in we are in eternity the only time we have to fight to have a debate it's when we com to say that what what was the fa that transmitted to the Saints once in my life and in your life I will read it cuz I know I know how many people have been IND by many things and sometimes they don't make no sense have any relationship with the what the message the purpose of the message Miss says in the message uh says the last commission that he gave to his church the sign shall follow those he says go to Jerusalem to every the gospel to entire nature he said preach to the white man preach to the black man to the brown to the yellow even to the r to the entire nature and say he says the gospel is the new good news preach it to the entire nature until the end of the world go to the preach the gospel and now have a question what is that gospel we have preached oh maybe we have preached to our or we just got ourselves as Africans saying says preach to the white PR preach to the yell preach to the red why are we Gathering only con that we have made the the the works of the Gospel there's something that's missing because the gopel it's the good news and Paul say he says preaching it's not about repeating spech Paul says I didn't come with our pers our speech of but I've came to you the demonstration of the power of God so preaching the word is demonstrating the power that's why there's no white man that's why there's no red man because we know each other somebody lives you got to come to the church where the child of my unle you cannot live here if you don't go to the same church as and that's why we find our between conges but if the the gospel is pre and being demonstrated and when the go will with demonstration of God's power a white man will come down red man will come down will preached to the entire nature and now you will say who is a white man do we need a white man here no no the gopel preach to the entire nature as long as we are just between us we have failed to the of the church I will never cease to repat as long as we just between between us we have lacked the we have missed the the purpose go of the Gospel the gospel has to be preached with demonstration of God's power in the entire world preach I have to speak about 45 minutes says says in the message where we just read says in paragraph 27 let's read paragraph 26 first says not just here these are the miracle that may follow those who has made they got to follow them if they cl to they are genuine believer Miracles has to follow them but the ver the verb has it is a must if we are believers miracles must follow us it shall follow those has that have believed speaking correctly and man cannot be a believer before this happen what has to be happen these are signs that shall follow those that have believed paragraph 27 it says None one church has the right to claim to be a church that believes before this miracle follow have followed says that's what Jesus say that's what he what does does it makes the word being manifested my brothers and sisters when a man is born from God each word that God has if you feel like you got God in you you will believe in this word but if you just take and reject the other side that means you don't have God in you when you are filled with the Holy Spirit when he's filled the Holy Ghost Reed the holy spirit that given if he was born by the spirit of God Jesus said in Mark 16 these are sign that shall follow yes my brothers and sisters this is the sign that has to follow the Believers brother says three C of people the believer this soal believer the unbeliever he says only those three category of people group of a group of and a group of unbelief says if you a genuine believer Jesus said these are signs that shall follow those that have believed in my name they shall and they will speak new tongues if they have to be if they have to walk upon Serpent and will not injure them if they lay their hands upon sick shall be healed that's true as long as the word of God is true they will walk upon serpents today we all scared when we all see a when we we see an we all afraid but I remember in the Bible when a snake came out from the bush and bite beaten somebody and that person was Paul just took SN and thrw him in a fire he didn't cry he didn't wonder and the people that was they were expecting Paul to die or maybe something to happen to but the man was standing he stood alive nothing happened to him I remember day brother he was beaten by his when was fishing with saw that big fish so he couldn't get it out of the water brother said for you brother and he dived into the waters says he took off his shoes and when he got to the he was in a and there was a snake that that bites brother saw him crying started he felt like his bones was fighting between them he had big pains says I get I got closer and we got him out water and I got closer to him Brown says I just looked at his feet I could see I could see the teeth the the print of the I just laid my hand on his feet and I said I said Lord God said in your word they shall walk upon serpent injured them say once in a and all the pain disapp and even and we fished for three days without having any issues when he went back home he told it to people and people told him you better go see a doctor said if the Lord God rescued he had rescued me since that day I believe that he will take take care of I do not need to see a doctor never die because of that bite of the serpent We Got to Believe In such God God I know medicine heals but I don't think medicine has to be our first option as Believers we got to know that we have gotten the authority walk under the snakes and Scorpion even if it's a deadly thing drink it's not going to hurt you now listen and in this message we had we had many cases of where people has been they didn't even know it was and God kept them alive we have we need that God if we come here church for the word to be preached not to just to fill our head with knowledge so that we don't use those knowledge the word is preached for us to practice it yes my brothers and sisters and I'll finish with this we can continue with this next time I'll close by here knowing that Pastor will be here next Sunday and now he says says not only those who say but the belever that's identif I'm in the message they will they probably uh follow them [Music] he wants to say that it's not what the scripture say the scripture didn't say they probably will not follow them that probably maybe they shall follow Jesus say shall those that have believed say it says it's ABS absolutely so that for that not be because he said You shall do the same works that I did that's the identification identification of Jes about to manifest the word of God that who he is he was if we claim that we've received the word we cannot manifest we cannot that means we didn't receive that word I told you I'm trying to make that thirst of using the word the word that we have listened for all these years it's it's not important just to listen and listen without practicing what we listen we are called without any sign following us it doesn't even B us that means we not even Believers if you are a Believer sign has to follow you if I am a the signs has to follow me but before the follow me then we not beli we just read it that's what the prophet say and today the identification of the church manifesting that was promised for this by the same spirit that that that was and that quickened the word in that time he says today he said today the same the word for the believer and is's manifesting the same showing that the sign is on that that person means the life resurrected of Jesus Christ Living in his believer that had to to burn in the church that's true and that's really true and now my brothers and sisters we are called Believers by ourselves and this is where I end brother BR says any any player can get a uni he can get a badge I can claim to be a officer anybody can do it and today in the churches have criminals in church with witchcrafter in the church with THS in the church all these all that are uniform just wearing a uniform but being an but being a witch being a magician wearing a uniform claiming that I'm a Believer that's not enough but you have to be Vindicated you have the possibility ID card now Lord God I've created a uni I've bued car while I was not even believer I just heard the word morning but being aever I believer is the one that you a Believer the one that has his identif and the identification of is the sign that has to follow him my brothers and sisters you have the possibility to the ability to KNE down and tell God oh Lord God I thought I was in order but now realizing that it was just an unform it was just a badge that I was wearing I'm coming to you this morning oh God I want to ask you for you to identify as a genuine believer give me my ID card don't leave me without an identification card so this morning we've got each one of us ID card signs that follow us my brothers and sisters is the thought that I have for you this morning to raise in you that so we cannot stay Qui so we cannot rest so that we know have
