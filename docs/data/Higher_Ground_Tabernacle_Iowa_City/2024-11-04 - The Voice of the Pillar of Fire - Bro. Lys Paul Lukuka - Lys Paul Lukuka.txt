we'll go to uh uh 1st Samuel chapter 3 but let's bow our head first dear heavenly father Lord we thank you for such a beautiful day we thank you Lord God for giving us a good health and a place where we can come and hear your word and Worship You Lord I pray that you forgive us of our shortcomings father we here we here with an appointment with you Lord because you said in your word that wherever two or three are gathered in your name that you shall be in the midst of them Father we thank you for being here and I yield myself to you Lord I pray you that you use the gift that you speak to your people and you hear through their through their ears Lord God may you bless each ear that'll hear the word in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen all right 1 Samuel chapter 3 verse 1 says Samuel and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli 1 Samuel chapter 3 before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision I'll repeat that again the word of the Lord was precious in those days the prophet says the word of the Lord is still precious in our [Music] days and verse two and it came to pass at that time when was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wa themm that he could not see and a the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to [Music] sleep that the Lord the Lord called Sam and and he answered here am I and he ran onto Eli and said here am I for thou callest me and he said I called not lay down again and he went down and laid down and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou did call me and he answered I called not my son lie down again and the Lord God and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou did call me and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child and therefore Eli said unto Samuel go lie down and it shall be if he called thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for thy servant heareth so Samuel went and laid down in his place [Music] and the last verse and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel you know I love that the word says that he called as at other time so God doesn't change he always keeps the same way of brother says that if if God deals with one person a certain way he also deal with another person same way because he changes not so then Samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth amen I have one more verse and I'll let you see Exodus 3 verse 1-4 the Bible says now Moses kept the flock of uh jro his father mother-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not con consumed consum and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great side why the bush is not burned Mo and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am [Music] I amen you may have your seats amen um while you see it I'll just read one more verse and going to be Genesis chapter one oh he says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth verse three says and God said let there be light and there was light verse five he says and God called the uh the light day and the Darkness he called night verse six he says and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters amen amen so this morning I'm going to going to preach on a topic called uh the voice of the pillar of fire the voice of the pillar of fire or in other word it can it can be like the voice of the Angel of the Lord and um I'll first by I'll start by um describe what what is the pill of fire the prophet said that in the beginning when God created the Heaven and the earth like before he even started the creation there was the the Earth was void know uh the spirit of God was moving over over the Earth but you couldn't see God because God was God is a spirit and then the prophet says God God God he was just all everywhere like he he he occupied the entire the entire he didn't have like um Lim and then he had to make himself in a form that could be visible and the prophet called that the logos the prophet says that the logos the word of God the that was the pill of fire that came out of that great he says he said in the beginning God wasn't even God yet he was just the great Elohim the self-existent one and out of Elohim the the theophany the word the pill of fire came out and that's God in a visible form so that same pillow of fire is that pillow of fire that we we saw appear to Moses but before we get to Moses we also see that Samuel heard the voice and the prophet says that the voice was precious in those days the word of the Lord and he says it's even more precious in our days so don't take the voice of God for for granted hold it as a precious Jewel Prophet said it's more precious in the days of Samuel the Bible says in the day in the days of Samuel there was no open Vision so let's get back to the story of Moses so Moses heard uh Moses heard the voice of God in the burning boo but he he was curious to see where the voice was coming from and he looked and he saw there was fire but the the the Bush was not burn um getting burnt it was it wasn't getting consumed he was curious to see what that voice was that fire was and he heard a voice Moses Moses take off the Sho your shoes so we understand so understand that the pillow of fire has a voice because that that pillow of fire spoke to Moses and Moses uh Moses while growing up he already knew his position he knew he he was to to to deliver the children of Israel he knew his calling and he and he tried to go before before the pillow of fire and tried to do it with his own hands El said he tried to save his Brethren and then that got him into trouble and the prophet says that every time you try to go before the angel of the Lord that's where you get into trouble Moses thought that he he could do it all by himself but you have to know that any Ministry you cannot be successful in any Ministry without the help of the Angel of the Lord even our prophet in our day he couldn't be successful without the angel of the [Music] Lord he had to to meet the pill of fire so Moses heard the voice and the voice changed him because before that Moses actually he ran away from the Egyptians know in other word he was sort of like a coward but you notice there's a difference in Moses after he he met the pillar of fire he went down to the camp of the enemy that's why the pillar of fire will do to you if you meet the pill of fire it's going to change you it will give you boldness he will take away that spirit of fear he will take away any Spirit contrary to the word of God the pill of fire will help you to accomplish the purpose that God wants for you Moses had a calling but he couldn't be successful without meeting that fire all of you all of you have callings in your life God is calling each and every one of you to a specific purpose but you will never be successful without meeting the pillow of Fire you will never be successful without hearing the voice of the pillar of fire so in the message the absolute paragraph 263 the prophet explains and he says that now notice Moses had the fire the fire and he says the fire was in Moses because whatever Moses said it wasn't Moses it was God speaking and he says because the pillar of fire left the bush and come in Moses so when Moses had that experience with a pill of fire brother tells us that that fire didn't just stay on in in on the bush left the bush and he went inside of Moses and therefore Moses became the voice of God to the to the children of Israel when Moses when God met Moses he told him that I heard the Cry of my people I heard the Cry of my people and I've come down myself to deliver them no but when the children of Israel saw the Deliverance of God came form of a human being it came in the form of a man and that man had was veiling the pillow of fire inside of him this is not my word I just repeated what brother Bram saying in the message the absolute we just read he said that the pill of fire left the bush and he came inside of Moses so the message that Moses was bringing to the children of Israel wasn't message sent by Moses himself you know so after he went to Egypt to deliver the [Music] children there was an experience in Mount Si and the children of Israel also wanted to hear the voice of God they were complaining why is God just dealing with Moses directly instead of coming straight to us and God like okay Moses I I tell the people to sanctify I'll come down to to to speak to them myself and when God came down to speak to them the Bible says it was lightning Thunders and M like mou quaking and all that and they trembled they were afraid what a love about that verse is that I think it's in verse 19 he says that he says that the the children of Israel couldn't speak to God but Moses could speak to God they were so afraid that they couldn't even speak to God but Moses was a different a different he was a different being and they as they told they told um Moses tell God that from now on we don't want God to speak to us directly we want God to deal with you to speak to you and then you bring us the word of God and God and God honored that that request and from that time God changed the way he deal with men God started using prophets from that time the prophet became God's mouthpiece to the generation like prophets they're not they're not the same beings like we are here they're made different than us if you read the book of Exodus that experience in Mount Si it was the god coming down on the mountain and it was full of fire and nobody could even touch uh uh the mountain God had set boundaries on the around around that mountain even if the animals touch the mountain they will die instantly but you notice that Moses could actually get in the mountain Moses could get the mountain was was the full of the pillar of fire the prophet says that Moses entered into the pillar of fire you even see even brother Bram when he went to the doctor the doctor told him that his body is different than our body you know that like his body is not made like our body he's different because he had to meet God face to face to bring us the word for our day amen amen and then so when Moses so be so after Moses went to mount uh uh uh he went to the mountain to to see [Music] God and the glory of God was so great that he Moses had to Veil his face the children of Israel could not look at Moses the prophet says that by looking at Moses they were getting blinded and the prophet says that that's that's the same thing that's happening in our day today people are always blinded by seeing God veiled in a man the prophet says that if he he he opens the eyes to some and he blinds the other one that's always been a stumbling block in our generation God walking in a human being but don't let that stumble you because God has given you his grace to see that that was God using the man you know so Moses wanted to see the glory of God he wanted to see the glory he asked God God I want to see your glory and God said okay I'll go on the mountain on the Rock somewhere and God passed and Moses saw that he saw that God had a back he had a back like a man and that verse says that God took his hands and covered the face of Moses so we see that that pill of fire actually has a he like he he's like a man he has a back he has hands you know amen amen amen so like the the message today is to try to emphasize on the importance of listening to the voice of God and understanding that making the difference between the man and God that you're not hearing from a man you're hearing from God because once you have that Revelation then this message becomes a blessing to you as long as you just think that this message is just a man speaking to you then you'll never be blessed but as long as you know it is God then you're going to receive the blessing from God so Moses Moses in the mountain he had appointed Elders yeah he had 70 elders yeah because uh because the the work was getting too much and I think his father-in-law advised to him to have 70 elders to carry to continue to help Moses in his in his ministry but I I was reading what the prophet said about that experience and he said that despite Moses um um appointing those 70 elders Moses was still last answer so if they had any issue they had to always go back to what Moses said the prophet said because he had thus sayth the Lord so even ministers today we only supposed to repeat what brother Bram says because only he brought that said the Lord for Our Generation he he was meeting God face to face brother bam says that God never deals with two people at the same time brother Ram says that if God the reason why God doesn't do it like that is because we have diff we never see things eye to eye we have our own inter like we we see things things differently so God couldn't use two people because they'll have two different opinions regarding his word that's why God always brings one person amen So reading the message take the rod and gather the people the prophet says oh I don't know what it is in French um Che yeah the prophet says that um the people that crucified Jesus Christ believed in An Almighty God in religion's holy Renown man they crucified the Son of God because they did not believe that he was God in and no matter how much they believed in Jehovah God they can't believe in Jesus being his son in order to receive anything from Jehovah God uh I'll continue reading this but before the prophet is saying that you know the Jesus says that you have believed in God believe also in me the prophet says that those those Pharisees all those people they believed God they belied Jehovah Jesus is I know you believe in God but believe also in me and the prophet makes a strong declaration here and he says when he met the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord told if you get the people to believe you he says do you see it get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray no disease shall stand before the prayer he says do you believe me you know Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever if you believe the prophet the prophet message you know nothing will be impossible to you and he says I'll believe God no no okay the prophet is saying you you say I I'll believe God so brother is saying I'm telling you believe me but you tell brother Bram no me I'll just believe God brother Bram says that well that's what you should do but you can't believe God and you don't believe this it won't do you any good he says now that's hard and I hate to say that but it's the truth right so you can there there are a lot of people they claim oh we believe Jesus we believe the Bible and all that but according to what brother bam is saying if you yeah it's it's good you believe the Bible but if you don't believe me he won't do you any good that's why the angel told brother if you get the people to believe you then nothing shall stand against your prayer and he says then when you believe me you believe what the angel has come for that he is the angel from God you know I'm just his voice he is a supernatural person and I'm natural he can bring Supernatural to the Natural man he glorifies he speaks his voice he uses my hands he he uses my eyes to see Visions he uses my ears just as the Holy Spirit uses you so the prophet is saying that he's the voice of God and that God is a supernatural person using natural the same way that Moses made the pillar of fire and he became the voice of God to the children of Israel a supernatural God using a man a natural man amen amen and the prophet says that there's a word of God for each age there there's a word of God for the there was a word of God for the the age of Luther like um West and in our age to we living in the last age do you believe that we living in the last age and there's there got to be a word for our age but the way God works is he always uses a prophet to bring his word and the is that same pillow of fire that that came out of God spoke and that pillow of fire enters the prophet and starts speaking and the prophet even says that Moses was Moses became God to the children of Israel amen he says that okay I'll just read that here I like reading the prophet because that way you it's you I give you that it's not coming from me it's coming from the prophet I'm just here to repeat and to Echo what he says you know he says he was he was with Moses and was ready to be manifested he says he was the words to them he's speaking about Moses Moses was the Living Word he Moses was the word of God veiled uh in a man the prophet say mes had to put a veil over his own face why because he was the word and until the word was made known Moses had to Veil himself the prophet says wherever the word is it's veiled and he says now remember after the word was made manifest Moses was Moses again mes times where he was just Moses and there were times where he became God to the children of Israel and the prophet says that as long as Moses said the word in in him to give out to the people he became God to them that's why I don't understand when people try to correct the prophet it just shows a lack of revelation of who a prophet is who are you to correct God you have to understand that a prophet is not just himself he's the representative of God he's the voice of God for this generation don't let any Minister try to correct the prophet we are here to Echo what brother bam saying because that's that's life to us amen amen and the prophet continues and he says that he says that Moses was a different fellow you know he said let me back he says nothing could okay nothing could touch him till that was over imagine this man Moses in the in the Bible when the pill of fire was inside of him you couldn't even touch him that's that's powerful you can't even touch the man because God was in a man and he says that he says that therefore when you when he come the people turned their heads they couldn't understand he was a different fellow prophets are different fellows they're not like we are like I I said earlier he come with the word and he put a veil the Bible said over his face and this is what brother says and he had the word and he was the word to them I'm not going to be sorry to say that William branam is the word of God to you and I'm not ashamed to say that and you have to believe that in order to receive the same reward that he that that he that the angel promised him and when you when you when you you believe that brother Bram is the word for our day then you start applying that word because you understand that the word did not come from him came from God himself you know and and the prophet says I I think I said this earlier the word of God veiled in a man is what blinds the people and brother brother says that that uh um today because the message uh that's what that's what hold on let me back let me go back cuz I don't want to God can't break his word in the last days he had to be the same thing again what blinded Israel it was that man you a man making yourself God that's what they killed him for and today because the message come through man and not Angels Propet is saying that's what's stumbling the people because today the message is coming through a man you not seeing Angels coming down from heaven hey I have a word for from the Lord you you see a man that could put a heart on his head he could go hunt know and and he had issues with the law he tax uh problems and that man you want to tell me he's he he's bringing the word of God for me the prophet says that's what is stumbling the people because the message came through a man he says God can't change his way God cannot change his word he says and the Gentiles are just as blinded today as Israel was because God is veiled in a human being blinded Israel don't be blinded by by by seeing God using a man amen amen you must be a blessed people to actually have your eyes open because Jesus says that bless I thank the father that you've hidden these things to the wise and prudent but you have revealed this to such as babes you must be so special for God to to leave all those other people out there and give you that Revelation world is full the world is the world is full of eight billion people out of 8 billion people God chose you you have to be a happy people you got to praise God because that Revelation is isn't given to anyone the prophet says he blinds the people but why are you here why are you here this morning sisters you could have been wearing pants you could have been putting makeups about why are you not doing that because God has opened your eyes God has given you that Revelation that this message did not come from a man and and I've experienced this thing God in a man uh God using in a using a Man U stumbles the people [Music] when I was here in North when I used to live in North Liberty I worked at Central and I was trying to witness to someone about the prophet and um as soon as I show him the picture of the prophet he just oh my God you guys are getting uh uh Brainwashed the white man has brainwashed you that stumbled him to see that stumbled the man to see that we we call God using a white man again to be a prophet but that doesn't stumble us and and then you didn't not get this on your own God revealed this to you don't condemn those people that cannot see the light because they can't help it it's God that gives Grace who opens the eyes know the Bible says that no man can come to him except he draws him first so you did not come to God yourself God is the one that Drew that Drew you to him and he said that he that began the good work he's faithful to finish that work so just trust God trust that voice trust that calling that he will call you he's going to finish God never leaves anything undone God is always perfect in everything he does Perfection means everything is exactly how it's supposed to be whatever the word of God says that you're supposed to be you will be that all you just have to do is to believe because because the Bible says that no man can please God the Bible says that only by faith you can pleas God the children of Israel displeased God because they did not believe the word of Moses if you want to find favor with God you got to believe His prophets you want find favor with God not just to believe but you got to apply what the prophet say the prophet of God says that a chrisan ought to go to be in the house of the Lord 30 minutes before service starts but unfortunately in this church we claim to be Believers of the Prophet I hope I'm not mistaken I hope we are all believing of the of Believers of the Prophet if you're not a believer I'm sorry I'm not speaking to you I'm speaking to Believers the prophet said we need to be in the house of the Lord 30 minutes before service start so we have to if we believe that we have to apply that Jesus says that if you love me you will keep my Commandments if you love The Prophet you will keep also his commandment because you understand that it's not a commandment made out of men but it's actually it's coming from God and God is so good that every time you keep his commandment he always gives you blessings if you want to see blessings in your life you got to apply the word you got to start coming to church 30 minutes before service you know I was here last Sunday and I was really shocked to be honest that service is supposed to start at 10:30 there was hardly anybody here and then today same thing again don't be mad at me be mad at what the prophet is saying because it's not my word brother says you got to be in the house of the Lord 30 30 minutes before because it creates an atmosphere that's we got to create the atmosphere that when The Sinner walks in those doors he feels a conviction and we worry why we always we bring guests and they leave because you are not setting the atmosphere the prophet says that a re a Revival is not bringing new people but it's getting all the trust out of your lives and the and the Revival has to start with yourself you have to stop pointing the fingers of someone else look at yourself you know there's a reason why God says not to point the fingers at someone else but to point it back at yourself when you come to the house of the Lord you're not coming so you can point fingers oh this is for this person this is for that person I I come to church to receive my blessings you can be two of you guys coming to church one person goes out with a blessing and another person with his curse because the prophet says that every time you come to church you either go back a better person that you were or you go out worse then you came in so you need to examine your life this morning examine your Christian walk are you going forward with God or are you going backwards every time you come to church when you go out are you a better Christian than you were when you came in you may lie to to to your neighbor you may lie to me but one thing for sure you can never lie to yourself each and every one of us this morning right now you know that if today you were to die you know exactly if you're going to heaven or or hell you can't lie to me but you can never lie to yourself so stop pointing the fingers of someone else and look at yourself and when I'm preaching I'm not just preaching to you I'm preaching to myself as well the prophet says we need to come to church 30 minutes before do you not know that that Grieves the spirit of God when he comes to church on time and you guys are not on time it Grieves the spirit of God and God that's why you not seeing us blessings in your life grieving the spirit of God you are grieving the spirit of of God with your life always pointing fingers at someone else that's actually the spirit of the devil because the Bible says that the devil is the accusers of the Brethren the Bible says that the devil is accusing the Brethren day and night that the spirit you got to get rid of that spirit amen amen I I wasn't even in my notes I'm sorry amen amen all right let's get back to this so we're speaking about uh Moses and the pillow of fire yeah just get back to it again so you have to apply the word I'm speaking to you that you you from next Sunday whenever you guys have service we need to see a change because then there is no difference between just you could have just gone to any other churches like any other lodges are you just are you just hearing to play religion I I want a God that changes life when I come to church I come with the promise that wherever two or three are gathered in my name I shall be in the midst of them I believe that God is present here because God cannot lie the Bible says that God is man is not a man that he shall lie so if God said that he's here whenever two or three are gathered in his name we are gathered here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he always keeps his word and whenever you are in the presence of God then you can ask what you will and he will give it to you you got to take advantage of being in the presence of God don't go the same person that came in that woman um The Prostitute woman that that that went to cry at the feet of Jesus she wasn't she wasn't even supposed to be there in the first place because the the law had said that if you commit adultery you shall be stoned and and nobody was taking care of Jesus they left Jesus out there in a corner by himself you know but that's this is what I love the prophet says that that God always keeps his appointment you can be assured today that God always keeps his appointment we have an appointment at 10:30 to be at church God always keeps that appointment but the prophet says that many time we leave Jesus with dirty feet in a corner Jesus want to see you on time but people just come to church like imagine at 10:30 when church is supposed to start that's when you wake up I'm telling you this morning that it's ging the spirit of God and you got to repent you know it's it may it may seem little to you but it's those little things sometimes that matters amen amen so the prophet in the message God reach who rich in Mercy in paragraph 76 um he says that now God always lacking His prophets to Eagles Moses was his messenger they were following Moses know and that that was the Eagle wings that they were carried on and the people followed that they were following God as they followed Moses with his message of Deliverance not he says they were following God as they were following Moses that's why Paul says be ye follow follow of me as I'm follower as I'm follower of Christ so we're following the message of William Bram as he's following Jesus Christ remember that when he had that Vision that he went to heaven those people that went there they told him that he was the leader of that of that group if you want to go to the same place you have to follow the leader he will lead you there and I'm not talking about the man of William Bram but I'm talking of the Angel of the lord inside of the man William Bram the angel of the Lord will lead you amen he's the same Angel of the Lord that led the children of Israel amen I'm just going to read a chapter here real quick um it's in the book of Exodus exod yeah Exodus chap 23: 20 exod the Bible says so behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared I repeat it again behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared prepared a place for the children of Israel and that angel was the person that had to lead them they had a promise and be aware of him and obey his voice I'm just I'm just noticing it he's saying obey his voice that angel firee voice but then when the the pill of fire was speaking they couldn't hear so how can I obey a voice that I cannot hear behold I send my angel before thee obey his voice obey the messenger obey the prophet of the age because he has the voice of the Angel provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that is all that I speak that's why I said even those little things pay attention to them because the Bible did not say if you shall keep some that he that he speaks he said all know Eve fell because she left one word we got to take the whole world you know so they getting back to that again coming to church on time right if you shall obey his voice there there are benefits to obeying the voice of the angel and those are the benefits then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversary your enemy is not your brother your enem is are those principalities those spirits that are fighting you you know all the all those sickness that you having those anxiety depression even those spirit of lust you know that that's actually a very stubborn demon the spirit of lust is a very very stubborn demon you know but but it's not too stubborn for the Lord God is more he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world I have seen the demon of last before he was in a camp we went to a camp meeting I had a friend of mine that I was witnessing to to God about and he was dealing with spirit of pornography and that's actually very common among young children young people today so whoever you are today who's dealing with that Spirit listen to this you got first know that you have the the Bible says in know the prophet says in order to overcome Satan you got to first know that Satan is real you got to recognize that this is a demon oh I have a disease no let's call it by it's called cancer or something no it's a demon unless you recognize that it's a demon you're not going to overcome it if you're dealing with lust you got to first know that it's a demon in order to overcome that demon so they they have a they had a prayer line that that they had and in those prayer line they were praying for people demons getting cast out and all sort of things and I noticed that um he I I won't say his name so he walked through the the line and it seems like nothing happened to him so I was a bit worried because I thought like he was going to be agitated and all those stuff but after after he went down he he sat on his chair and and he just bowed his head but later on um um a brother gave a testimony that while he was walking through the prayer line the brother did not see my friend walking but he saw a demon that was walking in the so you can never hide yourself in the presence of God and so what one thing I love is that there were some kids probably like 14 15 year old they went and they laid hands on him and the demon and the demon started going crazy he wasn't no it wasn't a minister that laid their hands on him some kids so young children God can also use you Jesus at the age of 12 years old he was already uh uh serving God you are never too young to serve God you just have to yield yourself and let God use you and parents you need to encourage your children to serve the Lord at a young age that's why the Bible tell says to start them while they're young to train them in the way that they should uh there was a there was a king in the Bible I think he became king at the age of 12 Jah he became a king at the age of of 12 so God can use you God can use all those young children here going back to the story and then all of a sudden um so the the demon was going crazy but like we couldn't nobody know what kind knew what kind of spirit that was and I didn't know because I was I was in the back and there were like it was like 600 people but I noticed there was a commotion somewhere there and uh but the brother who saw that demon he went and called the demon by name then the demon started speaking and the demon started speaking he saying he's not going to go you know and that was a spirit of love so you have so he took that brother who knew who God gave him Grace to see what that Spirit was that is why the prophet says that you need to confess your sins because he says we can't pour pour as much oil on you and pray but if you don't confess the sin the demon is not going to go the proph says that when you confess your sins the uh uh you the devil is losing his grips but as long as you want to hide the spirit in you he's never going to leave you he's going to destroy your life lust destroy people's lives last even destroy marriages a very stubborn demon this is not in my not so someone here must be dealing with last but you got to take it as a grace of God to you that he he's dealing with you right now but you got to confess that demon because if you do not confess the demon he will never go and eventually they and oh yeah so there was one thing so they brought a picture of um yeah they brought that picture of William Bram with a pill of fire and they showed this to the demon I was there myself I saw this and like he he didn't want to look at the picture he was just like you know and then in order for for for Satan for in order for my friend to speak you had to command the devil and tell him abund you in the name of Jesus Christ let him speak then you could hear my friend's voice speaking bind that Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ and tell um and then and then tell him to let uh that friend speak I I I'm close to saying that person's name but I don't want to say his name and I have witnesses you can ask like we I was there the few people that came so they also that and um yeah so that and then that that that also taught me a lesson because when he was speaking he was it was that friend's vocal Cod so it was his voice but it wasn't him speaking it was the demon speaking so I was like wait a minute so even when you see your brother your sister criticizing you it's not your brother criticizing you it's that demon inside of him that's criticizing you that's why you got to love the person and then you can't overcome by love because when he spoke you hear his voice okay there was one instance so they told him um confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior and he said Satan is my Lord and then the brothers understand that I was in him speaking that was the demon and they rebuke the devil again so you got to you got to look past those criticism just see that it's a demon inside of your brother if someone want to hurt it's not themselves they anointed by a spirits to hurt you you got to pray for that person because he possessed of a demon but yeah fast forward that Spirit was cast out I know that a demon of last that last is a young man if you struggl struggling with pornography you are carrying a demon and the demon is going to hunt you until you confess that demon so up to you either you want to be free or you want to keep strugg struggling with him and don't be afraid because Jesus is more powerful than that demon there is not any devil here that's more powerful than Jesus Christ he said that in my name you shall cast out demons even cancer even HIV even pornography pornography anxiety every demon that's not confessed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can be cast out we don't believe in just a a God that doesn't exist God is God is real as much as those demons are real God is also real who who want to be a a person bound all your life you always bound bound bound [Music] I remember I remember a man in the Bible the the man of G you know he was full of a lot of demons Legions of demons and those demons the prophet explains that he started he didn't start all of a sudden he was full of demon he came with one demon and that demon allowed another demon and then he brought another demon and then before he could understand he was full of demons in him so those little bad habits you are leing in your Liv he always T little and then you start noticing that you you start going crazy crazy crazy crazy so cast that demon while he's still young don't wait for the demon to become strong but then when he came to Jesus those demon had to obey to obey the voice of Jesus Jesus was the pillow of fire made flesh it doesn't it didn't matter if that man had a million demons in him the prophet said that when those demons came to Jesus they felt a different sort of electricity they noticed that this was the word this person was not like any of the prophet he was the word himself made flesh and those demon had to obey the the voice of God Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever whatever demons you have those demons have to obey the voice of God in the name of Jesus Christ de those demons got to go um uh my first sermon that I preach in De there is one quotes where the Prophet says that Satan already lost all his power he does not have any jurisdiction over you anymore jurisdiction means legal Authority the prophet said but you you are the one who gives him back that Authority when you hide your sins you Satan is already at the cross when Jesus died he took he he he took every everything from Satan but the prophet say you are the one that gives him back that so if you want to be free it's really up it's in your hands you got to confess those Spirits those Spirit of Darkness the prophet even says that it's hard to preach when there's a congregation full of that dark spirit it's hard for the anointing the presence of God to fall because of people full of demons but in the presence of of the light all Darkness have to flee the light has come in our day it's not just some words we've seen the light and the same pill of fire is here right now to expose The Works of the enemy just obey his voice then he will fight your battles he will stand between you and evil is that we just read that's the word of God and God's word the Bible says it's not it's never going to return void it's always going to accomplish the purpose for which if you don't believe ask God to give you Faith to believe his word I was reading one one message where the Prophet is telling the people if you not have if you don't have enough faith for this ask God to perform a surgery in your heart and give you faith only please God by faith so if you don't have faith ask him you have not because you ask not and you ask you you ask not because you believe not and you believe not because your motive and objective are in the wrong place that's what the Bible says but as long as you know in your motive the Bible says that we are the Temple of of God to present our body as uh holy and acceptable is Living Sacrifice acceptable to God and that's our reasonable service so you are struggling with lust but so when you ask God you know that your purpose is correct because you want to present your body holy before God and and and and and we see the prophet says that God doesn't change the way he deals deals with things we see that aen had seen that he was hiding in the camp God had made the promise to the children of Israel that he will go fight their battles but then they started noticing that soldiers were falling dying and people were dying the problem wasn't with God's promise the problem is never with the promise promise of God God is always true with his promise but the the problem was that there was sin in the camp this church can never go forward if there's sin in the camp God does not change his ways if there's one person here living an ungodly life God is here to tell you that he's seeing what you're doing and you are causing this church to not move forward with God because of your sins if you do not repent you will die just like aen did it's in your hands God God is such a merciful god that he always gives you the choice to choose between him and not and and God is a gentleman he's never going to force you to repent God is never going to force you to repent he gives you the choice you know I remember in the Bible says choose you is day whom you will serve a choice that you have brother bam is not going to choose this for you that's why he preach on the message the choosing of a bride too in that in the message says that we we have even we have to pray for the choice of a bride of a church of anything we do in our Liv preach the message time of decisions he did not just he didn't not pray those message just for fun you have a choice choose you this day who you will serve either you're going to continue to serve that spirit either you're going to continue to serve those demons either either you're going to serve you're going to worship those demons or you will serve God I'm not going to force you to choose but I know that for me me and my house for myself I choose the Lord I will serve the Lord you need to come to that resolution you need to come to that to that position where you choose the Lord then he fights your battles then he stands between you and evil Just Like a Pill of fire stood between the Egyptians and the children of God he is the same yesterday today and forever if you obey the voice of the angel that pillow fire that you're seeing on that picture is going to stand between you and Satan even when you go to work Satan is going to battle you when you go shopping Satan is going to battle you Satan is not after his own people he's after you the prophet says that all the weapons of hell are at the the bride of Christ so Satan is using his best weapons and targeting it to you the prophet said that if Satan is not after you then he's already got you so all these resources are targeting at you stop looking at your neighbor look at you you a target of the devil but if you obey the voice of the Angel nothing for me for Forge against you shall prosper he'll stand between you just like he stood with the children of Israel even when there's a destruction that's coming up on the earth the angel of the Lord is going to come down and take you and hide you in the secret place I think the David says he shall hide me in his Pavilion but the only comes when you listen to the voice of God those are the benefits of listening to the voice of theel choose you this day um whom you will serve but I know that I choose to serve the Lord you know this morning you need to come to the resolution that I I come to church for myself first I don't care if my brother don't want to get his Blessing I want to get my bless Jacob when he met the angel of the Lord he said I'm not leaving you till you give me my blessings this message came with blessings don't fall short of those blessings the prophet says that many times we don't have things because we are afraid to ask God for those things the prophet say ask God for big things don't fall short don't be you have benefits with believing this message if you receive the prophet as a prophet then you receive his reward as well and his reward was that nothing shall stand against his prayer if you put the word of God in your mouth you accept the word of God in your heart I'm here to tell you that nothing will stand against your prayer you have loved ones that you want to be saved speak the word and they're going to come back because there's a place where the Prophet says that that same voice of God you know the same way the prophet is a voice of God to us we also become the voice of God to the world the voice is in the pr the move did not just stop with William Bram brother Bram says that you might kill this the man you can kill the man but you never going to kill the message brother bam said it's taped it's put on those tapes Brothers these tapes are not words of a man it's a word of the Angel of the [Applause] Lord have a habit of listening to the message listen to The Prophet at home that's when you get your blessings I've heard testimonies of people get getting healed while listening to the prayer line because why why because God is never the god of the past but he always the I am these ts are not just for the past it's the living bread Living Word of God if it could change the life of prostitutes in the in the time of brother Bram can also change your lives If he if you could give other people the Holy Ghost he will give you the Holy Ghost Jesus Is Not Dead Jesus is Alive and the voice is not in is now in the bride the only way the world can see Jesus is through you the Bible says be ye the light of the world but the Bible says that the light is the word of God manifested the word of God made flesh there's Darkness all over the Earth but the prophet says that God always keeps a witness why can't that be me why can that be me I want to be the witness I want to be the witness for God the only way the world will see God they're going to see God through you the light of God shine in your life as as much as you are exposed to the Sun the Sun is going to change you just stay exposed to the Lord Jesus Christ is going to change you to those Tes it's not a ties of man amen amen I'm going to read this one course real quick amen in the message my commission message myiss to wrap up soon the prophet says I am just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you when the Ang of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you no remember the prophet says that Moses had times that he was Moses and there were times he became God to the people so when you listen to this St you got to be able to tell the difference pay attention to this quote this this quot is a very example of the um of that topic so right after the prophet said that he said maybe if I offended you by saying that forgive me so now this is William BR I'm speaking he saying if I offended you by saying that forgive me I felt that my has been resented but I'm God's voice to you and he said see I say that again and he said he said that time that was under inspiration he said I felt bad about it the first time but that voice repeated again he wasn't the prophet who said I'm God's voice to you the angel of the Lord using a man's voice he said I am God's voice to you William Bram the man said I'm sorry if I offended you but the angel of the Lord said don't be sorry I am God's voice to [Music] you so this message is is the voice of God to you and and and the voice of God is a person the voice of God is a person the Bible says that the voice of God was walking amen God bless you the voice of God is a person that pill of fire is a person that same pill of fire that appeared to Moses he appeared in our days in 1963 and if you can project the the image you know so Moses wanted to see the face of God Moses wanted to see the glory of God but was like I'm reserving this for special people in the end time there shall be some people that shall see my voice my face in the time of Moses to see the face of God meant death but where are you not dead you have seen the face of God you have seen the face of God can you project that picture please am amen uh it's a picture we don't have a cloud a picture of a cloud here it's right in front yeah but this one is not really the one I want um I give you a picture there um all right but yeah I'll get back to you while you guys figure it out um so Abraham also heard the voice Abraham heard the voice and he trusted the voice Abraham had never seen the voice but he trusted the voice and because he trust the voice told him to get out of idol worship he never saw that voice and he and then that's what the voice of God will do to you the voice of God will always bring you out of that bad position that you were in Lazarus was another person who who heard the voice of God Lazarus was dead four days you know and his body started corrupting but it did not matter which condition Lazarus was in brothers and sisters it doesn't matter what condition you are in the voice of God will resurrect you the voice of God will change you you just need to listen to the voice of God so Abraham heard the voice of God but one day he saw three men three men coming to him and the prophet says that when you heard one of the Angels said where is thy wife Sarah the prophet says that Abraham recognized the voice he said it was the same voice that spoke to me all those times William Bram also when he was a kid he heard a voice he never seen the voice he heard the voice the voice telling him you shall not drink you shall not defile your body but there was one time he seen the voice let me just read that quotes real [Music] quick okay one second okay so in the message gifts and calling all without repentance just keep you can put the quot and we'll get to this picture so the prophet says he's describing the experience when he met the angel of the Lord he said I was studying I was sing in my study I seen the light spread out on the floor he came walking to me he looked like a man that weighed 200 lb and this light was just above me and he had his arms folded he had a look as you don't see on on the face of a mortal he looked very calm and quiet and then he says his voice when he spoke I knew it was the same voice that I had spoke that had spoke all down through life's journey but I had never seen his face you know he heard the voice so just like Abraham William Bram also heard the voice he trusted the voice but he had never seen the face there got to be I feel like there's something special about seeing the face because Moses also wanted to see the face and William me said I I knew the voice but I never seen the the face and I'll he says and and he says and he say and and when paragraph 18 He said do not fear when that voice spoke I knew it was the same one so this light that you see on these pictures is the same fire that appeared to Moses in the burning bush it's the same fire that stood between evil and good the children of Israel and the Egyptian the same light that Jesus said I come from God and I'm returning back to God it's the same lights that Paul met on the way to Damascus we have a special message in our hands the same God of Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus Christ of the New Testament he's alive and well Among Us in the Old Testament seeing the face meant death but you go back to that picture okay yeah and then I'll read this you keep this picture so the prophet in the message it is the rising of the sun he said if you'll just turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's Christ it's the word made flesh this is not any other being this is Christ and he said see his eyes looking I'm asking you this morning are you guys seeing the eyes of God you know just as perfect as he could be perfect per wearing the white wig of supreme authority and judge all of all Heavens in Earth he came down as a judge Supreme judge so the devil cannot condemn you anymore because God is both judge and a lawyer Jesus is saying that I they never did this in the first place charge against God's elect I I will never I will not remember the sins anymore supreme authority and he says can you see his eyes you know can you see his nose can you see his mouth and the Bible say the T says the congregation says [Music] amen so you you are are witness if you cannot see don't say Amen but if you can see his eyes say amen God is telling you that this message is the truth this message is the voice of God to you this message is the grace of God Mes in the Old Testament he came with two tables with a message of law but brother Bram brought us a message of Grace and I'll qu I'll end with this quote thanks for being patient with me I skipped quite a lot of things here the prophet says in the message blind barus paragraph 323 he says I challenge your faith to that don't believe me believe him cuz I'm just a man just like this microphone it isn't a microphone you're hearing it's my voice and he says it isn't me that you are hearing it's him so when you when you press play on those tapes it's not William Bram that you're hearing it's God that you are hearing the Bible says that men shall not live by bread alone but they shall live by every word that proceed every word we've said a lot of amens this morning but we got to start coming to church on time every word that's life to you you know because God God doesn't waste his word God doesn't just say things just to for the sake of saying it no and the this one other quotes um it's a small quote too okay um in the message the Waters of Separation The Prophet says someday I got to meet you everyone and Alm Mighty God knows that that light that you seen on that picture so I'm speaking to you this morning that light that you see on that picture is standing not two feet from where I am right now he said that's the truth you got to have the attitude of heading right say it's nothing else but the truth by you acknowledging the truth it just pleases God so much that he has to come down and blesses you God loves when you say Amen to his word he's like ask whatever you want right just said it's nothing else but the truth but but God told her that anything you want I'll give it to you and the prophet said it is moving into my right side and then in another quote he says and while I'm talking about it that same light that's on that picture it's not standing not two feet from where I'm standing right now I can't see it with my eyes but I know it's standing here and he said I know it's settling within me right now he said oh if you could only know the difference when the power of almighty God he says and how things look different that's why he was able to say I take every Spirit under my control he was the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord wasn't there just there to to protect the man he was there to protect the message as well wherever the message of the hour is preached the angel of the Lord is there so when the angel of the Lord is there it's up to you to believe and when you believe there is a reward that comes with believing that the reward is ask what you will and it shall be given God is not putting any limits Jesus is a just God if he did it for heing right he will do it for you if you believe the message of the hour and then you also say it's nothing else but the truth God is telling you ask what you will it will be given to you if you want money you ask what you will it will be given to you if you need a good health you ask what you will it will be given to you even if you want intelligence at school ask what you will it will be given to you you want a pay grade ask what you will it will be given to you you are fall short of because of yourself don't put that on God God said ask anything that you want give it to you amen amen God bless [Applause] you may God bless brother list for for the [Music] preaching was so wonderful Blessed assurance [Music] a Jesus Jesus is power for f all GL
