for you this morning but because I had the dedication and because I had um the service to go to last night we switched places by the grace of God um but don't get me wrong I'm happy to be here amen let's let's go to Ephesians the second chapter please I know you all are tired so we're going to try to keep you long it's always amen not to keep you long ago I probably won't keep you long that's the way it works Ephesians 2 efficiency beginning at the fourth verse glad to have everybody here foreign but God who is rich in Mercy university did I say what verse I'm sorry Ephesians 2 4-10 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with us he loved us um even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved or France and have raised up raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ that in the ages to come he might show see this is what I like right here listen to this because this is this is us this is who we are this is the second song that in the age to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus Christ and I for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of God is not a works unless any man should boast s for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works [Music] which God hath before ordained that we should walk in there the Book of Revelation please apocalypse we're going to read the fifth chapter there will start at the 11th verse of the fifth chapter foreign and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands of thousands it is saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and are all in are in them heard I say blessings and honor and glory and power be unto him that seated upon the throne and upon the lamb forever and ever again and the four amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for being so good to us thank you Lord for all that you've done for us you kept us throughout the day you blessed us with natural blessings right now you're blessing us and we appreciate that yeah bless the service in a special way be careful give me the Praise Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated you know my my subject this morning is the is the power of Grace that may not sound uh message to you it may not even sound deep to you okay but in my walk with Jesus Christ come to find out that Grace is a revelation Revelation and true Grace will bring you to your knees let me say that again true Grace revelation of Grace [Music] when we think about the open book or the opening of the word we must come to understand that God has taken us to another level we're not on the level of the Pentecostals but God has moved us into the headstone Ministry where not only do we have the ability to understand the New Testament but we Now understand the Old Testament and we have come to find out that the god of the Old Testament is the god of the news Hallelujah and the only way we have come to see this is because the grace of God came to this generation in the form of a man called William Brothers now many people may not be able to understand that but God always work through men whenever he wants to do something he works through men for example for example in the days of Noah when God wanted to show Grace to a wicked age he raised up a man by the name of Noah and Noah had the Plan of Salvation Noah no way was the only one that had the plan he ever LeBlanc of salvation when Israel needed the Deliverance out of Egypt God raised up a man by the name of Moses not only did Moses have the power of Supernatural but he had the only plan to Salvation hallelujah amen Pharaoh didn't have it Janice and jambres didn't have it Moses was the only one God the heavenly instructions put the blood on the doorpost and the Lennon everybody dulmont that was ordained of God for the grace of God hallelujah did as Moses said Hallelujah and by doing so long the death angel passed hallelujah amen now when I talk about the power of His grace because Grace really is an action word it is something that God do for us by definition they said the unmerited favor of God and when God brings grace to you he acts it out Hallelujah he just doesn't drop the word grace in your head but he acts it out so much you know it's Grace Hallelujah whatever goodness and the power of Grace when it is truly seen Eleven will change you exactly is that right is it correct you say what are you talking about the power of Grace found a woman caught in adultery Hallelujah wanted to kill her grace stepped in you hear what I'm saying he was worthy of death but God I like that but God stepped in hallelujah amen and he wrote on the ground see what I'm saying that Grace whatever the grace is given to you they sometimes stand in awe in bewilderment it's hard for them to believe that they have escaped the situation the quack is because they know they should meet death to meet life Hallelujah I don't know about you I just know where God brought me from [Music] how many times I dodge bullets hallelujah amen at the time I should have been killed by a drunken driver yeah at a time when my my SUV hydroplane yeah and I should have been ship traffic Hallelujah she wait when God comes along he hides himself behind Badger's skin hallelujah amen now remember Grace is not always given to everybody Hallelujah is that right when the when when the Ark of the Covenant was founded uh captured by the Philistines God said I take up to Europe y'all hear what I'm saying wait a second with that same Arc man life to Israel hallelujah amen listen we know about the grace of God we don't deserve to be called Brides Hallelujah let me see your hand if you walk perfectly today we are constantly asking Hallelujah [Applause] why he's rich in Mercy am I that means he he doesn't have the ability to run out of it yeah in a paper from a monkey for he's great the Bible said his love he loved us I didn't ask him you didn't ask him to love him but he loves you make here for them so when the devil tried to make you doubt him why don't you give that devil a praise service you need to start telling the Devils good God has been to you Hallelujah when he accuses you it was a kiss or accuses God you're like he's here about not loving you yeah like it's true just tell the devil I've got the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen I have heard the message hallelujah amen when you hear the message that is the grace of God everybody everybody came here here everybody can't hear it but you have ears they're here blessed because you can hear it now I'm not talking about sound I'm not talking about sounds I mean you can hear it hallelujah amen you love the Lord in the Book of Revelation apocalypse I had had never seen this scripture in the light uh sit there then I see it now sit uh foreign worship and when John began to worship maybe maybe you all have seen this but for me it took to another level 11 by faith on a higher planes and the reason how it did that he had to bring me low in Heavenly places right where the Lord was seniority and here they acknowledge that every honor hour they had ever received in this life goes to the lamb you know what I'm saying so it changed my position it made me think okay I'm gonna run this race for his glory I'm gonna run this race I'm gonna run this race hallelujah amen so that he can see my blessings because he is blessed somebody help me amen is she to just change my mind Revelation is very difficult to explain when the word it brought me to a place to where I'll know right I'm not looking for no glory from man they were saying Lord this is everything this place that I'm standing in is all right I did nothing nothing to receive it yeah I'm experiencing right now it's because of what you did it was the bloody Lamb of God [Music] it was a bloody Lamb of God it was Christ Jesus everything belongs to him hallelujah amen see that's what brother Hallelujah you understand me hallelujah amen oh God just to think God himself Judy man according to the word of this hour is now dwelling in human beings [Music] see we we really don't even know how to worship God until God comes in says that's why he gives you his holy spirit because it's Christ in you worshiping himself he saw him oh God help us Jesus God worshiping God Hallelujah the perfect worship [Music] hallelujah amen and we don't even realize that's literally the blood of the Lamb that's why the Bible wants you to be anointed [Music] signifying to you that you're being covered by the blood yeah amen is that right yes brother Brandon said I can't do nothing foreign [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah this was not a second person Hallelujah and what was it what was it he was the first fruit of his kinds meaning I'm one of them yeah man hallelujah amen coming from the message coming from the message conference conference 1961. 14. I'm going to read from paragraph one or two every man and woman down through the age every Prophet every person always went upon those principles job stood firm on it job job stood for firm on it the only meeting place of Israel was under the shed blood yes [Music] the only place the Shekinah Glory fell was under the shed blood blessings [Music] place that the Shekinah Glory will come he said don't let me hurt your feelings uh Baptist Liberty Presbyterian but the only place that is your kind of Glory falls under the blood that's the reason you feel this Shekinah Pentecostal Glory wait a minute that's the reason you feel this Shekinah Pentecostal Glory it's because it's under the blood of the shared blood of the Son of God back when he took his kids and we come into the presence of God the Shekinah Glory where His blessings oh he said it makes a new man out of home if you say I'm under the Shekinah Glory set the speed and there is no change something is wrong because when you under the Shekinah Glory brings change so not my words those are his words Aaron left his Rod there one year dead sinner hey amen now can you see the grace of God hallelujah amen why because the grace of God not only give you knowledge wisdom Hallelujah [Music] Satan can trick you okay do you have the people who can make you think you got something prepare for fair Hallelujah [Applause] amen let me tell y'all something Hallelujah [Music] thank you Jesus you know we did we didn't know who we really were foreign I don't know about you but in in my earlier days of church I grew up as a Baptist from the Baptist I went to the Apostolic and I was always trying to save myself y'all something else y'all did um but let me say it like this man listen watch this I always no matter what I wasn't good enough to be saved I even though I I would be I'm saved is every time I would look at my life I couldn't see him I made too many mistakes [Music] why I was different from all of my brothers and sisters out of all my mother's children that believe and see this message that's something to shout about hallelujah amen and I never understood anymore somebody help me here at mic now I know and Paul said it like this for in him we live basket and have our being hallelujah amen it was God [Music] you would not be here amen forget about how bad hallelujah amen but he came to rescue him y'all better hear what I'm saying see this gives me so much [Music] it says Bishops when I meet the message Bishops [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying it sets that's his grace that's it the Bible says that Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the head of the church you know any other scripture yes but that's the scripture oh yeah we he put men in place but he let me put it this way when John gone Jean put his way when brother Brandon gone forever or John the bride how it fell down to worship the angel he said get up worship God I love you y'all hear what I'm saying there's only one I'm going to worship God and you know what his name is Lord Jesus Christ [Music] this bloody bleeding word has given me Grace to know who I am where I came from and where I'm going um [Music] nothing can stop this journey and nothing can stop your journey it's not what you do for him it's what he's done for you hallelujah amen y'all understand what I'm saying now this is one that really caught me what the scripture says for as much then for as much then we As We Are The Offspring of God um how many of y'all believe y'all The Offspring of God spring okay I'm glad everybody should have raised your hands did you feel like it you should have raised your hand because if you ain't The Offspring of God what does it make you The Offspring of what I said I'll spring in the devil so I'm gonna stand up I'm The Offspring of God hallelujah amen he said wait a minute brother you don't look like it but you don't know the stage of my growth yeah it's the stage of my growth you don't know the stage maybe I'm not perfect yet y'all believe in maturity absolutely now just picture me man how's your reservations what I look like but if I can imagine myself looking like one of my sons little shoulders nothing was was it seemed equality like that image [Music] you see it keeps growing until I come to that maturity with the DNA of God quick as that seed only thing brother Brandon said we must remain in the presence of the sun we must lay in the presence of the sun this is hello amen you must eat this message hallelujah amen and I'm not talking about with irreverence a lot of people try to listen to the message irreverently um that the voice of God is on those tapes I'm not talking about no man I'm alive let me tell y'all an experience so you can see I always ask God lord show me

badger anybody let's work with culture have you ever seen Hawaiians people from Hawaii and they have those grass skirts his own says is that allowed in church but that's their culture can they do that to a gospel song thank you when it comes to God there is no culture there's only one and his civilization is totally different from this one to reflect his civilization the glory [Music] hallelujah amen just so you know so you don't have to worry about what brother Brooks is thinking when he see you like that um thank you for the sinners I can't give you Revelation I can't give it that God gives you that is I'm gonna use this one more time to let you go but I was in uh Toledo Ohio Toledo this is an Apostolic Church where Holiness used to be a priority and I'm in the message they gave me opportunity to preacher and Bishops sitting all up in their High seats they call these girls out and they had on biker shorts hello y'all know what biker shorts is they had on biker shorts and and they were singing a song we we walk like Jesus shot they was walking like Jesus foreign eat on you Hallelujah that you would let these girls every red blood man would have a problem with that is a God does not represent sexy anything you do that promotes your sex Hallelujah that's why the devil is out there doing that One More Shot they're glorifying sex everything sex two seconds you can't glorify God looking forward amen for all have sinned two seconds can come short of the glory of God don't get me wrong I was that way too I had everything when I was in the world when I was in the world I'm almost done I made sure I had that cologne uh that attractive colon when you walk by any sister [Music] they go what is that oh the professor y'all brothers know what I'm talking about go act like you're innocent yeah you put it on Cheers Hallelujah but once I got saved may God be wrong I wear Jordans but there are certain colognes that are built yes attention that's the kind you stay away from whatever Vermont go home and throw it away I know it's expensive Jessica Lord help us Jesus now I'm almost done I'm almost done but I want you to understand the power of Grace being justified freely you're caught in the act of sin you don't deserve his Mercy but he gives you his grace Man United and in this Grace he justifies you you hear me and brother Brandon said it like this he justifies us so much we're so Justified if we never sinned in the first place but she that don't apply to you if you don't have the Holy Ghost please the Holy Ghost is your Covenant the Holy Ghost is your unconditional Covenant amen amen so when we see that we've been Justified president said it like this we the bride do not go to the Judgment hey why because his grace has Justified us [Music] what's up you ought to know this you ought to know I don't I don't why do brother books travel down here to be what well you know most people don't even know we're here you understand what I'm saying you bring me here God brings me here I don't pick on you but when he when he brings it out of me I have no control of it that's him I know that if I say something I'm saying it without if I say something I can't even call someone a jezebel yeah if I'd say something like that his inspiration I am in trouble that's what the problem God said look he said don't you say that unless you've been inspired to say it Hallelujah I can't just say things cause I feel like seeing them no I want you to think for a moment think on this what is heaven worth listen what is heaven worth to you lessiel represents what what is this Rapture worth to you we need to wake up to the freedom that God has given to us not free to sin but free to glorify God hallelujah amen I love the Lord and I appreciate his this mystery that was here through all all the ages he has dropped the Revelation into our hearts how can you not be excited amen amen let me say is somebody you're going to be tried and you're going to really be tested not just here in America all over the world things are changing it shows change and you should be changing don't you let the devil I have no circumstances stop you from completing this journey and God would allow people to do you wrong he'll make people lie on you just to see what you'll do with it he'll make people cheat just to see how you do with it now if you be a lamb I I you know um let's say it like this the shepherd Never follow the Sheep it is and when anything gets out of place of Judgment of God will fall whether it be in a church whether it be at home or just whether it be in your personal lives because [Music] there's an order and the reason why we live the way we live yeah and Adam broke the order basket and when you break the order with God over you
