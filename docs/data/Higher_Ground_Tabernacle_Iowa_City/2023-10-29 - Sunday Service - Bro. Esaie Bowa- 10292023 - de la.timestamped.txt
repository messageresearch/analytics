[42:35] church I would like to title my sermon
[42:38] this
[42:40] morning the church and his
[42:44] [Music]
[42:48] commission if you pay attention close
[42:50] pay attention to Mark
[42:53] [Music]
[42:55] 16
[43:01] you said that the Lord appeared to the
[43:03] 11 disciple where they were at the
[43:09] table and he reproached them about the
[43:12] this their
[43:15] unbelieved why is the Lord talking about
[43:17] condemn their
[43:21] unbelief because they didn't believe
[43:23] those who saw him
[43:25] risen
[43:28] you can see in our
[43:35] uht there were women who saw that the
[43:37] Lord was
[43:40] Raising there was Mary of magdala and
[43:43] Mary Mary
[43:45] magdal there was salom
[43:50] also those who went to the Tom to put
[43:53] some uh
[43:55] spices
[43:58] and when when they got the tomb and the
[44:00] tomb was
[44:03] open and they started wondering why the
[44:05] grave was
[44:08] open and the Bible say they saw an angel
[44:11] of
[44:12] God who was sitting on at the
[44:17] Rock and he told them why are you
[44:19] looking the living among the
[44:22] dead said return and say to this that is
[44:26] not
[44:29] here that is's going to meet them in
[44:32] Jerusalem and the women went
[44:36] back they told the other that the Lord
[44:38] has
[44:40] risen but they didn't believe
[44:44] in even those two
[44:48] disciple the Lord appeared to
[44:51] them and they had a
[44:54] conversation and at the
[44:58] evening the Lord did
[45:01] something that he did before
[45:04] he it was the broken of the
[45:08] brain and the way he broke
[45:12] up that's why they recognized that there
[45:14] was the
[45:16] Lord and when they
[45:21] recognized they went back to
[45:24] Jerusalem to the
[45:27] disciple that the Lord is
[45:32] risen even though they brought the
[45:34] message of
[45:36] res thep didn't believe on
[45:42] it unbel to the the resurrection of the
[45:46] [Music]
[45:48] Lord even if the when the Lord appeared
[45:51] to
[45:54] them and he started to blame
[45:59] them condemn them upon their
[46:03] Inc the
[46:07] say that he appeared to the
[46:12] 11 he condemn their
[46:15] unbelief and the disbelief of their
[46:22] heart because they didn't believe those
[46:24] who who saw him
[46:26] rais then he told
[46:28] them go
[46:33] all preach the good news to the
[46:36] old who
[46:38] that shall be
[46:40] baptized will
[46:45] Beed will
[46:50] beem these are the miracle that shall go
[46:53] with those
[46:54] believe
[46:56] in my name they shall
[46:58] cast they shall speak with
[47:01] new they shall take up
[47:03] [Music]
[47:05] serpent if they should drink any deadly
[47:09] thing it shall not inure
[47:12] them they shall L their hands upon
[47:16] the and the sick will
[47:19] be that's the Lord
[47:22] himself as he said himself
[47:27] that word has to be the
[47:30] truth there's nothing that can change
[47:32] that
[47:34] word because it's the Lord Jesus
[47:39] Christ SP the word by his
[47:43] mou I believe that word is so anointed
[47:49] morning that word has that same
[47:53] power to accomplish to fulfill the Mir
[47:57] yes brothers and
[47:59] sisters and they were preach
[48:02] everywhere the Lord work with
[48:07] him and confirming the word by the sons
[48:09] following upon
[48:11] him as I said this
[48:15] morning I want to speak about the church
[48:17] and his
[48:19] commission what is a
[48:22] commission when I went to the
[48:24] dictionary
[48:26] said a
[48:29] commission it's a message that they give
[48:32] to
[48:35] someone it's a service did to
[48:40] someone or it's a
[48:44] mission we G speak about a church and it
[48:48] commission are we right this
[48:53] morning I believe we have to be uh ready
[48:58] ready so that we understand where the
[49:00] spirit is bringing
[49:04] us now
[49:07] [Music]
[49:08] listen I'd like us to verify check and
[49:12] think about this
[49:13] verse the Bible
[49:17] says and he appeared to the
[49:20] 11 where they at the
[49:24] table reproach them upon their
[49:28] unbelief
[49:30] remember in Matthew
[49:33] 10 some Pro
[49:39] itth the Lord
[49:43] himself who's choosing his
[49:47] disciples he chose his
[49:51] disci
[49:54] real
[49:56] the same disciple that he chose in
[50:00] Matthew when he chose them in Matthew
[50:04] 10 also
[50:06] Judah but he
[50:10] s he kep them his first
[50:13] commission around the
[50:18] word only preached to the lost sheep of
[50:24] Israel only preached to the Lost of the
[50:28] Bible
[50:30] says so they went accomplishing
[50:33] miring
[50:37] sick because the Lord has G them the
[50:40] commission and he told
[50:42] them when you shall go
[50:45] there and tell them the kingdom of
[50:48] God preach the good
[50:51] go heal the
[50:53] sick Dem that's what they
[50:59] did it was Matthew
[51:18] 10ap from the first
[51:23] verse and he called to his 12
[51:32] and them authority over
[51:36] unle and to cast them out and to heal
[51:39] every disease
[51:41] andity the names of the 12
[51:45] disciples the first Simon was
[51:48] called Andel his
[51:51] brother and when we go down to to to
[51:59] you see that there was also Judas isar
[52:01] the one
[52:05] who where they said
[52:09] Judas so Judah is
[52:12] among the Lord himself
[52:16] chose and he knew that Judah was betray
[52:19] but he chose him
[52:21] anyway now we can
[52:23] say as Jud that was there it was not a
[52:29] problem he was
[52:33] already now in
[52:36] Mark Judah is
[52:39] already the Lord has already
[52:42] risen even if the Lord
[52:45] is Judah was
[52:51] not and the Bible say he started condemn
[52:54] them according to the
[52:57] the disciple were
[52:59] still
[53:03] disbel and the Lord started rebuke them
[53:07] with their
[53:09] disbelief what I want to say I want to
[53:12] say
[53:15] this being baptized in water it's not
[53:21] enough when you baptized in water
[53:25] it's not
[53:28] enough there's something
[53:32] else more than being just being baptized
[53:34] in
[53:37] waters and he said that
[53:42] now why have you been
[53:47] disbelieved the lady told you that I was
[53:49] RIS but you didn't believe you didn't
[53:53] believe
[53:54] it
[53:57] they were
[53:59] disbelief I want you to
[54:02] understand there were
[54:05] Apostles not only any kind of
[54:09] AP Apostle of Jesus
[54:13] Christ already
[54:20] accompl you see that when they
[54:22] accomplish
[54:24] miracles and he the Lord was still
[54:27] alive he just chosen
[54:30] them they
[54:32] accomplish Judah also accomplished
[54:35] Miracles he the one that betrayed the
[54:38] Lord he went with the
[54:40] 12 when they came back they said
[54:45] Lord
[54:48] theey their
[54:52] Spirit the Lord knowing that Judah that
[54:56] was
[54:58] say do not
[55:01] rejoice but the fact that the
[55:07] spirit that your
[55:10] name is written in the book in
[55:16] heaven the fact of casting out the
[55:20] spirit didn't make them being
[55:24] saved
[55:27] brothers and
[55:28] S so they were
[55:31] unbel were unbeliever
[55:35] person but in which the
[55:37] Lord and revealed to them and told
[55:42] him go around the
[55:44] world preach a good
[55:47] gospel and him
[55:51] that the one that will believe and be
[55:54] bed shall be
[55:56] saved whom that will not will be
[56:00] condemned and the Bible say he
[56:06] said these are the signs shall follow
[56:08] those those that
[56:11] believe he could
[56:14] say these are the
[56:16] that but he didn't
[56:18] say because they were still unbelief he
[56:22] says when you be will be
[56:30] now these are the sin that shall follow
[56:31] those that have
[56:37] believed in my name they shall cast out
[56:41] demons they shall take up
[56:45] serpents they shall speak new
[56:50] tongues drink any
[56:53] dead will not injure
[56:57] them they they will take up
[57:01] serpents the serpent would not do
[57:04] anything to
[57:05] them they will lay their hands
[57:08] up they will L their hands upon the SE
[57:12] and they shall be
[57:14] well the Lord himself that promised and
[57:18] the
[57:20] church the commission that the church
[57:22] has received that that there is
[57:26] that's the base
[57:28] of if there's a gathering of people who
[57:32] are called
[57:34] Church they need to have these things
[57:36] among
[57:37] them they don't have these
[57:40] things then it's no longer called
[57:47] church church
[57:50] and the job The Works
[57:53] that the message that the church
[57:57] re the service The Works that the church
[57:59] has to
[58:00] do preach a good
[58:03] gospel lay their hands
[58:06] onck speak new
[58:09] Tong take up
[58:13] serpents there's anything
[58:15] deadly if there's
[58:19] any will not
[58:22] them that's a church
[58:27] and as long as
[58:29] there's we're not supposed to say that
[58:31] there's a
[58:33] church it will only be a gathering
[58:36] of who didn't know what to do on
[58:40] Sunday and just came to GA in a
[58:43] building just to waste their
[58:46] time and to show off how good they were
[58:53] dress
[58:56] let me say the way I want to
[58:58] say because the church has
[59:01] forgotten the church has
[59:07] forgotten the church has forgotten what
[59:09] the
[59:13] Lord the the church has started
[59:16] teaching and all kind
[59:19] of all these things that bring
[59:23] nothing even if they
[59:26] teaching and when they're teaching those
[59:28] missst it's really
[59:34] wrong the work of the
[59:37] church is to go
[59:39] around preach the
[59:43] gospel him that shall and will be Bap
[59:47] shall be
[59:48] saved that shall not he'll be
[59:52] condemned prophet
[59:58] lived in this
[1:00:00] country the Lord has used them a
[1:00:03] lot to bring forth a message of
[1:00:06] repentance he could go to a town and
[1:00:09] have
[1:00:11] meeting 20,000 people believe in the
[1:00:14] Lord and create a church down
[1:00:17] there when he comes back next
[1:00:21] year he couldn't even find 20 people in
[1:00:24] church
[1:00:29] when Paul used to go
[1:00:32] preach and if there was one person that
[1:00:35] beli the person would stay
[1:00:39] there
[1:00:42] when he found
[1:00:45] over so one
[1:00:48] person
[1:00:50] brings and that makes 30 people in a
[1:00:54] year bil
[1:00:56] bilam with his
[1:00:59] message he could have 20,000 people next
[1:01:03] year no more to
[1:01:07] people no I want to ask you this
[1:01:11] question this church how how long this
[1:01:13] church has
[1:01:15] been it could be8 to 9 years now take 9
[1:01:20] to8 to nine
[1:01:23] years
[1:01:24] let's say that that there was only one
[1:01:26] person that believed in this
[1:01:28] church multiply by the number
[1:01:33] years if he's a truly
[1:01:36] believer bring forth bring it 29 people
[1:01:40] so in a year we have 30
[1:01:43] people and the five
[1:01:46] years we will have 150 people in this
[1:01:50] place in eight
[1:01:52] years we have two 240 people in this
[1:01:56] same
[1:01:57] place now look at what we
[1:02:00] are and understand the mission that we
[1:02:03] have how did we treat the
[1:02:07] word how did we conduct ourselves with
[1:02:10] the
[1:02:11] word we not even 50s
[1:02:16] here why is the church now invol uh
[1:02:20] moving growing
[1:02:23] because
[1:02:25] it's because people have jumped skipped
[1:02:27] the
[1:02:28] St people make uh uh uh pretend to
[1:02:34] believe but they didn't really
[1:02:44] believe so if you
[1:02:49] understand this church should have have
[1:02:51] over 500 people because as you sit
[1:02:57] in you already been here five
[1:03:02] years you should already bring five
[1:03:06] 150 and if those 150 people are not here
[1:03:09] this
[1:03:11] morning I don't know if I can call you a
[1:03:18] Believer let me read what says about
[1:03:21] believer what is a believer
[1:03:50] now he
[1:03:52] said just want to
[1:03:55] so you understand you understand what
[1:03:58] the prophet God said about
[1:04:03] believer why do we call this person a
[1:04:10] believer in the message uh fighting
[1:04:14] uh fighting for the F fighting for the
[1:04:17] faith that was transm once for the
[1:04:22] Saints this is inag
[1:04:26] 71 he says when we see somebody in the
[1:04:30] church who goes to
[1:04:33] church do not bring the C OFA in
[1:04:36] church it's already the
[1:04:40] season so
[1:04:45] a even one day if I'm not long
[1:04:51] here if it's the will of God that I'm
[1:04:53] some somewhere
[1:04:56] else because we are passenger and
[1:04:58] Stranger In This
[1:04:59] World Paul
[1:05:02] went and one day you will remember me
[1:05:05] and he used to tell
[1:05:08] us don't bring the Cod of Ian
[1:05:11] Church
[1:05:15] okay let the Lord help us this
[1:05:19] morning so that the C of AA do not find
[1:05:21] his place here listen
[1:05:25] says we say
[1:05:28] that these are the sign of a
[1:05:32] Believer because he comes to
[1:05:34] church is a good
[1:05:36] man
[1:05:39] he he pays his
[1:05:42] debt I have nothing to say about
[1:05:46] it he educate his children that's good
[1:05:50] it's
[1:05:52] wonderful I have nothing to say say
[1:05:54] about but the prophet
[1:05:58] say but that's not the sign of a
[1:06:02] Believer not even preach the
[1:06:06] evang that's not a sign of a
[1:06:09] Believer Jesus
[1:06:14] said he said these are the miracle that
[1:06:17] shall I be with those that are
[1:06:20] believe in my name they shall cast demon
[1:06:24] they will speak new
[1:06:26] tongues they will catch up
[1:06:31] serpents even if they drink
[1:06:35] any that would not hurt
[1:06:39] them they lay their hands on the
[1:06:42] sick and the sick shall be
[1:06:47] well and brother says these are the sons
[1:06:49] of believer he say but today
[1:06:55] let's try to to preach it or to do
[1:06:59] so they will make fun of
[1:07:02] you they have appearance of
[1:07:05] goodness but they they they they're
[1:07:08] refusing the the the
[1:07:13] strength everybody that is
[1:07:18] Christian have the power to pray for the
[1:07:22] sick every Christian
[1:07:25] anybody that
[1:07:28] believes has the power to pray for the
[1:07:32] sick I want to read somewhere brother
[1:07:37] say that if you have not
[1:07:41] been if you have not been a
[1:07:45] Believer and that those sign that it's
[1:07:48] not
[1:07:49] going and you claim that you're a
[1:07:52] believer
[1:07:55] you just you just made it in your mind
[1:07:56] that you a
[1:07:57] beli you just never
[1:08:00] been but you in order for you to be a
[1:08:04] believer you have to have the the sign
[1:08:07] of Mark
[1:08:08] 16 that's what makes a
[1:08:12] church a church is not just a gathering
[1:08:15] of
[1:08:16] people who don't know what to do on a
[1:08:18] day but the
[1:08:22] church church receed the ministry of the
[1:08:25] Lord
[1:08:26] Jesus the Same Ministry that the
[1:08:30] Lord the same that the churches
[1:08:33] received to continue the
[1:08:37] ministry that's what we have as
[1:08:42] job and those kind of
[1:08:50] message those type of message people
[1:08:52] don't want it anymore
[1:08:55] people want
[1:08:59] Mysteries all type of
[1:09:04] things those things that that doesn't
[1:09:06] even make
[1:09:10] sense says we already
[1:09:13] mature this this is a gospel for
[1:09:16] children little
[1:09:18] kid why do you have to preach us these
[1:09:21] things came
[1:09:25] he Reed the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:09:29] Place didn't receive the holy go for
[1:09:34] you has a
[1:09:38] true he also had to receive the holy
[1:09:43] ghost out of anything God that God has
[1:09:46] done with
[1:09:50] him out of anything that God have
[1:09:53] manifested in
[1:09:56] was a
[1:10:02] Believer he had to receive the Holy
[1:10:06] Ghost to show that he was a type of True
[1:10:11] Believer that's
[1:10:16] why the Holy Ghost we cannot go
[1:10:20] around we can never pretend to be
[1:10:23] Christians
[1:10:26] if we did not go through the experience
[1:10:29] personal experience of the Holy
[1:10:38] Spirit when you not with God you're not
[1:10:40] going to say amen I know
[1:10:45] already you're going to leave this place
[1:10:47] and say what he what was he talking
[1:10:50] about that's the commission of the
[1:10:52] church that's what makes the
[1:10:57] church I'm already tired of this
[1:11:01] chur where I don't see the manifestation
[1:11:03] of
[1:11:04] God I have to be true with
[1:11:08] you I'm already
[1:11:11] tired being in front of
[1:11:15] [Applause]
[1:11:16] people who doesn't even have a shadow of
[1:11:19] God in him I'm already
[1:11:22] tired
[1:11:27] I need a
[1:11:31] church we are people have the
[1:11:33] manifestation of
[1:11:37] spirit when he came down
[1:11:41] in as
[1:11:43] elah he had a message of
[1:11:47] restoration he had to restore the
[1:11:50] heart to the father of Pentecost
[1:11:56] and that's what brother
[1:11:58] did before even bringing
[1:12:02] the restor the
[1:12:05] church to what he was in the
[1:12:08] P that's why our
[1:12:10] message it's a message of
[1:12:13] heart it's a message of
[1:12:15] heart has to touch your
[1:12:18] heart to bring your heart back to the
[1:12:21] pente that's why he said
[1:12:24] El
[1:12:27] come restore the heart of children to
[1:12:30] their
[1:12:31] fathers and that's what Bram
[1:12:37] did now listen to
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] this Jesus is Comm uh commissioning his
[1:12:48] church that's the
[1:12:52] purpose even the goal of the
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:56] church General Orders of Jesus in his
[1:13:01] church was go around world and preach
[1:13:04] the
[1:13:06] gospel everything that we we just
[1:13:10] demonstrated and he spoke to them and
[1:13:13] the Bible
[1:13:16] says between 19 and
[1:13:19] 20 they said
[1:13:22] 20
[1:13:24] read 20 says what he
[1:13:27] say
[1:13:31] Mark and they go forth preach
[1:13:34] everywhere the Lord working with
[1:13:38] them confirming the word by the sons
[1:13:41] following upon
[1:13:43] it before
[1:13:47] going the Lord told him in different he
[1:13:51] said even if I seen
[1:13:55] do not go
[1:13:56] yet stay in
[1:13:59] Jerusalem until you
[1:14:01] receive the Holy
[1:14:04] Ghost go to
[1:14:07] chapter and the Bible
[1:14:10] say the Lord told
[1:14:12] them you receive a
[1:14:16] power the holy ghost coming upon
[1:14:18] you and in that
[1:14:20] time you will be my witness jerusem here
[1:14:24] in Jerusalem Jud in Juda
[1:14:28] Sam all around the
[1:14:32] world so there had to be
[1:14:35] Witnesses being
[1:14:37] witnesses witnesses
[1:14:40] of witnesses of
[1:14:43] Resurrection Witnesses of
[1:14:45] Jesus you couldn't
[1:14:51] be without receiving the the Holy
[1:14:55] Ghost that's why made them
[1:15:00] Witnesses let me say
[1:15:03] clearly we can call wi wi of Jesus
[1:15:08] Christ we do not receive the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost when you receive the Holy
[1:15:14] Ghost that's when you become a truly
[1:15:18] true and that's why you
[1:15:21] receive of the true Witness
[1:15:24] when you
[1:15:26] will you will speak about something that
[1:15:29] You' seen and that you've
[1:15:31] heard something that you
[1:15:38] experienced church was supposed to B be
[1:15:40] based on
[1:15:41] experience you have to question
[1:15:44] yourself since you become a
[1:15:48] Christian what are your experience with
[1:15:50] the
[1:15:51] Lordi what are your
[1:15:56] experiences the Bible
[1:15:58] say David in the Old
[1:16:01] Testament when he had an
[1:16:05] experience
[1:16:08] that the experience of
[1:16:10] David his
[1:16:13] experiences brought him a lot of
[1:16:16] faith that's
[1:16:19] why when he he was in in front of
[1:16:23] he
[1:16:25] said he said the same God that
[1:16:27] delivered
[1:16:29] against and the MTH of the LI
[1:16:36] tonight will deliver me against this
[1:16:39] Philistine why did he say
[1:16:42] that basing upon his
[1:16:46] experience and his experience G him to
[1:16:50] believe that the same God
[1:16:53] who help
[1:16:55] me who will help me with
[1:16:57] this that's
[1:17:01] why experiences are important in
[1:17:04] Christian
[1:17:05] Life yes brothers and
[1:17:08] sisters now he has commissioned his
[1:17:12] church says in this
[1:17:14] message second coming of the Lord say
[1:17:18] now
[1:17:18] no
[1:17:21] today in my
[1:17:26] the scriptures that I just
[1:17:28] read
[1:17:32] Mark is one of the Glorious
[1:17:37] message and the most important to be
[1:17:39] preached
[1:17:42] today when we speak about Mark
[1:17:46] 16 one of the
[1:17:49] Glorious the most
[1:17:51] important can preached
[1:17:59] today so we cannot consider our message
[1:18:03] important because this is the base of
[1:18:06] Christian this is the base of
[1:18:09] Christian this the base of a church
[1:18:13] without church has not a reason to be to
[1:18:20] exist it's really difficult to say
[1:18:24] but it's the
[1:18:32] truth before they reive the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] they were
[1:18:39] unbelief no matter what they did in the
[1:18:41] previous days they were still
[1:18:47] disbel before you receed the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost replace X by his
[1:18:56] value before receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:18:58] who are you
[1:19:04] unbelief because the Lord said that the
[1:19:06] Apostle were were
[1:19:10] unbeliev glory to
[1:19:13] God even if they were
[1:19:16] unbeliev he sent them in
[1:19:19] way but before
[1:19:21] send it say stay there at
[1:19:26] Jerusalem and you will receive the gift
[1:19:28] of the
[1:19:30] spirit a mighty power you and then
[1:19:34] you'll be my
[1:19:36] Witnesses Jerusalem in
[1:19:41] Jud all around the
[1:19:45] world all around the
[1:19:48] word here today
[1:19:50] we God needs winess
[1:19:54] that are around the
[1:19:57] world United States is at the corner of
[1:19:59] the border of the
[1:20:01] world Africa is around the
[1:20:05] world Europe is
[1:20:10] around because he was he was talking
[1:20:13] about the region of
[1:20:15] Jerusalem Judea Jerusalem
[1:20:18] Sam now say not only here but all around
[1:20:21] the world it says everywhere even in
[1:20:24] United States even in Africa even in
[1:20:28] Europe we are all around the
[1:20:30] world brothers
[1:20:33] sisters let me go
[1:20:36] slowly so that I Cann
[1:20:40] l so the Lord may help us to understand
[1:20:43] something that's behind my
[1:20:45] spirit I want the Lord to help us to
[1:20:48] understand
[1:20:50] this says in message
[1:20:53] hear
[1:20:55] him said do not
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:00] be do not think that I'm trying to blame
[1:21:03] you and this
[1:21:06] morning I'm not trying to condemn
[1:21:10] you I'm only trying to tell you the
[1:21:17] truth look the condition of the church
[1:21:20] today the word of for
[1:21:26] that the last Commission of
[1:21:27] Jesus go around the
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:32] world these are the miracle that are go
[1:21:34] with those that I
[1:21:39] believe and the church is going around
[1:21:45] it the church
[1:21:47] has the church has gone around the
[1:21:50] message the commission of the Lord
[1:21:56] the church has gone
[1:21:59] around healing of
[1:22:01] body gift of
[1:22:04] spirit a Pure Life and holy
[1:22:07] life things that the church has gone
[1:22:11] around that's why the church is in this
[1:22:14] condition the church is not improving
[1:22:17] that's why the church is
[1:22:21] dy because they have left that
[1:22:26] aside
[1:22:28] say a message fighting
[1:22:37] for Ander stood and
[1:22:40] say so maybe he didn't take his dinner
[1:22:44] and he
[1:22:45] went and had a
[1:22:48] vision and called all
[1:22:51] his
[1:22:53] eled he called them to his
[1:22:58] house and they sat down and they took
[1:23:01] something to wash the
[1:23:06] uh and they took chair seats and they
[1:23:09] gathered
[1:23:12] together make a little
[1:23:16] bigger make it a little
[1:23:20] bigger can you see from the back
[1:23:25] and
[1:23:29] he and Peter started
[1:23:34] testimony how the Holy Spirit came down
[1:23:37] on the day of the
[1:23:40] Pentecost and Peter said this
[1:23:44] words so the Holy Ghost came down on the
[1:23:47] Gentiles
[1:23:51] says
[1:23:53] this is the faith that was transmitted
[1:23:55] to the SS
[1:23:58] once the holy ghost that came down on
[1:24:04] the that's the faith that was
[1:24:06] transmitted to the SS
[1:24:09] once what
[1:24:11] was that you shall have
[1:24:14] faith when you will receive the Holy
[1:24:18] Ghost before receiving the Holy
[1:24:21] Ghost
[1:24:23] you don't have faith
[1:24:24] in you're not a
[1:24:27] Believer you just been baptized have
[1:24:30] been
[1:24:32] baptized the Holy Ghost came down
[1:24:37] on that's the fa that was transmitted to
[1:24:41] S and they started speaking in
[1:24:44] Tong praising
[1:24:46] Gody
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:51] God and they held the same kind of
[1:24:53] meeting like in the day of
[1:24:56] p i want you to
[1:24:59] notice that when Peter went in cor's
[1:25:03] house those people didn't take a baptism
[1:25:07] of
[1:25:08] water the Holy Ghost came down on
[1:25:13] them they didn't go to the water of
[1:25:16] Bap Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:25:21] them there's a way you can receive the
[1:25:23] Holy
[1:25:25] Ghost without even being
[1:25:28] baptized water
[1:25:30] Bap it's not what saves you the prophet
[1:25:34] God
[1:25:35] say water of
[1:25:38] baptis has no virtues on
[1:25:43] him water of baptis is just
[1:25:50] word if you didn't really
[1:25:55] pain we just going to waste our time
[1:25:57] bringing you to the
[1:26:02] world you are missing time to go to the
[1:26:07] swimming we'll just take you there take
[1:26:09] shower uh you know
[1:26:13] swim and that's that's the job you've
[1:26:15] given
[1:26:17] us instead of going swim by
[1:26:21] yourself
[1:26:23] you take you're taking out all of us to
[1:26:25] see how you swimming in the
[1:26:34] waters and they started speaking in
[1:26:37] Tong without being baptized by
[1:26:43] Waters ever since I've been
[1:26:46] here it's it's difficult to hear
[1:26:49] somebody speaking in
[1:26:51] Tong the the the language that we
[1:26:54] have those tongues that we have is did
[1:26:57] you hear what he did you see what he
[1:27:01] did did you see that child what he
[1:27:04] did that's the tong that we
[1:27:10] speak
[1:27:12] really if you
[1:27:14] see the sign of
[1:27:19] time started speaking about
[1:27:22] that time is
[1:27:26] gone but we have to go to a
[1:27:29] place where we have to stop
[1:27:32] everything ask
[1:27:33] our who am
[1:27:40] I where am I with
[1:27:45] christianis there's two stepe of
[1:27:47] christianism chanis int the intellectual
[1:27:51] christianism
[1:27:55] learn by the knowledge of the
[1:28:02] word and there's an authentic
[1:28:06] christianism but
[1:28:09] many we still in intellectual
[1:28:14] christianism that's what makes the
[1:28:15] church in this
[1:28:18] condition Church looks like a
[1:28:21] sick
[1:28:23] and needs to be transfused with
[1:28:28] blood let me let me
[1:28:36] go when Peter said that they receive the
[1:28:38] Holy Ghost and now he
[1:28:42] said can we now give them the word of
[1:28:49] Bap to those who Reed the holy goes as
[1:28:52] as we
[1:28:53] receive now now we told them go and be
[1:28:57] baptized in the of
[1:29:02] Jesus and he stayed there with them many
[1:29:11] days let's go to something
[1:29:15] else that's why say I read this
[1:29:20] scripture
[1:29:22] when I was speaking about Elijah and
[1:29:24] Elisha excuse me I can remove this
[1:29:35] too says we wear this to honor
[1:29:41] you but our suits are just suit of
[1:29:47] work that's that's SCS work
[1:29:54] if it's too high I ask you if I can
[1:29:55] remove it if you can grant it to
[1:30:01] me it's like it's like I remove my scrub
[1:30:05] that the one I have to work with but
[1:30:06] it's only because it's
[1:30:10] act and today uh suits are become
[1:30:14] something
[1:30:20] else it shows you you see what I
[1:30:25] work it's a design I don't want to say
[1:30:30] names I want to say
[1:30:32] names now
[1:30:34] listen I read this SCP where the
[1:30:38] Prophet I think that a man or woman a
[1:30:42] boy or
[1:30:45] girl with an intellectual conception of
[1:30:48] the
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:50] word
[1:30:52] we never reach a
[1:30:54] perfect Foundation it's in why
[1:31:00] speak before meeting this
[1:31:05] light that brings this word to a
[1:31:09] reality now I don't believe that a
[1:31:11] church with
[1:31:15] practice no matter how intellectual they
[1:31:20] are that church will never
[1:31:25] Prosper before the supernatural be known
[1:31:29] by these
[1:31:30] people and that seen
[1:31:35] them and see something in which they can
[1:31:38] speak
[1:31:39] about and that thing that can respond
[1:31:41] back to
[1:31:43] them and confirm that the word
[1:31:48] that before the supernatural being known
[1:31:52] in any kind of
[1:31:55] church that church shall never
[1:32:00] Prosper as
[1:32:03] long as long as we have a conception of
[1:32:08] Christian the church will never
[1:32:14] Prosper I'm saying
[1:32:17] this to raise the Revival in you
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:25] understand that we have a
[1:32:27] responsibility to live the word
[1:32:30] of
[1:32:32] way that even if you are alone you still
[1:32:35] live the
[1:32:37] word because even you
[1:32:39] alone always an eye that observes
[1:32:43] you but
[1:32:47] today God gives you an opportunity to
[1:32:49] reach to meet with someone
[1:32:57] instead of preaching that person the
[1:32:59] word of God by the way of
[1:33:02] living but you take the person that God
[1:33:05] put on your
[1:33:06] way and you blocking the kingom of
[1:33:10] God you blocking him to believe the word
[1:33:14] by the way of
[1:33:17] living that's what we're doing
[1:33:20] today that's the church is in this
[1:33:23] Condition it's a really
[1:33:26] miserable it's it's really
[1:33:34] miserable I'm not saying anything
[1:33:36] against your church
[1:33:39] Brothers you are people that are uh like
[1:33:43] uh
[1:33:46] perils I'm not saying anything against

[1:34:23] you I cry against
[1:34:26] the that you let the devil make you
[1:34:31] do the fact that you go to
[1:34:34] church you think that you're
[1:34:39] saved Jesus can never accept a
[1:34:43] man who's not born from water and
[1:34:48] spirit he will never go to the kingdom
[1:34:54] as long as you not born from

[1:35:43] kingdom that's that's said the
[1:35:48] Lord my brothers and sisters
[1:35:54] after you reive the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:58] Spirit these are the miracle that we go
[1:36:02] with this is
[1:36:04] different it's it's not going
[1:36:08] around but it's straight from the
[1:36:10] Bible
[1:36:14] see the signs of a
[1:36:16] Believer When You
[1:36:20] Believe means is when you you receive
[1:36:22] the Holy
[1:36:24] Ghost before you receive the Holy
[1:36:27] Ghost don't say that you a
[1:36:33] Believer it's hard to say but it's the
[1:36:40] truth you're just going coming with the
[1:36:49] Believers you only the step of
[1:36:51] intellectual
[1:37:01] christianis I'm only responsible to say
[1:37:04] what God
[1:37:05] has the message
[1:37:09] Resurrection
[1:37:12] 103 I'm only responsible what God has
[1:37:17] told says you don't receive the Holy
[1:37:19] Ghost once you believe
[1:37:23] you receive the Holy Ghost after
[1:37:27] believing you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:37:29] after you
[1:37:30] believe and it's a gift of
[1:37:37] God anything else will give you
[1:37:41] there you cannot imagine that you have
[1:37:46] it you cannot just accept it by
[1:37:50] faith
[1:37:52] say that I believe that I have the Holy
[1:37:54] Ghost
[1:37:58] brother you cannot accept it by
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:04] faith it's absolutely a works of God
[1:38:07] that comes to your
[1:38:10] heart and that reveals the presence of
[1:38:12] Jesus
[1:38:13] Christ and when you receive the Holy
[1:38:19] Ghost then you believe in all sort of
[1:38:22] Miracles and
[1:38:24] signs and not only you
[1:38:27] believe but you practice
[1:38:31] them and you come to what
[1:38:35] it and these are the sons that shall
[1:38:37] follow those that have
[1:38:41] believed and each one of you
[1:38:45] Beed the and preach the
[1:38:50] goel that
[1:38:53] believe whom
[1:38:57] that and these are the go with those I
[1:39:01] believe yes brothers and sisters and the
[1:39:04] prophet
[1:39:06] say that's the signs of a
[1:39:08] Believer do you
[1:39:10] believe that's what the Bible
[1:39:15] says these are the last word of Jesus
[1:39:18] Christ when he was living the Earth
[1:39:22] say message the same Mage
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:27] 104 it says if this sign don't go along
[1:39:30] with
[1:39:35] you then you just pretending to be a
[1:39:40] believer if the signs don't go
[1:39:45] with we just we just making it up that
[1:39:48] we
[1:39:50] believers we just making favor to God
[1:39:54] God you know I'm I'm your
[1:39:57] believer to be a
[1:39:59] believer the signs have to
[1:40:02] go if the signs don't go along with
[1:40:08] you then you just making it up on your
[1:40:11] mind
[1:40:16] because these are the son that will may
[1:40:18] be accompan
[1:40:24] Jesus said these are the son that
[1:40:27] maybe these are the son that shall
[1:40:31] follow the last word that he addressed
[1:40:33] to the
[1:40:37] church may God comes to your
[1:40:40] help as we bow down our
[1:40:43] heads that was the
[1:40:46] prophet give me 20 more minutes and I'll
[1:40:49] stop from today and we continue
[1:40:52] later you were already
[1:40:55] ready I got
[1:41:01] you
[1:41:04] today church has lost
[1:41:07] everything Divine
[1:41:11] Healing praying for the sick all the
[1:41:14] virtues tongs in
[1:41:16] churches church has lost
[1:41:19] everything
[1:41:22] but she still pretending to be the lady
[1:41:26] Jesus that's the spirit of the
[1:41:28] age a religious
[1:41:31] spirit where people call themselves
[1:41:34] Christians but when you get closer to
[1:41:36] them find out they not
[1:41:39] Christian Christian by name Christians
[1:41:42] by Form
[1:41:48] appearance and the general orders of
[1:41:53] Jesus he says preach the gospel to the
[1:41:55] entire
[1:41:59] creation it was to go preach the
[1:42:05] gospel it was to receive the Lost uh the
[1:42:08] Lost
[1:42:12] sword that that's what have to be a
[1:42:15] subject to the church
[1:42:17] today but today the church has become it
[1:42:21] became a gathering of
[1:42:23] people where they they contribute they
[1:42:26] save some
[1:42:29] money next time next time you going to
[1:42:33] get collect the
[1:42:34] money that's what the church
[1:42:37] is see why we we brought the
[1:42:41] church that's church
[1:42:45] today and we miss the principal uh
[1:42:49] purpose of the church
[1:42:54] when I believe the word I was a little
[1:43:00] boy maybe some could say because my
[1:43:02] father was a
[1:43:05] Christian and I could
[1:43:08] could you know my father is a Christian
[1:43:10] he's a
[1:43:12] pastor it's
[1:43:14] okay I know that at a certain
[1:43:19] time
[1:43:22] you get to a point where you don't need
[1:43:24] the god the god of your
[1:43:27] father you have to get the
[1:43:31] point when you need your only
[1:43:35] God a God that knows you
[1:43:39] personally and in which you have been uh
[1:43:42] done an a personal
[1:43:49] experience one day I was
[1:43:54] inashi it was the first time living my
[1:43:56] parents house it was in
[1:44:01] 2003 I went to one of my uncle's house
[1:44:05] inashi in that
[1:44:10] house my my my my my father told me that
[1:44:13] there was a spirit of witch
[1:44:17] house D said that and I said you know
[1:44:20] there was a evil spirit there but you
[1:44:22] sending me
[1:44:24] there and I accepted and I
[1:44:27] went I had to go to
[1:44:30] university and one
[1:44:32] day I wake
[1:44:34] up I sat
[1:44:37] my and I slept it was during the
[1:44:41] day it was around 3 p.m. or 4m. I was
[1:44:44] sitting on my bed laying on the
[1:44:48] bed I had my eye right open
[1:44:52] at a
[1:44:54] time and I see my eyes starting to close
[1:45:02] up and I felt like I was falling from
[1:45:07] nowhere and when I started trying to my
[1:45:10] voice was not coming up I said
[1:45:13] Lord what's happening to me CU I
[1:45:16] couldn't
[1:45:17] sleep I was not sleeping I was I was
[1:45:20] awake
[1:45:23] I started to fight against
[1:45:27] myself said Lord I want to die I'm going
[1:45:29] to die in this house but at the
[1:45:33] time and I don't know
[1:45:36] why I said Lord save
[1:45:39] me suddenly I came back on
[1:45:43] myself and when I came back to myself my
[1:45:46] heart was
[1:45:47] be in a speed of 100 something
[1:45:52] and I woke
[1:45:54] up I took my
[1:45:56] P and I wrote I wrote to my I say
[1:46:01] Dad this is the experience I just live
[1:46:04] today and I told him every day and what
[1:46:08] he said to them he said my
[1:46:11] son I know that I told you I already
[1:46:13] told
[1:46:15] you you had to be in that
[1:46:19] house
[1:46:24] so that you can experience your
[1:46:25] christianism to compare it to
[1:46:28] something maybe I didn't say
[1:46:31] right maybe to to measure your
[1:46:34] christianism to
[1:46:37] something so that you may know that you
[1:46:39] if you really a a
[1:46:42] Christian
[1:46:43] which magicians are
[1:46:47] there and when you say that you're a
[1:46:49] Christian one
[1:46:52] day you have to face this to a
[1:46:57] contest to measure up your
[1:47:01] christianism there was a
[1:47:05] pastor who was baptizing people I
[1:47:08] believe you know the story it was in
[1:47:11] Congo he said come believe in Jesus
[1:47:13] believe in
[1:47:16] Jesus and there was a magician from the
[1:47:18] village who also
[1:47:21] came he he pretended to
[1:47:24] believe and as he knew that they would
[1:47:26] go to the
[1:47:29] baptism so the magician had the power to
[1:47:32] transform into a
[1:47:34] crocodile and once they got in the
[1:47:39] water and they took the the the the guy
[1:47:42] to put him in
[1:47:46] water so the pastor felt like he was
[1:47:49] taken by a crocodile
[1:47:54] and the Cod took him somewhere in the
[1:47:56] middle of the water
[1:47:59] river there was like a little island in
[1:48:01] the middle of the
[1:48:03] river the crocodile left him
[1:48:05] there now the Cod went left
[1:48:09] back and the other saw
[1:48:13] the the pastor stood
[1:48:16] there because he couldn't swim
[1:48:19] back
[1:48:20] and the river was deep to to to
[1:48:27] swim we had they had to
[1:48:33] do
[1:48:37] mediation when they
[1:48:40] asked they asked the magician can't you
[1:48:43] free the man of
[1:48:45] God can't you please free the man of God
[1:48:49] he said
[1:48:52] I don't have any problem to free
[1:48:54] him the only problem
[1:48:57] is I just wanted to
[1:49:01] understand that it doesn't have that
[1:49:03] power that is pretending to
[1:49:06] have and that's the stage of the the
[1:49:10] church we profess
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:13] Christi but we're not really
[1:49:19] Christians
[1:49:22] we call our church our
[1:49:25] churches now we have other
[1:49:28] priorities looking for
[1:49:30] H looking for
[1:49:33] money raising
[1:49:36] up that's what church is doing
[1:49:41] today the church has to look for the
[1:49:43] lost
[1:49:46] soul how could they look for the Lost
[1:49:49] Souls
[1:49:52] if she even uh lost her identity her
[1:49:55] True
[1:49:58] Value it's really
[1:50:04] sad today in
[1:50:07] church the word is in church and the
[1:50:09] church is in the
[1:50:12] word we thought that we left the
[1:50:16] word now we found the word in uh the
[1:50:18] word in the church
[1:50:22] those who were in con know that a singer
[1:50:25] brother
[1:50:26] pattice he sing
[1:50:30] it the world in the church the church
[1:50:34] the church in the
[1:50:35] world that's the state of the church
[1:50:39] today you
[1:50:41] know when you don't believe the word yet
[1:50:45] when you in the
[1:50:46] world you like in an ocean just die
[1:50:52] and the word of God
[1:50:54] comes he comes and en cches
[1:51:01] you it takes you from that death that
[1:51:03] you have to die from that
[1:51:07] ocean and you know that a person that
[1:51:09] was supposed to die in
[1:51:14] waters you know generally those people
[1:51:17] drink a lot of water because they
[1:51:18] fighting for their life they're going to
[1:51:20] take a lot of water in
[1:51:23] there now the gospel come and saves you
[1:51:27] and takes you out of
[1:51:28] wat and takes you out of the
[1:51:31] world that's not
[1:51:34] enough where we you
[1:51:37] were you had to drink a lot of
[1:51:40] water what does the gospel
[1:51:43] do takes you out of the water from the
[1:51:46] world put you
[1:51:48] aside now he's taking care of
[1:51:52] you to take out the water that you have
[1:51:56] swallowed that's
[1:51:59] why said there's two type of
[1:52:02] Christian correct it's not
[1:52:06] two two steps of
[1:52:09] Christian intellectual Christian or
[1:52:16] artificial when you still fighting to be
[1:52:18] a Christian
[1:52:21] and when you
[1:52:24] battling that's what we call the old
[1:52:26] serpent in your
[1:52:29] heart you have to fight to live a
[1:52:32] Sanctified life when you come listen to
[1:52:35] the
[1:52:36] word that word cuts
[1:52:40] down it takes out the water that you
[1:52:43] have
[1:52:44] swallow every time you come listen to
[1:52:46] the
[1:52:47] word the world is coming out of
[1:52:51] you every time you listen to the
[1:52:54] word it's killing the black do because
[1:52:57] the prophet
[1:52:58] say that when you believe in the
[1:53:01] word God gives you two dog a white dog
[1:53:06] and a black
[1:53:07] dog when you do good
[1:53:09] things a white dog become bigger when
[1:53:12] you do
[1:53:13] evil the black dog get
[1:53:18] bigger depends on what type of dog you
[1:53:22] knish the
[1:53:24] most look how
[1:53:27] much how much time you spend on your
[1:53:31] phone look how much time you live you
[1:53:34] you spend
[1:53:36] your that's why the preacher
[1:53:39] struggling when they're
[1:53:41] preaching there's not people who
[1:53:46] cry because there's not enough sincerity
[1:53:51] there's not enough
[1:53:55] sincerity coming to church is a
[1:53:58] religious we come Sunday we come back on
[1:54:01] next Sunday we come back the next Sunday
[1:54:03] we come back the following
[1:54:06] Sunday it shouldn't be
[1:54:09] so there should have been a
[1:54:13] difference between those who knows God
[1:54:16] and those who don't know
[1:54:18] God there was supposed to be a
[1:54:21] difference because he
[1:54:23] said he said I will establish difference
[1:54:26] I'll put a difference between those who
[1:54:28] knows me and those who don't know
[1:54:32] me we need that difference
[1:54:36] Brothers the world is in the church and
[1:54:39] the church also is in the world what the
[1:54:41] world does that's what we want to
[1:54:45] do the world doesn't T to imitate us
[1:54:51] because we say that we are
[1:54:54] Christian we present a fake proof of
[1:54:57] Chris
[1:54:58] is that's why we in this
[1:55:03] condition when we were growing
[1:55:07] up type of Miss we go back home after
[1:55:11] chur I don't even greet nobody
[1:55:14] outside I go straight to my house and I
[1:55:17] lock myself in the room I start crying
[1:55:22] who can do such
[1:55:25] things once we leave here it's
[1:55:29] Instagram and some even
[1:55:33] in resp they can see a video while they
[1:55:37] they're in
[1:55:40] service but we claim that we are
[1:55:43] Christians we will respond one
[1:55:48] day each one we receive his
[1:55:53] retribution whom that Shall Believe
[1:55:56] baptized and be
[1:55:57] saved who that who whom who will not
[1:56:01] believe he will be
[1:56:04] condemned now I'm about to
[1:56:18] finish
[1:56:26] the five five
[1:56:28] identification
[1:56:32] precise I was preach in
[1:56:36] 1955 I forgot to put the
[1:56:40] year paragraph 90 he says you have
[1:56:45] to you have to witness upon him
[1:56:52] in John
[1:56:54] 1412 he gives us he gives us teaching
[1:56:57] what the church has to
[1:57:00] do in John
[1:57:02] 142 we're going to see what it
[1:57:06] says John
[1:57:10] 14 to read it to make it
[1:57:15] official you see very ver I say
[1:57:20] he
[1:57:21] that the works which I
[1:57:27] do shall shall he do also and shall he
[1:57:30] do great because I go to
[1:57:34] Father say that's a message of
[1:57:38] church Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:57:40] today and
[1:57:41] forever living in the
[1:57:43] church King of the church resurrected
[1:57:47] from
[1:57:48] dead yesterday today and
[1:57:51] forever fulfilling the same
[1:57:55] work doing the same works that Jesus
[1:57:58] did and that's the message of the
[1:58:02] church if the church is not teaching
[1:58:06] this then they teaching a a false
[1:58:13] theology the church is not doing the
[1:58:15] worst that Jesus did everything they
[1:58:18] teaching false
[1:58:25] theology that's why Jesus ordained them
[1:58:28] to
[1:58:29] preach what
[1:58:32] else how do we recognize people say I'm
[1:58:35] a
[1:58:38] Believer see what was the last
[1:58:40] commission he gave to his
[1:58:42] church for the Christian
[1:58:45] Mark
[1:58:48] Mark
[1:58:51] what was his last message to the
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:55] church and we find out if we can uh
[1:58:58] execute his
[1:59:01] commission Mark
[1:59:03] 1614 and then he appeared to the
[1:59:06] 11 as they were at the table the prophet
[1:59:11] said here is the commission given to the
[1:59:14] church now
[1:59:15] listen the very last
[1:59:18] Commission
[1:59:19] we're going to examine
[1:59:22] ourselves see if we are
[1:59:26] believers or if we're just in this
[1:59:28] church or
[1:59:29] not and after he appeared to
[1:59:33] the as they L they lay at the table
[1:59:37] manifested reproached them with their
[1:59:40] unbelief see brothers and
[1:59:43] sisters the
[1:59:47] disciples they received the last
[1:59:48] Commission
[1:59:51] they represented the
[1:59:57] church and the church has to execute the
[1:59:59] commission that
[2:00:02] God and if we don't see those things
[2:00:04] happening in the
[2:00:07] church all we do is preaching a false
[2:00:11] theology we said that we in the
[2:00:15] truth but that truth doesn't
[2:00:18] matter it's going to be a false
[2:00:20] theology brothers and
[2:00:29] sisters I don't want to be
[2:00:32] guilty teaching a false
[2:00:36] theology but I
[2:00:40] need I need God give
[2:00:43] us even if he can give us just two or
[2:00:46] three which we can found found the
[2:00:48] church
[2:00:52] church so that that church can raise
[2:00:55] up invisible
[2:00:58] church if we are True
[2:01:02] Believer we're going to miss a places to
[2:01:05] put people
[2:01:07] here but if we see have empty
[2:01:10] seats that means something is not
[2:01:13] going brothers and sisters as the
[2:01:16] prophet
[2:01:17] said I don't go after to
[2:01:21] you but I'm going after
[2:01:25] sin if we cannot see things that the pro
[2:01:28] word of God promise being fulfilled in
[2:01:30] church that means there's something
[2:01:32] going
[2:01:33] on there's something going
[2:01:36] on each one of us do an examine
[2:01:39] himself and see where it didn't work
[2:01:42] well and to ask
[2:01:44] God we may
