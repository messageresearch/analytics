[1:24:06] series and as God open the word to
[1:24:10] us we begin to we will impart it to the
[1:24:15] church first of all I want to give honor
[1:24:18] to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:24:20] amen to the church of the Living
[1:24:24] God our precious brother
[1:24:27] is my wife couldn't make it
[1:24:31] today having a little knee
[1:24:34] trouble but uh it was in her heart to
[1:24:38] come and I told her no
[1:24:41] sheay at home and go to the
[1:24:45] church but anyhow we want to give honor
[1:24:47] to all the
[1:24:50] God and the reason why I'm doing
[1:24:54] it is because of you that I am
[1:24:56] here if you weren't
[1:25:00] here would have a
[1:25:02] Ministry uh you know if God didn't see
[1:25:05] us
[1:25:06] here brother would not have had a
[1:25:10] Min we we are people I am a man of God I
[1:25:15] am a man of God that fear
[1:25:18] God and uh so I I go by the inspiration
[1:25:21] of
[1:25:25] you know when when when when I preach
[1:25:28] something by the grace of God I have
[1:25:31] already gotten a witness from God to
[1:25:33] preach
[1:25:35] it I don't randomly preach
[1:25:39] things I am led by his
[1:25:43] spirit so as we stand let us turn to
[1:25:47] Ephesians
[1:25:51] 5 this is the scripture that brother vam
[1:25:54] used marriage and
[1:25:57] divorce hallelujah hallelujah and uh um
[1:26:03] we we want to thank God
[1:26:05] for what What the Lord Has
[1:26:09] Done um with the scripture because we
[1:26:13] know the the scripture is
[1:26:17] manifold as God unveils it it unfolds
[1:26:21] itself but that let's read
[1:26:24] it wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:26:28] husbands as unto the
[1:26:32] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[1:26:34] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[1:26:37] church and he is the savior of the
[1:26:43] body
[1:26:46] therefore sorry therefore as the church
[1:26:50] is subject unto Christ so let the wives
[1:26:53] be to their own husbands in
[1:27:03] everything husbands love your wives am
[1:27:07] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:27:10] gave himself for
[1:27:16] it that he excuse me that he might
[1:27:19] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:27:22] of the water of the
[1:27:27] word that he might present it to himself
[1:27:30] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:27:34] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:27:37] should be holy and without
[1:27:48] blemish so ought men to have their own
[1:27:51] WI
[1:27:52] as excuse me so ought men to love their
[1:27:56] wives as their own bodies he that loveth
[1:27:59] his wife loveth
[1:28:08] himself Genesis
[1:28:12] 20 I'm sorry let's go to
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:17] Colossians Colossians
[1:28:20] 1 15
[1:28:22] [Music]

[1:28:48] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:28:51] be throne or dominions or principalities
[1:28:54] or Powers all things were created by Him
[1:28:57] and for
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:09] him and he is before all things and by
[1:29:13] him all things
[1:29:19] consists he is the head of the body the
[1:29:22] church who is the beginning the
[1:29:25] firstborn from the dead that in all all
[1:29:28] things he might have
[1:29:37] preeminence let us
[1:29:40] pray dear heavenly father we come before
[1:29:44] you Lord
[1:29:46] Jesus humbly as we know how we thank you
[1:29:50] for your goodness we thank you for your
[1:29:53] grace the only I ask oh God that you not
[1:29:57] only give us a
[1:30:01] heart but a heart to believe the
[1:30:05] word and a heart to receive the
[1:30:08] word bless your people this morning they
[1:30:12] look Beyond The
[1:30:14] Vessel hear the voice that comes from
[1:30:18] the which is your voice Lord in Jesus
[1:30:24] amen you
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:31] may just a week or so
[1:30:35] ago we were just
[1:30:37] thinking and I I think about death and
[1:30:40] life all the
[1:30:42] time because I know that I am
[1:30:44] approaching an
[1:30:47] a that if God should cut my life
[1:30:50] short
[1:30:53] if by the time I reach the age 70 if he
[1:30:55] should cut it
[1:30:58] there and I lived the life that's been
[1:31:01] allotted to
[1:31:04] me alloted given to me so I thank
[1:31:09] God for these 68
[1:31:13] years and you know it's amazing
[1:31:17] that in in our brother John's
[1:31:20] prayer talking about enjoying
[1:31:25] life and and we know if it's the enemy
[1:31:29] job to make us miserable if
[1:31:33] possible in this
[1:31:35] life but in being a
[1:31:39] Christian we supposed to enjoy
[1:31:43] life every aspect of
[1:31:46] it whether it's good or
[1:31:49] bad sunshine
[1:31:52] should always be
[1:31:58] Sunshine the Sun never stops
[1:32:02] shining it shines in the winter shines
[1:32:06] in the summer it shines in the spring
[1:32:10] and it shines in the
[1:32:15] fall nothing can stop the
[1:32:19] Sun not even the clouds
[1:32:23] helloo because Sun always
[1:32:28] penetrate the light penetrates through
[1:32:30] the
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:33] cloud and that's how it is with
[1:32:36] the no matter what we go
[1:32:39] through that is supposed to
[1:32:44] penetrate
[1:32:46] situation so I was
[1:32:49] thinking about Egypt
[1:32:52] and
[1:32:53] how when the death angel came they were
[1:32:57] given
[1:32:58] instructions put the blood on the
[1:33:00] doorpost and the
[1:33:03] L they were willing to do that portion
[1:33:06] of the
[1:33:09] scripture they were willing to be
[1:33:13] justified but God had another portion of
[1:33:16] their Journey that they were to
[1:33:20] fulfill and that next
[1:33:23] portion would deal with
[1:33:28] sanctification and we found out that in
[1:33:32] sanctification only two made
[1:33:37] it died off about what I'm saying they
[1:33:41] all started out
[1:33:44] saying hallelujah but somewhere down the
[1:33:48] line they lost their
[1:33:50] salvation
[1:33:53] just
[1:33:54] listen it didn't stop
[1:33:58] there they had to
[1:34:01] come to a
[1:34:03] death a
[1:34:05] Jordan and they had to die to
[1:34:10] everything uh uh uh uh that they
[1:34:14] experienced in EG as well as the
[1:34:17] Wilderness matterif fact God told the
[1:34:21] children
[1:34:22] Israel I put you in the
[1:34:26] wilderness you to see what was in your
[1:34:32] heart
[1:34:33] Hallelujah so when we go through
[1:34:36] trial not God who is on
[1:34:40] trial you that's on trial and the test
[1:34:45] come to
[1:34:46] see what you are made
[1:34:49] of Hallelujah amen now the death angel
[1:34:54] didn't get them in
[1:34:56] Egypt but it took on another
[1:34:59] form and we know this form by by
[1:35:07] names hallelujah hallelujah and David
[1:35:10] and was
[1:35:13] instruments of the death angel
[1:35:16] Hallelujah because they
[1:35:20] interpreted that Moses
[1:35:23] said to their own
[1:35:26] means Hallelujah and they were jealous
[1:35:30] of the
[1:35:32] ministry said they said to
[1:35:35] Moses do you think you the only holy
[1:35:39] man we are all holy Hallelujah and they
[1:35:44] had
[1:35:47] followers am amen amen I want to preach
[1:35:51] anyway
[1:35:52] even though I hear some of your
[1:35:54] thoughts listen be careful be
[1:35:58] careful you're carrying something that
[1:36:00] you shouldn't have
[1:36:02] brought but let me move on let me move
[1:36:05] on and and and and and just think about
[1:36:08] it God was taking them to the spirit of
[1:36:13] adoption hallelujah hallelujah and only
[1:36:16] a few caught the
[1:36:19] Revelation Hallelujah Moses couldn't
[1:36:22] bring them to
[1:36:24] adoption it took Joshua
[1:36:27] away was a shadow a type of the Holy
[1:36:33] Ghost Hallelujah is that right I mean
[1:36:37] you had
[1:36:39] a uh you know who who who allowed
[1:36:43] himself to be seduced by that same
[1:36:47] spirit that same devil Hallelujah that U
[1:36:51] the other
[1:36:53] millions in the
[1:36:55] wilderness let me say it like this God
[1:37:00] sees he knows every move we
[1:37:04] make he knows our thoughts the Bible
[1:37:06] said of
[1:37:08] off Hallelujah is that right Moses was
[1:37:12] the angel of life and
[1:37:15] life
[1:37:17] Hallelujah yes sir Joshua who who was a
[1:37:20] whole type of the Holy
[1:37:23] Spirit he became the angel of life and
[1:37:28] life Hallelujah but it still did not
[1:37:34] stop yall better hear what I'm saying
[1:37:36] see the death angel doesn't attack those
[1:37:39] who are
[1:37:40] dead Hallelujah the death angel attacks
[1:37:44] those who have
[1:37:46] life hallelujah hallelujah y understand
[1:37:49] what I'm saying so if you got Li you got
[1:37:53] to be
[1:37:55] careful because the death angel
[1:37:58] still is
[1:38:00] around Hallelujah yes
[1:38:03] sir I'm explain
[1:38:06] myself hallelujah hallelujah so here it
[1:38:09] was Joshua he was also the angel who led
[1:38:13] them to the
[1:38:16] promise Joshua and Caleb was the only
[1:38:20] two who had the right
[1:38:23] question is what is your
[1:38:26] spirit concerning this message
[1:38:30] hallelujah hallelujah where is my
[1:38:33] Mountain understand this is what K said
[1:38:36] I want my

[1:38:59] of

[1:39:06] wore
[1:39:09] out Hallelujah but in this day my shoes

[1:39:27] other you know we are in such a rich

[1:40:33] Hallelujah every
[1:40:36] seed proves what it
[1:40:41] is am you can say whatever you want
[1:40:48] to I remember when I was was a
[1:40:52] boy looking at a a
[1:40:55] cartoon there was a cat that was black
[1:40:57] and
[1:40:59] white a male
[1:41:03] cat I'm and then there was
[1:41:06] a sorry let me back it up there was a
[1:41:10] cat that was a black
[1:41:14] cat the black cat crawled under he he he
[1:41:18] he crawled under a fence did
[1:41:21] that had just been
[1:41:25] painted and this cat saw a skunk I I GRE
[1:41:31] uh um a
[1:41:34] skunk no it's an animal it's a it's a
[1:41:37] stinking animal I don't know what y'all
[1:41:38] call
[1:41:42] him but you don't want to get in contact
[1:41:44] with
[1:41:46] a Hallelujah to show you what a they
[1:41:49] uses the
[1:41:55] oils and they put them put it in in
[1:41:59] perfumes to give it that
[1:42:02] strength you understand so
[1:42:05] anyway this cat fell in love with the
[1:42:13] scum
[1:42:16] until the paint was washed
[1:42:19] away no matter how he was painted the
[1:42:24] outside he was
[1:42:26] still and a scum was still a
[1:42:29] scum see disguises go a long
[1:42:35] way let me put it the way the Bible
[1:42:40] say
[1:42:44] favor how say let me read it let me
[1:42:46] read you love the
[1:42:48] Lord am
[1:42:52] I've been quoting that scripture forever
[1:42:54] and here I am can't remember what
[1:42:56] I it says favor is
[1:43:01] deceitful and beauty is
[1:43:05] vain y'all believe that let me tell you
[1:43:08] like this it's like a
[1:43:11] preacher he can preach
[1:43:15] 100% but let him make one
[1:43:18] mistake and the had everything
[1:43:25] good let's say for you that that's the
[1:43:29] way I I see these
[1:43:31] things preachers who have
[1:43:34] done
[1:43:36] things the kingdom of God and they mess
[1:43:39] up one
[1:43:41] time and these people who call
[1:43:44] themselves
[1:43:46] Christian wipe them
[1:43:49] out let me tell you something if you
[1:43:52] don't know a yet there ain't one
[1:43:56] preacher there's not one
[1:43:58] preacher Perfect Like
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:03] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:44:06] truth of the man is we have a poor way
[1:44:10] of judging each
[1:44:12] other in reality we should be
[1:44:16] doing the word
[1:44:18] judges not me
[1:44:22] it's the word
[1:44:24] that let me say it like
[1:44:28] this Marilyn
[1:44:30] Monroe Monroe they say she was
[1:44:34] beautiful and she was in her
[1:44:37] day she can't touch the women
[1:44:42] nowadays but after
[1:44:46] died nobody was at the funeral home
[1:44:48] trying to take her body
[1:44:56] you understand what I'm saying all that
[1:45:00] beauty and when she
[1:45:02] died her beauty died with
[1:45:06] her somebody help me see what I'm trying
[1:45:10] to say it can never be the out with
[1:45:14] appearance Hallelujah you can appear
[1:45:17] like
[1:45:18] we but if that hasn't been
[1:45:22] changed it's going to reveal
[1:45:27] itself Hallelujah I won't have to do a
[1:45:30] thing about
[1:45:31] it because the
[1:45:33] nature is going to show
[1:45:36] up in some
[1:45:41] season Hallelujah
[1:45:43] Hall love the Lord let me read what
[1:45:46] brother
[1:45:47] say love God in God's power to
[1:45:52] transform now I'm dealing with order I'm
[1:45:55] dealing
[1:45:55] with and I'm dealing with
[1:45:59] life you know what God His Image and his
[1:46:04] life because we're living in an age of
[1:46:08] perion everything is
[1:46:11] perverted except the word of
[1:46:14] God no
[1:46:16] perversion will enter the
[1:46:19] kingdom yeah oh you I've been more
[1:46:22] raised in the
[1:46:25] message unless you really got the Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost the message is not a thing it's a
[1:46:34] person you may have grown up around the
[1:46:38] message your family your daddy your mama
[1:46:41] might be in the
[1:46:42] message but you never be in the message
[1:46:47] until you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:46:52] because the Holy
[1:46:54] Ghost is the
[1:46:57] message amen hallelujah hallu I'm so
[1:47:02] glad to know that what I
[1:47:07] possess is
[1:47:09] genuine there are some of us who know
[1:47:12] that Hallelujah coming from the
[1:47:16] message Hallelujah God's power to
[1:47:19] transform I didn't come to make you
[1:47:21] shout this morning matter I never come
[1:47:24] to do that I have to give you the
[1:47:27] word whatever God want me to
[1:47:30] say hallelujah hallu coming from that
[1:47:34] message paragraph
[1:47:36] 63 listen to the way the
[1:47:39] prophet describes God on the day of
[1:47:44] creation he said where that seventh
[1:47:47] moment
[1:47:49] morning when God looked upon it
[1:47:52] all he said it's
[1:47:55] good I am pleased with
[1:48:01] it I am glad I did
[1:48:04] it and it's all now under
[1:48:08] control and I have put trust in my
[1:48:13] son
[1:48:15] wife that they will make them head of
[1:48:18] all of it
[1:48:21] Hallelujah that they will watch over it
[1:48:24] all and see
[1:48:27] that it's all
[1:48:29] right that
[1:48:31] everything will bring forth of this
[1:48:35] kind now he was has now he has that
[1:48:39] power to do
[1:48:41] that God then said
[1:48:44] well if if it's all so
[1:48:48] good and it can't be anything
[1:48:53] else because it's my it's it's my own
[1:48:57] desire it's the way I want
[1:49:00] it and I have spoken it that
[1:49:04] way and my words have brought it just
[1:49:07] exactly the way I wanted
[1:49:10] it and there it is it's all good so the
[1:49:15] Bible say God rested the seventh days
[1:49:20] from all his works and everything under
[1:49:24] control to of its
[1:49:28] kind Hallelujah now remember to
[1:49:32] bring when it put forth the seed in the
[1:49:36] earth listen the seed can only
[1:49:41] come fought with the power of life
[1:49:44] within
[1:49:46] it to transform it from a seed
[1:49:52] to or whever it
[1:49:55] is his transforming
[1:49:58] power now God put the seed in
[1:50:02] there with
[1:50:04] potentials that it will be what he said
[1:50:07] it would
[1:50:08] be the SE with
[1:50:11] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:50:13] it would
[1:50:14] be and as long as it stayed in it right
[1:50:19] category
[1:50:22] it will be just exactly what God said it
[1:50:25] would
[1:50:27] be Hallelujah it had to be that
[1:50:31] way because he had made it that
[1:50:35] way and made a
[1:50:37] channel that anything that stays in his
[1:50:41] channel in his
[1:50:44] word for
[1:50:46] exactly like the word said it will do
[1:50:53] because if you say you
[1:50:55] Bri see must bring
[1:50:59] forth Hallelujah not some kind of
[1:51:03] tradition not
[1:51:08] a the
[1:51:10] seed
[1:51:12] for Hallelujah Hall is that right it CH
[1:51:16] it's it's channeled just exactly
[1:51:23] right so with everything in the trust so
[1:51:27] with everything in the trust in his own
[1:51:33] son that it would be that
[1:51:36] way then God said it is good so I'll
[1:51:41] just
[1:51:43] rest each one of those
[1:51:45] seeds has power in
[1:51:48] itself transform
[1:51:51] itself into the
[1:51:54] species that I desire it to
[1:51:57] be me there's no excuse if the seed is
[1:52:02] in
[1:52:03] there oh it needs to be is
[1:52:07] quicker in order to transform you you
[1:52:11] don't transform it transform you it
[1:52:16] changes you from glory to
[1:52:20] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah that's
[1:52:23] exactly right exactly hallelujah
[1:52:26] hallelujah is able to transform you into
[1:52:28] another
[1:52:29] listen the nature you and I were born
[1:52:32] in did did not make us
[1:52:38] sinners we were
[1:52:40] Sinners we couldn't help but be
[1:52:43] Sinners because of the seed that was in
[1:52:46] us we came here as liars and th
[1:52:52] adter us that's what we
[1:52:55] were but there was another
[1:52:57] SE Hallelujah there was a seed that
[1:53:02] God from the foundation of the
[1:53:05] world but that seed cannot
[1:53:08] live until you kill the
[1:53:14] original you that first
[1:53:17] seed has to die the product of that seed
[1:53:22] must now some of you may not
[1:53:25] understand this is why it was a tree of
[1:53:29] life
[1:53:31] one one life in that tree and that was
[1:53:35] the Life of
[1:53:37] Christ is that right but there was
[1:53:39] another tree and it was two lives two
[1:53:44] Natures good and evil hallelujah
[1:53:47] hallelujah and that's why Jesus said
[1:53:51] make the tree good or make it evil this
[1:53:55] is not the day of Good and Evil not for
[1:53:59] the bride cuz she has a perfect word
[1:54:03] that would bring us into a perfect state
[1:54:05] of
[1:54:06] EV Hallelujah this is why God delivered
[1:54:09] to us in a message that brother prach
[1:54:14] the statue of a perfect man that was the
[1:54:17] divine nature of God that that was in
[1:54:21] the
[1:54:22] seed hallelujah oh I got to have
[1:54:25] patience in the
[1:54:27] seed I got to have long suffering
[1:54:31] se but we must
[1:54:35] die and Ro to our
[1:54:39] will you got to understand even as a
[1:54:44] man Jesus did not want to go to
[1:54:48] calary amen amen that's true but the god
[1:54:53] in
[1:54:54] him spoke up and said not my
[1:55:00] will you hear what I'm saying and he
[1:55:03] suffered
[1:55:05] that so much so he looking for
[1:55:08] people that's going to really not only
[1:55:10] hear his word but believe his
[1:55:15] word that's what it must
[1:55:18] be because I have given every seed
[1:55:22] transforming power to make out of
[1:55:28] itself in his potentials now to make out
[1:55:32] of
[1:55:33] itself exactly what I want it to
[1:55:39] be and that word
[1:55:42] exact another word for
[1:55:45] Perfection exact means spot
[1:55:48] on hallelujah hallelujah not
[1:55:54] almost but it means exactly what it
[1:55:57] say hallelujah so what are you looking
[1:56:00] at a
[1:56:01] message brother I didn't come to call
[1:56:04] build another
[1:56:07] organization
[1:56:08] denomination this message is for the
[1:56:10] Bride of Jesus
[1:56:12] Christ and he said she will never
[1:56:16] denominate she never
[1:56:18] become
[1:56:20] Hallelujah why because she has a seed in
[1:56:23] her and this seed is not of a
[1:56:26] denomination it's not
[1:56:28] organization this seed is the word of
[1:56:32] God and this seed will bring you into
[1:56:35] His Image this SE will bring you into
[1:56:39] his
[1:56:40] likeness SE will bring you
[1:56:46] into hallelujah hallelujah you see
[1:56:49] because even in Jesus
[1:56:51] day it was the tradition of
[1:56:54] men that caused the word of God to be n
[1:57:01] effect how much you can say how many
[1:57:03] testimonies you
[1:57:05] got for what you
[1:57:07] believe
[1:57:09] right and if it's not producing
[1:57:12] Christ there's a little leaving
[1:57:15] somewhere something needs to be sought
[1:57:19] out
[1:57:22] you love the Lord let me move on Genesis
[1:57:25] 20
[1:57:28] 68
[1:57:32] a you see why God didn't say hey let's
[1:57:36] just be a
[1:57:40] church but he even set the church in
[1:57:43] order there's a fivefold
[1:57:46] Ministry and that fivefold Ministry has
[1:57:48] a word
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:52] word hallelujah hallelujah and as long
[1:57:55] as they follow that
[1:57:56] word that will be produced
[1:58:00] in but the moment they turn to
[1:58:03] Creed
[1:58:05] [Music]
[1:58:09] andg Hallelujah I am
[1:58:12] ambitious and I am
[1:58:15] ambitious because I I I got to make this
[1:58:22] translation and my
[1:58:24] ambition is to see the virtues of
[1:58:31] Christ must go
[1:58:34] through that seed in me compels me to
[1:58:38] move
[1:58:39] forward not to stay still
[1:58:44] and I see
[1:58:47] Jesus Hallelujah
[1:58:49] maybe not in your flesh but see in my
[1:58:53] flesh and your desire should be see
[1:58:58] Jesus
[1:59:00] your is that right because the Bible
[1:59:03] say men say that Jesus has not come in
[1:59:07] the flesh he an
[1:59:11] antichrist
[1:59:12] Hallelujah yes sir he not only came
[1:59:18] Andra in
[1:59:22] your you can't be a
[1:59:25] messiah without Christ in
[1:59:30] there Genesis 20
[1:59:34] 68 I know we've got so many people still
[1:59:38] playing
[1:59:39] church and the Death
[1:59:43] Angel the damn thing you're still
[1:59:46] here what happens when you try
[1:59:51] saw and there is no
[1:59:53] results because somewhere you sold your
[1:59:56] birth
[1:59:58] right nobody in here like
[2:00:01] that Hallelujah but you must
[2:00:05] understand was a church going
[2:00:10] to did God
[2:00:13] bless he's blessed
[2:00:15] now you see the Arabs and all that's
[2:00:18] from
[2:00:20] they got more money than we
[2:00:22] do Hallelujah but
[2:00:27] Salvation I wouldn't trade billions of
[2:00:31] dollars give me of Hallelujah but I'll
[2:00:36] take
[2:00:37] Jesus y understand me you can have this
[2:00:41] whole
[2:00:42] world
[2:00:44] Jesus this is what what I can't quite
[2:00:47] seem to grasp and maybe out of my
[2:00:53] mind but when I see this world falling
[2:00:57] aart just like brother
[2:01:01] said and my
[2:01:03] ambition is still in this
[2:01:09] world that's right it's all right to
[2:01:11] have nice
[2:01:12] things but you better put Jesus
[2:01:15] [Applause]
[2:01:17] first Hallelujah
[2:01:19] listen it didn't say get all the things
[2:01:21] in the world
[2:01:23] first God would then give you the Holy
[2:01:26] Ghost he said get the Holy Ghost
[2:01:29] first and then God will give you
[2:01:34] everything hallelujah hallelujah six
[2:01:38] verse and God said unto him in a
[2:01:41] dream y I know that
[2:01:46] th this this in the in of thy
[2:01:50] heart for I also withheld thee from
[2:01:55] sinning against
[2:01:58] me therefore suffer I did not to touch
[2:02:04] her now therefore restore the man his
[2:02:08] wife for he is a
[2:02:10] prophet and he shall pray for thee thou
[2:02:14] sh live and if thou restore her not
[2:02:19] know thou that thou shall surely
[2:02:23] die thou and all that are
[2:02:28] thine therefore aimc Rose early in the
[2:02:32] morning and called all his
[2:02:36] servants and told all these things in
[2:02:38] their
[2:02:40] ears and the men were so
[2:02:44] afraid I just want to bring one point
[2:02:46] out of this this is this is a a a
[2:02:49] subject in
[2:02:51] itself but understand the devil is in
[2:02:56] prison he's in lock
[2:02:59] down he can't keep
[2:03:03] you y understand whatever Satan has on
[2:03:09] you God has already given you
[2:03:13] Deliverance you got an order to go
[2:03:17] free
[2:03:19] it doesn't matter how great this demon
[2:03:23] is a king so do not dealing with the
[2:03:27] little demons you dealing with a big
[2:03:30] demon Hallelujah and it doesn't matter
[2:03:33] how big the demon
[2:03:35] is he cannot keep you why because you
[2:03:39] belong to
[2:03:42] God oh my God now this this excites
[2:03:46] me because when I see
[2:03:50] people uh you know they you know you let
[2:03:53] the devil take your
[2:03:55] joy let me say it like this we go
[2:03:58] through our down

[2:04:51] soul Hallelujah you cannot touch the all

[2:04:59] wine I'm coming I haven't even got to
[2:05:01] where I want to
[2:05:03] go but the theme of the message is to

[2:05:12] you
[2:05:13] can't you can't be
[2:05:16] restored without obedience

[2:39:13] sometimes and not know it
[2:39:19] pop the

[2:39:27] easily like a hot
[2:39:32] stove and you tell them don't touch the
[2:39:35] stone but they're now
[2:39:39] fascinated the best thing you you can do
[2:39:42] is move that child out of the presence
[2:39:44] of the St
[2:39:46] because if you
[2:39:48] don't that child is going to touch that
[2:39:51] Stope they will
[2:39:53] learn but they learn the hard
[2:39:56] way sometimes that was that's what we do
