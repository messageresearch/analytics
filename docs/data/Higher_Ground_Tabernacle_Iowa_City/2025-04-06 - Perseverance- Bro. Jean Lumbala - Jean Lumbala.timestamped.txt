[0:00] I know that he has his own
[0:02] business but my mother's my problem is
[0:04] my
[0:06] salary. That's the reason why I
[0:09] can't I can't find I can find someone
[0:12] who steps on my
[0:14] feet and when that person steps on my
[0:18] feet I act like I don't even see
[0:22] him because after all he's not my
[0:25] problem.
[0:27] My problem is my salary.
[0:31] And it's the same when you come to
[0:34] worship. When you come to worship,
[0:40] you got to have in your mind your
[0:42] purpose. What did you come to do? Amen.
[0:49] Amen. God called me to be his servant.
[0:55] So you are also a servant of God.
[1:00] The servant of God is not just a
[1:04] preacher in the team of God that
[1:06] overcomes.
[1:10] Everybody is an
[1:17] actor. And there's no no someone who
[1:19] stands there and look at people. They
[1:21] just they just careless.
[1:25] They just careless.
[1:31] And some even acts like
[1:36] uh they live here and they go criticize,
[1:39] gossip about their church. I know in my
[1:42] church they don't sing. Well,
[1:46] so you leave your
[1:48] family. Let me give you my example.
[1:52] It can never happen to me.
[1:56] to tell somebody else that my mother is
[1:58] a witch. Even if she is a witch, even if
[2:01] I know that she's a witch, I cannot do
[2:06] it. Because I believe that my mother is
[2:10] me. The shame of my mother is my
[2:16] shame. So you have to believe the same.
[2:18] The victim of your church is your
[2:20] victory.
[2:22] And the shame of your church is your
[2:24] your
[2:25] shame. That's how you had to believe.
[2:29] You have done well.
[2:34] To to start a church in Iowa. May God
[2:37] bless you. You have done well. Amen.
[2:39] Amen.
[2:44] But when you start something, you got to
[2:46] end it. Finish it.
[2:50] If you don't finish it,
[2:54] you are a distractor.
[2:58] You and the one who distract you have
[3:00] the same salary.
[3:03] When you start
[3:05] something, you got you have to achieve
[3:07] it.
[3:11] No matter what,
[3:14] no matter what
[3:16] obstacles, no matter our difficulties,
[3:22] you should never leave your church.
[3:24] Amen.
[3:28] Amen. You should never forsake your
[3:31] church.
[3:33] You
[3:34] know, in order for God to bless us,
[3:40] you look at our endurance
[3:43] and how much
[3:47] we in our way to our way of deciding to
[3:51] worship him. Amen. Amen.
[3:55] And the devil in
[3:58] also in order for him to leave us he
[4:01] looked at us how much we can endure with
[4:05] our
[4:06] faith. You know
[4:08] [Music]
[4:09] Peter when the Peter s in the
[4:13] water he looked is it a dead
[4:17] man he says I'm not a ghost it's
[4:20] me and Peter say if
[4:24] you tell me uh
[4:30] um let me work with you in
[4:34] water and Peter walked with
[4:37] He started working working on water
[4:40] and he started working
[4:44] [Music]
[4:46] but he didn't endure with his
[4:50] faith and when his faith started going
[4:54] down and Peter lost his uh balance on
[4:57] the
[4:59] water and Peter wanted to drown if it
[5:03] was not the grace of God.
[5:07] And Peter Peter started well
[5:12] but he didn't he didn't keep his
[5:15] faith and you also has started
[5:19] well but you have to
[5:24] to God calls
[5:28] Moses he gives him a
[5:31] mission he gives him a mission
[5:36] says, "I heard the cries of my people
[5:39] Israel. Here's the time.
[5:44] I have to go free
[5:46] them. I have to go free
[5:49] them. But I'm sending you." Amen. Amen.
[5:55] And when Moses was
[5:58] working on the will of
[6:00] God and he was an obstacle come, what is
[6:06] it? Here these two
[6:11] prophets. They also do the same
[6:14] thing to do
[6:17] what? To bring Moses to doubt of the
[6:21] promise of God.
[6:23] But Moses
[6:24] stayed persistent. He didn't change his
[6:29] faith. He stood with the
[6:34] faith. He said, "The one who spoke to me
[6:36] was the Lord, the God of
[6:38] Israel. He's alive and he's able to do
[6:41] anything and freed
[6:43] us." But that those two prophets was
[6:46] there.
[6:50] They also did the same miracle as
[6:53] well just to bring Moses to
[6:56] doubt. But Moses didn't doubt.
[7:00] He
[7:01] believed and he witness
[7:05] testified but he stay with firm with
[7:08] what he
[7:11] believed. And that's what you also have
[7:13] to do. For each one of us this
[7:16] morning, you have done well to
[7:19] believe. You did well. You did well to
[7:25] testify. Stay faithful with what you're
[7:28] saying in your testimony. Don't you
[7:31] change your
[7:33] testimony. Don't just change your
[7:36] testimony. Keep testifying.
[7:40] If you testify today, you also testify
[7:43] tomorrow. If you testify
[7:46] tomorrow, keep
[7:49] testifying. Keep
[7:52] testifying. The God who sent you down
[7:55] here who brought you to start this
[7:58] church. He's not. He's
[8:02] alive. You cannot lose your
[8:05] faith. Don't you lose it.
[8:08] We just read
[8:12] that you have in order for you to
[8:15] get to get the promises of God.
[8:19] We have to endure it. We have to endure
[8:24] it. We cannot be believing
[8:28] today. For example,
[8:33] myself, I gave you my
[8:37] testimony that I'm waiting for my wife
[8:39] and my children's that's coming
[8:43] and if one day I go to to the
[8:47] media and I say
[8:51] that that Trump says people cannot no
[8:54] longer come to the United States and if
[8:57] I change my taste
[9:00] because of what Trump said.
[9:03] Then I lost my purpose.
[9:06] Amen. Amen.
[9:09] But if I'm I'm
[9:12] doing I have to keep repeating. I have
[9:16] to keep
[9:17] testifying. I I have to keep enduring.
[9:23] pray because we know it's through prayer
[9:26] that we get our victory. When we are
[9:29] sick, we
[9:31] pray. When we in good health, we still
[9:35] pray. At the time of peace, we
[9:39] pray at a time of war. We still pray. We
[9:43] pray at night. We pray during the day.
[9:48] We cannot pray enough.
[9:55] Today, if we believe that Moses is a
[9:57] servant of
[10:00] God, it's because he endures with what
[10:03] he
[10:08] believed. Was displeased with the
[10:10] teaching of his mother. His mother would
[10:13] tell him, "You're not an Egyptian.
[10:17] You're an
[10:18] Israelite.
[10:20] Look at this. One day we'll get out of
[10:23] this. But when Moses met with the
[10:25] teaching of
[10:27] Hel, he didn't stay the same
[10:31] Moses. He became Moses of
[10:36] faith. He became Moses of endurance.
[10:42] You become Moses who can be trust in the
[10:46] word regardless of the option.
[10:52] remembered
[10:54] cuz where I was
[10:57] going and we
