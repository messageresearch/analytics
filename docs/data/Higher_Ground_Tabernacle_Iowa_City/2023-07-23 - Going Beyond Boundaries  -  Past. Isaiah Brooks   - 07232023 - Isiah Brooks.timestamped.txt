[37:19] 24th chapter
[37:25] foreign

[37:43] the bride will be without spot wrinkle
[37:46] or blemish
[37:54] one of the things that keep me going in
[37:58] the shoes
[37:59] one of the things that keep me on my
[38:02] knees is
[38:04] to know that only the pure in heart
[38:07] foreign
[38:14] Joshua
[38:16] 24
[38:22] we're going to read the 13th through the
[38:24] 16th verse says
[38:29] and then from there
[38:31] we go to
[38:32] Joshua 2. foreign
[38:42] the scripture says
[38:45] the community I have given you a land
[38:48] for which you did not labor
[38:51] and cities which ye built not
[38:54] and ye dwell in them
[38:57] of The Vineyards
[38:59] and out of yours which you planted not
[39:02] do ye eat
[39:10] foreign
[39:34] and put away the gods with your father
[39:37] served on the other side of the flood
[39:39] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[39:44] flavor
[39:47] [Music]
[40:00] eternal
[40:04] [Music]
[40:09] whether the gods which your father
[40:11] served that were on the other side of
[40:13] the flood or the gods of the amorites
[40:16] and whose land ye dwell for as for me
[40:19] and my house
[40:21] we will serve the Lord
[40:32] foreign
[40:45] and the people answered and said
[40:48] God forbid
[40:52] that we should forsake the Lord
[40:55] to serve other gods
[40:58] yes
[41:07] can we all read that scripture together
[41:14] the 16th one it says
[41:20] God forbid that we should forsake the
[41:23] Lord to serve other gods
[41:26] I trust that's everybody's response
[41:31] Joshua 2 and this is Joshua
[41:39] foreign
[41:45] first
[41:47] cities
[41:49] the street that is left
[41:52] behold when he come into the land

[41:58] Scarlet thread
[42:00] in the window which thou did let us down
[42:02] by
[42:04] and thou shall bring thy fathers and thy
[42:07] mother and thy Brethren and all thy
[42:10] father's household home into thee

[43:08] upon his head and we will be Guiltless
[43:12] and whosoever shall be with thee in the
[43:15] house his blood shall be on our head if
[43:19] any hand be upon him
[43:22] University
[43:28] okay sir let us pray father God we come
[43:33] before you thank you we thank you for
[43:36] your grace
[43:37] thank you for your mercy
[43:40] Lord there is no
[43:43] reason
[43:43] are you the only true Living God
[43:48] we honor you to this morning
[43:51] thank you for your goodness
[43:55] we thank you for the grace that you
[43:57] bestowed upon us
[44:00] words cannot express
[44:03] our gratitude
[44:10] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[44:14] amen amen you maybe see that remember
[44:17] that's why
[44:24] I was
[44:26] thinking the other day and
[44:29] just thinking about the time that we may
[44:33] have left
[44:35] to live on this Earth
[44:37] is
[44:40] brother Branham has come and gone
[44:46] since 65 we have been moving under the
[44:50] inspiration of Elijah
[44:54] and the song from us
[44:59] which is the true Holy Ghost
[45:02] [Music]
[45:03] we thank God for that
[45:07] but then you know the Bible is a book
[45:11] not just a book
[45:15] it is the book of redemption
[45:20] and it is amazing
[45:22] how that all books
[45:27] a pattern after the book
[45:33] you know every book have they have
[45:36] chapters
[45:39] they have headings of chapters
[45:43] and while I was thinking about that I
[45:46] thought about
[45:49] what point in time are we in is
[45:56] those of us who are
[46:00] book readers
[46:02] [Music]
[46:03] we know how a book starts out
[46:08] and how it is
[46:11] the first chapter
[46:16] shows like genesis is to us
[46:20] and then that last chapter
[46:23] is the wrapping up of all things
[46:30] that was first stated in the first
[46:32] chapter
[46:35] and I thought about episodes
[46:43] and many of us know what that what I'm
[46:46] trying to say
[46:49] those of you have been uh really into
[46:52] television or things of that nature you
[46:56] you know how the the enemy
[47:06] and
[47:08] [Music]
[47:10] they're good at it
[47:13] and right at the end of one series
[47:17] they have something so dramatically
[47:26] until
[47:27] stay
[47:39] all right
[47:41] and you say with yourself
[47:44] I'm gonna see this last one
[47:49] and I'll be done
[47:52] but they give you another chapter
[47:57] and it's better than the last amen
[48:09] and sometimes that ending is expected
[48:12] foreign
[48:25] [Music]
[48:32] don't know about you no
[48:37] no
[48:37] there were times
[48:40] when a series would end
[48:43] I would be disappointed
[48:47] but that's not the way the Bible is
[48:49] written
[48:52] hallelujah amen because you and I must
[48:55] understand
[48:57] amen that God has sting really great
[49:02] help me
[49:09] of the seventh Church age
[49:14] we can look back
[49:16] at it and see if what what
[49:21] but now we're
[49:23] now we're another series
[49:25] which is the final one for the Gentile
[49:28] Brown
[49:31] the script has already been written
[49:36] hallelujah amen but it's only written
[49:41] to those who are
[49:43] capable
[49:51] because everybody
[49:56] doesn't get the part
[50:00] because that part was written for
[50:04] specific person
[50:07] specific certain kind of people
[50:11] that knows how to enter into to the
[50:14] script he serves you're not a good actor
[50:18] you can't play a good role
[50:21] you don't know how to personalize the
[50:24] scripts
[50:32] the Bible is
[50:38] it's the true Living Word of God
[50:42] hallelujah but
[50:46] people people
[50:51] like to enter into
[50:55] amen am I wrong about that please
[50:58] because what Jesus says that he is the
[51:02] door
[51:04] he is the door
[51:06] no man can enter a person
[51:11] you got to come here
[51:14] for him to knock on the dog
[51:17] the door has to be open and you must
[51:21] walk into it what are you saying brother
[51:24] books I'm saying the Bible it's a book
[51:28] that you can enter into
[51:32] and you in the book become one and I'm
[51:35] thinking
[51:37] even uh I want to say this we are beyond
[51:42] the seven churches
[51:44] we know what brother random says each
[51:48] Church age overlaps
[51:53] I understand where she's at
[51:57] she must know amen that she's in a
[52:00] particular place a place
[52:02] a
[52:05] place that we've never walked foreign
[52:47] [Music]
[52:57] more than anything
[53:00] and that is the writer
[53:04] of the book
[53:08] of the book is that right
[53:12] when I study
[53:14] at the University of South Carolina
[53:17] and I was taking the a course of
[53:20] composition
[53:25] and and in my first grade
[53:30] on my first uh grade on my first exam
[53:34] I I didn't do well for my Beyonce so I
[53:39] went to the uh instructor's office
[53:56] God gave me that wisdom I was a
[53:59] Christian
[54:00] so I watched
[54:09] he was giving me his thoughts
[54:12] you understand me so while I was there
[54:17] I was thinking Japan said I must learn
[54:20] to
[54:21] learn Hallelujah
[54:25] so you understand
[54:27] that time
[54:30] I aced every one of my papers hey
[54:49] so when he would read
[54:56] [Music]
[55:01] so you say well what do you mean
[55:04] you mean I'm saying hello in order to
[55:07] understand the Bible
[55:10] you must come in contact
[55:13] with the person who wrote the Bible
[55:17] hallelujah amen and you must learn how
[55:21] to think like the authority
[55:27] you must learn how to think
[55:29] to think like the author whatever
[55:35] we have now the mind of Christ
[55:38] Hallelujah
[55:41] you
[55:45] will think like Christ
[55:48] you will live like Christ you will obey
[55:52] like Christ
[55:53] amen we're going Beyond these boundaries
[55:59] our ultimate goal
[56:01] is to become one with the word
[56:04] Christianity
[56:06] it's not about popularity
[56:14] [Music]
[56:17] the devil don't even care
[56:20] you belong to a message
[56:24] if you don't
[56:26] get the Authority
[56:35] nothing is
[56:39] Hallelujah amen now brother Bradham
[56:42] taught us that we were we are in an age
[56:45] of divine love
[56:48] and creation
[56:50] foreign
[57:20] in the preview of the Bride the Onward
[57:23] Christian soldier
[57:28] with the cross of Jesus
[57:33] going on before he ever said Christ must
[57:37] always be please
[57:39] our focal points
[57:42] hallelujah amen now you're wondering
[57:45] where I'm going with this
[57:46] because God has given us
[57:50] land
[57:52] he's given us land he's given us houses
[57:59] almost all the things that we so need in
[58:03] this world
[58:06] establish this
[58:08] we did not establish this
[58:10] this was always
[58:13] established
[58:15] when we got here y'all hear what I'm
[58:18] saying and now these

[1:00:53] not just here in America everything is
[1:00:56] falling apart

[1:01:11] man I'm in Babylon and
[1:01:50] through America
[1:01:53] Road through America saying the British
[1:01:57] is coming
[1:01:58] tonight
[1:02:01] he said I was there
[1:02:07] what happened what happened yes he not
[1:02:10] only stepped in the book
[1:02:13] but he stepped in the history
[1:02:17] and I think that was in Waterloo when he
[1:02:20] was preaching that is
[1:02:23] that there are Waterloo yeah and they
[1:02:28] said that all the ministers got up and
[1:02:29] walked out hey do they mean
[1:02:34] [Music]
[1:02:35] but see everything Christ
[1:02:40] you were there
[1:02:45] and that's what he was saying I am
[1:02:48] identified
[1:02:51] hallelujah amen when George Washington
[1:02:55] across the Delaware
[1:02:57] of it
[1:03:00] Delaware are available
[1:03:05] he said I was there
[1:03:10] I remember you now brother it took a
[1:03:12] while
[1:03:18] you and I must
[1:03:20] understand
[1:03:21] we must go beyond the boundaries
[1:03:27] do you know what I'm saying let's go for
[1:03:29] services somehow
[1:03:32] if you're not careful
[1:03:34] you take the spirit the spirit of the
[1:03:37] church on upon really is
[1:03:41] hmm you're not here to take on this
[1:03:43] churches
[1:03:45] the only Spirit you take on is Christ
[1:03:49] that's where the power is
[1:03:56] that right amen now the thing I'm
[1:04:00] the shoes because brother
[1:04:07] he said
[1:04:09] or the blood of Christ
[1:04:12] is above the Covenant
[1:04:18] you hear what I'm saying
[1:04:21] got a covenant
[1:04:24] unconditional Covenant only if you are
[1:04:27] if you're under the blood
[1:04:31] at least you got somebody say Amen
[1:04:34] it is
[1:04:36] attendance in church
[1:04:46] he said when I see the blood
[1:04:49] I pass over you
[1:04:54] and what I'm trying to say and you've
[1:04:57] heard me say ing you know so many people
[1:04:59] don't like me to say it yeah
[1:05:05] and you've got to go beyond those
[1:05:08] battles
[1:05:13] as long as you stay in the boundaries
[1:05:16] die spiritually
[1:05:19] because God is a progressive God
[1:05:24] is that right amen
[1:05:32] you keep crying out until God
[1:05:35] establishes Zion Hallelujah
[1:05:40] until we see Perfection on the inside
[1:05:44] Hallelujah
[1:05:47] because you'll be able to love your
[1:05:49] brothers as well as your enemy somebody
[1:05:53] help me here you'll act like Christ
[1:06:01] that that'll be the only thing that
[1:06:03] you'll have on your mind
[1:06:08] it's really a matter of life and death
[1:06:11] and death
[1:06:12] because there are so many people
[1:06:16] dying right now can I say it like this
[1:06:20] thinking that they're in the message
[1:06:23] you're not in the message until you're
[1:06:27] in Christ
[1:06:31] you you you might sympathize with it
[1:06:34] you might know it's right
[1:06:36] until you get before God
[1:06:41] to your thoughts and your idea so the
[1:06:45] holy God
[1:06:49] right into that Holy Place
[1:06:52] amen it doesn't matter who you are
[1:06:56] oh my God
[1:06:58] hallelujah amen see when God and this is
[1:07:01] why I read um Joshua the question it's a
[1:07:05] matter of life and death and death
[1:07:07] I'm so afraid that people are not seeing
[1:07:10] it
[1:07:12] we don't even see the
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:24] and look how long it's been
[1:07:27] but now
[1:07:31] but now man no everything he preached we
[1:07:35] see it
[1:07:39] We Believe
[1:07:41] hallelujah amen and if though if the if
[1:07:44] the we are the tear they see is you 90.
[1:07:49] if the tears you 19.
[1:07:54] silly friend
[1:07:57] let me ask you a question
[1:08:01] because we know the terror always grow
[1:08:03] faster
[1:08:06] than the wheat
[1:08:09] is
[1:08:12] are you aware
[1:08:15] that in in this
[1:08:18] congression
[1:08:20] to pass laws
[1:08:25] to kill Christians
[1:08:29] to get rid of you
[1:08:31] I'm trying to tell you something
[1:08:34] it's going to turn
[1:08:36] you see what I'm saying
[1:08:38] because what you got the Liberals you
[1:08:42] got you got Sodom and Gomorrah thank you
[1:08:45] against abrahamas
[1:08:48] if I can say it like that what what you
[1:08:52] got now and it's not just did y'all know
[1:08:55] in Europe
[1:08:56] in Europe
[1:08:58] there is a woman
[1:09:00] who testified
[1:09:02] on social media
[1:09:05] that God Christ healed her he he's the
[1:09:09] loving and she had to go through
[1:09:11] traumatics uh things for two years
[1:09:14] they persecuted her for two years
[1:09:17] I know what I'm talking about there was
[1:09:21] also another man who testified that God
[1:09:24] delivered him from homosexuality
[1:09:29] put him in jail for two years
[1:09:32] they're trying to sign
[1:09:36] think that's going to stay there
[1:09:39] listen to what I'm trying to say
[1:09:42] even among the uh Republicans
[1:09:46] I'm neither one but my point is
[1:09:51] when it comes to that Christians are
[1:09:54] Republicans
[1:09:56] so they're not trying to get rid of the
[1:09:59] Republicans they're trying to get rid of
[1:10:01] the Christians Hallelujah
[1:10:15] and I don't know
[1:10:17] I had to be careful because
[1:10:19] of how I speak against ordinances
[1:10:25] because God raises up and God brings
[1:10:29] down thank you thank you and everything
[1:10:32] none of those people
[1:10:34] if it wasn't for God
[1:10:38] so you can't just speak evil about them
[1:10:41] if God put him there he's ridiculous
[1:10:46] Ah that's the truth so what I'm trying
[1:10:49] to say if he put him there hello there
[1:10:52] for a purpose
[1:10:56] hallelujah amen and what we need to see
[1:11:00] is
[1:11:01] that the purpose you should bring
[1:11:05] persecution on the bride
[1:11:07] is
[1:11:12] oh yeah
[1:11:14] my question is shake it like brother
[1:11:18] Brandon said it
[1:11:19] when the water begins to fall in Noah's
[1:11:23] day
[1:11:24] come
[1:11:25] on
[1:11:28] he said the door was already shut up
[1:11:35] please come if you're not in then
[1:11:40] you will you will not be
[1:11:43] interested this is the
[1:11:46] children
[1:11:47] this is not a time to the pushes to
[1:11:51] enter
[1:11:54] I look in the mirror
[1:11:56] we've got a picture of me when I was
[1:11:58] younger
[1:12:00] photos
[1:12:02] and and it might sound a little carnal
[1:12:06] but when I look at that picture
[1:12:11] man I wasn't so bad looking after all
[1:12:16] boys but when I look at me now
[1:12:21] I said Lord have mercy and
[1:12:24] I don't say that to be funny but the
[1:12:28] truth is y'all know what I'm saying
[1:12:30] some of us who are older we know what we
[1:12:32] used to look like yeah
[1:12:40] it is to invest in this hello emphasis
[1:12:47] it is the soul that needs salvation
[1:12:50] foreign
[1:12:56] hallelujah amen we fail to see
[1:13:02] can come up I'm coming let me read a
[1:13:07] question a quote here
[1:13:08] brother man who says coming from the
[1:13:12] message choosing of a bride uh
[1:13:16] and that's in 1965.
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:20] he said your Eternal Destiny is a choice
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:58] there is a
[1:14:01] yeah
[1:14:04] and it's a dangerous thing for a man or
[1:14:07] woman a boy or girl
[1:14:10] to step across that line yeah
[1:14:18] there's no return yeah
[1:14:23] it might be that time
[1:14:26] that many will make their decision
[1:14:32] where this spin
[1:14:34] the endless eternity
[1:14:39] I don't know about you I should say
[1:14:42] possible
[1:14:43] but I know
[1:14:45] that token must be applied
[1:14:49] and that's what I look for in people
[1:14:52] to see Christ
[1:14:56] you know I know how he behaves I know
[1:14:59] how he acts
[1:15:02] now
[1:15:08] I might as well finish it up
[1:15:11] we look at this thing and yeah
[1:15:14] I'm a reader I'm gonna jump I hit I'm
[1:15:17] sorry I'm gonna jump ahead of myself and
[1:15:19] read a quote here by God's grace
[1:15:23] yeah
[1:15:24] if you don't take this message seriously
[1:15:28] like I was telling somebody you say you
[1:15:32] got the Holy Ghost sent this pain you
[1:15:34] don't even have a prayer life
[1:15:36] you say you got Holy Ghost when you
[1:15:40] don't read your Bible
[1:15:41] you say
[1:15:43] you say
[1:15:44] listen to the message
[1:15:47] let me tell you this is
[1:15:51] you're either dead
[1:15:54] or you need Revival
[1:16:01] you understand what I'm saying so what
[1:16:04] you can only judge that
[1:16:06] but how can you love God
[1:16:09] you never talk to
[1:16:11] talk
[1:16:15] it's the truth when people get quiet
[1:16:18] because
[1:16:28] people don't like me preaching like this
[1:16:31] but Bible said judgment first began
[1:16:39] I can preach you some deeper things
[1:16:48] you know if the token is on display
[1:16:50] we won't have the confusion we have
[1:16:55] but that's true
[1:17:00] is that right because the token is not
[1:17:04] only the spirit of Love is
[1:17:06] the spirit
[1:17:08] yes
[1:17:12] is that right when troubles go bad
[1:17:17] Hallelujah the token knows how to
[1:17:19] correct it
[1:17:25] right amen coming from the mess
[1:17:28] it's kind of warm in here so I'm gonna
[1:17:30] slow it down Christ is the mystery
[1:17:32] 19 years
[1:17:35] brother Brandon says this is God's great
[1:17:40] mystery of Love expressed
[1:17:45] that God and man became one
[1:17:50] see the world the whole thing is God and
[1:17:53] man wait one two seconds
[1:17:57] God and man was one year alone
[1:18:03] and God and man is one here
[1:18:08] she's what it is
[1:18:11] being filled with his Spirit
[1:18:15] him having preeminence
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:25] does he have preeminism
[1:18:33] that was God's achievement
[1:18:37] purpose to do that
[1:18:39] he might be in Christ
[1:18:42] Christ in us
[1:18:45] and all together
[1:18:48] the Holy Spirit one
[1:18:55] right the Holy Spirit same thing
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:02] Christ
[1:19:12] he sounds
[1:19:14] is that right
[1:19:17] I like this how many times
[1:19:27] something
[1:19:30] moves you
[1:19:32] stop it
[1:19:39] that's simple Faith
[1:19:42] you knew you had a foot to stop it
[1:19:48] so you used it without even thinking it
[1:19:52] you understand what I'm saying so that's
[1:19:55] how Faith Works when you know God is in
[1:19:58] it you don't have to look for him
[1:20:01] and you use him
[1:20:07] the word automatically comes
[1:20:12] Hallelujah many other afflictions of the
[1:20:15] righteous but God delivered
[1:20:19] all of them
[1:20:25] delivered to he goes on to say hey
[1:20:28] continue 475
[1:20:34] 475 in the same
[1:20:38] that could say all this through Moses
[1:20:42] let there come frogs
[1:20:45] the same one could stand up there
[1:20:51] let this water be turned to wine
[1:20:56] is that is that right yes he's the same
[1:21:00] God
[1:21:02] the same one remember
[1:21:05] one thing I love about brother Branham
[1:21:10] but one of the scriptures that really he
[1:21:12] meditated on and thought about it
[1:21:18] was whatsoever you say
[1:21:21] if you say to this mountain
[1:21:24] whatsoever you say two seconds he saw it
[1:21:28] in the world
[1:21:30] and once you see something in the world
[1:21:36] and you have to say Lord
[1:21:39] manifest yourself manifest through this
[1:21:42] word is that right amen it's something
[1:21:47] I never wanted to know what that meant
[1:21:50] yeah
[1:21:51] if you see the word and you don't
[1:21:54] understand it and you want to know what
[1:21:57] it means
[1:21:59] we'll make that word come to life
[1:22:02] in your life
[1:22:04] did he do it for the prophet that's why
[1:22:08] he did it for the problem
[1:22:09] so that you and I can see he'll do it
[1:22:13] for us
[1:22:19] hey
[1:22:20] so simple example
[1:22:24] he just don't change
[1:22:28] it's God in man
[1:22:31] that's his manifestation he saw some
[1:22:34] manifestation and this is where people
[1:22:35] fall short
[1:22:40] s
[1:22:41] and I'm gonna say this
[1:22:46] is
[1:22:47] a quote yeah thank you too
[1:22:51] why it never was brother Brandon
[1:22:55] always crying
[1:23:00] and you don't have to say amen I really
[1:23:03] don't care um
[1:23:09] and you know when I say things like that
[1:23:12] trying to take away the office of
[1:23:15] brother Brown
[1:23:20] how can I take away his office
[1:23:24] his office has already been established
[1:23:27] it lives to this day
[1:23:31] hallelujah amen the thing is you better
[1:23:35] find yours
[1:23:36] you need to find your position
[1:23:42] amen hallelujah amen what do you think
[1:23:45] Elijah
[1:23:47] would have been thinking about
[1:23:49] if he just always thought about Elijah
[1:23:54] he didn't even ask for Elijah
[1:24:00] the question was where is the god
[1:24:06] that's what we want foreign
[1:24:16] things I thought I'd bring but you know
[1:24:20] when it comes to
[1:24:24] God
[1:24:28] and his children this is awful
[1:24:32] God always worked with them
[1:24:35] and if you've got eyes to see
[1:24:42] you know right from wrong
[1:24:45] hallelujah amen and you know I want to
[1:24:49] say this and and and and and I want to
[1:24:52] iterate it I want to really emphasize it
[1:24:59] is above the Covenant
[1:25:04] right
[1:25:06] rehab
[1:25:08] was given a covenant
[1:25:11] but the Covenant was this
[1:25:14] display the token
[1:25:43] hallelujah amen right now listen the
[1:25:47] prophet God said it wasn't for the lamb
[1:25:49] Delano
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:56] hallelujah amen because the lamb was
[1:25:59] Jesus
[1:26:00] the life in the blood was gone
[1:26:06] is that right it was the spirit
[1:26:09] when I see the life of God in you
[1:26:14] yes
[1:26:18] I walk with brother brown
[1:26:24] but that is not what God is
[1:26:28] looking for the token lives

[1:26:41] choose this day everybody
[1:26:43] yes
[1:26:45] like Joshua say choose you this
[1:26:48] Publishers
[1:26:51] hallelujah amen the saddest thing about
[1:26:54] it
[1:26:56] brother Brandon brought a word that
[1:27:04] exposure
[1:27:06] hello amen
[1:27:10] let me say it like this
[1:27:12] Paul must have had a terrible time
[1:27:17] trying to convince the Jews
[1:27:20] that their Traditions were wrong
[1:27:26] that the only thing that counts now
[1:27:28] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:32] all your Works nothing
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:51] she wasn't really religious and it tip
[1:27:54] she wasn't religious she was a Christian
[1:27:58] she was saved she went born again she
[1:28:03] had the Life of Christ
[1:28:09] with the Life of Christ
[1:28:19] This is how we fight about it
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:27] brother Adam said
[1:28:29] the Holy Ghost is the token
[1:28:32] that we have been pardoned because
[1:28:35] if the case is closed
[1:28:38] to every man and woman
[1:28:41] that truly has received the baptism of
[1:28:45] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:47] he has been tried
[1:28:50] he is identified with his attorney
[1:28:56] with his sacrifice
[1:28:59] and the token he holds in his possession
[1:29:02] it shows that his trip his trip is paid
[1:29:06] to Glory
[1:29:12] he holds
[1:29:15] I've got a handkerchief in my eyes
[1:29:40] and what's on the inside

[1:30:18] foreign
[1:30:59] let me ask you a question
[1:31:01] what about that man who's got a better
[1:31:03] house
[1:31:08] that doesn't signify anything
[1:31:12] I told somebody the other day I said
[1:31:14] because God love you don't mean you
[1:31:16] saved
[1:31:18] they looked at me like what

[1:36:47] hallelujah amen and when it comes down
[1:36:51] let me I'm gonna close this but one of
[1:36:55] the things that always uh I won't say
[1:36:58] always but uh it captures me
[1:37:01] La shows
[1:37:03] when Jesus Christ was on the cross
[1:37:06] brother by Adam said it like this he did
[1:37:10] not have a lowing cloth
[1:37:13] he had nothing covering his name
[1:37:18] and how humiliating that was
[1:37:21] saying
[1:37:25] God of Holiness
[1:37:32] personally I can't imagine
[1:37:35] what that must have felt like
[1:37:39] hallelujah amen you know I am a real
[1:37:41] particular person
[1:37:43] yeah I don't just dress naked around my
[1:37:46] house
[1:37:54] I had a before and after picture
[1:37:57] I was trying to lose weight
[1:38:03] and I took a picture of myself
[1:38:07] with my shirt off
[1:38:09] I think uh
[1:38:11] so you know my children never seen me
[1:38:13] like that yeah
[1:38:15] but one of my grand
[1:38:17] s
[1:38:19] got my got my
[1:38:21] mic
[1:38:23] I got pictures and he saw that one yeah
[1:38:34] and he showed his sister
[1:38:42] I felt stripped violated
[1:38:50] and I I didn't spank him but I just told
[1:38:53] him you know guys
[1:38:59] but then you're gonna show your sister
[1:39:05] you know what I mean
[1:39:07] all of that
[1:39:09] get my shirt off icious
[1:39:16] all he gay had was his nakedness
[1:39:24] and I'm closing on this all he has with
[1:39:27] his nakedness
[1:39:31] and all God
[1:39:32] it was his naked word
[1:39:35] of a uh
[1:39:38] he exposed himself so you can see yeah
[1:39:42] the real revelation of who he is
[1:39:46] he don't want you adding to it
[1:39:49] take away from it
[1:39:51] if you've never been to Calvary you
[1:39:55] never understand who
[1:39:56] is
[1:39:58] just to save you
