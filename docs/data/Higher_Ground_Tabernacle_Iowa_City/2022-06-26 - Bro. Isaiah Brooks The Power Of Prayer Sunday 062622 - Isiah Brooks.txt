[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] james fifth chapter i'll try my best to take it a little slow to this morning oh the subject is a real serious one um and i trust this be such a blessing to you and it will change your life james the fifth chapter once again and we're going to begin reading at the 16th verse universe the verses everybody there and it reads confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much elias was a man subjected like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit universe says amen let us pray for you father god we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you have done for us that you will bless each and every heart should be amen amen you may be seated it was a sword uh as you may uh guess that gift will because everybody here this morning we have our idea of what prayer is [Music] and often times prayer is uh not answered by god because we take the wrong approach prayer is not just asking god even though the bible says seek and he shall find a knock in the door shall be this morning there's a little chili here this morning so you can have a background okay okay i looked and didn't see them but i just didn't look far enough thank you thank you i myself i'm learning prayer i'm learning what it really is and i often wondered why people in the old testament get greater results even though they weren't even taught how to pray but we understand that prayer is always an inspiration it's it's an atmosphere that we must find ourselves the bible tells us the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much one of the things that i so desire in a great way and that is to have such a prayer life that it will bring me in the oneness of god we have heard that prayer changes things we [Music] didn't know god would be a pro collector is that right we have an example here's our example john the baptist who never was educated but he knew god in such [Music] when you talk but it brings you into an atmosphere man downs and atmospheres there are times when we pray silently that kind of prayer will put you to sleep because it's difficult to get into prayer silently silence you is more but there are times when your silent prayer takes you to another level you see it's the atmosphere where you said to the atmosphere the dimensions god takes us to [Music] and we're not talking about walking with the bible or some word on on on animal skin [Music] but enoch knew god in the most simple and no calculus and so enoch in the spirit walk with god hello then listen hallelujah amen and you and i have heard many times prayer changes things and sometimes god will allow tragical things to come we should be reaching for a higher plane in james 5 15. jackson the bible says the effectual fervent la pierre he said that's desperation effectual fervent [Music] [Music] oh [Music] uh either which one you want to call it but when our soul gets in desperation in travailing an effectual fervent prayer of a man that can show the token it does something he said notice what the bible says here listen um see having no faults ask people to pray for you accomplish our people confessing our faults unconfessed one to another confession one for another [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that [Music] [Music] the prophet of god likened it as the placing of a son in other words you've got to mature hallelujah you've got to obviously they're god's places he's at the pentecostals where they failed see like it's on fire you thought because you were born of the spirit spirit of god the birthright that settled it that settled it but it only starts it [Music] it had right [Music] it did not prove out to be an obedience [Music] and god is watching every move we make is you and i must understand who's your person don't [Music] when the holy ghost fell upon the pentecostal people [Music] act like a child [Music] [Music] and you and i realize amen and you've heard me read the scriptures many times these are four we we want to just get on our knees sometimes not even on our knees and we just want to ask god for things come and say yes god give me yes [Music] that you can come into the king's presence like that acknowledging you're wrong [Music] [Music] it will conversation in order to make a rapture fulfill for my life your prayer life be in line there must be a connection whatever it is hallelujah amen amen because god talks to you basketball prayer he takes you into that atmosphere you can hear him say things no man no and you know [Music] what let me say it again let's see what they did if you pray right now everybody will have to pray for you whenever you can follow the holy ghost you say where do you get that from the bible says on the day of pentecost individuals praying for themselves there was no laying of the hands of them [Music] when you call on the name of jesus for mom we need to know that once i've come up here it's accentuated think about that woman fancy or sit from it's a story brother branham tales in genesis this auntie who had a son who was sick and he had gotten sick by [Music] for the level than the enemy plea okay y'all understand what i'm saying prayer makes you look down [Music] and to somebody else i'm that that's like that shooting my woman where is your elijah she didn't know that the anointing of god [Music] do you know me she says no hey the prophet she said i prayed and prayed did he get jesus and i said lord you gave me this boy but where is elijah hallelujah so i prayed and pray and god he said this morning a little for a day the lord told me to come out here and stand at this point [Music] was on her back the dew the water the dude [Music] she prayed el april and god say stand a jew at the time god [Music] and when you come to know the voice of god you don't need to hear nobody else's voice hallelujah is that right the voice of god is more than the voice that's on the table [Music] from the throne of god hallelujah yes sir the lord told me to come out here your back was wet with dew hey [Music] you're not even a son of god if you don't believe in the leading of god faith god they are the sons of spirit when you come down the street said i know and just driving on the highway better comfortable highway he would say don't go this way and then when you go the way god wants you to go like that later there was an accident texas what exactly with david mcgarry y'all know how fast they drive down there we came to an intersection made the man of god stopped a draft alone did you there was no there was no accident in play we didn't see anything but as soon as he stopped accidentally piled up the cars i was coming off the ramp uh the highway to take the the yellow light pushing me to take the yellow light hey look what you there yeah [Music] is what i'm saying is that that's how god [Music] [Music] [Music] and this man came with his pit bull or whatever that was a yeah and i'm giving you a bacon no it wasn't a pit bull it was one of those other big dogs land they said anyway he was big enough i thought about the the bees you know how uh japan the love of god stop the bees [Music] uh [Music] i least expected it here in des moines the dog broke the chain uh [Music] i grabbed on the branch i was gonna break [Music] is when i when i do jog or run congestion or something like that my atmosphere what god did for the prophet he'll do for you [Music] said he when he he he wanted to hear her pray the prophet he said you knew she had talked to god before [Music] talking to him like a brother before his balance you can confront him like a the fact he'll come back to you whatever you let him be okay important i can't tell you how much i don't even pray enough margin pre-memphis you hear me i don't pray i pray but i don't pray hallelujah [Music] but be in heaven [Music] amen we must abide in that your kind of glory no never mind we don't see it he used that very scripture he literally said that he means [Music] [Music] [Music] i've heard this before but i just heard it and he says you know we as christians we we think we're okay but you see that's not the end of our journey and of our journey is to go beyond the vehicle see as long as your life is going like this [Music] moving [Music] [Music] he can't be nothing but a real genuine christian they don't hear the things of the world god never come for just any haphazard way listen he said prayer is not a perhaps in the past it's a sincere thing is [Music] uh [Music] jones and so forth and then why and see the street he says that's not prayer deepest then after the worship of prayer [Music] [Music] up to the shekinah glory by the golden part of manner where you can eat at any time soul is refreshed and blooming [Music] abiding if you abide in me my words abide in you will yeah it'll be given to you you see the failures of the church the pentecostal church it's a failing to do that abiding grace of [Music] yes those things are fine i have nothing to say against them of god oh i mean interpretation of tongues it's the same thing but all these other things prophecies they're all of these things but they're no good [Music] [Music] because you go to know the will of god important the connection is that right she said it is an abiding presence to know the will of god then you don't look what the world is going to say about you it's what god said then you're living in his presence i love with vader's presence hallelujah i know there's a lot of reading just like this but my point a word that can't live important tested and it cannot die and [Music] is [Music] [Music] because we haven't kept up our end we haven't kept up our end of the bargain if you want to say it like that if you do what you're supposed to do second you see guarding you know it's like this i don't i don't get jealous of the alcoholic or more you know all all of the things that we see out here that's perverted you know [Music] [Music] [Music] but that taught in school houses man that's taught in schoolhouses the church the church is the place to know god jesus christ y'all hear what i'm saying you know when god doesn't move it it's a frightening thing can't you this is [Music] still [Music] [Music] but one day my angel samson's decided samson said he's going to pray he literally prayed he didn't say a lot of words oh lord once more you understand me [Music] sick and tired there's something seeing god moving our lives hallelujah we serve a supernatural god lucifer nature hallelujah can i go just a little bit further especially i'm gonna bring it to you one more time it's the atmosphere two seconds of support see just the atmosphere i have been guilty of getting on my knees not waiting for the atmosphere to change the atmosphere and you know the devil makes sure the atmosphere doesn't change is that right how many times you have praised now you're just entering into the atmosphere just in just that moment [Music] don't want you to move he knows what he's doing he decides to confess and if he can't break it that way he'll send somebody by your house pay any attention to the bell because they can always come back yeah right when the doorbell rings [Music] ignore it and you cry out the more [Music] you know we've gotta we've got to center and you know concentrate and and focus when we get to prayer because remember when that desperate time came for jesus you know we get down here with these little prayers and man five minutes maybe ten and uh maybe they [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] this morning [Music] [Music] you'll see something happening [Music] don't know yeah it's god to be in one accord with motive in shows then you're going to see something happen [Music] no use i see one person shaking their head why do you think everything you've been bombarded with all kinds of the thought because the devil don't want you to pray this is why satan fights you you did [Music] quiet we [Music] [Music] you know you're going to eventually ride that bicycle keep at it right and you keep knocking on that dog will continue it's going to be open el salvador and i believe that's all over the world we just the devil has played so many things things of distraction the shows pull up from praying they don't got their lungs that appear this may not sound like it's worth much but i'll tell you what the sun fires [Music] [Music] and know that the great omnipotent god is present that's the key knowing his presence is ready to do all things without one shot of doubt it'll even have an effect upon the unbelievers foreign see what the devil has been stealing from us there's millions perhaps i guess people are reading their bible god and then you take his word bring it back to him really believe it you see the one with the issue of blood said farmer there was nobody teaching her personal life there was no scripture it is written if you touch the come from [Music] because the word was right [Music] [Music] a gentile believer he believed in jesus when the jews wasn't believing speak the word i know my servant will be healed just second on service hallelujah what was that hallelujah what about the woman that met at simon's house that's the box full of ointment [Music] [Music] that prayer is so important church of the living god have thrived on sea legal people when the catholic church was burning [Music] they had already come in contact with god nothing but the truth one more example you take stephen when they begin to stone steel come and say hallelujah brother brown said god rocked him to [Music] somebody [Music] [Music] lord hold not these things to their they had [Applause] y'all understand what i'm
