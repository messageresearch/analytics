welcome you once again lord jesus this is your inheritance that you the these people are your people pray that you would minister to us according to our needs in your lovely name jesus christ we pray for you amen amen you may be seated i want to minister uh this morning on the subject the age of the omnipotent [Music] preached a message in more than one he preached in 1956 about on the junction of time and in this message was uh really some powerful statements but i i fear that uh a lot of people are not seeing the what's happening now la prepared in this age [Music] [Applause] and god a jew will come to perfection [Music] he tells us that omnipotence inside the cave importance comes on the scene via oc and when omnipotence come on the scene of the potassium the miraculous always happens hallelujah to speak of omnipotence omnipotence is the all powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence i'm going to pause there because no matter how much basket we say [Music] to vindicate us [Music] omnipotence to vindicate him by the miraculous hallelujah the things in which god did through him [Music] is [Music] [Applause] and i believe that the church is now standing okay he's a chairman at a threshold or vehicle the church is not standing in a position of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known there has been amen when brother branham was speaking of this conflict he was literally talking about god and his coming that god was getting ready we'll find out that that it was the saddest scene of god in the whole bible in the whole bible here with jesus christ he said that was such a sad scene he can sit there hallelujah amen like the prophet of god he was dealing with the mystery of christ in his church hallelujah [Music] [Music] the spirit representing representatives hallelujah amen because of all of the church she was the most beautiful hallelujah she had beautiful gifts she had beautiful she she had beautiful everything yeah she was so beautiful she thought within herself enriched get moisturized [Music] [Music] and i thought it was really wonderful the the the the sea yeah the animals or the fish in the sea hallelujah and he said in in this respect if you take the fish out of the sea they will die hallelujah and he said the seas from the earth the uh he said but when god created man he created man from himself he took god he took man out of himself and if you separate man from god did you like the fish from the sea like the trees from the earth hallelujah amen so you and i know i don't know we uh separate ourselves from god hallelujah we will die every man that separates himself from the creator so we see that man is in a constant state of dying okay and we can see throughout the history of israel god always made some kind of atonement for men to listen hallelujah but the thing that i'm trying to get to like because you said it was up there it's the very fact that things do not change in other words solomon said there's no new thing under the sun hallelujah it's it's very laughable when we see science carnivorous thinking bouncing that they are the first to arrive at whatever point they were that that the science of yesterday than the science today and in all of our achievements hallelujah about these germs that we're now dealing with they say they say eating diseases we'll be hallelujah [Music] the lord so we realized amen that that god is calling for something that's the minister that we are living just at the near appearing of the second time of the coming of the lord jesus christ so we know [Music] hallelujah we're at a time that we must understand that we must be careful attention on how we live evil and why was she spoon for me she refused to obey the word i understand what i'm saying now we know nobody can dance dance repeat dancing like the layers of the scenes come later on this year huh nobody can dance like the pentecostals y'all better hear what i'm saying oh speak in see the seed that god say that william branham fought our harvest of omnipotence [Music] is [Music] you may have heard me say this before but it goes back to the bloodline you see this is one of the reasons why cain could not receive the blessings of god must he mixed with hagar he had to mix with somebody that was of his true blood abraham develop to inherit or to to get something from god amen you understand me reason being he did not come from eden hallelujah yeah even though he was born in eden memphis both seeds totally decimals are planted in the same field but it is the nature of the seeds that determines we know that we cannot just behave is amen is that right yes see god god is it's amazing he amazes me soul with the contaminated things of the world and it goes on to say and you watched about this body you watch what you eat in your body are taken to your body he said but that's soul suc i know one thing are you saying shows i believe with all my heart it's something that tells me that the bride of christ the priest is in this place amen i may not know exactly who you are but i have a duty to point out things they did the shows so that you can see okay hallelujah [Music] no will he said as that we must be about our father's business [Music] it's not a church [Music] william branham indictment on laodicea you like dick and i found her guilty when i think uh and at that time she was like spewing from god but god gave me a dream made you by the name of songs vision i can't remember what you were in the vision experience but he said i kept seeing myself back to where i used to work and i was doing some shady deals that his purpose for being here hallelujah that's why things were not going right because he was laying off of the field no matter where she is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for an example one of the first junctions for example hallelujah and what were they preaching pressure god is getting ready to destroy you hallelujah amen the prophet says when the omnipotent and he brings these people all these beings he's oh you understand me we're complaining and even though they didn't understand i'm seeing them back on this show that god had blinded that age just like he blinded laodicea hallelujah the bible also tells us that jesus christ is the same jesus hallelujah amen god is not a god of shortcuts hallelujah god will never take you journey upon the easy way near facility hallelujah why because when you go the easy way you don't want to finish hallelujah but when you work hard so if god could say hello [Music] we're failing to as we know him [Music] they're trying to kill us off jesus hallelujah understand that's a sign that we're living in noah's day getting to six genesis that violence was throughout the whole world hallelujah today we can see men uh marrying and giving in marriage come on people amen the truth of the matter is women the problem is is untranslated trying to make themselves look more beautiful but let me tell you something sisters they say above the insurance yeah we're living in a day man wearing makeup now there's some fun in this day you know this the flesh will never be satisfied give it a little while give it a little while all right a little time and you won't be satisfied once your rapper satisfied the second with it you'll have to get something else done the next thing oh i like that one too oh my god it's like going in a grocery store so come and trade down there they got a sale on candy bars he's all uh uh you only went there for one you saw the the balboa hallelujah but because they got a sale on it you're gonna get more than you he is the only satisfying portion we know in the days of nowhere it was a it was a an escalation a hype in in sexual activity la sexuality after this call of duty so is it here now it's a concern did you know that in the state of washington on the west coast so y'all got quiet well if it's illegal that means people been doing it all alone sincerely i'm trying to get you to see this vision of what i think do you [Music] hey you must totally separate whatever you say hallelujah from all the worldly things that shows you any and everything they are hinder your growth in christ foreign the holy ghost the sentence free will make you know the probably god said it like this he said when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose too hallelujah so we don't fear i don't know we must comply make no difference to whatever god's will i'm going to give you something god never join us ask you something to do or ask you to do something when he [Music] i know this is not a shouting message let us see this in order for us to make a rapture we're going to push down our left god if you're if that makes sense she's in love i'm facing my notes but i'm gonna try to get back here oh my god so in in this time and i caught the thought that means he kept striking the same area sometimes more than once pleading for he had he had to make sure that everything was fitting he took choice hallelujah so are the preachers of this day like this doesn't matter how long you've been in the nation what really matters take your calls how long the message has been taken amen is that right yes because once the message is in you in the foreign hallelujah we know what it is now think about this yesterday there must have been he's watching for a lot of people attending those church at the beginning participated but as time progressed may come later the church got cold dead and dropped off hallelujah so much solo and see amen the only people he had left was his family personally somebody helped me here so you realize even in noah's day a member of the time without the tribulation preach the message one in a million it's not enough because i say i'm that one if you're refusing to live like that once a [Music] they had all the gifts and they had the character character why you say that because they were the seeds that had to fall in the ground [Music] [Music] becomes blind [Music] is [Music] what the age of ephesus was like seeking but now that the word has been restored hallelujah the sons of god can now take their positions [Music] wherever jesus is hallelujah the moment you control your worship control [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh i tell people i said at least when you go to the catholic church you get more excitement i'd like to see somebody hit the floor in here [Music] [Music] so what i'm trying to say you know you know i tell people to say by the time you've given me the holy spirit [Music] oh my god hallelujah and it's so by our previous teachings that's wrong and see whether i say what the message in the bible is saying second one is your pressure can you hear what i'm saying you know and i know that there are preachers in this message things [Music] y'all looking at me like i'm crazy [Music] where you cannot go hallelujah amen i'm not going to tell you why you're not about you don't think that that god has grieved with a lot of people i'm trying to get us into a place where character is formed one might [Music] of your lord and it is the blood of jesus he's never done this before [Music] [Music] amen [Music] mark four saint mark four mccoy you don't have the term mach 4 yes mark 37 241 and he's emphasizing things about jesus he is he's a sister that shows man see because you got to understand the new world will have nothing like this in it there will be no sickness there will be no pain it's what he's doing with us he's preparing us for the next in the world because you know there's two they said there are two worlds yeah did you know that there's one that is beneath the other one is [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah so what is he doing amen remember the slave story where there's one slave who uh said you didn't have the best i'm gonna catch up with him in just a minute just hold up [Music] [Music] i look at these things and i think cuz which i am growing i don't have to wonder will the rapture come or is it coming this is why i'm yelling [Music] driver because i remember when just being a little bit late i'm running and then you sit there getting mad at the bus driver hey i paid you to function hallelujah the bus driver didn't make you late and so if any of us miss the rapture don't get mad at i'm looking at this message in a way i'm getting closer i'm getting more excited i'm looking at this thing and i'm like yes i said i'm gonna get it [Applause] mark i don't mean to keep you long i lost my watch somebody stole it it's the
