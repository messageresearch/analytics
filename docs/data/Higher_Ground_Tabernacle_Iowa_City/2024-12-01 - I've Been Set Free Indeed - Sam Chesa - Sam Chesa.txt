amen amen Amen Let Us open our Bibles to the Book of John in chapter 8 and verse uh 36 it's good to see each and everyone was able to make it this Sunday morning amen amen John chapter 8 and verse 36 John the Bible says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed turn around to your neighbor and say you shall be free indeed amen amen while we're saying let us open our Bibles to the Book of Leviticus chap 25 and verse 8 25 and verse 8 the Bible reads and thou sht number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven time seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto you unto thee 49 years then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout your land and ye shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family [Music] and verse 13 reads in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word amen amen for a short while I want to speak on um I've been set free indeed I've been set free indeed in The Book of Leviticus where we read God gave the children of Israel a statute or a Commandment that after every 49 years the 50th year he called it a Year of Jubilee amen and the Year of Jubilee meant that each and everyone who had been bound or lost their possession during those 49 years when they hear the trumpet of Jubilee it meant that if you were bound you have to be set free amen when you hear the trumpet of Jubilee you knew that you could walk back and take back your possession Hallelujah and wish she God had already opened Grace for them in the Old Testament it said whatever you had done it does not matter what it was you had to go free even if they had the records that you committed a crime but because that trumpet has sound a jubilee you had to go free and God said on the 10th day of the seventh month this is when the trumpet would be sounded and we know that the 10th day of the seventh month was the day of atonement where the high priest would walk in with a ball of blood and he would sprinkle it on The Mercy Seat he would sprinkle it on the mercy seed that was in the holy of holies and he was atoning for the sins of all the children of Israel and we know that that was a type of what was coming in the New Testament so each and every 10th day of the seventh month on the Year of Jubilee Aaron would go in and sprinkle that blood and say and God would forgive all their sins but all that was a type of of the New Testament and we knew that Christ came as the high priest that was doing away with the priesthood of Aaron and he was coming in as the high priest that's touched by the feeling of our [Music] infirmities so the day of atonement was signify that day on Calvary amen but in the Old Testament the blood that Aon would put on the mer SE it it did not erase it did not erase the sins it just covered them but when the high priest came Jesus Christ he was not only covering the sins but he was erasing all of them as if you have never done it in the first place amen amen so on the 10th day of the seventh month the high priest would go blowing that trumpet so people had lost some of their inheritance that Joshua had a portion to them when they left Egypt maybe they got in debt or they committed a crime their land would be taken or their families and their children will be taken to be slaves and they start working for their task Masters to try and uh to to to try and uh atone for what they had done but but on the 50th year it does not matter whe that they were in the field as soon as they hear the trumpet each and every man knew they had to draw instrument they were using and they would run out shouting I'm free things that used to bind me they don't bind me no more Hallelujah and we know that Israel is the type of the bride and we had a bigger Jubilee that sounded for you and me when Christ was on Calvary and he shouted it is finished that was a jubilee for you and me whatever they used to bind you it don't bind you no more amen amen so everyone who had lost their property [Music] they would have to walk back and grab it it doesn't matter who was on there you say it is my god- given right I'm taking it back do you have a promise of yours that Satan is trying to fight you for you not to get it you got to walk to him and say I've heard the message of the hour I've heard the trumpet of Jubilee I'm taking back my god-given possession I'm taking my god-given health Hallelujah I'm taking my god-given peace the prophet of God says Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or brought back to their rightful position they were being brought back to their rightful position so which means at some point in time they had lost their rightful position the prophet told us that we were born Sons amen we were born Sons but we just didn't know it because we had Amnesia but thank God for the message of the hour that came to open our eyes to show us our rightful position because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity but as soon as you hear that trumpet sound that scene has no hold over you no more that iniquity has no hold over you anymore because God's grace was there to bring you back to your rightful position Hallelujah don't think you were just born here to grow up until you die you were born with a purpose amen the Bible says we were predestinated sons of God predestinated before the foundation of the world remember God told Jeremiah before you were formed in your mother's wom I knew you before you were even conceived I knew you so he already had a purpose for him he was going to be a prophet before he was even [Music] born each and every child of God has a purpose amen amen in this world they tell you you can become whatever you want you shouldn't become whatever you want you should become what God wants you to be because he is the one who has their purpose for you he is the one who he is the one who created you when you buy a device or anything that you have to assemble you have to to go and try and find the owner's manual and this owner's manual was written by the person who created it you can say I'm smart and you will spend five hours trying to figure out which P which piece goes where but all you need to do go find the user manual that was created by the maker of it and it will tell you the interned purpose of it God has your us manual it is written what you were supposed to do what your internal purpose is so if you go to him he will tell you your purpose amen amen Hallelujah but Satan he tries to bring sin and confuse us so that we lose our position but we thank God for his grace we thank God for the message of the jub that came to remind us that you have been free in the from the first place go back to where you belong go back to your position Amen in a jubile the prophet of God says says many hundred years has passed but the same God that sent the jubilees in them days is the same God who sends jubilees today all the people that had been captured that was in captivity come an acceptable year where the trumpet sounded and all the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay any price they could absolutely Go free they could drop their ho if they were hoing whatever instrument they were working with they would have to drop it because the trumpet has sounded without money or without price you have to go back to your position I'm here to tell you that the blood of Christ was enough to pay for the promises all you just have to do is walk back and claim it because it belongs to you amen amen in return in Jubilee the prophet of God says he says somehow the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God there came a year called The Jubilee year every seven years they had to rest and in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a Freeborn and true blooded Israelite no matter who held the position it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance the Israelites could go free but the slaves could not amen and we know we Are Spiritual Israel amen if you are bought by the blood of Christ and you are saved you are a child of Abraham and that guarantees you each and every promise that God has for the children of Abraham amen the promise is only for the predestinated seed hallelujah amen how many believe they are predestinated this morning Hallelujah if you raise your hand God's promise is to you amen not no one else and on the 10th day of the seventh month these sins would would be forgiven but we now know that the sea the sins are thrown in the sea of forgetfulness once God forgives you he does not remember I had one brother went to um he went to Brother brandham and says brother Bram I always feel guilty about a sin I committed a while ago he says every time I just feel guilty and I keep on repenting about it I keep on kneeling down and say Lord I'm sorry about this thing that I did the prophet of God told him you know what every time you kneel down to pray God is hearing that sin for the first time because he doesn't remember it when you kneel down to pray say Lord I'm sorry for what I did he doesn't even remember what it is because he already forgave you and he does not remember but the people people never forget when God when God throws it in the sea of forgetfulness we have very good fishermen that like taking a rod and throw it in that sea of forgetfulness and reel it out no matter how much you have changed they'll come to you and says we have the receipts 10 years ago you did this you did that I don't care about that God says I never did in the first place if you confessed it God forgave it it does not matter what people say what matters is what does God say about it and God's word says I'm Justified I haven't even done it in the first place amen so brother sister if you have confessed it you haven't even done it in the first place God does not remember it do not let men or Satan try to condemn you for something God already forgave you because him who the son has set free free indeed there is no going back Hallelujah so when the priest was going to sacrifice for this day of atonement they were examining the lamb that was representing the people and God told them God take a lamb that does not have any blemish and this lamb was representing people that had blemishes and when the priest was examining this lamb he would see that he doesn't have any fault he doesn't have any spot or wrinkle or any blemish and they'll say this is a perfect lamb and they would sacrifice it so the perfect lamb was representing the people but the priest was not examining the people he was examining the lamb that was representing the people so examining the perfect lamb was signifying that the people have been made perfect amen so God he provided his lamb when he wanted to pay the ultimate sacrifice he sent a lamb his own son Jesus Christ and before he went to Calvary they sent him to be examined pilate says I find no fault in him this man is perfect they couldn't find a reason why they were crucifying him what were they doing they were fulfilling the scriptures the lamb had to be examined and Jesus Christ was the perfect lamb that did not commit any sin he was the only man who never ever committed any sin hallelujah amen so when they looked at the perfect lamb Christ who was representing you and me Christ did not have any blemish or spot or wrinkle he was perfect so when you got to God In Prayer he does not look at your mistakes he looks at the lamb and the lamb is Christ who is perfect Hallelujah so we can stand perfect and blameless before God because he does not look at you and me he looks at the lamb that he sent to us hallelujah when you were supposed to be guilty he looks at the lamb the lamb say is not guilty when you are unworthy he looks at the lamb and the lamb says it's worthy so he looks at the lamb and examines the Lamb on your behalf and he see the lamb is perfect so you can stand before him blameless and perfect the prophet of God says that's the way it is today we are guilty unworthy and she die we are guilty and unworthy we should die we are not worthy of leaving we are not worthy to even come to Christ we are not worthy to ask for anything but God never looks at your unworthiness Hallelujah he looked at the lamb now if he can find no fault in Christ then you are free if he can't find fault in the lamb then there is no fault in the person either see he died in your stad there's no fault with him so you are free God doesn't examine you he examines the lamb you say I'm not worthy to walk out of this wheelchair that's why you are not worthy but God doesn't examine you he examined Christ is worthy then you can walk out of that wheelchair depends on what you think about it you can say brother Bram I'm an Al I'm an I'm an awful woman I've lived illegally I've even broke my marriage vows and you can say Mr Bram I tell you I've been a drunker I've done this I've done that but no matter what you done God never looks at you he looks at the lamb and he has already accepted the lamb so you are free God can't see you he sees the lamb that dies in your stad Hallelujah that's enough to make you shout when you think about it upon the basis of the word hallelujah it makes me get so much joy to know that God does not look at me Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is perfect so all my mistakes God does not see them he looks at Christ in my on my behalf and because Christ shed his blood for me being set free indeed turn around to your neighbor and say I've set free indeed hallelujah amen so atonement is a Reconciliation between God and man because sin separated God from his people but the high priest would go sprinkle that blood to for God to forgive the sins so he can be reconciled back to his people and the Old Testament was a shadow of the new if you open our Bibles to the Book of Luke 4 and verse 17 Luke the scenery we are reading is when Jesus had gone to the um synagogue and they say every day in the synagogue when they went to church they gave seven men that would have to open the scroll and read it and Jesus was the seventh man to read the scroll and he was given the Bible which was the SC the Scrolls in that day and it says and there was delivered unto him a book of the Prophet isas say Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he unto them this day this scripture as fulfilled in your ears Hallelujah he didn't he he didn't go back to the Book of Genesis he went to the part that was talking about him he went into the book of Isaiah so in other words he was telling them what his mission was was telling them what he had been sent on Earth for after he read and says this is what I've been sent to do this day this scripture is fulfilled amen amen and verse 19 says he says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord the prophet tells us that he says the acceptable year of the Lord in the old writings is the Year of Jubilee so in other words he was saying I have come to preach the Year of Jubilee Amen to set free all those that were bound bound by sicknesses Bound by blindness he says I have come to break those chains and I have come to give Liberty amen and they saw it when he was walking on the streets of Jerusalem Mary Magdalene magd she would give a testimony and say I was bound by seven demons and Christ came to set her free Hallelujah Legion will say I was bound by a thousand demons but because of Amazing Grace Jesus Christ set me free Hallelujah Lazarus he will say I was bound by the chains of death but when Jesus came he set me free Hallelujah one day he was on the sea with his disciples and the demons started being troubless on the Sea of Galilee and they started causing waves but because he was the high priest that had been sent who was the final one of them all when he spoke peace be still all those demons on the Sea of Galilee had to calm down they had to stop because he was sounding Jubilee if Christ speaks peace be still in your life no demons can trouble you no more Hallelujah because that's his mission he says that's what I've been sent for he wasn't sent for the self-righteous people he wasn't sent for the Pharisees and the Sadducees but he says I was sent to preach Deliverance to the captives I have come to heal the brokenhearted so brother sister if you are bound I got good news for you Christ came to set you free if you have a broken heart he can M your heart amen he has come to set you free he has come to give you Liberty Hallelujah and he was anointed for the job he was saying this is my mission and no one else could take that position from him cuz that's what he had been created for when God creates you for something no one can take that place from you amen am you are unique no one can step in your place Hallelujah remember David David was King in God's mind David was King but when the prophet Samuel came to Jesse's house they were looking for the king and there were seven others more eligible looking people that looked like they could be Kings even the prophet Samuel thought that sha and all of the brothers they could be Kings and he had that horn of oil [Music] he he tried to pour it nothing came out number two came he tried to pour it nothing came out three four five six came he tried to pour nothing came out number seven came tried to pour nothing came out and Samuel is like something is wrong here because God's word never fails then he's like are you sure there's no other one there's like oh yeah there's a little boy who's out there he's taking care of the sheep you see even David's own father didn't even consider him to be able to be a king but God that purpose for him says oh yeah this little boy he's busy shepherding the Sheep then the prophet is like go call him let him come over because the king is definitely not one of these seven when David came and he Nails right there the oil started coming out Hallelujah because that was his purpose it does not matter how many people come before you if it is yours it is yours no one can take away what's yours because it is your predestinated god G your predestinated God given inheritance Hallelujah so your anointing is alone what God Made You for is yours alone no one can come in undo it or try and tell you that no you cannot do it and your anointing your purpose will sustain you if you haven't completed the purpose that God brought you on this Earth for nothing will happen to you because that anointing will protect you it will have a fence around you David was anointed to be king but then he went right back to the Sheep but he knew I'm supposed to be king then one day his father sent him to go give um his brother some food who were in the Army you know the whole story and he saw Goliath who was disrespecting the army of the Living God David looked at him and he looked at himself and he knew he was anointed to be king So no matter what was going to be happen he wasn't going to die until he became a king so even if Goliath swung a sword at him nothing was going to happen to him because God anointed him to become a king Hallelujah that's why he took that stone he put it in that sling sling short he swung it around he swung it around and he just let it go God was responsible to bring that Victory because in God's books David was King so whatever God has to be for you nothing will happen until you become that sickness cannot take you out until you become that death cannot take you out until you become that because God's word stands for sure the Bible says God's word when it is spoken it doesn't come back to him void but it only comes back to him after it has accomplished that which he has sent it for am oh turn around to your neighbor and say I know my purpose say nothing can touch me Hallelujah am amen amen so that was Jesus mission H that was Jesus that was his mission come to redeem you and me no one else could do it there were so many prophets that came but none of them could do it it only take the unblemished Lamb of God Jesus Christ he's the only one who could pay your price he's the only one who could forgive your sin that's why when he was in that Garden of gsan he thought about it he says Lord if this cup could pass over me I would let it but you know what he had you on his mind had me on his mind he says but nevertheless I will go Jesus was man and God but when he went to Calvary he was not God he was only man because he had to carry your sins and my sins God Is So righteous he cannot touch sin so God had to leave him and he had to walk all the way to Calvary as a man carrying the sins of the whole world you know that thing you did last week he was carrying it to the Cross he carried it as a man that's why he said why has Thou forsaken me my God why has Thou forsaken me because God had left him and he went to Calvary as a man so he became our sin so we could become his righteousness Hallelujah he became sick so we could be healed he became poor so we could be rich so you do not have to live under your privileges because Christ already Di done that for you when you were praying you say God I know you already did this 2,000 years ago I'm claiming it it's already there that's all you have to do is claim it and he went on the cross of Calvary as a man carrying all your sins and after that after he his Spirit left and he died they took him down and they put him in a borrowed grave I thought about it for a minute I was like I've never heard of a borrowed grave who has ever heard of someone being uh buried in a borrowed grave they buried him in the grave of Joseph of Ara so what was Joseph of AR going to do when he was going to die because Jesus would have already taken his grave they didn't even know what they were doing but there was a prophetic gesture that borrowing a grave meant he wasn't staying in there it meant he was going to come out Hallelujah he was going to come out Victorious so he was a man who died remember Jesus was both man and God he was the prophet says he was 100% men and 100% God so he was not 50% man and 50% God because that would be unfair to you and me if he was 50% man and 50% God he wouldn't feel exactly what you're going through but he wouldn't have enough power he also wouldn't have enough power as God to overcome it but he was a 100% man and 100% God that's why he says he's the high priest by the feeling of our infirmities so whatever you are going through whatever you were going through he says I know because he's been through it there's no temptation you can go through that Jesus never went through so whenever you are going through whatever you were going through say Lord I know you know if it were you how would you feel being in this position and he is touched by that feeling because he went through it and he able to come deliver you he was man enough he was man enough to go through each and everything you went through but he is God enough to deliver you out of all that you are going through Hallelujah so they laid him in a borrowed grave not knowing what they were doing they were already prophesying that he's not staying there he's coming out Friday night they put him in there and they had lost all hope we thought he was going to Deliver Us from the Roman government but they didn't know while his body was laying in the grave he had another mission before he arose there is one more stop he had to make because remember the key of death Hell In The Grave was held by Satan so he wasn't going to be victorious if he wasn't going to come and overcome him so whil his body was laying in the grave he went down to Hell and the prophet of God talks about it he says he went in and opened that door and the in torment he says 57 0420 57 70420 paragraph 87 he says I can hear him say Satan come here he is boss now he say Satan come here Jesus he is boss now he reaches over and take that key of death and hell off his side and hung it on his own side and Jesus said to say Satan I want to serve notice onto you you've been a bluff long enough I'm a virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross my blood is still wet on the cross and the full debt is paid you have no rights no more you are stripped he says give me those keys that's right and Jesus turns around and gives him a good healthy kick and slams the door together and say you stay in there I am boss from now on and he had overcome death hell and the grave because he had taken those keys from Satan Hallelujah they were all crying Friday Saturday they were crying they didn't know what was going on but they forgotten he had said you can take down this Temple but I'll rebuild it in three days all the that were given in the Old Testament we coming into fruition Hallelujah and Sunday early morning there was no grave that could hold him back they tried to seal his tomb but that wasn't going to hold him back and there was an earthquake That Shook and he came out of that grave he came out Victorious Hallelujah mission accomplished it sounded that Jubilee he has broken all the chains he has set the captives free he did it 2,000 years ago but you can still claim it today the blood of Christ never loses its power is as powerful as it was back then hallelujah you just have to believe it believe the word the prophet of God says believe it the evidence will follow I'll read it right quick it says as soon as you hear the word that God says you can be set free believe it Rejoice with it oh I like this part it says God will show the evidence after you have accepted it But first you accept it that's all you need to do he says Christ died for Sinners I believe it I accept it I start rejoicing Works righteousness by it I believe he was stripped for my healing I believe it I accept it God's work's healing for me soon as I believe it he can't help me till I believe so you have to believe it and confess it and then God know that he has an option not that he has to choose to but the word says God under obligation to his word all you have to do is accept it do you remember Mary Mary was told you're going to conceive as soon as she said amen that's when God started working in her she hadn't seen the baby yet but she ran to Elizabeth said I've had good news I'm carrying the Messiah she hadn't seen it yet but she believed it so you believe First the evidence will follow Hallelujah do you have anything you have you are Believing on this morning believe that you have received it evidence will follow I don't care take evidence of he will follow remember Abraham he believed he was going to have a son he started walking around like he was already a father believed it and the evidence of Isaac it came by that's all you need to do receive it first believe it first and then God will start working Hallelujah you all know the story of John Ryan Ry he went in the prayer line brother B told him you are going to see then he's like oh okay I'm going to see he went back he he doesn't see he's wondering what's going on I've been prayed for other people are being prayed for they are being healed but I'm not being healed what's going on he was confused he's like I've been prayed for I still can't see he went back to brother Bram brother Bram told him just believe it just believe you already see because he had heard it from the prophet because he had heard from a prophet who is a mouthpiece of God he says I'm holding on to this word I'm hanging on to this word like my sight depends on it because he did then he started walking around he he sold newspapers and while he was selling those newspapers he was believing that word says extra extra extra extra I can see extra I can see people are wondering what's this blind man doing we knew him to be blind is he now insane also is he now now crazy also he's going around extra extra I can see he was holding onto that word then one day he went to a Bara shop and then he was seated right there he's giving his testimony how he was prayed for for his eyes to open but his eyes is still blind you need to go around tell your testimony the more you profess it you confess it with your mouth you speaking it into existence just believe it already he's telling that barber you know how people be gathered in the barber shop just talking about nothing he say I can see they're saying you can't see what are you talking about he says extra extra I can see he kept on believing it whilst he had just been had his head cut off halfway only his eyes open because he was believing it and he jumped out of that chair and started running around with that apron around his head saying I can see I can see why because he believed it the evid followed later if God Did It for John Ryan he can do the same thing for you Hallelujah he is not a man that he should lie Glory just believe it the evidence will follow because he's the master strategist he knows what he is doing just believe him on his word amen amen Amen in 52810 a the prophet of God says when the children of Israel was led out of Egypt God promised to take care of them as they Journey Through the Wilderness God said he will take care of them and he did do it no matter where the path LED if any en got in it God in God's path it gave way that's why you need to trust God even if you don't understand it just go do it because God knows what he's doing you don't know what he is doing he says I can see them come up to the Red Sea God had his map draw out the way he was going to take them he knew it so God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt setting them free and he's leading them right into the Red Sea the children of Israel have no idea why is this Moses does not know why is this he is just following the pillar of fire and the cloud by day that's what we need to do in this last days follow the pillar of fire follow the word it will never lead you astray and he says God had his map Dr out and he knew the way he was going to take them they will move right up to the Red Sea there's no way at all to cross it and he was Pharaoh's Army mountains on one side Pharaoh's Army on one side and the red she right in front of them Moses lifted up his hands says God looked down he seen that path laying right on the bottom of the sea there was his children right there needing a promise take word they were taking God at his word but they didn't know that God already had a path laid out under the sea amen paragraph 25 the prophet says God looked down through that Pillar of Fire and with angered eyes when he when the sea he did the sea got scared and moved back like that and he made a dry path and Israel walked through on dry ground take God at his word hallelujah amen God looked at that sea with Angry Eyes and that sea got scared and he had to open away they could walk through I don't care what your problem is I don't care what that trouble is when God looks at it with his Angry Eyes it got to give way so that you go through because that's the way he has provided for you when he looks at your sickness with Angry Eyes that sickness got to go when he looks at your depression Angry Eyes that depression got to go because God knows what he is doing you remember the three Hebrew boys they were being told they were going to go into the fire the prophet talks about this the angel started asking one went to God and say Lord me please let me go I want this assignment shed Mish in the bed Neo had been told they were going into the fire Gabriel said Lord please let me go God says no no no this is not you wormwood the angel called wormwood came the angel called wormwood came the angel that caused the the floods to rain in the days of Noah and you said Lord you know in the days of Noah did a very good assignment let me go and water down that fire God said no this is not you another angel came and said Lord please send me God said no this is my own assignments when it comes to my children who are standing for me it becomes my personal assignment Hallelujah and when they were thrown in the fire there is no heat that got to them they were not even smelling like smoke that's why the people who had thrown them in they were behind them but the people who threw them in who were behind them are the ones who got burned Hallelujah and the chains that were binding them got burnt by the fire but not even one hair on their head got Burns why because God was delivering his own children when it comes to his children God takes personal responsibility amen he says you are my responsibility so in any Affairs that concern you know that God is coming on the scene and when he comes on the sin he's going to deliver you nothing is going to stop in God's way my brother Hallelujah I'll read this last quote left out a lot of things amen the prophet of God well I need to read those this one first the prophet of God says now I'm just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you says maybe if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might have been resented but I'm God's voice to you I say that again that time was under inspiration I felt bad about it the first time it's repeated it I can say nothing in myself but what he shows me you believe it and Watch What Happens Hallelujah so he's telling I am God's voice to you amen he is just saying I'm a microphone to you you see this microphone there two microphones they are on but we can leave them on put them here all night there is no sound that will come out of there you will stay for I don't know how many how long until the batteries run out you will not hear them you will not hear anything amen but once I speak you hear my voice through this microphone The Voice you are hearing hearing right now it's not the voice of the microphone it's my voice when you go back home you're not going to say the microphone was speaking to us today you're going to say brother so and so was the one who was speaking so the prophet is telling you I am this microphone to you if God does not say anything I'm not going to say anything but when I speak I am God's voice to you what God is saying I'm relaying that to you amen and we thank God for the message of the hour that came to open up in our eyes to tell us we've been set free that's not the word of William Bram it's the word of God that comes from Glory that comes to tell you that Christ has sounded the Jubilee when he said it is finished that's when everything was finished I don't care what it is it is finished or tell your neighbor and say it is finished Hallelujah Glory I I'll finish off with this one quot there's a sister who was sing brother Bram a dream he says says brother Bram so this sister was in a dream and she and a few believers were in a cage that had thick bars in it and they couldn't get out of it amen and they were Bound in that they had no way [Music] out and they saw brother Bram walking by and the sister cried brother Bram Deliver Us I'll read it out and she said works is Faith expressed works is Faith expressed 65126 paragraph 30 and she said brother Bram Deliver Us from this this is a house of hell and said you've been misunderstood and you've misunderstood these people brother says and I looked over there and like a great big Cellar or big walls down beneath a great cave and great iron bars eight or 10 inches thick out of their mind Twisted arms and legs beating their head like beating their heads like that and she was crying saying deliver the people brother Bram and she said help us we are in trouble she said uh she herself I know she belongs I believe a Church of Christ paragraph 31 I looked around and I said I wish I could and go on looking around so brother BMA was having pity on these people who were chained in this cage and he looked at himself he like I'm just a little bitty fellow what am I going to do to deliver them he says my little bitty body and them great big iron bars and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron bars were sitting close together and I looked they were beating their head like they were out of their mind and I seen some lights flickering flickering around in [Music] there and I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with a lights of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me and say deliver those people and he went away he was given a commission to deliver the people amen and I thought well how could I deliver them I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars so I say the house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and all the creaking and the popping and the Rocks rocks rolling and bars started falling down and the people started running around screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and was all delivered Hallelujah the message of the hour that came to us is a message of Jubilee it is a message that came to set you and me free there are no bars that can hold us in there's no sickness that can hold us in because we are listening to a voice not a voice of a man but a voice of God hallelujah William Brown by himself he could but he was a man under commission commission sent from from God to give you the word that opens your eyes to let you know you are no longer bound you have been set free brother sister your chains have been broken don't let the devil make you live under your privilege stand up and walk and say I'm free I've been seted free the chains that used to hold me they don't hold me no more who that the son has set free is free indeed if you just calling his name he will hear you he said If my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he says I will hear from Heaven how many believe we don't serve a death and damn God When you pray he hears it Hallelujah and when he hears he will answer glory to God let us stand upon our feet Glory If my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves in prayer he says I will hear not only will he hear but he will hear and he will heal your land whatever you are needing healing for he can do that for you my brother sister let's just bow hands and praise the music please Blessed Assurance just raise your hand if you have a [Music] need if you saying I have heard the Jubilee I've heard
