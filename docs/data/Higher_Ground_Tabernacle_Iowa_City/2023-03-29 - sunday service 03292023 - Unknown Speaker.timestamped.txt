[25:20] because they're already home
[25:23] um
[25:32] say other things
[25:37] we shall read our usual scripture
[25:41] foreign
[25:48] from verse 1 to 6.
[25:52] later Beyond
[25:54] [Music]
[26:05] Elizabeth
[26:12] foreign
[26:20] [Music]
[26:27] [Music]
[26:33] [Music]
[26:43] foreign
[26:52] foreign
[26:56] [Music]
[27:11] [Music]
[27:23] who shall read in English
[27:25] and it came to pass when the Lord was
[27:28] about to take up a Elijah into Heaven by
[27:32] a week
[27:34] that Elijah went with Elisha from from
[27:38] gilgad then Elisha said to Elisha
[27:42] stay here please for the Lord has sent
[27:45] me on the battle but Elisha said as the
[27:49] Lord leaves and as your soul leaves I
[27:52] will not leave you so they went down to
[27:55] Bethel now the sons of the of the
[27:58] Prophet who were at Bethel came out
[28:02] came out to Elisha and said to him do
[28:05] you know that the Lord will take away
[28:07] your master from over there from over
[28:10] you today and he said yes I know keep
[28:13] silent
[28:14] then Elijah said to him Elijah stay here
[28:18] please for the Lord has sent me on to
[28:21] Jericho but he said as the Lord as the
[28:24] Lord leaves and as your souls lives I
[28:28] will not leave you so they came to
[28:30] Jericho
[28:31] now the sons of the Prophet who were a
[28:34] Jericho came to Elisha and said to him
[28:36] do you know that the Lord will take away
[28:39] your master from from over you today so
[28:43] he answered yes I know keep silent then
[28:46] Elijah said to him stay here please for
[28:50] the Lord and send me on today to unto
[28:53] Jordan
[28:54] but he said as the Lord leaves and as
[28:58] your soul lives I will not leave you so
[29:01] two of them went on
[29:03] yeah
[29:06] may the Lord bless the reading of the
[29:08] world
[29:09] we may be seated
[29:19] um first of all I wanna show the change
[29:22] that yeah
[29:25] the subject that we uh we uh
[29:29] [Music]
[29:31] of a larger and Elisha uh
[29:35] cenepa
[29:37] in La Porte
[29:42] We Don't Preach this to show up like uh
[29:47] somebody who knows things
[29:54] we're preaching this subject because we
[29:57] know that the spirit of the Lord has led
[29:59] us into this benediction
[30:05] and from this it may take up to another
[30:08] level of blessings for the church
[30:15] and I would like to let the church know
[30:18] that
[30:23] during this time that we are preaching
[30:27] this kind of preachings
[30:32] if you have something against your
[30:35] brother or sister
[30:39] this is the time to make things right so
[30:42] later the Met really shows are clear
[30:44] this is the time to make to clear things
[30:53] because we can come to church no you
[30:56] know we've got a problem against
[30:57] somebody
[31:02] you just come to listen to the world and
[31:05] go back home like it used to be okay
[31:11] like coming to church became in orbit
[31:26] if you do have a problem against your
[31:29] your brother or your sister I don't know
[31:31] why I'm saying this message
[31:41] but if you feel like the spirit of the
[31:44] Lord is leading you to understand that
[31:45] you've got something against your
[31:47] brother sister
[31:50] after the service you may go out and see
[31:53] your brothers
[31:55] or maybe when you be home
[31:58] try to make things come actually shows
[32:01] try to make things right
[32:05] so that we may see the power of God in
[32:07] this house
[32:16] hello
[32:21] so this morning I want to speak upon the
[32:24] calling of a bride say empathy

[32:35] sub-subject in our big title in larger
[32:38] in English
[32:51] in line with what we have like oh
[32:54] matters
[32:56] methanol
[32:58] um
[33:01] so we've said with you right here
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] we've seen that Elijah and Elisha has
[33:12] been the type of the church
[33:15] but I think everyone is feeling good
[33:19] I don't make you sleep right
[33:23] position because I feel like people are
[33:25] taking a position of sleeping
[33:29] [Music]
[33:31] it's like getting ready to sleep okay
[33:37] so if you don't sleep let me see that
[33:40] you don't sleep because
[33:44] if you start sleeping I'll be sleeping
[33:46] too
[33:49] spectacular then you go back home and
[33:52] say what spectacles in today foreign
[35:10] a larger and a large have taken it's
[35:13] same it's the same the one or Christ at
[35:17] the church of tech
[35:19] is
[35:23] left to giggle with Elisha is
[35:36] the prophet is
[35:46] then they say unto him do you know that
[35:48] they must want to take you oh I mean the
[35:50] Lord gonna take your mass over you today
[35:54] yes I know it's so keep silence
[35:59] then they continue their welcome to
[36:02] Jericho dance
[36:04] when they got to Jericho
[36:08] Elijah said
[36:10] the priest stay here please
[36:17] he said as long as your your souls lives
[36:20] and the Lord leaves I will never leave
[36:22] you asked
[36:25] because the Lord was sending Elijah
[36:27] Elijah
[36:30] and Elijah followed Elijah up to up to
[36:34] Jordan
[36:36] when they got to Jordan
[36:42] thought Elisha was going to stay there
[36:45] is
[36:57] that was justification
[37:00] and from Bethel to Jerry
[37:03] sanctification
[37:09] so from
[37:26] together from justification up until the
[37:30] baptism
[37:33] is
[37:46] so these are the three ages of the work
[37:49] of the Great and the church and the Lord
[37:51] have worked with the church
[37:55] the church has died after the Pentacles
[38:01] that it went through sorrows and
[38:03] sufferings
[38:06] and it went through all this pains
[38:36] [Music]
[39:09] that was just foreign
[40:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:01] of the Holy Ghost
[41:04] s okay
[41:11] foreign
[42:20] 63 he said this is
[42:27] which is the place of Christian
[42:30] confession in Baptist

[42:37] us yeah I felt that confession
[42:40] you've done your confession and you've
[42:42] been baptized so it's enough she said
[42:48] now is Elijah who's telling Elijah I'm
[42:51] going to better thank you foreign
[43:46] it wasn't enough foreign
[44:09] there are people who are once people are
[44:13] just confessing about something
[44:14] [Applause]
[44:18] and people just Rejoice of confessing
[44:21] something only Angie's home by saying
[44:25] I'll just join the church
[44:33] this mic is kind of breaking sometimes
[44:36] and the voice is not clear
[44:38] but honors
[44:40] they've already told us that all this
[44:42] stuff are old and it's no more clear um
[44:47] and we need a new instrument
[44:52] s
[44:57] so if my voice is gone and I don't know
[45:00] how to preach then you're gonna just
[45:01] Rejoice with that
[45:03] the party
[45:05] my voice is going
[45:08] listen to this the prophet said
[45:12] my professional applications most people
[45:15] that are confessing says
[45:20] they just satisfied with her by saying
[45:27] why not to stay here
[45:40] he fell so far apart
[45:50] that's why he said
[45:54] before and your souls lives
[46:07] into the house of God
[46:11] and he found some people
[46:13] foreign
[47:29] the grace never foreign
[48:31] is a Pentecostal
[48:35] meaning
[48:36] started in 1906.
[48:42] that's the restoration
[48:55] he came in until all night and look at
[48:58] life
[49:00] started in 1906. Jamaican Consultants so
[49:05] I want all of us to be together in peace
[49:09] so when the Pentecostal age started
[49:14] and when they've done 50 years
[49:18] started in 1906 as I told you

[49:32] to go along with Pentecostals
[49:45] he has to work with them together
[50:03] Coastal people
[50:06] that's why
[50:09] when we get to the age like 1905
[50:14] 19.
[50:17] if you count it's 50 years
[50:23] Pentecostal age
[50:25] get to the end in that time
[50:29] and Brahm start preaching they should be
[50:32] late that's you sir
[50:36] they're returning and the children

[50:43] he preached the five Junction of time
[50:49] because of the age of Pentecostals
[50:56] 50 years was the end of Pentecostal age
[51:05] with a message
[51:10] from Pentecostal church
[51:17] I'm not just making some math
[51:27] all Pentecostal people rejected
[51:34] because we're going uh toward 1962.
[51:44] the the
[51:46] the stage

[51:50] Ministry
[51:54] he said everybody is forsaken me foreign
[52:09] [Music]
[52:12] foreign
[53:12] instead approaching the adoption
[53:16] shows that they know for something new
[53:20] sentence that comes after the baptism of
[53:22] the Holy Ghost
[53:25] and when we left we left
[53:34] and brothers
[53:37] which is the identification
[54:09] is to bring us into New Dimensions
[54:28] amen
[54:31] and the blood of Christ
[54:35] why the church still remember
[54:40] the pride is not in Legacy

[1:08:00] first of all Brothers
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:08] he had a mission to pull out the bride
[1:08:11] from the church
[1:08:14] because there's a church and the bride
[1:08:17] Elementary
[1:08:25] and foreign
[1:08:59] and start talking to the bride
[1:09:02] decrease
[1:09:11] say the invisible Union
[1:09:15] so the brothers
[1:09:22] husband is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:26] so William brothers
[1:09:31] because God wanted to use his body to do
[1:09:35] that kind of job
[1:09:39] foreign
[1:10:39] the book go through the messages
[1:10:42] the messenger swallow the books
[1:10:49] is the title this is
[1:11:52] May our own life become the message
[1:11:56] Capstone
[1:12:13] or the Capstone States
[1:12:21] so what was the job of that Capstone
[1:12:24] when it comes down
[1:12:27] was it just to be taking a picture
[1:12:32] and to leave us like often people no
[1:12:35] lessons
[1:12:43] and we say that we believe in the coming
[1:12:45] of the Capstone no no it's not like that
[1:12:47] Japanese
[1:12:52] if it was a Capstone
[1:12:56] it says to be
[1:12:58] it's just to descendants
[1:13:19] in like Elijah and Elisha
[1:13:23] Elisha never stops
[1:13:28] he never stationed himself he went
[1:13:32] across the journey
[1:13:35] where the Angels were they came down
[1:13:49] each one of us to be acting that
[1:13:53] foreign
[1:14:36] to deceive the people in the end time
[1:14:39] and the most stood up there he said
[1:14:49] you know what me I'm gonna go there help
[1:14:52] them to build the Great churches
[1:14:56] when they're going to believe in their
[1:14:58] great churches then they'll be deceived
[1:15:01] whatever you are a small boy stay there
[1:15:04] just sit aside
[1:15:06] time
[1:16:11] why they are not saved
[1:16:14] no Los Angeles
[1:16:23] because you don't drink beer no listen
[1:16:25] at the bathroom
[1:16:28] the Holy Ghost never came to stop us
[1:16:31] from smoking
[1:16:32] especially in the time that we live in
[1:16:48] and that's not the fact that they accept
[1:16:50] no no
[1:16:53] yes
[1:16:58] from their houses
[1:17:04] they don't do adulteries
[1:17:07] and it doesn't mean they're safe
[1:17:11] so start from believing I understand
[1:17:13] this question because you don't drink or
[1:17:17] you don't smoke so the person
[1:17:19] that's not the evidence of a Holy Ghost
[1:17:26] yourself upon that
[1:17:32] issue but with the Holy Ghost in This
[1:17:34] last days
[1:17:37] or a union of measure
[1:17:42] in every science there's always a Unity
[1:17:45] of measure kilometers
[1:17:47] yes
[1:17:59] before you get to identification
[1:18:06] if you receive the Holy Ghost she
[1:18:09] believed
[1:18:18] same question
[1:18:23] when we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:18:25] and you're getting angry
[1:18:29] of preaching is
[1:18:32] away from the Holy Ghost
[1:18:34] no you're not far from Hollywood
[1:18:37] you're not far from Holy Ghost
[1:18:41] the unity of measure
[1:18:45] Country Missouri
[1:19:00] nobody can talk wrong about you
[1:19:14] but you're doing the will of your master
[1:19:20] that's where God want to bring the
[1:19:22] church let's set this
[1:19:25] seven Series has been opened
[1:19:28] yes I believe with you
[1:19:32] but they will not just open in the books
[1:19:36] seven sins has to be opening in our
[1:19:39] lives
[1:19:48] we have received more than Elisha
[1:19:53] that's the point my brother's sister
[1:19:56] so things has to be said in this way
[1:19:58] someone let the power comes out if you
[1:20:00] don't say
[1:20:01] you're dead which means we are the
[1:20:03] seduces
[1:20:09] Paul avidi and Paul said
[1:20:14] because the people of that time
[1:20:19] couldn't get to the profession to
[1:20:21] profession without us
[1:20:24] we are the ones that are bringing
[1:20:26] Perfection
[1:20:34] those who suffer don't leave
[1:20:38] those that have opened their homes
[1:20:42] even if the sunrise
[1:20:52] without us
[1:21:05] of Christ
[1:21:12] we know in half
[1:21:14] man lost
[1:21:17] but when the prophet shall come no
[1:21:19] connection
[1:21:21] we will know much more
[1:21:24] the perfectness foreign
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:45] that's why
[1:21:50] and if the thing is
[1:21:56] a blood of Christ
[1:22:01] is to repeat
[1:22:05] that the church
[1:22:10] manifested through us
[1:22:30] I could preach about the coming or the
[1:22:33] descending of the storm but I feel the
[1:22:35] spirit stopping me from Allah
