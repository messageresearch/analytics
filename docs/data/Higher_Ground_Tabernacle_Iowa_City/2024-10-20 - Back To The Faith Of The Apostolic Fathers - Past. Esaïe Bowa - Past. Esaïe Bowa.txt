shall read the book of Ephesians 4 and then we jump to 11et behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great that day great and terrible he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a a curse read in Ephesian there's only one Lord One Faith one baptism verse 11 and he has given some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some as shephers and teachers for what reason for the per perfecting of the Saints with the view of the work of the ministry with the view of the edifying of the body of Christ until when until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God at the full ground man at the measure of the sture of the fullness of the Christ you may be seated may the Lord bless the read the reading of the word as you're sitting I want to add Titus verse first verse verse verse first verse in the book of Titus uh up to four first chapter the first chapter 1 to 4 okay Paul servant of God an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect uh please pray attention we read about faith faith and Faith it says Apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's and the knowledge of the truth which is according to in the hope of eternal life which God who cannot lie promis before the of but he has manifested his own due season his word in the proclamation with which I have been entrusted according to the Commandment of our savior God to my own child according to the faith common to us it's talking about the common Faith the faith that was of Paul and Titus Paul says Grace and peace from God the father in Christ Jesus our savior I want to go to the book of uh Jude chapter one first chapter uh verse three and verse three the third verse Bel using all diligence to write to you of our common salvation exting you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the Saint with the scriptures we just read we speak about the coming back of theost apostolic fathers last Sunday we spoke about the identity card of a Believer and today we're going to uh keep talking to talk about the uh the way back to the faith of in this great subject we're going to speak about fighting uh fighting for for the faith that was that was transmitted once and for all the sins as you notice with me where we spoke about faith in the scriptures we just read Paul speaking about common faith it says once for all there's no two or three he only speaking about one time it says there's one Lord one time and one baptism I want us to understand this morning that according to the there is no many Faith there's only one Faith this faith that Paul ising that he wrote to the Ephesians to tell them to remind them that there's only one Lord one faith and one baptism and that only faith that Paul is speaking about it says in verse 13 it says until we we we reach to the unity of faith God made some Apostles some prophets some shepher some uh doctors [Applause] for the perfectioning of the works of the ministry and to the edifying of the body of Christ and all the until we arrive to the unity of the faith so the same Fai he mentioned and mentioning to it says that God made some are she are dark Prophet others are evangelists for all of us to bring the entire church to fath and remember I told you that Paul says there's only one faith the faith Paul is talking about it's not comparable to doctr or a way of understanding some scriptures that's not what Paul is talking about but Paul is talking about a common Faith that's one Faith that's where we can fight if we can fight it's not about something different it's not for these things of the world it's not about doctr the understanding of the scriptures but if we have to Le a fight if we have to hold a fight it's for it's for the the faith that was delivered once for all all the and it's about that faith that Paul told Titus Titus my son he said in our common Faith May the grace and peace God be given unto you AB from our God from Jesus Christ Our Savior yes my brothers and sisters so this faith is very important and that's why we found that many of us don't use that Faith many has forgotten to talk about that fa talking about that faith that was delivered once for all the sins and that's why there's all kind different fight we have uh uh useless fight why because because preachers they didn't insist of the only Faith the common faith that faith that doesn't have to be disputed because the common fath that faith that Paul ising when he makes them actions cannot be undis because when faith is on made action action you cannot argue with them and many preachers many believers they have forsaken the common Faith just to establish themselves in the things that useless to develop doctrines that's not even important and we fighting we arguing about and we stting arguing this is not my faith I don't believe such you believe such don't believe in this way it's not about that faith that we talking about but the common faith that faith that was that once belong to that that faith that belongs to Peter it was the same faith that belongs to Titus and it's about the same F that Paul spoke to the Ephesian and many has forgotten it now hear this as I say we talking about the coming back to the fa to the Faith of Our apostol the prophet says in the message to the the message of faith of the Apostles in paragraph 12 preached in 1951 it says tonight in this city of Phoenix this land where the sun shines you have people around all this Earth to witness the light and was praying he says oh shine upon us Lord shine upon us tonight send the Holy [Music] [Applause] Ghost and made a holy spirit put something in each person's heart the true Faith Apostolic Faith and what is that Apostolic Faith it says those who are ready to seal their testimony with the blood and to believe the true word the true story of Jesus Christ that's the apostolic it means believing being ready to seal your testimony with blood and believing in a true story of the Lord Jesus that's the apostol we going to talk about it more he says the the word spoken from the Angels he say here I'm I'm telling you a good news says today in your heart is born Lord Christ the the Savior by the Holy Spirit and now says but we are so grateful for because you have made a way and you said I will be with you and even in You Until the End of the Age says and that we feeling and we know that you were here tonight [Applause] and our works when we come here is to worship you is to follow your word he says by faith we believe in it works works uh Praises uh uh testimony seven times we my friends sir yes brothers and sister as you can hear what the prophet says say that Apostolic Faith is being ready to seal your testimony with blood and to believe the true story of Jesus Christ that's the true Apostolic Faith and I want to read here says in the message demonology paragraph 21st he says I still have two meeting to hold host one in Florida and today I've just heard that we're going to [Music] Africa it says there are meeting that's being organized and then when I'll get there and come back here [Music] I think you're going to see a different Ser service because you know brothers and sisters each time We Gather here in the church each meeting we have to have has to be a different service if it's not a different meeting it means God has ceased to be God cuz it's true that God is he reveals himself to his people differ than he has done it before and the prophet say he says you see and I think that the thing is I want to take a group of preachers and GA them the thing is about if you have to understand that the preachers are evolving with the spirit of God he says then you have got something you see they shall bring it to the church and the church will bring it here and there and from here from there and somewhere El maybe you didn't understand let me explain this to you brother say says when I will come back here from I will take a group of preachers and I will gather them and he say he says the thing it is if you can get that the preacher are evolving with the spirit of God if you can make to make preachers involve with the spirit of God that that that then you have got something then something is going to Evol something is going to evolve if the preacher can evolve in the spirit of God then something will move forward you see see when something else and from there to another place not a new organization but a Revival of what we have going back to the kingdom of God coming back to the apostolic faith if we have we get to the level of gathering the preachers and if they can evolve with the spirit of God certainly something will move forward and that's what we seek if we are preachers we have to gather ourselves and when we Gathering it's for us to bring Revival that's the purpose and the mission of the preachers bringing forth rival and when he brings the Revival the member of the church that we bring that same Revival that we bring it outside that we bring it somewhere until that M Revival we go all around he says it's a Revival that we have coming back to the kingdom coming back to the apostolic faith he says may Lord bless you my friend I know I I believe that we about to do something and now my brothers and S since we speaking about the coming back of the spirit of the fathers the faith of the Fathers as I told that faith of the father is not a doctrine of the church these are do that has nothing to do with our Salvation brother Bram says that not not even one do will get to heaven the only anything that we get to heaven it's perfect love and perfect love is the Holy Ghost you cannot talk about if you don't have the Holy Ghost because it's the Holy Ghost In which Malachi 4 has come to bring us back to that's why he said he says be behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before that great day of the Lord I'm trying to go slower for my interpret I feel like I'm ring him now hear this the faith of the father that we talking about here it's not a Doctrine from a church we mention and I told you that the other day it's not a doctrinal church I just left those argument useless argument from doctr I can believe what I believe it doesn't concern the church I cannot force somebody else to believe what I believe the faith that I'm talking about this morning I I aming to I'm obligating you to have that faith because it's not my it's not my faith but it was the faith that was not many times but one time only to the Saints and Jude say let's fight for it if we have to have a fight or a brother and a brother fighting each other let it be for the faith if there's a fight battle let it be a legi battles for about faith I'm saying what is Faith say did you receive faith that was delivered to the sense once for all that's that's what we mean when if we have to have a b that's why personally I left those useless and fighting with people uselessly I got out of those you you look for me in your fights you will never find me it's a legitim battle for the faith that was delivered once for all for the that's where I fight that's where my fa that's where my my my my true battle is so I'll fight no you see why doesn't he preach us why doesn't he preach the Catholic Church they would say we certainly are the mother church because of their faith and they would say that our church is the church that has the faith that was delivering to the and he say if I go to a Baptist Church the church in which I was ordained that will say the fundamentalist doct we are the one who got the the apostolic faith and if I can go to the Methodist Church the Church of my mother and they would say chur we the one who got the the the faith that was uh delivered to the same and if I keep going to different churches each one of them say that it was about a church all those churches they are defending their Doctrine and they comparing their Doctrine to the faith in the church called message people fighting battles to defend their doctr and say that that's Faith while it's not even faith those are do that can that's useless shall never send you to heav that's what the prophet said he says I'll prefer having a bad wrong but having God's love and go to heaven then having a true Doctrine and being lost and go to hell why Doctrine is important for say now sorry oh Jude told us to fight for the faith to fight for the faith it says not one Faith but a faith because he was delivered to the Saints once for all it says there's something reasonable to do it there's only one way of of doing it is to go back to the past and see what kind of Faith they have our Apostolic fathers what kind of Faith do they have and when we would find out what kind of Faith they had then we will fight for it now John now as as a Baptist I will live mine my faith he says me as a Baptist he says I will leave my faith and whoever you are you also jop off your faith that's why this morning it says I'm I say I'm jumpping off what I'm call my because BR also Dro off his he says as a bti dropping off my Fai I'm leaving my faith you drop off your faith that the Lord has already came I fight with you until I die it's a battle that you already lost oh I understand that the Lord has hasn't come yet until I'm telling you that it's a battle that you already lost say he says as a bti I drop I'm dropping my Fai you also drop your faith because it's not going to help you and it shall never help you I'm feeling like somebody's refusing this and says no I'm refusing what you're saying refuse you you're free to refuse but it's what brother say as a he has dropped his as a bapti why would I stay with my faith let's leave those battles let's fight Faith you see I want to hurry I can finish in a 20 minutes of I don't want to be long because they have that Faith the apostolic we saw the Miracles that went along with could say Paul standing at the door called with Angel and there was they were have nothing from the only thing they had was faith that faith that was delivered to the that's why they told him what we got to in Jesus Christ and we telling you get up and walk and the handicap man worked that was the faith of the apost the Faith of Our Apostolic but today the church has lost the church has lost that power and they are happy to say that we have the word you see we have the word but the word without power it's just a spirit of lust I don't want that word without now let's ask our the Bible says God himself say I will send you Elijah the prophet before that day AR he shall bring back to the fathers but today we claiming that we have received Elijah by our heart has G back to to the apostolic father why why did our heart didn't go back why are we still in sin but we claim we encouraging us see we have belied in the message I have beli in the message I'm in the message since 20 years ago I mean a message 30 years no matter how long
