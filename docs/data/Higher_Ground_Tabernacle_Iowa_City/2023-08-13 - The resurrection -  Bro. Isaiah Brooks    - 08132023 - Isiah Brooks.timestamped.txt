[1:02:41] pond with our house which is from heaven
[1:02:45] is
[1:02:57] foreign
[1:03:39] earnestly
[1:03:41] upon with our house
[1:03:44] tears from heaven
[1:04:34] the unfold but clothed upon
[1:04:38] that mortality might be up of life
[1:04:42] the universities
[1:05:04] also have given unto us
[1:05:08] our history
[1:05:10] is
[1:05:17] therefore we are always confident
[1:05:21] knowing that while we are at home in the
[1:05:24] body
[1:05:25] we are absent from
[1:05:27] us
[1:05:34] by faith not by side
[1:05:58] foreign
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:29] foreign
[1:07:02] yes thank you
[1:07:05] we thank you for your mercy
[1:07:08] we thank you for being so good to us
[1:07:21] you may be seated
[1:07:27] by the grace of God
[1:07:29] I like to speak uh
[1:07:31] mainly on the resurrection Resurrection
[1:07:37] Hallelujah
[1:07:38] and if I was to have a sub-topic I would
[1:07:42] it would be changing from glory to glory
[1:07:51] I'm not sure that most people really
[1:07:54] understand this age that we're living in
[1:08:00] but to me this is the greatest of all
[1:08:03] ages
[1:08:06] since time began
[1:08:10] and just to think
[1:08:13] chose
[1:08:15] Hallelujah
[1:08:17] to use
[1:08:19] to put the devil under his feet
[1:08:23] when I think about
[1:08:26] the approaching time
[1:08:29] and the approaching event
[1:08:33] that we're getting ready to pop be
[1:08:35] partakers of
[1:08:38] I realize
[1:08:45] but there are two resurrections
[1:08:48] there's a resurrection for the good
[1:08:51] and there's a resurrection for the evil
[1:08:56] but I trust that you and I will be part
[1:09:00] of the first resurrection
[1:09:03] hallelujah amen now we know according to
[1:09:07] Paul
[1:09:08] that this body that we're now living in
[1:09:12] it's not the final
[1:09:14] body of of who we are
[1:09:18] we realize by the grace of God
[1:09:23] that we have what we call a theophany
[1:09:28] it is a word body
[1:09:31] hallelujah amen so when Paul was
[1:09:34] speaking about this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:09:37] being dissolved
[1:09:39] he was talking about how death strikes
[1:09:42] this body
[1:09:45] all of us know
[1:09:47] the longer you live
[1:09:50] the worst this body becomes
[1:09:53] that's the scripture says the grass with
[1:09:57] us
[1:09:58] the grass withers
[1:10:02] and the flowers fade away
[1:10:06] Hallelujah but the word of the Lord
[1:10:09] shall stand
[1:10:10] so we're living in a time
[1:10:13] where God is going to take these bodies
[1:10:17] change them
[1:10:19] Hallelujah into a position where we can
[1:10:23] take on positions not the off anybody
[1:10:27] and then the body will take on the
[1:10:31] glorified body
[1:10:33] but mind you
[1:10:35] this is not for everybody
[1:10:38] this is for our chosen people
[1:10:41] this is for a chosen generation
[1:10:45] Hallelujah there's only a special class
[1:10:48] of people
[1:10:50] take the Rapture
[1:10:52] Hallelujah we can call it the
[1:10:54] translation
[1:10:56] the thing that excites me because I
[1:11:00] realize we're living in the last days
[1:11:06] if you understand if a company that we
[1:11:09] have already embraced
[1:11:11] what we call world war three
[1:11:15] it has not yet escalated
[1:11:18] but we can see it moving in that
[1:11:21] direction
[1:11:23] Hallelujah and if that be true
[1:11:27] how much time do we have
[1:12:04] who is going to be surprised
[1:12:07] because the Rapture would have taken
[1:12:10] place
[1:12:11] and they would be left behind us
[1:12:16] who call themselves Christians I'm
[1:12:20] talking about people who claim to follow
[1:12:23] this message
[1:12:26] will be left behind
[1:12:29] why Wow because they fail
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:18] now you and I must come to know
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] why because brother Brandon has gone off
[1:13:27] the scene
[1:13:28] then if that be the case
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:46] the scripture is from here
[1:13:49] brother
[1:13:51] tied that particular scripture
[1:13:54] where Jesus read in Isaiah
[1:14:03] when he said just
[1:14:10] he stops because he realized the day of
[1:14:14] Vengeance was yet to come
[1:14:20] there and read that scripture he did not
[1:14:24] only say this is the acceptable year of
[1:14:27] the Lord
[1:14:32] You may call this global warming
[1:14:40] in
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:53] um
[1:15:22] it said
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:46] talking about you
[1:15:48] and me
[1:15:50] we are we are Kingdom
[1:15:53] s
[1:15:53] hallelujah amen is that right
[1:15:57] understand
[1:15:58] it's later than we think Hallelujah
[1:16:03] through the scripture
[1:16:06] brother
[1:16:09] type the bride
[1:16:12] and Enoch was translated
[1:16:16] he pleased God he had a testimony he
[1:16:21] walked with God and if you read the
[1:16:24] scripture
[1:16:25] and you look
[1:16:28] look
[1:16:29] with God
[1:16:31] there's something missing in the
[1:16:33] equation
[1:16:36] but the missing part is
[1:16:38] the part that God began to

[2:06:07] back door by the back by the back door
[2:06:11] you would muster up some strength
[2:06:15] they'll be pushing and shoving and
[2:06:17] knocking and keep everything
[2:06:20] just to get to that million dollars
[2:06:24] what God is offering more than that
[2:06:28] he's offering eternal life
[2:06:32] and he ain't asking you to
[2:06:35] you
[2:06:37] believe on me
[2:06:42] your body will flow rivers of Living
[2:06:45] Waters
[2:06:51] okay
[2:06:53] so you see what I'm saying wait the
[2:06:55] question but we'll pass that by

[2:07:06] in January I'll be 68.00
[2:07:13] foreign
[2:07:48] whether we like it or not I don't care

[2:08:10] going to remain here forever
[2:08:13] something gonna take you out you gonna
[2:08:17] die one way or another
[2:08:20] hallelujah amen but if this Earthly
[2:08:24] Tabernacles
[2:08:27] body must die I don't want to die with
[2:08:31] my body
[2:08:34] there's something that tells me
[2:08:37] is life after death
[2:08:46] who doesn't want to live
[2:08:51] I don't care how bad this world is
[2:08:54] that people still don't want to die
[2:08:58] think about it and there's a word
[2:09:01] there's no
[2:09:03] business
[2:09:10] no earthquakes
[2:09:12] [Music]
[2:09:14] and God says all you gotta do
[2:09:17] believe in me and trust me
[2:09:23] I came to give the world alive
[2:09:32] you say about brother Brooks
[2:09:34] I make a lot of mistakes
[2:09:38] you probably will do until Jesus comes
[2:09:42] he became
[2:09:46] that's why he went to Calvary
[2:09:48] he even with the health
[2:09:52] he went to hell for you that means you
[2:09:55] don't have to go to hell
[2:09:58] for you
[2:10:03] he did all of that for you
[2:10:06] he got whipped he he got beaten for you
[2:10:10] with his stripes we're healed
[2:10:14] every time he was beaten is because of
[2:10:19] your sins because of your transgressions
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:26] me and my brothers were you know we were
[2:10:29] okay
[2:10:30] real close but that would have been a
[2:10:32] lie but but we were okay
[2:10:35] but when it came for me to get a
[2:10:38] whipping
[2:10:40] I can't
[2:10:44] okay
[2:10:53] no no no no they didn't do that you know
[2:10:55] you know they went on the outside of the
[2:10:58] door
[2:10:59] and they're laughing every time
[2:11:05] you wait but that ain't how Jesus Works
[2:11:09] he literally went to hell she suffered
[2:11:12] everything he suffered
[2:11:16] so I'm gonna tell you how the Judgment
[2:11:19] would be hello
[2:11:29] then you become one that says crucified
[2:11:34] on the side that says crucifying
[2:11:39] it's like you spending me
[2:12:02] and somebody say this and closings
[2:12:06] close to God as you possibly can
[2:12:09] remember
[2:12:40] we have you
[2:12:42] troubled me
[2:12:44] seeing that you have become the enemy of
[2:12:48] God
