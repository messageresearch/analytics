[30:07] You may know it. I think I've sung it
[30:09] here before.
[30:14] [Music]
[30:20] thought I
[30:22] wouldn't be
[30:25] here
[30:26] [Music]
[30:28] today if it wasn't for the mercy of the
[30:34] good
[30:36] Lord. I wouldn't be
[30:40] here
[30:44] today if he had not died. on
[30:52] Calary. If he had not
[30:56] heard my
[30:59] feable
[31:01] plea, if he had not
[31:05] come to see about
[31:11] me, I wouldn't be
[31:16] here today.
[31:19] No, I wouldn't be
[31:24] here today.
[31:28] Oh, if it wasn't for the mercy of the
[31:34] good
[31:36] Lord, I wouldn't be
[31:40] here
[31:41] [Music]
[31:44] today. If it wasn't for the mercy of the
[31:49] good
[31:51] Lord, I wouldn't be here today.
[31:57] [Applause]
[32:00] If he had not died on
[32:05] [Music]
[32:07] Calary, if he had not heard my
[32:13] people
[32:14] plea, if he had not come to see about
[32:24] me, I wouldn't be
[32:27] here
[32:30] today. No, I wouldn't be here
[32:37] today. I'm going to say one more time.
[32:39] If it wasn't for the mercies of the good
[32:46] Lord, I wouldn't be here today.
[32:54] If it wasn't for the mercies of the good
[33:01] Lord, I wouldn't be here
[33:08] today. If he had not died on Calary.
[33:15] [Music]
[33:17] If he had not heard my
[33:22] feeble plea, if he had not come to see
[33:29] about
[33:32] me, I wouldn't be
[33:36] here
[33:38] today. No, I wouldn't be
[33:43] here today.
[33:48] Amen. Amen. Glory. Amen. Amen.
[33:54] Think about that song. Real simple.
[34:01] Amen. We could just stand and read the
[34:03] word.
[34:07] We're going to be
[34:09] coming from Matthew 21
[34:14] beginning at the 10th verse.
[34:19] Glad to
[34:22] see brother John who ministered for us
[34:25] last week.
[34:30] We appreciate everything that was done
[34:33] and said and done then.
[34:39] for those who who did not make it.
[34:44] We really had a wonderful time
[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] and I know that sometimes that put a
[34:52] strain on some of you
[34:58] but even your prayers were
[35:02] felt we appreciate that in the name of
[35:04] the Lord.
[35:07] Matthew 21 beginning at the 10th verse.
[35:14] And when he was come into
[35:16] Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
[35:19] saying, "Who is
[35:32] this? multitude said, "This is Jesus the
[35:36] prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."
[35:39] [Music]
[35:45] And Jesus went into the temple of God,
[35:48] and cast out all them that sold and
[35:50] bought in the temple, and overthrew them
[35:54] that the tables of the money changers,
[35:57] and the seats of them that sold doves.
[36:15] And he said unto them, "It is written,
[36:17] my house shall be called the house of
[36:19] prayer, but ye have made it a den of
[36:22] thieves.
[36:36] In the 14th verse,
[36:38] and the blind and the lame came to him
[36:41] in the temple and he healed them.
[36:51] Let us pray. Our gracious father, we
[36:55] thank you, Father, for your grace and
[36:57] your mercy. We thank you for being so
[37:00] good to us. Lord, I pray this morning
[37:04] that you would bless us, bless the
[37:06] people. We can't preach this morning
[37:09] without your
[37:11] anointing. We need that shakina
[37:13] glory. Now, not only to to anoint
[37:17] me, hear us here this morning. Bless
[37:21] this service. in a special way in Jesus
[37:25] Christ's name we pray.
[37:27] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[37:32] We thank the Lord for his grace to give
[37:35] us this time this morning.
[37:40] I I think somebody uh may have they may
[37:42] have had a different schedule.
[37:46] Uh the ministers may have had a
[37:48] different schedule uh and I may have
[37:51] interrupted it
[37:53] the schedule but I I believe it was the
[37:56] will of the Lord for me to be here
[38:02] in this particular
[38:04] scripture. A lot is being said, but I'm
[38:06] just going to
[38:10] go where in different
[38:12] places to start the message off.
[38:16] My message on this
[38:19] morning is called the ultimate, the
[38:23] absolute and the unlimited.
[38:35] Amen. Amen. So, we appreciate the Lord
[38:39] and like I said, I think the last time I
[38:41] was here,
[38:44] we must focus
[38:50] ourselves on the uh growth of Christ in
[38:54] us.
[38:57] We are approaching uh the translation
[39:03] or the or the rapture, however you want
[39:05] to say it.
[39:06] [Music]
[39:07] But we must understand that we are not
[39:11] from this
[39:13] world. According to brother
[39:15] Brandham, we are coming from
[39:19] heaven to
[39:21] earth, from
[39:23] earth, back to heaven.
[39:26] Then we come back to
[39:28] earth. So we are coming from another
[39:31] [Music]
[39:32] land. We didn't know that. We literally
[39:36] thought we were all just like everybody
[39:39] else.
[39:41] But there was something on the inside of
[39:43] the
[39:45] inside that would give us rest.
[39:49] It wouldn't give us the
[39:51] peace that we we we
[39:54] wanted. But when we heard this
[39:58] message, something
[40:01] changed. It gave us a new
[40:03] vision, it gave us new hope. Hallelujah.
[40:08] But most of us, most of all, it gave us
[40:11] faith. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. This
[40:15] message comes to give us
[40:19] identity. It comes to give us a
[40:22] revelation of who we really
[40:25] are. Hallelujah. If there is
[40:29] uh what we would call aliens,
[40:33] hallelujah, we would be the ones.
[40:37] We are the pilgrims. We are the
[40:40] strangers. We are the travelers.
[40:43] Hallelujah. And we're traveling from
[40:46] earth to glory.
[40:48] Jesus Christ. Who is the first fruit of
[40:51] his kind?
[40:55] Jesus the creation of God.
[40:58] Hallelujah. Has brethren.
[41:01] Hallelujah. Amen. And we who are born of
[41:03] the Holy Ghost.
[41:06] We are the brethren of Jesus Christ.
[41:10] Hallelujah. Amen. Even the prophet of
[41:11] God says, "Whatever he
[41:14] is, whatever he is is what we are in
[41:18] this world." Hallelujah. If he's the
[41:22] ultimate,
[41:24] so are we. If he's the absolute,
[41:28] so are we. If he's the
[41:30] unlimited, so are we. Not that we make
[41:34] ourselves
[41:35] that we've got the ultimate in
[41:38] us. We got the absolute in us. We've got
[41:42] the unlimited God in
[41:45] us. This is why we cannot
[41:51] uh uh be
[41:53] controlled by any kind of a church
[41:57] system.
[41:59] Understand where I'm going with this?
[42:00] Amen. Because we are born of God.
[42:04] Hallelujah. And we are led by the Holy
[42:07] Ghost.
[42:09] Think about it now.
[42:11] They saw
[42:15] Jesus coming into
[42:18] Jerusalem riding on a
[42:21] donkey and they did not have the
[42:25] revelation of who he really was.
[42:28] They say, "Who is this?
[42:30] And some say this is Jesus,
[42:33] the prophet of Nazareth
[42:36] of Galilee.
[42:37] Hallelujah. Amen. But in reality,
[42:41] he was Jesus, the son of God who was
[42:45] born in Bethlehem.
[42:48] Hallelujah. Amen. And here was
[42:50] Jesus coming in on a
[42:53] donkey finds the church in a corrupt
[42:56] state.
[42:58] Hallelujah. Amen. What would you do? Or
[43:02] what would you have done if you found
[43:05] the church in a corrupt
[43:07] state in a place where they're not doing
[43:10] what God wants them to do?
[43:14] Don't grab your panic button.
[43:17] Hallelujah. I'm bringing out a
[43:20] point. The word will stand when nothing
[43:24] else
[43:25] will. Hallelujah.
[43:28] He began to whip them. He began to throw
[43:31] over the money
[43:32] chains. Hallelujah. He he he turned over
[43:35] the dove caves. Hallelujah. And he said
[43:39] one thing that is so profound to me. My
[43:44] house shall be called the house of
[43:49] prayer. Now that still stands today.
[43:54] talking about the
[43:56] building, he's talking about your
[43:59] building because today we are the
[44:02] tabernacles of
[44:03] God. Glory to God. And even today, we
[44:08] should be called the house
[44:11] of it doesn't stop
[44:13] there. They thought he was a bad man
[44:16] because he did not follow the
[44:18] tradition. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[44:21] First of all, no
[44:24] Nazareth, no Nazerite,
[44:28] if he wasn't a Levite
[44:31] had
[44:32] no place
[44:35] in the temple as a priest.
[44:39] Hallelujah. Amen. No, no priest, a
[44:42] prophet, put that word, no prophet, no
[44:46] prophet, had ever come out of Nazareth.
[44:52] And and according to the scriptures,
[44:55] he was to come out of Bethlehem, Judea.
[44:59] Hallelujah. So he threw the people's
[45:02] minds off
[45:04] because they knew the scriptures well
[45:07] enough to basically say can any good
[45:11] thing come out of Nazareth.
[45:15] But as Jesus came to
[45:19] them hallelujah, he is the light of the
[45:22] world.
[45:24] But understand darkness cannot
[45:26] comprehend light.
[45:30] Hallelujah. And instead of joining
[45:33] in the praise of the people who were
[45:37] saying hosana
[45:39] hosana, blessed is he that comes in the
[45:42] name of the Lord. Hallelujah. They
[45:45] question his
[45:47] entrance. They question his
[45:50] entrance. They didn't know who he was.
[45:53] But often time when he
[45:55] comes he is unrecognizable.
[45:59] Hallelujah. Because he doesn't come in a
[46:03] way that you want him to come. But he
[46:05] always comes according to the will of
[46:09] God. Hallelujah. If they had only
[46:12] knew who was riding on the donkey.
[46:16] Oh, somebody help me here. He was the
[46:19] king of kings. He's the Lord of lords.
[46:23] Hallelujah. He was greater than Pilate.
[46:27] Come on, somebody. Greater than the
[46:29] Pharisees, greater than the Sadducees.
[46:32] Hallelujah. He was God manifested in the
[46:35] flesh.
[46:37] Hallelujah. Amen. The thing that I love
[46:39] about him, he had an authority. He had a
[46:43] power to back up what he proclaimed he
[46:47] was. Hallelujah. He was the savior of
[46:50] the world. And even though he turned
[46:53] over the
[46:55] temple way of worshiping and selling
[46:58] things, hallelujah, he still was God.
[47:02] And he proved it because even though
[47:05] there were many who was angry at
[47:08] him, all those who were chosen by
[47:11] him, some of them was healed, some of
[47:15] them was delivered. Hallelujah. But you
[47:17] see, when you hear the scriptures read,
[47:20] all you hear about is that Jesus went
[47:22] into the
[47:24] temple and turned it upside
[47:27] down. You don't hear about the healings.
[47:30] Come on, somebody. You don't hear about
[47:32] the healings. You don't hear about those
[47:35] lame people that walked again.
[47:37] Hallelujah. Glory to God. But wherever
[47:41] Jesus is, there's always the
[47:44] supernatural.
[47:46] Somebody help me here. He is
[47:49] unlimited. Power in heaven and earth is
[47:52] given unto me.
[47:54] He's the
[47:55] ultimate. He's the absolute.
[47:58] Hallelujah. He's the unlimit unlim
[48:01] unlimited. Y'all understand me? I'm
[48:04] getting to a
[48:06] place where you don't come up higher.
[48:09] You got to come up higher. You must come
[48:12] up higher. Hallelujah. in your way of
[48:16] thinking. Hallelujah. You cannot con
[48:19] constantly think like
[48:20] men. If you got the Holy Ghost, you're
[48:24] no longer just a man. You are a God man.
[48:29] Hallelujah. You don't you you understand
[48:32] me? Brother Brandham said, "If the
[48:34] omnipotence is in you, you are
[48:38] omnipotent." Hallelujah. We've got to
[48:41] stop resting on our feelings.
[48:45] Because feelings is not safe.
[48:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, Jesus always
[48:51] did
[48:52] something. Always contrary to the
[48:56] normal. Is that right? They couldn't
[48:59] figure him out. He had a bad reputation
[49:02] in the
[49:03] beginning. Hallelujah. That's why God
[49:06] always used those
[49:08] people who got bad
[49:11] reputations. Hallelujah. He always come
[49:13] to the scum of the
[49:17] earth to change them into the saints of
[49:20] God. I don't know about you, but I
[49:24] needed his grace.
[49:26] I needed his mercy. Hallelujah. I needed
[49:29] his favor. Glory to God. Oh my God. Like
[49:34] they say, you don't know like I know
[49:38] what he's done for me. Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:42] But listen, he comes in a way. They
[49:46] couldn't figure him out. Here was this
[49:49] man from Nazareth.
[49:52] They say, "Who gave you the
[49:54] authority?" There's somebody who gives
[49:57] you the authority to do what you're
[50:00] doing. Let me ask you people who gives
[50:03] you the authority. Hallelujah. To claim
[50:07] you to claim your
[50:09] bride. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my God. You
[50:14] You're not even an organization.
[50:17] You're not even a denomination.
[50:19] You don't have a big cathedral.
[50:22] Hallelujah. You You're in this little
[50:24] place.
[50:26] Oh, come on, somebody. But God always
[50:29] hides
[50:31] himself in simplicity.
[50:34] Glory to God.
[50:36] Jesus worked on the Sabbath day.
[50:41] Wait a minute. He's not supposed to work
[50:45] on the Sabbath day. He's supposed to
[50:47] rest.
[50:49] Hallelujah. But when Jesus heard his
[50:52] father say
[50:54] something to show him a vision,
[50:58] he would do it. He was from another
[51:01] world.
[51:02] Like I said the other day, he was on
[51:04] another frequency.
[51:06] He had a different
[51:08] connection. He healed on the Sabbath
[51:11] day.
[51:13] He preached in the synagogue.
[51:16] They knew who he
[51:17] was in the sense that he came from
[51:20] Nazareth,
[51:23] but they were afraid of him. Hallelujah.
[51:26] Amen. Because they knew he had the power
[51:30] to give sight to the blind. They knew he
[51:34] had power to turn water into wine.
[51:38] He had power, hallelujah, to make the
[51:42] lame walk. But they were afraid of him.
[51:46] They searched the scriptures, but they
[51:49] couldn't find
[51:50] him because he was hidden in the
[51:52] scripture.
[51:54] Hallelujah. And he purposely did it. Oh,
[51:57] come on, somebody. Think about this. I
[52:01] think I preached this the other day.
[52:03] Hallelujah. He comes to a woman
[52:06] called Mary,
[52:08] born of a virgin,
[52:11] hallelujah, that was already engaged.
[52:16] Hallelujah. There was a lot of virgins
[52:18] out there that wasn't
[52:21] engaged. But Jesus was setting up the
[52:25] stage behind the Jews. Somebody help me
[52:28] here. Hallelujah. Amen. And what
[52:31] happens? Even Joseph was blinded.
[52:36] But God gave him sight. Hallelujah.
[52:39] Amen. How can a virgin
[52:42] have a child?
[52:45] The Bible says, "A virgin shall
[52:47] conceive." Somebody help me here. He
[52:50] went beyond the norm.
[52:54] And if you were Joseph,
[52:57] you wouldn't have believed it.
[52:59] Hallelujah. Somebody help me here.
[53:02] Yes sir. It would take a
[53:04] [Music]
[53:06] revelation. So thank God. Hallelujah.
[53:10] From Malachi 4 who explained uh to
[53:15] us. The church is not built upon Peter.
[53:19] It's not built upon the church. It's
[53:22] built upon revelation.
[53:24] Hallelujah. The gospel becomes a new
[53:27] book. Hallelujah. to those whom God has
[53:32] chosen to be bride. Hallelujah. Glory to
[53:36] God. Think about this. Almighty God, he
[53:40] he he he he did things that was so
[53:43] unexplainable.
[53:45] He stoops
[53:47] down and began to wash Peter's feet.
[53:51] Hallelujah. They knew he was the Christ.
[53:54] Hallelujah. They saw him as God.
[53:57] Hallelujah. Even the Pharisees knew he
[54:00] was a son of God. Because they said, "No
[54:03] man can do these things except God be
[54:07] with you." Hallelujah. But think about
[54:10] it. The humility of Jesus. Oh, somebody.
[54:16] Let me tell y'all something. Let me say
[54:18] something to the women.
[54:20] Let me say something to the women.
[54:23] Hallelujah. To to be obedient to your
[54:26] husband.
[54:29] does not make you
[54:31] weak. It makes you strong.
[54:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Cuz we're living in a
[54:38] world where where women's live
[54:42] means that the woman is above the man.
[54:46] But it takes a holy ghostfilled woman
[54:50] to obey her husband in this day.
[54:53] Somebody help me. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes
[54:57] sir. It is not proper for the woman to
[55:01] rule the
[55:03] house is not the
[55:06] word. And if a man let his wife rule the
[55:11] house the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost
[55:15] will never let a man let his wife rule
[55:18] the house.
[55:20] Hallelujah. I'm not talking about
[55:22] beating up on her. No sir. But that man
[55:26] would live a
[55:28] life consecrated before that woman that
[55:31] she'll humble herself
[55:34] and call him Lord.
[55:36] [Music]
[55:38] Amen. It it works both ways. Hallelujah.
[55:44] Amen. You cannot
[55:47] be
[55:48] h the bride of Christ and your feelings
[55:53] and your
[55:54] emotions override the word.
[55:57] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[56:01] It's whatever my Lord says, that's what
[56:04] we're going to do. Oh my God. If you're
[56:08] going to be a real woman of God, you
[56:10] must surrender down to yourself to the
[56:15] word. People, you know, the world will
[56:18] tell a woman, you ain't got no sense.
[56:21] [Music]
[56:23] Hallelujah. Let that man rule you. As
[56:26] long as he's ruling me with the word,
[56:29] as long as he's ruling me with
[56:32] love, let him
[56:35] rule. Hallelujah. Amen. I see y'all.
[56:38] Some of y'all don't want that. But
[56:40] nevertheless, that's the way it really
[56:42] is. Hallelujah.
[56:45] Right. Amen. One thing I love about
[56:47] Jesus,
[56:49] he backs up every word.
[56:52] He He will back up all of his word.
[56:55] Hallelujah. Is that right? Amen. Even
[56:58] before Pentecost,
[57:00] Mary, his his mother, Can I say it like
[57:02] that so you understand who I'm talking
[57:05] about?
[57:07] At the wedding,
[57:09] she said unto the servants, "Whatever he
[57:13] say, do
[57:18] it." Hallelujah. Amen. Now, we're in
[57:21] this wedding
[57:23] now. Oh my
[57:25] God. Whatever he say, do
[57:30] Hallelujah. We've got a prophet
[57:33] who's given us a word.
[57:36] of our husband
[57:38] and whatever he say do
[57:40] it somebody. Think about it at the
[57:45] wedding turns water into wine.
[57:49] Hallelujah. Amen. If you had been
[57:52] there and all you he said go fill the
[57:56] pots. Go fill six pots with
[58:00] water. Hallelujah. Well, they didn't ask
[58:03] for water. They were looking for
[58:06] wine. Somebody help me here. He said,
[58:09] "Go and fill the pot."
[58:13] And then afterwards, you come here. And
[58:17] then he dips, they dips the
[58:20] picture into a pot of
[58:25] water and you go serve them
[58:29] wine. Hallelujah.
[58:32] They dipped out the water. But then they
[58:35] began to pour the wine. Pour the water.
[58:38] The water was turned into wine. Somebody
[58:41] help me here. Let me tell you something.
[58:45] If you would do what he says do.
[58:47] Hallelujah. Let's bring it to our day.
[58:50] The water represents the word. The water
[58:54] represents the word. That word, if you
[58:58] do it like he said, will turn into wine.
[59:01] It will give you such a
[59:03] stimulation. It'll give you a
[59:06] revelation.
[59:08] Hallelujah. In the minds of a lot of the
[59:10] servants. They may have questioned a
[59:13] moment or
[59:14] two who Jesus was, but when they saw the
[59:19] water turn into wine, somebody help me
[59:22] here. You may have a question. who
[59:25] William Brandham is. But if you do what
[59:28] he
[59:29] says, word will turn into wine.
[59:33] Hallelujah. It will stimulate you. It
[59:36] will change you. It will put you into
[59:39] heavenly places by the anointing of the
[59:42] word. Hallelujah. We've got to go on.
[59:46] We've got to change that mention. And
[59:48] you can't change dimension just standing
[59:51] here. Something in you must
[59:54] change. Your attitude about the word
[59:56] must change. Somebody help me here. You
[1:00:00] and I must come to reverence this word
[1:00:04] in order for it to change.
[1:00:08] Hallelujah. Amen. Y'all hear me? I don't
[1:00:11] know about you. It's happening to
[1:00:14] you. It's changing from glory to glory.
[1:00:18] Right now, we are in the rapture.
[1:00:23] Hallelujah. And right now we are being
[1:00:27] changed inside out. You may not see it,
[1:00:32] but it's happening anyhow.
[1:00:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Like they say in that
[1:00:37] little
[1:00:39] proverb, like they say in that proverb,
[1:00:42] the things I used to do, I don't do no
[1:00:44] more. The places I used to go, I don't
[1:00:48] go no more. Hallelujah. The friends I
[1:00:51] used to have, I don't have them no more.
[1:00:54] Hallelujah. Why? Because the word is
[1:00:57] changing me. The word is changing you.
[1:01:00] It's washing you. It's cleansing you.
[1:01:05] Hallelujah. And the next step for some
[1:01:07] of us is that God is going to turn that
[1:01:11] water into. He's going to fill you and
[1:01:15] anoint you and put you into service.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah. Amen. First Thessalonians.
[1:01:24] Hallelujah. Amen. We're not earthbound.
[1:01:28] We are not earthbound. We came from
[1:01:31] glory and we go back to glory. I'm tired
[1:01:34] of this world. I'm tired of this world.
[1:01:38] I'm tired of the things of the world.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. If I'm in sitting in
[1:01:42] heavenly places, I want to act like it.
[1:01:48] I want to talk like it.
[1:01:50] Amen. I want to live like it.
[1:01:53] Hallelujah. I want the power of God to
[1:01:57] so live in me
[1:02:01] that the people will get confused.
[1:02:03] Hallelujah. And will say who is this?
[1:02:08] Hallelujah. Because Jesus is living in
[1:02:10] me so
[1:02:11] well. All they see is Jesus.
[1:02:16] Is that where we supposed to be?
[1:02:19] 1 Thessalonians 4
[1:02:23] 16-18. Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:29] Hallelujah. Amen. God is so good.
[1:02:33] Hallelujah. Amen. All I'm trying to do
[1:02:36] is invite you to ride this this this
[1:02:38] this this rocket with me.
[1:02:45] I'm not in a car.
[1:02:51] I'm an
[1:02:53] astronaut. Y'all hear me? And you know,
[1:02:56] I'm already in
[1:02:58] position. The smoke is already coming
[1:03:00] out. Somebody help me. The next move is
[1:03:04] going up. Hallelujah. Somebody help me
[1:03:08] here. Oh, it's the truth. It's the
[1:03:11] truth.
[1:03:12] You got to believe you are an astronaut.
[1:03:19] I don't have to act like the
[1:03:20] Pentecostals.
[1:03:22] Hallelujah. I don't need a runway. Come
[1:03:25] on
[1:03:27] somebody. All I got is a launching pad.
[1:03:30] Somebody help me. I got a launching pad.
[1:03:33] So do you.
[1:03:36] Amen. Hallelujah. Is that right? Brother
[1:03:39] Brandham said the next thing to happen
[1:03:41] is the
[1:03:42] rapture. That's what he say. He said it
[1:03:45] ain't going to be no revival like we
[1:03:46] think.
[1:03:49] Hallelujah. The revival that's coming.
[1:03:53] It is one, but it's
[1:03:56] reviving. All of those old Babylonry
[1:04:00] spirits two
[1:04:02] part is
[1:04:03] reviving the church
[1:04:06] world, anointing them.
[1:04:09] Hallelujah. Amen. But it's also
[1:04:11] anointing us.
[1:04:14] Y'all y'all believe that? It's bringing
[1:04:16] us to
[1:04:18] perfection. But the work God wants to
[1:04:20] do, we cannot do
[1:04:23] until we are perfected.
[1:04:26] We must come to that
[1:04:28] state where we're going to be completely
[1:04:30] obedient to the word.
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:37] Amen. Amen. I mean, he couldn't even
[1:04:40] open the seals.
[1:04:42] He couldn't even open the seals until he
[1:04:46] until he got brother Brandon more
[1:04:48] consecrated.
[1:04:51] Hello, somebody. He was a prophet, had
[1:04:54] done many things, but the Lord said,
[1:04:57] "You need to be more consecrated."
[1:05:01] Hallelujah.
[1:05:03] My house shall be called the house of
[1:05:06] prayer.
[1:05:09] For the Lord himself, 16th verse,
[1:05:15] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:05:18] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[1:05:21] an archangel, and with the trump of God,
[1:05:24] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:05:37] Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:05:40] be caught up together with them in the
[1:05:43] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[1:05:47] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:06:03] Let me say it like this because it come
[1:06:06] to
[1:06:07] me. We talk about the
[1:06:09] air meeting the Lord in the
[1:06:13] air. The air is another dimension.
[1:06:18] You have never seen air.
[1:06:22] You have had the effects of air.
[1:06:26] blows, the wind blows.
[1:06:29] Thank you. Hallelujah. Amen. But show
[1:06:32] that you understand that it is another
[1:06:34] dimension.
[1:06:36] Because Satan is the prince
[1:06:39] in the power of the
[1:06:42] air. He's here, but do you see him?
[1:06:47] Because he's in another dimension.
[1:06:51] And if we're going to be caught
[1:06:53] up, we must be caught up into that
[1:06:56] dimension.
[1:06:58] Hallelujah. Amen. Because otherwise when
[1:07:01] the rapture takes place, everybody going
[1:07:04] to see
[1:07:05] us. But everybody won't see us.
[1:07:09] Not when we come with Jesus riding on on
[1:07:12] on
[1:07:14] horses. Whatever it is, when he comes
[1:07:17] again that second time, they see him
[1:07:21] coming on a a white
[1:07:22] horse. But in this time,
[1:07:26] they won't see us. Is that right? That's
[1:07:30] why brother Brown said many many will be
[1:07:32] missing and they won't even know it.
[1:07:36] Won't even know where they are.
[1:07:38] Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] You say brothers, I don't know about
[1:07:40] that. But I'll say,
[1:07:43] was brother Brandham
[1:07:45] experienced when he was laying on the
[1:07:47] bed?
[1:07:50] Hallelujah. He was caught up.
[1:07:54] I don't care what nobody else said, but
[1:07:56] he was Can I say it like this? He was
[1:07:59] pre-raptured.
[1:08:01] Hallelujah. Even though his body was
[1:08:04] there, he was there.
[1:08:07] Everything else was real.
[1:08:10] Hallelujah. That's why the Bible said we
[1:08:12] do not die.
[1:08:15] Hallelujah. But these old bodies, these
[1:08:17] old these the the real you.
[1:08:21] The real you. When you die, you go into
[1:08:24] your theophony.
[1:08:28] But when the rapture takes place, it
[1:08:31] doesn't just involve your theophony,
[1:08:34] but it also involves your glorified
[1:08:36] body. Hallelujah. Let me ask you
[1:08:40] something. Here was Jesus risen from the
[1:08:44] dead. Hallelujah. And he walks through
[1:08:47] the door.
[1:08:49] Come on, somebody. Amen. That dimension
[1:08:52] is unlimited
[1:08:55] compared to this one. Y'all better hear
[1:08:57] me. Hallelujah. Amen. And Jesus proved
[1:09:00] it. He said, "Thomas, fill me.
[1:09:04] Rush your hand in my side. Thrush your
[1:09:07] hand." And he said flesh is blood. This
[1:09:11] is flesh and blood or flesh. This is
[1:09:12] flesh.
[1:09:14] Come on somebody. So that you'll
[1:09:17] understand your level of
[1:09:20] thinking has changed.
[1:09:24] If you think like a
[1:09:26] denomination, you will remain a
[1:09:28] denomination.
[1:09:31] Hallelujah. Amen. But the bride of Jesus
[1:09:34] Christ is to take on the whole
[1:09:38] word to take on the whole word.
[1:09:42] Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] And the word come to identify
[1:09:47] you to give you
[1:09:49] back your
[1:09:51] identity. Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] Amen. Is that right? Brother said Jesus
[1:09:57] came to know who he was by way of the
[1:10:00] scripture.
[1:10:03] Hallelujah.
[1:10:05] Can I say one more thing?
[1:10:08] This word Emmanuel,
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:12] we look at the word
[1:10:15] Emmanuel God with us.
[1:10:19] When Jesus was born, the angel said,
[1:10:22] "You call his name Jesus."
[1:10:26] And that meant Jehovah
[1:10:28] Savior. Jehovah. So he was with them.
[1:10:31] Jehovah Savior.
[1:10:34] But understand Emmanuel had a different
[1:10:36] tone to
[1:10:38] it because we know
[1:10:40] that he's not just with us. He's in us.
[1:10:44] So you can understand.
[1:10:47] This is why
[1:10:48] Jesus was
[1:10:50] in Emmanuel was in
[1:10:54] Jesus. God was in Christ reconcile the
[1:10:58] world to himself.
[1:11:00] You say, "Well, I don't understand. Let
[1:11:02] me ask you a question. If the angel come
[1:11:05] to you, had come to you and say, "This
[1:11:08] child in you, his name shall be called
[1:11:10] Jesus."
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:14] How would you have raised
[1:11:17] him? Oh
[1:11:19] Jesus, you're the word of God. Don't
[1:11:22] touch this. Don't touch that. You can't
[1:11:25] do this.
[1:11:29] how it was.
[1:11:32] He had to be touched
[1:11:35] by the feeling of our infirmities.
[1:11:42] Jesus was free.
[1:11:45] And Mary couldn't bind him.
[1:11:48] Neither could Joseph bind him.
[1:11:51] Hallelujah.
[1:11:53] He had to be
[1:11:54] bullied. Bullied.
[1:12:00] Every little
[1:12:02] test that we go through in our
[1:12:06] flesh, he had to go through
[1:12:09] it. I'm telling you, he didn't even get
[1:12:11] the Holy Ghost till he was
[1:12:15] 30. Somebody help me. So, as a man,
[1:12:20] he was tempted.
[1:12:22] Come on, somebody. Amen. That's
[1:12:24] Emmanuel.
[1:12:26] God in flesh. Emmanuel
[1:12:30] in Jesus
[1:12:32] going through your trials from the time
[1:12:35] he was born to the day he got the Holy
[1:12:37] Ghost.
[1:12:39] Somebody help me here. Oh, it's the
[1:12:41] truth. Doesn't that make it different?
[1:12:44] Now, that's why the Bible said he was
[1:12:46] tested in
[1:12:48] every every way a man is tested.
[1:12:52] But he had to be tested as a man.
[1:12:56] is God
[1:12:57] in order to understand you. He needed to
[1:13:01] know what lust felt like.
[1:13:04] The Bible said he was he was tempted in
[1:13:07] every way
[1:13:09] but without sin. Y'all understand me?
[1:13:12] Why? Because he knew who he was.
[1:13:15] He wasn't a hybrid.
[1:13:19] He was all word.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Brother said
[1:13:24] he had
[1:13:26] headaches. God having headaches. No,
[1:13:29] that was a man Jesus who had
[1:13:32] headaches. God tried him in every way.
[1:13:37] Now that same Emmanuel
[1:13:40] is in you. He's already been tried. He's
[1:13:44] already been tested and he made a hund.
[1:13:48] Somebody help me here. And so the
[1:13:50] Emmanuel in you who is Jesus Christ.
[1:13:55] Is that right? He said, "I'll never
[1:13:58] forsake you, nor leave you." The Bible
[1:14:03] said we have not a high priest.
[1:14:06] We have not a high priest that cannot be
[1:14:09] touched by the feelings of our
[1:14:12] The Bible said he would comfort us.
[1:14:15] Somebody help. Amen. You hear what I'm
[1:14:18] saying? So, let me say it like this so
[1:14:20] you better understand.
[1:14:22] I'm sure you follow me. I'm trying to
[1:14:24] get it right.
[1:14:28] Brother Brandham says influence. I
[1:14:29] believe it
[1:14:33] is. He said it was
[1:14:36] there that the priest examined, you
[1:14:40] heard me say it before, the
[1:14:42] lamb. The lamb was tested.
[1:14:47] The lamb was examined,
[1:14:50] not the person who brought,
[1:14:53] the person who sinned.
[1:14:56] Even if it was he used to he used to he
[1:14:58] said the man who brought did the
[1:15:00] adultery brought the
[1:15:03] lamb. They would judge that
[1:15:07] man. He judged the lamb.
[1:15:12] In order to get higher in God, you must
[1:15:15] understand that God has already judged
[1:15:17] your
[1:15:20] sin. Jesus, he was the perfect lamb.
[1:15:25] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:15:28] He whom the Son is set free is free
[1:15:31] indeed.
[1:15:32] It's because of Calvary.
[1:15:35] It's because of Calvary we have been set
[1:15:38] free.
[1:15:40] Oh my god. Now you can be like Johnny
[1:15:43] Crow.
[1:15:45] You done been set free and you don't
[1:15:46] even know
[1:15:48] going around the same
[1:15:50] circle. God said I done made you free.
[1:15:53] Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] Come on, somebody. I came here April
[1:16:00] 27th to let you know you're free.
[1:16:03] Hallelujah.
[1:16:05] Don't go around the same
[1:16:08] circle.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah. And listen, this is the part
[1:16:12] I love. I'll never leave you.
[1:16:16] I'll never forsake you. Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] That's why brother Bram said that the
[1:16:21] blood of Jesus Christ cannot blasphe the
[1:16:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:16:25] Hallelujah. And your sins have already
[1:16:29] been
[1:16:31] forgiven. Amen. You say, "Well, brother
[1:16:33] Bruce, what are you talking about?"
[1:16:35] Hallelujah. The Bible said he died once
[1:16:38] and
[1:16:39] for Hallelujah. God ain't going back and
[1:16:42] forth applying the blood. The blood has
[1:16:45] already been applied. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:16:49] But he cannot help you if you don't
[1:16:52] receive it.
[1:16:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Too many of us is
[1:16:57] looking at this mirror.
[1:17:02] the flesh. And I'm going to tell you
[1:17:04] another thing. If you don't drop your
[1:17:07] past, you don't drop your past.
[1:17:14] Hallelujah. Amen. That's why a baby is
[1:17:18] cut away from the mother.
[1:17:21] Hallelujah. And when that baby come
[1:17:23] forth,
[1:17:25] that baby has no sin.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah. Amen. And I don't care who
[1:17:31] where you were
[1:17:33] born in a trash
[1:17:37] can. God saves you.
[1:17:41] Y'all understand me? Amen. That past is
[1:17:44] gone. Stop allowing the
[1:17:47] devil. If you think about what you did,
[1:17:50] what happened?
[1:17:53] Oh, it was so
[1:17:54] bad. Glory to God. You got to get over
[1:17:58] that.
[1:18:01] And the only way you can get over that
[1:18:04] is to be an overcomer in
[1:18:06] Christ. Now, I'm talking to somebody I
[1:18:09] talking to. I'm trying to tell you, you
[1:18:13] can't have mixed thoughts about
[1:18:15] yourself. Am I a sinner or am
[1:18:18] I am I the foolish virgin or am I the
[1:18:21] bride?
[1:18:25] Make up your mind.
[1:18:28] God didn't already told you who you are,
[1:18:31] but you must accept it.
[1:18:34] Let me tell you one more thing. God,
[1:18:37] let me tell you about forgiveness.
[1:18:40] Everybody say, "Well, I forgive you."
[1:18:44] But but when you when you were friend,
[1:18:48] you were there.
[1:18:51] And when you when you made your mistake,
[1:18:54] they put you here.
[1:18:59] But when you forgive somebody and really
[1:19:01] forgive
[1:19:02] them, you restore them back to their
[1:19:05] original.
[1:19:09] Is that right? That's what Jesus did. We
[1:19:13] failed as a people. He has forgiven us
[1:19:17] and now we're kings in
[1:19:19] peace. Y'all understand me? You can't
[1:19:23] say, "Oh, well, I can't I can't trust."
[1:19:24] God didn't ask you to trust him, but he
[1:19:26] just told you to put them back where
[1:19:27] they fell.
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:34] Y'all hear what I'm saying? That's real
[1:19:37] forgiveness. That's the way God did
[1:19:40] us. That's way we must do
[1:19:45] others. You can't come to that
[1:19:49] translation until you are clearly clean.
[1:19:54] And there is no oppositions in your
[1:19:56] spirit or your
[1:20:00] soul. You're being changed, people.
[1:20:04] It ain't time for no pride.
[1:20:07] We don't have space for pride.
[1:20:11] Hallelujah. Amen. We don't have time for
[1:20:13] that.
[1:20:15] And the only way you're going to make
[1:20:17] this is to kill that old
[1:20:20] devil that came with your natural birth.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah. You and I must be born
[1:20:26] again,
[1:20:28] a new mind, a new spirit, a new
[1:20:32] soul. I I don't know about you. I've got
[1:20:34] to make it.
[1:20:36] Whatever it
[1:20:39] takes to embarrass me. Whatever he
[1:20:46] Amen. This life is going to end. And all
[1:20:50] of us know that.
[1:20:52] But at the end of the day, I want him to
[1:20:55] say, "Well
[1:20:57] done, faithful servant."
[1:21:00] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, talking about
[1:21:02] being translated, the Bible said, "Eno
[1:21:05] walked with God."
[1:21:08] That was a process. Don't you know?
[1:21:11] Hallelujah. Whatever Enoch had to go
[1:21:15] through with God,
[1:21:18] he corrected it.
[1:21:21] Hallelujah. Amen. That was the only way
[1:21:23] he was able to be translated.
[1:21:27] That's right. Amen. That's why brother
[1:21:29] God sent a
[1:21:31] prophet to give us a word that we could
[1:21:34] change
[1:21:35] into that be translated.
[1:21:39] Hallelujah. Amen. And I tell you like
[1:21:41] this. It has been a journey.
[1:21:46] Hallelujah. You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:21:48] Give me a few more minutes, please.
[1:21:51] Coming from the message,
[1:21:55] paragraph 67.
[1:21:58] He said ministry.
[1:22:00] What does it
[1:22:02] the astronaut sees things?
[1:22:06] Planes and everything is date.
[1:22:11] Hallelujah. Amen. See, see that's why
[1:22:13] I've been trying to tell
[1:22:15] people to have a good
[1:22:18] time of
[1:22:20] time. But this message is to produce
[1:22:22] sons and daughters of God.
[1:22:26] their perfection.
[1:22:29] Hallelujah. Amen. So does the spirit. So
[1:22:32] so does the spiritual
[1:22:37] astronaut. He he goes beyond the clouds.
[1:22:41] He goes beyond the
[1:22:43] creeds and beyond the
[1:22:46] doubts out into outer space.
[1:22:50] Out of
[1:22:51] space, all unbelief.
[1:22:55] out of space. He don't hear the
[1:22:58] chattering sayings.
[1:23:01] Well, he can't do
[1:23:04] it. This is the way the devil, he talks.
[1:23:08] If you can't do that,
[1:23:10] you know what I mean? And that's what he
[1:23:12] does. If a person need to be raised from
[1:23:15] the dead, if a person needs to be raised
[1:23:17] from the dead,
[1:23:20] the devil say you can't do that.
[1:23:25] or he said you're not
[1:23:30] worthy. Tell me any any any man of
[1:23:35] God is worthy to do anything for
[1:23:40] God and I'll show you a
[1:23:43] scripture where the Bible said no man
[1:23:45] was worthy.
[1:23:49] None of us. We all fall. We all come
[1:23:55] But he's not looking at you.
[1:23:58] It's the sacrifice.
[1:24:02] Right. So you got to stop saying I
[1:24:07] can. Hallelujah. It should not even be
[1:24:10] in your
[1:24:11] vocabulary because you're now
[1:24:13] contradicting the scripture.
[1:24:16] said we can do all
[1:24:20] things which strengthens.
[1:24:24] You got to stay with the word. You must
[1:24:27] stay with the word. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:30] Right. Let me move on in this in this.
[1:24:33] He says um out of space where he he
[1:24:37] don't hear the chattering
[1:24:39] saying well you can't do it. Nobody will
[1:24:44] cooperate.
[1:24:46] cooperate with you. You can't do this.
[1:24:50] You can't do that. He doesn't notice
[1:24:53] it. He is an astronaut.
[1:24:58] He goes on beyond those
[1:25:01] clouds. It's too
[1:25:04] stormy. We can't make
[1:25:07] it. It don't make any difference to an
[1:25:11] astronaut. He goes beyond the storm.
[1:25:15] That's the way it is to the real
[1:25:17] astronaut faith today.
[1:25:22] The real astronaut faith
[1:25:27] today, the Pentecostal faith, an
[1:25:29] astronaut
[1:25:31] faith that can
[1:25:33] believe possible is
[1:25:37] possible. They say,
[1:25:39] "Well, the doctor said so and so.
[1:25:44] That might be all right,
[1:25:46] but an astronaut don't believe that.
[1:25:50] Hallelujah. Amen. When it's wrote here,
[1:25:54] he's got it in his heart.
[1:25:57] Something tells
[1:25:59] him he's just propelled right on
[1:26:03] out. In other words, he flies right on
[1:26:09] out. Right on out into the space.
[1:26:14] because we're living in an astronaut
[1:26:18] age out in
[1:26:22] space. You hear what I'm saying?
[1:26:24] Hallelujah. There's so many things we
[1:26:27] need to discover.
[1:26:30] But we'll never see what we need to
[1:26:34] see. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, the devil
[1:26:38] knows what he's doing. You know what the
[1:26:40] devil did to America?
[1:26:44] When America used to be spiritual,
[1:26:49] he gave the people, the church people,
[1:26:51] things of the world.
[1:26:56] Now, I'm I'm I'm just saying be careful.
[1:26:59] But what I'm saying is this.
[1:27:02] I can remember the time in my
[1:27:05] life there may have been one black
[1:27:08] family on the
[1:27:12] block that had a
[1:27:17] car. Oh, a
[1:27:20] home only the doctors of the day of that
[1:27:27] day the fairer colored people
[1:27:35] Yeah, they they section us off, you
[1:27:39] know, and the the rich light-skinned
[1:27:42] people, they were on one side of the
[1:27:43] track,
[1:27:46] and the dark skin was on the
[1:27:51] other. Y'all looking at me like I'm
[1:27:53] crazy. I'm sure they did that there,
[1:27:55] too. That's what they do. That's the
[1:27:58] devil. He divide and
[1:27:59] come. Nevertheless,
[1:28:04] opportunity came.
[1:28:08] Y'all might not believe this,
[1:28:11] but black people in
[1:28:13] America used to be spiritual.
[1:28:19] I'm telling y'all the truth. We worship
[1:28:22] God.
[1:28:24] We reverence God.
[1:28:27] We didn't play with God.
[1:28:30] Most of us, I mean, even being a
[1:28:31] Baptist,
[1:28:35] but the more we prospered,
[1:28:39] the more we forgot about God.
[1:28:42] Y'all hear what I'm saying? And and what
[1:28:45] I'm trying to say
[1:28:47] is amazing when God says, "Give it all
[1:28:52] to me."
[1:28:55] And this is what I try to tell people.
[1:28:57] God asked you for something.
[1:29:00] Cuz he's got something greater.
[1:29:04] Hallelujah. Is that right? So what I'm
[1:29:08] trying to say, he blinded the people,
[1:29:10] don't blind. Like I said, if you keep
[1:29:14] God
[1:29:16] first, give whatever you
[1:29:18] want, not just what you
[1:29:21] need, what you want, because he knows
[1:29:24] you're going to make the right
[1:29:25] decisions.
[1:29:29] Hallelujah. I believe that.
[1:29:32] Oh Lord, let let me move on.
[1:29:34] So we're living in space
[1:29:39] where this is what he says where all
[1:29:41] things are possible.
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:47] So if everything become possible, that
[1:29:50] mean the God in you is unlimited.
[1:29:53] Hallelujah. And because he's unlimited,
[1:29:55] you are unlimited.
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:58] Come on, somebody. He says, "So the
[1:30:01] spiritual
[1:30:02] astronaut has a control power,
[1:30:06] a control
[1:30:08] tower down here like man
[1:30:12] is there." And the Holy Ghost in
[1:30:17] him. I'm going move on by the grace of
[1:30:19] God. So you'll know.
[1:30:23] I don't even know how long I'll go. Give
[1:30:24] me Okay, it's about 12 20. Give me 10
[1:30:27] more minutes. You're a free person.
[1:30:30] Amen. So, you need to know
[1:30:34] that the kingdom, you know, I I for a
[1:30:37] long time, you know, all of us thought
[1:30:38] heaven is way up
[1:30:45] here and we thought God was so far
[1:30:49] away and the Bible said he's near thee.
[1:30:52] even in your
[1:30:53] mouth. We've been we've been we've been
[1:30:56] taught so many bad
[1:30:58] things. These things keep us from having
[1:31:00] that relationship and contact with God.
[1:31:05] But listen, he said in this in in the
[1:31:08] prayer,
[1:31:10] the our father's prayer,
[1:31:13] is the
[1:31:13] kingdom. Thine is the kingdom.
[1:31:19] Thine is the kingdom, the power and the
[1:31:21] glory.
[1:31:26] So that that that that uh kingdom
[1:31:32] is not far away.
[1:31:35] You understand? Matter of fact,
[1:31:39] is in you. How many of y'all
[1:31:42] remember when Jesus told
[1:31:45] Herod, "If my
[1:31:48] kingdom was of this world,
[1:31:52] I will fight for
[1:31:53] it. He had not yet died
[1:31:57] yet. His kingdom had not yet come
[1:32:00] yet. But his kingdom has
[1:32:03] come and it's in you.
[1:32:06] the beginning of a a whole new
[1:32:09] world but you kindness of power.
[1:32:16] Is that right? So to understand what I'm
[1:32:19] getting
[1:32:20] to, God will always fight for
[1:32:26] you. Always
[1:32:29] because he's in you. His kingdom is in
[1:32:33] you.
[1:32:34] Hallelujah. Amen. That's right.
[1:32:37] Listen. In the message paradox,
[1:32:42] paragraph 145,
[1:32:45] he said, "God,
[1:32:47] let me so be
[1:32:50] blended. Let me so be blended. Let me be
[1:32:54] so dead to
[1:32:56] myself anything
[1:33:02] around but be the conscious of the word
[1:33:04] of God living in us
[1:33:08] today. Be the conscious
[1:33:11] Lord of
[1:33:12] God. Not on the pages of a
[1:33:16] book consciousness of the word of
[1:33:19] God which is written and read of all
[1:33:22] men.
[1:33:24] because of
[1:33:26] that all day
[1:33:31] that I
[1:33:32] am you are a reflection of the word of
[1:33:36] God.
[1:33:41] One more quote
[1:33:44] coming from the position of a believer
[1:33:45] in Christ
[1:33:49] that's uh year
[1:33:51] 55 227.
[1:33:55] I'm closing.
[1:33:58] Think about it. When John the Baptist
[1:34:00] says, "Behold the lamb."
[1:34:05] I had an intention to go a different
[1:34:06] way, but God led me this way.
[1:34:09] Behold the lamb.
[1:34:11] So when you say behold, says take notice
[1:34:13] of this.
[1:34:18] You'll even hear brother Brandon
[1:34:20] sometimes on the table. Don't miss
[1:34:24] this. He puts a emphasis on what he's
[1:34:27] about to say. Now, I'm going I'm going
[1:34:29] to say something. I hope you get
[1:34:31] this and a lot of us just move right on
[1:34:34] on
[1:34:36] because we just see little words
[1:34:37] there and we don't catch the revelation
[1:34:40] of what he's
[1:34:41] saying.
[1:34:42] But, you need to stop. He says, "Listen,
[1:34:46] you need to listen cuz there's something
[1:34:50] there natural eye can't pick up."
[1:34:54] But let me go on. He said,
[1:34:57] "No, so if God was so pleased with
[1:35:02] Christ till he accepted him and said,
[1:35:06] "This is my beloved
[1:35:07] son, I'm well
[1:35:10] pleased." And through Christ being the
[1:35:13] perfect one,
[1:35:15] us dead to our own thoughts and
[1:35:21] ideas born of the spirit of
[1:35:24] God walking not after the
[1:35:29] theology. So let me I want y'all to hear
[1:35:33] how can I say this Lord but let me say
[1:35:36] it like this
[1:35:37] there's nobody can be as deep in this
[1:35:40] message as message preachers.
[1:35:47] But my my question
[1:35:51] is did the depth you heard did it change
[1:35:54] you?
[1:35:57] You understand me? With the many uh
[1:36:00] revelations we've
[1:36:02] heard for the rapture.
[1:36:06] Y'all understand what I'm saying? We
[1:36:08] need something that's going to change
[1:36:13] The revelations are great.
[1:36:16] Hallelujah. But if that revelation is
[1:36:19] not rel related to you,
[1:36:24] if you can't confess,
[1:36:26] what you just preached is where I am.
[1:36:31] You need to be you need to
[1:36:33] understand this is where you should be.
[1:36:39] No sinners
[1:36:41] will make a rapture.
[1:36:44] Y'all understand me? Only the image of
[1:36:49] Christ.
[1:36:51] Brother had to bring the whole
[1:36:55] word. We can't have a piece of hand
[1:36:58] missing or piece of a leg. That's not
[1:37:01] the full image.
[1:37:03] Jesus Christ was the full image of God.
[1:37:08] And in order to be accepted and we must
[1:37:11] be the fullness,
[1:37:16] we're not going to be raised Baptist and
[1:37:18] Methodist.
[1:37:20] We're going to be raised the
[1:37:22] word. Am I making
[1:37:25] sense? My point is, some of y'all done
[1:37:28] shut me off, but I'll say by the grace
[1:37:31] of God,
[1:37:32] not by
[1:37:34] power.
[1:37:35] is not by might
[1:37:38] but by my spirit.
[1:37:41] And the house of God is a correct a
[1:37:43] house of correction.
[1:37:47] That's what we're here for, to be
[1:37:50] corrected. And Lord, not my will, but
[1:37:54] thine be
[1:37:56] done. That's all I'm saying. You know,
[1:37:59] I'm I'm pressing too. Paul says, I have
[1:38:02] not apprehended
[1:38:04] He said, "I have not apprehended," Paul
[1:38:07] said, "but I'm pressing toward the
[1:38:12] mark of a high calling Christ." In this
[1:38:16] age, the bride supposed to hit the
[1:38:20] mark. All the could not hit the
[1:38:25] mark. The
[1:38:27] word of the word, they hit the mark.
[1:38:30] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen. But we
[1:38:32] have the revelation of the
[1:38:35] word to hit the mark of perfection.
[1:38:39] Not ours, but him in
[1:38:41] us, God in us.
[1:38:45] Listen, this is my beloved son in whom
[1:38:48] I'm well pleased.
[1:38:50] through Christ.
[1:38:54] Us dead to our own thoughts and
[1:38:58] ideas of the spirit of God,
[1:39:02] walking not after the
[1:39:04] theology, after the spirit inside of
[1:39:08] us. And let the dead in Christ walk
[1:39:13] not of the world.
[1:39:16] Let not let the dead in Christ not walk
[1:39:20] after the things of the world,
[1:39:26] but after the things of the spirit.
[1:39:29] Romans 8:1
[1:39:31] says there is therefore now no
[1:39:35] condemnation
[1:39:37] that them that are in Christ,
[1:39:40] that walk not after the
[1:39:43] flesh fightings
[1:39:48] strife,
[1:39:50] envying,
[1:39:52] selfish things.
[1:39:54] But after the spirit,
[1:39:58] if you're inside of Christ walking,
[1:40:02] all of the things of the world passes
[1:40:04] away. All the great creeds that you had
[1:40:07] of this
[1:40:09] thing, all the things is all vanish
[1:40:12] away. your heart and
[1:40:15] mind become a singular of Christ Jesus
[1:40:21] that shows you have died to
[1:40:24] yourself born again.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. Amen. Then just as sure as
[1:40:30] the church
[1:40:32] times. Here you go.
[1:40:36] Because I didn't know whether some of
[1:40:37] y'all came late because you had to or
[1:40:39] you need to or because you wanted to.
[1:40:44] then just as
[1:40:45] sure when church times
[1:40:48] come you just can't keep from coming to
[1:40:53] church you're just going to go if you
[1:40:56] have to
[1:40:59] hobble that's all you're going to church
[1:41:03] because the spirit itself bear
[1:41:05] record gathering together in Christ
[1:41:12] Hallelujah. Amen. In closing,
[1:41:16] the word ultimate
[1:41:20] means something that is the final
[1:41:25] means the highest, nothing above it or
[1:41:28] the most extreme in a series
[1:41:33] of
[1:41:34] progressions.
[1:41:36] In other words, I have reached the top
[1:41:39] of the
[1:41:41] pyramid. Absolute
[1:41:44] means total.
[1:41:46] Nothing else.
[1:41:48] This is it. Y'all understand me?
[1:41:52] Unlimited.
[1:41:54] Not limited or restricted in any terms
[1:41:58] of number,
[1:42:01] quantity or extent.
[1:42:05] Hallelujah. And don't tell me God don't
[1:42:07] look for the unlimited.
[1:42:12] Hallelujah.
[1:42:14] Yes, sir. Amen. He rebuked those
[1:42:17] disciples
[1:42:18] because they failed to calm the sea.
[1:42:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Is that all right?
[1:42:24] Amen. He even rebuked Mary Martha.
[1:42:29] You didn't pick it up. He says, "Did not
[1:42:32] I say
[1:42:34] if you believe, you shall see."
[1:42:38] God intend for us to go beyond.
[1:42:44] Stand in this earthly environment, this
[1:42:46] third dimension is just going to make
[1:42:48] you
[1:42:52] miserable. You're going to be just a
[1:42:56] fleshly. Amen. Let's stand. Amen.
[1:43:03] Amen.
[1:43:06] The Lord told me, "I'm preaching to the
[1:43:09] bride." That's all.
[1:43:11] The bride of Jesus Christ understands.
[1:43:16] That's what's happening. I'm preaching
[1:43:17] to the
[1:43:20] bride. And and I I even told the church
[1:43:23] in
[1:43:24] deaching to the bride.
[1:43:28] We're going to We're going to make
[1:43:30] it like this. We've already made it.
[1:43:34] But we still need to hear things
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:39] because by hearing it produces and give
[1:43:41] you more faith.
[1:43:44] Hallelujah. You got to recognize I
[1:43:47] cannot be lost.
[1:43:52] Didn't get too many of those. But you
[1:43:54] can't be
[1:43:56] You can't be lost.
[1:44:00] If you truly the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:44:01] you can't be lost.
[1:44:04] And I'm say it like this. Why believe
[1:44:06] anything else?
[1:44:12] Did Jesus go to the the the Pharisees?
[1:44:14] He never did.
[1:44:17] They came to him. Nicodemus.
[1:44:21] He went to the prostitutes.
[1:44:23] He went to the tax collectors.
[1:44:26] thieves and
[1:44:28] all. Why didn't God on the cross?
[1:44:33] Why didn't he he save a rich
[1:44:36] man? A man of prestige.
[1:44:41] Ain't nothing wrong with being rich and
[1:44:42] all. That ain't what I'm talking about.
[1:44:44] But I'm trying to show you the class of
[1:44:48] people that God comes after.
[1:44:53] You know, God will take those whom the
[1:44:56] devil has rejected.
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] Hallelujah. Amen. And I don't know about
[1:45:02] you, I I I am I am so free.
[1:45:08] And that's where God wants you to be
[1:45:10] free.
[1:45:14] So free.
[1:45:16] Yeah.
[1:45:18] I know some and I I gotta say what God
[1:45:21] want me to say. I
[1:45:24] can't. My point is somebody need to be
[1:45:27] free.
[1:45:30] You can't you can't let the devil keep
[1:45:31] beating you.
[1:45:35] I don't know how to forgive.
[1:45:38] Teach me, Lord.
[1:45:41] When you don't know how, ask him.
[1:45:45] You're ashamed of that.
[1:45:47] Hallelujah. Amen. Forgiveness
[1:45:52] is
[1:45:52] unlimit un unlimited.
[1:45:57] Seven times 70
[1:46:00] in a day.
[1:46:03] You got to keep and God put you to the
[1:46:06] test.
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:10] Love one another.
[1:46:13] know that this message came to pro
[1:46:15] perfection and this little suffering
[1:46:17] that we're going
[1:46:20] through people and y'all know it's true.
[1:46:24] Some of y'all may even have loved ones
[1:46:26] there in in in in the Congo in the east
[1:46:28] and how so many things are happening.
[1:46:35] Look at you.
[1:46:38] Do you think God got you here just to be
[1:46:41] enjoying life?
[1:46:45] intercessors.
[1:46:47] You should be you should be praying for
[1:46:49] those
[1:46:50] people that was you. Y'all understand
[1:46:54] me? Amen. What about Ukraine? How many
[1:46:56] of y'all had a
[1:46:58] a Ukraine? They might be white, but they
[1:47:01] still bride in there.
[1:47:04] I'm saying you're still you know how
[1:47:07] many brother said it like this so many
[1:47:11] times. Use Ezekiel.
[1:47:14] Heal those
[1:47:16] that sigh and cry.
[1:47:22] This ain't about caring just for you.
[1:47:25] Jesus so loved the
[1:47:29] world stand his whole life
[1:47:34] was father what would you have me do
[1:47:40] and we must be the same
[1:47:44] amen let's
[1:47:47] pray our heavenly father
[1:47:51] we come before you as humbly as we
[1:47:55] There are so many
[1:47:56] needs. Even in this little
[1:48:00] fellowship, anxieties,
[1:48:03] frustrations,
[1:48:05] anger,
[1:48:08] Lord, bitterness,
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:11] but I know you're able
[1:48:13] to clean us all up.
[1:48:18] I truly believe
[1:48:19] that we are your seed.
[1:48:23] But we all need
[1:48:26] quickening or or rebaptism.
[1:48:31] Lord, help us now
[1:48:33] that we would deny
[1:48:35] ourselves and focus on the
[1:48:38] work that you're doing within
[1:48:41] us, humbling
[1:48:44] ourselves to the inspiration of the Holy
[1:48:47] Spirit.
[1:48:49] Help us now because your word
[1:48:52] says we're more than
[1:48:55] conquerors through Christ Jesus and
[1:48:58] that's the only way we can
[1:49:01] conquer is through you Lord
[1:49:03] Jesus. Help us now Lord
[1:49:06] God. Keep
[1:49:08] us and guide us. forgive us of our not
[1:49:14] understanding time at
[1:49:16] times. But I know Lord if you can keep
[1:49:20] us
[1:49:22] focused to know that wherever we
[1:49:25] go whatever we do, you are the one
[1:49:29] that's leading
[1:49:30] us. You're the one that's guiding
[1:49:33] us because the footstep of the
[1:49:36] righteous is ordered by the
[1:49:38] Lord. Give us praise.
[1:49:41] Give us sacrifices and praise that we
[1:49:45] will always honor you
[1:49:47] so we come to that place of
[1:49:50] perfection. Bless this little group
[1:49:52] tonight or this
[1:49:54] morning. Help them now in Jesus Christ's
[1:49:57] name. Help
[1:49:59] them in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:50:03] pray. Amen.
[1:50:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:21] [Music]

[1:50:39] Upward
[1:50:41] way new head

[1:53:14] plane than I have
[1:53:18] found. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:53:23] high ground.
[1:53:35] Amen. We got one announcement
[1:53:44] for the majority of those who comes on
[1:53:46] Friday.
[1:53:51] uh we were just uh talking about the
[1:53:55] hour that we studying the meeting.
[1:54:00] So we wanted to change it from 8 to
[1:54:07] 7 so that we can have time to go back
[1:54:12] home because when we're studying at 8
[1:54:19] kids are sleeping and time is really
[1:54:22] gone.
[1:54:26] So we wanted to start on Friday to start
[1:54:29] at at seven.
[1:54:34] So we couldn't do it. We have to wait
[1:54:36] until today so that we can
[1:54:41] vote. If you really want that change, we
[1:54:44] can just vote for seven. Start at
[1:54:51] seven. So that we can have that meeting
[1:54:53] for 1 hour, 1 hour
[1:54:59] daily. So do we agree to study
[1:55:04] seven? If you agree, just raise your
[1:55:07] hand then.
[1:55:13] For those who agree with the time start
[1:55:16] at 7 on Friday.
[1:55:38] No, it's still even if you're not coming
[1:55:40] on Friday, but you're still going to
[1:55:41] vote. It's the church. This is the
[1:55:43] church vote. Even if you're not able to
[1:55:46] come on Friday, you still have a choice
[1:55:48] to
[1:55:50] go. Come
[1:55:55] again. So, who are not
[1:55:59] who don't agree to start on Friday.
[1:56:06] Those who don't want to start on at
[1:56:22] 7. Okay.
[1:56:25] But we've seen that the majority agreed
[1:56:27] to come at seven.
[1:56:31] The vote is not going to be 100%. So
[1:56:33] it's always maybe 70
[1:56:37] 80. So you got to join those who agree
[1:56:40] to come at
[1:56:41] seven. It's only
[1:56:47] you. So that's how the vote happened in
[1:56:49] the
[1:56:50] church.
[1:56:52] Was it only brother Gon? Who else? Who
[1:56:55] else doesn't want to come at
[1:56:59] seven? Okay. All right. So, brother come
[1:57:03] at seven.
