[22:21] [Music]
[22:38] is
[22:42] i just want to share with you
[22:45] the experience
[22:46] of that i had
[22:48] all along this month of november
[22:50] [Music]
[22:52] uh yeah
[23:20] this woman had a bad experience at the
[23:22] hospital the university of iowa
[23:28] but the god of william branham is real
[23:31] secular
[23:48] on the 26th of november they call me at
[23:50] the hospital
[23:57] i knew already what was going or what
[24:00] was wrong with the woman
[24:11] to fix your life with the lord and the
[24:13] lord can do something for him
[24:20] oh they told her that she's going to die
[24:22] on the 30th of november
[24:25] 116th
[24:27] 26th
[24:36] they called me from the hospital and say
[24:38] she gave us the number
[24:40] so that you can be
[24:41] in the hospital
[24:48] when i went there they asked me if i
[24:50] knew the woman i said yes
[24:56] i said
[24:57] they asked me the relationship with the
[24:59] woman i said i was her sister
[25:07] they asked me if she did share
[25:09] the information she had with me
[25:12] immortal
[25:16] and they asked me how am i feeling about
[25:18] those uh about the information she had
[25:22] just
[25:24] across
[25:25] the tandem
[25:26] two seconds
[25:31] and i told him that i'm a christian i
[25:33] believe in the message of the end time
[25:36] and she's also a christian everything
[25:38] that you've said we don't believe in
[25:39] that
[25:46] they say that they're gonna go they're
[25:48] gonna call other doctors because it was
[25:49] so serious
[25:58] and the doctor asked me if i knew about
[26:00] the situation in which
[26:02] the girl the woman was
[26:04] the way
[26:06] they said
[26:22] i told them that everything that you've
[26:24] said to her that she's going to die
[26:26] we're not going to do this operation so
[26:29] back in back home we don't say things
[26:31] like that to a person so we don't
[26:33] believe in everything that you said
[26:36] no
[26:46] and they say that she should be bleeding
[26:48] a lot because there's two operations
[26:49] that are going to do the second one it
[26:51] will be more difficult
[27:07] and ask them what danger do you see in
[27:10] that operation because when i look at
[27:12] her she's in good shape so how can you
[27:14] say that when we do the operation she's
[27:16] going to die
[27:17] zandi okay in first
[27:22] then they told me to sign to accept that
[27:25] they have told me that she's going to
[27:26] die when we do the operation
[27:31] like this
[27:38] then i say this is the second test that
[27:40] they're giving to me the first one was
[27:43] rapid and this is the second one to sign
[27:46] for something like this
[27:51] then i say i'm going to sign life and
[27:53] not death
[28:05] then they gave me many appointments on
[28:07] the same day they say we're gonna finish
[28:09] up with all those appointments because
[28:11] once you come back we're gonna go to
[28:12] this uh to the next step part
[28:24] to all those appointments
[28:27] after signing
[28:28] i asked them how do you feel about this
[28:30] they said no it's fine you can just sign
[28:31] so it's okay
[28:38] after all the appointment are done we
[28:41] went back to the
[28:42] to the doctor who's supposed to do the
[28:44] surgery
[29:03] then when we went back to the doctor
[29:05] supposed to do the surgery he
[29:07] he acted like he didn't know that he
[29:09] should do the surgery on that day he
[29:10] said no i'm not aware of that i'm not
[29:12] going to do anything if they're supposed
[29:15] to do the surgery there should be
[29:17] another doctor not me i can see that
[29:19] she's good shape she can continue like
[29:20] that
[29:35] then they say we have arranged
[29:37] everything for the surgery the doctor
[29:38] said no i'm not going to do it if if
[29:40] it's today i'm not going to do it she
[29:42] must come back on the 3rd
[29:50] we went back on the 3rd of december and
[30:03] they say you're not going to go back
[30:05] home she's going to stay at hospital
[30:09] [Music]
[30:21] then they say the the doctor
[30:23] misunderstood the program the surgery
[30:25] going to take place on tuesday
[30:32] prepared
[30:44] did i say we're not going to stay at the
[30:46] hospital because she's got children i
[30:48] have children too so who's going to take
[30:49] care of them we have to go back and
[30:51] arrange things then we're going to come
[30:53] back on tuesday
[31:02] then
[31:02] they start talking among themselves then
[31:05] they ask the woman how do you feel about
[31:07] this is it okay the woman said no it's
[31:09] not okay to be
[31:11] uh
[31:12] to pass through surgery today
[31:30] i told her that if
[31:32] you're supposed to believe if it's time
[31:34] to believe is this time you have to
[31:36] believe in jesus christ
[31:57] they've already told you that you're
[31:58] gonna die when they do the surgery and
[32:01] you rejected that that's fine so just
[32:03] take my faith then believe that you're
[32:05] not gonna die
[32:07] and you're not gonna die
[32:29] then when went back home i started
[32:31] praying then i remind to god that
[32:34] william branham said all the sicknesses
[32:37] are the demons but if we believe all
[32:39] those demons gonna be
[32:55] blood sugar is very high
[32:58] when we get there they say the blood
[33:00] sugar is high so
[33:07] much elendi then they start poking on
[33:10] their fingers
[33:11] from
[33:12] saturday up until sun monday
[33:20] and on
[33:22] tuesday it was around 7 00 p.m

[33:29] then
[33:30] when they see me they are they they say
[33:32] are you already here
[33:48] and on that monday we prayed all night
[33:50] with the woman
[33:59] and i was praying that god may assist
[34:02] the woman
[34:03] during the surgery in his own way
[34:17] then when we're praying i've seen like
[34:19] aeroplanes
[34:21] like helicopters like soldiers
[34:22] helicopters with those
[34:25] soldiers uniform
[34:27] and they were all around
[34:34] then i opened my eyes as we were praying
[34:37] so i wanted to see if she was praying or
[34:39] she was sleeping
[34:51] then i realized that we were still in
[34:52] the hospital the time we were praying
[34:54] and i understood that it was god was
[34:56] fighting for us
[35:06] then on tuesday morning they called us
[35:09] they gave us the garment
[35:11] for the surgery room then they say we

[35:43] holding my garment and say i believe in
[35:45] your faith i i'll take your faith and i

[46:15] you see and i know that we'll be
[46:17] returning back this direction

[46:28] while
[46:33] so i just want to say god bless you and
[46:35] uh let's go ahead and stand in honor
[46:42] and this morning i want to read from
[46:45] 2nd peter chapter 3.
[46:54] we're going to read the ninth verse
[46:56] through the 14th verse
[47:10] now this morning i want to speak a
[47:12] message called
[47:14] being eternally minded
[47:20] um
[47:37] so let's read here second peter chapter
[47:39] three we'll start with the ninth verse
[47:45] and it says the lord is
[47:47] not slack concerning his promises
[47:50] as some men count slackness
[47:52] but is longsuffering to us we're not
[47:55] willing that any should perish
[47:58] but that all should come to repentance
[48:24] but as the day of the lord will come as
[48:26] a thief in the night
[48:28] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[48:30] with a great noise and the elements
[48:32] shall melt with further heat the earth
[48:35] also and the works that are therein
[48:37] shall be burned up
[48:46] forecast
[48:54] now we'll stop here with verse 11 it
[48:56] says
[48:57] seeing then all these things shall be
[48:59] dissolved
[49:01] what manner of persons ought you to be
[49:03] in all holy conversation and godliness
[49:14] entertained
[49:27] we just come into your presence this
[49:29] morning
[49:32] knowing that you are the almighty
[49:34] all-powerful eternal god
[49:41] we didn't come here this morning out of
[49:43] tradition
[49:45] [Music]
[49:46] or by the commandment of man
[49:50] the lord we came here out of a desire to
[49:53] be in your presence
[49:58] knowing that many will be lukewarm in
[50:00] this age
[50:03] but lord you have called us to rise
[50:05] above that messenger
[50:09] you overcome those things
[50:16] [Music]
[50:24] and all things will be found faithful to
[50:26] you okay
[50:29] let it be
[50:30] known and let it be done unto us
[50:31] according to thy word
[50:35] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[50:38] this year
[50:50] to have our minds on eternal things
[51:02] that this world has fallen from the
[51:05] glory that god designed
[51:32] those things have fallen away and out of
[51:34] reach from this world
[51:40] but as a prophet in our day is come by
[51:43] our way
[51:47] and he began to open our minds to the
[51:49] things of eternity
[51:54] brother adam he said that see the things
[51:56] of eternity dip down into time
[52:02] it started way back in eden when the
[52:05] things of eternity came down into time
[52:13] a way of the crimson blood
[52:19] [Music]
[52:45] and it wrapped itself up into the day of
[52:48] jesus christ
[52:52] where jesus christ was the eternity of
[52:55] god coming down into time
[53:10] when he opened his mouth to speak
[53:11] impossible things took
[53:26] every time
[53:40] and everything jesus does is
[53:42] supernatural
[53:46] because jesus is the ones that created
[53:49] the natural laws of the universe
[54:07] everything that he does is supernatural
[54:19] and you when you catch that revelation
[54:21] allah
[54:35] that is not the time that you
[54:45] that you are a part of god from back
[54:47] before the foundations
[55:04] he began to talk about what perfect
[55:06] faith was
[55:11] and he said
[55:12] he said see the greatest part of our
[55:15] faith is just mental faith
[55:33] see that sounds pretty good to our minds
[55:39] but when you begin to give yourself over
[55:42] to the word of god
[55:46] that the supernatural presence of the
[55:48] lord jesus christ comes on the scene
[55:54] the power of the holy ghost begins to
[55:56] come into the room
[56:00] and as you have been storing up this
[56:02] mental faith in your mind
[56:08] and as you have the word of god in your
[56:10] in your natural memory
[56:14] that the spirit of god begins to move
[56:16] across those things in your memory
[56:22] and that faith begins to sink down into
[56:24] your heart
[56:28] a supernatural faith a perfect faith
[56:34] and your mental faith begins to give
[56:36] birth well i won't say gives birth
[56:42] but that perfect faith begins to get
[56:44] revealed on the inside of you
[56:50] it's because you were born from eternity
[56:56] that supernatural faith
[56:58] is your inheritance
[57:02] it's it's laying buried there
[57:07] it's buried in as paul said in an
[57:09] earthen vessel
[57:33] [Music]
[57:49] and then the eternal faith begins to
[57:52] become revealed in your life
[57:57] now you who in your flesh were just
[58:00] animal beings
[58:05] god took the body of an animal the
[58:07] highest order of the animals
[58:13] and he placed his own spirit inside of
[58:15] there
[58:18] his own nature inside of there it's a
[58:19] proponent of
[59:16] a an ability to to reject the animal
[59:20] side of our being
[59:26] and to look up higher and to accept our
[59:28] positions
[59:43] he came to this earth and was given
[59:58] and receive the way of his father
[1:00:03] amen he was not born of the earth
[1:00:07] he said i was born of the heavens
[1:00:11] and every being on this earth
[1:00:40] but the seed of god that dwells on the
[1:00:42] inside
[1:00:45] because one of these days in a moment in
[1:00:47] a twinkling of an eye
[1:00:49] this is you on england
[1:00:51] that this fleshly body will give away
[1:00:53] second
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:01:22] and has become eternally minded
[1:01:27] brother branham said
[1:01:30] the spiritual revelation
[1:01:34] is of more importance than you can
[1:01:49] importance of spiritual revelations
[1:02:17] upon this rock i'll
[1:02:47] and he began to reject everything to his
[1:02:49] mental conception
[1:02:54] and gave himself over to what his
[1:02:56] eternal mind
[1:03:14] but jesus had come from the father
[1:03:18] i was going back to the father
[1:03:21] and so peter looked at jesus
[1:03:24] it says thou art the christ
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] the son of the
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:56] to me
[1:03:59] but the father has been speaking to you
[1:04:06] who are the son of man
[1:04:10] it
[1:04:31] when we like jesus christ when we begin
[1:04:33] to shake ourselves away from the
[1:04:35] foolishness of this world
[1:04:37] simone
[1:04:50] and all the the distractions of this
[1:04:53] totally distraction
[1:04:56] and lay them off to the side
[1:05:00] let's say i am going to focus on my lord
[1:05:06] you remember the time when jesus went to
[1:05:08] marry martha's house
[1:05:14] and he was going over there for lunch
[1:05:19] and mary martha they wanted him to have
[1:05:22] a good lunch mariam
[1:05:27] martha was worried
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:32] she was worried that things weren't
[1:05:34] prepared like they ought to be for
[1:05:36] jesus to come and have dinner with him
[1:05:47] and when jesus came knocking on the door
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:53] mary went and answered the door
[1:05:58] martha stayed busy in the kitchen
[1:06:03] and as jesus sat down in the living room
[1:06:10] mary begin to sit down there with him
[1:06:12] begin to ask him questions
[1:06:16] is
[1:06:28] but spiritual revelation began to take
[1:06:31] place in the room
[1:06:35] and they began to have a divine
[1:06:37] fellowship
[1:06:42] between christ and his bride
[1:06:46] because she was a part of the bride of
[1:06:48] christ
[1:06:52] and martha was busy there in the kitchen
[1:06:56] and she was worried that they had more
[1:06:59] to do and the dinner wouldn't be done on
[1:07:00] time
[1:07:07] she finally came into the living room
[1:07:12] and she began to interrupt that divine
[1:07:14] fellowship
[1:07:21] and matt she said master don't you care
[1:07:28] we have all this work to do and mary is
[1:07:31] not helping out okay
[1:07:37] and jesus looked over at martha yes
[1:08:09] mary has chosen the best things
[1:08:15] and this moment will not be taken away
[1:08:18] from her
[1:08:22] this this moment of divine fellowship
[1:08:25] will not be stolen
[1:08:30] she had chosen the best things
[1:08:34] you know we all have those times in our
[1:08:36] lives where we have to make that choice
[1:08:42] think about a church service
[1:08:44] or service
[1:08:46] we
[1:08:47] some can sit here in peace at their pew
[1:08:50] oh
[1:09:17] and even here in a church service you
[1:09:20] see ma'am down the service so i used to
[1:09:22] attend to preach in the gospel
[1:09:26] but despite the various duties that we
[1:09:29] all have in the church of god malgrey
[1:09:31] two seconds come to our father
[1:09:47] to to let our spiritual lives go down
[1:09:51] towards the animal side the
[1:09:53] lesser knowledge
[1:09:56] animal and to not be eternally minded
[1:10:26] but there has to be a dedication in our
[1:10:28] minds
[1:10:41] that will not allow those distractions
[1:11:18] i believe it took place there in uh
[1:11:20] shreveport
[1:11:21] japan shreveport
[1:11:27] and as he is preaching he began to
[1:11:30] talk about a vision you can tell bandai
[1:11:36] because he's just preaching and all
[1:11:38] suddenly says those
[1:11:53] and when he begins to say something like
[1:11:54] i can see hey
[1:11:58] you have to know that he's not just
[1:12:00] speaking
[1:12:04] but he began to break into eternity
[1:12:18] the word of god being our absolutely
[1:12:35] and he is our typos
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:47] and nothing can take us away from
[1:13:01] i can see eternity break and come down
[1:13:04] into time
[1:13:09] ever since eden
[1:13:14] he says and when it did it there came a
[1:13:16] line
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:55] but they were just being obedient to
[1:13:57] what moses said
[1:14:40] from calvary up to jesus upon the cross
[1:14:46] jesus
[1:14:51] that that bloodline was tied
[1:14:54] to jesus christ
[1:14:59] or let me say a little bit better that
[1:15:01] jesus christ was the typos the bloodline
[1:15:03] was tied to
[1:15:05] uh
[1:15:45] as jesus was resurrected was walking
[1:15:47] around
[1:16:04] the thai post rose up into the heavens
[1:16:08] television
[1:16:09] and the old testament saints went up in
[1:16:11] the old testament
[1:16:18] i hope
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:17:17] and someday when he comes to claim his
[1:17:20] own angel
[1:17:25] everyone that's tied to that ultimate
[1:17:46] they have been in eternity
[1:17:48] all the time
[1:17:52] so we're not animals after all i don't
[1:17:54] need some parties anymore anyway
[1:17:56] we ought to be eternally minded
[1:18:00] let our mind get away from these walls
[1:18:05] and the things that around us
[1:18:08] the responsibilities of this life
[1:18:23] he said they were predestinated
[1:18:37] and he says and when that big rope
[1:19:03] will be dropped right up into eternity
[1:19:05] again
[1:19:21] we have an opportunity
[1:19:23] opportunity to right now be seated with
[1:19:26] him in his throne
[1:19:29] but when you reject the things of this
[1:19:32] world
[1:20:02] and be transformed
[1:20:14] a perfect revelation of the lord jesus
[1:20:16] christ
[1:20:59] that's who brother bran and what
[1:21:02] that's who we are to be here yes
[1:21:07] our responsibilities on this earth that
[1:21:09] distract us
[1:21:11] from the responsibility
[1:21:22] to sit at the feet of jesus
[1:21:25] christ
[1:21:37] he preached a message called
[1:21:40] a man running from the presence of the
[1:21:42] lord from appreciate a message
[1:21:48] he was speaking about jonah
[1:21:51] jonas
[1:21:55] let's turn over to the book of jonah um
[1:22:04] i can see brother bran i'm coming up
[1:22:06] with the revelation for this message
[1:22:35] and he went down to joppa to find a ship
[1:22:37] going to tarshish
[1:22:43] and it says and he paid the fare thereof
[1:22:46] and went down into it to go with him
[1:22:49] into tarshish
[1:22:50] from the
[1:23:04] he began to give the drama of it
[1:23:11] about how jonah was
[1:23:13] commissioned by god to go down to the
[1:23:15] gentiles
[1:23:30] he wasn't being eternally minded
[1:23:39] you know i think every one of us has
[1:23:41] been in those situations
[1:23:45] where the word of god says this
[1:23:49] but we have going to go and do that
[1:23:52] direction
[1:23:54] and as
[1:23:55] the bi or the book of joy there says in
[1:23:57] multiple places
[1:24:09] and he went and he paid the price to go
[1:24:11] into this ship
[1:24:15] as the ship went out into the sea uh
[1:24:20] god caused a storm to come by that way
[1:24:25] as the waves begin to get worse and
[1:24:27] worse
[1:24:41] the waves and then go
[1:24:49] i was
[1:24:50] had an opportunity to go on a sales ship
[1:24:52] in lake michigan a while ago jail
[1:24:54] opportunities
[1:24:59] it's one of those old-fashioned ships
[1:25:01] with all the sails on it about
[1:25:03] 10 different sails
[1:25:10] looked like what they would call a
[1:25:11] pirate ship
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:19] and when we got out where you couldn't
[1:25:21] see land anymore
[1:25:38] the waves were bigger than our boat
[1:25:44] and i didn't think they could have waves
[1:25:46] that big on lake michigan
[1:25:51] and our boat just seemed like that boat
[1:25:54] would be going up for several seconds
[1:26:01] and then when it got to the top of the
[1:26:02] wave it started going down
[1:26:13] and it was
[1:26:14] a little discomforting
[1:26:18] and comfortable
[1:26:22] and
[1:26:23] we were like that for quite a while
[1:26:28] i can't imagine what jonah was and
[1:26:31] everybody was feeling in this boat
[1:26:49] they began to realize that that there
[1:26:51] there was probably no hope for them
[1:26:56] they got to the point they did
[1:26:58] everything they knew how to do it
[1:27:02] and
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:29] everyone cry out to the god
[1:27:43] that maybe one of these gods
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:28:12] that you serve
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:24] did
[1:28:37] because someone on this boat has done
[1:28:39] something wrong
[1:28:44] so i said let's cast slots and find out
[1:28:46] who that is
[1:28:51] as they begin to cast the lots the lot
[1:28:54] fell to jonah
[1:29:23] and i am running away from his presence
[1:29:28] and they said until why would you do
[1:29:30] this
[1:29:33] you have risked all of our lives
[1:30:32] and they threw him into the sea
[1:30:35] and then they began to pray unto jehovah
[1:30:39] uh
[1:30:40] jehovah forgive us
[1:30:44] we don't know what else to do
[1:30:59] jonah had been running
[1:31:14] throw me
[1:31:28] into those stormy waters bound up hand
[1:31:31] and foot
[1:31:38] only the will of god can save him
[1:31:57] son of god
[1:32:01] and as a predestinated son of god thank
[1:32:04] you fish did you predict
[1:32:05] no matter how hard you try to get out of
[1:32:08] the will of god
[1:32:40] he said jonah paid the price to get into
[1:32:43] that ship
[1:32:49] jonah paid the fare to go in his own
[1:32:51] will
[1:33:32] just throw yourself back into the will
[1:33:34] of god
[1:33:48] you've
[1:34:01] you need to stop
[1:34:18] you are so busy and worried about so
[1:34:20] many earthly things
[1:34:25] but your sister mary has chosen the best
[1:34:28] things
[1:34:57] you're always focusing on natural things
[1:35:00] instead of supernatural
[1:35:05] spirituality after a while church
[1:35:07] becomes a big boring to you
[1:35:26] when church becomes becoming tiring too
[1:35:31] if you don't want to read your bible or
[1:35:33] pray anymore
[1:35:37] you're a lukewarm and you need a revival
[1:35:39] definitely from my tears
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:54] there's other scriptures that said there
[1:35:55] will be some that is on fire for god
[1:36:01] that they be overcomers in the laodicean
[1:36:04] age
[1:36:07] those are the scriptures we came
[1:36:36] and that's where you belong
[1:36:41] and he's already paid for the price
[1:36:49] hey man in closing
[1:36:51] let's turn over to isaiah 26. lisander
[1:36:54] is
[1:37:10] isaiah 26
[1:37:12] verse 3.
[1:37:24] verse 1 it says in that day shall this
[1:37:27] song be sung in the land of judah saying
[1:37:30] we have a strong city salvation will god
[1:37:33] a point for walls and bulwarks
[1:37:46] salute
[1:37:51] the gates that the righteous city which
[1:37:53] keepeth the truth may enter in
[1:37:59] just a fidel
[1:38:14] that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:38:17] whose mind is stayed on thee
[1:38:19] because he trusteth the need
[1:38:28] for
[1:38:40] do you know who your provider is
[1:39:10] we got to be one or the other whatever
[1:39:13] land does it do but i
[1:39:15] there's something inside of me that
[1:39:16] rises up
[1:39:20] it says i didn't come here to be a
[1:39:21] lukewarm christian
[1:39:24] supervision
[1:39:27] but every single thing that brother
[1:39:29] branham prophesied for the bride of
[1:39:31] christ
[1:39:34] i have come to fulfill that practice
[1:39:37] a complete prophecy amen amen it's our
[1:39:40] inheritance
[1:39:42] it belongs to us
[1:39:44] amen and he'll keep you in perfect peace
[1:39:48] when you keep your mind on him
[1:40:20] it's when you break into eternity
[1:40:25] you can have things wrong in your life
[1:40:27] for a long time
[1:40:31] and not even know it it is a memphis
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:41:05] that realization comes when you're in
[1:41:07] his presence
[1:41:11] if you haven't prayed for a long
[1:41:17] and all of a time you
[1:41:20] go and pray on your knees for an hour
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:27] you begin to ponder on your life
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:43] oh

[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:21] because that's how we get back to him
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:26] if we prayed more often
[1:43:30] pray daily like we ought to
[1:43:32] come to the devil
[1:43:34] then you wouldn't have those things that
[1:43:35] are wrong stacking
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:48] but those things will be taken care of
[1:43:50] constantly
