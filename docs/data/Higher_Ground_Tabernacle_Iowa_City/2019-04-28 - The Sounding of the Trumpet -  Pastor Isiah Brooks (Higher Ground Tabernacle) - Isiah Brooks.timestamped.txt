[2:22:56] it's my sister someone was telling me
[2:23:01] that they felt the hand of the Lord in a
[2:23:06] service recently not here but they were
[2:23:11] afraid to move and when they did look
[2:23:17] there was no one I remember the time
[2:23:23] when my wife was praying and she thought
[2:23:25] a sister had knelt down and this
[2:23:29] happened in tomorrow
[2:23:30] [Music]
[2:23:32] in that same service I was preaching and
[2:23:36] I went to run here and I bumped into
[2:23:38] someone he was invisible to me he was
[2:23:43] there see nobody can tell me he ain't

[2:24:02] brother Brooks do you make mistake yes
[2:24:05] there are things Amen you know that I
[2:24:08] need God to deliver me from see some of
[2:24:13] y'all wouldn't admit them but it's true
[2:24:16] you know me thing about it is I don't
[2:24:21] worry about
[2:24:23] because he makes all things beautiful in
[2:24:26] his time I believe when I get before God
[2:24:31] and I ask God to do something for me
[2:24:33] and ask him to do it in his name at that
[2:24:37] moment it is done that right because the
[2:24:42] Bible says that if those those who have
[2:24:45] a will in mind God counted done just
[2:24:51] what the willing mind is already done I
[2:24:53] may not have may not see it right then
[2:24:56] but in the mind of God because I wanted
[2:24:59] to be delivered deliverance has already
[2:25:02] come if you really want it gotta give it
[2:25:08] to you until the man get really
[2:25:12] desperate because you got to understand

[2:25:50] gotta be desperate enough to
[2:25:56] don't be a shame so many people you know
