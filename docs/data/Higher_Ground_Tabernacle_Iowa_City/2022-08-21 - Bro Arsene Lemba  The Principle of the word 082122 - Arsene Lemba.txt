about this subject because i've seen the consequences of it come on the benefit of it like they say the benefit of it the calculations it's an inspiration that came to me it is more than 15 years now a more men and myself because the word of god is a song it doesn't come a marketing class that i took on africa in south africa these are the things that are required but they talk about it and a lot of things the word perseverance and i said that's the word amen amen just revisition then i follow those requests from the teachers this kind of science they are the the the messages of the teachers this is the word of god then when i went back to the word of god by the jews he said they're not talking about they can't move away sometimes they see the thing that are they are signing up it's the word of god then i went back in the world a great blessing for people of god amen amen or many people can forget about my preachings malaysia will bless your messenger but they never remember even 15 years later you're going to remind me about that preaching [Music] the principle of the word of god represented you the principle of god said about the sacraments i brought this box i couldn't bring

he goes to facebook but he spent two thousand dollars just for those three matches because with his little heads up he think it's so important he is thinking to become more important by having this form of we gotta change the way we see things hallelujah he found a great a big book like this upon the machine and he threw it away because he doesn't know he doesn't know the use of that book amen that's in nature the bible is telling us the word of god is stealing us the natural typifies the spiritual ones and people have asked the lord jesus christ you always speak to us in parables hallelujah you only speak to us in parables excuse me listen and the lord jesus christ told them if you can't understand the natural things come out for life how would you understand the spiritual

god is a slave of his own word you keep a good mental attitude to his word the way you consider his words in our house people from the message because you're not a visitor when i'm coming to visit you for example mama let's take my mom do you have a brochure somewhere of the message of the the preaching books where did you place it the particular to defend yourself now they start accusing the the little one who can never even dispense you have examined no he had this right this uh the preaching book the practice that's a good experience we start searching for the for the bible on sunday

transmitter they let you i'm not just reading you this transmitter but i'm telling you things that i've lived myself hallelujah amen if i have to go deep i'm not going to finish it amen amen that is the way you take his promise they set money like your vote is a promise you play you place it in your heart you who bless us that means for me and i'm going to keep it there hallelujah don't everyday see if that not even the subject select the main politician just keep on believing vocationally acquire god will make it come to pass for it is a seed go back to the instruction book and read come look lonely i love to read after him hallelujah because he never made one mistake fascinating [Music] everything he done was perfectly in harmony with god it's a perfect manner hallelujah oh how much time that we waste here as we leisure but you never found jesus at no time hallelujah do you remember god himself you'll never find him pleasuring around like that every move every pleasure everything

i am well pleased everything was perfectly [Music] his entire life was just the word of god hallelujah by the destruction of the south there wasn't any destruction or any event every word that he was speaking was giving glory to god and the lord and the lord himself delight in him hallelujah amen and he could say to the world make his education who can condemn me of sin hallelujah amen persecuted eat something because all his life separated his words was confirming to the word of god amen amen listen to this community so as we're saying it is man to parallel and parallelism we want to do the parallelism uh parallelism [Music] because we read in the bible do you have faith foreign god raised his son upon the evil and the right ones and make his reign fall upon the right and the right and the evil ones the judge which means the son of god the reign of god falls on everybody everybody get the benefit of the reign of god the power of careful utilization and it depends how you're using it counting it when it's raining same watch you and you just fold your arms do you need the people or maybe you're reading the bible while there's no water in your house while the rain is falling after the rain and eye the evil ones i will go back in the house with my water preparing myself i will cook i oh you're not gonna drink because you've got no water do you understand something why is it like that you pray you're pretending to have something but you're not going but you don't know the principle of that fidel but the uh uh unbelieved ones no problem he doesn't have the instruction book that you have not been able to get here it is never the privilege that you have hallelujah and bring it in my in the books or in the in the pages of the book the question is i think in ecclesiastes 6. the bible is telling you hallelujah never sleep too much perhaps again because the poverty gonna surprise you yes no i gotta sleep man i can't sleep it's raining out i'll have to sleep nicely oh yeah you wake up at 11 a.m oh yeah or here they give the job to everybody hallelujah amen the problem that's a problem thank you the crowd of wonder shows those who declare to have the right thing may never continue to unveil ourselves their attitude to what they think they have nothing separately we've got this parallel uh i'll put one on one side spiritual the spiritual man on the side the creature the christian that we are and on the other side i will speak about the natural man who's doing things according to the science the bible hallelujah and the science look for you on this side we've got instruction in the book and on the other side he's cheating from this instruction and put it on his own manufacturer he cheated from the laws of god that he found in the world are we yes unobstructed just by observing how things are going around he spent more time on that to the spiritual man in paper can you send me a developer prayer he can't even stand five minutes in prayer god damn it jesus will be done in a glitch just keep him longer in the church you will see how he started around his eyes we're not getting a lot of benefit because of our attitude if you're himself that's a man you just don't have the that you're not even close to that guard let them let them out can you do that this sunday to deliver keller you only come to some people you only come here what time is here what time do you wake up for that for the service revolution let's be revolutionary we're not going to get enough benefit of that attitude because of our mental attitude toward the things of god we are just there for the little things that we're getting out there hallelujah amen we are there living in the little things under the privilege you got a machine that cost two thousand dollars you only use maybe one percent hallelujah amen he will never spare one person that accepts you there's no exception there's [Music] is telling us this know someone we are busy comparing those two things there was this man called franklin amen amen franklin franklin he was somewhere with a uh with a flying object there was a there was a striking lightning somewhere he heard something invincible in his hand then he looked and observed the rope that was holding the flying object here it was wet a lot he fell electric or he was uh shocked somewhere electricity there wasn't electricity nobody knew electricity and he felt electricity in his hand [Music] he felt a shock in his head and said there's something invisible somewhere which is in connection of what i've seen listen yes he start searching for those things one by one he start collecting the wires just to feel the same shock amen amen a friend of mine and branham's telling us he said god don't need an electricity wanted to give electricity he found somebody who was available for that hallelujah amen he didn't go to any christian who was praying anyhow but he found somebody was able to catch the thing that's the sacrifice to sacrifice himself to give a lot of time to the things because he knew that he was going to take a long time back from claire with franklin lynn god was fixing to give electricity to the world electricity he found franklin oh thomas here in america then he looked to the invention of franklin satisfied he wasn't totally satisfied he didn't go to destroy franklin but he said i have to develop what franklin brought oh creation oh christian your brother did something good patterns don't just destroy him negatively never destroy your brother amen develop the thing from destiny if you want to make it better benefit your god but the body can help until he found the light and he gave it to the world hallelujah amen a normal a man scientific a scientific man not to that natural manner but god of sins he was available and god so that i can read my problem turn on the light and see your world that you're working on hallelujah amen let's manifesto may all burn our seats but we also talking spiritually of the spiritual astronauts who's that astronaut spiritual astronauts can say that's not what is he doing what [Music] upon the just an unjust the sound that rise upon the justice level so what a wicked people are doing with the son of god they are feeding you every day so what are you doing with the same song you don't even have enough time to pray for your own family [Music] may god help us amen

they've got more perseverance than what we have independent they can brave so many dangers that we cannot hallelujah amen scientific people scientifically i can prove it to you amen amen 1955. yeah paragraph 20. this afternoon i was about to speak of second coming of the lord jesus christ maybe i will do it later on tuesday or monday or tuesday hallelujah because by speaking on this subject of a second coming hallelujah amen it was to prove that the scientific world questions that i can take the scriptures and the science generation and prove that this declaration [Music] the age in which we live according to my understanding from the science side to prove that today because that's what this sunday practice i'm not making about the second coming year but i'm getting all the science evidence second coming of the lord jesus christ it's for this age it a second amen you catch something from there don't listen to this young science people they'll never protect from their side they've got help they've got elements that are proving can i second if i need to change that the second coming of the lord is hallelujah he's taking the scriptures and the science too down put them together and to prove to the world that the kind of thing is for this age amen hallelujah amen i'm just like uh making a platform for this preaching hallelujah like i said i'm not in hurry [Music] pastor brooks said after a year oh come and preach i will come back to this because today is just a foundation that i'm laying down but it's giving a sense to what i'm saying amen amen approaching the

prophets [Music] it means how this uh time is formed the one who's reading one of this storm because they've started upon this all their entire life i by the help of some instrument or some equipment that the signs have given to them um don't kill direction here is by proving which direction the wind is going to tip what kind of wind is coming from which direction other other storm is coming from then they know how they can fight it and push it away amen amen they consecrated by studying the weather they come from continued anytime they predict the daily predict you will see it coming did they create something they just started they ruined that they started the national laws how god have placed these laws in the world spoken [Music] but that grace is to walk together with the word of god
