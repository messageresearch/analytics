showing the difference between the righteous and the wicked you see Jim Otte Latifah hands on delicious to a in a mission let me tell you living righteously pays off living righteously pays back these was just a muscle of babes in love who talking issues amen man so when God begins to listen to the cry of the people he says I will I will I know verse 7 he says I was drawn not my eyes from the righteous well they said the beacon if somebody doing this oh my god and then verse 8 he says and if they talk about the righteous if they be bound in fetters and holding in cords of affliction he

back to deliverance ask yourself what anyway so that all the people in the world may know that God will deliver his people who don't want a limb won't be some what did you believe in a man but it as it goes on down here further in the chapter in verse 12 it says that if they obey not they shall perish by the sword you can see the way he spoke as it loses even believe on me they shall die without knowledge he won't move heal some innocence he says but the hypocrites and heart heap up wrath and they cry not when he binded them many policemen a verse 13 verse verse it is there's a be silly broccoli in a key part you until is on Shannon my so what the here it is so the people that say that they are Christians on Alicia Keys Keystone good yeah but they will not repent taking us in a funk they will not live according to the Word of God you know people said oh no God Himself will begin to bind them amen amen they'll be bound by their own sins he's a holy mission and the thing the worst

Jonah's life hello carmella Kineo said you know just as Savannah did not pay a menace so asses God began to remember the calling that he gave to Jonah and Camille says we need a liability on us that God began to speak to that well I know my family I said sit bilenda and told that fish go spit Jonah up along the shore by a long-overdue me I said Balon that would be Amazon so he can go back and fulfill the calling I have upon his life every single one of us God has a calling upon your life - I can't they knew jr. and abandoned with a V I don't care who you are get your so I think it was it there if you've gathered together yourself in this building see who's into my someplace you don't see me being God this morning as already when you came to that door do so my thought you see the shock on who's on the Holy Spirit began to search your heart let's set this me up on myself so you know he does that every time you come to church you can fish it let's check forgive analogies when you came into that door no Holy Spirit began brooding over this people who said he began to brood over your heart to look at a man as he began to examine the condition of your heart it begins to look to see if you're crying out to God or not for massage it wasyouwho created a man and how God responds to you equal my opponent will be according to the cry of your heart suppose you see how I'm functioning what Nicky now many people when they come to church communities they'll walk into that door with a hardened heart you see and they become bound to their hardness and you saw me not you I said and so when they come in they cannot cry out to God and I choose not to see their pavement but he will say because their heart has become hardened plus a little girl sits it and you see so as they walk in that door the Holy Spirit is brooding over the audience me he's a hardened heart that will not cry out to him and you know what a good under seeking a poopa day he just passes that person live in the process at their son they missed their chance their day of visitation but then there will be someone sitting right next to them who has a burden upon their heart he yeah yeah those shoes yeah they have something something that's just bothering them and they're crying out to God in and I say Oh Lord he's also yeah your word says this this is he Lord you're calling upon my life said this your word said to go this way your body your words said that I should be healed so the whole Deaconess in a gimme your word said I should be delivered not because you said anything but here I'm back in church again maybe what's younger than he where's my deliverance my feeling was that you and that pin that heart begins to cry out to the Lord I don't go sickle my psyche of the Holy Spirit of God will pass over the person with a hardened heart and let's set this move up I said I personally given you and go and begin to listen to the cry of the honest heart appear that I pass on the key on a key key key anything yeah but his response to that cry missing a bull's eye think we will be to go back and look at the calling that's upon your life Sarah daddy who are lemansky will be an appeal kid about okay and of course ever once called you an Oct visage was that was a plateful then God still expects you to come back into compliance to that calling I love just I thought usually who shall have a nearly a complete set up an amen and so when you begin to cry out to him his first pots is not to solve your problems Haruka Misaki a very sorry poison a past my problem but his response is to bring you back to the calling and a promise necessary pose a definitively so napela blossom who lets turn a Romans chapter eight lives on the homeopathy Romans chapter 8 or mention of people we will read
