[36:36] ecclesiastes chapter 12.
[36:46] we read verse 1 and verse 2 then we'll
[36:48] jump to verse 13 and verse 14.
[36:59] ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1 and 2
[37:02] then verse 13 verse 14.
[37:16] ecclesiastes right after progressions
[37:33] 12 1 the bible says remember now thy
[37:36] creator in the days of the youth
[37:39] while the evil days come not
[37:41] nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt
[37:44] say i have no pleasure in them verse 2
[37:48] while the sun and the light or the light
[37:51] or the moon or the stars be not darkened
[37:54] nor the clouds return the rain
[38:00] [Music]
[38:35] verse 13 the bible said let us hear the
[38:37] conclusion of the whole matter fear god
[38:40] and keep his commandments for
[38:43] this is the whole duty of man for god
[38:46] shall bring every work into judgment
[38:48] with every secret thing whether it be
[38:51] good or whether be evil
[39:25] 12 13.
[39:32] it's a little bit different than the
[39:34] english version
[39:39] the last two the last two verses of the
[39:41] chapter
[39:43] that's it okay my bad it's uh it sounded
[39:46] different than the english version i'm
[39:48] saying
[39:50] that that's one thing okay
[39:55] all right
[39:57] okay it's the first 15 15 in french is
[40:00] best 15. oh okay
[40:03] yeah i was i was confused for i was like
[40:06] what
[40:07] okay
[40:08] let's go
[40:09] let's go to romans chapter 12 we read
[40:11] verse one and two
[40:13] uh
[40:15] ain't doing
[40:25] romans chapter 12 verse one and two it's
[40:27] a familiar verse
[40:29] uh chapter and verse that
[40:31] most of us do know and uh
[40:40] the bible says i beseech you therefore
[40:42] brethren by the mercies of god that you
[40:45] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[40:48] holy acceptable under god which is your
[40:50] reasonable service
[40:53] and be not confirmed to this world
[40:56] but be transformed
[40:58] by the renewing of your mind that ye may
[41:01] prove what is that good and acceptable
[41:04] and perfect
[41:20] [Music]
[41:37] amen i'll repeat the verse two the bible
[41:39] says and be not conformed
[41:42] to this world by being transformed by
[41:45] the renewing of your mind that you may
[41:48] prove what is that good
[41:50] and acceptable and perfect
[42:00] i thank
[42:38] this morning or this afternoon because
[42:41] it's almost 12.
[42:43] [Music]
[42:53] transforming versus conforming
[42:57] transforming versus conforming
[43:05] okay because i i took my uh inspiration
[43:08] in romans chapter 12 verse two paul was
[43:11] telling the saints
[43:13] not to be conformed to this world but to
[43:16] be transformed
[43:24] foreign
[43:35] so according to google to confirm means
[43:38] to act in accordance with expectations
[43:43] [Music]
[43:47] expectative to behave in a murder of
[43:50] others
[43:51] [Music]
[43:53] dean manier community
[43:55] especially as a result of the social of
[43:58] social oppression especially
[44:02] so in other words is to be influenced by
[44:05] other people a lot of them
[44:19] that's what conforming means
[44:47] means to change greatly the appearance
[44:51] of changing
[44:54] chances
[44:55] to change in nature
[44:58] to changing hearts
[45:01] character changes
[45:27] and every night every night all those
[45:30] you know his friends and his fellow
[45:32] classmates was going out to partying
[45:39] but that young man was different than
[45:41] the others
[45:43] because every night when the sun was
[45:45] going down
[45:48] he was going on the top of the mountain
[45:54] so there were this old man who knows
[45:56] that you know every every time that he
[45:58] was doing the same thing
[46:05] and one day he asked him but why you
[46:07] know why don't you go and party with the
[46:09] others
[46:24] and there there is a country a aeolc
[46:28] and in that country there's a city
[46:32] and in that city there's a house
[46:35] and in that house there's a woman
[46:39] farm that i promised that i will come
[46:41] back
[46:44] so every time that i look over there
[46:49] there is a connection between between us
[46:54] that makes me remember of the promise
[46:56] that i made
[46:58] uh souvenirs
[47:00] that is the reason why it's keeping me
[47:02] to be confirmed to those people
[47:08] that's why i don't
[47:44] [Music]
[48:01] she refused to behave like others
[48:18] the prince who is
[48:28] that's why paul says that we don't have
[48:30] to confirm we don't we you know we not
[48:33] we want uh uh
[48:34] that that's what paul asked her not to
[48:36] be confirmed to this
[48:38] demand
[48:41] to be transformed
[48:43] transforming amen to be transformed and
[48:45] to look like jesus
[48:49] amen the more we hear the word the more
[48:51] we become like
[48:55] the more the time is going with the time
[48:57] is passing the more close to the closer
[48:59] we get to
[49:16] everything in us has to be changed
[49:20] everything in us has to be changed
[49:26] you'll see that transforming means also
[49:33] amen to convert doesn't mean that you
[49:35] leave a catholic church and then you
[49:37] join the message
[49:41] that's not that's not being converted
[49:43] it's an impossible conversation it
[49:45] doesn't mean that you leave this church
[49:47] and you join the other churches
[49:52] it doesn't mean that you renounce this
[49:53] religion and then you you become a part
[49:55] of it
[49:58] [Music]
[50:11] uh uh luke 22 verse 32.
[50:20] you see here jesus is talking to peter
[50:23] you see jesus yeah
[50:25] and this is
[50:26] almost about when when jesus was about
[50:29] to uh to be crucified
[50:34] meaning that at this time
[50:39] peter has done miracles
[50:42] peter prayed for i mean peter prayed for
[50:45] prayed for people and the god that was
[50:47] they were healed
[50:50] he meant peter was was was uh one of the
[50:54] elders of jesus christ's essence
[50:59] but if you hear hear when jesus was
[51:01] talking to peter
[51:06] said that but i have prayed
[51:23] but you asked me but what isaac but
[51:25] peter is done those you know he prayed
[51:27] for the sick and they were healed
[51:33] amen he was in jesus christ church you
[51:35] know jesus
[51:37] christ
[51:39] but how come you know throughout all
[51:41] those years that he spent with jesus
[51:46] jesus tell peter you know go to this you
[51:49] find money in the belly of the fish
[51:51] [Music]
[51:55] miracles he saw all those great things
[51:59] you know peter himself said that lord we
[52:01] left our families we left our wives we
[52:04] left their homes
[52:12] but here at the end of the life of jesus
[52:16] amen jesus is telling peter peter you're
[52:18] not converted
[52:21] but wait until you are converted
[52:25] then go strengthen your brethren
[52:29] so what is converting what means what to
[52:31] convert what it is
[52:33] what is that
[52:35] amen to be converted
[52:37] by converting it means to be filled with
[52:39] the holy spirit
[52:41] incentive amen to be converted after
[52:43] converting amen is when you have the
[52:45] spirit of jesus christ
[52:49] that when jesus was talking to them
[52:52] amen the holy spirit was not sent
[52:55] to the spirit
[52:57] that's why none of them were converted
[53:28] [Music]
[53:37] as paul was saying
[53:39] you means that you have the holy spirit
[53:41] inside of you somebody have all the
[53:42] sentences because that's the only thing
[53:44] that will keep you to be confirmed
[53:49] that's the only thing that will keep you
[53:51] from being
[53:52] from being influenced says
[54:08] i don't know the french you say uzia you
[54:11] z-z-i-a-h
[54:14] i don't i don't i don't i don't remember
[54:16] the french name of the update you know
[54:20] who was i mean he was king since he was
[54:22] 12
[54:26] amen but but when he got older
[54:30] he felt him you know he was he fell
[54:32] himself with so much confidence uh he
[54:34] last until my confidence and you want to
[54:36] do the the the work of a chief priest
[54:42] foreign and god you know god bless god
[54:45] cursed him with labor
[54:49] amen and then you'll see that the the
[54:51] the that prophet saw him allah said
[54:53] prophet lavi amen because they kind of
[54:55] grew up together
[54:57] and he persecuted his life was
[54:59] influenced by him
[55:01] but when he saw him he was devastated
[55:04] but can't you love me in a day for my
[55:05] device he had to come back to himself he
[55:08] never revealed he meant to go talk to
[55:10] god
[55:11] amen why did what why his life didn't
[55:14] change because he knew what was inside
[55:16] of him
[55:19] that circumstance didn't move him
[55:21] because god would he knew exactly he
[55:24] knew his experience with god
[55:26] circumstances
[55:29] that's the only thing that would keep us
[55:31] from being from being confirmed with the
[55:33] world i lost the experience
[55:38] giving us an example of a church of two
[55:40] churches in the bible allah you see an
[55:43] example
[55:44] amen one church that was
[55:46] transformed in english getting
[55:48] transformed in the other church that was
[55:50] confirmed to that evil age
[55:56] let's turn to uh first corinthians
[55:58] chapter five verse one
[56:10] amen first corinthians chapter five
[56:12] premier convention peter sanchez
[56:23] even here the bible says that
[56:25] here's paul talking to the corinthians
[56:27] church this is
[56:31] it is reported commonly
[56:33] that there is fornication among you
[56:36] and such fornication as
[56:38] is not so much as named among the
[56:40] gentiles
[56:42] that one shall have his father's wife
[56:45] and you are puffed up
[56:47] and have no rather mourn that he that
[56:51] has done
[56:53] i'm sorry that he that has done this
[56:55] deed might be taken
[57:12] [Music]
[57:34] amen so now this is another uh now let's
[57:37] go to ephesians chapter five
[57:41] you see that paul is talking to those
[57:42] two churches you see paul paul i said
[57:45] this and first corinthians 5 and
[57:47] ephesians chapter 5.
[57:49] now you're letting me constitutionally
[57:50] assign to a efficient
[58:04] the bible says that be therefore
[58:05] followers of god as dear children
[58:12] yeah
[58:14] yeah yeah that's right be therefore
[58:16] followers of god as dear children and
[58:18] walk in love as christ also has loved us
[58:21] and has given himself for us and an
[58:24] offering and sacrifice to god and sweet
[58:27] smelling savor
[58:29] but fornication and all uncleanness or
[58:32] covertness
[58:34] let it be not
[58:35] once named among you
[58:37] as becometh sent
[58:40] neither filthiness nor foolish talking
[58:42] nor jesting which are not convenient but
[58:46] rather giving of thanks
[59:33] amen this is you know in ephesians you
[59:35] know this is how paul wanted the church
[59:38] to be
[59:39] satan seeker paul flake
[59:40] amen but if you read the first
[59:42] corinthians of civilization
[59:44] paul
[1:00:01] amen but when he comes here to the
[1:00:03] ephesian church
[1:00:04] this defense amen he's telling them that
[1:00:07] those things let it not be named among
[1:00:09] you
[1:00:16] amen because you are you are higher than
[1:00:19] you you know you are in the other level
[1:00:22] amen and we are the the ephesian church
[1:00:25] a new new song is the fact that
[1:00:33] amen we have to behave in a certain way
[1:00:35] that other will look at us and take us
[1:00:37] as examples
[1:00:42] now you know now in the beginning when
[1:00:44] god created men and women
[1:00:48] and god put inside of them at thirst
[1:00:52] amen that thirst that will push them to
[1:00:54] go look for god
[1:00:58] he put inside of them a thirst that will
[1:00:59] push them to go serve god to go do
[1:01:01] everything
[1:01:06] but now you see that the devil knowing
[1:01:08] the power of that thirst
[1:01:13] he wanted to create a substitute
[1:01:17] in substitute america he wanted to
[1:01:20] create created something that would that
[1:01:21] would resemble to that thirst
[1:01:26] because he knows that you know a person
[1:01:28] who is thirsty
[1:01:32] everything until it is
[1:01:49] so now you see that the devil in the
[1:02:05] he said well you know i mean came to eve
[1:02:06] he said well well god said this but if
[1:02:08] you do this there is another result
[1:02:12] you know you know
[1:02:14] what you pray for to pray god didn't
[1:02:16] want you to become like him to see
[1:02:18] everything like he
[1:02:33] leaf that that was given to them
[1:02:37] amen it wasn't a permanent you know a
[1:02:39] permanent clothes
[1:02:42] it was like a religion
[1:02:44] religion you can't hide behind religion
[1:02:58] amen that's why you know what that's
[1:03:00] what that's what happens to to many of
[1:03:02] us all of us
[1:03:06] when we do something wrong
[1:03:11] find a way out
[1:03:14] we're always
[1:03:27] i did this because i couldn't
[1:03:53] instead of us manufacturing that life
[1:03:56] only the fabric
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:25] in life welcome you can go to church and
[1:04:27] look at how christian
[1:04:31] copy every movement
[1:04:34] you try to copy how they say you say
[1:04:37] you try to copy how they walk she said
[1:04:39] dimitri commander you try to copy how
[1:04:41] how they talk
[1:04:44] but there is a time limit
[1:04:47] there will be a time where you won't be
[1:04:48] able to come back
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:52] it's the
[1:05:34] had
[1:05:34] happened to do that you accomplish that
[1:05:37] same work you had to have the original
[1:05:39] one
[1:05:43] amen amen and that that's why the devil
[1:05:45] you know that's how they were trying to
[1:05:47] fool people
[1:05:50] that's the same thing he did with jacob
[1:05:53] jacob amen if you read the life of jacob
[1:05:56] you know in genesis chapter 25
[1:06:02] at the birth of jacob god told his
[1:06:04] parents exactly what was supposed to
[1:06:05] happen
[1:06:09] god told you you know jacob's mom that
[1:06:11] you know the the the elder will serve
[1:06:13] the youngest
[1:06:19] amen but growing up their father kind of
[1:06:21] mixed up everything
[1:06:25] amen but it happens that in genesis
[1:06:27] chapter 27 may oversee verses
[1:06:43] because she knew the promise that the
[1:06:59] v
[1:07:00] and he come unto his father and said my
[1:07:03] father
[1:07:07] and he said his father said uh uh here i
[1:07:09] hear am i
[1:07:11] who my son comes from
[1:07:19] so for the first time jacob was asked
[1:07:22] this question who are you a poor premier
[1:07:24] foreign
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:41] amen jacob went to his father with a
[1:07:44] fake identity
[1:07:47] in force identity a man jacob went to
[1:07:49] his father with a you know a faith
[1:07:52] with a faith a fake name
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:23] that blessing didn't really help jacob
[1:08:26] set benediction apart from my days
[1:08:27] according to amen he was blessed
[1:08:30] but trouble was always coming back
[1:08:34] amen he was blessed
[1:08:36] but
[1:08:47] because he went to his father with a
[1:08:49] fake identity
[1:09:02] when you come here in in genesis chapter
[1:09:05] 32
[1:09:08] amen now jacob has definitely in front
[1:09:11] of him he says
[1:09:13] amen now the situation is becoming not
[1:09:15] real
[1:09:17] now everything is now serious he's a
[1:09:19] matter of definition
[1:09:23] opportunity to meet the angels
[1:09:27] and now you'll see that the second time
[1:09:29] at the end someone asked jacob what what
[1:09:32] what his name
[1:09:37] amen and he said verse 26 he said and he
[1:09:39] said let me go for the day breaketh and
[1:09:42] he said i will not let thee
[1:09:44] go except doubt bless me are you ready
[1:09:48] sir
[1:09:49] this is genesis
[1:09:51] 32
[1:09:53] tandoori
[1:10:03] genesis 32 verse
[1:10:05] 26
[1:10:09] genesis
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:25] and he said let me go for the day
[1:10:27] breaketh
[1:10:28] and he said i will not let thee go
[1:10:30] except they'll bless me
[1:10:43] now verse 27 the bible says that and he
[1:10:45] said unto him what is thy name
[1:10:53] and he said jacob
[1:10:56] jacob
[1:10:58] and and then the angel said and he said
[1:10:59] that name shall be called no more jacob
[1:11:01] by israel for as the prince has dealt
[1:11:04] power with god and with men and has
[1:11:06] prevailed
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:20] amen you see that the first time when
[1:11:23] jacob was asked for his name
[1:11:39] but here the second time the engine
[1:11:41] asked jacob about what what was that
[1:11:44] who launched the mansion amen jacob
[1:11:46] found himself in a position where he
[1:11:48] couldn't manufacture that life anymore
[1:12:06] lord you know that i lied to you
[1:12:09] lord you know that i killed you
[1:12:10] too lord you know that i do but you
[1:12:12] shall feed the profession and lord here
[1:12:14] i am once he said you are telling me and
[1:12:16] you see that from that time that he gave
[1:12:19] that he told the angel who he
[1:12:48] amen we have to go straight to the point
[1:12:52] because he said that if you
[1:12:53] to those who search me in sincerity
[1:12:59] those are the the people who will find
[1:13:01] me
[1:13:09] that was the same thing that was
[1:13:11] required to the prophet salallahu
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:43] god told the children of israel to keep
[1:13:45] the living out of their homes
[1:13:49] because the leaven is something that is
[1:13:51] not pure
[1:13:54] god wanted them to be pure allah foreign
[1:14:00] amen god wanted them to be to be honest
[1:14:04] he told them to take their living
[1:14:09] amen because sincerity is is the most
[1:14:11] important thing
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:15:07] your identity
[1:15:28] amen the bible says that and the keeper
[1:15:30] of the prison awakening this is in the
[1:15:32] this is another example
[1:15:35] and i found in acts chapter 16 verse 27
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:41] at 16
[1:15:43] 27 to 13 to 31
[1:15:46] act says
[1:15:49] so you'll see that this man is different
[1:15:52] than jacob
[1:15:56] amen this meant so how paul i mean let's
[1:15:59] let's read it first
[1:16:02] at 16
[1:16:04] 27 to 31
[1:16:07] access vance
[1:16:09] and the keeper of the prison awaking a
[1:16:11] working out this of his sleep
[1:16:14] and seeing the prison doors open he drew
[1:16:16] he drew out the sword and would have
[1:16:19] killed himself
[1:16:20] supposing that the prisoners have been
[1:16:22] fled
[1:16:24] but paul cried with a loud voice saying
[1:16:27] do thyself no harm
[1:16:29] for we all hear
[1:16:30] then he called for a light and springing
[1:16:33] and came trembling and fell down before
[1:16:35] paul inside this
[1:16:39] verse
[1:16:46] alley
[1:17:10] and broke them out and said sirs what
[1:17:12] must i do to be saved
[1:17:14] and they said believe on the lord jesus
[1:17:17] christ and thou shalt be saved in thy
[1:17:19] house
[1:17:20] and they speak unto him the word of lord
[1:17:22] and to all that were in this house
[1:17:38] amen here you'll see that this man who
[1:17:41] was keeping paul and silas in prison
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:49] he's so poor and sad is how they were
[1:17:51] behaving
[1:17:55] he kept them in prison for i don't know
[1:17:57] a day or two i don't know how long
[1:18:01] amen he saw
[1:18:03] at what time paul was praying
[1:18:06] for
[1:18:07] how many times paul was praying every
[1:18:09] day
[1:18:32] to go and to go copy whatever paul and
[1:18:35] silas were doing
[1:18:38] and
[1:18:52] manufacture
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:33] they told him exactly what he was
[1:19:35] supposed to do
[1:19:37] amen amen that believe in the lord jesus
[1:19:41] notice the response of paul remember
[1:19:44] amen paul also saw this man's life
[1:19:48] maybe
[1:20:02] all the negative things about this
[1:20:04] session
[1:20:05] but when this man went to paul and said
[1:20:07] what my side of the business
[1:20:11] paul never told that man what that
[1:20:14] person had to stop doing paul and
[1:20:16] apartheid
[1:20:34] paul never told him that you have to
[1:20:35] pray three times a day you know your
[1:20:37] party cannot be yet for a pastor paul
[1:20:39] never told him that you have to stop
[1:20:40] smoking
[1:20:43] amen paul told him that to believe in
[1:20:45] the lord jesus
[1:20:48] amen because you knew that once he
[1:20:50] believed in the lord
[1:20:54] he has the holy spirit
[1:20:56] amen the change will come
[1:21:00] amen is that the prophet in south africa
[1:21:02] the prophet
[1:21:04] amen when he was praying and preaching
[1:21:07] amen all those women they didn't have
[1:21:08] their clothes
[1:21:11] remember when the holy spirit came
[1:21:12] because the sentence
[1:21:14] the prophet never told them
[1:21:18] amen by the rain and the god
[1:21:23] the holy spirit is the most important
[1:21:25] thing
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:16] amen many people think that you know
[1:22:18] many people say but where brother isaac
[1:22:19] i had an experience with god
[1:22:21] this cannot face actually
[1:22:32] but you have to make sure that that
[1:22:34] experience not once is not one-time
[1:22:36] experience
[1:22:39] set the experience in the past your mind
[1:22:40] explains
[1:22:41] because you understand that when the
[1:22:43] king wanted to choose when the king
[1:22:45] wanted a bride in a time of history
[1:22:58] esther wasn't the only person to go talk
[1:23:00] to the king
[1:23:03] in other words esther wasn't the only
[1:23:05] woman who had an experience with the
[1:23:06] king
[1:23:08] she wasn't the only one who had an
[1:23:09] experience with the kids
[1:23:14] very inexperienced
[1:23:15] all of them were going to the king
[1:23:18] alexander
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:24:10] that doesn't mean that you know that's
[1:24:12] it that doesn't mean that it's the final
[1:24:14] thing
[1:24:17] you have to make sure that your
[1:24:18] experience
[1:24:21] is the same thing with what is inside of
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:26] your life is is reflecting
[1:24:42] how many of them got into the promises
[1:24:47] because what was inside basketball was
[1:24:50] different than what from what was on the
[1:24:52] outside
[1:24:53] still here amen that's why the inside
[1:24:55] has to be changed
[1:25:22] amen he was in the most holiest church
[1:25:26] list
[1:25:28] his pastor was jesus christ
[1:25:32] judas was taking care of all the
[1:25:34] fighters
[1:25:38] amen amen
[1:25:53] it doesn't matter how beautiful is your
[1:25:55] voice
[1:25:57] it doesn't matter how good is your
[1:25:58] sermon
[1:26:00] it doesn't matter if you serve him
[1:26:04] but as long as your inside is not
[1:26:20] i thought that i was one of them
[1:26:23] and jesus trusted me
[1:26:26] he gave me to take care of all the money
[1:26:32] in the end my my the inside wasn't
[1:26:33] changing
[1:26:47] you have to search this close now you
[1:26:49] have to pay attention
[1:26:52] if you keep saying well i don't condemn
[1:26:54] me to do this
[1:26:59] to see and it doesn't condemn me to do
[1:27:00] that achievement part of our faces see
[1:27:03] you know doing those things of the world
[1:27:05] studying
[1:27:07] i'm going to hurt you just a little bit
[1:27:10] okay
[1:27:12] pull the feathers back to the other way
[1:27:18] but but it's this one sure evidence
[1:27:22] that you have never been to christ
[1:27:30] you've never been born again
[1:27:34] you know in exam for example you say
[1:27:36] well i don't condemn me you know
[1:27:38] gossiping i don't i don't feel anything
[1:27:40] when i gossip
[1:27:56] amen the prophet says that this is one
[1:27:58] of this is one thing that says that you
[1:28:00] have never been to christ
[1:28:07] you've never been born again
[1:28:10] amen the prophet continues to say that
[1:28:12] he that loves the world and the things
[1:28:14] of the world the prophet continues
[1:28:18] the love of god is not even in heaven

[1:29:36] the world

[1:30:00] smoke
[1:30:04] the prophet said that what are you
[1:30:05] asking about it foreign
[1:30:10] if it's a question in your mind
[1:30:13] what happened leave it alone
[1:30:16] for anything you don't do by faith is
