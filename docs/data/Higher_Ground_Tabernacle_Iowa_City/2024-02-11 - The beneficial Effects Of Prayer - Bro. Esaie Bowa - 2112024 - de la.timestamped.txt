[0:01] is not going out of the curtain go back
[0:02] to the world and come
[0:06] back or trying to come back through the
[0:09] curtain
[0:11] again you come and ask things from God
[0:15] when he gives you you go back in the
[0:18] world the day after you come back to
[0:21] God things from God then you go back
[0:23] into into the
[0:28] world if you dwell in
[0:31] me and my word abide in
[0:35] you in other
[0:38] words if you are like Aon
[0:44] STI that has been brought in the CH
[0:50] Glory close to the port uh to the
[0:53] port of
[0:57] Mana where you can eat every time
[1:03] and your soul is
[1:06] refreshed so when you enter into his
[1:10] presence
[1:12] Glory your soul is
[1:15] refreshed it's blowing and bearing
[1:19] fruit he said then abide
[1:22] there stay
[1:25] there and let my words abide in
[1:28] you then ask everything that you want it
[1:31] should be granted unto
[1:33] you IID like to give you a
[1:36] secret if you know that you
[1:39] have or you got
[1:43] something that requires or God's
[1:50] assistance because there's a sin that
[1:52] require
[1:55] repar if you got to fix the
[1:58] thing go and fix it with the
[2:01] person don't come and waste your time in
[2:04] the prayer the
[2:05] church go fix up the thing with the
[2:08] person you criticize
[2:11] somebody go fix fix it with
[2:14] somebody don't say I've criticized
[2:19] you I had evil thought about
[2:27] you about somebody it's a
[2:31] sin now you're going to say my
[2:34] brother you know I had a evil thought
[2:36] about
[2:38] you in that time when I've seen what
[2:40] you've done I thought like you've done
[2:43] this because of
[2:45] this then forgive me for having those
[2:48] evil thought that's a sign of a true
[2:53] Christian because there there you are
[2:56] sinc and in the prayer God requires
[2:59] sincerity
[3:02] that when you're making your
[3:06] prayer you feel a condemnation in your
[3:09] heart stop
[3:11] praying that would be useless to
[3:13] continue
[3:14] pray go fix up the thing with a
[3:21] person a sin that only
[3:25] requires bring it in the presence of
[3:27] God and when you are so
[3:32] and you entered into the presence of God
[3:35] by
[3:37] crying you going to feel yourself that
[3:39] the condemnation is
[3:43] gone and you're going to have assur that
[3:46] you have been
[3:47] forgiven the Bible
[3:51] says if your heart doesn't condemn
[3:55] you Assurance before
[3:58] God but most of the
[4:02] time we trying to enter into God's
[4:07] pres but we don't have that assurance
[4:10] that we have been forgiven then we we
[4:13] come out of
[4:14] that and our sins keeps on accumulating
[4:18] accumulating
[4:20] accumulating but when we come to church
[4:23] and the church becomes so
[4:25] heavy because people have got sins their
[4:28] that they didn't confess
[4:32] light in the presence of
[4:35] God when we come in the Pres
[4:38] of we we we we got to be like
[4:43] popcorn when just the word of God is
[4:47] it jumping in the presence of
[4:49] God but
[4:51] people they've got so
[4:53] many and they don't want to conf they
[4:56] don't want to
[4:58] repent but they waiting for for the
[5:00] miracle how can the miracle
[5:04] come you are the order of your own
[5:08] Miracle you are the one who have to seek
[5:10] for your own by the way of
[5:14] living you need God to do something for
[5:17] you so how do you
[5:27] behave if it's so hard
[5:30] so just bear with
[5:31] me I didn't want to hurt somebody but
[5:34] I'm just
[5:38] preaching is for us to have some
[5:40] techniques of how to pray it's going to
[5:43] help us
[5:50] enough there's so many to say so I just
[5:53] okay make it
[5:58] sure uh
[6:06] you know the prayer is like a
[6:10] vapor when the vapor is going
[6:13] up it's
[6:17] invisible now I'm talking about the
[6:19] effect of the
[6:22] prayer when the VAP is going up to
[6:26] create
[6:27] rain sometimes it's not seen
[6:30] we don't see
[6:32] it but we will realize
[6:35] that that there's a
[6:41] rain when there's a rain falling that's
[6:43] where we remember that there
[6:48] been and when the rain is
[6:51] falling it may do so it can
[6:58] bring it can or
[7:00] or take out the
[7:04] trees it can crumble
[7:07] houses when the when the rain is
[7:10] fall it's that Vapor that
[7:13] went coming down in another which is
[7:17] rain and everything that we
[7:20] know it's the same thing with the
[7:24] prayer sometimes the prayer when it's
[7:26] going up it's
[7:28] invisible pray for something that we
[7:30] don't
[7:32] know when the results start
[7:35] coming then you
[7:38] realize it's taking out the sickness
[7:41] it's crumbling
[7:42] sins it's doing so many
[7:46] chaos that's why my brother and
[7:48] sisters we got to pay
[7:51] attention to a
[7:55] s when you that this man is a Christian
[7:59] a holy
[8:01] man pay attention the returns of pray
[8:05] can bring so many chos
[8:07] to because the prayer of a holy
[8:11] man can create so many
[8:14] chaos that you can't
[8:17] realize you just find yourself in a
[8:19] situation you don't know why you are in
[8:21] that
[8:22] situation it's
[8:25] because you despise one of the
[8:28] Saints
[8:30] you despise one of the little ones in
[8:33] the kingdom of
[8:34] God so you got to watch
[8:37] out with a son of God who pray with a
[8:41] daughter of God who prays in a deepest
[8:45] sincerity because the prayer of
[8:48] righteous has got more
[8:51] efficiency it produce results positive
[8:54] negative positive or
[8:56] negatives my yes my brother
[9:00] and we know what we're talking
[9:03] about when the
[9:05] saint and Peter was in the
[9:07] prison the prayer of
[9:10] saints freed Peter from the
[9:13] prison Peter didn't pray in but it was a
[9:17] prayer of saints gaed
[9:20] somewhere they were in
[9:22] prayer and the angel of the Lord came
[9:25] down Peter freed
[9:28] Peter
[9:30] so that's the effect of
[9:32] prayer the prayer
[9:35] liberating When you
[9:37] pray you can free
[9:39] yourself or you can Free People of your
[9:44] house dad is praying for the
[9:47] family m is praying for the
[9:50] family they're all praying for the kids
[9:53] that
[9:55] notice when she received
[9:58] those
[10:00] pray for the Salvation
[10:03] of and the member of her
[10:06] family so the prayer can
[10:10] people so the prayer want us to
[10:13] intercede yes my brother and
[10:16] sister I would like to say
[10:18] something before we finish
[10:21] up that the the prayer
[10:25] itself is not
[10:28] sufficient
[10:31] you going to ask yourself why am I
[10:32] saying
[10:33] this prayer itself is not
[10:36] enough
[10:39] why notice in the
[10:46] Bible when those 400 prophet of Bal were
[10:49] at a
[10:52] mountain the Bible says they prayed
[10:55] since morning until
[10:57] evening there wasn't any answer from
[10:59] their
[11:02] God there wasn't any answer from their
[11:04] God
[11:07] B they are God never answer their
[11:10] prayers but the prayer
[11:13] itself is not enough but now be
[11:17] attentive the prayer itself is not
[11:21] enough just because thein people are
[11:24] also
[11:26] praying they' got the kind of pray fight
[11:31] something see somebody
[11:33] with the Eyes Wide Open fighting looking
[11:38] at
[11:39] people and then say kick the devil give
[11:42] him a
[11:44] kill so
[11:48] pray because the prophet
[11:50] of they prayed from
[11:53] morning and they never been
[11:56] answered but now listen
[12:00] when Elijah the prophet
[12:03] came Elijah didn't start by
[12:06] praying but he have done
[12:08] something what Elijah have
[12:12] done he gaed the 12
[12:16] Stones that were making the of
[12:19] God he established the of God that was
[12:24] the 12 stes and the prophet of God
[12:27] says
[12:29] that was the Apostle
[12:32] teaching it was the word of
[12:35] God restoring the word of
[12:38] God he started restoring the word of God
[12:42] the teaching of
[12:44] Apostles He restored He
[12:46] restored when he restored
[12:50] the it was from the
[12:54] restor that he offered his
[12:57] prayer the prayer of
[13:02] was going to to to to to to POS itself
[13:05] upon the
[13:08] establish and now my brother and
[13:14] sisters we have received the restoration
[13:17] message El of
[13:20] Mal he came to establish the order of
[13:23] God and our
[13:25] prayer
[13:27] to
[13:29] has to be posed upon the Resto prayer
[13:33] restor is to know God to know the
[13:40] Lord you know that I know you from the
[13:43] message of
[13:44] Mal the restored
[13:47] order it's upon that that I'm coming to
[13:49] you our faith is to be upon that yes my
[13:53] brother and sisters but now the Bible
[13:56] says
[13:57] also
[13:59] whoever comes to God should believe that
[14:02] God
[14:04] exist
[14:08] and you can't just come in the
[14:11] Pres if you don't if you
[14:13] doubting
[14:16] exist when you're coming in the presence
[14:18] of the
[14:19] Lord be
[14:22] assured that the Lord is going to listen
[14:25] to you he's going to answer to
[14:27] you because who com come into the
[14:30] presence of God has to believe that
[14:34] God that is the one who's going to
[14:37] answer to those who
[14:38] are now brother
[14:40] s just because of
[14:44] pray EAS was
[14:47] sick he was a king the Bible
[14:52] says that the Lord
[14:54] said sent him a
[14:57] prophet said that tell going to die the
[15:02] sickness that is going to
[15:05] die go tell him that said the
[15:10] Lord
[15:13] imagine the
[15:18] prophet
[15:21] proud I can imagine that the
[15:25] same journalist who were there with
[15:27] their cameras and
[15:29] they
[15:31] ask brother
[15:33] Prophet what is going to happen to the
[15:36] king and
[15:39] isah he was so proud of
[15:42] himself the
[15:46] Lord the king ezekias is going to
[15:48] die just because it's God who said
[15:51] [Music]
[15:53] it and he entered in the house of he
[15:56] said unto him that's the Lord you're
[15:59] going to die of that
[16:02] sickness and the prophet
[16:06] said when Isaiah said that
[16:09] to he went
[16:14] out and Ezekiel St his face against the
[16:19] wall he asked for the grace of the Lord
[16:23] he said unto
[16:24] God Eternal God you know that
[16:30] acted according my heart with
[16:34] sincerity I don't want to die right
[16:37] now I want you to grant me 15 more
[16:41] years because I want to strengthen my
[16:43] kingdom and the prophet of God
[16:47] said he didn't spend 15
[16:51] minutes same Prophet who brought the the
[16:55] Lord saying that ezas is going to die
[16:59] he was the same Prophet God said unto
[17:02] him go back to
[17:04] e what am I going to say just go back
[17:08] and tell him that ezas you're not going
[17:10] to die anymore my brother and
[17:15] sisters it's a greater resource that we
[17:18] have to
[17:19] exploit just because of
[17:22] prayer God to and Grant unto him 15
[17:26] years more now I'll finish up with this
[17:30] a certain
[17:32] day there was this woman that we know
[17:35] hisory that the child was
[17:38] sick and he was about to
[17:41] die the prophet
[17:43] saying she pray the entire
[17:45] night she said oh
[17:48] God this uni child you g when I see in
[17:52] the
[17:53] Bible I'm just like
[17:56] thisam to whom you gave a child
[18:00] and now my child is
[18:01] dying without knowing you I pray the
[18:05] god that you may intercede for my
[18:08] child I see myself like that
[18:12] woman my my boy is like that of that
[18:16] woman but when I
[18:19] see there's
[18:21] Elijah there's no
[18:23] elij in the board in the Bible there was
[18:27] El I'm like that woman Lord my child is
[18:32] sick I need
[18:35] Elijah I'm identify myself to that woman
[18:38] so
[18:40] where I would like
[18:43] you I need
[18:47] lar that woman prayed for the whole
[18:50] night she stayed in the presence of the
[18:53] Lord and she spoke to God and God said
[18:57] unto her
[18:58] stand at the door of your home I will
[19:01] send you Elijah my brother and
[19:04] sisters Elijah was
[19:07] a was in the
[19:09] flight but just because that
[19:12] woman ascended it's a prayer to God to
[19:16] the throne of
[19:17] God that prayer entered to God's
[19:20] presence created something
[19:25] in made flight to land in the city where
[19:28] woman was stay was leaving and the
[19:30] flight the pilot said I don't know why
[19:35] but I
[19:36] think we got to we got to land first
[19:39] then we're going to continue the flight
[19:42] when they
[19:43] landed was in the flight he went out and
[19:49] said something said unto him just
[19:53] continue go forward keep
[19:56] walking said where I going the word told
[20:00] me just continue walking forward just
[20:02] move
[20:04] forward because there was a
[20:06] woman was like aam
[20:09] woman stay in the in the presence of
[20:13] God she created an
[20:15] atmosphere and atmosphere went
[20:18] up created the the break into the
[20:24] flight prayer made with the deepest
[20:26] deepest sincerity going to create an
[20:29] atmosphere an
[20:31] atmosphere going to produce
[20:34] result and continue
[20:37] walking because he was a prisoner of
[20:40] Christ a true type of a prisoner of
[20:43] Christ he didn't ask himself why he
[20:46] Wasing he didn't ask himself questions
[20:49] so he just moved forward by
[20:51] singing I'm one of them I'm one of
[20:55] them I'm so happy to be one of them
[20:59] that's why so many times we got to
[21:02] sing because the songs created create
[21:07] atmospheres and Bram moved
[21:09] forward after walking a long
[21:12] distance he he perceive something he
[21:16] perceive a woman
[21:17] standing with a woman weing
[21:22] some the woman

[21:46] Lord the Lord showed me your your face
[21:49] at night when I was
[21:52] praying he said that you will

[23:10] person who knows to whom she was talking
