[43:15] um I thank our brother John sent it to
[43:17] me and I was really blessed
[43:21] uh
[43:24] it excites me when I see
[43:28] the involvement of the young kids
[43:30] from up here there is a fair um
[43:36] it means a lot
[43:39] and I'm sure God is pleased with it
[43:44] and so we just thank God for the Sunday
[43:47] School all together
[43:51] I know it's not easy
[43:55] I tried it many times even in Des Moines
[44:00] are they coming they go
[44:04] they come and they go
[44:06] but I trust I trust this Sunday school
[44:09] stance
[44:15] amen God is good to us are you there in
[44:19] Daniel
[44:21] Daniel the 12th chapter
[44:27] we're going to read at the 9th and the

[44:34] and he said go thy Way Daniel
[44:38] for the words are closed up and sealed
[44:42] to the time
[44:44] of the end
[44:57] foreign
[45:19] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[45:23] none of the wise shall none of the
[45:25] wicked excuse me shall understand
[45:28] foreign
[45:33] foreign
[45:58] Lord we pray this morning
[46:02] service in a special way
[46:05] Lord we thank you for your anointing
[46:08] your presence
[46:11] we can't do one thing without you lord
[46:16] we asked this morning that you look
[46:19] beyond our thoughts of attention
[46:22] and see our needs oh God
[46:25] as we commit this service in your hands
[46:29] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[46:33] amen amen you may be seated
[46:37] yeah
[46:39] there are so many things that are in my
[46:42] mind this morning
[46:45] things I I like to say
[46:49] or preach the shots
[46:53] but if there be one thing that I want
[46:56] you to
[46:58] get this morning may yeah
[47:02] or to understand
[47:05] is that you are who you are
[47:10] because of the power
[47:13] and the influence of the word
[47:18] there are so many people in the world
[47:24] who really don't believe in God can look
[47:27] like you and personally
[47:31] I can't understand that
[47:34] because even when I was a little
[47:37] Fellowship I knew that there was a great
[47:41] one somewhere
[47:45] I may not have known him by name
[47:49] or even knew him personally
[47:55] but I knew that Jesus Christ
[47:59] was God it did you
[48:03] no one taught me about the Trinity
[48:08] because I knew God wasn't three persons
[48:15] are always somehow understood
[48:20] that there was only one God yeah
[48:24] I don't know how come I understood that
[48:30] other than it was given to me by God now
[48:37] I'm going to use some illustrations this
[48:40] morning
[48:43] because I want you to understand
[48:46] that God is omnipresent okay
[48:50] he's everywhere
[48:53] by way of his omniscience
[48:57] he knows everything
[49:01] and whether we believe it or not
[49:05] it is because of the in
[49:10] that we are here today
[49:14] I'm going to use America for an example
[49:19] brother Venom tells us
[49:22] that America was built okay
[49:26] on uh the Christian principle
[49:31] we understand by history
[49:36] that the pilgrims came to America okay
[49:42] to have freedom
[49:47] our constitution not the Constitution
[49:51] our churches
[49:53] our businesses everything
[50:04] by the principles of the word
[50:08] we were a clean Nation
[50:12] we were a moral Nation music
[50:17] we were a nation they had more miracles
[50:21] more signs and more wonders
[50:27] than any nation in the world
[50:31] or any nation that had ever existed
[50:36] in this day in time
[50:39] we have more preach
[51:03] and it's because of the preaching of the
[51:07] Cross
[51:08] or the preaching of the word
[51:11] Who We Are
[51:14] foreign
[51:17] if it
[51:20] had not been
[51:25] for the influence of the word
[51:29] in our personal lives
[51:33] where would we be on earth is that right
[51:37] yes the Bible says we had all we would
[51:42] have all
[51:44] to become like Sodom and Gomorrah
[51:49] we would have all
[51:51] become like Sodom and Gomorrah comes
[51:56] if it had not been a seed
[52:00] s
[52:02] that means if it wasn't for the word
[52:09] perverted in some way
[52:12] hallelujah amen
[52:48] and these things that we teach them
[52:54] influences their lives
[52:57] in ways that
[53:00] that if we had not taught them
[53:04] they would be confused
[53:07] especially in this age
[53:11] of who they are
[53:13] the second song
[53:14] we have in this day
[53:17] because of the lack of the the word of
[53:20] God
[53:22] we have people who are thinking
[53:26] that they are cats
[53:32] there are all kinds of animals
[53:37] because the Bible the Bible says that
[53:41] the book was sealed can they live right
[53:44] there hallelujah amen it was shut up
[53:48] and theologians can never bring a
[53:51] Revival
[53:54] hallelujah amen they can only give the
[53:57] dead letter
[54:01] this is why we see America in the
[54:06] conditions she's in condition
[54:09] it is no longer America
[54:12] it's the entire world
[54:15] amen
[54:47] thank God for the influence
[54:51] of the word of God
[54:53] hallelujah amen even to the young people
[54:57] you may think your parents are being too
[55:00] strictly
[55:02] but understand
[55:04] they are giving you the words
[55:09] in expectation
[55:11] that the word will influence
[55:16] in the right way
[55:18] that one day hey as you you would become
[55:22] a Christian
[55:24] hallelujah amen see the word will not
[55:28] return back voice
[55:33] this is what I love this is what I love
[55:45] and the word of God tells us without a
[55:49] vision okay
[55:50] without a vision
[55:52] the people perish oh
[55:57] because the vision is like
[56:08] [Music]
[56:38] [Music]
[56:50] [Music]
[56:53] there's no use of writing history books
[56:56] anymore
[56:58] there's no
[57:00] uh there's no need to write history
[57:04] books anymore
[57:06] because this is the end
[57:10] that means everything
[57:14] rules
[57:20] and the kingdom of God
[57:22] is ushering in it
[57:27] Hallelujah y'all believe that We Believe
[57:31] we believe that the book will shut up it
[57:36] was close it was sealed until this time
[57:42] now why would God
[57:45] unveil the book
[57:48] open the book in this day
[57:53] because he realized that the world would
[57:58] be in chaos
[58:01] when you remove God out of your house
[58:10] when you remove God out of your church
[58:14] when you remove God out of your life
[58:19] you become a chaos
[58:23] and the only reason
[58:26] we stand as men and women today
[58:35] we don't need science
[58:37] to determine what we are
[58:40] somebody amen the Bible says he made two
[58:45] genders
[58:46] and female
[58:48] amen
[58:53] [Music]
[59:00] oh man
[59:02] now we know the book will shut up
[59:06] but then God opened the book it may not
[59:09] just
[59:10] Revelation 10 . right Revelation 5. you
[59:15] we find out that there was a there was a
[59:19] great event
[59:21] that happened in our day
[59:25] hallelujah amen the Lamb of God
[59:29] came and opened the book it is
[59:32] [Music]
[59:36] the book became a new book
[59:40] Hallelujah it didn't change your old
[59:43] Bible
[59:45] into a new Bible about
[59:49] it did not change your old Bible
[59:53] into a new Bible
[59:56] novel right but the Revelation
[1:00:00] it was the revelation
[1:00:03] of the word of God that made the old
[1:00:07] Bible yeah
[1:00:13] second video the things you thought you
[1:00:15] knew
[1:00:17] you did not know them
[1:00:20] hallelujah oh man why because the book
[1:00:23] was sealed you couldn't understand God
[1:00:27] the way we understand
[1:00:30] they could not understand
[1:00:34] the way we understand
[1:00:38] they did not know God
[1:00:41] the way we know God
[1:00:44] why because the book was not open
[1:00:48] because
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:57] said so and it talks about those seven
[1:01:00] Thunders
[1:01:01] and then he began to give us an
[1:01:04] illustration
[1:01:07] it's like a rocket saying
[1:01:32] now that the book is open
[1:01:35] it'll never be close again
[1:01:38] Hallelujah and the revelation of this
[1:01:42] book this will leave will continue to
[1:01:44] unfold
[1:01:46] it will continue to unfold
[1:01:49] to the believer
[1:01:52] hallelujah amen that's
[1:01:54] why we could not just stop
[1:01:57] stop with William Branham Ave
[1:02:02] I'm not against William Branham but if
[1:02:05] you don't see what he came to do you
[1:02:08] won't understand who you are
[1:02:11] understand what I'm saying we needed him
[1:02:16] hallelujah amen he was the one God used
[1:02:20] Hallelujah to open the book
[1:02:24] hallelujah amen right or to make us see
[1:02:29] what's open
[1:02:31] Hallelujah because only the lamb could
[1:02:35] have opened the book
[1:02:36] hallelujah amen and only William
[1:02:39] Brothers
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:19] this is the reason why I'm here
[1:03:22] this is my Ministry to identify the Lamb
[1:03:26] of God
[1:03:27] hallelujah is that right that's the way
[1:03:31] it is
[1:03:32] it was with John so was it with Brothers
[1:03:36] he was the one to identify
[1:03:41] hallelujah amen wow the world was in
[1:03:45] darkness
[1:03:51] some of his best friends
[1:03:53] I mean left him
[1:03:56] Hallelujah glory to God but there were a
[1:04:00] few here
[1:04:08] there were those a few yes who have been
[1:04:12] influenced is your influence not by then
[1:04:15] the the the the letter of the word
[1:04:17] but by the revelation of the world
[1:04:21] hallelujah amen there are those you know
[1:04:25] who understood he complained Hallelujah
[1:04:28] that when brother banham
[1:04:30] that that
[1:04:33] literally
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:21] because Jesus says
[1:05:24] I am the alpha at the Omega in Omega I
[1:05:28] am the beginning I am the end Hallelujah
[1:05:32] that's why brother Branham could not
[1:05:35] just
[1:05:36] preaching of the New Testament he had to
[1:05:39] go back to the Old Testament Hallelujah
[1:05:47] he went all the way in too the mind of
[1:05:52] God he showed us what God is not us
[1:05:57] somebody help me here he showed our
[1:06:00] beginning
[1:06:01] and he showed us our ending
[1:06:05] hallelujah amen let me say it like this
[1:06:08] no matter what the devil tries to do
[1:06:11] with you
[1:06:13] those of us
[1:06:15] those of us who are
[1:06:18] predestinated
[1:06:20] those of us who have been chosen those
[1:06:24] of us who are bright
[1:06:26] there is no demon in Hell okay that can
[1:06:32] stop us from making a Rapture
[1:06:35] Hallelujah why do you say that brother
[1:06:38] Hallelujah
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:40] Adam gave his life for Eve
[1:06:45] forever for Eve Hallelujah and Jesus

[1:10:08] think about this
[1:10:10] out of the trillions of people
[1:10:14] that lived on the earth
[1:10:18] and out of the trillions of people
[1:10:22] either going to heaven or hell yeah
[1:10:28] you know God knows exactly where they
[1:10:30] are yeah
[1:10:34] he knows exactly what they're doing at
[1:10:37] this moment
[1:10:41] he is the controller of all things
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:48] the Bible said that's what David said
[1:10:51] if I make my bed in hell
[1:10:55] if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:03] so there's no way of getting around him
[1:11:07] Hallelujah that's what the prophet of
[1:11:09] God says he's so high you can't get over
[1:11:12] him
[1:11:14] he's so low you can't go under him
[1:11:20] so you must come through the door
[1:11:25] hallelujah amen now
[1:11:28] I said all of this because we have a
[1:11:32] tendency
[1:11:33] to forget how good is God has been to us
[1:11:40] God is good to us
[1:11:43] even now remember now
[1:11:47] how many in here feel good in your body
[1:11:51] come on now that in itself is a blessing
[1:12:01] your body
[1:12:04] then you remember how good you used to
[1:12:07] feel alone
[1:12:11] it takes away the pain the country if I
[1:12:14] will tell you you feel like a new person
[1:12:17] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:12:19] it's so good to know that God is still a
[1:12:25] Healer
[1:12:29] I didn't bring my letter with me
[1:12:32] but I intended to bring it
[1:12:35] some time ago I had cancer the doctor
[1:12:39] said I had it or whatever the case may
[1:12:40] be uh y'all heard my testimony
[1:12:45] so my wife I was trying to get more
[1:12:47] insurance for me
[1:12:51] so my wife if something should happen to
[1:12:54] me
[1:12:56] she won't have to go around with a cup
[1:12:58] on her in her hand on on the streets
[1:13:01] y'all know what I'm saying yeah
[1:13:06] so in order for me to do that I had to
[1:13:09] go to the insurance to the I had to have
[1:13:12] a physical
[1:13:15] and and they did the MRI and everything
[1:13:19] now I got it in writing man I was just a
[1:13:23] lot exactly I got the documents here
[1:13:25] this in my book bag that says I have
[1:13:27] cancer
[1:13:29] and now I have the document says I'm
[1:13:32] cancer-free yes
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:37] yes the devil is a liar
[1:13:42] glory to God Amen see what I'm trying to
[1:13:45] say is he's the same secretary yesterday
[1:13:48] today and forever
[1:13:52] Hallelujah amen
[1:13:57] amen
[1:13:59] listen equity
[1:14:01] what we saw in William Branham
[1:14:04] was to never stop
[1:14:07] foreign
[1:14:11] but we as a people knew and thank you
[1:14:13] people because we kept looking at him
[1:14:19] almost
[1:14:22] but we know we have life here
[1:14:26] now maybe it's just
[1:14:28] just
[1:14:29] but I believe in the Supernatural
[1:14:34] and I believe that if you're a True
[1:14:36] Believer the supernatural was supposed
[1:14:40] to follow you
[1:14:42] hallelujah amen I believe now now we're
[1:14:47] not a prophet sometimes that's what
[1:14:49] William Brandon was
[1:14:56] that William Branham came to that
[1:14:58] Perfection
[1:15:01] otherwise we won't
[1:15:03] if he did not
[1:15:06] we won't
[1:15:08] come to Perfection
[1:15:10] because he saw the revelation of the
[1:15:13] word
[1:15:15] brings us to that Perfection
[1:15:19] you see the book had to be open
[1:15:23] the full word
[1:15:26] a revelation of who God is
[1:15:32] coming from
[1:15:35] the message spiritual food and due
[1:15:37] season uh
[1:15:40] I get excited
[1:15:44] see let me tell you something there's
[1:15:46] some of these shows you can't just read
[1:15:49] this message
[1:15:51] or just listen to it
[1:15:53] you got to meditate on it and pray
[1:15:58] that's the only way the Revelation comes
[1:16:02] you understand what I mean because you
[1:16:05] can say exactly what brother Branham
[1:16:07] says
[1:16:09] and yet be a false witness
[1:16:12] when you don't understand
[1:16:16] if you don't understand the spiritual
[1:16:18] applications
[1:16:22] you're just repeating what he says
[1:16:26] so you give an illustration they said
[1:16:30] Jesus said in three days
[1:16:57] but he said it in that
[1:17:18] that he preached to them
[1:17:24] selves why we have to be careful
[1:17:26] I got a quote brother said it ain't the
[1:17:30] missiles that we need to be afraid of
[1:17:38] he says it's the churches
[1:17:45] it's the churches
[1:17:50] so you'll know it's not me
[1:17:53] the churches that you need to be afraid
[1:17:57] in this last day
[1:18:02] listen
[1:18:03] spiritual food in due season
[1:18:06] paragraph 70.
[1:18:09] he said now do you see where I'm trying
[1:18:13] to get you too
[1:18:16] I spoke with you pretty plain this
[1:18:19] morning
[1:18:21] don't you see the authority of the
[1:18:24] Living God in the Living Church the
[1:18:26] bride no voice
[1:18:30] sick or healed it is
[1:18:43] a message
[1:18:45] and the messenger who
[1:19:06] is now the
[1:19:08] Church
[1:19:10] and that church has the purse
[1:19:13] listen that person is Jesus Christ
[1:19:17] it's the message
[1:19:20] and you
[1:19:22] the message and you
[1:19:25] must become one remember
[1:19:28] hallelujah amen not the message and the
[1:19:31] preacher Parliament
[1:19:33] the message and the bride
[1:19:38] must become one
[1:19:41] and when we become one
[1:19:45] and the bride let me see the same he
[1:19:49] said she is the message
[1:19:54] hey amen it never the word
[1:19:59] stayed on the stones
[1:20:03] Bliss
[1:20:04] until Jesus Christ came
[1:20:07] it moved from a hearted hearted Stone
[1:20:11] y'all hear me because the law couldn't
[1:20:14] save nobody
[1:20:18] literally brought death
[1:20:22] but when we saw the word
[1:20:26] coming flesh that I share God in Christ
[1:20:32] we understood now where the Bible says
[1:20:37] God no longer write on tablets of stone
[1:20:41] yeah
[1:20:42] but he writes on the tables of the
[1:20:45] hearts
[1:20:46] somebody help me what is it the very
[1:20:51] word foreign
[1:21:18] you say what do you mean
[1:21:22] because he was
[1:21:25] and he is
[1:21:28] we get the word eternal life
[1:21:33] because God gave it to us
[1:21:36] so that we could better understand
[1:21:42] hallelujah amen but then the prophet
[1:21:45] comes around it has no beginning
[1:21:57] and that person is Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] now being influenced foreign
[1:22:09] did you know that every time you talk
[1:22:12] words
[1:22:15] it's put in a book
[1:22:21] did y'all know that yes
[1:22:25] beginning at the 60 first oh verses says
[1:22:29] don't be in a rush
[1:22:34] but I
[1:22:37] just
[1:22:39] don't you understand that you are who
[1:22:41] you are was that because
[1:22:47] why do you have boundaries
[1:22:50] and the world has none
[1:22:57] somewhere where you build
[1:23:01] you have been living
[1:23:13] the foreign
[1:23:21] thou shall not steal
[1:23:24] thou shall not kill
[1:23:28] your Ten Commandments
[1:23:30] What Child that you know of has never
[1:23:33] stolen
[1:23:34] get along
[1:23:40] I mean you know you have children
[1:23:42] fussing over toys
[1:23:44] and one would say that's mine yeah
[1:23:48] when they know it's not theirs
[1:23:52] and then they will act a lot
[1:23:56] they act just like it's there therefore
[1:23:58] I should come see
[1:24:00] and then mama
[1:24:06] you know this is not your time
[1:24:10] we don't have to teach him how to lie
[1:24:12] yeah
[1:24:20] those babies are crying like they wet
[1:24:24] or cry like they hungry remember yeah
[1:24:41] right and some babies take it farther
[1:24:44] than that
[1:24:46] when they want you to rock them
[1:24:49] when you when they want you to rock them
[1:24:53] nothing's wrong with them but they just
[1:24:57] want that attention
[1:25:05] who taught that baby how to lie yeah
[1:25:14] we're born with that nature
[1:25:20] for parents to teach
[1:25:23] them
[1:25:24] the word of God
[1:25:29] that you you yourself
[1:25:33] the word of God
[1:25:37] just one more statement
[1:25:39] how many times
[1:25:42] how many times you allowed yourself
[1:25:44] to get slack with reading the word
[1:25:48] and then
[1:25:49] Satan trip you up foreign
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:19] who would have believed it
[1:26:22] but the Bible said
[1:26:25] hallelujah amen oh come on somebody the
[1:26:29] same Bible that prophesied about Judas
[1:26:33] prophesied about America
[1:26:37] the whole world
[1:26:41] and we have become
[1:26:43] exactly exactly what the world the words
[1:26:46] say we would
[1:26:53] world that is
[1:26:55] because we moved away from the world
[1:27:02] she moved away from the world and when
[1:27:06] she moved away from the world look what
[1:27:07] happened
[1:27:12] you see
[1:27:14] that song and that wrote denominational
[1:27:16] Church
[1:27:32] I'm getting excited
[1:27:35] because that is the key
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:58] third chapter
[1:28:00] verses
[1:28:03] then they
[1:28:05] that fear the lord
[1:28:07] speak often one to another
[1:28:11] and the Lord hearkened and heard it
[1:28:15] and a book of remembrance was written
[1:28:18] before him
[1:28:20] for them that fear the lord and that
[1:28:23] thought upon his name y'all
[1:28:26] hallelujah amen so when you're thinking
[1:28:28] about the message do you know what
[1:28:29] you're doing you're thinking upon his
[1:28:31] name
[1:28:34] hallelujah amen and they shall
[1:28:37] they said the Lord
[1:28:39] I get excited sorry
[1:28:51] spareth his own son that serveth him
[1:28:54] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:29:01] the wrath of God is here
[1:29:05] and it's going to
[1:29:08] coins
[1:29:12] Hallelujah
[1:29:14] they tell us that there's going to be a
[1:29:15] stock market
[1:29:17] s
[1:29:21] that he did
[1:29:24] but I'm not worried about it
[1:29:29] because in the time of trouble
[1:29:32] he shall hide me
[1:29:35] in his Pavilion
[1:29:38] don't worry about that your concerns are
[1:29:42] to be how how close I am how where I am
[1:29:49] in the eyes of God
[1:30:00] you know
[1:30:03] you know yeah
[1:30:05] for a long time
[1:30:10] there are things in places in your life
[1:30:15] Victorious
[1:30:18] but sometimes God will leave a little
[1:30:21] something
[1:30:28] he'll leave it there to keep you praying
[1:30:32] and then when he brings you to a place
[1:30:35] of perfection hey
[1:30:39] when your purpose has been fulfilled
[1:30:43] comfortable he would then take that away
[1:30:48] is that right just like brother Venom
[1:30:52] said in in as I was with Moses
[1:30:58] that he is
[1:31:00] I'm paraphrasing
[1:31:03] he's not looking at your failures
[1:31:07] he's looking at your commission
[1:31:13] because there is not one man
[1:31:16] who was born of a woman
[1:31:19] foreign
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:32:01] and I want to go there
[1:32:05] and I want to go there and see it
[1:32:08] thought
[1:32:11] s
[1:32:15] is that right
[1:32:18] why would you say that because Brothers
[1:32:21] in God's way of saying that he said it
[1:32:25] like this
[1:32:26] whatsoever you say
[1:32:29] whatever you ask it would be a two
[1:32:31] seconds that's in this
[1:32:43] I don't mean do that I'm almost done
[1:32:46] when I told you I was ahead a little bit
[1:32:48] longer y'all got really tired
[1:32:52] so and I know it's warm in here so let
[1:32:54] me hurry up
[1:32:55] the 18th verse
[1:32:58] then shall ye return
[1:33:01] and discern between the righteous and
[1:33:05] the wicked
[1:33:07] between him that served God and him that
[1:33:10] serveth him not Hallelujah
[1:33:15] foreign
[1:33:21] now in the Book of Job you don't have to
[1:33:23] turn there
[1:33:26] you want to write it down job 37 message
[1:33:30] 11 to 13. but I'm going to tell you what
[1:33:34] he says
[1:33:36] and what the water does
[1:33:39] the house and all of these days
[1:33:44] he said he causes it to come
[1:33:48] for correction yeah
[1:33:59] and I said all of that because
[1:34:05] we must come to understand
[1:34:09] the anointing
[1:34:16] right and the Bible said the anointing
[1:34:26] organized
[1:34:39] let me let me read this quote
[1:34:42] coming from the message of
[1:34:46] what is the Holy Ghost 1959
[1:34:49] .
[1:34:52] now the spirit of God has worked at the
[1:34:55] justification
[1:35:00] sanctification on the western uh
[1:35:03] baptism of the Holy ghosts
[1:35:08] and here
[1:35:10] in the last day
[1:35:13] performing and
[1:35:16] do it
[1:35:21] what is it
[1:35:24] the church in Christ has become one uh
[1:35:29] you're listening to that yes he said now
[1:35:32] they're doing the very same thing
[1:35:38] it's the scary part because no matter
[1:35:41] how you
[1:35:42] how you well
[1:35:44] the very same thing like Christ did
[1:35:48] you started it's supposed to be done
[1:35:52] Hey listen let's go on and as soon as
[1:35:55] they connect together
[1:35:58] the church in Christ as soon as they
[1:36:02] connected
[1:36:03] or something that last link is
[1:36:12] every
[1:36:16] effort we have not yet
[1:36:18] connected
[1:36:24] no
[1:36:27] yeah
[1:36:28] because he said as soon
[1:36:31] as
[1:36:32] soon
[1:36:34] okay
[1:36:36] they connect
[1:36:38] that last link
[1:36:41] through the church he's not talking
[1:36:43] about Pentecostals
[1:36:48] she'll go through the
[1:36:49] through this
[1:36:53] up will come Wesley
[1:36:55] yeah
[1:36:57] and all the rest of them back in those
[1:37:00] days
[1:37:03] will be loud
[1:37:07] and he that last will be first
[1:37:10] can we come out of the Resurrection
[1:37:19] that's what the Holy Ghost does it's a
[1:37:21] secular sentence the Holy Ghost by
[1:37:23] justification
[1:37:26] just a little shadow
[1:37:45] by the restoration
[1:37:51] being in
[1:37:53] here
[1:37:54] forming signs and wonders
[1:37:57] like he did at the beginning
[1:38:01] he said
[1:38:04] going to called me Holy Roller anyhow
[1:38:07] let me apply foreign
[1:38:12] let me try to get to this one
[1:38:33] oh God is good I tell you if we could
[1:38:36] just
[1:38:37] you know he said brother books like have
[1:38:40] you arrived no
[1:38:41] but I'm on my way
[1:38:46] I see where I'm here
[1:38:50] and I'm fighting
[1:38:54] I'm battling every day sometimes all day
[1:38:59] knowing the will of God
[1:39:03] but what are you fighting the Brooks
[1:39:06] iniquity
[1:39:15] hallelujah amen I am a total believer of
[1:39:18] this word
[1:39:19] hallelujah but like Paul say how to
[1:39:22] perform it
[1:39:27] my last quote
[1:39:29] coming from the supernatural
[1:39:32] right Jehovah
[1:39:34] great Jehovah God
[1:39:36] who lived before there was an eternity
[1:39:42] you was without father yeah
[1:39:45] without mother here's some mayor without
[1:39:49] beginning of days
[1:39:53] reading upon the pages of this sacred
[1:39:57] books
[1:40:03] how the things that you did in the days
[1:40:06] of your the show
[1:40:10] and to have the privilege of the living
[1:40:14] in this Dark Age
[1:40:25] hallelujah amen a privilege of living in
[1:40:28] this Dark Age
[1:40:32] at the end of the world
[1:40:36] and seeing you rise on the scene again
[1:40:42] no guessing
[1:40:44] no man-made theology
[1:40:48] no cold atmosphere of just joining a
[1:40:52] church
[1:40:53] or singing a paper
