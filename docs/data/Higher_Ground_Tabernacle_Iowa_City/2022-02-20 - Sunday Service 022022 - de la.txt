[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you and i know god the way he was he fairly strong shaking because it says that he dwells or in the process of worship double presented so we came to preach the word of god this morning jiron oh we're here last night there was a meeting leading by brother keleb from arizona pastor brooks city excuse me so brother books excused himself of not being here this morning so i was chosen to bring the word of god this morning we also greet them in the name of the lord jesus christ and we welcome them in the house of the lord we shall read in the book of job chapter 1 verse 5 to 8. we shall read in the name of the lord jesus a a and it was so when the days of their first thing uh first thing we're going about that jobs end and and sanctify them and rose up early in the morning and offered bain offering according to the number of them all for job said it may it may be that my sons have seen and and cursed god in their hearts does the job continually presented to now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them [Music] lord said unto satan one way come as thee then satan answered the lord and said from going to from going to and from in the earth and from walking up and down in it [Music] and the lord said unto satan is thou considered my seventh job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that of god and oh please listen may god add the blessing to the world [Music] lord you've broken this bread of life for us this morning may we may may we eat this bread and have life that is inna we want in the name of the lord jesus christ we want you to take over the preachers and also they will interpret the lord may the ears that are gonna listen to this may you may be seated that we're going to entitle have you seen my main on the earth i've taken that from us where god is telling satan if you considered my seventh job inaudible there is none like him on the earth it's an upright man kenyan hearing god and avoiding the evil hello feb says i believe you believe in william branham because brother says [Music] [Music] i don't have a special message this morning remember i'm just coming to tell you what brother himself have said masculine message because the message is not for the man but there's a message of god that he gave a man and now february and branham said where we read with you in the book of job themselves before god developed they came before god i'm saying it wasn't like a natural children like this but it was angels that came before god which means even here on earth the devil can have access to whatever because in heaven where it's really holy the devil had an access to and that was not the first time that the devil had access to the leave of the earth to introduce [Music] so that he can go and he can go die over there nsp spirit came before god presented you understand that the devil can present himself in the meaning where god is with this angel and if the satan can be in heaven where is [Music] confident job that's why he said unto satan if you consider my servant job no connection and we know all this story of job [Music] a trusted job job where we compare job and moses god had more trust in job than he had in moses forever [Music] you never give that gift of divine healing but he put that upon the serpent upon the the the serpent the children of god in the in the in the wilderness or the program 37. he said god have brought down the gift of healing to his children maybe never found somebody in whom he can place that gift of healing but he placed that gift of healing upon the serpent just a pre a piece of a breast serpent [Music] it's the same thing but in another form today now listen my brother and sisters as his wife was telling him regardless of the situation in which he found himself job never kissed god inaudible he stayed stood stick to god mcnamara sir now my brothers living in the last days the devil will come to you in different forms with different speeches [Music] he said the devil is our the most enemy first enemy of our god our master and he should stay our enemy forever completion of this school with different speeches just to discourage just to fight you just until the day until or until we all died [Music] those who will never curse god are cause they are suffering because of the suffering across the condition because of the condition of the problem because of the problems across the malaria because of the sicknesses that's what our little subject is if you consider my man upon the earth there's so much memories a people that even if they never eat just can you see la i know here somebody can say i don't want to eat because he doesn't want to eat me it's not the case in other places or other places where we're coming from there talking through the lines and people understand what i'm talking about so god needs such a people whether they are married or not can you present available they may be working or not making perfect fair confidence unto you but those who can put their trust in my confidence and god can have such trust in them we may face themselves yes my brothers and sisters we're living in this country where there is such a corruption homosexuality where we can see homosexuals and all this stuff they are demon in all kind of forms that are deceiving people that are uh or that are impressive or uh treating people may just have a new young people but god knew that we were going to live in the corner god need all the pressure that we should have in these days that's why before the devil comes precipitation god has sent his angels upon thee message of redemption is so that the seed of god may grow in them in these days we may fail themselves yes my sisters that's why we're living with you in this day daniella fairfield the day that daniel have seen daniela they shall and we are in this day about brothers and sisters [Music] the angel of saints oh message that you set them up with the message of the seven days last year are some proper no it is all the quality is a fair benefit there are so many steps they shall receive from that prophet all the benefits [Music] it's not all and the older voices shall be blessed they shall seal and boost their kiss the judaism they shall be a part of the bride of christ of business foreign where god have sent to us the messenger do you know that we are now by the name of william brothers therefore we are my brothers and those that shall receive william brothers in his own name foreign part of the bride of christ in these last days days in which we live in him and negligence it's not a day that we're going to negotiate lost when you see that man the message of the seventh day never compare him with other prophets [Music] sir do you want me to read that foreign like dr price hey the doctor about swerve and dr bosov and the great people that lived in these days all of them were waiting and they prophesied for about these days and this day the day that this church gonna receive or the the manifestation of the presence of danger among them that's in the blue ground in a great portion of it that they've received in their own time if you heard something about it he said oh god listen to me answer to my cry comment please send yourself yes i'm praying the lord jesus come may these people yes you pray and those women around here in this age of people coming in the foundation as you have done it before jewish and submarines that's what my brother and sisters said a large of but in came they a giant if you considered my man upon the earth when you stand in the presence of command jesus jesus was saying [Music] oh the fox have got their houses [Music] by the son of man now okay [Music] you only say that i only had some speeches when you go to oral roberts school it's only species [Music] you preached so good yeah that was right but that vote but in your bible they are telling us about the work that they give us that they're going to lay there and those shall be healed i told them i know somebody in our kingdom say so no sir we are as william branham and he was saved he said god removed this when they asked me the question i was so broken and uh i didn't have any problems but i thought about you see we have a problem this is to what william brother was called for [Music] [Music] to resist that manifestation the manifestation there's some suffering of incentives in a great portion of it in that time says jesus christ amen [Music] [Music] they've done everything that you've done over there just in one evening and this is not brandon who was doing it let's be sure jesus christ in this last night yes my brothers and sisters i'm so happy this morning they appreciate it to those people who are in this country manifested yourself in a great portion [Music] we've never seen others okay listen to spilling ma'am that only the holy spirit will travel working in a man commander and possession how god can take a possession of america make him without making any essentials and those things were happening in the harmony simplicity absolutely in the simplicity absolute simplicity they think that god was focused it was you the people of the last time requirement the believers of the last days [Music] but uh john in the aisle called patmos [Music] he was typifying the messenger of the end time in other places he's saying that john was typifying the church of christ you know when we're preaching we have to keep the balance now listen we're gonna take some time the people that are type of the the messenger of the end time john who's the type of the message of the end time are you saying this is he had to restore going he shall be kept in heaven for restoration of everything and in this time he has to come down there should be [Music] [Music] we are the last people where the book shall end no someone else delivers you we are then we are the book of the redemption destiny this book was intended to us satan the book belongs to us the liberator the redemption book belongs to us i want to say this these people should be a trustworthy people of god gender paper god cannot doubt anything it is all sovereignty foreign through his privilege under his privilege no affair no so now concerns it doesn't make any sense those that shall [Music] because the prophecy of the prophecy said we should shine but today the creation definitely never believers are now darkness legends coward people today if there are there are people that are so close yeah it's a christian man let somebody see us people of course laws and physical laws it is only successful and they've they've had success in everything that they do and us [Music] when they say that this morning is a large person or is somebody who's doing some mystics maybe here people don't understand what i'm saying a man of love tell you that's a national person to commence a worker you start fearing you didn't understand the importance of the message that you've received [Music] moses for him to create flies and everything that you have done just open up the candle of time and you have seen a little man in the bush of colorado and the men who could stand before them or before they brought the prince he said your presence is [Music] moses was under the sacrifice of animals [Music] he only created flies and some other insects they show they can usually pop up things that are not even nice to see i said in your show but in this last days somebody can create amazon and they can eat them [Music] down and why we have already saved their confidence they trust men they trust their confusion we should also a confident man like the stars foreign we've got a courage to come to church every day to sing and god has made us a a great uh the richest nation upon the earth something that's going to help you to do whatever you want to and sir our brothers and sisters look before advocating you are we living in the days of the prophets that other prophets have seen before paulie died 12 in this paul is saying in one corinthians or chapter three if we can see they can project it in english [Music] then we shall discover something according to the grace of god that is given to me i lay the foundation like a wise man wise architect missing a purple keyboard but it's not paul whose building and another one going to build upon it paulie apostle phantom paul just laid the foundation so that another can come and build upon the foundation polity and pulses but pay attention to the way that you're building upon the foundation for comprehension you understand that paul doesn't talk about jesus [Music] so you may pay attention to the way that you're building upon the foundation meant to know but now hello and uncle let us read in english according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have led the foundation i just want you to see right there that it was a wise architect he said another one should build upon it and the one who is going to build up a wise wise master builder that it should be also a wise master builder that's what branham said i know in every i never preached the message to people to make them follow me or to make them attached to [Music] between god and his people a true wish relation people becomes new creations in jesus christ example the son of spirit filled with his spirit living according to his word that's the thing to watch the message that we've received complete the sunny spirit filled with this spirit acting according to his word where you want to go and pray can you enter there in the name of the lord jesus where you want to go let's get to you in that place do you go there with the name of jesus sir my brothers and sisters you upon the foundation laid by god so look at the work of the second quantity and what they are saying what creation of that time is and what we are today [Music] it's only when they give you the holy the confidence then you are a confident man you should be a confident wife of god what i'm saying downtown believe us of that time have you been baptized with the holy ghost somebody's getting upset no certain questions that question is valuable it should be asked from you my friend my brother have you been baptized with the holy ghost since you've been baptized or since you've believed if he said i know i've never been baptized to the holy ghost calm my brother i don't know it's a terrible god in his assembly messenger no but if we come sounds okay without any power you know some of you still come succumb there's a fella and we are like that like orphans come they pray like a ship without master no jesus jesus said i shall never leave you but i shall pray you shall send the comforter [Music] we should work for our salvation with fear but today our salvation is the least thing that we can pay attention to but we want to or complete people that holds our soul suspended upon the hell there's a hair over there with this and our our shoulders the power of god that's what is holding our soul not to not to fall in the hell it is a sin [Music] [Music] people can go somewhere in a restaurant to eat a civ when you found a spider in your in your food plant i think you're gonna open a case against against that restaurant but you will never eat such a food example for example if there's a there's a uh the if there's a cockroach in the food a lady [Music] you never feel to eat that food when you think about it and in the meantime you want to leave are you leaving a band of theologians uh preaching you something that's gonna push you away every millions miles away
