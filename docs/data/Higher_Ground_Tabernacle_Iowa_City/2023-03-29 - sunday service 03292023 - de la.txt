Elizabeth foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] who shall read in English and it came to pass when the Lord was about to take up a Elijah into Heaven by a week that Elijah went with Elisha from from gilgad then Elisha said to Elisha stay here please for the Lord has sent me on the battle but Elisha said as the Lord leaves and as your soul leaves I will not leave you so they went down to Bethel now the sons of the of the Prophet who were at Bethel came out came out to Elisha and said to him do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over there from over you today and he said yes I know keep silent then Elijah said to him Elijah stay here please for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho but he said as the Lord as the Lord leaves and as your souls lives I will not leave you so they came to Jericho now the sons of the Prophet who were a Jericho came to Elisha and said to him do you know that the Lord will take away your master from from over you today so he answered yes I know keep silent then Elijah said to him stay here please for the Lord and send me on today to unto Jordan but he said as the Lord leaves and as your soul lives I will not leave you so two of them went on yeah may the Lord bless the reading of the world we may be seated um first of all I wanna show the change that yeah the subject that we uh we uh [Music] of a larger and Elisha uh cenepa in La Porte We Don't Preach this to show up like uh somebody who knows things we're preaching this subject because we know that the spirit of the Lord has led us into this benediction and from this it may take up to another level of blessings for the church and I would like to let the church know that during this time that we are preaching this kind of preachings if you have something against your brother or sister this is the time to make things right so later the Met really shows are clear this is the time to make to clear things because we can come to church no you know we've got a problem against somebody you just come to listen to the world and go back home like it used to be okay like coming to church became in orbit if you do have a problem against your your brother or your sister I don't know why I'm saying this message but if you feel like the spirit of the Lord is leading you to understand that you've got something against your brother sister after the service you may go out and see your brothers or maybe when you be home try to make things come actually shows try to make things right so that we may see the power of God in this house hello so this morning I want to speak upon the calling of a bride say empathy it's a little subject or the sub-subject sub-subject in our big title in larger in English in line with what we have like oh matters methanol um so we've said with you right here [Music] we've seen that Elijah and Elisha has been the type of the church but I think everyone is feeling good I don't make you sleep right position because I feel like people are taking a position of sleeping [Music] it's like getting ready to sleep okay so if you don't sleep let me see that you don't sleep because if you start sleeping I'll be sleeping too spectacular then you go back home and say what spectacles in today foreign a larger and a large have taken it's same it's the same the one or Christ at the church of tech is left to giggle with Elisha is the prophet is then they say unto him do you know that they must want to take you oh I mean the Lord gonna take your mass over you today yes I know it's so keep silence then they continue their welcome to Jericho dance when they got to Jericho Elijah said the priest stay here please he said as long as your your souls lives and the Lord leaves I will never leave you asked because the Lord was sending Elijah Elijah and Elijah followed Elijah up to up to Jordan when they got to Jordan thought Elisha was going to stay there is that was justification and from Bethel to Jerry sanctification so from together from justification up until the baptism is so these are the three ages of the work of the Great and the church and the Lord have worked with the church the church has died after the Pentacles that it went through sorrows and sufferings and it went through all this pains [Music] that was just foreign baptism of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Ghost s okay foreign 63 he said this is which is the place of Christian confession in Baptist and he said let's stay here it's not for us yeah I felt that confession you've done your confession and you've been baptized so it's enough she said now is Elijah who's telling Elijah I'm going to better thank you foreign it wasn't enough foreign there are people who are once people are just confessing about something [Applause] and people just Rejoice of confessing something only Angie's home by saying I'll just join the church this mic is kind of breaking sometimes and the voice is not clear but honors they've already told us that all this stuff are old and it's no more clear um and we need a new instrument s so if my voice is gone and I don't know how to preach then you're gonna just Rejoice with that the party my voice is going listen to this the prophet said my professional applications most people that are confessing says they just satisfied with her by saying why not to stay here he fell so far apart that's why he said before and your souls lives into the house of God and he found some people foreign the grace never foreign is a Pentecostal meaning started in 1906. that's the restoration he came in until all night and look at life started in 1906. Jamaican Consultants so I want all of us to be together in peace so when the Pentecostal age started and when they've done 50 years started in 1906 as I told you came in 1909. three years after it is to go along with Pentecostals he has to work with them together Coastal people that's why when we get to the age like 1905 19. if you count it's 50 years Pentecostal age get to the end in that time and Brahm start preaching they should be late that's you sir they're returning and the children he preached the junction of time he preached the five Junction of time because of the age of Pentecostals 50 years was the end of Pentecostal age with a message from Pentecostal church I'm not just making some math all Pentecostal people rejected because we're going uh toward 1962. the the the stage the the the the current stage of my Ministry he said everybody is forsaken me foreign [Music] foreign instead approaching the adoption shows that they know for something new sentence that comes after the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when we left we left and brothers which is the identification is to bring us into New Dimensions amen and the blood of Christ why the church still remember the pride is not in Legacy we at least we are in the age is [Applause] now in another day which is the end of the Bride okay cross himself he's the messenger foreign want us to get there upon the Earth being Kings of the circumstance being the master of circumstances something comes before you okay and there's no other way for you to escape you pronounce the words because you've got a book that appropriately I don't care that uh the book in your heart says that's the purpose of this message that churches and the bride is entering into another Dimensions the dimension of the cup story and they became prisoners they became Masters they died nothing can hear them foreign as a bride of Christ Peter could heal the sick people with his Shadows that have received the Blue Bloods you the greatest portion get there for your new Earth what can we be met we should be Masters we should be looking like sick people we should be above all circumstances it's because they've seen software the day in which we lived in these things [Music] to do what they did to do whatever they've done I'm not saying by myself let's read it out [Applause] foreign the fundamental uh Foundation of faith never had this presence you're not Consciousness sometimes you're referring yourself to Moses and to other people and all these other people foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] they were waiting for a coming before then but now we're living in it and now we're living in is coming from and now we are afraid of it issue what did they see they've seen a man from a mountain foreign foreign [Music] what are we doing what are we yes sir my brothers age Pentecost if you don't get me right foreign before you Proclaim yourself believer or Christian that's what I believe I believe in a baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul of a man the Holy Ghost that could make you walk upon sin your sentence the holy ghosts that could make you give him in the nose of God God for my you're like okay spreading a good good good good order is the one that makes you walk holy is his people so I'm gonna go a little bit slow basketball because you know received Commerce it was given to us in two steps first of all Brothers [Music] he had a mission to pull out the bride from the church because there's a church and the bride Elementary and foreign and start talking to the bride decrease say the invisible Union so the brothers husband is the Lord Jesus Christ so William brothers because God wanted to use his body to do that kind of job foreign the book go through the messages the messenger swallow the books is the title this is May our own life become the message Capstone or the Capstone States so what was the job of that Capstone when it comes down was it just to be taking a picture and to leave us like often people no lessons and we say that we believe in the coming of the Capstone no no it's not like that Japanese if it was a Capstone it says to be it's just to descendants in like Elijah and Elisha Elisha never stops he never stationed himself he went across the journey where the Angels were they came down each one of us to be acting that foreign to deceive the people in the end time and the most stood up there he said you know what me I'm gonna go there help them to build the Great churches when they're going to believe in their great churches then they'll be deceived whatever you are a small boy stay there just sit aside time why they are not saved no Los Angeles because you don't drink beer no listen at the bathroom the Holy Ghost never came to stop us from smoking especially in the time that we live in and that's not the fact that they accept no no yes from their houses they don't do adulteries and it doesn't mean they're safe so start from believing I understand this question because you don't drink or you don't smoke so the person that's not the evidence of a Holy Ghost yourself upon that issue but with the Holy Ghost in This last days or a union of measure in every science there's always a Unity of measure kilometers yes before you get to identification if you receive the Holy Ghost she believed same question when we're talking about the Holy Ghost and you're getting angry of preaching is away from the Holy Ghost no you're not far from Hollywood you're not far from Holy Ghost the unity of measure Country Missouri nobody can talk wrong about you but you're doing the will of your master that's where God want to bring the church let's set this seven Series has been opened yes I believe with you but they will not just open in the books seven sins has to be opening in our lives we have received more than Elisha that's the point my brother's sister so things has to be said in this way someone let the power comes out if you don't say you're dead which means we are the seduces Paul avidi and Paul said because the people of that time couldn't get to the profession to profession without us we are the ones that are bringing Perfection those who suffer don't leave those that have opened their homes even if the sunrise without us of Christ we know in half man lost but when the prophet shall come no connection we will know much more the perfectness foreign [Music] that's why and if the thing is a blood of Christ is to repeat that the church manifested through us I could preach about the coming or the descending of the storm but I feel the spirit stopping me from Allah Sunday paragraph 62 it is [Music] it's now standing in the dimension large the land left for more the age of rapture the effect the age of uh that's where the bride is crash in the heart uh um foreign [Music] the same the True Vine [Music] we didn't receive the message foreign churches has received a call to get more Powers but when we found ourselves that was the calling together to get more miracles the police it was a calling to get approval please more more knowledge if a statue of a perfect man you see that the Capstone itself I'm waiting for Israel to project the Capstone at the stage of a perfect man if you notice the Capstone itself it's a pyramid a perfect pyramid but you're gonna see from the top to the basement it's imperfect pyramid get into the Perfection and from there yeah there's always issue foreign [Applause] foreign foreign we can sing it in the right way in order to bring people in prayer meditation and let us sing it
