[56:30] [Music]
[56:46] may the Lord bless you
[56:52] we're gonna read the scripture for the
[56:55] baby dedication
[56:59] in Matthew chapter 19.
[57:02] [Music]
[57:10] we're going to read to show the people
[57:12] that we don't have a Doctrine to baptize
[57:14] children foreign
[57:38] a baby I mean a child
[57:44] even if the child has four five six
[57:48] years
[57:51] you can still bring him to be dedicated
[57:53] to God
[57:58] the prophet would consecrate the
[58:00] children of all ages
[58:03] and not only the baby
[58:08] in Matthew chapter 19 verses
[58:12] verse 13 the Bible says
[58:24] verse 13 then little children were
[58:27] brought to him that he might put
[58:30] he might put his hand on them and pray
[58:32] but the disciples rebuked them foreign
[58:43] but Jesus said let the little children
[58:46] come to me and do not forbid them for
[58:49] for of such is the kingdom of heaven
[58:56] and he laid his hand on them and
[58:59] departed from there
[59:05] you will notice that he's spoken about
[59:07] the little children that were brought to
[59:09] to the Lord Jesus
[59:13] so if you've got a little child that has
[59:16] not been dedicated to God
[59:20] it's your jury to bring him to be
[59:22] dedicated to the Lord amen amen
[59:28] we can still sing that song bring them

[1:00:42] that you give in to the family of
[1:00:45] brother Gideon and sister Clarice if
[1:01:00] somebody
[1:01:02] because you say that the Kingdom of
[1:01:04] Heaven is for such little kids
[1:01:10] while the disciples were rebuking
[1:01:12] children
[1:01:15] you have taken them in your hands and

[1:05:49] ities may the Lord bless you all
[1:05:55] oh
[1:05:58] foreign
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:42] so why are they fixing the sound
[1:06:46] so this uh
[1:06:48] today is my last day
[1:06:51] like I said last Sunday
[1:06:56] from tomorrow I'll be taking my flight
[1:06:59] to go back to Africa
[1:07:02] I
[1:07:08] also thank the pastor for the trust that
[1:07:11] they did unto me
[1:07:14] and also thank the brothers who invited
[1:07:17] me in their homes
[1:07:19] for the fellowship
[1:07:25] again today I'm litigating I just
[1:07:29] dedicated the baby of Gladys
[1:07:33] she's also the first generation of a
[1:07:37] Sunday School in my church foreign
[1:08:01] so you gotta pray for your church
[1:08:05] you go to church where there's more
[1:08:07] young people
[1:08:09] so they need the leadership
[1:08:14] not only young people but all of you you
[1:08:18] need somebody who's guiding you I know
[1:08:21] you got a pastor
[1:08:23] who's in Des Moines
[1:08:26] sometimes it's also busy
[1:08:31] but God is able to answer to this to the
[1:08:34] desires of your heart
[1:08:37] if only you can be serious with
[1:08:39] everything that you're doing
[1:08:42] you're gonna be on time at church
[1:08:47] that's the first thing the prophet is
[1:08:50] recommending the the questions
[1:08:56] he says Believers or Christians should
[1:08:59] be at a church 30 minutes before the
[1:09:01] opening of the service
[1:09:04] can you say Amen to that
[1:09:08] so you're going to be here exactly at 10
[1:09:11] A.M
[1:09:15] while at 10 30 the song leader comes up
[1:09:19] here and the service says
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:27] and the service may take up to three
[1:09:30] songs before the preaching
[1:09:35] because now we almost 12 a.m at 12.
[1:09:41] it's uh it's almost 12. okay
[1:09:45] we didn't even read the word of God yet
[1:09:49] a regular system in this issue with the
[1:09:51] shift with the system that you have here
[1:09:53] of working ships
[1:09:56] while the preaching you start looking at
[1:09:58] a time they are not the only shifts that
[1:10:00] you saw because there are those who have
[1:10:02] to work around
[1:10:04] um in the afternoon
[1:10:06] so all of that we've got to pay
[1:10:09] attention to that
[1:10:10] okay
[1:10:30] because when they talk about the church
[1:10:33] is two or three people
[1:10:35] they cook with the family but if there's
[1:10:38] already a change in which these couples
[1:10:41] families
[1:10:43] so just ask your trusty brother Valerie
[1:10:48] this is
[1:10:51] I never started the church with married
[1:10:54] people
[1:10:56] I was the only one married couple
[1:11:01] it down called Congo and the second
[1:11:03] married man his wife was still back in
[1:11:05] Congo
[1:11:09] all the brothers that I started church
[1:11:11] with they were just singles
[1:11:14] I understood getting them married one by
[1:11:18] one
[1:11:20] so today just looked the age of Crystal
[1:11:24] she's already a big girl
[1:11:28] to tell you that in five years
[1:11:31] or maybe 10 years if God still give us
[1:11:34] time
[1:11:36] all these children to be responsible
[1:11:41] and this is going to be a small hall for
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:45] so you got to work for the church
[1:11:49] and you gotta work in love
[1:11:51] and immunity
[1:11:54] so I'm going back tomorrow
[1:11:58] because I have a convention that I have
[1:12:01] to uh to lead on on the 15th
[1:12:05] President and I also need your prayers
[1:12:10] and all your support
[1:12:12] possible support you can do right Amen
[1:12:16] Let Us stand and read the word of God
[1:12:28] we shall read the same scriptures we
[1:12:31] read last Sunday
[1:12:33] but like don't believe that the number
[1:12:36] of people in the Book of Numbers Chapter
[1:12:39] 19. foreign
[1:13:13] foreign
[1:13:20] spoke to Moses and Aaron saying this is
[1:13:24] the ordinance of the law which the Lord
[1:13:27] is commanded saying speak to the
[1:13:29] children of Israel
[1:13:30] that they bring you a red heifer without
[1:13:34] blemish
