[0:15] hello when
[0:17] god told us
[0:20] after she laughed
[0:24] a son
[0:28] and being in her old age
[0:33] she couldn't see it possible
[0:36] hallelujah
[0:37] even now
[0:39] some of us don't see it
[0:42] we can't comprehend
[0:57] where god met sarah would you ever fake
[1:00] yourself hallelujah amen it was a
[1:02] personal time
[1:04] it was a private time
[1:07] that god met sarah did you affirmatively
[1:09] hallelujah that's why i read that
[1:12] scripture
[1:14] in romans
[1:15] when god said oh jesus cheryl shall have
[1:19] a son
[1:22] promise this was a promise
[1:35] he said this was like unto the rapture
[1:43] [Music]
[2:06] that he had not done before
[2:10] he changed her dna
[2:15] because she could not have children
[2:19] hallelujah so if god had just only
[2:21] brought it back to a young girl
[2:24] it would not have worked
[2:27] hallelujah but god was saying
[2:31] the message
[2:33] that i gave
[2:34] to
[3:30] to understand
[4:12] so how
[4:40] holy
[5:05] it is a word that cannot die
[5:08] in the paper
[5:09] [Music]
[5:18] [Music]
[5:23] how do you
[5:25] how do you surrender
[5:27] i say you surrender
[5:29] by letting go
[5:31] come on let it go
[5:36] hallelujah
[5:39] you say i'm going to i'm not going to
[5:41] eat fried chicken anymore
[5:48] right
[5:50] the chicken fried chicken is not going
[5:52] to disappear
[5:55] fried chicken is not going to disappear
[6:00] because you said you're not going to eat
[6:02] it anymore
[6:18] go
[6:21] into return
[6:23] hallelujah
[6:24] the only way it's going to get you
[6:27] is that you go to the place
[6:30] where they're selling for our chickens
[7:14] what
[7:28] what did the rod do
[7:30] aaron's rod guess your lip balm when it
[7:32] was in the holidays of holies
[7:38] it did nothing
[8:23] it is the message that changes you
[8:26] but if you don't read it
[8:28] if you don't study it if you don't
[8:30] listen to it
[8:34] but if you stay in the presence of this
[8:36] message
[8:37] it will change
[8:48] hallelujah amen now watch this may not
[8:50] regardless
[8:51] because when jesus rose from the dead
[8:56] before he rose from the dead
[8:59] it was a public show
[9:04] hallelujah
[9:06] the pharisees saw it the sadducees
[9:10] hallelujah the horrorians saw it
[9:14] all that believed in jehovah saw it
[9:18] even samaritans saw it but let
[10:02] and they failed
[10:17] may hello after the resurrection of
[10:19] resurrection
[10:22] he only goes to the elected
[10:26] the ministry changes
[10:29] did it not
[10:59] and what did he preach
[11:02] he didn't preach moses inappropriately
[11:04] he didn't preach elijah
[11:06] hallelujah but he took those prophets
[11:09] everything they said
[11:12] jesus
[11:26] amen hallelujah amen that's right
[11:31] in the easter seal
[11:34] a true uh mount transfigure revelations
[11:44] only glorifies
[11:46] jesus christ seth montana glorification
[11:49] does not glorify moses
[11:51] if he doesn't glorify elijah
[11:53] he doesn't glorify himself and glorify
[11:56] the church hallelujah there's only one
[12:01] persuasion
[12:02] and if you can't do that you need to
[12:04] repent
[12:07] that's where your victory is victor
[12:10] hallelujah
[12:12] your victory is not in it
