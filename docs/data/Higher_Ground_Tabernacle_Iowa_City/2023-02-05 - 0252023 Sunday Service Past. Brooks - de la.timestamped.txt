[48:25] yes
[48:43] [Music]
[48:52] we try to uh
[48:55] and get everybody to see who they are
[48:57] and where they are so
[49:01] [Music]
[49:05] when we think about what God has done in
[49:08] these last days
[49:12] we must understand that the word of God
[49:15] itself
[49:18] is creating a bride and Craig
[49:22] for the the translation translation
[49:27] brother banham taught us how
[49:30] he was building a house
[49:33] there are times when you have to turn a
[49:36] corner yeah
[49:38] and I believe the message that God
[49:41] brought
[49:43] at the opening of the word
[49:46] came to came to make us
[49:52] turn a corner
[49:56] I find out that in the way I preach
[50:02] some people don't like it
[50:05] and then there are those who do yeah
[50:09] so you can better understand me
[50:12] I only come to preach to the bride
[50:17] and I know that the word of God that God
[50:20] has given me is
[50:27] I'm going to say a few things
[50:30] and I want you to fully understand what
[50:33] I'm saying
[50:35] because oftentimes
[50:39] some think
[50:41] when I speak I'm preaching against
[50:43] brother Branham cause your pressure
[50:47] God forbid
[50:51] God forbid
[50:58] well you see the devil is fighting this
[51:00] message
[51:04] but that's okay I'm gonna preach it
[51:07] anyway
[51:09] just lick my voice
[51:12] but I'm going to preach with what I have
[51:15] because I want you to understand I want
[51:17] you to see something
[51:20] when brother Branham walked the Earth
[51:23] that generation has something that we
[51:26] did didn't have
[51:28] questions they had brother Branham
[51:32] they had a man
[51:35] feel they could touch they could go to
[51:39] uh fishing with long time they would
[51:42] have a wonderful time with the prophet
[51:45] of God
[51:47] but when brother Branham left
[51:50] we don't have brother branna please
[51:53] foreign
[51:57] y'all hear what I'm saying
[51:59] God didn't leave us empty-handed
[52:04] he gave us the creator of the prophets
[52:10] hallelujah amen so we are in a time
[52:14] that we must listen to the message
[52:18] there is no such thing
[52:20] I'm in the message
[52:23] and I don't listen to those thought that
[52:26] voice on the tapes
[52:28] oh I don't read the books
[52:31] oh I don't read my Bible Hallelujah
[52:36] It Is by this voice
[52:39] Jesus Christ is creating his bride yes
[52:44] Hallelujah
[52:46] the message when it came it opened the
[52:50] book
[52:52] Hallelujah and when the book was open
[52:56] we got the fullness of God
[53:01] we got the Alpha and the Omega
[53:06] the Old Testament the New Testament and
[53:10] the message that that caps off the old
[53:13] and the News
[53:15] Hallelujah in other words the New
[53:19] Testament it's the revelation of the Old
[53:22] Testament
[53:23] and the open book or the revelation of
[53:27] this message
[53:28] hallelujah it's the revelation of the
[53:31] New Testament
[53:33] Hallelujah three right it all works in
[53:37] three
[53:38] Hallelujah you can't just work with the
[53:41] old you know
[53:50] [Applause]
[54:01] we have come to a place in this age
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:19] Hallelujah but it's also
[54:22] the age of God's bitter judgment
[54:26] Hallelujah if we cannot see that the
[54:31] world is under judgment is you're
[54:34] missing the whole point Hallelujah
[54:37] [Music]
[54:38] and the only people said this word will
[54:42] not judge
[54:44] but those who are under the blood says
[54:47] hallelujah I didn't say those who think
[54:50] they are under the blood I said those
[54:53] who are under the blood
[54:55] Hallelujah because what people need to
[54:58] see is that The Mercy Seat changes
[55:02] positions
[55:04] the mercy sheep changes its position uh
[55:11] right
[55:25] behind the veil
[55:28] but the mercy she moved
[55:32] Hallelujah from the the the the
[55:35] representation
[55:40] to the genuine Mercy Seat just go oh
[55:51] and Jesus Christ when he rose again
[55:55] he took the blood and he put it on The
[56:00] Mercy Seat in heaven
[56:02] y'all hear what I'm saying so the
[56:05] mercies of God was throughout all the
[56:08] churches
[56:10] but something happened at the opening of
[56:14] the word
[56:15] the mercy Street moves
[56:19] Hallelujah we need to understand
[56:24] Hallelujah as a prophet of God
[56:27] let the Bride of Jesus Christ is the
[56:31] blood of Jesus Christ
[56:32] by the spirit Hallelujah
[56:36] Church
[56:58] with this on a Sunday
[57:01] bride of Jesus Christ
[57:05] no holy day
[57:08] Hallelujah
[57:11] because we realize
[57:14] the Sabbath is not the Saturday
[57:17] and brother Brandon said the Sabbath is
[57:19] not the Sunday everybody
[57:25] amen come unto me
[57:28] come unto me oh ye the lady I
[57:35] will give you rest
[57:37] I will give you rest for your soul
[57:44] amen
[57:49] even though
[57:51] the word of God said I Fearless some of
[57:54] you
[57:55] will not enter into the rest
[58:06] oh you get the Holy Ghost but you've got
[58:10] a labor to get in there you got to press
[58:13] to get in there is that right the Bible
[58:16] is at the kingdom of God
[58:19] silence
[58:21] suffereth violence
[58:25] but the violence take it
[58:29] my subject this morning
[58:32] is follow those bloody Footprints
[58:38] who are who I believe who are the
[58:40] Believers
[58:41] he saw the question we say we are the
[58:43] Believers
[58:44] those of us who are eating the Flesh and
[58:48] drinking the blood take your mind of the
[58:51] son of man
[58:52] Hallelujah am I eating the Flesh and
[58:56] drinking the blood of the son of man
[58:59] literally places us back into Eden
[59:02] Hallelujah
[59:04] so I want you to understand
[59:09] the only thing Adam and Eve had I ever
[59:13] been for for guidance
[59:16] for instructions
[59:19] was the voice of God what did you they
[59:23] didn't have no books they didn't have no
[59:26] tapes
[59:29] Hallelujah
[59:38] [Applause]
[59:48] he's the sons of God
[59:52] hallelujah amen we're free from all
[59:55] Creeds
[1:00:01] free from all prison systems
[1:00:05] I said from all prison systems
[1:00:09] your church can be a prison system the
[1:00:13] prison is you heard what I said I said
[1:00:16] your church can be a prison system
[1:00:22] so the person system
[1:00:26] it can shackle but like this is the
[1:00:28] prison
[1:00:29] You Can Be Your Own Prison
[1:00:33] Awards
[1:00:35] see because when the spirit of God tells
[1:00:38] you to move
[1:00:40] God says hallelujah
[1:00:45] everybody no one else is moving because
[1:00:49] no one else is saying hallelujah
[1:00:51] hallelujah
[1:00:55] your communion with God is fake Jesus
[1:01:02] I'm coming I'm coming by the grace of
[1:01:05] God
[1:01:07] hallelujah amen
[1:01:10] the prophet God says in communion yes
[1:01:17] in 1962 he says
[1:01:20] God ever sends his power to the church
[1:01:24] of the church
[1:01:25] if God shouldn't ever sends his power to
[1:01:28] the church
[1:01:30] it'll be his grace
[1:01:33] It Won't Be The Obedience of the people
[1:01:39] hallelujah all right you know all y'all
[1:01:41] should have said Hallelujah
[1:01:44] because none of us continually measure
[1:01:48] up the paper say misery it takes the
[1:01:51] Great

[1:05:07] I forgot who brother Brandon was talking
[1:05:09] to
[1:05:11] but he was saying that easy to those who
[1:05:15] was following him uh secular he says see
[1:05:18] those bloody Footprints
[1:05:23] it was false I can take you
[1:05:43] when God

[1:05:51] performed
[1:06:01] Hallelujah and you had to Father John

[1:09:46] our service is really a memorial service
[1:09:49] Memorial
[1:09:53] hallelujah amen

[1:35:43] Corinthians four uh

[1:35:53] but if our gospel be hid
[1:35:56] it is here to them that are lost
[1:36:04] in whom the god of the this world have
[1:36:07] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:36:09] not a seriously
[1:36:19] who is the image of God should shine
[1:36:21] unto them
[1:36:26] pay attention to this
[1:36:30] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[1:36:33] Christ
[1:36:34] is the image of God
[1:36:39] who is the image of God
[1:36:41] did you shine unto them yes
[1:36:47] when he's preaching keep pressure while
[1:36:50] he's preaching he's supposed to give you
[1:36:53] the image of Christ
[1:36:57] for we preach not ourselves that's what
[1:36:59] Paul said
[1:37:00] but Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:37:05] ourselves for your Servants of Jesus
[1:37:07] Christ
[1:37:16] I'm gonna say this you should put skin
[1:37:18] and then then I'm gonna go ahead and
[1:37:19] close because of the time
[1:37:25] let me read the scripture first and then
[1:37:27] I explained
[1:37:29] Corinthians
[1:37:30] 11th chapter uh
[1:37:33] two through four
[1:37:35] decorations
[1:37:39] for I am jealous over you with Godly
[1:37:42] jealousy
[1:37:47] for I have exposed you to one husband
[1:37:53] that I might may present you as a chaste
[1:37:57] virgin to Christ
[1:38:04] but I fear
[1:38:06] blessed by any means
[1:38:09] as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:38:12] substitute
[1:38:16] so your mind should be corrupted thank
[1:38:19] you foreign
[1:38:39] whom we have not preached
[1:38:43] Paul didn't preach himself he preached
[1:38:45] Jesus Jesus
[1:38:53] which you have not received
[1:38:58] but you have not accepted he might well
[1:39:02] bear with him
[1:39:05] you know the Corinthians took advantage
[1:39:08] of the people
[1:39:11] you know they there were times the
[1:39:13] Corinthians with different ones would
[1:39:15] have such Authority they could slap a
[1:39:17] person again
[1:39:24] they were Christians like the prophet
[1:39:27] God said
[1:39:29] but the anointing Has Lifted from us
[1:39:32] but we're Christians and he said the
[1:39:36] only way you're gonna get a Revival
[1:39:39] go wake Jesus
[1:39:44] it ain't good it's not he said they
[1:39:47] talked about the Revival
[1:39:49] with Jesus
[1:39:57] and then when he did come on this one
[1:40:00] time yeah
[1:40:03] they were not even able to identify the
[1:40:06] Holy Spirit
[1:40:20] but let me say this statement
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:41] and that thing carried on
[1:40:44] even to John the Baptist and Jesus
[1:40:50] Jesus came to John the Baptist
[1:40:53] John the Baptist says
[1:41:21] when John
[1:41:25] Batista pointed to Jesus
[1:41:30] disciples
[1:41:35] take away the sins of the
[1:41:38] world
[1:41:39] Amen the Bible says only
[1:41:44] disciples
[1:41:49] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:41:51] so is the message
[1:41:53] only two yeah
[1:41:57] since the seals were open
[1:42:00] Jesus
[1:42:01] everybody stayed with John hey
