[27:37] Well, there's spirits good here this
[27:38] evening and God bless you. Uh musicians,
[27:41] I'm I'm done here. If you want to open
[27:44] your Bibles,
[27:45] uh let's go to Acts 3:
[27:53] If they would put on the up for us
[27:55] Jeremiah 29:13.
[27:59] Solomon, is your is your wife here?
[28:04] She's doing sound somewhere. Okay. Well,
[28:06] Lily, you're back there in the back and
[28:08] I just wanted to wish you a very special
[28:11] happy birthday.
[28:13] Today is her birthday. So, would give
[28:15] her a hand clap and
[28:18] she can hear you, I'm sure.
[28:21] Very grateful. I was I saw their
[28:23] birthday on the calendar today and I was
[28:25] just just reminiscing of um counseling
[28:29] with her and Solomon before their their
[28:33] marriage and just how much I enjoyed
[28:35] getting to know both of them better and
[28:37] and just uh just complimenting their
[28:40] their hearts were just fully open. They
[28:42] were wanting the very best for life, for
[28:45] marriage, for one another. And you know
[28:47] that's just two two special people a
[28:49] special heart there. So,
[28:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Lily. So, I just I was
[28:54] inspired and so I thought I'd read it
[28:56] again. Brother Paul read this on Sunday.
[28:58] Jeremiah 29:13.
[29:00] And ye shall seek me and find me when
[29:02] you shall search for me with all your
[29:05] heart.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; And that's just I want to open with that
[29:09] in Acts 3:19.
[29:11] Repent ye therefore and be converted
[29:14] that your sins may be blotted out when
[29:16] the times of refreshing shall come from
[29:20] the presence of the Lord. And he shall
[29:22] send Jesus Christ which before was
[29:24] preached whom the heaven must receive
[29:27] until the times of restitution. And that
[29:30] restitution is restoration to perfect
[29:33] state before the fall.
[29:36] restitution of all things which God has
[29:38] spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets
[29:41] since the world began. Let's pray.
[29:43] Heavenly Father, we come before you,
[29:45] Lord, and we're just grateful for your
[29:47] presence on a midweek service, Lord.
[29:50] You're just to come into it anytime, but
[29:53] that you would meet us here in this
[29:54] place as we come to sit at your feet.
[29:58] Lord, my prayer all day has been that
[30:00] you'd just help me to get out of the
[30:01] way, that you'd speak to your people and
[30:04] give them what they need. And so we just
[30:06] ask God that you'd bless your word now.
[30:08] Bless the people's hearts. And Lord, let
[30:10] it not return void as you promised in
[30:14] Jesus' name. And Lord, also I just want
[30:17] to remember our pastor just that you
[30:18] would completely restore his strength
[30:20] and health in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[30:25] Well, God bless you. You can be seated
[30:26] tonight. Um,
[30:30] just good to see you on a Wednesday
[30:31] night just looking around and seeing
[30:33] everyone's faces and brother Francis,
[30:36] Sister Rachel, good to have you back.
[30:38] God bless you and everybody and all the
[30:41] little ones that are giving their
[30:43] parents trouble and God bless you
[30:47] parents for that.
[30:49] So, I just I want to I want to just go
[30:51] back into um maybe I'm bad at setting
[30:54] titles, I don't know, but I just just
[30:55] that whole thought of times of
[30:57] refreshing again. And just just look at
[31:00] it from another angle that has been on
[31:02] my heart for some time. And um I'll I'll
[31:05] you've heard me talk a little bit about
[31:07] um kind of what gave me the direction,
[31:09] but I just thought I'd let you know
[31:11] where I'm coming from, and it also kind
[31:13] of helps lay a foundation for what I
[31:15] want to get into. But uh what turned me
[31:17] on to this thought um and is
[31:21] just as as I went to my grandmother's
[31:24] funeral years ago seeing all of the
[31:27] Italians that I hadn't seen since I was
[31:29] a little boy. Um it, you know, since
[31:33] family reunions and and as we were
[31:36] standing there, you know, my my uh dad's
[31:38] godfather uh is named Cosmo Valente. And
[31:42] I just wish I had a cool name like that,
[31:44] but Cosmo Valente. and just I mean maybe
[31:48] I don't know he was probably middle of
[31:49] my chest you know and he just walks up
[31:51] and you know I shared with you he told
[31:54] my dad is that your boy he talked just
[31:56] like that too that's your boy that's a
[31:58] fine boy
[32:00] and uh so I just I I just got to just
[32:03] realizing in in that moment seeing all
[32:06] of them that you know my grandmother was
[32:08] passed away which she didn't speak a
[32:10] whole lot of Italian but you know she
[32:12] she understood it Um but even she the
[32:17] just that understanding kind of left her
[32:19] because the generation who spoke it had
[32:22] all gone.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; And so she had actually lost a little
[32:25] bit of it. And so I just realized
[32:27] standing there, you know, looking around
[32:29] my my dad and my aunts and uncles and I
[32:31] thought, well, they understand it. They
[32:33] can speak a little bit of it. I have no
[32:34] clue. And then I just got to thinking,
[32:37] I'm the third generation from my
[32:39] grandfather who spoke full Italian,
[32:41] broken English, you know, that's it was,
[32:44] you know, instead of what's what's
[32:45] wrong? What's what's the matter? It was
[32:46] what's the matter you and you know, it
[32:48] was just very heavy, thick accent and
[32:51] and broken English. And, you know, just
[32:54] kind of kind of interesting. My my
[32:57] grandparents came over on the boat from
[32:59] Italy. So, they were first generation
[33:02] first generation Italians come over on
[33:04] the boat from Italy. They only spoke
[33:05] Italian, not a not a lick of English. Uh
[33:09] grandparents, particularly my
[33:10] grandfather, as I said, spoke broken. Uh
[33:13] mostly Italian. And then um kind of a
[33:17] funny story just just as I'm getting
[33:19] into this, you know, just the first
[33:21] generation, second generation, third
[33:23] generation, that's kind of where I'm
[33:24] headed. But you know, this Cosmo
[33:27] Valente, he um he he come over as a boy.
[33:30] um you know, Germany was coming into
[33:32] Italy and um you know, attacking Italy
[33:36] and so they were starting to do the
[33:38] recruiting and so they got him out just
[33:41] in time to miss the the Italian army
[33:43] draft and I think he was just a young
[33:45] young man, maybe even a boy. And uh so
[33:48] they got him out, he comes over to the
[33:50] US and he gets drafted into the US Army.
[33:53] It's kind of ironic, but you know, in in
[33:56] Italian, non capisco means I don't
[33:58] understand. and and uh so he's standing
[34:00] there and the general is telling him
[34:02] which way go you go this way you go this
[34:04] way and he gets to them and if they
[34:06] didn't speak English and couldn't
[34:08] understand it they went to the
[34:09] translating line and if they could
[34:11] understand it even if they really didn't
[34:13] speak it they went to the you know
[34:15] you're going to war line and uh so he
[34:17] knew that and he walks up and they said
[34:19] well you know do you understand no
[34:21] kapiscoco no kapiscoco and he said okay
[34:23] go to this line so he started to walk
[34:25] and he said hey wait a second you
[34:26] understood that get over there And this
[34:29] is kind of a funny story, but uh you
[34:32] know the first generation Italians and
[34:33] they the the things that they had to go
[34:35] through, you know, to to try to avoid
[34:37] the war over there, to get on a boat, to
[34:39] come here to not not just avoiding civil
[34:41] war, but to to try to have a better life
[34:44] and and and the things that they had to
[34:46] struggle through and the things that
[34:48] they had to go through. and and and then
[34:50] you know the next generation got to
[34:52] enjoy those benefits of of even even him
[34:55] and my grandfather going to war and
[34:57] fighting in war and then the next
[34:59] generation just just you know we didn't
[35:02] they didn't have to do that and and I
[35:04] didn't have to do that but they went and
[35:06] fought for freedom and for liberty and
[35:08] they paved the way so to speak for the
[35:10] generations to come and and for the rest
[35:13] of the family even even you know like
[35:15] like you know sister Ununice and and uh
[35:18] different ones from Africa today, you
[35:21] know, you you come here, you you get
[35:22] established, you know, you do everything
[35:24] you can and then, you know, Lord
[35:26] willing, hopefully they start bringing
[35:28] family members over and and so that's
[35:31] what my family did um from Italy, slowly
[35:34] bringing bringing people over. But so
[35:37] it's just that that's that first
[35:38] generation and how they had to strive
[35:41] and and toil. Then I remember something
[35:44] brother Homer Loria said and now that
[35:46] that's a very natural thing that I'm
[35:48] talking about is just the Italian
[35:50] language, the Italian culture and you
[35:52] know my grandfather was a was a great
[35:54] cook and uh passed away and some of that
[35:57] went with him. Um, you know, we still
[35:59] got good cooks in the family, but some
[36:01] of the very specific things he'd make,
[36:03] my dad still, you know, would tear up
[36:05] talking about and could still smell it
[36:07] and everything. And it's it's kind of
[36:08] gone with him, but kind of kind of
[36:11] something Brother Homer said and and we
[36:14] were talking and I said, you know, I
[36:15] remember you said this and can you tell
[36:17] me where it was? Well, he sent it to me
[36:19] and it's a statement from a book and it
[36:21] says it only takes about two generations
[36:23] for everything to be forgotten,
[36:25] especially if it's not told over and
[36:27] over again.
[36:29] And so I just got to begin to start
[36:32] looking at this a little bit deeper and
[36:33] and started wondering about it and
[36:36] started kind of seeing patterns in
[36:38] different things, different places
[36:40] until, you know, tonight you get to
[36:42] hopefully be a beneficiary of it. and
[36:44] and uh but so I begin to see this three
[36:47] generation principle in a lot of places
[36:50] but what I begin to see even more was
[36:53] that three generation principle in in
[36:55] our message that we enjoy today
[36:58] and you start watching the the
[37:00] generations that my generation the the
[37:02] the generation above me and you just you
[37:05] just start watching and and picking out
[37:07] these different things and so I'm going
[37:08] to share that with you this evening and
[37:09] so just kind of naturally speaking on
[37:12] this third generation rule if a woman
[37:14] smokes, her ch her children are more
[37:16] likely to have asthma, but her
[37:18] grandchildren are more likely to have
[37:20] asthma with nasal allergies. Very
[37:23] natural, very practical. What's that got
[37:26] to do with anything? The third
[37:27] generation is actually worse off than
[37:30] even the second generation. And she
[37:32] might not have had asthma being in the
[37:34] smoker firsthand. She might not have had
[37:36] anything. But what she's passing down to
[37:38] generation is it's progressively getting
[37:40] worse. So
[37:43] there's even more lost in the health in
[37:45] the third generation. And there's
[37:46] there's a saying of wealthy families
[37:49] from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves.
[37:51] Wealthy families are in danger of losing
[37:53] their wealth by the third generation.
[37:55] There's actually a 90% uh now they say
[37:59] research shows and then they say no that
[38:01] research is wrong and then they turn
[38:03] around and they give all the things that
[38:04] the wealthy family needs to do so that
[38:06] the research is wrong. So I'm going to
[38:09] go with it's right. But research shows
[38:11] 90% of families would fall to the three
[38:13] generational curse they call it. They
[38:16] say now the research was wrong. But then
[38:18] they give the details. So by the third
[38:20] generation, the second generation is
[38:23] kind of enjoying the wealth. They're
[38:25] they're, you know, not not doing as much
[38:27] with it, but they're enjoying it. And by
[38:29] the third generation, they're full-blown
[38:31] enjoying it to to the extent that they
[38:33] actually start losing it.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, um,
[38:38] I I just I got to thinking about our
[38:40] country and the state that we're in now
[38:42] and, uh, you know, after after
[38:44] everything that happened with Charlie
[38:45] Kirk and listening to some of his
[38:47] debates and things and just just the
[38:48] history that he would talk about and and
[38:51] I just thought, my look at look at how
[38:53] our history has has gone by the wayside.
[38:57] Our country is in the state it's in
[38:58] because the thoughts, ideas, and beliefs
[39:00] of the founding fathers have been lost
[39:02] through the years. They might have sat
[39:04] down and they might have said, you know,
[39:06] this is what we did. We fought we fought
[39:08] hard for this. We we we terried all
[39:11] night and we we wrote the the
[39:13] Constitution. We wrote the the
[39:15] Declaration of Independence. We decided
[39:17] 13 colonies and we toiled all night
[39:19] writing a constitution for each
[39:21] individual colony. And so this is what I
[39:23] was thinking when we wrote this. This
[39:25] was the thoughts behind it. This is this
[39:27] is what our intent was behind writing it
[39:30] this way. and and and so the second
[39:33] generation would have heard that and by
[39:36] the third generation they might have got
[39:37] some of it but maybe by then there's
[39:40] other political views coming into play
[39:42] in the country and in in in just the
[39:45] general politics and so by then the
[39:47] third generation starts getting maybe a
[39:49] little bit of what the first generation
[39:51] shared but then they start it starts
[39:54] getting I don't want to say tainted but
[39:56] if I can just put it that way it starts
[39:57] getting tainted from the second
[39:59] generation now The third generation is
[40:02] looking at writings and and and
[40:05] historical events that have have a twist
[40:08] on them that that it's it's it's truth
[40:10] but not quite the whole truth. Not quite
[40:13] what the founding father what that first
[40:15] generation intended it for to be.
[40:17] Something got lost. So history starts
[40:20] being rewritten and and the opinions and
[40:23] politics get interjection in the truth.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; In truth. And I want you to catch that.
[40:28] In truth. And then the truth starts to
[40:30] become a little bit fuzzy.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; So the so the second generation's
[40:37] uh uh let me just skip some of this cuz
[40:39] we're we're moving along.
[40:41] Um elements of the truth get lost and
[40:43] misrepresented to where the third
[40:45] generation the true history is
[40:47] unrecognizable.
[40:49] Then you come to today and we have a
[40:52] generation today that's enslaved by
[40:54] lies.
[40:56] They have we have gender confusion. We
[40:58] have sexual orientation confusion
[41:01] because the original thoughts of God
[41:03] stopped being taught and spoken. So the
[41:06] original thoughts of God got lost. And
[41:08] that's just in a natural sense behind
[41:11] when they said, you know, the when just
[41:14] everything they wrote in the
[41:15] constitution when they wrote that that's
[41:17] that's getting lost. That's just a
[41:19] natural sense of speaking.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; But you can start seeing where I'm going
[41:23] with this. So the natural types, the
[41:26] spiritual, and if you could pull up that
[41:27] first slide for me.
[41:30] So these are the different generations,
[41:32] the years of birth and things. And so um
[41:36] you know, we can see the the boomers
[41:40] uh born all the way up to 64. So uh
[41:44] generation X there after 65. So that
[41:46] would be the the end of the life of the
[41:48] prophet. So if you stick the prophet in
[41:51] there between boomers and generation X
[41:54] then you have three generations you you
[41:56] come to the way I was thinking of it is
[41:58] you have let's just use brother John La
[42:01] Fontaine for example brother John Laf
[42:04] Fontaine would be first generation from
[42:06] the prophet he he he was in some of the
[42:09] meetings maybe he heard the prophet he
[42:11] he he had the tapes fresh from recording
[42:14] and then you have brother Paul second
[42:17] generation
[42:19] then You have my generation, Solomon,
[42:22] Gideon, third third generation.
[42:25] So, where are we at in time? What my my
[42:28] concern tonight is what are we in danger
[42:31] of?
[42:33] And and I might not get to everything I
[42:35] want to. So, I I'm I'm not wanting to
[42:38] leave you anything like a hanging over
[42:40] hell or anything like that, but it might
[42:42] just be a come to Jesus night.
[42:45] It might be just a night where you
[42:46] realize, God, we we're in need of
[42:48] something.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; I'll bandage you up later sometime,
[42:54] but 1963. So, you you can take that down
[42:57] for now. So, this this is my mind. This
[42:59] is where my mind's going. This is what
[43:01] I'm what I'm seeing. What's what's the
[43:03] generation, you know, the uh sitting and
[43:05] listening to to second generation speak
[43:09] about, you know, my generation and the
[43:12] generation under? Well, well, are are
[43:14] they in the word? Are they in the
[43:16] message? And when I look at my own life,
[43:18] I have to say, um, I try, but yeah, no,
[43:22] not like they were. And so, you see, you
[43:25] start you start losing something as you
[43:27] go through from generation to
[43:28] generation. There was there was an
[43:30] original revival. There was original
[43:32] fire there. And as you get generation to
[43:35] generation, if each generation doesn't
[43:38] take up the mantle and get into it for
[43:40] themselves, then something's lost. You
[43:43] actually you truth starts becoming
[43:45] skewed because they're not in it for
[43:47] themselves. We're we're not we're not in
[43:49] it for ourselves. We have so many
[43:52] distractions. I won't won't get into it
[43:54] as much tonight, but there's actually
[43:56] things called information overload. We
[43:58] live in the information uh what how do
[44:01] they say the um digital information age
[44:05] and and and we're in such an age that's
[44:07] so full of of digital of of of screens
[44:11] of of of constant noise and and and of
[44:16] constant bombardment of information that
[44:18] you actually can get information
[44:20] overload which we probably suffer more
[44:22] than what we realize to where you
[44:24] actually cannot take in any more
[44:27] information. So by the time you get to
[44:29] Wednesday night and the preacher's up
[44:32] preaching, you actually your mind has
[44:34] taken in so much through the day that
[44:37] you know we we're we're talking we're
[44:39] we're preaching to a more tired people
[44:41] than we've ever preached to. Brother
[44:43] Brandham said that how much more today
[44:46] when we have so much information, so
[44:48] much bombardment constantly all
[44:51] throughout the day to where we get to
[44:53] Wednesday, we get to Sunday morning and
[44:56] we're just oh my my my mind just oh it's
[44:59] just so tired. My mind is so tired. I
[45:02] don't know if I can consume anymore. But
[45:04] we come we try and then you know
[45:06] minister brother Paul's up here laboring
[45:08] and preaching and and you know is it is
[45:10] it reaching the people?
[45:12] Well, that's why you have to take that
[45:14] and go home with it.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; You can't just get it here. You have to
[45:18] go home. You have to be throughout the
[45:19] week. So,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; most Americans believe in God and claim
[45:24] to be Christian. But the rest of the
[45:26] story, I don't know why they wrote that.
[45:28] Maybe who was it? Paul Harvey. The rest
[45:30] of the story is is many define God
[45:32] differently.
[45:34] And millennials numbers are lower than
[45:36] that of any other generation.
[45:39] The number of Protestants have declined
[45:42] as the society becomes more modern and
[45:44] secular.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Revelations, that made me think of
[45:47] Revelations and and talking about
[45:49] Leadyia. They're they're they're neither
[45:52] hot nor cold.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're rich and
[45:55] increased with goods and have need of
[45:57] nothing, so they think. And yet they
[46:00] know not that they're wretched and
[46:01] miserable and poor and blind and naked.
[46:04] the unchurched are are are more open,
[46:07] they say, to um to to hearing about
[46:10] Christ than than what what was thought.
[46:14] And yet the rest of the story is they're
[46:16] less open than they were previously.
[46:19] So there's an openness, but they're less
[46:21] open. And then you have this this whole
[46:24] thing. There's a growing frustration
[46:26] that evangelicals are rigid, rule
[46:28] oriented, and unloving to people who
[46:30] think differently than they do. They
[46:32] aren't positive about churches. So, they
[46:34] are more likely to come to Christ
[46:36] through relationship rather than come
[46:38] through the front doors. And so, I, you
[46:40] know, I wonder, well, why why don't we
[46:42] see so so many more new souls? I mean,
[46:45] we're we're here, we're striving, we're
[46:47] struggling, we're we're doing all we
[46:49] can, and yet there's just this whole uh
[46:52] the culture we live in, the Leadyian age
[46:54] that we live in. They they they they
[46:57] don't know that they're naked and blind.
[46:59] And then you have you have first
[47:00] generation Christians if I can say and
[47:02] I'm talking about Christians as a whole
[47:05] Christianity religion. You have first
[47:08] generation and then second generation
[47:09] and here we are third and fourth
[47:11] generation. And it's and it's waned
[47:14] because of how if I could say it this
[47:17] way without any disrespect. It's because
[47:19] of how first and second generation have
[47:21] handled it. And so if we don't handle
[47:23] the word correctly, we affect the next
[47:26] generation under us. Let's not put it on
[47:29] first and second generation. Let's put
[47:31] it on my generation. How I handle the
[47:34] word today, how I, you know, brother
[47:36] Paul's always saying that you should, if
[47:38] you show a passion to your children,
[47:40] then they'll they'll catch a passion for
[47:42] Christ. But if you're walking around,
[47:44] you know, oh, here we go to church
[47:46] again. It's wonder who's preaching
[47:48] tonight. Maybe I won't go, you know. And
[47:50] if you're walking around like like a
[47:53] Christian Eeyore, then your children are
[47:55] going to catch on to that and they're
[47:57] well Do we do we got to go to church?
[48:00] You know what? You're right. We don't
[48:01] really need to go to church tonight.
[48:04] Brother Brandon's preaching. We really
[48:06] don't need to go to church tonight. Come
[48:08] on.
[48:10] I was just joking. Decisions we make
[48:13] today will affect our children's
[48:14] children.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; You know, we got to have a
[48:17] multi-generational vision. But but but
[48:19] even looking back to forward, so I'm I'm
[48:22] just going to quickly read you some
[48:23] statistics. When when dads are involved,
[48:26] a 17-year-old is 1.27 times less likely
[48:30] to leave church. When the dad is engaged
[48:33] when he's involved, when parents are
[48:36] unhappy
[48:38] with the their congregation and they
[48:40] don't like church,
[48:42] kids are one and a half times more
[48:45] likely to leave church.
[48:50] 18-year-olds who do not spend time
[48:52] reading their Bibles regularly.
[48:54] I I heard that there's a challenge out
[48:56] to the youth to to read your Bibles,
[48:59] read a message.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; 18-year-olds who do not spend time
[49:03] reading their Bibles regularly are 1.23
[49:06] times more likely to leave church
[49:10] without an environment where teenagers
[49:13] feel they can trust the elders for
[49:14] guidance. 18-year-olds are 1.23 two
[49:17] three times more likely to leave. Having
[49:19] a youth group with caring leaders makes
[49:21] it 1.17 times less likely that a
[49:24] teenager will leave. 15 to 18 year olds
[49:28] are 1.35
[49:30] times less likely to leave. If three or
[49:32] more adults show they care and invest in
[49:34] their lives. If no adults show they care
[49:37] and invest in their lives, they are 2.65
[49:40] times more likely to leave. So you start
[49:44] expounding on these numbers and it and
[49:46] it what's it have to do with it has to
[49:48] do with the generations before and how
[49:50] they're handling things.
[49:53] Now we're not going to put everything
[49:54] off on them. Okay, we'll get to that.
[49:57] But we can conclude and studies have
[49:59] also that the experience children have
[50:01] with their family and church affects how
[50:03] they view their faith in adulthood.
[50:06] Naturally and spiritually speaking now,
[50:08] each generation usually tries to protect
[50:10] the next from the things that they had
[50:13] to endure,
[50:15] wanting to make life better for the
[50:17] next. So, we're very blessed today. I'm
[50:20] just thinking about this. We're very
[50:22] blessed today. We have the message. We
[50:24] have We have free access to our Bibles.
[50:26] You can have it in paper form, digital
[50:28] form. You can pull it up anytime,
[50:30] anywhere. You same thing with this
[50:32] message we've been blessed with. And yet
[50:34] we're in it less.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; And and and it's yet we have more access
[50:39] to it, easier access, freer access than
[50:42] we ever had. And so generation one is
[50:44] looking at it and they're saying, "We
[50:45] got to get this thing out." And so they
[50:48] do it. And we we we have so many
[50:51] different translations of the Bible. We
[50:53] have we have, you know, we went from
[50:56] from I don't even know the names of
[50:58] them. realtore and and uh cassette tape
[51:02] to CD to MP3 to flash drive to now it's
[51:06] on your phone. And that was the that was
[51:08] the drive. That was the hunger, the
[51:10] passion for that first generation. Get
[51:13] it out there. Get it to the people. And
[51:16] the second generation, we catch that
[51:18] vision and and and and get it out there.
[51:21] And yet and yet there's there's also
[51:23] this preservation of what the first
[51:24] generation did. And so we preserve it.
[51:27] We rally behind it. We we we get it and
[51:30] we we collect it. But when you look at
[51:32] what the first generation did and then
[51:34] the second generation, if I could say it
[51:36] this way, without not belittling anyone
[51:39] and just trying to catch the thought,
[51:40] then then it's it's less than what the
[51:43] first generation did.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; And then you get to the third generation
[51:47] and the the first and second generation
[51:50] are looking down and saying, "What are
[51:52] you doing? We did all of this and you're
[51:54] not even picking it up. You just picked
[51:57] up your phone to look at a message and
[52:00] you get went to the the the news
[52:02] instead.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; You totally got sidetracked. Come back.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; All those efforts of the first and
[52:11] second. So the first generation's harder
[52:15] plowing to pave the way. But as a result
[52:18] of that, the second generation softens a
[52:21] little bit.
[52:24] Usually the second generation is trying
[52:26] to protect the third from any imbalances
[52:28] of the first.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; So they pass along precautionary tales
[52:36] &gt;&gt; and fear being fanatical. So they they
[52:39] swing way the other way.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; I think it was was brother Paul said
[52:44] recently
[52:45] when you're under legalism they'll try
[52:47] to protect the kids from legalism.
[52:50] But in that they start actually
[52:52] belittling the real thing.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; And so the kids say, "Well, I'm afraid.
[52:57] I don't want to go to legalism. That
[52:59] that that damaged you that way." And
[53:00] it's not belittling you who've been
[53:02] damaged by it. But but you know, you you
[53:05] pass that fear. You pass those hurts and
[53:07] those pains onto the next generation.
[53:10] And by the third generation, they're
[53:12] getting that skewed truth.
[53:15] I don't know that I want. Well, why why
[53:17] are they leaving? Why is it a harder
[53:19] time serving the Lord? Well, I don't
[53:21] know that I want what you had if that's
[53:22] what it produced.
[53:24] You see, we got to be careful how we're
[53:26] talking about this thing.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; So, since Pentecost, there's been
[53:34] different movements swinging back and
[53:36] forth trying to balance. We know
[53:38] grandfather clock, you know, it'll the
[53:40] pendulum swings one way, then the other,
[53:42] usually hard the other way, then back.
[53:44] We want to find the resting place, the
[53:46] the the balance. Amen. But but what we
[53:49] can do in that swinging back and forth
[53:51] is actually create a weaker next
[53:54] generation.
[53:56] But this also gives us just as a
[53:59] positive note here. It also gives us an
[54:02] opportunity to affect the next
[54:04] generation for the good
[54:06] in their formidable years when they're
[54:08] least connected to the organization of
[54:11] religion. When they're when they're
[54:13] least connected to the can I say the the
[54:18] organization of the message
[54:21] &gt;&gt; we know brother Brandham said this will
[54:22] never be organized. The truth of it
[54:24] won't be. But yet we've seen it over
[54:27] time how how the ranks have have really
[54:30] created an organization out of it and
[54:33] that was never meant to be and and the
[54:35] truth cannot be organized. The truth is
[54:37] the truth and it will go on the truth
[54:39] and the next generation can have the
[54:41] truth and the next generation after that
[54:43] can have the truth.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be bound by the
[54:47] generation before you. You you ha you
[54:50] can't be bound. You have to get it for
[54:52] yourself.
[54:55] Historians and sociologists have
[54:57] observed an interesting trend that
[54:59] occurs with groups of people or in
[55:00] communities or even in families. It's
[55:03] called the phenomenon of the third
[55:04] generation. Simply put, they have
[55:07] observed that there commonly occurs
[55:09] deterioration within a community that
[55:11] tends to climax with the third
[55:12] generation. The process begins with a
[55:15] period of dynamic activity. Just going
[55:17] to read you a couple things here. I'm
[55:18] driving in my point. usually stimulated
[55:20] by a strong leader or by some
[55:23] significant event in the community. You
[55:26] think of what we've had in this
[55:28] generation, a prophet of God, a strong
[55:31] leader, the the the significance of what
[55:34] that event is, the significance of the
[55:37] message that we've had, and it
[55:40] spearheads this, the first generation,
[55:43] there's a dynamic to living, an
[55:45] excitement because new things are
[55:46] happening. There's an expansion, a
[55:48] growth on all levels of human endeavor.
[55:51] The first generation gets marked by
[55:53] growth.
[55:55] The second generation, they have not
[55:57] directly experienced the dynamic events
[56:00] of the first. They have inherited the
[56:02] good times and the prosperity. Though
[56:05] they're content to preserve and
[56:07] consolidate
[56:08] there's a little motivation to put forth
[56:11] the genuine effort to sustain the
[56:13] dynamic of the past.
[56:17] The second generation is content with
[56:19] listening to the stories of old. Now,
[56:21] this is a this is a writing not familiar
[56:24] with the message. Now, second generation
[56:26] is content with listening to the stories
[56:28] of the old days, wishing for them, but
[56:30] is too involved with the preservation of
[56:33] the success of the present to continue
[56:35] the growth of the first. They work hard
[56:38] to preserve the status quo, fearing that
[56:41] any movement will risk losing what they
[56:44] have received. The second generation is
[56:46] marked by entrenchment.
[56:49] The third generation, they have not seen
[56:52] that kind of v vitality. They have only
[56:55] seen the process of preservation and
[56:57] entrenchment. They have heard the
[56:59] stories of the past, but they are far
[57:01] away now and unreal. They find no
[57:04] compelling reason to be driven by the
[57:05] vision that drove the grandparents. They
[57:08] are freed from the need to fight for
[57:10] recognition and security and are ever uh
[57:13] even freed from the worries of
[57:15] preserving what was originally hard one.
[57:18] They are idle with no vision that drives
[57:20] them, no passion that inflames them and
[57:24] no purpose that gives them meaning.
[57:27] The third generation is often a people
[57:29] lacking a strong sense of identity and
[57:32] belonging and so are uncommitted to the
[57:35] group. A people without a driving
[57:37] passion because they are fired by no
[57:39] vision. A people not sure of who they
[57:42] are, what they believe or what they
[57:44] should do. The third generation is
[57:46] marked by decline.
[57:48] Now this this this just seems to apply
[57:50] both naturally and spiritually.
[57:53] Let me give you some scriptural
[57:54] examples. three generations from Joshua
[57:56] turned to false gods. Moses was a first
[58:00] generational leader. I'd venture to say
[58:03] Joshua would be a second generation.
[58:05] Even though he was there with Moses, I'd
[58:07] call him a second generation. He was a
[58:09] young man in Moses's meetings and became
[58:12] Moses's ministers mean he he served
[58:15] Moses. He walked across the open Red
[58:18] Sea, went through the wilderness.
[58:22] He saw the miracles, the signs, and the
[58:24] wonders God did through Moses. He had
[58:27] direct conversation with Moses.
[58:30] When Moses died, the mantle was passed
[58:33] to him. The next generation under Joshua
[58:36] would have gone into the land and taken
[58:39] much of it. They would be focused on
[58:41] preserving what was gained, but their
[58:44] worship started to become half-hearted.
[58:47] And the third generation from Joshua
[58:49] would have had to fight much fewer
[58:51] battles. Their reliance on God as a
[58:54] mighty warrior would have weaned. They
[58:57] had good times and would have done
[58:59] exactly what God told them not to do. In
[59:01] the scripture we'll read here shortly.
[59:03] They forgot what God had done for them
[59:05] until the end of the book of Judges
[59:08] &gt;&gt; says every man did what was right in his
[59:10] own eyes.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; You think of what Moses what God did
[59:14] through Moses. the miracles, the it's
[59:17] written in this book. It's told about,
[59:19] it's spoken about in Israel today. And
[59:22] yet, just in three generations, they
[59:25] every man was doing what was right in
[59:26] his own eyes.
[59:29] David was a first generational leader.
[59:32] We know the story well. He fought and
[59:34] created an empire. God would even take a
[59:37] title from the son of David.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Solomon, the second generation, lived in
[59:42] the glory of what his father
[59:43] established. He was focused on
[59:45] preserving and consolidating
[59:47] but making compromises to do so. These
[59:51] compromises brought back in the
[59:52] influence of Baal worship. Two
[59:55] generations, three generations from
[59:57] David, his grandson Rahaboam split the
[1:00:00] kingdom in two, he brought back all the
[1:00:03] abominations the Lord drove out of the
[1:00:05] land before.
[1:00:09] I don't mean to sound bleak, but I I
[1:00:12] guess from the inside is is is a warning
[1:00:16] to all of us, but especially to my to my
[1:00:19] generation, to my children's generation.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're in danger of losing
[1:00:24] something.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; We we have to we have to not not hold on
[1:00:30] to the past, but we've got to hold on to
[1:00:32] the word that we've been given. That's
[1:00:34] the only thing that's going to make it.
[1:00:36] That's the only thing that's going to
[1:00:38] that's going to shake us, that's going
[1:00:39] to bring us out of this this this gen
[1:00:42] three generational curse is to to take
[1:00:45] the mantle that's been given to us. To
[1:00:47] take it and to run with it and and to
[1:00:49] and to do with it and to to to preach it
[1:00:53] just just as truth and as balanced as
[1:00:55] it's ever been preached. That's what's
[1:00:57] falling upon our generation today.
[1:00:59] That's what we're facing up against in
[1:01:02] the middle of Leodysia, in the middle of
[1:01:04] Sodom and Gomorrah. We have to hold this
[1:01:06] thing up. We have to carry this thing.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Not grow weary and welloing.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; I I know I'm reading a lot. Do Can you
[1:01:15] pull up those quotes?
[1:01:19] I know I've been reading reading some
[1:01:21] lengthy quotes, but listen, this is this
[1:01:22] is this is when I when I find exactly
[1:01:25] what has been said so far by other
[1:01:28] writers, find it in the message, it it's
[1:01:31] just it's it's I want to lift this up. I
[1:01:34] want to give it value. So watch this. A
[1:01:36] little bit lengthy, but bear with me.
[1:01:38] Revelations 2:4. Nevertheless, I have
[1:01:40] somewhat against thee because thou hast
[1:01:42] left thy first love. That's really what
[1:01:44] it comes down to. In each generation, if
[1:01:47] you leave your first love, something
[1:01:49] gets lost.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; To understand this, you must realize
[1:01:52] that the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:01:54] original saints at Ephesus alone. This
[1:01:56] message is to the entire age, which
[1:01:58] lasted about 120 years. Its message then
[1:02:01] is to all the generations in that span.
[1:02:06] Now history repeats itself. In the
[1:02:08] generation of Israel, we see revival in
[1:02:11] one generation only to see the fires
[1:02:14] fading in the next. In the third
[1:02:16] generation, embers may be glowing
[1:02:18] slightly, but in the fourth, there may
[1:02:20] be no vestige whatsoever of that
[1:02:22] original flame. Then God lights the fire
[1:02:25] again. That's the part I might not get
[1:02:28] to tonight, but I'm excited about it
[1:02:30] because God lights the fire again.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; God lights the fire again and the and
[1:02:35] the same process is repeated. Listen,
[1:02:38] this is this is what got me excited just
[1:02:40] before coming out. I just realized this
[1:02:42] reading it again. If God lights the fire
[1:02:45] again and we're three generations from
[1:02:48] the prophet, we're about to be lit on
[1:02:51] fire.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you have access to
[1:02:55] tonight is the fire of God. It is simply
[1:02:59] the manifestation of the truth that God
[1:03:01] has no grandchildren. You've heard it
[1:03:03] over and over and over again. The young
[1:03:05] people, you've heard it. Now I'm telling
[1:03:07] you what that means. God has zero
[1:03:09] grandchildren. Salvation is not passed
[1:03:12] on by natural birth. Listen, just
[1:03:15] because brother Paul is preaching the
[1:03:17] word like a first generation, might I
[1:03:19] add. Just because he's doing that, that
[1:03:22] doesn't mean you're getting in. You're
[1:03:24] not going to go in off of brother Paul.
[1:03:26] You have to get it for yourself. Just
[1:03:28] because your parents have the original
[1:03:30] thing doesn't mean you're going in. My
[1:03:32] young person, if you have not repented
[1:03:34] and be baptized and and and in in the
[1:03:37] name of Jesus Christ and sought the Holy
[1:03:40] Ghost, then you're missing the original
[1:03:42] fire. You're not going in on your
[1:03:44] parents. I don't mean to do a fear
[1:03:46] thing. I'm not into that. I've been very
[1:03:48] against in trying to get my children to
[1:03:51] come to the Lord by fear. I'm not into
[1:03:53] that. But what I'm saying is the truth.
[1:03:55] That's just the truth of it. You're not
[1:03:57] getting in because your parents are good
[1:03:59] Christians. It's not passed down by
[1:04:01] natural birth anymore than is there uh
[1:04:04] truth to apostolic succession. It isn't
[1:04:06] in the word. You start out with truly
[1:04:08] born again believers. And when the next
[1:04:11] generation comes along, they are no
[1:04:12] longer just plain Christians, but they
[1:04:15] they have to take a uh but they have to
[1:04:18] take a denominational name. Now he's
[1:04:19] saying what they do instead of getting
[1:04:22] the real thing. Take a denominational
[1:04:23] name and are now Baptist, Methodists,
[1:04:26] can I say message believers,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; etc., etc.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; That is exactly what they are too. They
[1:04:34] are not Christians. You have to be born
[1:04:36] of the will of God, not the will of man
[1:04:38] to be saved. But these folks are all
[1:04:41] coming together now by the will of man.
[1:04:43] I don't say that some aren't uh some of
[1:04:46] them aren't right with God. Not for a
[1:04:48] minute do I say that. But the original
[1:04:50] fire has died down.
[1:04:53] They are not the same anymore. The
[1:04:55] fervent desire to please God. The
[1:04:57] passion to know his word. Listen, this
[1:05:00] is what I'm trying to get to you. The
[1:05:01] fervent desire to please God. the the
[1:05:04] the the passion to know his word, the
[1:05:06] cry for reaching out in the spirit.
[1:05:09] That's what I want to see tonight in
[1:05:11] this service is a cry reaching out for
[1:05:13] the spirit.
[1:05:16] All begins to fade and instead of that
[1:05:19] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:05:21] God, it has cooled off and become a bit
[1:05:23] formal. That is what was happening back
[1:05:25] there to the Ephesians. They were
[1:05:28] getting a bit formal. the abom uh uh
[1:05:30] abandonment to God was dying out and the
[1:05:33] people weren't too careful about what
[1:05:35] God thought of them as they began to be
[1:05:38] careful about what the world thought of
[1:05:39] them. This is why a lot of the second
[1:05:42] generation immigrants were losing their
[1:05:45] original culture and language is because
[1:05:47] they were afraid. They were anxious.
[1:05:49] They worried too much about what other
[1:05:51] people around them were thinking about
[1:05:52] them than than carrying it on.
[1:05:56] That second generation coming on was
[1:05:58] just like Israel. They demanded a king
[1:06:00] to be like the other nations. When they
[1:06:02] did that, they rejected God. But they
[1:06:05] did it anyway. That is the history of
[1:06:07] the church. When it thinks more of
[1:06:09] conforming to the world instead of
[1:06:12] conforming to God. It isn't long until
[1:06:15] you see them stop doing things they used
[1:06:17] to do and start doing things they
[1:06:19] wouldn't do initially.
[1:06:22] Well, I got to fit in. Mom, dad, I don't
[1:06:24] do I have to wear a skirt.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; I I don't fit in. I'm the only one in
[1:06:29] school.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; That listen, this is this is where it
[1:06:33] goes. They change their manner of dress,
[1:06:37] their attitudes, and their behavior.
[1:06:39] They get lax.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; That is what Ephesus means. Relax,
[1:06:43] drifting. The cycle of revival and death
[1:06:46] has never failed. All you have to do is
[1:06:48] recall the last move of God in the
[1:06:50] spirit when men and women dressed like
[1:06:52] Christians. went to church, prayed all
[1:06:54] night, took to the street corners, and
[1:06:56] weren't ashamed of the manifestation of
[1:06:57] the spirit. They left their old dead
[1:06:59] churches and worshiped in homes and old
[1:07:01] store buildings. They had reality.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't too long a time until they
[1:07:07] began to get enough money to build fine
[1:07:08] new churches to put in a choir instead
[1:07:11] of singing unto God for themselves. Boy,
[1:07:14] that ought to that ought to give you a
[1:07:17] little bit of a spanking for some of you
[1:07:18] come in song service and sit on Gideon.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:22] Gideon ain't here to sing for you. You
[1:07:24] need to sing for yourself.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; They put in a choir instead of singing.
[1:07:29] They put gowns on the choir. They
[1:07:31] organized a movement and ran it by man.
[1:07:34] They soon began to read uh books they
[1:07:37] weren't fit to read. That's
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; They let down the bars and the goats
[1:07:41] came in and took over. The cry for joy
[1:07:43] was gone.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; The freedom of the spirit was gone. Oh,
[1:07:49] they kept on with a form, but the fire
[1:07:51] had died down. And the blackness of
[1:07:53] ashes is about all that's left. Probably
[1:07:56] one of the worst things is to keep
[1:07:58] coming to church and the fire be gone in
[1:08:01] your spirit.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; A few moments ago, I mentioned that John
[1:08:06] understood what it was to love God. That
[1:08:08] great apostle of love would certainly
[1:08:10] see it when the church began to lose
[1:08:12] that first love of God. In 1 John 5:3 he
[1:08:14] says, "For this is the love of God, that
[1:08:17] we keep his commandments, his word."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; How do you know you love God? By keeping
[1:08:22] his commandments. One little deviation
[1:08:25] from that word. Listen, one little
[1:08:28] deviation from that word was a step away
[1:08:31] from Christ.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I want the young people to
[1:08:34] realize when we're talking about the
[1:08:36] word, we're not talking anything
[1:08:37] different than Jesus Christ himself. And
[1:08:40] so when you say, "I don't know about
[1:08:43] that. I'm going to step this way." When
[1:08:45] you step away from the word even a
[1:08:47] little bit, you're stepping away from
[1:08:48] Christ.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; One little deviation. People say they
[1:08:52] love God. They go to church. They even
[1:08:55] shout and rejoice and sing and have a
[1:08:57] great emotional time. But when it's all
[1:08:59] over, watch and see if they are in that
[1:09:01] word, walking in it, living in it. If
[1:09:04] they go through all the other, all the
[1:09:07] jumping, all the shouting, all the
[1:09:08] emotion and and and and uh all the other
[1:09:12] and then don't walk in that word, they
[1:09:14] can say they love God, but their life
[1:09:16] tells a different story. I wonder if
[1:09:18] John didn't see a lot of that before he
[1:09:20] died. People saying they love God, but
[1:09:23] not obeying his word. Oh, Ephesian
[1:09:25] church, something is happening to you.
[1:09:27] Someone is trying to either add to that
[1:09:29] word or take from it, but they are doing
[1:09:31] it so subtly that you can't see it. They
[1:09:34] haven't made a move so big you can see
[1:09:36] it. It it it is undercover. And they're
[1:09:39] bringing it by the way of reason and
[1:09:41] human understanding. I'm I'm almost
[1:09:42] done. Uh uh uh let's see. Go back to
[1:09:45] Pentecost before it's too late. But as
[1:09:47] usual, people don't heed God's warning.
[1:09:49] That revival fire, how do you get
[1:09:52] revival fire? What's it built on?
[1:09:55] That revival fire built upon the sacred
[1:09:58] word is so wonderful and the
[1:10:00] manifestation of the spirit so blessed.
[1:10:03] Listen now, this is what we just read a
[1:10:04] few minutes ago in another writing that
[1:10:06] a little fear creeps in in that second
[1:10:08] generation. A whisper in the heart that
[1:10:10] says, "How can we protect this truth?
[1:10:13] What can we do to see this revival goes
[1:10:15] on?" That is when the antichrist spirit
[1:10:18] comes in and whispers, "Look, you have
[1:10:21] the truth. Now, see that it doesn't get
[1:10:23] lost.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Organize and set up a creed of of what
[1:10:28] you believe. Put it all in in the church
[1:10:30] manual. And listen, we know these things
[1:10:32] in the message, so we wouldn't call it a
[1:10:34] creed. We wouldn't we wouldn't get a
[1:10:35] church manual, but I got to say, we've
[1:10:38] done some of this.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And they do it. They organize. They add
[1:10:43] to the word and they die just like Eve
[1:10:45] did for taking one wrong word. It's
[1:10:47] God's word that brings life. God's word.
[1:10:51] And it's not what we say about the word
[1:10:53] that counts, but it's what God says.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Let's let's go to Deuteronomy.
[1:11:10] Oh my.
[1:11:14] Are you okay?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. Deuteronomy 6.
[1:11:26] Let me get there. You sound like you're
[1:11:28] already there.
[1:11:31] Deuteronomy 6. Now, I just just want to
[1:11:33] go through this a little bit. Now these
[1:11:35] are the commandments, the statutes, and
[1:11:37] the judgments, which the Lord your God
[1:11:38] commanded to teach you, that ye might do
[1:11:41] them in the land whether you go to
[1:11:43] possess it, that thou mightest fear the
[1:11:45] Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes
[1:11:47] and his commandments, which I command
[1:11:49] thee, thou and thy son, and thy son's
[1:11:52] son
[1:11:54] all the days of thy life, and that they
[1:11:56] and that thy days may be prolonged. He
[1:11:59] just said, I'm going to I'm going to
[1:12:01] give you this to you. This is for you,
[1:12:02] but it's also for your son. It's also
[1:12:05] for your son's son, even as many as our
[1:12:08] Lord our God shall call. So, this is a
[1:12:10] multi-generational thing.
[1:12:13] Uh, hear therefore, O Israel, and
[1:12:16] observe to do it, that it might be well
[1:12:18] with thee, and that ye might be increase
[1:12:21] uh mightily in the Lord.
[1:12:23] Let me just skip a little bit here.
[1:12:28] Thou shalt love the Lord God. Verse 5,
[1:12:30] with all thine heart, with all thy soul,
[1:12:32] with all thy might. And these words
[1:12:34] which I command thee this day shall be
[1:12:35] in thine heart. Where does it need to
[1:12:37] be? It needs to be in your heart.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; It can't be in your parents' heart.
[1:12:42] Can't be in your grandparents' heart.
[1:12:44] Can't be in the prophet's heart. It's
[1:12:46] got to be in your heart.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:12:50] unto thy children. Listen, we've been
[1:12:52] through this in the family days. You got
[1:12:53] to keep this word before your children.
[1:12:56] and shalt talk of them when thou sitest
[1:12:58] in thine house. Listen, you you know
[1:13:00] these scriptures. Let me just skip down.
[1:13:05] Thou will write them, and it shall be
[1:13:07] verse 10. when when the Lord thy God
[1:13:09] shall have brought thee into the land
[1:13:11] which he swear uh uh um verse 11 no
[1:13:15] listen to give thee great and goodly
[1:13:17] cities which thou buildest not
[1:13:21] and houses full of all good things which
[1:13:24] thou flest not and wells digged which
[1:13:26] thou digest not vineyards and olive
[1:13:28] trees which thou plantest not when thou
[1:13:30] shalt have eaten and be full listen
[1:13:34] they're going into a land he's talking
[1:13:36] about a land somebody else prepared for
[1:13:38] them. Now, I know that was talking about
[1:13:40] an enemy that was driven out, but what
[1:13:42] about what about the first generation
[1:13:44] that's put up for us? And we're in we're
[1:13:46] in houses today that we we didn't build
[1:13:49] ourselves. We're in fields that we
[1:13:51] didn't we didn't plant ourselves.
[1:13:55] Beware, lest thou forget the Lord, which
[1:13:57] brought thee from out of the land of
[1:13:59] Egypt, from the house of bondage. What
[1:14:02] did What did God bring you out of?
[1:14:03] Bondage.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; You were in bondage. We're in bondage
[1:14:06] without the Lord.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:14:11] thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and
[1:14:13] serve him, and shall swear by his name.
[1:14:15] Ye shall not go after other gods of the
[1:14:17] gods of the people which are round about
[1:14:19] you. For the Lord thy God is a jealous
[1:14:22] God among you. Lest the anger of the
[1:14:23] Lord thy God be kindled against thee,
[1:14:25] and destroy thee from the face of the
[1:14:26] earth. Ye shall not tempt the Lord. Ye
[1:14:29] shall diligently keep the commandment of
[1:14:31] the Lord your God and his statutes,
[1:14:33] testimonies. I want to find there was a
[1:14:36] scripture I wanted to read.
[1:14:38] Thou shalt do that which is right and
[1:14:40] good in the sight of the Lord and it uh
[1:14:42] might be well with thee that thou mayest
[1:14:45] go in and possess the good land which
[1:14:47] the Lord swear unto thy fathers to cast
[1:14:49] out all thine enemies from before thee
[1:14:50] as the Lord hath spoken. And when thy
[1:14:53] son askketh thee in time to come,
[1:14:55] saying, What mean the statutes, the
[1:14:57] testimonies, and the statutes, and the
[1:14:59] judgments which the Lord thy God hath
[1:15:01] commanded to you? Then shalt thou say
[1:15:04] unto unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's
[1:15:07] bondman in Egypt, and the Lord brought
[1:15:09] us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And
[1:15:11] the Lord showed signs and wonders, great
[1:15:13] and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and
[1:15:15] upon all his house before our eyes. And
[1:15:17] he brought us out from fence. What's
[1:15:20] what's he saying? They'll overcome by
[1:15:22] the by the the power of the blood and by
[1:15:24] the word of the testimony.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important to to testify,
[1:15:28] especially to your kids, of the goodness
[1:15:31] of God. Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And the Lord commanded us do all his
[1:15:35] statutes.
[1:15:37] My
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can Can I just go a little bit
[1:15:42] further? Chapter 7. When the Lord thy
[1:15:44] God shall bring thee into the land,
[1:15:45] whether thou goest to possess it, and
[1:15:47] hath cast out many nations before thee,
[1:15:50] the Hittites, and the and the Geresites,
[1:15:51] and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
[1:15:53] and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, the
[1:15:55] Jebusites, seven nations greater and
[1:15:58] mightier than thou. There's nothing in
[1:16:00] your life that's too big for God.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; God will drive it all out. Verse two.
[1:16:05] And when the Lord thy God shall deliver
[1:16:06] them before thee, thou shalt smite them
[1:16:08] and utterly destroy them. Thou shalt not
[1:16:10] make no covenant with them, nor show
[1:16:12] mercy unto them. Neither shalt thou make
[1:16:15] marriages. Now, this is I wanted to just
[1:16:16] get this. I just felt to touch this.
[1:16:19] Neither shalt thou make marriages with
[1:16:20] them. Thy daughters thou shalt not give
[1:16:23] unto his son, nor his daughters shalt
[1:16:25] thou take unto thy son. Why do we
[1:16:28] preach? Why do we say young person, it's
[1:16:32] important not to be unequally yolked?
[1:16:34] For they will turn away thy son from
[1:16:37] following me that they may serve other
[1:16:39] gods. So will the anger of the Lord be
[1:16:41] kindled against you and destroy thee
[1:16:43] suddenly. Why don't why do we say young
[1:16:46] person, find somebody believes the way
[1:16:48] you know what you believe first. Get the
[1:16:51] Holy Ghost first and then find a mate
[1:16:53] that's got the Holy Ghost because of
[1:16:54] this right here. Well, we'll flirt to
[1:16:56] convert. No, you won't.
[1:16:59] the Listen, you're flirting with them.
[1:17:01] They're flirting with you. Somebody's
[1:17:03] going to get converted. And according to
[1:17:04] this, it's not going to be you.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just throwing I just felt to
[1:17:09] throw out that warning to you.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll we'll read more of
[1:17:13] Deuteronomy some other time.
[1:17:18] Can I Can I do 10 more minutes?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:24] Nehemiah. Nehemiah was dealing with a
[1:17:26] third generation.
[1:17:28] To counter the decline, Nehemiah
[1:17:31] reminded the people of who they are.
[1:17:33] They're God's people.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; He told their history. He told their
[1:17:38] testimony.
[1:17:39] Then then he had the people recommmit
[1:17:42] their lives to God.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Not the God of yesterday, but the God of
[1:17:46] today. Yes.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; The stories of the past act of God uh
[1:17:51] acts of God were were not just stories
[1:17:53] of old but was how they got to where
[1:17:56] they were today. It was ingrained in who
[1:17:58] they are, how their parents raised them
[1:18:00] and how their grandparents raised their
[1:18:02] parents formed who they are and what
[1:18:05] they were enjoying today. You you don't
[1:18:08] realize this but be you're enjoying life
[1:18:11] today because of some of the protections
[1:18:13] your parents have put in place. And
[1:18:15] those protections come from the word of
[1:18:17] God, not just making up things to make
[1:18:19] your life miserable.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I just thought, amazing grace, how sweet
[1:18:24] the sound that saved a wretch like me. I
[1:18:26] once was lost, but now I'm found. I was
[1:18:28] blind, but now I see. Nehemiah
[1:18:31] established what it what is believing
[1:18:33] among the people of God. What what's
[1:18:36] that mean? They had church.
[1:18:38] Nehemiah made sure they knew what they
[1:18:40] believed and why they believed it. He
[1:18:42] read the law and made sure to break it
[1:18:44] down in understandable and relatable
[1:18:47] words. It wasn't enough to read the law
[1:18:50] and just leave it way up here where the
[1:18:52] young people couldn't understand it.
[1:18:54] Nehemiah said, "No, no, we're going to
[1:18:56] we're going to take this down." Now, I I
[1:18:57] didn't refresh my mind on Nehemiah, but
[1:19:00] but you know, he had people in in the
[1:19:03] congregation that if somebody didn't
[1:19:05] understand it, let me explain that to
[1:19:07] you here. Let let's let's do let's let's
[1:19:09] sit down with brother Steven and do a
[1:19:11] quick Bible study.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Quick Bible study.
[1:19:15] Just kidding.
[1:19:19] Number three, Nehemiah showed the people
[1:19:22] uh what burning passion looked like.
[1:19:24] Remember what we said? But brother Paul
[1:19:26] says you got to show them a burning
[1:19:27] passion and that spread like fire. Now
[1:19:30] listen, this is just so good that was
[1:19:32] written by somebody here. Let us be
[1:19:34] careful at this point not to confuse
[1:19:36] passion with emotion. There is far too
[1:19:39] much superficial emotion today that
[1:19:41] would pass itself off as passion.
[1:19:44] Emotion is is temporary and volatile is
[1:19:48] basically self-centered and is tied to
[1:19:50] feeling. Passion is a permanent attitude
[1:19:53] that drives the soul from within and is
[1:19:56] always directing outward and concern for
[1:19:58] others.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, God gave them revival.
[1:20:03] Yeah.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He gave him a time of refreshing.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; This message isn't a message of
[1:20:09] yesterday. It's a message of today. You
[1:20:11] can stand to your feet.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You have to have the revelation for
[1:20:15] yourself. It's not good enough to know
[1:20:18] someone who has it. You can only borrow
[1:20:20] someone's faith for so long and then you
[1:20:23] have to get it for yourself.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; True. I I read something and I just
[1:20:28] don't remember even what it was in
[1:20:30] reference to or where it was, but it was
[1:20:32] saying, you know, you can't treat this,
[1:20:35] you can't treat the message, you can't
[1:20:36] treat you can't treat this word, you
[1:20:38] can't treat Christ
[1:20:40] like like a life preserver,
[1:20:43] brother Tom, where you go in the water,
[1:20:45] you go on the boat, you put on your life
[1:20:47] preserver, when you get out of the
[1:20:49] water, you take it off. You've got to
[1:20:51] treat this thing like life support that
[1:20:54] you can't leave this thing. Your very
[1:20:56] existence is is it requires you to stay
[1:20:59] connected with it.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; So let us put on the life the the the
[1:21:03] the life support of the word of God.
[1:21:06] Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Get it for yourself. If you would bow
[1:21:09] bow your heads with me. My my earnest
[1:21:12] prayer this evening is for revival.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; My heart is just just burning. God, give
[1:21:20] us, send a Holy Ghost revival. There's a
[1:21:22] song that says, "Send us a Holy Ghost
[1:21:25] revival. Revive us, Lord. Send the rain
[1:21:28] from heaven. Flood our thirsty souls."
[1:21:31] We need a Holy Ghost revival. Revive us,
[1:21:35] Lord.
[1:21:37] Let's If you just If you just desire
[1:21:40] revival in your heart, if you desire not
[1:21:42] to be under the third generation curse,
[1:21:45] just lift your hands to the Lord and
[1:21:47] let's pray together. Heavenly Father,
[1:21:49] Lord, I I I'm I don't want to try to
[1:21:51] work something up myself, Lord. I I want
[1:21:54] you to do it. We need revival, Lord. We
[1:21:57] pray for revival. All of our efforts,
[1:22:00] Lord, like that song says, we need a
[1:22:02] Holy Ghost revival. We can we can plant
[1:22:05] the seeds of precious truth to reap the
[1:22:08] golden grain, but what we need is is
[1:22:11] your spirit to come. glorify yourself
[1:22:14] again Lord in this third generation in
[1:22:18] the closing of time Lord three and four
[1:22:21] generations from the prophet I ask you
[1:22:24] Lord revive us again revive our hearts
[1:22:27] rekindle the fires the prophet said Lord
[1:22:30] that that you come and you rekindle the
[1:22:32] fire you relight it Lord and we're
[1:22:35] asking that you'd start it now Lord
[1:22:38] light our lamps father trim us Lord Lord
[1:22:41] we can't go get the Holy Ghost post on
[1:22:43] our own. It's a gift, Father, that you
[1:22:46] want to give us even greater. So, so
[1:22:48] lead us, Lord, if we don't have it. If
[1:22:50] we don't have what we thought we had,
[1:22:52] Lord, it's no shame in it. But lead us,
[1:22:54] Lord. We're asking you to lead us to the
[1:22:57] to that precious fountain filled with
[1:23:00] blood drawn from your veins, the
[1:23:02] lifegiving resource. Lord, we ask you to
[1:23:05] send it to us now. God, we're we're
[1:23:08] doing all we can. We've toiled long.
[1:23:10] Lord, I I was thinking of of our pastor,
[1:23:12] Brother Paul, giving it his very best,
[1:23:15] Lord. 35 longer than 35 years now. Lord,
[1:23:20] let let him see the fruits of his labor.
[1:23:23] And that's not pointing to a man, Lord,
[1:23:25] but that's somebody who a generation
[1:23:28] that caught it and he's trying to get it
[1:23:30] to the generations following.
[1:23:33] Lord, we pray, light our fires. I don't
[1:23:36] know how else to ask it, Lord, but
[1:23:38] that's my heart tonight. Lord, light my
[1:23:41] fire again.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Relight it. Lord, I've I've I've
[1:23:45] remembered times in past, Lord, when
[1:23:47] when it just seemed like I I could be in
[1:23:50] the word and not get tired and and you
[1:23:53] play it in the background and yet you
[1:23:55] were still catching things and it just
[1:23:56] seems harder to do. And I know a lot of
[1:23:58] that I believe has to do with the age.
[1:24:01] But Lord, I'm asking, light my fire
[1:24:03] again. Light my fire again. Light the
[1:24:06] fire. Lord, there's there's young people
[1:24:08] there. There might be some old ones who
[1:24:10] haven't been baptized. Draw them into
[1:24:13] yourself. Lord, we're we're trying to
[1:24:15] lift you up tonight. Lord, I I I don't
[1:24:18] want to be seen. I want you to be lifted
[1:24:20] up so you draw all men unto you that
[1:24:23] they repent and be baptized and be
[1:24:25] filled with your spirit, Lord. Lord,
[1:24:28] there's children that need to be filled
[1:24:29] with your spirit. They need to take the
[1:24:32] next step, Lord. We We all need to take
[1:24:35] the next step. Give us Lord, give us
[1:24:38] today our daily bread. Lord, give us
[1:24:41] revival. I pray we pray it in Jesus'
[1:24:45] name. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it's a Wednesday night,
[1:24:51] friend, but the altar's open, if if
[1:24:54] something pricks your heart, young or
[1:24:56] old, and you want to be baptized,
[1:24:59] contact me or Brother Paul. We'll we'll
[1:25:01] have the water ready this Sunday for
[1:25:02] you. Make the next move. Amen. Seek
[1:25:07] revival. Seek God with your heart. You
[1:25:09] say, "Well, I don't really feel that
[1:25:10] burning desire to even pray." Just pray
[1:25:12] for it. Just start by praying for it.
[1:25:15] God will answer. This isn't this isn't a
[1:25:17] God of old. This is a God of today.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I pray you you you just catch the heart
[1:25:22] of God tonight. God bless you as they
[1:25:24] play something.

[1:34:18] Praise the Lord. Amen. We'll sing that
[1:34:21] song. Lord, you know I need a brand new
[1:34:23] touch. We'll sing that one as we go. I
[1:34:25] was just thinking of uh it was a quote
[1:34:28] what I read away uh long long ago long
[1:34:33] ago. I don't know how long it was, but
[1:34:36] it was brother Brandham talking about
[1:34:38] revival. But um you can just see the
[1:34:41] leaves changing and how death has to
[1:34:44] come. But what happens is that you know
[1:34:47] when that uh the ground gets hard and
[1:34:49] cold during the winter time just those
[1:34:52] roots get that's the that's actually
[1:34:54] when revival happens when those roots
[1:34:55] even go deeper. It might seem like from
[1:34:58] the outside nothing's happening. Might
[1:35:00] seem like it's a death there, but
[1:35:03] they're going just as deep as it can go.
[1:35:05] And what happens is those those leaves
[1:35:07] in the wind, they just start they just
[1:35:09] start waving their hands and they just
[1:35:11] start praising the Lord in that in that
[1:35:13] cold season. Amen. They start praising
[1:35:16] him and then those re those roots go go
[1:35:19] even deeper. That's the I forget what he
[1:35:20] said, but he talked about revival there.
[1:35:22] I'll if you guys come up to me, I'll get
[1:35:24] on and I'll I'll look it up. I'll find
[1:35:26] it. I'll find that uh quote for you. But
[1:35:29] it's that that revival. So Lord, let it
[1:35:32] be in this season. Amen. Lord, let it
[1:35:34] be. We want that. We'll sing this
[1:35:36] tonight as we go. Lord, you know I need
[1:35:39] a brand new touch.
[1:35:44] My strength from yesterday
[1:35:47] is gone.
[1:35:51] But if you give me Lord another touch,
[1:35:56] oh, I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:36:02] Lord, you know,
[1:36:05] Lord, you know I need a brand new touch.
[1:36:12] My strength from yesterday
[1:36:14] is gone.
[1:36:19] But if you'll give me another touch,
[1:36:24] oh, I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:36:30] Lord, you know.
[1:36:33] Lord, you know I need a brand new touch.
[1:36:39] My strength from yesterday
[1:36:42] is gone.
[1:36:46] But if you'll give me, Lord, another
[1:36:49] touch,
[1:36:51] oh, I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:36:59] I thought the sun had come to stay,
[1:37:06] but all too soon it went away.
[1:37:13] And in its place the storm clouds came.
[1:37:20] And with the clouds there came the rain.
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] It rained so hard and all so long.
[1:37:33] But missed the storm, I felt a calm.
[1:37:40] It was your touch that brought me
[1:37:43] through it all.
[1:37:47] Without your help, I'd surely fall.
[1:37:52] Oh
[1:37:54] Lord, you know I need a brand new touch.
[1:38:00] My strength from yesterday
[1:38:03] is gone.
[1:38:08] But if you give me Lord another touch,
[1:38:14] I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:38:21] And yesterday has come and gone
[1:38:28] and now a new day's coming on.
[1:38:34] I do not know what it may bring.
[1:38:41] My heart may cry instead of sing.
[1:38:48] It matters not what comes my way. Oh
[1:38:52] Lord,
[1:38:54] if you'll just touch me each day.
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:01] Your loving touch drives all my fears
[1:39:05] away
[1:39:08] close by your side. I want to stay.
[1:39:14] Oh Lord, you know I need a brand new
[1:39:18] touch.
[1:39:21] My strength from yesterday
[1:39:24] is gone.
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:28] But if you give me Lord another touch,
[1:39:35] I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:39:39] Lord, you know. Lord, you know,
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:41:51] Golden.
[1:41:53] [Music]
