[7:30] [Music]
[7:39] Deuteronomy chapter 1 and verse 35.
[7:44] surely there shall not one of these men
[7:47] of this evil generation see that good
[7:50] land which I swear to give unto your
[7:52] fathers
[7:54] save Caleb the sub save Caleb the son of
[7:57] japina he shall see it and to him will I
[8:01] give the land that he had trodden upon
[8:03] and to his children because he hath holy
[8:07] followed the Lord so catch what he's
[8:09] saying here that that God is saying
[8:12] through Moses that none of that
[8:14] generation of the parents will go into
[8:16] the full promised land and he'll he'll
[8:19] explain it later but none of them will
[8:22] go in save Caleb and his children in
[8:25] verse 38 but Joshua the son of my son of
[8:28] none he'll go in which standeth before
[8:30] me he shall go in thither encourage him
[8:33] for he shall cause Israel to inherit so
[8:36] God says none of that generation will go
[8:38] into the promise but Caleb and Joshua
[8:41] verse 39 moreover your little ones which
[8:45] ye shall said should be a prey and your
[8:49] children which in that day had no
[8:51] knowledge between good and evil they
[8:54] shall go in thither and unto them will I
[8:57] give it and they shall possess it
[9:02] now the setting here this morning is of
[9:05] course God's Prophet Moses and he is
[9:09] uh saying to the people of God in
[9:12] Deuteronomy that God is angry and he's
[9:15] expressing that to say I want to let you
[9:18] know that God is angry with something
[9:19] and what God was angry with was the the
[9:23] generation that didn't take a hold of
[9:25] God's promise they didn't want to go
[9:28] into God's full promise they they sell
[9:31] themselves short or they complained and
[9:33] they said we can't go in even though
[9:35] it's been promised by God there's too
[9:37] many hurdles to it and so God over time
[9:40] in the wilderness became angry with this
[9:43] particular generation because they
[9:46] wouldn't go take the land they wouldn't
[9:47] take a hold of this thing they wouldn't
[9:49] take the promise and go take the promise
[9:51] that God had said this is your land and
[9:54] it doesn't matter the obstacles it
[9:56] doesn't matter what's in front of you I
[9:58] promised it to you and so you can go
[10:01] take that land but we see there's a
[10:03] whole generation that's that that cut
[10:06] themselves short in other words they
[10:08] wouldn't take a hold of the whole thing
[10:09] they stayed in the wilderness and they
[10:11] they wouldn't go take the full promise
[10:13] God was actually uh grieved Hebrews says
[10:17] I was grieved with that whole generation
[10:19] and I want you to remember this is the
[10:21] generation that's not out in the world
[10:23] or not in Egypt this is the generation
[10:25] that come in under a prophet under a
[10:28] message and took them out of Egypt and
[10:30] yet they stopped short of the full
[10:33] promise and God said I was grieved with
[10:36] that generation I was grieved with him
[10:39] and he still showed them Miracles he
[10:41] still delivered them he still gave them
[10:43] water when they needed water he still
[10:46] gave them food when they needed food
[10:47] he'd performed many Supernatural things
[10:50] but why was he grieved because the
[10:52] people that generation refused to go all
[10:55] the way into their promise
[10:58] they sent spies into the land to see if
[11:02] it was true what Moses and the prophet
[11:04] had said so catch this now everything
[11:06] Moses said they sent spies in and they
[11:09] went and and they come back and they
[11:10] said they said it's all there the
[11:13] promise is there and here's the evidence
[11:15] they brought back evidence what the
[11:17] prophet said is true and here's the
[11:19] evidence of it
[11:21] and still with the evidence there was
[11:24] men that influenced these parents there
[11:27] was men that said yes it's there but we
[11:30] can't do it well why can't we do it
[11:31] because there's an enemy there's
[11:33] obstacles there's Giants there's great
[11:35] walled cities and that intimidated them
[11:38] and so the parents became influenced by
[11:42] certain people on the internet that was
[11:44] bringing a bad rap on the promise said
[11:47] the parents were influenced to hold them
[11:49] back from going completely into their
[11:52] land because somebody influenced them to
[11:55] say nobody can go that far we can't make
[11:57] it into that there's too many obstacles
[12:00] no person can live that way and so they
[12:02] made a decision actually our children
[12:05] are actually safer here in the
[12:07] wilderness
[12:10] and in numbers 14 3 numbers 14 3 this is
[12:14] what they said and wherefore hath the
[12:16] Lord brought us into this land this is
[12:18] what the people were saying this
[12:19] generation wherefore hath the Lord
[12:20] brought us into this land the Wilderness
[12:23] to Fall by the sword that our wives and
[12:27] our children should be a prey
[12:30] were it not better for us to return to
[12:33] Egypt
[12:35] can you imagine the mentality and
[12:38] attitude that God supernaturally brought
[12:41] him out open the Red Sea drowned
[12:43] Pharaoh's Army and now they're
[12:45] complaining and saying our children are
[12:47] not even going to be safe out here or in
[12:49] the promised land wouldn't it be better
[12:51] if we go back to Egypt no wonder God was
[12:54] grieved with those people
[12:56] no wonder God was grieved that they
[12:59] would pass down this doubt to their
[13:02] children and say stay away from that
[13:04] that's not a good thing that's not a
[13:06] good influence and you'll be a prey if
[13:07] you get around that too much let's just
[13:09] stay right here and so the the parents
[13:12] were influenced by other people who put
[13:13] a doubt on God's message of the land can
[13:16] you imagine parents saying that our
[13:18] children are safer and better off in
[13:21] Egypt under Pharaoh what what a
[13:24] mentality that's a mentality that's a
[13:28] lie of the enemy that your children are
[13:30] safer back in Egypt
[13:33] that's one of the greatest lies your
[13:35] children the safest place for your
[13:37] children is under the promise of the
[13:40] hour
[13:42] it was a lie because their families were
[13:44] safer out in the wilderness
[13:46] with the pillar of Fire by night and a
[13:49] cloud over them by A Cloud by a day and
[13:53] a pillar of Fire by night they were
[13:55] safer much safer even with the Enemy
[13:57] fighting them against them
[13:59] fighting against them they were safer in
[14:02] the wilderness and safer in the Promised
[14:04] Land
[14:05] under a pillar of Fire
[14:09] even in Goshen just the outskirts of
[14:11] Egypt
[14:12] when the death angel came they were
[14:15] safer there with the token applied to
[14:17] their home
[14:18] and he said that Death Angel won't
[14:20] strike your kid your firstborn if you've
[14:22] got the token the safest place for your
[14:24] children is under God's word
[14:29] now I'm preaching to parents first here
[14:31] but I'm going to get to real quickly
[14:32] that God has Grace for the little ones
[14:36] and when the parents won't get a hold of
[14:38] this
[14:39] God says I'm going to Grace give Grace
[14:42] and I'm going to give a chance to the
[14:44] little ones can I get an amen this
[14:46] morning when parents mess it up and
[14:48] don't think I'm just preaching and
[14:49] beating up your parents this morning
[14:50] because remember there was a Joshua
[14:52] there was a Caleb of the older
[14:54] generation that went into the promise as
[14:56] well most of the parents just stayed in
[14:59] the wilderness but there were some
[15:00] parents there that said I want my
[15:02] Mountain I want my land I'm taking me
[15:04] and my children into it I'm not afraid
[15:06] of this
[15:08] somebody say Amen this morning
[15:11] that's exactly the place that my
[15:13] children need to be is in the promise of
[15:15] the Holy Ghost and I'm going to keep
[15:17] them in the right environment I'm going
[15:19] to keep them in church I'm going to keep
[15:20] it around good fellowship and I'm going
[15:22] to pray him through to the promise which
[15:25] is the Holy Ghost because the promise is
[15:27] for me but it's not just for me it's for
[15:30] my children it's to a media far off even
[15:32] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[15:39] so when these parents listen to other
[15:41] voices of Doubt on the internet they
[15:43] said we're not going all the way in
[15:44] we're staying here in the borderline
[15:46] borderline Believers we're borderline
[15:47] lifestyle we can't go back all the way
[15:49] to Egypt now but we can stay here and
[15:52] they would not fully repent and take a
[15:54] full hold on the promise and that
[15:56] angered God and he said none of that
[15:58] generation will go in except except
[16:01] Caleb Joshua and another group your
[16:04] little ones your little ones your
[16:05] children I will give the little ones a
[16:09] chance at my word
[16:11] God's Grace said I'm going to give the
[16:14] little ones a chance now this is amazing
[16:16] because you know that there is a precept
[16:19] that Moses said several times that the
[16:23] iniquities of the fathers would be
[16:25] visited upon the children unto the
[16:28] second and third generation how many
[16:29] reasons you hadn't heard that precept
[16:30] the iniquities of the father so there is
[16:32] a trickle-down effect of what you do as
[16:35] parents if you don't get Deliverance if
[16:37] you don't overcome things it'll trickle
[16:40] down to further Generations
[16:42] oh yeah God said it can you say Amen so
[16:45] the iniquities of the fathers will be
[16:47] visited upon the children until the
[16:49] third and fourth generation so even with
[16:52] that principle that's there God still
[16:54] says I will still even though that's
[16:57] there I will still give grace to the
[16:59] little ones I'll give them a chance at a
[17:02] Revival I'll give them a chance of the
[17:04] promise it doesn't matter that the
[17:07] parents are toxic parents
[17:10] it doesn't matter that the parents are
[17:13] borderline believers
[17:16] I'm going to give them a chance to break
[17:19] the curse
[17:22] any of you sit here and say well I'm not
[17:24] I'm not a dysfunctional parent we're all
[17:27] dysfunctional people because our parents
[17:29] Adam and Eve were dysfunctional
[17:32] come on now
[17:34] our parents Adam and Eve were
[17:36] dysfunctional toxic parents
[17:38] and we're children all that we inherited
[17:40] the the nature of the serpent because of
[17:43] our parents Adam and Eve following
[17:45] everybody us one of us inherited that no
[17:47] matter no wonder we get into trouble can
[17:49] you say Matt and so so I like as I said
[17:52] I'm not belittling this morning I'm just
[17:54] saying God says if the parents mess up
[17:57] I'm gonna give grace to the little ones
[18:00] to have a chance to take the promise
[18:02] themselves and we see it today in many
[18:05] cases where a child or teenager Rises up
[18:08] and said listen my my parents only went
[18:10] so far and that's fine that's between
[18:12] them and God but I'm going to take a
[18:14] hold of this promise I'm going to take a
[18:16] hold of this word god fill me with your
[18:18] spirit I'm gonna take a hold of this
[18:20] word the kids are going to rise up I'm
[18:22] gonna give them Grace I'm going to give
[18:23] them a chance they can break this curse
[18:26] handed down by their parents I'm going
[18:27] to give them the promise a chance at the
[18:29] promise none of that generation
[18:30] appearance will go in but the little
[18:32] ones I will I will give them and God
[18:34] said the parents will not go in but I'm
[18:36] leaving a promise if God I'm moving
[18:37] along now if God gives them a chance
[18:39] listen if God gives them a chance I
[18:42] think we should give them a chance but
[18:44] we're giving the little ones a chance
[18:45] and we had the the in this same week
[18:47] after 50 years the abortion laws of Roe
[18:50] versus Wade gets overturned by the
[18:52] Supreme Court it's an amazing thing now
[18:54] it's a victory to many people it's a
[18:56] victory and I'll call it that this
[18:57] morning it's a victory it's something to
[18:59] Rejoice or Rejoice over can you say Amen
[19:02] uh many forces have been worked at work
[19:04] for a long time the right to life many
[19:07] forces have been working for almost 50
[19:08] years since the law came in to work
[19:10] against it and so real victory for them
[19:12] they've worked hard to get this thing
[19:14] reversed and and I I'm not supposed to
[19:16] be political here uh in case you're
[19:19] listening to this I'm not doing that I
[19:20] want to bring out the biblical point and
[19:21] show us that that when something is
[19:24] wrong especially for children I wouldn't
[19:28] call it a victory as much as I'd call it
[19:30] a rise of a fight to fight back
[19:35] and every once in a while we have a
[19:37] light in this country that rises up and
[19:40] begins to fight back
[19:43] the abortion laws and so so I want to
[19:45] say it's it's I don't I'm not calling it
[19:48] a full Victory because we know
[19:49] scripturally the the the the the
[19:51] iniquity will Heap up more and more
[19:55] and we still have it coming back to the
[19:56] States and and different states will
[19:58] decide different things but we've we
[20:00] find that we'll call it a victory but
[20:02] it's more of a fight I don't think it's
[20:04] an ultimate Victory as you know
[20:06] it's not an ultimate victory until you
[20:08] change hearts
[20:10] by the Lord
[20:12] you're not going to change anything
[20:13] until people's hearts are changed by the
[20:15] Holy Spirit
[20:17] and if you're listening here today on uh
[20:19] on the broadcast or anyone who's
[20:21] listening I just tell you you're not
[20:23] going to solve the problems of this
[20:24] nation it's almost too late as a nation
[20:27] the way that you can solve is that
[20:29] individuals getting the true genuine
[20:32] birth of the Holy Ghost in their lives
[20:34] and that's what changes the problems in
[20:37] our nation
[20:39] and so we see then that that I think
[20:42] it's a a a an amazing thing to see that
[20:45] it changed and I see that Victory take
[20:47] place but you're not going to have a
[20:48] full victory until you have the Holy
[20:49] Holy Spirit in people's lives
[20:52] 60 million abortions of babies since
[20:55] that law was passed
[20:58] 60 million
[21:00] don't be offended
[21:02] if you're listening but I'm going to say
[21:04] this
[21:04] that's
[21:06] you could you could call it American
[21:08] style genocide
[21:13] as Franklin Graham called it
[21:17] I know some people will be offended at
[21:19] that that's listening listen it's it's
[21:22] it's
[21:23] you have to call something what it is
[21:25] 60 million
[21:28] and if you study the generation that
[21:30] that pushed to pass that law back at
[21:33] that time it was a rebellious generation
[21:36] to the word
[21:38] people were rising up and bucking up
[21:40] against Authority and bucking against
[21:42] against government Authority and bucking
[21:44] up against especially God's Authority
[21:46] and his word and everything that was
[21:49] normal for years in his word it was a
[21:51] rebellious generation and the Beatles
[21:53] outwardly threw their songs and through
[21:55] the manner and the way they acted
[21:57] reflected that Rebellion
[21:59] many rock groups but the Beatles in
[22:02] particular don't be offended I'm
[22:03] speaking Against The Beatles but I'm
[22:05] trying to tell you the truth by by
[22:07] articles that were written they were the
[22:09] they were they were the front image of
[22:12] the entire change in that generation
[22:14] being rebellious to the word of God
[22:18] and that was the generation that passed
[22:20] the law that now killed 60 million
[22:24] babies there's a fighting back
[22:28] thank God for some light
[22:31] that's left
[22:33] to fight for the little ones The Unborn
[22:36] but don't just fight for The Unborn
[22:38] fight for the born
[22:42] fight for our children
[22:44] one thing for sure
[22:46] God is behind it because he can only
[22:49] take so much of Satan killing the little
[22:52] ones God throughout the Bible can only
[22:54] handle so much when Satan takes the
[22:57] little ones there'll be other ones
[22:59] destroyed but when he tampers too much
[23:01] with the little ones and the children
[23:02] God Rises up
[23:05] If the parents wrote won't do it God
[23:08] Rises up
[23:09] can you say Amen not just as a nation
[23:12] but if that child has been abused or
[23:14] that child has come under the wrong
[23:16] thing God finally says that's enough I'm
[23:19] going to deal directly with that heart
[23:20] and I've watched young people come from
[23:22] terrible backgrounds and God connects
[23:26] with their heart and says I love you you
[23:29] can have a different life I've actually
[23:30] said it to him you've got to get past
[23:32] the past because God has a different
[23:34] blueprint for your life in Matthew 18
[23:36] says this is Jesus talking at the same
[23:38] time came the disciples unto Jesus
[23:40] saying who is the greatest in the
[23:42] kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a
[23:43] little child unto them and set the child
[23:46] in the midst of them and said verily I
[23:47] say to you except you be converted and
[23:50] become as little children ye shall not
[23:52] enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
[23:55] whosoever there shall therefore shall
[23:57] humble himself as this little child the
[24:00] same is the greatest in the kingdom of
[24:02] heaven and whoso shall receive one such
[24:04] little child in my name receiveth me but
[24:07] whosoever shall offend one of these
[24:09] little ones which believe in me it were
[24:12] better for him than a milestone
[24:13] Millstone was hanged about his neck and
[24:16] that he were drowned in the depth of the
[24:18] sea that's pretty serious and it's
[24:20] saying that you can't hurt a child of
[24:23] God without hurting God
[24:27] you can't wrongly influence a child and
[24:32] not and God not get angry about it
[24:37] whosoever offends one of these innocent
[24:39] little ones and directs them you say
[24:43] well what does the word there offend
[24:45] mean
[24:47] I'm glad you asked
[24:50] it means in the Greek
[24:53] scandalizo
[24:57] and it means to put a stumbling block or
[25:00] impediment in the way upon which another
[25:02] May trip and fall
[25:06] to entice to sin
[25:10] there's actually parents that are that
[25:12] are teaching their children whether
[25:14] verbally or by their lifestyle to dabble
[25:17] in sinful things
[25:21] God doesn't like that because you're
[25:23] offending a little one
[25:27] it also means to cause I want you to
[25:29] listen close now to cause a person to
[25:32] begin to distrust and desert one whom he
[25:37] ought to trust
[25:38] and obey
[25:40] so here's the person in their life they
[25:42] should be trusting them listen our kids
[25:45] cannot trust that many things in life
[25:47] matter of fact there's almost nothing
[25:48] they can trust you can't trust
[25:51] government you can't trust the schools
[25:53] you can't trust some of the leaders in
[25:54] the schools there's hardly anything left
[25:57] to trust
[25:59] and trust is everything because you
[26:02] can't have confidence in someone to come
[26:04] forward with Christ unless there's trust
[26:06] there's hardly any trust left in this
[26:09] world please don't take the one that
[26:12] they're supposed to trust and cast doubt
[26:14] on them is anybody listening this
[26:17] morning that's offending a little one is
[26:20] that someone they're supposed to trust
[26:22] someone they're supposed to uh to to
[26:24] obey to cause to fall away from that
[26:27] person and cause a person to distress
[26:30] and desert one whom they ought to trust
[26:33] and Obey it goes on to say to be
[26:34] offended in one in essence to see in
[26:37] another what I disapprove of and what
[26:39] hinders me from acknowledging his
[26:41] authority to cause one to judge
[26:44] unfavorably or unjustly of another
[26:48] since one who stumbles or whose foot
[26:50] gets entangled feels annoyed to cause
[26:53] one displeasure at a thing to make
[26:55] indignant to make the little one
[26:58] indignant
[27:00] make them displeased
[27:02] pass that down to them
[27:05] there's a lot of not a lot of things we
[27:07] can trust
[27:10] and I've said this before and it fits
[27:12] here I guess
[27:14] parents
[27:16] I'm not your enemy
[27:20] so don't make me the enemy
[27:24] I'm on your side
[27:27] I'm your friend there's not too many
[27:29] there's a lot of things that your enemy
[27:30] in this world but don't make true men of
[27:33] God and the True Body of Christ don't
[27:36] make them the enemy to your children
[27:41] give them a chance to trust
[27:44] even though there's a lot of mistrust
[27:47] there's a lot of hurt there's a lot of
[27:49] people say stupid things sometimes
[27:53] but you teach your children that's the
[27:55] reality of life
[27:57] but don't cause them to have a wall up
[28:00] towards the True Body of Christ and to
[28:02] the true ministers
