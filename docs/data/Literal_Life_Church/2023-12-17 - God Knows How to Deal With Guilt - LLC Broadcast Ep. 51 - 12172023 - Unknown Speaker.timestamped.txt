[4:34] tomorrow and you seen it time and time
[4:39] again just say
[4:47] Amen oh just say
[4:56] Amen oh just say
[4:59] [Music]
[5:01] [Applause]
[5:05] Hallelujah uh we're reading from
[5:07] Deuteronomy chapter 19 we'll read
[5:09] together certain of scriptures when the
[5:11] Lord thy God hath cut off the Nations
[5:14] whose land the Lord thy God giveth thee
[5:17] and thou succeed us them and dwellest in
[5:20] their cities and in their houses Thou
[5:22] shalt separate three cities for thee in
[5:24] the midst of thy land which the Lord thy
[5:26] God giveth thee to possess it Thou shalt
[5:29] prepare the away and divide the coast of
[5:31] thy land which the Lord thy God giveth
[5:33] thee to inherit into three parts and
[5:35] that every Slayer May flee thither and
[5:38] so now he's going to explain what he
[5:40] means by the Slayer and this is the case
[5:42] of the Slayer which shall flee thither
[5:45] that he may live whoo kth his neighbor
[5:48] ignorantly whom he hated not in time
[5:51] past as when a man goeth into the wood
[5:54] with his neighbor to heue Wood and his
[5:55] hand stretcheth forth a stroke with the
[5:57] axe to cut down the tree and the head
[6:00] slippe from the h and lith upon his
[6:02] neighbor that he die he shall flee unto
[6:05] one of those cities and live so this is
[6:08] a category of someone who had an
[6:11] accident did it by accident and it was
[6:14] not intentionally done it was uh
[6:17] something was done and they were guilty
[6:19] but it was a bit a bit of different
[6:21] guilt because it wasn't an intentional
[6:23] thing it was an accident and God God
[6:27] thinks of
[6:28] everything
[6:30] can you say amen God has already in his
[6:33] mind he he thinks through everything
[6:36] even for today he knew this day and he's
[6:39] already has his plan right and your
[6:42] trial that you'll hit next week he's
[6:44] already got an answer for so that's our
[6:47] God Amen so so as when a man goeth in
[6:50] wood in verse six it says lest the
[6:52] Avenger of the blood pursue the Slayer
[6:54] while his heart is hot and overtake him
[6:57] i' say I say his heart is hot hot and
[6:59] the his temper is a bit hot too as well
[7:02] and bunch of other things and he
[7:04] overtake him because the way is long and
[7:06] slay him whereas he was not worthy of
[7:08] death in so much he hated him not in the
[7:11] past so here's a category that this
[7:13] person was not worthy of dying of this
[7:16] because his intent was not to do it it
[7:18] was an accident wherefore I command thee
[7:21] saying Thou shalt separate three cities
[7:23] for thee look at this now and if the
[7:25] Lord thy God enlarge thy Coast as he has
[7:28] sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all
[7:31] the land which he promised to give un
[7:32] the fathers if Thou shalt keep all of
[7:34] these Commandments to do them which I
[7:36] command the this day to love the Lord
[7:39] thy God and to walk ever in his
[7:42] ways then shalt thou add three cities
[7:46] more for thee besides
[7:48] these Grace
[7:51] Grace here's abounding
[7:54] Grace you're walking with the Lord and
[7:56] you're growing in him and you love him
[7:58] with all your heart
[7:59] make three more cities to run into when
[8:02] the devil's after
[8:05] you I love
[8:08] it that innocent blood be not shed in
[8:12] thy land which the Lord thy God giveth
[8:14] thee for an in inheritance and so blood
[8:17] the blood be upon thee but if any man
[8:20] hate his neighbor and lie and wait for
[8:22] him and rise up against him now here's a
[8:24] different category and smite him
[8:27] mortally that he die and fleeth into one
[8:30] of these cities then the Elders of his
[8:32] City shall send and fetch him then and
[8:34] deliver him into the hand of the Avenger
[8:37] of blood that he may die different
[8:41] category that's right whole different
[8:43] category thine eye shall not pity him
[8:47] but Thou shalt put away the guilt of
[8:50] innocent blood from Israel that it may
[8:54] go well with thee I want you to remember
[8:58] this statement here's the purpose I want
[9:00] you to put away the guilt of innocent
[9:05] blood the guilt of one who's truly
[9:07] guilty is one thing but I want you to
[9:10] put away the guilt of the
[9:14] innocent that's our God so Satan
[9:17] certainly does not like a minister
[9:20] dealing with these certain subjects as
[9:22] Satan is a professional in using guilt
[9:26] and using
[9:27] condemnation to mess up people's minds
[9:31] especially a True Believer Satan is a
[9:33] professional I hate to compliment him
[9:35] but he's a professional indwelling in
[9:37] the realm of guilt Satan is professional
[9:39] IND dwelling in the realm of confusing
[9:41] Believers Minds I said Satan is a
[9:44] professional in dabbling in the subjects
[9:47] of guilt and condemnation and mixing it
[9:49] with conviction and you remember that's
[9:51] why I spoke about it is just to give a a
[9:54] black eye to the enemy and and show the
[9:56] believer his position and to help in a
[9:59] healthy way separate these things so
[10:01] that we understand them the devil
[10:03] understands them but we must understand
[10:05] them we must understand in our battle
[10:08] every day the difference between
[10:09] condemnation and conviction we must
[10:12] understand that or the devil will wreak
[10:14] havoc with our minds and our and uh and
[10:16] our our condemnation and the different
[10:19] things we experience and the voices that
[10:21] speak to us so Satan sure likes to mess
[10:24] up people's minds in these subjects
[10:25] especially the True Believer and to
[10:28] where the mind and the Spirit you know
[10:29] remember the mind and the spirit is all
[10:32] Satan has left to work with in your
[10:35] body trth when you're born again and the
[10:39] soul is sealed in by God the mind and
[10:42] your spirit and your flesh is all he has
[10:45] left to deal with and so God's got the
[10:49] best
[10:51] part can you say Amen isn't it good to
[10:53] know God's got the the best part oh yes
[10:56] and God sealed himself in your soul yes
[10:59] you know if God was in in in the flesh
[11:01] in the sense he was only in my flesh
[11:03] then that wouldn't be a victory but the
[11:05] victory is is that he's sealed in my
[11:07] soul the best part and from there there
[11:09] can be such a power to take over my
[11:12] spirit to take over my mind to take over
[11:15] my flesh can you imagine how
[11:17] supernaturally it is to happen that a
[11:20] human being can live so yielded to God
[11:23] and filled with the spirit that it
[11:24] actually the Holy Ghost can bring a body
[11:28] that was net with that will never
[11:29] inherit the kingdom of God never go into
[11:31] a Rapture but it can so control the body
[11:34] and the mind it'll bring this body under
[11:36] subjection to him human beings can live
[11:39] in Victory with this body under
[11:41] subjection I tell you that's a
[11:43] supernatural Miracle that's a great
[11:45] thing but God's got the best part and
[11:47] Satan is left with the bodies Our
[11:50] Spirits our minds and so whatever he's
[11:52] left to work with he'll take that's if
[11:54] you let him take
[11:56] it can I get an amen amen
[11:59] it's what territory you let Satan have
[12:02] that he'll take you could give your mind
[12:05] wholly over to God and say I'm going to
[12:08] think on good things I'm going to think
[12:10] on positive things I just had a negative
[12:12] thought to me and so I'm going to change
[12:14] that right away by my own choice and I'm
[12:16] going to replace it with a good thought
[12:19] I just had something depress my spirit
[12:22] somebody said something or somebody
[12:23] didn't say anything but I feel depressed
[12:25] I know it's a depressing Spirit that's
[12:26] come around me but by choice I'm not
[12:29] going to let that do it I'm going to go
[12:30] over there and put some music on and in
[12:32] a matter of a few minutes of Holy Ghost
[12:34] fill music I'm going to draw myself out
[12:36] of that Spirit of depression and I'm
[12:38] going to be rejoicing the Lord because I
[12:41] have a choice of what I let Satan get
[12:43] involved in right and whatever you give
[12:46] him he'll take that's right you can be
[12:48] in depression all day long all week long
[12:51] all Christmas season
[12:53] long if you let Satan control it or you
[12:57] could have a good Christmas right and
[13:00] happy and thankful so I'm going to go
[13:03] back and read some things that I feel
[13:05] are worth repeating before I go into the
[13:08] subject of guilt a little bit I was
[13:09] going back in my notes and I read some
[13:11] things real quickly at the end because I
[13:13] didn't have much time left there's some
[13:15] good things here about conviction and I
[13:17] already talked about condemnation that's
[13:18] a final condemning there's no hope it's
[13:22] over and God doesn't dwell in that but
[13:25] he deals in conviction and you have to
[13:27] know the difference because somebody can
[13:29] be convicted by God and say I'm feeling
[13:31] condemned I'm feeling you're not being
[13:33] condemned by God but conviction of God
[13:36] is different and you want conviction of
[13:38] God you want you want that in your life
[13:41] you would never want a life without
[13:43] conviction amen so you got to know the
[13:45] difference so some people said some good
[13:47] things they said uh different writers
[13:49] and I collected some of the things what
[13:51] gives us conviction uh of sin is not the
[13:55] number of sins we have committed it is
[13:57] the sight of the Holiness of God Martin
[13:59] Jones said that and then goes on to say
[14:02] here's another writer Henry blackaby
[14:04] said when a holy God draws near in true
[14:07] in true Revival people come under
[14:10] terrible conviction of sin the
[14:12] outstanding feature of a spiritual
[14:14] awakening has been the profound
[14:17] consciousness of the presence and the
[14:19] Holiness of God you when you come into
[14:21] His presence of a holy God then all of a
[14:24] sudden your sin is exposed and that's a
[14:26] good thing that can bring a Revival cuz
[14:29] what happens is people don't just get
[14:31] convicted they repent another writer
[14:33] said conviction of sin is God's way I
[14:35] love these now conviction of sin is
[14:37] God's way of inviting you to restore
[14:40] fellowship with
[14:42] him because obviously you're away from
[14:45] him you're distant from him you feel
[14:47] convicted and you repent say God bring
[14:48] me back brings you back into restoration
[14:50] of relationship so conviction is a good
[14:52] thing that's not condemnation conviction
[14:54] is not repentance conviction leads to
[14:58] repentance but you can be convicted
[15:00] without repentance that's from Martin
[15:03] Jones another one from Martin Jones I
[15:04] think that's a good quote some other
[15:05] writers said conviction is more than the
[15:08] mere feeling and this is what I'll speak
[15:10] a little bit about tonight conviction is
[15:13] more than just the mere feeling of guilt
[15:16] for something we have done wrong it's
[15:18] normal to have to feel guilty after
[15:22] doing something that we know we
[15:23] shouldn't have done so so the tonight
[15:27] I'll talk a little bit about the feeling
[15:29] of guilt but we must distinguish the
[15:33] feeling of guilt over real guilt right
[15:37] if we did something wrong and we're
[15:38] convicted of God there there's going to
[15:41] be guilt that goes with that but then
[15:43] Satan dwells in the realm of a feeling
[15:46] of guilt and you not don't haven't
[15:48] necessarily did anything wrong but you
[15:50] got a feeling of guilt how many ever bet
[15:52] somebody in your life and they're
[15:53] professionals at making you feel
[15:55] guilty don't look at your husband or
[15:57] wife next to you please don't do that
[16:00] not in a service tell them when you get
[16:03] home but if it's not your husband or
[16:05] wife it's your children that make you
[16:08] that they make you feel guilty all the
[16:09] time or it's the parents to the children
[16:12] making their feel guilt their kids they
[16:14] never measure up you always making them
[16:16] feel guilty always talk about what they
[16:17] do wrong and never what they do right
[16:19] the feeling of guilt is not necessarily
[16:23] the conviction and the guilt that goes
[16:25] with conviction see why we got to talk
[16:27] about these things
[16:29] cuz what you might be feeling might be
[16:30] from the enemy and not from God right
[16:34] but you're just beating yourself all up
[16:36] and you're depressed and you're I wonder
[16:38] this and I wonder that and I wonder
[16:39] wonder wonder and you just become a
[16:41] wondering
[16:42] star because you're wondering all the
[16:46] time so we got to really talk about
[16:48] these things so conviction is more than
[16:50] a mere feeling of guilt for something
[16:52] we've done wrong it's normal to feel
[16:54] guilty after doing something that we
[16:55] know we shouldn't have done conviction
[16:58] go goes above and beyond having a
[17:01] feeling true conviction goes above and
[17:04] beyond having a feeling convict in the
[17:07] Greek is translated into eleno which
[17:10] means to convince someone of the truth
[17:14] to reprove to accuse in other words it's
[17:17] there's truth to
[17:18] it a feeling most of the time doesn't
[17:21] have truth to
[17:22] it but true conviction has a truth to it
[17:26] it's it's to convince someone of the
[17:28] truth truth so we see that conviction
[17:30] brings out the truth it accuses us of
[17:33] our wrongs and rebukes US of our sins as
[17:36] we have seen through the verses we have
[17:38] discussed conviction is good Brokenness
[17:42] is
[17:43] good it always draws us closer to God if
[17:48] you find yourself in deep conviction for
[17:51] something don't ignore it young people
[17:54] can learn this early in life if you find
[17:57] yourself in deep conviction about
[17:58] something and it's coming from God don't
[18:00] ever ignore that go to your prayer
[18:03] closet get right with God
[18:06] today today is the day of your
[18:09] reconciliation don't wait two weeks
[18:11] don't wait two years don't wait 20 years
[18:14] when you feel the conviction repent
[18:16] before God and reconcile with God our
[18:19] Lord wants to be with you he wants to
[18:21] manifest himself through you and he
[18:23] cannot do that if you're not right with
[18:26] him yes Brokenness is painful but it's
[18:29] necessary and it's beautiful thank God
[18:33] for conviction there is a clear
[18:35] difference between conviction and
[18:37] condemnation conviction comes from the
[18:39] Lord and it leads to life and
[18:42] joy condemnation however comes from
[18:45] Satan and it leads to despair that's
[18:49] right conviction is intended to lead us
[18:51] to the Lord but condemnation drives us
[18:54] away from the Lord so listen if you're
[18:57] feeling I'm I'm getting out out of here
[18:58] I'm going you know I'm I'm going to turn
[19:00] to things of the world I'm going to do
[19:01] this or whatever and and because I'm
[19:03] just feeling condemned that is not God
[19:06] driving you away that's Satan using it
[19:09] to drive you further away when
[19:11] conviction is involved God is doing it
[19:13] to draw you closer to
[19:15] him condemnation drives you away
[19:19] condemnation causes us to look at our
[19:23] Self Conviction causes us to look to
[19:26] Christ when someone is experiencing
[19:29] condemnation there's no solution to
[19:31] their problem you're just doomed you
[19:34] cross the line it's over you're done
[19:37] there's no hope for
[19:39] you some of Satan's
[19:41] voices with condemnation there's no
[19:44] solution to the problem but we know with
[19:47] Christ with everything there's a
[19:49] solution there's Grace can you say man
[19:52] there's an
[19:53] answer our Bible says that with every
[19:56] Temptation he will make a way of Escape
[19:59] for
[20:01] you every time true and so when someone
[20:04] is experiencing comination there's no
[20:06] solution when we're experiencing
[20:07] conviction it's meant to draw us to him
[20:10] to receive his love his grace his
[20:13] forgiveness in conviction there is hope
[20:16] because on the cross Jesus Christ died
[20:19] for all of our sins when we look to the
[20:21] Cross we find Freedom and hope in John
[20:24] 12:47 says for God did not send his son
[20:28] into the world to condemn the world but
[20:30] to save the world through him there's
[20:33] always salvation through God's
[20:36] conviction but there's always uh
[20:39] damnation and condemnation with Satan's
[20:43] condemnation if we just look at now we
[20:45] just want to go go into guilt a little
[20:48] bit tonight and just expose it
[20:53] guilt has the
[20:56] power to go beyond Beyond convicting the
[20:59] really truly
[21:01] guilty guilt can plague the innocent
[21:05] that's
[21:07] right so we have to recognize when Satan
[21:09] is using the thing of guilt and I don't
[21:11] even know necessarily what it is but we
[21:14] know it is something because we feel
[21:17] it and Satan knows that feeling and
[21:19] Satan with his voices gets in that
[21:21] feeling but the the the thing that can
[21:23] be way too powerful in Satan using it is
[21:27] the power of guilt can go beyond
[21:29] convicting the really guilty which it
[21:31] should but it also can plague the
[21:35] innocent so when you look closely at the
[21:38] Dynamics of today what's going on with
[21:40] the believer now you can see why there's
[21:43] not more visible Victory sometimes in
[21:47] Believers just ahead lies a greater
[21:50] place of Freedom just ahead lies a
[21:53] greater victory for them just ahead just
[21:56] through the sound barer just a just a
[21:58] cross just a little remember I was
[22:00] speaking a few weeks ago about your
[22:01] potentials sometimes somebody's full
[22:04] potentials are laying right there and
[22:05] they're just a step away from it and
[22:07] Satan's keeping them from greater
[22:09] potentials Satan's keeping you from a
[22:11] greater walk with the Lord because
[22:13] you're held back right there it's just
[22:15] it's just stunted right there and
[22:17] there's a greater place of freedom but
[22:19] sometimes there's a cloud of guilt that
[22:22] lays over a
[22:24] Believer that's
[22:26] right sometimes we bring it on
[22:29] ourselves sometimes other people bring
[22:31] it bring it on us and there are ways
[22:33] that we bring guilt on ourselves and
[22:35] other people can bring it we you know we
[22:39] sometimes and I'm just going to be real
[22:40] honest with you tonight sometimes we OV
[22:43] examine
[22:44] ourselves because we want to please God
[22:47] so much out of his desire that he put
[22:50] within us so now here's just a real
[22:53] dividing line here we're supposed to
[22:56] examine ourselves because the Bible says
[22:59] First Corinthians let a man examine
[23:01] himself it's before the Lord's Supper
[23:03] but every day let a man examine himself
[23:06] so I'm not knocking that but be careful
[23:08] how you're examining yourself and how
[23:10] you're measuring yourself do it with the
[23:12] word of God but don't do it by other
[23:15] people's measuring
[23:19] stick and don't do it by your own
[23:22] measuring
[23:23] stick because those of you who are real
[23:25] extreme legalistic and or or maybe OCD
[23:29] or whatever nature that you have that
[23:32] kind of especially you people you can
[23:34] set yourself in that expectations that
[23:37] you'll probably never measure up to and
[23:39] when you don't measure up that week or
[23:41] that
[23:42] day then what do you get that's right
[23:46] guilt amen but you know we got all this
[23:49] we got C we got this this you people
[23:52] that are OCD you better be listening is
[23:55] that the bad part of it great be
[23:56] organized get it all done but when you
[23:59] don't and a lot of times you
[24:01] don't true self-guilt
[24:06] guilt and you start measuring your
[24:08] character by it and then Satan comes in
[24:12] and says what a yeah I just feel like a
[24:15] loser this week and sat says
[24:19] yeah you feel like it but I really feel
[24:22] I I know you are a
[24:24] loser get all this stuff going on you're
[24:27] feeling guilt and he's he dwells in the
[24:30] realm of guilt so he jumps in and agrees
[24:32] with
[24:33] you yeah you you're really man who do
[24:37] you think you are you just can't ever
[24:39] measure up to stuff that you're supposed
[24:41] to get
[24:43] done guilt is a real thing that's in our
[24:46] lives that sometimes we bring on
[24:50] ourselves so I want to separate and say
[24:53] if God if you've done something wrong
[24:56] and God brings conviction about it make
[24:59] that right and bring it under the blood
[25:01] of Jesus Christ even God asking us to do
[25:04] that you know why it's to do it so that
[25:07] you don't live with days of
[25:10] guilt God does not want you living with
[25:14] any
[25:16] guilt you see so much guilt the devil
[25:18] uses that is not necessary there's a
[25:21] necessary guilt that comes with the
[25:23] conviction of
[25:24] sin but most of the other guilt is not
[25:27] necessary and even the true guilt and
[25:30] conviction is only temporary God wants
[25:33] you to be relieved of it when you truly
[25:35] sincerely bring it under the blood of
[25:38] Jesus Christ God forgive me I made a
[25:40] mistake I'm appealing to my great high
[25:43] priest who can be touched by the feeling
[25:46] of infirmities I'm leaving at your blood
[25:48] I mean it Lord and I mean it so much
[25:50] help me never to do that
[25:52] again that's a repentant
[25:55] heart and then he washes it away and the
[25:58] Bible says if we confess our sins he's
[26:00] faithful and just to forgive our sins so
[26:05] that our guilt can be relieved here
[26:07] there's two
[26:09] sides to this guilt in the Webster's
[26:13] Dictionary there's two sides to this one
[26:16] side of guilt one meaning of guilt is a
[26:19] remorseful awareness that you have done
[26:22] something wrong a remorseful awareness
[26:24] that you've done something wrong so we
[26:27] have that and I'll let you know this
[26:30] guilt a remorseful awareness that you've
[26:32] done something wrong was so deeply
[26:34] ingrained in us when we were
[26:38] born condemnation by representation
[26:42] that's right before you did anything
[26:44] wrong you were born with
[26:46] condemnation so guilt came with our
[26:49] birth you start growing up and you just
[26:51] you already feel there's a there's a
[26:54] cloud you're born with condemnation
[26:56] you're born with guilt by by Nature
[26:58] you're born with the guilt of sin by
[26:59] Nature that serpent nature is tied to
[27:02] Satan and his condemned defeated state
[27:05] has been on us since we are cursed
[27:07] because we come under the curse and
[27:09] that's where it all
[27:11] started Satan felt like
[27:15] dirt and makes you feel like dirt
[27:18] because he was cast to the
[27:23] dirt maybe the reason you feel like dirt
[27:27] is because the one that was cursed to
[27:31] dirt right is talking to you every
[27:39] day we're born with that by
[27:41] representation it's called The Guilt of
[27:43] sin but I got to quote if you guys would
[27:44] bring it up the guilt of sin and we're
[27:46] guilty but Calvary came through with not
[27:49] only an atonement but a release from the
[27:52] guilt of sin how many can say Amen that
[27:54] Calvary came through not only with an
[27:56] atonement for our sin but a release from
[27:59] the guilt of sin can you say amen amen
[28:02] that's right Calvary not only paid for
[28:05] our sins but it released us from the
[28:07] guilt of sin thank you for watching our
