TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to read in ii peter and then in second corinthians chapter 7 and verse 1 as well and we're talking about what is between you and the promises so let's just read first of all in second peter speaks of the promise in second peter chapter 1 and verse 3 and 4 according as he as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be the partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so it's through the precious promises of god and that's why it's so important for us to take possession of all the promises of god as our own because the power is that we become a partaker of the divine nature and we escape the corruption of the world that's pretty powerful and then back here in second corinthians if you would chapter 7 and verse 1 it said as we read this last sunday we want to read it again put it back in our minds having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god and to remind you from last sunday for when he refers to these promises you'd have to read a few scriptures before that and what is the promises that when we become separate he will be a father to us ye shall be my sons and daughters i will walk in them they will be my people and when we have those words we have relationship with him and so the promises of god what these promises are a relationship with him there's nothing more important in our lives than our relationship with him and that's a promise it's it's not just something we work ourselves into but it's a promise of god and a promise of god it stands alone by itself but we have to possess it and take it once we take it then all that god has in that promise will flow and and have the power behind it because we don't have to work to make that promise work it is what it is god provides for amen may god bless the reading of his word this morning and baby seated paul in the bible refers to the mystery of christ and he's the first one to refer to that term the mystery of christ as a matter of fact paul said i preached christ in a mystery and nobody back in that day really understood all that he was saying by that but he didn't just say i preached christ if he were just to say i preached christ then he would have talked about jesus three and a half years of ministry in matthew mark luke and john he would have referred because that's the only christ people knew then is the christ that had spent three and a half years on the earth and so i don't know if you know this but paul wasn't there for that the disciples were but paul wasn't there to observe jesus in that state in his fleshly body as he healed the sick and raised the dead and so we have that account today matthew mark luke and john but paul had a bit of a deeper calling in that he says i preached christ in a mystery nobody had ever heard that term before so that shows us it's not complicated that there was a mystery in christ further than what he acted out in matthew mark luke and john there was something within him can you say amen john makes another term in first revelations one he says the revelation of jesus christ i don't think too many people had heard that term so it was taking things a bit deeper and paul was commissioned 14 books of the new testament paul had a special calling on him to bring something deeper than just talk about jesus life of three and a half years he was preaching the mystery of christ in other words there was a mystery inside of christ further than just jesus when he was on earth it was to continue on how do we understand that how do we understand what that mystery was i like simple terms i like to understand it by shadows and types in the bible and understanding it simple i have to have it simple how many like to have it simple i like to have things simple because if it says if it's mysterious and i'm not getting it what good are we why are we here but god has a way of making things simple to us and the simplest way we could go throughout the bible and show what the mystery of christ is but the simplest way is to look at adam the first the first adam adam was the first adam and we had the second adam jesus christ but when he was created there was a mystery in adam and that mystery was eve right and god formed her but he took eve from adam and so she was part of the mystery of adam she was part of him she was one with him in spirit can you say amen and so this mystery that laid within him he was one a matter of fact one scripture in genesis refers to them being both adam and eve but it wasn't until then he took the rib out and he formed eve that we finally get to see this mystery that was laying in adam and that was eve she was the mystery laying within adam so that shows us when christ was at calvary there was a mystery laying within him so it wasn't just jesus of the three and a half years but when he went to calvary and the soldier took that spear and pierced his side and water and blood came out and spirit came out we realized spirit came out and that it didn't end right there with jesus but there was a mystery in him if there's how many believe that that jesus was the second adam that's biblical can you say man well if there's a second adam there has to be a second eve if there's a first eve that fell by the word there has to be a second eve that comes back to the full word and she is the bride the chosen ones the believers who are going to fully believe christ she has it within her to believe all of christ because she's a part of christ she came out of christ when paul begins to bring this then you know he you say well where are you referring to well he brings it in so many ways but one place he talks about the jews he said the jews they have their place and different things but he said god was going to bring in a gentile bride and he said he blinded the jews for a season so he could bring in a gentile bride so he's preaching the mystery of christ the mystery of christ is the bride coming out of christ in every age in every church age culminating in this last age there will be a bride that won't fall like eve did but shall be a word bride can i get an amen this morning so uh that's my complicated part and hopefully it was simple but that's that's uh i'm gonna get move on a little bit now because i have a lot of practical things today to talk about when we talk about what is between you and the promise so the disciples could relay the stories of christ in his earthly ministry but paul said there's a mystery in christ and we realize it it was she that was in him so you see then that this relationship with christ is a relationship it's not a religion men follow after religions and men follow after even some of christianity that's become a religion but it's never meant to be a religion when you talk about a husband and wife becoming one by spirit that's not a religion my marriage with sister rebecca is not a religion of do's and don'ts she tells me what to do and i do them or i tell her what to do and she better do them what kind of marriage would that be but out of love out of her heart and we connected and something jailed i just happen to believe there's something before the foundation of the world in god's plan that had us as mates together can you say man and if you believe that about your marriage that that she was something within you she was taken out of you she's a counterpart that's a part of you and god gave me back to her if you believe that about your marriage which you should then we ought to believe it about christ and his bride that it's not a religion it's a relationship amen it's not a duty it's a love we connected because she was a part of me and so much more the christ and his bride it's not a religion it's not a duty we are dutiful people we do follow the rules but if it's a religion and not a relationship we've lost something so this is a mystery and when a person receives this they become one with christ by the holy ghost his promises become his promises become our promises in other words adam and eve christ and his bride his promises are ours we inherit those promises everything that he said we can take that as a promise from him and he's a groom he's a he's a husband who hasn't ever broke his promise now praise the lord we as human men we might break a promise we shouldn't but we we're flawed by humanness can you say amen but this husband of christ has never brother ray he's never broke a promise he's never failed that's what we preached last sunday his covenant can never fail you can fail but he can't fail his covenant is not dependent upon you your mistakes or whatever it is it's not it's dependent he swore by himself he made a covenant by himself and i'm glad he didn't make a covenant with me because i would fail but when you come into the promise and covenant of god it has an element to it it there's no flaw in it it doesn't fail it's going to carry through it's going to be finished his promises are yea and amen and god will fulfill every promise he's always done it he always will now i don't know about you but me a bride takes great security from a man that keeps his promises can you say praise the lord i take great security in that he's never broke a promise so i can trust in every promise of this bible and every promise of this bible is mine i don't dump any of it out it's mine i take it as a possession so now the enemy though is against you coming together in this union and this relationship how many know the enemies against it the enemy is against oneness the enemy his main thing is against oneness when the people become one with god he's against it jesus when he did his miracles you never hear the jews or the pharisees taking up stones against them but when jesus said one day i and my father are one they took up stones against him and that wasn't just them that was the enemy who hates oneness can you say amen and this bride of christ and christ is becoming one with his word more and more as we speak in this last days she's becoming one and that's why the devil's fighting you so hard that's why he's against you it's not your personality it's not that he don't like being around you it's when you become one in relation with ship with christ and you begin to grow in that relationship and the devil's put on your feet he doesn't know what to do with you but he's going to keep fighting this week in my family and we had one of the roughest times this week besides me having to haul a foot of snow out of my quarter-mile driveway that was that was just a natural thing that i didn't expect you know i've had people visit my home last summer when i got it and one of the nice things about it's a quarter mile driveway a beautiful tree especially in the fall and you just drive down it and it's so nice a quarter of a mile just to get to the house and it's like you know you're just toting along there this is beautiful people have said what a beautiful drive you know and i get in my truck and i've never had that i've lived right on the street in toledo right in the street in slovenia and traffic going by so i quarter my oh wow that's great you know it's almost heaven west virginia blue ridge you just feel like you're going out to west virginia but i forgot when the snow came i wasn't thinking that i'd be out a half a day hauling a foot of snow out of that quarter-mile driveway but praise the lord anyhow the devil's been fighting in other ways my family this week mental battles depression sickness he's not going to let up and the reason he doesn't like us friends is not because of our personality or something it's because when we come in one with this word in our relationship he cannot stand that oneness that's why i'm preaching today about what is between you and the promises of god what is between you and the relationship with god because anything that's between you and the relationship you want to remove it nothing can you say amen and brother branham says here in 1963 this is a great quote from brother branham why do you hunger church why do you thirst if you guys can pull that up if you had it the enemy is against this oneness and this is the way you said it in christ the mystery of god reveal you guys have that why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world you let some pastor you let somebody else get it out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsty hungry it's god trying to reveal it to you see the revelation at the beginning the quote why do you hunger church why are you thirst who put that thirst within you god put a thirst within you for more of him he created a thirst for more of him and so you have that craving but he's saying there's things that get in between you and him revealing that to you he's mentioned the pastor he's mentioned your husband and wife the cares of this world that's pretty close things but we have our trials and we have our our hiccups in life and we have our sicknesses and we have all kinds of things that come and all many times it's something to get in between we have people who are against us people gossip against us people and i'll talk about some more things today but things get in between us and the promises and what we learn is we've been speaking in this about the promised land and joshua coming into the promised land and the difference in the people being under moses a prophet and under joshua in the promised land is the agenda to come out of egypt and come out of the wilderness is to take the promised land that was theirs and they had to fight every inch of the way to get it you have to fight for every promise of god it's not going to come easy can you say amen the devil doesn't want you to take the promises and so the land that god gave israel was the type of our land our bible promises satan doesn't want you to take them and possess them and take them for yourself as long as the pastor's preaching about them that's fine but i'm preaching you should take the promises yourself and live in those promises and remove the things that are in between you and the promises they had to remove what was in between they had to destroy the enemy they had to put the enemy under their feet so you are so that you're not stuck where you are in your relationship with the lord you have to break through and go beyond where you are how many want to go beyond where you are god bless you three four of us i said how many wants to go beyond where you are you know back when they they they realized there was a sound when they had the supersonic airplanes or whatever they realized when they got to a certain speed they would break what was called the sound barrier but did you know once it gets right to that moment of of breaking through the sound barrier the the unit begins to shake and there's noise and we hear that noise sometimes and that's what happens a lot of times in people's life they can't get beyond their sound barrier they can't be get they get stuck in a certain area in their life and that's because the enemy is holding them back and so sometimes the preaching comes forth from the pulpit and people even shake a little bit and they squirm a little bit because why god's calling them to a deeper walk with christ and they can't break the barrier they can't go beyond where they're at but what you don't realize in that sound barrier it may shake a little bit it may make a lot of noise but once it breaks through it becomes unlimited the speed that it can take and i'll say to your life once you break through the barriers that satan has put there you're going to find victory on the other side you're going to live in the promises of god you're going to have a victory that you've never experienced before saying all the promises of god are yeah and amen they are my promises they're not just the pastors they're not just someone else but they're my promises and satan's keeping me from them and i'm going to fight every inch of the way until i take them back for me this is my inheritance you remember when i started this series i said people get pretty ugly sometimes when they know they have an inheritance coming and and it's not theirs yet they go fight for it they go to court for it if somebody's not just giving it to them they got to go fight for what's theirs somebody left me inheritance and i'm going to go fight for it but people spiritually won't fight for their spiritual inheritance they won't fight for their land they let too many things get in the way of this mystery as brother branham called it and so number one everybody ready for these i got about 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 of them but i'm only going to get to about four today so we'll continue this the next few sundays because i'll never have realized last night i'll never get to it that's one of the greatest promises if you turn with me to acts 2 38 and i'm preaching on what is between you and the promises acts 2 acts 2. verse 37 now when they had heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and notice that prick in their heart means they were convicted by the preaching that peter had just done there's a conviction in the heart that's where it starts the holy spirit moves upon a life under conviction it's not a mechanical exercise but the holy spirit convicts the heart they were pricked in their heart what do we do need to do to be saved god was already working on their hearts before they come to this and peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost next scripture for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call the holy ghost coming to you is the promise it is a promise but is one of the greatest promises can you say amen and so he says that the promise is unto you and your children so but if you step back in the scripture before what would keep somebody from the promise of the holy ghost lack of repentance and that's my first one if you want to write it down first one that we have as something that gets in between you and the promise of the holy ghost is repentance because if you don't repent you can't come to the gift of the holy ghost if you don't repent you can't come to the gift of the holy ghost can you say amen and notice it didn't end you know some churches say that the holy ghost ended in the book of acts it doesn't end in the book of acts matter of fact there's no amen at the book of acts the book of acts didn't end at acts it continues on no man has a right to say that every everything stopped there no man has a right to say that there's no amen at the end of it and here's another proof he said this promise of the holy ghost is unto you and unto your children as many as the lord our god shall call i don't find any ending to that so today i can believe from my children that they should receive the holy ghost as well he didn't put an end of an age he didn't put any time he said this promise it's your promise it's the gift of the holy ghost if you repent you receive the gift of the holy ghost and it doesn't end in acts it's unto you and to your children there's a multi-generational vision there's a goal for your kids teach them the things of god teach them that they get them right in that rest atmosphere do all of that but i'll tell you you need to pray that a true experience with christ happens with your kids more than anything else and guess what parents this promise is unto you and your children and all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call i'm in the last generation here but i'm saying people god's still calling people and if he's still calling people people can still receive the holy ghost oh there ought to be a bigger amen than that this is bible friends this is repentance and baptism but what keeps people from the holy ghost repentance true genuine repentance and not talking about a forced thing not talking about a mental exercise god is convicting the heart god is pricking the heart and if you don't repent then you can't have this rep promise and so this may be very basic to you but listen this is probably the ultimate promise to talk about what has been between you and the promise of the holy ghost lack of repentance something in between you and one of these and this promise and acts 19 verse 2 says by the way have you received he said to the men that were already baptized under john's baptism have you received the holy ghost since you believed not when you believe but since you believed showing that this is something deeper than just a mental exercise this is a conversion this is a change of nature this is his divine nature coming inside of us this isn't us trying to be like christ with our old nature this is him changing our nature to put his nature within us that we can live this word genesis chapter 12 and verse 1. we'll go to abraham here for the next one and we're talking about separation a little bit what's things that keep you from the promises well here abraham and genesis 12 had to boy they got it quicker than i got my bible open they got it up there already genesis 12 and verse 1 now the lord said unto abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed praise the lord what a blessing what a promise he gave to this heathen man he was a heathen he was an idol worshiper and god comes and says i'm going to bless you i'm going to bless your generation and bless your seed him and his wife were barren as they said last sunday they were barren and he had to believe something impossible that he would be the father of many nations and here's here's the promise i'm giving you a promise i'm making you a promise abraham but what did he have to do first what was in between abraham and the promise right there separating from his country separating from his kindred so i want to talk about just a minute family what would happen if abraham said you know what my family's too close to me my father's house we're just too tight would abraham would have taken the promise no because god told him you've got to separate from all that in order to receive the promise did he not say it now i'm not here on a campaign today to separate all your family members that's not what i'm trying to do what i'm trying to say is that when god calls you to his promise of relationship with him nothing can stand in the way and many times i'm speaking from experience and i'm speaking from watching people's lives family is the thing that keeps you from moving on with christ believe it or not family and maybe that's why god told abraham in order for this to work in order for you to latch a hold of the promise and go to your land you're going to have to leave your kindred leave your father's house and it's kind of like he says to the young man when he's leaving leave and cleave in other words a man must leave father and mother and cleave unto his wife separation is involved and if a person isn't willing to separate then they're not willing to take the full promise of god can you say amen and so this was in between him and the promise and so it may seem to you it may seem strange to you that god would say this but family can get in between you and the promises sometimes family can be the greatest thing in the world or they can be the greatest hindrance sometimes to your life in christ i'm gonna get real practical here family can be the greatest thing in the world but in my observation i have watched family members with an agenda to keep people from moving on to the promise of god usually it's unbelievers but guess what sometimes it's not always unbelievers sometimes as people don't have a true experience with christ and they're in church but they're influencing them to do a different thing instead of move on with god and you have to watch this so closely because it's it's almost like a default thing that we do to cling to family it has such emotional ties to it right has a lot of emotion to it and some of that is good some of that is normal in fact that is that is normal we have closer emotional ties to family sometimes than we do that are not family but if we take it too far we tend to draw our safety and our counsel from family because we have the roots there we have the emotional thing there we have the tie there and we tend to default to clinging back to family when life gets a little bit of struggle we can clean the family instead of clinging to the lord you might get quiet but that's all right i'm going to go ahead and say it anyway i'm telling you family can be used of the enemy if you're not watching closely to keep you from crossing the sound bearer and drawing closer to the promises of god mother-in-law's father-in-law's and i never like to speak against my mother-in-law because she's not one of those bad ones all the mother-in-law jokes i can't use on my mother-in-law because she's a great one she's a woman of god holy ghost filled wonderful wonderful woman i always like to use those jokes but i can't use them because i got a good mother-in-law you know the joke that says the penalty for polygamy what's the penalty for polygamy two mother-in-laws so now i could go on and on and on but i can't use them with my mother-in-law but i'm telling you i've watched situations mother-in-law mothers fathers can not realize it but they're getting in the way of a son or a daughter finding the holy ghost finding their own life in christ sometimes finding their vision for life finding what their calling is and they're micromanaging and just keeping all that famine together and mother hen is is controlling the whole thing now am i alone in this or have people seen this before and it becomes a detriment to a young man or a young woman because they're in they've drawn a comfort from the security of a family i've actually watched where parents will shield their kids from the conviction of the holy ghost thinking that's doing them damage you do not want to shield your kids if it's the true conviction of the holy ghost if they're crying and being moved by the spirit of god to give their heart to god and be baptized that's nothing to be afraid of if they've been corrected by the word that's nothing to be afraid of you want that in their lives you want the voice of truth in their life you want them to be corrected but to step in there and try to to be a buffer for the oh we don't want to hurt their feelings you're a detriment to that child let them hear the truth let them hear the voice of truth let them be convicted by the holy spirit because that's when they come to a real true experience with the lord can you say amen amen i hope i'm making i hope i'm not making more enemies here this morning praise the lord family can be the greatest thing in the world but it can be a great hindrance families can make decisions for other family members and it can take you away from your life in christ can you say amen mother-in-laws mothers sometimes sometimes overly exercise too much control over the entire family mom has exercised control over our boys and they won't let them become men exercise too much over their boys and won't let them become men they're too involved they're treating them like a little boy still that's a great problem especially if they're coming to their own vision and their own calling in life you can be a hindrance to that you say amen and the normal pattern is for moms to raise them then the daddy and this is in leadership that you'll find this in the message leadership after mom raises them then she turns them over to a schoolteacher and then the school teacher influences them and then daddy teaches in the family trader whatever he teaches he teaches and trains them for life then at that point mother is to withdraw and kind of a little bit and not her love but withdraw her input as much when he becomes a man because the daddy gives some of that this is the normal thing if that doesn't happen you're going to be a detriment to that young man it's not like it was when this momma and baby it's not liking us and then even daddy's gives them training does all he can but there's a certain point that they have to cut the cords and let that boy find his calling and the blueprint for his life you see god has the blueprint for your children's life not you not you but when you got it all figured out and what career they're going to do and which directions they should go so you weigh in pretty heavy and that boy or that girl struggles because they're praying about what god wants them to do they're calling in life they're supposed to find their way and god god has a blueprint for that young man that young woman's life god has a plan now if they come and ask which a lot of times some kids don't come and ask anymore which is very frustrating to me because i'm used to being asked and if i'm not asked i weigh in my opinion anyway me and becca are both firstborns we're both drivers and you know that can have an effect on kids after so many years because we weigh in and we you know we do it and so it's been a transition for us to wait until they ask us to weigh in and there's a lot of biting of the tongue that goes on because you want to say something now if they live in my home let me just balance this out they live in my home and they're doing something that's bringing a bad spirit in my home or they're living something that's not the representation of our home they're going to hear it from us because that's my duty as a parent i'm going to be polite about it and say we don't believe that as a family i don't want that in my home if you want to have all this worldly stuff you're going to have to move out i've never had to say that thankfully but we weigh in when things are wrong if there's an evil spirit we sense that's keeping us up at night we're going to be vocal about it and that's the problem today parents aren't vocal enough about those things you can't let those things go but as far as the calling on a man's life young man's life let that boy get a hold of god and find what his calling is because god has the blueprint for his life what am i talking about i'm talking about family members who can get in the way of of us sometimes even you that are older ones family members are still weighing in pretty heavy and they determine decisions that are made and i just say for you young men young married men and young married women get all the advice you can you have to make the decisions for yourself but don't let everybody else always make your decisions get all the good counsel you can but then go before god and make a decision based on the word of god and stick with it and if some other influence from family says you don't have to do that and oh you don't have to do that don't spank those kids that's a grandparent's statement oh you don't need to do that that's a good little boy i mean look at all the good that he's done and his smiles and how pretty she is back off a little bit and then your kids are looking to say back off you didn't back off from me let's this back off come from where's that come from i don't remember you backing off at all but we have to be careful because there's a certain point in his head if they're asking for the advice but we've got to let the image of god and what god has called them to to serve the lord as their family we've got to give that freedom the worst part is when it hinders somebody's walk with the lord in a family's walk with the lord there's a normal letting go especially when god is calling god has a blueprint specific to their lives and it wasn't drawn up by mom or dad but god but family is a very strong influence it gets in between you and the promises many times be careful of that it's terribly strong on human beings because we we we we we have roots with our family we have connections emotional connections um and so sometimes we can talk people right out of the conviction they feel for god to do something and talk them right out of being at church faithfully and let me say this as i come to the end of this part it is not good for parents to pass on their resentment towards the church or towards the church people that is so unfair what you need to do is get an honor repentance and repent of your resentment and get healed of your resentment but if you don't don't pass that resentment on to your kids let them have a fresh look at christ a fresh look at the church a fresh look at people in the church let them have a fresh look don't require them to continue on your bitterness it's unfair many times you say well why don't kids respond more to the gospel and why don't kids many times it's family members who have put so much seeds in their mind against preachers and against the church and pete church people and be leery of them and they're the legalistics and all be careful the seeds you plant in those kids mind my dad used to say it this way and he was talking about elisha when those parents talked about elisha and put him down and called him baldi around the kitchen table probably and then those kids could go and just disrespect elijah and call them old baldy and elijah called a curse on him and the she bears come out you see but he said it was the parents that somebody had to tell those kids that to have such disrespect for the prophet like that somebody had to say it and they heard it around the house putting down preachers putting down ministers you know it seems like the holy spirit just wants me to keep on this subject a little while there's something wrong when that goes on because you are putting something in between your kids in the promises and he said he talked to them so much and said this so much to parents that now they had disrespect for him and god just god destroyed their at least elijah he called the shebas out and so when we we have to be careful we're not passing on our old bitterness and our own incidences that happen took place our old things that that our old old conversations and corrupted conversations we pass it on to our kids and it's not fair they need a fresh look at christ they need to keep their innocence about them you know the pastor's home is a difficult place because we have to go out of our way to be careful that we don't say things that would put impressions sometimes the wrong impression in people's minds and our kids minds we have to be so careful and more more careful but all of us need to be mindful that we can pass on our bitterness and our resentment let me go back to your parents you know what either the altar here or the altar in your heart is the only solving of that bitterness and that's what we'll get into in the next couple sundays people can get in people who have done you wrong can get in between you and your full promises of god you're living way below your potential in the lord because you are so affected by people who have looked at you wrong who have done you wrong well guess what you know if if the church is the only place that that happens then you're being lied to because i can have people look at me wrong at walmart i don't even know who they are if i was going on how people looked at me and they give me the elevator look or they give my wife the elevator look up and down and up and down people do that everywhere shouldn't we teach our children our kids that people are people anywhere even within the body of christ they have their humanness about them and they'll fail you why do we have this thing that their church have to be perfect and when they're not perfect oh they should have been a better christian than that i'm leaving the church and they go find all their friends out in the world thinking they're never going to do them wrong i'm here to tell you the world is a lot more cruel in things i'd rather any day to have my kids around this congregation take the very worst of us in this congregation which i won't mention names i stand with the very worst of us here okay as being people of god and i would lead my children to say listen you're better off to be around people like that than the people of the world with all their corpse and all their weirdness and you know things they say out of place sometimes you're better off there because in the midst that some holy ghost-filled people can't find a better atmosphere than holy ghost people is this all right with everybody we have to be careful and we have to be careful of mamas and daddies and and sometimes somebody can be older and still depending on their daddy depending on their mommy and they're making decisions for them they're making decisions for them that's actually keeping them from a deeper walk with god because mom you know she's everything dad he's everything be careful of that they may be getting in between you and their promise and guess what they don't even know it they don't even know they're doing it it's just become a normal thing to them and it's like a coddling of little my baby boy or calling him my baby girl and listen on the other side of this is the promises of god for you it's a great thing just if you bring up matthew chapter 10 verse 34 this is the way jesus said look what he said think not that i come to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother i didn't say it jesus said it thought he was supposed to come to see peace well he is some sent to and peace to us but if there's something in between you and him the word is the sword and it's going to cut you away from that so you can be closer to the lord you understand what the scripture is saying so i've come to sin there's going to be variants and there's going to have to be some separation if it's keeping you from he explains it later he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me ask yourself the question do i love my family more than i love the lord oh it's so quiet in here do i love my daughters and sons more than i love the lord what if they were to go awry are you going to continue with the lord are you just going to go along with them it's about you and the lord it's about you in the promises he says and he that taketh not up his cross and followed after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it did he just tie losing your life and finding it to family sometimes that you can embrace a life with family family family and lose the life of the lord could it be that's what jesus is saying what if some of your family is in between you and the promises that's all i'm saying if your whole life is just your family it'll be empty at the end i'm going to say it again if your whole life is wrapped up in just your family it'll be empty at the end don't be discourteous to family members love them be kind but don't let them get in between you and the promises of god is that okay with everybody what time is it all right it's time oh my 20 to one so i'm gonna have to skip let's skip to the end skip to the end there's a few in hebrews i want to get to i'll get to them next sunday some really good ones in hebrews the children of israel and i want to talk about this really good ones that gets them in between us and the promise but here's let's take let's jump to the last one here on the on one that i believe is gets between you and the promise and that's compromise the first meeting to compromise is settle a dispute by mutual concession meet each other halfway find the middle ground come to terms come to an understanding make a deal if you're making a deal with the devil it's not a good thing making concessions find a happy medium strike a balance give and take split the difference sometimes we have to do this in a marriage sometimes so it can be a good thing but then we realize it can be a bad thing when it comes to the devil or compromising on the word of god we don't compromise the word of god for family or anyone else we don't compromise uh when it comes to the devil telling us something different than the word of god we don't make a deal with the devil the other meaning to compromise is accept standards that are lower than desirable you compromise on standards that you used to believe years ago god does not want us to compromise if it was true 30 years ago it's true today if it was in the word many years ago we believed it and lived it and dressed that way and acted that way it's still true don't let culture take away our absolutes if it was true you know what for a woman that wore a bikini 100 years ago she was put in the jail as an insane woman if that was true back then it's true today there's something wrong with a woman like that now you wouldn't never say that to personally to a person but it's happening in culture that things that are acceptable now were not acceptable years ago common sense said there's something wrong with that person being naked don't compromise on the standards of the word of god can you say amen if you're living a compromising life then then it's keeping you from the full promise of god can you say amen compromise keeps you from the promise but sometimes if we remove the compromises out of our life then we realize we're left with one thing a matter of fact if you took the word calm off of this then you would have your promise amen if you took some dot-coms out of your life you'd have a lot more of the promises oh way too many dot coms that are not healthy that are not right some of you boys dabbling in some of those dot coms that are wrong and you know it maybe if you remove those dot coms you'd be a moral boy that's taken possession of the promises of god in your life and in a greater relationship with christ brother brahman says something here that will end on today is such a good thing i wanted to read it in this service wonderful thing he says here we never join the church or come into the church to come to a picnic we must realize we are coming to a battleground i never come for people to pat me on the back and say brother branham you're a wonderful person no sir i come there with a shield on i don't need a shield for that i come with a helmet and the armor i come to fight fight every inch of the ground god told joshua every place the soldier of your foot treads upon that i give you so footsteps meant possession and when the church gets to a place it compromises with creeds and compromises with the word and compromises with the world look at that compromises with creeds creeds and dogmas take away from the bible trees and dogs makes people compromise and take certain parts out of the bible that they shouldn't we don't have a right to do that leave the bible the way that it is the denominational creeds set up their thing that takes pieces of the bible out this isn't meant to be this isn't and so they establish it that's a compromise and then he says copper white was the next one he says compromising with the word we shouldn't compromise with the word and then we shouldn't compromise with the world i mean i mean then it's losing ground it's taking back what we need tonight is soldiers to possess every divine promise of this bible that god promised to the church whole armor of god and to stand can you say amen with the whole armor of god as brother andrew said wednesday night we are we are contenders of the faith that was delivered to the saints one scripture says they withdraw from the faith but otherwise says we contend for the faith there's millions of people withdrawing from the original faith but this bride of christ will not withdraw shall contend for it i'm holding on to it i've got my armor on i'm taking hold every promise of god people are trying to take them away from me but i'm holding on to the promises of god i stand on his promises i'm standing on his promises one by one can you say amen and i love that because he says we can't compromise on the world with the world we can't compromise with the word and we can't compromise with creeds and dogmas so many influences that cause us to compromise but if we remove those compromises we're left with the promise of god to embrace to hold and to say every promise in the book is mine next sunday the next two sundays probably is looking like now more and more and i can guarantee you it's going to get even more practical than it got today i'm a rubber meets the road preacher how many in my congregation would raise your hand say that's true so close to the road i don't even like it sometimes but we're going to get down to the nitty-gritty some more because it does no good to just preach way up here in the mysteries of god if we don't get down where we're living at and find what's in between you my brother and sister and the full promise of god just on the other side of jordan is all the promises of god and they belong to you they don't belong to the world they belong to you why aren't you taking them why aren't you saying lord every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line and i am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book it can get
