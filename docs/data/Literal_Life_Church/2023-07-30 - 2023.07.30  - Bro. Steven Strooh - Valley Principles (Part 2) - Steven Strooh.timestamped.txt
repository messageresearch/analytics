[0:00] in chapter 11 verse 1. now Faith is the
[0:03] substance of things hoped for the
[0:05] evidence of Things Not Seen got two
[0:09] special Words Their substance and
[0:11] evidence and then of course Things Not
[0:14] Seen meaning it's in another dimension
[0:16] and will perhaps pick up on that a
[0:19] little bit later and then verse 2 for
[0:22] buy it the that's by faith the elders
[0:25] obtained a good report and through faith
[0:28] we understand that the worlds were
[0:30] framed by the word of God so that things
[0:33] which are seen were not made of things
[0:36] which do appear and so they were framed
[0:40] by the word of God so I think we have a
[0:42] basis for faith if you imagine faith in
[0:45] the picture that the frame all right is
[0:48] uh is the words that that frame our
[0:52] faith the word of God frames our faith
[0:55] it's the borders of our faith so and
[0:58] then let's just drop down to verse 5 by
[1:02] faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:04] should not see death and was not found
[1:07] because God had translated him so again
[1:11] we have this concept of another
[1:13] dimension for
[1:15] before his translation he had this
[1:18] testimony that he pleased God now what
[1:21] does it mean to please God or answers
[1:23] that in the next verse 6 but without
[1:26] faith it is impossible to please him for
[1:29] he that comes to God must believe that
[1:32] he is
[1:33] first of all that he exists and that he
[1:37] is a rewarder of those them that
[1:40] diligently seek Him may the Lord add
[1:43] this blessing to the reading of his word
[1:44] that's powerheads Heavenly Father once
[1:46] again Lord we just come before you we
[1:48] come before your great throne of grace
[1:50] and of mercy and Lord we just pray that
[1:53] you would undertake uh this morning for
[1:55] every need that's present here or online
[1:58] with those screaming Lord we just pray
[2:01] that your Holy Spirit which is certainly
[2:03] not bound by space or time can reach out
[2:06] to every heart that's uh that's
[2:09] listening this morning and even those
[2:10] that would listen later online and on
[2:13] the archives Lord we just pray that
[2:15] there'd be something in the service for
[2:16] each one of them this morning and Lord
[2:19] may your word go forth with power and
[2:21] the Lord with life and Lord May there be
[2:25] a resulting surge in faith this morning
[2:27] as we read your word and we we frame our
[2:31] thinking with the within the confines of
[2:33] your word not man's word but your will
[2:36] and Lord we just trust that you would
[2:38] meet with us this morning even as We
[2:40] Gather here Lord and move me out of the
[2:43] way let your Holy Spirit be the teacher
[2:46] this morning we ask it in Jesus name
[2:48] amen
[2:50] right you may be seated
[2:52] right we nearly at Battle speed
[2:56] all right so we're going to jump right
[2:58] in uh to this
[3:00] um passage in the Amplified because I
[3:03] want to just give you some uh
[3:07] some more of this framework of how we
[3:10] understand faith
[3:12] so as we mentioned last time that Faith
[3:15] was a bit like gravity it's something
[3:17] that we can easily describe
[3:20] what it does we could even describe a
[3:23] little bit about how it works but if you
[3:26] ask somebody that knows Professionals in
[3:29] the field of physics and you ask them
[3:31] what is gravity
[3:34] clueless they can write big books about
[3:36] how and why but they can't explain what
[3:40] it is and so similar with faith so we
[3:43] have a whole Bible full of Faith so we
[3:45] can certainly read it we can certainly
[3:46] see how it works we can see how God can
[3:50] can make it work but when we ask
[3:52] ourselves what is faith
[3:54] that's a little more tricky and it's
[3:57] because it's in another dimension it's
[4:00] something that has to come by revelation
[4:02] and if we understand that concept where
[4:06] 90 of the way there and we and I just
[4:09] want to say this we understand that it's
[4:11] a gift that God gives it to us and he
[4:15] given to everyone The Measure of Faith a
[4:17] portion of faith we we have to have
[4:19] something within us to respond to God in
[4:22] the first place right so he has to put
[4:24] the deposit in and then he can start to
[4:26] build on it like we talked last time and
[4:28] you get some Faith muscles going through
[4:30] practice and through exercise and I
[4:35] don't want to say too much about
[4:36] exercise so we'll just leave that to
[4:38] your imagination it's one of those
[4:40] things I can talk about maybe not quite
[4:43] produce it myself but I can certainly uh
[4:45] understand when it works for somebody
[4:47] else but faith is a muscle that we have
[4:51] to exercise we have to use and that's
[4:53] why God gives us Valley experiences so
[4:57] faith is the Assurance the confirmation
[4:58] or title deed of the things we hope for
[5:01] so I mentioned last time it's worth
[5:04] repeating faith is the things that
[5:06] happened in the past
[5:08] faith in in is the written word the
[5:12] things that we can read the experiences
[5:14] that we've had in our own lives uh help
[5:16] us to have faith for the future and so
[5:19] it's the things we hope for so those are
[5:22] the hope is what's in the future but
[5:24] love remember faith hope and love love
[5:28] is the glue that binds those two things
[5:31] together the love of God our love for
[5:34] God and that's what holds that Faith
[5:36] together with that hope I hope that
[5:39] makes uh some sense so it's the
[5:41] Assurance or confirmation of things that
[5:44] we hope for so if we did not have faith
[5:46] if we did not have the scripture if we
[5:49] did not have the word of God if we did
[5:50] not have past experiences with God it
[5:53] would put our hope and Jeopardy and so
[5:55] if we know that we have hope guess what
[5:58] we must have and we must have faith so
[6:01] we go oh do I have faith well let me ask
[6:03] you this question do you have hope
[6:05] do you believe that you're going to be
[6:07] with the Lord one day you believe that
[6:08] he's going to give us a change in the
[6:10] body that's going to be a catching away
[6:11] we believe that oh we've had faith
[6:14] so it goes together and the way we know
[6:17] that we have that is because the love of
[6:21] God is abroad in our hearts because
[6:22] of what he's done for us because he
[6:24] loves us and he says that it's the proof
[6:28] of things we do not see it's the proof
[6:30] of things in another dimension and I
[6:33] just want to remind you of my one of my
[6:35] favorite verses Romans chapter 1 verse
[6:37] 20 for the invisible things of him from
[6:40] the very beginning are now clearly seen
[6:42] being understood by the things that are
[6:44] made even his eternal power in Godhead
[6:46] so that they are with that excuse so
[6:48] when the scripture says it's proof of
[6:50] things we do not see well there are
[6:52] things that we can see that's proof of
[6:55] another world of another dimension of
[6:57] another place that we can
[7:02] at least believe it exists or it's hard
[7:06] for us to imagine or picture but we know
[7:08] that it's there the scripture tells us
[7:10] it's there and by faith we believe that
[7:12] but it's the proof of those things
[7:14] things that gives us the foundation that
[7:17] we need for our daily lives and it says
[7:20] it's the conviction of their reality so
[7:23] the things we don't see the things that
[7:25] in another dimension it's it convinces
[7:28] us of their reality and Faith perceiving
[7:32] as real fact what is not revealed to our
[7:35] five senses
[7:38] amazing it's so powerful and and it does
[7:43] bear a little bit of study and reading
[7:46] it and leading the Lord just drop this
[7:49] into your heart
[7:50] for by faith and now we're reading that
[7:52] verse again trust and holy further
[7:55] born of faith
[7:57] the men of old had Divine test and he
[7:59] born to them and obtained a good report
[8:01] so right away Paul goes back to past
[8:04] experience he says now the reason we
[8:06] know this thing about faith is look back
[8:09] at those other guys and he spends a
[8:10] whole chapter on that and then he
[8:13] finishes that chapter with but they
[8:15] without us to not be made perfect
[8:18] and so that is our Our Heritage brother
[8:22] and sister that is where we stand today
[8:25] is built on the foundation of the
[8:28] Apostles and the prophets that came
[8:30] before us that's our foundation we're
[8:32] not making this up this isn't imaginary
[8:36] this isn't wishful thinking this isn't
[8:39] mysticism this isn't myths and legends
[8:42] all right this is the word of God and we
[8:46] have the reality of a whole chapter of
[8:49] God's Hall of Fame if you like his whole
[8:52] of faith of people that we can look back
[8:55] and say if he did it for him he can do
[8:59] it for me the same and we praise God for
[9:02] that and it's so it's such an incredible
[9:05] chapter but I love the way it ends and
[9:09] right they obtained a good report and so
[9:13] we want to brother and sister have that
[9:15] good report and now I'm not I don't have
[9:19] this on my slides but I'll just read it
[9:22] um end of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 39
[9:24] and these all having obtained a good
[9:27] report so he goes back to that concept
[9:31] through faith
[9:33] received not the promise
[9:37] they hoped for a better future they had
[9:40] a vision of what God had said was going
[9:44] to happen
[9:46] but it didn't happen for them
[9:48] it wasn't yet time it wasn't fulfilled
[9:51] so we also have to have that kind of
[9:54] faith that when we're waiting for
[9:56] something like a house to sell
[10:00] that we can have faith
[10:03] right that God is still on the throne
[10:06] that he still knows the end from the
[10:09] beginning he still has a a plan and a
[10:12] purpose in everything that he does
[10:15] because even if we don't receive the
[10:17] promise today we know that one day we
[10:20] will receive that promise and so that's
[10:22] exactly what he says in verse 40.
[10:25] God having provided some better thing
[10:28] for us that they without us should not
[10:31] be made perfect wherefore now chapter
[10:33] breaks can be sometimes confusing in
[10:36] scripture because if you're following
[10:37] are wrong you'll notice that the
[10:39] wherefore comes in chapter 12 but I want
[10:42] you to ignore that chapter break for now
[10:44] and realize that wherefore is a
[10:46] connecting word it's a conjunction and
[10:48] it's bringing together the previous
[10:49] thought so not really make sense to
[10:53] perhaps start another chapter right here
[10:55] but
[10:56] if we understand that we can just keep
[10:58] reading
[10:59] that they without us should not be made
[11:02] perfect wherefore seeing we also are
[11:06] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[11:09] witnesses
[11:11] to Faith
[11:12] witnesses to Faith people who aren't
[11:15] guessing about faith people who aren't
[11:17] wondering about faith people who've
[11:20] already obtained a good report they're
[11:22] testifying of the goodness and greatness
[11:25] of God even though
[11:27] they hadn't yet received the promise and
[11:30] that's our testimony as well we should
[11:32] be testifying even though we may be
[11:35] seeing a delay
[11:37] a little bit so wherefore seeing we also
[11:40] are compassed about with so great a
[11:42] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside and
[11:46] run the pace the race with patients so I
[11:48] just want to emphasize the clouds for a
[11:49] minute Jesus ascended into heaven he was
[11:52] caught up in the clouds and we know that
[11:54] at that time there were Believers from
[11:58] the previous uh ages that had come up
[12:02] when Jesus resurrected and was seen
[12:03] about the streets of Jerusalem and then
[12:06] they ascended with Jesus on the on on
[12:10] what we call the Ascension Day and that
[12:14] that is what made the clouds the clouds
[12:17] of witnesses with these old men of faith
[12:19] and Women of Faith and they had now been
[12:21] caught up Jesus was now in their midst
[12:24] as as proof of their faithfulness of
[12:28] their good report that that what they
[12:30] had done was pleasing to him he was now
[12:32] in their midst as a beautiful picture of
[12:35] what it will be like for us one day so
[12:37] we have faith and we have hope and this
[12:40] passage gives us both shows us the faith
[12:43] that the people had and the hope that
[12:45] they without us should not be made
[12:47] perfect so if these people are going to
[12:49] get it I'm gonna get it
[12:51] there's no question about that because
[12:54] otherwise God's going to shortchange
[12:56] these guys
[12:57] he's going to have given them such a
[12:59] such a glowing reference here if you
[13:02] think of this as a as a reference their
[13:04] testimony right that they've got a great
[13:07] reference from God about how wonderfully
[13:10] they had done and then he's going to let
[13:12] them all down because we're not going to
[13:14] have that resurrection that we're
[13:16] looking forward to impossible so we know
[13:19] that this is a faith that we can hold on
[13:24] to now
[13:25] having said that we're going to
[13:27] emphasize this point
[13:30] in the natural we fight
[13:33] in the natural we resist the enemy in
[13:37] the natural we have to dedicate
[13:40] ourselves to God to to remember our said
[13:43] about washing the clothes which by the
[13:45] way I got in trouble because I left the
[13:47] stain on one of the shirts wow so it had
[13:49] to be put back in the Washington I'm not
[13:51] an expert yet so but I mentioned the
[13:54] fact that in order to wash clothes you
[13:57] have to dip them in a liquid you can't
[13:59] just rub them so it works on its own
[14:01] can't get you anywhere but if by faith
[14:04] in the word of God and under the blood
[14:07] of Jesus we can put our lives into that
[14:10] liquid and now anything we do is going
[14:13] to help so I also want to stress in the
[14:15] natural we work in the natural we're
[14:18] doing things but it's not a natural
[14:21] battle what wasn't against flesh and
[14:24] blood it's not a natural it's a
[14:26] spiritual battle which means that we're
[14:29] fighting in another dimension that's why
[14:31] it's important for us to understand
[14:33] faith comes from that other dimension
[14:35] because it's in that Dimension that
[14:37] we're going to do better and so when
[14:39] brother Adam says I must fight if I
[14:42] should Reign he's saying fight a
[14:44] spiritual battle the the greatest
[14:46] Battleground is in the mind and increase
[14:49] my courage look he says this is not a
[14:52] picnic ground this is a Battlefield and
[14:55] I've often said this when I realized how
[14:57] the Lord Works in our lives and he
[14:59] sometimes raises the steepness of the
[15:02] mountain like I talked about last time
[15:04] and makes us have to put in a little bit
[15:06] more effort I realized that when we sing
[15:09] the song
[15:10] I don't know if if we sing it here or
[15:13] not and if we do forgive me but it's
[15:15] every day with Jesus is sweeter than the
[15:18] day before
[15:20] I think some of us might um have a
[15:24] little bit of a difficulty at times
[15:26] singing that with conviction all right
[15:28] because in one way it is obviously in
[15:32] the spiritual realm in the great big
[15:34] scheme of things but sometimes when
[15:36] we're going a long life's journey it's
[15:39] not so much the the bed of roses that
[15:43] that song would imply and certainly
[15:45] brother Renner mentions that this is not
[15:47] a picnic ground it's a battlefield and
[15:49] so we're still on Battle speed we
[15:51] haven't yet hit ramming speed but we're
[15:54] going to get there if we're going to
[15:55] finish on time today so
[15:57] he also says this and God brought his
[16:00] people to Jordan
[16:01] when it was raging the highest now this
[16:05] isn't the passage that I'm going to be
[16:07] talking about today this wasn't category
[16:08] this was when they actually had to cross
[16:10] over so as if God hadn't put enough
[16:13] obstacles in their way with Giants and
[16:15] and the hittats and the amorites and the
[16:18] jebusites and the mosquito bites and
[16:19] everybody that was surrounding them at
[16:22] that time that was making them fear to
[16:25] go across the Jordan at karishbarnia all
[16:28] right now that they actually can get
[16:30] across now he says okay let's try this
[16:33] at full flood
[16:34] and let's see how your faith is now
[16:37] but of course all the faithless ones
[16:39] were gone so uh God certainly knows how
[16:44] to test his people and so we read that
[16:46] in Joshua 3 verse 15 and as they that
[16:49] bore the ark were coming to Jordan and
[16:52] the feet of the priests at all the
[16:54] awkward dipped in the brim of the water
[16:55] for Jordan overflowed all his Banks all
[17:00] the time of the Harvest
[17:02] oh gee thanks
[17:04] it could have just been a little little
[17:06] trickle right I mean we could have made
[17:08] it easy but no that's not God's plan and
[17:12] Brethren says oh I wished I had some way
[17:15] I could place that into the heart of the
[17:18] people
[17:19] maybe you've been brought up against the
[17:21] difficulty right in your Christian
[17:23] experience that you question God why
[17:28] and this is not a place where we lay
[17:30] back and say now Lord you just come and
[17:33] force it right in me and then I'll do it
[17:35] oh no he says God never did it that way
[17:38] so in Joshua chapter 1 verse 3 we read
[17:42] this great promise every place that the
[17:45] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[17:48] have I given unto you as I said unto
[17:51] Moses so now the banner the the has been
[17:55] the Baton has been passed from Moses to
[17:59] Joshua and God actually says to Joshua
[18:01] I'm going to establish you in the eyes
[18:03] of the people I'm going to make the sign
[18:05] that they're going to believe that as I
[18:07] was with Moses so I'll be with you and
[18:09] then he gives Joshua the same promise
[18:13] that he gives that he gave to Moses
[18:15] and the the difference is that what
[18:19] Joshua learned what the people learned
[18:21] in this is that in the natural footsteps
[18:25] of possession
[18:27] in the natural we have to take the step
[18:30] of faith we have to believe that there's
[18:33] a Supernatural That's guiding the
[18:35] natural but in the natural we have to
[18:38] respond and I'll spend most of the
[18:39] service today uh talking around that
[18:43] concept of our responsibility in this
[18:46] process so he goes on to say that land
[18:49] is yours every bit of it that was the
[18:52] promise to Joshua and I love that every
[18:54] bit of it and by the way if you're
[18:56] thinking what is the promised land for
[18:57] us today it's this you remember the
[19:00] promised land was bordered by water on
[19:02] all sides it was the Jordan the
[19:05] Euphrates the river of Egypt and the
[19:07] Mediterranean if you like the great sea
[19:10] and so the promised land was bordered by
[19:12] water and we have the water of the word
[19:16] of God that borders our faith that's the
[19:20] framework in which Faith exists all
[19:23] right and it's bordered by the Water by
[19:25] the word of God every every bit of it
[19:28] now the people today are expecting God
[19:30] to reach down and get them by the next
[19:32] say yes that's right you bring me out to
[19:34] clean me off heal me I'll believe you
[19:36] God doesn't do this business that way he
[19:40] gives you the promise
[19:42] but you have to fight for every inch of
[19:44] ground that you possess he gives you the
[19:47] promise to establish Faith From Another
[19:50] Dimension from the dimension of his word
[19:53] and remember from the dimension of his
[19:55] character remember we talked about you
[19:57] can believe him because we know him and
[20:00] we believe in the character of God we're
[20:03] not just reading words on a page it's a
[20:06] there's a person a trustworthy faithful
[20:10] person behind this word and that's the
[20:14] one that we're believing in we're
[20:15] believing in him and so he says but you
[20:20] have to fight for it so it's not it I
[20:24] mean it's it's it's relatively simple
[20:25] right we're not in that other dimension
[20:28] we're in this Dimension a warning
[20:31] sin-shaped iniquity we are we are
[20:33] sinners uh saved by grace so there's a
[20:37] battle that goes on Paul says between
[20:39] the spirit and the flesh there's there's
[20:41] this other dimension that is trying to
[20:43] get a hold of us and and we're in touch
[20:46] with gravity we're in touch with that
[20:48] other thing that's holding us back and
[20:50] so guess what we have to fight against
[20:52] that and Paul says I died daily
[20:55] because of that because there is a
[20:58] natural battle so we keep going now
[21:01] here's what it is it's easy to feel the
[21:03] power of God on the mountaintops
[21:06] that's what we talked about last time
[21:08] but the problem with the Mountaintop is
[21:11] your fruit will freeze up there
[21:13] are at fruit grows in the valley
[21:15] and by the way just uh while I'm
[21:18] thinking about it I did have a picture
[21:19] but it's not very clear they just
[21:22] recently discovered the tallest tree in
[21:24] Asia
[21:25] uh uh forget all the details but they
[21:28] they have a photograph it's growing in a
[21:30] Gorge it's growing in a valley and the
[21:32] valley is so deep
[21:34] that for this tree to have survived it's
[21:37] had to grow hundreds and hundreds and
[21:40] hundreds of feet for 800 years it's been
[21:43] growing seeking the light out of this
[21:46] dark Valley and so the tallest tree in
[21:49] Asia is growing in a valley
[21:51] and so remember we talked about us being
[21:54] like trees right the planted by rivers
[21:56] of Living Water so in order for us to
[21:59] grow big and strong and tall in faith in
[22:02] Texas Valley
[22:03] and so we we we don't appreciate the
[22:07] belly so much at the time but we
[22:10] understand that we're going to grow
[22:12] through that experience all right so
[22:14] then he says
[22:16] it's easy to feel the power of God to
[22:19] see it when you believe but then when it
[22:21] comes to The Showdown are you able to
[22:24] possess the thing that you profess to
[22:28] have
[22:29] that's the physical side that's reaching
[22:32] into
[22:34] the other dimension reaching into
[22:36] eternity and grasping what we say we
[22:40] have do you remember Luther if you've
[22:42] ever seen the old Luther film make sure
[22:44] it's the old one
[22:46] um that uh he said to his friend he said
[22:49] the problem is I've got it here and I
[22:53] can give it out here he was a theologian
[22:56] he said but here
[22:58] something's still missing all right and
[23:01] so we've got to go from understanding it
[23:04] in the mind that's where members soul
[23:06] body Soul spirit that the study have
[23:09] done many times but it starts in the
[23:11] spirit
[23:12] and then it goes to the soul and then it
[23:15] goes to the body that's how it works so
[23:18] the spirit is where we get convicted the
[23:20] spirit is where the word of God speaks
[23:22] to us that's what that other dimension
[23:24] that's the spiritual side of us that can
[23:26] be in touch with that other damage and
[23:28] not our natural senses but our spiritual
[23:30] senses so when we have those spiritual
[23:33] senses tuned then our mind can receive
[23:36] what God wants us to have and then from
[23:39] there it drops into our soul and from
[23:42] there it starts to manifest itself in
[23:45] our lives that's the way it works so the
[23:48] thing that you're a he says are you able
[23:50] to possess the thing that you profess to
[23:53] her in other words Hazard dropped from
[23:56] knowing it as I think toza said faith is
[24:00] more than just a mental Ascent to truth
[24:03] it's not just agreeing with the word of
[24:05] God it's more than that so are you able
[24:08] to possess the thing that you profess to
[24:12] have
[24:14] that's something that we can really stop
[24:17] and dwell on and ask the Lord to help us
[24:20] because only he can give us that
[24:23] so when fear strikes we'll spend some
[24:25] time talking about fear
[24:27] right in the path of Duty so we
[24:31] sometimes feel no no that's not fair I
[24:33] was doing your work Lord and and this
[24:36] happened and that happened listen
[24:37] brother let me say this if you're
[24:40] walking in the light having fellowship
[24:41] with god with his people when the Holy
[24:43] Spirit is upon you and you meet an
[24:45] obstacle right in the path of Duty don't
[24:48] stop
[24:49] just keep printing on God Will Make A
[24:53] Way through it and he's using that whole
[24:57] Hebrews chapter 11 to back up this
[25:00] statement
[25:03] it was not worthy all right even though
[25:06] they had all these difficulties they're
[25:08] in God's Hall of faith God is giving
[25:11] them a good testimonial a good report
[25:13] and he says God Will Make A Way Through
[25:16] It
[25:17] so in Deuteronomy 6 23 as we come back
[25:20] to our uh our story about Joshua and the
[25:24] 12 Spies at kadeshbania in Deuteronomy
[25:29] chapter 6 verse 23
[25:31] they're recapping this and he says he
[25:33] brought us out from there from Egypt
[25:36] that he might bring us in to give us the
[25:39] land which he swore and and to our
[25:42] fathers so he's just saying this isn't
[25:45] uh the end here we're in Deuteronomy
[25:47] things are looking pretty bad here we're
[25:49] going around and around this mountain by
[25:51] the way if you're struggling with faith
[25:53] right now you might find yourself going
[25:55] around the mountain a few times because
[25:57] it's a little bit like brother rap would
[25:59] uh would uh would tell me that if they
[26:02] don't pass the test they have to take
[26:04] the test again
[26:06] all right and they didn't pass the test
[26:08] so God put them another lap around the
[26:10] mountain and it was 40 years that they
[26:12] went they were slow Learners and so they
[26:15] went around the mountain for 40 years
[26:17] before God got rid of that generation
[26:19] and was able to take a new believing
[26:22] generation into the promised land and so
[26:25] this is what Moses is reminding them of
[26:27] he brought us out but it wasn't just to
[26:30] bring us out it was to bring us in
[26:33] so it brings us out of the world but he
[26:36] brings us into his word
[26:40] Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 30 and I love
[26:43] this and Caleb Still the people they
[26:46] were all like oh these are big people oh
[26:48] it's terrible and Caleb's like whoa nope
[26:50] wait just a minute
[26:53] may I say something
[26:55] and he's still the people before Moses
[26:58] and said let us go up at once and
[27:02] possess it and I want to stress that at
[27:04] once now we may not see the Fulfillment
[27:07] at once but we have to have the response
[27:11] at once I remember I said delayed
[27:13] obedience is Disobedience so we do not
[27:16] want to delay our response God can delay
[27:19] that's his prerogative he knows what
[27:21] he's doing he knows the end from the
[27:22] beginning but our response can't be
[27:24] delayed we have to go up at once and
[27:28] possess it for we are well able to
[27:31] overcome it and I want you to notice the
[27:33] anointing that was on these people
[27:35] that came up against what Caleb just
[27:37] said this is the very next verse but the
[27:40] men that went up with him said we be not
[27:42] able to go
[27:45] the same phrase just they're a little
[27:47] little word and where do we remember
[27:49] that from
[27:51] Garden of Eden Thou shalt not surely die
[27:54] so this little word not is a very uh
[27:59] strong indicator of who's actually
[28:03] speaking here
[28:04] and this isn't those 10 spies that's
[28:07] their voice but the the the the spirit
[28:09] behind that is the same spirit that
[28:12] tried to successfully get Eve to
[28:16] disbelieve the work
[28:17] that's the same spirit that was on these
[28:20] ten spies because they said we'd be not
[28:23] able so Caleb started a church and his
[28:27] church was called we be able
[28:29] and then then another church came up and
[28:32] they had a different denomination and
[28:34] they would be be not able and so that's
[28:37] what we've got to be conscious of is
[28:40] which side are we voting for are we on
[28:43] the voting for The be able side or the
[28:45] not able side and that's exactly the
[28:48] choice that God places before us in
[28:51] these valleys of decision that's the
[28:53] purpose of the valley you go into a
[28:56] valley you're either going to go forward
[28:57] you're going to go backwards you can't
[28:59] really go up the side of the mountain
[29:00] and so if you remember The Charge of the
[29:03] Light Brigade into the valley of death
[29:05] wrote the 600 all right and it's because
[29:07] they were forced to go forward there was
[29:11] no there was nothing else they could do
[29:12] because they were in the valley of
[29:14] decision and once you commit to that
[29:16] path you've got to go through it and
[29:19] that's exactly what we have to do we do
[29:21] not want to be listening uh to the uh
[29:24] those that don't have faith so it takes
[29:28] courage this is an interesting word
[29:30] because we think of faith and we think
[29:33] of our spiritual walk as being all God
[29:37] of course the foundation the the
[29:40] experience the work everything is of God
[29:43] everything is by the hand of God but we
[29:47] have a role to play in that because in
[29:49] the natural we've got to take possession
[29:52] of what we're being given in the
[29:54] Supernatural realm in the spiritual
[29:55] realm and it takes courage to let go of
[29:59] the natural things the things we can
[30:01] feel
[30:03] taste here smell and
[30:06] touch anyway those five natural senses
[30:10] that's what we have to let go of in
[30:14] order for those five spiritual senses to
[30:17] be able to be in touch with what God is
[30:20] telling us and then we've got to come
[30:22] back and apply that in our lives but
[30:24] we've got to let go of what's familiar
[30:27] and comfortable
[30:29] and we read this when they actually
[30:31] start to go through now into Canaan in
[30:34] Joshua chapter 3 verse 4 that you may
[30:36] know the way
[30:39] you may know the way Joshua's name
[30:41] actually is Jesus in the Hebrew it's
[30:44] Joshua Savior and you may know the way
[30:47] by which you must go for you have not
[30:50] passed this way heretofore before in
[30:53] other words this is a new experience for
[30:56] you and it's going to be a trial it's
[30:59] going to be a challenge there are going
[31:01] to be missteps remember Aiken's wedge
[31:04] there's going to be all kinds of things
[31:05] they're going to March around this huge
[31:07] City for seven days they're going to do
[31:09] things they've never done before and I
[31:11] want to say that's a characteristic of a
[31:13] valley experience
[31:15] that you're going to be encouraged to do
[31:18] things that you've never done before to
[31:21] let go of the things that are familiar
[31:24] and comfortable and go into a place that
[31:27] you've not been before and that's what
[31:30] faith is Faith takes you to a higher and
[31:33] a higher and a higher level and it never
[31:35] stops until this body has changed so
[31:38] there's no point in trying to avoid that
[31:40] we we are going to go through challenges
[31:42] but it's our response to the challenges
[31:45] that makes the difference
[31:47] so if you're taking off like the
[31:49] pilgrims did and you want to discover a
[31:52] new land you've got to go where you've
[31:55] never been to get what you've never had
[31:59] that's what
[32:01] going where we've never been to get what
[32:03] we've never had God wouldn't be wasting
[32:06] our time if I can put it that way trying
[32:09] to get us to achieve things that we
[32:11] achieved five years ago so when we look
[32:14] back at our experience with faith with
[32:16] God and we go oh you know I I've I've
[32:19] got it I had Faith um let me see it was
[32:23] 1972 I think and no that doesn't work
[32:26] that well right it's going to be from
[32:29] glory to glory it's going to be adding
[32:32] like we said last time from Faith to
[32:34] Faith we're going to have to exercise
[32:36] that muscle it's going to be a growth
[32:38] process this isn't a comfort zone
[32:41] process this isn't going up at one stage
[32:44] and then stopping and I want you to
[32:46] Picture This Jacob's Ladder you always
[32:48] and we're gonna have to speed up right
[32:49] here so Jacob's letter Jacob saw the the
[32:52] path to Heaven if you like as a ladder
[32:55] but I want you to know that some ladders
[32:57] I don't know if you've seen this but
[32:59] some letters like a rope ladder actually
[33:01] has the rung sticking out past the edge
[33:04] of the of the Rope right you you have
[33:06] the rungs going up but it's not like
[33:08] your normal step ladder stops at the
[33:10] sides the rope ladder the rungs go a
[33:13] little bit further out and the picture
[33:15] that I got was seeing this path to
[33:19] Heaven as as Jacob's Ladder was that
[33:22] Satan doesn't mind how high you climb up
[33:26] that ladder
[33:27] all he wants to make sure of is that at
[33:30] some point you could
[33:32] not that you go back down not that you
[33:35] go oh no I don't believe any of this you
[33:37] just take a step sideways the smallest
[33:40] little step sideways and you park
[33:42] yourself on the side of this ladder and
[33:46] others are going up but you're stuck on
[33:48] the side
[33:49] because you've sit that far and no
[33:52] further
[33:53] and that's a trap of the enemy you feel
[33:56] like you're still in the same position
[33:57] but in actual fact you're not because
[34:01] now you should have gone another couple
[34:03] of rungs up the ladder but you're parked
[34:06] on the side and I can tell you that
[34:08] Caleb
[34:09] demonstrated that this idea of no we are
[34:13] able we can go further we can go into
[34:15] areas that we haven't been before and he
[34:18] said this
[34:19] um I'm just paraphrasing he says God's
[34:23] called us to be climbers not campers all
[34:27] right we're not supposed to just have be
[34:29] in our tents here and be content to sit
[34:32] and wait this out on the banks of the
[34:34] Jordan we have to be climbers we have to
[34:36] go the other step and to get where
[34:39] you've never been you have to uh to get
[34:44] what you've never the way you've never
[34:46] been you have to get what you've never
[34:48] had so the only way to discover new
[34:50] oceans and lands is to lose sight of
[34:53] your own Shoreline
[34:55] so I've been uh on the ocean I grew up
[34:58] in Durban and so I've been on the ocean
[35:00] you can see the shoreline in the
[35:02] distance it's very comforting when you
[35:04] get a little bit over the horizon and
[35:07] it's blue ocean all the way around you
[35:09] that's a little bit disconcerting that
[35:12] is definitely disconcerting depending on
[35:14] how big the boat is it wasn't a very big
[35:16] boat
[35:17] and so I was a little bit concerned and
[35:20] it was quite a swell and so yes that was
[35:24] uh that you know I enjoyed the
[35:27] experience afterwards and it was fun to
[35:31] talk about but at the time I was about
[35:34] 10 11 hours a bit nervous but you see if
[35:38] you're gonna discover some strength that
[35:41] you didn't have before you're going to
[35:43] have to lose sight of your own Shoreline
[35:46] you're going to have to lose sight of
[35:48] the familiar and the comfortable you're
[35:50] going to have to lose sight of the
[35:52] safety net that you think is necessary
[35:55] in your life and you have to be able to
[35:57] put all your trust and faith in God
[35:59] because these people said we be not able
[36:03] to go up for they are stronger and so
[36:06] they overestimated
[36:08] the enemies
[36:10] strength position
[36:13] and it destroys faith
[36:16] it erodes confidence
[36:18] and it warps our perspective so when we
[36:21] look at a situation from the perspective
[36:24] of our enemy when they saw when we were
[36:29] like grasshoppers in our sight is
[36:32] because their perspective had been
[36:34] warped by what they saw rather than by
[36:38] what God had said and we have to be so
[36:42] careful of what we see versus what we
[36:45] believe what did God say not
[36:50] how does it look to me
[36:52] that's irrelevant it's how does it look
[36:54] to God and if we can believe that then
[36:57] we can have faith now I was talking
[36:59] about myths and legends maybe this is
[37:01] another one
[37:02] so I don't know if you're familiar with
[37:04] this story I love the story it's uh
[37:07] Legends of the Texas Rangers
[37:10] all right and it was a riot in this town
[37:15] and so they sent off an urgent telegram
[37:17] to the Texas Rangers town in Riot many
[37:22] dead
[37:22] sent help I said telegram Telegraph
[37:26] and so they get a reply back from the
[37:28] Rangers and they said help
[37:30] is on tomorrow's train
[37:34] so they were relieved and so the next
[37:37] day all the townspeople gather at the
[37:39] station and they're all waiting for the
[37:42] Ranger
[37:43] to show up and they've got their
[37:46] reception committee and you know people
[37:49] are dying things are just chaotic and
[37:51] the town prices are burning down and so
[37:54] they have confidence that when the
[37:56] Rangers arrive they'll come and clear up
[37:58] the mess and suddenly they'll be uh
[38:01] they'll be saved
[38:03] unfortunately when they were
[38:06] waiting at this station they see one
[38:09] lonely Ranger
[38:12] get off the train
[38:13] and then up where's the rest
[38:17] where's the backup where's where's the
[38:19] Army you know we've got a riot going on
[38:22] yes hundreds of people dying and
[38:24] whatever
[38:24] and the ranger just straightens his back
[38:27] and looks at them with those Steely eyes
[38:30] you know and he says
[38:33] one right one range
[38:40] and we have our Ranger don't we it
[38:44] doesn't matter what the fire is doesn't
[38:47] matter what Riot is going on in your
[38:49] heart it doesn't matter what the
[38:51] circumstances are all we need is one
[38:55] Ranger
[38:56] and that's our Lord Jesus Christ that's
[38:59] all we need and he doesn't need an army
[39:02] he is the army so Israel perceived the
[39:08] Giants to be greater than his promises
[39:11] in first John 4 4 you're of God little
[39:13] children and have overcome them because
[39:15] greater is he that is in you than he
[39:17] that is in the world and if you see
[39:19] Memes uh on the internet you'll have
[39:22] seen something about uh the the Giants
[39:24] before you or nothing compared to the
[39:27] God within you and it's based on this
[39:29] verse and it's absolutely true it wasn't
[39:31] so commonly used I would have I would
[39:33] have brought it up but it seems like
[39:34] everybody's using that these days but
[39:36] it's the Giants before you are nothing
[39:40] compared to the god that is within you
[39:43] so remember faith is the substance of
[39:45] things hoped for but Israel wasn't
[39:48] focusing on the substance they weren't
[39:51] focusing on what God had told Moses what
[39:53] God had told Joshua they weren't
[39:55] focusing on the past experiences of all
[39:57] the times that God had delivered them
[39:59] and their shoes didn't wear it they were
[40:00] fed every day they found water in the
[40:03] middle of a desert all of those things
[40:04] were somehow brushed away
[40:10] by the evidence of their eyes
[40:13] the land was well fortified
[40:16] the children of anarch were giants the
[40:19] size and strength of the enemy made them
[40:21] forget who they were
[40:24] and the ten spiers said seeing is
[40:26] believing and I've heard that before
[40:29] seeing with the eyes of faith is
[40:32] believing that's what we should be
[40:35] seeing we should be seeing the promise
[40:37] we should be seeing the word of God we
[40:38] should be seeing by revelation
[40:41] but not with our natural thinking with
[40:44] our natural eyes the eyes of Doubt only
[40:47] see problems the eyes of Faith only see
[40:50] promises
[40:53] so the substance of faith is based on
[40:56] what they had experienced before that's
[40:59] what they should have been holding on to
[41:01] Lord you've done all these things first
[41:03] we're going to read your hosapets
[41:06] jehoshaphat's uh uh prayer here soon uh
[41:10] and um and and I want you to see how he
[41:13] plays on this the past experiences and
[41:16] how he he gets God's attention with his
[41:19] prayers it's wonderful so they had
[41:21] experienced something before but it was
[41:25] blotted out when the Israelites heard
[41:27] the bad report of the faith of the spies
[41:29] so now we're remembering this scripture
[41:31] it's a substance of things hoped for the
[41:34] evidence of Things Not Seen so even
[41:37] though they had experienced all this it
[41:39] wasn't enough
[41:41] you see they needed a revelation of what
[41:45] was happening of what God was doing in
[41:47] their lives and so they needed not to be
[41:51] basing their faith just on those
[41:54] experiences those experiences help but
[41:56] there's got to be something a little
[41:58] more than that a little deeper than that
[42:00] and that's the revelation of God's will
[42:03] in your heart and they knew God's will
[42:05] God's will was have brought you out and
[42:07] I'm going to take you in
[42:09] and they lost sight of that
[42:12] they had no Revelation that God the same
[42:16] God that brought them out was going to
[42:18] bring them in that he was as the New
[42:20] Testament says the author and finisher
[42:22] of our faith so these 10
[42:26] faithless spies
[42:28] the Bible says they brought up an evil
[42:31] report of the land
[42:33] now that's interesting because it wasn't
[42:36] evil because it wasn't true
[42:41] it was an evil report because they
[42:43] overestimated the power of the enemy in
[42:46] the face of the promise of God
[42:50] so when God gives a promise
[42:53] that's it it doesn't matter what the
[42:56] report is from the doctors or from your
[42:59] parents or your teachers or whoever it
[43:02] might be that's not what counts
[43:06] That's overestimating The Power of being
[43:09] and we do not want to underestimate God
[43:13] relative to the problems that we're
[43:15] facing Israel got so close right at the
[43:19] water's edge to God's purpose and they
[43:23] were on the brink of fulfilling that
[43:24] promise literally and figuratively right
[43:26] at the brink right at the Jordan
[43:29] and they turned back in fear
[43:32] and here's the consequence of that
[43:33] because they believed the evil report
[43:36] they became bitter
[43:38] hard-hearted
[43:40] unbelieving
[43:42] and there was only one way God could
[43:44] deal with that
[43:45] and that was to wear them out in the
[43:48] desert until their faith or lack thereof
[43:52] became evident and they died whether it
[43:55] was disease or whatever we'll get to
[43:57] that and so we remember the scripture
[43:59] sing the song I Love It Isaiah 53 verse
[44:02] 1 who has believed our report and to
[44:06] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and
[44:08] that's a rhetorical question who has
[44:11] believed it
[44:13] right he's not curious
[44:16] he just wants to know if you believe it
[44:19] do you believe
[44:21] his report
[44:23] and that's the one that we want to hold
[44:25] on to don't believe what people say
[44:28] teachers parents doctors
[44:30] doesn't matter
[44:33] real estate agents
[44:35] we have to believe what God's word says
[44:41] now when I talk about training for
[44:43] reigning this is that tree that grew in
[44:46] the in this deep gorge and how it
[44:49] struggled to find the light and just
[44:51] went up higher and higher over hundreds
[44:53] of years it's because that's where God
[44:56] trains us for reigning we know that
[44:58] we're going to rule and reign with him
[45:00] in the Millennium that's the promise
[45:02] that we have and so we have to be
[45:05] trained for that we're not going to
[45:06] learn these lessons in the Millennium
[45:09] when we're in our in our Supernatural
[45:12] body and our Supernatural form we have
[45:15] to learn those lessons here we have to
[45:16] be trained here and so these were some
[45:20] of the values that if I had time I would
[45:22] have gone into of course we're talking
[45:24] about ashkol now but we'd also go to
[45:27] ajalan and in the wilderness of Edom but
[45:30] eventually we're going to talk a little
[45:32] bit today about
[45:33] and that was the most wonderful
[45:36] experience that I I I just can't get
[45:39] enough of that story and we'll talk
[45:42] about that yet for a few minutes and if
[45:44] I had time I would just read the whole
[45:46] chapter because it's so inspiring please
[45:48] read the chapter that's why I put up all
[45:50] the verses 1 to 27 I'm just not going to
[45:53] have time to do it today
[45:55] then some came and told Jehoshaphat
[45:58] saying a great multitude is coming
[46:01] against you from Beyond the Sea
[46:04] from Syria and they are in
[46:21] all right and so that's the valley that
[46:25] they were in
[46:27] all right
[46:29] and so now that there's a problem a
[46:32] great multitude is coming against them
[46:36] and here's uh part of
[46:39] jehoshaphat's Prayer
[46:43] he said oh Lord God of our fathers
[46:47] and I can guarantee you this was not a
[46:51] whispered prayer
[46:52] this is heartfelt desperate prayer they
[46:57] are faced with their absolutely
[46:59] insurmountable group of armies that are
[47:03] coming for them
[47:04] and Jehoshaphat is praying and here is
[47:09] the nature of his prayer
[47:11] he's I'm sorry he said O Lord God of our
[47:14] fathers
[47:16] art not thou God in heaven
[47:22] aren't you the man
[47:24] aren't you the one we've put all our
[47:27] faith and trust in all these years
[47:29] aren't you him
[47:32] aren't you the guy that we can counter
[47:35] in times of trouble aren't you that one
[47:38] the God in heaven and don't you rule
[47:41] over all the kingdoms of the heathen
[47:44] and in your hand is there not power and
[47:48] might
[47:49] so that none is able to withstand you
[47:52] what a prayer
[47:54] he's not pleading
[47:56] he's possessing
[47:58] he's taking ownership of what he
[48:02] believes God is and who God is and how
[48:08] God can respond in the situation he is
[48:11] showing his confidence in the word of
[48:13] God but it doesn't end there he keeps
[48:16] going aren't not thou Our God who did
[48:19] drive out the inhabitants of this land
[48:21] before the thy People Israel
[48:24] aren't you the same yesterday today and
[48:27] forever
[48:28] unto the Lord that changes not
[48:32] and I
[48:33] I just love the negative way that he's
[48:36] doing it it's like it's like it's like
[48:38] rhetoric it's like he's got a certain
[48:40] Cadence to his speech and and I don't
[48:44] know who his speechwriter was but he was
[48:46] pretty good because this reads in such
[48:50] an exciting way aren't you the god
[48:53] aren't you the one that rules don't you
[48:56] have all power
[48:57] [Music]
[49:01] right and he did
[49:03] and so we've jumped the story and so on
[49:06] the fourth day they assembled themselves
[49:08] in the valley
[49:10] for there they blessed the Lord I'll
[49:13] tell you what happened God's
[49:17] tunic buttons were popping after that
[49:21] prayer
[49:21] he goes whoa
[49:23] this guy really trusts me and he has
[49:28] confidence in my character who I am that
[49:33] guy I am the man
[49:36] oh now he says aha under these
[49:40] conditions I want you guys to all set up
[49:43] the bleachers
[49:44] and I want you just to take a seat at
[49:47] the Battleground
[49:49] because the battle is mine tomorrow
[49:51] it's not yours and it's not the Kings
[49:55] the Battle Is Mine
[49:57] and I want you to sit back and see the
[50:00] salvation of God
[50:03] and he says the same thing to us today
[50:05] and we can pray the same prayer and we
[50:09] can have the same rejoicing on the
[50:11] fourth day
[50:12] after everything is done and they've
[50:15] seen God and their whole praise team was
[50:17] called out and they went marching into
[50:20] battle singing uh the Praises of God the
[50:24] beauty the beauty of holiness
[50:26] and singing great other other ways Lord
[50:30] God Almighty from revelation
[50:32] can imagine that great praise team one
[50:35] day in Revelation chapter that
[50:39] four or five now five I think and he
[50:42] says
[50:43] Great and Mighty are thou Works Lord God
[50:45] Almighty for thou has created has all
[50:48] things created and for that pleasure
[50:50] they were created and that's the song
[50:52] that we're going to be singing and
[50:54] that's the song they sang into battle
[50:57] against these folk when God was fighting
[51:00] the battle for us we have that same God
[51:03] fighting the battle for us today and
[51:05] what does mean it means a blessing a
[51:09] benediction invocation of good it's what
[51:12] they began to understand about God after
[51:17] that experience they probably didn't
[51:19] know that beforehand but afterwards they
[51:23] knew where there had been this was a
[51:26] valley of blessing this was a valley of
[51:28] benediction this was a a good value
[51:31] but that only happens afterwards so
[51:35] we're going to look at these principles
[51:36] I think we're going to hit battle speed
[51:37] I know we're ramming speed number one
[51:42] it's brought you through valleys before
[51:44] right and that's what um that's what
[51:46] jehoshaphat's prayer was and once you're
[51:48] through this Valley God will have become
[51:50] more real and your relationship will
[51:52] have increased in depth and you'll be
[51:54] even more secure in his love so that's
[51:56] why we have value experiences and he
[51:59] says aren't you our God who did this
[52:03] this and this and this all right and
[52:05] then he said and gave it to the Seed of
[52:07] Abraham thy friend forever and so we are
[52:11] Abraham's seed by faith we have the
[52:15] faith of Abraham and so it's our promise
[52:18] as well and in Jeremiah 33 verse 3 says
[52:21] call unto me and I will answer thee and
[52:23] show you Great and Mighty things God
[52:26] wants us to call on God wants us to pray
[52:29] jehoshaphat's prayer aren't you aren't
[52:31] you the same God save me didn't you heal
[52:34] me the last time didn't you save me
[52:35] didn't you do something for my family
[52:37] Lord aren't you the one that rules
[52:41] I'm looking to you Lord
[52:45] and faith is cultivated in the valley so
[52:47] that's where we have to grow the fruit
[52:50] and once you're through the valley God
[52:52] will have become more real relationships
[52:55] will have increased in depth and you'll
[52:56] be even more secure in his love and that
[52:59] same passage in in Chronicles that we've
[53:01] been reading he says Be not Afraid nor
[53:04] dismayed by reason of this great
[53:05] multitude for the battle is not yours
[53:07] but gods
[53:09] and so because we're talking about
[53:11] another dimension because you're talking
[53:12] about faith coming from another
[53:14] dimension it's not our faith it's his
[53:17] faith that he gives to us the battle is
[53:20] not ours it's God's he is fighting the
[53:23] battle and he's giving us the tools to
[53:24] do it so this is not your battle you
[53:28] shall not need to fight in this battle
[53:30] is the way God continues in that Passage
[53:33] stand ye still
[53:36] so we're talking about fighting we talk
[53:38] about footsteps opposition we're talking
[53:40] about taking hold of the promise and not
[53:43] just being a professor but a possessor
[53:47] in the natural
[53:48] but in the spiritual
[53:50] you do not need to fight this battle
[53:52] this isn't something you're gonna win in
[53:55] your own strength greater is he that is
[53:58] in me than is in the world not greater
[54:01] is me it's greater to see that is in me
[54:04] and so we do not fight the battle that
[54:07] battle is fought in the presence of God
[54:10] and with a revelation from God he says
[54:13] stand you still and see the salvation of
[54:15] the Lord fear not
[54:18] remember I said fear is the is like the
[54:20] second side of the coin of faith fear is
[54:24] just like faith
[54:25] but in a negative sense and so we do not
[54:29] want to believe things that do not come
[54:32] from scripture we do not want to believe
[54:33] what people say what the devil says we
[54:35] want to believe what God says so we do
[54:37] not fear nor are we dismayed tomorrow go
[54:41] out against them for the Lord will be
[54:45] with you and Jesus promised us that he
[54:47] would be in us even to the end of that
[54:50] so the promised land can't be attained
[54:52] by human ability so even though we're
[54:54] talking about all these natural actions
[54:57] it has to come from Revelation it has to
[54:59] come from the spirit realm God by faith
[55:03] gives it to those who are willing to put
[55:05] their complete trust in it and remember
[55:07] possess the promise and you'll possess
[55:10] the enemy's Gates that's what they
[55:12] learned at karishbanya we've got to get
[55:16] it
[55:17] we've got to take it it's ours but
[55:21] you'll fight for every inch and so we
[55:25] don't think of this as a picnic we don't
[55:27] think of this as a bit of roses we don't
[55:28] think of this as the as the the Primrose
[55:31] path
[55:33] we think of this as a Battlefield
[55:36] we think of this as an uphill battle
[55:39] because we're in the flesh and what
[55:42] we're working with is coming from
[55:44] another dimension it's coming from a
[55:46] different world and everything that we
[55:49] do here in the natural is from the
[55:52] perspective of God's revelation in our
[55:56] heart
[55:57] Deuteronomy 1 verse 21 behold the Lord
[55:59] God has set the land before you go up
[56:02] and possess it as the Lord God of your
[56:05] fathers has said unto you fear not
[56:07] neither be discouraged
[56:10] so God is Not confined by our
[56:13] limitations this is
[56:14] principle number five
[56:16] if you face the challenge don't give up
[56:18] and say well I can't see a way out of
[56:20] this
[56:21] you're looking at the circumstances
[56:23] you're limiting your understanding of
[56:27] God of Faith by what you're seeing with
[56:30] your natural Arts so you facing a
[56:33] challenge no question but don't give up
[56:36] in the face of the challenge because if
[56:39] you think there's no way out that
[56:41] implies that you've thought of
[56:42] everything and I hate to say this but it
[56:45] is of strong possibility that God might
[56:47] have thought of something you haven't
[56:50] it's just a very small possibility that
[56:53] he knows something you don't know
[56:56] is is that possible yes
[56:59] he knows a lot of things I don't know
[57:01] and so for me to give up
[57:04] is to go okay well I know there's no way
[57:07] out of this
[57:10] and if you want God to be proud of you
[57:13] and to give you a good report
[57:16] that's not going to work
[57:18] he doesn't want to hear that you're
[57:20] giving up
[57:22] right and I will say this
[57:23] and we kind of took off the ramming
[57:26] speed for a minute
[57:29] when when we know what God has said and
[57:34] we put our faith in our trust in that
[57:36] all right and we know that he's still on
[57:38] the throne and we know that we can't
[57:41] know the end from the beginning or the
[57:43] future
[57:45] we know that he knows all those things
[57:48] and so we look to him the author and the
[57:51] finish of our faith we don't look to the
[57:53] circumstance we don't look to the
[57:55] difficulty
[57:56] so we may not see a way but God has
[57:59] already seen the future
[58:01] and the way in which your problem will
[58:03] be overcome he already knows he's
[58:06] already provided for it while you yet
[58:09] speak I will answer you
[58:12] isn't that amazing before you ask I'll
[58:15] hear you and while you yet speak I will
[58:17] I will I will answer you I'll stop
[58:21] trying to quote that verse so we
[58:23] continue with this idea of God's Not
[58:25] confined by our limitations when you
[58:27] can't see a way around the problem look
[58:29] away from the problem
[58:31] and look to the sufficiency of God and
[58:34] I'm going to give you this little story
[58:36] I read I've got a big picture book at
[58:39] home it's called Earth
[58:40] and its photos from the original space
[58:44] missions the guys orbiting around Earth
[58:47] and one of the pictures is of the
[58:50] Himalayas or as some people say
[58:52] Himalayas
[58:54] and
[58:56] they're looking down right on the
[58:59] tallest mountains in the world at least
[59:01] the ones above sea level
[59:03] and they're looking at Everest and
[59:06] they're saying
[59:08] we can't even
[59:09] really see which of these Peaks is
[59:12] Everest
[59:13] because they're looking down
[59:16] so when you're looking up at a problem
[59:18] it looks enormous
[59:20] but as Zechariah said these mountains
[59:23] shall become mole Hills
[59:26] from God's perspective he can't even
[59:29] tell that there's a problem
[59:34] what problem
[59:36] I can't even see Everest let alone your
[59:39] problem
[59:40] I can't see these tallest mountains in
[59:42] the world I I just see little
[59:44] snow-capped Peaks
[59:46] because he's looking from above
[59:49] and so when we have a revelation of
[59:51] Faith from God we get God's perspective
[59:55] looking down into our situation and he
[59:59] does not see the difficulties the way we
[1:00:02] see them so instead of looking at this
[1:00:04] great big mountain in front of us
[1:00:07] from our Valley perspective let's come
[1:00:09] up a little bit higher and see it from
[1:00:12] God's perspective and focus then on
[1:00:15] God's sufficiency
[1:00:17] and faith is where we look beyond the
[1:00:19] problem and see the security of knowing
[1:00:22] who God is knowing his character When
[1:00:25] Faith is quickened the circumstances
[1:00:28] crumble it's like the whole Mountain
[1:00:31] just begins to dissolve when we're
[1:00:34] looking at it from God's perspective
[1:00:36] and then number six principle is hearing
[1:00:39] and obeying hearing only counts I want
[1:00:42] to tell you this because we often quote
[1:00:45] this scripture quite rightly faith comes
[1:00:47] by hearing hearing comes by the word
[1:00:49] but hearing only counts when we start to
[1:00:51] obey what we've heard those uh those
[1:00:55] israeliteshwania they've heard it
[1:00:57] they've heard it all they had heard all
[1:00:59] the preaching they've seen all the
[1:01:01] Miracles
[1:01:03] the only thing they were missing was
[1:01:05] acting on what they'd heard being
[1:01:08] willing to act only Joshua and Caleb
[1:01:10] were willing to act on what they had
[1:01:12] heard and so we have to obey what we've
[1:01:15] heard that means to apply it and to act
[1:01:18] upon what we know
[1:01:20] I think I missed one
[1:01:22] saying you believe and not acting is
[1:01:25] what happened to Israel at California
[1:01:27] saying you believe professing but not
[1:01:30] possessing
[1:01:32] I mentioned about the laundry I love
[1:01:35] this saying as well faith is like a
[1:01:38] Swiss Swatch it takes good works to make
[1:01:40] it useful
[1:01:43] it's got to be a sound mechanism
[1:01:46] it's got to have something that shows
[1:01:49] you what the time is
[1:01:52] in our lives we're not trying to impress
[1:01:54] God God doesn't need to be you know his
[1:01:56] information to be reinforced he doesn't
[1:01:59] need to take up temperature he knows
[1:02:01] exactly how our faith is
[1:02:03] but we need to have our faith
[1:02:06] temperature taken he needs to show us so
[1:02:08] Romans chapter 2 verse 13 for not the
[1:02:11] hearers of the law are just or Justified
[1:02:13] before God but the doers of the law
[1:02:16] shall be justified very important
[1:02:18] scripture Revelation chapter 1 verse 3
[1:02:21] blessed is he that reads and they that
[1:02:23] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:02:26] act and apply those things and keep
[1:02:29] those things which are written there and
[1:02:31] for the time is at hand so we mustn't
[1:02:34] accept the Judgment of Our Own Heart our
[1:02:36] own thoughts God's thoughts are higher
[1:02:39] than our thoughts his ways are not our
[1:02:41] ways and so we cannot trust our own way
[1:02:45] of thinking that's where we run into
[1:02:47] difficulty that's what happened to Eve
[1:02:49] that's what happened in every case of
[1:02:51] anybody that failed God in the scripture
[1:02:54] they were acting on their own thoughts
[1:02:57] and ideas about how things should be and
[1:02:59] the fact that you've failed in some way
[1:03:01] doesn't affect God's love for you it
[1:03:04] doesn't matter God is not looking at you
[1:03:08] day by day and and putting you in the
[1:03:11] scales of justice and going oh tilt
[1:03:14] yep yep we went over there sorry I'm
[1:03:17] gonna have to bring you all the way back
[1:03:19] to the beginning now we're gonna have to
[1:03:20] start this process again so you want to
[1:03:22] come to the whole thing you want to get
[1:03:23] saved and you've got to get baptized and
[1:03:24] we'll keep we'll start this process
[1:03:26] again nope
[1:03:28] no because he's already got a picture of
[1:03:30] us in his wallet
[1:03:33] he carries around the picture
[1:03:35] I don't know if God's got a wallet but
[1:03:37] it's a good idea right
[1:03:39] and he's got a picture of us
[1:03:40] and when we slip up he just takes it out
[1:03:43] and he takes a look at it and he goes ha
[1:03:46] that's the one I'm looking for that's
[1:03:48] the picture he took of us at the
[1:03:49] foundation of the world he knows our
[1:03:52] destiny he knows where we're going he
[1:03:55] knows how we're going to get there and
[1:03:56] he knows what he has to do to bring it
[1:03:58] about
[1:03:59] and so he we are not letting God down in
[1:04:03] the sense that we have to go back and
[1:04:05] start again
[1:04:06] it's just for us to know where we stand
[1:04:10] that's what this is all about it doesn't
[1:04:13] affect his promises
[1:04:15] and the fact that you've failed doesn't
[1:04:18] affect God's love for you he still loves
[1:04:21] us
[1:04:22] so hearing and obeying we read that oh
[1:04:24] I'm going backwards so I wondered why
[1:04:26] it's coming up again
[1:04:28] so we have to slow down our ramming
[1:04:31] speed
[1:04:32] so what is number eight what is another
[1:04:36] principle for life in the valley faith
[1:04:38] in the valley it's our goal that we
[1:04:41] manifest Christ
[1:04:43] in the valley
[1:04:46] it's a little bit easier on the
[1:04:47] Mountaintop but in the valley that's a
[1:04:50] little bit more challenging but we are
[1:04:52] going on to our Heaven reward our goal
[1:04:54] is not to fight Giants by the way
[1:04:57] we think oh we know we've got to have
[1:04:59] all these battles yeah not exactly he'll
[1:05:02] provide the giant killing strength if we
[1:05:05] need it but killing Giants is not the
[1:05:07] destination remember possessing the land
[1:05:11] was the destination manifesting The Life
[1:05:14] of Christ in all situations that's the
[1:05:18] destination that's God's purpose that's
[1:05:21] why we're here that's what he's bringing
[1:05:24] about in our lives and so God expects us
[1:05:28] to possess that future right now he's
[1:05:30] called us out of Egypt he wants us to be
[1:05:34] his beautiful bride without spot and
[1:05:36] without blemish a glorious Church
[1:05:39] and he wants us to be the beneficiary of
[1:05:42] his inheritance
[1:05:45] and every step we take
[1:05:47] toward that promise will be prospered by
[1:05:51] God because he said every place on which
[1:05:54] you put so true I've given it to you
[1:05:56] footsteps opposition it will be
[1:05:59] prospered by God God will and detect for
[1:06:02] you but we have to possess those
[1:06:06] promises not just talk about them
[1:06:11] so this happened in Jerusalem as we
[1:06:13] close here just the last couple of
[1:06:15] slides
[1:06:16] and when he was come near he beheld the
[1:06:18] city and Jesus wept over if we all know
[1:06:21] when Jesus wept over Jerusalem saying if
[1:06:24] you had known even though
[1:06:28] I love that even thou I wonder is that
[1:06:32] talking to us today is that why it says
[1:06:34] even though
[1:06:35] that we go even Stephen
[1:06:40] even even you yeah
[1:06:43] yes you
[1:06:45] you know that that's what it looks like
[1:06:47] to me he says if you had known even you
[1:06:51] at least in this thy day and we all know
[1:06:55] this is a particular day the things
[1:06:58] which belong unto your peace
[1:07:02] can you see what Jesus is saying he said
[1:07:04] oh Jerusalem he said all of this today
[1:07:07] this was your hour of Deliverance this
[1:07:10] was everything the prophets had looked
[1:07:11] for this this was where you would accept
[1:07:14] your Messiah and if you could only have
[1:07:16] accepted it that would have been the
[1:07:18] Peace of Jerusalem that was promised
[1:07:21] but now they are hip from your eyes
[1:07:25] for the day shall come upon you that
[1:07:27] your enemies shall lay the even flat on
[1:07:31] the ground because you knew not the time
[1:07:34] of your visitation
[1:07:36] and so I want to say this When Faith
[1:07:38] arises
[1:07:40] that's the time to step in
[1:07:43] when God gives us that Revelation when
[1:07:45] we see what's happening in a spiritual
[1:07:49] sense in in the Eternal sense in what
[1:07:53] God's plan and purpose for us is and
[1:07:56] when we recognize that and we step into
[1:07:59] it when we possess those things
[1:08:02] then we're recognizing our day and its
[1:08:06] message
[1:08:06] not just in a doctrinal sense but in an
[1:08:10] everyday
[1:08:11] faith-filled life since
[1:08:14] that every day we need to have that
[1:08:16] experience with God in trials and in
[1:08:20] good times we need to have that
[1:08:25] touch if I can put it that way that
[1:08:27] experience with the supernatural we
[1:08:31] can't just put everything into a natural
[1:08:33] realm and then at another time another
[1:08:36] place a spiritual realm no those two
[1:08:38] things have to come together
[1:08:40] we have to live in that Realm by God's
[1:08:44] grace
[1:08:46] and just to show you that in the same
[1:08:48] Valley we're a whole nation found
[1:08:50] failure two people found faith
[1:08:52] so this isn't common
[1:08:54] this isn't easy this isn't something
[1:08:56] that you can just lay back as for the
[1:09:00] random said and just expect it to happen
[1:09:03] that God take you by the throne push you
[1:09:05] into this situation where he can show
[1:09:08] himself Mighty on your behalf
[1:09:11] he wants you to go but Lord aren't you
[1:09:15] that God
[1:09:16] aren't you the God who did all these
[1:09:18] things for me and didn't you do this for
[1:09:20] my brother and my sister the other day
[1:09:22] and I believe you can do for me the same
[1:09:25] and so two people found faith I want you
[1:09:27] to remember this as a principle of God
[1:09:29] one in a million
[1:09:31] you remember the same word that we
[1:09:34] believe the same word of faith the same
[1:09:35] faith that we hold on to
[1:09:37] when when things are tough we hold on to
[1:09:40] their faith from the word of God
[1:09:42] he says that faith that rock
[1:09:45] is a stone of stumbling to those who
[1:09:48] don't believe you see the the same
[1:09:51] Circumstance the same Valley the same
[1:09:54] enemy
[1:09:55] everything's the same the only
[1:09:57] difference is two people trusted the
[1:10:00] word of God and so we have to be super
[1:10:04] on our on our guard at guard against
[1:10:10] falling into a trap where we don't reach
[1:10:14] out and take possession of what God has
[1:10:16] given us now you might miss an
[1:10:18] opportunity that you can ever get back
[1:10:20] maybe there may be another come around
[1:10:22] the corner but that one you may have
[1:10:24] missed so don't be slow to obey
[1:10:27] action is can you obey quickly and the
[1:10:31] Hebrews Disobedience as we get ready to
[1:10:33] close the history of their time in the
[1:10:35] desert is brief and it's bitter
[1:10:39] and the desert
[1:10:41] was a place that their Journey their
[1:10:44] wilderness wanderings
[1:10:46] was a desert of the disease
[1:10:49] defeat
[1:10:51] and finally death
[1:10:53] and for some reason I can't see my notes
[1:10:56] so I had I had some
[1:10:59] statistics here and I'll try and
[1:11:02] remember them
[1:11:03] but for that period of time that they
[1:11:06] were wandering in the wilderness after
[1:11:08] kadeshbania where disease
[1:11:11] and defeat
[1:11:13] resulted in death
[1:11:16] they estimate that there were about 90
[1:11:18] people a day that had to die to get rid
[1:11:21] of that generation
[1:11:23] and those that were alive
[1:11:25] had to dig
[1:11:27] and bury the dead
[1:11:30] they had to dig a grave and no sooner
[1:11:33] they dug one then there was that and
[1:11:36] there was another one too and fat and
[1:11:39] another one and so they were dying and
[1:11:42] falling dying and falling every day for
[1:11:46] the next 40 years
[1:11:48] to get rid of that generation and so you
[1:11:51] can see the consequence of sin when
[1:11:53] those people that had listened to the
[1:11:55] faithless spies and they went back on
[1:11:58] their journey and they were digging
[1:12:00] Graves every day
[1:12:01] they were thinking back to that decision
[1:12:04] that they made at kadishmania to listen
[1:12:07] to those ten spies when they should have
[1:12:10] listened to Joshua and Caleb
[1:12:13] because those people all died and the
[1:12:16] tip for the generation of kids that came
[1:12:19] out of Egypt not one of them except
[1:12:21] Joshua and Caleb made it
[1:12:24] and so I'll finish with this as the
[1:12:26] musicians come Isaiah chapter 54 13
[1:12:30] great shall be the Peace of your
[1:12:32] children they shall be taught
[1:12:35] of the Lord
[1:12:37] great will be the Peace of your children
[1:12:39] Jesus said you would have had peace if
[1:12:42] you could have just heard my voice if
[1:12:44] you could have just responded
[1:12:46] you would have had this peace and II
[1:12:49] Chronicles chapter 16 verse 9. for the
[1:12:52] eyes of the Lord ran to and fro
[1:12:54] throughout the whole Earth to show
[1:12:57] himself strong in the behalf of them
[1:13:00] whose heart is perfect toward him
[1:13:05] he wants to show himself strong let's
[1:13:08] stand he wants to show himself strong he
[1:13:12] wants us to call upon him he wants us to
[1:13:15] say Lord I can't do this on my own I
[1:13:18] know you've called me and I know I'm
[1:13:21] part of your plan but Lord I need you
[1:13:24] every hour of every day I need you to
[1:13:27] come and give me the faith give me the
[1:13:30] strength give me the revelation of your
[1:13:31] word in my heart that Lord I can face
[1:13:34] this battle I can face these Giants
[1:13:37] without fear and without disappointment
[1:13:40] without discouragement but with
[1:13:42] confidence
[1:13:43] and that we can go where we haven't been
[1:13:45] before through this trial because we
[1:13:48] know what your word says and so let's
[1:13:51] bow our heads Lord Jesus
[1:13:52] we do want to come before you've thrown
[1:13:55] the sea this morning Lord or this
[1:13:57] afternoon we do want to acknowledge you
[1:13:59] in all our ways and believe that you
[1:14:01] will direct our paths and Lord where we
[1:14:04] lack faith we pray Lord that you would
[1:14:06] fill us up bring from that Heavenly
[1:14:10] realm Lord pour into us the faith that
[1:14:13] we need for our circumstances for every
[1:14:16] trial for healing Lord for deliverance
[1:14:18] for whatever the challenge of the day
[1:14:21] may be Lord we know you have a solution
[1:14:24] from your kingdom Lord that you can pour
[1:14:27] into our lives Lord we love you we love
[1:14:30] what you've done for us we love what you
[1:14:33] have done for us in the past but lord
[1:14:35] it's a new day it's a new trial it's a
[1:14:39] new opportunity Lord for us to rise in
[1:14:42] our faith and Lord we pray that you
[1:14:45] would help us to come up a little bit
[1:14:47] higher Even in our daily lives Lord in
[1:14:51] this Natural Life and Lord may we have
[1:14:54] the faith and the courage to take
[1:14:55] another step to move into those areas
[1:14:58] that we haven't been in before
[1:15:01] and to see what you have
[1:15:03] plan for wrestle through the trial the
[1:15:07] testimony that you want us to have
[1:15:10] we pray Lord that you would take away
[1:15:13] everything the obstacle that would
[1:15:16] prevent that Lord every unbelief every
[1:15:19] doubt every circumstance that we give
[1:15:22] too much power to
[1:15:24] that Lord we would realize you are the
[1:15:27] all-powerful
[1:15:28] and Lord I just pray and speak to every
[1:15:30] heart call all of us that are going
[1:15:33] through a valley Lord I just pray that
[1:15:36] you would come and meet us Lord with
[1:15:38] those streams of Living Water and that
[1:15:41] Lord you would just fill us to overfly
[1:15:43] wash us with your word Lord cleanse us
[1:15:46] Lord Jesus and give us the victory that
[1:15:50] you've promised would be ours we ask
[1:15:53] them all in Jesus name amen
[1:15:56] thank you
[1:15:58] brother Michael
