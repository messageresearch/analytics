so here I stand today [Music] giving my life [Music] away no sleep could be too great no sacrifice too much to make no way of man measuring the cost next to the blood of Cal's cross so if I live I live for him or if I die I count again my life is not my own but his from this day on and now I'm giving my life away I'm laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very I can offer is my so here I stand today giving my life away now I'm giving my life life way I'm laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is my own so here I S today giving my life away first John chapter 3 if You' turn with me and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things he knoweth you know all things pretty much covers everything uh he knoweth all things that means he knows you and he knows what you're going through and he knows your heart and he knows you better than you know yourself these are these are things we can anchor in to have confidence and to have peace when our heart doesn't have confidence and when our heart is feeling condemned we anchor into the the the assurance that God knows all things for if our heart cond excuse me hereby we know that we of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things but we should finish the theme Here beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight now in 1 John chapter 3 in verse 19 I want to read it in another translation and uh go into this just few scriptures here about condemnation in the heart to hear the voice of condemnation uh which is usually the voice of Satan you can condemn yourself and you can belittle yourself but most of the condemnation is is origin ated from our enemy Satan because he dwells in the realm of condemnation Satan dwells in the realm of guilt Satan is the top um you know people that put a guilt trip on you Satan was the originator of that he is the guilt trip enemy that knows how to put guilt in the heart of an individual and you know why he's so good at at at speaking voices of condemnation you know why he's so guilt uh so good at uh speaking guilt to you is because he's guilty he's a guilty creature he's done a lot of bad stuff and he's guilty and he can't he can't find repentance and so he's got an accumulation from even in heaven before the Earth was created even in heaven he's accumulated a lot of things that he's caused a lot of stir a lot of rebellion can you say amen and he's got 6,000 years of it now on Earth and he's under guilt and shame and condemnation and so we don't want to receive voices we we don't want to be listening to a voice of a guilt-ridden creature that doesn't know how to find relief for his guilt we don't want to be listening to a voice like that we don't want a voice like that governing our hearts can you say Amen because we are called to be free from condemnation can I get get an amen this morning but the reason that he is so much that way is because he's guilty himself I'll get into a little bit that a little more of that in a minute now in another translation it says in verse 19 if you're reading along this then is how we know that we belong to the truth this is how we uh that we will be confident in God's presence so this is something I don't want you to skip over and just just miss this morning when we come into the presence of God we are supposed to come a certain way and that's to come and stand confident in his presence and in order to stand confidence in his presence and in order to worship freely I was watching in the office on the Monitor and so many people just lifting their hands Isn't it nice to have a place that we can worship freely can you say amen and just lift our hands and dance or shout or say Amen or sing to the top of our voice even if you don't have a good voice you can sing to the top of your voice I won't to ask you to raise your hand who that is this morning morning but you can Worship the Lord freely can you say amen and and so I was a wonderful thing to see but when we come to God and when we come into His presence whether it's in church or in your home there's a way that we need to come and that's to be confident uh to one word in the Bible in Hebrews is bold to come into His presence boldly bring in our petitions to him and there's no way to come confident and boldly if you have condemnation in your heart you can't worship freely if you have condemnation so we have to talk about this because he said this is how we be we're confident in God's presence presence if our conscience condemns us we know that God is greater than our conscience and that he knows everything now we're we're a a five-part being uh uh both in the flesh and in the spirit our soul is one thing we can have unbelief in our soul but then when God converts us we We Believe from our soul but then we're we're there's other parts of us me memory imagination conscience affection reasoning and the conscience part all these parts are important but the conscience part is many times where the devil reeks habit so we got all these other areas of us and if our soul becomes born again then Satan only has uh the uh the spirit part he has our memory he has imagination he has conscience he has affection he has reasoning then five parts to our body see taste feel smell and here to physically make us ill it's all he's left with but the victory is is that there's so much going on in the soul that that as brother ramam said in greatest battle ever fought you blow out all these fools and all these channels can you say Amen bring it under subjection to God and then he says the devil doesn't know how to what to do with you because and so here is the the truth and greatest battle it's not just that our souls are saved that's not a life of Victory the life of Victory is we take all these other emotional conscience memory and we bring him under God fill them with the Holy Spirit instead of the enemy and now we're talking a Victorious Christian now we're talking a maturing Christian now we're talking somebody he's he's getting some Victory and can worship freely and can be confident can you say Amen so now uh obviously here Christians should live with a confidence that we are of the truth that's the first statement that we we must know that we were of the truth not only do we believe the truth but we are that's how it's worded we are of the truth that's deeper than believing the truth we are actually of the truth we are children we are Offspring yeah of Mr truth himself Jesus Christ we're not just believing truth like here's the Bible and and we believe all the things that's in it no we are of the truth we have been birthed by the UNC Incorruptible seed word of God we are children of Truth say well I believe this message I believe the devil believes the message in certain ways certain parts of it the devil believes and he trembles there's no furtherance of his belief the devil mechanically can believe it but you see now that's not what we are we're not just people that are believing the truth we are of the truth we are connected we are Offspring we are the seed of the word we don't just believe the devil believes we are connected with truth can you say amen I receive truth because truth is in me that's deeper than just believing we hear it so much just believe believe you got to believe this believe the message believe it but this is deeper than believe it we have to be birthed and be of truth truth is us it's more a part of us than anything else life we are a people of Truth we're Children of the truth that's the Father and Son Fellowship it's truth can you say Amen our fellowship with is the father and his son the son is the word and the the word is truth and the father sent the word truth and so this is the fellowship between the father and the son it's Fellowship this is not a mental exercise we are children of Truth can you say Amen we are to come and to assure our hearts in his presence here's the next statement when we come we are to assure our hearts in other words we set our hearts at rest we reassure our hearts in his presence confidence when we come into His presence that's the way that we should be coming completely free nothing between us when we come there shouldn't be anything between us and God now I'm not being critical but I I would just say that a lot of us because we don't know this is the way that we come to God and this is the way we come to his presence is that we deal with everything we bring it under the blood if it's sin we bring it under the blood if if it's guilt if it's a voice of condemnation we deal with it we deal with it and why that's so we can stand in the presence of almighty God with confidence not guilt that's right and this is the way that we come completely free nothing between us we stand there with no Shadows of Doubt how many would like to worship with no Shadows of doubt in your system at all see is that possible obviously the scripture is talking about it that we stand with no Shadows of doubt this is the way that we should come before the Lord this is the way we should come to church did you know that there's a way to come to church let me step back a minute did you know how you're created as a human being you know one of the things I find with people is they haven't studied themselves to know how we tick as a human being and I find the devil has studied human beings a lot better than we have he knows how the human being ticks and besides that he has studied you personally your whole life like a boxer studies his enemy and the boxer studies he get a box he watches videos of them he knows where to get you where your weak spots are Satan has studied you your whole life and knows your weak spots he's he's committed to doing it he's done it your whole life and sometimes he understands you better than you understand yourself that's why he gets you all the time because there are per particular weaknesses with one person that it's a weakness with them it may not be a weakness with another person but it's you and it's where the devil get you how can he get you there because he studied you he knows this is where I can attack this is where I can get him but you haven't studied yourself enough to know when we come through the sexual Temptation classes and last fall we were we were uh we were talking about those things and that you can not only study the word and the scriptures first of all be filled with the Holy Ghost then we study the scriptures so we can use the word against the enemy in the temptation but then we study ourselves and know how we function because there's certain things one man can do that another man can't do he can't go there because it's a temptation to them so I thought I'd bring that in is that you know we have to we have to uh study ourselves but then there's a way that we come to church there's a way if we know how we're built as a human being it's hard to get in the spirit and the flow of what the Lord's presence would be to speak to you if you come without some preparation so I have to stop as a pastor and teacher this because I know some of you don't know it I know some of you you haven't thought of church or the maybe the Lord or preparing your heart getting stuff out and just getting released you haven't thought about it all week you've thought about this and that and the other and business and everything else you haven't give church a thought you haven't prayed for the pastor you haven't prepared your heart if I'm rebuking yes I am a bit because people sometimes don't know there's a preparation that we as human beings have to do to get into the spirit there's a releasing of things Lord I'm praying for that man of God I know he's studying I know he's in prayer but I'm in prayer and I'm put in an atmosphere because I'm prepared myself to meet you and then God and His grace then some of you come you've got everything on your mind and the deacons have asked you to leave your phones somewhere else besides in here and and you you've You' you're turning them on in church and checking business and everything you come with all kinds of things on your heart unresolved all these things well brother Paul I come to get help but you see how much better would it be is to prepare and release things and worship freely how much better would it be I may have to preach this without too many amens because too many of us don't pray to prepare our hearts and to release our hearts and say come in and so we're depending on brother Gideon and brother Michael to pull us out of our mlly grubs and to help us get our hearts all freed up by the time brother Paul preaches that's not really the way you're supposed to do [Applause] it might be good to do some praying Saturday night instead of watching that movie till midnight or 1 in the morning and then you watch till 1 in the morning and this is the kind of Isaac I get what I'm preaching this kind of eyes I get and I yell and I wake you up and then you drift off again maybe you should give you should have Give the Lord a little bit more priority than that but you don't understand you don't understand some of the basic things of how we work and that we are called not just to live in this world and make money and we're called to be worshippers yes and it's not just in church we worship in our lives we worship in our testimony we worship when we're in the word we worship in our tithes and offerings and our giving we we we are worshippers can you say Amen we are wor worshippers when we're witnessing to somebody we're worshippers when we do go make a business decision we're worshippers so we say Lord I'm going to worship you today I need leadership in this decision I'm going to make we are not called to be like the rest of the world we are worshippers Jesus prophesied of some of you maybe all of you he said to the woman at the well one day the true worship shers will be on the face of the Earth who will worship God in spirit and in truth I believe I'm preaching to some of them here this morning can you say Amen we're called to be worshippers in the last days but you can't worship with a condemned heart and so there's a certain preparation there's a certain getting ready there's a certain of preparing us to come this may be basic to you this morning you cannot have a heart that's clogged that's bogged down that's burdened it must be released so that you can worship freely and that you can receive the word freely instead of a block instead of a wall up instead of being all locked up in your hearts can you say Amen so we need to come to church get our hearts ready to come perfectly clear if at all possible if you have needs things you don't understand to bring those things to the altar bring those things to God to clear it up to be cleared up to be ready uh but sometimes with the Shadows you're hoping brother Gideon and the music crew can cast off help you cast off some of those troubles and make you forget them for a couple hours I don't want you to forget your troubles for a couple hours in church I want you to receive the power of redemption and atonement that you would be released can you say Amen that you can go back as a Victorious Christian on Monday Hallelujah that's not the way that comes so we should learn how to come to church we come this way and even if our hearts has condemnation here here's the next truth now we're just taking it little by little even if our hearts has condemnation God is greater than the condemnation oh now I can preach do you have that Revelation or does condemnation in the heart overwhelm you and it's more important till God can't work in your life but you see now we almost we almost always must remember the Revelation that no matter how much condemnation the devil uses in our heart God is greater than our heart that means that what God says about you can be different than what your heart is saying about you the heart is the seed of your emotions it's not your soul so your heart can be saying something different than what God says about you but I'm here to tell you what God Said is about you to your soul is greater than what you hear in your heart God is greater than the condemnation that's in your heart the heart is the seed of the emotions voices can come from there condemning voices guilty voices voices condemnation voices but this conscience is a messy thing because it can be telling you stuff that's right but then it can be telling you stuff that's did like I teach the young people the heart the Bible says is deceitful above all things and then we got the songs that say follow your heart trust your heart you fell in love with this guy he's about 30 feet away but you have fallen in love what do I do follow your heart you don't follow your heart because the Bible says it's deceitful above all things and the thing with the heart like I tell young people you could come you can meet the guy you could start a relationship and the next day or the next week your heart could change and you can't stand them you were ready to order the flowers because your heart said this is the one right right but your heart can play games because he might pick his nose you might hear him snore you heard him blow his no nose he blew his nose and it was like a hurricane hit the room all of a sudden your heart's going I don't love this guy as much as I did before the next week that's why in marriage it's not about where your heart goes it's an absolute that my love has committed to them even if they snore bad even if they pick their nose well ladies you may work on him he might start to get better habits later but your marriage commitment is whether he picks his nose or not that's not in my notes that's that's free doesn't cost you a thing so now this conscience it's it's in all these areas this means that condemnation can be in your heart but it's not coming from the soul if you you know the scripture if you're in Christ there is no condemnation none when You' passed from Death unto life you don't go to the Judgment someday God judged you at Calvary God washed away your sins you stand Justified before the judge and so your conscience is in a state but the state you're conscious in is not your standing with the Lord right your state can be different than your standing your standing with the Lord doesn't change I need some of you to latch on and say Amen to that your standing with the Lord cannot change even though your conscience can wreak havit and be up and down and you don't have a clue what's going on your state that you're in does not change your standing the state that job was in did not change his standing with God and so God is greater if our hearts are condemning us hey latch on to the revelation God is greater than our hearts the state of your heart and any moment can never uh change your standing with God never change it some who make mistakes are still Sons when my children made mistakes I didn't kick them out of the home why they were born in my family there's sons and daughters and they have made mistakes and we sons of God have made mistakes but it never changes our standing as Sons and Daughters can you say amen I need some of you who are constantly Bound by the condemnation of the devil whether by the that you've let him in or it's a past Ministry you're under I need you to I preach these for your Victory you have to latch on to this for yourself and you have to say God is greater than the condemnation in my heart no matter where it's come from my standing never changes even though my state of my heart can be up and down God and his thoughts of you will always be greater than the condemnation of your heart Grace will always be greater than sin has proved it time and again Grace will always be greater than your sin we're reading the rest of First John because we think we leave it alone if there's condemnation in our heart I'm ignore that and I'm going on because God is greater than my heart he is greater than your heart but look at the rest of the scriptures look at the next one beloved if our heart verse 21 beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him so now it doesn't end of holding the condemnation there greater Victory is that we would release the condemnation that's there thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like
