[24:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Give us a second.
[25:11] In a world around me [music]
[25:16] where wickedness [singing] abounds
[25:20] a proud and boastful spirit
[25:23] in Satan's Eden [music and singing]
[25:25] I am found.
[25:29] But God has called his people
[25:33] to walk in his humilies
[25:38] to have [singing] a humble heart
[25:42] and live life in simplicity. [singing]
[25:45] [music]
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, give me a humble heart
[25:51] [singing and music] like yours is what I
[25:54] pray.
[25:56] I don't want to [singing and music]
[25:58] be hoty or think I'm great in any way.
[26:05] You showed us by example [singing]
[26:09] how to [music] serve our fellow man.
[26:14] To live [singing] our lives for [music]
[26:17] others
[26:18] is your great and mighty plan.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; If my heart is lifted up.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; If I think [singing] that I am [music]
[26:32] great,
[26:33] your holy spirit [singing] will be
[26:36] [music] grieved. The hotty look the Lord
[26:39] does [singing] hate.
[26:43] Pride will separate [music]
[26:45] us from the presence of the Lord.
[26:49] [singing]
[26:52] Being full of vanity [music and singing]
[26:55] or boastfulness has no reward.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, [music and singing]
[27:01] give me a humble heart like yours
[27:06] [singing] is what I pray.
[27:09] I don't want [music] to be hoty
[27:13] or think [singing] I'm great in any way.
[27:16] [music]
[27:18] You showed us [singing] by example

[34:03] [music]
[34:15] Let's just turn in our Bibles if you
[34:16] would.
[34:18] Hebrews chapter 11. Just just stay.
[34:24] Amen.
[34:27] Hebrews chapter 11. And we're going to
[34:30] just read
[34:33] one of the scriptures we read from last
[34:35] Sunday.
[34:37] and to continue on a little bit with
[34:39] that subject. God bless you all the
[34:40] visitors that are here with us this
[34:42] morning and we pray the word of God will
[34:44] find a place in your hearts. We are
[34:47] living in
[34:49] uh troublesome times and uh every day
[34:53] it's not that we have shootings every
[34:56] day but it's sometimes two and three in
[34:58] a day now and uh we are praying for the
[35:00] families that have lost these some of
[35:03] the celebration in Australia uh
[35:05] yesterday and someone um lashing out
[35:07] their anger and shooting I think it was
[35:09] 12 there and and so this morning the
[35:12] safe place in Christ we value it and And
[35:15] we appreciate that we have a place to
[35:17] come, but I think eventually there may
[35:19] not be any safe place to go except in
[35:21] Jesus Christ and except in the word. So
[35:24] we pray for those families and we
[35:26] realize the world that we're living in
[35:27] has changed and is changing every day
[35:30] getting closer to this wrapping up and
[35:33] what we do today in the presence of the
[35:35] Lord and this word coming. It's not me
[35:38] but this word. What we're doing today
[35:40] giving this attention and settling down
[35:42] from our busy lives. I know probably
[35:45] none of you have a busy life, but
[35:46] anyway, most people do. And to shut all
[35:50] of that out and to give attention right
[35:52] now for an hour or so to this is the
[35:55] most important thing we can do. We need
[35:57] revelation. We need to know where we
[35:59] stand. There's a lot of mental
[36:01] instability today, even amongst
[36:03] sometimes our own groups. There's a lot
[36:05] of things and demons that we're fighting
[36:07] against. We need this word to stabilize
[36:10] our minds and hearts that we know where
[36:12] we stand. And thankfully this morning
[36:14] that don't come, it's not me. That's the
[36:16] word he's provided. Brother Bram said it
[36:18] this way. He said, "We're he headed for
[36:20] turbulent waters in the 1960s." He said,
[36:22] "But God has put the stabilizers in the
[36:25] ship and will crest every one of these
[36:27] waves until the rapture. He's given us
[36:29] the word for our families, for our
[36:31] lives, for for for our mental stability.
[36:35] He's given us the word for that in his
[36:37] presence. And we we rejoice in that this
[36:39] morning." Hebrews chap 11 and I was
[36:43] reading last Sunday a little bit about
[36:44] Abraham and Sarah particularly Sarah.
[36:47] Hebrews 11:8 says, "By faith Abraham,
[36:49] when he was called to go out into a
[36:51] place which he should after receive for
[36:53] inheritance, obeyed, and he went out,
[36:55] not knowing whether he went. By faith he
[36:57] sojourned in the land of promise, as it
[36:59] a strange country, dwelling in
[37:01] tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
[37:04] heirs with him of the promise, same
[37:06] promise. For he looked for a city which
[37:08] hath foundations, whose builder and
[37:11] maker is God." Brother Eli was on that
[37:13] uh Wednesday night. wonderful message
[37:15] Wednesday night on that. And then we
[37:17] find Sarah comes into the picture who we
[37:19] said last Sunday. She didn't come as
[37:21] quick to the revelation as Abraham did.
[37:23] And Abraham was the prophet of the hour.
[37:25] It was also her husband. And he come to
[37:28] this revelation pretty quickly. Faith is
[37:30] a revelation. And he come and once you
[37:32] come to Revelation, you see you see what
[37:34] you need to see in God's eyes. But Sarah
[37:36] didn't come to that too quickly. But
[37:38] thank God she finally come to it. And
[37:40] that's why I was preaching last Sunday.
[37:42] They need to have grace for the Sarah
[37:44] cuz there are many Sarah. They don't see
[37:46] it right away. But if they're a daughter
[37:49] of God, if they're a son of God, they're
[37:51] going to see it.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And she seen it cuz it said and she made
[37:55] it to the the hall of faith chapter
[37:57] through faith also. Sarah herself
[38:00] received strength to conceive seed and
[38:04] was delivered of a child when she was
[38:06] past age because she judged him faithful
[38:11] who had promised.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; How many need that strength this
[38:15] morning?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I wonder if she's
[38:17] saying as she said there she judged him
[38:19] faithful. I wonder if she's saying he's
[38:21] been faithful faithful to me.
[38:26] Looking back,
[38:29] his love and mercy [singing]
[38:32] I see
[38:37] in my heart.
[38:40] I've had questions,
[38:43] even failed
[38:45] [singing] to believe.
[38:47] But he's been faithful.
[38:52] They fall
[38:54] to me.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Sing it again. He's been faithful.
[39:01] [singing]
[39:03] So faithful
[39:05] to me. [music]
[39:07] Hallelujah.
[39:10] Looking [music] back,
[39:13] his love [singing] and mercy
[39:16] I see.
[39:18] [singing]
[39:21] And in my heart
[39:24] I've had questions
[39:27] even fail
[39:30] to believe. [music]
[39:32] Yet he's been faithful.
[39:36] Faithful.
[39:38] Has he been faithful to you? Can we sing
[39:40] it again? Can you tell him this morning?
[39:43] He's been faithful.
[39:46] more faithful
[39:50] to me. [singing]
[39:53] Hallelujah.
[39:54] Looking back, [singing]
[39:57] his love and mercy
[40:00] I see. [music and singing]
[40:05] broken my heart.
[40:09] I've had questions, [music] even failed
[40:15] to believe. [singing]
[40:17] Yet, he's been faithful.
[40:21] faithful
[40:23] to me. [singing]
[40:27] Our heavenly father, we thank you, Lord,
[40:29] that when times come in our lives that
[40:33] Lord, there's questions that Satan tries
[40:35] to put in our mind. And Lord, things
[40:38] that come in our heart, emotions move us
[40:40] sometimes. But Lord, you've been
[40:42] faithful. You've been steady. Lord, your
[40:44] promises are true. You've always come
[40:47] through for your people. Lord, you have
[40:49] a perfect track record in watching over
[40:51] your people and sending your word to
[40:54] heal them, sending your word to
[40:56] stabilize them. Lord, we want to thank
[40:58] you this morning. And Lord God, we just
[41:00] pray that you'll come. We invite your
[41:02] presence in this place. Any unfamiliar
[41:05] spirit that's something that's not in
[41:07] harmony with you, [music] we pray,
[41:08] Father, you'll drive it away by your
[41:10] light this morning. God, may you find
[41:13] our hearts open and willing to hear your
[41:15] word this morning.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; [music]
[41:16] &gt;&gt; We commit the service and commit these
[41:18] precious lives into your hands. Lord,
[41:21] may you meet the need of everyone. And
[41:24] Lord, we thank you once again for being
[41:26] faithful through the years. Faithful,
[41:28] Lord, to us, even Lord, at times when we
[41:32] didn't show that as much. We're
[41:34] thankful, Lord, that you were there for
[41:35] us. We pray, Father, you'll bless and
[41:38] anoint and instruct us this morning.
[41:40] Give us encouragement from your word.
[41:42] [music] In Jesus' name we ask it. Amen.
[41:45] and amen. God bless you. You may be
[41:47] seated this morning.
[41:50] We appreciate
[41:53] all of you being with us and
[41:56] been enjoying the services to be able to
[41:59] put forth the word of God. It's one of
[42:01] the greatest privileges that a man could
[42:02] have to be able to feed his sheep. And
[42:06] so we want to do that this morning. I
[42:08] want to speak a little bit more uh on
[42:10] Sarah. And we were talking about the
[42:12] grace that God gave her last Sunday and
[42:14] seeing her slow uh way that she
[42:17] responded. And then this morning, I want
[42:20] to speak a little bit about Sarah
[42:22] finally sees what the prophet sees.
[42:25] Sarah finally sees what the prophet
[42:27] sees. And speaking of seeing something,
[42:30] I'm I've just I've caught a little uh
[42:33] pattern that's in the Bible here that
[42:36] there's a time when believers are called
[42:38] upon to believe God's prophet. And uh
[42:42] first of all, that's a very important
[42:43] thing. You can't begin anywhere unless
[42:47] you believe the servants that he sends.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; If you want a place to begin, it's
[42:52] believing. It's believing the prophet
[42:55] that he sends, believing the word that
[42:57] he sends, believing the word for your
[42:58] day, not a God of history, but what God
[43:01] has sent in your generation. And so I I
[43:05] certainly wouldn't uh belittle the part
[43:08] of believing because everyone starts
[43:10] there. You can't begin anywhere unless
[43:12] you believe Christ. How many believe
[43:15] that?
[43:16] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word made flesh in
[43:18] every generation, in every age. And so
[43:20] to find this living Christ and to find
[43:23] him manifesting himself when he does
[43:25] manifest himself then we of course we we
[43:28] believe that with all of our heart and
[43:30] we trust that uh in most cases Christ
[43:33] was speaking his word through a prophet
[43:35] and though we don't make the prophet
[43:37] Christ we realize that the that's the
[43:40] manner that God chose to bring his word.
[43:42] Christ was revealing himself through
[43:45] speaking through the lips of a prophet.
[43:47] So many times it's related to believing
[43:49] the servant that he sends but also
[43:51] believing the word that he sends in
[43:54] modern times. So we will go nowhere
[43:56] unless we begin to believe. And the the
[43:58] entire message theme song was only
[44:01] believe.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Only believe. All
[44:05] things are possible. Only believe. And I
[44:08] don't think you can come into the
[44:10] channel or cross over into the God of
[44:13] impossibilities. a God that can do the
[44:15] impossible unless you first begin to
[44:18] believe. And it's just simply believing.
[44:20] And then we can cross over into God into
[44:23] a God that all things are possible. We
[44:25] can't get to that until we begin to
[44:28] believe and begin to trust in Christ,
[44:29] his word. But then there are times we
[44:32] see in the Bible that we see Sarah, she
[44:34] she finally seen what the prophet was
[44:37] seeing. And I don't mean that she she I
[44:39] believe that she believed what he said.
[44:41] And it's important we believe the
[44:43] prophet. But there's a difference I'm
[44:45] seeing in the scripture of just
[44:46] believing him. There has to go through
[44:48] something deeper from our lives than
[44:50] just believing that God sent a prophet.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; There has to be go and that happened.
[44:56] Revelation is not something that you
[44:58] just believe something. But the
[45:00] believing goes deeper because you
[45:02] actually see something and you actually
[45:04] see WHAT THE PROPHET IS SEEING. NOW, we
[45:07] know we're not prophets and we don't see
[45:09] a vision like him, but yet by by vision
[45:12] and by uh by the way God brings
[45:14] revelation to his people. Then uh I
[45:17] looked it up one time when I was uh when
[45:19] I was uh younger in the ministry, I
[45:20] looked up vision and there were two
[45:22] meanings for for it. And number one,
[45:24] vision is like a trance and they
[45:25] actually used the word prophet in the
[45:27] definition. A trance or something you go
[45:29] into and we're familiar with that
[45:31] because how a prophet sees a vision and
[45:33] see he's built that way to go into that.
[45:35] The second meaning to vision is one who
[45:37] catches what what has been brought in
[45:39] that vision. He catches it by
[45:41] revelation. And it's just HAS JUST AS
[45:44] MUCH POWER IN IT. WHEN WE CATCH by
[45:46] revelation the same VISION A PROPHET
[45:48] CAUGHT BY A VISION, WE CATCH IT BY
[45:51] REVELATION.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And he brother Brad even says may our
[45:54] young people he says may they catch the
[45:56] vision of the hour. And I think that's
[45:58] important that we all catch a vision.
[46:00] But when she began to see things, she
[46:02] began to see what the prophet seen by
[46:04] revelation because we know it in if
[46:07] Hebrews 11 ev the faith is the evidence
[46:10] of things not seen. So it's things that
[46:13] you have to see. It's something that you
[46:15] see by revelation. Not with these eyes,
[46:17] but it's something that is so visible.
[46:19] It's the evidence of things not seen.
[46:21] It's so convincing that you I YOU SAY,
[46:23] "I SEE IT. I SEE IT." YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
[46:25] PREACH something and teach something for
[46:27] years, maybe to your children or to
[46:29] people in your church. You say things
[46:31] for years and then all of a sudden THEIR
[46:33] EYES ARE OPEN AND THEY EVERYTHING'S
[46:35] SETTLED. I SEE IT. I SEE IT. EVERYTHING
[46:38] GETS BEEN SAID. I SEE WHAT THE MESSAGE
[46:40] IS. And we'll struggle until we get to
[46:43] that point. Thank you for believing it
[46:45] when you don't see it. But you've got to
[46:46] pray. Let me see it like the prophet
[46:49] seen it. LET ME SEE IT THE way I'm
[46:51] supposed to see it.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, so now we we we
[46:55] find Sarah when she when she uh found
[46:58] this then she received supernatural
[47:01] strength. She received strength then in
[47:03] order to bring forth the promised it
[47:06] it's not just the prophet now seeing it.
[47:09] It's not just Abraham seeing it but
[47:11] Sarah herself. That's why I love how
[47:13] it's worded in verse 11. Through faith
[47:15] also Sarah herself. So it's not just the
[47:19] prophet sees it. IT'S NOT JUST THE
[47:21] PASTORS see it, BUT SARAH HERSELF A type
[47:24] of the bride. Sarah herself. You you
[47:27] have TO SAY THAT I CAUGHT IT FOR MYSELF.
[47:29] IT HAS TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL AFFAIR.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; And Sarah herself for years uh the the
[47:37] prophet seen it and Abraham seen it for
[47:39] many years. But Sarah was slow coming to
[47:41] it. And I believe that there's a move of
[47:44] God going on. There's a stir going on
[47:47] even within our ranks is that it is so
[47:50] important that WE CATCH WHAT THE
[47:51] PROPHET'S SEEN BECAUSE we can read it
[47:54] all day long. But it's important we
[47:56] CATCH WHAT HE'S SEEN. I find that IF
[47:58] PEOPLE DON'T CATCH WHAT HE'S SEEING AND
[48:00] HOW HE'S BRINGING it and the reason he's
[48:01] bringing because of what he sees, then
[48:03] we can make a mess of this message.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Our divisions AND OUR FALSE DOCTRINES
[48:09] AND ALL THIS IS, YOU KNOW WHAT IT REALLY
[48:11] COMES DOWN TO? we're not seeing it
[48:13] through the same eyes of a prophet. And
[48:15] when we don't do that, then we'll
[48:17] interpret it ourselves as what we think
[48:20] it means.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; And that's a tragic thing. So, how
[48:24] important is it then that we see and I
[48:27] believe there's a real move of God going
[48:28] on that this is more than just God sent
[48:31] a prophet. This is more than just
[48:33] preaching God sent a prophet. This is
[48:35] more than just saying I'm good because
[48:36] I'm a part of a message church. You
[48:38] better make sure that message church is
[48:40] preaching the full revelation
[48:44] &gt;&gt; and not some slant or not taking us back
[48:46] to Pentecost or not some type of thing
[48:48] that that brings sometime as long as you
[48:50] believe God said prophet YOU'RE GOOD.
[48:52] NO, WE'VE GOT TO PRE HEAR THE WHOLE
[48:54] COUNCIL OF GOD AND SAY LORD GIVE ME A
[48:56] REVELATION THAT MY EYES ARE OPEN TO SEE
[48:58] THIS.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; You say I've been HERE FOR YEARS. THAT'S
[49:01] NOT THE QUESTION. HOW MANY YEARS YOU'VE
[49:02] BEEN HERE? I'M IN THE MESSAGE. I BELIEVE
[49:04] GOD SENT A PROPHET. THAT'S NOT THE
[49:06] QUESTION ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU see
[49:08] &gt;&gt; this message is being?
[49:11] &gt;&gt; There's a move of God going on. Can you
[49:13] say amen?
[49:14] &gt;&gt; And I I believe there's a stir in the
[49:16] hearts of the people. I don't want to go
[49:17] back to something in the past. I don't
[49:20] want to just be uh presuming. Can you
[49:22] say amen? But I I want to see this. And
[49:25] that's the thing about Sarah. She not
[49:27] only seen the word for the day, but
[49:29] she's seen her identity. SHE'S SEEN WHAT
[49:32] GOD THOUGHT of her in the promise.
[49:36] She's seen it.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; She's seen what God thought of her in
[49:40] the promise, not just what he thought of
[49:42] Abraham, the prophet, but she's seen
[49:45] what God thought of her. We'll get into
[49:47] that just a little bit more in a minute.
[49:49] So, you know, the revealing of the son
[49:51] of man is not just one man. It is
[49:54] husband and wife. And one place, brother
[49:56] Brandham actually mentions, he mentions
[49:58] that son of man, we were in the time of
[50:00] son of God, the holy spirit. We go
[50:02] through a time of a son of David in the
[50:04] millennium. And so it's the same God
[50:06] coming in different offices, but he said
[50:08] now that we're in the time of son of
[50:09] man, we were 2,000 years ago and then
[50:12] Jesus prophesied in the revealing of the
[50:14] son of man, the end time, we have find
[50:16] that's taken place in our day. But one
[50:18] place he says husband and wife. So it's
[50:21] not just a one-man ministry, the son of
[50:23] man in the 2,000 years ago when the son
[50:26] of man was manifested the way that he
[50:28] was in that day, then it broke off after
[50:32] he left. it it didn't stop. THE SON OF
[50:35] MAN BROKE INTO A MANY MEMBERED BODY
[50:37] [screaming and cheering]
[50:39] &gt;&gt; BAPTIZED BY HIS SPIRIT. CAN YOU SAY
[50:41] AMEN?
[50:42] &gt;&gt; SO IF THAT'S THE PATTERN OF THE SON OF
[50:44] MAN THAT IF WE'VE HAD A REPEAT TODAY,
[50:46] IT'S NOT A ONE-MAN MINISTRY. IT'S NOT
[50:49] JUST ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM AND IT'S NOT
[50:51] JUST ABOUT JUST THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY,
[50:54] BUT THAT SON OF MAN BREAKS INTO THE
[50:56] BRIDE, A MEME member bride.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ONE MAN. AND WHEN WE
[51:01] LIFT UP ONE MAN, SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL
[51:03] DOING IT. YOU'RE MISSING THE REVELATION
[51:06] OF WHAT THIS SON OF man is.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; I don't CARE HOW BIG THE PREACHER THINKS
[51:10] HE IS OR THE PEOPLE LIFT HIM UP. YOU ARE
[51:13] MISSING THE REVELATION. CAN I SAY IT?
[51:16] YOU'RE MISSING WHAT THE SON OF MAN IS.
[51:18] IT BEGINS AS ONE man and then it ends in
[51:21] a many membered body.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; The same son of man.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; And that's why he had to give Sarah that
[51:27] revelation because she's part of the
[51:28] promise.
[51:30] It wasn't just good enough for Abra. Oh,
[51:32] she's good enough for Abraham. No, she
[51:33] had to see it herself.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, now there's a trans
[51:38] transition taking place that I think not
[51:41] too many people make, but they need to
[51:43] make it. And that's from believing to
[51:45] really seeing what this is and seeing
[51:48] your identity in it. God was trying to
[51:51] show Sher Sarah who she was. She was
[51:54] part of the promise. And then she
[51:56] finally sees herself as God sees her.
[52:00] What a revelation.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; She sees herself as God sees her as part
[52:05] of the promise. This is not going to
[52:07] come through Hagar. And and so I I just
[52:10] I I think it's a little bit humorous
[52:12] sometimes when you look at Sarah and
[52:15] last Sunday we talked about when the
[52:17] three angels came and she actually
[52:19] laughed in her heart. She had sarcasm in
[52:21] her heart. That sarcasm had grew because
[52:24] Abraham had been telling her this
[52:25] promised all these years. She had, you
[52:28] know, before those three angels came,
[52:30] one day Abraham comes in and says, "Hey,
[52:33] Sarah." And she goes, "Why why are you
[52:36] calling me Sarah? My name is Sarai. You
[52:40] know that we've been married for teen
[52:42] years.
[52:44] Why did you just call me Sarah?" He
[52:45] said, "Well, I met the Lord and he's
[52:47] changed our names. He changed my name
[52:50] from Abraham to Abraham and she's he's
[52:52] changed your name by the way. So you got
[52:54] to you got to remember now she's not
[52:56] she's not on board. She doesn't believe
[52:58] yet. It took her years to come into this
[53:01] revelation.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; So all these weird strange things are
[53:04] coming from her old husband and if she
[53:07] had sarcastic thoughts in front of the
[53:10] angel. I was wondering last night what
[53:13] kind of thoughts were going on when he
[53:15] says, "I just met God and your name has
[53:18] been changed."
[53:20] &gt;&gt; From Sarai to Sarah.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; I just wonder she's thinking, you know,
[53:25] and I love old people. I really do.
[53:28] [laughter]
[53:29] You know, my husband, you know, it's not
[53:31] what she said verbally, but you know,
[53:32] he's he's kind of getting old here. He's
[53:36] off his rocker a little bit. He's a few
[53:38] fries short of a happy meal.
[53:42] you know, the the lights are on, but
[53:44] nobody's home or something. If she was
[53:46] sarcastic towards, you know, so she's
[53:48] thinking, you know, I love to and I
[53:50] don't know what to do, but okay, Abra
[53:53] Abraham, if that's what you want to call
[53:55] me, you know, it sounds a little crazy.
[53:57] And she if she laughed in her heart
[53:59] before Lord before the Lord, she's
[54:01] wondering about all these strange
[54:03] things. And she she didn't catch it. Uh
[54:06] even when God changed the name and all
[54:10] you believers should know this that the
[54:12] reason God changed their name is the
[54:14] Jewish interpreter said that Yahweh
[54:17] added the H from his name to Abram's
[54:23] name.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If this doesn't make me
[54:26] shout, I'LL BE SURPRISED. YAHWEH HAD to
[54:29] add the H from his name to Abram's TO
[54:33] GIVE A SHARE IN HIS CREATIVE POWER.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Why did Abraham need THIS POWER? BECAUSE
[54:42] HE AND HIS WIFE SARAI, WHOSE NAME GOD
[54:46] ALSO CHANGED TO SARAH BY ADDING AN H,
[54:49] HAD TO ADD THAT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE A
[54:51] PART OF THIS CREATIVE PLAN TO BRING
[54:54] FORTH THE PROMISE OF GOD. I'M GOING TO
[54:56] TAKE MOVE YOUR NAME, PUT MY NAME IN
[54:58] THERE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO PARTICIPATE
[55:00] IN THE CREATIVE POWER OF GOD. I SAY
[55:02] HALLELUJAH. GOD CHANGES OUR NAME. MAYBE
[55:05] NOT PHYSICALLY, BUT THE BRIDE HAS A NEW
[55:07] NAME.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; CAN SOMEBODY SAY AMEN? THE BRIDE HAS A
[55:11] NEW NAME.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; And it's because she's participating in
[55:14] the promise of God.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Put my name in there. Sarah didn't catch
[55:19] it. She didn't catch what was going on.
[55:22] But later on, I thank God. And I'll read
[55:24] the same quote I led to read to you last
[55:25] Sunday. But remember when Sarah first
[55:28] heard that man when she is a type of the
[55:30] church when she heard that seen that
[55:32] sign take place to Abraham, she actually
[55:34] laughed about it in her heart and she
[55:36] disbelieved and doubted it ever being.
[55:38] So is that right? At that time God would
[55:41] have rubbed her name off. That's right.
[55:43] BUT HE COULDN'T. SHE'S PART OF ABRAHAM.
[55:46] THEY are one. And if you've really NOT
[55:49] BEEN EXCITED, NOT WORKED UP IN AN
[55:51] EMOTION, NOT GOT SOME CHURCH CREED, BUT
[55:54] REALLY RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST and
[55:57] you're really part of Christ, LISTEN
[55:59] NOW. AND STILL A LITTLE SKEPTIC IN YOUR
[56:02] MIND.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Interesting way TO SAY THAT.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL NOT SHOVE YOU OFF FROM THAT
[56:09] BECAUSE HE CAN'T. YOU'RE A PART OF
[56:12] CHRIST. HE'LL BRING YOU TO TRUTH.
[56:15] [applause]
[56:19] Wish I had the whole quote there. I read
[56:20] it to you last Sunday. It was amazing.
[56:22] He says, "I'm looking out at this
[56:23] crowd." He says, "I can see you're
[56:25] disbelieving right now. I can see that
[56:27] you're resisting this right now." He
[56:29] says, "But let me give you a little spot
[56:30] of grace for a minute." He said, "I can
[56:32] see beyond that."
[56:35] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching. We have to say
[56:37] see THINGS THE WAY A PROPHET SEES IT. I
[56:40] CAN SEE BEYOND THAT RESISTANCE, THAT
[56:42] REBELLION, THAT DISBELIEF. LISTEN, if we
[56:44] have PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES, DON'T WRITE
[56:46] THEM OFF. DON'T PUT THEM IN A CATEGORY
[56:48] JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE DISBELIEVING. OH,
[56:50] THEY LEFT THE MESSAGE. DON'T WE DON'T
[56:52] HAVE A RIGHT TO TO TO DUMP ANYBODY OUT.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; IF THEY'RE A CHILD [screaming] OF GOD,
[56:56] THAT PROPHET VISION COULD LOOK, HE SAYS,
[56:59] I'M LOOKING BEYOND WHAT YOUR RESISTANCE
[57:00] IS. AND I CAN SEE YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT
[57:03] THE TRUTH SOMEDAY. [cheering]
[57:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Why am I preaching this? Because we need
[57:09] to look at people the way God looks as
[57:12] sons and daughters of God.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And we have no right and we don't know
[57:17] what's in a person's heart.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW REBELLIOUS they are, we
[57:22] have no right to tell who's
[57:24] predestinated and who's not.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord. And I just love the
[57:34] grace part. What grace is this? And even
[57:37] a man that has the Holy Ghost, just
[57:39] still a little skeptic, God will not
[57:42] shove you off because he can't. You're
[57:44] part of Christ. He'll bring you to the
[57:46] truth.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for the grace of God in my
[57:49] life.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; How many times I presented a a way that
[57:52] God should have shoved me off and he
[57:54] didn't do it. He didn't do it with you.
[57:56] You ought to raise your hands this
[57:57] morning. Say, "Thank you, Lord. You
[57:59] didn't shove me off.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for that measure of
[58:02] grace in my life when I didn't deserve
[58:05] it." That's grace, unmmerited favor. So,
[58:07] she finally sees
[58:10] what the prophet seen.
[58:12] And until she did, God gave grace to her
[58:15] until she seen what the prophet seen.
[58:18] Now, I'd like to bring in this morning,
[58:20] it might be a little strange, but I I
[58:22] know why I'm bringing in just for a
[58:23] short time. We know that there were four
[58:26] anointings that God sent to the church
[58:29] for them to be able to combat the
[58:31] particular antichrist spirit for their
[58:33] age. God set four anointings and he
[58:36] symbolized them as we knew. He
[58:38] symbolized the the different phases of
[58:40] the antichrist spirit in four horse
[58:42] riders. The white horse, the red horse,
[58:44] the black horse, and the pale horse.
[58:47] These were different ways that the
[58:48] antichrist would come and come upon not
[58:52] the world to come against the people of
[58:54] God. Could come against the work of God.
[58:57] But God in his grace sended a special
[59:00] anointing through the Holy Ghost. Now we
[59:03] know it's the Holy Ghost throughout the
[59:04] ages. But he sent that Holy Ghost with a
[59:07] particular anointing for the people if
[59:10] they will come in contact with it. This
[59:12] they have the thing that they need. The
[59:15] only thing that they would have to have
[59:17] IS TO HAVE THAT ANOINTING TO combat that
[59:21] particular antichrist spirit for that
[59:23] hour.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; That's God's grace as well.
[59:27] And so we know it was symbolized then in
[59:29] the anointings as a lion anointing, an
[59:32] ox anointing, a man anointing, and an
[59:34] eagle anointing. And we find them back
[59:36] in the Old Testament. And then it's it's
[59:38] brought in under the revelation of today
[59:40] as we see those anointings, it's brought
[59:42] in as those symbolisms are there. And th
[59:44] those who are taught and read those
[59:46] things, you understand it. But what I
[59:47] want to bring it to is in the last days,
[59:50] we have received an eagle anointing.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; It's a different anointing.
[59:56] We are not under the anointing of the
[59:58] ages before. We're under the same Holy
[1:00:01] Ghost, but we're under a specific eagle
[1:00:04] anointing.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; The eagle uh uh well, let me just say
[1:00:10] this first. We must work with the
[1:00:12] anointing that God has sent us.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Or we not we will not be able to
[1:00:17] overcome in the last days because the
[1:00:20] people of God can only function
[1:00:21] according to the anointing God gave
[1:00:23] them.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:00:26] News flash, we're not under the lion
[1:00:29] anointing or the ox anointing or even
[1:00:32] the man anointing any anymore.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; We have moved to the eagle anointing. I
[1:00:38] got a few quotes to to remind you of
[1:00:40] about this. The martyrs down through the
[1:00:41] ages there suffered terribly. But what
[1:00:44] was they? They were under the
[1:00:46] inspiration, the spirit of God, the
[1:00:48] power. Don't forget this church and you
[1:00:50] brethren on tape. I want you to examine
[1:00:52] this. How could men do anything except
[1:00:56] besides the power of God that had been
[1:00:58] released to them? I'm going to set this
[1:01:01] box up here to represent if God sends a
[1:01:03] certain spirit among them, that's the
[1:01:05] only thing that they can work by is the
[1:01:08] spirit that works among them. Now, we'll
[1:01:11] prove it to you by the history of the
[1:01:12] church by the opening of the seals and
[1:01:14] the powers that let loose. And watch
[1:01:16] exactly. THE CHURCH RESPONDED TO the
[1:01:19] anointing and THEY COULDN'T DO NOTHING
[1:01:22] ELSE. NOW, HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR US
[1:01:24] TO COME UNDER THE ANOINTING THAT WE'RE
[1:01:27] UNDER IN THIS HOUR? It is an eagle
[1:01:29] anointing. That means an eagle flies
[1:01:31] higher. An ox is an earthly animal. Man
[1:01:35] is an earthly creature.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; LION IS AN EARTHLY. SO, YOU'RE ONLY
[1:01:39] GOING TO SEE THINGS A certain way. But
[1:01:42] when he sends THE EAGLE ANOINTING AT THE
[1:01:44] LAST DAYS, he's lifting our eyesight.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Can I have an AMEN THIS MORNING? HE'S
[1:01:51] LETTING US SEE WHAT OTHERS CAN'T SEE.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; He's letting us SEE WITH THAT ANOINTING.
[1:01:57] AND THAT WILL BE THE ANOINTING IS THE
[1:01:59] EYESIGHT TO SEE FROM THE VIEW OF AN
[1:02:01] eagle anointing. That will be the
[1:02:03] anointing.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; IT WON'T BE A FEELING ON YOUR FLESH. IT
[1:02:06] WON'T JUST BE SPEAKING IN TONGUES. IT
[1:02:09] WON'T BE JUST SOME MAN ANOINTING OR
[1:02:10] SOMETHING TO THE PAST. WE'LL HAVE ALL OF
[1:02:12] THAT EXCEPT FOR WE NEED THE EAGLE
[1:02:15] ANOINTING TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THE
[1:02:18] SPIRITS OF THIS HOUR.
[1:02:20] I tell you, it takes more than a feeling
[1:02:22] or a sensation to come against the
[1:02:24] devil's we're against.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's subtle. It's sly. The Antichrist
[1:02:29] spirit is even coming in our own ranks.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Listen. It's my church. I
[1:02:34] can preach it the way I want. I guess
[1:02:36] that Antichrist spirit is not good
[1:02:38] enough. Some sign over the door that has
[1:02:40] a denomin. No, he wants to come in in
[1:02:42] all the churches. And he definitely
[1:02:44] wants to come near where the truth is
[1:02:46] being preached and bring those little
[1:02:48] denominational traits and those little
[1:02:50] things and that antichrist SPIRIT. HE
[1:02:52] WANTS TO BRING IT EVEN TO DIVIDE US.
[1:02:55] HE'LL DO IT. HE'S NOT GOING TO THE
[1:02:56] WORLD. HE'S TRYING TO COME IN. WE HAVE
[1:02:58] TO HAVE EYESIGHT.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO SEE THIS LIKE GOD SEES IT.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; We can't say, "Oh, oh, just God will
[1:03:06] take care of it." No, we want his
[1:03:07] eyesight. We want this anointing
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; to be able to lift far above and see
[1:03:13] things the way that God sees them
[1:03:16] through this eagle anointing. He goes on
[1:03:18] to say in what shall I do with Jesus
[1:03:20] called Christ? He is thoroughly a
[1:03:21] vindicated. He is thoroughly identified.
[1:03:23] The word of this hour, the promise of
[1:03:25] this hour, not the promise of Luther's
[1:03:27] hour. That was then. That was the word
[1:03:29] in the reformation's age. And as you
[1:03:31] have heard the seven seals when the
[1:03:33] reformers age went out the beast with a
[1:03:36] face like a man organization issued. But
[1:03:38] this is the face of the eagle. The
[1:03:40] beasts that went to make the challenge
[1:03:43] today goes on to say in the Easter seal
[1:03:46] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:03:48] it be in the coming of the son of man.
[1:03:49] They were eating drinking and marrying
[1:03:51] and giving in marriage. As it was in the
[1:03:53] days of Lot, so will it be in the hours
[1:03:55] that the son of man will be revealed on
[1:03:56] earth. Not son of God no more. Son of
[1:03:59] man, come back as the prophetic message
[1:04:01] for the last day when that eagle will be
[1:04:03] flying. Not the lion, not the ox of the
[1:04:07] sacrifice age. And you realize the
[1:04:09] reason people could stand in the in the
[1:04:12] time of the red horse rider and be
[1:04:14] actually slayed, actually cut aunder,
[1:04:18] THEIR HEADS CUT OFF, STAND THERE AND NOT
[1:04:21] DENY CHRIST. HOW DO YOU NO human being
[1:04:25] could be able to do that on THEIR OWN.
[1:04:26] THEY WERE UNDER THE OX ANOINTING, THE
[1:04:29] SACRIFICIAL ANOINTING. AND THE ONLY WAY
[1:04:32] THAT THEY OVERCOME WAS THROUGH THE
[1:04:34] ANOINTING.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; If that was true back then, it's true
[1:04:38] today.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; You're not going to get by with just a
[1:04:41] man anointing today.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, let me be under the this
[1:04:46] Holy Ghost anointing for this hour.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; They only survive. They only overcome
[1:04:53] based upon that. And he goes on, let me
[1:04:55] finish this quote. Every time, excuse me
[1:04:58] now, not but the message of the last day
[1:05:00] when the eagle will be flying, not uh
[1:05:03] not the lion, not the ox of the sacri
[1:05:05] every time a religious power went forth
[1:05:07] to meet the challenge of the political
[1:05:09] power of the world. When the lion raised
[1:05:11] up the religious power, it went to meet
[1:05:12] the Roman power. And when they when come
[1:05:15] the sacrifice hour, the ox went because
[1:05:17] he's the sacrifice beast of the word.
[1:05:19] Then come the reformers down through the
[1:05:22] church ages. come to the face of a man
[1:05:25] and the reformers had been since Luther
[1:05:28] Wesley and Calvin on down Pentecostal
[1:05:32] age. So if you don't understand the man
[1:05:34] anointing was in Luther's day and
[1:05:36] Wesley's day and and the Pentecostal
[1:05:39] day.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; They were still under a man anointing
[1:05:44] until the word was open to us by the
[1:05:47] seven seals being open. Until the word
[1:05:49] was open, we didn't have the eagle
[1:05:51] anointing.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The eagle anointing was NOT
[1:05:54] PENTECOST. WOO! FLY ABOVE. THIS IS THE
[1:05:57] EAGLE AGE. NO, NO, NO. IT had so much
[1:05:59] deeper meaning than that.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; But the Pentecost and Luther, they had
[1:06:03] debates back in Luther Luther's day,
[1:06:05] Calvin's day. They had great debates of
[1:06:07] the scripture. God putting anointing on
[1:06:09] man to be able to debate and debate
[1:06:12] doctrine and to settle things and to be
[1:06:14] able to bring that in a real debating
[1:06:17] way. That's why it's hard intellectually
[1:06:19] to go up against a real studied person
[1:06:22] of the scripture from seminary.
[1:06:24] Sometimes if you try to combat them with
[1:06:26] just your mind, you might lose.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; I won't ask for a show of hands, but
[1:06:32] some of you have lost arguments.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they're under a
[1:06:37] certain anointing that this will solve
[1:06:39] it. If I just go to seminary or learn
[1:06:41] enough of this, I can tie people in
[1:06:43] knots with this. And I'm right.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:06:49] But we have a deeper anointing than
[1:06:50] that.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; It's eyes to see.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; It's seeing like the ego. It's seeing
[1:06:56] like a prophet sees things, not as man
[1:06:59] sees it.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; You try to take a man anointing and go
[1:07:03] up against just a man and go up against
[1:07:06] what we're going up against today. it
[1:07:08] won't necessarily have the power with it
[1:07:11] because God has sent us another
[1:07:13] anointing that's deeper for the more
[1:07:16] subtle works of the antichrist that we
[1:07:19] have working among us today.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, let me finish this.
[1:07:24] Then when the reformers down through the
[1:07:26] ages come to a face of a man and the
[1:07:28] reformers have been since Luther,
[1:07:29] Wesley, and Calvin, I'm certainly not
[1:07:31] those who are listening online and those
[1:07:33] who are listening maybe on the
[1:07:34] broadcast. Listen, I'm certainly not
[1:07:36] belittling the the godly men of God
[1:07:39] throughout the ages that had Christ and
[1:07:41] preached, sacrificed, lived the life
[1:07:44] under their anointing. They were men of
[1:07:47] God.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And I quote from some of them and I
[1:07:50] acknowledge them. I never believe the
[1:07:52] Christ that they had. BUT I CANNOT GO
[1:07:55] BACK AND LIVE UNDER THAT anointing and
[1:07:58] make it work for today. I MUST RECOGNIZE
[1:08:00] THAT GOD HAS SENT US AN EAGLE ANOINTING
[1:08:03] AND I must see things deeper than just a
[1:08:06] man anointing.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; The last message that went forth there
[1:08:10] come a flying eagle. It's eagle time,
[1:08:13] revealed time. The word of God made
[1:08:15] manifest the word of God proved. It is
[1:08:19] eagle time.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; What's my pastor doing this morning?
[1:08:24] Well, I'm not going to hand out eagle
[1:08:25] belt buckles. That's for sure.
[1:08:28] I'm not emphasizing some symbolism
[1:08:30] because that's another cultist thing.
[1:08:32] It's just they have the symbolism.
[1:08:34] Symbolism over substance. I don't want
[1:08:35] the symbolism. I want the substance.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And I just say this is that it's a
[1:08:40] beautiful thing to have a picture of the
[1:08:41] pillar of fire, but I would rather have
[1:08:43] the pillar of fire working amongst his
[1:08:45] people than have a picture of it.
[1:08:47] [applause]
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; I believe in the cloud. We don't have a
[1:08:51] huge amount of pictures of that. I've
[1:08:52] got one. But you see now, I don't
[1:08:54] emphasize that was a sign for the end
[1:08:56] time of what God was doing. I don't make
[1:08:58] that a symbol that I'm in the rapture.
[1:09:00] No, I don't want to just see that's our
[1:09:02] Lord up there and I want to see that
[1:09:04] Lord that's in that picture working
[1:09:06] among his people every Sunday, every
[1:09:08] day.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; I don't need a picture. I NEED THE
[1:09:12] SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THAT IS.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; So I want to make it clear in history
[1:09:21] now. They could not combat the spirit of
[1:09:24] their age outside of the anointing God
[1:09:26] sent. We are not even under a
[1:09:29] Pentecostal anointing, a man anointing.
[1:09:32] What spirit is it that takes us back to
[1:09:34] that?
[1:09:38] What kind of influence is the spirit
[1:09:41] that would take us back to the the
[1:09:43] traditions and the the the mannerisms
[1:09:47] and all of the things to try to take us
[1:09:49] back and say that's the thing that we're
[1:09:51] missing and that's the thing that we
[1:09:53] need. We've got to go back to that
[1:09:55] because that's what we've fallen away
[1:09:56] from. No, the church is not falling
[1:09:59] away. She's actually growing higher and
[1:10:02] deeper in the word if she'll follow the
[1:10:04] word. If she don't follow the word,
[1:10:05] she'll fall back.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; But but listen, I am right really
[1:10:09] concerned with something, some influence
[1:10:11] that wants us to take us back under a a
[1:10:14] man or a Pentecostal anointing.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; I hope I don't offend anybody today, but
[1:10:20] but I'm concerned and you should be
[1:10:21] concerned of that. You should pray and
[1:10:23] say, "Lord, Lord, I I want to know what
[1:10:26] you have sent us in this hour, the full
[1:10:28] impact of what you've sent us, and I
[1:10:30] want to be living in that every day. I
[1:10:32] want my eyes to be open and I WANT TO BE
[1:10:34] LIKE SARAH. I WANT TO SEE IT AND I WANT
[1:10:36] TO RECEIVE STRENGTH THAT I NEED IN THIS
[1:10:39] hour
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; for what you've sent. So we respect you
[1:10:45] know uh let me just move on here. I've
[1:10:47] got a lot but uh you know we need
[1:10:50] eyesight and when we see eyesight like
[1:10:51] Sarah we see our identity what God's
[1:10:53] thoughts are of us. Can you say amen?
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You'll never meet the challenges today
[1:10:58] with an anointing from the past.
[1:11:02] God's word moves.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; For our visitors here who may not see
[1:11:07] the pattern or something, I just step
[1:11:09] back and just explain this a little bit.
[1:11:11] In the Old Testament, when they had the
[1:11:13] tabernacle and the tent and they put it
[1:11:15] up, they built it, put it up so they
[1:11:17] could meet God and that's where the word
[1:11:19] was. That's where they met God.
[1:11:21] And then when the pillar of fire and the
[1:11:24] cloud when it began to move, the people
[1:11:26] says time to move. So they'd pull up the
[1:11:28] stakes and they moved according to where
[1:11:31] that pillar of fire was moving and they
[1:11:33] moved everything and then they set the
[1:11:34] tent in the place wherever that stopped.
[1:11:36] That shows a pattern in the scripture.
[1:11:38] We have to move when the Lord is moving.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; We can't stay back in some
[1:11:44] denominational system or some
[1:11:46] denominational understanding of the
[1:11:48] word. I respect and I could as I said
[1:11:51] last Sunday, listen, I said I didn't say
[1:11:53] it. The prophet said if if we're under
[1:11:55] the the the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:11:57] that man believes that I can shake his
[1:11:59] hand and call him brother. That's in God
[1:12:01] in simplicity at the beginning of the
[1:12:02] seals.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And I don't think that changed after the
[1:12:05] seals.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; I can shake his hand and call him
[1:12:09] brother if he believes in the blood of
[1:12:11] Jesus Christ. That's it. But listen, I
[1:12:14] hope you didn't misunderstand me. We can
[1:12:16] shake hands and be a brother and respect
[1:12:19] anyone. But to shake hands and join the
[1:12:22] hands of fellowship with a
[1:12:24] denominational system, that's where I
[1:12:27] draw the line.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; I don't have a right to draw my line on
[1:12:30] the the love of God, the brotherhood. I
[1:12:33] should hold that in my heart. But
[1:12:35] listen, I'm not going to join hands with
[1:12:36] fellowship. That's something that's
[1:12:37] going to influence me to take me to the
[1:12:39] past. The pillar of fire is moving. You
[1:12:41] got to move with the pillar of fire.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You got to move where God moves. So that
[1:12:45] same pillar of fire that moved that 10
[1:12:47] in the Old Testament. Is it okay if I
[1:12:48] just explain this? That same pillar of
[1:12:51] fire now coming in the New Testament
[1:12:53] when the the church was destroyed by
[1:12:55] denominational systems when they had a
[1:12:57] conference at NASA and split God into
[1:13:00] three persons and all this began to
[1:13:02] happen. The church began to be affected
[1:13:03] by it and by by the time that the end of
[1:13:06] that we come to a thing called all
[1:13:07] historians called the dark ages. Why was
[1:13:09] it dark? THERE WAS HARDLY ANY LIGHT. The
[1:13:11] the the church had taken our Bibles
[1:13:13] away. They had IT'S LIKE JEZEBEL. SHE
[1:13:16] CUT OFF ALL THE PROPHETS OF GOD.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A JEZEBEL SPIRIT THAT COME IN THE
[1:13:21] FALSE CHURCH AND CUT OFF ALL THE GODLY
[1:13:23] MEN. CUT THE WORD OUT OF THEIR LIVES.
[1:13:25] WHEN you cut THE WORD, YOU CUT THE
[1:13:26] LIGHT.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; So people lived in the dark ages. And
[1:13:31] then God said, "I will restore." He
[1:13:33] begins to move in Luther through
[1:13:34] justification. The purifier moved in
[1:13:37] him. The piper moved the church from
[1:13:38] Lutheranism to from Luther to Wesley.
[1:13:42] And that was a further revelation of the
[1:13:44] word. And if you didn't move with that,
[1:13:46] THEN YOU DRIED UP AND DIED under that
[1:13:49] Luther's message.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I'm talking collectively now. You if you
[1:13:56] didn't move, there's a lot of people
[1:13:57] said, "No, we're going to put a period
[1:13:59] on this. We're staying. This is we are
[1:14:01] now Lutheran
[1:14:04] and still go on today. I'll shake hands
[1:14:06] and be brother with anybody. But if you
[1:14:08] tie to the system that holds you back
[1:14:09] from moving on,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; that's where that's where we have to
[1:14:13] disagree because it moved to Wesley
[1:14:15] sanctification. Then it didn't stay
[1:14:18] there. The purifier moved into
[1:14:19] Pentecostal restoration of the gifts.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And if you stayed in Wesleyanism,
[1:14:25] you dried up and died because why? The
[1:14:27] word was moving to more restoration.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And then there was another move of God.
[1:14:34] Now there was a the same Leodysian age
[1:14:36] where both of these things take place.
[1:14:38] But there was another moving that you
[1:14:40] had to move with and that is out of all
[1:14:42] the systems once again because Pentecost
[1:14:45] had become systems instead of the purity
[1:14:48] it had at the beginning it had become
[1:14:50] systems.
[1:14:52] Where did they get you? Excuse me. Those
[1:14:54] who know these things just act like you
[1:14:56] don't know them right now.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that our our
[1:15:00] children even understand where we're at.
[1:15:03] you understand is that this is a move of
[1:15:05] God. This is the pillar of fire moving.
[1:15:06] If we we have to follow where God's
[1:15:08] moving.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; That's why so many people if they don't
[1:15:11] understand this, they go back. They go
[1:15:12] back to that. SAY THAT'S NO. NO, WE'RE
[1:15:14] NOT GOING BACKWARDS to that. We can be
[1:15:16] brothers with anybody, but we're not
[1:15:18] going back to that. So the word moves
[1:15:19] us. And if we'd have stayed in
[1:15:21] Westianism, we'd have dried up and died
[1:15:23] being tied to that system because what
[1:15:25] the word moved out of there and begin to
[1:15:27] take us further. Then it comes in
[1:15:29] Pentecost. And guess what? Then they
[1:15:31] dried up in denominational systems.
[1:15:35] They dried up because why? There was
[1:15:37] another moving to another anointing, an
[1:15:40] eagle anointing.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; If you don't move with the word
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; even this morning,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; God's showing you something. You need to
[1:15:49] trust him enough to say, "I'm moving
[1:15:52] where the word's moving me."
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; You don't need a picture of the pillar
[1:15:56] of fire. You need to say, 'Lord, what's
[1:15:58] the pillar of fire burning in my heart
[1:15:59] right now?
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; How is he moving my heart closer to the
[1:16:03] word of God?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; All those in the book of Revelation are
[1:16:06] called daughters, not the people, but
[1:16:08] the systems of denomination come from
[1:16:11] the mother system. The first organized
[1:16:13] system, just don't be offended. Now, the
[1:16:16] first organized system was the Catholic
[1:16:19] Church.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; They call themselves the original
[1:16:23] church. They're not the original church.
[1:16:25] The original church was in the day of
[1:16:26] Pentecost.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Attached themselves to the original
[1:16:30] church. Attached Peter as the first pope
[1:16:33] who wasn't even in Rome.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Develop denominations and split God into
[1:16:38] three persons. This is a serious thing.
[1:16:40] It's like what's going on here. This is
[1:16:42] the mystery. I'm preaching to you. The
[1:16:44] mystery behind church history
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; that there's a true church and there's a
[1:16:48] false church that looked every bit close
[1:16:50] as the true thing.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Nicicoatan spirit. read your Bible. It's
[1:16:55] in the book of Revelations. It's all
[1:16:56] there.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; So, she was the first system. And then
[1:16:59] as the restoration come along, then
[1:17:01] Satan said, "Well, I'll do this again."
[1:17:03] And systems, not the people, but systems
[1:17:06] of denomination. The daughters in
[1:17:08] Revelation is called the daughters of
[1:17:09] the mother of harlots. That's what the
[1:17:11] Bible calls it. I didn't. The Bible said
[1:17:13] it. This a serious thing. Why did he say
[1:17:15] the mother of harlots? Because it's a
[1:17:17] woman. A woman types the church in the
[1:17:18] Bible. This is the type of the church,
[1:17:20] but a false church.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; A false system.
[1:17:24] So we realize that when that type of
[1:17:27] denominational slant comes up in
[1:17:32] other churches and they set up their
[1:17:34] system just like the mother set up their
[1:17:36] system. And really in a nutshell what it
[1:17:39] is is that they take their Bibles and
[1:17:41] they decide what they believe and they
[1:17:44] put a period on God and say this is our
[1:17:47] church belief. We'll put it in writing
[1:17:49] and this is it. And we don't go back. We
[1:17:52] don't go beyond. We're staying right
[1:17:54] here. And that's what denominational
[1:17:56] systems do.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; And if they're staying there, the people
[1:18:00] are staying there.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Never move beyond it. Never grow beyond
[1:18:05] it. So that's a serious thing when you
[1:18:08] got a restoration of God going back to
[1:18:10] the life and back to the real thing,
[1:18:12] back to a people being set free from
[1:18:15] denominational systems and you got Satan
[1:18:18] that jumps right in to bind the people
[1:18:20] up again. Today we're full of about
[1:18:22] 35,000 different denominations, not
[1:18:25] other religions. 35 different
[1:18:27] denominations within Christianity. And
[1:18:30] most all of them think they're right.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Well, they're not right. And we're not
[1:18:34] right.
[1:18:36] [laughter]
[1:18:39] Everyone say they're right. There's no
[1:18:41] church right. The word is right.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; The word is right.
[1:18:44] [applause and cheering]
[1:18:46] Can you say amen?
[1:18:48] that that kind of rubs our message skin
[1:18:50] the wrong way for a little bit the wrong
[1:18:51] way. But listen, don't rise up and say
[1:18:54] we're the only ONES THAT'S RIGHT. GOD IS
[1:18:56] RIGHT. THE WORD IS RIGHT. AND IF WE
[1:18:58] FOLLOW THAT, then we'll become right.
[1:19:01] But listen now, we don't have a right to
[1:19:03] have A MONOPOLY ON GOD OR on his word.
[1:19:06] LET THE WORD DO HIS WORK IN PEOPLE'S
[1:19:08] LIVES. [cheering]
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; DON'T BIND IT UP AGAIN. IT'S BEEN BOUND
[1:19:13] UP FOR 2,000 YEARS, BUT IT'S TO BE
[1:19:15] LOOSED IN THE EVENING TIME. BY THE
[1:19:17] EVENING time message. [cheering]
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE LOOSES THE WORD TO THE
[1:19:20] PEOPLE, it means he wants to LOOSE THE
[1:19:23] PEOPLE AND SET THEM free as well.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Your families are free. Your marriages
[1:19:28] ARE FREE. YOUR LIFE IS FREE. YOUR MIND
[1:19:31] IS FREE.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; GOD IS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM. YOU SHALL KNOW
[1:19:36] THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU
[1:19:39] FREE.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:45] I don't know why I took that time to do
[1:19:47] that, but I felt led to do it.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Follow the pillar of fire.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Follow where the word's leading. He
[1:19:55] changes dispensations.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; My dad used to say it this way. He said,
[1:19:59] "Justification, they built a wall.
[1:20:02] Sanctification, they built a wall.
[1:20:04] Pentecost, they built a wall." But he
[1:20:06] said, "God's building a whole building,
[1:20:08] not just three walls." That's right.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And my dad would say, he'd say, "People
[1:20:13] got in Luther's day and they started
[1:20:14] building on that wall of justification
[1:20:16] and putting those bricks up. We're
[1:20:18] building a wall. We're building a wall.
[1:20:20] Glory." And then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:20:21] and says, "We're turning a corner
[1:20:23] because we're building a building here.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; We're building a building." And God gave
[1:20:27] John Wesley the revelation of
[1:20:29] sanctification and they turned a corner.
[1:20:31] But people said, "No, no, no. I don't
[1:20:33] want I'm going to keep building the wall
[1:20:35] of Luther. I'm going to keep doing
[1:20:37] that." And you're bu still building out
[1:20:38] there. somewhere forgot to turn the
[1:20:40] corner. That's
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Built sanctification. Then God turned a
[1:20:44] tor corner back. Pentecost restoration
[1:20:46] of the gifts, restoration of the
[1:20:47] blessings, all those other things. But
[1:20:49] some kept on building that
[1:20:51] sanctification message.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; They didn't move with God.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And then he said, my dad said, God's
[1:20:58] building a building. And Pentecost did
[1:21:01] not turn the corner
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; to this final move of God.
[1:21:07] this final eagle anointing.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; This isn't into this isn't this morning
[1:21:12] to to belittle any other move of God.
[1:21:14] They were moves of God. This is to
[1:21:16] encourage you. You can't stop and keep
[1:21:19] building. You have to turn and move when
[1:21:21] God moves you.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to do as
[1:21:26] Christians today. We want to keep
[1:21:28] building. And any spirit that comes and
[1:21:31] says, "This is it. Period. We're done."
[1:21:34] You will dry up and die
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; just like any other church
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; because it works the same way.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You'll make the message a denomination.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Can I say it?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:53] So, we're called to a we're called to a
[1:21:56] different time. Can you say amen? We're
[1:21:59] called to a different anointing.
[1:22:02] And you know, we don't want to just live
[1:22:05] on the anointing. One of the things with
[1:22:06] Pentecost is just to get a fe just a
[1:22:08] feeling. And the feeling was good
[1:22:10] enough. And you can feel so anointed.
[1:22:12] And I believe I believe in that. But it
[1:22:14] has to be more than just a feeling. You
[1:22:16] know, the other night, a couple weeks
[1:22:17] ago, uh we had our devotions and I was
[1:22:21] very sincerely in prayer, very anointed
[1:22:24] in prayer. And I was praying there with
[1:22:27] all the couples. And you're all supposed
[1:22:28] to be closing your eyes, so I hope you
[1:22:30] didn't see this. But that dog in my
[1:22:32] house came up while I was under the
[1:22:36] anointing praying.
[1:22:38] And it was just like the devil. It was
[1:22:40] just so much like the devil. You know, I
[1:22:42] don't like dogs. But while I'm under
[1:22:44] this strong anointing, this dog comes up
[1:22:47] to me. Now, he usually wags his tail
[1:22:49] when he wants me to put him out. I don't
[1:22:51] have a dog. My son-in-law lives with me.
[1:22:53] He has a dog. I don't like dogs. I long
[1:22:56] for the day. Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And I I that dog usually wags it tail.
[1:23:06] It's It's growling at me while I'm
[1:23:08] praying. While I'm in the holiest of
[1:23:10] holies.
[1:23:13] [groaning]
[1:23:15] I don't know if you seen it. Hopefully
[1:23:17] you didn't. But I'm praying and I kept
[1:23:19] praying. I just kicked that dog in the
[1:23:20] face.
[1:23:22] I'm not going to ask who's seen it
[1:23:24] because it would embarrass me so bad. My
[1:23:26] wife started laughing. She had to pull
[1:23:27] over because she started laughing. I'm
[1:23:29] just I did it two or three times. Get
[1:23:32] out of here. Pray.
[1:23:34] And I actually almost spilled out, Lord,
[1:23:37] can I please pray that there'd be no
[1:23:39] dogs in heaven.
[1:23:44] And I know that's not I know there's
[1:23:47] quotes you're going to give me. There's
[1:23:48] going to be dogs in heaven.
[1:23:52] But I was under an anointing. And the
[1:23:54] devil was trying to take that away from
[1:23:57] me. And I'll tell you, when we get under
[1:24:00] the true anointing of this hour, get
[1:24:04] ready for the enemy to fight you.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And it's not just a feeling or an
[1:24:09] emotion. This is so much deeper than
[1:24:11] that. This is an eyesight that we see
[1:24:13] like we've never seen before. How many
[1:24:16] raise your hand? I want that, Brother
[1:24:17] Paul.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I want to be under that anointing that
[1:24:20] my eyes can see. Uh why am I bringing
[1:24:23] this up? Because if that is the
[1:24:24] anointing we're under, what is the
[1:24:26] nature of it? It's an eagle. It's a
[1:24:28] prophet. Prophets in the Bible are typed
[1:24:30] as eagles. They're seers. They see
[1:24:32] things. And we are privileged to be
[1:24:34] lifted up to see everything from an
[1:24:37] eagle's perspective. Can you say amen?
[1:24:39] Not earthly. Lion, ox, and man. That's
[1:24:42] really They needed that back then. But
[1:24:44] we're going to need the Holy Ghost today
[1:24:45] to come if there's an eagle anointing
[1:24:48] and to live under that eagle anointing.
[1:24:50] Can you say amen? Here's an example of
[1:24:53] being lifted to what the prophecies. 2
[1:24:55] Kings 6:13. Can you guys pull up 2 Kings
[1:24:58] 6:19 if you want to put turn your Bibles
[1:25:00] to it? 2 Kings 6. 2 Kings 6 and verse
[1:25:04] 13.
[1:25:05] 2 Kings 6 and verse 13. Quick example
[1:25:09] here if we could. Do you guys have that?
[1:25:12] And he said, "Go and spy where he is."
[1:25:14] They're trying to find Elisha that I may
[1:25:16] send and fetch him. And it was told him,
[1:25:18] saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
[1:25:21] And therefore sent he horses and
[1:25:24] chariots, and a great host. And they
[1:25:26] came by night, and compassed the city
[1:25:28] about. And when the servant of the man
[1:25:31] of God was risen early, and gone forth,
[1:25:34] behold, a host compassed the city both
[1:25:36] with horses and chariots. And his
[1:25:39] servant said unto him, "Alas, my
[1:25:41] master." Now, just stop right here. He's
[1:25:43] the one to get up and maybe make the
[1:25:45] coffee. He's up. Elisha's probably still
[1:25:47] sleeping. He looks out the window. Why?
[1:25:49] He puts the stuff in the carriage and he
[1:25:51] looks out and there's a whole host
[1:25:54] surrounding their house.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's what he sees.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Wake up. Where's Wait a
[1:26:02] minute. Wake up, Elisha.
[1:26:04] Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Don't you
[1:26:07] care? Alas, my master, what are we going
[1:26:10] to do? Wake up." And he wakes up. And he
[1:26:13] answered, "Fear not, for they that be
[1:26:16] with us are more than they that be with
[1:26:20] them."
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Prophetic eye is seeing it different.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; This is the servant of the Lord. Now
[1:26:29] here we have a we have a thing. This
[1:26:30] servant of the Lord, he's a faithful
[1:26:32] servant. You know what he say going to
[1:26:34] say? If the prophet said it, I believe
[1:26:36] it.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the prophet said that there's
[1:26:42] more with us, I don't see what he's
[1:26:44] seeing, but I believe what he says
[1:26:46] because he's God's prophet.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; But look at this transition. Look at
[1:26:51] this transition.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, I
[1:26:55] pray thee, open his eyes that he may
[1:26:59] see." Yes.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And the Lord opened the eyes of the
[1:27:02] young man, and he saw, and behold, the
[1:27:05] mountain was full of horses and chariots
[1:27:07] of fire round about Elisha.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; It's the transition.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; He believes God sent a prophet. He
[1:27:14] believes what the prophet said. And
[1:27:16] that's the first step. But can you
[1:27:18] imagine, friends, that the Elijah prays,
[1:27:20] "Let them see. Let him see. He's not a
[1:27:23] prophet. He's just a servant." But guess
[1:27:25] what? into this calling of this hour.
[1:27:27] The servants, the bride can see what the
[1:27:31] prophet sees.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; LORD, LET ME SEE WHAT THE WAY THE GOD
[1:27:36] SEEING IT.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; LET MY [screaming] EYES SEE THINGS THE
[1:27:40] WAY GOD SEES IT. SOME OF YOU YOUNG
[1:27:42] PEOPLE, SOME OF YOU DIFFERENT ONES, SOME
[1:27:43] OF YOU OLDER ONES, YOU LOOK AT SOME OF
[1:27:44] THOSE QUOTES AND YOU'RE GOING, I DON'T
[1:27:46] KNOW WHY HE SAID THAT. THAT'S HIS OWN
[1:27:48] OPINION OF HOW TO DRESS. AND YOU you
[1:27:51] just quickly CONCLUDE AND MARK IT OFF
[1:27:53] AND JUST SAY THAT'S HIS OPINION. YOU BE
[1:27:55] CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE IT MAY BE
[1:27:57] YOU CAN'T SEE IT YET.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE IT THE WAY GOD IS
[1:28:02] SEEING IT, YOU'LL SEE IT IS THAT GOD HAS
[1:28:05] SENT HIS WORD TO YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN
[1:28:08] IN THIS GENERATION TO ESCAPE THE LUST
[1:28:11] AND TO ESCAPE THE IMMODEST spirit that's
[1:28:13] here.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. young boy, get into that message
[1:28:18] and pray and say, "God, let me see what
[1:28:20] you're saying here. Let me see it the
[1:28:23] way God is seeing it."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; I sent a little quote to the youth the
[1:28:26] other night in our chat. I just said,
[1:28:27] "What I appreciate as a young man, as I
[1:28:30] begin to read, choosing of a bride." Can
[1:28:32] you imagine? Can you imagine a title of
[1:28:34] a sermon that God breathed on this
[1:28:36] generation? How to choose a bride. Why
[1:28:39] did he have to have a title like that?
[1:28:41] Why did he have to speak something like
[1:28:43] that to this generation? because of the
[1:28:45] condition we're in. 60% DIVORCE.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS [screaming] SAYING, I WANT
[1:28:51] YOU TO KNOW FROM MY WORD HOW TO MAKE A
[1:28:53] DECISION OF CHARACTER.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I love you so much THAT I'LL TELL IT
[1:28:58] LIKE it is. Don't choose that thing with
[1:29:00] caked on makeup and scantily dressed
[1:29:02] clothes and don't choose on beauty and
[1:29:05] something that's pretty, BUT CHOOSE
[1:29:07] CHARACTER. THEN IF SHE'S PRETTY, FINE.
[1:29:09] THAT'S FINE. BUT IT'S SECONDARY TO THE
[1:29:11] CHARACTER OF THE WORD. THAT'S GOD
[1:29:14] BREATHING ON THIS GENERATION TO OUR
[1:29:16] YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ALL OF US. HE'S
[1:29:17] SAYING, "I'LL ADDRESS THAT SITUATION.
[1:29:19] I'LL SPEAK THAT. AND IF you'll see it
[1:29:21] the way I see it, it's the greatest
[1:29:23] blessing this generation has ever
[1:29:25] received." Somebody ought to shout,
[1:29:26] "Praise the Lord."
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. God opened the
[1:29:34] servant's eyes that he can see.
[1:29:38] And he looked and there was the army and
[1:29:41] he seen there was more with him. You
[1:29:43] know, brother Eli was on those
[1:29:44] dimensions Wednesday night. The two
[1:29:47] scriptures tie it together. What a
[1:29:49] wonderful service.
[1:29:53] We're called to heavenly places, the
[1:29:55] believer's position in Christ. So, it's
[1:29:58] not us. It's not flesh and blood. It's
[1:30:00] it's it's we're called to something our
[1:30:04] theophies.
[1:30:06] And that body has never failed. That
[1:30:09] body is a word body. Can you say amen?
[1:30:11] We're hearing from that. So this is a
[1:30:13] another dimension. That's why I preached
[1:30:14] last Sunday to you is that we battle not
[1:30:16] against flesh and blood. And then he
[1:30:18] says at the end of that scripture he
[1:30:19] says but principalities powers spiritual
[1:30:22] wickedness in high places. So you have
[1:30:24] heavenly places and then you have high
[1:30:26] places that's fighting against it in the
[1:30:28] other other dimension. You know, Brother
[1:30:30] Bram said in a service, he said, now he
[1:30:32] said, I can see, he said, in this, you
[1:30:35] can't see it, but he says, angels of God
[1:30:37] are here and the demons are here, and
[1:30:39] there's a battle going on, and your
[1:30:41] faith determines which way that battle
[1:30:43] goes.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Now, this morning, we still are not able
[1:30:48] with our eyes to see that with these
[1:30:50] eyes, but it's the same in the service
[1:30:52] this morning. It's in the other
[1:30:54] dimension. There's spiritual religious
[1:30:56] demons in high places that's even
[1:30:58] messing with your mind even maybe now to
[1:31:00] CAUSE YOU TO DOUBT. BUT YET IN HEAVENLY
[1:31:03] PLACES, WE HAVE A POSITION IN JESUS
[1:31:05] CHRIST. AND IF WE'LL STAND IN THAT
[1:31:07] POSITION, WE RECEIVE THE strength to go
[1:31:09] against the demonic forces.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what that's what
[1:31:15] the servant is saying. Okay, I just
[1:31:18] Elisha just said there's more with us
[1:31:21] than with him. I believe what the
[1:31:22] prophet said. But then his eyes were
[1:31:24] open. He could see the chariots of fire.
[1:31:29] God had chariots of fire before it was a
[1:31:31] movie. By the way, he could see it. And
[1:31:34] he could see, you know, what he said is
[1:31:36] the truth. You know, there's some people
[1:31:38] that's there's some real vindication
[1:31:40] coming to them that have come against
[1:31:41] this message. They're going to find out
[1:31:43] someday you fought against the wrong
[1:31:45] thing
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; because you didn't see it. I say that
[1:31:49] respectfully. I pray for their souls.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't write anybody off,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; but it's just because they don't see it.
[1:31:56] And Elijah's servant says, "I see it
[1:31:59] now. There's more with us." And when
[1:32:01] you're fighting demons every day, you
[1:32:04] remember there's more with you
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; than is with them.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is within you
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Here's another one more quote I wanted
[1:32:16] to read to you. It's a little bit
[1:32:17] lengthy, but I'll end on this.
[1:32:19] a young man or a young woman or a woman
[1:32:21] or man asked Brother Bham this question
[1:32:24] and it was amazing how he responded to
[1:32:26] it. He said, "I lived many years in sin
[1:32:28] until I found the Lord. Please, Brother
[1:32:31] Brandham, I have sinned again and I'm
[1:32:34] not worthy to come before you in this
[1:32:36] holy place. Please tell me if I can be
[1:32:38] restored whole again. Yes, you have not
[1:32:42] sinned, my friend, so far in God. But
[1:32:44] what you could be restored, if you had
[1:32:47] sinned so far that you could not be
[1:32:49] restored, you'd never want to be
[1:32:52] restored.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I just I'm reading this to show we
[1:32:58] have to see things through God's eyes,
[1:33:02] eagle anointing, or the devil will beat
[1:33:05] us up
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; in our mistakes and our unbelief.
[1:33:09] I would love to I would like the man in
[1:33:11] the Bible that Jesus said, "Lord, I
[1:33:13] believe, but help thou my unbelief."
[1:33:14] That's the way I pray because I know
[1:33:16] sometimes in my heart, you have little
[1:33:18] questions, whatever. But I say, "God,
[1:33:20] dissolve all the unbelief out of my
[1:33:21] heart."
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. But when we see things the
[1:33:24] way God's seen and how he's answering
[1:33:25] this question, this is looking from an
[1:33:27] eagle anointing, from a grace anointing,
[1:33:29] from from the way the prophet sees US
[1:33:31] BECAUSE HE HIMSELF HAS DEALT WITH HIS
[1:33:33] MISTAKES, BUT HE HAS FOUND TRUTH ABOUT
[1:33:37] HOW TO DEAL WITH YOUR MISTAKES AGAINST
[1:33:38] THE ENEMY.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; He says some he said you never want to
[1:33:42] be restored. You see, but as long as
[1:33:43] there's something dealing with your
[1:33:45] heart, you're still in line of
[1:33:46] restoration. Guilty of the least is
[1:33:49] guilty of the whole. I have sinned many
[1:33:51] times. Every day, every one of us do
[1:33:54] things that we don't want to do. Did I
[1:33:56] just hear the prophet of God say that I
[1:33:59] have sinned many times?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And it's a bit quiet in here.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God for this age.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; I have sinned many times. Every day,
[1:34:12] every one of us do things that we don't
[1:34:15] want to do. It's in our heart. you don't
[1:34:18] want to be that way or you wouldn't ask
[1:34:21] this question.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; You see that itself that's itself a
[1:34:27] proof that God still is dealing with
[1:34:30] you. You've probably gotten nervous.
[1:34:33] Probably Satan telling you that you
[1:34:34] can't be restored. He's lying. Certainly
[1:34:37] he is. Because look, if there's a deep
[1:34:40] calling, there's got to be a deep to
[1:34:42] respond.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; It goes to show that you only fell from
[1:34:47] grace. I'm skipping through the quotes a
[1:34:48] little bit. Goes to show that you only
[1:34:49] fell from grace. Backsliding is not
[1:34:52] lost. I want somebody to tell me where
[1:34:55] backsliding is lost and prove it in the
[1:34:56] Bible. Backslider is not lost. He's just
[1:34:59] out of fellowship.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Israel backslid, but they never lost
[1:35:02] their covenant.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; THEY LOST THEIR PRAISES AND JOY. DAVID
[1:35:06] LOST THE JOY OF HIS SALVATION WHEN HE
[1:35:08] TOOK BASHEBA, URIAH'S WIFE, BUT HE NEVER
[1:35:11] LOST HIS SALVATION.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; HE LOST THE JOY OF HIS SALVATION.
[1:35:17] What's that song? We're going to have
[1:35:18] the choir come and sing it. I think I I
[1:35:20] lost a lot of things. I LOST THIS, BUT I
[1:35:23] NEVER LOST MY JOY.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I never lost my hope. Can you say amen?
[1:35:28] There's certain THINGS THAT SATAN CAN'T
[1:35:29] TAKE AWAY FROM YOU.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; He'd like to.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; He said, he never said, "Restore to me
[1:35:35] the salvation." Said, "Restore to me the
[1:35:36] joy of my salvation." Oh, there's so
[1:35:38] much of this legalism today that touch
[1:35:41] not, taste not. You don't do things
[1:35:44] legally. I didn't come to this church
[1:35:46] tonight legally.
[1:35:48] I FEEL TIRED. I'VE BEEN NERVOUS. I'M
[1:35:52] UPSET. I'M WONDERING ABOUT SOMETHING
[1:35:54] THAT'S out before me. My heart's
[1:35:56] burning. Even as such as much to MY
[1:35:58] HEART'S FLUTTERING WHILE HE'S STANDING
[1:36:00] THERE PREACHING. I GOT A CRAMP PAIN
[1:36:03] RIGHT at this minute. Just shooting BACK
[1:36:05] AND FORTH UP AND DOWN THROUGH HERE.
[1:36:07] WEAK, NERVOUS, TREMBLY. Catch a a hold
[1:36:11] here and squeeze. I GOT MY TOES SQUEEZED
[1:36:13] UP IN MY SHOES. I FELT ANYTHING BUT COME
[1:36:16] DOWN HERE TO CHURCH.
[1:36:19] Why did I come then? Because I love God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Just sending out a message for those who
[1:36:29] sit at home.
[1:36:32] I I I feel oh just there's something not
[1:36:36] quite right.
[1:36:41] And the prophet's standing here with a
[1:36:43] cramp, curled up toes,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; feeling the burdens
[1:36:49] and all kinds of things, weighing on his
[1:36:51] shoulder.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; If this was a legal thing, he said, "I
[1:36:53] don't do this for a legal thing. We
[1:36:55] don't come to church." Boy, I could
[1:36:57] preach right now and say some things.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; We're getting people are getting lazy.
[1:37:01] Can you say amen? When the Bible says
[1:37:03] you come together so much the more as
[1:37:05] you see the day approaching,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; you think you don't need it, but you do
[1:37:09] need it. You need the body of Christ. I
[1:37:11] said it last Sunday. You need to be in
[1:37:13] the presence of the Lord. Can you say
[1:37:15] amen?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And can you still be a Christian?
[1:37:17] Brother Bren's going to say it here in a
[1:37:18] minute. You can still be a Christian.
[1:37:19] But you see now there's a love of God
[1:37:21] that wells up on our soul that I want to
[1:37:23] hear the word. I want to be in his
[1:37:25] presence.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't sit home. You don't
[1:37:29] I don't you know I don't like that.
[1:37:31] Excuses. Excuses. There's a song that
[1:37:33] says excuses. Excuses. You hear them
[1:37:35] every day.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; I don't even remember the words, but I'm
[1:37:38] at quartet. Maybe we can sing that one.
[1:37:41] It's amazing the excuses.
[1:37:44] But he's he's under this cramp pain.
[1:37:49] I felt anything but come down here. Why
[1:37:50] did I come then? Because I love God.
[1:37:52] Live or die. I'm a stand here for him.
[1:37:55] It's not because I have to.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't care about whether I did or
[1:38:01] not. If I die, I'd go to heaven anyhow.
[1:38:04] But I'm coming because I love him. You
[1:38:07] serve God because you love him, not
[1:38:08] because you just got to do it. Because
[1:38:10] you love him enough. If you make a
[1:38:13] mistake, you don't sin willfully. You
[1:38:15] just done something wrong. See, you've
[1:38:17] slipped back. True. You was up here in
[1:38:21] fellowship. You've dropped back down
[1:38:23] into this moss down here again. But what
[1:38:25] is it? It's just like an eagle. One time
[1:38:28] I saw up here at Cincinnati Zoo. I took
[1:38:30] Sarah and was going down there. If
[1:38:32] anything I've seen that hurt me is to
[1:38:34] see something pinned up. I just can't
[1:38:36] stand to see anything in a cage, even
[1:38:38] little birds. He says just after that in
[1:38:41] the quote, he said, "I'd like to go into
[1:38:42] all these homes and just open the cages
[1:38:44] and let all the little birds out." Then
[1:38:47] how about that big eagle? He's a
[1:38:48] heavenly bird. He lives way above the
[1:38:50] clouds. That's where he goes of the
[1:38:52] morning, way so high, nothing else can
[1:38:54] follow him. Not another bird. He would
[1:38:56] disintegrate in the air if you tried to
[1:38:58] follow him. He's a specialmade bird. And
[1:39:00] then somebody had caught him in a
[1:39:02] man-made trap. He had caught this big
[1:39:04] eagle and put him in his cage. I
[1:39:06] thought, "Oh my, isn't that terrible? I
[1:39:08] wish they'd sell him to me. I'd pawn my
[1:39:10] ford to buy him just to turn him loose."
[1:39:12] Oh, it made me feel so sad. That poor
[1:39:14] big bird there beat the feathers. I
[1:39:17] thought that's the most horrible SIGHT
[1:39:18] I'VE EVER SEEN. NO, NO, I TAKE IT BACK.
[1:39:21] THE MOST HORRIBLE SIGHT I'VE EVER SEEN
[1:39:23] IS A MAN BORN TO BE A son of God and
[1:39:26] then pinned up in some creed.
[1:39:31] and he looks up there and sees a God
[1:39:33] that he really wants to serve, but he
[1:39:35] just can't do it. They won't let him do
[1:39:38] it. See, pinned up. That's a horrible
[1:39:40] thing. Yes, sister, brother. Now, he
[1:39:43] goes back to the question. Ever who
[1:39:45] wrote this? If you have fallen down
[1:39:47] here, that don't mean you're lost.
[1:39:49] You're just an eagle got into a pen.
[1:39:52] That's all. You're caged up down here in
[1:39:54] sin again.
[1:39:57] You don't want to be there. That's the
[1:39:58] reason you're looking upward. There you
[1:40:00] are. Oh, brother Brandham, I once lived
[1:40:02] up there. Is there is there a way here?
[1:40:05] Yes. You may think you're tied too,
[1:40:08] brother, sister, that wrote this
[1:40:10] question. You may think the devil has
[1:40:11] got you tied down there, but he's lying.
[1:40:14] There was one time a man come to earth,
[1:40:17] Jesus Christ, the son of God. He untied
[1:40:20] you.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe it?
[1:40:26] You don't have to stay down there. No,
[1:40:28] sir. I'm closing the service. I'm saying
[1:40:30] from this, you don't have to stay bound.
[1:40:33] You don't have to stay down there.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; You can see things the way God sees him
[1:40:38] from an eagle's perspective.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. He died in your place to
[1:40:42] take away your sins. You just believe on
[1:40:44] him, flop your wings, and fly away with
[1:40:45] the rest of him. Don't stay in that pit
[1:40:47] of the devil. No, sir. Now, will you lay
[1:40:49] your hands? They they said in the
[1:40:51] question they said will you lay your
[1:40:53] hands on upon me and free from that
[1:40:58] sister dear or brother dear? Sure I'd
[1:41:00] lay hands on you but that wouldn't free
[1:41:02] you.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; It's amazing isn't it?
[1:41:09] I'd hand laid hands on you but it
[1:41:11] wouldn't free you.
[1:41:13] Would you would what would free you is
[1:41:16] to understand that you're already free.
[1:41:20] Glory be to God.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; It's not laying on hands. It's under
[1:41:27] It's It's seeing something.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; It's seeing you're already free.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You're already untied. You don't have to
[1:41:34] worry about being free. You're already
[1:41:35] free. Jesus made you free. Be not again
[1:41:38] entangled again with the yoke OF
[1:41:39] BONDAGE. YOU'RE FREE AS YOU CAN BE. YOU
[1:41:42] DON'T HAVE TO BE TANGLED UP. Laying my
[1:41:44] hands on you is just a tradition.
[1:41:51] We might do that.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; That why I could do that. BUT THAT STILL
[1:41:56] WOULDN'T SET YOU FREE UNTIL YOU ACCEPT
[1:41:59] WHAT HE DONE FOR YOU. THAT'S JUST ME
[1:42:01] SAYING, "LORD, I believe it."
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMEBODY GIVE GLORY to the Lord.
[1:42:06] [applause]
[1:42:07] HE'S ALREADY SET you free.
[1:42:10] HE'S ALREADY SET YOU FREE. [applause]
[1:42:14] HE'S ALREADY SOMEBODY RAISE YOUR HANDS.
[1:42:16] STAND TO YOUR FEET. SAY, "LORD, YOU'VE
[1:42:18] ALREADY SET ME FREE THIS MORNING. You've
[1:42:21] already given me freedom in this word.
[1:42:23] YOU'VE MADE ME AN EAGLE. I ALWAYS WILL
[1:42:26] BE AN EAGLE. I CAN RISE ABOVE ANY
[1:42:28] SITUATION." YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
[1:42:30] It's seeing things through God's
[1:42:33] eyesight.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO SEE YOURSELF.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; SEE YOURSELF AS GOD SEES YOU. You have
[1:42:40] to see your victory as God sees your
[1:42:42] victory. You have to look at it not
[1:42:44] through flesh and blood. Not through
[1:42:46] flesh and blood, but to look at it
[1:42:48] through God's eyes. One day Sarah caught
[1:42:50] it. It doesn't even show when she caught
[1:42:52] it. It just knows. It just says she
[1:42:53] received strength. She received seed.
[1:42:55] She brought forth the promised son. But
[1:42:57] what day she caught it? She was being uh
[1:42:59] uh sarcastic to those angels, even to
[1:43:01] the Lord. I didn't laugh. She denied it.
[1:43:03] She lied to the Lord. Write her off. No,
[1:43:06] can't write her off. She's a daughter of
[1:43:08] God. One day, something her eyes were
[1:43:11] open and she seen it. Like the prophet
[1:43:13] Abraham, I see it.
[1:43:15] I see it. And I believe the moment she
[1:43:18] seen it, her body began to receive
[1:43:20] strength.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to live a life that I might
[1:43:24] lose a lot of things, but I never lost.
[1:43:27] Can you pull that song up? I love that
[1:43:28] song. Why don't we have the choir? You
[1:43:30] can sing it right there in your seats.
[1:43:33] Who Who leads it, Kenny? Come on. We
[1:43:34] need a lead. Gideon, come and lead it.
[1:43:38] I'm forming my own choir here this
[1:43:40] morning because we're going to worship
[1:43:41] the Lord.
[1:43:42] Grab your mic there. Any of the choir,
[1:43:45] anybody who knows this, I've lost some
[1:43:47] good friends a long life's way. Some
[1:43:49] loved ones departed in heaven to stay.
[1:43:52] But thank God I didn't lose everything.
[1:43:54] How many raise your hand say? Thank God
[1:43:55] I didn't LOSE EVERYTHING. THERE'S
[1:43:57] CERTAIN THINGS I can't lose.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I've lost some good [singing] friends
[1:44:03] along.
[1:44:07] Some love departed [singing]
[1:44:11] in heaven [music] to stay. But thank God
[1:44:15] [singing] I didn't lose everything.
[1:44:17] [music]
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; I've lost people.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. Who said
[1:44:27] [singing and music] they care
[1:44:30] in the time of my crisis?
[1:44:33] They were [singing] never there. [music]
[1:44:37] But in my disappointments, [singing]
[1:44:41] in my sinless pain,
[1:44:45] oh, [music and singing] one thing ever
[1:44:47] wavered,
[1:44:48] one thing ever changed.
[1:44:52] [music and singing]
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Sing it now. Hallelujah. I never lost
[1:44:57] [singing] my home.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I never lost [music and singing] my joy.
[1:45:06] Oh,
[1:45:08] no, no, no.
[1:45:11] [singing and music]
[1:45:11] I never lost my faith,
[1:45:15] but most of [singing and music] all,
[1:45:23] I never lost my [singing]
[1:45:28] praise.
[1:45:31] Still [music and singing] here
[1:45:34] my praise.
[1:45:37] Yes, still.
[1:45:40] I've left some blessings
[1:45:43] [music] just slip [singing] away. Glory
[1:45:46] be to God.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I've lost my focus
[1:45:50] and went [singing]
[1:45:52] astray. But thank God I didn't [music]
[1:45:56] lose everything.
[1:46:00] Hallelujah. Oh, and I've lost [music]
[1:46:03] possessions [singing]
[1:46:06] that were so dear.
[1:46:09] Oh, and I've lost some battles,
[1:46:11] [music and singing]
[1:46:13] my walking in fear.
[1:46:16] But in the midst of my struggle,
[1:46:20] [singing and music] in my Oh,
[1:46:22] hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Oh, one thing
[1:46:26] ever w
[1:46:32] [music]
[1:46:36] I never lost [music and singing] my
[1:46:38] home. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. Lord, I
[1:46:42] never [singing] I never [music] lost my
[1:46:45] soul.
[1:46:48] No, no, no.
[1:46:51] I [singing] never lost my [music] faith.
[1:46:54] But most of all, [singing]
[1:46:59] [music]
[1:47:00] oh,
[1:47:02] I never lost my friend.
[1:47:05] [singing]
[1:47:06] I never [music] lost my hope. I never
[1:47:10] lost my hope.
[1:47:13] Oh, I never
[1:47:16] I never lost [music] my joy.
[1:47:22] Oh, [singing]
[1:47:24] I never [music] lost my faith.
[1:47:27] [singing] But most of all,
[1:47:32] [music] most of all,
[1:47:35] I never lost my [singing] praise.
[1:47:43] Yeah. Yeah. Praise.
[1:47:50] Hallelujah.
[1:47:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] Hallelujah.
[1:48:01] Somebody said, "Praise the Lord."
[1:48:03] [music]
[1:48:04] Hallelujah.
[1:48:06] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:09] Hallelujah.
[1:48:12] Glory.
[1:48:13] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. We're grateful,
[1:48:16] Lord Jesus.
[1:48:18] Praise [singing] him. him.
[1:48:22] Praise him.
[1:48:25] Praise him. [singing]
[1:48:28] Praise [music] him.
[1:48:32] Jesus,
[1:48:34] blessed savior. [singing]
[1:48:37] He's worthy.
[1:48:41] This is time to praise him. Singing now.
[1:48:43] Oh, praise him.
[1:48:47] Praise [singing] him.
[1:48:50] Praise him. [music]
[1:48:53] Praise him. Oh Jesus,
[1:48:56] [music and singing]
[1:48:58] blessed savior,
[1:49:01] is worthy to be. [singing and music]
[1:49:05] Oh,
[1:49:07] from the rising of the
[1:49:10] [music and singing] sun
[1:49:13] until the going out of the [music]
[1:49:19] He is worthy.
[1:49:21] Jesus is worthy.
[1:49:25] He's worthy to be [singing] praised.
[1:49:29] [music]
[1:49:31] Praise him.
[1:49:34] Praise him.
[1:49:36] Praise [singing] him.
[1:49:39] Praise him.
[1:49:42] Jesus,
[1:49:44] blessed savior, [singing]
[1:49:48] worthy to be.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads this morning. If
[1:49:54] [music] you would just turn, lay your
[1:49:56] hands on your brother and sister. Pray
[1:49:58] for one of this mo one of this beloved
[1:50:01] next to you here this morning.
[1:50:05] We certainly heard something from the
[1:50:07] [music] Lord today, I believe, that
[1:50:08] would encourage us to stand in our
[1:50:10] position in heavenly places in Christ
[1:50:13] and know that there's no enemy that can
[1:50:16] be bigger than the promise. How many
[1:50:17] believe there's no problem bigger than
[1:50:19] the promise of this hour [music]
[1:50:20] and you're a part of that promise. You
[1:50:22] have to believe that and see it the way
[1:50:24] God sees it. Heavenly Father, let us see
[1:50:28] it just the way you've seen us before
[1:50:30] the foundation of the world. Let our
[1:50:32] eyes Lord be anointed with Isaab that we
[1:50:36] could see. That's what we needed in the
[1:50:38] leosian generation, a blind church. But
[1:50:41] Lord, you have given us eagle eagle
[1:50:44] eyes, Lord. And look at the whole
[1:50:46] panorama and look above it all and be
[1:50:48] able to see where we've come from, where
[1:50:51] we're going, who we are, Lord. And there
[1:50:54] is no devil in hell. There's no power of
[1:50:56] the enemy. There's no doubt. There's no
[1:50:58] fear that can ever be bigger than that.
[1:51:02] And I'm so thankful, Lord, to be your
[1:51:04] son. I'm thankful for this people who
[1:51:06] love the word of God. And Lord,
[1:51:08] something that goes beyond just
[1:51:09] something surface when we worship and
[1:51:11] express oursel exuberantly this morning,
[1:51:14] Lord. It goes deeper than just a
[1:51:16] feeling. Lord, what there's no better
[1:51:19] place than to take our emotions and our
[1:51:21] our our love for you than to you,
[1:51:24] Father, and express it. We love and
[1:51:26] thank you, Lord, for what you've spoken
[1:51:28] to us. And we pray you [music] take each
[1:51:30] one now, Lord, in your presence. May you
[1:51:32] go with them, Lord. May they live in
[1:51:35] this truth and live under this anointing
[1:51:38] for this hour. Every day, every
[1:51:40] teenager, may they live under this
[1:51:42] anointing. If they don't have the Holy
[1:51:44] Ghost, I pray, Lord, that they get such
[1:51:47] a hunger in their heart, Lord, to be
[1:51:49] filled. I pray and they wouldn't leave
[1:51:51] you Lord until [music] they've had that
[1:51:53] satisfying portion. Bless it Lord Jesus.
[1:51:56] There's no devil in hell that can keep
[1:51:59] us from your promise and we believe that
[1:52:02] in Jesus name. [music] Thank you Lord.
[1:52:04] Thank you Lord. Do you love him this
[1:52:06] morning? Let's give the Lord a hand clap
[1:52:08] of praise. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:52:11] [applause and music]
[1:52:14] He's promised to hold my hand. You know
[1:52:16] that he's promised to hold my hand. He's
[1:52:22] promised [singing and music] to help me

[1:54:20] Brother Kyle, it's good to have you this
[1:54:22] morning. Would you come and close us in
[1:54:23] prayer? Would you mind doing that? God
[1:54:25] bless you, Brother Kyle. My heart
[1:54:26] visiting him and his wife and family
[1:54:28] today. Praise the Lord. Forgive me for
[1:54:30] getting a little emotional. If you or I
[1:54:33] were to leave, I I might dance today
[1:54:35] because I'm living in the liberties of
[1:54:37] the Lord Jesus Christ. No matter how bad
[1:54:39] our week would go, no matter where the
[1:54:41] what the devil speaks to us, [music] I
[1:54:44] want to see through God's eyes. I want
[1:54:46] to see others through God's eyes. I want
[1:54:48] to see me through God's eyes. I want to
[1:54:49] see this word, this message. I want to I
[1:54:52] want to catch the thought of what he
[1:54:54] meant when he said it.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And guess what? We can catch that
[1:54:58] thought [music]
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; by revelation. That way we're not
[1:55:01] interpreting things oursel. We're
[1:55:03] walking on this earth as our brother Eli
[1:55:05] said Wednesday night. We're voices.
[1:55:07] [music]
[1:55:08] What's the other dimension? We're
[1:55:10] vocalizing that word
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; in the earth because Jesus prayed, "Thy
[1:55:14] kingdom come. [music] Thy will be done
[1:55:16] on earth as it is in heaven. We're
[1:55:19] pulling from that other dimension and
[1:55:21] building that kingdom here on earth in
[1:55:23] our home." Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:55:25] you, brother Kyle.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; It's great to have you this morning,
[1:55:28] brother. God bless you. appreciate
[1:55:29] [music] you.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I wasn't expecting
[1:55:35] that. Uh I have to say I had just
[1:55:39] preached I had studied the countdown
[1:55:41] this last couple weeks, brother. [music]
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, you watch science as
[1:55:45] science progresses. So that's where
[1:55:46] God's taking his church,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "We went from the horse and
[1:55:50] buggy age, then we went to the
[1:55:51] automobile age." He said, "From
[1:55:52] justification to sanctification."
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "From the automobile, we went
[1:55:56] to the airplane age." Yep. Y we moved
[1:55:58] from justification, sanctification, the
[1:56:00] restoration of the gifts of the spirit.
[1:56:02] He said, "Oh, but there's one more stage
[1:56:04] to go." He said, "It's the astronaut
[1:56:06] age."
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "We've moved on into the
[1:56:08] intelligence of God. We're guided by
[1:56:10] something." And I so love that. He said,
[1:56:12] "In 1933, I saw a car."
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Is this okay? I preach.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I get excited because I got
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah."
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw that car in 1933. It was
[1:56:22] guided by something. Some radar was
[1:56:24] guiding it along." He said, "Oh, that's
[1:56:26] where the church will be guided by the
[1:56:29] Holy Ghost to navigate all the dangers
[1:56:32] that are ahead." So, we're resting in
[1:56:34] that Holy Ghost leadership. He said, "In
[1:56:37] the airplane age, there's still
[1:56:38] turbulence." He said, "But not in the
[1:56:40] astronaut age." He said, "They wreck up,
[1:56:42] they fuss, they fight, they argue, they
[1:56:44] complain. All in the astronaut age, but
[1:56:47] or in the airplane age, but not in the
[1:56:49] astronaut age, the bride age. We've
[1:56:51] moved on into the intelligence of God
[1:56:54] guiding his church along. Yes, sir. And
[1:56:56] I just got excited, brother. That that
[1:56:57] really encouraged me. Wonderful. So,
[1:56:59] let's just bow our heads and thank the
[1:57:01] Lord for his grace.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, it's so good to be in
[1:57:05] your presence. The word, Lord, it's so

[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; You said, "I'll never leave him. I'll
[1:57:12] never forsake him. I'll be with him even
[1:57:14] to the end of the world."
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, it just encourages our hearts,
[1:57:19] Lord. seeing the day of age that we're
[1:57:21] living in. This age of deception, Lord,
[1:57:23] you never lost sight of your children.

[1:57:55] the thought that I had while he just
[1:57:56] started preaching there. Why don't you

[1:58:00] that? That'd be all right. Can you come

[2:13:23] Something keeps holding me. [music]
[2:13:29] The trials [singing] of this world
[2:13:33] [music]
[2:13:34] were getting closer.
[2:13:39] The pull I [singing and music] felt was
[2:13:42] more than I could bear.
[2:13:48] And [music and singing] I was on the
[2:13:50] verge of giving over.
[2:13:57] The [music] strength within [singing]
[2:13:59] myself
[2:14:00] just wasn't there. [music]
[2:14:05] But something keeps holding [singing]
[2:14:07] me.
[2:14:10] Every day I see. [music]
[2:14:12] Yes, Lord. He's helping [singing] me
[2:14:15] faithfully
[2:14:17] to overcome my [music]
[2:14:19] trials,

[2:14:24] constantly,
[2:14:27] giving me victory.

[2:14:35] Something keeps [music and singing]
[2:14:36] holding me.
[2:14:41] And Satan laid before me his temptation
[2:14:46] [music and singing]
[2:14:50] of his desire [singing and music]
[2:14:53] to steal away my faith.
[2:14:57] Thank you Lord for [singing] I have
[2:15:01] found inside the revelation. [music]
[2:15:08] The strength I need to keep me in
[2:15:12] [singing]
[2:15:12] his grace.
[2:15:16] [music]
[2:15:16] Something keeps holding me.
[2:15:20] [singing]
[2:15:21] Every [music] day I see,
[2:15:25] oh, [singing] helping me faithfully
[2:15:28] to overcome my trials,

[2:15:34] guiding me constantly,
[2:15:37] [music]
[2:15:39] giving me [singing] victory.

[2:15:54] Oh,
[2:15:56] every [singing]
[2:15:57] day I see
[2:16:01] helping me faithfully
[2:16:02] [singing and music]

[2:16:22] holding me.
[2:16:27] So just hold [singing]
[2:16:30] me close.
[2:16:33] Let your [singing] love surround
[2:16:39] me.
