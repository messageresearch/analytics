TRANSCRIPT
========================================
look to him tonight a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that that's more than just a song to us but a testimony of your power to save and to keep and to redeem in each of Our Lives father we have gathered together from many different places different different backgrounds we stand before you tonight as the redeemed of the Lord father we just ask now that you would just take this time and this service take this time which we've set aside for you and may you just come Lord we've invited you but may you be welcome now in this place to come and to have your way in our lives and in our hearts may you bless each one father may you touch the different needs tonight in a way which only you can do it Lord for you can do exceeding abundantly tonight in this place above anything that we could ask or even think father we just expect we look with expectation to what you're going to say and to do and we thank you we ask now all these things and may you receive all the praise and glory and honor for we asked in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you if you have your Bibles this evening I'd ask you to turn with me to the book of Nehemiah the second chapter I've been kind of doing a bit of a series of different places and I can just pick it up wherever but I was talking about the idea of a greater World contrasting the world that we are in now with the world which is to come and uh you know God he uses the law of contrast to prove his attributes you know there was attributes in him as a redeemer as a savior and of course we look at the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah and he's manifesting parts of himself attributes of himself to us that which is going to be displayed in a greater world the world to come and so I'd like to take a thought tonight the architect of a greater world and if you're with me here in the book of Nehemiah normally I would start here in the 11th verse but I'm going to look at the 10th verse of course Nehemiah has been given permission to go and rebuild the Wall in Jerusalem I think it's kind of interesting to look at it in the the context of the time that we live in they had a restoration of the temple there have been a restoration of the word but there were some homes and some lives that were centered around this place of worship that needed rebuilt still so Nehemiah obtains permission to go and to rebuild this and the enemies of of the Lord find out about this in the tenth verse and it says when sambalat the horror night in tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel I think it's interesting your enemy is grieved when God sends a man your way like a pastor like a minister I hope tonight by the help of God I can fulfill that how it Grieves your enemy when somebody comes with your welfare in mind God sends you somebody with a message to help you out Nehemiah of course he comes here verse 11 he says I so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in in the night I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem neither was there any Beast with me saved the Beast that I rode upon and I went out by Night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went on to the gate of the fountain into the king's pool but there was no place for the Beast that was under me to pass then went I up in the Night by the Brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so return and the rulers knew not with her I went or what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work then said I unto them ye see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach than I told them he begins to give a testimony then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the king's word that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated this evening so we're talking about the architect of a greater world you know one of the things that a a person that's in the world maybe a person that hasn't really sought the Lord or carnally minded person they they look at the world and the condition it's in today and they ask the question you know if God is a good God and God made everything why is the world so bad why is there homelessness and and sickness and starvation and oppression and every evil work if he's a righteous God why does he permit so much evil if he's a loving God why does he send people to hell and the answer is to why the world is so bad and it's evil is that the world that we live in today is not the result of the design of God but the perversion of that design by Satan so he is the architect of this Cosmos that we are living in today he perverted the original design and he's transformed it in what the prophet would Now call Satan's Eden amen and so I look at this original creation we want to go back and look at the original creation for a moment and brother Brandon he he goes to some length to really dramatize talking about the original creation how God would take 6 000 years to carefully craft a world for his children to dwell and he caused Great volcanoes and magma to shift into certain positions to to bring up mountains and and form land masses and the prophet said he would plant seeds and he would cause life to come forth from those seeds and he would create a situation where the lion and the lamb could lay down together and he places the stars and he sets them in a certain kind of an orbit and even today we can't build a clock that measures by the same precision as the cosmos of that creation and the prophet makes a statement he said it was perfect peace Perfect Harmony amen and so I want to remind you and I want you to think about this tonight that when God begins to paint this great picture or to craft this Great Masterpiece and he's looking at the world and doing these things he's not taking a blank slate or a blank canvas but he's taking a canvas of chaos and and of Darkness because the Bible says that the Earth was without form and it was voided this time when he began to do these things and we see this pattern time and time again with God and it would be one thing if God took a blank slate if he took an empty canvas and he created a masterpiece on that area he fashioned some sort of a masterpiece out of that but but the spirit of God begins to brood over the Earth and it's chaos and in its Darkness it begins to brood and it begins to change what you know the prophet said maybe it was a volcanic landscape or whatever it is and out of that condition he creates this paradise and brothers Branham says that God is a great contractor amen he lays all the material out it's not like me now I don't want to keep you Earl long tonight but I'll just tell you this I'm not a professional builder I'm not a contractor when I start a home project I've got to go to the store four or five times most of my time fixing something simple is spent going to the store and buying another screw or buying another Hammer I've got three at home I don't know where they're at go get another one amen but a professional knows what he needs at the beginning and he lays it all out it's already laying there and God is this great contractor everything he needs is laying there and he begins to work with the material that's laying there Amen in the midst of chaos and disorder and you know it's one thing if a man if he starts a business or a project or a church or whatever if he runs it right and he makes it successful that's a great thing but it's an entirely another situation if a man would take a business that was failing or a church that was falling apart or government or whatever it is and it's falling apart and it's going the wrong way and God and a man would take that and turn that around that takes a special kind of man a special kind of talent and that's the kind of man Nehemiah is here when we read in the Bible when he comes to Jerusalem there's not just a bunch of Timber laying out for him and some bricks that are stacked up and some nice machinery and everything's just looking good when he comes it's in distress it's chaos his beasts can't even go through the door half the time and Nehemiah doesn't come in there with a plan drafted up he didn't consult with some Architects and say well I think this is how we're going to restructure everything he's got he's got nothing from a man no sort of a plan or idea of his own but he comes in there to a disaster it's a disaster what he's looking at nobody wants to walk into a disaster and fix it but that's what God gave them and that's what God works with so many times there's rubble and there's debris he can't even take his mouth through but what he does with it is what made him such an example to us that he could take it in this condition and turn it into something that would magnify the Lord he has handed chaos and disorder many times you and I don't ask for the problems we have it's just kind of handed to us he testifies himself you see how great a distress we are in the walls lay waste Jerusalem's waste the gates are burned with fire and Nehemiah could have looked at and said you know what it's worse than I thought it was going to be I heard it was bad you know I heard about back in Babylon I heard about with the medes and Persians you know this is a lost cause I I knew there was going to be trouble but let's forget the whole thing it's a lost cause just forget it you've got to give me favor with the King God allowed me to be here God made Provisions for me and he brought me to this place but you know what the work's too great for me I can't do it let's forget the whole thing but that's not what he does he says you know you see how everything lies in wastes therefore let us come come let us build it up together you see the work is great it's going to require some great workers it's going to require some Vision it's going to require some sacrifice but we're going to do things with this when everybody else sees chaos they saw Rubble they saw distress but when Nehemiah looks at it he has a vision he sees there's potential laying there to build it into something new something greater than it was when he found it and the people he addresses they're all seeing the same thing maybe some scratching their head well listen we've looked at this for the last few days a few months how's the man going to rebuild us but he begins to testify got to give me favor with the King God had permitted me to be here God had permitted me the provision to be here as he begins to testify about what God had done in his life they get inspired listen if God can do that for Nehemiah he can do it for you he can do it for me he can take chaos like he did in the beginning and bring it into order amen they had been uh he they had been uh the scripture talks about they were a byword and a hissing to the Nations and people are making fun of them but God is going to take away their approach through restoration they're going to take a chaotic situation and bring it back to order and I want you to remember this tonight no matter what you're going through God excels at bringing order out of Chaos it's not just capable it's not just good at it he excels at taking the worst situations the most dire circumstances in turning it into a masterpiece you know what I'm talking about many of that was your life you can testify that's where you were but where are you at tonight God took the worst he took chaos and when the world looked at you and said that's impossible nobody can fix that God saw you like Nehemiah saw them laws he said there's a son there's a daughter of God laying in the midst of that you say it's impossible God Specializes and things thought impossible we look at the beginning out of this primordial chaos God brings Eden he didn't just fix it up made it perfect we're talking about God we're talking about Redemption he's wanting to he's wanting to demonstrate this is what kind of a redeemer I am I'm not just a good handyman not just a good Fixer-Upper I'm a redeemer I can take the worst and make it Paradise I can take the most dire circumstances and we even make a masterpiece but the RAM says this and Satan's even God's even was established in righteousness Satan's Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin God is righteous and God's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and Satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin and I want to talk about this for just a moment because it makes sense that Satan's Eden was established in sin because it was founded and predicated on a single lie it was found on a lie and everything that's taken place today every every hospital and every sickness every depression it's all because it was funded on a lie Thou shalt not die so of course he distorts the commandment and we know the penalty of thereof is death and he's a pervertor of the truth and you know I think about this often that's all he can do is pervert he's not a creator sometimes we look at the world today and we think what a what a dire circumstance it is but listen Satan's never come up with anything on his own he's just the perverter of what God has done he's obsessed and you I think about this how frustrating it must be for a being that is obsessed with his own beauty that desires his own kingdom to glorify himself and to have a kingdom like the sons of God for all that yet he cannot create a blade of grass he can't create squirrels he can't do a single thing to think how frustrating it must be that in all of his achievement and all of Satan's eaten God has freely given to you and I what Satan always desires because death and life are in the power of your tongue your tongue has the power to create an atmosphere your tongue has the power by faith to speak worlds into existence and go live on them you were freely given he took the very dust of the Earth the very lowest thing he said out of this I will fashion Sons and Daughters of God to thwart the enemy and you serve as a constant reminder tonight that for all of his achievement and all that he can do and all the chaos he can create he has no power to create he has no power to redeem [Music] amen now you can use your tongue for good or evil amen there's creative power there but you know it's like it's like James says a falcon does a fountain bring forth bitter Waters than sweet God forbid you can take your tongue and you can say things to destroy people or as a Christian you have power in the words that you say they're not your words but as an amateur God I'm just when submitted to the headship of God the same one that created the heavens of the Earth the same one that raised Christ from the dead is in you to restore order to bring peace to bring Harmony into lives that are in chaos including your own hey man the words you testify over your own life will dictate where you're going to live at tonight amen and we look at Satan's eating today and and I want you to remember Satan did not build this Eden on his own he needed a man to do it because he he understands the potential that lies in man he understands it in your tongue is death and life it's there's creative power there and so he takes hands of willing people to fashion and to shape this Eden and he's so engineered this Eden today it's so designed to deceive the whole world whose names are not in the Lamb's Book of Life but yet for all that like I said he still can't redeem his soul amen can't create a squirrel he can't do one thing he cannot give life he can only take it hey man listen that's all he can do he can take he can rob he cannot give life but yet God has allowed you as the body of Christ to be instruments of his righteousness amen so he sewed everything in in confusion The Whole World's confusing they don't even know they don't know what their gender is they don't know what's right they don't know what's wrong what is right is wrong what's wrong is right the whole thing's upside down the whole head is sick the Bible says and I want you to remember that the fruit of chaos is confusion that's why the world's confused today it's in a chaotic State the fruit of chaos is confusion but the fruit of warrior is harmony not the harmony that men try to create with themselves or political affiliations it's the Harmony and creation itself that allowed a lion and a lamb to lay down together that allowed the cosmos to dwell together where there's no death no sin no unrighteousness the Divine Harmony is the fruit of the order of God because God is not the author of confusion where you see confusion you know who the author is amen the world's falling apart today the things of the world are falling apart and even all creation in the Bible says it groans within itself creation is groaning you think it's just you the whole creation's groaning because everything that can be shaken will be shaken it's being shaken right now so all the disorder in the world today it's a testament or an identification that Satan's the the the the author of it amen you take a certain man and I'm not an expert but you take certain artists and you know certain artists will make a picture a sculpture and you can make all kinds of imitations and all kinds of things and they look just like it but but a real expert they know how to identify the real from the fake because that that first author that first painter that first artist they use certain paints they did certain things that looked different and so they can identify who created something based on certain qualities inherent in the Arts and so we can look at the world today and we can look at the situation and realize this is Satan's brand of craftsmanship God didn't set the world in the condition it's in today it fell into it through death and Chaos that's how you know the Bible says his wisdom Satan's wisdom it's Earthly it's sensual it's devilish where envy and strife is the Bible says there is confusion Endeavor evil work in other words where Satan has wrote the the where he is the author of it that's why you have confusion that's why you have every evil work that's because he was the architect of it amen it's how you identify like an architect like an artist it's something that identifies it's his work but God is not the author of confusion he's the author of peace it's his identification in in creation it's his identification in Recreation and Redemption there's order there's Harmony there's restoration it looks like what it was designed to be in the first place amen as Believers we understand tonight I hope we understand this that the heavens and earth are going to be renovated what you're looking at today is not what it's going to be you can look at the world today and say how's it ever going to be because the architect has a plan he's already declared it he's already laid out the blueprint amen old things are going to pass away all things are going to be made new amen and God is a good contractor the material he needs is already laying here tonight he doesn't need a new ball of dirt he doesn't need a new word what he needs tonight for a new creation is already laying here just like in your life it was already laying there in the midst of confusion there was a seat in your life there was a word over your life and God begins to move upon that and it brings it into order amen all the things that are seen today they're made up of things which are not seen they're all upheld by the word of his power amen the worlds the Bible says they're upheld by the word of his power the materials there we believe in the word of God tonight amen if you believe in the word of God you believe in the word of his power we believe in the moving of the Holy Spirit you say why because the Same Spirit moved across the Earth to the beginning and brought it into harmony I believe that same spirit is here tonight in our lives taking chaos in sickness and disorder and bringing it back into harmony bringing it back into peace the fruit of righteousness his spirit is here tonight doing it in our lives we believe in the resurrection we believe in eternal life why because we're Witnesses of it this Earth is being redeemed the prophet said it Hadith baptism in the flood it was Sanctified when the blood of Christ fell from the cross and we understand tonight it's fixing to be burned with fire it's baptism of fire why to bring forth this new order this new Heavens this new Earth a place where everything will return back into Divine Harmony again a place for everything and everything in its place amen I don't know if we got any organizers here tonight but you know what I'm talking about this Fork goes here and this spoon here in my sock drawer amen we're not talking about organized religion we're talking about an order that God laid out people get so shook up by the idea of of order listen that's a that's biblical things should be in a certain order that's what makes it work I tell you what when your car is not in order it don't run the right way does it because everything that's in that engine hopefully is designed to work in a certain way it's there for a certain reason and when God made everything everything he made had a certain intention behind it God's intention behind everything he made was was the was harmony with his creation it was peace amen and so everything he's doing it has an intention and he's going to bring everything back into that and that's why the scripture says that the former things will pass away we read about it in the Book of Revelation he'll wipe away every tear from their eyes the Bible says there'll be no more death Hallelujah no sorrow no no crying no pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat on the throne declared behold think about that word behold God's like look over here it's pay attention look or see or take notice I want you to see this behold I make all things new God wants you to see he's drawing your attention behold I make all things new put your attention on the craftsmanship that I've raw in this new creation amen because listen in your own lives you might not always see it you might be looking tonight like Nehemiah and a bunch of rubble you might be looking at unpaid bills you might be looking at sickness you might be looking at problems or mind battles maybe you've dealt with it for years I don't know where you eat at tonight but behold look at this don't look at your problem tonight don't look at the circumstances look at what he's doing behold I make all things new amen praise the Lord listen Paul says the same thing in second Corinthians chapter five If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold look see all things are new all things are of God it's not talking about your flesh he's talking about that inward man God didn't do a Part Way job when he saved you if he sealed you he sealed you to the day of your Redemption and you right now as a Christian all things that pertain to life and godliness they're in You by the Holy Ghost behold all the materials already laying there look at this everything's laid out already amen so we identify Satan his Works Jesus did the same thing Saint John the 10th 10th chapter he said the thief comes what to steal to kill and to destroy but I have come Hallelujah I believe that's why he's here tonight in us I have come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly God is not out tonight to steal your joy amen that's the enemy he's not here tonight to steal your health he's not here tonight to steal your peace he's not here tonight to steal your blessing that's why the enemy comes but he's come that you might have a life and that you might have it more abundantly you know what abundance is more than you need now I just got enough life in me to make it to the next church service I've got just enough life to be happy for a couple days and then when I run Drive no you've got abundance of life you drink this water you never have to thirst again people coming they're trying to crank it pulled all the time I I wish I could get more of this I wish listen if you're planted in this Fountain you can have as much as you want you just have to drink it he's giving you life and it abundantly all the joy You'll Ever Need Is In You by the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God's not meeting your ink it's righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost now you might not tonight I wish I had my my joy it's still there don't let the enemy tell you it's gone he's lying to you he's trying to steal something from you because it doesn't belong to him it belongs to you that's what makes him a thief it's yours my joy is not diminished my peace is not gone my God tonight is greater than any works of the enemy greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world my architect he's not built on a faulty Foundation he's not built my life after circumstances and chants but before the world began he knew the plans he had for you plans for peace and for an expected end you're not some shock or something mean to you're a masterpiece you're the habitation of the Living God he ordained you to be the dwelling place of his spirit Hallelujah no but brother look at all the wreckage look at all the broken pieces of my life in all that yet God chose you for this purpose listen you weren't designed to be sad you weren't designed to be sick that's through that's through a fall but the healers here tonight the redeemer's here tonight and he's working in your life and that's what makes you different because God has an order and he has a way and whenever we'd venture outside of that whenever we deviate from this we've we've taken up with the same author that has designed Satan's Eden when we deviate from this blueprint that's where trouble comes in our lives I'm not just talking about circum I'm talking about real trouble because we have left the original design but if you stay with this I'm not promising you'll never have to work with some Rubble I'm not promising you're never going to come to some walls that I wrote down but what I will promise is the architect will restore back He restored the word on this day he is a restorer and then he can ReStore in your life there's something different about you than the rest of the world you think about it God has an order and a way to things like I said and Satan's got his own thing what makes us different you look at Lucifer Lucifer's desire in the beginning you know he desired to have the glory like God he wanted God's power he wanted his glory he wanted his position he wanted his kingdom there's one thing about God Satan didn't aspire to be in he did not aspire to be God in his character he wanted power position Prestige he didn't want the character of God and that's What Makes You Different tonight amen it's not that you come to church it's not that you say Amen it's not all these those things are good they're fine but the character in your life in the midst of Chaos in the midst of rubble and darkness and confusion the character you demonstrate brother said we've been invited think about this it's an invitation tonight you've been invited to shape your character after his after Christ now the world doesn't look at that invitation and get real giddy about it you know if their favorite rock star or somebody invite them they'd be right there and here comes a notice you've been invited to have the character of Jesus Christ and like we'll see ya well who wants to do that I do you do what put that in you God put that in you your character must be proved because your time-tested memorials hey man so God will take the very works of Satan's Eden and use the chaos and use negative circumstances and use problems to prove that you are a time test Memorial you're not designed for this world Satan's Children are designed for this world you might you've not been designed for this world that's why you don't fit in there's nowhere in the plan for you you've been designed for the world to come I just don't know why I don't fit in you're not supposed to that shouldn't discourage you you should be so happy I'm so glad that there's no room for me in this building because I'm going to a greater one I'm going to a place where all these things cease to be so you look at the intent God is not like men God doesn't just do things on a whim or willy-nilly doesn't mince words everything that God did always has a specific intent behind it that's why the Bible says there's a purpose to everything under heaven amen So Divine intelligence gives Divine intent for a Divine Purpose your purpose is not like the rest you have a Divine Purpose there's prophecy that was spoke over your life before the worlds began and your purpose is a different kind of purpose your purpose is to glorify God in his character the scripture talks about Jerusalem in the Book of Ezekiel the 40th chapter the very end there it's time out in the time of restoration of things in the Millennium the worship and the oblation are restored in Israel and all these things and it's interesting because the Bible talks about this the very the very last part of that chapter the Bible says that the name of that City talk about Jerusalem the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there in Hebrew it's Jehovah shama the Lord is there and so this is this prophecy is given to Ezekiel during the time of the Captivity the Jews are in Exile they're looking towards their Homeland their their prisoners they're Exile their City walls are broken down everything's falling apart but yet there's given a promise that one day people will look at the city they're going to look at their lives they're going to look at what God has done saying you know what the Lord is there why because only God could do that we know God is there because only God could have performed and fixed that place up from what it was Jehovah shama the Lord is there it's a witness they could look at the architecture they could look at the intent and say you know what that's God's handiwork that's not what a man would do that's not what Satan would do that's God God is there the Lord is there Jehovah Shama we one day we're going to be in a New Jerusalem and the Bible says there'll be no need for a temple there because the Tabernacle of God is with men the Lamb of God and the Lord God Almighty they are the light of that City let me testify to you for me it won't be that the Lord is there it'll be that the Lord is here because I'm not going to be looking at it from the outside but people are going to look at where you're at people are going to look at where I'm at and say you know what that's where Jehovah is Jehovah shama the Lord is up there that city is not like every other City the Lord is in that City how do you know you look at house designed you look at the character of it it shows or proves who the architect is ah man praise the Lord Jesus himself he told his disciples I'm going to prepare a place for you hey man it's already there's already been preparations made I'm going to prepare a place for you that where you are I'll be there also Jehovah Shama he designed it so that you would cohabitate it with him he didn't design it for himself alone nor did he design for all of us to be there without him it doesn't work unless we're all there because the Lord is there and we're there praise the Lord all the materials already laying there the Bible says that second Corinthians the I believe it's the fifth chapter of this Earthly House of a tabernacle be dissolved we've got one waiting God's not waiting and pending upon your demise on this Earth it should should the Lord tearing you die he's not waiting for those that moment to say you know what I'm going to go fix them up a little place or get them an apartment no we've got a house we've got a body we've got something that's already waiting on us because you were designed for it amen we are not like the rest of the world we are like Abraham Abraham was looking for a city with foundations it's built on something it's not like the empty promises of this world but it's built on something a foundation whose city the city the Builder and maker of is God Abraham was looking for it Abraham seed looks for it today amen we're looking for new heavens and a new Earth praise the Lord that's why brother Raymond I want to really touch on this for a second brother Branham said that Christianity is not based on replacement but on Resurrection Amen in other words he's not going to get a new lump of clay he's not going to get a new you what he needs is there he's going to resurrect or bring to life or Quicken what's already laying there amen why because he cannot deviate from his original pattern because there was an intent behind it right so how God said he wanted to do it in the beginning is how God's going to do it in the Book of Genesis the first chapter and the 26th verse the Bible God he makes us he makes a declaration he makes a covenant he said that he he looked at man and he behold that man was good he said let man have dominion over the earth now listen when God spoke that the fall didn't change that the passage of time didn't change that sin did not change that God ordained for this Earth to come under the Dominion of a man and so it will be in the end because God can never leave the original design amen brother Brown says this in the future home message is 64. he says the Divine Architects praise the Lord say I didn't come up with it anyway the Divine architect has designed this for his beloved oh what a place it must be Hallelujah think about tonight friends what a place it must be when divine nature a Divine architect has designed it for a Divine attribute that's been divinely predestinated by a Divine God who's the author of Divine Life what will that City look like think of it remember it's not heaven Johnson John said I saw it coming down out of Heaven it's got to be on the Earth see not this Earth's gonna pass away it's a redeemed Earth God didn't say he was going to raise up a new generation he is going to redeem the one that's here saying this for a reason listen if God ordained you for that purpose no matter what you do you can't change that because you didn't start it you're not the author of it so you can't be the finisher of it if God designed you for that he can no more get rid of you than it could the Earth or the Sun or anything else hey man not this or it's going to pass it's a redeemed Earth God didn't say he was going to raise up a new generation he's going to redeem the one that's here he's going to raise up a new one he redeems the one he repeats himself so I'm not just amen he's gonna the one that's already here he ain't gonna make no new world it's this one right here he's just gonna burn it off and cleanse it like he did you and then he makes a statement I think this is really profound his plans must forever remain remember that his plans must forever remain that means his plans for you must always forever remain now his plan and what you look like might not always be the same thing that's where we get discouraged say well I don't look like I ought to look like well that's because he's not done yet hey man remember I I use this a lot God is always reliable but God is never predictable there's a difference God is reliable but he's not predictable he'll tell us something we know he'll bring it to pass but he'll never do it the way you and I think he's unpredictable his ways confound the wise but he'll do it all the sin and that's why I make this this I'm saying all this to make this point we're talking about Jehovah shama the Lord is there how do you know he's there the Harmony and the design shows that he made it the design shows us his architecture I think about the book of Exodus and and you look through the the first five books of the Bible the Torah and and God he begins to show Moses the plan one day for a tabernacle he designs a tabernacle with curtains it's supposed to be and I'm not going to go through all the particulars tonight because I couldn't remember it all anyway but you know there's Badger skins and there's curtains there's an outer Court there's the inner Court the ark all these things God designs us Moses doesn't sit down one day on top of the mountain with a scratch pad and a napkin say well you know what I I think this would be a good design and I will consult some Architects I'll get a couple of estimates made up that's not how this works God shows him the pattern and he if he follows the pattern God will bless him because he followed the pattern amen God's chosen it because God the architect he has a plan and and brother Graham talks about this he says that this Bible for us today this is the blueprint he says but the Holy Spirit fills it in for us it builds it up so if we want to look like what this says the Holy Spirit does the work in US amen I think about it again you read in the book of First Kings the sixth do we have any builders contractors whatever in here to show hands maybe a couple people God I'm I feel better now I could say whatever I want you wouldn't even know it's all about Joyce and that's the only word I know but you look in the book of First Kings the sixth chapter and Solomon is is building this Temple and we're probably hopefully we're all familiar with the story but David he he commissioned Solomon to build this Temple and he goes and gets Lumber and gets all these different things and he begins to build it and it's remarkable the prophet talks about it as well you know in the entire time that this work is done there was never the sound of an ax or a hammer there's no soul there was never the sound of any tools that was working in that Temple all the pieces were fabricated off-site and then they're brought to the temple and they're put together and I begin to think about this now again I'm not a professional but just from an engineering standpoint that's absolutely astounding to think that men could make pieces of wood and make pieces of pillar and then make these things and they bring them together and it fits together perfectly yeah listen that doesn't happen hey man listen not only is the pattern that's what I'm getting at Not only was the design perfect they never had to reach you know re-measure something or well this beam is going to be too high or this is that not only was the pattern perfect from the get-go but the workers human men human labors were so inspired by the blueprint they were so inspired by the plan of Solomon that he had from God that they themselves begin this perfect craftsmanship and when they breathe together everything fits perfect not not one thing and it's short not not one bit it's a it's perfect why because they got inspired by the one that designed it amen that's absolutely extraordinary especially to me because I can't put two pieces of wood together to save my life I gotta saw this and cut that and read about you praise the Lord but it fits together perfectly so much they don't have to make Corrections they don't have to fix anything because the design was so perfect they come under the same inspiration and I believe today this is why I say this that I believe today God is doing the same thing with his church with his bride amen we are Lively Stones the Bible says in a spiritual house and we're so honed by the spirit of God so there's no Schism or Gap and listen if God can do it with natural workers that's amazing then why do you think you can't do it with you and I today good yeah you believe the scripture the testimony of that temple being built that way and and Moses and all these different things if they were that inspired what do you think you're inspired by today the same one the same one's working in your life he has so designed you he is so working on each and there's not one Schism not one Gap you know that's something you hear a lot to do we hear it about it a lot you know the churches are divided the churches we've got denominations and groups and schisms and this and that even in the message we've got so many different divisions I want to remind you the church is not divided Paul says that in First Corinthians 12 Christ is not divided he's not men are divided people divide but the body of Christ is not divided if you're in the body of Christ it will fall into place perfectly no matter where you're at today he can bring you from Lebanon he can bring you from Syria it doesn't matter when it comes together it's going to fit perfectly not one more thing's got to be added or taken away it's perfect in design it's perfect in its execution amen amen praise the Lord I say this for a reason you and I aren't shaping the stones anyway God's doing the shaping amen God's the ones that's shaping this bill he's shaping you up amen because listen sometimes it seems impossible it seems absolutely impossible that God could reconcile people from every Kindred and tongue and nation and bring them together to make one body that seems impossible how do you get a bunch of people together for the Rapture they can't even get along when they go to church how you gonna do it Lord because he said what seems impossible to us it's possible it's just as possible as the as the Tabernacle in the wilderness it's just as possible as Solomon's Temple that God could take human beings with problems and faults and failures and take human beings and so Inspire them to make a perfect masterpiece why because he's the same architect today he's the architect of a greater world they had the Divine pattern then by David we have it today by the word of the Lord amen I think this is interesting First Chronicles 28 David's talking to Solomon now he's laid out the provision he's got gold he's got beams he's got everything laid out and at the end of all of this Solomon apparently has just made her he's worried well I understand why you're asking me to do something impossible I gotta do this perfect the first time there's no way and the Bible says David all this said David the Lord made me to understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern in other words David's like I didn't design this God did it and David said the Solomon said be strong of good courage in other words don't get worried be strong and of good courage and do it don't think about just go do what he said to do just go do it fear not nor be dismayed why for the Lord God even my God will be with me he will not fail thee nor forsaken until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord amen he lays all this out he tells his son all these things he's got all this know-how he says son don't be afraid I know it looks hard I know it looks impossible I know you have every reason to think it'll never work out but there is one reason it will work out my God is with you he will not fail thee he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you and if you're here tonight because God brought you here tonight let me remind you he will never leave you he will never forsake you and that's why you're more than adequate you're not adequate in your own ability you're not had to quit in your intellect but you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you you're not here tonight of your own accord the Bible says it's God that works in you both to Will and to do his good pleasure amen my am I I want to remind you tonight the same architect that designed the worlds with meticulous care he laid out the foundations the same God that designed these this Tabernacles the same one that designed the temple he's the same one that's gone to prepare a place for you you are not fashioned after this world but that which is to come amen and sometimes we like Solomon we get All Shook Up Lord how are you going to do in my life it seems like it seems like sometimes the the more I do it seems like it's it's harder you go through times we go through valleys because that's where the fruit is it's not all mountaintops sometimes we're going through maybe you're going through the worst situation in your life tonight maybe you've got more mind battles tonight maybe you've got more problems tonight than you've ever had before and you're sitting there wondering Lord I feel like I'm so far away from what you want to do in my life but listen he said I won't fail you I won't forsake you I'm gonna bring it to pass out of the worst circumstances we get All Shook Up how's it going to happen how am I going to make an erafter how am I going to do this sometimes we get so shook up we don't know how we're going to make it through the day but I want to remind you fear not don't be dismayed my God won't forsake you he won't fail you he had begun the work in you is faithful to complete your life your times have not been left a circumstance amen amen your life is not life just you're not just floating like Driftwood your life and times are not based on circumstance it's not based on winds it's not based on current events it's based on the will of God God's taking great care God has a great interest in your life to make sure you're shaped into his likeness in all things because he wants his character that's what he's looking for listen you and I get worried about God's not worried about it God's not worried about any of us tonight he's not up there ringing his hands in heaven we're down here writing his hands for that matter I just don't know how I'm going to get that one in there's no virtue and worry anyway we were how many times you worry about something and you worry and you lose sleep and you I don't know how it's going to be you're here tonight and that thing that you just thought was going to overwhelm you it's just a disc amen well I'll raise my hand amen listen if he brought you this far he's not going to leave you now he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't teach you to swim to let you down hey man oh but brother my life's a complete mess I've got all kinds of issues everything's going wrong let me remind you once more God excels at bringing order out of Chaos the very thing you look at and say it can't be is why it will be the very thing you let discourages the very evidence that God wants to do something in your life amen listen if he can take dry bones and make an army he can take your life and make a masterpiece he can take a look that's devastated and bring it back into order how many times has he made a way when there wasn't even a way he made a way but there was no way out when you're against the sea he made a way my my you know I've heard this for years men men took this message and they turned it into a mess well that might be true but that's not my testimony my testimonies my life was a mess and God sent me a message listen my life was a mess and God made it a message I'm not just preaching I am the message that God is still a redeemer God can still bring order when my life was a wreck he made it a testimony he made it a message your life is a message you're living Epistles you're right and known of omen other people can take it and do what they want but for me it's Jehovah shama the Lord is there when I look back at my life and I see where I'm at today when you look in your life and you see where you're at you say you know what the Lord is there the Lord did that in my life I didn't do that I can't do that but he has done what I could not do Jehovah Shama the Lord is there Hallelujah listen brother Brown was preaching about job one time I think he had him on the ice sheet for six weeks or six months so what are you gonna get him off the ass sheep there brother Brandon well you know I don't know it's time of decision he said listen maybe you I don't know what you're going through probably none of us going through what job went through but maybe you're going through something tonight listen job's friends showed up and after they showed up and I commend them you know they sat there seven days in silence think about that we make fun of him for what they said but think about how sincere they were they sat there for seven days and then they begin to speak and listen they didn't have to tell job listen job I think you're in trouble listen Joe I think you're going through a trial job job did not need someone to identify that he was going through listen job he got it the message was loud and clear well you think you're going through something Joe you think I'm going through something what do you mean you dumb or what of course I'm going through something I know what I'm doing listen he didn't need someone to tell him what he was going through we all know what our problems are you know tonight better than almost anybody else what your problem is what your situation what you're so you know what it is you don't need me to tell you job didn't need somebody to tell him what he was going through what he needed was somebody tell him why why am I going through this and his friends had a lot of ideas well I looked up this blueprint one time and I knew this guy and I met this guy one time I shook hands with a guy and I think this and I think that they all had ideas well I think this is why but God knew why well maybe God's mad at you Joe God was bragging about him listen you go through things sometimes think why am I going through this God's making a boast about you to the enemy there's a son of God there's a daughter of God they're a Time tested Memorial you can touch them you can hurt them you can put them through certain things it don't matter they will not deny me because they didn't start I put something in them listen God put something in brother random when his daughter died and his wife died he wanted to give up but he wasn't designed to give up and when he wanted to give up he found himself speaking the same thing job said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord why am I going through this Lord why that's the question we ask in other words what's the intention there's yeah you know I'm just speaking words in there what's the intent or purpose behind what I'm going through that's our question if we're all honest whatever you're going through that's your real question tonight you know what you're going through but Lord why am I going through this why Lord why do we live in such chaotic times why do we go through all these things why is the world so bad today but listen tonight you and I know why we know the Bible says all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose his intention his purpose that's why why am I going through this Lord people go through things all the time but you go through things for a particular reason all things work together for good no matter what it is no matter how bad it is all things work together for good to them that love God hallelujah to them who are the called according to his purpose we look at the intention and purpose of God's design our life and no matter what we go through like Lord I I don't know why Always I'm in this situation but I know alternates because it's for my good Ness amen I think it's really important why we do things why we do the things we do as humans even it reveals our intentions so many times what we're doing is not nearly as important as why we're doing it we can do all the right things for all the wrong reasons amen why do we do the things we do we have to ask ourselves well Lord why why do I feel this way why do we do this why we have to check but we know why God does all things work together you're designed by the architect of a greater world you're designed with purpose and power designed to be in His image it's funny you know it's funny because uh well I heard this statement years ago People Are People are funny you know like we're each these little clusters of drama and activity and lots of people they let the world passing by and they blame the system we we blame the church we blame our families we blame whoever everything that negative happens to us we've got to blame somebody but I'm saying this for a reason as Christians sometimes we blame ourselves and maybe you're supposed to but maybe not see Christians have this really I know it's Christians a lot of times they get frustrated with themselves because they possess this unique capacity that the world doesn't possess the capacity to look at what you've done and repent because you could be wrong because the world doesn't do that the world doesn't sit there well you know maybe I'm wrong about this no they they always think they're right you actually sit there and say maybe I was wrong about that because you acknowledge that there's a possibility you could be wrong sometimes you assume you're wrong even when you're not sometimes you sit there and you beat yourself up hey man you get discouraged you know it's like the disciples at the Last Supper each one of them sat there Lord is it I is it me am I the one that's wrong well they weren't all wrong in that sense amen sometimes when something's amiss in our own lives sometimes we we blame ourselves we're looking we were the first one and listen that's better than assuming everyone else is wrong first don't get me wrong but sometimes it's not that you did anything wrong sometimes it's not your fault sometimes it's just the purpose of God amen for you that feel that weight tonight I want to encourage you have patience with God because he is the one bringing everything in divine order in your life no matter what you're dealing with no matter what your problem is let me remind you that the Lord is there he's Jehovah Shama let patience have a perfect work in you the Bible says it's through faith and patience we inherit the promises the Bible says you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you did the right thing that you might receive the promise brothers and sisters we endure many things in life everybody does but you and I are called to endure them patiently amen sometimes we're very quick to lose patience but the Bible says the husbandman of this Earth he waits with long patience for the fruit of it amen you know you look at the time it took to complete Solomon's Temple I think it was seven years you look at all these different things I ask myself and you you can disagree if you want I guess but you look at the time that God takes in the original creation he takes thousands of years and he does all these things and I I began to pray about it one day I'm like why did God take so much time in the creation why God can he could do it all at once right I mean he's able to do anything why does God take all this time to do it because some things are worth taking time for that's why when you take your time with something and you're applying your time to it the passage of time it allows transformation to take place it's an Evidence of your care it's an evidence that you are investing into something you take time with your children because they're important to you you take time for a project that you care about at work or at home because it's important to you so God does it as an Evidence of his care in your life so why isn't God done working in my life today because he wants to work on the whole thing because you're that important to him so he takes his time amen his time is an Evidence of his care for you listen God likes the way he designed he doesn't like the fall he doesn't like the consequences but he likes the real you God think about that tonight there's something about you God likes you know some of you feel like God loves you but maybe doesn't like you you know because we do that with people sometimes well I know God listen God likes certain things about you he likes the way you sing at church he likes the way you think about somebody that nobody else thinks about he likes the way you pray he likes the way you smile when he makes you he likes certain things about you God is not discouraged with you God is not as quick to give up on you as we are on him Nehemiah did not give up and I'm bringing this to head here but he did not give up because there was problems in rubbish amen I want to encourage you to have patience with God have patience with each other have patience with yourself amen amen well why can't I be this way because it's not maybe the time yet have patience with yourself sometimes that's the hardest person for us to have patience with we look at everybody else you know I I can't remember who said this I heard a man say this one time the problem is we we see every blooper in our life and watch everybody else's highlight reel we see the best parts of their life and we see the worst parts of ours and we sometimes we get discouraged and we lose patience that patients have a prefer perfect work in your life amen don't worry about criticisms when Nehemiah went to build this wall sandblot Tobias they got together you know what they said they said if a fox would run on this wall it would fall over God's Bill not that don't look that impressive but Nehemiah he was called on the by the Lord to to rebuild this the Bible says the people rebuilt the wall because they had a mind for the work and you know what happened to the critics they started getting worried maybe the critics in your life maybe they're laughing today well he don't look like much she ain't she don't amount to much but God begins to do something in your life oh Fox would knock that over the next thing you know God begins to work in your life and God begins to turn the situation around and the critics now they're getting worried oh my they got desperate because they realized criticism wasn't going to stop the work don't let criticism in your life stop the work you keep building you keep laboring your labor is not in vain he is not forgetful of your labor of love by the time they get done building the Bible says all the Heathen round about they looked at Jerusalem Jehovah's there Jehovah shama they looked at it and they realized they perceived the Bible said that the work was wrought of God even the enemies had to testify God did that you live such a life until even your enemies can look and say you know what God did that and they have to acknowledge it it's just a matter of time until your enemy realizes there's nothing he can do to stop God in you as the musicians would come tonight there's not one thing the enemy can do to stop you God started it God's gonna finish it I want to encourage you tonight like Nehemiah wherever you're at tonight let us rise up and build let us as a church as a peoples Believers no matter where you're at from if you're home listening if you're here tonight let us rise up together not let me the minister rise up let you let us join together let us join together in prayer let's join together in this word and stand shoulder to shoulder and rise up above this unport generation rise up above Satan's Eden you don't have to live here you were designed to Fly Above It let's stand shoulders let's be used of God tonight you young people you owe people whoever you are let God use you let God use you where you're at tonight one of the worst things we can do in our life is not let God use us we can we can be blessed we can have favor with people we can go to church let's let God use us God's trying to build something he's an architect but he needs some hands he needs your hands he needs your mouth that's his plan love one another be patient with one another believe in the work join together in the work not a not an ecclesiastical or a church the work of God is so much greater than any one of our lives and yet our lives are a result of the work of God amen have patience with yourself with god with others tonight God is faithful I mean let's bow our heads o precious Lord and savior masterful Redeemer or as we bow our heads reverently tonight toward you believing that you live in the lives in the hearts of these children are yours Lord I ask that you would just give a greater witness of this work Lord may we never deviate from this pattern this plan may we not go to the left or to the right but may we stay fastened upon this word in a day in a generation when everyone is compromised when everyone does right in their own eyes maybe take a little bride here a little group out of every Kindred and tongue Nation a people that hear the testimony like those people heard of nehemiah's testimony May stir their hearts and encourage them that we could say together in one voice let us rise up not to destroy but to build for the building is ordained of the most high God foreign each life there's different needs here present tonight we know of different needs loved ones maybe we're looking at a lost loved one tonight maybe we're looking at a wayward soul that we've prayed for for years wanna Lord can you still reach them is there still a soul to be saved there's still something to be done but Lord you look at the worst situations and find masterpieces Lord you excel at bringing order out of chaos you you take the diamonds and they're off and you make them just Shine for you Lord bless us tonight bless the different needs may it be for your purpose and your glory may we submit ourselves wholeheartedly unto it father these people as they go from this place tonight may they never leave your presence Lord your presence in our life makes all the difference your presence in our life is what allows us to finish this work [Music] bless them I pray father we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen God bless you go
