[music and singing] You may be seated this morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you. If I [singing] could make just one request that would [music and singing] mark all the days I have left. I'd rather [singing] not be [music] known for treasures and fame or trophies and [singing] colors I know will fade. Instead, I would rather [singing] be known [music] by the kindness and love [singing] that I show. to be [music and singing] known for patience and longsuffering. A giver of life [singing] by the words [music] that I speak. So [singing] with every breath you give to me, I pray it's [singing] your glory that they see. And of all the words this world could say, may they say I [singing] am full of grace. [music] I'll be the first to confess I'm not always found at my best. But Lord, [singing and music] be my strength in those moments I'm weak. And I'll keep on [singing] giving the grace I've [music] received. So with every breath you give [singing] to breathe, I pray it's your glory [singing] that they see. [music] And of all the words [singing] this world could say, may [singing and music] they say I am full of grace. [music] Oh. [singing] Oh. Oh. [singing] Oh. [singing and music] And finally [singing] when I see your face and I've reached the end [singing] of my race. [music] I don't [singing] want to [music] be known for finishing strong, but as [music] someone [singing] that your grace carried all along. [music] So with every breath [singing] you give to I pray is your glory that they see. And of all the words this world could say, may [singing] they say, "I am full of grace." [singing] Oh. Oh. [singing] [music] Oh. Oh. Oh. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let them say that of us. &gt;&gt; May I be full of grace. May I enter in that place where he says, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant. that we were full of grace. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Bran sisters. Missing two of them. Um had to go two had to go back to work um back to Quebec. But it's good to have the anointed [music] music. And of course on the music app for the church, Fountain House, you can find all the music and theirs is [music] the most recent on there. And it's been such an incredible blessing to many already. So, if you want to hear all the four girls, um we'd certainly uh encourage you to get on [music] that and listen to it. And uh it's been kind of a we're having brother Steve from Quebec today and his wife and family been in all of the pet a lot of the petites. Most of them have been [music] in town. We have some of them moved here and then because this is in between looks like this might become the place they come in for Christmas. So, I'm calling it the Petite Brassan invasion or the French invasion. That sounds more like a war or something like the French invasion. But good families and good to have [music] him with us and we're looking forward to the word this morning and uh we appreciate their lives through the years. He was back here doing a family series [music] for us uh in the summer and we certainly enjoyed it. It's been a great blessing to us and we look forward to the word [music] uh this uh today. I wanted to say how much joy I got out of the service last Sunday as we What a blessed time to celebrate. What a way uh can't think of a better way to celebrate [music] this time and uh we trust you had a merry Christmas with your family, a good time of worship and also just being together. But last Sunday, [music] it gave me great joy to worship the Lord that way. But you know what? To be able to shine the light all of us together on [music] ears that haven't heard, uh eyes that haven't seen to to spread the light like that. I went home and I couldn't sleep. I felt [music] such joy. You know, you want to find joy in life, share what you have with somebody else. It's not in money. Can you say amen? It's not even in the presents. [music] You know, Chris, you know, if you do give your children gifts, the kids like the gifts, but we shouldn't get all the joy out of that. Our joy ought to be sharing the greatest gift that's ever [music] come to us. And that's this word in the last days, Christ revealed. And uh boy, it just thrilled my heart to be able to do that. and all of the atmosphere and just whatever it was. Can't say enough about it. We just get great joy out of sharing with so many ears that's listening. If you're a visitor this morning, God bless all of you and all the visitors from out of town. [music] God bless each one of you. It's good to have you and the house of the Lord. I wanted to also say happy birthday to my brother. um I wouldn't have enough time to share all that my brother Isaac has contributed behind the scenes and also out front for [music] he was one of the first ones here move moved here with me some 35 years ago I guess it was and he's been [music] with me from the start and he has helped do everything that we do in so many areas I couldn't mention all of them and I want to say I appreciate him I think his daughter said it well she's probably going to beat me up for reading this this morning but she [music] sent this to the family and I think it expresses Isaac well. She said, "Happy birthday to my dad." And we'll just say this is from all of us if if she doesn't mind. This year brought unexpected trials, but through every one of them, you chose obedience over fear. Listening closely to what God [music] has was asking and stepping forward in faith. You build a thriving business that now blesses churches across the country. [music] You wrote a book that musicians say has transformed the way they think. Now reaching hearts around the world. You chose your health, losing 100 pounds, you're way ahead of me, [applause] and showed us and showed us what discipline [music] and stewardship look like. Most of all, you've kept our family rooted in God, steady and faithful, [music] no matter what trials the enemy tried to place in our path. I'm so proud of you. And Ike, we are so proud of you. And you know what? She said it perfect. She said it perfect. We love you. We appreciate you on your birthday today. May God abundantly bless you for the years of labor that you've given to this church, the ministry, and around the world. [applause] We love [cheering] you. [applause] Praise the Lord. And even though you asked for lights to be put on the drum [music] thing for Christmas and I said no, of course, the drums always already have enough connotation to them. We don't need to put lights on them for sure. But uh what a joy to be able to work through u my brother who has given so much and as I said to this [music] church but also the kingdom of God and now continues to travel out and help with many areas of the church not only sound but also some other areas of teaching [music] as well. So we appreciate you so much. Praise the Lord. We're going to stand and invite our minister this morning. God bless you all for being [music] faithful to the house of God. those that are listening online and we uh this moment is the most important moment in life when we just say Lord I am hungry. How many would raise your hand say I'm hungry for the word of God. I'm hungry to hear from God this morning. [music] If you'll hold that before him this is the most important part of our lives that he would have something to deposit to me this morning. I come you know I get my mind off I'm the pastor so I'm thinking well [music] who's here and who's not here. I've learned to shut all that out. you you God knew who would needed to be here. You're here this morning, but God's here. That's the main thing. And so I shut it all out. I shut out the pressures. I shut out everything because this moment, he would have something for me. And I want it. I want it for all of you. But I want it for myself, [music] too. Whatever God has for me. I don't know care if you're a teenager. I don't care if you're 10 years old. I don't care if you're care if you're 80 years old. [music] All of us need one thing. Man, Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God." So this moment, say, "Lord, speak to me. Fill my heart. Feed my heart. [music] I need it, Father." Don't try to get in on your parents. Don't try to do that if you're young. Just say, "But God, you can give something to me this morning. You can you can fulfill my heart. You can fill my heart with something [music] from the word." And uh I think that's important. You know, Brother Ed, you gave a late prayer request [music] there, and we'll just take that right now. Brother Ed got in a little late and he said a very close friend found out [music] they have masses on their lung. She's knocking on God's door and I [music] pray for peace and finding her finding the Lord. Our precious [music] heavenly father, brother Ed has stood in the gap for this friend, Lord. There's [music] masses, Lord, on her throat. And we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you will intervene. you'll step in, [music] Lord, that you show that you care for her, Father. You already did when you took the stripes upon [music] her back. So, I pray, Lord, you'll bring healing to her body. Lord, as she reaches out [music] to you, I pray you'll touch her and she'll give her heart to you, Lord, as well. The greatest healing that can [music] take place. But Lord, come along and be mindful of her need and her cry for help this morning. We stand all as a congregation in the gap for her. Touch her, bless her, [music] be with her, Lord, and heal her, we pray. And we commit it in the name of the Lord Jesus [music] Christ. Amen. Everybody said amen. Amen. [singing] Holy are you Lord God Almighty. Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is [music] the lamb. You are holy. Can we lift our hands and worship him? The lamb this [music] morning. Holy. [singing] Just close it all out. Worship the Lord. You Lord [music] God Almighty. [singing] Hallelujah. Worthy [music] is the lamb. Worthy is [singing] the lamb. You are holy. [music] [singing] Sing it one more time. [music] Holy, [singing] holy [music] are you, Lord [music and singing] God Almighty. Worthy is [music] the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. You are [music] holy. Holy God Almighty. [music] Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is [music and singing] the lamb. You are holy. [music] Hallelujah. Amen. How many are happy to be in [music] the house of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Certainly serve the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly happy to be with you. And as our brother said, this is the French invasion. [music] We've been undercover since a little while. It's becoming obvious now, but we first sent our sweetest undercover agent in Sister Miriam, which [music] took a key position in the church, got really close to the pastor. Then we sent a second layer, you know, in Francis and Rachel, and they're about to be deployed into a key position as well. And after that, [music] we started a third wave with Ann and Josh. So we came here for Christmas just for inspect the troops. Everything was tight and [music] so it's a blessing because they've been Francis was in Edmonton and Ann were in Phoenix and is expensive to celebrate Christmas together. So this is the [music] kind of central place we can drive. So we had a great week this weekend this week with the family and so it's a blessing and this church is already a blessing. Brother Paul, the [music] the the church, the ministry, the music ministry has also been such a blessing for my daughters to be able to find confidence and a place that they can grow. And then brother Kenny and Ike has [music] been such a instrumental and give them confidence and they became uncle Kenny and Uncle Ike for my daughters. [music] And so it this is really really precious, you know, to build friendship through the years. Brother Paul, I love you dearly. I consider you a close friend of mine. And and so this is this this is really precious. And so obviously when brother Paul [clears throat] said, "Well, if you're around, do you want to minister?" Yes. I says, "Yes, of course. It'd be a privilege to [music] share the word again with you." Amen. So we had we had a great week. He said, "I want to congratulate also Solomon and his wife for the new new baby on Christmas. Is that is that something?" Right. Right away my thought was about money like this. you you save money, you know, because you just give one gift and you save on the cake also. You you know, you get a Christmas log, you put a candle on it. So, I thought that's pretty efficient as uh congratulation. Congratulation. Amen. So, we will turn in our Bible this morning and the book of Deuteronomy chapter 18. We wanted to go home tomorrow, but there's a huge storm sitting in Eastern Canada, and it's going to hit quite hard, especially in Quebec. So, you might have to stay another day extra to be safe. I want to entitle this this morning as you turn to Deuteronomy chapter um 18. I want to entitle this as uh I've just hooked my computer. I want to entitle this the greatest purpose. And as a subtitle I want to title this the prophet test. The prophet test. And so we will read Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 18. I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth. And he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my word, which he shall speak in my name, I will require of him. But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I shall have not commanded him to speak or thy shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. And if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know that the word which the Lord hath not spoken? When the prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, and the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken. But the prophet has spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him. Amen. Let's bow our head. Lord Jesus, we want to thank you. Such a privilege to be gathered in your house this morning. And Lord, it's it's it's it's a blessing. We we know you are here. It's a promise. We feel your presence through the worship to the special. And Lord, now you want to move in our midst through your word. Take control Lord this morning over every heart, every spirit on our own thought &gt;&gt; and have your way Lord we pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. These this morning a couple of service combined together. So I will some some are some part of the sermon I will just give the highlight because you know you've been well taught. I know for sure you've been well taught in the word. And so I will some part of the service I will hit the highlight because I want to reach a certain point. And so I want to talk a little bit this morning as we uh enter into this uh God has gave us keys to discern prophets but also men of God to discern spirits when we talk especially about prophets obviously we know we've received a prophet in our age and sometime it had become lately you know it become question and people start questioning this and it becomes at one point some brings some confusion to the people and at one point they they they they're trying to find a way to like to to be sure that where they stand and what do we believe in and and and so we fall back into this scripture which is called you know we it's it's it's the prophet test because God this is the way that God speak and and you can you can leave my PowerPoint on if if it's okay uh because I'm I'm I'm going to move quickly through those slides. And so we for many years we've looked at Deuteronomy 18 as the prophet test and something that we can rely on to see if if God speak through a man. If somebody comes and say he speaks in the name of the Lord, this is this is the reliable test. Like what if if what if he what he says will come to pass then you can believe him. But you we have instances in the in the Bible, let's just take Jonah Jonah for for for a minute where he he he went through the city and prophesied that the city would be destroyed in in 40 days. &gt;&gt; He didn't say if you don't repent, go look at the scripture. He says that city will be destroyed in 40 years, thus says the Lord. But it never happened within 40 days. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when the prophet spoke, he spoke the mind of God at that moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God saw the people's reaction. And when people repented, &gt;&gt; God said he found grace. And so we could say Jonah was a false prophet because what he said didn't happen. &gt;&gt; But he spoke the mind of the Lord at that time. And we know that God doesn't change his mind because you know that city was destroyed later but God give gave grace to those people and delayed the word. &gt;&gt; Same thing happened for the king Ezekiah. We say in French Ezekas sometime those it's a bit hard to find the right name how they translate it in English. But that that king got prophesied by the by by a prophet Isaiah that he would die. prepare your house because you're going to die. But then he cries out to God. When he cries out to God, Isaiah is not even out of the court, God says, "Turn around &gt;&gt; now. Go say something else." &gt;&gt; And so when we focus so much on that scripture that if what he says come to pass, then that's like this is the only test. But it's not the only test. &gt;&gt; It's something deeper than that. Right. &gt;&gt; Now the other test is Deuteronomy 13. The the Bible says um if he if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he giveth thee a sign of our wonder and the sign of the wonder come to pass. So if we think that the only sign if what he says happened then and we must listen to him then God says wherever he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them thou shalt not hearken unto the word and so but that prophet what he prophesied happened but the other test is where is he pointing at where does he want to lead you &gt;&gt; because God says he has spoken. He has spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God. So it's not just signs and wonders or prophecy that are fulfilled, but the the other test is also where is he pointing at? Where does he leads you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is he building in and that that prophet test is not just for prophet, it also from ministers, &gt;&gt; you know, where is he pointing at? He can be a good preacher. He can lay out the word, but where what is he trying to build? Is he trying to build his own kingdom or he's bringing in you to Christ? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that brings us into the New Testament which I call the New Testament prophet test. And that prophet test or that spirit test is first John 4 verse one where it says believe beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone into the world. &gt;&gt; Thereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in flesh is of God. And every spirit that confessed not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that the spirit of the antichrist. &gt;&gt; So now we have another another key that's been given to us to test whatever a man of God or or or a prophet is is sent from God is that if he confess that Jesus Christ has come into flesh. Now when when John said that it was relevant because in that time a lot of people denied that you know Jesus was more than a special man that he was a he was a prophet but he was you know God made flesh and so you had people that deny that they wanted to stay with Moses they wanted to stay with the law but right now in the modern Christianity you you don't really find any people that will deny that &gt;&gt; but still a A lot of those modern Christianity portrayed a false religion Babylon but they don't deny that Jesus Christ came into flesh. So sometime we see that scripture says yeah that would work then but it doesn't work now because this is now how we discern because there's so many people out there that are talking about Jesus Christ came into flesh and all that. And so it it becomes like a bit of trick. He's like is that scripture still relevant? &gt;&gt; Can we still apply that scripture? And and lately when I started studying those things as you know uh in our area people started asking questions and doubting and all that I dove and start to study that and share it with also with another pastor and it was a it was a great study. I came to realize that that scripture didn't talk about historical Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So the fact that you recognize that one day in the past that Jesus Christ came into flesh is not the test. But the test is be able to recognize Jesus Christ in the flesh today. &gt;&gt; Because the Satan has no problem pointing in the past. &gt;&gt; You've done this, he's done that, he's been here, he's been there. Yeah, no problem. But Satan will always fight the manifestation of Christ in our day. &gt;&gt; And that's been a trap laid in every generation from ages to ages. every age fell that trap, they would recognize the Christ manifestation of the past. But missing Christ Christ manifested in our day. And when when I say that some of you is like, "Yeah, Christ manifested in our day was manifested in to a prophet." And I mean if that's what that's where your mind went when I said that you've been trapped &gt;&gt; because what what John refer is referring here he's saying so this is the same scripture but he said then he points where Christ is the next verse is ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. So, we're not looking even though we appreciate and we've found the keys in in finding Christ being manifested in somebody else's life and and in a prophet and God is manifested in your pastor, which is great and you can recognize that. But the key is that you want to see Christ manifested in your life because if he's not in your life, you've missed the greatest purpose of all. That's my title this morning, the greatest purpose. &gt;&gt; My subtitle, the prophet test. But I'm not preaching on prophets this morning. My burden is to preach about you because it was all about you. That's what God had in mind before the foundation of the world. And this is what the ministry of mystery of God is finished. What was the mystery? Sometime we get caught up into mysteries, you know. Well, there was this, there were that, and we we're having in our mind information. Even the seals sometime people think that's information. Well, we learn who was the white horse and we learn about this and we learn about that. But the real mystery of God is not about learning. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Even though we appreciate learning, &gt;&gt; we need to know these things. It's and it's all good. But we can have our heads filled with knowledge, good, awesome, great knowledge that makes your brain explode. But if you miss the mystery of God, you've missed the greatest purpose of God in your life. &gt;&gt; So the prophecies, Revelation 10, the mystery of God should be finished at the voice of the seventh angel. And I don't want to dwell on those things. That's the highlight I'm going to hit. I'm going to go really quickly because you've been taught these things. I'm using that to go somewhere else. So the greatest thing the mystery of God should be finished. So what is the mystery of God? You know that we then right away we go to Colossians verse chapter 1 verse 26 that the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generation &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest to his saints to whom God would made known in what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the Gentile which is Christ in you. So that is the mystery, the mystery of Christ. Where is Christ? Christ was in a prophet. Christ is was in his is in his bride. But it's it's it has to get personal. Where is he today? It's still a mystery. He's been revealed personally to you. &gt;&gt; Even Revelation 10 finished with you have to eat the book which the book the seals prophet seals is Christ. Those seals are Christ. The book is Christ. &gt;&gt; These are all symbols. But sometime we get lost in symbols. &gt;&gt; But they're not symbols anymore because they got revealed. God hides. When it's a mystery, it's in symbol forms. &gt;&gt; But when it's not a mystery anymore, we know what it is. So we know the book of redemption is Christ. Our name was in the book before the foundation of the world. It means we were in his we were in his mind before the foundation of the world. So if we have to eat the book like Revelation 10:10 says, it means that we have to have Christ in us which is the greatest purpose of all ages that was hidden but reveal in the end time. It's not to have church membership. It's not to become friends with the pastor or a great man of God of know everything about him. It's to have to know that Christ is in me. The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even Thessalonians revealed to us that when Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels which were seven then right away that scripture goes into verse 8 verse 9 which talk about vengeance and punishment. And so sometime we miss that scripture because we're like well this is not the judgment day but we we know that when that headstone comes down the bride says grace grace &gt;&gt; but during that season tribulation sets on earth it's also judgment &gt;&gt; the prophet says judgment hit the the west coast the bride is not under that judgment but slowly it's it's it's it's progressively entering into tribulation with judgment is going to start hitting the earth and it started in 64. It's a change in the season. But for the bride, we are not seeing that scripture of fllaying fire taking vengeance who shall be punished with everlasting destruction. That doesn't apply to the bride. What applies to the bride is verse 10 and verse 12. So if we use the scripture and skip 8 and n which doesn't apply to the bride I skip eight and nine. Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels when he shall come to be glorified where &gt;&gt; in his saints to be admire in all them that believe in that coming that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you which which accomplish which brings the revelation of the greatest mystery of God which is Christ in us. And so that was the purpose of that message. &gt;&gt; And so if we go back to the prophet test, the prophet test is you want to discern a prophet, you want to discern spirits. &gt;&gt; The test is what was the climax of that man? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What was the climax of the prophet's ministry? all the healings and all the teaching that all his ministry was not about that. It was about a climax and the climax was to be able to point to Christ but not just Christ up there but Christ coming down but coming down where Christ in the bride and so if you can summarize the ministry of a man and try you don't have to be an expert in bridge building you don't have to become an archaeologist you don't have to be an expert in US history all you have to do is to bring to filter a ministry ministry, a prophet ministry through the scriptures, what was he trying to do? How can we summarize his whole ministry? And if his whole ministry and the climax of everything he did was to point to Christ in in in human flesh, then you meet first John 4 test prophet test. &gt;&gt; Some people want to judge if that prophecy has been accomplished. Has that one's been fulfilled? And how do you know? You're not the one who spoken it. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; We would need to disqualify Jonah because he said it would be destroyed &gt;&gt; and it didn't happen because something else moved in the scene and people got repented and then the king repented and God says, "Okay, I'm delaying this." But we are not we're not witness of what's going on when God speaks something through a prophet, what's going on in heaven. and what that word cause a reaction and then people change and they do this and God says okay since you've done that I'll send this prophet again or things are moving but we've seen many for many years we've seen prophecy like a concrete block &gt;&gt; but God is alive and he's working with his people and sometime he sends a word because that's like a picture of that moment at that moment this is what God is saying &gt;&gt; but then people move They repent. &gt;&gt; They adjust because God has spoken. God God is like I don't want to sound sacriiggious, but God is dancing with you. He's alive. He's moving with you. He's not rigid like a concrete block like the law. &gt;&gt; He's alive. &gt;&gt; So when he sends his word, he sees your reaction. &gt;&gt; But we've seen the word as something that is is not moving. And now we can disqualify true men of God because they said something but later on it turn into something else. &gt;&gt; So this is not the prophet test. &gt;&gt; It is partially &gt;&gt; but the the real New Testament prophet test is where that minister where does that prophet points the people to &gt;&gt; and what is his greatest purpose? &gt;&gt; You even finished the seven church age book and he at the end he's there. I'm not here to create a following. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to build denomination. I am here to build a strong relationship between the people and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the pinnacle of his ministry is when he preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Then he lays out the three great purposes of God hidden from ages and generation. It's been hidden. It's been fought. Satan has fought every age. &gt;&gt; And every age has fallen into trap of of of of of be able to see only God manifested in their messengers. &gt;&gt; It was like God was in Luther. My we built a church around him. We created a movement around him. He was such a great man of God. But they miss because if Christ were in them, they would have moved in next with Wesley and then they would have recognized Isa Street because Luther was there to bring them to Christ &gt;&gt; and then Christ would lead you to more light and every ages fall in that trap. &gt;&gt; They did recognize their messenger. &gt;&gt; But today in 2025, that's not the challenge. That's right. &gt;&gt; The challenge is to recognize where is Christ &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; And yes, of course, it went to men like Luther and Wesley and Aza Street and William Brham and all these great men of God. There's been a restoration. There's been there's been a building, but to hit a climax and the climax is you and Christ together, this invisible union. Hallelujah. So the first purpose was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people. &gt;&gt; He wanted so badly and this is if you feel my motive this morning. It's it's it's to bring this this awareness cuz we can caught we can get caught up into churches and this and that and this one says this and then then we get lost in the purpose and when we lose the real purpose we fall into religion &gt;&gt; and we don't want religion. We want something alive and that life is a personal relationship. Yes, brother so and so can do this and sister so and so can do. God bless her heart. She's led this way. But what is God asking you? What is the manifestation of the spirit of God in your life? &gt;&gt; God is not a cookie cutter where everybody's going to be the same. But for many years, we wanted people to be the same. &gt;&gt; You see that quote and we use quotes like a cut a cookie cutter. forgetting that that the word is alive and the and and Christ when he gets in your life, he will use you the way you've been brought up in your personality. I have my own personality. I'm not like brother Paul &gt;&gt; and he's not like me. And God doesn't want us to be the same. &gt;&gt; But we fellowship with the differences knowing that God is using him. He's using me and he wants to use you. And you don't have to pattern yourself about somebody else or another minister or another deacon. Well, that church, the deacons though, they do this, this, and that. Bless their heart. If it works for them, great. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean it's going to work here. &gt;&gt; Well, how are we going to know? God wants to reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; So, that's the desire of God. He wants to reveal himself to the people. The second purpose is to have the preeeminence. Now every age fell in almost every age fell in that trap that the messenger had the preeeminence which was not the desire of God. The desire of God is that Christ would have the preeminence in his body of believers that his bride that he might live in his people &gt;&gt; which is the greatest purpose of God which is revelation 10 in Colossians chapter 1. He wants to be in you &gt;&gt; and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its righty position. If you want to summarize the prophet's purpose, Christ because that was not his own purpose. He would have been a hillbilly and and and probably a drunker like his dad. &gt;&gt; But God saved him from that. &gt;&gt; Cuz he had a purpose. &gt;&gt; So he sent this man with no schooling, no good background for a purpose. And that purpose is summarized here &gt;&gt; to let us know that. &gt;&gt; Don't you think the devil will let us go like that without a fight? &gt;&gt; Right in the days of Paul, Paul knew the mystery of iniquity does already work. Amen. &gt;&gt; As he's speaking, as he establishing the church, that spirit is already crawling &gt;&gt; to to switch to shift the focus. &gt;&gt; And it's been a fight in every age. Shift the focus. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Shift the focus. &gt;&gt; And already in the book of Revelation in the first age, the second age, they talk about the deeds of the nicicoatans. And and you know that it's I'm still trying to hit the highlights. And from the deeds it became the doctrine &gt;&gt; and the doctrine of the nicolate and and and history thought that that was like a group of people that were really bad at founded a religion and all that. Actually, we know that the meaning is to to conquer ley &gt;&gt; and conquer ley is to remove the manifestation of Christ in your life and to put it solely onto into inside of a perfect saint in front of you that everyone admires. &gt;&gt; And that's been the fight in all ages, all seven ages. That spirit would would never if if if if you recognize a holy man, if you recognize a prophet and he cannot shift you away from that, he wants to remove the presence of Christ in your life and say, "Well, how great was he?" Huh? &gt;&gt; To conquer ley is to remove the manifestation to remove Christ out of your life. And if you're sitting in church, he will put you and if he cannot send you away from church, he will allow you to be sitting there crossarm admiring the manifestation of Christ in your pastor. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's such brother Paul, man, that's such a a man of God. And that church, man, is so amazing. What about you? I don't know. &gt;&gt; You've been tricked &gt;&gt; because brother Paul has been sent. This church's been sent. But why? right &gt;&gt; to promote &gt;&gt; to push a manifestation in your life. But that spirit that right away Paul he call it the mystery of iniquity &gt;&gt; that was the first horse rider &gt;&gt; and either horse rider is still here but today it's different because today it's spiritual death because if not Christ is not in you &gt;&gt; you're going into the tribulation &gt;&gt; into the day of judgment. But if Christ is in you then you have a call come up higher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's exactly when you talk about con to conquer ley that's exactly what the first horse rider did because that's first horse rider came he was dressed in white so he's tricky you think he's a good guy but he's not and a crown is given unto him but he went for conquering and to conquer which those two words so he went to nikao and to nika &gt;&gt; which is nicolatan so he went to conquer But he went to conquer who &gt;&gt; the ley. &gt;&gt; And what was the purpose? How does he conquer? Remove Christ out of your life. Remove the spiritual leading. God wants to lead sons of God by the spirit of God. But he wants to remove that. You sitting there and you can admire. Oh, praise the Lord. This brother is led. Wow. Praise the Lord. This pastor is doing such a great work. But what about you? Christ wants to come establish himself inside of you the temple of God and live inside of you, fellowship with you, lead you, activate those gifts that for you to be grace, grace, mercy for your generation that you become Jesus walking in flesh. And that is the purpose of God. That's why the prophet says, I didn't come to create a following people that's going to admire me. Even though we admired him, &gt;&gt; but it doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; Because there's a greatest purpose. &gt;&gt; But it's been tricky. Oh, it's been tricky. Every age has been tricked. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says Paul saw it coming, but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines. He knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry. &gt;&gt; And even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit, there is not too much freedom in the lady. And the best day we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just flocks just sits there and tried to absorb this. This is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the problem is that it happened in every age. One at one point the messenger is used by God to promote Christ and the people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when Satan takes over, he'll use the messenger to kill the movement of the spirit in people's life. &gt;&gt; You imagine one day somebody that was in the Lutheran church felt the leading and it it is hard. It's like I don't think it's right to smoke cigars. &gt;&gt; I know our messenger did, but &gt;&gt; I feel in my heart that God is holy and we have to be different. And you see an elder that's Lutheran say, "You go sit down." Our messenger was smoking. So who are you? &gt;&gt; Where do you come from? But the Holy Spirit wanted to move deeper in the word. Deeper in the word. But now that spirit's taking control and using the same messenger that God is using, but now using it to kill the revival. &gt;&gt; It happened all the time. &gt;&gt; They try to destroy Jesus ministry with Moses. that was a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; They did the same thing with John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, they found there were 65,000 followers of John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; 2003 &gt;&gt; called a mendin or something like that. All dressed in white, all about purification. They still baptized, but for them Jesus is a fraud. &gt;&gt; Jesus is an impostor. The prophet said the first coming and the second second coming will be parallel in every way. &gt;&gt; But they found their security and their safety. In John the Baptist, he was their messenger. We feel safe. &gt;&gt; We're with the right guy. &gt;&gt; We're with the right guy. With him, we feel safe. &gt;&gt; But as you said lately, we fellowship on that. He was not the light, &gt;&gt; but he testified to the light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even Martin Luther said, "The Pope and his bishops have nothing to do but impose burdens on souls and strip them of their possession instead of guiding them to Christ, which is the prophetess. Where do you lead people?" But he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by the holy priesthood. Nor is there a place there where they are separate in their worship of the Lord. God wants all to love and serve him together. Nicoleism destroyed those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and make the leaders overlord instead of servants. Now I want to switch into my part two. Why is it this way? Why it why is this a pattern? &gt;&gt; It's a pattern because there's something inside human being. It's called innate. You say innate idolatry. &gt;&gt; Idolatry permeated into people. Idolatry is in the people. It's in this flesh &gt;&gt; and it rises heads all the time. &gt;&gt; So let's let's look at couple of examples of idolatry and and see and try to for God help us this morning to see to see the pattern and and be able to understand and that that study would give us some keys. So when we talk about idolatry, we need to go to Exodus chapter 20. And God says, "I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have not no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them." And Jesus comes and in Luke 4 and he and he and he says the same thing. He says, Jesus answer unto them, get deep behind me, Satan, for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only thou shalt serve. So he he's repeating that commandment, that instruction, thou shalt not worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. any other gods. &gt;&gt; But this he says that in chapter 20 and we jumped in chapter 32 &gt;&gt; and they're like make us gods. &gt;&gt; But why did they feel like they needed something is because the prophet was gone for too long. &gt;&gt; The prophet went up the mountain. It's like he's not returning. But for a little while they were hoping he was returning. &gt;&gt; They also believe in the return ministry &gt;&gt; because they needed something. They need human flesh. They could not have confidence that the manifestation of God in their human flesh. They need to cleave unto God in human flesh outside of them. And since that prophet was gone for too long that idolatry start to rise inside of them that needed. We need a God we can touch. Aaron, give us something. &gt;&gt; Which Aaron represents the miniful ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Put us something in front of our eyes. We can worship and feel confident about ourselves. &gt;&gt; Instead of pointing, Aaron should have said, "What are you guys talking about? God [screaming] is with us. Yes, Moses on the top of the mountain. The put a pill of fire is here. The one who brought us out of Egypt will make us I don't know what's going to happen with Moses. God knows. Let us have faith and believe that this pillar of fire gonna lead us to and that was supposed to be the the role of Aaron. But he collapsed [screaming] under the pressure of the people &gt;&gt; cuz they wanted something a god they can relate and they could touch. So when the people saw Moses delayed to come the lost of a prophet &gt;&gt; they say make us gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the men that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we were not what he's become of him &gt;&gt; and that was just a couple of days &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that's not much it just come out of Egypt. They're probably not mentally strong. Their faith is weak. &gt;&gt; But the ministry should have support them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the ministry was not strong enough either. &gt;&gt; The Levites, Aaron. &gt;&gt; And he and he did it. &gt;&gt; And God was like, if I was talking and I was God, like, what are you guys doing? Like, &gt;&gt; can I not talk? Can I not remove my prophet for a couple of days and you guys collapse and but they were freshly come out of Egypt. So idolatry was still inside of them. So they wanted something they related to that they're used to. And also one of the reason this happened is that in Exodus 20, God said when God said bring the people to the bottom of the mountain because God wanted to speak directly to the people &gt;&gt; which is the purpose of God also. &gt;&gt; Yes, God speaks through prophet. Yes, he did send a prophet. But you know what? Today you also want it's not a competition like when we preach that sometime people like well he wants to get rid of the prophet that's not the point &gt;&gt; but the point is he also wants to reveal he wants to lead you the Bible says sons of God are led by the spirits of God it doesn't say prophet only or preacher only but sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God &gt;&gt; and obviously we know if it's against the word you know it's a false spirit &gt;&gt; but he wants to lead you. &gt;&gt; So God wants to speak directly to you like he wanted to speak directly to Israel. &gt;&gt; But you know what they did? &gt;&gt; The mountain was shaking. There was lightning. There was thunder. People were just frightened. And they said unto Moses, "Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with us." &gt;&gt; We want to hear about the prophet. We want a prophet speak, but the rest that's scary. Like God's going to lead me. How do I How do I know God? I I don't know. &gt;&gt; Let the prophet say it. &gt;&gt; Let the prophet say it. So, you see the pattern. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's been the challenge of ages and generation. That's why Colossians says that mystery that's been hidden from ages and generations, which was what? Christ in us &gt;&gt; wants to speak directly to you. Wants to have fellowship directly with you. &gt;&gt; But how many people today like oh no I prefer to hear it on the tape. &gt;&gt; I prefer no let let the prophet say it like who am I? Who am I? &gt;&gt; Who am I to say anything? Who am I to have my own leading? That's scary. &gt;&gt; What if I do a mistake? What if I have it wrong? Go do a mistake. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to teach you. &gt;&gt; If you do a mistake, you think it's the end of the world, &gt;&gt; God is going to tell you, "Okay, &gt;&gt; good try, son. I'm happy you try. You try it. Now, let's do better." Next time I was talking with you, I said left, you went right. Well, let's say I said right, you went left. It's better. Verse 21. And the people stood a far off and they just said, "Moses, you're the one who talks to God. We're going to stay far from God and we want you in between." &gt;&gt; But do you see the purpose? God took Israel out of Egypt in the desert to meet to have that meeting at the mountain where God comes down. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing in our age. God came down. &gt;&gt; Prophet brought us to the foot of the mountain. &gt;&gt; God came down. And now there's supposed to be that connection. &gt;&gt; And prophet said, "If this is it, I must decrease &gt;&gt; and he must increase." &gt;&gt; This is the appointment. This is the greatest purpose. I've set up the appointment. Elizer set up the appointment. &gt;&gt; You love this man. You love this wife. &gt;&gt; Get married so I may decrease. &gt;&gt; But people are like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stay with us." &gt;&gt; So history repeat itself. all the time. It's a mystery from ages from generation. &gt;&gt; Other example that are pretty amazing. But you talk about the brazen serpent. Now remember God said don't do any image. &gt;&gt; Don't do anything. So some people think the Bible contradicts itself but it doesn't. God said to the people you don't do it on yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But then God came and says now I'm asking you to do one. &gt;&gt; Which is totally different. Right. &gt;&gt; So what what did did Moses made a mistake &gt;&gt; because at one point he says thus said the Lord God says don't do any image and then he comes down and he says now thus said the Lord do one &gt;&gt; we'll start a website Moses was a fraud.com you see how things are moving the word is alive &gt;&gt; if you so if you want to disqualify Moses you got a basis here and there's sure many other places. &gt;&gt; Don't do it and then do it like &gt;&gt; now. What's amazing is that God says, "Do that serpent and put him on a on a stick, that fiery serpent, and when you want to and when you're going to look at that serpent, you're going to get healed. &gt;&gt; If you're dying, if you look at this, you're going to you're going to live." &gt;&gt; And it was it was an amazing revival. And that serpent, even though for us it's quite amazing that God would do that, that serpent was a revival. God sent life in the camp using that as an instrument for people to have faith in something they could see. And God was in it. &gt;&gt; But you know what happened? &gt;&gt; They kept it. &gt;&gt; They're like, "Wow, that worked. Let's keep the serpent &gt;&gt; because and and and I can I can imagine, you know, how many testimonies that came out of those that healing campaign. &gt;&gt; It was a healing campaign. &gt;&gt; Everybody got healed. So you you can imagine how many years that they would they would witness, oh yeah, my uncle was there that day. He was he was he was 60 feet from that. Like Moses came and he put it there and my uncle was 60 feet from that. He was so close to the platform when the the the serpent when that happened. And then he looked and he was like he was sick. He was about to die. Somebody had to turn his head cuz he was like he couldn't even move. And men talk about and say you know you know how testimony sometime gets bigger with the years, right? And so so they move his head and they open his eyes and when he saw that he was brother they was I mean you should have been and and the kids are listening to that because they were not there and they're like oh man. And but you know we still have the serpent. &gt;&gt; Come on now. And then the years goes by and and all the witness that's been there are now dying. And now we find in the camp someone that's still alive. &gt;&gt; So it goes behind the pulpit and brother. Yes, sisters. I was there that day when Moses and it became the attraction every Easter. Well, every year, you know, they bring that testimony of of what happened with that serpent and and and then the last man dies and now we have no more witness, but we still have the serpent. Wow. &gt;&gt; And that lasted probably for so many years because when when Josiah came in 2 Kings verse 18, &gt;&gt; the serpent was still that brazen serpent was still there. But now they are burning incense to it and they they gave him a name and now they're worshiping the thing because God has used that so mightily &gt;&gt; that they felt safe because uncle so and so and grandpa was there and he got healed so that thing worked not realizing that was that was an instrument temporarily &gt;&gt; for you to believe God is a healer. If he did then he can do it now but you don't need the the the instrument. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You need a connection with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, what's amazing is that it's not Josiah. It's Ezekiel. He was as the 16th kings in Judah, which was about 500 700 years later &gt;&gt; they're offering incense. So, you see how from years to year it becomes bigger and bigger and bigger and now it's not even look at it. Now, he give it a name and offer him incense. a Christian nation &gt;&gt; built on that principle. Thy shall not have any image. Thou shalt not worship it. &gt;&gt; God didn't say worship it. God says look at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see the principle, the pattern. &gt;&gt; It's constant. Same thing first Samuel about about the ark of the covenant. So, Israel is in defeat and and Philistines are are winning the the battle. Now, they're afraid and and so they said, "Let's go get the ark of the covenant and bring the ark of the covenant in the camp. It may save us out of the hands of our enemies." Think about a thought. Now, the ark of the covenant was the closest thing you can get to God. That, you know, the the the ten commandments were inside and and the arc covenant, nobody could touch it if they would die. It represent the presence of God. So they're like okay God because you know Israel was defeated. Eli the pastor his two sons were backsliden. Eli was back. So Israel is not a good in good terms with God and suddenly they want to get a hold of something. So they're like you know what we're going to win if we bring the ark. Now what's amazing is the Philistine are they they were idol worshipper. &gt;&gt; So they really believe in those kind of thing. So when they saw the ark coming Israel was like oh man we're dead. we're good as dead. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know God was not there. &gt;&gt; But they thought if they bring the ark, &gt;&gt; then God is with us. &gt;&gt; And and it's the same thing that ages has done every age, if we keep the message, if we bring back the messenger constantly, it means God is with us. &gt;&gt; And it becomes something that that should be a blessing. it become a trap &gt;&gt; and a dying religion. &gt;&gt; So the Philistines were like oh no and they were afraid because they said because they are idol worshipper themselves they said God is coming to the camp because Israel had such a revival that the the earth tremble. The Bible says the earth trembled because they were shouting. They had such a revival. Hallelujah. The ark is there. You know they got excited. The music and all this. Praise the Lord. And the Bible says the earth ring. So Philistine was like, "We're good as dead." &gt;&gt; They really believe it. You talk about faith in something. They have faith so much in the ark that this would bring the presence of God. But they had it wrong because what God wants is a broken spirit and a contrite heart. He doesn't want artifacts. &gt;&gt; God is looking for a heart that is contrite. A heart that is broken. A heart that's going to humble itself. And then he's going to come down. Now if you rely on so artifact or historical events, historical events has no power. &gt;&gt; And then Israel went through a better defeat, a slaughter. You imagine the confusion when you go back to your tent that night. &gt;&gt; I believe in that message for all those years. &gt;&gt; Can't believe we're been defeated this way. &gt;&gt; Put my trust in that. It's probably all fake anyway. I was told the ark had such a power people could touch it and die. I was told this is all nonsense. It was all fake. There's no power in that. &gt;&gt; Imagine how many people walked away of the believing the ark that it was something special. &gt;&gt; It was something special, but they've misused it. &gt;&gt; And in misusing something that was sent from God, [screaming] there was no effect. Is that Jesus said because of your tradition? You make the the word of God have no effect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Gideon's ephod. You saw you say ephod. &gt;&gt; Ephod. Sorry my so amazing. Gideon. Why a man of God bring such a revival in in the camp? Victory defeated. A victory is not supposed to happen. There are 300 and they come and have such a great victory. And so, so again, same thing happened. Israel find confidence. Finally, we have a man we can rely somebody we going to look on to. God is with him. And so, if God is with him, we're safe. He's going to lead us in victory. So, they feel comfortable and all that. But now, the problem is Gideon's getting old. That's why sometime God will pull out his own men. He's he's using &gt;&gt; because everybody is leaning on him heavily. &gt;&gt; And yes, God is in that man, but his purpose is to be in you. &gt;&gt; He wants to be in your life. &gt;&gt; So, at one point, yes, God will will will pull out a man that you stand on your own and you'll be you'll be unbalanced for a while. Oh Lord, what's going on? You're not with us anymore. And like God's like, wake up. &gt;&gt; I'm here. &gt;&gt; You're not looking in the right place. So when when when when Gideon gets old, then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, "Rule thou over us, &gt;&gt; but thou thy son and thy sons sons also." &gt;&gt; That they want to establish a lineage &gt;&gt; to feel safe knowing that after Gideon leaves, his son's going to take over. &gt;&gt; And after his sons leaves, his son's going to take over. So we can build build some headquarters &gt;&gt; and feel safe that we're following a lineage of godly men. &gt;&gt; It's a pattern. And in the Bible that's called idolatry &gt;&gt; cuz that's not that was not God's purpose. &gt;&gt; But they want to build a system out of something that God has done &gt;&gt; and it's been the trap for ages and generation. &gt;&gt; But the mystery of Christ that it's been hidden from ages and generation is Christ not only in Gideon. Christ not only in Moses, Christ not only in William Brown, but Christ in you, &gt;&gt; your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Now, what's good is that Gideon didn't bite onto this. He didn't he didn't play the game. He's like, "No, that's not happening. I will not rule over you. Neither shall my son rule over you. The Lord shall rule over you." So, he had it straight. He's like, "Good, Gideon. Praise the Lord." But then &gt;&gt; he made an ephod. So even though in his own desire he wanted to block idolatry which is putting something between you and God which human being does all the time &gt;&gt; and we've done it and then we wake up God is like your focus is at wrong place &gt;&gt; and God sometime will allow a man of God to make a mistake because you're looking at him too much &gt;&gt; you're not seeing Christ through him you are caught up in the veil &gt;&gt; so God will show you a flaw in the veil for you to turn your hearts to God. &gt;&gt; But some some sometime people get so disappointed when they see a flaw in the veil that they throw the veil and God in the garbage. &gt;&gt; There's flaws in every man of God. &gt;&gt; Why it it's on purpose? Because God wants you to keep your eyes on him. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening with so many disillusioned people. They throw everything out because they saw a flaw. Welcome. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you see a flaw, praise the Lord. It was about time. &gt;&gt; That's what I tell people when they come to our church. We all always when people first time visit our church, they always think we are great people. And wow, such an atmosphere. You people are so loving and yes, we are we are we are that. Yes, we are loving and welcoming. you come, we're all going to surround you with love and my you're going to feel really special like the couple of first service you come and then and it's not because it's a fraud, you know, it's it's genuine. It's it's it's the reality, but I'm like, wait, it's all true, but there's there's another side. It's not it's not the dark side, but it's it's the human side. &gt;&gt; There's going to be flaws. You realize there's some people are there that don't know what they're doing there. And you know, you're going to you're going to realize that these are just human being that love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I don't want you to be so excited and then one one year down the road, you're going to leave this place, well, they're just a bunch of hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Their selling game is amazing. They feel like a lovely, but then after that realize they have flaws. &gt;&gt; Cuz your eyes need to be on God. &gt;&gt; No perfect church, no perfect deacons, no perfect pastors, &gt;&gt; no perfect prophets. Even though for many years &gt;&gt; we've been sold the perfect prophets. Never any mistakes, no failure, no flaws. &gt;&gt; And on top of that, it's not like he hide try to hide it. Listen, go listen to the tapes. &gt;&gt; He's not hiding anything. He's putting up front. But when you're veil into idolatry, &gt;&gt; you're just well, he's saying that because he's humble. He was humble, but he was real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So he built that ephod golden brought brought earrings and requested 1,700 shekeets of gold and all that I need to go quick and he made an effort there for and put it in the city. So he put he put a memorial somewhere and guess what it turned into idolatry. They went titter and whoring after it which thing became a snare unto Gideon and to his house. So even though he blocked the idolatry about himself and his family and his sons, he built something and people went after him. Even Guide, the Bible says Guide fell into that snare. &gt;&gt; So you see when God raises something, idolatry wants to creep in. Paul was like that thing is creeping already. &gt;&gt; And this is the spirit of the antichrist which is what Nicolan spirit which conquered lady remove Christ out of your life. &gt;&gt; And it's so subtle. It can look so good. It can look so genuine. It can look so much of what God wanted, &gt;&gt; but it's not. &gt;&gt; Now, what I'm wondering, and I have to bring it to a close, but what I'm wondering is at one point into history, you can call this idolatry. &gt;&gt; Talk about the snake. The first day is not idolatry. &gt;&gt; Wow. So, at one point, how many how many how many years after that, like somebody gets up and is like, &gt;&gt; I think we've been we're going a bit overboard with this &gt;&gt; for sure. The first guy, the first man in church that raised up is like, I think we're pushing this a bit too far. &gt;&gt; That guy gets excommunicated. &gt;&gt; The first one who gets up, he's he's he's no good for nothing. He gets you. You don't believe it. My uncle was there. How dare you? &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying it's not true. It's it's totally true. That's the problem. It is so true and so great. You guys are missing the point. &gt;&gt; You're missing God. &gt;&gt; But how long take take Gideon Zod like how long does it takes for somebody to to to catch on that? It's been too far. &gt;&gt; It's going overboard. We're missing the greatest purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The first one who says it, he gets excommunicated. Even the temple, the temple was such a great thing &gt;&gt; for for Israel. And obviously it is. It is a great thing. But you know what Jeremiah because he's a prophet, he picks on it one day because now people are putting their trust in the fact that they have a temple. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Thus say the Lord of God of ho, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, amend your ways and your doings, change your ways, &gt;&gt; and I will cause you to dwell in this place. Trust ye not in lying words, saying, "The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord." There's something about repetition sometime that makes people confident &gt;&gt; and and and and the spirit of God picks it there. &gt;&gt; Repeat it. Repeat it. Like those lying words, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord. You know, some religious people, they repeat it, repeat it, and the more they repeat it, they feel like they're in a trance and they feel like more confident. They get all excited. But these are lying words. &gt;&gt; Cuz what Jeremiah says, "Amend your ways and your doings." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've not got just you didn't give justice to the widow. You didn't do this. And even when Jesus come, the disciples are like, "Look Jesus, look at the temple. &gt;&gt; See what matters of stones and what buildings are here." So, so the one who spoke to Jeremiah, now he's standing in flesh. He's walking by the temple. The disciples are caught up into that same look at the temple. Look, look at the stone. Look at this. Look at that. Jesus is like, "You guys don't get it. That thing will be destroyed. We'll be &gt;&gt; we'll be dust. There won't be even one stone laying on the other." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The temple is in front of you and you're missing it. They should have been about Jesus like, "Wow, wa, look at the temple. It's so amazing." &gt;&gt; But they're talking to the temple, about a temple. &gt;&gt; How great was a day temple? &gt;&gt; It's not like Jesus wants to crush their party. Like they're so excited and Jesus is like, "Yeah, you like this. I'm going to crush it." That's not the point. &gt;&gt; The point is not that. The point is like you're missing it. You have the that temple was talking about the temple &gt;&gt; which you are by the way. You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. God wants to dwell inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got so many example but I got to I got to stop. But even the prophets Jesus Jesus said the same thing. &gt;&gt; They had so much trust in Moses. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "How can he believe which receive honor one or the other and seek not the honor that cometh from God only? Do not think that I will accuse you to the father. There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust." &gt;&gt; For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what happened in our age. The climax of that prophet was about Christ in us making us preach, making us sing, making us writing songs, making us witness on the street. You know Jesus, you know what? Jesus wanted to be where do you work? What shop do you work? What school do you go to? Do you want Do you know that Jesus want to go to that school? &gt;&gt; That's why he sent you there. &gt;&gt; It's not about you. Once you give your life to the Lord and you become the temple of the Holy Ghost, do you know that where you've been sent to, you're not supposed you ended up there. You thought you were going there. Always think okay Lord if this didn't work and that's working out you are doing something. &gt;&gt; You are moving me around. You think you think your life is like flipping a coin and oh man &gt;&gt; God want Jesus in flesh wants to be in that school and it's you. He wants to be at that coffee shop. He wants to be at that work plant. You thought you were about to be transferred, but you were not transferred because there's a soul there. And Jesus himself wanted to step in that department, &gt;&gt; but you thought it was about you because you wanted to go there and you wanted to have that 50 cents raise, &gt;&gt; but it's not about that. Once you give your life and you are the temple, when something doesn't happen the way you planned, you're like, Lord, &gt;&gt; what are you doing? And that should become something that we are quick to react when something happen because we like to plan. You know why? Because we like safety. We like comfort. And it's okay. You can try it. But when God push you around and destroy your plans, you should say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; you are working now." &gt;&gt; That's why whatever plans we do, we say, "Lord willing." James says, "Lord willing." Why? Because we know that Jesus is inside that temple. And this is not a concrete block dead. It's a living thing. It's a living word. And he want to use us. He wants to move us because we are the sons and daughters of God. And we are led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And it's all nice and cool to say in church, amen. But when God rules our plans because he wants to move us this way, why we have a sad face? We all disappointed. Why? Because we don't get it. coming on this trip. We were driving. I had my car. My daughter had Mary at her car cuz she's going to the winter youth. So, we were driving separately and then she stopped at the gas station and she thought that she had an oil leak and the the the she had a a mechanical failure. So, I I was ahead of her. So, I turned back and as I'm turning back, I says, "Okay, Lord, &gt;&gt; what are you doing?" &gt;&gt; And we can exercise oursel when our plan gets changed because we left really early. We were tired like we want to get there not too late and then all our plans look like it was falling apart &gt;&gt; but I'm driving I says Lord what are you doing? &gt;&gt; What this is it what is it about &gt;&gt; because you're doing something &gt;&gt; and it ended up being a false alert. We it was nothing big deal. We went and we drove. But just to give you an example when when when when something happened always like oh that devil or that old devil that old devil your life is the devil has no control over your life. You are a son and daughters of God. You're not a game that the devil is playing with. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; But when we are so used to rely on systems and rely on other people when in our own life we get tricked into something changed we don't know where to look at. We're trying to find a quote. We're trying to find pastor. What are you thinking? It's good to consult these things. But God is like, "Why don't you ask me? &gt;&gt; I'm the one who disrupted your plan, not the devil. I'm I'm in action right now in your life. Can you recognize me?" &gt;&gt; Even Samuel, he was not used to God's voice. In the middle, God wokes him three times. And that every time he goes to the pastor because he's used to a system. If something move, you go see the pastor. And I got nothing against it. Sometime people don't consult enough. &gt;&gt; So I don't have that's not the the thing. &gt;&gt; But the the point is that God want also to speak to you. &gt;&gt; And at one point Eli even though he was a backsliden pastor, he he he caught it. He says this is God talking to you. &gt;&gt; This is God. &gt;&gt; What do I say? Well, tell him you're listening. &gt;&gt; Tell him you got the line. 10 on 10. I got you. &gt;&gt; Speak to me, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The musicians can come. &gt;&gt; We got many example. Daniel stat Daniel's image that was built. The king built an image to the prophet. We got so many examples. But I think you get the point. &gt;&gt; But I wanted to give so many example for you to see. It's a it's a common thing. It creeps in &gt;&gt; right away. You have a good moment with God. Right away the devil is like, "How can I trick this? I can I tr how can I trip the wire? How can I reverse the current? &gt;&gt; How can I turn this positive into negative right away? As you are in the presence of God right away in his mind is how can I I need to shortcut this right away. As sons of God empowered by the spirit of God is so dangerous &gt;&gt; that God the Satan wants to stop that and it's dead in its tracks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is why I preach my heart out this morning for to reconnect a son and a daughter of God to say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to be connected to you." &gt;&gt; That is the greatest &gt;&gt; purpose. &gt;&gt; But Satan wants to bring us when the means become &gt;&gt; the purpose. &gt;&gt; When the means, the se the brazen serpent was a mean. It was a way God the prophet is a way God is. It's the the mean. But the greatest what is the greatest &gt;&gt; purpose? Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we love you so much, Lord. And in our simple humanity, Lord, we have we are sometime naive. We get distracted. We get disrupted. Lord, your word has touch us, Lord, in a special way this morning. We feel your presence. You're in You want fellowship with your sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; You want our hearts to be turned to you. &gt;&gt; Forgive us, Lord. Forgive us our distraction, Lord. Forgive us, Lord, of &gt;&gt; putting things between you &gt;&gt; and me. &gt;&gt; We want, Lord Jesus, to your presence and your person be inside of us. Once you're established, Lord, we want to be able to listen. to be led led out out of our own system, led outside of our own religion. Whatever we built, Lord, to make us feel comfortable, we all built system Lord. Lord, let's help us Lord to walk out of our own system. Give us Lord to be flexible, Lord. Am I a sheep that you can lead? You've led us to this day so far. You've led us in so many ways. But Lord, is there a greater potential inside of us that we are blocking because we're reaching out for safety? We're clinging on to other things. We're not letting go. We have thoughts. We have a mindset that are blocking us. A religious mindset, a way of thinking. Lord, come down this morning. And set us free from oursel. We all built religion. We do it every day. Lord, we want to be safe. We want to make sure we find our safety in your presence. and in your leading Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Open [singing] our eyes. Let's stand up. Lord, we want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him. Yes. Hallelujah. and say [music and singing] that we love him. [music] Open [singing] our ears, Lord, and help us [singing and music] to live. [music] Open our eyes, Lord. [music and singing] We want to [music and singing] see Jesus. Sing it again. [music] Open [singing] our eyes, [music] Lord. Come. Amen. Want to see [music] to reach out. touch him [music and singing] to say that we love [singing] him. [music] Oh [singing] [music] yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Help us. [music] Help us to listen. [singing] Open [singing] our eyes, Lord. [music] We want [singing] to see. You are the center, [singing and music] the center of my life. &gt;&gt; You're the reason [singing] why I can live more [singing] abundantly. [music] Let there be nothing, let there be nothing, [singing] nothing [music] placed before you. So I can see you in plain [singing and music] view. I want to do everything through Christ. The center, the center [music and singing] of my life. You are the center. You are the center. Is that your prayer this morning? No distractions. No distractions. You're the reason [music] why [singing] I can [music] live more abundantly. Let there be [music and singing] nothing, nothing placed [music] before you so I can see [singing] you in plain view. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I want to do everything through [singing] Christ. The center, center [music and singing] of my life. Seems I have a million things [music and singing] to do. Everything gets placed in front of you. But Lord, it's not my desire [music and singing] to see it go that way. Here's our prayer. And so I'll [music] rearrange my seeking for your will down on my knees, giving you. How many want to give him the first place? [music] Hallelujah. Knowing it's your strength I can't replace. You [music] are the center, the center [singing] of my life. You're the reason [music] why. Oh, I can live more [singing] abundantly. Let there be nothing nothing placed [music and singing] before you. I can see you in plain view [music] everything through Christ the [music] center of [singing] my life. [music] Thank you, brother. I just wanted to say how blessed we are to hear these words this morning [music] from the Lord. At the first of the year, I always pray and ask for God to give us the direction. Of course, I have to make decisions about meetings this year and who to bring in. There's a host, an army of ministers to bring that can bless us, and I just want to be led of the Lord. But I also look at that theme [music] that God is leading the church in. And the last few services, he's just setting a a tone if you're catching it. And I'm really excited about where the Lord's leading us. Uh, brother [music] Jeremy Shriner was here to use same example if all of you know if you're catching it about um uh [music] the the ark. Yeah, the ark. And he brings that in. And so I just appreciate the word. I appreciate the honesty. It it might make us feel just a little uncomfortable. Where's he going with this? But it's God challenging us &gt;&gt; to make sure he's the center of our life, &gt;&gt; not any man. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm beginning to wonder if in the Webster's dictionary, Steve Brassan's name is right next to honest because that's what I appreciate about him. No, it's not brother Steve. It's the Holy Spirit being honest, &gt;&gt; almost raw with us [music] to make us look at something. And you see, we've heard these scriptures for many years. We've said, "Amen." We know what the mystery is. We've heard Christ in you, the hope of glory. How many reach? We've heard that. We know this is God's purpose, where he's headed. But I'm wondering if we've had enough time to really have the discernment to know how much Satan is trying to distract you from that goal. &gt;&gt; We can say, "Yes, it's Christ." and me, but maybe you're not getting fully to it because even in our own ranks, there are efforts of the enemy to distract us towards a man, &gt;&gt; towards a pastor, &gt;&gt; towards the false security that I'm in the message. &gt;&gt; I've been in the message for 30 years &gt;&gt; to to lean on something. And whenever we lean on something, even if it's good, is it distracting us from that revelation of Christ in you, the hope of glory? &gt;&gt; And I said to a minister a few weeks ago at lunch, I I said it to him this weekend, is that I don't know if we've done our homework to go through the message and to be able to pinpoint certain denominational characteristics that the prophet identified, nickelanism, all these other things. And we avoid h we don't we don't avoid him but we we don't have to read that because that doesn't apply to us right &gt;&gt; oh no it's the same devil &gt;&gt; and he wants to take this revelation this simple revelation and keep you [music] &gt;&gt; from that and coming into that &gt;&gt; but I like to say his Satan's days are numbered &gt;&gt; and the word God has given and the people that's standing here in this hour are the people that will finish this revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; They will be the people. She's going to come to it no matter what. But we have to have the discernment to say, "Lord, is there something distracting me? Even my false comfort blanket of of I'm a part of this group. I'm a part of this church and this is the ne next great teacher and you just go rah over this." Just be careful of that. &gt;&gt; God's wanting to all that to decrease [music] and himself to increase in our eyes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; God's God's saying it more specific than he's ever said it. And he loves us enough to be honest and tell us the truth on these things. And I I want I would Would you raise your hand and agree? I want God's greatest purpose to be fulfilled in me. No other purpose, no other agenda from the enemy. No other distractions, nothing else. Just to have that [music] completely fulfilled in our lives. And that's why he sent the message of the last day. That's why he sends prophets to us. That's why he sent the five-fold ministry. But none of that is to be a replacement &gt;&gt; for what he wants to do. You say, "Well, my wife won't come along or my children won't come along or I got this. Let's let's not make any excuses. &gt;&gt; I I probably if you go there and really say, Lord, I'm going to manifest this purpose in my life. I'm not waiting for family members to come with me." Yeah, &gt;&gt; probably if you go there, they'll get a hunger for it themselves cuz they see you've changed. They see you coming into something that you've never come into before. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I love the word. Thank you, brother Steve. You're your family here. You're at home here. And he just [music] um you know, when I say I talked to that minister about we need need to do our homework to to discern these denominational things and distractions. you did your homework and you brought it out just well today. God bless you. Praise the Lord. We appreciate it. Amen. Just [music] two or three things I want to mention to you that are very important to me before we leave today. Um I know I I um I was blessed with the Christmas present of another grandson. And I always hesitate announcing because it's almost like every service I'm announcing a dedication or another grandson or granddaughter. But we're glad to welcome Solomon Emanuel Jr. to the service this morning and healthy and I'd surprised to see them here in church, but they're here and uh we're proud of them and we God bless you Solomon and Lily. We're very happy to welcome uh that little boy into our lives. Praise the Lord. I would like to call upon the church to pray this week. Tomorrow starts a uh a meeting we've done been doing for almost 40 years. It's 17 and up singles from all over the country, sometimes different countries, and they come from everywhere. It's a and they come because it's a special time of special teaching, special preaching, and also they're a special group of young people. Uh it's just incredible just what comes together. And so, we'll have that again here in Grass Lake the next three or four days. I'm asking the congregation, there's going to be about 170 young people. Would you all uh raise your hand, agree to take it to prayer over the next three days that these lives would be touched and changed and you can really help me in that because your prayers can really make the meeting go the direction and a better direction so that it will help the young people that are coming. It's a tremendous time and a beautiful gathering of the people. So we we would appreciate you taking each of their lives and praying for them as they're there. They as I said they they set aside their time and their money. Let's also pray for this storm that it wouldn't be as much damage to keep. There'll be a lot of flights coming into Detroit and we don't want that to be a huge hindrance. So, pray for the storm that God will move it. Send it further north or something so that we can get those flights in tomorrow uh not send it your way to Quebec, but but uh somewhere other than uh here for sure because we we need to get those young people in. And there's pray for the staff too. There's a a lot of responsibilities, a lot of things that have to be done here in the next few hours even to prepare for tomorrow for all these coming into Grass Lake. So, if you would take them to prayer, we'd certainly appreciate that. Amen. We love the Lord. We appreciate him this morning. And uh don't leave here. If you have a need, just come up afterwards for prayer. I know brother Michael wants to pray together with the brothers here of a need. If you have something, brother Bart, why don't you come and we'll just lay hands on you before this. Is it your your name was a surgery? I heard Mark, but then I thought, "No, it's Bart having that." Would you mind coming forward and we'll pray for you for that surgery coming up this week? And anyone else who would need prayer, but we'll just close in prayer and dismiss you. God bless you. And we won't be here this Wednesday because of the retreat, but we will be here next Sunday starting Sunday school at 10:30 and the regular service as well. Let's be in prayer for the new year. Let's be in prayer for where God wants to lead us. We're hearing those little revelations. I always call it New Year's revelations. We don't need New Year's resolutions. They don't last. But how many want New Year's revelations? Lord, which direction? What do you want me to do? And as our brother said, what do you want me to do for your kingdom? Something happened to me, but Lord, why did it happen? Are you going to use me somehow for your kingdom? [music] Let us be open. Let's not be complainers. Let's not be negative. Let's not complain about our problems. Let's just give Satan a black eye this year. Stop complaining. Say, Lord, all things work together for the good to them that love God and that are called according to the purpose. Let's be a positive people and uh I'll just spring off some of these brothers what they've been preaching and preach some things in the new year here that I think will be a blessing. We'll [music] set some order also for next Sunday for the new year as well. So, we're looking forward to that. We usually have a watch night service at the uh at the camp. So, we're not able to have one here, but we encourage you to pray. I'm sure there'll be some online that you can listen in on, but we encourage you to gather your family together and pray the new year in if they're if the kids are still awake anyway. pray the new year in and uh we're looking forward to God's blessings. Heavenly Father, thank you for the word that's just dropped [music] so rich to us this morning. It's above and beyond what we can explain. We thank you, Lord, for your servant, Lord. When he said he preached his heart out, he definitely preach his heart to [music] us this morning. And we're thankful for him. Bless him and his family. Be with them, Lord, on their journey home. Move this storm, Lord, [music] in the name of Jesus Christ. Just pave the way, Lord, for the retreaters that are coming in. pave the way for brother uh [music] Steve and his family to get home. And we just pray you'll protect us, watch over us. We take each of those 175, [music] 180 lives uh young people coming from all different directions, Lord, to [music] just be able to come in this atmosphere and be able to learn of you. Lord, we [music] have the opportunity, you have the the place in our lives and in this retreat to be able to set the direction for just [music] hundreds of young people and families for the future. I pray that you'll do it, Lord. I pray you'll anoint the ministers, brother Rap, Brother Trevor, Lord, and anoint it, Father, that the things can be said that would plant the seeds, Lord, for wonderful things, Christ being revealed [music] in those young people in their lives, Christ in us, the hope of glory. Thank you, Lord, for this service. [music] May the fellowship be sweet today as we commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Take me [music] deeper. Let's sing that as we go.
