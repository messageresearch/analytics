[Music] me is [Music] you're my king we pray I sing to you to me one more time [Music] [Music] come close [Music] [Applause] Thessalonians chapter 2 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the Gathering Together unto him that she be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letters as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition so we're talking about the last days here and it is a day of deception and it is a day that many shall fall away so they were they were with the truth but there'll be many fall away because it's an hour of deception that's that's prophecy for our time and then he speaks of the Son of Perdition who opposeth and exalted himself above all that is called God and in his worship so that he as God's sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now we know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity death already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way we see that the spirit will be exposed and we see the spirit is all the ways back in Paul's day as he's writing to the Thessalonians it's already beginning to work in the church verse 8 and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his brightness of his coming even him now listen now even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders lying wonders in other words we live in the age of Lies Satan is the father of Lies so one of the distinction is we live in the age of lies and he'll do lying wonders that's why the deception is there it'll be a lie it won't be the truth but it will be so close in the evening time it'll look like the truth look like the real thing but that's the most deceiving you can get is that it looks like the truth and yet it's a lie and with all deceivabeness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved so here's the problem is that you cannot go up against this lying age unless you receive something and what you receive is a love for truth how many want that this morning not not up here but a love and a desire I'm going to pursue truth I want to know the truth if you don't have that a love for truth then you'll be succumbed by lies but if God puts by the Holy Ghost within you a love for truth you're always going to be pursuing the truth whether it's in God's word or in relationships what I'm going to talk about this morning in relationships my bottom line is that if you love the truth and you're always pursuing truth even in relationships with one another you're waiting to get to the truth and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion because they won't receive the love of the truth some they'll he'll they'll come under a strong delusion that they should believe a lie so a lot of people will will swallow the lies because they haven't received the love of the truth and because actually God sends a strong delusion over them that they might all be damned who believe not the truth once again they didn't believe the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness all right so that's that all looks pretty uh pretty dim pretty uh negative it's truthful but it's this is what is is happening but I thank God for the rest of these scriptures because he says verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and what belief of the truth I'm going to say the same thing that Paul said here I'm going to say I thank God every day that there's some individuals on the face of the Earth that are called from the foundation of the world and they in this age of lives are going to believe the truth where unto he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus therefore Brethren Stand Fast and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or by epistle people make traditions a bad word there's some good traditions and that's the word of God and he says in this hour you better hold fast to him don't move the boundary lines don't move uh don't don't try to change standards just leave them the way they are now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even Our Father which hath loved us hath given us everlasting consolation and Good Hope through Grace Comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and work now this morning I feel uh that I'm going to try my best to summarize and finish up this little series that we've been on talking about relationships after the fall and the fall I'm referring to in the beginning when we fell and I've been talking a little bit about relationships that took that were different before the fall and everything changed after the fall I'm going to do my best to summarize uh that this morning and wrap it up you know it's one thing to talk about all the thing that we fell from and how it makes us Act and the serpent nature that we were born with and uh to to be real honest with you it's it's quite a burden on a minister and I lean a certain way I'm different than other ministers every minister is different but it's it's quite a burden when you go through a series that's laboring on things that are really bad things that we do and bad interactions with others and relationship those aren't really shouting Services you're not going to have people hanging from their actors and dancing and shouting and it's quite a burden and quite a labor on me to labor in those things because the response may not be quite as exciting as when you're talking about the joy of the Holy Spirit I can preach on the joy of the Holy Spirit and I will again but and but we tend to enjoy things that are that bring the joy of the Lord and the joy of the spirit and and uh and and that's all fine uh but when you're on these things just laboring and plowing with it it's more planting seeds and it's not the greatest shouting services and when we feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit rather than the joy of the holy spirit it's a bit different the joy is a lot more popular today can you say mine the the joy is a lot more popular and I enjoy the joy of the Lord but it's good to see sometimes where we're short where our shortcomings are because the devil actually he doesn't like things to be talked about where we're short he doesn't like that because if you get victories in the areas where you're short that's when the devil is really on the Run when people will come under conviction and say I've been a Christian for years but I'll tell you I'm really learning something from the Lord here that I need to I need to give this to the Lord I've given all this I've given my my times I've given my all these other things but I I realized an area today that I'm doing to my family or my children and my relationships or my relationship to God and I realized I recognize an area where I'm sure we don't come to church to get patted on our back or to hear all the good things we actually come to hear our short areas our shortcomings where we can say where we can yield more can I get an amen this morning that's that's really why we come to church and so it's good to see where we're short and not just where we're thriving and that way we can keep growing how many want to keep growing this morning we want to keep growing and a constant atmosphere of energy that says we are right we're right we're right a constant atmosphere all the time of that that we're right may bring pride and that we are uh the only ones that are right and that we can never be wrong I'm going to say it again if you only have an atmosphere where you're preaching you're right you're right you're good you're good you're the bride you're the bride and never correct never any correction in our lives it can tend to lead to a pride that people start thinking well we must be the only ones that are right and we could never be wrong I'm always right and that is a deception let me say this way so the kids can understand it some medicine that you take doesn't really taste well going down but it's what the doctor ordered and you need it can you say Amen so I'm gonna I'm gonna bring this down after these weeks and bring it down to a summary and talk about relationships after the fall and summarize Adam and Eve who enjoyed a perfect Oneness with God they had unhindered fellowship and love with God and love with one another and and and it was unhindered there was nothing there was no guilt there was no shame there was nothing there and so they had unhindered fellowship and love with God and love with one another and then we know that something uh come to break that nothing could break it before that something but something come to break all that up and all of it was lost all of this Oneness was lost and broke by one thing and that is a Eve listen to a lie Eve the how this all started was Eve listen to a lie she had the truth she had the word but then in a vulnerable state Satan comes and he whispers and says to her a lie or we could call it a false interpretation instead of the truth of God's word it was a false interpretation of what God Said and so so we might make the comment that you can't help but say it this morning but an ad that most of our troubles many times in life begin with misunderstandings with one another misinterpretations of things that get said many times our troubles begin with misunderstandings with one another or a situation being falsely interpreted to us or maybe uh uh reposted to us or resend to us if I had this morning I say something to brother Zach I'd say something to him or he said something to me to say something to brother Ike and so now if I became the messenger of that he would have to trust me to be a messenger because if he told me what to say to brother Ike in the process of me walking across the room and talking to him depending on my character that may not be get said exactly is how he meant it to say it's called misunderstanding it's called misinterpretation of what should have been said he's going to speak the truth but the messenger in between it is very important because it might get misinterpreted this happens every day in our life misunderstandings misinterpreted things things that are read wrong between one another can you say Amen how many believe that God that people today misunderstand God's word misunderstand what it means and because people haven't been taught right and the word peer purely presented to them they misunderstand God they misunderstand what God meant in the Bible they have a misinterpretation and a lot of that work is has Satan's hands on it because he's the misinterpreter of this word he did it in the garden he's still doing it today he's taking the truth of God's word which is pure has power in it will set you free but if it gets into Satan's voice and Whispers to you it's going to be misinterpreted and so thus we have the beginnings of the Fall was a lie that was told to Eve can you say Amen one one person said it takes two to speak the truth one to speak and another to hear Mark Twain said get your facts first and then you can distort them as much as you please now mostly in this life people don't do that they don't seek the facts first they go ahead and misinterpret they'll go ahead and read the story read what they hear right off the bat and it gets misinterpreted and like the old phone thing that we used to play as it goes around the room to everybody you say something and it's so funny and so sometimes embarrassing what it ends up at the end of the of the phone call all of you have done that we we did that as a kid it was very funny and it's amazing you're sitting right in front of one another and whispering things and it's amazing how twisted that story is at the end so most of us we we don't take the truth most of us we'll take hearsay and then we'll misinterpret it even more Mark Twain says get your facts first and then you can distort them but but say I would say Satan is more like this than anyone and that is that the truth is there the truth has been told the truth is present it's been spoken to his people and that's when Satan comes in and starts to misinterpret the word fellowship and Oneness with God and one another is broken by real simple things but they're important things and that's when the lies come in and start to unravel the truth that we already have that's when things begin to break up that's when splits happen that's when Fellowship is broken and then because everything broke away then we find Adam and Eve and Cain right away right away acting different than what they did living under the word and living under truth they started to act different and and when you live in truth and live in the protection of Truth there there is a protection with it there's a shield against the enemy when you just simply live in truth but if you live in truth and you trust it even sometimes when you don't fully understand it but this is from God this is truth I'm going to live in truth because truth truth is will always be truth because truth when it is believed it may look like Satan is going to trample upon it under his feet but truth will always Prevail and truth will always be truth and you're going to be Freer and you're going to be have more victories if you live in the truth and so now when all this happens now another nature is driving them because they listen to a lie we have the fall of Man and they listen to a lie about the truth now another nature and characteristics of that nature is driving them and they're acting all out of sort so I'm going to summarize now the first thing they started to do was Lie themselves because they're under the spirit of Satan which is lying they started to lie they started to blame one another instead of standing for one another they started to hide from the presence of the Lord instead of run towards the presence of the Lord could everybody agree that when they failed the best place that they could be running to is back into the presence of the Lord but our nature is to run from it to hide from it some people don't realize that when you're in trouble or you've made mistakes the best place that you could run to is the presence of the Lord the best place they can get to is the house of God where the gospel is being preached but you know what most people run from that that's the first thing that they strike off their list I ain't going there and I'm going to go hide somewhere I'm going to go I'm going to take a big vacation that's not the way to deal with your struggle with your relationship with God if they should have been running back to the presence of the Lord said God we've made a mistake here God have mercy on me and they started hiding their sin instead of bringing it to God they listen to this they took time and sowed they didn't just hide in the bushes they took time to sow fig leaves together I love how that's worded they they sowed the Bible says they sowed fig leaves and aprons together they did it together now they have no Oneness anymore but they're somehow found Oneness to sow fig leaves together so they got some Oneness but it's really strange because they're they're saying let's let's do this and and let's and and so they're they're gonna find creative ways to run from God and hide their shame and they're going to do it together in their marriage before they prayed together they Fellowship together in Purity they were openly in his presence and now they were finding ways to be out of church and hide from his presence all these attributes came out and guess what all of these attributes were not learned some of these attributes were almost immediate and they didn't Adam and Eve blaming one another they didn't go to classes before they started to manifest these attributes isn't that amazing I'm going to bring a point here that is this isn't about that where they were taught this is about something got in their nature that was wrong it was deep down in their nature now and so now everything that they started to manifest it wasn't taught they didn't take lessons in it they did Adam and Eve didn't go through a 10-week process to learn how to become fussing and arguing with another and fighting they didn't they didn't they didn't it was all within them to fight for their own way to stand for themselves instead of tell the truth to blame one another to lie to hide from God they weren't taught that it just came with this whole fall in the garden it was inherent in the nature they were lying and they didn't learn how to lie and the best example of that is a little two-year-old that uh when when they when they got a cookie and you know they did but there you go over to them and say did you steal that cookie and they're they're looking there and they're saying no I not mean and they have they have crumbs coming out of their mouths not me no Johnny did it Johnny did it me that kid did not go especially at two years old to a 10-week seminar and learn how to lie and yet they're such good ones at two years old already they're professional Liars they're better than some adults they know how to blame someone else and they know how to do this and deny it deny it there's no evidence of it then just breathe bring a show me I'm it's amazing and guess what they didn't learn it it comes in the nature that they're born with it's by Nature that these characteristics come so whose nature is it didn't come from God so this means that when they fell from truth and listened to a lie they took on not just did they fall and lose everything they had with God they took on a nature and attributes that can only originate in one and that's Satan himself he's the father of Lies he's a false interpreter of the word he's the blamer of someone else he's the gossiper he is jealous of a jealous wasn't wasn't Lucifer jealous of the position of God and wanted to be worshiped like God he's the originator of jealousy and he drew a per he had influence on the third part of the stars and so he rose in jealousy to take away the Kingdom from God even before we got to Earth he is he was he's jealous of God but guess what Satan's really jealous of he's a great jealousy over the believer's position in Christ he's been always jealous of your creative power because God gave creative power to Adam and when God gave that full power on the earth to Adam Satan was jealous of that Creed he's never had creative power can you say amen he never will have it he can't create anything he only perverts what God brings out he has always wanted access to that creative power and guess what God gives it to Sons and Daughters of God he gives creative power to you no wonder he's jealous of you and puts a believer in his position in Christ by the Holy Ghost he stands as a Powerhouse against the enemy and Satan says I can never have that so the only thing I can do is fight against this believer try to tell him they're not a Believer try to belittle them try to put them down try to find their mistakes and capitalize he's trying because he's jealous of your position in Jesus Christ you have something that he can never have and that's why Satan hates you it's not your personality he hates it's not your mannerisms it's not only it's what you have in God inside of you that's what he's jealous of if if the fall happened in the garden by believing a lie then it's pretty simple that the way back starts with believing the truth and I don't mean intellectually just saying yeah I believe this I'm talking about what he said in my text they need to receive the love the nature the love of the truth and because they wouldn't receive the love of the truth by the Holy Ghost then there come under a delusion to believe any lies but if the way out of Eden was believing a lie then the way back starts with believing the truth the truth receiving the truth the love of the truth when we get a true experience of the Holy Ghost and our soul we have received a love for truth what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when we've received the Holy Ghost we receive a love for truth you love truth and sometimes it doesn't matter the vessel that it comes through that's besides the point it doesn't matter what Avenue it doesn't matter if you find that it's truth you love it you say Amen to it the evidence of the Holy Ghost is saying Amen to every word of God of this age by Nature it just it just it just says amen it may not say it here but it says amen amen evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not shouting it's not dancing that's the joy of the Holy Ghost you get stimulation of Revelation you're going to shout and dance sometimes or you may just cry not everybody will shout and dance is it okay to say that not everybody May shout and dance but you're gonna be there's gonna be a reaction emotionally when you're stimulated by the revelation but the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is not an emotion it is your Nature has been changed that you begin to love the truth even in family relationships you'll stand back and say now you've just said something to me against a brother you've just said something to me and then we heard something and a Believer will stand back because he's a lover of the truth he won't Jump Right In and say well tell me more I want to hear more I think we should stand back and say I'm going to wait and pray about this and make sure that we have the truth it's a love of Truth whether it's doctrinal truth whether it's in the Bible whether it is and even if it's the truth about your condition you're hiding something in your life and the truth comes and exposes you if you're hiding it and you're doing it then that's the truth and because you're a lover of Truth you'll find an altar and repent God I've been exposed it's the truth I'm backslidden I'm away from you you gotta admit it's true to get anywhere but then you grab onto the other truth that says he that he that asks forgiveness God's faithful and just to forgive him of his sins then you grab a hold of that truth if I repented God's forgiven me I'm going to stand and go on truth will be Vindicated every time truth will always speak for itself truth will always be truth it'll never change and it will show itself as truth thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website
