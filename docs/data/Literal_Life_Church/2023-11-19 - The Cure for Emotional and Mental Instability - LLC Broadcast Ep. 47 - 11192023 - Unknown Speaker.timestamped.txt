[0:28] today this is nothing that I've really
[0:31] uh practiced for today I did have a
[0:33] couple songs on my heart but I hadn't
[0:34] had a chance to prepare them but brother
[0:37] Gideon said there was no special so I
[0:40] just wanted
[0:42] to praise God to this
[0:46] [Music]
[0:48] morning the tempter
[0:51] knocked and somehow I found
[0:56] strength to tell him no
[1:02] what i' once called Treasures I just
[1:08] stood and watched them
[1:13] go surpris at my
[1:18] resistance and new found
[1:23] [Music]
[1:26] stability I
[1:28] decided this there's a
[1:31] higher power
[1:35] holding
[1:38] [Music]
[1:41] me thank you Lord for
[1:45] holding holding
[1:49] [Music]
[1:52] me and if it wasn't for you Lord no t in
[2:00] where i'
[2:04] be in your
[2:07] arms I find there is such sweet
[2:16] Serenity thank you Lord for
[2:21] holding holding
[2:25] [Music]
[2:28] me storm of fear and sorrow shook my
[2:34] soul throughout the
[2:39] night I cried I may never live to
[2:46] see the morning
[2:49] light oh without the sun is
[2:55] shining I am safe without out a
[3:02] harm i'
[3:05] decided there's a higher power
[3:11] holding
[3:14] me oh so thank you Lord for
[3:21] holding
[3:22] holding
[3:23] [Music]
[3:27] me if it was was and for you Lord no
[3:34] telling where I
[3:38] be in your arms I find there is such
[3:45] sweet
[3:50] Serenity thank you Lord for
[3:54] holding holding
[3:58] me
[4:01] cuz in your arms I find there is such
[4:07] sweet
[4:10] [Music]
[4:12] Serenity thank you Lord for
[4:17] holding holding
[4:21] [Music]
[4:26] me you are Luke chapter 21 and uh verse
[4:32] 25 Luke 21 and verse 25 and there shall
[4:36] be signs in the Sun and in the moon and
[4:40] in the stars and upon the Earth distress
[4:44] of nations with perplexity the Sea and
[4:47] the waves roaring men's Hearts failing
[4:50] them for fear and for looking after
[4:53] those things which are coming on the
[4:55] earth one place in one of the gospels
[4:57] says looking at the fearful sights it's
[5:00] termed fearful sights and looking after
[5:03] those things which are coming on the
[5:04] earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[5:07] shaken so we have words like distress we
[5:10] have perplexity we have fear in men's
[5:13] Hearts their hearts failing them for
[5:15] fear we have fearful sights that are
[5:17] watching how can they see fearful sights
[5:19] constantly in front of them through
[5:21] television and through their phones
[5:22] there's fearful sights that brings more
[5:24] fear and perplexity and stress verse 27
[5:28] and then shall they see the son of man
[5:30] coming in in a cloud with power and
[5:32] great glory and when these things begin
[5:34] to come to pass then look up and lift up
[5:37] your heads for your Redemption draw nigh
[5:40] and he spake to them a parable behold
[5:42] the Fig Tree and all the trees when they
[5:45] now shoot forth ye see and know of
[5:47] yourselves that summer is now nigh at
[5:50] hand so the Fig Tree is typed as Israel
[5:53] and all the other trees in other words
[5:55] everything begins to come into this
[5:57] Bloom and this summertime and and begins
[5:59] to come into its full manifestation all
[6:02] things bad or good come to full
[6:05] manifestation at the end time and when
[6:07] we see them come to full manifestation
[6:10] when we see the Fig Tree Israel become a
[6:13] nation and come under their own nation
[6:14] and now looking for their Revival when
[6:16] we see all of the Nations and all the
[6:18] spirits come to a head and manifest all
[6:21] the trees coming into that manifestation
[6:24] then we know we're close to the
[6:26] end Jesus said this so likewise ye when
[6:29] you see these things come to pass know
[6:32] ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at
[6:34] hand verily I say un you this generation
[6:36] shall not pass till all be fulfilled
[6:39] look at this now Heaven and Earth shall
[6:42] pass away but my words shall not pass
[6:47] away this is the generation that will
[6:50] observe and watch Heaven and Earth
[6:53] passing
[6:55] away but when we watch that pass away
[6:58] then we always always know that there's
[7:00] one thing that will endure and not
[7:02] become corrupt how many know that every
[7:04] system is becoming
[7:06] corrupt but there's one thing that can't
[7:08] corrupt and that's the word of God the
[7:11] only thing we have left that won't
[7:12] corrupt is the word of God but we'll be
[7:15] the generation that watches as Heaven
[7:17] Earth and things begin to pass away and
[7:20] things begin to fall apart I want you to
[7:22] notice as I preach out of verse 34 this
[7:24] morning and take heed there's this
[7:26] warning to watch yourself Be watchful
[7:29] take heed to yourselves it's a personal
[7:32] thing in this hour take heed to
[7:34] yourselves lest at any time your hearts
[7:38] become overcharged with surfing and
[7:41] drunkenness and cares and worries of
[7:44] this life and so that day come upon you
[7:48] unawares for as a snare shall it come on
[7:52] all them that dwell on the face of the
[7:55] whole earth I want to speak this morning
[7:58] on the Cure for emotional and mental
[8:03] instability God never left us without a
[8:07] cure but you can see Jesus said in verse
[8:10] 34 that we could be affected and our
[8:14] emotional life would be depleted because
[8:17] of the fear in in this generation all
[8:20] will be affected by
[8:21] it and we can become emotionally and
[8:25] mentally
[8:27] depleted but God
[8:31] but
[8:31] God provides for his people in that hour
[8:35] he gives the Cure so I'm looking here
[8:38] this morning at Jesus depiction of our
[8:40] day and uh prophesying and giving us
[8:43] exactly the characteristics of our time
[8:46] and we can see a last warning here that
[8:49] our hearts not become weighed down when
[8:52] he says overcharged it means our hearts
[8:55] become weighed down our hearts become
[8:57] drained our Spirits become emotionally
[9:01] drained and uh we should be on guard for
[9:03] that as Christians he's not just talking
[9:05] to everybody but particularly Christians
[9:08] he's speaking directly to us because he
[9:10] says if you if you catch it take heed to
[9:13] yourselves it's a personal thing that
[9:15] that your hearts that your hearts he's
[9:18] speaking to the elect that your hearts
[9:20] your spirit your emotions don't become
[9:24] depleted and drained be on guard for
[9:26] that in the in one of the amp five
[9:29] versions it says take heed to yourselves
[9:31] and be on guard lest your hearts be
[9:34] overburdened and depressed weighed down
[9:37] with G with the giddiness and headache
[9:41] and nausea of
[9:44] self-indulgence
[9:46] drunkenness and worldly worries and
[9:49] cares pertaining to the business of this
[9:53] life we live there friends this is dead
[9:57] on of what we go through through to
[9:59] deplete us
[10:01] emotionally so I'm going to read it
[10:02] again that we become depressed and
[10:04] weighed down with the giddiness and the
[10:07] headache and the nausea of
[10:09] self-indulgence drunkenness because
[10:11] that's what the world world teaches us
[10:12] to be in other words they have things to
[10:15] answer to this scare they have things to
[10:18] answer to this fear when we're
[10:20] emotionally feeling shaky and unstable
[10:22] then they have answers but they're
[10:24] temporary answers they're temporary
[10:26] fixes for it and so so so so now the
[10:30] headache the giddiness the nausea of
[10:32] self-indulgence that's what the the
[10:34] world wants you to do drunkenness and
[10:36] worldly worries and cares pertaining to
[10:38] the business of the of this life lest
[10:41] that day come upon you suddenly like a
[10:44] trap or a news and the last verse in 35
[10:47] says for as a snare shall it come so now
[10:50] a snare is a trap for an animal it gets
[10:52] you snared it gets your heart snared it
[10:55] gets you under a bind can you say amen
[10:57] and the world's going to do that but
[10:59] Believers got to say wait a minute now
[11:01] I'm not supposed to be bound by anything
[11:03] this is just about time for Redemption
[11:05] I'm supposed to look up and lift my head
[11:07] up can you say Amen I'm not like the
[11:10] statistics to get burdened down by this
[11:12] I have a source that I can go to I have
[11:15] a fountain that I can drink from God has
[11:18] given his word to this generation and
[11:21] that word is sufficient to take care of
[11:23] our need during this time as a matter of
[11:26] fact his word you don't think it well
[11:28] it's for my soul the words for my soul
[11:30] no God provides for emotional depletion
[11:33] God provides to fill you God provides
[11:35] for a sound mind God provides any
[11:37] instability that you're feeling can you
[11:39] say amen God provides for it what I find
[11:43] is most of our Generations are turning
[11:44] to other things for their emotional
[11:48] stability oh brother PA you going to go
[11:50] there I'm going to go
[11:52] there I'm finding that a lot of us are
[11:55] turning to other things to fill our are
[11:59] a void our void emotionally David
[12:02] Courtright wrote in a book a couple 2019
[12:05] he wrote a book called We're the age of
[12:07] addiction the age of addiction you can
[12:08] look it up and uh David Courtright
[12:11] writes that we are the complete age of
[12:13] addiction and the summary for the book
[12:15] he said at the beginning he says we live
[12:17] in an age of addiction from compulsive
[12:20] gaming and shopping to binge eating so
[12:24] now when we think of addiction we think
[12:26] of marijuana we think of someone in an
[12:28] insanus Al someone uh a dope adct and so
[12:31] that's the addiction we think of but
[12:32] this fell he's mentioned we're addictive
[12:34] Society we have a lot of things that are
[12:36] addictions can you say amen and he says
[12:38] it's addiction from compulsive gaming
[12:41] and shopping to binge eating and opio
[12:43] opioid I never can say that word opioid
[12:46] abuse sugar can be as habit forming as
[12:50] cocaine researchers tell us and social
[12:53] media apps are hooking our
[12:57] kids but what can we do to resist
[13:01] temptations that insidiously and
[13:04] deliberately rewire our brains what's he
[13:06] saying all these things over time rewire
[13:09] our
[13:10] brains they mess with our sound
[13:14] thinking what can we do that that we can
[13:19] resist the temptation that insidiously
[13:22] and deliberately rewire our brains he
[13:24] said nothing nothing David Courtright
[13:27] says unless we understand Theory history
[13:29] and character of the global Enterprises
[13:31] and the the corporations unless we
[13:33] understand the history and character of
[13:35] them that create and cater to our bad
[13:41] habits so you can read the book because
[13:43] then he explores of course he doesn't
[13:45] have the answer he says or not really
[13:47] answer but he said maybe we could look
[13:48] at all the corporates that are
[13:50] contributing the corporations and
[13:51] Enterprises contributing knowing that we
[13:53] have this weakness knowing that America
[13:55] is this way knowing that we lean towards
[13:58] addiction because of our emotional
[13:59] depletion knowing that they gauge
[14:02] everything in entertainment and in uh
[14:04] selling whatever it is they gauge it so
[14:07] that they can become they can become uh
[14:10] the Creator and keater to our bad habits
[14:14] in other words some in some ways we can
[14:16] help
[14:17] you but when they go to help you it's
[14:20] not really helping you it's leading you
[14:23] more and more to addiction because guess
[14:25] why they want you to be addicted to
[14:26] their product because they make money
[14:29] right amen it's all about the Mighty
[14:31] Dollar come on now they're going to make
[14:34] money off of you they're going to make
[14:35] money off of medicines they're going to
[14:37] make money and trust me today I am not
[14:39] criticizing I'm not criticizing
[14:41] something that helps a person but I'm
[14:43] here as a gospel Minister that has to
[14:44] point you to what Jesus said and that we
[14:47] Believers guard ourselves be from
[14:49] becoming to addict too addictive to
[14:51] something that is is to be the all
[14:54] answer for our emotional depletion how
[14:57] many know addictions start somewhere man
[15:00] provides all kinds of remedies of all
[15:01] kinds where does all this start though
[15:04] the craving number one the craving in
[15:06] the soul for peace let's start with The
[15:10] Soul Man without the Peace of the holy
[15:13] spirit in his life the Holy Ghost in his
[15:15] life will be craving that his entire
[15:17] life and Satan has alternatives to bring
[15:20] that peace to his soul in other words
[15:22] being settled with
[15:23] God being settled being settled that God
[15:27] I've accepted his
[15:29] his uh his uh journey to Calvary I
[15:32] accepted what he's done I receive What
[15:34] the Lord Has Done For Me because I'm a
[15:36] sinner I need to be saved every person
[15:39] in this room was born a sinner
[15:40] unacceptable to God but the problem is
[15:43] is we try to do good works and we try to
[15:45] do things that would give us a little
[15:48] bit of temporary peace to make us feel
[15:49] good in our soul but God says I don't
[15:51] want you to do that I want you to
[15:53] receive me and you receive peace come to
[15:56] me all ye that are weary and heavy laden
[15:59] why are they weary why are they heavy
[16:01] laden trying to get peace on their own
[16:04] but God says come to me for your peace
[16:07] come to me for your settlement and I
[16:10] will give rest for your
[16:13] souls so a man or woman can come to
[16:16] complete rest in their soul level that
[16:19] they are it's been settled God has
[16:22] accepted me because I have accepted his
[16:25] Calvary experience I've accepted what
[16:27] he's done for me and now I'm accepted
[16:29] not because I earned it not because I
[16:31] deserve it but he has accepted me
[16:33] already he died for my sins and it meets
[16:35] the craving but if you don't find that
[16:38] if she doesn't find that they will
[16:40] search their whole life because they got
[16:42] a craving in their soul you have a
[16:45] craving in your
[16:46] soul and the other bad part is people
[16:49] fill it with religion they fill it with
[16:51] something that they do if I can just do
[16:54] this and make Mommy and Daddy happy or
[16:56] make brother Paul happy and if I could
[16:58] just just wear this and if I could just
[16:59] be this and be a good girl and do all
[17:01] this stuff so you move into that mode of
[17:03] putting something on the outside but a
[17:05] lot of people they still haven't met the
[17:07] craving on the
[17:09] inside there's a craving that no dress
[17:13] no outward religion there's a craving
[17:15] then none of that will ever satisfy it's
[17:18] his spirit that pours out in your life
[17:21] as you accept it and all of a sudden
[17:24] peace comes that I am at peace with God
[17:26] I am in relationship with God let the
[17:29] world fall apart I am at peace with him
[17:32] here and on the broadcast and on the
[17:35] internet wherever you are I pray you'll
[17:37] seek God to meet that craving in your
[17:40] soul addiction uh originates in three
[17:42] main things and that is a past family
[17:46] dysfunction a past family dysfunction
[17:49] and then the second thing is a real bad
[17:51] trauma happened in life that's the
[17:54] second thing a past family dysfunction a
[17:57] real bad family a a real bad trauma that
[18:00] happened to you whether it happened to
[18:01] you when you're 5 years old or they
[18:03] happened to you last week it's a trauma
[18:06] to your spirit it's a trauma to your
[18:08] emotions and third thing is the pressure
[18:11] of the Demonic realm existing that we
[18:14] live in now is there's a pressure from
[18:16] the Demonic realm particularly the
[18:18] sexual Temptation and the saturation of
[18:20] filthy sexual things in front of
[18:23] us so it's saturated with that and that
[18:26] brings a pressure on the human spirit
[18:28] a Temptation on the human Spirit you're
[18:31] trying to hold to God but around us is
[18:33] this demonic Force this demonic pressure
[18:36] especially on our young people but it's
[18:38] on every it's on everywhere so three
[18:40] things can cause people to to to run
[18:43] towards some addiction to help them
[18:44] relieve and calm themselves but you got
[18:46] to go back to the source that some past
[18:48] family dysfunction took place you grew
[18:51] up with something that affected you and
[18:53] and we might as well be honest every you
[18:55] know I like to say that uh you know uh
[18:57] the people come to our church and people
[18:59] come and they come from dysfunctional
[19:01] families um probably most of us come
[19:04] from some dysfunction from our
[19:07] family oh I had a pretty good Dad Mom I
[19:10] had a pretty good life most of us come
[19:12] and then I always like to say we all
[19:14] were born from a dysfunctional family
[19:17] Adam and Eve it's these things that lead
[19:19] to looking for
[19:21] remedies a family a family
[19:24] trauma the a family dysfunction a bad
[19:27] trauma that happened to your life and
[19:30] the de demonic realm we're fighting
[19:32] against if these things in these things
[19:34] then it leads to looking for remedies
[19:35] everybody I want you to just think of
[19:37] not just think of medicine this morning
[19:39] when I think of Remedies okay uh I don't
[19:41] want you to think of just
[19:44] medicine there are hundreds of other
[19:48] remedies to
[19:51] fill the
[19:53] emotional inst stable person
[19:57] entertainment
[20:01] books
[20:03] music
[20:05] movies
[20:07] Fashions social media
[20:10] gaming
[20:12] sports role
[20:14] playing
[20:16] meditation
[20:18] concerts things that emotionally charge
[20:21] us a concert will emotionally charge us
[20:25] even Christian concerts
[20:30] now you trust me now even highly charged
[20:33] emotional gospel
[20:35] meetings even camp
[20:39] meetings that are emotionally charged
[20:41] and I'm not talking about the ones that
[20:43] are preaching the word of God in the
[20:44] right thing but emotionally charged will
[20:47] appeal to someone who's is drained
[20:49] emotionally but listen listen be careful
[20:52] because someone could be be be come into
[20:55] an emotionally charged atmosphere and be
[20:57] affected emotionally by it and get very
[20:59] excited but it still can be just a
[21:02] temporary emotional fix because when you
[21:05] go back you have the same addiction when
[21:07] you go back you have nothing to overcome
[21:09] with it's a deception just to present an
[21:13] emotional atmosphere so people feel so
[21:15] great at camp but then they don't feel
[21:18] so great when they get home P cost did
[21:20] that it's a charge emotionally many
[21:22] times and God was doing good things
[21:24] through that praise the Lord and He will
[21:26] do that but always be on guard that you
[21:28] don't fill your emotional
[21:30] instability with just another
[21:32] emotionally charged concert or service
[21:36] so something becomes addictive when
[21:38] physically and mentally we become
[21:40] dependent on a particular substance and
[21:42] unable to stop taking it without
[21:45] incurring adverse effects that's the
[21:47] meaning out of the dictionary of what
[21:49] addic addict being addictive is
[21:51] physically and mentally dependent on a
[21:53] particular substance and unable to stop
[21:55] taking it without incurring adverse
[21:57] effects in other words enthusiastically
[22:00] here another meaning to addictive
[22:01] enthusiastically devoted to a particular
[22:04] thing or an
[22:05] activity that's not
[22:07] Drugs That's enthusiastically devoted to
[22:10] a particular thing or an
[22:12] activity that can become an addiction
[22:15] and what's the addiction from trying to
[22:17] fill an emotional
[22:19] need people go to all kinds of sources
[22:22] to fill their emotional need and I'm
[22:24] here to tell you this morning some of
[22:26] them are good some of are own okay but
[22:28] we can't only go to those things we have
[22:32] to go to God even for our emotional and
[22:36] mental stability so the devil deceives
[22:39] Us in that that Bible oh this this
[22:41] there's nothing in here as I read
[22:43] there's nothing in here for me feeling
[22:45] emotionally unstable right now it's got
[22:47] to be something it's not in here that's
[22:48] a lie that's a lie in the presence of
[22:52] the Lord in his word as we as we stay
[22:54] with it young people stay with it read
[22:56] it say God reveal it to me cuz there is
[22:58] a filling of our emotional need even it
[23:01] fills our souls it fills our minds it
[23:04] fills our bodies even physical healing
[23:07] is in the word of
[23:08] God we can't buy into the deception that
[23:11] modern problems and the reason I'm
[23:13] feeling emotionally depleted because of
[23:15] an incident a trauma that happened the
[23:17] reason I the the the answer for it has
[23:20] got to be some somewhere else some
[23:22] people even seek emotional fing from
[23:25] their own families and I even do that
[23:28] you know we we love our families and so
[23:31] we we gravitate towards them but it's
[23:33] still limited it's still not the
[23:37] fulfilling that we need to fill with can
[23:40] I get an amen amen your wife your
[23:43] husband a boyfriend a girlfriend young
[23:45] people will will fill the void of their
[23:48] craving for fellowship and they think
[23:50] that the answer all is if I can just be
[23:53] closer to this person and and and they
[23:55] can feel and then they start doing it
[23:57] they start filling that void that
[23:59] craving that's within them and they this
[24:01] is the answer so now we need to do this
[24:03] we need to move on and so you have to be
[24:05] careful though because you have to fill
[24:07] your Void emotionally first with our
[24:10] lord Jesus
[24:11] first because if it's only in that
[24:14] boyfriend or girlfriend or that husband
[24:16] or wife it will disappoint you someday
[24:19] and you still feel a lack on the inside
[24:22] it has to be with our loving savior that
[24:25] we find that emotional stability so now
[24:28] uh we keep going back and it's feeling
[24:31] an emotional thing that we have need of
[24:33] but it's temporary many times it's not
[24:35] solving the problem but we keep going
[24:38] back and we keep going back we're still
[24:39] not settled and stable and our emotions
[24:41] are our thinking and so there's no sense
[24:43] being critical of dope addicts this
[24:45] morning and and marijuana there's no
[24:48] sense in yeah they're an addict they're
[24:51] addicted to that thing look at your own
[24:53] life what are you feeling your emotional
[24:56] need with more than likely there's
[24:57] something
[24:58] something calms you calms your nerves
[25:01] sometimes laughing calms our nerves and
[25:02] comedians will get us to laugh and we'll
[25:05] forget all of our problems because
[25:06] emotionally that's what it does but when
[25:07] we go back home we have the same
[25:09] problems we haven't solved the issues
[25:12] and we've been we've been refilled a
[25:14] little bit by laughter and we laugh and
[25:15] we enjoy it you can even come to church
[25:18] like this and temporarily feel good but
[25:20] there has to be something deeper in our
[25:22] lives something more lasting something
[25:24] more consistent I believe I'm going to
[25:26] bring that answer to you here this
[25:27] morning morning but the God on the
[25:29] mountain is still God in the
[25:33] valley and if you only like the god in
[25:36] the mountain and you're going to just
[25:37] travel to camp meetings and you only
[25:39] like to live on the emotional highs you
[25:42] haven't really got to know God in the
[25:44] valley yet and if you're going to grow
[25:46] in the Lord you have to know God in the
[25:48] valley because the same God that was in
[25:50] the emotional high can you say Amen is
[25:53] the same God that's with
[25:55] you in your lows and you cling to him
[25:59] you don't cling to some entertainment
[26:01] you don't cling to some relieving of
[26:02] your nerves if you have to do that
[26:04] medicine I'm not condemning that I'm
[26:06] just saying don't cling to that and not
[26:08] to God cling to God I don't understand
[26:10] anything right now I just want to see my
[26:12] life end please take me Lord take me
[26:14] home Henry has that song he wrote take
[26:16] me home take me home I have to play it
[26:19] to myself one time I have to play it
[26:21] because that's how you feel Lord just
[26:22] take me home end all of this I'm ready
[26:26] to go
[26:29] he's writing that because that's how you
[26:30] feel we're weak and God gets Glory when
[26:34] we're admitting that we're weak and that
[26:36] we cannot depend on anything else but
[26:38] God can you say
[26:40] Amen we're weak in ourselves and when
[26:43] we're weak then God can express his
[26:45] strength through our
[26:48] weakness it's humility to say I can't do
[26:51] this on my own and I'm not going to turn
[26:53] to something else to meet my emotional
[26:55] void turning to my God
[26:58] God I'm you don't think other prophets
[26:59] and other people in the Bible Christ
[27:01] said I've been mistreated i' it's been
[27:03] it's unfair I'm the hounds of hell are
[27:06] after me I've got a jezebel after me I
[27:08] don't know what it is but God I turn to
[27:11] you I will not turn to anything else I
[27:13] am emotionally instable right now and
[27:16] I'm willing to admit it but God I'm
[27:18] staying right here until you answer and
[27:20] you come and you feel this need you feel
[27:24] my emotional instability you make me
[27:26] stable I'm not preaching against things
[27:28] sometimes that would would relax us but
[27:31] we cannot we cannot make that the the
[27:34] fill
[27:35] all for being depleted
[27:38] emotionally we can't we can't do it and
[27:41] when Jesus
[27:42] said be careful that your hearts become
[27:45] overburdened and depressed by all this
[27:48] around you and your emotions are
[27:52] depleted you know all that pressure was
[27:54] in
[27:55] direct resistance and conflict to the
[27:58] scripture before that was our answer
