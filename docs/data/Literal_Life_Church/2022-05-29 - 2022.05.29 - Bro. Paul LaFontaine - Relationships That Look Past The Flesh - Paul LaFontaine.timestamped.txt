[0:00] chapter 5 i'm picking up
[0:02] the scripture that i left off with last
[0:04] sunday
[0:05] second corinthians chapter 5.
[0:08] and we'll read together starting at
[0:09] verse 14.
[0:23] for the love of christ constraineth us
[0:26] that means the love of christ controls
[0:28] and compels us
[0:30] how many want to be compelled by the
[0:32] love of christ
[0:34] the love of christ constraineth us
[0:37] because we thus judge that if one died
[0:39] for all
[0:40] then we're all dead and that he died for
[0:43] all that they which live
[0:46] should from
[0:47] should not henceforth live unto
[0:49] themselves but unto him which died for
[0:51] them and rose again
[0:53] wherefore henceforth
[0:55] know we no man after the flesh ye though
[0:59] we know have known christ after the
[1:00] flesh yet now henceforth know we him no
[1:03] more so we don't know christ in the
[1:05] flesh christ is not in his own flesh of
[1:08] 2000 years ago here today we don't know
[1:10] him that way but we know him by
[1:12] revelation we know he's real we know
[1:14] he's a person
[1:15] uh he's just as real the only part
[1:17] that's missing he's not in his flesh he
[1:19] fulfilled those days for a certain time
[1:22] uh i believe it was three and a half
[1:24] years of ministry we had 33 years on
[1:25] earth so we don't know him we never knew
[1:28] christ in that flesh body we will see
[1:30] him someday but we don't know him but we
[1:32] know him by revelation can you say amen
[1:35] but also paul's teaching us that from
[1:37] henceforth we know no man in other words
[1:40] we don't look at one another by the
[1:42] flesh as christians we're not viewing
[1:44] one another by the flesh
[1:47] by but by the seed that's on the inside
[1:49] the christ that's inside someone and you
[1:52] say well i know people they don't have
[1:54] christ but always always the potential
[1:56] is there that they're a seed that's not
[1:58] been dramatized yet so even with an
[2:01] unbeliever we're always praying and
[2:03] looking at them through eyes of christ
[2:06] to say is the potential there
[2:09] you see so and and how many knows that's
[2:10] the way god looked at us
[2:12] it's a good thing some of you in the
[2:14] world some of you out there and i mean
[2:16] you know you're the least likely to
[2:18] receive this and yet you're here today
[2:20] hungry for the word of god somebody
[2:22] looked at you beyond your faults
[2:24] and saw your need and somebody seen that
[2:26] you were seen of god and god was the
[2:28] first one that looked at you that way if
[2:30] god looks at that's us that way then we
[2:32] have to look at one another that way now
[2:34] i want to add in a scripture back in the
[2:36] book of romans just one scripture
[2:39] and uh paul says something here um that
[2:42] adds with the strip the subject this
[2:44] morning and i just want to
[2:47] title this relationships i've been
[2:49] speaking on relationships relationships
[2:51] that look past the flesh
[2:54] relationships that look past the flesh
[2:56] and paul says romans 7 and verse
[3:00] 18. now he's talking about himself
[3:04] for i know
[3:05] paul's talking about himself for i know
[3:07] that in me that is in my flesh
[3:10] dwelleth no good thing
[3:13] for to will is present with me but how
[3:16] to perform that which is good i find not
[3:18] and so i want you to just remember the
[3:20] first part there
[3:22] this is a prophet
[3:25] how many believe paul was a prophet
[3:27] and the prophet says about himself not
[3:30] the self that's the part of christ but
[3:32] he says i know and this is almost a
[3:35] revelation that you have to have about
[3:37] yourself first and others i know
[3:40] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[3:44] no good thing
[3:46] that's a prophet talking
[3:49] so how much confidence should we put in
[3:50] the flesh
[3:52] if there's no good thing it's nothing we
[3:54] can offer to god it's it's a mess can
[3:57] you say the only hope that the flesh has
[3:59] is that you have the holy ghost
[4:00] controlling the flesh and bringing it
[4:02] under subjection but in it in itself
[4:04] there's no good thing in it even a
[4:06] prophet of god and if he said that about
[4:08] himself then certainly if he was a
[4:10] prophet and there was no good in his
[4:12] flesh there's certainly no good in our
[4:13] flesh whatsoever amen it's only through
[4:16] christ that anything good can come out
[4:18] of us
[4:19] amen father bless your word today as we
[4:21] teach it to the people and you know my
[4:23] prayers today
[4:26] going up before your throne that lord
[4:29] the things that are impossible to change
[4:30] you'd change them through the glory of
[4:33] your word
[4:34] and lord i've i've presented to you also
[4:38] my
[4:39] incapabilities lord and my weakness to
[4:41] help these souls and these people
[4:44] lord if we invite you on the scene today
[4:46] and you break through the every barrier
[4:48] lord you'd come and feel welcome among
[4:50] us as we invite you lord you can do
[4:52] miraculous things through your word
[4:55] thank you for your word thank you gave
[4:57] us our the word the best thing you could
[4:59] have given us lord because when we
[5:01] preach your word and you come and
[5:03] identify yourself with it then your
[5:04] presence comes and begins to do what we
[5:07] can't do so we'll preach it lord but
[5:09] we're asking for you to show up today
[5:11] we're asking you to break through every
[5:14] wall every barrier we're asking father
[5:16] that you would take those things lord
[5:18] that seem impossible to us
[5:20] and you make them possible lord through
[5:22] the word we love you father we're
[5:24] thankful to serve you today bless every
[5:27] family every heart that's here everyone
[5:29] listening i just pray you'll bless them
[5:31] encourage them and strengthen them in
[5:33] the word in jesus name amen
[5:36] god bless you once you shake hands again
[5:38] to guinea and probably had you do that
[5:39] but
[5:40] god bless you this morning
[5:48] as i ended the service last
[5:51] sunday
[5:53] my conclusion coming to that was
[5:56] speaking about the condition that adam
[5:59] and eve were in before the fall just
[6:01] before the fall
[6:03] and i'll just summarize from last sunday
[6:05] to say again that just before the fall
[6:08] adam could not look at eve any other way
[6:11] except as being a part of him
[6:13] when he looked at her he did not see
[6:15] necessarily just the flesh although the
[6:17] flesh was there she was a different
[6:18] vessel but the way he viewed her was to
[6:21] be one with him in other words you are
[6:23] bone of my bone you are flesh of my
[6:25] flesh we're not two separate individuals
[6:28] in the sense of by spirit in spirit we
[6:31] are one and so thus in order to see that
[6:33] he could not stumble or he couldn't look
[6:35] at just the flesh he had to be looking
[6:37] at just that she was one with him and uh
[6:41] and in that she was never a separate
[6:43] entity or treated like a separate entity
[6:46] even though by vessel she was god had
[6:48] separated the masculine and feminine we
[6:50] know that but just before the fall
[6:53] adam was not looking at the flesh he was
[6:56] looking at something deeper and i would
[6:58] like to just today go further unto the
[7:00] into this subject
[7:02] and talk a little bit about how much we
[7:05] look at the flesh
[7:07] because whether we want to admit it or
[7:08] not we still are very much fleshly prone
[7:14] even though that we may be in christ but
[7:16] we're you see in christ we're learning
[7:19] that we cannot judge things by the flesh
[7:22] we cannot look at an individual and make
[7:25] a a judgment or a diagnosis just based
[7:28] upon the flesh if god looks at us that
[7:31] way and if adam looked at his wife that
[7:33] way then we have got to grow out of
[7:35] viewing things and looking at the flesh
[7:37] can you say amen and so i want to go
[7:40] into how much we still look at the flesh
[7:43] and then how that affects relationships
[7:45] because if we're only fleshly driven
[7:48] for example if a husband only looks at a
[7:51] a wife and her weaknesses and he begins
[7:53] to dishonor her and only views her
[7:55] according to the flesh he will become
[7:57] disappointed he will be angry he will be
[7:59] upset if a wife looks at her husband
[8:01] only according to his fleshly ways or
[8:04] just the way that he is she will become
[8:06] disappointed and guess what happens the
[8:08] relationship starts to get broken
[8:10] because you lose honor for what you
[8:12] really are a lot of a lot of times
[8:14] marriages just lose their original
[8:16] romance they lose their original
[8:18] attraction to one another because why
[8:20] for years you look at the flesh and you
[8:22] know the flesh now and the flesh begins
[8:25] to smother out the way that you should
[8:27] look at one another brother brown says
[8:30] that we should as long as we're married
[8:31] we should treat them as a son and
[8:33] daughter of god
[8:36] as a sister in christ as a brother in
[8:38] christ that's the highest honor no
[8:40] matter how much daily life goes on and
[8:42] you have differences and you might have
[8:44] even little uh disagreements we've got
[8:47] to keep honor and respect at how we look
[8:49] at one another that this is a daughter
[8:52] of god and she is to be treated like a
[8:54] daughter of god this is the son of god
[8:57] and he is to be treated like a son of
[8:59] god
[9:01] amen and it goes in churches as well is
[9:04] that if you only look at the flesh of
[9:06] your congregation or your church if you
[9:08] keep viewing things if you look at your
[9:10] pastor only by the flesh then that will
[9:12] be smothering out what his position
[9:14] really is who he is as the son of god a
[9:16] pastor can't help you anymore if you
[9:18] only view him by the flesh a
[9:20] congregation cannot help you anymore if
[9:23] you only look at all the flesh of the
[9:24] people and all their quirks and all
[9:26] their personality differences and all
[9:28] the things that irritate you
[9:31] i know none of that happens with any of
[9:33] you nobody's ever irritated you but
[9:35] things irritate me
[9:37] i'm being honest today
[9:40] but if we take this it applies to
[9:42] relationships because if we're only
[9:45] looking at the flesh it will affect
[9:48] relationships
[9:52] and i'm going to show at the end
[9:54] some examples in jesus
[9:56] showing the contrast in himself because
[9:59] when jesus came of course he was the
[10:00] perfect son of god and he began to be
[10:03] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[10:04] was the
[10:05] the mystery of what god wanted to
[10:07] express through man he was the first
[10:09] time
[10:10] we
[10:11] began to see what god looks like in
[10:13] flesh because we've never seen it in its
[10:15] fullness before jesus was christ with
[10:18] mystery it was the mystery of god
[10:19] revealed we never got to see what god
[10:21] would look like in flesh until jesus
[10:24] came on the scene we finally get to see
[10:26] what does god look like in flesh and
[10:28] when he began that he began a whole
[10:30] kingdom of sons and daughters of god who
[10:32] would be in the flesh who would be in
[10:35] sin born bodies who would be born in sin
[10:37] shaped in iniquity saved filled with the
[10:40] holy ghost and then with the holy ghost
[10:42] they still live in their flesh in other
[10:44] words they still have the potential to
[10:46] walk in the flesh instead of the spirit
[10:50] and with all of that because of the
[10:52] perfect example of jesus christ he came
[10:56] into viewing and seeing things
[10:58] by by a vision by the righteousness of
[11:01] god in other words jesus was viewing
[11:04] everybody he's seen
[11:05] not through the lens of flesh because
[11:08] there's some people that came to him if
[11:09] he had been looking at the flesh he
[11:11] would have never given them the hope of
[11:13] what god could bring to them but because
[11:15] he was looking beyond the flesh he knew
[11:18] and he could see whether they were a
[11:19] seed of god or not he could see whether
[11:21] they were a god of god nobody else they
[11:23] were looking at the woman at the well
[11:25] nobody else could see she was a daughter
[11:26] of god but because jesus was not looking
[11:29] at the flesh he could look inside and
[11:31] see there's a seedling there this is the
[11:33] daughter of god if jesus did that then
[11:36] we have to do it as well
[11:41] i'm talking about relationships i'm
[11:42] talking about growing
[11:44] into christ's likeness and how we view
[11:46] things so at the end
[11:48] if i get to it and i want to i want to
[11:50] show a contrast between how jesus was
[11:52] seeing things and how the pharisees were
[11:55] viewing things because the most
[11:56] religious people on the face of the
[11:58] earth viewed everything
[12:01] according
[12:02] to the flesh
[12:05] and when somebody didn't line up
[12:07] their only answer was is that if they
[12:10] need to line up with a with the law they
[12:12] need to line up with the law they need
[12:14] to lie because they were all about
[12:15] appearance they were all about flesh
[12:17] this person's flesh is the meth and
[12:18] their only hope is to get under our
[12:20] religion and line up with all the do's
[12:22] and don'ts and then we'll be happy then
[12:23] they'll be right they had no vision for
[12:26] the righteousness of god they had no
[12:28] vision for the seed of god they're the
[12:30] daughters of god that this did not come
[12:32] by a law but it came by the spirit of
[12:35] life coming in an individual and
[12:37] changing their lives transforming their
[12:39] lives
[12:42] so let's not put it on the pharisees
[12:43] let's say how much do us sometimes look
[12:46] religiously like the pharisees and view
[12:49] everything according to how we see in
[12:52] the flesh
[12:55] i'm believing that this series would
[12:57] help
[12:58] build stronger marriages
[13:01] build stronger church
[13:02] build stronger relationship with with
[13:05] children and parents
[13:06] that's my prayer in this series because
[13:08] once we understand
[13:10] god's oneness and god's glory coming in
[13:13] us we'll never view things the same
[13:15] we're looking for god's glory in the
[13:17] next individual
[13:20] praise the lord so now i want to get
[13:22] into those things but we were looking at
[13:24] before the fall
[13:26] and
[13:28] i just would like to just take first
[13:30] because i read the quotes last week but
[13:31] i want to go into another quote let's
[13:33] just take a quick look at how god viewed
[13:35] eve before the fall and i particularly
[13:37] mentioned eve because we know that he
[13:39] created man a spirit man he was created
[13:41] in the image of god so he was a spirit
[13:43] man first before he was a flesh man
[13:46] and i keep repeating these things
[13:47] because i want everybody understand
[13:49] include including the children when god
[13:52] created a man he says i created him in
[13:53] my own image and so god was a spirit so
[13:55] the first man adam adam created was not
[13:59] a body like you see it was a spirit man
[14:01] like god then the next thing in genesis
[14:03] 2 then he takes that he breathes life
[14:06] into a vessel and adam had a had a body
[14:08] now so he took that and he put it in
[14:11] there and so then in that body was both
[14:13] masculine and feminine eve was inside of
[14:15] him so then after and later on in the
[14:18] chapter god takes the next step and
[14:20] listen now when he takes eve out of from
[14:23] the rib of adam performs surgery on him
[14:25] and takes him out and adam wakes up and
[14:27] last sunday i elaborated on the first
[14:30] words he said to her and the first time
[14:31] he's seen eve and all that i won't get
[14:33] into that but when he takes her out and
[14:35] he wakes up and he sees eve in front of
[14:37] him bone oh my bone flesh of my bless
[14:39] now we have and this is the way the
[14:41] prophet described it she was not in the
[14:44] original creation as far as this vessel
[14:46] she was in the original creation by
[14:48] spirit she was in adam but now we have a
[14:51] byproduct off of adam made from adam
[14:54] with a different vessel and he puts that
[14:56] feminist part in that different vessel
[14:58] which means that she would be different
[15:00] she would think about things different
[15:02] she would look at life a bit different
[15:05] yet even though she's different there'd
[15:07] still be one
[15:09] so there had to be honor and respect and
[15:10] that respect and that's what adam had so
[15:12] now when he brings that vessel out
[15:15] i want to read a quote here in
[15:16] masterpiece because the way god viewed
[15:19] them in just before the fall
[15:21] god viewed when he looked at adam and
[15:23] eve there in two different vessels
[15:26] we know that when he created adam he
[15:28] created his masterpiece he created the
[15:31] animals he brought all these things on
[15:32] the earth of the world but when he got
[15:35] to adam was god's masterpiece
[15:39] adam was the ultimate adam was the apex
[15:41] adam was everything it was god's
[15:43] masterpiece and he looked at him but
[15:45] look at in this quote when the two
[15:47] separate vessels were there and now to
[15:49] make the two one he put them like any
[15:51] other great sculptor he put them in a
[15:53] place that's beautiful a sculpture
[15:55] wouldn't make a great great masterpiece
[15:57] and then take it and set it in an alley
[15:59] somewhere or hide it behind buildings as
[16:02] our lord told us a man doesn't light a
[16:04] candle and put it under a bushel when we
[16:06] become god's masterpieces we're not hid
[16:09] in an alley somewhere we must give light
[16:12] so we see that after that i love that
[16:14] don't you is that when god had a
[16:15] masterpiece it was so special to him he
[16:18] placed it in a beautiful atmosphere of a
[16:21] garden of eden
[16:22] god didn't place it in an alley can you
[16:24] say amen isn't it wonderful that when we
[16:26] come to the lord and god begins to mold
[16:28] our lives and god looks at the
[16:29] masterpiece he's building in our lives
[16:31] he doesn't want us in some dirty
[16:34] atmosphere he puts us in the very
[16:36] presence of the lord he puts us in good
[16:39] atmospheres at church he puts us in good
[16:42] atmospheres at home that's why the music
[16:44] you play at home and the atmosphere you
[16:46] create at home is ever so important how
[16:48] you grow in the lord because if you
[16:50] believe you're a masterpiece of god and
[16:52] you're a handiwork of god you god wants
[16:55] to put you in the right atmospheres as
[16:57] well
[16:59] so he says there now i want you to
[17:02] notice so we see that he
[17:04] after he had made this masterpiece he
[17:06] placed it up here on the earth and put
[17:08] it in the most beautiful place it was in
[17:10] the garden of eden he placed his
[17:11] masterpiece the two being one so god's
[17:15] looking at two but he is still seeing it
[17:18] as his masterpiece
[17:22] you see what are you trying to say well
[17:24] i'll tell you here in a minute
[17:26] he put he said he placed his masterpiece
[17:29] the two now we would think well it's
[17:31] just a few scriptures before that god's
[17:34] looking at the masterpiece adam no no
[17:36] he's looking at both vessels separate
[17:39] now and he's still viewing it as his
[17:42] masterpiece even though eve is a
[17:45] byproduct
[17:46] say why are you preaching this brother
[17:47] ball because i'm looking at how god sees
[17:50] us
[17:53] because brother brahm said we're a
[17:55] by-product like eve was
[17:58] we're a byproduct we're born in sin
[17:59] shaped in iniquity can you say amen we
[18:02] are we're not we're we're not what we
[18:03] originally should have been so now we're
[18:05] a byproduct but when god looked at adam
[18:08] and eve in two separate vessels he's
[18:10] still before the fall he's still seen
[18:12] them as the masterpiece that he had
[18:14] created
[18:15] even though she's a byproduct now
[18:18] so let me finish the quote he says now
[18:19] how how it must have pleased him that he
[18:23] saw this masterpiece as well he after
[18:27] that we find out that he rested he was
[18:29] so pleased with his work so he's
[18:32] referring to just before the fall which
[18:34] is what i've been preaching on not adam
[18:36] is one vessel with masculine and
[18:38] feminine but two vessels separated two
[18:42] vessels and god is still looking at it
[18:45] as his masterpiece
[18:48] i want you to notice even
[18:50] now before the fall he's looking at it
[18:52] and now i want to take it further to say
[18:54] even after the fall
[18:56] because the prophet taught us that when
[18:59] the masterpiece was marred and they fell
[19:01] in the garden of eden and he began to
[19:03] restore them from that point on he began
[19:05] to do the work of redemption god even
[19:07] looked and he refers to michelangelo
[19:10] doing the statue of moses and one day
[19:14] michelangelo i'm just telling this for
[19:15] those who don't know one day
[19:17] michelangelo is creating that that
[19:19] that statue of moses and one day it just
[19:22] becomes so perfect and so real to him
[19:26] and he just strikes it with one of his
[19:27] tools he said speak he was so inspired
[19:30] that it was so real he strikes it and
[19:32] then there was a flaw in the masterpiece
[19:34] and brother bradham taught us later that
[19:37] it was the flaw in the masterpiece
[19:40] that actually made it a masterpiece
[19:45] now we don't think that way
[19:47] we think if there's a flaw
[19:50] we're looking at the flesh
[19:53] but even with the flaw and that's when
[19:55] he brought christ christ was god's
[19:57] masterpiece he was perfect but then at
[20:00] calvary it was like michelangelo took
[20:02] that that spirit the soldier took the
[20:04] spear and pierced him and he made a fall
[20:06] and water and blood came out and now the
[20:08] masterpiece is flawed can you say man
[20:10] but that which came out of him actually
[20:12] made it the masterpiece to make up a
[20:14] bride so god calls his bride masterpiece
[20:17] it doesn't matter that she's a byproduct
[20:19] she's received the spirit of god and god
[20:21] says that's actually what makes her the
[20:23] masterpiece what are you saying
[20:26] redemption is powerful enough to take
[20:28] someone from the miry clay
[20:30] it's actually more powerful to take
[20:32] somebody that's flawed and born in sin
[20:35] shaped in iniquity and raised them up
[20:37] and that flaw that flaw god raises it to
[20:40] redemption and he says when i look at
[20:42] her i look past the flaw and i see a
[20:45] masterpiece
[20:47] [Applause]
[20:49] that's great to talk about that about
[20:50] christ and his bride
[20:52] but what about relationships
[20:55] if god were to keep looking at flaws
[20:59] then it doesn't look like much a
[21:00] masterpiece does it
[21:03] hard to conclude that this is a
[21:05] masterpiece
[21:06] and so he looked at it that way before
[21:08] the fall
[21:09] and i want you to notice something about
[21:13] uh
[21:14] eve when god
[21:17] looked
[21:18] at eve in that different vessel before
[21:20] the fall
[21:22] being a byproduct
[21:25] she had within her the potential
[21:28] to leave the word
[21:32] she had within her
[21:35] the weakness which we know now she did
[21:38] she left the word
[21:40] she fell and left the word and that's
[21:42] how every all of humanity fell but
[21:45] when god looked at her he knew even that
[21:48] she had something within her
[21:50] that could leave the word
[21:52] that could make a mistake
[21:55] and god still
[21:57] would not look at that part
[21:59] in this quote he's looking at her
[22:01] with adam
[22:03] one with adam
[22:05] this is still my masterpiece
[22:08] now he must look at that because i've
[22:10] always said
[22:12] that we might be critical of other
[22:14] people and critical of
[22:15] the shooter this week that showed that
[22:18] shot the 18 19 children
[22:20] just evil minds
[22:22] and i could say a lot about that i've
[22:23] been very angry at that because we never
[22:25] hear in the news ever
[22:27] what the kid fed on for the last 18
[22:29] years i can almost guarantee what he fed
[22:31] on
[22:33] it's tragic it's absolutely tragic
[22:34] because they have no intent now just
[22:36] murdering
[22:37] but see we could take someone like that
[22:39] it's how is a person capable of doing
[22:41] that how in the world could they come to
[22:43] such a spot to take a gun and just mow
[22:46] down children like that in a school
[22:48] and we think the most evil thing in the
[22:50] world
[22:51] but i want to let you know all of you
[22:52] holy people without christ you're
[22:55] capable of the same thing
[23:01] i'm offended at that
[23:03] well that's your problem too is you got
[23:05] pride
[23:06] paul said in my flesh dwelleth no good
[23:09] thing and the flesh without the holy
[23:11] ghost is capable of any thing
[23:16] so maybe you haven't murdered somebody
[23:18] physically like this boy but without the
[23:22] new birth you're capable of doing
[23:24] anything in your flesh
[23:27] capable of taking drugs capable of being
[23:30] coming addicted to things this is the
[23:31] addictive generation addicted to
[23:33] everything can you say man you're
[23:34] capable of all that that's why we have
[23:36] millions falling to addiction they don't
[23:38] have christ they go for an alternative i
[23:40] got to get some relief so i'm going to
[23:41] take drugs to get high and feel a relief
[23:43] everybody's turned into alternatives
[23:45] because this generation is just about
[23:47] completely dead and gone insane because
[23:49] it's without the lord without any hope
[23:51] can you say amen without without
[23:53] anything substance of them to change
[23:55] them
[23:56] thank god for christ today thank god
[24:00] that we have a token thank god that we
[24:02] have the power of the cross to change
[24:05] our lives and offer it to someone else
[24:08] without it there is no hope
[24:13] that's what the world needs i just make
[24:15] one more comment i am so sick of every
[24:16] time we have a shooting all the
[24:18] political debate and the democrats say
[24:20] we need to get rid of guns but the
[24:22] republicans say it's mental health we
[24:24] need to deal with and all of them
[24:26] it's always the same answer
[24:29] and first of all nobody talks about the
[24:30] demons on somebody because the world has
[24:33] no concept of spirit so they're not
[24:35] going to call it a demon which it is
[24:37] it's demon possession and they have no
[24:39] holy spirit to cast it out
[24:41] but at the very least at the very least
[24:44] could you please come to the conclusion
[24:47] that it's not just the mental health
[24:49] issue but it's what they fed on their
[24:51] whole life and what you feed on you
[24:53] actually become and you live out
[24:56] if you're on the video games blasting
[24:58] cop killer and blasting people that you
[25:01] don't even know on the screen and
[25:03] blasting everybody people then you're
[25:05] going to become numb and you're going to
[25:07] take the spirit that you can walk into a
[25:09] school and kill people that you don't
[25:11] know it's the what you fed on can you
[25:13] say man
[25:18] never never come
[25:21] never talk about the conclusions that we
[25:23] need to make
[25:25] i heard one politician say we're in
[25:28] moral failure in this country
[25:31] and we have spirits that are taking over
[25:33] i said
[25:34] wow can you
[25:35] that's a spirit
[25:37] wow somebody calls it a spirit
[25:39] and we have a moral failure in our
[25:41] country we have a moral crisis
[25:44] you're not going to hear very much of
[25:46] that when you hear it you ought to say
[25:47] amen
[25:49] we're not going to bring back this world
[25:51] it's headed for tribulation but here in
[25:53] our little group and little places
[25:54] around the world we have the access to
[25:57] the holy ghost how many believe we still
[25:59] have access to the cross to the power of
[26:01] cross we better be crying out to god for
[26:03] our children we better be crying to god
[26:05] for deliverance in our whole life we
[26:07] better be crying out for a personal
[26:09] revival in our lives how many you say i
[26:11] commit myself to a personal revival in
[26:13] my own life
[26:14] we need god more than we've ever needed
[26:16] before
[26:21] the masterpiece became
[26:23] flawed
[26:24] and even with that even after the fall
[26:26] when god started to you know what even
[26:29] after the fall
[26:30] and men fell and they lost their glory
[26:33] of god and they lost their fellowship
[26:35] then god
[26:36] god began to build a nation with abraham
[26:39] and when he began to build a nation with
[26:41] abraham he began to look at them
[26:44] as their potential because remember i
[26:46] said you have the potential without the
[26:48] new birth of doing the worst capable
[26:49] things oh there's a good person there's
[26:51] a good people praise the lord you know i
[26:53] thank god for good people but without
[26:54] the new birth
[26:57] all the good that they do
[26:59] they have resident within their flesh
[27:02] the potential to do the most dastardly
[27:05] things
[27:06] dastardly is that a word i don't know
[27:10] they have and you have that this morning
[27:14] you have it within you
[27:17] and you know what
[27:19] i think killing somebody's influence is
[27:21] worse than killing somebody physically
[27:23] it's the same spirit
[27:26] but you'll do it because without
[27:28] something to bring that in control
[27:30] you go down all those directions but
[27:32] when he began to build a nation in
[27:34] abraham
[27:35] he began to look at them now here's
[27:37] here's we see you have the potential for
[27:39] evil
[27:40] but when you
[27:41] when god looks at you he begins to see
[27:44] the potential by his grace and he begin
[27:46] to see the potential of his people and
[27:48] when he seen the flaws
[27:50] he still called it a masterpiece in the
[27:52] beginning the flaw made it the
[27:54] masterpiece because the redemption power
[27:56] of god is stronger than the flaw let me
[27:59] say it again why does god look at us he
[28:01] can see who we are in our potential and
[28:04] god can look past the fall because he
[28:07] knows the power of redemption will
[28:10] always be greater than the flaw
[28:18] and god's prophets even seemed
[28:20] indifferent look at here brother i was
[28:22] talking about pharaoh if you look at
[28:23] this next quote this is how pharaoh
[28:25] viewed the israelites in egypt now we
[28:28] find out moses when he fought later how
[28:30] he built he saw israel moses the great
[28:31] prophet he looked out the windows and
[28:33] then then he'll be referring to pharaoh
[28:35] here but pharaoh he was raised in
[28:37] pharaoh moses was raised in pharaoh's
[28:39] courts and he looked out the window
[28:41] pharaoh looked out the window
[28:43] when pharaoh looked out the window at
[28:44] god's people he saw a bunch of mud
[28:46] daubers
[28:49] that's nothing but a bunch of
[28:50] half-dressed people with lashes of whips
[28:52] upon their back no way at all for to be
[28:55] ever ever to be delivered that's when
[28:58] you're looking at the flesh
[29:01] this is god's people
[29:03] and they look like that a bunch of
[29:05] slaves in bondage
[29:07] this is when when pharaoh looked out his
[29:09] window he's seen he's seen a bunch of
[29:11] mud dabbers or slay that's all he seen
[29:14] now we found out moses we found out
[29:16] later he built he saw israel going on to
[29:18] the next quote if you would but moses
[29:20] knew the word of god and he looked upon
[29:22] them he looked out the same window
[29:24] brother brandon says he looked out the
[29:25] same window and he looked upon them as a
[29:28] promised people he looked upon them as a
[29:30] people that had a promise no matter how
[29:33] much the world that day looked down upon
[29:35] them as a bunch of mud daubers or slaves
[29:38] he looked upon them as a people having a
[29:41] promise pharaoh looked upon them out of
[29:43] the same window but he's seen slaves
[29:47] moses seen the victory why he had
[29:49] focused himself though being a prince
[29:52] though heir to the throne of egypt he
[29:54] focused himself away from the lust of
[29:56] the world he focused himself away from
[29:58] the beauty and the power that he had
[30:00] within his own potentials to receive he
[30:02] focused that out until he seen a blessed
[30:06] people yonder by the promise of god he
[30:09] focused in because he know that god
[30:12] promised abraham that he would visit his
[30:14] people
[30:16] if you'd have been looking at the flesh
[30:17] like pharaoh was these people were
[30:20] nothing these people had no potential
[30:22] but when you're looking through god's
[30:24] eyes you look past the flesh and see
[30:26] them as a people of promise
[30:29] they weren't even delivered yet but the
[30:32] way moses god's prophet looked at the
[30:33] people he seen them by grace and said
[30:36] they
[30:37] no matter how much enslaver they are no
[30:39] matter how much downtrodden they are no
[30:41] much no no matter how much in the flesh
[30:44] they are they're holding a promise
[30:48] i'm glad god looked at me that way one
[30:49] day
[30:51] whatever he's seen in flesh he had to
[30:53] look past it and say but that boy is a
[30:55] he's holding a promise
[30:58] literal life
[31:00] no matter how much you view them a
[31:01] certain way
[31:03] there are people of promise and through
[31:04] the throughout the bible
[31:07] balaam tried to curse israel
[31:11] because balak and balaam were looking at
[31:13] their hinder parts
[31:15] i'm recording the
[31:16] bible were viewing this group of people
[31:19] these are just a bunch of people that's
[31:21] messed up
[31:22] and i don't like
[31:24] and going on and on and when god and the
[31:26] prophet looked at them balaam try balak
[31:28] tried to say i'm looking at their hindu
[31:30] parts and they've got some problems
[31:31] they've got some weaknesses they've got
[31:33] some things going on internally in the
[31:34] camp that isn't right
[31:37] they judged them for their hinder parts
[31:40] and then because balak seemed that they
[31:42] tried to get the prophet hired a prophet
[31:44] to curse them curse this people
[31:46] cursed them and he couldn't curse them
[31:49] you can't curse what god has blessed
[31:51] despite their weaknesses despite what
[31:53] they look like despite their hinder
[31:55] parts they were the people of god
[31:58] oh i ought to get a bigger amen than
[32:00] that despite their weaknesses despite
[32:02] what flesh you see despite all the
[32:04] things they're still the people of
[32:06] almighty god and there are people
[32:08] holding a promise i'm preaching to a
[32:10] people today that's holding a promise of
[32:13] a rapture and you may say i never see
[32:15] them going in the rapture all i see is
[32:17] flesh well because you're looking at the
[32:19] flesh and not the promise i'm preaching
[32:22] to a people that hold a promise of a
[32:24] rapture i'm preaching to a people that
[32:26] hold the promise of adoption and sons of
[32:28] god are going to come to adoption
[32:30] despite what the devil says
[32:33] blessed be the name of the lord
[32:36] i love that i love it pharaoh looks out
[32:38] the window and sees mud daubers
[32:40] maybe you look out your window
[32:43] and you look at this church and view it
[32:45] a certain way
[32:46] but i can tell you god views it in a
[32:48] different way
[32:51] praise the lord
[32:53] quiet today
[32:55] but when you're talking about
[32:56] relationships and you get down to the
[32:58] nitty-gritty sometimes
[32:59] you're not going to have a shouting
[33:02] dancing service
[33:04] we have those we have them sometimes
[33:07] but you see i don't think that we should
[33:08] always want to have a shouting dancing
[33:10] service and say we haven't had church
[33:13] till we have that i don't believe that
[33:15] god speaks in different ways
[33:17] sometimes you just need to be taught a
[33:19] little bit
[33:20] sometimes you just need to sit at jesus
[33:22] feet and just learn of him
[33:25] bible says learn of me jesus said learn
[33:27] of me for i am meek and lowly
[33:31] praise the lord i need that respectfully
[33:33] i want it all
[33:35] i want the blessings
[33:37] i want to shout
[33:38] i want to dance i'm not afraid of the
[33:40] gifts of the spirit
[33:41] we had a healing line because god
[33:43] directed it three weeks ago and friends
[33:45] i don't have the time we'll do it at
[33:47] communion next month but we're going to
[33:48] go through the the the so many people
[33:52] that were miraculously healed through
[33:54] that healing line that we called we
[33:56] believe in the power of god around here
[33:58] we believe in this change he still heals
[34:00] physically can you say amen but i'm here
[34:02] as a pastor to tell you we we may not
[34:05] have that every service but other
[34:07] healing will take place healing of the
[34:09] spirit healing of the motions
[34:11] mental healing can you say man people
[34:14] that don't have a sound mind
[34:16] god can come down and give them a sound
[34:17] mind again that they're thinking
[34:19] properly
[34:20] don't limit god to just certain things
[34:23] can you say amen let god be god
[34:26] let him do what he wants to do
[34:28] we might not always have an altar call
[34:31] but may the same jehovah god come on the
[34:33] scene and do his work
[34:36] praise the lord god
[34:38] looked at the people different than what
[34:40] pharaoh saw them moses looked at the
[34:41] people he didn't look at the flesh can i
[34:44] correct something right here
[34:48] i'm going to go ahead and do it anyway
[34:51] you better be careful
[34:53] what you say
[34:55] about god's people
[35:02] yep
[35:03] i'm gonna go ahead
[35:05] you better watch your tongue
[35:08] at home and on the phone and be careful
[35:11] what you say about god's people and that
[35:14] correction is for me for you or for
[35:16] anybody
[35:22] lately i've
[35:23] i've heard this for years but
[35:26] they i heard it recently
[35:29] someone on the phone with me
[35:31] it's the message people that i have
[35:33] issues with
[35:36] not the unbelievers i can get along with
[35:38] them
[35:39] and i'm going
[35:41] wow
[35:46] not the unbelievers
[35:48] i'm just thinking you're lumping a whole
[35:51] lot of folks
[35:53] in
[35:54] with the three people that hurt you in
[35:56] the message
[35:59] and i think that's a very dangerous
[36:00] thing to do
[36:02] i know for me i don't like to be lumped
[36:04] in
[36:05] and categorized or put in a category
[36:08] because i might preach a certain way i
[36:10] hate to be lumped in with a certain
[36:12] category
[36:14] preachers preach against things and say
[36:15] no if i say something and lean a certain
[36:17] way then they quickly put me in a care i
[36:19] don't like that you don't like that
[36:22] and i think we should be careful when
[36:24] three or four people have hurt you that
[36:25] you don't judge the whole congregation
[36:27] by it and the whole message by it you're
[36:30] lumping a whole lot of good holy
[36:32] ghost-filled people
[36:34] in with your hurt
[36:38] the
[36:38] pharisees who judged you and that's a
[36:41] lot of times what it is because we have
[36:43] pharisees in the message
[36:48] i'm getting in trouble right now
[36:51] you don't think we have pharisees in the
[36:52] message who are all about religion and
[36:55] made this message of religion we have
[36:58] pharisees i've dealt with them for 30
[37:00] 40 years we have pharisees in the
[37:03] message
[37:04] we have sarah's sadducees
[37:09] the pharisees are fair
[37:11] you see
[37:14] and the sadducees are sad you see
[37:18] trying to simplify it for the kids
[37:21] but we have them
[37:23] and they're more about religion they're
[37:24] more about the dress code than they are
[37:27] about the power of god
[37:30] there are more about appearance in my
[37:32] mentioning is this what jesus said about
[37:34] the pharisees they're more about
[37:35] appearance than they are the power of
[37:37] god
[37:38] they're more about putting on
[37:39] righteousness on the outside than the
[37:40] righteousness of god
[37:42] we have them in the message
[37:44] and they have made the message a code
[37:46] they made the message something other
[37:47] than the righteous of god righteousness
[37:49] of god all i want to say about it we've
[37:50] had that for years all i want to say and
[37:52] you can get offended all you want to but
[37:54] i'm going to tell the truth and that is
[37:56] it is not fair to take the pharisees in
[37:58] this message who maybe have hurt you and
[38:01] criticize you and judge the whole
[38:03] message by it and everybody in the whole
[38:05] message by it and the message itself
[38:08] because we do have people now who have
[38:10] exited the message based upon those
[38:12] things and i think that's a real serious
[38:14] thing to blanket the whole thing and all
[38:17] of god's restored truth and everything
[38:19] god has done through this prophet and is
[38:21] doing now through this ministry of the
[38:23] last days i think it's a it's immature
[38:26] it's juvenile to lump the whole message
[38:29] and the whole crowd into a few pharisees
[38:35] there's pharisees in every group but
[38:37] it's not the whole group can you say
[38:38] amen
[38:39] somebody didn't teach you that people
[38:41] can be fleshly
[38:43] in any church
[38:45] whether it's denomination or here
[38:48] people can live in the flesh and be very
[38:49] fleshly and very carnal even paul said
[38:52] that the corinthians ye
[38:54] are carnal
[38:57] and they were a message church
[39:02] yeah
[39:03] the corinthians were a message church
[39:04] but they were just immature and he says
[39:06] you're carnal you're his big he never
[39:08] talked to the ephesians that way but
[39:10] this church is a book of correction i've
[39:12] got to correct you on this i got a
[39:13] question and one of the things is you're
[39:14] babies you're acting as babes you're
[39:16] choosing favorite preachers you're
[39:18] choosing the elite preachers the supreme
[39:20] preachers the supreme ministries in this
[39:21] message and i'm a paul i'm of ces i'm
[39:24] i'm cephas i'm as this i'm that and so
[39:27] all this immaturity going on and he said
[39:30] you're just being carnal you're being
[39:32] fleshly and i'm gonna stay preaching to
[39:34] you and to grow out of your immaturity
[39:37] and grow as sons and quit judging the
[39:39] people of god by the flesh can i get an
[39:42] amen this morning
[39:44] quit judging the people of god by the
[39:46] flesh but somebody didn't teach you that
[39:49] people can be fleshly in any church
[39:52] that's why people some of them when they
[39:53] leave and they experience about five ten
[39:55] years of going out to other other
[39:58] churches besides the message they begin
[40:00] to discover people can be fleshly out
[40:03] there too
[40:05] they've got pharisees too
[40:08] they've got
[40:10] imbalanced people too
[40:15] and then they go to walmart and they get
[40:17] into it with somebody and they realize
[40:18] wow there's people who walk in the flesh
[40:21] even at walmart
[40:24] and you just you just exited the message
[40:27] and it's the message people are all
[40:28] these other things and then you walk in
[40:30] and you realize people are people
[40:32] everywhere
[40:33] when they get in the flesh
[40:35] but we're not judging by the flesh we're
[40:37] looking for the pillar of fire we're
[40:39] looking for the joy in the camp we're
[40:40] looking for the is the holy spirit
[40:42] moving
[40:44] and i say if the holy spirit is doing
[40:47] his work in his people we should be
[40:49] careful what we say about the people of
[40:52] the lord balaam got in a lot of trouble
[40:56] by trying to curse israel
[41:03] a person that just complains and says
[41:05] it's these message people i can't take
[41:06] care of i just can't handle
[41:12] and i'm just gonna say
[41:14] respectfully
[41:20] many times a person like that is is
[41:22] looking for a reason to leave
[41:27] they're looking for a reason to exit the
[41:29] message
[41:32] and they're looking for excuses and
[41:34] they're looking for something so fleshly
[41:36] that they can
[41:37] feel good about exiting i've got
[41:39] something now
[41:41] but you'll never take that to the
[41:43] judgment day
[41:44] it'll never be a good enough excuse
[41:47] because you set aside the people you set
[41:49] aside the flesh
[41:51] and you'll have the word
[41:53] through the messenger that you will face
[41:55] because god will judge this world
[41:58] by one standard and that's his word
[42:03] not by denominations not by the sign on
[42:05] the door whether it's a message sign or
[42:07] whether it's a baptist sign god will not
[42:09] judge it by any church even message
[42:11] church he'll judge it by the word
[42:15] not by denomination
[42:20] it's not the whole group
[42:22] you can have it fleshly people at
[42:24] walmart you can
[42:25] be with fleshly people as you click on
[42:27] facebook
[42:29] i just feel that if a person is
[42:30] isolating just message people and not as
[42:32] critical about everybody else they're
[42:34] looking for an excuse to go they got to
[42:36] have a reason to exit
[42:38] why be miserable
[42:42] if you're not happy why be miserable
[42:49] people already decided in their hearts
[42:50] years ago to exit and just looking for a
[42:52] reason to go
[42:54] i had a man one time
[42:56] years ago probably 30 years ago and he
[42:59] started to bring his wife to church he
[43:01] was a believer he believed that the
[43:03] message of christ for the last days
[43:05] but his wife didn't and they were
[43:07] they're already married she had grown up
[43:09] pentecostal girl
[43:10] and so he wanting to come to the church
[43:13] that was preaching the message of the
[43:14] last days he brought her to our church
[43:17] and kept bringing her and i began to
[43:18] notice she didn't want to be there
[43:21] and he was dragging her to come you know
[43:22] this was the truth of the last day she
[43:24] was coming but she didn't want to be
[43:26] there she hated it she hated to hear the
[43:28] name william branham she hated every
[43:30] time i said it she got resentful
[43:33] you could tell it by her body language
[43:37] and after a few months i went to him and
[43:39] i said brother i said why are you doing
[43:41] this to her
[43:44] not everybody is called to the same
[43:46] thing
[43:48] why why are you forcing this on her i
[43:50] said well it's the truth it's the truth
[43:52] of the last days but you have to respect
[43:54] her
[43:55] and where she's at i said she grew up
[43:57] and he called so
[43:58] here's what you need to do you need to
[44:00] go take her to a place and you could
[44:03] come here sunday morning take her to a
[44:05] church that she grew up in maybe some
[44:07] type of church a pentecostal church take
[44:09] her sunday night
[44:10] and you guys could go there and then go
[44:12] that's what i suggested it might be
[44:14] uncouth it may be different than what
[44:15] you suggested but i just said why do you
[44:18] want to make a person miserable why do
[44:19] you want to sit in the church and make a
[44:20] person miserable
[44:23] don't you understand that that as i was
[44:25] saying last sunday god has a change in
[44:29] his
[44:30] pocket some are quarters some are civil
[44:32] dollars some are pennies but they're all
[44:34] of value
[44:36] they're all in god's hands
[44:38] some people just aren't called and so
[44:40] why do they continue being miserable and
[44:42] you see and so i said take her and you
[44:44] know he did it and she was happy as a
[44:46] little lark
[44:48] matter of fact when she'd come to our
[44:49] services she was happier because she had
[44:51] something that was ministering to her
[44:55] how could that be ministering to her
[44:57] it's not up to me to decide
[44:59] what god's going to use to minister
[45:01] somebody
[45:03] brother paul used somebody to send
[45:04] somebody back to the nominees i wasn't
[45:06] sending her to a denomination i was
[45:08] teaching a husband to be respectful that
[45:10] you don't force this on anybody why do
[45:12] you want to sit there and be miserable
[45:14] and have her miserable
[45:15] she was happy as a little lark and she
[45:18] didn't have to hear the name william
[45:19] branham or a preacher preaching on her
[45:21] dress or whatever was happening she
[45:23] didn't have to hear that she was she was
[45:25] just in a place and she could grow in
[45:27] the lord at her level there
[45:32] praise the lord i get myself in trouble
[45:34] every sunday now
[45:38] why aren't you happy
[45:42] are you going to support a church and
[45:43] support the holy spirit moving in that
[45:45] church then you ought to be happy going
[45:46] to that church
[45:48] you're going to give us your tithes and
[45:49] your offerings you ought to be
[45:50] supportive not only in your tithes and
[45:52] offerings but you support it and you're
[45:54] happy and you're growing in the lord if
[45:56] you're not growing in the lord please
[45:57] find the place that you'll grow in the
[45:59] lord it's all about all of us growing in
[46:01] the lord
[46:02] and one thing don't judge god's people
[46:04] according to the flesh judge it by his
[46:07] righteousness and what he's doing in the
[46:08] work of the lord to transform lives
[46:16] i haven't given that advice to 10 people
[46:18] that i gave to that man so just know
[46:20] that i'm not you know
[46:22] i just felt it was a unique situation
[46:24] that why why does she have to sit and be
[46:26] miserable
[46:29] somebody bring their drag their husbands
[46:31] along get them injured
[46:33] why he doesn't like being in church
[46:36] he doesn't like me or he doesn't like
[46:37] something why
[46:39] oh he needs to get to he yeah i know he
[46:42] needs a lot
[46:44] but he needs the lord because obviously
[46:46] he don't have a value yet when he gets a
[46:49] value and christ comes deeper in his
[46:51] life he'll get a value to come to church
[46:54] it comes with the territory how many who
[46:56] love to come to church would raise your
[46:58] hand and say i don't do this just so
[47:01] brother paul don't preach on me i am
[47:03] here because i love the lord
[47:05] i'm here today because i love
[47:08] being here this is me now i'm not
[47:10] speaking for you i love being here
[47:13] more than anywhere else and i don't have
[47:14] to be preaching i just want to see the
[47:16] glory of god i just want to raise my
[47:18] hands and sing i just want to start the
[47:19] week right i'm here because i love being
[47:22] here
[47:23] i really mean that this is my life this
[47:25] is my obsession there isn't any business
[47:28] opportunity that gives me a thrill like
[47:31] it does being in the house of god
[47:33] somebody being healed somebody being
[47:35] changed somebody crying and weeping in
[47:37] the presence of god
[47:39] that's what i love to see
[47:43] you know we're making a few business
[47:45] decisions doing other things and you
[47:47] know this that and the other and it's
[47:48] just like okay all right all right yes i
[47:50] see the opportunity we're doing it
[47:52] that's fine but you know what it's all a
[47:54] sideshow it's all gonna burn someday
[47:58] no no this is my passion the word the
[48:01] presence of god and i can say that
[48:04] sometimes coming to church with you
[48:06] people
[48:08] who are in the flesh some of you
[48:11] i can still love coming to church
[48:14] because if i'm preaching i'm going to
[48:15] preach you out of the flesh if i can
[48:18] but some of you come sometimes and some
[48:21] times i come disgruntled wednesday night
[48:23] i was as tired
[48:25] as a i was dog-tired
[48:28] only took me about 10 minutes and i just
[48:30] revived and said
[48:32] this feels good brother daniel's
[48:34] preaching
[48:35] my tiredness is smothered out
[48:41] amen
[48:44] i think it should be a passion and if
[48:46] it's not a passion find something that
[48:49] you're growing by
[48:51] that the lord is a passion to you
[48:53] i think that we should
[48:55] enjoy
[48:56] the church that we attend
[49:00] can you say mom i think we should enjoy
[49:02] it
[49:06] see paul you preach that way some people
[49:08] might leave listen
[49:10] i want you to be happy i want you to
[49:13] support the ministry that you're under
[49:15] and a confidence not in my flesh nothing
[49:18] good in my flesh confidence in the gift
[49:19] that's feeding you and the brothers
[49:21] you're feeling the ministry i'd be here
[49:22] i want you to have confidence in that
[49:24] and if you don't
[49:26] say brother paul you're you're making
[49:28] your church you might be making your
[49:29] church smaller
[49:30] i'm not about numbers
[49:34] if you don't know that i'm not about
[49:36] numbers
[49:38] sometimes it can go up and down that's
[49:40] that's fine
[49:42] i want to i want to love the lord
[49:45] i want to see people changed
[49:47] but i certainly want to see people
[49:49] who
[49:51] are happy
[49:52] and excited and passionate
[49:56] about
[49:57] gathering together
[50:00] is that okay
[50:02] now there's something i read last sunday
[50:05] and um
[50:09] there's no way that we can have oneness
[50:12] true oneness if we view each other
[50:15] according to the flesh
[50:18] we'll never come to it
[50:21] and i said something last sunday that
[50:22] we're all so used to looking at people
[50:25] by the flesh
[50:26] we've had six thousand years of only
[50:29] seeing the flesh and we're actually
[50:30] taught
[50:31] to view and
[50:33] judge a person by
[50:35] what we see
[50:38] we actually bestow honor
[50:40] in the wrong places and we lift up the
[50:43] rich ones we lift up the highly gifted
[50:45] ones the highly gifted people get more
[50:47] praise become our become
[50:51] celebrities
[50:52] it's just how we're taught you know
[50:54] there's there's people that get more
[50:55] honor and the people that don't have the
[50:57] greatest gifts and they don't have
[51:00] a lot of money or they don't they're not
[51:02] successful in in what the world sees we
[51:04] tend to okay they're okay but these are
[51:07] the real people that get more of our
[51:08] honor that's a shame because paul taught
[51:10] us in the body of christ
[51:12] in
[51:13] in your bible he taught in the body of
[51:15] christ he said the ones that seem
[51:18] least likely
[51:20] the lesser ones the parts of the body
[51:22] that are not seen
[51:24] and don't have that great of a function
[51:26] he said but they're essential to the
[51:28] body
[51:29] that's how the body of christ function
[51:30] but the world has taught us we lift up
[51:32] the wrong ones we
[51:35] certain ones superstars movie stars and
[51:38] and then we put down others
[51:41] and this run writer a christian writer
[51:43] colin smith he was
[51:45] talking about this scripture second
[51:46] corinthians 5 what does it mean to
[51:48] regard someone according to the flesh
[51:50] from here from from now on regard no one
[51:53] according to the flesh
[51:55] and uh
[51:57] it's he says
[51:58] he quotes from
[52:00] first samuel man looks at the outward
[52:02] appearance but god looks at the heart
[52:06] it is natural for us to form impressions
[52:08] from the most obvious things about other
[52:10] people
[52:11] and so then he he mentioned some things
[52:13] here that i'm just going to use the 10
[52:14] things this is how we judge according to
[52:16] flesh number one we judge by appearance
[52:19] how many would say that's true
[52:21] we we have been taught to judge people
[52:23] by their appearance and that can go from
[52:25] uh
[52:26] you know uh just are they ugly are they
[52:29] good looking
[52:31] um are they wearing the right clothes
[52:33] are they not wearing the right clothes
[52:36] it can be i don't want to spend a lot of
[52:37] time with this because you know we but
[52:38] we judge
[52:40] we categorize we put someone in a place
[52:42] based upon their appearance and that's
[52:45] judging according to the flesh
[52:48] and we do that as human beings and and
[52:50] sometimes we do it and you know are they
[52:53] are there a certain height
[52:54] are they a certain weight we've judged
[52:56] for years people that are
[52:58] that are
[53:01] how should i say it
[53:05] overweight
[53:07] or
[53:08] rotund
[53:12] huh obese
[53:15] is it i'm recalling brother dana
[53:18] when you were young and my dad was
[53:20] preaching and he was looking
[53:22] for the word a polite word to say a
[53:23] person was overweight and he was looking
[53:26] for obese and you yelled out rotund
[53:30] you remember that
[53:31] my dad always told that story and my dad
[53:34] said no i don't think that's the word
[53:35] i'm looking for
[53:37] rotund
[53:44] but uh
[53:47] we judge the weight you know and and i'm
[53:49] always working on that you know and and
[53:51] i found those uh
[53:53] i found those um oreo
[53:56] cookies but they're thins
[54:00] are you shaking your head for bread
[54:03] just kidding
[54:06] so it's about appearance
[54:08] number two
[54:10] we judge according to ability
[54:12] gifts talents abilities that each of us
[54:15] has we're gifted in different ways
[54:18] uh in sports in arts in music and so we
[54:21] live in a world that's just how good are
[54:23] they in this how much have they excelled
[54:25] in this and i think all of us should
[54:27] excel
[54:28] in our different things that god has
[54:30] given us and gifts but i think we should
[54:31] do it to the glory of god
[54:34] our musicians are always probing to get
[54:35] better and better but it's not to show
[54:37] off it's the bible says to play
[54:39] skillfully upon the instruments so take
[54:41] your gift and make something more there
[54:43] was a young boy that
[54:44] drew some art and for brother for
[54:46] brother branham and he says i'd love to
[54:48] have the money to send that boy to
[54:49] college to further his gift so he's
[54:51] always encouraging you got a gift but
[54:53] make it better for the glory of god
[54:57] but but we can't judge a person's soul
[55:00] or who they are
[55:02] by their gift
[55:04] that's all flesh
[55:06] so whether they were highly gifted or
[55:08] they didn't they didn't they didn't have
[55:10] a great gift and
[55:12] no we don't judge them by that
[55:14] we we're looking through the eyes of
[55:16] christ we judge people according to age
[55:20] paul says to timothy let no man despise
[55:22] your youth so we look down on the ones
[55:24] that are younger sometimes and all that
[55:26] and then we look at down on the older
[55:27] the our generation actually looks down
[55:30] on the gray-haired older people and
[55:32] won't take wisdom from them i think
[55:34] that's a shame i think the bible teaches
[55:36] otherwise
[55:37] that the young people should be hanging
[55:39] around the older people to get some of
[55:40] their wisdom
[55:41] i think young mothers should ask the
[55:43] mothers who raised your children how can
[55:45] you help me i've got this child that's
[55:47] doing this have you been through this
[55:49] and you'll find mothers in the church
[55:50] yeah i've been through that been there
[55:51] done that got the t-shirt
[55:55] but the young mothers are too proud to
[55:56] ask the older ones and i think that's
[55:57] sad there's a lot of wisdom there
[56:00] but we live in a young generation that
[56:01] we don't need the older ones we just
[56:03] we're going to do our own thing i think
[56:04] that's not scriptural but we judge
[56:06] people according to their age where
[56:07] they're at you know they're they're less
[56:09] if they're older and they have that gray
[56:11] hair the bible speaks different we judge
[56:14] people based upon the friends that they
[56:16] keep the associates that they keep
[56:19] we judge people based upon race how many
[56:21] know we judge people according to their
[56:22] rates we we have had
[56:26] distinctions in that and divisions that
[56:28] have come
[56:29] it was in the bible between jews and
[56:31] gentiles they're judging according to
[56:32] race and different things we judge
[56:34] people according to gender
[56:37] god has made us male and female
[56:39] and he distinguishes the difference in
[56:41] male and female but we tend to judge
[56:43] things and and i got into some things
[56:46] about how sometimes we're lacking
[56:48] in our groups in looking down and
[56:51] belittling the woman as some lesser
[56:54] creature
[56:56] and i got some response from it because
[56:58] it's not talked about a lot
[57:00] i know she's the weaker vessel but paul
[57:03] said to the husbands
[57:04] to honor her as the weaker vessel
[57:07] and she's the weaker vessel and vessel
[57:09] but she's co-heirs together with you in
[57:11] christ
[57:12] he said you better he said paul said you
[57:15] better treat her right as a daughter of
[57:16] god
[57:17] and don't disrespect her because she's a
[57:19] weaker vessel you better honor her
[57:23] or your prayers will be hindered
[57:26] so once again you're not looking at the
[57:28] flesh she's a weaker vessel she's a
[57:30] nobody i don't even want her input
[57:32] that's not that's not i don't care if
[57:34] that comes from a message thing whatever
[57:36] that is not the word of god
[57:39] she's not a doormat
[57:43] we judge people according to their work
[57:45] what's their work what's education
[57:46] what's their business what's their
[57:47] health we look down on them if they
[57:48] don't have an education what's that what
[57:50] are they doing their work are they
[57:52] successful in their work we judge people
[57:53] according to their home the the people
[57:55] the car that they drive the vacations
[57:57] that they go to the restaurants they
[57:59] frequent we judge people according to
[58:00] that the communities they're a part of
[58:02] we judge people according to their
[58:03] family and
[58:05] of origin where they come from did they
[58:06] have a popular family do they have a
[58:08] family that's not popular
[58:11] and all these things and then he says we
[58:12] judge people by experience
[58:16] our experiences shaped us not only by
[58:18] genes but also the environment and so we
[58:20] come as a product of our environment
[58:22] that we grew up in whether it was in the
[58:24] message or not we come as a product of
[58:25] our environment and we come as a product
[58:27] of the genes that are in us from our
[58:28] former history brother bram talked about
[58:30] it the only thing that crests the bad
[58:32] part of our history you might have a
[58:35] line of alcoholics you might have a line
[58:37] of someone that's given to depression
[58:39] only thing that corrects it is the
[58:41] lord's power from calvary can you say
[58:42] amen
[58:45] how many can raise your hand and say
[58:46] that god has broken the cycle of a
[58:49] family history through the power of the
[58:51] cross
[58:52] you're sitting here today he broke the
[58:54] cycle
[58:55] amen sometimes it takes years but god
[58:57] says i have power i can break that cycle
[58:59] and your future is going to be much
[59:01] better than your past
[59:03] amen but we judge people according to
[59:05] their families
[59:08] and are they this and are they that and
[59:10] we judge all these things and i could
[59:12] reflect on this but he goes into another
[59:14] part he says christ changes how you see
[59:18] others
[59:19] and i agree with them
[59:21] it's christ that changes how you view
[59:24] others
[59:25] and we don't view according to the flesh
[59:27] but something much much deeper and then
[59:30] the real revelation comes as we see how
[59:33] christ sees us
[59:35] because when we see how christ sees us
[59:38] then we can look at others if you judge
[59:40] yourself according to the flesh either
[59:43] you will always be looking down on
[59:45] others because you see yourself as
[59:47] having more going for you than they do
[59:50] or you will always be losing heart
[59:52] because others have more gifts and more
[59:54] talents and more advantages and more
[59:57] opportunities than you
[59:59] i'm going to read that again
[1:00:01] if you judge yourself according to the
[1:00:03] flesh or others either you will always
[1:00:05] be looking down on others because you
[1:00:07] see yourself as having more going for
[1:00:09] you it's pride
[1:00:12] or if you're living the flesh you will
[1:00:14] always be losing heart because others
[1:00:16] have more gifts and more talents and
[1:00:19] more advantages and more opportunities
[1:00:21] than you
[1:00:22] here's the good news christ does not
[1:00:24] regard you according to the flesh
[1:00:32] and he ends it by saying and i am in
[1:00:34] harmony with what he says here
[1:00:37] when jesus christ is your sovereign lord
[1:00:39] what he thinks of you is first and
[1:00:42] ultimately the only thing
[1:00:44] that really matters
[1:00:47] i believe that
[1:00:48] when jesus becomes lord what he thinks
[1:00:52] of you is first i talk to some young
[1:00:54] girls
[1:00:55] lately about confidence in god and
[1:00:57] confidence in themselves as a daughter
[1:00:59] of god
[1:01:00] rough situations where they have been
[1:01:02] belittled by parents and then they've
[1:01:04] been with men and different things and
[1:01:07] it all starts because they didn't get
[1:01:08] the honor as a young girl
[1:01:10] and they view themselves so belittled
[1:01:12] and i said you may never have a daddy
[1:01:14] come to you and give you that
[1:01:16] affirmation but i can tell you you have
[1:01:18] a big a big father
[1:01:20] and you stay in this word he's going to
[1:01:22] give you the confidence that you have
[1:01:24] lacked and that you are fearfully and
[1:01:26] wonderfully made in the image of god
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:36] what he thinks of you god is ultimate
[1:01:38] ultimately because you may never get
[1:01:40] enough likes on the internet
[1:01:44] those of you who are striving to get
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:47] crossover point of having 100 likes you
[1:01:49] may never get it you might get more
[1:01:52] dislikes i know if i had a facebook i
[1:01:55] would have so many dislikes
[1:01:58] i would be blocked constantly
[1:02:02] and i would start out with 300 000
[1:02:04] followers and then it would just keep
[1:02:05] whittling down to nothing and i would
[1:02:08] have to have my confidence in the lord
[1:02:10] or i would crash and be there on the
[1:02:12] couch with a whole gallon of ice cream
[1:02:16] i would
[1:02:18] good thing my confidence is in the lord
[1:02:21] and that's what he's saying here
[1:02:23] he's saying that when he's yourself lord
[1:02:25] what he thinks of you is first can you
[1:02:26] say amen
[1:02:27] and the only thing that really matters a
[1:02:30] change in how you see jesus will lead to
[1:02:33] a change in how you see others
[1:02:36] and a change in how you see yourself
[1:02:39] so that you will not lose heart
[1:02:45] the book of redemption has been opened
[1:02:48] to the bride of jesus christ
[1:02:51] brother brahm said he is the book and
[1:02:53] she is the words in the book
[1:02:56] hallelujah
[1:02:58] and when we see inside that and begin to
[1:03:00] look at it we are no longer looking at
[1:03:03] the flesh at all
[1:03:05] we're seeing christ the mystery of god
[1:03:08] revealed and its influence from that
[1:03:10] book of life that's open should be
[1:03:12] re-teaching us how we view people and
[1:03:16] it'll be more powerful than anything
[1:03:18] that we've ever learned in our life to
[1:03:20] view people according to the flesh when
[1:03:22] you get your eyes in that book of life
[1:03:24] in this word
[1:03:26] there's a powerful
[1:03:28] vision that comes that you'll never see
[1:03:30] yourself
[1:03:32] never see others
[1:03:33] like you've seen them before
[1:03:36] you'll get honor you'll get respect
[1:03:38] you'll be looking for the seed in
[1:03:40] somebody you'll be looking for the
[1:03:42] christ in somebody you look beyond the
[1:03:44] flesh can you say man
[1:03:46] you view your husband different you view
[1:03:48] your wife different
[1:03:49] i got this guy going to straighten him
[1:03:51] out all the time and man
[1:03:52] he's just you better just be careful and
[1:03:55] start looking for that part of christ
[1:03:58] that honor the more honor you give for
[1:04:00] that man you say well i don't even have
[1:04:02] a i have an unsaved husband i i have a i
[1:04:05] have a tyrant or i have whatever
[1:04:08] you disrespect and you honor
[1:04:11] and watch god begin to do the work might
[1:04:14] take years but you just you got to
[1:04:15] maintain that level of respect and
[1:04:17] certainly don't become like him
[1:04:20] don't become like him that's where you
[1:04:22] draw the line
[1:04:24] don't become like her if she's a tyrant
[1:04:26] if she's got a temper problem
[1:04:29] and it's from something she hasn't
[1:04:31] brought to the lord
[1:04:32] don't judge her according to the flesh
[1:04:34] be loving be kind draw her out of it
[1:04:36] pray for her but don't ever disrespect
[1:04:39] her
[1:04:40] keep an honor and respect
[1:04:42] and don't become like her
[1:04:44] because if you have two tempers going
[1:04:46] it's going to be bad
[1:04:51] now i don't have time to go to jesus
[1:04:53] example
[1:04:54] i'll go there next sunday if i'm
[1:04:56] preaching next sunday i think i am
[1:05:01] jesus says two places though i'm just
[1:05:02] mentioning it and we'll close
[1:05:04] i'm doing good it's only 20 to
[1:05:06] 1. jesus said
[1:05:10] and both times he's speaking to the
[1:05:11] pharisees okay
[1:05:13] religious people
[1:05:14] he says ye judge according to appearance
[1:05:18] but god judges according to the heart
[1:05:21] so he's talking about judging people and
[1:05:22] he was saying don't judge by the flesh
[1:05:24] don't and then another place is it he
[1:05:26] said to the phrase you judge by the
[1:05:28] flesh but he says i don't judge men
[1:05:31] jesus actually said he says i don't
[1:05:33] judge men by the way that you judge them
[1:05:36] and that incident he said that was just
[1:05:38] a few scriptures after the woman was
[1:05:41] taken in adultery and brought by the
[1:05:43] pharisees straight up and says we found
[1:05:45] her in the very act and she's a mess and
[1:05:48] the law says the law says we stone her
[1:05:52] putting the test to jesus
[1:05:54] and i've preached this the only
[1:05:56] difference
[1:05:57] is that jesus is viewing the bigger
[1:05:59] picture of who this woman really is
[1:06:03] and if you were to judge her they had
[1:06:04] every right even by the law of the word
[1:06:06] what to do with this woman but even with
[1:06:09] the law they were judging everything by
[1:06:12] flesh and what they seen
[1:06:14] and you can't do that jesus said you're
[1:06:16] judging by just the flesh he said i
[1:06:19] don't judge any man
[1:06:21] we must get a revelation
[1:06:23] of who this person is
[1:06:26] and because it was jesus
[1:06:28] he knew who she was
[1:06:30] you know what he did he went there and
[1:06:32] began to write in the ground and
[1:06:33] whatever he wrote in the ground all of a
[1:06:34] sudden they become convicted
[1:06:37] and all of a sudden they're judging you
[1:06:39] people you ones that judge too much to
[1:06:41] the flesh and just write everybody off
[1:06:43] and
[1:06:45] just remember
[1:06:47] god has a way of correcting you
[1:06:50] when you're so critical of other people
[1:06:52] i find with critical people
[1:06:54] sometimes the very thing that they're so
[1:06:56] critical of other people they're doing
[1:06:57] themselves
[1:07:00] and they're requiring all this of
[1:07:02] somebody else and yet they're doing it
[1:07:04] themselves
[1:07:05] if you judge according to the flesh then
[1:07:08] god's going to find something in your
[1:07:09] life that's humbling to say
[1:07:11] i need to humble myself because i've
[1:07:13] been guilty of this
[1:07:15] you see
[1:07:17] so he wrote down things in the ground
[1:07:19] and they must have been convicted and
[1:07:21] they all backed off and began to drop
[1:07:22] their stones
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:25] and begin to exit and begin to walk away
[1:07:27] because they were
[1:07:28] convicted and the bible says he's she's
[1:07:30] left alone with jesus
[1:07:33] she's left alone with jesus it's just
[1:07:35] the two of them and he said where are
[1:07:37] your accusers and she says i don't have
[1:07:39] any more he said then i don't accuse you
[1:07:42] go and sin no more
[1:07:44] now wait a minute he had the law there
[1:07:46] but you see
[1:07:47] the law viewed only through flesh
[1:07:51] will get you in trouble
[1:07:53] god never meant for the law and the
[1:07:56] things god gave us in the law and the
[1:07:58] principles to live by and the dress and
[1:08:00] all of that he never
[1:08:03] wanted pharisees to make it into
[1:08:05] something that that's how we judge
[1:08:07] people
[1:08:08] and if we can get them just dressed
[1:08:10] right
[1:08:11] we'll feel better jesus said you're all
[1:08:13] about appearance
[1:08:15] and not about the heart
[1:08:17] if we could just get them down the other
[1:08:19] situation is where
[1:08:22] he said jesus said you you hate me and
[1:08:25] you want to kill me and they said oh
[1:08:26] that's not true yeah i just till i just
[1:08:29] went by the pool of bethesda a few days
[1:08:31] ago and you all wanted to kill me and
[1:08:33] guess guess why i remember brother
[1:08:35] daniel
[1:08:36] i'm closing i remember brother daniel
[1:08:38] wednesday night if you were here if you
[1:08:40] heard it online it was so wonderful
[1:08:42] because he's talking about the blind man
[1:08:44] and the pharisees were trying to get out
[1:08:45] of him
[1:08:47] do you believe this prophet
[1:08:49] do you believe this prophet and that was
[1:08:51] the important point is that if you
[1:08:52] believe them you know and they were
[1:08:53] getting ready to write them off do your
[1:08:54] parents believe in this prophet jesus do
[1:08:56] you believe in it and the subject was
[1:08:58] more about do you believe the prophet or
[1:08:59] not
[1:09:01] than his healing
[1:09:03] i loved it when brother daniel and the
[1:09:04] man answer says you know what i don't
[1:09:06] even know this man i don't even know who
[1:09:08] it was he met him later i guess he said
[1:09:10] i don't i don't even know who he is or
[1:09:12] who his ministry is all i know is i was
[1:09:16] blind for 30 years and i can see
[1:09:20] and pharisees looking at the flesh want
[1:09:23] to make it about was it done right you
[1:09:25] know what they criticized and the man
[1:09:26] healed the pool of bethesda they
[1:09:28] overlooked the healing and he says he
[1:09:30] healed him on the sabbath day and he
[1:09:32] told him to pick up his bed and started
[1:09:34] to walk he's working on the sabbath day
[1:09:36] can you imagine men so fleshly that they
[1:09:38] completely miss a man's healing who was
[1:09:41] sick for 38 years jesus walks in and
[1:09:45] says do you want to be healed he said he
[1:09:47] said pick up your bed and he walked away
[1:09:49] and the pharisees woke up and said but
[1:09:51] he did it on the sabbath day
[1:09:55] he worked he picked up his bed on the
[1:09:57] sabbath day and the guy said yeah
[1:09:59] because the same man who told me i'm
[1:10:01] healed is the same man who told me to
[1:10:03] pick up my bed i think i'm going to pick
[1:10:04] up my bed because he healed me
[1:10:07] and so i'm going to obey him as far as
[1:10:08] picking up my bed whether i violated the
[1:10:11] law or not hey guys hello
[1:10:13] i'm healed after 38 years
[1:10:20] how blind can people be by the flesh
[1:10:23] that they miss the moving of god in the
[1:10:26] congregation
[1:10:28] over stupid critical things of how
[1:10:30] people are treating them
[1:10:34] the glory of god is among us and despite
[1:10:36] my flesh and despite your flesh he says
[1:10:39] if we'll keep yielding to the lord god's
[1:10:41] glory will be shown in the congregation
[1:10:44] and that's what i'm here for it's not
[1:10:46] about your flesh not about my flesh it's
[1:10:48] not about william branham's flesh
[1:10:50] it's not about william branham's flesh
[1:10:52] can you say man we have movements in the
[1:10:54] message that are promoting him and make
[1:10:56] him as if he's still alive and all this
[1:10:58] other friends no no no no no it's not
[1:11:01] about william branham it's about our the
[1:11:03] person of the lord jesus christ becoming
[1:11:06] real to us
[1:11:08] i mean that with no respect to the
[1:11:10] prophet i'm not exiting anything i feed
[1:11:12] on this message more than anything else
[1:11:14] i love it that's why i don't like to be
[1:11:16] criticized to say he preaches this and
[1:11:18] he preaches that and he don't preach the
[1:11:19] message what do you mean i've been
[1:11:20] preaching this message and quoting it
[1:11:22] for 33 years now
[1:11:24] i believe it with all my heart but the
[1:11:26] flesh of william branham and and his
[1:11:28] position and all that
[1:11:30] he introduced me to a further
[1:11:32] relationship with jesus christ
[1:11:36] so like john said
[1:11:38] i must decrease but christ must increase
[1:11:42] i'm wondering if that needs to happen in
[1:11:43] the message because they're looking at
[1:11:44] the flesh of william branham and the
[1:11:46] flesh of the people and the flesh of the
[1:11:47] preachers maybe it's
[1:11:49] all the flesh must decrease
[1:11:52] and he must increase in my eyes
[1:11:55] stop
[1:11:56] looking and criticizing
[1:11:58] the flesh
[1:12:00] say god give me a revelation
[1:12:03] to see even the person at walmart that i
[1:12:06] begin to talk with could there be
[1:12:09] something in them
[1:12:11] that would respond to truth
[1:12:14] amen you've been such a good audience
[1:12:16] that's why i keep preaching
[1:12:18] because even after an hour and a half
[1:12:20] you're still mostly still receptive
[1:12:23] some of you are on a clock and you got
[1:12:24] to go but that's all right that's all
[1:12:25] right i love you too i love all of you
[1:12:28] okay please keep coming if you want to
[1:12:30] keep coming
[1:12:31] i'll i'll preach better i'll get better
[1:12:33] at this
[1:12:34] i promise you
[1:12:36] i love you more i do everything i can
[1:12:38] i'm going to tell you the truth but i
[1:12:40] love each of you and i appreciate you
[1:12:42] coming and the reason i can go on a hard
[1:12:43] half if you weren't saying amen and have
[1:12:45] a heart that's saying i really want to
[1:12:47] grow in the lord it would be difficult
[1:12:49] to go this long
[1:12:50] so i'm actually blaming you for
[1:12:52] preaching an hour and a half
[1:12:54] let's stand and rejoice
[1:12:56] hallelujah let's give him praise
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:02] amen give him praise
[1:13:04] [Applause]
[1:13:08] rejoice
[1:13:11] look what the lord has done
[1:13:14] oh he drove away the darkness at the
[1:13:18] rising of the sun
[1:13:22] rejoice rejoice
