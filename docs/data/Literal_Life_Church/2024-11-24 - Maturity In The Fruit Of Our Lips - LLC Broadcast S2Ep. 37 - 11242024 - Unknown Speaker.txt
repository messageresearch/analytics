faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true yes Lord hallelujah praise 3 and verse 1 my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation in other words um maybe you shouldn't want to be a teacher because teachers who have to stand in front of the people uh are under greater scrutiny sometimes so we have to watch what they say a little closer then he goes into a subject on the tongue for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the H's mouths that we may that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body beheld also the ships which though they be so great are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small Helm withs soever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of Nature and is set on fire of hell for every king of beast excuse me every kind of Beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison and you guys think I'm a hard preacher Jam is pretty straight on your tongue therefore bless we God even the father and therewith curse we men with the same tongue bless God and curse men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can a fig tree my brethren bear Olive bear berries either a Vine fig so can no Fountain both yield saltwater and fresh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 15 one verse there uh to catch and bring into the subject this morning for a little bit Hebrews chap 13 and verse 15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name it's a good Thanksgiving scripture the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased we believe that God is looking for more and more from Sons and Daughters of God that we are saved and it's a gift of Salvation God gives us the gift of Salvation he gives us the gift of the Holy Ghost they are free gifts can you say Amen you don't have to do any Works to attain that God gives it to you when you ask him but then after he gives you that then we want to grow to please the Lord more if we're doing anything to grieve him then we want to stop doing the things that grieve him and do more and more things that please the Lord is that okay with everybody and so now now when we when when we become God's looking for more and more sunship or maturity and I believe that the word that we're under in the last days that God has blessed us with he has blessed us with an open book The Bible has become open to us the book of redemption has become open to us in Revelations 5 the lamb took the book and he took the seals off the book that means he has given us something that's not closed but it's open to us and now that we have been given that it says when he come with the open book it says when he was holding the book he hath made us Kings and Priests it's taking us somewhere the Holy Ghost is taking somewhere the the book being open the seals taken off of our Bibles it's taking the people somewhere thou H has made us Kings and Priests he's making you something guess what both of those positions of Kings and Priests require maturity how terrible would it be to put a king in that's immature we're in trouble character is needed to serve in these positions as God moves Us in then positions us with the open book then character maturity is needed in these positions how do we get character how do we get maturity through our trials through what God takes us through that through our trials we stopped acting like babies and saying God I don't want any more trials I don't want to go through anything else I just want life to be cushiony put a cushion around me and when I bump and like that I got a cushion all around me and God says no I'm trying to grow you as a son I'm trying to child train you here I'm trying to discipline you so that you grow up and you can stand on your own can you say Amen said I'm going to be a defeat to the devil today I'm going to overcome I'm going to hold the power and authority within my hands but I'm going to hold hold it with maturity Israel had a history of immaturities for 40 years in the wilderness uh the Bible says in Hebrews that God was not well pleased and God was grieved with an entire generation and so in 1 Corinthians 10 it gives some of these Grievances and gives some of this stuff here's the people that were under the message in that day under Moses message here's how they were first Corinthians 10 and: 10 you guys can put it up if you want moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and the Sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that was followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolators as were some of them as it is written the people sat down and to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and three we're we're reading the history of messaged Believers and the Bible doesn't hide anything lot of you have lot of you have trouble saying amen this is the history of 40 Years of God's people under a prophet and you got idolatry you got fornication uh let's read a little further neither let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed as serpents how did they tempt the Lord they were saying is the Lord among us or not they were questioning whether the Lord was even among them even though he opened up the Red Sea even though he gave them Mana when they were hungry even though they gave them a spiritual Rock when they were thirsty he did Miracle after miracle and they still come up to tempt the Lord saying but really is the Lord really among us or not tempting the Lord immaturity do you say that when you hit a trial that you don't think was fair to you is God really in my life or not why is God doing this why is God allowing this it's immaturity because whatever God allows in my life is going to be for my good verse 10 neither murmur ye as some also murmured I know nobody ever doeses that here here neither murmur me as some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happen for our examples and they're written for our admonition that's a slight rebuke upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall when you think you stand take heed lest you fall by these things because you're not strong within yourself you're only strong when you let the Holy Ghost take over your life can I get a further amen You're Not Strong you will fall to the same things and the same immaturities unless you let the Holy Ghost take over your life so all of this history of Israel under the prophet's message it's not good they're gossiping in their tents they're murmuring they're complaining against Moses they're backbiting they're they're uh disrespectful to God's Prophet they're allowed to say anything against God's prophet and get by with it and so they're babies in the wilderness under God's Prophet babies in the wilderness under God's prophet and so I'll just give you two examples I could go into many of them but there's two examples one in the Old Testament one in the New Testament and both of these people were under the ministry of the son of man one in the Old Testament one in the New Testament they had seen Mighty things that God had done they had watch the son of man in action discern Hearts do all of that do Miracles that that that are amazing amazing and they watched it all under the son of man prophetic Ministry and yet we see a lot of immaturities in their life one example is that when and that's mentioned here in the scripture that I read here in 1 Corinthians 10 it talks about them uh they come across the sea they come across the Red Sea so now I was reading a few weeks ago would you get with me Psalms 106 I was reading this in my devotion and here in 106 gives the entire history of Israel a lot of things I just read and David is being very repentant saying look what our fathers did look what the you know look look at the some of the things that they did but right in the middle of this God gives what he did verse 9 he rebuked the Red Sea I'm inan Psalms 106 ver9 he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the Wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy they stood there and watched all of Pharaoh's Army be drowned in the Red Sea they walked across on dry land on the Red Sea a miracle and the waters covered their enemies that there was not one of them left not one enemy left how many believe that God's powerful enough to put all your enemies in the Red Sea all your habits all your addictions pornography what it whatever it is he's able to drown all of it in the Red Sea verse 12 then then believe they his words and they sang his praise so I thought well praise the Lord and I've heard so many sermons The Last 5 Years on this part of the children of Israel where Mariam sees the Red Sea and all the enemy there and miam picks up the tambourine do I have a tambourine here or they always hide them from me because they don't think I can play it you have are you sister Mariam Viola Viola that's that's good enough that's close enough I I hear so many sermons and I love to hear it because listen when God drowns your troubles in the Red Sea and your enemy you're going to be happy about it you're going to shout about it you're going to Rejoice about it and that's what they did they said they believe because they weren't believing for the all the years before all the Miracles they weren't really believing but now this happens and they're believing and they're praising God Mariam gets her tamarine and all the El the daughters grabbed their Tamarin and she had the whole church all revived as they watched all the bones and all the the uh the the Pharaoh's Army bobbing up and down in the Red Sea J Mary says let's worship together come on everybody I will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and the rider get thrown into the sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse of the r get thrown into the sea woo glory be to God see I can play it they don't think I can play it around here but I can they hide all the tambourines and you can play thank you appreciate it it was a time and I hear so many sermons on it but guess what I hear hardly any sermons of this people how they acted the other side of the Red Sea right and how they were acting just 3 days later after they shouted and it says it in Psalms it says then believe they his words they sang his praise they soon forgot his Works they waited not for his counsel immaturity I tell you friends you can even enjoy the word today and celebrate and feel better with your leave but I don't care how you act in here you can shout you can dance and I I would love for some of you to do it sometimes but it's not what you act like in here it's what you act like in obedience to the word when you leave these doors and they go back and they said but then they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the wilderness he gave them the requests but sent leanness to their soul they envied Moses it goes on and on so one little verse says they shouted but before the Red Sea they were complaining they were saying we're stuck you brought us out here's our Pharaoh's Army coming what are we going to do and even Moses the prophet is complaining and crying unto the Lord what are we going to do and Moses is complaining and God says why are you crying I've given you commission I've said you're going to make it you're going over I don't care if a red sea is there I don't care if the Mediterranean Sea is after that I don't care if the Atlantic oost is after that I have commissioned you you're going to make it you're going to overcome why are you crying because of immaturity grow up as a Son of God stop crying and speak and go forward and Moses said all right he stood up into his position and he says raised his hands and M you watch the movie and everything else God opens up by his command opens up the Red Sea but that's how they were acting before this side of the Red Sea then they get done and read just three one excuse me six verses later after they shouted with their tambourine they ran out of water and they begin to complain that they didn't have any water wow three days three days I believe it was three days now you can put this off in the Old Testament all you want to but this reflects the IM immaturities that come out of our Lives Many Times what do we talk about on Monday what do we talk about when we're depressed what do we talk about when we don't feel God around I don't feel God like I felt him on Sunday so now you start to say anything which is going to be my theme today for a very short time there's two main immaturities that I think were in Israel and that are in the church sometimes the two immaturities let your giving yourself permission to think any thought that you want to think at any time and second of all giving yourself permission to say anything you want at any time there's a lot of scriptures that does not give sons of God a permission to spill out anything out of these tongues that they want to say well I'm an American I have a right to say what I want to say it's free speech you're not an American you're a Christian you're a son of God and sons of God in are a different Kingdom than Americans thanks God we are and we do not give ourselves permission but this is Israel they gave their themselves permission especially in their tents in their homes to say anything they wanted to say to think anything they wanted to think and you've heard me preach about the Mind our thinking process growing in our thinking bringing every thought captive to the Lord every thought has to be scanned by the word of God and if it's not a thought of God you can't give yourself permission to think it whether it's depressing whether it's criticism to someone else whether it's a doubtful thought towards the word of God it should not be allowed in your thinking to go any further than one thought and it is got captive it the handcuffs are put on that thought and said you are not coming into my thought life you know why we give ourselves permission to do it because nobody sees our thought life and should I take an hour and preach on what you let and what you feed on influence your thought life social media movies you think the way you do because of what you feed on an example in the New Testament is Luke 9ine where Jesus has his adoption ceremony and and he's Peter James and John are invited and they're up there and Moses and Elijah up here and so here they all are and uh they fall asleep first of all you know this a pretty big event and uh Peter and James they fall asleep it's pretty big event it's Jesus adoption something's going to happen in the mountain and they were exclusively invited to this and the Bible says they were asleep so they had to be woke up and when they wake up they see Jesus face transfigured in front of them which means he's receiving the approval of God the father and the approval that this is my son I'm pleased to dwell in him there was a radiance they're sleeping they want to build three Tabernacles then they come down out of the mountain and it's about just two days I think such an experience up there seeing Jesus transfigured and they had a little discussion amongst the disciples who's the greatest Among Us they just come from an adoption ceremony where they're supposed to come and they're they're arguing amongst one another who's the greatest among all the the disciples have you guys ever thought about we haven't really decided who takes go over after he's gone then they get done arguing and so you know what happens is is that Jesus answered their he come up to their discussion about who's the greatest among them and he he said let me tell you who's the greatest Among Us he takes a little child sets him in front of the disciples and he says big preachers this is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven if you get your heart like this child in the S because we're to be children in our hearts as far as our response to God adults as far as our power With the Enemy but this is how you receive and this is the greatest in the kingdom and then then just a few hours later Jesus said go into that Village and prepare for the Passover go into that and it was in the Samaritans they go in and they say we won't receive you you can't do it here okay you're Jews we're Samaritans you can't set it up here and you know what they did these guys don't know that we have the son of man here we have the son of man these guys don't know who we are and they have just respected you Lord and they have not received us they have shut the doors to us John said would to God that we call fire down from heaven like Elijah did and just consume the whole Community some immaturities there that's an understatement these are guys following the son of man right next to him every day and somehow gets in this thing is that let's call on on that the same power of Elijah we must have it let's call fire down and blow the whole thing up just because they wouldn't receive us I tell you friends there's a lot more to be said about this but we better ask the Holy Spirit to burn out our bad attitudes you may have truth but you better have character with your truth you may have truth but you better not use that sword on other people you may have truth but I can tell you unbelievers pick up on if it's Pride with your truth and it's not attractive for them to see religious Pride with the truth that you have we don't have a monopoly on truth you don't personally can you say amen God is interested in every human being on the face of the Earth if he had that attitude why don't we have that attitude why are we exclusive Jesus responded and said John and James you don't even know what Spirit you're of right now and that wasn't the end of the rebuke you don't even know what Spirit you got on you let me tell you this you need to know something this son of man Ministry did not come to destroy men's lives it came to save men's lives the perfect man is not sinless Perfection but he is on his way and he's he's well on his way to Growing Up when his tongue is bridled by the Holy Ghost the same as a perfect man he may have SI weaknesses in other areas but he brings that ton control the rest of the body will come come under control bridled by the Holy Ghost the tongue the Bible says how shall we be living how shall we be living and I'm wrapping this up now how shall we be living every day bringing the sacrifice of praise and the fruit of Thanksgiving upon our lips how shall Sons and Daughters be living every day this is what our tongue should be used for all the time you know Thanksgiving is not just the SE a season it's not just a day Thanksgiving to a Christian is a lifestyle when he says bring the sacrifice of praise it doesn't mean just when you come to church when he says bring the Thanksgiving to God upon your lips and that's the fruit of your lips it doesn't mean in church it doesn't mean just it means it's a lifestyle it's not a season it's a lifestyle Thanksgiving is not a day to Christians whoever's listening online the broadcast Thanksgiving is not just a day that for sports and for you're turkey and all that to a Christian Thanksgiving is a lifestyle that it comes out of his lips I am so grateful to God and whatever I'm going through that same God will bring me through it thank you for watching our message
