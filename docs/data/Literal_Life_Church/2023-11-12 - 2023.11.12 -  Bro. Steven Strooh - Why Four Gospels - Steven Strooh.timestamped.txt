[35:29] [Music]
[35:39] amen that was wonderful singing that
[35:42] really lovely I got to enjoy the
[35:45] practice too thank
[35:47] you earlier this morning uh while you're
[35:50] standing if we can uh take our Bibles
[35:53] please and uh we're going to read in our
[35:57] Isaiah I see some familiar
[36:01] faces and I apologize in advance brother
[36:06] Howard nice to see you but uh you might
[36:10] have heard this in some form before so
[36:14] you you heard there's nothing new Under
[36:16] the Sun so um this is uh this is one of
[36:20] those topics that's a perennial for me
[36:22] and I have to tell you it's one of I've
[36:27] been looking at for 40 years and it's
[36:32] it's ever new for me it's a I just love
[36:35] this topic I love the theme uh that it
[36:39] is and I've added some of that in now
[36:42] it's going to be very short you know
[36:45] down it's going to be very short and if
[36:47] we have time at the end of course I'll
[36:49] want to sing a few
[36:53] [Music]
[36:55] specials is that sister
[36:59] Sharon um yes anybody who knows knows I
[37:03] cannot
[37:05] sing so um praise God for his grace that
[37:09] uh at least I can do something for the
[37:11] kingdom it's not singing that's for sure
[37:15] so we're going to look at this topic of
[37:17] why are there four
[37:18] gospels but we're going to kind of go
[37:21] about in a roundabout way so let's uh
[37:23] start there in Isaiah
[37:25] 28 and and um if
[37:28] I'm no I'm not mistaken brother Paul
[37:30] used this scripture the other day and uh
[37:34] I was I was thrilled um to to see that
[37:38] um you might recall the context of this
[37:40] is um it says to whom shall he uh um
[37:46] teach knowledge and and and to who shall
[37:48] we make known and it's um those are
[37:50] drawn from the you know it's in so but
[37:53] in this scripture but then the other
[37:54] part of it is for with stammering lips
[37:56] in another tongue will I speak to this
[37:58] people and this is the rest wherewith
[38:00] I'll cause the weary to rest and so this
[38:03] is a very powerful passage for me uh
[38:06] talks about the Holy Spirit baptism
[38:08] that's the real rest and the day of
[38:10] Pentecost was the stammering lips and
[38:13] and the part that's
[38:16] also difficult is that he said um yet
[38:19] they would not hear and and so we we
[38:22] know all of that is true but uh we're on
[38:24] the other side of that we're on the side
[38:27] that can hear we're on the side that
[38:29] does want the knowledge is drawn from
[38:31] the breast right so let's read it
[38:34] together verse n Whom Shall he teach
[38:36] knowledge and Whom Shall he make to
[38:38] understand Doctrine this is the part
[38:40] that's a little bit tricky sometimes is
[38:43] um when the word Doctrine comes up uh
[38:45] people sort of shudder you know they
[38:48] they kind of get oh no you know this is
[38:50] going to be one of those things and I
[38:53] we'll we'll get to that in a second but
[38:56] obviously it's important that that we
[38:59] understand Doctrine and it's them that
[39:01] are weaned from the milk and drawn from
[39:03] the breasts for and here's the critical
[39:06] thing these next um five six lines on
[39:09] your screen are actually repeating the
[39:12] same thing now when when the Bible uses
[39:15] the limited amount of space it has to
[39:17] repeat something you know it's important
[39:20] right so for precept verse 10 for
[39:23] precept must be upon precept he repeats
[39:26] that precept upon precept that means a
[39:29] principle right line upon line line upon
[39:34] line here a little and there a little
[39:38] but the word of the Lord was unto them
[39:40] precept upon precept is verse 13 now
[39:43] precept upon precept line upon line line
[39:47] upon line here a little and there a
[39:49] little so it's it's very important that
[39:53] we look at scripture in the right way
[39:55] and that's what I'm going to going to
[39:56] hopefully uh be able to work through uh
[39:59] this this morning what I wanted to to
[40:03] just share is um many years ago a
[40:06] Pentecostal preacher Theologian uh when
[40:10] I was trying to share something with him
[40:12] from the scripture he said no no wait
[40:15] wait wait you can't do that what what
[40:18] can't I do he said look any
[40:21] precept without um uh any sorry
[40:28] uh uh I'll get back to
[40:32] that uh it
[40:36] um with anyway that's amazing that that
[40:40] just left me I'll it'll come back to me
[40:42] in a second so let's just bow our heads
[40:45] Heavenly Father we just want to come
[40:47] before your throne we want to give you
[40:49] all the glory Lord all the praise all
[40:51] the honor and Lord anything that's
[40:54] worthy Lord we want to think on those
[40:56] things this morning anything that has
[40:58] virtue anything that's good and pure and
[41:00] and of good report Lord and that's your
[41:02] word this morning we just want to give
[41:05] this time to you Lord we want to devote
[41:07] our our hearts and Minds Lord to to your
[41:10] word and Lord we pray that you would
[41:12] speak your word Lord that as we come to
[41:15] you we know that we have this truth Lord
[41:19] but it does need to be quickened by your
[41:21] spirit and so Lord I just pray that your
[41:24] spirit would move from hot to Heart this
[41:26] morning and Quicken this word in each of
[41:29] us we pray in jesus' name amen you may
[41:33] be seated I got it praise God he said
[41:38] hold on you can't do that any
[41:42] text without a
[41:45] context is a
[41:48] pretext and what he meant was if you're
[41:51] going to preach something if you're
[41:53] going to make up a Doctrine or have a
[41:55] doct
[41:57] you can't take a verse here and a verse
[42:01] there and a verse here and then sort of
[42:03] build a picture out of that because your
[42:06] text has to have a
[42:08] context and uh for a theologian the
[42:11] context could be cultural could be
[42:13] historic it could be the related to the
[42:16] character of the person that you're
[42:19] talking about what type of character
[42:21] they were and all of that becomes the
[42:24] context for the text
[42:27] the the the text without that context to
[42:30] them is just a pretext you're just
[42:32] making it up but the difference is if
[42:35] you have a
[42:37] precept if you have a
[42:39] principle and you're looking at that
[42:42] picture you're looking at that principle
[42:44] while you're reading the verses now
[42:48] those texts do have a context it's not
[42:52] their context but it's a context of the
[42:55] overall picture and when we think of
[42:58] brother bram's Ministry and we think of
[43:00] the message and we think of all the
[43:02] things that we've been taught uh do you
[43:06] notice how much of it is principle based
[43:09] it's picture based he's always we talk
[43:12] about types and shadows right it's
[43:14] picture-based but that's what the Old
[43:17] Testament was for the Old Testament was
[43:19] there for a shadow for for a picture so
[43:23] we can understand so um the Bible says
[43:26] that the law that Old Testament was our
[43:29] school Master to bring us to Christ so
[43:32] you can't understand Christ if you don't
[43:35] understand the context of the Old
[43:37] Testament if you can see how those
[43:40] things
[43:41] particular
[43:43] Enoch uh the ark all of these things are
[43:47] are contexts for the things that we
[43:49] believe when we see the number seven we
[43:51] think of the church ages if we see the
[43:54] number four we think think of the
[43:56] gospels we think of redemption so these
[43:59] are this is what the Bible means when it
[44:01] says precept upon precept and notice
[44:04] contrary to my Theologian friend it's
[44:07] here a little and there a little and
[44:10] it's ly upon line and so now here's the
[44:15] problem I understand where they're
[44:17] coming from because you can get sideways
[44:22] if you don't have the right picture
[44:24] brother renom says this Jehovah jar if
[44:26] you're reading between the lines which
[44:29] we know is a good thing most of the time
[44:32] but you make it say something between
[44:34] the lines that's different than what the
[44:37] lines
[44:38] say then it's wrong all right and how
[44:42] many times have I seen that that
[44:44] somebody would tell me something and
[44:47] I'll be wait a minute there's a
[44:48] scripture that says the exact opposite
[44:50] of what you're saying and that's not
[44:53] right and this morning we were doing the
[44:55] adult Bible class and we're talking
[44:57] about sayings that are not in scripture
[45:00] and and so there's so many things that
[45:02] we say um the one we were talking about
[45:05] a little bit later um was um uh this too
[45:10] shall pass now it sounds comforting I
[45:15] suppose you know it's going to pass um
[45:19] but there's no scripture right that says
[45:21] this two shall pass and in fact you may
[45:24] die right
[45:27] that's
[45:29] true so obviously it didn't
[45:32] pass so you have to be careful that
[45:36] that's actually an old Persian um um
[45:40] myth or uh fa uh that actually developed
[45:44] that saying and then uh in about
[45:46] 1892 uh Abraham Lincoln used it in
[45:49] Wisconsin uh in one of his speeches and
[45:52] so it became part of the the common uh
[45:55] speech that people will uh use that term
[45:57] but I can tell you be careful of slogans
[46:00] you know we live in an age of oh boy I'm
[46:02] off my notes already uh we live in an
[46:05] age of of um of sound buts and and you
[46:10] know if we can say something in two or
[46:13] three words then you know like a text
[46:15] without a pretext the context right if
[46:17] you can say something like that um it
[46:20] has the Ring of truth because it's kind
[46:22] of cute the way it's it's worded this
[46:26] two shall pass it sounds good but when
[46:30] the king had this engraved on his ring
[46:33] uh this two shall pass and he wanted to
[46:35] look at that when he was sad and he
[46:37] hoped it would make him happy and it
[46:39] turned out to have the exact opposite
[46:41] effect and so when we use that term this
[46:44] two Shall Pass we're actually pulling on
[46:47] something that was really not very
[46:50] successful at at at producing the
[46:52] comfort that it was intended to so be
[46:55] careful careful about slogans be careful
[46:57] about bumper sticker theology all right
[47:00] it rarely works it rarely works because
[47:05] it it's the word of God it's Rich it's
[47:09] deep he says drawn from the the breasts
[47:12] you taken wean from the milk this isn't
[47:16] The Superficial kind of gospel that
[47:19] people sometimes and and um you know
[47:22] Sister Sherry I appreciate you your
[47:24] enthusiasm but it reminds me of the
[47:27] number of
[47:29] songs your dad had a lovely saying he
[47:33] said when we were listening to some song
[47:34] or other and he would say well I wish I
[47:38] had written those words and he didn't
[47:40] mean
[47:41] it in other words some songs are very TR
[47:46] they have very little depth they they
[47:48] don't they don't um bring out anything
[47:51] more than we knew before it just seems
[47:54] like pablum just seems like something
[47:57] that you would say so be careful of that
[47:59] we we need to uh faith comes by hearing
[48:02] hearing comes by the word of God if we
[48:03] want to encourage somebody in the
[48:05] scripture let's tell them he's the
[48:06] friend that sticks closer than a brother
[48:09] he'll never leave you nor forsake you
[48:11] all right these are the scriptures that
[48:13] people can hold on to that will give
[48:15] them true Comfort all right so brother
[48:18] Brandon says don't say what you think is
[48:21] between the lines and it's different
[48:23] from what's on the line
[48:26] so when it says line upon line here a
[48:28] little there a little yes there's an
[48:30] implication that we're looking between
[48:33] the the thoughts in the scripture and
[48:35] we're finding more in there than maybe
[48:37] is expressed in those verses but you
[48:40] can't say something that contradicts
[48:43] scripture all right so then brother
[48:44] renam goes on to say this the Bible is
[48:48] just like a great jigsa puzzle you've
[48:50] got to have something over here to look
[48:54] at if you don't you'll have a cow
[48:56] picking grass on top of a tree all right
[48:59] I'm not much of a jigsa puzzle person
[49:02] but uh I used to get frustrated my
[49:04] parents loved the 5,000 piece puzzle oh
[49:07] my goodness put it out on the dining
[49:10] room table we had to eat on our laps for
[49:12] a month
[49:13] and it it and you know every every time
[49:18] somebody walked past they they got a
[49:20] piece and they they puzzled over where
[49:22] it might go and my trick was just to
[49:25] take a piece that looked close and bang
[49:28] it into place and I've noticed that some
[49:31] people do that with the scripture if it
[49:34] doesn't fit they use the uh the Mallet
[49:38] method um and uh they just force it into
[49:42] place and it doesn't matter if the cow
[49:44] is eating grass on top of the tree I got
[49:46] that piece in all right and I think what
[49:49] put me of jigel puzzle pieces by the way
[49:52] was uh when a piece got lost and we
[49:54] didn't know it
[49:57] that was too frustrating for me so when
[50:01] you look at the scripture here a little
[50:03] there a little we're looking at the
[50:04] pieces of the puzzle and this is how
[50:07] theologians work unfortunately when
[50:10] they're trained they're train to take
[50:12] the
[50:14] scriptures and let them speak for
[50:16] themselves you've heard that
[50:18] expression all right so they take the
[50:21] verses they take the fact that there's
[50:23] four Gospels
[50:26] and they never take the time to and i'
[50:29] I've read quite a few articles actually
[50:31] this week why four gospels they called
[50:33] that and it's anything but what we're
[50:36] going to talk about this morning it's
[50:38] like they're taking the pieces and
[50:41] trying to look at them like you might be
[50:44] looking at these pieces going I wonder
[50:47] what that is now Kathy my art historian
[50:52] wife uh picked it out in about 5 minutes
[50:55] it's not even about 15
[50:58] seconds does anybody want to compete
[51:01] with
[51:02] that last supper is that what you said
[51:06] and that's it the last supper now
[51:09] fortunately we already have that picture
[51:13] in our mind the last supper so we look
[51:15] at some of those things there's some of
[51:17] them specifically that remind you of the
[51:20] last supper and that's how we approach
[51:23] scripture we've got the message Mage
[51:25] we've got the picture we understand the
[51:28] godhead we understand a lot of Concepts
[51:32] from the scripture and so when we're
[51:34] reading these verses we're going oh I
[51:37] know where that piece goes all right but
[51:39] what if we had never had that
[51:42] picture how would you know what that is
[51:44] how would you know where those pieces
[51:46] went together and that's only six I
[51:49] can't remember 24 pieces or something
[51:51] imagine all the verses in the Bible what
[51:54] a what a a challenge that would be and
[51:57] that's why these theologians study for
[51:59] so long all right they got to work out
[52:01] where all the pieces go so if you see
[52:04] the picture on the box Oh What A
[52:06] Difference it makes right wow now we can
[52:09] all right I I'm looking okay I see
[52:12] that's part of the ceiling and so and so
[52:14] forth um one of the big disappointments
[52:17] for me is looking at this picture is
[52:19] that if you go and see uh the Last
[52:22] Supper in situ it looks terrible it's
[52:24] all ated and it's it's hard to recognize
[52:28] it doesn't look like this if I'm you
[52:30] know so I'm like oh wish should look
[52:32] like this but you know it actually is
[52:35] painted it's a fresco it's painted on
[52:36] the wall and it's very dull and they
[52:38] keep the lights down low to preserve it
[52:40] and oh well but we've got the picture so
[52:44] we know how these pieces go together so
[52:48] we're going to look at why there's four
[52:50] gospels but we're going to start with
[52:52] how many bibles God wrote now this isn't
[52:55] new for most of you but I hope in the
[52:57] context it'll make sense why we're doing
[53:00] this so first of all um it's nice that
[53:03] they all begin with the G makes them a
[53:05] little more memorable so the gospels
[53:08] right so it's the galaxies God's first
[53:11] Bible was in the stars and then his the
[53:14] next Bible was the pyramid that's the
[53:16] granite it was made of a beautiful pink
[53:19] uh granite and then uh there's the
[53:22] gospels themselves of course and then of
[53:25] course there's uh the Gentiles the the
[53:27] Gentile church and in each case God was
[53:32] um expressing himself he was writing a
[53:35] Bible right he was it was uh he was um
[53:39] so God can't change God can't add
[53:42] knowledge all right so when God knows
[53:45] something he he knows it all right
[53:48] everything so whenever he does something
[53:50] he's expressing what he already knows so
[53:54] when he's going to going to make uh the
[53:56] Stars when he's going to make the Zodiac
[53:59] in this case he he's going to do it
[54:02] completely consistent with uh what he
[54:06] knows uh about uh the word and that the
[54:09] word is always surrounded by four
[54:13] bodyguards right so when he makes uh the
[54:16] path of the earth through the the the
[54:20] solar system when it goes around the Sun
[54:23] different constellations are going to
[54:24] come to you know to to look um bigger in
[54:28] the sky they're going to appear in the
[54:30] sky and there's going to be 12 of those
[54:33] because 12 can be divided by four so you
[54:35] can divide it into four different
[54:37] regions God knows that so when we have
[54:40] seasons he doesn't have Five Seasons or
[54:43] six seasons all right so after the flood
[54:45] when the seasons were first there were
[54:47] no Seasons Before the Flood the way they
[54:49] knew the season was by looking at the
[54:52] Galaxy looking at the stars looking at
[54:54] the zodiac and so after the flood was
[54:56] the first mention of summer and winter
[55:00] and and spring so the four seasons are
[55:04] mentioned but it's not five and it's not
[55:06] six and it's not three that's the that's
[55:08] the key because the Sun the s o n is the
[55:11] center of our solar system and we know
[55:14] the scripture talks about the sun of
[55:16] righteousness Rising with healing in his
[55:18] wings so God is equating this great big
[55:21] sun in the sky with his word and when
[55:25] people tell me there's three Gods I
[55:27] always want to ask them how many sons do
[55:29] you
[55:30] see because if there's only one Su n
[55:34] there's only one center of the universe
[55:37] there's only of the solar system there's
[55:39] only one God so the first was the
[55:41] galaxies then in Granite the pyramid
[55:44] then of course the gospels and then your
[55:46] seven churches in Asia so let's look at
[55:50] that verse in Genesis 1:14 you can read
[55:53] it on the screen or you can turn to it
[55:55] and God said let there be lights in the
[55:57] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[55:59] day from the night and let them be for
[56:01] signs and for seasons and for days and
[56:04] years so you might recall the previous
[56:06] verse God says and uh he made the
[56:10] greater light to Rule the Day and the
[56:11] Lesser light to rule the night and he
[56:13] made the Stars also you'll notice he
[56:15] used the word made not create so when
[56:18] people want to argue about the days of
[56:21] creation they get this all mixed up
[56:23] because the creation took place in
[56:26] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created
[56:30] the next time we see the word creat is
[56:32] when he's making the living organisms so
[56:35] it's important that we know the
[56:37] difference so when it says God made the
[56:39] sun moon and stars he's not saying he
[56:42] created them he's saying he made them
[56:45] for a purpose he made them to do a job
[56:49] he made the sun to rule the day he made
[56:52] the moon to rule the night he made the
[56:54] Stars in this verse for signs and for
[56:57] seasons and for days and years he didn't
[56:59] create the sun moon and stars in the
[57:02] fourth day as uh some people are
[57:05] inclined to think but it's important
[57:07] that we know that God intended us to
[57:10] look at the stars and see them as signs
[57:14] in other words we can read the Stars
[57:17] just like he told job re tell the Stars
[57:21] if you can and then another place name
[57:23] those Stars and then he talks to to to
[57:26] to job about the names of the stars he
[57:28] says who can bring forth uh mazero in
[57:31] his season or gu Urus with his sons or
[57:34] bind the sweet influences of pades so
[57:37] this is God challenging Moses on these
[57:41] signs so it's no point in US ignoring
[57:43] them God thought enough of them to
[57:46] actually challenge job on the signs in
[57:49] the Stars so that was his first Bible we
[57:52] haven't got time to spend on all these
[57:55] uh topic so we're going to have to rush
[57:57] ahead and then the next one is there's
[58:00] this beautiful scripture in Isaiah which
[58:03] talks about an altar in the midst of the
[58:05] pillar of the land of Egypt a pillar at
[58:07] the border that's the border between
[58:09] Upper and Lower Egypt and it'll be a
[58:12] sign and for a witness so here we come
[58:14] back to the concept of a sign so this is
[58:16] the picture remember we we've got the
[58:19] picture on the box we know we're looking
[58:22] at uh these four gospels Jesus is the
[58:25] center of those gospels now how does the
[58:27] pyramid inform us how does what does it
[58:31] help us to understand as we look at
[58:34] those things uh that God did and see how
[58:37] is that uh relevant to how we understand
[58:41] scripture so I don't have time to go
[58:43] into that today but I do want to just
[58:45] share with you this sometimes people get
[58:48] confused when they see the word pyramid
[58:50] because they think of the the
[58:51] three-sided New Age crystal pyramids all
[58:55] right that you hang for the
[58:57] energy whatever anyway and uh that
[59:01] that's not this right that that's that's
[59:04] not this this this is the Great Pyramid
[59:06] in Egypt and uh it's got nothing to do
[59:09] with new age C Crystal Theory or
[59:13] whatever it is but what is interesting
[59:16] is that it has four sides not five six
[59:20] three it's got four sides and it's also
[59:24] missing
[59:25] the Capstone so already we're getting
[59:28] some of this picture that we're looking
[59:30] for when we look back at these things
[59:33] that God has done and we say how does
[59:35] that fit with what I know and one of the
[59:39] things we know is that six is the number
[59:41] of man now sometimes it's hard for
[59:44] people to visualize this but if you look
[59:46] at that pyramid how many sides does it
[59:49] have so it's four sides there's a flat
[59:53] on the top so that's a side and there's
[59:56] obviously the flat on the bottom so
[59:57] that's a side so the the pyramid as it
[1:00:00] is now has six sides and what is it what
[1:00:04] does that represent what do we learn
[1:00:06] when we go into the pyramid is we learn
[1:00:08] it has to do with uh the the the um the
[1:00:12] Gentiles and the Jews are are
[1:00:15] represented in that pyramid and there's
[1:00:17] so many lessons that we can learn I call
[1:00:20] it the the messages in the passages
[1:00:23] because there's so so much that we can
[1:00:25] learn from that pyramid But ultimately
[1:00:28] what we know from the the the Revelation
[1:00:31] that we have today again this is that
[1:00:33] picture that we have is that there's a
[1:00:36] Capstone that's supposed to be on this
[1:00:38] pyramid now the Capstone is a miniature
[1:00:41] pyramid the only difference is it only
[1:00:44] has five
[1:00:45] sides all right there's the bottom and
[1:00:48] the four sides now what's beautiful
[1:00:51] about that is that when the head comes
[1:00:53] to the body whoops I'm going backwards
[1:00:56] when the head comes to the body to to
[1:00:59] unite with that body
[1:01:02] that six-sided
[1:01:04] pyramid now becomes a five-sided pyramid
[1:01:08] so when the Capstone comes down on that
[1:01:11] pyramid now we have that same Grace
[1:01:15] virtue Mercy all those five words five
[1:01:19] letter words that we associate with
[1:01:23] Jesus all right and so you can see how
[1:01:27] these pictures help us not so much to
[1:01:30] see what the scripture means but to have
[1:01:34] confidence that we have the right
[1:01:36] picture when we look at those scriptures
[1:01:39] so if if this didn't work out if this
[1:01:41] was six and seven and eight and nine and
[1:01:44] all kinds of other weird numbers I
[1:01:46] wouldn't be here talking about it
[1:01:49] because it wouldn't make any sense but
[1:01:51] the fact that it does make sense that
[1:01:53] this is one of God's Bibles is is why I
[1:01:56] find it so exciting and I and I like to
[1:01:58] share it because it gives us confidence
[1:02:01] in the Precision of scripture and the
[1:02:05] Revelation that we have today and we see
[1:02:08] them coming together in unity and that
[1:02:12] um seems to override any other um issues
[1:02:16] that we may think we have because we can
[1:02:19] say well this is this is not happen
[1:02:21] stance so if you think of Christ as the
[1:02:24] Center of this pyramid then we would
[1:02:27] expect it to have four sides and that
[1:02:29] would be those four gospels Matthew Mark
[1:02:32] Luke and John right so no no time to go
[1:02:35] into all that but let's look at the
[1:02:37] church so the Gentiles would eventually
[1:02:41] form those seven Church ages and what do
[1:02:45] we see going through those Church ages
[1:02:47] from Revelation chapter 6 we see the The
[1:02:51] Lion and the ox and the man and the
[1:02:53] eagle that those different anointings of
[1:02:56] Christ's spirit that were on those ages
[1:02:59] showing that the word is at the center
[1:03:02] of this Gentile church and that's what
[1:03:05] he said when he said that that that
[1:03:07] Jesus was in the midst of the
[1:03:09] Candlestick so if Jesus is in the midst
[1:03:11] of the Candlestick we have to see the
[1:03:14] four uh body Gods if you like that would
[1:03:18] surround him just like we do in the
[1:03:20] pyramid just like we do in the galaxies
[1:03:23] all right it makes sense right if you
[1:03:25] have the right picture it's going to fit
[1:03:28] everywhere all right so when God began
[1:03:30] building his church on a firm foundation
[1:03:34] where there's no confusion or chaos as I
[1:03:38] heard sister Gabby singing this morning
[1:03:41] all right it's on a firm foundation it's
[1:03:45] on four gospel pillars most foundations
[1:03:49] that we look at the basic Foundation is
[1:03:53] for corner of a of a building doesn't
[1:03:57] matter how many how they manipulate it
[1:03:59] but generally that's the standard all
[1:04:02] right and so God used the four gospel
[1:04:05] pillars as the foundation for the
[1:04:08] teachings of those 12 Apostles all right
[1:04:12] now that should make you think H the New
[1:04:16] Testament is the Old Testament revealed
[1:04:20] so if God's using four gospel pillars
[1:04:22] and 12 Apostles
[1:04:25] hm maybe we'll find out something as we
[1:04:28] go through this and then of course this
[1:04:30] is the the the the um the uh the the
[1:04:34] church ages and these are those seals
[1:04:37] these are the the lion the ox the man
[1:04:38] and the eagle and we're right there at
[1:04:40] the end where it says catching away and
[1:04:43] uh unfortunately I only have question
[1:04:45] marks there um I can't tell you any more
[1:04:48] than that and if I could you wouldn't
[1:04:50] have me here all right so where did this
[1:04:53] whole start start so this is one of
[1:04:55] those things that we want to make sure
[1:04:57] that we have uh it straight from the end
[1:04:59] to the beginning brother Ram often said
[1:05:01] from Genesis to Revelation and you know
[1:05:04] it sounds grandiose to say that like
[1:05:06] we're going to take the whole Bible you
[1:05:08] know and we're going to unravel it like
[1:05:11] like uh these threads and we're going to
[1:05:13] make it all say the same thing well
[1:05:15] that's a tall order unless you have the
[1:05:18] right picture unless you've seen the
[1:05:19] picture on the box now we can go back to
[1:05:22] Genesis and say okay I know what that
[1:05:24] serpent was I know what he did because I
[1:05:26] read it in
[1:05:28] Revelation amen that's because in
[1:05:30] Genesis it's just the seed form it's
[1:05:32] just like almost invisible I challenge
[1:05:35] anybody to take an acorn seed and look
[1:05:38] at it and visualize an oak tree all
[1:05:40] right you can't you can't do it all
[1:05:43] right once you've seen the oak tree it's
[1:05:45] like oh I didn't know that that was all
[1:05:47] inside that Little Acorn all right so
[1:05:50] you you look go back to Genesis and
[1:05:52] people say well I don't see what you're
[1:05:53] seeing' well it's because you don't have
[1:05:55] the picture and and that's why this is
[1:05:58] so important that's why I love this
[1:05:59] study so much so the picture in the in
[1:06:02] the Garden of Eden is when they sinned
[1:06:05] there were four cherubim that were
[1:06:09] placed in the garden and they turned
[1:06:12] each way all right how many ways are
[1:06:15] there geographically speaking north
[1:06:18] south east west right so there's four
[1:06:20] ways and they kept the way
[1:06:24] does it say to the tree of life I think
[1:06:27] that's the picture we get and especially
[1:06:29] if you if you're looking at a drawing in
[1:06:31] a children's Bible or something they'll
[1:06:33] show you this little path with the with
[1:06:35] a beautiful Eden in the background and
[1:06:37] the thorns and thistles growing in the
[1:06:39] front right and this is the path to the
[1:06:41] tree of life but it doesn't say that
[1:06:44] it's the way of the tree of life and and
[1:06:48] brother Brenham talks about that but
[1:06:51] these uh cherubim and this flaming sword
[1:06:54] keeping the way of the tree of life is
[1:06:57] referenced in
[1:06:59] Ezekiel where he talks about those four
[1:07:02] living creatures and then he talks about
[1:07:04] the cherubim uh in chapter 10 and he
[1:07:07] says those are the same ones I saw when
[1:07:09] I was by the the the river of kah all
[1:07:13] right so kind of got the picture those
[1:07:15] cherubim uh keeping the way of the Tree
[1:07:18] of Life uh each way that means there's
[1:07:20] four ways so if Christ is the tree of of
[1:07:24] life that's the center of the uh of of
[1:07:27] uh that story of of Garden of Eden all
[1:07:30] right well then we would expect to see
[1:07:32] these four guards uh bodyguards around
[1:07:37] uh that tree right and we'll see this
[1:07:39] picture come up now that's in Genesis
[1:07:42] now we're kind of doing the wrong thing
[1:07:45] we're looking at that Genesis and we're
[1:07:47] creating this picture of four cherubim
[1:07:50] we don't know if there were four doesn't
[1:07:52] say there were four cherubim but when
[1:07:54] you have the picture you can come back
[1:07:56] to this and say ah there were probably
[1:07:58] four cherubim because they went each way
[1:08:02] all right well the Flaming sword went
[1:08:04] each way so brother Brandon said these
[1:08:07] cherubim were by the way anyway cherubim
[1:08:10] is a plural word by the way cherub is
[1:08:13] the singular cherubim is plural so
[1:08:16] cherubims is plural plural anyway but
[1:08:20] that's that's the way it is in the
[1:08:21] scripture so that's fine to use cherubim
[1:08:24] and these cherubims were placed at the
[1:08:26] East Gate of the garden going four ways
[1:08:30] cherubims were placed there to guard the
[1:08:32] way of the tree of life the way he says
[1:08:36] who is the way isn't that beautiful so
[1:08:39] now we get a an understanding that it's
[1:08:42] God himself who's protecting his word
[1:08:47] he's not leaving it up to some some
[1:08:50] cherubs right or cherubim if you like he
[1:08:54] he's taking care of it himself and that
[1:08:57] flaming sword that reminds us of the
[1:08:59] two-edged sword of his word and so it's
[1:09:02] his word that's protecting the way of
[1:09:06] the tree of life so if we don't find
[1:09:09] Christ it's because we haven't come his
[1:09:12] way his provided way is the way we would
[1:09:16] see it so we can see how this all fits
[1:09:18] together so beautifully so if you have
[1:09:21] the picture it's really easy and these
[1:09:25] patterns and principles that we've been
[1:09:27] looking at up until now they form a
[1:09:30] picture and so if you have the patterns
[1:09:34] that can tie this all together we can
[1:09:37] place those position those pieces
[1:09:39] correctly now why is that important it's
[1:09:42] because we're part of that
[1:09:45] word and as we heard uh recently in the
[1:09:50] service we're to be
[1:09:52] positioned correct directly so I'm going
[1:09:55] to take just two minutes on that when
[1:09:58] those Stars sun moon and stars were made
[1:10:02] to do their jobs in Genesis chapter 1 on
[1:10:07] the fourth day remember the first day
[1:10:10] there was chaos Darkness was on the face
[1:10:13] of the Earth then the SEC and then light
[1:10:16] struck the Earth all right and the
[1:10:19] second day the atmosphere changed now
[1:10:23] there was an atmosphere where life could
[1:10:25] exist the firmament above and the
[1:10:27] firmament and you know the story and
[1:10:30] then the dry land appeared so now
[1:10:32] there's a bedding ground for that seed
[1:10:35] and so that seed that was already in the
[1:10:37] earth now had the right environment it
[1:10:40] had light it had water it had an oxygen
[1:10:43] atmosphere that it could grow in and so
[1:10:46] guess what the seed starts to grow the
[1:10:49] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:10:52] yielding fruit is seed is in itself and
[1:10:55] they started to grow and produce again
[1:11:00] the seed that was in them this is all
[1:11:03] just like us all
[1:11:06] right Hank Williams I Saw The Light all
[1:11:10] right he could have been back there
[1:11:12] writing that song All right so when the
[1:11:15] atmosphere lifted off the Earth that
[1:11:18] solid water and it turned into water
[1:11:20] vapor with a beautiful mix of oxygen and
[1:11:24] nitrogen we won't get into right now but
[1:11:27] that actually created the atmosphere in
[1:11:31] which that life could come into the seed
[1:11:34] so God said let that seed bring forth of
[1:11:37] its kind all right now the atmospher so
[1:11:40] that's the third day so justification I
[1:11:42] Saw The Light sanctification Separation
[1:11:45] The Waters from the waters Waters from
[1:11:46] the dry land Third Day Life came into
[1:11:49] those seeds that's the baptism of the
[1:11:51] Holy Spirit now what happens on the four
[1:11:53] fourth
[1:11:54] day he
[1:11:56] positions the sun moon and
[1:11:59] stars so having been Justified
[1:12:02] Sanctified baptized Holy Spirit God now
[1:12:05] makes us do something he places us to be
[1:12:10] something in the world a light that
[1:12:14] others can find their way Jesus said now
[1:12:18] you are the light of the world and so as
[1:12:21] God positions us that's why it's so
[1:12:22] important to have that understanding of
[1:12:25] your position is that others can then
[1:12:28] take their direction from you so it's
[1:12:31] like you're a
[1:12:33] constellation when you're properly
[1:12:35] positioned and they look up and they say
[1:12:37] oh there's the Big Dipper or there's
[1:12:39] Orion or there's the pades or there's
[1:12:43] Urus all right they are saying that way
[1:12:47] is the way we need to go because now
[1:12:50] they have direction from the Stars when
[1:12:52] do the stars come out out when the Sun
[1:12:54] goes away so our roles don't mean much
[1:12:59] if Jesus Is Here In the Flesh all right
[1:13:03] but it's when he said the Night Comes
[1:13:06] when no man can work when that when that
[1:13:09] happens now our little lights
[1:13:13] shine and that's why this is so
[1:13:15] important because we're like those
[1:13:18] little pieces of the puzzle being
[1:13:20] properly positioned to tell the right
[1:13:24] story because if we're ambassadors of
[1:13:27] Christ and we're not telling the right
[1:13:29] story we're not representing
[1:13:33] Christ in a way that people can trust
[1:13:37] right so if you have the picture H this
[1:13:41] isn't helping right because none of you
[1:13:43] can tell me what that is all you brght
[1:13:45] Sparks that knew this was uh D Vinci
[1:13:48] earlier um but I guarantee you you don't
[1:13:51] know what this
[1:13:52] is
[1:13:54] challenge all right nobody gets the the
[1:13:57] the the prize all right you have to have
[1:14:01] some kind of a picture and that's what
[1:14:04] looking at the verses of the Bible can
[1:14:06] be like so all right so there's the
[1:14:08] picture well it's it's okay but um
[1:14:13] sometimes we don't even have the picture
[1:14:15] we just have the shadow of the
[1:14:17] picture all right but even the shape or
[1:14:21] the shadow will help us to understand
[1:14:24] what we're trying to make all right so
[1:14:27] now the light bulb went off I think all
[1:14:31] right and so we know what the shape is
[1:14:35] that these pieces are trying to make so
[1:14:38] first thing we want to do is we want to
[1:14:40] make sure we're looking at the scripture
[1:14:42] in the right way rightly dividing the
[1:14:45] word of Truth turning the the scripture
[1:14:48] at the right angle so we're not putting
[1:14:50] the cow on top of the tree we want to
[1:14:53] make sure that we're looking at the
[1:14:55] scripture and saying okay now this is a
[1:14:57] Redemptive scripture or this is uh
[1:15:00] something from the law are we making
[1:15:02] sure that the the verses are properly um
[1:15:06] oriented before they get positioned they
[1:15:09] have to be oriented just like we as
[1:15:10] Believers we need to be properly
[1:15:12] oriented before we get placed all right
[1:15:16] so now when we move those pieces into
[1:15:19] position now we've got a picture that uh
[1:15:23] what was actually that original picture
[1:15:25] that I showed you a couple of slides ago
[1:15:27] that made the shadow so this is the
[1:15:30] reality that made the Shadow and the
[1:15:32] shadow was enough for us to inform us of
[1:15:36] how to put these pieces together that's
[1:15:39] how we're looking at the four gospels
[1:15:42] for the law having a shadow of good
[1:15:44] things to come and not the very image so
[1:15:47] sometimes when you're looking at a type
[1:15:49] or a shadow uh people might say well uh
[1:15:52] Joseph wasn't sold sold for 30 pieces of
[1:15:55] silver he was sold for 20 pieces of
[1:15:58] silver but you know that's not exact you
[1:16:00] know no it's not meant to be exact
[1:16:03] because it's if it was exact he would
[1:16:04] have been Jesus all right so it's very
[1:16:08] it's very important that we understand
[1:16:11] uh how this uh how this uh these
[1:16:13] patterns work and then Isaiah 8:20
[1:16:16] another one of my very favorite
[1:16:18] scriptures to the law and to the
[1:16:21] testimony that's the testimony of of the
[1:16:23] prophets if they speak not according to
[1:16:26] this
[1:16:28] word the
[1:16:30] absolute not the madeup one not some
[1:16:34] idea of man but the absolute word of God
[1:16:38] based on the law and the testimony it's
[1:16:41] because there is no light in
[1:16:45] them and light often means understanding
[1:16:49] so when that previous verse read who
[1:16:51] shall he make to understand understand
[1:16:53] Doctrine uh Jesus said uh He who reads
[1:16:58] uh Daniel the Prophet Daniel he said let
[1:17:01] him understand there there's a time that
[1:17:04] we have to we can't just take things at
[1:17:06] a superficial level we can't just take
[1:17:09] the milk of the word we've got to dig a
[1:17:12] Little Deeper we've got to go for
[1:17:15] understanding all right understanding
[1:17:17] doesn't mean repetition so sometimes I
[1:17:20] hear people repeating a scripture and
[1:17:22] they have no idea what it means they
[1:17:24] they don't have that understanding and
[1:17:27] that's what the scripture is encouraging
[1:17:28] us to do is to have understanding and if
[1:17:32] you want to have understanding you've
[1:17:34] got to be able to put together the Old
[1:17:37] Testament as our school Master to bring
[1:17:39] us to Christ now there's something
[1:17:41] interesting about this pattern of four
[1:17:45] is we're going to
[1:17:46] find that of the four things that we're
[1:17:49] going to look at three are the same or
[1:17:53] at least have similar characteristics
[1:17:55] and one of them is different and how is
[1:17:57] it different those who've heard me
[1:18:00] before do you
[1:18:02] remember oh good nobody remembers that's
[1:18:05] great it's all fresh right a okay so one
[1:18:09] out of the three out of the four is
[1:18:12] Gentile or has a gentile connection
[1:18:16] that's really interesting because it's
[1:18:18] going to come up in the four gospels so
[1:18:20] let's look at this testimony of the
[1:18:23] prophets remember that's what it that's
[1:18:25] what we read if we want to have
[1:18:27] understanding we need to be able to go
[1:18:29] to the law and to the testimony so let's
[1:18:31] look at these uh four uh prophets please
[1:18:35] don't call them Major Prophets because
[1:18:38] that implies that the other ones are
[1:18:39] Minor Prophets and I defy you to go up
[1:18:42] to habac and call him a minor
[1:18:46] Prophet or
[1:18:49] Micah or some of those that you might
[1:18:51] not even have read their book and you'll
[1:18:53] be embarrassed when he asks you have you
[1:18:55] read my
[1:18:57] book we better make sure we've read his
[1:19:00] book so Daniel and you'll see the
[1:19:03] parentheses around there uh that Curly
[1:19:06] brackets means it's the one that's
[1:19:08] different and so out of this group of
[1:19:11] Isaiah Ezekiel Jeremiah and Daniel
[1:19:14] Daniel was the one that prophesied from
[1:19:17] a gentile Kingdom had the position of a
[1:19:20] gentile Ruler all right whereas the
[1:19:22] other of course were strictly Jewish or
[1:19:25] um either Israel or Judah prophets and
[1:19:28] so you can see right away we're getting
[1:19:30] this picture God's going to build this
[1:19:33] this uh this uh knowledge and
[1:19:37] understanding based on the
[1:19:39] prophets and there's going to be four of
[1:19:41] them and they're going to have the
[1:19:45] characteristics of the L oops of the
[1:19:47] lion the man the ox and the eagle but I
[1:19:50] don't have time to get into that now but
[1:19:52] if you want to do that for homework take
[1:19:54] those books and think about I'll give
[1:19:57] you one clue Jeremiah was known as the
[1:20:01] weeping prophet all right and he wrote
[1:20:04] the book
[1:20:06] of
[1:20:08] Lamentations all right so you can see
[1:20:10] how that would Place him in the ox
[1:20:13] category the Beast of Burden the the the
[1:20:17] sacrificial uh animal the one that works
[1:20:20] until it can't work anymore and and then
[1:20:23] gets roasted on a fire thanks very much
[1:20:26] no no putting out to pasture for a good
[1:20:29] uh healthy Ox right so that's Jeremiah
[1:20:33] now think about Isaiah and and I'll give
[1:20:36] you another clue Ezekiel how was he
[1:20:39] referred to what does God call him every
[1:20:42] time he wants to reveal something to
[1:20:45] Ezekiel thank you son of man how many
[1:20:48] times almost every time son of man son
[1:20:50] of man son of man son of man all right
[1:20:52] so you can see this was
[1:20:55] intentional and of course Daniel he's
[1:20:58] writing about Revelation right he's got
[1:21:01] that eagle anointing on him right to be
[1:21:04] able to see far all right have that
[1:21:07] eagle Insight so when we look back at
[1:21:10] Ezekiel 1:10 we find out that these
[1:21:13] cherub had the the these four faces and
[1:21:17] it was the lion the ox the man and the
[1:21:19] eagle so when we see this we're thinking
[1:21:21] hm there's there got to be something
[1:21:24] relevant about these four living
[1:21:26] creatures and we've got four gospels
[1:21:28] maybe they tie together so brother renom
[1:21:31] says did you think that God wouldn't put
[1:21:33] a guard around his word see if that Ox
[1:21:37] Lion Man Eagle isn't it still sitting at
[1:21:40] those Gates right here on Earth right
[1:21:42] now they're the four gospels so when we
[1:21:46] go back to Eden What's protecting the
[1:21:49] way it's those four gospels it's the
[1:21:52] Ministry of Christ we've got to go
[1:21:55] through Christ he's the door to get to
[1:21:57] that tree of life and the tree of life
[1:22:00] is Promised it's in Revelation he'll
[1:22:02] Grant to eat of the Tree of Life as one
[1:22:04] of the the gifts to an overcomer so when
[1:22:07] we get to Revelation now Revelation is
[1:22:09] all about symbols so we see that uh
[1:22:13] there were four living creatures four
[1:22:15] beasts there's a different word for bad
[1:22:18] beasts uh by the way uh in the in the
[1:22:21] Greek this is the the good beasts this
[1:22:24] is the one that translates as living
[1:22:25] creatures so there were four beasts or
[1:22:28] living creatures around the Throne all
[1:22:31] right in heaven that's what Daniel uh
[1:22:33] John was seeing in Revelation chapter 4
[1:22:37] and the first Beast was like a lion the
[1:22:39] second like a calf or an ox and the
[1:22:41] third had a face as a man and the fourth
[1:22:44] Beast was like a flying
[1:22:47] eagle so sometimes we see two different
[1:22:50] types of differences in the four so in
[1:22:54] this case the fourth um uh creature is a
[1:22:59] flying eagle leaves the ground so that
[1:23:02] would make him different from the other
[1:23:04] three but when we get to the gospels
[1:23:07] we'll find uh that it's a different uh
[1:23:10] uh one of those uh four living creatures
[1:23:14] that is
[1:23:16] different now we're going to um skip
[1:23:19] because this is really important if we
[1:23:23] know God's plan and how he's setting up
[1:23:28] the the protection the gateway to the
[1:23:32] Tree of Life guess who else knows
[1:23:34] it and we heard this the other day that
[1:23:37] Satan is going to try and deceive he's
[1:23:41] going to try and set up a different uh
[1:23:45] narrative a different story he's going
[1:23:48] to have a different interpretation of
[1:23:50] the facts all right this is his mission
[1:23:54] he's called the adversary Satan means
[1:23:56] adversary his job is to oppose God so if
[1:24:01] you're a heavyweight uh title uh um
[1:24:06] candidate you want to take on the
[1:24:08] heavyweight champion of the world and uh
[1:24:11] the fight is set for Las Vegas all right
[1:24:14] you're going to go to Las Vegas to go
[1:24:16] and uh challenge the champion you're not
[1:24:20] going to go to Miami if the fights in
[1:24:23] Las Vegas you've got to go where the
[1:24:26] champion is if you're going to contend
[1:24:29] with that champion if you're going to be
[1:24:31] an adversary you've got to be in the
[1:24:33] same
[1:24:35] ring that God's in and so guess where
[1:24:38] God is guess where the ring
[1:24:41] is all right don't be surprised big
[1:24:44] Target on our back all right he knows
[1:24:47] where God's operating and that's where
[1:24:49] he has to operate because that's his job
[1:24:52] he's the adversary he has to oppose
[1:24:54] somebody somewhere something and so
[1:24:57] Satan has his system at work again to
[1:25:01] get people to misbelieve and I like that
[1:25:03] not disbelief it's actually important
[1:25:06] that he says
[1:25:07] misbelief the word of God it's it's
[1:25:11] Satan's wrong way of
[1:25:13] worship all the way through scripture we
[1:25:17] know that Satan has tried to impose his
[1:25:21] worship
[1:25:22] on the people right from the Garden of
[1:25:25] Eden right from deceiving Eve not
[1:25:27] telling her that God didn't exist
[1:25:29] Satan's not an
[1:25:30] atheist I mean imagine how bad you have
[1:25:32] to be if you're not even like Satan
[1:25:35] anyway so Satan's not an atheist all
[1:25:38] right he believes in God all right um
[1:25:42] but he wants to worship God in his own
[1:25:45] way he doesn't want to follow God's
[1:25:47] provided way and that's how Satan's Eden
[1:25:51] came about now now I'm going to show you
[1:25:54] who those four Messengers are to Satan's
[1:25:57] Eden because he knows it needs to be
[1:25:59] four Messengers he knows that's the
[1:26:02] trick if you want to if you want to you
[1:26:04] know get a program going and you want to
[1:26:06] build something you got to have these
[1:26:08] four foundations to build on all right
[1:26:12] so it was Satan's wrong way of worship
[1:26:15] how successful has Satan been as we try
[1:26:19] and get through the year 2023 I put it
[1:26:22] to you he's been extremely successful
[1:26:25] sadly successful and not just in the
[1:26:28] violence that we see around the world
[1:26:30] but in the subtle ways in which he has
[1:26:33] influenced people to
[1:26:36] misbelieve and I've got three books that
[1:26:39] I've kind of grayed out because I don't
[1:26:40] want you to read them but there there're
[1:26:43] three
[1:26:44] books out of hundreds of stories from
[1:26:50] celebrities pastors musicians I'm
[1:26:53] thinking of Hillsong unfortunately all
[1:26:56] these major Ministries and the ones I
[1:27:00] looked at were not you know people never
[1:27:02] heard of that had turned their back on
[1:27:05] God and said we don't believe anymore
[1:27:09] we're not Christians and these were
[1:27:10] pastors these were evangelists these
[1:27:13] were people with mega
[1:27:15] churches and they came to the
[1:27:18] conclusion we don't like what we see now
[1:27:21] there's a reason that that happens and
[1:27:24] it happens because of what the influence
[1:27:28] they allowed now when God has an
[1:27:31] influence which is by his Spirit on his
[1:27:35] messenger for this day Satan's opposing
[1:27:38] that with everything that he has if you
[1:27:41] don't have the right
[1:27:43] picture that's why I think this study is
[1:27:45] so important if you don't have the right
[1:27:48] picture if you're not looking at that in
[1:27:49] the right way and Satan comes along with
[1:27:52] a a little different perspective how
[1:27:55] many times do you hear that and and
[1:27:57] think of the words we hear these days
[1:27:59] it's so
[1:28:01] frightening uh well that's your
[1:28:04] opinion or well you know I have to I
[1:28:08] have to do me you know I just learned
[1:28:12] that last weekend you do you boo so you
[1:28:17] do what you do but got nothing you know
[1:28:21] I'm not I don't agree with it but I'm
[1:28:23] not going to say anything so that's
[1:28:25] terrible you never want to say that when
[1:28:28] people say oh it's my truth it's like
[1:28:31] what did you franchise it I mean do you
[1:28:34] have a patent on that truth and what
[1:28:37] does truth mean anyway if there's if
[1:28:39] there's 10 of us and we each have our
[1:28:42] truth there's 10
[1:28:45] truths but there is only one
[1:28:48] truth for example I'm standing here this
[1:28:51] is my favorite one the people from line
[1:28:53] will remember this I'm here I'm standing
[1:28:55] here today this time that's the truth
[1:28:59] now if I wanted to make up something how
[1:29:02] many places could I say I
[1:29:05] am in the world and that would be my
[1:29:09] truth but it's not the truth the truth
[1:29:12] is I'm standing right here that's the
[1:29:14] only truth about where I'm standing
[1:29:16] right now amen so you see how important
[1:29:18] it is that we don't get sucked into this
[1:29:21] terminology
[1:29:22] especially when we know intuitively
[1:29:24] there's something wrong with my truth
[1:29:27] but we don't really understand what's so
[1:29:29] significant but when you see what
[1:29:31] happened to these poor
[1:29:33] fellows from all different walks of life
[1:29:37] prominent people that gave up their
[1:29:40] faith and why is it it's because they
[1:29:43] came under the wrong influence they came
[1:29:46] under the influence of Satan's four
[1:29:49] Messengers now I've been preaching this
[1:29:52] since the late
[1:29:53] 880s and I've been talking about these
[1:29:56] four guys since the late 80s and the
[1:29:59] strangest thing happened I was preaching
[1:30:01] for brother Jason uh in uh Buford and as
[1:30:05] I left uh went through the airport I
[1:30:08] looked at the news stand and there was a
[1:30:10] whole thing just covered with uh these
[1:30:14] special um magazines from us news and
[1:30:17] World Report and it's and it was called
[1:30:21] um three Minds that shaped the 20th
[1:30:25] century and
[1:30:28] I'm they stole that that's that's my
[1:30:31] stuff and so I had to buy it I've still
[1:30:34] got a couple by the way I bought those
[1:30:36] magazines I was like that's incredible
[1:30:39] now of course it was the 20th century so
[1:30:41] that didn't include Darwin but if you're
[1:30:43] going to talk about people who
[1:30:45] influenced uh the world for Satan you'd
[1:30:47] have to throw Darwin into that and so
[1:30:50] these were the four Messengers and it
[1:30:52] covered a variety of subjects philosophy
[1:30:55] science psychology economics politics
[1:30:57] education just about every field that
[1:31:00] you you can hardly study anything at
[1:31:02] University and not run into this uh
[1:31:06] these kind of uh influences all right so
[1:31:10] we again uh looking at the time H so the
[1:31:14] mind we haven't still haven't got to the
[1:31:15] four gospels so the minds that shaped
[1:31:19] Leo
[1:31:20] deia are that convinced them that they
[1:31:24] are
[1:31:26] poor wretched miserable blind and naked
[1:31:28] and don't know it something influenced
[1:31:31] them to think like that and it's these
[1:31:35] four guys Charles Darwin Carl Marx
[1:31:40] Sigman Freud and Albert Einstein and of
[1:31:43] those only Einstein kind of still
[1:31:47] retains something of a reputation the
[1:31:49] other three guys I'm just jumping ahead
[1:31:51] so sorry time is against us so these
[1:31:54] World Views that we have been influenced
[1:31:58] by and those poor Christians that
[1:32:00] couldn't hold on to their faith didn't
[1:32:01] have the keeping power they were coming
[1:32:04] under the influence of Satan's
[1:32:07] Messengers whether they knew it or not
[1:32:09] and you can ask anybody those four names
[1:32:12] that I just mentioned
[1:32:15] Darwin uh just trying to go in order uh
[1:32:17] Marx Freud and Einstein uh there's
[1:32:21] almost nobody that you can talk to that
[1:32:23] hasn't heard of those four guys all
[1:32:26] right and especially in education so
[1:32:29] Albert Einstein is a little bit
[1:32:31] different in this case he's one with the
[1:32:33] curly bracket uh for um for the reason
[1:32:38] that even though he wasn't a Christian
[1:32:40] he wasn't even a theist he was a deist
[1:32:43] uh deist means um it's like the god of
[1:32:46] Spinosa um the idea Einstein believed
[1:32:50] that God created the universe verse but
[1:32:52] he sort of wounded up like a clock and
[1:32:54] then left it to unwind so God doesn't
[1:32:57] interfere or intervene in the Affairs of
[1:33:00] people right he leaves it uh I suppose
[1:33:03] to the scientists um but um that was the
[1:33:06] way Einstein understood God which is at
[1:33:09] least a little bit different from the
[1:33:10] other three so these guys were
[1:33:13] discredited and one of the things that
[1:33:16] they did all of them was they refuted a
[1:33:20] Biblical basis
[1:33:22] for a worldview so Darwin uh wanted to
[1:33:26] create a story where there wasn't a
[1:33:30] Creator all right and that's where he
[1:33:32] came up with the idea of evolution so
[1:33:34] we'll just keep uh going so even though
[1:33:37] the founders the heads if you like have
[1:33:39] been loed off these these ideas these
[1:33:43] philosophies uh the monsters that they
[1:33:45] created live on and that's what you're
[1:33:49] running into if you're ever ever in any
[1:33:52] kind of an academic environment where
[1:33:54] you're not paying attention you'll
[1:33:56] actually see these things uh very
[1:34:00] clearly um one of them is um you've all
[1:34:04] heard of the playwright George Bernard
[1:34:06] Shaw um My Fair Lady right right so
[1:34:11] imagine my shock and horror when I
[1:34:14] discovered um who he was so these
[1:34:17] monsters based on secular
[1:34:20] humanism is
[1:34:22] idea is that man is the center of the
[1:34:24] universe we are masters of our destiny
[1:34:27] all right everything revolves around us
[1:34:29] and the way we've evolved as a society
[1:34:33] is to take care of number one that's
[1:34:37] that's the basic philosophy and so Carl
[1:34:40] Sean is f is famous for saying the
[1:34:43] cosmos is all there is and all there was
[1:34:48] or ever will be wow so so instead of
[1:34:52] that being Jesus the it's now the cosmos
[1:34:56] it's now the creation so they worship
[1:34:59] the creation instead of the Creator all
[1:35:03] right very scriptural statement Mr Sean
[1:35:06] Dr
[1:35:07] San so the law is our school Master to
[1:35:10] bring us to
[1:35:11] Faith and if we don't speak according to
[1:35:14] the law in the testimony there's no
[1:35:15] light in us so let's go back and look at
[1:35:17] the Tabernacle for a second brother
[1:35:19] Brenham talks about the four living
[1:35:21] creatures around the Tabernacle you can
[1:35:22] see I'm rushing and uh that's the lion
[1:35:25] on the east side um that was the tribe
[1:35:29] of Judah was the center of those three
[1:35:31] tribes and then you had Reuben who's the
[1:35:34] uh man uh on the uh let's see that would
[1:35:37] be uh East that would be North and and
[1:35:40] then you've got Zebulon that's the ox
[1:35:43] over on the west and then on the south
[1:35:45] you've got Dan and so that's the way
[1:35:48] they were arranged and what was in the
[1:35:51] center C of that
[1:35:53] Tabernacle or the heart of the
[1:35:55] Tabernacle or the primary object in the
[1:35:57] Tabernacle it was the 10 commandments it
[1:36:00] was the word of God that was in the Ark
[1:36:02] of the Covenant with that word in it
[1:36:05] that Ark had um had uh that uh um role
[1:36:11] of being where the shakana glory would
[1:36:13] come down and so if you're going to have
[1:36:16] God present you got to have the four
[1:36:18] living creatures so we're getting this
[1:36:21] right it's and it's there so we
[1:36:23] mentioned about God building on the four
[1:36:26] pillars of the four gospels where did we
[1:36:28] get that idea well when God was building
[1:36:30] his nation of Israel he started with
[1:36:33] four
[1:36:34] Patriarchs we all know Abraham Isaac the
[1:36:38] god of Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph
[1:36:42] now generally when we read it in the
[1:36:44] scripture only three are mentioned but
[1:36:47] we know now that Joseph was a patriarch
[1:36:51] because he didn't get a tribe he didn't
[1:36:53] get land his land went to his two sons
[1:36:56] same as Israel so that's what makes the
[1:36:58] patriarch it makes him one of the
[1:37:00] fathers of the 12 tribes cuz he had two
[1:37:03] tribes that uh were given land that were
[1:37:07] his sons so those are the four
[1:37:09] Foundation uh Stone Stones if you like
[1:37:12] that God was going to build the nation
[1:37:14] of Israel on and who's the odd man out
[1:37:18] it's Joseph again why is that because he
[1:37:21] had the same role that Daniel had he was
[1:37:24] married to a gentile he lived in a
[1:37:26] gentile Kingdom he was a ruler in a
[1:37:28] gentile Kingdom and so though he was a
[1:37:30] Jew his primary role in life his primary
[1:37:35] mission was in a gentile context so you
[1:37:38] see three Jews one Gentile three Jews
[1:37:41] one Gentile that's very interesting I
[1:37:43] wonder if we can make that work and then
[1:37:45] what did we build on those four
[1:37:47] Foundation pillars we built the 12
[1:37:51] tribes and that of course led to the
[1:37:54] nation of Israel so when God's going to
[1:37:58] build his church we said he is going to
[1:38:00] start with these four gospel pillars
[1:38:02] he's going to add the 12 apostles and
[1:38:05] then of course we know that we have
[1:38:07] these four living creatures we got to
[1:38:08] weave into the story somehow and you
[1:38:10] know what's really
[1:38:12] interesting this
[1:38:15] concept has been known in Christianity
[1:38:19] since uh the very earliest days I can't
[1:38:24] tell you the exact years of any of these
[1:38:27] um things but you can go to Europe go
[1:38:30] around Italy you'll see these things
[1:38:33] everywhere first time I saw it I was in
[1:38:35] a church in um I was a church in Germany
[1:38:40] uh cologne it was a big cathedral in
[1:38:42] Cologne and they had a cross hanging
[1:38:45] above it's a Lutheran church and they
[1:38:46] had a cross hanging above the the the
[1:38:49] the pulpit and it had four living
[1:38:53] creatures around uh the center and the
[1:38:56] center was a Bible so it's really
[1:38:59] interesting that this is a well-known
[1:39:01] concept and even Bibles that were made
[1:39:04] in those days were made with the four
[1:39:06] living creatures around Christ in the
[1:39:10] middle so this isn't new this is very
[1:39:12] well known so brother brandham says this
[1:39:14] in Revelation chapter 4 series The Acts
[1:39:17] of the Apostles were inside and these
[1:39:20] gospels are the frame work to hold it
[1:39:22] together and to protect it so just going
[1:39:24] back to the tree of life going back to
[1:39:27] the Garden of Eden going back to the
[1:39:29] pyramid it's the same story over and
[1:39:31] over again is that Christ is in the
[1:39:33] center with these four living creatures
[1:39:36] around and we see a beautiful picture of
[1:39:38] that in Revelation chter 4 now he says
[1:39:41] did you think that God put a guard
[1:39:43] around his word see if that Ox Lion Man
[1:39:47] Eagle isn't still sitting at those Gates
[1:39:49] right now here on Earth as we read
[1:39:52] earlier they're the gospels the four
[1:39:54] gospels see guarded on every side
[1:39:57] guarding this Holy Ghost Gospel that's
[1:40:00] why there's
[1:40:02] four so we can stop now 12:41 so I told
[1:40:06] you to be short but if I stop now I'm
[1:40:09] going to sing so I think I should keep
[1:40:12] going so it's God guarding his
[1:40:19] word
[1:40:21] now think about that
[1:40:24] God you would think his word would be
[1:40:28] able to take care of itself of course it
[1:40:31] can but that's not the pattern the
[1:40:33] pattern is God's going to have his
[1:40:37] spirit in four different character
[1:40:40] characteristics of these four living
[1:40:42] creatures guarding his own word
[1:40:46] protecting the way of the tree of life
[1:40:50] and it's not going to be by happen
[1:40:52] stance or by accident or by any other
[1:40:55] method that we find our way to the tree
[1:40:58] of life it's going to be because God
[1:41:00] allowed it because he's the one who set
[1:41:02] up the framework to protect that word
[1:41:06] and so when we see people not
[1:41:08] understanding scripture they're not
[1:41:10] ordained to understand scripture and uh
[1:41:13] I've left all that out of the study just
[1:41:16] because of the time so when we see Jesus
[1:41:18] the word we're always going to see the
[1:41:20] these four living creatures and the lion
[1:41:23] represents the king the ox the servant
[1:41:25] the man the humanity and the eagle the
[1:41:28] spirit so let's look at the four gospels
[1:41:31] then the lion the
[1:41:33] ox H he's the one with the curly
[1:41:36] brackets huh man that's Luke and Eagle
[1:41:39] why is Luke the odd man out
[1:41:42] here because he was a gentile
[1:41:45] unbelievable very
[1:41:47] strange I didn't understand this when I
[1:41:49] was a child I was like what
[1:41:52] bad Gentiles dogs what's he doing
[1:41:54] writing one of the the gospels
[1:41:57] absolutely essential that he was there
[1:42:00] to write that because it would have
[1:42:02] broken every shadow from the Old
[1:42:05] Testament because there was always a
[1:42:07] gentile
[1:42:09] representation all the way through the
[1:42:11] Old Testament we've seen it over and
[1:42:14] over again so when we look at our lives
[1:42:16] and we wonder how did I get here by
[1:42:19] absolute divine Providence God intended
[1:42:23] us to be here he intended there to be a
[1:42:26] gentile church and is going to be
[1:42:29] without spot and without blemish a
[1:42:31] glorious church and it doesn't matter
[1:42:33] what Satan says and it doesn't matter
[1:42:35] how many messenges he sends to distort
[1:42:39] the word and to get people to misbelieve
[1:42:41] and how many Christians give up their
[1:42:44] faith we're going to be there because
[1:42:47] God intended it and he's protecting
[1:42:51] the word in us we'll get to that and
[1:42:55] this is especially for brother Brandon
[1:42:57] because uh he's going to enjoy this part
[1:43:00] all right so how many soldiers stood
[1:43:03] around the cross when Jesus was
[1:43:06] crucified now we all know about when
[1:43:08] they cost lots for his outer garment all
[1:43:12] right but how many soldiers were
[1:43:14] actually
[1:43:15] there there were four soldiers CU it
[1:43:18] says and made four parts and to every
[1:43:20] every Soldier apart so there could only
[1:43:24] be Four soldiers there couldn't be six
[1:43:28] soldiers they couldn't be a platoon
[1:43:30] there couldn't be two I mean how many
[1:43:32] people do you need to guard a guy nailed
[1:43:35] to a
[1:43:35] cross all right really how many gospels
[1:43:40] do you
[1:43:41] need wouldn't one be sufficient two
[1:43:45] Two's A Witness but
[1:43:49] four Overkill
[1:43:51] uh-uh no it's a pattern it's a principle
[1:43:55] precept upon precept line upon line here
[1:43:58] a little there a little and if we have
[1:44:00] the picture and it's the right picture
[1:44:03] brother Adam says we're reading between
[1:44:05] the lines make sure it's also on the
[1:44:07] lines if it's the right picture it has
[1:44:09] to follow all the way through scripture
[1:44:12] Genesis to
[1:44:15] Revelation praise God so now I'm going
[1:44:19] to take a little step on the Wild Side
[1:44:22] here this
[1:44:25] is not in the
[1:44:27] message on just letting you know however
[1:44:32] I believe it's consistent with the
[1:44:34] principle and the picture I'm going to
[1:44:36] tell you a story about Noah Noah went
[1:44:40] and got the blueprints for an ark God
[1:44:43] told him the length the
[1:44:44] breadth how many windows whatever and he
[1:44:47] told him exactly how to build the ark if
[1:44:50] many of you have made the unfortunate
[1:44:52] pilgrimage down to the the ark
[1:44:56] experience which is all young Earth it's
[1:44:59] all 24 days of creation scary talk about
[1:45:03] influence anyway but if you've had the
[1:45:06] experience you've seen how massive it is
[1:45:10] now Noah could not build that on his own
[1:45:13] he needed his sons at least and whoever
[1:45:16] else he got so what did Noah do with the
[1:45:19] blueprints that God gave gave him he
[1:45:21] shared them with his son
[1:45:24] Sons at least he said look boys gather
[1:45:28] around got his stick drew some things in
[1:45:32] the dirt whatever they did back then it
[1:45:34] was a civilization advance so maybe they
[1:45:37] had a plotter anyway and uh he he prints
[1:45:41] out the plans and he says now this is
[1:45:44] what God told me it's going to be this
[1:45:45] long it's going to be this wide and and
[1:45:48] I saw that there were this many uh ribs
[1:45:51] you the Keel was like this and then
[1:45:53] there was all this many ribs in it and
[1:45:56] uh these are the planks that have to go
[1:45:57] on and then we have to fill those planks
[1:46:00] in with pitch do you guys get it he says
[1:46:03] okay go go
[1:46:04] ahead so what they're doing is they're
[1:46:08] taking Moses's
[1:46:10] vision and they're adding the planks to
[1:46:15] the shape of the arc they're adding
[1:46:19] they're filling in the blanks all right
[1:46:23] of how these sides of the arc are going
[1:46:27] to be made so Noah has the job of
[1:46:30] putting down the Keel putting in the
[1:46:32] ribs that establishes the length and the
[1:46:34] width and now the Suns can come and nail
[1:46:36] on the planks so sometimes that's what
[1:46:39] the picture does for us we can come
[1:46:42] along and without contradicting
[1:46:44] scripture we can actually look at
[1:46:46] something and say hm I wonder if this
[1:46:49] could be cons
[1:46:50] consistent with the picture that we've
[1:46:53] been given and so that's what I'm going
[1:46:54] to do so the first time the law was
[1:46:58] given the Ten Commandments it was
[1:47:01] written by the Finger of God on tablets
[1:47:04] of
[1:47:05] stone and then Moses has the dubious
[1:47:07] distinction of being the first person to
[1:47:09] break all Ten Commandments and then he
[1:47:12] goes back up the
[1:47:14] mountain and now this time he has to
[1:47:16] make his own tablets first time God made
[1:47:19] them and once once again God writes his
[1:47:22] word this is um the second edition of
[1:47:25] The Ten Commandments all right and God
[1:47:29] writes with his finger on these tablets
[1:47:32] of stone the second
[1:47:34] time so that's the Old Testament this is
[1:47:37] the picture that we're using to inform
[1:47:40] us of something that Jesus did because
[1:47:43] the law is our school Master to bring us
[1:47:45] to Christ so when the woman's caught in
[1:47:48] adultery they tempted him
[1:47:51] but Jesus stooped down and with his
[1:47:54] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[1:47:56] heard them
[1:47:57] not the implication is this had nothing
[1:48:00] to do with what they were telling him we
[1:48:04] try and make an implication there but it
[1:48:06] seems that Jesus is ignoring them and
[1:48:09] he's writing with his finger in the
[1:48:10] ground now brother Brenham says a
[1:48:12] wonderful thing I don't know if I have
[1:48:13] the quote he says the reason we don't
[1:48:15] know what Jesus wrote is because Jesus
[1:48:19] didn't have to write the word he was the
[1:48:21] word number one and number two he was
[1:48:24] going to write the
[1:48:26] word and the and that the Believers were
[1:48:29] going to be the written Epistles read of
[1:48:32] all men it wasn't that Jesus would write
[1:48:34] a book he was going to write a book in
[1:48:36] the lives of the Believers so it's a
[1:48:38] lovely thought all right so Jesus Stoops
[1:48:41] down the first time and he writes then
[1:48:43] he looks up it's got nothing to do with
[1:48:46] what he wrote and he said he is without
[1:48:48] sin among you cost the first stone which
[1:48:50] sounds like he could have just said that
[1:48:52] from the beginning because obviously
[1:48:55] that would be true right that nobody
[1:48:57] would be without sin and then it says he
[1:48:59] stooped down again and for the second
[1:49:02] time as the sun he's now writing with
[1:49:05] his finger and he's not writing in stone
[1:49:08] he's writing in the sand he's writing in
[1:49:11] ground which is very fine
[1:49:14] Stone so it's like the same thing right
[1:49:17] as the father he writes on Stone as the
[1:49:19] son he writes in the
[1:49:22] ground and brother Bram says yeah I got
[1:49:24] the quote as far as we know he never
[1:49:25] wrote but one time and that was in the
[1:49:28] sand then erased it just like the Ten
[1:49:30] Commandments were erased probably
[1:49:33] afterwards because he was the word of
[1:49:36] course we don't need so many books when
[1:49:39] you become a written Epistle of God so
[1:49:42] it's a lovely concept so where is God
[1:49:46] writing with his holy spirit
[1:49:49] today he's writing it on the fleshy
[1:49:51] tables of our
[1:49:53] heart and thy word have i hidden my
[1:49:56] heart that I might not sin against you
[1:49:58] if it's on tablets of stone that can get
[1:50:00] smashed if it's in the ground in the
[1:50:02] dust it can be wiped out but if it's
[1:50:05] written in our heart it's there for
[1:50:09] eternity then we have the the the word
[1:50:14] as part of who we are so 2 Corinthians
[1:50:18] 3:3 for as much as you manifestly
[1:50:21] declared to be the Epistle of Christ as
[1:50:23] brother R said the the written Epistles
[1:50:25] ministered by US Written not with ink
[1:50:28] but with the spirit of the Living God
[1:50:30] not in the tables of stone but in the
[1:50:33] fleshy tables of the heart so I don't
[1:50:37] think it's too much of a stretch right I
[1:50:39] think we can kind of feel like not such
[1:50:42] thin eyes right so Psalm 119:1 so famous
[1:50:46] Thy word have i hidden my heart that I
[1:50:48] might not sin against thee so there's
[1:50:50] the word written on the fleshy tables of
[1:50:53] our heart so we need to uh do a little
[1:50:55] lesson here on the heart to see how it
[1:50:58] works and I promise you we will get to
[1:51:01] those four gospels um by the
[1:51:04] end uh I think we going to get to them
[1:51:07] now actually so you see the little dark
[1:51:10] red arrows coming in on the left hand
[1:51:12] side of the picture that's the old blood
[1:51:16] coming back from the body used up all
[1:51:18] the oxygens taken out of it all the
[1:51:20] nutrients and this is the old used up
[1:51:22] blood this is coming in from the body
[1:51:26] all right coming into the heart so we
[1:51:29] might say that's coming in from the Old
[1:51:31] Testament so then it goes into that
[1:51:34] first uh chamber uh
[1:51:37] at not Atrium Is It Anyway and uh then
[1:51:42] from there it goes to the second chamber
[1:51:45] which is the pump all right and uh
[1:51:48] that's called a ventricle the left
[1:51:50] ventricle in fact and from there it gets
[1:51:52] pumped out to the lungs that's where
[1:51:55] it's going to pick up the oxygen now it
[1:51:57] goes from dark red to bright red because
[1:51:59] now it's got full of oxygen and the
[1:52:02] lifegiving power is back in the blood
[1:52:05] and so it comes back into the heart into
[1:52:07] that third chamber and then it goes to
[1:52:11] the fourth chamber what is the fourth
[1:52:14] chamber that's the right ventricle very
[1:52:18] original names and it's a great big pump
[1:52:21] you see how big it is it's huge right
[1:52:23] it's a great big pump because its job is
[1:52:26] to pump all that oxygen to the body so
[1:52:29] if we're looking at the four gospels as
[1:52:33] the heart that's where God was going to
[1:52:34] write his word as in the chambers of our
[1:52:37] heart well if the word of God is in our
[1:52:39] heart there has to be four chambers
[1:52:41] right four four living creatures we got
[1:52:43] to see the ox the man and the Eagle
[1:52:44] right we got to see them all so let's
[1:52:46] see what happens so in the first chamber
[1:52:49] the old blood blood coming in from the
[1:52:50] Old Testament we read in Matthew chap 1
[1:52:54] the entry into this heart and we read
[1:52:59] about Jesus being the son of David the
[1:53:03] son of Abraham why is that important
[1:53:06] it's because it traces gen Jesus
[1:53:08] genealogy all the way back to the first
[1:53:10] mention of kings that was in Abraham
[1:53:14] story and David was the most famous King
[1:53:17] so the kingly attributes that are
[1:53:19] represented by Matthew or that Abraham
[1:53:22] is the first mention of Kings David is
[1:53:23] the most famous King Matthew was a tax
[1:53:26] collector very unusual occupation you
[1:53:28] would imagine for somebody that you know
[1:53:30] we're going to count on for Spiritual
[1:53:33] Insight don't think everybody likes the
[1:53:35] tax collector all right and who collects
[1:53:39] taxes a king collects taxes or in this
[1:53:44] case an emperor and where do we read the
[1:53:47] story of the wise men going to do
[1:53:49] Nativity scen here soon all right we
[1:53:52] don't have the wise men and the
[1:53:53] shepherds in the same scene why not cuz
[1:53:55] they weren't there at the same time but
[1:53:58] Matthew is looking at Jesus as the king
[1:54:02] and who were the wise men bringing gifts
[1:54:05] to to a King all right the Shepherds
[1:54:08] weren't bringing gifts all right to the
[1:54:11] young baby the little baby but the wise
[1:54:15] men were bringing gifts to a young child
[1:54:18] because they saw him as a king where is
[1:54:21] he that is born King of the Jews so
[1:54:23] that's all in Matthew so now the blood
[1:54:26] goes
[1:54:27] into the second chamber now chamber one
[1:54:30] is just receiving blood it's not a pump
[1:54:34] so the the valve opens and it goes into
[1:54:37] the second chamber so Matthew
[1:54:41] Mark well guess what no genealogy in
[1:54:44] mark because there's no blood coming in
[1:54:48] from the outside there is internal so
[1:54:51] there's no genealogy and Mark represents
[1:54:54] Jesus constantly as a servant and he's
[1:54:57] got him working if you look at the time
[1:55:01] a number of times at the word
[1:55:02] straightway or immediately is used in
[1:55:04] The Book of Mark it's 40 times he's got
[1:55:08] Jesus going from Miracle to Miracle to
[1:55:10] Miracle to Miracle to Miracle
[1:55:12] straightway straightway immediately
[1:55:13] straightway just like you would treat a
[1:55:16] servant all right and then what do you
[1:55:19] do with the animal the beautiful Ox
[1:55:22] that's worked his whole life for you
[1:55:26] when he gets too old to work you don't
[1:55:28] put them out to
[1:55:31] pasture you sacrifice him and so Mark
[1:55:35] having work Jesus for almost half the CH
[1:55:38] half the book then spends the second
[1:55:41] half dealing with the
[1:55:43] passion describing how he was going to
[1:55:45] be
[1:55:47] sacrificed isn't that incredible just
[1:55:50] like you would think an ox would be
[1:55:52] treated now we have Luke ah curly
[1:55:55] brackets we know something's different
[1:55:57] about Luke well first of all the
[1:55:59] genealogy appears in Luke chapter
[1:56:01] 3 all right just purely coincidence
[1:56:05] right and this is the blood coming back
[1:56:08] from the lungs with oxygen in it so what
[1:56:13] is the Luke the doctor interested in
[1:56:17] he's interested in Jesus as a man man so
[1:56:20] what's his genealogy trace Jesus back
[1:56:23] to Jesus Christ the son of Adam right
[1:56:28] the Son of God right at the end of that
[1:56:31] chapter he says Jesus Christ the son of
[1:56:34] I'm sorry he talks about all the
[1:56:36] genealogy sorry down and then he says
[1:56:38] the son of Adam the Son of God so he
[1:56:41] traces it back to the first man and
[1:56:44] who's there to witness the birth it's
[1:56:46] the Shepherds because this is the human
[1:56:50] side this isn't the kingly side and what
[1:56:53] do we read about in this uh in this CH
[1:56:57] uh in Luke's gospel we read about
[1:57:00] Jesus's Boyhood we read about how he
[1:57:02] waxed in wisdom and in strength and in
[1:57:04] knowledge of the word of God those 11
[1:57:07] characteristics that's in the Book of
[1:57:09] Luke why because he's interested in how
[1:57:12] Jesus developed as a Man how he matured
[1:57:15] as a man isn't that
[1:57:18] incredible so as a doctor he'd be
[1:57:20] interested in Jesus human qualities so
[1:57:23] that was that was that uh that um uh
[1:57:29] third uh chamber now the blood's going
[1:57:32] to flow into the Book of John so no
[1:57:37] genealogy in
[1:57:39] John very spiritual characteristics of
[1:57:42] Jesus are described I and the father are
[1:57:44] one if you've seen me you've seen the
[1:57:46] father and many many many others
[1:57:50] and uh gospel starts off with Jesus as
[1:57:54] the word the Word was God and the Word
[1:57:58] was made flesh so it goes all the way
[1:58:01] back into the mind of God that's some
[1:58:04] genealogy but it's not human genealogy
[1:58:09] all right this is spiritually where
[1:58:12] Jesus uh characteristics came from and
[1:58:16] so this gospel is really astonishing
[1:58:20] because it's this great big pump and its
[1:58:24] job is to pump out of that right
[1:58:26] ventricle into the whole body that's a
[1:58:31] that's a big job especially in my case
[1:58:33] so I'm not alone
[1:58:36] so what's so special about John's
[1:58:41] gospel it's known as the great
[1:58:44] unfinished book in the
[1:58:48] Bible if you read the last verse of John
[1:58:51] Chap 21:2 and there are also many other
[1:58:55] things which Jesus did the which if they
[1:58:57] should be written everyone I suppose
[1:58:59] that even the world itself could not
[1:59:01] contain the books that should be
[1:59:04] written that's
[1:59:06] us so that's starts in the book of Acts
[1:59:10] and it continues all the way through to
[1:59:12] the catching away of the church that God
[1:59:15] is writing his gospel in the Gentiles
[1:59:20] all right and so that's why John is the
[1:59:23] eagle gospel and guess what because it's
[1:59:26] unfinished it goes all the way through
[1:59:28] to the eagle
[1:59:31] age yeah it's just
[1:59:34] coincidence and any case we don't really
[1:59:36] have a a
[1:59:39] context but we do because we have the
[1:59:41] principle of what God is going to do
[1:59:44] with these four gospels and so this this
[1:59:48] Blood now now flows out of the gospels
[1:59:51] into the book of Acts as brother renam
[1:59:53] was describing earlier now who are these
[1:59:56] um fellows that I talked about earlier
[1:59:58] Satan's Messengers what's special about
[2:00:03] them one of them's an odd man
[2:00:06] out if you've heard me before don't
[2:00:09] shout it out it's got to be a
[2:00:11] surprise and I'm just about
[2:00:18] finished
[2:00:20] so KL
[2:00:22] Marx was a
[2:00:25] Jew Sigman Freud was a Jew Einstein was
[2:00:29] a Jew but Darwin was a
[2:00:33] gentile now I have done this exercise
[2:00:36] for 40 years just randomly asking people
[2:00:40] in a Bible study context who are the
[2:00:43] four people you think have most affected
[2:00:46] our world
[2:00:47] view just just give me the names
[2:00:53] 99.9% one time somebody mentioned n or
[2:00:57] something that nobody knows but it was
[2:01:01] these four people every time because
[2:01:05] they've had that much influence on the
[2:01:08] 20th century and so we need to be
[2:01:12] cautious about what we hear what we
[2:01:15] listen to what we watch what we read and
[2:01:17] to see how much of of these guys are
[2:01:21] influencing what's being written now
[2:01:23] it's easy when it's Darwin right because
[2:01:25] they just say Evolution all the time
[2:01:27] doesn't matter whe they're talking about
[2:01:30] space there's no evolution in space I
[2:01:32] hope you know that evolution is only
[2:01:33] biology you know nothing you do with
[2:01:36] space but they talk about the evolution
[2:01:38] all right because that's like a key word
[2:01:40] so the question is do you have a few
[2:01:42] more minutes it's 1:00 can we just take
[2:01:44] a few more
[2:01:46] seconds all right I don't know what's
[2:01:48] coming up so it'll be interesting to see
[2:01:50] what I put in after
[2:01:53] this that's right I want you to finish
[2:01:56] with this because I wanted to wrap this
[2:01:59] up this is Satan's Eden brother random
[2:02:01] preached the sermon the conflict between
[2:02:03] God and
[2:02:04] Satan it's actually 62 it's actually a
[2:02:07] really important
[2:02:09] sermon he says the word don't won't mix
[2:02:12] with any modern Theory you can't have a
[2:02:14] theory and have the word you've got to
[2:02:17] have the word or the theory
[2:02:20] now which are you going to
[2:02:22] believe we need to have an absolute by
[2:02:25] the way how many people say oh yeah
[2:02:28] that's a good theory no that's not a
[2:02:30] theory that's the
[2:02:32] truth your evolution is a theory that
[2:02:36] you call the truth but this is the real
[2:02:38] truth it's not a theory this isn't my
[2:02:41] opinion this is the word of God and
[2:02:43] we've got to be able to take that stand
[2:02:47] all right but Satan is more than a match
[2:02:49] for us we know that we know that Satan
[2:02:51] is way more than a match for any human
[2:02:53] being the brightest angel in heaven
[2:02:56] goodness don't you never try to do it
[2:02:59] with your wisdom to out modom you just
[2:03:02] can't do it and how did he build Satan's
[2:03:07] Eden he built it by
[2:03:10] civilization but did you know that
[2:03:13] Civilization Science Education and the
[2:03:15] things that we cherish so great today is
[2:03:17] the very instrument of Satan now
[2:03:21] please
[2:03:22] don't understand misunderstand that
[2:03:25] brother ROM's against uh education or
[2:03:28] anything like that obviously he was not
[2:03:31] all right and you'd have to be head in
[2:03:33] the sand to know that he that he was uh
[2:03:36] that that he wasn't against it but what
[2:03:38] he's against is the philosophies that
[2:03:41] come through those channels and so you
[2:03:45] have to be careful you have to be on
[2:03:47] your God you have to hold those
[2:03:49] principles in in the foreground you have
[2:03:52] to know what the word of God says you
[2:03:54] know how have to be able to defend what
[2:03:57] you believe because you are going to be
[2:03:59] challenged that's Satan's job so if
[2:04:01] you're going to be challenged you might
[2:04:02] as well be prepared otherwise you're
[2:04:05] going to wind up like those guys who
[2:04:06] wrote those books and say well I just
[2:04:08] gave up because I couldn't answer their
[2:04:10] questions you know if there's a Bible
[2:04:12] question there is a Bible answer every
[2:04:16] time I've been doing this a long time
[2:04:18] I've never been ashamed I've spoken to
[2:04:22] at least a dozen highly qualified
[2:04:24] theologians and I've never had to change
[2:04:26] anything that I believe that I know from
[2:04:29] the message because it's the truth I
[2:04:32] don't it and and brother random says in
[2:04:33] the church AG well the truth needs no
[2:04:35] defense it stands on its own and so I
[2:04:39] know that I can stand against a
[2:04:44] challenge by the enemy not with my word
[2:04:46] but just as Jesus did with his word amen
[2:04:50] but you have to know that and you have
[2:04:51] to know how it goes together and
[2:04:53] actually I invite you if if anybody's
[2:04:55] thinking of college or thinking or
[2:04:57] having had trouble at college or
[2:04:59] whatever please come and see me I've got
[2:05:01] some amazing material to uh to
[2:05:04] apologetic material that um can prepare
[2:05:07] you uh for uh the challenge of the world
[2:05:10] view that we have as Christians and I
[2:05:12] tell you what the challenge is enormous
[2:05:15] so brother brandham says this in 1965 he
[2:05:17] says what does communism lay on what's
[2:05:21] the underpinning Science Education
[2:05:24] that's their God see Satan that's what
[2:05:27] he introduced to Eve that's what they're
[2:05:31] still holding to say civilization is not
[2:05:35] of God for let me show you in this
[2:05:37] civilization the more civilized we get
[2:05:39] as we work through science we're always
[2:05:41] killing ourselves and this civilization
[2:05:44] has built up to its Pinnacle now and
[2:05:46] we've got death in The Civil ization
[2:05:49] even today even more so today we've got
[2:05:54] sin in the civilization we've got
[2:05:56] sickness in the
[2:05:58] civilization that can't be of
[2:06:01] God and so we have a responsibility to
[2:06:05] live in this world we need a certain
[2:06:07] amount of Education we need a certain
[2:06:09] amount of wisdom to deal with the things
[2:06:11] of this world but I tell you if ever
[2:06:13] there was an age that we have to be
[2:06:15] prepared it's this age and you have to
[2:06:17] be prepared not just with the knowledge
[2:06:19] of a couple of scriptures I mean that's
[2:06:22] all wonderful especially in Sunday
[2:06:23] school we learn a few scriptures but you
[2:06:26] have to know the principles you have to
[2:06:28] know the picture behind those scriptures
[2:06:31] why are there four gospels that should
[2:06:33] be a question we could answer any day of
[2:06:36] the week now we know why there's four
[2:06:38] gospels there had to be four as a
[2:06:40] framework around the word there were
[2:06:43] even four you know why did Jesus die
[2:06:45] when Jesus died why did it go dark
[2:06:49] remember it went dark stars came out why
[2:06:53] anybody
[2:06:57] know well that's good so he was the Son
[2:07:01] of God the son of righteousness so when
[2:07:04] the Sun goes out you'd expect the
[2:07:06] natural sun to go out as well but
[2:07:09] there's another reason the law teaches
[2:07:13] us that when they sacrificed the lamb it
[2:07:17] was at night
[2:07:19] in the evening time so if Jesus is the
[2:07:22] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[2:07:24] the world he can't be dying in broad
[2:07:28] daylight because that wouldn't fit the
[2:07:30] pattern now why was it dark in the
[2:07:33] evening time is why was the lamb slain
[2:07:35] in the evening time is the real question
[2:07:38] not why was it dark when Jesus died
[2:07:40] that's the Fulfillment it was dark in
[2:07:42] the evening time when the lamb
[2:07:46] died because when Jesus died there was
[2:07:49] the sun was going to go out you see
[2:07:52] that's the Shadow the reality is Jesus
[2:07:55] died when it was dark so when they were
[2:07:58] going to kill the lamb as a picture of
[2:08:02] what was going to happen it had to be
[2:08:04] evening time so sometimes we get that
[2:08:07] backwards right the shadow is cost from
[2:08:09] the Old Testament down onto the the New
[2:08:12] Testament down onto the Old Testament so
[2:08:14] that's why when we look at the shadow we
[2:08:17] understand the New Testament better
[2:08:19] praise God all right civilization that
[2:08:23] can't be of
[2:08:25] God so brother
[2:08:27] brandom is the voice to oppose Satan's
[2:08:34] Messengers you see how that works so at
[2:08:37] the same time that Satan's raising up
[2:08:40] his four Messengers God's got his voice
[2:08:44] on the earth at the same time and he's
[2:08:47] the one who's actually setting us on the
[2:08:50] right course he's the one who's helping
[2:08:53] us to find the way of the Tree of Life
[2:08:57] Satan's trying to distort that picture
[2:09:00] brother brandom says
[2:09:02] misbelieve all right because he doesn't
[2:09:05] want us on that path he doesn't want us
[2:09:08] to find that PA and but God has his
[2:09:11] provision God just like the bitter
[2:09:13] Waters of Mara before they ever got
[2:09:16] there God had planted a tree probably 30
[2:09:19] years before they got there and when
[2:09:21] they had to get lifegiving water from
[2:09:24] those bitter Waters God said chop down
[2:09:27] that tree I already provided for you 30
[2:09:29] years ago I planted that tree for you
[2:09:33] and God already had this ministry of
[2:09:35] brother Brenham in mind we know from the
[2:09:37] scripture and why is it there because
[2:09:39] there were going to be these four
[2:09:40] fellows that would come along with their
[2:09:43] warped ideas and they were going to be
[2:09:46] an influence on this age but God has his
[2:09:49] influence now you can see we ignore the
[2:09:54] message to our
[2:09:56] Peril because then what are we going to
[2:09:58] use to defend ourselves against those
[2:10:01] four
[2:10:02] Messengers because we're going to be
[2:10:05] unarmed if we don't have what God's
[2:10:08] provided for us in this day so that's
[2:10:10] where I want you to end thank you for
[2:10:12] your time God bless you and uh uh who's
[2:10:14] coming up brother Gideon all right I
[2:10:17] really appreciate as the musicians make
[2:10:19] their way let's
[2:10:31] stand sometimes it has to be long to be
[2:10:35] good I just trust it was good amen God
[2:10:38] bless
[2:10:40] [Applause]
[2:10:42] you amen let's bow our heads our
[2:10:46] heavenly father we just we love your
[2:10:48] your word so much Lord we love the fact
[2:10:50] that you trust us with your word to to
[2:10:52] put it in our hearts Lord to make us
[2:10:54] your
[2:10:55] temples temples of the Living God and
[2:10:58] Lord that you even made this heart in
[2:11:02] such a way Lord that it would be the
[2:11:03] perfect place for you to write your word
[2:11:07] with the finger of your Holy Spirit Lord
[2:11:10] never to be
[2:11:11] erased Lord we just pray that you would
[2:11:14] give us the courage Lord to know know
[2:11:18] who we are Christ in us the hope of
[2:11:22] glory your word shed abroad in our
[2:11:25] hearts Lord and Lord may we be those
[2:11:28] living Epistles R of all men Lord that
[2:11:31] Lord we could share that
[2:11:35] lifegiving power that you've shared with
[2:11:38] us Lord that we in turn could share it
[2:11:40] with others Heavenly Father
[2:11:43] we we love your word we love your people
[2:11:46] of the word we we love the fact that we
[2:11:49] have this in common that we can so
[2:11:52] easily connect with one another because
[2:11:55] of your spirit on your word so Lord we
[2:11:59] just pray that you would let this word
[2:12:01] sink in Lord just all the implications
[2:12:04] of the Precision of your word the way it
[2:12:07] all fits together so beautifully the
[2:12:09] patterns and the
[2:12:11] pictures and the fact Lord that now when
[2:12:13] we look at the scripture we're not just
[2:12:15] looking at isolated verses but we're
[2:12:18] looking at them in the
[2:12:20] context of a principle that you've
[2:12:23] revealed to us in this day so
[2:12:27] father bless each
[2:12:29] one give healing and virtue to each one
[2:12:33] that needs it Lord and Lord thank you
[2:12:35] for giving me the strength even
[2:12:38] today to be able to stand and minister
[2:12:42] to your people Lord I Thank you for the
[2:12:44] pull I thank you for the
[2:12:46] receptiveness and and I thank you for
[2:12:48] the receptive hearts Lord that are
[2:12:51] thirsty for your word we just commit all
