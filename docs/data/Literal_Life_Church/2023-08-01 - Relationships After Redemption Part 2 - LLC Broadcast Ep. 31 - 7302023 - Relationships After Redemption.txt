cause I've seen too much now I can't deny I know please come through every single time from the beginning [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the darkness [Music] [Music] so your secrets [Music] Acts chapter 2 and verse 41 it says then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods imparted them to all men as every man had need notice the the Holy Ghost working in the church one of the things that brought out is they became very sensitive and aware of another man's needs in other words the selfishness had gone away and they became become aware of the needs within their own body and other needs and begin to do things to try to help in those needs whatever they could and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house because there was no church buildings at that time for the Believers they broke bread from house to house and did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such it should be saved sounds all positive to me can you say mom and then Acts chapter 4 I think I was reading as well Acts chapter 4 and verse 32 verses 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake with the word the word of God with boldness and The Malt of the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that all the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all so this as we look at these things in the book of Acts we see the first account of relationships not not only with God relationship with God and with others and you know from the series that everything that that was lost in the Garden of Eden now has been restored and man has been restored back that everything he lost besides his new body he's received everything back again and so now we have this Oneness with God now that they hadn't had for all these thousands of years now they've come back into it by the Holy Spirit coming in them they've become one it wasn't a religion it wasn't rules it wasn't a duty it wasn't some new religion that come along it was completely separate than religion it was an internal work of the Holy Spirit coming in the soul the control tower and he himself came in so that by one Spirit they became one with God again so that's totally different than a mental exercise or a denominator Nation or a Duty or a code of ethics to live by it goes beyond any of that and should never be associated with that it's the power of God coming into the vigil and he at that moment comes in Oneness with God and there's no man can take that away and so I want to emphasize tonight relationship over rules relationship over uh religion of course and so they had come after being redeemed into a real relationship with God here that they hadn't experienced since the Garden of Eden quite this way people have been anointed prophets had come the people had been blessed well there's some healed there's many powerful things that took place but they had never had relationship like this with God for thousands of years until this Upper Room when all of a sudden everything that was lost from Adam and Eve come back again that's a pretty powerful thing so in the book of Acts that we read here this kind of the first window that we have of the book of Acts church and what it looked like and I'm emphasizing the relationship part but there are many things that God did in the book of Acts and all of them none of them are to be cast aside we're we're we should have the word working in our lives and the spirit work in our lives that even personally we should be able to write a book of Acts in our lives it may not be as big as this book maybe yours is but nevertheless there should be acts of God in your life that you could write a story at the end of all this and if there was a future if there was a future generation they could read your story and and have a book of Acts from your life in purpose in life in spirit and envision everything had been restored back from Eden again except a new body they were in every way purpose Vision life and spirit they were every way restored back to the Garden of Eden again in spirit and so it's the same today and we should know then that it did not take very long uh until the Antichrist Spirit began to come into those days of the book of Acts and that shouldn't surprise us because Satan entered the Oneness with Adam and Eve right away and destroyed their Oneness so now when you have the same Oneness it shouldn't be a surprise that Satan comes in in the early church and begins to bring that Antichrist spirit and begins to do and one way we know it's the Antichrist spirit it's just working against what's happening in the church it's doing something opposite can you say Amen it's presenting a different a different way to God than coming through the Holy Ghost and that's how we know that the Antichrist spirit is working is that when you see this love when you see this Fellowship when you see this coronia when you see this this pureness this this guileless atmosphere going on with this this uh speaking in uh tongues that uh they heard them in their own language when you see the spirit making them like drunk men when you see all of this going on then then Satan is coming on the scene because his agenda is to stop this and present another gospel so we know if you have good things going on in church and the spirit is moving and God's doing things and there's Harmony and Oneness and love get ready for the Antichrist spirit amen you're going to fight it can you say man you're going to fight this it's going to be a battle when they come into the promised land that's when their battles began and people say it's not fair it's not fair that all these things are happening to me in all this battle but you what you should say is if you're having all these trials then you're probably possessing some land you're probably gaining ground because as you gain more ground the battle intensifies from your enemy more trials no more pressures because he can't stand Oneness and here in the early church he starts to turn against it and starts to come in an antichrist Spirit we're not going to talk a lot about that but it is relevant to say this that when you see the good things of God coming like they did at the book of Acts get ready for the Antichrist Spirit to come real close and to work against it when it manifests everything contrary to this new relationship the Antichrist spirit will manifest everything contrary to this new relationship they had this new Oneness with God is what was produced in not only Miracles and signs and wonders but it produced the right relationship with God the right relationship with Believers the right relationship with families the relationship with God is what they had first it was a perfect relation Jack relationship back with him again and I want to just say now this relationship in the book of Acts that had had not been there for thousands of years and now they come out of the upper room with this this this my spirit this connection with God that they never had since the book of Eden when this began this relationship was before they had a church to Worship in can I say it relationship is before attending church because these guys didn't have a church to go to you ought to praise the Lord tonight you have a church to go to you ought to go to it can you say mine but you see now this this relationship didn't require to have a church building this relationship in the book of Acts was before Worship in church it was before church order came Paul brought Church order later so they had relationship before they had Church order oh can I get an amen tonight I'm not dumping out Church order I'm glad for it but I'm telling you the book of Acts had relationship before they had Church order it was about relationship and that's it a simple relationship by spirit and Oneness with God before any of that was said before any of it they had relationship before Paul broke into the mystery of Christ in the book of Ephesians before Paul broke down the Old Testament shadows and explored the Christ revealed in the Old Testament before the riches of the Revelation the theophany bodies when he said if this Earthly Tabernacle be destroyed we have one waiting on the other side before all of those Revelations the thing before those Revelations was relationship with God by the Holy Ghost so I tell you today what's more important what's most important all that's important but relationship is more important didn't Paul say though I understand all Mysteries though I understand how to give my body to be burned and I feed the poor and I give and I do all those things and I understand all the Mysteries and yet I can still be locking the main thing somebody say praise the Lord so now before uh before Paul preached all these things before the riches of the Revelation before all this had to be a relationship first by the Holy Ghost and all of that was important but never to be put before relationship in Simplicity before the book of Acts Church could produce anything that they did they each one had to come into relationship by the Oneness of the spirit as a matter of fact you could never produce the book of Acts church and what they manifested without the relationship first now how does Satan duplicate the signs the Wonders the Miracles which he can can you say amen he can work through their things and and and you see then then to me I've always viewed it this way is Satan is watching what's going on because remember this is the first time for thousands of years he's seen this type of spirit in the people like this and he's just an observer he's not a Creator and he always tries to duplicate or or or to mess up what God is doing or to try to give an alternate alternative route than the Holy Ghost so he's watching them come out of the room they're acting like drunk men I mean he remembered David and David got happened he danced and before the ark coming in so he knows some happy people that got happy about the Lord but never was it quite like this and then he watched them hearing the other nations hearing them in their own language as they glorified God so Satan every time he observes things and he was there observing it all every time he's there he's always thinking how can I counterfeit this how can I bring uh something that's similar to it that can distract the people from the real thing what is it all about keeping men and women from the real thing have them dress upright or have them go to church or have them burn a candle all of religious systems Satan has been behind the systems not the people but behind systems to misdirect the people away from one thing the relationship of the Holy Ghost in the upper room people we don't want to present a code we don't want to say if you just do this if you're just dressed this way if you act this way if you just come to church and be here every service then you're okay we don't want to deceive people like that we want the Holy Spirit to come down and he makes a personal connection with them and they turn their lives over and there's a relationship when they walk out the door they may not be dressing all right yet they might understand everything brother Paul preached but they've come into a relationship with God he can talk to them he can they can talk back to him there's a relationship started and that's what we want not just some phony something but a real they've entered into I'm not just talking to God through my parents now or saying prayers when I talk to them I know that I'm in relationship with him by the Holy Ghost if we skip over the relationship part looking at the relationship of a simple redeemed people in the book of Acts as I said before church order before all these things and but then we see Paul says later in second Corinthians 11 verse 3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so now the early church comes out of the upper room we go through the book of Acts and it's early now in the second book of Corinthians that we see Paul sharing his fear and his burden as the answer Christ comes in what would be his work to complicate things to grab ahold of the do's and don'ts and for people to skip the relationship and grab a hold of the do's and don'ts and complicate salvation and complicate the Simplicity of relationship and come he's in he said who's who will be doing it the same serpent that talked to Eve would complicate and take them from the Simplicity of this Oneness and this relationship with God men preachers would be used of Satan to complicate the Simplicity in Jesus Christ and did Satan do it yes he did yes he did messing with the people's minds and to me we're we're reading the Simplicity of a relationship with Jesus Christ in the early church it's got in Simplicity it's the Simplicity of Christ and that spoils down to a true Holy Ghost Oneness relationship with God yourself I fear less by any means some some Force begins to take you away from that Simplicity because it all starts with a relationship and it should end with relationships Simplicity in Christ is not dumping out revelation and further Revelation Simplicity of Christ is not stopping to grow to full knowledge of the word of God can you say Amen but it's knowing the one in me and in you that can never change whether I can understand it all or not when I'm into relationship with God and I know that I know that I know that I have it and God doesn't say you're going to lose it if you don't understand everything by next week I'm going to give you a year and if you don't catch all of these Seven Seals you're done in my relationship that's not God at all if you have a Oneness Holy Ghost relationship listen you the devil cannot take that away from you nothing can take that away from you you may sit in services and say I I don't have a clue what that guy is saying and then everyone said you catch that Revelation then it grows then it grows and it is and that's all fine but newer converts sometimes they may not have a clue but there's something deeper working in them and they say I don't know a lot but I know I come into a relationship with God I know I got the Holy Spirit I know I got the a matter down the inside and the mind is saying I don't mind the thing I don't understand but the soul is saying Amen to the word of God because you can't be saying amen from the soul unless you got the amen or down there Moses my servant is dead and he makes a personal connection with Joshua and says as I was in Moses I will be with you and it's a personal relationship with Joshua it was going to be I'm just going to try to duplicate what Moses did that wasn't it God said I'll be with you like I was with Moses because God doesn't say I'm going to go through just I'm going to go through Moses still even though he's dead I'm going to keep using him and you're just supposed to no no no no God's about relationship I want a personal relationship with Joshua and those that are going in the Promised Land I want to tell you that every place your foot your foot not Moses foot every foot your foot shall go it'll be possession to you and you'll take the left acts 15 verse 1. so now and I want to talk about the positive relationship in the book of Acts with God and with one another we're going to get to a lot of that but I just want to stop and look at this Antichrist spirit that enters the book of Acts right away through men and it says and certain men everybody remember that now certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now they're coming to new Christians that had come to the message of the hour circumcision had had been lost because God was bringing the true circumcision of the soul of the Holy Ghost they didn't understand that they came from being Pharisees but they believed and came in to the message certain men it didn't come from Satan on a cloud somewhere it was through preachers that actually traveled down to these new converts and said you know what praise the Lord you came to God and you're feeling this uh great Revival and God's changed you but except you be circumcised after the matter of Moses you cannot be saved these are guys that come in to the message of the hour and they're bringing their past up and misleading these new converts when therefore Moses Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and bartimus and certain other of them should go to Jerusalem under the apostles and Elders about this question and being brought on their way by the church they passed through fanis and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received at the church and of the Apostles and Elders all the work Paul and Barnabas did it's a great work of the Lord going to the Gentiles and they the church received them the church Elders received them they declared all things that God had done with them but there arose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees now I want you to notice this now certain of the sect of Pharisees which believed so already in the church you have those that don't have the Holy Ghost that carried over and it says they believed and that's why just believing from the intellect is not good enough believing from the heart is what you need and so these men come into the church and they were a sect of the Pharisees which was the religion they came from in the past when you come to the Lord you've got to be washed of all those former things can you say amen and say Lord what is your truth what is being what is being held back from me my brother and sister who may be listening here I don't say this to be mean but you better look at your life because those systems can hold you back like these and you hold on to old traditions that have been taught to you by a denomination and it may not be the truth and so these certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed so they were amongst the crowd of the new message Believers saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and Elders came together to consider this matter and when there had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them men and Brethren you know how God that a good while ago God made Choice Among Us that the Gentiles by the mouth should hear the word of the Gospel when believed and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us Brothers You've got to admit without your help they received the same Holy Ghost the Gentiles did is what we got you know what he's saying that's the end of the story you don't complicate it any more than that there's no dispute there's no arguing there's no putting circumcision on this because what's the proof they come into relationship without any of you I wonder if that's the way Peter said it that day probably not hey you guys it's a settled argument they've got the same thing we've got and you didn't have to they didn't have to be circumcised to get it so what are you trying to teach these new converts and God with no other Hearts better than witness giving the Holy Ghost as he did unto us and put no difference between us and Them purifying their hearts by faith now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to Bear but we believe that through the grace of the through what through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved come into relationship then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnos and Paul declaring that What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them and after they held their peace James uh answered saying men and brother and hearken unto me and so Peter says it to him it wasn't poem bars Peter stood behind him uh uh uh James who was the Elder of the church there in Jerusalem he backed him up and says we are not going to put anything extra on these new converts because here listen if they need to come to anything they got the same holy ghost that we did and the same Holy Ghost will bring us into what we need by grace instead of you taking some old tradition and requirement how many knows that they did it to the Galatians the whole book of Galatians in your Bible is dedicated to men coming in and requiring circumcision of new Gentiles the Galatians they fell for it and Paul wrote in the Galatians his brothers why are you listening to these men why are you being moved from the Liberty God has brought you into you know what he said who hath Bewitched you you Galatians who did it Pharisees men that came to the message from Pharisees but they didn't get a true birth so they're bringing all their stuff to these new converts and Paul said they've Bewitched you they've cast a spell on you Stand Fast in the Liberty that you once had through Paul and through Paul's letters and through the word the Galatians finally come out and they probably saying I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about you amen It's All About You Jesus let God do it his own way get in the spirit get free in the spirit let the Revelation come stimulation of Revelation you don't have to work it up you don't have to have a pep rally to work the people into motion preach the word preach the Revelation and the stimulation of revelation will make some people cry and weep make some people shout the Isles we actually will shout and scream can you say Amen some of them just sit and stand in all but it's the holy spirit let the Holy Spirit do it the way he wants to do it they want it to be wherever he was and consistently be there that's the relationship of the New Testament Church that's that's relationship of the redeemed thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by
