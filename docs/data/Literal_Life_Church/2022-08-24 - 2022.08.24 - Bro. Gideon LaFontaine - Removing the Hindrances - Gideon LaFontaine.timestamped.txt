[4:51] the world and this is the victory
[4:54] that overcometh the world even our faith

[5:05] amen
[5:06] let's uh let's just bow our heads

[5:09] asking god to lead us in the right
[5:11] direction tonight your heavenly father
[5:13] lord
[5:14] lord i come with my vessel lord tonight
[5:16] lord jesus god
[5:18] wanting you to speak lord not my words
[5:20] lord jesus
[5:22] nothing that i can do god you would you
[5:24] would take over lord jesus and god let
[5:27] this not just be about me lord but god
[5:30] we're in this lord jesus to be fed so we

[5:46] bring forth fruit good fruit lord jesus
[5:49] that's my one desire lord jesus just um
[5:52] bless it lord we give it to you in jesus
[5:54] name amen praise the lord
[5:58] praise god
[5:59] amen you may be seated tonight
[6:04] so i mean this kind of goes along with
[6:07] my whole testimony as far as wanting
[6:09] backbone amen how many want more
[6:11] backbone do you want backbone amen to
[6:13] fend off the enemy amen and all of his
[6:15] tricks amen
[6:17] that's my that's a true desire i feel
[6:19] like i can relate so much to
[6:21] gideon in the bible because uh gideon he
[6:25] felt incapable and he felt like he
[6:27] couldn't do much all of his brothers
[6:29] were around him and
[6:31] he uh he was the small one probably he
[6:34] didn't he was just awkward probably
[6:36] didn't know what to do but
[6:37] amen god can use anything amen amen god
[6:40] can use god can use you amen if you're
[6:43] available amen it took them a little bit
[6:45] amen to finally catch what god was
[6:47] trying to do through him
[6:49] but when he did amen the enemy fell amen
[6:53] enemy came down so
[6:55] so this is a question i asked tonight do
[6:57] you want god to fill every fiber of your
[7:01] being that's my first question tonight
[7:03] do you want him to fill every fiber
[7:06] seems like that's been
[7:08] going on in my heart for a couple weeks
[7:11] as the ministers of speaking you kind of
[7:13] hear it on repeat do god wants to fill
[7:17] every fiber of your being amen that's
[7:20] every door in your life amen he wants to
[7:22] fill every single door amen
[7:25] and
[7:26] there's there's things um
[7:28] so so what i what i say is check your
[7:31] heart see what your true desire is what
[7:33] do you really want i mean you can look
[7:35] up through all your life and say
[7:37] you know there's things i want but what
[7:39] is my true desire what's my goal what's
[7:42] what what do i want right
[7:44] so true desires um
[7:47] check your heart and see if your true
[7:48] desire is for god to feel you completely
[7:52] as we know from the message if there's a
[7:54] call to the deep there's a there's a
[7:56] response from that deep amen
[7:58] amen there's something there that's
[8:00] always going to respond so
[8:02] if you're in a state of stagnant tonight
[8:04] amen there's a deep there's something
[8:06] calling you higher amen out of that amen
[8:09] there's a song that um me and dad know
[8:12] from the gaither vocal band you may have
[8:14] heard it but i'd like to read the lyrics
[8:16] tonight just so we kind of
[8:18] kind of catch my thought here tonight
[8:21] it says waiting there for 38 years
[8:24] it's called the song is called do you
[8:26] want to be well
[8:27] waiting there for 38 years cried so long
[8:31] he ran out of tears
[8:33] just a worn out man looking for a
[8:35] healing hand
[8:37] then one day his chance came along a
[8:39] healing man
[8:40] who who can make him strong
[8:43] and he
[8:44] and he caught his eyes but his question
[8:47] took him by surprise
[8:49] this was his question do you want to be
[8:51] well
[8:52] do you really want to be well
[8:54] are you willing to take up your mat and
[8:56] help yourself
[8:58] do you want to be free really want to be
[9:00] free
[9:01] if you want to be healed and whole
[9:03] you've got to want to be well amen
[9:06] amen every tr have you ever tried to fix
[9:09] yourself and every every time you got up
[9:12] you fell
[9:13] and you wallowed there drowning in your
[9:15] own despair
[9:17] have you gotten used to the chains
[9:19] are you so attached to the pain
[9:22] are you afraid to part
[9:24] then ask them then ask the man for a
[9:27] brand new heart
[9:30] do you want to be well it goes to the
[9:31] chorus it says
[9:33] the bridge that goes there's a better
[9:34] life waiting just for you there's
[9:36] endless open spaces in
[9:38] in the sun hallelujah i just i really
[9:42] want to hit that home tonight do you
[9:43] want to be well just
[9:45] we find ourselves i i'm kind of getting
[9:47] to that story uh tonight of aiken
[9:50] hopefully we can kind of go through
[9:54] joshua chapter 7 tonight but
[9:58] i remember brother isaiah a few weeks
[10:00] ago talking about getting down to
[10:02] business with god amen do you really
[10:04] want god to do something in your life
[10:06] amen do you want change amen
[10:09] do you amen he's uh he's seeking you
[10:12] more than anything he wants that for you
[10:15] amen he wants he there's always see with
[10:17] god god's limitless right
[10:19] he's always has a higher calling for you
[10:22] amen there's never a place where god
[10:24] says all right you're good where you are
[10:27] amen as as when we say that to
[10:29] ourselves that's when we're in the wrong
[10:31] you believe that
[10:33] amen that's when we kind of build up the
[10:35] self-righteousness this pride right
[10:38] that's not what god's looking for i
[10:39] don't believe
[10:40] amen god has never failed to meet a
[10:43] sincere soul that wants change
[10:46] healing deliverance
[10:48] or the holy ghost we have hack we have
[10:50] access to it all
[10:52] there's a bomb in gilead and god is
[10:54] saying
[10:55] balls in your court now
[10:58] balls in your court
[10:59] will you claim the promises
[11:03] he's saying
[11:04] he's asking why he he asked we have all
[11:07] that we need all that we have and
[11:09] especially in this day with the last
[11:10] day's message we have all that we need
[11:13] in the word he's revealed it to us and
[11:16] he asked why why won't you grab it why
[11:22] see i've been there personally
[11:24] when i accept a habit in my life that's
[11:26] probably innocent per se
[11:29] but maybe it's not maybe it's not an
[11:31] innocent habit
[11:33] i uh but because we're human we tend to
[11:36] get this self-righteousness or this
[11:38] pride like we can handle it right
[11:41] and a lot of times this this comes
[11:44] even before even after a big victory in
[11:46] our lives amen
[11:48] pride is probably one of the biggest
[11:50] pitfalls we can get after a big victory
[11:52] amen because that's the where the devil
[11:54] can he can um he can
[11:58] basically you get this pride and you god
[12:00] god will show you
[12:02] god will reveal it to you that you're
[12:04] nothing and he's something amen
[12:07] so i i've personally been there and uh
[12:10] even you know just these couple weeks
[12:12] with things that are in my life and i
[12:14] want to get personal with you tonight
[12:16] just about you know habits on you know
[12:18] this phone here right
[12:21] right here habits that i feel like
[12:24] let's say for me personally and i want
[12:26] to get real down to earth here that
[12:28] like i i would go to bed right and this
[12:31] would be this would have to be playing
[12:33] some sort of video it wasn't
[12:36] anything that was probably damaging my
[12:38] soul or anything but it was just it was
[12:42] just um empty right it but it was
[12:45] something it was something to me like i
[12:46] had i needed that to go to bed and in
[12:49] this generation you'd be surprised that
[12:51] in this day and age i go i i uh i work
[12:55] with nurses
[12:56] and
[12:58] they they tell me that um
[13:00] in this generation i've heard pretty
[13:03] crazy statistics on this as well that
[13:05] they um
[13:07] there's there's this high um ranking of
[13:10] people in the u.s that go to bed to uh
[13:13] true crime right
[13:15] they go to bed to this um
[13:18] they find peace
[13:20] in
[13:21] crazy craziness
[13:24] this is a high statistics i wish i had
[13:26] the high the the statistics on it but
[13:28] even when i'm you know in the in the
[13:31] work here um
[13:32] like there was you know there's a
[13:35] co-worker that was saying it's like i
[13:36] can't get to bed without true crime
[13:39] they can't find peace without it that's
[13:42] delusional
[13:43] that is insanity do you realize where
[13:45] we're living in right now and the only
[13:47] thing the devil wants us to do
[13:49] is be right in there where our minds are
[13:51] mush right and our minds aren't mush by
[13:54] the blood of the lamb our minds are not
[13:56] mush all right
[13:58] praise the lord hallelujah
[14:00] amen he's giving us a new mind amen he
[14:04] made us new creatures in christ praise
[14:06] god that gets me excited hallelujah
[14:09] thank you lord thank you lord
[14:13] so he says balls in your court will you
[14:15] claim your promises
[14:17] i perse
[14:18] um
[14:20] we are human and we tend to get
[14:21] self-righteous just like we can handle
[14:23] it
[14:24] and the devil can use that as a
[14:26] hindrance because as human nature we are
[14:29] habitual right
[14:31] so uh the title for my sermon tonight is
[14:34] removing the hindrances
[14:36] removing the hindrances
[14:39] amen
[14:40] there's nothing more than god wants is
[14:43] for you to live an overcoming life amen
[14:46] amen every single day that's that's why
[14:48] paul says we must die daily amen so he
[14:51] can take over god can take over and
[14:53] that's where the real overcomer is is
[14:55] christ our mighty rock amen praise the
[14:58] lord
[14:59] and if you could pull up that first um
[15:02] if you could pull up that first one
[15:04] there just read this along with me this
[15:06] is the only long quote i have i know
[15:08] sometimes
[15:09] long quotes can be uh you know hard to
[15:12] stay with me but just just bear with me
[15:14] here
[15:15] like in the scriptures found in the book
[15:17] of second kings
[15:19] the first chapter ahab the unruly king
[15:21] of the samaria had died
[15:24] and his son had taken his place
[15:26] and he was an ungodly man just like his
[15:29] father hezekiah
[15:30] and one day when he was walking in his
[15:33] in his porch he fell through the lattice
[15:35] falling to the ground he injured himself
[15:38] and some disease set into his body
[15:40] and then he called
[15:42] called two of his soldiers the temple
[15:43] guards and sent them upon to ukraine
[15:46] ekkran to the temple of biazab and the
[15:50] god of that country which was
[15:52] which was a devil god something like a
[15:55] fortune
[15:56] fortune tellers and he said go and
[15:58] inquire by beelzebub but be uh
[16:02] by the prophets of baal ziba i'm going
[16:04] to come off of this bet
[16:07] i'm am i going to come off of this bed
[16:09] or not so he's asking the god
[16:12] and as they started the angel of the
[16:13] lord come to elijah the tishbite the
[16:16] true prophet of god and told him
[16:18] what was going on and said go stand in
[16:21] the way and and head these men off
[16:24] and he said
[16:25] he said to them it's not there
[16:28] a god is there not a god in israel isn't
[16:30] there a prophet in israel that you can't
[16:33] consult
[16:34] about these matters but do
[16:36] but do you go to beelzebub
[16:39] so we have a re we have a source a man a
[16:41] true source amen but you see what's
[16:43] happening is this this king
[16:46] this king is uh going to he doesn't feel
[16:48] confident in the in the word right he
[16:50] doesn't feel confident in the in the
[16:52] word for his day
[16:53] he uh he's going to something different
[16:56] right
[16:57] because
[16:58] okay we'll get to it and it wasn't
[17:00] because there wasn't a god in israel
[17:02] neither was it because there wasn't a
[17:03] prophet in israel but it was the king's
[17:06] stubbornness and his hatred for the true
[17:08] prophet of israel and this is worse come
[17:11] to worst but i pray if you're at this
[17:13] place tonight cry out to god cry out to
[17:16] god it wasn't because of that god hadn't
[17:20] supplied the remedy god always had has a
[17:22] remedy amen amen
[17:25] it wasn't because that was that he was
[17:27] too stubborn and he didn't like elijah
[17:29] because elijah had predicted all the
[17:32] evil that happened to his father
[17:34] therefore
[17:36] he had created listen to this
[17:39] therefore he had created by the habits
[17:42] of his home to hate the man of god
[17:45] to just despise him and reject him
[17:48] i don't know if you understand how
[17:51] how
[17:51] powerful habits are
[17:54] in our life and here i'm talking about
[17:56] things that i went through as far as
[17:58] thinking that you know these innocent
[18:00] things like a video that i'd watch on my
[18:03] phone aren't affecting me right it's the
[18:05] habits that are destroying me and they
[18:07] can lead to this right
[18:09] one i love this one
[18:12] compromise at a time leads to spiritual
[18:15] death right
[18:17] amen and if you reject the true and
[18:19] living god there's only one other thing
[18:21] you can go go to
[18:23] that's an untrue god or a false god see
[18:26] there's no confidence you find yourself
[18:28] in such a place of of numbness spiritual
[18:31] amnesia that you can't look to god you
[18:33] can't find him anywhere because you're
[18:35] feeling unworthy
[18:38] there's only one other thing you can go
[18:40] to that's an untrue god or a false god
[18:42] right you're finding an artificial
[18:44] satisfaction
[18:46] and it will never last amen that's why
[18:48] people in this world they only can find
[18:50] satisfaction in drinking or smoking
[18:52] right they can only find it there
[18:54] i mean even even at work you know they
[18:58] they talk about
[18:59] you know people that they they like put
[19:01] people down for being alcoholics but
[19:04] then at the same time they they're there
[19:06] themselves they're like but i can't put
[19:08] down the only thing that gives me life
[19:10] and joy in my life they'll talk about
[19:13] that that's why they go to it because
[19:14] you know that's all they have right
[19:17] um it's an untrue false god if this if
[19:20] this people of this nation refuses to
[19:23] serve the true and living god there's
[19:25] only one thing left for them to accept
[19:27] that's a false god next one if there's a
[19:29] true religion of jehovah the people
[19:31] refuse to walk in that religious order
[19:34] then there's only one thing for them to
[19:36] do that's fine the other fault false way
[19:39] to walk in it and how foolish it seems
[19:41] to the mind
[19:43] to the reasonable mind oh my
[19:45] that could reason out
[19:47] why take something false when you can
[19:50] have something true
[19:52] why would man go after the things of the
[19:55] world to satisfy the thirst that's in
[19:57] him when god created that thirst
[20:00] alleluia he's created that thirst for
[20:02] him to thirst after god amen there's
[20:04] something in you before you even thought
[20:07] amen that there was polling and the
[20:09] devil all he wants to do is deceive you
[20:12] amen right from the get-go and he wants
[20:14] to give you something artificial amen
[20:16] aren't you glad we don't we don't have
[20:18] the artificial we have the true
[20:20] alleluia
[20:21] thank you god
[20:23] why would he satisfy it with
[20:25] drinking and gambling and crowsing when
[20:27] there's a peace
[20:29] in joy and longsuffering and goodness
[20:31] and mercy in god oh aren't you glad we
[20:35] have access to all that thank you lord
[20:37] jesus we have access to all of it
[20:40] praise the lord so that was my long
[20:42] quote but i'd like to i'd like for kind
[20:44] of us to do a bible study tonight i'd
[20:47] like to just go through joshua 7 tonight
[20:49] so if you've got your bibles let's go
[20:51] through joshua 7 because it talks about
[20:54] i don't know if you've ever heard them
[20:55] before
[20:57] but it's about brother aiken
[21:00] how many know of brother aiken
[21:02] you guys know of him all right well
[21:05] we'll talk about it
[21:07] amen joshua seven
[21:11] hopefully i don't
[21:13] i should be looking at my time here
[21:14] because i don't all right we're good we
[21:17] are doing good
[21:19] amen yeah the other night we i think it
[21:21] was five five and a half hours we were
[21:23] in service and it felt like maybe 30
[21:25] minutes
[21:27] so i mean god's time well god doesn't
[21:29] have time amen praise the lord
[21:32] but we will be mindful we know we know
[21:34] uh this is mid-week so
[21:37] so
[21:38] joshua seven
[21:39] so
[21:40] talking about aiken
[21:42] so this is this is just kind of a
[21:44] backstory this is right after jericho
[21:46] right one of their um
[21:48] i mean
[21:49] historic victories right
[21:51] um
[21:52] for the children of israel god fight uh
[21:54] god fought pretty much for them
[21:57] all they did was obey the word amen
[22:00] praise the lord god fought over the city
[22:02] because israel obeyed the word of the
[22:05] word of the lord living according to all
[22:07] of his word nothing
[22:10] nothing can stand up in our way if we do
[22:12] that amen praise the lord we can look at
[22:15] israel and obviously israel is a type of
[22:17] the believer right we all believe that
[22:20] amen recognize
[22:23] so we must recognize this is within
[22:26] right we're recognizing this is all
[22:28] happening within the joshua commission
[22:30] right and israel um
[22:33] is is over jordan right they come into i
[22:35] believe with the joshua commission it's
[22:37] um the holy ghost commission right
[22:40] in uh in canaan right uh the believer
[22:44] this is uh i love this the believer must
[22:46] fight once once we've crossed over
[22:49] jordan right the believer must fight for
[22:52] every inch of land he gets right so your
[22:55] your battle really just started when
[22:57] that holy ghost comes in right
[23:00] hey man you're a sojourner now you don't
[23:01] want any things of the world amen you're
[23:03] a soldier a pilgrim amen
[23:05] we're of another kingdom amen praise the
[23:08] lord
[23:09] hallelujah
[23:11] so we have
[23:14] this holy ghost
[23:16] this holy ghost walk is no picnic by
[23:18] revelation god is revealing the hidden
[23:20] things that satan has covered through
[23:22] the church ages and by god's grace we
[23:25] will overcome and have our full
[23:27] inheritance amen
[23:29] he is restored amen he's restored
[23:31] everything praise the lord so we'll get
[23:34] right into this
[23:36] amen
[23:38] so follow along with me but the children
[23:40] of israel committed a trespass
[23:43] in the accursed thing
[23:45] for aiken
[23:47] the son of karmi and the son of zabdi
[23:51] and the son of zerai
[23:54] and the tribe of judah
[23:56] took of the accursed thing and the anger
[23:58] of the lord was kindled against the
[24:01] children of israel right so we find that
[24:03] aiken here
[24:05] has um
[24:06] i mean you probably know the story but
[24:09] um
[24:10] we find the aiken there's it's it's
[24:12] affecting all of israel right and how
[24:14] how how uh things are going as far as
[24:16] the the battles so um and joshua sent
[24:19] men from jericho to ai
[24:22] which is uh besides
[24:25] bethavin
[24:26] on the east side of bethel and spake
[24:28] unto them saying go up and view the
[24:30] country and the men went up and view
[24:32] viewed ai and they returned to joshua
[24:34] and said unto him let not all the people
[24:37] go up but let about two or three
[24:39] thousand men go up and smite ai and make
[24:42] not all the people to labor that they're
[24:46] for the for they are but a few so there
[24:49] went up there of the people about three
[24:51] thousand men and they fled before the
[24:53] men of ai in the men of a i smote them
[24:56] about thirty and six men for they uh for
[24:59] they chased
[25:01] off
[25:02] them from before the gate and unto uh
[25:05] shiburum i'm like my dad i have trouble
[25:08] with these these names
[25:10] um
[25:11] and smote them in in um going down
[25:15] wherefore the hearts of the people
[25:16] melted and became his water so what
[25:18] you're seeing here
[25:20] is um
[25:21] israel's wondering what's happening
[25:23] right
[25:24] they don't know what's going on because
[25:26] they have the promise right they have
[25:28] what they need but something's going on
[25:29] they're they're wondering what's going
[25:31] on we we can't we can't beat this enemy
[25:33] right and they actually they they don't
[25:35] bring their full army they they're kind
[25:37] of approaching it half-heartedly too
[25:40] um but
[25:41] and joshua ran his clothes and fell to
[25:44] the earth upon his face before the ark
[25:46] of the lord unto the evening tide
[25:49] and the elders of israel and put dust
[25:51] upon their heads
[25:52] and
[25:53] joshua said alas o lord god
[25:56] wherefore thou ha thou at all brought
[25:59] this people over jordan to deliver us
[26:02] into the hand of the amorites to destroy
[26:04] us
[26:05] so you see uh joshua crying out to god
[26:08] here um
[26:10] i
[26:11] i mean from his from his words he's
[26:14] he's really broken about this
[26:16] would um would to god we we had been
[26:18] content and dwell on the other side of
[26:20] george jordan
[26:22] oh lord what shall i say when israel
[26:24] turneth their backs before their enemies
[26:28] so
[26:28] you see you see joshua crying out and i
[26:31] i'm seeing this kind of as
[26:34] joshua joshua's soul
[26:37] he's crying out to god wondering what's
[26:39] wrong right
[26:41] for them for the
[26:43] canaanites and all the inhabitants of
[26:45] the land shall hear of it and shall
[26:49] pretty much round about us they come all
[26:53] around us and in it and shall
[26:55] cut off our name from the earth and what
[26:58] will thou do unto the great name
[27:00] and i love this what the lord says
[27:03] the lord's like stop wait
[27:05] he says stop
[27:06] he says the lord says unto joshua get
[27:08] thee up stop
[27:10] stop wondering what's going on there's
[27:12] sin in the camp right
[27:14] wherefore elias thou this upon this face
[27:16] so he's saying
[27:17] he's like
[27:18] you kind of need to grow up here there's
[27:21] there's some there's something going on
[27:23] but um there
[27:25] i'm getting i'm getting to it but there
[27:27] there needs to be
[27:28] there needs to be um
[27:30] a cut or a
[27:32] as my title is a remover of hindrance
[27:35] right
[27:36] israel had sinned and they have also
[27:39] transgressed my covenant which i
[27:41] commanded them for they have even taken
[27:43] of the accursed thing and have also
[27:45] stolen and assembled also and they have
[27:48] put it even among their own stuff
[27:51] therefore the children of israel could
[27:53] not stand before the enemies but turn
[27:56] their backs before their
[27:58] enemies because they were a curse
[28:00] neither will i be with you any more
[28:03] except you destroy the curse from among
[28:05] you
[28:06] so i even for my personal testimony you
[28:09] can find yourself in a place of
[28:12] um wondering why you don't feel like
[28:14] you're getting the breakthrough or
[28:16] you're you you don't know why what's
[28:18] going on but there's things in your life
[28:20] that you won't give up right you won't
[28:23] give up those hindrances that you won't
[28:25] give up because um
[28:28] because you know you think you can
[28:30] handle it right amen
[28:34] so um and he says this is what the lord
[28:37] says up sanctify the people and say
[28:39] sanctify yourselves
[28:41] against tomorrow for thus saith the lord
[28:44] god of israel there is an this is bold
[28:47] see this is the thing with god people
[28:49] think and this is the deception of this
[28:52] new modern church that god is
[28:54] so loving and he there's no judgment but
[28:57] this this is god right here right
[28:59] he says there's an accursed thing in the
[29:01] midst of thee oh israel thou can't not
[29:04] stand before thine enemies until you
[29:06] take away the accursed thing
[29:09] from among you right
[29:12] so
[29:13] you're at this place you can't go any
[29:15] farther until that thing's out right
[29:18] you're asking for victory right you want
[29:20] victory so much you come to service
[29:22] every sunday i've got the victory i've
[29:24] got the victory right but then there's
[29:26] things in your life you can't you can't
[29:27] get away from right you can't break off
[29:30] and as brother isaiah said he said
[29:33] he said
[29:34] he said you need the holy ghost to quit
[29:36] smoking no you need to stop right he
[29:39] says no you need to stop right
[29:42] praise god so he says in the morning
[29:45] he says in the morning there therefore
[29:47] you shall be brought according to your
[29:49] tribes and it shall be
[29:51] that the tribe which the lord taketh
[29:54] shall come according to the families
[29:56] thereof and the family which the lord
[29:58] shall take
[29:59] shall come by his by the household and
[30:02] the household
[30:04] which the lord shall take shall come man
[30:06] by man so you see even the the quote we
[30:09] read before the habits of the household
[30:11] right what's going on in the households
[30:14] that are affecting this right
[30:16] it starts in the house it starts in the
[30:18] home it starts with the individual but
[30:20] the individual creates that atmosphere
[30:23] amen
[30:24] and then you you wonder and i
[30:26] i pray that you forgive me but um you
[30:29] wonder why uh kids
[30:32] kids would um
[30:34] you know have a disrespect towards a
[30:36] minister or something like that why it's
[30:38] because the parents right
[30:40] it's because of the attitude in the
[30:41] house right
[30:43] if they're if they're talking about it
[30:45] right
[30:46] then
[30:47] the kids
[30:48] all they're seeing is what the parents
[30:49] are doing amen that's the habit of the
[30:51] house amen i mean if there's gossip
[30:54] going out that kid see the kids all they
[30:57] all they see next time they see that
[30:58] person
[31:00] is is that right all that all they want
[31:03] is just you stay away and there's just
[31:04] this disrespect right so it's the habits
[31:07] of the home and man it's what you say
[31:09] what you profess in the home amen
[31:11] amen i i truly believe um
[31:14] the um you know ministers we are human
[31:17] right we are human we make mistakes amen
[31:20] but never disrespect the gift of god
[31:23] amen in that brother amen he may make
[31:26] the the wildest mistake amen
[31:29] but if there's if there's still a gift
[31:32] amen that can be used and it hasn't gone
[31:35] again
[31:35] gone against script scripture
[31:37] or the word of god then then god can
[31:40] still use him right he can still he can
[31:43] still be available we pray we pray that
[31:46] the lord would correct him and he'd come
[31:47] to himself amen amen that should be our
[31:50] true prayer amen
[31:51] instead of tearing him down and keep
[31:53] tearing him down amen he's losing his
[31:56] he's losing his influence amen
[31:59] amen
[32:01] so we have here
[32:03] so god's getting down to business with
[32:04] this god is not messing around right
[32:07] when it comes to this hindrance in your
[32:09] life he's not he's not messing around
[32:12] in the morning um in the morning
[32:14] therefore
[32:15] um
[32:16] shall we brought according to the tribes
[32:18] and it shall so we read that so he's
[32:20] coming he's coming to the individual
[32:22] he's coming to the households he's come
[32:23] to the tribes right he i mean imagine
[32:26] how many people are in israel right and
[32:28] he's going through all of these he's
[32:30] trying to figure this out right god's
[32:32] down to business right let's be bound
[32:34] down to business amen praise the lord
[32:38] amen and it shall be
[32:40] verse 15 and it shall be
[32:42] that he that is taken with the accursed
[32:44] thing shall be burnt with fire
[32:47] and he and all that he hath
[32:50] because he hath transgressed
[32:52] the covenant of the lord and because he
[32:55] hath wrought folly in israel
[32:58] so josiah or sorry so
[33:01] joshua rose up early in the morning and
[33:04] brought israel by their tribes and the
[33:07] tribe of judah
[33:08] was taken and he brought the family of
[33:10] judah and he took the family of zur
[33:13] heights
[33:14] he's all rights and he brought the
[33:16] family of the czar it's man by man and
[33:19] zebda was taken so he's getting down to
[33:22] aiken right
[33:23] and he brought his household man by man
[33:26] and aiken the son of karmy
[33:29] and
[33:30] son of zebdy and son of zarah
[33:33] and the tribe of judah was taken
[33:36] and joshua said unto aiken my son
[33:39] give i pray thee glory to the lord god
[33:42] of israel and make confession unto him
[33:45] and tell me now what that has done hide
[33:48] it not from me
[33:50] and even even with aiken's ending he
[33:54] came he honestly once it once it got
[33:56] down to it he came with an honest heart
[33:58] he said answered
[34:00] aiken answered joshua and said indeed i
[34:03] have sinned he he comes to the
[34:04] conclusion yes i've sinned against the
[34:07] lord of god
[34:08] and thus and thus i have i have done
[34:11] amen are you coming honestly before the
[34:13] throne of god when you when you really
[34:15] want something from god are you coming
[34:17] honestly or are you saying yes i still
[34:19] have these things in my life that i i
[34:22] want to hold on to
[34:24] or are you coming honestly are you
[34:26] saying yes yes lord i'm wrong
[34:29] right
[34:31] and joshua um
[34:34] and aiken answered joshua said indeed i
[34:37] have sinned against the lord god of
[34:38] israel and thus and thus have i done
[34:40] when i saw among the spoils
[34:43] see catch this
[34:44] when i saw among the spoils the goodly
[34:46] babylonish garment
[34:49] amen
[34:50] this the 200 shekels of silver
[34:54] and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels
[34:57] wait when i coveted them
[35:01] lord forgive us
[35:02] then i coveted then i coveted them and
[35:05] took them
[35:07] and behold they're hid in the in the
[35:09] earth in the midst of my tent
[35:11] so he's hiding it right it's been hidden
[35:14] amen deep underneath what you're going
[35:16] through and you don't want to let it go
[35:18] because
[35:19] it's your it's your outlet right it's
[35:22] your so-called
[35:23] outlet that you you feed on constantly
[35:26] you don't you don't want to give it up
[35:27] at all
[35:29] aiken answered
[35:31] when i saw among so here we are verse 21
[35:34] almost there
[35:35] there hid in the earth in the midst of
[35:37] the tent and the silver un under it so
[35:39] joshua sent messengers and they ran into
[35:41] the tent
[35:43] and this is this is god's judgment here
[35:45] and behold it was hid in his tent and
[35:48] the silver under it and they took him
[35:50] out of the midst of the tent
[35:52] and brought them
[35:54] unto joshua and unto all the children of
[35:56] israel and laid them unto before before
[35:59] the lord
[36:01] and this is this is the in joshua and
[36:03] all of israel with with him took achin
[36:06] and the son of zarah
[36:08] and and the silver and the garment and
[36:10] the wedge of gold and the sun so he's
[36:12] taking all all of it right he's not
[36:15] missing one thing on top of not just
[36:18] what what um
[36:20] you know it can he coveted he's not he's
[36:22] taking everything right
[36:24] he's taking everything amen
[36:27] every
[36:28] every part of that that certain thing
[36:30] that's hindering you he's taking it all
[36:32] right
[36:33] it's a full purge amen
[36:36] full sanctification and this is remember
[36:39] this is this is in your walk of the this
[36:41] is in the joshua commission this is
[36:43] happening during that time so just
[36:45] because we have the holy ghost doesn't
[36:47] mean we have a time of repent we we
[36:49] don't repent anymore or we don't need a
[36:52] purging anymore right
[36:54] so in joshua in all of israel we have it
[36:57] in his asses and his sheep and his tent
[37:00] and all that he had
[37:02] and they brought him unto the valley of
[37:04] acre
[37:06] and joshua said why hast thou troubled
[37:09] us the lord shall trouble thee this day
[37:12] and all and all israel stoned him with
[37:14] stones and burned them with fire
[37:17] after they had stoned them with these
[37:19] stones
[37:22] and they raised over him a great heap of
[37:24] stones unto this day so the lord turned
[37:26] from the fierceness of his anger
[37:28] wherefore the name of that place was
[37:31] called the valley of trouble
[37:33] acre
[37:35] unto this day
[37:37] so god's actually naming this place
[37:40] and
[37:40] you know god
[37:42] god turns beauty for ashes
[37:45] right
[37:46] he he turns
[37:48] he
[37:48] sorry am i saying that right
[37:51] beauty for ashes right he turns he takes
[37:54] what the enemy meant for evil right and
[37:56] he
[37:57] he turns it for good amen he takes this
[38:00] and uh he actually names this place
[38:02] trouble because honestly we've we've all
[38:05] had trouble amen we've all had a time
[38:08] when
[38:09] we've been here amen we need to come to
[38:11] that place of trouble so he's taking
[38:13] this and saying this is look back at
[38:16] this and don't look back amen
[38:19] don't look back he's he's as a memorial
[38:21] he calls it valley acre
[38:24] unto this day
[38:26] so so we keep moving on here
[38:29] um
[38:32] aiken had secret things he was hiding in
[38:34] his tent right
[38:36] the proverb says open rebuke is better
[38:39] than secret love
[38:41] amen come honestly before the throne of
[38:44] god amen
[38:46] he coveted he desired babylon a
[38:48] babylonian garment and this as you if
[38:51] you if you can just see it here as
[38:53] israel is a part of the believer
[38:55] so you see that this isn't just two
[38:58] individuals going at it this is this is
[39:00] your battle what you can go through
[39:02] right it's not i'm trying to
[39:04] natural types the spiritual but
[39:07] just bear me bear with me as far as this
[39:09] can be going in an individual you know
[39:12] while that the holy ghost may be inside
[39:14] but this can still be happening that
[39:16] things need to be burned out of your
[39:18] life amen
[39:20] amen
[39:22] and
[39:23] he coveted babylonian garments or money
[39:26] amen it could be something as simple as
[39:28] money i mean you think of brother kyle
[39:30] mentions this you know a lot um as far
[39:32] as um

[40:00] constant repentance
[40:02] there should never be a time when we

[40:15] god's given us that right of repentance
[40:18] amen we can repent before him and turn

[40:32] it's okay to make mistakes but make new
[40:35] ones amen don't look back forget the
[40:38] things which are behind and press toward
[40:40] the mark of the higher calling amen
[40:43] there's always a higher calling with god
[40:46] god is limitless amen
[40:49] pull up that next quote there
[40:53] amen uh go to the next one i think it's
[40:56] in yeah
[40:57] and uh some homework for you to do this
[41:00] will go along with what i've spoken but
[41:02] listen to that how can i overcome amen
[41:05] um people wonder like where's their
[41:07] barrier um
[41:09] but amen find it in the word amen find
[41:12] find uh find your resources in the word
[41:15] amen of
[41:16] how you fight amen we sing that song
[41:18] this is how i fight my battles what are
[41:20] we using we're using this amen that's
[41:23] how we fight our battles amen
[41:26] amen neither can you so he's talking
[41:27] about trying to do like trying to live
[41:30] this christian walk and then trying to
[41:32] do it neither can you neither can i but
[41:34] if we'll just hold still and let him do
[41:37] it just yield to him
[41:39] hear lord here i am
[41:42] just just let me be nothing
[41:45] i i yield you put my hand in the right
[41:48] place that's the victory that's
[41:50] overcoming
[41:51] amen it's a complete surrender god's
[41:53] looking for a complete surrender
[41:56] the thing that the thing you have to
[41:58] overcome is yourself right
[42:01] this israel
[42:03] in israel israel had to overcome itself
[42:05] amen in that instance right and define
[42:08] what was wrong and overcome itself
[42:10] itself
[42:11] your idea your thing
[42:13] and surrender yourself to him he
[42:15] overcame for you he knows the way we
[42:18] don't amen
[42:20] amen that's the type of humility we
[42:22] should have
[42:23] amen last thing i i catch from this this
[42:26] whole aiken
[42:28] um
[42:29] it takes a lot of pride to um to hide
[42:32] things right
[42:34] it takes a lot of pride to hold things
[42:36] in and not not expose the devil amen if
[42:38] he's if if honestly if he's working in
[42:41] you right
[42:42] and then um he would have a lot of pride
[42:45] to know that god's
[42:46] know god's word right he knows he knows
[42:49] the law and still
[42:51] take these things these cursed things
[42:54] if we want to know the devil in all of
[42:56] his tricks which that's overcoming
[42:58] knowing the devil in all of his tricks
[43:00] amen
[43:02] amen
[43:03] and if we want to know
[43:05] we must understand that after victories
[43:07] in our life we must never find ourselves
[43:10] with a spirit of pride
[43:12] amen we
[43:14] and i i i can speak for my testimony you
[43:17] you find yourself in this this
[43:18] mountaintop right
[43:20] and uh i don't know if you've i i call
[43:23] it bride pride right i call it bride
[43:26] pride where pretty much
[43:28] um you're up here everyone else is down
[43:31] here right and you've got it and then
[43:33] you start thinking that you can handle
[43:35] things right
[43:36] and
[43:37] god will be sure to correct you on those
[43:39] on those things amen you'll find
[43:41] yourself
[43:42] going through those cycles because you
[43:44] find yourself in a place of pride
[43:46] that um
[43:48] pride cometh before destruction right
[43:50] if we want to know
[43:52] if we want to know the devil in all of
[43:54] his tricks we must understand
[43:56] that our victories in our life
[43:58] um
[43:59] let's see one of one of the great i
[44:01] believe this is one of the greatest
[44:02] pitfalls after an experience with god is
[44:05] because
[44:06] with the experience of the holy ghost
[44:08] um you're a babe in christ right
[44:11] you don't know a lot a whole lot amen
[44:14] and um as far as character goes right
[44:18] and
[44:19] sometimes pride can build up the devil
[44:21] can hit you with some pride where um you
[44:24] know you're up you're right and no one
[44:26] else is amen and you'll you'll just be
[44:28] sitting on your uh
[44:30] on your um
[44:32] you know sitting on your your phone
[44:34] looking at things it's like no i'm good
[44:36] i'm good
[44:37] i can handle it right that's the first
[44:39] thing from the truth amen
[44:41] god wants a full uh full dedication amen
[44:45] so um
[44:47] spirit let's see one of the greatest
[44:49] pitfalls is a christian can have the
[44:51] experience
[44:52] uh with god as a prideful spirit
[44:55] because we think we can handle it but
[44:57] one comp uh
[44:59] but one compromise after the next will
[45:01] lead to spiritual death or stagnancy
[45:04] amen we don't want to be spiritually
[45:06] stagnant amen
[45:08] amen or spiritual amnesia amen
[45:11] but i want to encourage you tonight
[45:13] after we read all this uh joshua 7 i
