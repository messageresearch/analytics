[4:36] hold me in the end every moment in the
[4:42] middle make my heart your
[4:45] Bethlehem be born in
[4:51] me Matthew 1 and verse 18 now the birth
[4:54] of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[4:59] his mother Mary was espouse to Joseph
[5:01] before they came together she was found
[5:03] with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph
[5:06] her husband being a just man and not
[5:09] willing to make her a public example was
[5:12] minded to put her away privately but
[5:15] while he thought on these things behold
[5:18] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[5:20] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[5:22] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[5:25] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[5:27] her is of the Holy Ghost
[5:30] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[5:33] shalt call his name Jesus for he shall
[5:35] save his people from their sins now all
[5:39] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[5:43] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[5:45] prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be
[5:48] with child and shall bring forth a son
[5:52] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[5:55] which being interpreted is god with us
[5:58] then Joseph being being raised from
[6:00] sleep did as the angel of the Lord had
[6:03] bidden him and took unto him his wife
[6:07] and knew her not till she had brought
[6:09] forth her firstborn son and he called
[6:12] his name Jesus I want to speak on the
[6:15] birth of Christ under strange
[6:17] circumstances and when it worded it this
[6:20] way when it said the birth of Jesus
[6:23] Christ was on this wise the Amplified
[6:26] says there the birth took place under
[6:29] these type of circumstances and when I
[6:31] was reading it the other day I realized
[6:34] that the setting that his birth took
[6:36] place was kind of a strange setting and
[6:38] that's why I've titled that this morning
[6:40] the birth of Christ under strange
[6:42] circumstances because the circumstances
[6:45] and the setting and what took place and
[6:47] how it took place was uh from the carnal
[6:50] mind a pretty troubling type of setting
[6:53] it was a pretty strange setting and as a
[6:56] matter of fact we wouldn't believe that
[6:58] God would be doing something as great as
[7:00] send coming himself and connecting with
[7:03] us as God he would do as it says in the
[7:06] scripture for the purpose of saving his
[7:09] people from their sins I'll tell you
[7:11] that's a pretty big condescension that's
[7:14] a pretty big moment that's happening
[7:16] right here that he's beginning the
[7:18] process of saving his people from their
[7:21] sins how many know that you're a sinner
[7:23] this morning we're all Sinners without
[7:26] hope without Christ coming can you say
[7:28] Amen so this is a very amazing spot of
[7:31] Prophecy to be fulfilled it's one of the
[7:34] greatest uh places of Prophecy to be
[7:36] fulfilled that it's called Emmanuel this
[7:39] would be God with us this would be so
[7:41] significant it's God With Us it's God
[7:44] condescending to us and we know he came
[7:47] in a little baby at first and began life
[7:49] that way but it was actually God
[7:51] condescending to us it was God coming
[7:54] and connecting with us it was it was the
[7:57] birth of the king not not a king it was
[8:00] the birth of the ultimate King and and
[8:04] and yet it's enshrouded it's it's it's
[8:06] surrounded and clouded as if I could say
[8:09] that the whole greatest thing of the
[8:11] birth of Christ was clouded by very
[8:15] strange
[8:16] circumstances and in fact I can safely
[8:19] say that that it this this um this
[8:23] situation that Christ was born in was
[8:25] actually out of sync completely with a
[8:28] normal thought patterns of the world and
[8:31] also I want to emphasize this he came
[8:35] out of sync with the normal thought
[8:37] patterns of the religious
[8:41] organizations completely contrary to the
[8:44] way they thought he would come because
[8:45] even their minds in relig religious
[8:48] denominations and organization even
[8:50] their minds although they were
[8:52] worshiping God their minds had be become
[8:55] Twisted by their Creeds and their dogmas
[8:58] that they weren't looking at God
[8:59] correctly they didn't see God right so
[9:02] when he slipped in in Simplicity and
[9:04] enshrouded with kind of a a situation
[9:06] that was very very strange and looked
[9:09] ungodly when God came in that they were
[9:12] so messed up in the way they thought
[9:14] about God is that they couldn't
[9:16] understand why God would do this and so
[9:20] uh because it was against the thought
[9:22] patterns and the normal thought patterns
[9:24] it seems that it's a strange
[9:25] circumstances and the carnal mind the
[9:28] carnal mind would never see this never
[9:30] understand this if they seen God behind
[9:33] this it would take a revelation to see
[9:35] God behind this circumstances can you
[9:38] say
[9:39] Amen so you can really say it this way
[9:41] to make it understandable this wonderful
[9:43] Jewish believing couple believed in
[9:46] Jehovah God this wonderful Jewish
[9:48] believing couple Joseph and Mary fell in
[9:51] love and they got engaged this wonderful
[9:54] Jewish believing couple Joseph and Mary
[9:56] fell in love and got engaged and then
[9:58] she turns up pregnant before they got
[10:01] married said she turns up pregnant
[10:03] before they got married and they hadn't
[10:05] been together yet to have a child
[10:07] they're only engaged a spouse to one
[10:09] another the final marriage hadn't taken
[10:11] place and they were not together yet and
[10:13] she turns up pregnant so you could
[10:16] easily you could really say that this is
[10:18] circumstances that are very very strange
[10:21] for God to be born in and come in his
[10:23] kingdom and first of all It Don't Fit
[10:26] with how God in our minds would do
[10:29] things remember how many believe it this
[10:31] morning remember God is a righteous God
[10:35] he is righteous he's the ultimate of
[10:37] righteous he's where we get
[10:38] righteousness
[10:40] from how many believe God is righteous
[10:43] how many believe he's the only one
[10:45] that's righteous and so we know that and
[10:47] most people go we know God is righteous
[10:50] and it don't seem like God like his
[10:53] nature to reveal and to bring his
[10:56] righteousness to us with circum es that
[11:00] did not look righteous at
[11:03] all and when you take the laws of God
[11:06] and the things that were're still today
[11:08] teaching young people about uh saving
[11:10] sex before marriage and saving that
[11:12] honor for the marriage day and all these
[11:14] things that were Tau to the Jews in the
[11:16] Old Testament we still teach today
[11:18] because they're are God's principles
[11:19] they're God's laws and they are true can
[11:22] you say amen and they still apply to the
[11:24] human being can you say Amen so this is
[11:27] what Joseph and Mary believ this is is
[11:29] what Mary's parents believe this is what
[11:31] the church is still held on to as a
[11:33] matter of fact the law they held on to
[11:34] so long if somebody committed adultery
[11:37] then they held to the Old Law that they
[11:38] had to be stoned they actually had to be
[11:40] stoned if they broke that and were found
[11:42] pregnant before the marriage so now this
[11:46] is what happens and so the carnal mind
[11:48] could never look at what's happening and
[11:50] see God behind
[11:52] it I'm just stopping for a minute and
[11:54] I'm saying why Lord why Lord did you do
[11:58] it this way yes and I don't even have
[12:00] all the answers CU I don't understand
[12:03] all of God but I know I can look through
[12:06] the Bible and see a pattern of him when
[12:09] he comes he reveals himself in
[12:12] Simplicity and also he comes and he's
[12:15] working in a in in a thing that if we
[12:18] looked at it from our eyes carnally we
[12:21] wouldn't find God in it why don't I talk
[12:24] about you when you're living in sin and
[12:27] when you're out there and then God
[12:28] begins to work in your life and you
[12:30] still got habits and different things
[12:31] but God's being beginning to work and
[12:33] nobody knows what's happening it's a
[12:36] good thing God didn't judge you right
[12:37] there it's a good thing he could look
[12:39] inside and see the seat of God within
[12:41] you it's a good thing that somebody
[12:44] could look beyond what was happening in
[12:46] your
[12:47] circumstances I'm preaching to you today
[12:50] we have to look past the circumstances
[12:52] that surround our life and we have to be
[12:55] looking for the god that's trying to
[12:57] reveal himself
[13:00] L we miss god brother Paul I've had some
[13:03] trouble this year that I never dreamed
[13:05] would happen in my family domestic life
[13:07] whatever has happened I've had some
[13:09] things you wouldn't dream it's
[13:10] unprecedented well it's not
[13:11] unprecedented it's probably happened
[13:13] before but you think it's unprecedented
[13:15] but when you look at it with from the
[13:17] carnal eyes and the embarrassment of
[13:19] everything everybody else that sees your
[13:21] life you can only be looking at your
[13:23] circumstances but there's only one
[13:24] answer from the message that we're to
[13:26] look at circumstances we are not to bow
[13:28] to our circumstances we are not to read
[13:31] read the wrong thing into our
[13:32] circumstances we're actually supposed to
[13:34] embrace our particular circumstances
[13:37] because we know that in those things God
[13:41] can be revealing
[13:45] himself if I have any lesson for the
[13:48] church this year this is my this is my
[13:51] New Year's
[13:52] revelation we better stop looking at the
[13:55] outside and the surface we better start
[13:58] looking for God to be revealing yourself
[14:00] I'm looking for
[14:01] God where is he trying to reveal
[14:05] himself is everybody with
[14:07] me because you can judge matters and
[14:10] think you got it right and you're
[14:11] completely wrong you can judge another
[14:14] person by even how they would act or
[14:17] dress sometimes and you could judge it
[14:18] completely
[14:20] wrong we have to grow up and not judge
[14:22] things by the flesh Paul said we know no
[14:25] man after the flesh including Jesus
[14:29] Christ he says I know we knew him after
[14:31] the flesh he lived here for 30 but we
[14:33] can't even know Jesus after the flesh we
[14:36] have to know him by this Elohim this
[14:38] being this Christ that comes into our
[14:41] lives but we can't know any man after
[14:44] the Flesh and so now we find then that
[14:47] first of all you don't see God that
[14:49] would fit into these things because he's
[14:50] a righteous God I'm going to get into
[14:52] that a little bit more in a minute what
[14:53] righteousness really is it don't seem
[14:55] like God would reveal himself and bring
[14:58] his righteousness in circumstances that
[15:00] were not righteous at all and yet we
[15:02] know from 1 Corinthians chap 1 verse 27
[15:06] it expresses to us that God will stumble
[15:09] conventional wisdom and will hide
[15:11] himself in base things this is the way
[15:13] it's worded 1 Corinthians uh 1 127 but
[15:16] God had chosen the foolish things of the
[15:19] world to confound the wise and God had
[15:22] chosen the weak things of the world to
[15:25] confound the things which are Mighty and
[15:27] base things of the world and things
[15:29] which are despised hath God chosen yay
[15:34] and the things which are not to bring to
[15:36] not things that are that no flesh could
[15:41] glory in his
[15:44] presence God's got an
[15:47] agenda God's going to make the world
[15:49] look stupid one
[15:51] day come on can you say amen God is
[15:54] going to confound the wise God he's
[15:56] already done it he'll do it again that
[15:59] someday they're going to say there's no
[16:01] way that God sent his last day's message
[16:03] through a package like this there's no
[16:05] way you can do it but God's going to
[16:07] confound all the wisdoms of every
[16:10] University of every Seminary of every
[16:13] God is going to make them look stupid
[16:16] when he shows that's exactly what I was
[16:18] doing in the end time and you missed me
[16:21] so we know by First Corinthians 1 that's
[16:23] God's nature to do that so it's not like
[16:26] God in our own minds to do things this
[16:28] way
[16:30] and then Through The Eyes of everyone
[16:32] around Mary and Joseph think about it
[16:34] now when this happens and she comes to
[16:37] her mom and dad and says I'm pregnant
[16:41] you know uh Through The Eyes of everyone
[16:43] Mary's parents Joseph Mary the church
[16:48] that was around them would who would
[16:49] eventually hear you know word bad uh
[16:54] negative travels faster than
[16:57] positive oh
[16:59] yes and
[17:02] so uh everyone's going to know about it
[17:05] and through the Through The Eyes this
[17:07] all looks very very bad and also it
[17:11] looks embarrassing one of the Traditions
[17:13] that we have and I've told you before we
[17:15] we watch during Christmas time I don't
[17:17] know if it' be tonight or tomorrow we
[17:19] watch a movie it's called The Nativity
[17:22] Story please don't tell the whole world
[17:24] we watch a movie but if anybody hears
[17:26] it's about movie about it's one of the
[17:28] best movies about the birth birth of
[17:29] Christ and how Mary went through all
[17:31] those Transitions and so we watch it
[17:33] every year and uh I love it because it's
[17:36] so real in some places a lot of the you
[17:39] know the the movies of Christ are just
[17:42] really glossed over and but this one
[17:44] they're really real and and so when when
[17:47] Mary and Joseph's parents and I can't
[17:49] remember completely I should remember it
[17:51] because we watch it every year but I
[17:52] can't remember what Happ was but I know
[17:53] the tension and I know Mary's dad he
[17:56] became he didn't know what to do when
[17:58] when he heard this she's sitting there
[18:00] by herself saying the angel told her
[18:02] this and their spouse he's encouraged
[18:05] this engagement with Joseph and Mary
[18:07] he's real proud because he's got a
[18:08] business and he's watching out for his
[18:10] daughter he's got a good Mary was a
[18:11] little reluctant in the movie to to go
[18:13] with him but they you know they
[18:15] eventually fell in love and so now this
[18:16] whole he's very happy why is the Daddy
[18:19] happy this is going to be a normal thing
[18:21] I got somebody to take care of my
[18:22] daughter this a normal life and then the
[18:24] girl his daughter comes and says I'm
[18:25] pregnant what what
[18:30] and it's just you see the tension mared
[18:33] mared he's he's you know he's pacing the
[18:35] floor and then he looks at Joseph and
[18:37] Joseph's
[18:40] going because in something like this
[18:42] you're trying to find somebody to blame
[18:44] you're trying to find what's going on
[18:46] this is interrupting the whole plan the
[18:48] whole normal let me tell you something
[18:51] God will interrupt your plan you people
[18:55] that are control
[18:56] freaks get ready for a less and if you
[18:59] come close to God God's going to show
[19:01] you you're not in control of life you're
[19:03] not in control of your
[19:06] family and so Mary's dad felt that's
[19:09] this is all in the bag everything is
[19:10] normal and she turns up pregnant and so
[19:13] now the people are going to hear with
[19:15] everybody who looks from that point on
[19:17] this whole thing is going to be
[19:19] embarrassing it's going to be looked
[19:20] down on and yet in the middle of this is
[19:23] what God's doing to bring his kingdom to
[19:25] the world to the
[19:27] earth I don't I don't understand all
[19:30] that I don't understand some of the
[19:33] people that are sitting here this
[19:34] morning I don't understand some of you
[19:36] you shouldn't be here in church with
[19:38] your family worshiping the way that
[19:41] you're
[19:42] worshiping everything in the caral mind
[19:45] says no not you when you look at when
[19:48] I'm looking over your lives and seeing
[19:50] some of you shouldn't be here some of
[19:52] you come up under a real strict
[19:54] background and so sometimes that
[19:56] strictness makes you distant towards God
[19:58] and your hesitant towards God because
[19:59] you come up in a legalistic background
[20:01] but some didn't we got some drug addicts
[20:03] here we got some people that slept
[20:05] around we got some people you're sitting
[20:06] next to you that weren't perfect you got
[20:08] all kinds of testimonies here this
[20:10] morning you shouldn't be here and that's
[20:12] why we have to mature and grow and not
[20:14] judge things by the outside
[20:17] appearance because the circumstances can
[20:20] look very very
[20:23] unrighteous and God's trying to birth
[20:26] true righteousness it's easy for us
[20:29] today to believe this was Emanuel 2,000
[20:32] years ago it's easy for us to believe
[20:34] because we see he was birthed we see
[20:36] that he grew up we see he had Miracles
[20:38] and signs and wonders there's no man
[20:40] like this in the face of the Earth
[20:41] that's lived for 33 years then we see it
[20:44] all end in a death burial and a
[20:46] resurrection his he has an empty tomb so
[20:48] now it's easy for us to say today that
[20:52] this was Emanuel but back when he was
[20:54] being born nobody could identify and say
[20:57] there's no way way that Emanuel God With
[20:59] Us is happening in these circumstances
[21:02] after seeing all that Jesus did in his
[21:04] life most will say it's God now but in
[21:06] that hour the circumstances around it
[21:09] would have you very confused that can't
[21:11] be God that can't be God working it's
[21:13] just not the way that God would do it
[21:15] and verse 19 speaks of Joseph now I want
[21:17] you to start bringing this out verse 19
[21:19] Matthew 1:19 then after we they all find
[21:22] out about the pregnancy then we find out
[21:24] verse 19 then Joseph her husband being a
[21:26] just man and not willing to to make her
[21:28] a public example was minded to put her
[21:31] away privately so now here's the next
[21:33] thing I want to show that we can do
[21:35] sometimes is that when you have
[21:36] something embarrassing take place and
[21:39] and and and and you have something even
[21:40] in your own life a mistake or whatever
[21:43] and you have something take place we're
[21:44] always trying to what can we do in our
[21:46] minds to cover this up what can we do to
[21:49] fix this how can we minimize the gossip
[21:53] how can we and so Joseph and and Mary's
[21:55] dad is in this mode of trying to to to
[21:59] to to get something together here to
[22:01] keep this private because it's
[22:03] embarrassing to the
[22:04] family what do we do here why can't we
[22:07] do this and and and he so so the
[22:09] thoughts and this is when circumstances
[22:12] happen in our lives that are not
[22:14] pleasant that are negative the first
[22:16] thing we engage in is our mind and our
[22:18] thought life to try to figure out how to
[22:20] fix it try to hide it because no human
[22:23] being likes to be embarrassed and so
[22:25] when something happens when your
[22:26] testimony something's going to go out
[22:27] that you're not uh uh coming out
[22:30] smelling like a rose we will do things
[22:32] in our mind to try to private and he
[22:34] says he's a just man I think it was very
[22:36] honorable I've preached that to young
[22:37] people this was an honorable man because
[22:39] he's thinking of Mary and all that's
[22:41] going to go around about her so he's
[22:42] thinking I'll just go ahead and SP start
[22:44] the divorce proceedings even before
[22:46] we're technically married and we'll keep
[22:48] this as private as we can and we'll do
[22:50] this that and the other and so that was
[22:51] all fine that was all fine that was just
[22:54] but that wasn't God's
[22:56] plan and because Jose was going to act
[22:59] upon this and not marry her the angel of
[23:02] the Lord had to step in like he has to
[23:05] step in with your life sometimes when
[23:07] your mind has figured everything out and
[23:10] you're going to do it this way to cover
[23:11] for yourself the angel of the Lord May
[23:14] step into your life and say no no you're
[23:16] not going to do that because what you
[23:18] don't see is what's happening is the
[23:20] word is being fulfilled in your
[23:24] life how many would raise your hand and
[23:26] say I thank God for his grace in my life
[23:28] that he sends his angels his Messengers
[23:32] his five-fold ministry and when I was
[23:34] about ready to act upon foolishness and
[23:37] act upon something that I thought was
[23:39] right the angel of the Lord over the
[23:41] pulpit stood and said don't do that stop
[23:44] sit still watch I was looking for a
[23:46] quote last night I was looking because
[23:48] there's some situation where that I
[23:50] can't remember who it was maybe it was
[23:52] just a few months ago but it's just like
[23:54] sit still God's doing something sit
[23:56] still God's doing something don't act
[23:59] too quickly cuz God's doing something
[24:01] and that's the way we got to be in
[24:02] maturity we got to be careful that we
[24:04] don't act too quickly with this can I
[24:07] get an amen this morning we got to be
[24:09] careful that we don't act too quickly
[24:11] when our circumstances make us
[24:12] embarrassed and we got to do something
[24:14] about it maybe sit still God might be
[24:17] doing something sit still and see the
[24:19] glory of God stand still and see the
[24:22] glory of God we act upon our own carnal
[24:24] Minds because sometimes of the
[24:27] embarrassment of what going to look like
[24:28] to everybody else and this is the mode
[24:31] that Joseph was in and he's a man of
[24:33] honor and respect to help cover for Mary
[24:35] he sets out to do a private divorce
[24:37] really thinking to think through all
[24:39] this and figure out a plan we do that in
[24:41] our circumstances trying to figure out
[24:43] ourselves the best way we can do things
[24:46] because it makes us nervous when
[24:47] something happens out of the normal it's
[24:49] going to make you look bad and human
[24:51] beings do not like looking bad often
[24:54] human beings do not look they don't like
[24:56] looking bad and often they deflect the
[24:58] attention to someone else by gossiping
[25:00] and putting another one down people
[25:03] criticize to make themselves look better
[25:05] my my my point is to you this morning is
[25:09] we step into action quickly sometimes to
[25:11] deal with
[25:12] situations and is amazing what we do to
[25:14] cover up our shame and our embarrassment
[25:17] so that we can look righteous and holy
[25:18] in front of everybody life dishes out
[25:21] some abnormal things and we want to
[25:23] appear normal we want to appear good to
[25:26] everyone this action and effort
[25:30] to make ourselves look good to everybody
[25:34] is flawed because it's trying to work it
[25:37] out ourselves it's trying to make us
[25:39] appear right to others but the main
[25:42] reason it's flawed is it might be
[25:45] against what God is really trying to do
[25:48] he says by but while Joseph thought on
[25:51] these things what's he thinking about
[25:53] how can I fix this what can I do put it
[25:55] away privately we got to do this we got
[25:56] to cover it up while he was thinking all
[25:58] those things the angel of the Lord
[26:00] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[26:01] Joseph the son of David fear not why is
[26:04] he saying fear not because he's living
[26:05] under fear because of his
[26:08] circumstance aren't you glad when God
[26:10] rich in Mercy comes and says stop
[26:12] fearing the future stop fearing your
[26:16] circumstance stop being fearful because
[26:19] what's happening in Mary this that is
[26:22] happening was already spoken by a
[26:26] prophet
[26:28] and you're trying to cover it up you're
[26:30] trying to no no no the word the word is
[26:33] being fulfilled in your
[26:35] life marry that woman you know that I'm
[26:38] just going to close this by saying I got
[26:40] a bunch of quotes I wanted to read and
[26:42] everything so I want to
[26:43] say this was the next the last scripture
[26:46] says in verse 25 verse 24 then Joseph
[26:50] being raised from sleep did as the angel
[26:53] of the Lord had been him and took unto
[26:55] him his wife both Mary
[26:58] and both Joseph when they got the
[27:01] picture from the angel of what this
[27:03] really was and what was going on they
[27:05] both offered to God what was needed to
[27:08] begin the process I tell you friends it
[27:10] doesn't take just God's word it takes a
[27:13] heart saying be it unto me it takes a
[27:16] heart said I'm willing to Bear the
[27:18] reproach I'm willing to live like a
[27:20] young girl and dress like a young girl
[27:22] should dress I'm willing to follow God
[27:24] I'm willing to his word to be fulfilled
[27:26] in my life a young man it takes a young
[27:28] said like Joseph okay now it's settled
[27:31] I'm all

[27:36] duration and we will carry this word I
[27:38] will take care of this word I will raise
[27:40] this son even though he's not my own I'm
