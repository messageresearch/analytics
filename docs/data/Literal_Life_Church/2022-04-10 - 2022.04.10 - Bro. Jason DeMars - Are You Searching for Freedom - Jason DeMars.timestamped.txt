[0:00] so
[0:01] thankful to see the gifts in people's
[0:03] lives and people operating them and just
[0:06] appreciate the
[0:08] singers and musicians and
[0:11] the
[0:12] people in the booth back there
[0:13] appreciate you two
[0:15] you make everybody sound good
[0:18] everybody look good the people on video
[0:22] are as good as they can look i guess
[0:24] you kind of
[0:26] got what you're working with but
[0:29] praise the lord so i just wanted to give
[0:31] just a real brief missions update
[0:34] and uh
[0:36] a
[0:37] little testimony so
[0:39] this is
[0:40] the church that i've been working with
[0:42] in uh cairo egypt
[0:46] and
[0:47] we've been working with them for a few
[0:49] years
[0:50] they're doing a lot of outreach this is
[0:52] at one of the meetings we had and
[0:55] invited a lot of
[0:56] pentecostal people there to come to the
[0:58] services and
[1:00] saw real good results the lord moved
[1:02] mightily
[1:03] we're working on translating we're
[1:05] finished translating the supernatural
[1:07] series and they're handing those out to
[1:10] to people throughout the country and
[1:12] working on getting him into christian
[1:14] libraries there
[1:16] also and uh go to the next screen
[1:19] you see there i'm on the the one side
[1:22] i'm in front of the great pyramid
[1:24] with brother megaly he's the pastor that
[1:26] i'm working with there
[1:28] and uh just remember them in prayer the
[1:30] lord is really really working and
[1:32] establishing the message and
[1:34] in
[1:35] his heart and in the heart of the church
[1:37] there and
[1:38] he and his son are working on
[1:41] translating sermons of brother branham
[1:43] now that we finished the supernatural
[1:44] series the church ages book is done in
[1:47] arabic
[1:48] and so little by little we're kind of
[1:49] getting that seed library done
[1:52] for
[1:52] for the outreach that we're doing and
[1:54] helping people getting established in
[1:55] the word
[1:57] the other one is a
[1:58] testimony
[2:00] this this man there his wife for the
[2:03] last three years every time we had a
[2:05] prayer line she would come forward and
[2:08] her prayer was always from i want you to
[2:10] pray for my husband
[2:12] and it's been it's been difficult for
[2:14] her she's been sometimes prevented from
[2:16] coming to meetings and
[2:18] he's not wanted to be a
[2:21] committed
[2:22] christian
[2:23] and so she's always saying please pray
[2:26] for my husband i need him to get saved i
[2:27] need him to get saved well it was a
[2:30] supernatural that he even came to
[2:32] this meeting i think because of covet he
[2:34] was ready for
[2:36] trying anything
[2:39] and so he came to the meetings and she
[2:42] came forward for prayer again and i said
[2:43] oh it's a sister again i'm sure she's
[2:45] gonna ask for her husband i didn't know
[2:46] he was there
[2:48] and she said my husband wants to receive
[2:50] christ
[2:52] i said whoa what
[2:54] what where is he then bring him here
[2:56] so he came forward and we prayed with
[2:58] him and he
[2:59] received christ and
[3:01] uh just
[3:03] both she's so joyful so happy
[3:05] children were so happy
[3:07] so we thank the lord for that
[3:09] amen amen
[3:14] and so keep them in prayer we're working
[3:16] with them trying to find a way to get
[3:18] them a building they're currently
[3:19] renting
[3:20] in a
[3:21] islamic neighborhood
[3:23] and it's
[3:24] not very safe we'd like to get them into
[3:26] a little bit better area
[3:28] a better
[3:29] better
[3:31] ability to do outreach you see in egypt
[3:34] if
[3:35] a muslim converts to christianity
[3:38] it's
[3:40] immediate death sentence not from the
[3:42] government at all
[3:44] it's from the family
[3:46] typically what happens is they'll the
[3:48] person converts they kill them next they
[3:50] go to the person that the evangelist
[3:52] that brought them
[3:53] and they'll kill them in the past the
[3:55] government has turned a blind eye to
[3:56] that
[3:57] i'm not sure that they would do that
[3:58] anymore things are changing and proving
[4:00] for christians there
[4:02] but pray for them
[4:04] it's a tough situation
[4:06] and if you go to the next screen
[4:08] brother paul was mentioning my testimony
[4:10] i'm going to talk more about it later
[4:12] but it is a miracle that i'm here today
[4:14] go to the next screen
[4:16] uh this is a brother in our church who's
[4:18] a physician his assistant in the
[4:20] hospital where i was at
[4:22] and uh
[4:23] i'll just say the lord used him
[4:25] to save my life
[4:28] and so god did some supernatural things
[4:30] it wasn't just just that it was
[4:32] supernatural that he worked at the place
[4:34] that i was at
[4:36] but
[4:37] there's much more to tell about that
[4:39] if you want to continue to go to the
[4:41] next one
[4:44] that's my family
[4:45] they all send their greetings we wish
[4:47] they could come but it's kind of a last
[4:48] minute thing and
[4:50] so next time we come lord willing
[4:52] we'll all come together
[4:55] so praise the lord go to the next screen
[4:58] let's
[4:58] let's all stand up we're going to go to
[5:00] the word
[5:01] my subject for
[5:03] this morning is
[5:06] are you searching for freedom
[5:10] amen
[5:12] god puts it into our heart
[5:14] to search for freedom
[5:16] to look for freedom
[5:18] it's it's in that it's in the heart of
[5:19] every
[5:20] person that breathes
[5:23] to search and define and try to find
[5:25] freedom
[5:27] scripture i want to start with is
[5:30] genesis 3
[5:32] 1-5
[5:34] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[5:37] beast of the field which the lord god
[5:39] had made
[5:40] and he said unto the woman yea
[5:43] hath god said
[5:44] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[5:47] garden
[5:48] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[5:50] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[5:52] garden
[5:53] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[5:55] the midst of the garden god has said you
[5:56] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[5:58] touch it
[6:00] lest ye die
[6:01] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[6:03] shall not surely die
[6:06] and i'm going to do this from the esb
[6:08] for god knows that when you eat of it
[6:11] your eyes will be opened and you will be
[6:14] like god
[6:16] knowing good and
[6:18] evil amen may the lord have the blessing
[6:21] of the reading of his word you can be
[6:22] seated
[6:25] so
[6:29] the first
[6:31] attack of the enemy
[6:33] against
[6:34] the human race the human race was
[6:36] designed to be
[6:37] in the image and likeness of god
[6:40] in other words
[6:42] we are to be the expression of the
[6:45] invisible god so whether you're looking
[6:47] at adam and eve
[6:49] you weren't just looking at humanity you
[6:51] were looking at god
[6:55] and so the reason why i brought this
[6:57] that last verse
[6:59] in the ef esv is um
[7:03] it says in the king james version you'll
[7:05] be like
[7:06] gods
[7:07] but it's the same word as it's used in
[7:09] other places it's the word elohim
[7:13] for elohim knows that when you eat of it
[7:15] your eyes will be opened and you will be
[7:17] like elohim
[7:19] knowing good and evil
[7:21] okay
[7:22] so this is satan's trap
[7:25] it's satan's trap what is a satan's
[7:28] trap he's offering them something that
[7:31] they actually already have
[7:35] he's he's saying you know what i've got
[7:37] something that's better for you if if
[7:40] they would have been thinking right
[7:42] if eve would have been thinking right
[7:43] said wait a minute
[7:45] i know
[7:46] that i'm already made in the image and
[7:48] likeness of god what do you mean i'm
[7:49] going to be like god
[7:51] knowing good and evil i can't get more
[7:54] like god
[7:56] but satan's offer is god is withholding
[8:00] something from you
[8:03] i will give it to you
[8:05] that's what the devil does today it's
[8:07] the same tactic
[8:09] what is he offering
[8:11] he's offering
[8:12] self-autonomy
[8:14] self-determination
[8:16] you can choose what you want to do you
[8:19] can be free
[8:20] that's what satan wants us to think you
[8:22] can be free
[8:24] god's withholding things from you he's
[8:26] withholding fun and good times and
[8:29] happiness and and all these things that
[8:32] you could feel so fulfilled with
[8:34] god's holy holding you back god's making
[8:37] your life
[8:38] miserable and so i what i'm gonna what
[8:41] the devil wants to do is say here here's
[8:43] something you can
[8:45] follow after the desires of your flesh
[8:49] you can fulfill the wildest dreams that
[8:51] are in your heart
[8:54] and it starts with a that's that's the
[8:55] flawed
[8:56] way of thinking that the devil is doing
[8:59] he's actually offering you what you
[9:01] already have with god
[9:03] okay he's offering the eve
[9:06] something she already has but he's
[9:08] saying you know god's holding something
[9:10] back from you
[9:12] and i'll give it to you you can make
[9:14] your own
[9:16] self-determination
[9:18] of your will you can be free
[9:21] from this
[9:22] terrible burden
[9:24] that god is laying on you
[9:28] that's what the devil is telling eve god
[9:30] god is
[9:31] he's unjust
[9:33] and and he's he's just mean-spirited he
[9:36] wants to control you
[9:38] and manipulate you that's what the devil
[9:41] is telling
[9:42] people today
[9:44] but the fact is
[9:46] the offer of self-autonomy doesn't exist
[9:51] the truth is there is no such thing
[9:54] as self-autonomy
[9:56] it's a myth
[9:58] it's a lie
[10:01] we have of course we have free will
[10:04] i understand that
[10:06] we have free will we can choose to be
[10:07] governed by god
[10:09] or we can choose to be governed by the
[10:11] devil
[10:12] there's not an in between
[10:14] the devil says there is an in-between i
[10:16] will offer you no there's not
[10:21] god doesn't deceive you
[10:24] god doesn't tell you you can just choose
[10:26] to he he doesn't say freedom is just
[10:28] doing whatever you want to do
[10:30] because he's telling you the truth
[10:32] there's no such thing as that you're
[10:33] either you're either a servant of the
[10:35] lord or you're a servant of the devil
[10:42] that that point is important because
[10:45] if you think there's a middle ground
[10:48] you'll try to choose that middle ground
[10:51] i can be free i'm more enlightened than
[10:54] everyone else i'll be able to overcome
[10:57] both god and the devil
[11:03] it's
[11:05] it's an insanity of this age
[11:07] you're not going to overcome god
[11:10] you're not going to overcome the
[11:12] devil god's god god declares it clearly
[11:16] you're either in bondage to sin or
[11:18] you're in bondage to righteousness and
[11:20] holiness
[11:23] and you know the world has come to this
[11:25] place where
[11:26] you
[11:27] you see in in
[11:29] common cultures i'd rather be a free
[11:32] person and go to hell
[11:34] if people think that way it's in it's in
[11:36] rap music it's in
[11:38] it's in rock and roll lyrics i'd rather
[11:41] be free and go to hell than be under the
[11:43] bondage of god
[11:45] and go to heaven
[11:48] incredible but that's the way the world
[11:51] thinks
[11:52] the problem is is they they miss the in
[11:54] between part they miss the in-between
[11:56] part
[11:58] they miss the in-between part and that's
[12:00] that they're
[12:02] you don't want that
[12:03] it isn't a happy life
[12:05] choosing the devil's way
[12:07] you it's a it's a short-term
[12:10] way of thinking
[12:11] i will i will take the way my flesh
[12:14] wants to go
[12:16] right now
[12:17] i'll go after my own heart my own
[12:20] desires
[12:21] which will lead to
[12:23] short-term pleasure
[12:26] long-term misery both in this life
[12:28] and the life to come
[12:30] choosing god's way god says you're going
[12:32] to suffer
[12:34] for a little while
[12:35] with joy with joy
[12:38] right now while you're suffering
[12:40] there'll be joy
[12:41] that's scriptural
[12:43] and then in the life to come there'll be
[12:46] peace
[12:47] but there's the thing is there's purpose
[12:50] if we have this idea young people that
[12:52] heaven you're going and it's just an
[12:53] eternal church service that's not what
[12:57] that's not what it is
[12:59] because you're you get sleepy and the
[13:01] preacher speaks too long and you feel
[13:03] like it's it's boring it's not boring
[13:05] once you get the spirit of god that's
[13:07] what your your week by week saying i
[13:09] can't wait i can't wait
[13:13] but there's purpose there's a life
[13:16] that god promises
[13:18] that's so incredible
[13:20] i mean you're going to go to a body that
[13:22] can pass through a wall
[13:24] you're going to be able to go just
[13:26] travel by thought from one place to
[13:27] another
[13:29] you're going to have you're going to
[13:30] have your
[13:31] you can speak the word and have control
[13:33] of nature
[13:37] so these these things when the the life
[13:39] that we're going to
[13:41] it's not a boring life it's the most
[13:43] exciting life in the millennium we're
[13:45] ruling over
[13:46] the nations
[13:49] do you want to do you want to be a king
[13:52] do you want you want to be a high level
[13:54] governor well
[13:55] jesus christ is offering you that
[13:58] opportunity but for now
[14:00] you have to sacrifice something
[14:03] that's the desires of the flesh
[14:06] you have to say i'm laying that aside
[14:09] i'm i'm looking to god and i know that
[14:12] this is going to bring short-term
[14:14] suffering because the bible says the
[14:17] glory
[14:18] that the the the suffering that we're
[14:20] going through now is not even worthy to
[14:23] be compared
[14:24] to the glory
[14:26] that'll be that will be revealed in us
[14:29] so it's it's a momentary light
[14:32] affliction the apostle paul says the
[14:34] suffering that we go through as
[14:35] christians it's momentary and it's light
[14:39] but the
[14:40] but the glory that we're that's being
[14:41] prepared for us
[14:43] is weighty
[14:45] and it's eternal
[14:47] the other choice that the devil offers
[14:49] is
[14:50] pleasure for a little while here
[14:52] momentary
[14:54] i lived in i lived in sin i didn't grow
[14:56] up in the message i lived in a sinful
[14:58] lifestyle i know i know what
[15:00] a party is and a little marijuana is
[15:04] it's a moment of enjoyment
[15:07] and it's a week of misery
[15:10] and then it's a moment of enjoyment and
[15:12] a week of misery why do we want to live
[15:14] that way
[15:15] when we can have joy no matter what our
[15:17] circumstances
[15:19] when we can have peace no matter what
[15:20] our circumstances
[15:23] every time i was done with this moment
[15:25] of pleasure thought what am i choosing
[15:28] why am i choosing this because i had a i
[15:30] grew up in a christian home i knew i was
[15:33] choosing the wrong things
[15:35] i knew i was choosing the wrong things
[15:36] and i wanted
[15:38] a change but i couldn't change myself
[15:40] and that's that's what we come up
[15:42] against young people is that you're
[15:45] surrounded in this church
[15:48] by the christian life
[15:49] but that doesn't mean you have the
[15:51] christian life yet
[15:53] and the best influence you can have as a
[15:55] young person around you is the christian
[15:57] life
[15:58] but but to try to live the christian
[16:00] life without the power of the holy ghost
[16:02] dwelling inside of you
[16:04] is an impossibility
[16:06] and so what's happening is satan is
[16:08] offering you two things
[16:10] all right
[16:11] satan is offering you one thing god is
[16:13] offering you another thing and what
[16:15] satan is offering you seems nice
[16:19] seems okay
[16:21] don't
[16:22] don't submit yourself to
[16:24] the way your parents want you to live
[16:26] don't submit yourself the way your
[16:27] church
[16:28] is behaving
[16:30] i'll show you
[16:31] you can be more enlightened than
[16:33] everybody else
[16:34] you can have a better understanding your
[16:36] life can be better
[16:39] than what those people are living
[16:42] well
[16:44] okay
[16:46] what what's what's the end of that
[16:48] what's the next step
[16:50] that's only that's your only focus your
[16:52] only focus is on
[16:54] one little thing
[16:56] of pleasure
[16:57] that mom and dad
[16:59] are not letting you do
[17:01] or the church
[17:02] the preacher saying don't do that and
[17:04] you're focused on this one little thing
[17:08] but you're not thinking long term
[17:10] you're thinking just
[17:12] this only thing so then you get then you
[17:13] say okay i'm going to get that thing and
[17:15] then you go
[17:17] i got that thing
[17:18] it doesn't actually feel very good but
[17:20] what do i do now
[17:21] what do i do now pride will come next
[17:24] pride will come next and say well i
[17:26] can't go backwards i can't go back and
[17:28] it'll push you further out of the way
[17:30] from god
[17:32] and that's a huge danger
[17:34] today because pro
[17:35] pride is the root of all sin
[17:38] pride made the devil the devil pride
[17:40] brought the fall in the beginning
[17:42] this was uh something better was offered
[17:44] to eve and she took it
[17:48] it wasn't better she found out
[17:50] it was it was horrifyingly bad
[17:56] so we live in a world
[18:00] that says that it's self-governing
[18:03] the united states governs its own
[18:04] country
[18:06] russia china all these countries
[18:09] they believe they're governing
[18:11] themselves okay so let's just say maybe
[18:14] that's true
[18:16] satan offers that
[18:18] has offered that
[18:19] to the world and the world is governing
[18:22] itself
[18:23] not knowing that there's
[18:25] spirits and
[18:26] things behind all of that controlling
[18:28] that but in their eyes they're governing
[18:31] themselves so
[18:33] young people
[18:35] people struggling
[18:38] what's the fruits of a world that's
[18:40] governing itself
[18:42] does anybody think it's a good fruit
[18:46] does the most liberal-minded person in
[18:49] the world think oh the world is just
[18:51] going great
[18:53] i just love it it's perfect it's
[18:54] peaceful it's fantastic no
[18:57] everybody wants change the right wing
[18:59] wants change the left lane everybody
[19:01] wants change why because
[19:03] governing self-government is the
[19:06] government of the devil
[19:08] it's satan's control
[19:11] and so the same thing that that's that's
[19:13] the that's the macro that's the big
[19:15] picture
[19:16] from 10 000 feet looking at the world
[19:18] and saying hey how good is it oh let's
[19:21] let's look at
[19:22] how ukrainians feel about this process
[19:26] let's look at
[19:27] other nations that are impoverished
[19:29] let's look at our own country and how we
[19:31] feel as christians about our own country
[19:34] then go to someone who's a who's the
[19:36] most liberal thinker and what do they
[19:37] think about america is anybody satisfied
[19:44] so then take that down to the microcosm
[19:46] which is your life
[19:48] the devil is offering you the
[19:50] opportunity you can govern yourself you
[19:51] know
[19:53] it's a lie
[19:55] it's a bouquet of flowers with a knife
[19:56] inside of it
[20:01] it's it's a total lie
[20:03] so as we get more technology and more
[20:06] governing bodies
[20:08] and more politics involved
[20:10] and more self-government
[20:14] are we getting happier
[20:17] are we getting more peaceful
[20:22] so the world is a mess
[20:24] because of self-government
[20:27] and it's getting less and less happy
[20:30] i think you'd almost wouldn't find a
[20:32] person that would disagree with that
[20:36] world worldwide
[20:37] no matter if they believe in god or
[20:39] don't believe in god
[20:41] they see the corruption that the world
[20:43] is going through
[20:46] okay so why would you as a young person
[20:49] or why would why would any of us
[20:52] want to choose the way of
[20:53] self-government
[20:55] which again okay
[20:57] you can look at it just as
[20:58] self-government but i'm telling you it's
[21:00] not self-government it's the headship of
[21:03] satan
[21:05] it's the dominion of the devil it's the
[21:07] control absolute control of the devil
[21:10] that's what satan offered in the
[21:11] beginning
[21:12] genesis 3 3
[21:14] he said would you like to govern
[21:16] yourself would you like to have freedom
[21:19] would you like to do it your way and get
[21:21] something better than what god is
[21:23] offering and what was the result chaos
[21:26] death
[21:27] sin destruction
[21:31] so don't let's not go after satan's way
[21:35] and i think i think this is especially
[21:37] what the devil
[21:39] will offer to young people especially
[21:41] young people going through
[21:43] adolescence
[21:44] don't be governed by your parents
[21:46] don't be governed by the standards of
[21:48] the church you're attending decide for
[21:50] yourself it's a true statement decide
[21:52] for yourself you should
[21:54] make your own choice
[21:58] whether you're going to follow god or
[21:59] not
[22:00] but don't do it with your with
[22:03] deceiving eyes
[22:05] do it with your eyes open to the big
[22:07] picture
[22:08] the devil is offering you the
[22:09] opportunity to be free
[22:13] but it's not freedom
[22:15] it's death and destruction
[22:18] god is offering you the opportunity to
[22:20] be free
[22:21] but it isn't free to do whatever you
[22:23] like to do
[22:24] it's an opportunity to be free from the
[22:27] bondage of sin and death
[22:30] because that's the condition
[22:31] every person is born under
[22:34] you're born in sin and shaped in
[22:36] iniquity
[22:37] you're
[22:38] you're coming into this world with the
[22:40] sin nature on you so you're in bondage
[22:42] to sin you that's what you choose
[22:45] thank god young people here are growing
[22:47] in a home that's governing that
[22:50] that's keeping that in check
[22:52] you should thank god for that
[22:55] just you you think well it's so tough
[22:56] it's so hard my fam just imagine growing
[22:58] up in a home where mom and dad don't
[23:00] even pay attention to you
[23:04] just think about growing up in a home
[23:05] where mom and dad are more concerned
[23:07] with the drugs that they're going to
[23:08] take next finding those or the alcohol
[23:11] they're going to consume
[23:13] and you're just left to fend for
[23:14] yourself say mom and dad are so involved
[23:17] and there's just ah they're like
[23:19] suffocating me
[23:21] thank you jesus
[23:25] mom and dad that love you that much that
[23:27] they want to see you go the right way
[23:30] just okay
[23:32] find yourself in different shoes
[23:34] think about that for a second an inner
[23:36] city kid whose parents don't have
[23:38] anything to do with them
[23:40] they have to feed themselves get
[23:42] themselves to school all of that
[23:45] just have a little perspective
[23:53] so do you want to decide for yourself
[23:56] uh let's go to the next scripture isaiah
[23:59] 14 12.
[24:02] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[24:03] lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[24:05] cut down
[24:07] to the ground which did sweak in the
[24:09] nations
[24:10] for thou hast said in thine heart i will
[24:12] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[24:14] throne above the stars of god i will sit
[24:16] also upon the mount of the congregation
[24:18] and the sides of the north i will ascend
[24:20] above the heights of the clouds i will
[24:22] be like the most
[24:24] high
[24:25] so that's what satan deceived himself
[24:27] with
[24:28] no one else from the outside deceived
[24:30] satan satan deceived his own self
[24:33] he said i'll be i'll be like the most
[24:35] high
[24:36] again
[24:37] he the same deception he used on himself
[24:40] is the same deception he used on eve and
[24:42] it's the same deception he'll use on you
[24:44] today
[24:46] what is that deception i'll be like the
[24:48] most high he already was
[24:52] he couldn't get more like that
[24:54] there's not a possibility to get more
[24:56] brother branham says he's he was
[24:58] co-equal with god no he wasn't a creator
[25:01] no he wasn't omniscient omnipotent
[25:02] omnipresent
[25:04] but on on a place of authority god had
[25:07] him right next to him
[25:09] he was
[25:10] he was the throne guardian he was a
[25:12] leader in worship
[25:14] he was god he was god's right hand man
[25:18] and he says no that's not good enough i
[25:20] want to be i want i want to be above god
[25:25] and so he offered himself something
[25:27] better and something bigger
[25:29] that's what he offered to eve
[25:32] what was the results
[25:34] that's what he'll offer to you
[25:37] you're not better
[25:39] you're not better than
[25:40] lucifer who was created
[25:43] next to god as coequal you're not better
[25:46] you're not going to trump
[25:48] what happens when you choose to govern
[25:51] yourself
[25:54] you might you you might
[25:56] you you might think
[25:58] that there's a there's a third way
[26:00] there's no third way it's the headship
[26:02] of christ or the headship of the devil
[26:06] numbers 15 39.
[26:10] and it shall be unto you a fringe
[26:13] that you may look upon it and remember
[26:15] all the commandments of the lord and do
[26:17] them
[26:18] and that you seek not after your own
[26:20] heart
[26:22] and your own eyes after which you used
[26:24] to go
[26:26] a whoring
[26:28] look at that
[26:30] god's
[26:32] viewpoint on going after your own heart
[26:35] and going after your own eyes he says
[26:36] that's adultery
[26:38] see how
[26:39] see how honest god is with you from the
[26:41] beginning
[26:43] the devil the devil offers you something
[26:45] that he can never possibly fulfill
[26:48] because he wants to control you
[26:50] god says i'm going to lead you i'm going
[26:53] to be your shepherd
[26:55] but you if you go after your own heart
[26:57] and you go after your own eyes
[26:59] you'll be considered in a level of
[27:02] adultery against the lord
[27:06] proverbs 28 26 he that trusts in his own
[27:09] heart
[27:10] is a fool
[27:11] but whoso walks wisely he shall be
[27:14] delivered
[27:15] that's that's a straight statement
[27:21] what does our society tell us today what
[27:23] a social media means continually
[27:25] preaching to young people
[27:27] follow your heart
[27:29] trust your own heart
[27:32] god says you're a fool
[27:35] god says you're an adulteress
[27:41] jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful
[27:44] above all things
[27:45] and desperately wicked who can know it
[27:48] that's why we don't follow our heart
[27:51] that's why that's why it's foolish
[27:54] to trust in your own heart
[27:58] we don't lean to our own understanding
[28:02] we don't we don't follow what our heart
[28:04] says by why why don't we follow where
[28:06] our heart is because
[28:08] there's a sin nature
[28:11] you need to have the holy ghost the only
[28:13] way
[28:14] you can ever listen to your heart
[28:18] is if the holy ghost is in there and
[28:20] then it's not listening to your heart
[28:21] it's listening to him
[28:24] as many as are led by the spirit of god
[28:26] they are the sons of god
[28:33] in fact it's not just unique to our age
[28:36] it's the deception of every age
[28:38] follow your heart make your own rules
[28:41] do it your way prank sinatra i did it my
[28:44] way
[28:47] do what you think will work best
[28:50] that's how satan starts out
[28:53] that's what he works in the minds of
[28:55] young people my
[28:56] parents are so old they could not
[28:59] possibly understand me
[29:01] they could not possibly understand what
[29:03] i went through
[29:05] i tell my kids all the time and i tell
[29:07] them my testimony all the time i do
[29:09] understand
[29:10] so that when they get to that place they
[29:12] feel like mom and dad dad doesn't
[29:14] understand they'll have that preach to
[29:16] them indelibly on their minds
[29:19] dad has told me 45 000 times that he
[29:22] understands me
[29:29] but that's how that's the little
[29:31] thing that he'll speak to young people's
[29:33] minds
[29:35] my parents don't understand
[29:38] my pastor doesn't understand the
[29:39] preacher doesn't understand
[29:41] it's different now it's the same
[29:44] in every age kids
[29:47] go after your own heart follow your own
[29:50] ways
[29:51] okay
[29:52] what's the results
[29:54] it's not doesn't take a degree in rocket
[29:56] science or philosophy to find out
[30:00] it's so it's so simple and so easy to
[30:03] find out what happens and it's misery
[30:06] it's sadness it's a constant search for
[30:09] meaning and purpose
[30:12] well i'm telling you you already have it
[30:14] it's already right in front of you it's
[30:16] preached you every wednesday and every
[30:18] sunday
[30:19] just grab a hold of it and say lord i
[30:20] need it not just in my ears i need it in
[30:22] my heart
[30:24] i need the power of the holy ghost to
[30:26] fulfill this because you can't you can't
[30:28] live
[30:29] the word without the holy ghost
[30:32] you have to have the power and fire of
[30:34] god in your soul
[30:36] and so if you're worried about something
[30:39] be worried about that
[30:41] to be sure you have the holy ghost to be
[30:44] sure he's living inside of you and
[30:46] changing your life continually
[30:50] so satan starts with that little thought
[30:53] i'm going to show you some new avenues
[30:55] that's his next
[30:56] step i'm going to show you some new
[30:58] avenues
[30:59] and they'll take you in many different
[31:00] ways
[31:01] oh you see that girl at your
[31:03] school
[31:04] that's an unbeliever
[31:06] she's real nice she's real sweet
[31:09] why don't you get in a relationship with
[31:10] that girl
[31:14] or you hear those kids they're getting
[31:15] together for a party why don't you go do
[31:18] that i'll tell you what happened to me
[31:21] i was involved with sports
[31:23] my whole life
[31:24] leading up to high school my senior year
[31:27] and senior year in baseball i got too
[31:30] proud of myself and the coach was
[31:32] benching me and i quit
[31:35] and so the people that i normally hang
[31:37] out hung out with were playing baseball
[31:39] so i had to find different people to
[31:41] hang out with
[31:42] and one kid was continuously saying i'm
[31:44] going to get you to smoke weed i'm going
[31:46] to get you to smoke weed i'm going to
[31:47] smoke weed i said no no
[31:50] 75 times i said no until the 76th time
[31:55] and i said yes because he was bothering
[31:57] me so bad
[31:59] if i would have been
[32:01] smart enough to recognize what the devil
[32:03] was doing
[32:04] at the time
[32:05] i would have said this guy is not my
[32:07] friend
[32:08] after the first time he asked me and
[32:10] said ah i got to find different people
[32:12] to be around i can't be around that
[32:15] which is what my parents were telling me
[32:18] and i didn't listen to
[32:23] so
[32:25] the direct approach that the devil will
[32:27] say is
[32:28] hey here's here's some alcohol and drugs
[32:32] that leads to sexual defilement or he's
[32:34] more subtle and he like i said before he
[32:36] offers a boyfriend or a girlfriend
[32:39] that likes those kind of things
[32:42] they're mostly nice right they're mostly
[32:44] good kids
[32:45] that's the devil's subtle approach
[32:48] oh it couldn't be
[32:50] a boyfriend or a girlfriend they they
[32:52] really like me they really care about me
[32:53] they do
[32:57] or or a worldly friend that you get
[33:00] equally yoked together with
[33:04] someone that's but they're your buddy
[33:05] and they really understand you and they
[33:07] get you
[33:10] and it's so subtle and the next thing
[33:12] you know you're
[33:13] going down a road that you
[33:15] never even intended to go down
[33:20] so the devil will
[33:22] you know that the devil makes a plan god
[33:25] has a plan for your life
[33:28] the devil makes a plan to destroy you to
[33:30] take you out
[33:34] he's done it to me he did it to me
[33:37] i'll talk about that more when i testify
[33:39] tonight about
[33:40] how the lord delivered me
[33:42] but
[33:45] 99.9 of times when a believer gets in a
[33:49] relationship with an unbeliever
[33:51] it's the unbeliever that's influencing
[33:53] the believer away from the word
[33:56] the believer is just meekly
[33:59] meekly following that along
[34:01] not saying anything not taking a stand
[34:04] and the next thing you know
[34:07] they're they're off on the wrong
[34:08] direction
[34:10] on the wrong path
[34:12] second corinthians 6 14
[34:15] be not unequally yoked together with
[34:17] unbelievers
[34:18] for what fellowship has righteousness
[34:21] with unrighteousness and what communion
[34:23] has light with darkness
[34:27] and what concord has christ with belial
[34:30] or what part hath he that believeth with
[34:32] an infidel and what agreement has the
[34:35] temple of god with idols
[34:37] for you are the temple of the living god
[34:40] as god has said i will dwell in them and
[34:42] walk in them and i will be their god and
[34:45] they shall be my people
[34:48] wherefore come out from among them and
[34:50] be separate saith the lord and touch not
[34:53] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[34:55] and will be a father unto you and you
[34:57] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[35:00] lord almighty
[35:03] so
[35:06] what does it mean
[35:09] to not be unequally yoked together with
[35:10] unbelievers well
[35:12] it doesn't mean that we have to join a
[35:14] monastery
[35:16] and go out in the world and never be
[35:17] around an unbeliever or never
[35:20] have a friend who is an unbeliever
[35:23] it's not what it means
[35:25] but to be unequally yoked there's a
[35:28] scripture just grab that
[35:33] deuteronomy 22 10 says thou shalt not
[35:36] plow
[35:37] with an ox
[35:39] and an ass together
[35:43] so it's
[35:45] it's it's a cooperation together where
[35:48] you're
[35:49] equal you're it's a business partnership
[35:52] it's a marriage
[35:53] it's a date it's a dating relationship
[35:56] it's a it's a friendship where both are
[35:59] equally influencing each other an
[36:01] unbeliever and a believer
[36:04] just to give a
[36:06] further testimony when i
[36:09] first got saved
[36:11] the lord changed my life he changed my
[36:13] desires
[36:14] but he didn't change my friends
[36:16] automatically
[36:18] that was up to me
[36:20] to do something about that
[36:24] and
[36:24] so i wanted to win my friends to christ
[36:28] but the problem was
[36:30] i didn't
[36:32] i just started talking to them
[36:34] i didn't tell them
[36:36] the whole picture the whole story and
[36:38] what my vision was
[36:40] for our friendship moving forward
[36:43] and because of that i ended up going to
[36:45] a party
[36:47] i ended up
[36:48] getting in a fight
[36:52] things that baby christians do because
[36:54] they're they they're not armed with
[36:57] the knowledge or the maturity to know if
[36:59] i do this then step
[37:01] five
[37:02] is a step that i don't want to
[37:06] take so as a
[37:09] as a young man 21 years old
[37:11] i went to a
[37:14] charismatic mega church my sister was
[37:16] going to i hadn't been introduced to the
[37:17] message yet
[37:20] so at the charismatic church
[37:22] the minister took this scripture and
[37:25] just gave a real
[37:27] basic description of how do you apply
[37:30] this as a new believer
[37:32] and so he said
[37:34] and it
[37:35] it astounds me because it was just
[37:38] totally discernment i was talking about
[37:39] that to my
[37:40] brother-in-law
[37:42] before the service what i was struggling
[37:44] with
[37:44] and here this preacher
[37:47] speaks exactly what to do
[37:49] that was that was the lord for me
[37:52] and he's he says bring your friend take
[37:54] your friends and and get together with
[37:56] them
[37:57] and speak to them and say i'm a
[37:58] christian now
[38:01] the lord has changed my life my desire
[38:03] is to live
[38:04] for him and to glorify him
[38:07] with my life in the past we would go to
[38:10] parties together we would smoke
[38:12] marijuana together we would drink
[38:14] together
[38:15] now
[38:16] i don't want to do that anymore
[38:19] you know i don't want to go to the club
[38:21] i don't want to
[38:22] i went down the list specific things
[38:24] that me and this person would do
[38:26] together
[38:27] now i want to be your friend still but
[38:31] but
[38:32] i don't want you to try to get me
[38:36] to do those things anymore
[38:38] i would like you to help me
[38:41] uh
[38:42] continue with the vision that i have for
[38:44] my life which is to be a christian
[38:47] and to get more like christ so if you
[38:50] would like to continue
[38:52] being friends on that level
[38:54] then that's great well i did that every
[38:56] friend of course said oh of course yes i
[38:59] will
[39:00] and they all
[39:03] vanished except for one friend
[39:06] and he would help me and encourage me to
[39:08] not
[39:08] do the things that we used to do
[39:10] together
[39:11] so then you find that's what you do
[39:13] that's the steps that you take to find
[39:15] out
[39:16] who's a real friend
[39:18] then you can go from there now you're
[39:20] not there now you're not unequally yoked
[39:23] now you now you are an influence on them
[39:26] and you're telling them you be a good
[39:27] influence on me
[39:29] if you're not gonna be a good influence
[39:30] on me then we can't be friends
[39:33] and that's okay we'll shake hands and
[39:35] and hug and part ways
[39:37] that's okay
[39:40] but then you now you're
[39:42] doing it god's way
[39:44] you know if you if you say i i'm i'm
[39:46] going to date this person so i can win
[39:48] them to christ
[39:50] you don't disobey god's word
[39:53] in order to bring a good outcome
[39:56] i think the apostle paul
[39:58] says in
[39:59] romans
[40:01] 3 8 he says and not rather as we slan as
[40:03] we be slanderously reported
[40:06] and as some affirm that we say
[40:08] let us do evil that good may come
[40:11] whose damnation is just
[40:13] oh i'm gonna i'm gonna disobey god's
[40:15] word so that somebody will obey god's
[40:17] word
[40:21] how does that
[40:22] work why do you think that would work
[40:26] yet people do
[40:28] it's common
[40:29] message believers
[40:31] denominational people all that it's
[40:33] common way of thinking
[40:36] it doesn't work
[40:38] 99.9 of the time
[40:41] i have seen people that got saved but
[40:43] the person that was
[40:44] in that situation but the person that
[40:47] was a message believer and the person
[40:49] that was not a message believer person
[40:50] message believer the whole relationship
[40:52] was started because they were witnessing
[40:53] witnessing witnessing witnessing
[40:56] and all of a sudden they're like
[40:58] are we dating
[41:00] i
[41:00] i don't know
[41:02] and then they accept the message get
[41:04] baptized and a little bit later they're
[41:06] married
[41:08] but the whole relationship was founded
[41:10] on
[41:11] i'm trying to i'm winning this person to
[41:12] christ it wasn't
[41:14] oh i'll get in a relationship and we'll
[41:16] try to win them to christ
[41:19] no
[41:20] it's not going to work like that
[41:22] so i'm i'm not saying it's not possible
[41:26] but don't put yourself in a position
[41:29] where you're seeking to disobey god's
[41:31] word to bring something good to pass
[41:40] again
[41:43] bondage
[41:44] versus freedom
[41:46] satan's offer of freedom
[41:49] is bon is a continuation
[41:52] of the bondage that you're already in
[41:55] from your birth
[41:57] god's offer
[41:59] of freedom
[42:01] again it's a freedom
[42:03] that's
[42:05] what what is what is it freedom
[42:08] i think that's a
[42:10] that's a thing that a young person say
[42:11] what do you mean freedom i'm told to not
[42:13] do this i'm told not to do that i'm told
[42:15] not to do this yes that would be your
[42:16] perspective without the holy ghost
[42:20] it's a bunch of rules it's a bunch of
[42:23] set things that i have to follow
[42:26] well it's that's because you're you're
[42:29] starting from a wrong way of thinking
[42:32] you're already
[42:33] under the law of sin and death
[42:38] you're born that way until you get the
[42:40] holy ghost
[42:41] that's the condition you are even in a
[42:44] godly home you're doing the right things
[42:46] making the right choices under the right
[42:48] influences
[42:49] without the spirit of god
[42:51] you're under the law of sin and death
[42:54] and so
[42:56] when the devil is working on your flesh
[42:59] he's going to bring he's going to bring
[43:01] this direction to your life in order to
[43:03] further that process in other words keep
[43:06] you under the law of sin and death
[43:09] keep you in bondage his offering of
[43:12] freedom to you
[43:13] as simply a ploy to keep you under his
[43:17] control
[43:18] and so god is saying i'm going to set
[43:20] you free
[43:22] i'm going to make you i'm going to
[43:24] deliver you
[43:26] romans 6 18
[43:27] being then made free
[43:29] from sin you became the servants of
[43:32] righteousness
[43:34] paul says i speak after the manner of
[43:36] men because of the infirmity of your
[43:38] flesh for as you have yielded your
[43:40] members servants to uncleanness
[43:43] into iniquity unto iniquity even so now
[43:46] yield your members servants to
[43:48] righteousness unto holiness
[43:52] for when you are the servants of sin you
[43:53] were free from righteousness
[43:56] what fruit had ye then
[43:58] in those things whereof you are now
[44:00] ashamed
[44:01] for the end of those things is death
[44:04] but now being made free from sin and
[44:07] become servants to god
[44:08] you have your fruit unto holiness and
[44:11] the end everlasting life
[44:15] so you see what god is offering and what
[44:17] satan is offering satan is offering
[44:20] continuation in sin and death
[44:23] you say well i haven't i haven't got
[44:24] seen the fruits of that because you're
[44:26] under the right influence right now
[44:29] but you get out of that influence you'll
[44:31] be in you'll be under that commandment
[44:34] which is the law of sin and death
[44:37] get set free now
[44:39] don't wait until you have a whole lot of
[44:41] baggage and garbage in your life
[44:44] get set free today
[44:48] don't leave the church today under
[44:49] bondage leave it free
[44:54] and paul says what kind of fruit did you
[44:57] have what what what did your life
[45:00] produce
[45:01] when you were under bondage to the devil
[45:04] what was the results that you had in
[45:06] your life
[45:07] but now you've been changed what's the
[45:09] results you see now in your life
[45:11] and so young people look at that
[45:14] all of us
[45:15] look at that example what what are the
[45:17] fruits that you're seeing between the
[45:19] fruits of an unbelieving life and the
[45:22] fruits of a believing life and don't say
[45:23] i'm an exception to the rule
[45:27] there's not any
[45:32] romans 8 2
[45:34] for the law of the spirit of life in
[45:36] christ jesus has made me free from the
[45:40] law of sin and death
[45:43] it is
[45:44] it is not growing up in a message home
[45:47] it's not growing up uh under the right
[45:50] influences that makes you free from the
[45:51] law of sin and death
[45:53] it's the spirit of the lord
[45:56] it's the spirit of god coming in your
[45:58] life by the baptism of fire
[46:01] cleaning you out changing you that sets
[46:03] you free
[46:04] from that law of sin and death
[46:08] no amount of teaching no amount of
[46:10] influence from the outside is going to
[46:12] do it it has to be the spirit of god in
[46:15] you
[46:17] then you're free
[46:19] second corinthians 3 13
[46:21] and not as moses
[46:23] which put a veil over his face that the
[46:25] children of israel could not steadfastly
[46:28] look to the end of that which is
[46:30] abolished
[46:31] so we're talking still talking about
[46:33] freedom we're talking about liberty
[46:36] but their minds were blinded for until
[46:39] this day
[46:40] remain at the same veil untaken away in
[46:43] the reading of the old testament which
[46:44] veil is done away in christ
[46:47] but even unto this day when moses is
[46:48] read the veil is upon their heart
[46:51] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[46:53] lord the veil shall be taken away when
[46:56] it the heart shall turn to the lord now
[46:59] the lord is that spirit
[47:01] and where the spirit of the lord is
[47:03] there is liberty
[47:05] we hear that verse
[47:07] and we get so excited and people shout
[47:09] and
[47:10] dance but what is that
[47:12] what is liberty what is the freedom
[47:14] where the spirit of the lord is
[47:17] verse 18 but we all
[47:19] with open face with unveiled face
[47:23] beholding as in a glass in a mirror this
[47:26] is amazing
[47:27] we with unveiled face looking in a
[47:29] mirror
[47:31] at the glory of the lord
[47:34] now now the glory of the lord is not
[47:36] just in moses the glory of lords and you
[47:39] and you're looking in a mirror and
[47:40] seeing the glory of the lord and you're
[47:42] changed into that same image from glory
[47:45] to glory so what is liberty
[47:48] what is freedom
[47:49] it's being delivered from blindness
[47:53] it's being it's being set free so that
[47:55] when you look at moses you say i can't
[47:57] look at moses i can't even look at him
[48:00] no now now it's different now that
[48:02] pillar of fire that's is broken apart
[48:04] now it's in you
[48:06] it's dwelling in you and your the veil
[48:08] is off and you can see the lord face to
[48:10] face
[48:11] and now you're changed to be exactly
[48:13] like him
[48:14] that's freedom
[48:17] that's liberty
[48:19] freedom is not choosing whatever we want
[48:21] to choose doing whatever we want to do
[48:23] that's bondage
[48:27] we want true freedom true freedom what
[48:29] is true freedom
[48:31] it's to live the way
[48:33] god
[48:34] created man to live
[48:36] to be his expression his manifestation
[48:40] his image and likeness to the world and
[48:43] when you live like that in total
[48:45] submission
[48:47] submission and freedom
[48:48] can exist together
[48:50] at the same time
[48:53] if you're a philosopher if you have a
[48:54] philosophy degree which i do sorry
[48:59] if you hear that you say it can't be it
[49:01] it is
[49:03] it is because when you're in in
[49:05] serving the lord when you're a slave of
[49:08] jesus christ you never feel better
[49:11] you never feel more free you never feel
[49:14] more powerful
[49:17] than when you're in that condition
[49:23] brother branham says
[49:25] in the sermon abraham's covenant
[49:26] confirmed
[49:28] in in the garden of eden the devil chose
[49:30] a part of a man and god
[49:33] chose a part god chose his heart
[49:35] the devil chose his intellect
[49:40] i've got just a couple more screens i'm
[49:41] not going to be able to finish but i'll
[49:44] just get through a few more
[49:45] of these quotes and we'll we'll close
[49:48] so in 1959 looking at the unseen brother
[49:51] branham says when god made man he made
[49:53] him thus
[49:54] for he made this little certain
[49:56] compartment in the man for his own
[49:58] throne
[49:59] his control tower
[50:01] god wants to lead man but mad but man
[50:05] wants to lead himself
[50:08] therefore
[50:09] there is a war
[50:11] constantly
[50:15] the man wants to go after what he sees
[50:17] with his eyes
[50:18] that's where he's deceived
[50:20] that's where satan deceived eve what she
[50:23] could see
[50:24] the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it
[50:26] was death to the soul
[50:29] so is it tonight god wants to lead man
[50:31] so he made himself a little control
[50:34] tower in the midst of his heart so that
[50:36] man would be led by the spirit of god
[50:39] getting off on his own leading
[50:42] is what separated him from his
[50:44] fellowship
[50:48] young people
[50:49] you're going through if you're going
[50:50] through adolescence
[50:52] this is god's process
[50:54] to take you
[50:56] from being a little kid being governed
[50:57] by your parents
[50:59] to being a grown person that's led by
[51:02] the lord
[51:03] notice what i just said
[51:06] i didn't say that you would be free and
[51:08] to choose whatever you want to do
[51:11] i hope if
[51:12] i hope you choose
[51:14] to follow god but when you choose to
[51:15] follow god
[51:16] you're laying down choice
[51:20] because you know that your choice leads
[51:22] to bondage
[51:23] that's why brother bam says there's a
[51:25] war going on there's a war between what
[51:28] god's way and man's way
[51:30] which when we understand it what's man's
[51:32] way satan's leadership
[51:35] when jesus rebukes peter
[51:37] what does he say what does he tell the
[51:38] devil get behind me satan
[51:41] for you savor not the things of god but
[51:44] the things that be of men
[51:46] so satan's leadership was to savor the
[51:48] things of men not the things of god
[51:51] and god's
[51:52] purpose for peter was that he would
[51:54] savor jesus christ
[51:56] and not the religious way of thinking
[51:59] for that day
[52:01] and so he's getting off on his own
[52:03] leading his own idea and that separates
[52:06] the fellowship between god
[52:08] and man
[52:10] christian life 101 everybody young
[52:12] people listen up this is number one
[52:16] of christian life is you did not get to
[52:19] choose your own way
[52:22] married people
[52:24] if you're fussing at each other over
[52:26] what to do
[52:27] you're looking at the wrong thing
[52:30] it isn't about that it's about
[52:32] discerning the will of god
[52:34] we don't get to make our own choices
[52:38] when you're fight
[52:40] i've seen it in counseling so many times
[52:42] they're fussing and fighting i said wait
[52:44] a minute
[52:46] do you think you get to choose to do
[52:48] whatever you want to do
[52:52] no we don't think that oh okay good
[52:55] because you don't
[52:58] you have to pray
[53:00] and seek to find the will of god
[53:03] if you do that together husband and wife
[53:06] the only disagreement is
[53:08] are we waiting on the lord long enough
[53:10] is this the timing right
[53:11] are we hearing from him together
[53:14] as a young person that's what you that's
[53:17] that's the secret sauce
[53:22] learn that
[53:23] you're growing up you want to make your
[53:26] own choices okay god put that inside of
[53:29] you
[53:30] to do that but not to make your own
[53:32] choices in that sense he put that in you
[53:35] so that you would graduate
[53:37] to following the leadership of the holy
[53:39] spirit for your life
[53:42] so don't don't get it to the thing i
[53:44] mean if you if you look at insurance
[53:46] policies
[53:47] when you turn 25
[53:49] the price goes down right why is that
[53:52] it's because
[53:54] sorry
[53:55] 22 year olds 23 year olds
[53:59] because you're i don't know this all the
[54:01] science behind it but the wires in your
[54:04] brain aren't fully formed yet until
[54:06] you're 25.
[54:08] sorry gideon
[54:11] the wires aren't fully formed until
[54:13] you're 25 so they they're like you can't
[54:16] make great decisions
[54:17] so you pay more for insurance
[54:21] and i would say the same goes as for the
[54:24] christian life
[54:25] if you're not if
[54:27] if you're in this process of graduating
[54:30] from
[54:31] being led by mom and dad to being led by
[54:33] the spirit of god in your own life
[54:35] understand understand it's not about
[54:38] what you want it's about learning to
[54:41] hear the lord's voice for yourself
[54:44] and that's the beautiful thing the
[54:46] lord's trying to do and parents teach
[54:49] them
[54:50] that's your job at this point in time
[54:53] is that scriptural
[54:54] is that according to scripture
[54:56] did you pray about that
[54:59] we have to remind each other my wife has
[55:01] to remind me about that
[55:03] brother branham's wife had to remind him
[55:05] about that did you pray about that
[55:07] no i didn't
[55:08] so
[55:09] let's
[55:10] slow down and pray about it
[55:14] and so
[55:16] i think
[55:18] i'm going to ask the musicians to come
[55:21] and just have one two more screens left
[55:24] that i want to show and then we'll
[55:28] finish it up
[55:29] so
[55:30] the devil's offering if you want to go
[55:32] to the next slide thank you
[55:35] the devil is offering to be free
[55:38] be happy
[55:39] follow your heart now
[55:42] he's coming to you from the outside in
[55:45] he's focusing on first your senses
[55:48] and then
[55:49] he's focusing on your mind because he
[55:52] knows if he can control
[55:53] from the outside it's going to produce
[55:56] unbelief in your soul
[55:58] so if he can manipulate you to look from
[56:01] the outside from your flesh from your
[56:04] mind
[56:05] then he has grabbed control of your life
[56:11] and so
[56:12] when you're growing up at any stage of
[56:14] our lives understand that this is what
[56:17] the devil's going to continually do
[56:19] look at your flesh
[56:21] look at the things of your mind
[56:24] follow that
[56:25] look at that he's constantly attacking
[56:28] every christian to look at life from
[56:31] that perspective
[56:33] because he doesn't want us to have he
[56:35] doesn't want us to believe god if we
[56:36] believe god
[56:37] then he's powerless
[56:40] so he comes at continually bombarding
[56:42] our flesh didn't you see how that person
[56:45] didn't get healed right away and didn't
[56:47] you see how that person
[56:49] suffered and didn't you see what
[56:51] happened to you
[56:52] sees working on your imagination
[56:54] didn't you didn't you look oh your
[56:56] friend that you love so much and this
[56:58] happened
[56:59] stop looking at that and look at the
[57:01] word
[57:03] with eyes of faith
[57:04] because god wants to govern you
[57:06] from the inside out
[57:10] with faith and the power of the holy
[57:12] spirit on the inside so that when these
[57:15] thoughts of looking at
[57:17] things from the outside in
[57:20] the devil's going after your flesh
[57:22] by faith you can put the enemy to flight
[57:26] and you can say it's not about me
[57:28] not about what i want to do it's about
[57:30] discerning the will of the lord
[57:33] it's about finding his purpose
[57:36] that's what it's about jesus came to
[57:38] that victory in his life he was made
[57:40] perfect
[57:41] through suffering right he was made
[57:43] complete through suffering the same
[57:45] thing happens to us we get trials we get
[57:48] hard things in life and we have to
[57:50] decide am i going to follow what i want
[57:52] to do or am i going to say not my will
[57:55] but thine be done
[57:57] amen let's stand
[58:03] the lord is offering us freedom
[58:07] but real freedom is being
[58:09] led by the spirit of god with a burning
[58:12] desire and passion to be walking in his
[58:15] perfect will
[58:17] amen let's pray
[58:20] heavenly father we just
[58:22] come to you lord and we ask that your
[58:24] holy spirit would just
[58:27] just brood over your people
[58:30] lord that you would come now and even
[58:34] speak speak in their heart
[58:37] maybe there's something in their life
[58:39] that
[58:40] satan's been working on them and
[58:42] he's got a plan to
[58:44] bring destruction and hurt and sorrow in
[58:47] their lives
[58:50] we asked lord that you would defeat the
[58:52] enemy
[58:53] in their lives that that they would that
[58:55] faith would rise up
[58:58] in their heart
[59:00] and they would say
[59:02] lord i'm yours i belong to you
[59:06] i'm not going to go my own way
[59:07] i'm coming to you
[59:10] lord anyone might be here that
[59:13] hasn't yet received the holy ghost
[59:15] whatever age they might be
[59:19] i pray lord you'd pour your spirit into
[59:21] their heart lord
[59:23] that you would change them from the
[59:24] inside out
[59:28] that your power would be manifested in
[59:30] their lives
[59:33] lord we cannot do it it's it's not it
[59:35] doesn't come by
[59:38] a great emotion lord though emotion
[59:40] accompanies it
