[0:00] his family dave and them are headed out
[0:01] tomorrow i don't haven't heard the whole
[0:03] story but man we just i just hugged his
[0:05] neck and now he's heaven out and i'm
[0:06] back in town but brother davis good to
[0:08] have you and uh with us and your mom
[0:10] greet your mom for us and maybe we can
[0:13] get a coffee or something before you go
[0:14] but we appreciate you all and
[0:16] bring your dad with you next time we'd
[0:18] love to have the rest of the romero
[0:19] family praise the lord
[0:21] john 3 16.
[0:24] everybody going to quote it because you
[0:25] know it wait a minute don't put it up
[0:27] there everybody knows this one
[0:32] for god so loved the world that he gave
[0:34] his only begotten son that whosoever
[0:37] believeth in him
[0:39] should not perish but have everlasting
[0:41] life for god sent not his son into the
[0:44] world to condemn the world
[0:46] but that the world through him might be
[0:49] saved
[0:50] he that believeth on him is not
[0:52] condemned
[0:53] but he that believeth not is condemned
[0:56] already because he hath not believed in
[0:59] the name of the only begotten son of god
[1:01] so believing is really important and
[1:03] this ministry comes of his son when he
[1:06] sends his son it's not to bring
[1:08] condemnation but it's actually to bring
[1:10] salvation
[1:12] so but as the scriptures continue verse
[1:15] 19 and this is the condemnation
[1:17] that light is come into the world and
[1:20] men loved darkness rather than light
[1:23] because
[1:24] their deeds were evil so it's it's not
[1:27] just his so somebody could just read
[1:29] john 3 16
[1:31] and a lot of the church world and goes
[1:33] on that scripture we believe it with all
[1:35] our heart that he loved us enough to
[1:37] send his only begotten son
[1:39] but when he comes it's not just his son
[1:41] now you read and the scriptures are
[1:43] continuing light is coming with him
[1:46] so with his son comes light
[1:49] you see so you can try to accept the sun
[1:51] that was here
[1:53] thousand years ago and lived here had
[1:55] him under thirty three and a half years
[1:56] and three and a half years of ministry
[1:58] you can keep looking back to that but
[1:59] when he sends a son he sends light
[2:02] and the light is for the darkness in
[2:04] your life
[2:05] the light is to to shine and expose
[2:07] everything that's dark
[2:10] so when you start preaching that then
[2:12] you wonder some people back off from the
[2:13] sun and back off from why but i accept
[2:16] his son but you got to accept all of it
[2:18] when he comes when the sun is there
[2:20] there's light shining and exposes
[2:23] darkness
[2:24] amen and he said here he said that this
[2:27] is the condemnation that light is coming
[2:29] to the world his son comes how many know
[2:31] that his son actually is the revealed
[2:33] word of every hour it's not jesus of
[2:36] nazareth not just him 2000 years ago
[2:38] every time his son is revealed in every
[2:40] age it's the revealed word of the age
[2:42] and it's light where there's darkness
[2:45] but he says the reason they don't like
[2:46] the darkness is they love darkness
[2:48] rather than light they're not used to it
[2:50] because their deeds were evil it exposes
[2:52] their deeds for everyone that doeth evil
[2:55] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[2:57] light lest his deeds should be
[3:00] reproved that's what the light does
[3:03] amen so
[3:05] i want his son
[3:06] but i don't want the light
[3:09] it doesn't work that way
[3:11] it doesn't work that way i want the son
[3:14] the begotten son the lord jesus
[3:16] but i don't want my life exposed in the
[3:18] darkness
[3:20] it doesn't work that way
[3:22] look at this scripture that i found
[3:24] today verse 21 but he that doeth truth
[3:28] cometh to the light
[3:30] in other words they're not running from
[3:32] the light they're actually running
[3:34] towards it
[3:35] they're coming to the light they're not
[3:37] afraid of the light
[3:40] that his his deeds
[3:42] may be manifest that they are wrought
[3:45] and god in a little bit i'll read that
[3:47] in the amplified but what a powerful
[3:49] scripture he that doeth truth cometh to
[3:51] the light that his deeds may be made
[3:54] manifest that they are wrought in god
[3:58] amen heavenly father blessed us tonight
[4:01] and we're so happy to be home back with
[4:03] our family here
[4:05] and lord jesus we pray you'll bless the
[4:07] word we feel your presence here tonight
[4:09] we pray you'll bless this uh time in the
[4:11] word tonight and bless those who are
[4:13] sick my stick my assistant brother
[4:15] brandon give him speedy healing lord for
[4:18] his surgery had today on his nose that
[4:20] you just give him speedy healing and may
[4:22] it correct the issues and problems and
[4:25] god i just pray that bless all any
[4:26] others who are out sick tonight i just
[4:29] pray you help them give them strength we
[4:30] commit the service to you now in jesus
[4:33] name amen amen you may be seated
[4:37] i thought it might be good to teach some
[4:39] scriptures here tonight
[4:41] and talk a little bit about the subject
[4:43] of accountability
[4:46] and accountability
[4:48] would be related to the series that
[4:50] we're talking about on sundays which is
[4:53] on authority we're taking authority from
[4:55] different avenues and different things
[4:57] in the scriptures so that we can
[4:59] understand god's true authority and what
[5:01] to bring our lives underneath but i want
[5:03] to talk in relation to this on the
[5:06] subject of accountability and maybe this
[5:08] is just another way another avenue or
[5:11] angle to look at authority looking at
[5:13] the subject of accountability and maybe
[5:15] tonight look at it just a little bit in
[5:17] a practical way because it's wednesday
[5:18] night and just a little bit more
[5:20] teaching way we'll see how the lord
[5:22] leads this
[5:23] i certainly believe in a that a
[5:25] christian
[5:26] i believe in a christian being
[5:28] accountable
[5:30] i believe a christian is an accountable
[5:33] uh if they're a christian they're
[5:34] accountable
[5:35] and not only under the obedience of
[5:38] god's word they're accountable to the
[5:39] obedience of god the word but also what
[5:42] god puts in their lives as delegated
[5:45] authority and if you learned a little
[5:47] bit through the series on authority you
[5:49] realize that god
[5:51] deposits
[5:52] or gives his authority in each
[5:54] generation he always has it on earth
[5:56] because he has to give his people
[5:58] direction he has to give his people
[6:00] leadership he never leaves his people
[6:02] without leadership and with that
[6:05] leadership comes power and comes
[6:06] authority and uh satan's actually afraid
[6:09] of it
[6:10] so it's not just that he brings a
[6:12] preacher and he's just bringing
[6:14] intellectual words with god's when god
[6:17] sends something it has his authority
[6:19] with it it has his power with it and
[6:22] demons are already afraid of it and
[6:24] actually only the predestinated are
[6:26] called to come under submission to it
[6:27] and say that's god's authority i'm
[6:29] bringing my life under it only the elect
[6:31] because the rest of them resist
[6:33] and so now i believe in authority and i
[6:36] believe also an accountability in the
[6:37] christian's life to not only the word of
[6:39] god but also god's delegated authority
[6:42] and as i've said to you many times
[6:44] people run away from authority any
[6:46] authority because authority has been
[6:48] abused even sometimes in our own ranks
[6:51] authority has been abused so people get
[6:53] afraid of it but we must not let the
[6:56] devil misuse or misinterpret something
[6:59] that would be powerful for us so
[7:02] and the way that
[7:04] that accountability works is is and and
[7:06] there's there's a lot of things to it
[7:08] but some things that we already know
[7:10] every man will be accountable
[7:12] in the end for his decision someday
[7:16] so if you're if you're not accountable
[7:18] to the word now
[7:19] eventually everyone will be accountable
[7:21] on judgment day
[7:23] everyone will give an answer can you say
[7:25] amen brother branham says that everyone
[7:27] will be accountable to the word that's
[7:29] been given them in their lifetime
[7:31] everybody will be accountable so so
[7:33] you're not gonna even if you get away
[7:35] and run away from accountability here
[7:37] you're not gonna run away someday
[7:40] because everybody will be accountable
[7:41] for the actions everybody about be
[7:43] accountable for their sins for me uh god
[7:46] gave a a sacrifice at calvary for my
[7:49] sins and i would rather believe in him
[7:51] and put those mistakes and sins on the
[7:54] sacrifice he gave for it than to meet it
[7:57] at judgment day and try to answer for
[7:58] myself
[7:59] [Applause]
[8:01] i would rather accept his blood
[8:02] sacrifice from my mistakes but every man
[8:05] every knee shall bow every tongue shall
[8:08] confess that jesus is lord if they
[8:10] resist it now someday every man becomes
[8:13] accountable and you remember brother
[8:15] brahma says what do we judge the world
[8:17] by your opinion my opinion what
[8:19] denomination do we judge it by what
[8:21] interpretation he said he'll judge the
[8:23] world by one thing and that's the word
[8:26] of god everybody comes underneath that
[8:28] standard
[8:29] and so so in in the dictionary
[8:32] accountability means accountable means
[8:35] required or expected to justify actions
[8:38] or decisions so you're required or
[8:41] you're expected to justify
[8:44] your actions or justify your decisions
[8:46] this is like a steward a stewardship or
[8:48] a boss over something is the as the
[8:50] owner has placed a suit and stewardship
[8:52] and jesus talked about this you know i
[8:54] put a hundred employees under under you
[8:56] and you're to manage them and you're
[8:58] supposed to make take the money and make
[9:00] something out of it and so in a year's
[9:02] time we have the steward has to be
[9:04] accountable to when the owner comes and
[9:06] says okay what did you do with my money
[9:08] the steward has to give an account for
[9:10] what he's done with what he has and this
[9:12] is a principle in the bible whatever god
[9:14] has handed here it is too much is given
[9:19] much is required
[9:21] so everybody's going to have an account
[9:23] everybody's going to be required
[9:24] something and especially if god gives us
[9:27] something today will be someday we'll be
[9:29] accountable for what god gives us
[9:32] you tell me how much the bride of christ
[9:34] is has been how much has been placed in
[9:37] our hands
[9:39] and to whom and much is given how many
[9:41] could raise your hand and say
[9:43] much has been given to me
[9:45] spiritually i'm a spiritual millionaire
[9:48] i'm not naturally at all but in in
[9:51] in in the spirit i'm a billionaire
[9:54] billions of dollars like trump used to
[9:56] say it he always says billions and he
[9:59] always talks in billions because he's a
[10:01] billionaire and i love how he says this
[10:03] is billions everything's but it's never
[10:05] dollars you know it's billions
[10:09] but he's not a spiritual billionaire
[10:12] we're spiritual billionaires here
[10:13] tonight and we may not have married much
[10:15] in this life may never have that much
[10:17] but i'm telling you we're rich people
[10:18] and to whom much is given much is
[10:20] required
[10:22] so it's not just required of being a
[10:24] witness and telling people about jesus
[10:26] but in our character if he's given so
[10:29] much of his word then much character in
[10:31] response
[10:32] that's required of us can you say amen
[10:34] so so all through the scripture we have
[10:36] this thing of being accountable
[10:38] something that's required and expected
[10:40] to justify our actions and decisions and
[10:42] often though this is after decisions
[10:44] we've already made tonight i'd like to
[10:47] talk about a little deeper in a deeper
[10:49] level to to expose yourself to the word
[10:53] and to godly counsel
[10:55] to to be accountable to the word of god
[10:58] and and godly counsel
[11:01] before
[11:02] decisions are made
[11:05] now the the accountability meant to
[11:07] required or expected to justify actions
[11:09] or decisions a lot of those are already
[11:11] made but what would it be if we say i
[11:13] want to be accountable i'd love to start
[11:15] living more of my life that i would be
[11:17] accountable that god could weigh in on
[11:20] the word could weigh in on before i make
[11:23] decisions so that my decisions are
[11:26] influenced by the word of god and by
[11:28] godly counsel
[11:30] i can tell you there's not a lot of
[11:32] people on the face of this earth that
[11:34] are doing any of that
[11:36] especially because we live in the spirit
[11:38] of laodicea
[11:40] which laodicea means
[11:42] people's rights
[11:46] amen
[11:48] so we don't see a lot of accountability
[11:50] to the word of god we don't see i'm
[11:53] going to be under the influence of the
[11:54] word from my decisions and i'm gonna
[11:56] seek out god's delegated authority and
[11:59] seek out some help in some godly people
[12:01] in order to make my decisions before i
[12:03] do it i'm gonna do we just don't see a
[12:04] lot of it and i'm gonna step out on a
[12:06] limb and say in my in my pastoring years
[12:10] i haven't seen a huge amount of that
[12:12] within the church and young people
[12:15] and yet i'm still going to teach it that
[12:17] it's a big biblical principle that you
[12:19] live a christian life accountable to the
[12:22] word of god influenced by the word of
[12:24] god and that you seek godly counsel
[12:28] got a ton of scriptures here for it and
[12:30] may if we don't get them tonight we'll
[12:32] get to them next wednesday night but
[12:33] listen accountability is is something
[12:36] that you want in your life as a
[12:38] christian you young people
[12:39] make it a a principle in your life of
[12:42] accountability don't be a lone ranger
[12:44] don't be i'm going to do this on my own
[12:46] say i want god's presence i want god's
[12:48] input i want god to influence my
[12:52] decisions
[12:55] so that's when we're really getting deep
[12:56] into
[12:58] the subject of accountability so you
[13:00] know we have lived
[13:02] with the results
[13:04] let me just ask it this way how many has
[13:06] lived with the results of poor decisions
[13:08] in your life
[13:14] i got i got all my
[13:16] my feet up and everything
[13:18] we we know what that means
[13:21] to live with the fruit of poor decisions
[13:24] and then you reap what you sow and all
[13:27] that principle goes and so we
[13:29] we some decisions we made privately and
[13:32] eventually they got exposed openly and
[13:34] it's embarrassing
[13:36] but their decisions that we made and a
[13:37] lot of them are without counsel without
[13:39] the holy spirit leadership
[13:41] without uh anyone inputting without the
[13:43] word of god we just made them for
[13:45] whatever reason and so we got in a
[13:47] little trouble you know and sometimes
[13:49] big trouble we've lived with the results
[13:51] of poor decisions we have made
[13:53] and we experienced the lessons learned
[13:55] through that how many would raise your
[13:56] hand and say i experienced lessons
[13:58] learned through making decisions too
[14:00] quickly and wrong without god's counsel
[14:03] we have learned that we reap the fruit
[14:05] of it and we we learn what that feels
[14:07] like to reap the fruit of our decisions
[14:10] without god and also
[14:12] then praise the lord we experience
[14:15] something through that and that's the
[14:16] forgiveness of god and the washing to
[14:19] forgive us of our wrong actions and our
[14:22] wrong decisions how many can raise your
[14:23] hand and i say i've experienced the
[14:25] forgiveness and the washing of god from
[14:28] bad decisions that i made didn't even
[14:30] deserve god to forgive me of it i did it
[14:33] it was all me i'm owning up to it and
[14:36] yet god in his grace forgave me
[14:38] washed it away can you say amen and as
[14:40] even restoring what i broke down he's
[14:43] restoring it back again
[14:45] we don't deserve that but his power can
[14:47] do it
[14:48] praise the lord
[14:50] let's give the lord a hand for his
[14:51] restorative work in our lives amen
[14:55] all of us have been blessed to see that
[14:59] made decisions and financial decisions
[15:01] 15 years ago i ended up with 10 rental
[15:03] properties within a year
[15:05] and some of them i just didn't seek
[15:07] enough counts on didn't buy them in the
[15:09] right places didn't do the right thing
[15:11] didn't read enough up on it and maybe
[15:13] didn't pray enough i don't know what all
[15:14] turned out but listen it's you know i've
[15:17] shared the testimony to you then you
[15:19] look at the mess that you've made
[15:21] and you you're like abraham
[15:24] ishmael was the mess that he and his
[15:25] wife had made
[15:27] and abraham tries to get god to accept
[15:29] his his mess his mistake
[15:32] and he lifts ishmael up said oh
[15:35] could it be ishmael oh that ishmael
[15:37] might live before you and god says no no
[15:41] i've got the promised son isaac
[15:43] i promise something else can you say man
[15:46] so we we bring those things and i've
[15:48] experienced lord
[15:50] i don't know if you'd even help me but
[15:52] help me get out of this mess help me dig
[15:54] out of it show me wisdom how do i do it
[15:56] please lord and he didn't have to do
[15:58] that but you know i can testify tonight
[16:00] god showed me a way out
[16:02] god showed me a way and i can say by the
[16:05] grace of god tonight that it's all been
[16:08] resolved i am debt free completely debt
[16:10] free and i never deserve that but god
[16:13] when we're sincere in our hearts god
[16:14] comes and restores yes you made a bad
[16:17] decision but i'm going to show your way
[16:19] out
[16:21] how much love is that
[16:24] praise the lord
[16:26] so we live through that and uh so but a
[16:29] thought come to me and when i was in
[16:31] washington a few weeks ago
[16:32] um just speaking about these the
[16:34] influence of our decisions and decisions
[16:37] and god is working deep in our if you
[16:40] have any spiritual discernment you see
[16:42] god is working at a deeper level in our
[16:44] lives the way that he's preaching
[16:46] through the ministers as at a deeper
[16:48] level
[16:48] this word is not coming just to give us
[16:50] a feeling or a sensation
[16:52] it's not something surface it's not just
[16:54] something to smear over something but
[16:56] he's really working deep in our lives
[16:58] and i want the lord just brought it to
[16:59] me that the lord the holy spirit's
[17:01] really working
[17:02] at the level at the level of our
[17:05] decision-making process
[17:09] he's trying to influence
[17:11] our decision-making and that you know
[17:13] we're on free more agency just like it
[17:15] was in the beginning and that eve fell
[17:18] because she exercised her free more
[17:19] agency fell with the serpent's reasoning
[17:21] of the word and so we see what's all
[17:23] come from that in six thousand years or
[17:25] whatever whatever it is and now we come
[17:27] back to the climax of this and brother
[17:29] brahma says this eve this second eve is
[17:31] to prove that we're not like that first
[17:33] eve we're going to reverse what happens
[17:35] so in order to do that then we're going
[17:36] to have to be careful of the influences
[17:38] that influence our decisions in our life
[17:40] and god works at us at a decision level
[17:43] all of us have lived through making
[17:45] mistake falling and god forgives us and
[17:49] restores us
[17:50] but god wants to make a powerful people
[17:53] that's under the influence before they
[17:55] even make decisions
[17:58] that they can make decisions of
[18:00] character the first time
[18:03] why do you think brother brown preached
[18:05] uh the message uh choosing of a bride
[18:08] you think it was just a sermon for the
[18:10] for the men and the women to know what
[18:12] to choose no he was talking about god
[18:14] chooses a bride a young man chooses a
[18:17] bride and when you're going to make that
[18:19] choice you better choose character
[18:22] but but the prophet through god now is
[18:25] teaching the bride of jesus christ
[18:28] what does he do he's teaching sons that
[18:30] when we make our choices
[18:32] choose character
[18:34] amen
[18:36] choose something of character choose
[18:38] integrity choose something that even
[18:41] when he talked about investments he
[18:42] talked about he said you can't just hold
[18:44] on to your money you got to invest it
[18:45] but you want to find some secure proven
[18:48] investment you don't want just about fly
[18:50] by night you know uh uh quit get rich
[18:53] quick scheme we don't do that so what's
[18:55] he talking about that we're good we're
[18:56] going to investigate we're going to
[18:58] invest our spiritual life into something
[18:59] we better make sure it's the word of god
[19:01] we better make sure it's the right
[19:03] pastor with the right balance because
[19:04] we're entrusting our soul to him we
[19:07] better pray about that and make sure
[19:08] it's right and that decision for a
[19:10] church better be a right decision
[19:12] because your family depends on it
[19:15] so what's what's the problem he's
[19:17] talking about influencing sons decisions
[19:20] when the whole world is making decisions
[19:22] based upon their own rights and based
[19:24] upon what they see on the internet every
[19:26] day and based upon about 50 years of
[19:28] feeding on hollywood most of their
[19:30] decisions are based upon the influence
[19:32] of hollywood
[19:34] families is under the influence of
[19:36] hollywood families
[19:38] and god says no i'm going to have some
[19:40] sons and daughters that come out of that
[19:42] influence
[19:44] and they're i'm going to deal with them
[19:46] at their decision level
[19:49] and they're going to make decisions and
[19:50] choose character
[19:53] there's going to be some young men that
[19:55] wait a while and they choose character
[19:58] it's not just the hormones rushing and
[20:01] getting married because i want to be
[20:02] with this woman that's what the world
[20:04] does but sons of god i'm gonna have some
[20:07] young men there that step back and say i
[20:10] know i want fellowship there's a thirst
[20:12] in me to have a wife all these other
[20:13] things when i step back because god's
[20:15] teaching me to choose when you choose
[20:18] choose character first
[20:20] and then if she's pretty fine
[20:23] that helps as well but you better choose
[20:26] character first
[20:30] i thought i was going to teach tonight
[20:31] but i feel like preaching
[20:33] listen jehovah god has provided his
[20:36] leadership in this hour to influence
[20:38] sons at a decision level
[20:42] now we make decisions and god forgives
[20:44] us and we had to restore back no at the
[20:46] decision level wait wait upon the lord
[20:49] he'll renew your strength god i've got a
[20:51] decision to make and i believe that god
[20:54] is big enough to influence this decision
[20:57] that i choose the right thing
[21:02] then you remember the scriptures
[21:04] god can restore if you felt if you make
[21:07] a decision and you fall and you make a
[21:09] mistake how many has ever fallen before
[21:12] but did you know there's a scripture
[21:13] that says
[21:15] unto him who's able
[21:17] to keep you
[21:18] from falling
[21:20] praise the lord
[21:23] you know david said in pro in psalms he
[21:25] said he will enlarge
[21:28] enlarge your feet so that you're that
[21:30] you won't slip you know enlarge your
[21:33] steps so you won't slip you're not
[21:35] slipping and falling all the time
[21:36] because while you're allowing god to
[21:38] influence you now that you make solid
[21:41] decisions
[21:43] let me raise your hand and say lord help
[21:44] me make solid decisions
[21:46] don't just be given in quickly young
[21:48] people just oh i'm just feeling this i'm
[21:50] feeling this and feeling this in my
[21:52] heart and my heart is twitter baited i
[21:54] know this is the one this is the one
[21:56] grow up a little bit
[21:58] bible says the heart is deceitful above
[22:00] all things
[22:01] brother bradham says look at that girl's
[22:03] background look at that man's background
[22:05] be around the family he said check it
[22:07] out pray about it
[22:09] see if they've got the holy ghost
[22:12] it's a decision-making process that the
[22:14] prophet spoke in this hour helping sons
[22:17] to make solid decisions
[22:19] not like the world
[22:21] ah they'll be fine they fall in love
[22:24] just let them go and this is parents
[22:25] saying this they'll be fine just let
[22:27] them do whatever they want and we fell
[22:29] in love that way and we didn't have a
[22:32] job or a penny to our name and things
[22:34] worked out
[22:40] no
[22:43] i think the boy should have a job if he
[22:45] wants to have a wife and kids
[22:47] he should have a good job
[22:49] i think he should think it through
[22:51] i think he should have a plan
[22:54] i think he should go to jehovah god and
[22:56] say god
[22:57] i need a plan
[22:58] i need a vision
[23:02] a lot of that is accountability
[23:06] so he's influencing us in the in the
[23:09] level
[23:10] of our choices
[23:12] in other words if we're under his
[23:13] preeminence and his influence
[23:17] he could influence us
[23:18] before our choices are made
[23:21] praise the lord how many would say
[23:22] tonight lord influence my choices
[23:27] it's
[23:28] influence
[23:30] was preached seven times
[23:32] and i just noticed in this week while i
[23:34] was listening on my vacation
[23:36] to
[23:38] uh sirs is this the time
[23:41] and if you listen to that you just see
[23:42] the whole transition and brother brahm
[23:44] doesn't even understand all that's taken
[23:46] place he's seeing something this is a
[23:48] big deal that's happening it's a
[23:50] transition going into revelations 5 in
[23:53] revelations 10
[23:55] and the blast that took place in the
[23:56] dream that scared him thought it was
[23:58] into his life so six dreams in his
[24:00] church by spiritual people and a seventh
[24:02] vision and he says when this happens the
[24:04] lord says when this happens in your
[24:05] front yard when they're tearing it up
[24:07] it's time for you to go west all the
[24:09] dreams they go west go west something
[24:10] didn't even know what was going to
[24:11] happen but somewhere along the line he
[24:13] got influenced by the the service of
[24:16] influence that he preached it
[24:18] he preached at home but then he went
[24:20] straight to phoenix and preached it
[24:21] preached it seven times surrounding this
[24:23] whole thing after the seals and it was
[24:25] about uzziah
[24:27] i'd like to preach a sermon on it
[24:28] sometime uzziah
[24:30] being a godly king doing all the right
[24:32] things raised by godly parents
[24:34] everything was right
[24:36] but
[24:37] except this
[24:38] isaiah the young prophet was under the
[24:41] influence
[24:43] of this godly king
[24:44] too much
[24:48] now you think about that he wasn't under
[24:50] under the influence of some guy working
[24:51] at a restaurant or some
[24:54] uh prostitute or some
[24:56] worldly person at college
[24:59] he was influenced by a godly king that
[25:01] was living godly in doing the right
[25:02] things
[25:06] he was under that influence and yet
[25:08] now because he was under the influence
[25:10] of somebody that then his world falls
[25:12] apart because uzziah failed uzziah gets
[25:15] lifted up in pride and the one he never
[25:17] thought would fail
[25:19] never thought he would leave the message
[25:24] i never dreamed this person would leave
[25:26] the message
[25:27] i'm preaching it tonight so i'm going to
[25:28] go ahead and preach it
[25:30] never never
[25:31] but you see the problem was is that may
[25:34] happen and it's a terrible thing that
[25:35] uzi did it lost everything struck with
[25:37] leprosy sin came in his life i don't
[25:40] know what the rest of the future hold i
[25:42] think he died that way i don't know but
[25:44] the point is is that isaiah had to get
[25:47] an experience in the presence of the
[25:49] lord because he was under the wrong
[25:52] influence
[25:55] and it wasn't the influence of the world
[25:57] it was influenced under a godly king who
[25:59] failed he failed
[26:02] and in his eyes isaiah in his
[26:03] desperation oh god i can't believe this
[26:06] he goes into the temple and finally gets
[26:09] under the right influence that's the
[26:10] presence of the lord i'll tell you young
[26:12] people everyone where we need to be is
[26:14] in the presence of the lord we need to
[26:17] meet with god personally
[26:18] we need to be in this word can you say
[26:20] man we need to be feeding on the message
[26:23] because why we're under the right
[26:24] influence
[26:28] and if you think that you're going to
[26:29] get by as a message believer constantly
[26:32] feeding for hours on your phone with
[26:34] everything that's being said on the
[26:35] internet both naturally and spiritually
[26:38] you're gonna you're gonna
[26:40] somebody's gonna fall in your eyes
[26:45] guess what you could live a holy
[26:47] ghost-filled power packed life
[26:49] and never even look at social media
[26:51] again
[26:54] [Laughter]
[26:57] praise the lord
[27:03] so
[27:04] i'm having a good time tonight i don't
[27:06] know about you but i got a few minutes
[27:08] here so i'm taking my coat off
[27:10] amen it's good to be home i like
[27:12] preaching here more than any other place
[27:14] in the world
[27:15] and that's that's saying a lot because
[27:17] africa was pretty good
[27:20] that was a pretty good place to preach
[27:23] but i like preaching here
[27:25] i know you there's a love for the word
[27:27] here and i i love preaching to my
[27:29] congregation
[27:30] so so now don't we have places in the
[27:32] bible where
[27:34] so now we
[27:35] if he could influence our choices we
[27:37] become accountable to his word and the
[27:39] counsel before decisions are made and
[27:42] isn't there place in the bible where
[27:43] they didn't consult the lord
[27:46] some kings didn't consult the lord and
[27:48] one time the king consulted with the the
[27:51] dignitaries but didn't consult the lord
[27:53] so that i believe that term is in there
[27:55] to consult the lord and they didn't
[27:57] consult the lord first
[27:59] and they didn't consult godly people i
[28:01] think we should live a life accountable
[28:03] that we consult the lord first that we
[28:05] consult godly people
[28:07] who have had experience in things first
[28:10] that's the thing about the body of
[28:11] christ you can always find somebody in
[28:14] the body of christ most times that's
[28:16] already been through something that
[28:18] you're going through
[28:20] already had a victory in it already
[28:22] learned their lesson
[28:24] can you say amen
[28:27] and so we
[28:28] uh we don't enjoy the benefits of that
[28:31] too much because we pass it by and say
[28:34] i'm going to do my own thing and yet in
[28:35] the body
[28:36] there's godly counsel
[28:38] i never understand where
[28:40] you know i understand when
[28:42] peers hang around with the same age
[28:45] but i never understand with some older
[28:47] seasoned people in the church why the
[28:49] young people are afraid to be around
[28:51] them when that's the very ones they need
[28:53] to hang around a little bit
[28:56] that's the people you need to invite
[28:57] yourself over and they'll probably be
[28:59] surprised but they'd love to have you
[29:01] come over hey you know hey can you guys
[29:03] have me over for coffee or dinner if you
[29:05] if you knew that and i just want to come
[29:06] over i'm a single guy and i see a real
[29:09] godliness about your life and so i'm
[29:11] just going to run off things
[29:12] i just like some fellowship and just to
[29:14] just to be mentored a little bit
[29:16] that conversation rarely ever happens
[29:20] but yet god and by his holy spirit
[29:21] provides some in the body who's been
[29:23] seasoned in things
[29:25] and if you're struggling for an answer
[29:26] it may not always come over the pulpit
[29:28] it may come through of the body of
[29:30] christ
[29:31] is that okay with everybody
[29:35] so we become accountable to the word the
[29:38] counsel before decisions are made if we
[29:40] could do that it'd be wonderful consult
[29:42] the lord if i could do that more it
[29:43] would be wonderful consult the lord
[29:45] first and consult godly people who have
[29:48] had experience
[29:49] you talk about having the upper edge on
[29:52] the devil
[29:55] if the bride could come more under his
[29:57] headship
[29:58] christ's headship and the preeminence
[30:01] at the temptation level
[30:04] and yield as brother brandon brandon
[30:06] preached last wednesday night to learn
[30:08] how to yield to the holy spirit to yield
[30:11] so it's about yielding can you say man
[30:13] if the bride could come under his pre
[30:15] preeminence and his headship at the
[30:18] temptation level at the moment of being
[30:20] tempted at the decision-making level and
[30:23] yield and be accountable at that point
[30:25] what an army would raise among us can
[30:28] you say amen there'd be less falling for
[30:31] things and more under the headship of
[30:33] him who can keep you from falling
[30:37] blessed be his name
[30:39] i believe many problems i like to talk
[30:40] about accountability because i believe
[30:42] many problems in churches and believers
[30:44] in homes
[30:46] in young people is a misunderstanding of
[30:48] authority and what being under authority
[30:50] is and being accountable to god's
[30:52] authority and god's delegated authority
[30:55] i think a lot of problems come because
[30:56] of that so i believe in accountability i
[30:59] believe it is a godly thing we can go
[31:02] through scriptures and to see god give
[31:04] us instruction in those things it looks
[31:05] like i won't get to those scriptures
[31:07] tonight maybe next wednesday but we can
[31:09] see in the scripture it's a principle
[31:11] that we need to be accountable can you
[31:12] say ma'am but but you see now it's it's
[31:16] not just that but i want to say this
[31:18] that there is an environment
[31:20] there is a
[31:22] a there is a
[31:23] how should i say it there is a world
[31:26] to itself
[31:28] that that god creates
[31:30] it's his atmosphere
[31:33] and the bible says actually is the
[31:34] atmosphere
[31:36] where angels love to be around
[31:40] in the company of angels they're hanging
[31:42] around those the bible says that fear
[31:44] the lord there's an accompany of angels
[31:46] and in his presence so the people are in
[31:48] the fear of the lord they're worshiping
[31:49] god it brings his presence but angels
[31:51] are there as well that he encamps around
[31:54] those that fear him so there is an
[31:56] atmosphere and we can't see in the other
[31:59] dimension but i can tell you
[32:01] that that presence and that environment
[32:04] is not down at the local bar
[32:07] that environment is not in the white
[32:09] house
[32:11] the bible says that company that
[32:13] environment is around where the words
[32:16] being preached around who had those who
[32:18] have christ in their hearts
[32:20] around the body of christ can you say
[32:23] man
[32:24] it's not going to be in some comic book
[32:26] that you'll get that there is an
[32:28] environment and a presence
[32:32] amen
[32:33] and and to go further in that in that
[32:37] is everything that we need
[32:40] his word
[32:42] his correction
[32:44] how many need correction
[32:46] his blessings
[32:48] his direction and matters
[32:51] and so everything is in that everything
[32:52] is in that environment now i can commit
[32:54] when i'm at home and i have my bible and
[32:56] i really enter into the spirit of and
[32:58] say lord just teach me something here
[33:00] let me take time with it i can enter
[33:01] that i don't have to be in church
[33:04] all of a sudden i'm in that environment
[33:06] and i'm feeding
[33:07] and the lord's speaking to me things you
[33:09] see you come into that presence
[33:12] i'm not going to get that
[33:14] if i'm reading my singing news magazine
[33:16] which i enjoy reading by the way it's
[33:18] all the southern gospel groups and i
[33:20] keep up with them and
[33:21] they don't know me but i know them they
[33:24] know sherry
[33:25] but they don't know me and so i go to a
[33:27] quartet convention i say who who are you
[33:30] i said i'm on paul lafontaine lavon oh
[33:32] sherry's brother
[33:35] so i'm sherry's brother but they don't
[33:36] know me
[33:37] but i know them and so but i'm not going
[33:40] to get any near near
[33:42] reading that
[33:45] so now if i fed on only those things and
[33:48] barely cracked this book through the
[33:50] week
[33:51] what influence am i under
[33:55] and have i come into his presence and am
[33:57] i in the right environment for all the
[34:00] blessings to flow to my life
[34:02] and that's why in this challenging busy
[34:04] time that we have we're going con we're
[34:07] going upstream
[34:10] we're live in laodicea we have all these
[34:12] entertainments we got them all of our
[34:13] phone we got everything else but listen
[34:16] a call to the bride you are going
[34:17] upstream to make a decision to say
[34:20] i've got to be in the presence of the
[34:22] lord i've got to feed on his word i've
[34:26] got to be in the house of god i've got
[34:28] to sit and have
[34:30] alter with my family i need to stay in
[34:33] prayer as often as i can because i'm
[34:34] going upstream here
[34:38] praise the lord
[34:40] and what influence you're under
[34:43] will show up
[34:45] in your attitude
[34:47] in your clothes that you wear
[34:49] in the music that you listen to
[34:53] it'll show up what you're feeding on
[34:58] somebody starts to wear these short
[35:01] skirts and tight skirts
[35:05] you're not under the influence of this
[35:06] message
[35:08] there's no way that you can get that
[35:10] result and be constantly feeding on the
[35:11] word of god
[35:13] it has the right
[35:14] result the lord guides you what to wear
[35:18] but see you're on you're on the internet
[35:20] you're watching this and so now that's
[35:21] what you're feeding on and it's a
[35:22] giveaway because we can see it
[35:25] so it's not just that attitudes spirits
[35:27] come from music
[35:29] there are some spirits that come from
[35:30] even christian music some of it
[35:32] spirits of rebellion
[35:35] spirits of
[35:37] tattoos and spirits of nose rings and
[35:40] everything else right in the christian
[35:41] realm
[35:42] if you're feeding on it then all of a
[35:44] sudden you start to manifest what you're
[35:46] feeding on
[35:48] you think this is the first time a
[35:49] preacher's preached on that this is the
[35:51] principle that's been for six thousand
[35:53] years since man has been on earth from
[35:55] the tower of babel all the way through
[35:57] what you're feeding on you're going to
[35:59] manifest in your body
[36:01] and in your attitude
[36:02] and young people say no not me you know
[36:04] this is different you know no you're not
[36:06] different it's the same principle what
[36:08] you feed on is what you become and i'll
[36:11] tell you more and more god help me to be
[36:13] under the influence of the presence of
[36:14] god his word the body of christ listen
[36:18] friends we're getting ready to get out
[36:19] of here
[36:20] we don't need to be weighted down by
[36:22] some worldly thing we need to shed that
[36:24] stuff and say god make me rapture ready
[36:26] to get out of here
[36:29] arguing about this and wearing this and
[36:31] all that stay in the word of god you'll
[36:33] never have to be told what to do because
[36:35] that word will teach you and tell you
[36:37] what to wear
[36:39] the holy spirit will guide you
[36:42] and we'll know more arguments about it
[36:43] there won't be any more because you're
[36:45] feeding on the right thing
[36:47] if every person would just come under
[36:48] the right influence god would influence
[36:51] them all the way to a rapture
[36:54] we're about to wrap this thing up you
[36:56] think we'll be here much longer i don't
[36:57] believe we will
[36:59] it's time for the bride to trim their
[37:01] lamps
[37:02] be filled with the spirit
[37:05] be feeding on the word of god because
[37:07] everything that you're looking at out
[37:09] there
[37:10] will soon be gone
[37:12] your movie stars and your football teams
[37:15] and your nfl it's all gonna be gone the
[37:18] only thing left standing is gonna be
[37:21] this atmosphere this presence this word
[37:24] this only thing left standing somebody
[37:27] say praise the lord tonight
[37:32] there is an environment
[37:34] and in it is everything that we need
[37:36] correction blessing direction
[37:38] and when we step away from it in
[37:40] rebellion
[37:41] whether physically or mentally
[37:44] we step into
[37:46] independence we step away from
[37:48] accountability to it because there's a
[37:50] certain when you when you come to into
[37:53] that presence
[37:54] there's an accountability that goes with
[37:56] it even the fact that you choose to stay
[37:58] in that presence
[38:00] means that you've chosen a life of
[38:01] accountability because you can't come in
[38:03] it without it calling for a surrender
[38:08] you can't get it unless it it's calling
[38:10] for a surrender
[38:12] this message calls for a complete
[38:13] surrender to jesus christ
[38:15] no no if ands or buts about it
[38:18] and years ago about 10 years ago 15
[38:20] years ago i can't remember what it was
[38:22] and i've had a couple men say this i
[38:23] come as visitors to stay for a little
[38:25] while and they use the word of comedy
[38:27] they say sitting under this ministry and
[38:29] sitting there after a few weeks there's
[38:32] such a accountability that goes with it
[38:35] they're not used to having to answer
[38:37] to how they treat their wife every day
[38:43] i've been in the message for years
[38:44] that's not important no yeah it is
[38:46] it's in the message
[38:48] but when you come around to somebody who
[38:50] talks about it and preaches it in that
[38:52] presence it's correcting everything you
[38:54] think i can correct it i don't want to
[38:56] correct everything i don't know how to
[38:58] do it but i tell you in the presence of
[38:59] the lord
[39:00] it can it can
[39:02] it can step on all 10 of your toes and
[39:05] you don't
[39:05] even realize it
[39:08] praise the lord
[39:09] it's not me it's the it's the nature of
[39:11] the holy spirit it's a light it's light
[39:14] and if you want to walk in the light
[39:16] nothing is hidden
[39:19] expose it lord
[39:21] but in that presence
[39:23] though it's exposing it's everything
[39:25] that we need
[39:27] so when somebody comes into it and
[39:30] it comes in it's like one of them and he
[39:32] said man it's just i can't go here and a
[39:34] couple of them they just leave that i
[39:36] can't attend there it's just too much
[39:39] too much accountability it's just too
[39:41] much for me they never faced that type
[39:44] of presence
[39:45] where
[39:46] and they think it's condemnation many
[39:48] times it's not condemnation it's
[39:50] conviction
[39:51] it's the light
[39:53] you don't need to be afraid of that
[39:57] praise the lord
[39:58] i've learned to love it i don't love
[40:00] when i get my
[40:02] my hide ripped off
[40:04] by the word
[40:06] i love what brother rap said
[40:09] sunday about
[40:10] the evangelists coming and waking
[40:12] everybody up it's like the parent waking
[40:13] kids up you're not the popular person
[40:15] when you have to be the ones that wake
[40:16] them up i love that
[40:18] because i know as a pastor i'm not the
[40:20] popular person when i'm the one has to
[40:22] wake you up out of your sleep
[40:24] sometimes physicals like sometimes
[40:26] they're sleeping on me physically praise
[40:28] the lord and they wake up you know but
[40:29] that's not it it's waking you up
[40:31] spiritually and you're not the nice guys
[40:33] having to wake you up but it's a good
[40:35] thing somebody wakes you up it's a good
[40:37] thing that you get rebuked
[40:40] it's a good thing the light exposes
[40:41] what's in your life who else in your
[40:43] life besides the word in the voice of
[40:45] the lord exposes the darkness in your
[40:47] life who is the guy at the coffee shop
[40:50] going to expose it no no no it's going
[40:52] to be this atmosphere in the word that's
[40:54] going to love you enough to expose it
[40:57] had a parent come to me and say were you
[40:59] preaching on my kids are you preaching
[41:01] on this said you know you were i think
[41:02] you were i said no no sister i if i
[41:05] address something usually there's three
[41:06] or four or more that it has to be
[41:08] addressed for the church so i try not to
[41:10] personalize it to anybody i try to keep
[41:12] a right attitude that way but i asked
[41:15] her i said her husband i said
[41:17] who in your boy's life right now
[41:19] what who in his life
[41:21] would be a voice of truth to correct
[41:24] them
[41:25] and in some situations they're not
[41:26] listening to the parents
[41:29] so i said who in their life is it their
[41:31] boss is it the the teacher at school who
[41:34] it would be a voice that would be the
[41:36] voice of admonition to them besides the
[41:38] voice of the lord
[41:40] and they said well and i said my next
[41:42] question is do you really want do you
[41:44] really want to discourage do you want to
[41:46] really carnalize what's happening and
[41:49] coddle and say oh my poor son is getting
[41:51] hit on you sure you want to do that
[41:53] because if that's the conviction of the
[41:55] holy spirit you want to leave that alone
[41:57] let god do his work
[41:59] they might feel bad they might get mad
[42:01] at the preacher but that's the voice of
[42:02] the lord
[42:08] amen is this okay with everybody
[42:11] so
[42:14] if we if we're rebellious to
[42:15] accountability
[42:17] in this atmosphere
[42:19] we step into independence instead of
[42:21] accountability it's i do my own thing
[42:24] i've got a right to do my own thing i'm
[42:26] old enough now i don't need to answer to
[42:29] anyone i'm under nobody
[42:31] all this worldly laodicean attitude
[42:33] deeper than that it's living by
[42:35] a principle that as i said last sunday
[42:38] originates and lucifer he wanted to
[42:40] function outside of god's authority and
[42:42] his environment actually lift his
[42:44] kingdom above god's
[42:46] satan's principle is to want to work
[42:48] outside of the authority of god
[42:50] i believe people can believe all the
[42:52] doctrine of this message and still be
[42:54] living by satan's principles
[42:56] of rebellion
[42:58] an independent spirit can never work in
[43:01] the presence of god the church sometimes
[43:04] is full of lone rangers who don't have
[43:06] to answer to anybody in their private
[43:08] life whatsoever
[43:10] but brother bradham taught us the lord
[43:13] wants to be lord
[43:15] of your private life
[43:18] all the doors of your heart are opened
[43:21] and exposed to this king
[43:25] nothing is hidden
[43:28] amen
[43:29] did you notice jonah
[43:31] a few weeks ago did you notice in the
[43:33] story what he ran from
[43:35] he went to tarshish
[43:36] paid his trip to tarshish
[43:39] what was he running from the presence of
[43:40] the lord
[43:42] we think many things when it comes to
[43:43] his presence it's a feeling or something
[43:45] and here it shows the presence of the
[43:47] lord was the word of the lord given to
[43:48] him showing us that there was
[43:50] accountability with the word of the lord
[43:51] that it went through not a feeling not a
[43:53] tingle that's not the presence of the
[43:55] lord when you're hearing the true word
[43:57] to you that is his presence
[44:00] and in that is an accountability it
[44:03] speaks directly to individuals jonah was
[44:06] not at a church nobody was in that he
[44:08] was in the presence as god individually
[44:11] spoke to him and gave him a word to do
[44:13] his presence is tied with his word and
[44:15] with his voice in the garden of eden it
[44:17] was the same way they heard the voice of
[44:19] the lord walking in the cool of the
[44:20] evening and then they when the sin came
[44:23] in they hid themselves from the presence
[44:26] of the lord
[44:28] it's when we step away from that
[44:31] presence in that environment
[44:34] that we start to
[44:36] get in trouble
[44:38] people can sit in church but they've
[44:39] stepped away from it in their minds
[44:41] in their hearts
[44:42] they're not there
[44:45] the rebellion is always already taking
[44:47] them away
[44:49] notice jonah was going along fine and
[44:51] serving the lord
[44:52] he was not an unbeliever brother brahm
[44:54] said
[44:55] nineveh and tarshish did not mean god
[44:57] and sin
[44:59] god called him to nitiva he went to
[45:01] tarshish it didn't mean god and sin it
[45:03] was a choice
[45:04] of doing his will or not
[45:07] jonah
[45:08] doing he was doing fine
[45:10] until he personally came in direct
[45:12] contact with god and from that time the
[45:14] struggle began and the moment he got the
[45:17] word he became responsible for it in
[45:19] other words it called for a total
[45:22] surrender and nothing less
[45:24] as soon as he come in contact with god
[45:28] he had to lose his independent spirit he
[45:30] had to go to nineveh and preach
[45:32] no one else could do it for him only
[45:34] jonah
[45:36] no excuse would work he had to become
[45:38] personally accountable for what god said
[45:41] in the bible we see many different
[45:43] responses to men when they come face to
[45:46] face with god
[45:47] we know jonah ran
[45:49] moses made excuses
[45:51] gideon gave his complexes jether in
[45:53] judges 8 said he was too young to pick
[45:55] up the sword
[45:56] he was too young to serve the lord
[45:59] the rich young ruler said he couldn't go
[46:00] let go of his money and his status king
[46:03] agrippa in acts said i'm not persuaded
[46:05] enough yet so i'm not going to go with
[46:06] you today
[46:07] felix said it's just not a convenient
[46:09] season right now for me to serve the
[46:11] lord
[46:13] luke 14 17 the lord said a bit about the
[46:16] great marriage and the invitation to the
[46:17] marriage and all of them began to make
[46:19] excuses and the excuses were more
[46:22] important than the invitation to the
[46:24] feast to his presence
[46:28] what were the excuses i've purchased a
[46:30] piece of land
[46:32] have me excused
[46:39] i
[46:40] have married a wife
[46:44] please have me excused
[46:48] and so all of these are hesitants
[46:52] running from the presence of the lord
[46:53] running from that contact that he made
[46:55] with you and running from it
[46:57] but take a look at the bible who in the
[46:59] bible who people who took it quickly
[47:01] david said i'll take goliath right now
[47:04] isaiah said hear my lord send me
[47:07] mary said be it unto me according to thy
[47:10] word there wasn't give me a few months
[47:12] to think about it praise the lord i've
[47:14] been in his presence whatever you said
[47:17] let it happen to me right now
[47:19] [Applause]
[47:21] hallelujah the ethiopian eunuch said as
[47:24] he talked to philip and received the
[47:26] word right away they stopped and he said
[47:29] here is water what does hinder let me be
[47:31] baptized right now
[47:34] they acted upon it can you say amen
[47:36] let's do it now he's made contact with
[47:38] you i'm in his presence i'm not afraid
[47:40] of that presence i'm accountable to it
[47:42] can you say amen let it influence my
[47:44] decisions praise the lord
[47:46] for some god calls them and you can come
[47:49] hard or you can come easy but if you're
[47:51] a son of god you're going to come but he
[47:53] gives you something you must become
[47:55] accountable to like you did to jonah and
[47:58] you if you choose your own selfish
[47:59] independent ship to tarshish if you do
[48:02] that go ahead and do it but you're going
[48:04] to get tangled up in a lot of seaweed
[48:08] yes you are
[48:10] yes you are
[48:11] and that's not a pleasant situation
[48:14] if you were there you might say jonah
[48:16] what in the world are you doing paying
[48:17] your trip to tarshish i feel like saying
[48:20] that to some young people sometimes even
[48:21] our own church what in the world are you
[48:23] doing
[48:24] god's speaking
[48:26] why are you dabbling in the things of
[48:28] the world
[48:29] god's speaking to you
[48:31] it's time for a full surrender to him
[48:34] it's time to say i'm all on board i'm
[48:36] going to sell out lock stock and barrel
[48:38] to the lord
[48:41] before you
[48:42] seek a wife before you seek your future
[48:45] before i got to get my future arranged
[48:47] before any of that you met god say god
[48:50] i'm accountable to you that you can
[48:52] influence my future and my decisions
[48:55] is anybody getting something out of this
[48:56] tonight
[48:58] if you come into the lord and you want
[49:00] to be accountable not run away from his
[49:02] atmosphere
[49:03] but run into it and stay around it let
[49:06] the word stay around the word
[49:08] it's the light it's walking in the light
[49:10] that's what i'm talking about tonight
[49:12] it's walking in the light it's walking
[49:14] with nothing hidden it's accountability
[49:17] to the lord and to his body can you say
[49:20] amen
[49:24] i'm come to the church because of a
[49:26] desire
[49:28] to come you know what i i
[49:31] the first reason i'm at church tonight
[49:33] even in any time
[49:36] and looking at the time 8 30.
[49:38] so i'm okay
[49:42] i come to church first of all because
[49:44] i love to come to church it's a desire
[49:46] to hear the word
[49:49] but there is another reason i was
[49:50] thinking about this a few weeks ago i
[49:52] come to church because of a submission
[49:55] to the rest of the body of christ
[49:58] bible says submit ourselves one to
[49:59] another the word says to gather together
[50:02] can you say amen
[50:03] and i come to be submissive to that so
[50:06] that i can encourage other members of
[50:08] the body of christ i don't treat church
[50:10] or his people like i can take them or
[50:13] leave them anytime that i want
[50:15] you say well brother paul you're the
[50:16] pastor you have to be here no i'd be
[50:18] here whether i was pastoring or not
[50:21] because i love the lord and i want to be
[50:22] here i want to be in this atmosphere
[50:25] but also i have a certain accountability
[50:27] to you as another member of the body of
[50:30] christ and i my being here encourages
[50:32] you and you being here encourages me
[50:36] now there's some tonight that's
[50:37] listening that not able to come because
[50:40] of distance and because so far away and
[50:42] the children in school but i'm going to
[50:43] say this
[50:44] to to some of you there's some of you
[50:46] who can make it to church do have enough
[50:48] time to make it and you're not here
[50:52] so you need to examine that you need to
[50:53] pray about that because why do we come
[50:55] it's not just to fulfill a religious
[50:57] duty but our hunger to come but also
[50:59] there's a certain accountability to one
[51:01] another
[51:03] there's a certain submission to one
[51:04] another and my presence encourages you
[51:07] we put our licks to fight and together
[51:08] can you say amen and you being here
[51:11] encourages me
[51:12] i don't want to preach to these chairs
[51:15] these chairs can't say amen
[51:17] these chairs don't have any soul
[51:20] but thank god tonight we can preach to
[51:22] you and on the internet tonight i can
[51:23] preach the ones that have a soul that's
[51:25] saying amen to the word of god
[51:28] [Applause]
[51:29] it's a lot better to preach to that i'll
[51:31] tell you amen i got to find a place to
[51:33] end this we'll pick it up next wednesday
[51:35] or the next time
[51:37] the lord has us preached
[51:38] so now
[51:40] oh i wanted to just can we read this
[51:42] before we get out of here
[51:44] i wanted to read our text in
[51:47] john 3
[51:49] i want to read that last verse
[51:51] john 3
[51:53] uh
[51:54] verse 21. so the john 3 16 for god so
[51:58] loved the world we understand but the
[51:59] light has come but look what he said
[52:01] about this is this should seal up
[52:03] what we've been saying here tonight
[52:05] this is it in the amplified verse 21
[52:08] john 3 21. can you give me two minutes
[52:10] here
[52:12] but whoever
[52:16] practices truth and i don't necessarily
[52:18] like that but coming to truth whoever
[52:20] practices truth and does what's right
[52:23] morally ethically spiritually i think
[52:24] it's deeper than that i think when he
[52:26] says he that doeth truth
[52:29] i believe it's coming to truth in other
[52:31] words like brother brandon preached
[52:33] you're not you're not pitching your tent
[52:35] another direction you're not going the
[52:37] other way you're not even looking the
[52:39] other way
[52:40] you may not be where you're at but
[52:41] you're looking the right way
[52:43] remember he preached that you pitch your
[52:45] tent in the right direction so that the
[52:47] first thing that you look at is the
[52:48] right thing that's going to influence
[52:50] you
[52:51] you see so that's what coming to truth
[52:53] is so this says whoever comes to truth
[52:56] when they come to truth they come to
[52:57] light
[53:00] and so here's the amplified comes to
[53:02] light so that his works
[53:04] may be plainly shown
[53:07] to be what they are
[53:09] so that his works so the reason that you
[53:11] come to light and you expose yourself to
[53:14] the light and you're accountable to the
[53:16] light is because you want your works to
[53:19] be plainly shown
[53:23] that they are accomplished in god in
[53:27] other words divinely prompted
[53:31] divinely prompted
[53:33] and done with god's help
[53:35] in dependence on him
[53:38] oh i wish i could preach another hour
[53:40] and that right there
[53:43] you come to light
[53:45] musicians can come
[53:46] you come to light
[53:48] so that his works may be plainly shown
[53:51] to be what they are
[53:52] accomplished in god in other words
[53:54] listen now divinely prompted how many
[53:57] want to be divinely prompted
[54:02] how many wants to see things done with
[54:03] god's help
[54:05] you come to the light because the things
[54:07] you're doing is with god's help
[54:09] the decisions you're making are divinely
[54:10] prompted
[54:12] and then it says independence on him you
[54:15] come to the light so that you may
[54:18] divinely be prompted and led and
[54:20] influenced in your decisions every day
[54:22] and that's showing your dependence on
[54:25] him you're not an independent creature
[54:28] who gives yourself permission to act any
[54:31] way you want to you are submissive to
[54:33] the presence of god
[54:35] i'm not an independent that just
[54:38] you know i i do all right in church but
[54:41] i do my own thing i say my own thing i
[54:43] act the way i want to out of church no
[54:45] you're coming to light you're carrying
[54:47] that light lord i want to be in that i
[54:49] want to be exposed can you say amen i
[54:51] want to be divinely prompted for the
[54:53] decisions i make every day and i don't
[54:55] want to act independently without
[54:58] the accountability
[55:00] to the word
[55:02] and also
[55:04] god
[55:05] but also
[55:07] god
[55:08] with skin on
[55:12] some people say i don't need anybody
[55:14] nobody needs to correct me i do my own
[55:16] thing i just serve the lord god i serve
[55:18] the lord god you need to read the book
[55:20] of james
[55:21] you don't bless god and curse men
[55:24] god can work through his people god
[55:27] himself is living in his people
[55:29] and you can't say i just be alone with
[55:30] god i'm going to go out in the smoky
[55:32] mountains and i don't need anybody and
[55:34] it's nice to rest like that
[55:36] but if you were going to move out there
[55:38] i i couldn't move out there as much as
[55:40] my i'd love to move out there but i
[55:42] couldn't do it because i do away from
[55:44] the body of christ
[55:46] you see so that would not i know that
[55:49] wouldn't be the will of god for me to do
[55:51] even brother branham tried to do it i'm
[55:52] leaving i'm going up there with my
[55:54] family leaving his ministry all that he
[55:56] said no no and brother
[55:58] god show brother you do this and this is
[56:00] how you end up a bum
[56:02] remember he showed him that
[56:05] so you could do it he had a right to do
[56:06] it but he said no no i'm going to stay

[56:17] listen
[56:19] for the most part i'm living life
[56:20] accountable to the body of christ
[56:23] because when i need correction when i
[56:25] need influence that's the influence i
[56:28] want to be underneath not social media
[56:30] not all kinds of preachers friends we
[56:33] ought to be thankful for the message of
