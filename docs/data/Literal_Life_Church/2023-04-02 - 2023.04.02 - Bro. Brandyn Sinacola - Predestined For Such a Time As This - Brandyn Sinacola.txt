TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just before we read Esther not to keep you standing too long but um I you know you get studying and things and forget that today was Palm Sunday and so um you know I just I was thinking uh there's there's a song that the Gaithers sing uh Palms of victory and um you know I I thought about singing it and then I thought about not singing it and I decided not to sing it um actually Ike if you could make me sound a little bit better just my normal speaking voice that would be fantastic so you know we're just thankful to the Lord and as we come up on Easter it's just it's it's good to reflect on him and I was grateful for the songs that Michael sing this morning because really when he was coming into the city of Jerusalem they were they were praising him hosanna in the highest and the king is coming he's the king the Lord Jesus and um you know it's just that's what we're here for this morning is to worship him every Sunday every day amen amen Esther chapter 4 and um sister Genie you can put up that first slide if you want to with the scripture or I'll just let you fly you you just follow me if you can and we'll do that she's good at it so Esther 4 chapter uh Esther chapter four verse 8. and I'm just going to skip a little bit here just a set of context also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushon to destroy them to which uh to show it unto Esther and declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go and unto the unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make requests before him for her people and if you skip down to verse 11 says all the king's servants this is Esther's reply to Mordecai all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death now she's focusing on on this part of that law but I want you to notice the next thing she says says accept such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live so Esther here is expressing that there's this threat of Grace in this law that no you can't just approach the king but if the king holds out a scepter then you'll live but she don't focus on that she focuses on the part that it's judgment but I have not been called to come unto the king these 30 days verse 14. and this is mordecai talking back to her for if thou all together Hold Us thy peace at this time then shout their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou in thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you and father we've sung the songs Lord we've we've laid our garments down and Lord we're just Fanning you with Palm leaves now we're laying on before you and we're we've sang hosanna in the highest and Lord you came to restore to us the joy of of your salvation the Salvation that you've given so freely to us and so father I pray God that you would accept our praise that you would Lord just let it be water over us now father and and as we just water you with our praise now we ask that you wash Us by the water of your word help us each one to get out of the way father lord they're they're maybe some Lord who Lord I'm not their favorite preacher maybe some Lord can't can't stand the sound of my voice I can't hardly stand it myself but father I just ask Lord that your word father would penetrate that you would help us to lay all those things down now and Lord just hear hear from you in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated just a couple um just want to take a minute and recap um I've been trying to finish up the Book of Esther the last couple times that I've preached and hopefully you're not growing tired of it um but I've just every time I open it um I and it's kind of silly you would think it would we would treat it different and I and I should but I every time I pick up the Book of Esther and I start to read something else jumps out at me and finally it kind of it's kind of funny but I kind of got scared of it and I was like oh my and I shut the book one day and I thought man this just keeps opening up and I it's like I don't know what to do what do I what if I ruin this um but I'm grateful I'm grateful to the Lord and even I mean even last night and study you read something and something else just jumps out and this morning reading it and seeing there that you know Esther she's she knows the law that you can't come before the king unless unless he holds out a scepter but she focuses on the part that she could die instead of the part that the queen she found favor once with the King and that he could hold out a scepter and that she would live but she doesn't focus on that and and you know we'll get into it more but many times we don't focus on the grace of God we focus on the Judgment of God and if you're the bride of Christ that judgment isn't for you amen so let's recap real quickly here brother John used to say I'll speak quick you listen fast was the richest and most notable King in the Persian Empire he in that types of Christ over in Daniel 10 13 we talked about the Prince of Persia it's the spiritual warfare waging against God's people their spirits on Nations brother Branham talked about the spirit on Nation he talked about the spirit on this nation and in the scripture we see it plainly that we can take what he said type it right back to the scripture that in Daniel's day there was a Prince of Persia that was warring against the Saints it was actually coming against the prayers that Daniel was praying for him and his people uh and then we we typed how the spirits on this age and and it's Waging War against us and but then we found over in Daniel that even though we could get we could get discouraged that their spirits and principalities in high places and and the way that the scripture words that we could get discouraged in that and we could focus on that but we found that Daniel the angel told Daniel he said but Michael your prince is on your side Michael your prince is standing for you and then we saw how the ages overlap between Daniel and Ezra and Esther and Nehemiah and and you know I just I just said go back and you know follow the church ages brother rappers is ministering on and then you can see where brother Branham over in the seals he talks about the seals overlapping each other and so you just have all of those types and shadows in the Book of Esther that um to me to me the Redemption story is a nester the whole Redemptive story it's it's a beautiful story and if we read it we could we could make plays about it and they do we could make movies about it and they do but there's there's a deeper meaning behind it and it's it's that that threat of Grace and and it's it's just the story of redemption to me are you with me this morning I know I said that some of you might it might not be your favorite teacher and you can't you know stand the sound of my voice but give me a few amens and it'll end quickly Queen vashti in the other way it's like I didn't get any strong amen so that must be doing all right I know Seth was thinking it though queen vashti and the other women of the palace were in defiance and rejection of the king's word and then with how um you know the rejection it's just a perfect type of uh the rejection of God's word by a church and now over in Revelations it talks about the mother of harlots and her daughters and we we found a deeper meaning because um you know many many especially sisters afterwards but it jumped out to me even even while I was preaching it it just jumped out to me more that we found a deeper meaning behind the king putting away of Ashley just for not accepting the invitation of his word and we found that it's because the king is Desiring a bride who's connected with his heart and who's reflecting his glory and when vashti did that she rejected the king and and she was not reflecting his glory it was rejecting his word and and we know if you reject the word of God there's only one place for you and it's in its in its death it's spiritual death we found that a decree to go find a uh the king a wife and and we type that with the scripture that says go search the the highways and the byways and compel them to come go go find the king of bride go find go find someone to come to this wedding and then we talked about uh Queen Esther and her display of the beauty of the character of Christ and and how she was a beautiful branch predestinated and elected to be Queen and she was chosen for her character and the desire for the king uh uh the king and for and for Christ our desire for Christ and and so that lies within our hearts amen and then we found an accuser last time we found an accuser was Haman the agagite and we traced that back because the scripture was so specific to make sure we knew Haman was an agagite and and we started following that back and we traced it back and we found him always fighting against God's people they come up out of Egypt and who met him amalek emelek was was the founder of the agites and and the amalekites and so we traced that back and then we typed it with Satan you find a lot of similarities with Satan and Haman and then we a little bit further in uh Schofield wrote that amalek is a type of the Flesh and the flesh is always warring against you and so Satan is not your greatest enemy your flesh is your greatest enemy your flesh is your greatest enemy and and uh brother Dan can you go get me a Sharpie you'll understand why later you got to stick around for it and so we typed that back and and we found that and so we found that Haman was trying to just to destroy God's people as Satan is trying to destroy God's people and and then we saw that but you know Paul wrote speaking of of amalek and and and Haman and typing the Flesh and things Paul wrote we found in Romans that when you sin and you're a Christian it's no longer you that sins Paul said you separate yourself from that it's no longer you who sin but it's it's the law of sin that works in your flesh so we found that you're not not now this isn't a license to sin you're dead wrong if you go take it as that but what I what I mean by is we found that when you sin it that does not get held to your charge that does not get held that gets hard that gets held to the flesh the charge of your flesh which is not you it's separate from the inner man amen and then we saw that in Deuteronomy 25 said the remembrance of emelek will be blotted out forever so you have a promise that one day that you'll lay down this flesh you'll lay down the Flesh and you'll take on your your theophany your Heavenly Body and then this flesh won't bother you anymore and we look forward to the day we pray Lord hasten the day and so one thing that I've been stumbled upon and and I think it might have been when we were in Florida the Lord showed me this and I and I was just thinking Lord I can type you as the king but that King was a drunkard and I don't know how to make that fit but then we found and and then I I just the Lord opened this up in a Nestor chapter 1 and verse 7 and it says and they gave them drink and vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and Royal Wine in abundance according to the state of the king what's that mean that's true this this King was he's an alcoholic and the drinking was according to the law none did compel so they weren't forced to take the drink for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house all the ministers the fivefold ministry that they should do according to Every Man's pleasure so as much as somebody wanted to drink the ministry the the the these uh the king's uh appointed officers they were instructed give them drink as much as they want give them drink well what is wine wine is the stimulation of Revelation but what's that mean is as much Revelation as you want the King has provided for you you can go get Revelation it's there it's it's it's free for you to take the King has said give them as much Revelation give them as much wine as they want let them have their fill the king gives us Revelation liberally so then in James 1 5 it says if any of you is deficient in wisdom let him ask of of the giving God who gives to everyone liberally and ungrudgingly without reproach and fault finding and it will be given him all you have to do is ask all you have to do is pray Lord give me more wine give me more Lord I'm thirsty I'm craving something there's a craving when an alcoholic goes goes you know he's he's struggling with that he's an alcoholic then he craves his body actually craves that alcohol it craves that substance and there's something within us that's craving Revelation that's craving the king amen so all you have to do is ask if you lack and the King will give it to you amen so this morning I want to take say are you with me this morning okay we want to take Satan's plan to cause spiritual death uh uh we want to take that plan and just take it a little bit further this morning and and so um I want to talk to you about this this heiman a little bit more and and how he was a Deceiver and Haman was a deceiver and he manipulates and he he tricks the king to destroy God's people and we know that nobody can pull a fast one over on God right so Satan's not going to trick God so you know again there's there's just certain things I can't make fit you know exactly thank you brother Dan there's certain things that I that I can't make fit you know exactly perfectly but but we know that we know this that we found that Satan had to come to God in order to get to job remember he said have you considered my servant job so here Satan has to come this is exactly what this is Satan has to come to the king in order to to to do anything to God's people and and we might say well that's not fair why would God allow Satan to do something like that to me but that's because God has God has faith in you God knows that Satan can give his very best to you and if you lean back on God and surrender to God Satan cannot have you he cannot pull one over on you you will be Victorious and it'll draw character and listen Satan will actually draw an attribute out of you that God knew was there and so when Satan goes and he says okay you can you can go do that to my servant Esther you can go do that to my servant Mike go ahead have you considered them go ahead and have throw your very best and then when Satan goes and then they come out of that trial and they're they're they're looking more like Jesus Christ than than God says uh April Fools so it it can be it can be hard to swallow though sometimes that why would God allow me to go through this why would God allow me to experience this and it's a hard thing to swallow but you got to understand also that that let me say it with this way and then and I don't mean this to offend you but that that understanding is something that's a stronger meat and and a stronger meat you got you gotta chew it better you can't just drink it down like milk you have to chew that better so it's it's not for for babies spiritually and if you're there that's fine keep drinking the milk you'll eventually graduate to to solid foods amen that's all right and then we there's a a quote I found and it says um and why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into closer fellowship with God so that's that's the reason you go through troubles that's the reason that you're experiencing sorrow is to bring you into closer fellowship with Jesus Christ now we don't want to hear that in in uh you know when when we still feel the pain from it but one day you'll look back and you'll see God's purpose you can talk to anybody anybody there's there's there's been things you've experienced no matter how how far you are in your Christian Journey there's things that you've experienced that you can look back and say I didn't understand it then but now I do now I understand it I feel I I feel closer to God in some in some cases you might even be able to say I thank God that I went through that because if I wouldn't have gone through that I wouldn't be where I'm at today when Esther was a LED away from her home by the Persians uh Persian soldiers I'm sure she didn't understand what was going on when Joseph was his brothers betrayed him and they threw him in the pit I'm sure he didn't understand in fact the scripture says he didn't understand what was going on he didn't understand why he went through the things he went through he didn't understand why he was in prison in the depths of prison and then he didn't maybe understand why all he's in prison but yet he's overseeing the prison Lord I don't I don't I don't understand you I don't understand how how can you make me go through this and yet you have this blessing but here I am still in this situation I don't understand Lord but then he he realizes that you know it's it's God's perfected plan and so we can't see forward we can only Look Backwards and so he gets at the right hand of pharaoh and and maybe he's thankful for the blessing but he he still doesn't understand Lord why why am I here why did you choose me Lord how many of you asked God that why did you choose me Lord but yet then all of a sudden his family comes they've experienced the famine and they come and and Joseph is there and he's able to bring Salvation to his family you're able to bring Salvation to your family if you're feeding on the grains of God then you're able to give that to your family you're able to let them drink from you to eat from you you're able to give that out freely freely give as you freely receive amen and I'll just say this ahead of time you've been chosen for such a time as this you've been chosen to feed on this word in this hour in this age so that you can give it out to others you've been chosen for such a time as this Haman had no real power of his own the king is the only one with the power to give Haven Haman access to his people and and I and I and I just throw this out there call me crazy I don't mean to go out on a limb I'm not trying to start Doctrine but to me as I was going through this one morning I I a thought was triggered and I went and I looked in the third seal and I thought oh my goodness I think the seals are an Esther call me crazy that's all right let me just believe that anyway would you Haman had no real power of his own Haman could look like the king and get the people to bow to him but he wasn't the king he wasn't the king listen to me now Satan can get you to act on Temptation Satan can get you to do things in your life that he's tempted you to do that he's placed before you but that's but but that's as far as it goes that's not your identity he's not the king of your heart Revelation says a voice cries hurt not the oil and the wine and we talked about the wine there and The King The King has complete control over who gets wine and how much they get and there's there's a revelation Esther has to catch of her purpose Revelation has to come through the Holy Spirit we know that Christ is the only one who gives it but once Esther catches that revelation that she was placed in the palace possibly for such a time as they were going through to to go before the king and bring Salvation to her people when Esther catches that I want you to catch this for your own life she holds more power than what even Haman thought she had Haman thought she he had more power than the queen he was he was at the right hand of God he was at the right hand of God and yet he was cast out and the queen always had even back when Lucifer was there with God you were in God's mind and you had more power than Satan would ever have even if he stayed at the right hand of God you would have been placed between between Satan and God you would have been set right there next to the king God would have said Satan scoot over My bride is sitting next to me but now he's cast out of heaven so he has no hold he has no say he can just go to and fro like a like a lion with no teeth seeking whom he may devour but he can't touch you unless he comes to God first but when you catch the revelation of who you are in Jesus Christ you hold more power listen to me this is what came to me and study Satan I think will be surprised at how much power you hold you'll do things to disrupt the Gates of Hell you'll do things to disrupt the enemy's Kingdom and he'll say I didn't realize they had that power what where is this coming from why is this people doing this to me what this God I had your plan figured out what is this what is this God can I have an audience with you because I don't understand what just happened what did they just do what did Jason just do to my kingdom how did how did Jason just pick up that gate and and carry it off I thought I had him Satan thought he had you but you picked up the gate and you started walking and Satan said what is going on right now how does he do in this he don't even have locks he's got a nice beard though and God just says Satan you haven't seen nothing yet you haven't seen nothing yet Esther had to choose to go before the King after not feeling his presence for 30 days think about that how many times have you gone in a dry spell how many times have you been in a season that feels like a spiritual desert and and you go and you go you you come before God and you come up maybe you come up to the Altar and you bow down at the altar and you're just thinking Lord I don't I don't know why I'm here right now I don't feel you I can see I can look around and look at look at the people look at the ones who are rejoicing But Here I Am Lord I don't I'm I'm kneeling before you I just want you to speak to me I I want to feel just a little bit of what they feel I don't feel nothing right now Lord I I lift my hands and yet there's just there's nothing Lord what where are you sometimes you cry out Lord where are you God knows where you are and he's there the whole time but maybe he wants to just step back a little bit just to see what what are you are you just here for the feeling of me or are you here for me are you just here for the blessing of me or do you want me I want you to walk God wants you to want him God says I want you to want me I I don't listen the gifts are great the the the shouting is great the presence is great but what if what if what if all that went away I just want you to want me and that's what we that's what we that's what Esther had to make a decision that's what we have to make a decision when you don't feel the presence of God keep presenting yourself before God I'm here Lord to present myself to you Lord restore to me the joy of thy salvation father reveal to me the secret of your heart that's what it is that's listen when you when you grow in the lord it's not about his presence as much as we we want his presence don't get me wrong but it's about his heart Lord reveal I want to feel your presence but that does me no good if I don't understand your heart revealed to me the secret of your heart and Esther is realizing she's presented with this this this situation this urgency an urgent matter Lord I need to come before your throne I need to know that I'm touching the Throne of God right now I need to know father that I have your ear I need to know that I have your heart and I need to know that you have mine father I'm coming one more time but it was 30 days 21 days Daniel Prayed and he thought God where are you Lord do you hear my prayer how many of you have prayed that I have that's all right I have Lord do you even hear my prayer right now I I it just it feels like it just it it's just there goes my prayer I want it to go this way but it's just it's just falling empty and Lord I just I don't but yet Esther had to had to hold on to the promise that there's a threat of Grace there's a threat of Grace left for me we don't feel his inspiration sometimes we don't feel we don't feel we don't feel but where did God say in the word go off of your feelings but the King was available the entire time your king knows your voice he hears your prayer and the moment you speak him and and you know when we're in the depths of Despair we don't think of these things but what did the angel say to Daniel when he got to him he said I heard your prayer the first time and I work I fought my way to you but I got held up but then your Prince Michael came and then I got through to you so when you listen oh my goodness when you feel like your prayer is is Fallen flat keep praying because all's that mean is that in the other dimension that you can't see that your Prince Michael is fighting to get to you and he might be experiencing resistance but guess what that resistance can only last so long because there's an appointed day and appointed time when your prayer is going to be answered when you'll see the manifestation of that prayer you're praying for a loved one that's lost you're praying for for your marriage you're praying for this situation you're praying for a job and you're you're praying and you're praying and you're praying but there's going to be one day when you see the manifestation of that prayer and that's just God fighting his way to you God fighting his way to you that's Jesus Christ himself fighting his way to you are you with me this morning the king sees you all the time you can't hide from God you choose to sin you can't hide from God you choose to give to Temptation you can't hide from God Adam and Eve could not hide from God we've heard it many times and I you you know this like the back of your hand but I'm going to remind you of it because you might be in the depths of discouragement this morning but but by the preaching of the word the cloud can be lifted away and you can see the what you already know but God come down in the garden and he's Adam Adam where are you Adam where are you God knew exactly where they were I don't you you think out of however big this Garden was God could have went down this path but he starts walking this way because Adam's over behind the bushes and he could have went off in this path at the deer trod but he kept walking this way Adam Adam where are you and he could have went this way and he could have went that way but he kept walking because he knew where Adam was the whole time amen Esther was chosen to be his Queen and 30 days did not change that no matter what you feel about yourself this morning no matter how long it's been since you've felt the presence of God that doesn't change the fact that you've been called to be his Queen you are who you are and that doesn't change not in the economy of God Haman had the law Haman had the law but Esther had the king's heart we transitioned from law by Moses to Grace through Jesus Christ that's why those people might not have even known what they were saying but Hosanna hosanna in the highest Hosanna the King has come the King has come they didn't maybe didn't even understand what they were going through but now we do today we we've we've we've known it we've felt it we feel that we we not all the time but we we know he saved us by Revelation by the stimulation of his wine we know that and so we can say I have his heart they have the law but I have his heart Esther became an invincible Army she became God's letter of Grace to his people Esther was the voice crying out the spirit and the bride say come but we know a spirit can't can't talk unless it has a voice to work through so the bride became the voice to come come she was the voice that was crying out she was the voice crying out salvation that's why you can impart salvation to others it's because not by your works but you can you can bring them to Christ because you've been that that is lying within you that power is lying within you Esther's Banquets last thing on that point on the wine Esther's Banquets were called the Banquets of wine when we come together we should be expecting revelation we should be expecting what we have need of we come together for revelation Esther needed to approach the king but there was a law in place that she could be killed if she went to him God's law was that he's too holy for anyone to approach so I want to take you back just for a moment and bring this up to speed here are you with me this morning God's law was that he's too holy for anyone to approach unless he bid come and he bid Moses come you can go read it in the Old Testament it was death if you touched that mountain God said don't let not even a hoof Touch This Mountain it or it'll have to die Moses said Lord I want to see you God said no man can see me and live so you have all these things that God was so holy and there was no way to to commune with his people there was no way they could approach him because it was death when when uh when when the Tabernacle was set up there was only one man who could enter into the holiest of holies where God was and even then he had to do it just right or it was death so you see this law of of the Persians was only inspired by the law of God right you can't approach God that that was what was there but I want you to show I want to show you a threat of Grace this morning I want to show you if we're typing us as Esther now that you have an audience before the king you have an open door we know that Jesus rent The Veil and when he rent The Veil that was that any man could come into the holiest of holies any man could experience that but watch this now Genesis 49 10 the scepter shall not depart from Judah remember the king had to hold out a scepter and if he held out a scepter they could touch it and then they could approach the king but this is God's law was there but watch how he transitions because he wants to he wants you as his Queen to come to him all the time any time the scepter shall not depart from Judah he's the lion of the tribe of Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh which is Christ come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be numbers 24 17 just picking it up there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel Psalms 45 6 thy Throne o God is forever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom as a right scepter you have a scepter that's held out to you all the time Hebrews 1 8 but unto the son he saith thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom oh friends you have a scepter held out to you you you you can approach the king anytime There Is No Death for you any longer you you you can't you won't die coming to The King The King he separated that he said no I don't want them to die but God's law can only be changed listen the the in the Persian Empire the king's law could only be changed by another law It could only be changed by another law so this law is lying there that nobody can see me I am God nobody can approach me but then he says you know what I'm going to write another law over here that my son Jesus Christ will come down he'll be the scepter that the people can touch they can touch and they can come before my throne with whatever their petition be my queen I'll give you half the kingdom all you have to do is approach me I want you to to approach me and so God set that other law in order so that we could have free access to him whatever Esther thought about herself she had to lay down she had to lay it down any fear of death she had to hold on to the threat of Grace that the king could hold out his scepter to her there's been a scepter risen up from the Throne of God that says whosoever will let him come so I'm going to boldly say to you this morning it doesn't matter what your past is it doesn't matter what your present is it doesn't matter what you've done what you did last night doesn't matter what you'll go home and do today you have a scepter held out to you you are the queen you have to lay hold of that threat of Grace and accept it and come to the father's throne come to your king this morning Esther 5 verse 1. I know everyone's probably wondering why does he have Sharpies I'll get to that in just a moment Esther 5 verse 1. now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner core of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house so Esther's made the decision all right I'm gonna do it I don't know what's going to happen but I'm gonna go before my king and she puts on her garment Esther had to put her Garment of Praise on from the lowest point in her life she turned to the king with praise you fell low this morning you're going through a dark time put on your Garment of Praise Beauty for Ashes a Garment of Praise for your heaviness put on your Garment of Praise and come before the king you say but I I just my hands are so heavy I don't know if I can lift them lift up holy hands there's a scripture and it kept coming to my mind and it escapes me now but lift lift up your hands you holy people praise your God praise him praise him in the highest praise him in the lowest when you're in your lowest lift your hands and praise him I I'm I'm this is just beautiful to me but when you go look at the armor of God they were the the in and Paul was writing about it he writes about the shield of faith that Shield of Faith was the size of a the door of your house and it was a hard wood it was a solid wood and so I can imagine That's Heavy enough in itself but then they would take six skins of an animal skins and they would wrap that shield with animal skin six of them so you can imagine I don't know how in the world they held this thing up but who cares how you held it up it was saving your life but the thing about this The Shield was and the thing about leather is it's porous and so in the winter time I hate winter here my hands dry out and and they'll start cracking and bleeding and so I have to I have to apply lotion and I know that sounds sissified but it's better than shaking your hand and getting blood all over you so you're when when leather gets dry it's like your hands and it'll dry out and it can crack it becomes brittle it becomes no good for protection you know you get your shoes um this is your shoes you need you know if you have real leather you need to condition them because that keeps it porous that keeps it that keeps it soft and subtle so that it won't split on you as you're less than leather this morning so what they had to do was they had to apply oil on their Shield every day you have to apply the Holy Spirit to your Shield that's what gives you Faith as the Holy Ghost you have to apply that every day but then when they were going into battle if the enemy was going to be shooting fiery darts they had to they had to baptize the shield and water they had to pour they had to soak this Shield because when leather gets wet it'll actually soak it up it soaks up the leather and and it becomes you you could wring it out but it'll hold it and so they had to they had to fill they had to just water the shield with praise the water of your worship to make yours to make your Shield that when the enemies fiery darts hit your Shield it's so the enemy when you're when you're praising your God and the enemy's firing fiery darts at you it's hitting your Shields I can't get past it I can't get through their Shield they're praising the Lord how is this possible I've thrown everything I can at them and they're still praising the Lord and it's just it's quenching the fiery darts of the enemy so water water the Lord with your praise keep your Shield keep it keep the anointing of the Holy Spirit on it stay in the spirit and water it with your praise amen where am I Esther 5 chapter 2. and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court listen to how beautiful this is this is this is the best love story that's right brother Mike hug her and close to you this is beautiful when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hands so Esther Drew near and touched the top of the scepter you see the king the scepter is there we just heard in the scripture that the scepter is there it's always there it's always reaching out but you have to come touch it you have to approach it then said the king unto her What wilt thou listen oh my goodness despite what Esther felt about herself despite all the fear she had I'm gonna tell you something beautiful in a moment despite all of that she obtained favor not did the king didn't just only say come come unto me he didn't only just hold the scepter out he didn't only just drive the scepter in the ground of Jesus Christ stick it on a cross so that it's always there the scepter is Always There Before the Throne of God he didn't just do that he said what is your request Esther what's what's your request look at oh my goodness I love this this jumped out to me too last night what will thou Queen Esther so he didn't just say What wilt thou my queen he didn't just say what will it thou Esther he said What wilt thou Queen Esther what's what's your what is I just I want to call you by name because I love the sound of your name what is thy request it shall be given you and he doesn't just leave it there what what do you want Esther he says my Queen Esther what what do you what's your request I'll give you half the kingdom if you ask for it it wasn't just ask ask for anything Esther ask ask me for something it was think big Esther what's the biggest thing you can think of I'll I'll give you half of my kingdom you want half of the Kingdom it's yours he just what what favor she obtain with him what what beauty she be held in his eyes and when you come to Christ what beauty you hold when you come before him you know you're you're crying or whatever it is you you have tears Lord this is just too heavy for me what is it what is it my queen what is it Queen Aubry this is I'm talking about the Lord I'm not going to give you anything you want what is it my queen I'll give it to just think big ask big what is it do you need your marriage back ask me for it my queen do you need healing in your mind ask me for it my queen do you need the joy of your salvation restored my queen just asked me ask me my queen do you hear him talk I I prayed just take my annoying voice out of it this morning do you hear the do you hear the sound of the king's voice my queen asked me this morning whatever you have need of ask me this takes it to a little bit deeper level to me and I don't know I'll be honest I don't know if this is true but they say that in history that the queen was so nervous and she was so anxious that the King was sitting on his throne and I guess he'd be up here and he was sitting on his throne and maybe he was he was doing his business for the day and there was some situation in front of him and he was looking Stern on it and he said he noticed out of the corner of his eye someone standing there and so he had the look of Fury in his eyes and he looked over at her and when he saw Esther and she saw the anger in the king's eyes She fainted and when the king saw her faint in fear he leapt out of his chair and he ran to Esther and he picked her up in his arms and he started comforting her with sweet words he started comforting Esther with words of of my queen what is what is this what it why why have you fainted why why have you grown weary My Queen what is it that's that's got your heart troubled why are you growing weary and well doing what is it my queen what don't don't be afraid how many God every time he came to somebody it is I fear not do you hear his voice this morning it is I fear not ask what you would and I'll give you I'll give you half of the Kingdom it makes me think of the story and again I I don't know if this is if this is true but this is it made a lot of sense when the prodigal son left home and he came back I've always pictured it in this Farm like you know Farmland in Ohio I mean hopefully it had more Rolling Hills there but you know it's it's just a lot of acreage and there's one house up on you know the path you know you follow the path up to the house and and that was what the sun had to walk down was this path but I heard recently and again I don't know if it's true so I'm not starting Doctrine or anything but it's just it makes the story more beautiful for me in in we're you know in the in that time it was it was villages and so the village that the father lived in would have had other houses leading up to it and so to come into town the sun when he made that decision to come to the father he would have had to come to the road that entered into the village and he would have it wasn't just an open road with nobody there he would have had to walk past the village and when that when that father got word so word had to spread jump from house to house your son's coming your suds your son's coming that young man would have had to walk through the village past every wandering eye knowing what he had done but when he showed up at the start of the village and word hit the father it says when the father saw him afar off the father took off running through the village past every eye that wanted to see he didn't care he ran to his son and he put his arm around his son and then they walked through the village back home arm and arm that's what our father does to us don't don't worry this morning about who's watching your father is running to you this morning taking you in his arms and he's saying Come On Son come home come with me let me let me love you Let Me Love You amen whatever was going on at that moment Esther came into view the king stopped to run to her could you imagine what if it was word that the enemy had Advanced on the kingdom and they were starting to attack over in the far Village when the king saw Esther that business stopped and he ran to Esther maybe Haman was complaining about her and her people maybe Haman was there laying his accusations again before the king Haman could have accusing her people but the king hushed everyone because his bride had just walked into the room he gave his full attention to Esther oh my Haman had become a powerful adversary Esther felt she couldn't go to the king because Haman had put her in a place of death but Esther had to be reminded she was the queen nobody was between her and the key the the devil tries to get between us and our King sometimes through emotional discouragements and through disappointments in life through complexes through the busyness through sin that he himself presented and Satan tries to put that but the biggest block that he can do is put the lie that he's placed something between you and Christ because there is nothing that because it can become between you and Christ God is not out to embarrass you I've been thinking about this because I think many times we get afraid of God because we think what if I get embarrassed what if he God why would you ask me to do that it's embarrassing God's not out to embarrass you he's a gentleman he loves you you are his Queen all you have to do is move towards him and he'll run to you he'll run to you oh my I want to read to you a scripture that kind of became a theme early on in our Thursday night class overcoming sexual Temptation James 5 13. are you with me a little bit longer I don't think I got much more to go is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he committeth sins they shall be forgiven him hold on to that scripture if you have sin in your life hold to that scripture because if you've committed sin the scripture says you shall be forgiven and notice it's all in this this realm of prayer these scriptures of prayer it's it's encompassed in that to pray confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three and a half years Elias was a man subject to the lust that you experience Elias was a man that was subject to the tiredness you experience Lord I'm just too tired to come to you today Elias was a man subject to everything you went through that you go through and yet he prayed and it wasn't just you know the rain is coming and so you know Lord I we just we got this please don't let it rain today he shut the heavens by his prayer for three and a half years but I love that the scripture doesn't just stop there it it goes on and it says and he prayed again he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought for forth her fruit it wasn't just I mean it was just enough to say wow he prayed and it shut the heavens it was three and a half years but then he prayed again and it brought the rain Brethren if any of you do air from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the air of his ways shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sin I'm trying to I want to get to you this morning I I I just want to be a voice crying out to you to con to convert you if you've aired get back it's just as easy as as stepping back out of the prayer line father forgive me okay you're back in come on let's go it's that easy it's that simple all you have to do is ask all you have to do is pray that word convert means to get him to repent and turn back to the love of Christ turn back to the love of Christ maybe you need the love of Christ in your heart but maybe you just need to come back to realize that he loves you come back to the love of Christ this morning every attempt to destroy and accuse God's people to the king that Haman tried backfired on him and the King's Queen and God's people were exalted so often we fear the devil We Fear sickness we feel we fear harm We Fear falling to his devices but you've been given power over the enemy you've been given access to the King's throne now uh Esther seven and and I'm I'm winding down can you stay with me just a few more minutes Esther seven perfect sister Genie and on the second day as they were drinking wine after the feast the King again said to Esther what is your wish so listen this isn't just a one-time thing God says my queen what's your wish here he is again what is your wish Queen Esther it shall be granted you and what is your request even to half of the kingdom it shall be fulfilled then Queen Esther answered if I have found favor in your sight O King and if it pleased the king let my life be granted me for my wish and my people for my request for we have been told sold I and my people to be destroyed to be killed and to be annihilated show that next that next screen sister Jeannie is that my picture so this is from The Sight and Sounds Queen Esther and and I just told you this is what started it for me down this this road but this is just a beautiful depiction there's the king they're at the Feast of wine there's Haman that she invited and here's Esther trying to make her petition known before the king I just I love this image because you can she's she's in distress she's she's she's got her enemy in front of the king with her she invited her enemy into the presence of the king now I know you've heard this before it's been preached many times a lot more eloquent than I can say it but when the enemy's bothering you bring him into your atmosphere don't go into his bring him into your atmosphere bring him before the king because watch this is what happens go to the next slide and the King arose in his Wrath from the wine drinking oh wait a minute I think I missed one sister genius you can stay right there I must have missed a part let's see if we had been sold merely as slaves men and women I would have been silent for our Affliction she's saying is not to be compared with the loss to the king if I die this is a great loss to the king then King Azar said to Queen Esther who is he I mean just the king just becomes unglued Esther says Ah listen it's it's this is no small request if I wouldn't have come to you if I was just going to be a slave I wouldn't have come to you but this is this is spiritual death for me I need you Lord I need you right now and the King just gets Furious sorry I think I forgot to put this up there just who is he who is he and where is he and Who Dares do this to my queen and Esther said a foe an enemy this wicked Haman then Haman was terrified before the king and queen see we fear the devil we fear we fear demons We Fear what what Satan can do to us we fear what we're going through but when you bring Satan into the presence of your king and you say my king this is no light request I'm making it's I this is spiritual death if I if you don't help me and he says where is he where is he who's defiling my queen who's bothering my queen and then Satan's over there and he's getting nervous oh no what's this what's now what's going to happen no no it's I didn't I didn't realize this is this is the queen I didn't realize she had this much power and now the king's mad I what do I do and the King arose in his wrath from the wine drinking he was so angry he left the banquet of wine and went into the palace Garden but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king the harm he was trying to bring on Esther got flipped around and now he's scared because he realizes I have an end This Is the End listen you've heard it many times but I'm reminding you this morning remind Satan of his end remind him of his end this is why he hates you this is why he despises you because your end is more glorious than his end but watch this now so he's he's fearful so the king leaves and then all this is going on and then Haman Esther's they call it a couch I guess it's like one of them fainting couches I don't know they call it a couch bed it's it's whichever one it is regardless of what it is Haman falls on the couch where Esther was and he's begging her don't let this happen to me and the King returned from the palace Garden to the place where they were drinking wine as Haman was falling under the couch with Esther and the King said will he even assault the queen in my presence are you kidding me right now it's not you're not just gonna go and and try to take my queen from me when I'm when you think I'm not looking but now you're gonna do it in my presence are you joking in my own house as the word left the mouth of the king they covered haman's face they're already jumping all over it hey we know what's going to happen let's get this guy so they hang Haman on The Gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai the very thing the very trap that Satan has set for you God says go hang him on it I'm gonna throw you in a pit that you're not gonna enjoy not gonna be no bubble bath then the Wrath of the King was pacified so you can imagine just just pull back the curtain of Heaven and God is getting furious as time goes on God's getting furious at Satan why are you defiling my people so much this has got to stop and he's just you know put on my armor just Mountain up his armor he's going to battle now and there's going to be a day he says enough and then your enemy the accuser of the brethren will be cast into the pit oh glorious day amen amen you can stand to your feet because I feel like we just need to Rejoice there I mean there's there's just so many beautiful things in this but I want to so the Jews celebrate in Purim this I think it's pronounced I can't remember how it's pronounced but anyway Purim I think it's pronounced Purim to celebrate the saving of the Jews in Esther's time I'm going to put a Sharpie up here you're welcome to it you don't have to go home and do it if you want to but during Purim they read the story of Esther now it's Jewish accustomed that you can't interrupt the the rabbi as he's reading so they wait until the word Haman is said in the story of Esther and when Haman is expressed they start booing Boo and they got these you know the noise makers it's almost like our fourth of July I mean that maybe they you know set off fireworks if they could in the synagogue and they'll and they'll start stamping their feet and the significance behind this is they an old old Jewish custom they would write haman's name on stones or on wood and when the story of of Esther was was read aloud when Haman was named you know his his name was said they would take these stones and they would start slamming them together or whatever they wrote his name on they would slam it together and what they would do is by the end of the story heyman's name would be erased from whatever they wrote him on so the significance of stamping their feet was because your heel is the least sensitive part of your body sometimes it hurts if you step on something with your heel but it's the least sensitive part the heel is also typed or or linked with amalek the flesh so when they start stamping their feet they're stomping out the flesh so if you have something in your life this morning that you want to take before your king and you want to stamp it out in your life you're welcome to come up here and take a sharpie write it on the bottom of your shoe because every time you walk you're going to be walking with that devil under your feet don't just make that like some you know fancy ritual I'm trying to make but let it be something from your heart that you want to write that you don't have to do it don't nobody if nobody comes up takes a Sharpie I'm not offended well go home and write it on there and then when you walk and eventually as you walk what you wrote on the bottom of your shoe is going to be erased and it goes back to that scripture that amalek will be blotted out from under heaven amen amen sister Jeannie put up that last quote I got speaking of Moses and he stayed just exactly with God's word because he sought God first and he knew his position he knowed he was born for that age to manifest the word of God at that time I'm speaking this over your life this morning that you know your position in Christ and that you know and I pray that God will drop the faith in your heart the revelation that you've been born for such a time as this you've been born in an age when pornography and sexuality is rampant and sometimes we look at it and we think Lord I don't know how in the world am I going to overcome this this is just it's tempting me I Fall to Temptation I it can be anything I this is an addictive age put whatever you want there I Lord I I got to raise kids in this generation how Lord you have been born for such a time as this you've been born for such a time when the voice of the Bride is calling out and saying come the spirit speaking through her come you have been born positionally placed for such a time as this amen for the Michael sing something because nothing's coming to mind [Music] I'm here Lord to present myself to you and I know there's nothing more that I can do will you wash me in your righteous Ness [Music] and present myself to you I am here Lord to present myself to you [Music] and I know there's nothing more that I can do you wash me and dress me in your righteousness until you're finally through I will come and present myself to you amen just present yourself this morning just present yourself regardless of how you feel about yourself present yourself to the king you are the queen that holds the king's heart if you don't believe that take my word for it we're happy to pray with you but take your petitions ask what you would and he'll give you half of the Kingdom God bless you this morning as you worship God bless you [Music] to present myself to you oh I'm here
