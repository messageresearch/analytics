[43:45] believe or a scheduling for a test so
[43:47] let's how may be in prayer for my
[43:49] brother that's why I forgot my mic
[43:50] because he reminds me of those things as
[43:52] they come out but I sure love him and
[43:54] brother Brandon he's listening we miss
[43:55] him and we just pray that God will
[43:57] strengthen his body give him healing for
[43:59] his body and whatever we don't know

[44:16] enjoyed the songs hope you enjoyed that
[44:17] song it's just something so
[44:19] extra Godly about four-part Harmony I
[44:22] don't know what it is no offense to the
[44:26] sister singing but man it's just
[44:27] something
[44:28] something so real about it I don't know
[44:31] praise the Lord if you don't mind
[44:33] standing again we're going to go to the
[44:35] scripture this morning and read uh verse
[44:38] in the Ephesians the Epistle of the
[44:40] feasin Ephesians and we're going to go
[44:42] to chapter two Ephesians chapter 2.
[44:46] amen God is good amen God is good God
[44:51] bless you all the visitors are here in
[44:52] different ones we welcome you
[44:56] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8.
[45:00] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8 for by
[45:04] grace are ye saved through faith
[45:08] and that not of yourselves it is the
[45:11] gift of God
[45:13] there is nothing that we contribute when
[45:16] it comes to the gift of Salvation And
[45:19] the gift of the Holy Ghost there's
[45:20] nothing that we contribute it's a gift
[45:22] of God
[45:24] not of Works lest any man should boast
[45:28] that's why God has set it up this way
[45:29] because if we had a part in it then we
[45:32] would boast and we would take our part
[45:33] and probably glory in that but it's not
[45:36] of any of our works that we receive any
[45:38] of this from God anything that God does
[45:41] in us whether it's salvation or whether
[45:43] it's whether it's sanctification or
[45:46] whether it's He blesses us in a certain
[45:49] whatever it is the Holy Ghost it all is
[45:52] the gift of God and it's not by our
[45:54] works at all how many know that
[45:57] for we are his workmanship you're not
[46:01] your own workmanship you're not working
[46:03] on yourself
[46:04] when you come into the kingdom of God in
[46:07] his presence you have to know we are
[46:09] completely his workmanship from day one
[46:12] until he finishes the work and how many
[46:15] know the scripture he he who hath begun
[46:17] a good work will he's the one that will
[46:20] finish it
[46:21] so he is he is the one that's that that
[46:25] has all of this we are his workmanship
[46:29] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[46:33] so this is not just a a Reformation this
[46:38] is not just make god making you better
[46:40] this is a creation we are created in how
[46:44] many know that Jesus is a creator
[46:47] how many know he created the heavens and
[46:49] the Earth
[46:50] the same creator that created the
[46:53] heavens and the Earth is creating
[46:56] something in you
[46:59] you are his new creation
[47:02] so you and the reason I keep emphasizing
[47:04] this before I even preach this morning
[47:06] is that we've got to see that we are his
[47:08] workmanship and we are his creation and
[47:11] what he does is not just a little work
[47:14] it's actually him creating something in
[47:16] you the creator has come into your life
[47:18] and he's creating and anything good that
[47:21] comes out of you that's of God he
[47:23] created it in you
[47:25] looks at it a different way for we are
[47:27] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[47:30] unto good works which God hath before
[47:33] ordained that we should walk in them and
[47:36] anybody says there's no truth to
[47:38] predestination it's all through the
[47:39] Bible it's right there that we have been
[47:42] ordained before the foundation of the
[47:44] world that we should walk in the
[47:46] manifestation of Christ on this Earth
[47:47] but it's not because of your works it's
[47:50] not because of you getting better it's
[47:52] not because your own efforts it's
[47:54] because he's creating in you what he's
[47:57] going to do
[47:58] we are his workmanship
[48:01] father bless your word today as we put
[48:03] it in your hands it is your word so we
[48:06] pray that you'll bring fruit from it we
[48:08] pray in Jesus name amen God bless you
[48:10] may be seated
[48:12] now the last time we ministered we
[48:15] talked about the Holy Ghost a little bit
[48:18] I'm going to continue that series and uh
[48:21] we laid a foundation in speaking about
[48:23] the Holy Ghost uh called the Simplicity
[48:26] of Christ Paul said I fear that your
[48:29] minds would be corrupted from the
[48:30] Simplicity of Christ and so I laid that
[48:33] Foundation I'll just have a little bit
[48:35] more of that today because that's before
[48:37] we talk about the Holy Ghost what is it
[48:39] how do we know that we have it before we
[48:42] get into those things I I want to I
[48:44] wanted to speak about the Simplicity of
[48:46] Christ because the enemy had takes
[48:48] something so precious as this and he
[48:51] wants to confuse it more than any other
[48:52] doctrinal subject he'd like to confuse
[48:55] this because this is your experience
[48:57] this is this is your walk with God this
[49:00] is where the reason you have a walk with
[49:01] God is because the Holy Ghost comes into
[49:03] your life and so if he can mess that up
[49:05] he wants to do it but I wanted to
[49:07] sympathize so in my series on the Holy
[49:09] Ghost that's my foundation and effort to
[49:12] simplify it so even the youngest child
[49:14] can understand it because the devil has
[49:17] complicated it may God help me to to
[49:20] bring it that this the youngest child
[49:22] could understand it
[49:24] the Simplicity that's in Jesus Christ so
[49:26] it's really this that there is a promise
[49:28] of God I want to simplify it there is a
[49:31] promise of God given for your life to
[49:35] give you his Spirit within you the power
[49:37] of God for this life and to transform
[49:41] transport you into the next life so I
[49:43] want to say it again there's a promise
[49:45] of God given for your life to give you
[49:49] his Spirit within you which is the power
[49:52] of God for this life to live in this
[49:54] life and then to transport you into the
[49:57] next life guess what it's not any more
[50:00] complicated than what I just said
[50:05] should I say it again
[50:07] there's a promise it's your promise
[50:11] it's a promise God has given for your
[50:13] life that he would put his Spirit within
[50:16] you and that will be the power of God
[50:18] for this life and the power to get us in
[50:19] the life to come it's not any more
[50:21] complicated than that
[50:24] can you say Amen
[50:26] so you know when you when you speak
[50:28] about the Holy Ghost then you you
[50:30] realize the world has messed up the term
[50:32] even ghost would be scary because the
[50:34] world has messed it up and we realize
[50:37] that that's not the way we look at when
[50:38] the scripture says the Holy Ghost people
[50:40] uh don't know the real meaning of it the
[50:43] church the churches today and the the
[50:46] new Bibles that are written they tend to
[50:48] lose the Ghost part and they call it the
[50:49] Holy Spirit which is the same thing but
[50:52] they like to lose the Ghost part because
[50:54] that's too scary for kids and that's
[50:56] just it doesn't fit in our culture I
[50:58] like to use the Bible terms
[51:01] it's just if you don't understand it and
[51:03] and so you could say if you were read
[51:05] Webster's Dictionary it says this the
[51:07] ghost is the spirit of a dead man well
[51:09] that's his his thing but you see if
[51:11] you're more specific about the meaning
[51:12] of ghosts it's the spirit of a living
[51:15] person without a flesh body so that's
[51:18] why it's termed the Holy Ghost it's the
[51:20] spirit of a person that's living can you
[51:23] say Amen that is doesn't have a bodily
[51:25] form but is able to come in another
[51:27] bodily form by pouring himself into the
[51:30] people so that's why it's called the
[51:32] Holy Ghost the Holy One of Israel the
[51:34] Holy One of God the the person of Jesus
[51:37] Christ so this Holy Ghost is a person
[51:40] it's it's a living person it's the holy
[51:44] person of Christ the word that came out
[51:46] from God in the beginning
[51:49] and wherever you see God like for
[51:52] example in the Old Testament whenever
[51:53] you see God and he moves on the
[51:55] situation and most of all he moves on
[51:57] prophets to speak the word because the
[52:00] the person of Christ
[52:01] is the word can you say man he came out
[52:04] in the beginning in the beginning was
[52:06] the word and the Word was with God it
[52:08] was the word the logos that came out of
[52:11] God and then we see them throughout him
[52:13] throughout history in the Old Testament
[52:15] moving upon the prophets there's a
[52:17] scripture that says holy men of old were
[52:20] moved by the Holy Ghost so back there it
[52:23] was the Holy Ghost and it always moved
[52:26] into the prophet for that age to speak
[52:28] the word for the age so remember
[52:30] something about the Holy Ghost it'll
[52:32] never works outside of the word for the
[52:35] age
[52:36] it is sent to make alive the word for
[52:39] the age and to make it live in the
[52:42] people that's what the Holy Ghost was
[52:43] sent for so that's why you see him in
[52:45] the Old Testament with all the prophets
[52:47] and there they are and God moves on them
[52:49] by the Holy Ghost to speak that word for
[52:51] their age this is what the term the holy
[52:54] ghost means whenever you see God in the
[52:56] Old Testament you see that person of
[52:58] Christ working there to bring his word
[53:01] to pass for that age but in the New
[53:04] Testament that person was not just to
[53:07] anoint prophets but to set Abode in the
[53:10] soul of man or of a woman and guess what
[53:13] he did it
[53:17] he fulfilled it
[53:19] the same holy ghost that moved upon
[53:21] prophets in the Old Testament now it
[53:24] moves to the New Covenant it would not
[53:25] be just anointing them to speak the word
[53:27] it would not be just a a a making uh
[53:31] David shout and dance the way he did it
[53:34] wouldn't just be something outward but
[53:36] he would move now into the very Soul the
[53:39] control tower of man that same Holy
[53:41] Ghost would move to a different thing
[53:43] and why could he come into your soul
[53:45] because Calvary had come because if you
[53:48] were born with the nature you were born
[53:49] with the Holy Ghost couldn't sit there
[53:52] it's too holy can you say Amen there was
[53:55] no way that the Holy Ghost could sit at
[53:57] your soul level you were born in sin can
[53:59] you say much you had the the nature of
[54:02] the serpent from the beginning you were
[54:04] born with that but if he could go to
[54:06] Calvary and and do away with sin and a
[54:09] person receives it then you make a place
[54:11] for the spirit of God himself the Holy
[54:13] Ghost to dwell in your life
[54:16] this is what the Holy Ghost is and so
[54:19] now in the New Testament he sets his
[54:20] Abode in the soul of man or woman and he
[54:23] did it and guess what he's still doing
[54:25] it
[54:27] that's why I say this morning
[54:29] to everyone including the young people
[54:30] it's something you should never be
[54:32] afraid of it's the greatest priority in
[54:35] life that you seek and you say God I
[54:38] want this promise for me I see it in my
[54:41] pastor I see it in my parents but I want
[54:44] it for me
[54:46] most important thing in your life more
[54:48] important than jobs and money and career
[54:50] and marrying a wife or husband it's more
[54:53] important than anything that you say
[54:54] Lord This Promise is for me
[54:58] praise the lord it's a promise that he
[55:00] will live in you and when a heart says I
[55:03] see it I'm asking for it I'm seeking it
[55:05] that promise is mine too I see that it's
[55:08] for me and then he gives it you know
[55:11] friends it's not any more complicated
[55:13] than what I just said a heart says I see
[55:16] it I want it it's my promise I'll
[55:19] receive it and he's more willing to give
[55:21] it to you than you're even willing can
[55:23] you say amen and he says I'll come to a
[55:25] heart like that I'll draw a heart like
[55:27] that I'll come to that heart that's open
[55:29] he doesn't want to complicate this
[55:31] experience of the Holy Ghost
[55:34] it's man that's complicated it
[55:39] but we learned that Satan is the author
[55:41] of confusion and especially confusing
[55:43] the Holy Ghost to take the simple things
[55:45] of God and do all that he can to keep
[55:48] people from it so and you got to realize
[55:51] also about Satan that he has a history
[55:54] of when he knows something's coming to
[55:57] try to stop it he steps out in front of
[56:00] it and particularly at times when a
[56:02] birth was coming very important birth
[56:04] Moses birth was very important and so
[56:06] now he moves upon pharaoh to kill all
[56:08] the children you got to look at Satan's
[56:11] nature and that is I'm gonna I want to
[56:13] be there at the point of birth
[56:16] I'd like to stop it I'd like to confuse
[56:19] it I'd like to disrupt it he would love
[56:22] to stop it at the point of birth that I
[56:24] can confuse that person or that I can
[56:26] kill and so at that birth of Moses and
[56:29] the birth of Jesus Christ this is what
[56:32] Satan did at the point of birth at the
[56:34] moment of birth he's trying to stop it
[56:36] [Music]
[56:38] I would say his nature is the same way
[56:40] today
[56:41] and that's why there's a confusion about
[56:43] the experience of the Lord and a true
[56:46] experience of connecting with him that
[56:48] God baptizes you with his spirit and
[56:50] your desires are changed from the things
[56:52] of the world and to the things of God
[56:54] and you love the word the greatest
[56:57] evidence in my life has been I love the
[56:59] word of God I have no resistance in my
[57:02] soul to any of the word of God
[57:05] and I got that because at 16 years old
[57:07] he replaced it with a serpent nature
[57:09] what's the serpent nature it wants to
[57:11] serve the world but it also wants to
[57:13] worship its own way Cain wanted to
[57:16] worship but he wanted to worship God his
[57:18] own way when you're born with that many
[57:21] of you want to worship but you want to
[57:23] do it your own way most of the church
[57:25] world are worshiping God their own way
[57:29] a lot of the music is cane worship it's
[57:31] worshiping the way they want to worship
[57:34] I'm going to sing about the cross but
[57:36] I'm going to live anyway I want to live
[57:38] I'm going to have my tattoos in my
[57:40] earrings I'm going to blast out the rock
[57:42] and roll can you say man because it's
[57:44] Cain worship but God when he brings a
[57:47] new birth old things pass away All
[57:50] Things become new and we're not
[57:52] manifesting the world anymore we're
[57:54] manifesting Christ
[57:56] in our music and everything that we do
[57:59] somebody say praise the Lord
[58:02] so now we're talking about the New Birth
[58:03] because we we see then that he he brings
[58:07] it to a place that he changes that
[58:09] nature on the inside because the nature
[58:12] you're born with is completely contrary
[58:14] to God you people that grew up in the
[58:16] message I hate to say it you're just
[58:17] like one that was born in the world you
[58:19] had the same birth as them the potential
[58:21] for you to sin and to do things wrong
[58:24] and to be in prison for killing somebody
[58:25] you have the potential in your soul that
[58:28] you're born with to do what they did
[58:29] you're no better because you were born
[58:31] in the message you need a new birth like
[58:34] they do
[58:35] I don't know brother Paul I'm a pretty
[58:36] good person I've been a good boy my
[58:38] parents feel pretty good about me you
[58:41] need the new birth
[58:43] Christ in the inside soul level to kill
[58:47] that old nature of the world and kill
[58:49] that serpent nature that wants to
[58:50] worship God its own way it wants to come
[58:53] live like the world do anything live a
[58:55] double life and lift its hand in church
[58:57] you see now something has to change your
[58:59] life my friend because you cannot
[59:01] worship your own way you say Lord take
[59:03] that cane way out of me that I was born
[59:06] give me a newborn experience a new birth
[59:09] experience and now as I said I love the
[59:12] word of God there's no risk resistance
[59:14] Within Me
[59:16] even the parts that I don't understand
[59:19] which is fewer and fewer by the way
[59:21] fewer and fewer parts to understand but
[59:23] there's still things that I don't
[59:24] understand and so but I I there's still
[59:26] not a resistance to it it's just those
[59:28] Lord I don't know I don't know why your
[59:30] Prophet said that
[59:32] I mean he ever has that okay nobody does
[59:35] I guess
[59:36] I don't know why your Prophet said that
[59:38] way but later on he shows me then it
[59:39] arrives wow this is a word Prophet he's
[59:41] bringing us back to the word there's a
[59:43] reason why he said that there's a reason
[59:44] why I told the women to dress that way
[59:46] there's a reason why I told the guys to
[59:48] dress this way there's a reason why he
[59:49] told us to do this and so you can have
[59:51] your flesh resisting but that Soul it's
[59:54] never since 16 years old it's never
[59:56] resisted it's respected it and more and
[59:58] more he confirms that I can say Amen but
[1:00:00] I can only say Amen from here because he
[1:00:03] changed me by a new birth
[1:00:06] and that's the greatest evidence is that
[1:00:07] you can say Amen to every word of God
[1:00:10] you can shout You Can Dance you can have
[1:00:12] all the manifestations you can have the
[1:00:14] gifts of the Spirit but the greatest
[1:00:15] evidence is that you are connected
[1:00:18] inside with the author of the word
[1:00:20] living in you that you can say Amen to
[1:00:22] every word of God
[1:00:25] there's no more cane nature to resist it
[1:00:27] and say I'm just going to do it my own
[1:00:29] way all that's burnt out
[1:00:32] how many could raise your hand and says
[1:00:33] I know that happened to me in my life
[1:00:36] praise be to God
[1:00:38] so
[1:00:40] Satan is confusing and he tries to stop
[1:00:42] it at the moment of birth then to try to
[1:00:45] copy so if he can't stop it at the new
[1:00:47] birth then he which then you try to uh
[1:00:50] he tries to copy or imitate the
[1:00:52] manifestations of the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:54] tries to copy the gifts he probably
[1:00:56] tries to point us to a sign or a gift or
[1:00:58] an emotion as the evidence and to get
[1:01:00] people to trust in the wrong thing
[1:01:02] avoiding the real New Birth avoiding uh
[1:01:05] the the real change people gravitate
[1:01:07] towards the manifestations of the Holy
[1:01:09] Ghost rather than the Holy Ghost himself
[1:01:11] as a person coming into your life that
[1:01:14] becomes confusion as well and I'm going
[1:01:16] to read a few quotes that show that how
[1:01:18] Satan can get amongst the people of God
[1:01:20] and create confusion in the people just
[1:01:23] by these things that I'm talking about
[1:01:25] the confusion that he points the people
[1:01:27] to depend on a sign or to bend on a gift
[1:01:30] or depend on an emotion as an evidence
[1:01:32] that you personally have it all those
[1:01:34] things are manifestations of the Holy
[1:01:36] Ghost and we see them but they're not to
[1:01:39] be used as an evidence that you have it
[1:01:43] and so this creates confusion
[1:01:46] I wanted to say that he did that through
[1:01:48] 200 2 000 years Satan worked to bring
[1:01:52] the things to two extremes extremes a
[1:01:54] few weeks ago I mentioned a quote he
[1:01:57] took water baptism to an extreme he took
[1:01:59] the Trinity to an extreme and he took
[1:02:01] predestination to extreme and it took
[1:02:03] the seventh angel he came and he came
[1:02:06] and tied the loose ends together and he
[1:02:08] brought the true teaching on all these
[1:02:10] Mysteries but but what it was is Satan
[1:02:13] through 2000 years
[1:02:16] he was taking it to extremes and when he
[1:02:20] did that he confused the subject and one
[1:02:22] of the things I brought up to you is the
[1:02:24] subject of the Holy Ghost the mystery of
[1:02:26] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:28] without sensation but the word living
[1:02:31] and you manifesting you see the reason
[1:02:33] he had to settle that mystery is because
[1:02:35] he was in an environment in Pentecost
[1:02:38] that had taken that to an extreme so
[1:02:40] much soul that if you feel this feeling
[1:02:42] if you speak in tongues that's the
[1:02:45] evidence that you got it
[1:02:47] and so when I bring true teaching and
[1:02:49] someone's been raised in that it brings
[1:02:51] confusion
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:54] it confuses the person and God is not
[1:02:57] the author of confusion
[1:03:00] so I just wanted to say though that when
[1:03:02] the seventh angel came and settled all
[1:03:03] these things
[1:03:05] when the seventh angel came and settled
[1:03:07] these Mysteries don't think for a moment
[1:03:09] that Satan clocked out
[1:03:15] it's all been settled now the seventh
[1:03:17] angel came he settled all the Mysteries
[1:03:19] even the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[1:03:22] think that Satan said okay I'm finished
[1:03:24] now no he didn't clock out he actually
[1:03:26] has worked harder to confuse the people
[1:03:28] he's actually tried to take this message
[1:03:31] of restoration and settling the
[1:03:33] Mysteries and tried his hardest the
[1:03:35] devil is still the devil and he's worked
[1:03:37] overtime to confuse the people on all
[1:03:40] these subjects now it's worse because
[1:03:43] Satan's using quotes
[1:03:47] he's not only using the Bible but he's
[1:03:49] using the quotes like he did with Jesus
[1:03:52] when he was there in the hour of
[1:03:53] Temptation he was using the Bible
[1:03:55] against Jesus he was quoting the Bible
[1:03:58] from the wrong motive and he was
[1:04:00] actually quoting scriptures but with the
[1:04:02] wrong motive to it just like the serpent
[1:04:05] was to Eve he was quoting God's word but
[1:04:07] he had the wrong motive and he twisted
[1:04:09] it just a little bit Jesus was tempted
[1:04:11] by Satan by his own word I tell you when
[1:04:15] the Bible and when the quotes are in the
[1:04:17] hands of the devil we are in trouble
[1:04:19] it's not meant to be interpreted by the
[1:04:22] devil
[1:04:24] and Satan can bring Confusion by the
[1:04:26] very quotes that we have that's why we
[1:04:28] say I want the Simplicity of Christ I
[1:04:31] want God to break it to me by Revelation
[1:04:33] if I don't understand it I'm going to
[1:04:35] wait there before the Lord until he
[1:04:37] brings the true revelation of that truth
[1:04:41] because I'm not going to let Satan
[1:04:43] tamper with it and interpret it his own
[1:04:44] way
[1:04:45] Satan is still on the job and he since
[1:04:49] the word has been opened the Seven Seals
[1:04:51] has been opened he's been working
[1:04:52] overtime to still confuse he's still the
[1:04:55] author of confusion to bring doubt to
[1:04:58] bring fear to corrupt Minds from the
[1:05:01] Simplicity of God's message I know he's
[1:05:04] out there I know he's still working
[1:05:07] you know he's still working
[1:05:09] it's a time for us to say Lord let me
[1:05:11] just humbly serve you
[1:05:13] whatever I need to know I trust you're
[1:05:15] going to give it to me
[1:05:18] I'm not going to live all week with a
[1:05:20] mind that's confused and a heart that's
[1:05:22] depressed and all messed up and every
[1:05:25] day questioning my experience as I said
[1:05:27] to you a couple Sundays ago if God's
[1:05:29] done something in your life hold that up
[1:05:31] before the devil and say I know God's
[1:05:33] moved in my life I may not be what be
[1:05:35] what I want to be but I ain't what I
[1:05:37] used to be
[1:05:38] can you say Amen
[1:05:41] hold that before the enemy because it's
[1:05:43] of God then you need to celebrate it and
[1:05:45] worship it and say God what's next for
[1:05:47] me because I know you moved in my life
[1:05:49] here but what's next I hope you're
[1:05:51] saying what's next
[1:05:52] because there's a lot to come there's an
[1:05:54] adoption of your life this Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] has taken us to adoption this Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] has taken us to a Rapture the same holy
[1:06:01] ghost that called you is the one that's
[1:06:02] going to put you in a rapture
[1:06:05] Hallelujah so he brings doubts and fears
[1:06:08] and corrupt minds but here's some quotes
[1:06:10] that I didn't get to last time and we're
[1:06:12] just going to finish up with this
[1:06:13] confusion just to show you that there
[1:06:15] can be confusion about the Holy Ghost he
[1:06:18] said that many times that first quote
[1:06:20] there in fellowship if you guys have it
[1:06:21] many times we make it so complicated
[1:06:23] with Creeds and different things to deal
[1:06:26] with different isms and things that
[1:06:28] we've made up inside of our fleshy mind
[1:06:30] now he's saying this all the way back
[1:06:32] friends in 1956 56 many times we make it
[1:06:36] so complicated with Creeds and different
[1:06:38] things to deal with different isms and
[1:06:40] things that we've made up inside of our
[1:06:42] fleshly mind and we many times through
[1:06:45] that drive Sinners far away from God
[1:06:50] oh my goodness I don't want that
[1:06:53] happening
[1:06:55] this church is here for the sinner
[1:06:58] we create an atmosphere for The Sinner
[1:07:01] you should invite The Sinner but what a
[1:07:04] tragedy when he comes and it scares the
[1:07:07] Sinners away just because we have
[1:07:08] different Creeds and isms and when they
[1:07:11] come a message among us we have
[1:07:12] confusion they don't understand what's
[1:07:14] going on Paul said even about the gifts
[1:07:16] when he put them in order he said if you
[1:07:18] come and do an unknown tongue publicly
[1:07:20] and it's not interpreted the public and
[1:07:22] The Sinner will say this is a mad group
[1:07:24] of people they're strange because he
[1:07:26] don't understand what's being said Paul
[1:07:28] put it in order said don't do that if
[1:07:30] it's just an Untold unknown tongue don't
[1:07:33] do that in public that's for your
[1:07:34] private prayer life but if there is a
[1:07:36] tongue let there be an interpretation
[1:07:38] come in the in the in the in the
[1:07:40] language they can understand it
[1:07:42] because God is a god of understanding
[1:07:45] not gibberish and unknown and Mysteries
[1:07:48] and The Sinner goes I don't have a clue
[1:07:50] what's going on here that's why a lot of
[1:07:52] times they're drawn by the music or
[1:07:54] they're drawn by the love of the people
[1:07:56] which is fine but they got to get
[1:07:58] anchored to the word of God
[1:08:00] and how sad to walk in even a message
[1:08:03] church sometimes and they go away and
[1:08:05] never come back because it's confusion
[1:08:08] to them look what brother Brown says he
[1:08:11] said the Sinners Drive the driver
[1:08:13] Sinners away from God but just make it
[1:08:15] simple that little children would
[1:08:17] understand
[1:08:20] and then I like this part and then it'll
[1:08:22] lift up Christ and he said I will draw
[1:08:26] all men unto me that's actually my
[1:08:28] subject this morning if we just lift up
[1:08:31] Christ he'll do the drawing
[1:08:35] that's his promise
[1:08:36] keep lifting up Christ keep lifting them
[1:08:40] up and he says when you do that in front
[1:08:42] of the people I'll draw them in unto me
[1:08:44] I'll draw The Sinner I'll draw The
[1:08:47] Prostitute I'll draw everybody who
[1:08:49] doesn't have a new birth yet I will draw
[1:08:51] their hearts myself you don't have to
[1:08:54] force it you don't have to push it you
[1:08:56] don't have to manipulate it
[1:08:59] why do I preach that because a lot of
[1:09:01] atmospheres it's a manipulation it's a
[1:09:03] force to get people to the altar and I'm
[1:09:07] gonna tell you brothers and preachers
[1:09:08] you don't have to do any of that when
[1:09:10] you're preaching the word just preach
[1:09:11] the word God will do the drawing
[1:09:16] oh I wonder why people aren't coming to
[1:09:18] the altar I wonder why they'd come and
[1:09:19] preachers us preacher we get complexes
[1:09:21] sometimes did I do something wrong did I
[1:09:23] didn't I was I in your mind because
[1:09:25] people they're just not responding and
[1:09:27] stuff we got to be careful about trying
[1:09:29] to take the next step to manipulate
[1:09:31] because God does the drawing
[1:09:33] if there's a heart there that's hungry
[1:09:35] for God already he created that hunger
[1:09:37] if we preach the word they latch onto
[1:09:40] that word you don't have to push people
[1:09:42] to come to the altar a heart that's
[1:09:43] broken they're going to walk up on their
[1:09:45] own you say people don't come because
[1:09:47] they're fearful and they'll be seen not
[1:09:49] when they're crying out for God they
[1:09:50] don't care about the other young people
[1:09:52] they don't care about who sees them
[1:09:54] because the only thing that comes their
[1:09:55] heart I need God right now and you'll
[1:09:58] find them at the altar because they
[1:10:00] don't care anymore about life and care
[1:10:02] about what people think they just need
[1:10:04] what's being preached
[1:10:07] when are we going to leave it alone and
[1:10:09] quit manipulating the drawing God says
[1:10:12] lift me up and I'll draw them unto me oh
[1:10:16] I wish I could have some heavier amens
[1:10:18] this morning listen now we've got to be
[1:10:21] careful how we manhandle what God's
[1:10:23] gonna do how we manipulate how we force
[1:10:26] we must take our hands off of the work
[1:10:28] of the Holy Spirit brother Daryl Ward
[1:10:31] told me in the offices we were talking
[1:10:32] about some of these things he said just
[1:10:34] a few a month or so ago he preached at
[1:10:36] his home church or brother Donnie's on a
[1:10:37] Wednesday night he said I was so
[1:10:39] defeated after that service he said it
[1:10:41] was the quietest service there was no
[1:10:43] shouting or dancing or anything people
[1:10:45] hardly said amen it was just so he said
[1:10:48] I've I finished up and I was just so
[1:10:50] doofy that's the worst sermon I've ever
[1:10:51] preached in my life and I hope you don't
[1:10:53] mind me sharing this but anyway he said
[1:10:55] I felt so defeated he said there was no
[1:10:57] response it just seemed like everything
[1:10:59] was intellectual and so you can start
[1:11:01] feeling intimidated by that
[1:11:04] but see friends we've got to trust the
[1:11:06] Lord in what he's doing
[1:11:09] because a lot of preachers would take
[1:11:10] the next step okay well I better Force
[1:11:12] an All-Star I better force them up you
[1:11:13] leave that alone
[1:11:15] because what he said was when he
[1:11:17] finished the service somebody in the
[1:11:19] back balcony said quick quick come and
[1:11:20] he called him and brother Donnie they
[1:11:22] went back there someone had died an
[1:11:24] older sister in the church had passed on
[1:11:26] I believe was his sister and she died
[1:11:27] right there just like the The Man passed
[1:11:29] away in brother branham's meetings and
[1:11:31] the people got kind of hysterical and he
[1:11:32] said settled down went down and prayed
[1:11:34] for him and he was out there was a nurse
[1:11:35] there they checked him he was out God
[1:11:37] brought him back to life same thing
[1:11:38] happened they went back there prayed for
[1:11:40] him prayed that prayed for the sister
[1:11:42] and just within she was out like three
[1:11:44] or four minutes five minutes I can't
[1:11:46] remember but anyway she came back to
[1:11:48] they had a couple nurses there they
[1:11:50] checked it they checked her later they
[1:11:52] said she was gone she was gone and God
[1:11:54] just it wasn't a shouting prayer it
[1:11:58] wasn't a big thing where it just they
[1:12:00] laid hands after God just bring her back
[1:12:02] to life we're in
[1:12:04] and God brought her back to life
[1:12:12] and see us preachers want me to be
[1:12:14] honest with you we think why isn't that
[1:12:16] happening in my church and Donnie
[1:12:18] Reagan's
[1:12:19] that's the complexes we get it is
[1:12:21] happening here people are being healed
[1:12:23] here
[1:12:24] and the same God that raises that there
[1:12:26] is the same God here this morning
[1:12:28] but you see we start thinking it has to
[1:12:30] be in a bunch of this and then sometimes
[1:12:32] it doesn't have to be in that emotion
[1:12:34] God is doing something and we need to
[1:12:37] trust what he's doing we need to trust
[1:12:39] that what I'm preaching now is getting
[1:12:40] through to somebody
[1:12:42] they may be on their Journey they may
[1:12:44] still be resisting I don't know but the
[1:12:46] work they're here and the Holy Spirit
[1:12:48] has led him here let her hear for some
[1:12:51] reason never underestimate what God is
[1:12:54] doing in the quiet
[1:13:00] never underestimate what God can do in
[1:13:02] your prayer Closet in your quiet time
[1:13:04] reading the word and his presence just
[1:13:06] come down and you feel that confirmation
[1:13:09] never underestimate when a man gets
[1:13:11] delivered of pornography completely
[1:13:13] delivered of it and it wasn't in church
[1:13:15] it wasn't all that nobody gets the
[1:13:17] testimony nobody sees it this is the day
[1:13:19] of small things where God gets Glory out
[1:13:21] of small things and the victories in the
[1:13:23] third poll will not be spread around the
[1:13:25] world because the third pool is not a
[1:13:27] public show they may not hear it around
[1:13:29] the world but yet yet when you praise
[1:13:31] God said God delivered me God got the
[1:13:34] glory
[1:13:40] praise be to God
[1:13:42] I think we should preach and make this
[1:13:45] simple that the little children would
[1:13:46] understand there's some message churches
[1:13:48] all the people don't understand never
[1:13:50] mind the children
[1:13:52] they leave or say I don't have a clue
[1:13:54] what he was saying what a shame
[1:13:57] what a shame that is the little children
[1:13:59] would understand and they'll lift up
[1:14:01] Christ and he said when you lift me up I
[1:14:05] if we would just preach Christ and lift
[1:14:08] him up before the people he said that's
[1:14:10] where the drawing begins
[1:14:13] he will do the drawing if we lift
[1:14:15] something else up if we're promoting our
[1:14:17] church or a preacher or a movement or
[1:14:20] any other thing he can't work in that
[1:14:22] but if we would just preach Christ in
[1:14:24] Simplicity He will draw them himself men
[1:14:28] can turn this into a real nervous work
[1:14:30] of trying to get the people to do
[1:14:32] something to force them into a Revival
[1:14:34] to manipulate to fear to use emotions
[1:14:37] but we don't have to do any of that we
[1:14:39] don't have to manufacture anything we
[1:14:42] need to lift Christ up before the people
[1:14:47] I'd like to tell every preacher
[1:14:49] including myself let God clean up our
[1:14:52] motives for preaching let them clean up
[1:14:54] our pride our complexes are lifting up
[1:14:57] our own Ministries and just preach this
[1:15:00] message pure with no agendas
[1:15:05] and in that in that God will do the work
[1:15:10] God will draw the people he will he
[1:15:13] promised to do it Don't Force
[1:15:15] expectations of the result
[1:15:17] don't try to force it because God's in
[1:15:19] your midst and he said if you lift me up
[1:15:23] then I'll draw the people unto me
[1:15:26] there's a poll
[1:15:28] do you ever think about how interesting
[1:15:29] it is that when we get to the end time
[1:15:32] then brother Bram takes Jesus ministry
[1:15:34] and splits it into the three poles we
[1:15:35] never heard that before
[1:15:37] and so each one of them was a Paul in
[1:15:40] other words they felt drawn to the
[1:15:42] Miracles
[1:15:43] so it's God something God uses God draws
[1:15:47] the people
[1:15:48] the second pull the discernments of
[1:15:50] heart second poll it's it's a pull in
[1:15:52] other words it pulls the people it draws
[1:15:54] that that that fish in it's the it's the
[1:15:57] bait it draws them in first and second
[1:15:59] pull
[1:16:00] and then the third one is called that
[1:16:01] it's called a poll I've always said it
[1:16:04] wasn't called the three pushes
[1:16:10] I'm glad
[1:16:11] but it was a draw it was a pull it's
[1:16:13] something God does to use to draw the
[1:16:16] people's hearts
[1:16:18] and you're drawn to that hopefully we're
[1:16:20] drawn to more than just a miracle more
[1:16:22] than just the first and second poll
[1:16:23] we're drawn to something deeper today
[1:16:26] and that's related to you so if you guys
[1:16:29] would turn that back on I'm going to get
[1:16:30] to the next quote but hey how many agree
[1:16:32] let's just preach Christ let's preach
[1:16:34] the Simplicity of the message let God do
[1:16:36] the work don't have to work up a Revival
[1:16:38] my goodness God God can bring it his own
[1:16:41] way so now to begin with you will notice
[1:16:44] that in my meetings brother Brown says
[1:16:46] when I have finished preaching an
[1:16:47] Evangelistic service or some teaching
[1:16:49] message I cast the net and I invite a
[1:16:51] response from the people I ask them to
[1:16:53] come forward and receive the Holy Spirit
[1:16:56] my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me
[1:16:58] say this believe that I'm inviting
[1:17:01] people to come forward to be baptized
[1:17:03] with the Holy Ghost because they are
[1:17:05] already born again so he's going to
[1:17:07] clear up a doctrinal thing here in a
[1:17:08] minute but I'm I'm only reading this
[1:17:10] quote to to show the confusion in a
[1:17:14] service
[1:17:15] where you have people that are not
[1:17:17] doctrinally correct and so now oh he's
[1:17:19] inviting people come and so they come to
[1:17:22] the Altar and receive and they're
[1:17:23] thinking to receive the baptism of Holy
[1:17:25] Ghost and so they're going to come up
[1:17:27] and many times they're going to instruct
[1:17:28] them how to receive it there I've I've
[1:17:30] been in Services when I little when I
[1:17:32] was a little boy where they move your
[1:17:33] mouth and try to get you to speak in
[1:17:35] tongues and once you do it a little bit
[1:17:37] they say you got it
[1:17:39] so now
[1:17:41] you talk about high level confusion
[1:17:45] in a service
[1:17:48] because they weren't taught right
[1:17:49] they're leaning that person the wrong
[1:17:52] way and deceiving them because if they
[1:17:53] didn't get it and they spoke in tongues
[1:17:55] they'll be deceived the rest of their
[1:17:57] lives they thought I spoke in terms they
[1:17:59] said I got it there's no Deliverance of
[1:18:01] the desires of their heart they still
[1:18:02] desire the things of the world
[1:18:04] so he says my Pentecostal friends in
[1:18:06] doing this and so then he says so when I
[1:18:09] invite those who those who are
[1:18:10] Spirit-filled to come and deal with
[1:18:12] those who have answered the invitation
[1:18:14] to receive the spirit these dear ones
[1:18:16] and he's so he's so respectful these
[1:18:18] dear ones surge forward and deal with
[1:18:21] the people in such manner as to
[1:18:23] encourage them to yield to God and
[1:18:26] believe to speak in tongues this has
[1:18:29] caused a great deal of confusion and I
[1:18:32] want to tell you exactly what I mean
[1:18:35] this in the services has caused a great
[1:18:39] deal of confusion now I've talked about
[1:18:40] the confusion of the world we lived in
[1:18:42] I've talked about Satan confusing a lot
[1:18:44] of things but now I'm talking about in a
[1:18:46] service when people aren't taught right
[1:18:48] there can be Satan working in confusion
[1:18:53] I'm just saying what he said this has
[1:18:55] caused a great deal of confusion I want
[1:18:57] to tell exactly what I mean I mean for
[1:18:59] The Sinner to come forward and be born
[1:19:01] again which is to be baptized in the
[1:19:04] body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which
[1:19:06] is exactly what took place at Pentecost
[1:19:08] when the church was launched in other
[1:19:10] words to be born of the spirit is to be
[1:19:13] truly truly baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:16] it is one and the same
[1:19:22] he's clearing up the doctrine of it they
[1:19:25] separated us two different things and I
[1:19:27] understand when a person believes
[1:19:29] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:19:30] you believe but when he invites them up
[1:19:33] he don't want to invite him up just
[1:19:35] because they receive a little
[1:19:36] intellectual he's inviting them to
[1:19:38] receive the new birth
[1:19:41] and that is the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:43] Ghost the new birth is not a separate
[1:19:45] thing than the baptism the holy ghost in
[1:19:47] the soul
[1:19:49] as we get into the subject deeper later
[1:19:51] on of course you have to talk about the
[1:19:54] many times he says that the baptism can
[1:19:56] be on your spirit the baptism to do all
[1:19:58] the gifts you can be baptized with the
[1:20:01] Holy Ghost in your spirit 24 hours a day
[1:20:03] and still die and go to hell
[1:20:07] wow
[1:20:08] it's because when his Spirit comes he
[1:20:12] can do a lot of things and manifest a
[1:20:14] lot of ways but his purpose is to change
[1:20:17] that soul
[1:20:19] to go deep and change the desires of
[1:20:21] that soul
[1:20:23] that's what it's there for
[1:20:25] everybody understand
[1:20:27] amen so he cleared that up but he also
[1:20:30] was addressing the confusion in meetings
[1:20:33] and then he goes on to say here later in
[1:20:35] 1965.
[1:20:37] today
[1:20:39] so confused about the evidence of the
[1:20:41] Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can
[1:20:43] imprison impersonate any of the gift
[1:20:45] that God has got but he cannot bring
[1:20:47] that word word by word notice he's
[1:20:50] associating the evidence of the Holy
[1:20:52] Ghost of the word coming word by word by
[1:20:54] word and you never deny that the holy
[1:20:56] Eagle so never denied it it'll never
[1:20:57] resist it it'll never turn it away so
[1:21:00] it's tied the evidence although he goes
[1:21:01] Holy Ghost is tied to the word not just
[1:21:04] your Bible but the word that's been
[1:21:06] spoken by the mouth of prophets
[1:21:08] that's where the evidence is and so he
[1:21:10] may impersonate a gift but he cannot
[1:21:13] bring that word word by word he might
[1:21:15] bring a few scriptures and then he stops
[1:21:17] off and says that's that's not right
[1:21:19] that's not right the days of Miracles
[1:21:20] have passed and so this is what the
[1:21:22] proper brings out they'll go with their
[1:21:23] Bibles but when it comes to God can do
[1:21:25] Miracles today they drop off you can't
[1:21:27] do that the Holy Ghost will say amen and
[1:21:30] go word by word and as it opens up he'll
[1:21:33] lead you guide you into all truth and
[1:21:35] with truth is presented to you if it's
[1:21:37] truth of the Bible the Holy Ghost will
[1:21:39] identify and say Amen now we're talking
[1:21:41] the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:46] that's where he says that's where he
[1:21:48] failed in the Garden of Eden that's
[1:21:50] where he's always failed that's where
[1:21:51] them the tape on false anointed ones are
[1:21:54] the anointed ones at the end times what
[1:21:55] he's referred to which is where he
[1:21:56] settled it they can be Anointed with the
[1:21:58] spirit speak in tongues dance shout and
[1:22:02] remember not by just some feeling
[1:22:04] anointed by the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:06] Spirit to shout dance speak in tongues
[1:22:08] preach the gospel do you believe a
[1:22:11] person can preach with the anointing of
[1:22:13] the the Holy Ghost and still be a false
[1:22:15] vessel
[1:22:18] I have some brothers that could preach
[1:22:20] even this message incredible gifted get
[1:22:24] anointed to preach it today they're
[1:22:26] nowhere to be found serving the world
[1:22:28] what happened they didn't have it in the
[1:22:31] soul level
[1:22:33] but boy could they be Anointed with it
[1:22:35] in their spirit and their gift it's
[1:22:37] powerful Paul said I can understand all
[1:22:40] Mysteries and still not have the real
[1:22:43] thing
[1:22:48] false anointed ones be Anointed with the
[1:22:50] spirit speaking tongues shout preach the
[1:22:52] gospel and still a devil it's the inside
[1:22:56] I want you guys to leave this up because
[1:22:57] this last statement says a lot it's the
[1:23:00] inside now remember Jesus said all the
[1:23:03] father hath given me will come to me and
[1:23:07] then he said no man can come except my
[1:23:10] father draws him both of those
[1:23:12] statements are taken out of John chapter
[1:23:13] 6. he says all those things there and if
[1:23:16] you know your Bible John chapter 6 is
[1:23:18] when he he multiplied the fishes and
[1:23:21] lows it was five thousand they were
[1:23:23] going to make him a king and then as he
[1:23:25] sat down with him he began to say things
[1:23:27] that like I and my father are one I am
[1:23:29] the bread that's come down from heaven
[1:23:30] he begins to give more of the word to
[1:23:32] them about who he was uh his seventy
[1:23:35] that were with him from the beginning
[1:23:36] and cast out Devils they said this is a
[1:23:38] hard saying who can hear it they begin
[1:23:41] to leave him he's left with 12 at the
[1:23:43] end of the chapter one's a devil and and
[1:23:45] we realize these is these are the places
[1:23:48] where Jesus says these things
[1:23:50] all the father has given me will come no
[1:23:54] man can come except my father draws him
[1:23:58] now I want to hone in on that and I try
[1:24:00] not to be too long here today I'm going
[1:24:02] to try my best
[1:24:03] first thing he says is that today
[1:24:09] there's such confusion on the evidence
[1:24:11] of Holy Ghost I believe he was called
[1:24:13] how many believe that brother Branham in
[1:24:15] the seventh angel Ministry was called to
[1:24:16] clear up the confusion and to simplify
[1:24:18] things
[1:24:20] and so as he's clearing some of the
[1:24:22] confusion he gets to this end quote
[1:24:24] because he begins the quote by saying
[1:24:26] there's so much confusion today about
[1:24:28] the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:30] and I believe these last three
[1:24:32] statements have a lot of depth to them
[1:24:35] because I believe it's part of clearing
[1:24:37] up the confusion and the first thing
[1:24:39] that he says
[1:24:41] it's the inside
[1:24:45] because he's talking about what the
[1:24:47] baptism can do on the outside and that
[1:24:49] it can be imitated some of it's real
[1:24:51] some of its vessels that aren't right he
[1:24:54] talks about all the and you listen to
[1:24:56] anointed words at the end time he breaks
[1:24:58] that down right from the scripture it's
[1:25:00] a truth revealed in this last hour that
[1:25:02] we didn't know quite that way that the
[1:25:04] rain falls on the justice and the whole
[1:25:06] congregation can be affected in some way
[1:25:08] when I go into this series I want to
[1:25:09] show you when he the Holy Ghost descends
[1:25:12] upon a generation there's a lot of
[1:25:14] things that God will do
[1:25:17] but there's there's few in there that's
[1:25:19] actually getting what the Holy Ghost was
[1:25:22] sent for
[1:25:23] it's on the inside
[1:25:25] because all that he's referring to and
[1:25:27] the confusion is people gravitating to
[1:25:29] what the Holy Ghost is doing on the
[1:25:31] outside but remember I said a couple
[1:25:32] Sundays ago I was saying that it's from
[1:25:35] the inside out God's word God works
[1:25:39] so the real there's a there's a
[1:25:40] reference to the Holy Spirit when Jesus
[1:25:43] said
[1:25:45] in the last day of the feast I don't
[1:25:47] have it in front of me but in the last
[1:25:48] day of the feast he says he said the the
[1:25:51] spirit will come and he says out of your
[1:25:54] belly shall flow rivers of Living Water
[1:25:57] so that that uh word picture is
[1:26:00] something coming from the inside of you
[1:26:02] going out
[1:26:04] and then the next scripture says this is
[1:26:06] referring to the spirit when it comes so
[1:26:10] when the spirit comes it's actually
[1:26:12] going to be a work for I know it says
[1:26:14] they were in the upper room and they are
[1:26:15] filled with the Holy Ghost because they
[1:26:16] emptied out but really what's intended
[1:26:18] to do is it's going to work from the
[1:26:20] inside out not the outside in and so
[1:26:23] that which is down there will like be
[1:26:25] like a rivers of living water flowing
[1:26:27] from your in innermost being
[1:26:30] so now we have a distinction it's on the
[1:26:33] inside so we have to be grown up we have
[1:26:35] to be mature in the Lord to realize the
[1:26:38] evidence of the Holy Ghost really in a
[1:26:40] person's life is not something they're
[1:26:42] gravity gravitating or something out the
[1:26:44] outside but it's something that's coming
[1:26:46] from the inside out not the outside in
[1:26:49] and that's why he says it's the inside
[1:26:52] it's the inside we will go through that
[1:26:54] at length at another time
[1:26:57] because when the Holy Ghost begins to
[1:26:58] move many people in fact I'm going to
[1:27:01] read to you when we get to it I'm going
[1:27:03] to read to you the first time the Holy
[1:27:05] Ghost begins to be mentioned in the Book
[1:27:07] of Matthew and that's the it's at the
[1:27:09] conception of Jesus Christ he starts
[1:27:11] using the term and so
[1:27:14] Simeon and Hannah and uh Joseph receives
[1:27:19] a dream and he tells them what's
[1:27:22] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so
[1:27:24] that's the first time we hear the term
[1:27:25] mentioned and it's around it's around
[1:27:27] the birth of Christ
[1:27:30] it says something
[1:27:32] so it's it's not coming just to anoint a
[1:27:34] prophet now it's not coming to give a
[1:27:36] feeling now it's coming specifically to
[1:27:38] bring that conception to bring forth the
[1:27:41] word and so now but you'll have people
[1:27:44] affected people having dreams people
[1:27:46] being shown by the Holy Ghost it says he
[1:27:48] will show me the Holy Ghost this is the
[1:27:49] Messiah the Holy Ghost showed him that
[1:27:51] so but you see now everybody was
[1:27:53] receiving some of the benefits of the
[1:27:56] Holy Ghost coming in that era in that
[1:27:58] time but only one person is conceding
[1:28:01] the Holy Ghost inside them
[1:28:04] so the Holy Ghost can do a lot of effect
[1:28:07] people can feel better after a service
[1:28:09] even like this people can feel better
[1:28:12] just by being in the atmosphere of the
[1:28:14] Holy Ghost
[1:28:17] people can have dreams people can it can
[1:28:20] have a lot of things can be done but in
[1:28:22] that day it was only Mary that had the
[1:28:26] depth of the Holy Ghost conceiving a new
[1:28:29] life Christ within her
[1:28:33] so now we draw a distinction because
[1:28:35] that's going to come from the inside out
[1:28:37] that's not going to be she's trying to
[1:28:39] produce something that's going to be
[1:28:40] that a life started within her
[1:28:43] a new life is growing within her
[1:28:48] everybody's still awake
[1:28:51] and she couldn't stop it
[1:28:55] and it was without sensation he wasn't
[1:28:58] with a man it wasn't carnal it wasn't a
[1:29:00] sexual experience
[1:29:02] it was the Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:29:04] she didn't feel anything she just said
[1:29:07] Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word
[1:29:10] bang something she didn't feel any of it
[1:29:12] but a conception started a new life was
[1:29:15] in her now after a few months as some of
[1:29:18] her sisters being pregnant then you
[1:29:20] start to see
[1:29:22] wow there's another life growing within
[1:29:24] her
[1:29:25] that's why I say about the Holy Ghost
[1:29:28] sometimes you wait to see the fruit from
[1:29:30] it
[1:29:31] you wait to see the life that comes see
[1:29:33] if the desires are changed
[1:29:35] because you can tell you couldn't tell
[1:29:36] anything was changed with with Mary
[1:29:39] until it started to grow she realized
[1:29:41] the baby starts kicking
[1:29:43] all these things begin to happen
[1:29:45] and you realize there's been a change
[1:29:46] because there's a new life that's
[1:29:47] growing inside me
[1:29:49] praise the Lord now we're talking what
[1:29:51] the Holy Ghost really wants to do from
[1:29:53] the inside out a new life Christ being
[1:29:57] formed in you
[1:29:59] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:30:01] Beyond an emotion Beyond
[1:30:03] enjoying the benefits you can be around
[1:30:05] a congregation and enjoy the benefits
[1:30:07] for your children and families just by
[1:30:09] being around the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:30:10] Ghost but do you have it for yourself
[1:30:15] is New Life conceived in you and is it
[1:30:18] growing
[1:30:19] when you have a new life inside of you
[1:30:22] how can you tell something's happened
[1:30:23] with a mom sometimes it's something's
[1:30:25] different she gets cravings for things
[1:30:26] and Foods she never had cravings for
[1:30:29] before you will get a craving for the
[1:30:31] word of God like never before
[1:30:33] I never had this before I crave I want
[1:30:35] to be there at church I want to hear I
[1:30:37] want to get in my Bible
[1:30:38] it's an Evidence something says change I
[1:30:40] want it for myself I want to be fed by
[1:30:42] this word
[1:30:43] and the and the Cravings come
[1:30:46] and you have to go sometimes at three in
[1:30:48] the morning and get that wife what she
[1:30:50] needs
[1:30:51] my fir the first baby with Beck and I
[1:30:53] was Seafood
[1:30:54] all the time seafood seafood we don't do
[1:30:57] that anymore but with that baby she
[1:30:58] craved Seafood so we were at Red Lobster
[1:31:00] all the time feel like I should own
[1:31:02] stock and Red Lobster
[1:31:04] I should have
[1:31:07] every baby had a different
[1:31:09] craving some of them I like some of them
[1:31:12] I didn't like
[1:31:15] I think it was it was Solomon or Gideon
[1:31:18] there and the craving was hot fudge cake
[1:31:20] at Big Boy I love that one
[1:31:24] that was awesome even if it was three in
[1:31:27] the morning it tasted great we went
[1:31:29] we're going
[1:31:31] because she couldn't finish all of it
[1:31:40] so
[1:31:42] we'll get back to that a little bit on
[1:31:44] the inside but I want to start wrapping
[1:31:46] it up just on this point he said all the
[1:31:49] father have given will come
[1:31:51] predestination clears confusion of the
[1:31:54] Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] it should
[1:31:57] and that is his sons and daughters
[1:32:00] will come
[1:32:02] now see we we have to take a rest in
[1:32:04] that not a rest that we could become
[1:32:06] lazy to seek the Holy Ghost but arrest
[1:32:08] that all the father has already given
[1:32:11] will come
[1:32:15] so he's clearing up the confusion of
[1:32:17] this evidence of the Holy Ghost we've
[1:32:19] got to Anchor to something and it's
[1:32:20] right in the scripture hey all the
[1:32:22] father have given will come
[1:32:25] don't set time frames on it they will
[1:32:27] all come because they are his sons and
[1:32:29] daughters Sons and Daughters of God will
[1:32:32] come
[1:32:33] and we rest in that it's not our work
[1:32:35] it's his work so then he says no man can
[1:32:38] come except my father draws him first
[1:32:40] and that says to me that it's all him
[1:32:43] doing it I I know I want to cover some
[1:32:46] scriptural instruction on our hearts and
[1:32:49] and what the Holy Ghost is and what it
[1:32:51] should be and and we realize that in
[1:32:54] scripture I will show you places that we
[1:32:56] offer back to God some instruction of if
[1:32:58] you're seeking the Lord deeper in your
[1:33:01] life in the Holy Ghost there's
[1:33:02] instruction the scripture gives and all
[1:33:04] these words come from the Bible real
[1:33:06] conviction uh desperation how many knows
[1:33:08] desperation is tied uh when he preached
[1:33:11] the token the Holy Ghost then that night
[1:33:12] he preached desperation Jacob had to get
[1:33:14] desperate forth so we know we have these
[1:33:16] things
[1:33:17] repentance true repentance uh comes
[1:33:21] before receiving the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:33:23] in Jesus name obedience they he gave the
[1:33:26] Holy Ghost to them that obey him
[1:33:28] persistence and persistent asking
[1:33:31] seeking knocking Jesus said whoever
[1:33:34] asked and persist in acting and knocking
[1:33:36] and and going before the Lord it's all
[1:33:39] in the Bible there you empty yourself
[1:33:41] out like they did Pentecost that's all
[1:33:43] things that we offer to God and we do
[1:33:45] and and you've got to offer a heart to
[1:33:47] him and you have to be serious about
[1:33:48] wanting the Holy Spirit I understand but
[1:33:51] the first truth that we need to knew no
[1:33:53] is that he will do the drawing he will
[1:33:57] do the drawing
[1:34:00] he will do the calling
[1:34:03] you can't do that he will lead you into
[1:34:06] this
[1:34:07] truth is
[1:34:09] we would never even seek it
[1:34:12] unless he was doing the drawing first
[1:34:16] so we preach seek the Holy Ghost get
[1:34:18] desperate of God and that's what we
[1:34:19] should do because it takes desperation
[1:34:20] but you never desire that in a real way
[1:34:22] until until he was already drawing you
[1:34:25] to the Holy Ghost so what I say this is
[1:34:27] all him
[1:34:28] all the father have given me will come
[1:34:31] and and he and we must know the truth
[1:34:34] that no man comes except my father draws
[1:34:37] him the way brother Brian says draws him
[1:34:39] first it starts with God drawing you
[1:34:46] I love this because this is what our
[1:34:48] text was and I'll probably try to end I
[1:34:50] wanted to get to Ezekiel 36 so much but
[1:34:54] I ain't going to get there today
[1:34:56] remember the scripture said at the text
[1:34:58] this morning remember it said
[1:35:01] it talks about we are his workmanship
[1:35:03] created in Jesus Christ
[1:35:06] this is a creation of God this is not
[1:35:09] some feeling you get to make you a
[1:35:12] better person this is a creation of the
[1:35:15] Lord and all the father hath given me
[1:35:17] will come
[1:35:19] because he's drawing you
[1:35:23] before there can be a creation there has
[1:35:25] to be a Creator to create the creation
[1:35:27] and if you're thirsting tonight for the
[1:35:29] healing power of God there's got to be a
[1:35:31] fountain open somewhere or you'd never
[1:35:32] thirst for it how many alongs for a
[1:35:34] deeper walk with God
[1:35:36] every hand up well there's a deeper walk
[1:35:39] somewhere and you never thirst for it
[1:35:41] something has created in you a desire to
[1:35:45] walk closer to God so he's working even
[1:35:49] before he creates and puts something
[1:35:52] within you that's why I want to get to
[1:35:54] Ezekiel 36 because it's the whole
[1:35:56] process of him coming I'll draw you out
[1:35:58] of the land of the Heathen out he says
[1:36:01] I'll sprinkle with you with clean water
[1:36:03] he hasn't put his spirit in you out he
[1:36:06] says I'll change your Stony heart
[1:36:08] I'll soften your heart because you
[1:36:11] brother Brown says it this way when
[1:36:13] you're born you don't have even have a
[1:36:15] heart to get along with God's word
[1:36:18] so he gives you a soft heart to start
[1:36:20] getting along before you even receive a
[1:36:23] spirit
[1:36:24] he said you can't even hardly get along
[1:36:26] with one another
[1:36:28] because of your heart how are you going
[1:36:30] to get along with God
[1:36:32] I'll sprinkle with clear water I'll do
[1:36:34] this I want to get to that scripture so
[1:36:36] bad I'll do this it's all before a
[1:36:38] spirit comes he said I'll put a new
[1:36:40] spirit within you that's not his holy
[1:36:42] spirit yet
[1:36:43] he'll give you a new spirit so it can
[1:36:45] receive the word
[1:36:46] he said then I will put my spirit within
[1:36:48] you
[1:36:51] God's God
[1:36:55] 's doing it all
[1:36:57] I'm gonna get something it's because he
[1:36:58] was drawing you first and he was
[1:37:00] creating he's speaking to a sister
[1:37:01] that's in the back seat there and and
[1:37:03] coming she didn't have to come to the
[1:37:04] healing line there was something
[1:37:06] happening back there and she desired it
[1:37:08] and he pointed back to her and said
[1:37:09] sister before you even had a desire for
[1:37:12] that God created a desire for you to be
[1:37:16] healed before she received her healing
[1:37:19] something has to be created in you a
[1:37:22] desire to walk closer to God this is the
[1:37:25] creation of God the Holy Ghost the holy
[1:37:27] ghost in your life what he's going to do
[1:37:29] in your life look at it as a creation of
[1:37:31] him he's the one that does the work
[1:37:35] something has created you a desire to be
[1:37:37] healed by God well before that could be
[1:37:39] created in your body in your spirit
[1:37:40] there has to be a creator of that and
[1:37:42] that Creator is the holy spirit that's
[1:37:45] why you're here tonight is because the
[1:37:47] Holy Spirit has led you some of them not
[1:37:50] saved yet some of them not healed yet
[1:37:52] not received their healing yet but he's
[1:37:55] willing to say the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:37:58] Ghost you don't have the Holy Ghost in
[1:38:00] your soul yet tonight at the meeting the
[1:38:02] Holy Ghost is the one who even LED you
[1:38:05] here
[1:38:08] and then he starts to work on you and
[1:38:10] create create a heart that's ready to
[1:38:12] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:38:14] what is he doing he's clearing the
[1:38:16] confusion of us manhandling this to try
[1:38:19] to put our own evidence and when this
[1:38:21] happened and this day this I have dates
[1:38:24] when I know God dealt with me and I know
[1:38:25] my life has changed but we must be
[1:38:27] careful because God is drawing us to all
[1:38:31] of this God prepares the heart to
[1:38:34] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:38:38] this isn't a mechanical thing of our own
[1:38:40] works
[1:38:42] but we are his workmanship
[1:38:45] I'm glad this morning that I'm his
[1:38:48] workmanship
[1:38:50] and if I'm under the Potter's hand why
[1:38:53] are we so worried about what we don't
[1:38:54] have
[1:38:57] why are we so afraid of what we're
[1:38:59] lacking if I'm under his workmanship he
[1:39:02] will create in me what is needed I'm
[1:39:05] under the Creator
[1:39:12] I love that the holy spirit is the one
[1:39:14] who has led you here
[1:39:19] next Sunday we'll get into Ezekiel 30
[1:39:21] see he does the drawing
[1:39:23] don't manhandle It Don't Force It
[1:39:26] preachers don't manhandle don't
[1:39:29] manipulate don't scare the people into
[1:39:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:33] just preach and let God do the drawing
[1:39:36] here's another place sometimes they can
[1:39:38] get confused so many people lots of time
[1:39:40] has misconstrued the word and been
[1:39:41] misunderstood by saying by making
[1:39:43] articles I said I wasn't much on an
[1:39:45] ultra call Brother Bram has said that
[1:39:46] I'm not much on an all car not meaning
[1:39:48] that you shouldn't make an altar call
[1:39:51] oh boy
[1:39:56] whatever I was reading could you please
[1:39:58] give it back to me
[1:40:05] back okay thank you
[1:40:07] oh thank the Lord I have staff to help
[1:40:10] me
[1:40:14] I said I'm I'm not meaning that you
[1:40:16] shouldn't make an altar call but he's
[1:40:18] going to take a stab at and could
[1:40:20] critique
[1:40:21] the wrong kind of altar call
[1:40:23] somebody get somebody by the arm and say
[1:40:25] oh brother John you know what me and you
[1:40:28] has been good neighbors all this time
[1:40:29] come up here at the altar get down
[1:40:38] all the father had given me will come
[1:40:40] and no man can come unless I'm already
[1:40:42] drawing him
[1:40:44] you're getting involved there trying to
[1:40:46] make them come out of emotion
[1:40:48] he said what's he doing
[1:40:51] which had a Blackboard here I would show
[1:40:52] you what he's doing he's trying to work
[1:40:53] through his soul on affections and so in
[1:40:56] spirit is interchanged with affection of
[1:40:58] course so he means the spirit there Soul
[1:41:00] through infections in in 1962 he refers
[1:41:03] to the spirit as the soul later on it's
[1:41:05] the body spirit and soul so the inside
[1:41:07] of the inside but here it's your
[1:41:09] affections he's trying to work on his
[1:41:11] affections that don't work that's not
[1:41:13] the Avenue certainly it isn't maybe he's
[1:41:15] working in what the memory through the
[1:41:17] sense of his soul Oh Brother John you
[1:41:19] had a wonderful mother she died a long
[1:41:21] time ago a memory see you can't do that
[1:41:24] it's got to come down the line of free
[1:41:28] moral agency
[1:41:30] you yourself let the word of God you
[1:41:34] don't come because your mother was a
[1:41:35] good woman you don't come because your
[1:41:38] daddy died or your mom died you don't
[1:41:40] come because you're a good neighbor you
[1:41:43] come because God calls you to come
[1:41:48] you don't have to manipulate that you
[1:41:51] don't have to make that happen
[1:41:54] lift up Christ and he said I'll draw all
[1:41:58] men into me it's in everyone's own time
[1:42:01] can you say amen and what the worst case
[1:42:03] is God's Not drawing that person yet the
[1:42:06] worst case is to force that person to
[1:42:08] try to mechanically do something we
[1:42:10] encourage them we tell them what they
[1:42:12] need in their lives if their life is
[1:42:13] just full of all kinds of messing around
[1:42:15] with sin and porn and and you you tell
[1:42:19] them as a pastor you need something you
[1:42:21] need the holy ghost in your life but
[1:42:22] never to force them because if that
[1:42:24] heart's not drawn by God they're not
[1:42:26] ready
[1:42:28] but I do believe if they'll begin to say
[1:42:30] Lord and ask say Lord I know I need this
[1:42:33] if they'll begin to say that God's all
[1:42:35] over it
[1:42:38] you come because that God calls you to
[1:42:40] come and you accept him on the basis of
[1:42:42] his word that word is what means
[1:42:45] everything that word can you stand
[1:42:48] together this morning
[1:42:50] thank you for your attention
[1:42:55] all the father had given me will come
[1:42:57] this is a work of the inside
[1:43:00] all the father give me and no man can
[1:43:03] come unless there's already something a
[1:43:05] creation of God already working to bring
[1:43:08] them
[1:43:10] if we know the Lord is in our lives
[1:43:12] drawing our hearts if this morning I
[1:43:15] just want to simplify this and say if
[1:43:17] you've got a calling if you've got
[1:43:18] something down there that's still
[1:43:20] drawing you and saying I need more of
[1:43:22] God you should raise your hand and say
[1:43:24] thank God that I have that
[1:43:28] I never gave that to you you didn't give
[1:43:30] it to yourself
[1:43:32] there's a lot of you that's been through
[1:43:34] things that if you're carnally looking
[1:43:36] at it
[1:43:37] hurt by the world hurt by people hurt by
[1:43:40] message preachers
[1:43:43] just there's a lot of things you've had
[1:43:45] that really you shouldn't be here
[1:43:49] a lot of you you shouldn't be here
[1:43:51] things have happened here you've half
[1:43:53] lost loved ones and all that and yet and
[1:43:55] you've had struggles and you've
[1:43:56] questioned God and you've questioned why
[1:43:58] did this happen I I Pastor you I know
[1:44:00] some of those things and it's sometimes
[1:44:02] they can be so real the devil can really
[1:44:03] get you off track is this worth it all
[1:44:06] these other thoughts come all that but
[1:44:08] listen let's try to let's try to look at
[1:44:10] what God is doing in our lives that
[1:44:12] there's some reason that something deep
[1:44:15] down is resonating and saying I know
[1:44:18] that I can't ever leave Christ
[1:44:21] how many raise your hand say there's
[1:44:23] something that keeps drawing me I've had
[1:44:25] mental conditions all these other things
[1:44:27] but something in me keeps drawing me to
[1:44:29] him that's not you that's not an effort
[1:44:32] oh I get it better get my wife
[1:44:33] straightened out I better come and do
[1:44:35] something or brother Paul is going to
[1:44:36] preach on me no it has nothing to do
[1:44:38] with that he's still drawing you
[1:44:41] and if he's still drawing you whatever
[1:44:42] you lack he's going to fill you with
[1:44:44] he's going to give it to you
[1:44:46] will I be in a Rapture you keep you keep
[1:44:49] yielding your life to God under this
[1:44:51] Holy Spirit yes all that God has given
[1:44:53] are going to be in the rapture
[1:44:56] now I'm not trying to put you in myself
[1:44:57] I don't do that but he knows how to put
[1:45:00] you in a rapture
[1:45:01] he knows how to draw your heart
[1:45:03] whatever stays that you're at if you're
[1:45:06] an eight-year-old boy or girl if you're
[1:45:08] a 16 year old guy guy or girl and I
[1:45:10] appreciate these young men and young
[1:45:12] women standing up here today
[1:45:15] on the front row
[1:45:17] with the risk of me spitting in their
[1:45:19] face
[1:45:20] that's Brave Girls that's Brave guys
[1:45:24] but I looked on the monitor in my office
[1:45:26] I just text Brother Branham praise be to
[1:45:29] God
[1:45:30] for the example
[1:45:33] and how these girls look and what
[1:45:34] they're manifesting in this age
[1:45:37] the women and how they look is a
[1:45:39] reflection of the church
[1:45:45] it's a reflection of the character of
[1:45:47] the church and what we preach here
[1:45:48] it really is we don't have a lot here
[1:45:50] but listen it's a small number today and
[1:45:52] it it it and they have sometimes their
[1:45:56] struggles and the devil beating them up
[1:45:58] and trying to get their hold on things
[1:46:01] and battles that we don't know about
[1:46:03] sometimes
[1:46:04] and yet God's creating the Creator is
[1:46:08] creating something within them
[1:46:11] and if you're in the hands of the
[1:46:13] Creator his workmanship
[1:46:15] I bet none of us in this church this
[1:46:17] morning could deny and say I I'm not
[1:46:20] under the hand of God I'm under the word
[1:46:22] his word I bet everybody could raise
[1:46:24] your hand and say I believe that I'm
[1:46:26] under his workmanship
[1:46:28] and if he's in charge if he's under if
[1:46:31] he's in charge of mode in your life then
[1:46:34] everything you lack you just offer a
[1:46:37] heart before God
[1:46:38] you just say Lord whatever Brother
[1:46:40] Paul's preaching I'm the holy ghost or
[1:46:42] any other subject Lord if I need that
[1:46:44] God please bring it to me make contact
[1:46:47] with me
[1:46:48] you say that prayer to God I believe
[1:46:51] he's if we draw an idea here he'll draw
[1:46:53] closer to us that's what the Bible says
[1:46:55] but we've got to rest
[1:46:57] we can't make the Holy Ghost something
[1:46:59] that's to be afraid of
[1:47:02] we have to rest in the things he said is
[1:47:05] that all the father given will come and
[1:47:07] nobody will make that move to come
[1:47:10] unless they're feeling drawn by me I'll
[1:47:12] create the drawing I'll create the pole
[1:47:17] and that they'll they'll keep walking
[1:47:19] towards me maybe slow I got to thinking
[1:47:21] yesterday
[1:47:23] growing up today
[1:47:26] kids don't grow up kids are people can
[1:47:30] be 40 50 60 years old there's 50 year
[1:47:33] old men that sit in in a gamer with
[1:47:35] their video games some living with their
[1:47:37] mom and dad
[1:47:39] I got to thinking about that is that
[1:47:41] type spiritually that we have we have
[1:47:43] growth today even the church but it's
[1:47:45] slow growth
[1:47:47] and it's because of the atmosphere and
[1:47:49] the people are that way not growing up
[1:47:51] you know we don't praise old people
[1:47:52] anymore and wisdom and and things like
[1:47:55] we don't do that we're supposed to do
[1:47:57] that we're supposed to look to counsel
[1:47:58] from older ones that's been there and
[1:48:00] done that but the Young Generation
[1:48:01] everybody wants to stay young
[1:48:02] everybody's nobody wants to grow up she
[1:48:05] had you know 35 40 year old women that
[1:48:07] still want to dress like a teenager act
[1:48:09] like a teenager so if we have that
[1:48:12] naturally I wonder if we have a slow
[1:48:14] growth spiritually because of the
[1:48:17] atmosphere we live in where someone
[1:48:19] would come and oh my the atmosphere you
[1:48:21] know there's there's days and I don't
[1:48:23] try to I don't try to be like this but
[1:48:25] there's days like back in uh who's the
[1:48:28] guy who's in Chicago William Booth or
[1:48:30] the other fellow Spurgeon
[1:48:32] Moody I think it was and they they told
[1:48:35] them to get up and test the Acoustics of
[1:48:37] the Tabernacle and there's a janitor
[1:48:39] that's hiding back in a seat up in the
[1:48:41] balcony and he just gets up and goes red
[1:48:44] pants that's all he said repent and that
[1:48:46] guy fell under a conviction come down to
[1:48:48] the altar when he was testing the
[1:48:50] Acoustics there was so much power of God
[1:48:52] in one repent that man gave his heart to
[1:48:54] the Lord that janitor
[1:48:59] so praise the Lord yeah but you see now
[1:49:01] you see today we're under a different
[1:49:03] atmosphere not that the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:49:05] the same but listen you have to have a
[1:49:07] care for what God's doing in a person's
[1:49:10] life now I'm going to take a section of
[1:49:12] this study and talk about the scripture
[1:49:14] that says Stephen just just said you're
[1:49:17] resisting the Holy Ghost as your fathers
[1:49:18] did they were resisting that's not a
[1:49:21] good position to be in
[1:49:22] but I'm going to say most of you aren't
[1:49:24] that in position this morning you're not
[1:49:25] in that position I would I would hope to
[1:49:27] say so now we have to be careful because
[1:49:29] it's a slow growth today where people
[1:49:32] but if they're under the workmanship of
[1:49:34] God
[1:49:35] it doesn't matter the time
[1:49:37] if they're under the workmanship and
[1:49:38] they're yielding to him God's going to
[1:49:41] give them everything that they need
[1:49:45] if they stay in the right atmosphere if
[1:49:47] they stay in the right Fellowship that
[1:49:48] they stay in the word of God and God can
[1:49:50] keep drawing them God's going to give
[1:49:52] you everything that you need
[1:49:54] how many believe that this morning
[1:49:56] want to make this simple because the
[1:49:58] devil has confused it I want to make it
[1:50:00] that you hold on to that peace this
[1:50:02] morning that if there's something's
[1:50:04] going to happen in me
[1:50:05] it's kind of like uh when they call
[1:50:08] Jesus good and he said there's none good
[1:50:10] but God anything good that's coming out
[1:50:13] of me he's created it within me
[1:50:16] any walk with the Lord that I have it's
[1:50:18] because he's created in me any desire
[1:50:21] that I have he's created it in me and
[1:50:23] I'm under the Creator now and I'll be
[1:50:25] under the Creator tomorrow
[1:50:27] and whatever he needs to keep creating
[1:50:29] in me I'm going to let him create
[1:50:31] anything he wants in me
[1:50:34] pray Heavenly Father
[1:50:37] as this song says oh Lord send your
[1:50:39] power
[1:50:41] send your spirit Among Us Lord we pray
[1:50:44] God I pray that
[1:50:46] if a heart is searching for you or for
[1:50:48] they've served you for many years I pray
[1:50:51] Lord that we would just be strengthened
[1:50:54] today to rest in what your work is doing
[1:50:57] Lord we're not someone else's
[1:50:59] workmanship
[1:51:00] we're not our own workmanship
[1:51:03] we are your workmanship
[1:51:06] you're doing this Lord
[1:51:08] now the father if I ran away today and I
[1:51:10] got out of your presence and I just went
[1:51:12] and did my own thing
[1:51:13] it's difficult for you to deal with me
[1:51:15] even though Lord
[1:51:17] if you love me and I'm your child you're
[1:51:19] going to bring me back it may be hard
[1:51:21] but you're going to bring me back but
[1:51:23] Lord I don't feel in my heart to do that
[1:51:24] this morning I want to stay where the
[1:51:26] blessings are flowing stay where you can
[1:51:28] deal with me stay where I can be molded
[1:51:30] I want to stay in The Potter's House so
[1:51:32] the Potter can mold me into what I
[1:51:34] should be so today we're not running
[1:51:37] from you Lord we're here and we are your
