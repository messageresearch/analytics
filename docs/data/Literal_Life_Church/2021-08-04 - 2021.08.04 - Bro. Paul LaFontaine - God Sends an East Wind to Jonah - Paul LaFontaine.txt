TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 4 we'll continue to read in the book of jonah and take a lesson tonight in the word we do appreciate all that's come out and all the listening online and we're just believing the lord has something for us and we appreciate god guiding us and direct us to the last few services the way that he has and the things we're discovering in the book of jonah is quite different than what we expected but nevertheless i believe it's been a blessing to us to see a little bit of ourselves in jonah and see god's commitment to his son amen jonah chapter 4 and we're just reading one verse here and then maybe i'll add in in ephesians 2 and that way we don't have to go back and read that again so let's read jonah chapter 4 and verse 8 and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live if you go over in the book of ephesians i'd like to add this in i didn't plan to do this but i plan to refer to it later in the book of ephesians which is catch it here in chapter 4 talking about the winds of doctrine i think it's in chapter 4 yes let's read from verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the protecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftedness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ how many know that's the final goal is for sons to grow into adoption and to grow up and spiritually and that's what paul speaks of in the inheritance chapter here is that we can all through the fivefold ministry through all the gifts god provides through everything he's doing to bring unity and through us growing up out of our childishness to be so swayed by the winds of doctrine that's where we grow up and come into unity and that's where we come into growing is when we're stable and we're not so blown away that's kind of a modern term blown away but we can blow be blown away by the winds of doctrine and he doesn't want us to be blown by every wind that comes along he wants us to be stable amen heavenly father bless your word tonight pray you'll help us and anoint us lord and give us strength and lord whatever the day has given us and each one lord we pray we'd be able to set that aside be able to learn from your word and sit at your feet tonight we thank you for your presence being here we pray you'll minister to your people in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated so we're in a stage speaking about the stage of jonah's life where god has focused his attention on jonah and uh as we were saying sunday that he god it's strange that god would do that because he could be focusing on nineveh who had just repented he could be focusing on the nations and maybe other nations that need god but he's a big god but i find him after jonah does this and becomes angry at this last incident god begins to focus his attention on his elected son his son to to be able to teach him some lessons to be able to cause him to grow up a little bit because he's got some real immaturities he's got some ways about him that are inconsistent there he's got some unfaithfulness about him and yet as we said sunday he doesn't give up on jonah because he is a son god's going to stick with him and stay with him and give him grace and no matter how long it takes to work on him he's going to bring jonah to where he needs him to be a servant of god and a faithful servant a consistent servant and bringing a faithfulness back to god as god is bringing him a faithfulness and i said it in this series how many knows that god is faithful to you amen that's an easy question for a believer because we know he's been faithful so the question isn't god being faithful to us the question is how faithful are we to him and so when a son is unfaithful like jonah has been and shows so many strange characteristics and being up and down all the time and kind of a roller coaster in his emotions and never fully in never fully committed it seems like and so one day he's committed one day is not one day he's jumping on a boat away from the presence of the lord one day he's back and rejoicing and one day he's happy one day he's sad and then now he comes to a place that he puts an emphasis as we'll speak sunday a little bit emphasis on giving pity to this gourd plant instead of the great work of the lord and so god deals with jonah just a little bit deeper we know that he sent the the gourd plant to shade him or the and give him shade from the sun and then he quickly sent the worm to eat the gourd up and so then the plant was gone and so we know god was behind all that god was dealing with him god was as i said suddenly messing with uh personal things in other words personal conveniences that he had in his life and god began to mess with him a little bit not to be mean to jonah but god began to just touch what was going on personally there because god wanted to teach him a lesson don't ever think that god can't put his hand on something in our lives that's dear to us or something that we're tied to too close god can touch anything god is a big god can you say man don't ever think that there's areas of your life that god can't touch he can touch any area especially the place that we hoard over so much and we try to hold on to so much don't hold on too tightly because god can touch that area and god can let you know that you're really not in control of things but god's in control and so now we see then that god starts dealing with them even a bit deeper because besides the worm coming and destroying his shade and then he gets angry again it says god sends a vehement east wind god sends a vehemented east wind besides he has no shade his gourd plant is gone and a worm has eaten it and he's having pity on the gourd dying and all these things god says i'm going to send a vehement i'm going to uh the bible says he prepared he pro god prepared uh a vehement east wind to come now you'd have to do a little study to know what that means because he had a natural vehement east wind hit him which made the matter worse it didn't make it any better you would think god had taught him enough lesson uh just having the gourd die he's in the sun with no shade you would think that'd be enough but god actually goes extra and sends the worst kind of wind in the heat where his bald head no doubt was open to the sun as it was and now he sends this angry east wind against him which made it even worse that's what god said he prepared he prepared a fish one day for jonah can you say man you know why is i don't know why the scripture is using god's preparing these are strange things that god's preparing for us who knows next week that god hasn't prepared something for you and we're not going to look at it as god preparing anything but whatever he prepares it's for our good so here he's prepared of the imminent east wind and so winds are often spoken of in the bible and used uh as types of things that come in our way types of things that test us and i remember my dad even did a little series on the winds and broke them all down and i don't know where those notes are but if i'd had access to those notes mom i would have just used dad's notes tonight instead of my own he had a great little series on the four wins because all of them are in the bible and all of them type strange winds that blow in our lives in different ways to test us and how we react and how we behave to it god can allow certain winds to come in our life that are diff come from different areas and it's all a test on how we react to it so winds are often in the bible uh allegorically typing things that that come in our way and we never can tell which way a wind is going to come from how many knows that jesus said about the holy ghost about it being the wind he says the wind blow it where it's listed and you can hear the sound but you can't tell where it when it's coming when it's going it's one thing about the wind we don't know when it's coming and that's about that's just the same as the winds that's in our life we don't know where it's coming from we don't know when it's coming from we don't know whether it's going to be a north wind or south wind or we don't know what trial is coming next can you say amen that's the the problem with wind it just kind of and the wind is kind of how life is and that is we don't know where the next trial is coming from we don't know the uniqueness of that trial and uh the the fact is is that they're never hardly ever is there ever a perfectly calm day there's always some little wind blowing some days are calm matter of fact monday we were on the boat there with brother tom and it was an interestingly calm time on the water it's rarely calm out there on the on lake erie and brother tom usually picks the times that's not calm to go out uh i don't know why he has that he likes to take people when it's not so calm and it's a lot more fun to him to scare people that way still you know about he's probably about still 18 years old in his energy and in his we're not saying what your age is brother tom but he's still 18 years old about choosing the daring day on the on the seas and in the lake but rarely do we have in the natural rarely everyone so we'll have a calm day but a lot of times there's a wind blowing either north wind south wind an east wind or westerly wind it's a part of our uh uh our weather system can you say that and uh they're they are not predictable like life is not predictable a calm day is rare a calm day in your spiritual life is rare how many can testify that we love the calm days and when we get one when everything was pretty smooth we all thank god for it but we can't in this life have every day a calm day spiritually because we are in a battle can you say amen and we have a god that may allow things to get us from where we are to somewhere else and he has to grow us by our trials and so he allows a certain wind to come and everything isn't as calm as it was supposed to be it's not calm that day there's there's an argument that takes place there's something oh i wish that hadn't happened but yet it's all coming to test how will we react how will we behave as sons of god are we learning how to react to whatever wind comes our way so in a sense we could thank god for the wind i said we can learn to thank god for the wind there are four different winds that bring different things the north wind is cold usually the west wind brings storms the south wind is a warm balmy wind usually and it makes us relaxed the east wind is strange because the east wind it can be extremely destructive that's what the bible speaks of it's an extremely the imminent strong destructive wind although the west wind brings storms the east wind can be even when you get it strong east wind it can be more destructive than any even the storms from the west wind when god sent an eastern wind it was in the bible it was a destructive thing that killed that just knocked out of the plants and knocked i'll read a scripture to you in a minute where man thinks that he's got his whole crop planned and everything's going so well but if he's if he's turning his back towards god god can send the east wind and knock that whole crop out he allows that and to for instruction and for teaching and to teach sons so you know all these different wins do something but i find something interesting about the east one is that can be very destructive and more destructive than all the rest of the winds all of these are spoke of in the bible they are types of what god sends our way as a test what's the test what's the test will we learn to trust him will we stand strong in the wind or will we be wishy-washy will jonah learn to stop getting angry at every little thing will we learn to stop getting angry at every little thing will we let god bake all the greenness out of us as we preached on sunday he said brother brown said we're still green and we got to lay in the presence of the sun because we got greenness we had immaturities in us and the test is are we willing to grow out and let god get all the greenness out of us to bake it out of us can you say amen and and i said suddenly god goes to messing with jonah's comfort just a little bit and and and just just a little bit and then he goes further and prepares and he's wind like he prepared the fish like he prepared other things in jonah's life he prepared things and god has some things prepared for us if we need a lesson in our lives because we're not in a rapture yet we're not there yet can you say man and one of the reasons that we're not is because god is bringing his bride to adoption let me say that i believe part of that is to bring us back to the true not azusa street but back to the book of acts church can you say amen and we weren't there so we only have the prophet's perspective of what it was actually in the book of acts church i believe there's a lot of interpretations to it and he did say that azusa street was only just a repeat of that azusa street was only a restoration of the gifts but it resembled the pentecost a little bit but it wasn't the full pentecost restored yet so we're not we're not stopping at azusa street we're looking for a full restoration back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers the only added thing that we have in prophecy is sons of god coming to adoption in the age of adoption because this is the age of adoption they couldn't fully come where we're going today even though they have the holy ghost and they had the potential to go to it they couldn't fully because it wasn't the age yet it was the birth of the church it was the infancy of the church but now we're not in the empathy of the church we're in the growth and the god is not marrying a baby god is marrying a grown woman that has become the word like he's the word she agrees with the word because our husband christ is the word and we're the wife of the word can you say a man we agree with every word and we follow every word so that's why she comes to a place of maturity and that's why i preach it and emphasize it more than feelings or emotions or setting the people under expectations for just another tent revival that's not what we're shooting for we're shooting for sons to come to maturity let me say this if you come to the maturity of what i'm preaching that we're living spirit-filled lives every day like we should the works will follow the works you don't have to work up the works you live in the spirit god's going to do some things in your life you don't have to you don't have to expect that you just stay led by the spirit instead of your emotions instead of your own mind walk in the spirit can you say amen and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh and god will do exploits in your life it just happens with a spirit-filled christian it happens can you say amen and it won't be a public show it may not be something that the whole world sees the third poll is not a public show but it is every bit of revival in the bride amen so these types of what god sends our way is the question will we stand strong will we let god break the greenness out of us and i said sunday god goes to messing with jonah's comfort just a little bit prepares an east wind and here god has some things prepared for us if we need a lesson and we need to he needs to get us where we need to be here's a bit of learning what it says from a commentator about the winds of the bible just a little research bible contains several references to the power of the wind its variability and its destructive potential besides such uh allegorical imagery in many places the wind is referred to in practical terms only the four basic directions though east west north and south are talked about out of the four winds of the bible the east wind is the one which is a is mentioned most often and it is generally described as very strong hot and a dry wind that's the east wind and that's the one spoken of most in your bible the book of genesis versus chapter 41 6 talks of the heads of the grain that sprouted when that got withered by the scorching east wind in the book of ezekiel chapter 17 it tells how the strong and the tall vine was uprooted and got completely withered and stripped of its fruit by a dry east wind the east wind of the bible is also a fierce wind it can destroy ships on the high seas and the scriptures for all of this it can scatter and sweep out people job chapter 15. jonah 4 8 it was what we read tonight the book of jeremiah 18. the book of exodus describes how god brought it in 10 different forms of plagues over egypt the seventh plague was the plague of hail and it was followed by the next day by the eighth plague which was the plague of locusts exodus 10 13. the sequence was such that the massive hail storms had already rendered the ground wet the next morning god used the east wind to bring in a swarm of locusts which found in the wet sandy soil an ideal environment to lay eggs and breed in huge numbers whatever had survived the hail was completely devoured by locusts the following day god changed the direction of the wind to a very strong west wind and it caught up the locust and carried them into the red sea and not a locust was left anywhere in egypt god in one day can change the wind even in your life he's in control he knows what he's doing so we have got to grow up and be mature and be prepared if god allows a wind in our life we like calm days but if he's allowing a win we say lord i want to get the lesson i want to stand strong i don't want to waver by the wind in my life i want to be accepted that nothing can happen in my life unless god ordained it to happen all things work together for good to them that love god and are called according to his purpose all things means all things it covers a big territory it covers all territory and you don't isolate something and say this is a different deal not as the son of god this is a different deal in my life this is different god can't touch this all things work together for good so god has his hand in this and god is governing over things and people share things with me sometimes and in private which which is fine but there's one thing i i rest in and that is and i tell them no matter how secret this is no matter how secret a battle is god knows exactly what's going on you can't hide anything from him and that in itself gives me a pastor gives me rest can you say amen because i can go to a god who already knows what's going on and say god he's asked you to intervene in that situation god knows what's going on he knows how to fix it he knows how to repair it but we don't tell god how to fix it can you say man we actually say lord whatever you need to do but we're asking you to repair this fix it heal it lord bring this person healing lord we're calling on you to do it whatever way you want to do it but lord do it for your glory and when it's all over with we'll give god glory for it amen hallelujah [Applause] so god can change the wind every day the strong and the east the dry east he goes on here a couple paragraphs and then we'll finish the strong and dry east wind again played a major role in the parting of the waters of the red sea it was an east wind that enabled the israelites to cross it god used the strong east when to drive the sea back turn it to dry land and divide the waters that's pretty that's a pretty strong wind to divide the red sea and they walk across on dry land amen so the sheer power of the east wind that made all this possible was remembered for long and you can find that in psalm 78 26. in the book of hosea there is you can be turning there if you would i want to read this one in the book of hosea there's a warning for any who feeds on the wind pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence an eastwind from the lord will come blowing in from the desert his spring will fail and as well dry up his storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures and we find this over in hosea chapter 13 if you could turn there with me or maybe they could put it up on the screen we were just in hosea just a few weeks ago talking about their unfaithfulness to the lord and here's it says it this way hosea 13 and verse 15 though he be fruitful among his brother an east wind shall come the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilderness and his spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her god remember hosea is about israel rebelling israel become an adulteress so god comes in his judgment and he's letting them know here is that no matter what crops you got no matter what plenteous things that you have no matter what has been built up as being blessings in your life and all these things has has become fruitful for you always remember god can send an east wind you better give god glory in your business because at any time if god wants to teach you a lesson something that seems so secure can get an east wind from god he doesn't do it to be mean you know some of you new ones trying to understand god god never does something to be intentionally mean to anybody god is the one who chastened sons and corrects sons and he allows it's not so much that he he does it but he allows things he allowed things in job's life and so we have to remember that that he can send an east wind on some of the blessings on some of the things that we feel so secure and that's why we try to live humble with a business or live humble with our families don't ever be arrogant and say i put this together i did this i got this job i got this degree i made this successful it's by the work of my own hands you're saying all the wrong things i said you're saying all the wrong things you better say whatever i did i worked hard but i give glory to god for all the increase that's taken place and by the way give ten percent increase to god or you'll get in trouble too that's one of the ways that you show that you're putting god first god deserves god deserves all hundred percent but he lets you keep 90. what kind of deal is this he lets you live on 90 and he takes the 10. so don't get into this thing that hey i've got this successful god can send an east wind at any time it can all be gone that's the world we live in is people putting trust in man people putting trust in their own efforts their own energies their own gifts and i believe in gifts and i believe god can bless a gift i believe the gifts can make somebody successful my wife is talented in some areas that i'm not talented in i've tried certain things that have just fumbled she puts her hand on at certain things it just flourishes some things i put my hand on it flourishes that's just the difference how god's gonna bless something but all of it no matter how good your gift is the glory has to go to jesus christ and at any moment we have to realize his sons our god can send an east wind of the imminent wind and all of it that we've stored up can go so god can allow storms does anybody get anything out of this tonight god can allow storms and winds in life to blow and every one of these things is the type of what we go through spiritually god can send west winds which means storms in our life through the winter we receive west winds and that can have that can have a lot of snow with it that can have tornadoes with it we're in the time of season of tornadoes um west winds have storms and we will have storms come in our lives north wind brings cold winds usually cold winds blowing cold times times where you're challenged become cold in your experience with the lord things come in your life and it begins to take your revival fires away it begins to make you cold towards the lord and make you that just a starchy you can't worship no more you can't be free anymore and it's because a north wind has blowed in your life and you become cold in your experience with the lord you've let the north winds affect your spiritual walk you may be honest and say i let a north wind come into my life and i've become cold and floral i lost the fire in my life at least you can acknowledge it but we want to get to the place that the cold winds they may come but it's not going to take my joy away it's not going to take my shout away it's not going to take my worship away i'm going to come during a cold wind in my life and i'm going to give a full day of worship can you say man i'm going to come on wednesday night whether i'm having a cold winter or not whether i have a cold wind maybe everybody else is starchy and cold towards me or whether i am myself and my body is feeling cold on a cold wednesday night i'm going to come and give god glory [Applause] because i'm not going to become some cold christian when i was a boy my dad traveled to a lot of different places mostly message churches and i'll tell you you got into some places that it felt like going in a catholic or a methodist church and it was supposed to be a message church but it was methodist and like i told you about my dad he was himself wherever he was he come in there and i seen people laugh the head and laughed in 40 years he got them all cracking up and then when he got him cracking up then he brought the drove the point home straight through and you're dead and you need a revival and you need to come to life and he just had a way that he could get in there can you say amen and bring a revival like a live evangelist can do they can get in and stir things up if a church is getting formal god will send the evangelists along and bring conviction can you say man with a state made wait a minute we've got you cold towards the lord here and he'll just shake you all up and hang you over hell a little bit yeah god uses the evangelist you don't want it every service because you never feel like you're going to heaven that's why you need a pastor so you need the fifo ministry but every once in a while we need that to shake us out of our coldness because why we have cold winds blowing you might be having one and now in your life the cold wind blowing in your life just don't let it affect you say lord i feel a cold wind blowing you ever had that where you say something and uh it maybe offends somebody and you just feel a little cool wind coming back from them felt a little cold wind and the response they're coming back from me that's right i've had that in congregations you know felt a little cool breeze come back at me and so so so you can have coldness but you can have people get cold towards you that can be your cold wind i wonder why he's acting that way i don't deserve to be treated that way hey listen don't get in an uproar about it don't become cold yourself it's a cold wind blowing but don't be affected stand strong hold your position a south wind blows when a south wind blows uh it's comfortable there's a scripture that says uh woe to them that are at ease in zion woe to them that are at ease in zion and when you become at ease is when there's a south wind blowing kind of like when we leave here in february and go to florida and the southern breezes are flowing as soon as i get off of the aircraft i just love it but spiritually speaking that's not always good to just relax you and put you at ease because you can lose your fire with that too everything laid back and comfortable and you got your sunglasses on and you're just easing through every day and everything's cool and everything's good and everything's all right and all of a sudden your business is going well and your job everybody's treating you right at the job everything's just there's just a real southern wind blowing and it's going so good you got your sunglasses on life is looking so bright i have to wear sunglasses and then you forget to read your bible for four or five days and then you lay aside where you listen listen listen to the word and truth and preachers preaching and you start missing a few wednesday nights you start taking 50 000 vacations even when you're at home and spiritually you're being affected by a southern wind maybe that one can be most deceiving we know when we're getting a vehement east wind in our lives things are being taken away from us but we may not know as much when there's a southern balmy breezy wind coming in and things are so easy things are never meant to be perfectly easy in our lives they need to be calm right but not easy brother brahman says that christian life is not easy christian life it's an everyday rugged life serving the lord but we have a calmness we have a rest in christ no matter what wind blows our choir saying to us that we we have a rest we can enter into there remaineth the rest of the people of god and that's what i'm preaching tonight there remaineth the rest of the people of god so be careful of this worldly i think a southern wind is it introduces people to too much worldliness and they relax and they vegetate and they they're gonna you know veg on the couch and they i'm gonna go through this whole series and it may not be such a good series for your spirit to take in and and i think worldly things start to creep in and people start to develop worldly things and what they wear and all that and they think it's okay but they're being slowly wooed into something that's taken away from their fire spiritually the southern wind is blowing across the internet and making you follow those fashions just a few months later you're not where you were spiritually because the southern wind blew and a whirly wind blew we lose our revival we lose our fight things are too easy and we relax but the east wind is what we've emphasized tonight and it's what jonah got and it's the most destructive and that's the lesson that god can wipe out things that you hold on too tightly it was an east wind that god sent joke spiritually speaking god sent job an east wind can you say amen clearly he got an east wind because the things that he held here held near his children you know his family his possessions everything got wiped out by an east wind but guess what god certainly didn't do that to be mean to job he was proving something to the devil how many knows that you've heard the story of joe but up he was job is quite different than jonah and that's why you got to look in scripture not everybody is a job not not not everybody is a a a a a matthew some are peters where they say something before they think it not everybody is just this uh perfect person that we see in the bible some were doubters some uh got them lives messed up can you say amen some were doubting thomases saw some were the samson who who gave his uh his his strength to god but he gave his heart to delilah and these men have issues and jonah had issues but guess what all of these men are part of the economy of god all of these men and women in the bible had different facets about themselves and yet because they were sons god kept dealing with them until they made it right don't try to put yourself in a certain shoes of somebody in the bible and say i got be no you are your own person and god is dealing with you in his son in all your weaknesses god will send you wins to test where you're at because he knows you better than you know yourself and the only reason the devil knows you is because he studied you since you were born he knows your weaknesses too but god knows you more than him and god knows what you need to be taken away or given or whatever it is and what wind to blow in your life to test you and if you blow over if you're blown away by the wind that in itself is a test for you say lord i'm not where i need to be knocked you down again get back up a righteous man gets up one more time when he falls get back up and come back and be sure-footed and say lord help me i just got shown clearly that i'm not ready yet and i'm not the son i should be yet but i know you're molding me i know you're making me i know i'm gonna get there i'm gonna make it by the spirit of the lord i'm gonna make it through we're gonna make it we're gonna make it by the spirit of the lord we'll make it through jesus said if we obey jesus said if we obey ike you're saying it since you were five years old help me out here jesus said he'll make a way if his spirit we will obey we're gonna make it we're gonna make it all the way we're gonna make it right we're gonna make it by the spirit of the lord we'll make it through jesus said he'd make a way if his spirit we'd obey we're gonna make it we're gonna make it all the way amen let's give glory to god [Applause] samuel samuel just stepped out in the aisle to see the pastor singing a special there he liked that now he's going back in now i'm gonna go back to preaching he's going back in you like that samuel you like that one praise the lord you love the lord tonight amen god's sons are going to make it and you either come hard or you remember the kin sister anita probably heard me say this 27 years ago you either come hard or you come easy but if your son you're coming because all the father has given me will come so why come hard why come hard why don't you just surrender right now say i'm yours lord take what you want to take out of my life whatever it is my dad coming to the altar when he was young he laid his billfold on the altar he laid his watch on the altar and said my time is yours my money is yours my heart is yours everything is here at the altar why not say lord take it now my bit my successful business whatever it would be lord it's yours i'm just the overseer of it but it's yours you own it why not give it up now why come hard why why why do you have to come hard why not come easy as a son praise the lord so let me try to wrap this up here now why does god let different winds blow to test us to let us see where we're at to burn out some immaturities we can learn to be stand to stand sure-footed and stable to learn how to stay how many want to learn how to stand tonight i don't want to fall in the wind i want to learn how to stand not giving up because a wind comes it's it's meant to blow us down of course the wind is meant to blow us down but for job it was meant to prove to satan that job would stand so the wind is meant by the wind it's meant to blow us down but god when he sends a wind it's to prove a son of god that he can stand says as he comes before the lord do you can you suggest anybody and god says have you considered job i said all right i'll go after him i'll go after him his whole purpose god's whole purpose whole purpose and i know there was some testing for job i know some of that but he was proven to the devil you can take everything away from him and you'll never remove his absolute you'll never make him deny god you never let him leave this message he ain't going to do it and it happened and he stood strong amen so in ephesians 4 the reason i read it is he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine talking about winds tonight i wanted to talk about the winds of doctrine because he says they can be floating and blowing through as well but we've got to be grown up christians and not babies and not be given into such doctrines can you say amen and and blown over by such doctrines and the way he words it here tossed to and fro god doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro now that may be a wind of doctrine or that may be a wind if something didn't come out as a result the way that you wanted it in your life in your business whatever it is some result didn't turn up the way that you wanted it well that's fine but you've got to not be tossed to and fro about it well you know what i just i just god did that or that happened i'll just quit paying my tithes really really i'll just cut it off he didn't do me right that preacher didn't do me right that person that just didn't i'll just cut that off and they'll see and you start making boasts like that you don't have a right as a sun to do that that's being tossed by the wind that's coming through your life people's unfaithfulness is tested by what they go through and it's amazing to me sometimes how something so faithful and then they just let it go when they go through a trial and god wants to see children that are not he don't want to see children he wants to be grown up but he children have the tendency to be tossed to and fro you know children are appealed by certain things that are colorful and flashy or loud sometimes they're easily tossed about they're easily swayed they're easily blown over unless kids are blown over by the wind easier because they're less weight they're kids right so we have to hold on to our kids in the strong winds sometimes wonder if god has to do that to us sometimes he wants us to grow up not be children so we can stand in the midst of the wind and not be tossed somewhere but children can be blown or they can be attracted by something a strange thing and a stranger and they can be running because that's their childish way and they don't have the wisdom yet we as christians can't be tossed about by every window doctrine and the winds of doctrine can be easily toted and preached today easier than it's ever been across the internet and if you're following all those things be careful what you're following because it can sound so good to me doctrines oh i didn't finish this don't be tossed to and fro and carried about every window of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ to me doctrines i would associate doctrines with the north wind you know why because they tend to make you less spirit-filled and more doctrinally oriented and whenever you push too much doctrine especially strange doctrine it quenches the spirit it quenches the spirit-filled services too much doctrine especially strange doctrine and brother branham talked about even when you have a church that has all the doctrine right but no spirit you can teach doctrine too much and quench the spirit of god you can preach the spirit too much and not have any doctrine and then you're in trouble too but northern winds to me are kind of like strange doctrine they quench the spirit they bring arguments northern wind brings arguments amongst the people about doctrine nor arguments make people cold in their walk with god and cold in their feelings towards others how many splits have taken place over doctrine how many cold churches have been cold formal because of a fight over doctrine so i think it's the north wind that begins to blow us that we better get this straightened out and so it's doctrine doctrine and then there's arguments and then we're going to settle this and then every second then there's a big split and then guess what happens you quench the spirit and there's no freedom of the spirit there to bring the softness and conviction in people's lives to say i'm sorry i shouldn't have treated you that way brother i'm sorry brother i shouldn't got cold-hearted towards you none of us have a right to get cold-hearted towards anybody forgive me lord take this north wind of this doctrine i've been holding so strong to but all it's produced is argument of attitude the antichrist church was reduced to nothing left but the brother brahms says that the weapon of argument after the spirit of gone they're left with nothing but the weapon of argument argue are you arguing i believe the truth should be right i think we should have it right but when we take an attitude i'm right and everybody else is wrong i wonder if we've crossed the line the truth has got to be right but we don't always have to be pushing that we're right you didn't say that we we had a prophet come to zero in and hit that truth and get it right on the money and i think it should be i don't think we should play around with it but your attitude about being right and being the only one right now you're crossing the line because you ain't right on everything you ain't that's why god put me in your life and i'm not right on everything so that's why god put you and the rest of the body of christ in my life that's why he gave me a wife as well children that's right because they certainly can point out when you're not right so if all of you thought i was perfect and right just ask my wife and children tonight and they'll give you a true picture he's not all right he's not always right and he's not like a baptist preacher who's baptist preachers they say are oh they may not always be right but they're never in doubt think about that may not always be right but they're never in doubt that they are right doctrines are north like the north wind and then when the south wind blows everybody feels so good outwardly smooth and warm at ease and zion woe to them that are ease in zion makes us relax spiritually too comfortable whatever god allows to blow in our lives to come and blow us his desire is that we are not tossed about and not swayed where we become a people that we're ready to give up everything on any kind of wind that comes in our life we've seen that prove where people were very throwing the towel on the entire message and wonder if some of it because a strong wind blew and tested where they were at they didn't have the new birth they didn't have the new birth they loved the lord no doubt but they didn't have that full experience of the new birth yet that full because that's sealed to the day of redemption and that's never going to what's the evidence of the holy ghost you're never going to deny the word that's the evidence of holiness you're never going to deny any of the word of god people have wins though and they're ready to throw up everything just give up everything and i'm ready to stop this and that's why we have that up and down being tossed about and when that wind came to jonah his head was just frying in the sun when this the imminent wind eastwind came to jonah i kind of felt bad for jonah when i seen that scripture i kind of felt bad then about his head was frying in the sun god removed all the shade and you know when the wind blows the sun burns harder and you know what he did he went right back to his anger and he wanted to die so the work wasn't done yet in job even after a vehement east wind why jonah made a bad choice he wasn't getting it he could say god was in the storm in his life he could say god was in the fish he could say god was in the boat but he wasn't going to admit now that god was in the gourd god was in the worm or that god was in an eastern behemoth he wasn't ready to admit that you may be able to testify and say i've seen god in my life over here i said god way back there 20 years i've seen god in my life but what is god doing in your life right now and can you acknowledge that it's god in your life oh say amen or ouch or something god is everywhere loving you out of your unfaithful half-life your part-time servant life he's going to love you out of it and make you a trusting person in the lord i'm going to wrap this up and through any wind that comes we need an absolute and i'd just like to read this real quick a couple places that brother brown read and then i'm going to read you a quote and we'll we're going to finish tonight but philippians chapter 1 and romans 8 both of these scriptures is where brother branham read the text the absolute so i'm just going to read you the text because that's what understand why he would take this philippians chapter 1 and verse 22. you guys okay but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what i shall choose i what not next one for i am in a straight between two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all of your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or whether i be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel next one and in nothing be terrified for your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god for unto you is given okay let me let me find this here because the one scripture i only wanted one out of there and first timothy philippi philippines philippians that's not you guys fault up there in the video it's mine philippians 1. yeah the 21 20 and 21 is what i wanted according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i should be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether i it be by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gay now this is the text for the absolute there's such an absolute in paul's life that he looks at death you know we got a lot of fear of death today coven brought a lot of fear and it's still promoted to really make people fearful i don't think we should be fearful of anything as christians because when i think we should protect ourselves as we can but our life is in the hands of god i'm not leaving here until god says it's time for me to go and i thought we all believed that right covet doesn't change that and and so so but look at a man saying for me to live as christ but to die is to gain so he's got such an absolute in his life that nothing is going to move him no matter what comes his way no matter what when i win either way praise the lord so now here's his next text romans chapter 8 and this one will be real familiar to you romans chapter 8 and then we'll read what he says in it real quick romans chapter 8 and verse 35 he says and this is what he's reading in the absolute who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or burial or sword or four winds or a vehemented easterly wind who shall be able to separate us from the love of god look at this absolute he has look at this stance that he has as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor a north wind or south wind or west wind nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord that man has an absolute that man's tied to an absolute right and he says in this quote then now he goes right at the beginning of the message and i just want you to pay attention real close and i'm closing here about five minutes every great achievement is tied to an absolute you cannot run life without having absolute you can't make an achievement without it being an absolute for it is the final tie post it's the hitch rack at the end of the journey it's a place where you're tied to something in the day that we're living in now and everything is so breaking up so fragile and carried away i think that this message would be a very appropriate thing what's he preaching on the absolute this message the absolute and he says i think the time we're living where everything is breaking up so fragile and carried away i think that this message would be very appropriate especially to christians when they are going through their deep waters now the christian church is passing through the deepest water it's had for the last 2000 years wow because we are because we are coming to a spot to where there's something presented to christianity something that they have to make a decision on and i think that the christian church ought to have something that they know that they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf upon the water the wind and as the bible said carried about by every wind of doctrine the winds come and blow the little leaf this way and then another wind comes the north wind the south wind the east wind the west wind you'll never get anywhere you're not stable the christian life should be a stable life it should be something that's a principle that that you are tied to that is more than life itself how many tonight want to make christ more than life itself more than this life if you get a sickness god can heal you but if you get a sickness that takes you i've got something in our heart that's more than this life that's what christ has to mean to is more than this life more than my possessions of life amen it has to be more than life itself and then and you might listen now you must have something that you're tied to some people are tied to their business some are tied to their families i never knew brother branham says this but it's so good to put the searchlight on us and say what are you tied to got to read this one sunday when there's more people here we all need it i'm going to read this one again because some people are tied when push comes to shove they're not tied to this word they're tied to their family their absolute is their family and listen i love family i they're they're the closest thing to me outside of jesus christ i love my i love my grandchild back they're saying amen to me tonight she's a wonderful grandchild can anita i know you guys got you know what five or ten now right three nothing like grandchildren they're the they're the reward for not killing your own kids nothing like family that's such a close tie but if i had to make a choice now i'm not tied to my family i'm tied to christ jesus even talked about some families where you have to make a choice unless you hate father and mother doesn't mean go you hate your father but there'll be choices sometimes come if they're swaying you away from this word you've got to make a choice some people are tied to their family some people are tied to their business some are tied to a creed some are tied to the army post we have different things that we are tied to but i think as a christian we ought to be tied where we know is right you see because you might be tied to your family and your wife could leave you my you might be tied to the army and you might get killed you might tie to different things and it's got an end but there has got to be a final tie post there has got to be somewhere that man has got to tie for his eternal destination amen because if you're going to trust it in your work when your work is finished it's done when your family's taken it's over but there's only one thing that i think is the final time post and i believe that paul had a typos in his life here and i'd like to to sign in if we'd call it that way and speak on that type host he said for me to live is christ and to die is gain now christ was paul's absolute it was his typos it was his it was the end of all arguments it was christ was his typos wonderful it's the end of all arguments what's first in my life we don't argue about that christ is first the word is first listening to the word of god is first and my boys and my girls my family they know that there isn't anything there isn't let me go ahead and say it there isn't any volleyball tournament there isn't any event that's going to be the main attraction in life over hearing the word of god not going to happen when my boys played baseball we let them play a lot of sports some people don't believe in sports we let them play uh my wife likes sports i like sports and so when they come and talk about those wednesday night practices and all that say you know what solomon gideon you're out you know you can't do it and sometimes the coach would change to another night so we could go to church but i taught them you're going to be in the house of god we're going to be here in the house of god right because there's a tie post in our lives and it's not football when football's gone someday when baseball's gone someday i want a deeper typos than that and i want my children to have a deeper type host because that's going to be gone someday praise the lord one more quote here in uh the restoration of the bride tree and this is from psalms 1 where he says that man that's blessed will be like a tree planted by the living waters he says it in psalms 1. i don't know how long i'm taking here tonight best of the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so there's the man that's planted the tree that's planted right and then brother branham says here he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water as david saw it and he spoke he said blessed is that man and notice he said he could not die his leaves would not wither no no no matter what they do they'll never kill that tree why it's where he's planted that's what does it it's where he's planted he planted by the rivers of water notice david said his roots won't die you know you take a tree a big old tree i when i was a boy i used to go out and weed us boys we'd go out and had a big old tree we used to sit under big o big old beech tree and the winds would blow and i wonder looked like that thing so much in the top looked like it would blow the thing over but you know every time the wind blows on a tree it rocks the tree and it loosens up the roots so that they can just dig deeper and get a better hole i remember that quote this afternoon i want to bring it up to you that's how i want to be is the winds have a good effect on me because they loosen up the dirt and drive my roots deeper that i can stand my ground amidst the wind can you say amen and he says he says the the it goes deeper and gets a better hold and that's the way mockery laughing making fun of a christian what it does is persecution shakes the christian to make him pray to dig down to get a better hold so he can stand the storm i hope when i get on the other side that i can talk to jonah and i just got a i got a a pretty strong belief that he ended his life this way that he finally got the lesson from the lord and he let the winds drive his roots deeper that he becomes settled can you say that the winds don't make me sway they make me pray more i had a lot of people testify when this whole thing come up five years ago six years or whatever it was i believe the sign and all that just i had a lot of people testify that it made their roots go deeper i'll make it raise your hand because it challenged some people maybe they didn't know completely where they stood where they needed to stand and all of a sudden the winds came through their doctrine like that and it made them search the word it made them pray wait a minute here i need to know where i stand amen i need to know and it made their roots go deeper to where they're they're not having an identity crisis they know exactly who they are even more than they did before see these things are good that comes along and there'll be more coming like that the judas movements and all these things you're going to see judas you're going to see that it happened in jesus life but how do we react to it should make us pray more should make us love more should make us dig our our roots deeper can you say that make us stronger shouldn't it shouldn't make us miss church more it should make us come to church more it should make us miss our bible reading maybe reading our bible more dig deeper can you say about it and that's when satan really gets mad brother jason is that satan sends a win god allows a wind and we become stronger by it and satan says i hate that they become stronger through that wind whether it was north wind or southwest whatever it is they're stronger as a result of it that's where i want to be i want to serve him that way and i'm not fully there yet but i want to be there that whatever wind is blowing maybe i'd pick up on it and say i don't know where this came from but i'm seeing it coming it's starting to blow real hard but i recognize it let me hold my ground let me say stand for righteousness stand for holiness and believe that i need to learn the words to the song stand when all your friends are gone stan when you're all alone and believe he received his own bring it up a little bit kenny let's stand here stand for holiness for righteousness and be counted in a month staying with you you stand when all your friends are gone stand you're [Music] i decided to take a stand not knowing i'll lose my best friend think about it now but i'd rather i'd rather live right than in hell [Music] [Music] come on let's sing it stand for holiness for righteousness and be counted among men that shall reign with him i decided to take a stand not believing i'll lose some of my friends [Music] [Music] you've got to stand [Music] righteousness [Music] shall receive [Music] for righteousness [Applause] [Music] one more time for righteousness [Music] is [Music] lord give us the strength to stand can you say amen and the winds of this world and the wind the winds that god allows comes our way lord make us stronger or let us put our roots down be strong my did i go that long tonight i thought i had a short message and it ended up being long father may your word go with the people may it find a resting place lord may we stand when all of our friends are gone sometimes relationships lord can be a distraction for our relationship with you help us lower the standard sometimes we can be too tied to our family or too tied to earthly things oh god you have a way you can remove that or test us let us know where our security really is it's not in things lord it's not in money it's not even sometimes in relationships because somebody can turn against us they could lose trust and they were disappointed so lord let our tie posts tonight our absolute be in you let our stronghold be you lord may we grow from our tests and trials just got to believe that when we talked to jonah someday that he he learned lord he got it right he trusted in you in the end got to believe that because he's a son and i just thank you for his example i thank you lord that you teach us things out of this small book of jonah this life here i'm thankful for it lord it's taught me a lot i'm not there yet lord there's a lot in here for me truly lord you've shown me a lot in this text for me help me jesus to be a better christian for you help me to be a stronger christian lord bless all those who come tonight listen then give them traveling mercies home lord as we just give this service to you and believe that you are in it you ordain everyone to be here that was here send your word forth lord and we know that it won't return void committing it to you in jesus name [Music] amen everybody said amen that's that song you were doing just before
