[37:14] [Music]
[37:16] here I
[37:17] here I am Hallelujah
[37:24] [Music]
[37:37] eat with me in the scripture
[37:39] God bless you all
[37:41] good to know where we're standing this
[37:43] morning
[37:45] Hallelujah second Corinthians chapter 11
[37:48] we want to read together this verse of
[37:51] scripture
[37:52] second Corinthians chapter 11 and verse
[37:55] we'll just read verse two through four
[37:59] with an emphasis here in verse 3.
[38:05] for I am jealous over you with The Godly
[38:08] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[38:12] husband
[38:13] that I may present you as a Chase virgin
[38:16] to Christ
[38:18] and that's the prophet for the age
[38:20] Paul's speaking that that's his purpose
[38:22] that's his agendas to present the people
[38:25] of God as a chaste virgin to Christ
[38:29] but I fear lest by any means as the
[38:32] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[38:34] satility
[38:36] so your minds should be corrupted notice
[38:39] now he pulls all the way from the fall
[38:41] in the beginning and says not just what
[38:43] happened not just that we know what
[38:45] happened but he he looks at how Satan
[38:48] come through his subtility and how he
[38:51] dealt with eve and he's saying that the
[38:54] same Enemy enemy will try to work the
[38:57] same way in you
[38:58] can you say Amen so this is our enemy
[39:01] and in the same way that he beguiled Eve
[39:04] through his septility so your minds
[39:07] should be corrupted from what from the
[39:10] Simplicity in Christ
[39:14] that your mind should be corrupted now
[39:16] when we think of corruption we think of
[39:18] your mind's being corrupted by the
[39:20] dirtiness of This World by the
[39:23] filthiness by the immorality we think of
[39:25] a corrupt mind and that is that is
[39:28] corrupt those things uh shouldn't we
[39:30] shouldn't look at those things as a
[39:31] Christian because we corrupt our minds
[39:33] how many knows that the the world and
[39:35] the fornication and adultery and just
[39:38] pornography all these things but we
[39:39] think in terms of of of that type of
[39:42] corruption but see this is this is a bit
[39:44] different is that Satan would in his
[39:46] satility corrupt our minds from the
[39:49] Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ
[39:54] so how many know that God is not the
[39:56] author of confusion
[39:58] so who's the author of confusion
[40:01] Satan's the author of it
[40:03] and so he says there he says I I fear
[40:06] that your mind should be corrupted from
[40:08] the Simplicity that is in Christ for if
[40:10] he that cometh preacheth another Jesus
[40:12] whom we have not preached or if we
[40:14] receive another Spirit which ye have not
[40:17] received or another gospel so these are
[40:20] things that come after the message has
[40:22] been preached these are the come things
[40:24] that come after the true message has
[40:26] gone forth now we see other another
[40:29] Jesus preach we see another Spirit
[40:31] brought we see another gospel presented
[40:34] and that's the thing that's can corrupt
[40:36] the people's mind and he says you might
[40:38] well bear with him and then I'll just
[40:40] repeat in verse 3 that your mind should
[40:43] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[40:46] in Christ let's pray Heavenly Father
[40:49] anoint and bless your word as we present
[40:51] it to the people this morning and father
[40:53] may you remove every hindrance from our
[40:55] lives that we could freely receive and
[40:58] freely worship under the word now that
[41:01] you've given us for this age we
[41:02] committed to you in Jesus name amen God
[41:06] bless you may be seated
[41:12] I want to begin preaching and also maybe
[41:16] doing some teaching the next few weeks
[41:18] when we have a service we have brother
[41:19] Daryl Ward coming in next week and we
[41:22] have a brother Wednesday night from
[41:23] Poland coming in that was first time to
[41:25] meet him so remember that service
[41:27] Wednesday brother uh I just his name
[41:30] slips me right now but a brother from
[41:31] Poland I know you enjoy his ministry we
[41:33] want to have brother Marcelo Minister
[41:34] for us but the the places that we have
[41:37] to minister we want to go into a subject
[41:41] of the subject matter of the Holy Ghost
[41:44] we want to teach and to preach on the
[41:48] Holy Ghost a little bit of both that's
[41:49] called preaching
[41:52] I want to go into it and speak on it
[41:55] just a little bit and and uh a few weeks
[41:57] ago we had read Matthew 25 which is the
[42:02] parable or a prophecy for our times it
[42:05] speaks about five wise virgins and five
[42:08] foolish virgins and we realized that
[42:11] they were called version virgins and
[42:13] they were Christians they were all
[42:15] Christians they weren't the uh people of
[42:18] the world but in this parable of the end
[42:20] time at the Midnight Hour at the very
[42:22] last hours we find a parable that we
[42:25] have many Christians and the only
[42:27] difference at the last moment is that
[42:30] five of them had oil and the other five
[42:33] didn't have oil that was the only
[42:35] distinction is that five had the Holy
[42:37] Spirit five didn't have the Holy Spirit
[42:39] and that's one of the last Parables
[42:41] before the coming of the Lord is that we
[42:43] have the only distinction between
[42:45] Christians and one who have the oil and
[42:47] ones who don't have the oil so that's a
[42:49] very significant thing and I trust it
[42:51] was a challenge to all of us not to
[42:53] preach condemnation to us but to breach
[42:56] conviction because I think in order to
[42:58] live in this hour and in order to be a
[43:01] Christian and in order to fight against
[43:02] the devil who belittles us and puts us
[43:05] down and fights against us I think we
[43:07] ought to everyone know that we have this
[43:10] oil
[43:12] amen so I think it's essential can you
[43:15] say Amen it's essential for Christians
[43:18] to know that they have the true baptism
[43:20] of the Holy Ghost and and so that is the
[43:24] only difference in the closing seconds
[43:26] of time and so but I'm always amazed
[43:28] sometimes when I preach a little bit on
[43:30] the Holy Ghost I'm amazed at the
[43:32] response sometimes and sometimes it's
[43:35] good response it's all good response but
[43:37] I'm amazed when I preach a little bit
[43:39] about the Holy Ghost I'm amazed
[43:41] sometimes the response to that the enemy
[43:43] jumps into the situation and begins to
[43:46] jump in and mess with minds and begins
[43:49] to speak to people and begins to raise
[43:51] other questions you know you preach
[43:52] these things to settle questions but the
[43:54] devil doesn't want questions settled he
[43:56] wants to raise more questions and he
[43:59] wants to raise them in your mind that
[44:00] you begin to fear you begin to doubt you
[44:03] begin to doubt your experience with the
[44:05] Lord and I want to say this morning
[44:06] listen if the Lord has dealt with you in
[44:09] any way it doesn't matter what level if
[44:11] it is the Lord then we should rejoice
[44:13] and praise God for how he's dealt with
[44:15] you in your life and I got to say to you
[44:18] that I've Got Confidence that whatever
[44:20] God has done and you can say I know God
[44:22] did this in my life if you know he's in
[44:25] your life if you'll stay in that channel
[44:26] God will give you everything that you
[44:29] need to finish this journey
[44:33] I say that because the devil was present
[44:35] and he listens to and I'm tired of him
[44:38] messing with people's minds
[44:41] we may struggle we may try to get our
[44:43] hand on things we might have different
[44:45] things but we should stop it at the door
[44:47] stop it at the door when the devil tries
[44:50] to mess and corrupt our minds that's one
[44:53] place he should not be allowed to be in
[44:57] oh I should get an a better amen than
[44:59] that
[45:01] but I find that I find that when that
[45:04] subject is presented it's it's it's such
[45:07] a thing that the devil begins to wrestle
[45:09] with people's minds and raise questions
[45:11] and and so I just want to as a pastor
[45:14] break it down just a little bit if
[45:16] that's all right with you so now as a
[45:19] foundation there are some things that we
[45:21] know about our enemy we have learned
[45:23] through the years serving the lord we
[45:25] there's things that we know about our
[45:26] enemy and we know that Satan puts in
[45:30] extra hours extra time when something
[45:33] good is getting ready to happen to a
[45:35] Believer something good is coming to
[45:38] them if he picks up on it or senses that
[45:41] you're a lot of times he says you're
[45:42] beginning to yield more you're beginning
[45:44] to come to the altar you're getting
[45:46] broken uh you're beginning to respond
[45:48] and Satan is watching you do that and
[45:51] that means he's learned that if there's
[45:53] Brokenness and there's yielding and
[45:55] there's obedience and there's this Rush
[45:58] towards God he gets nervous because he
[46:00] knows something good is coming from God
[46:03] to you and I find the devil's nature is
[46:07] that when he knows something good is
[46:08] coming he tries to jump out ahead of it
[46:13] this is one thing we know about our
[46:15] enemy is he tries to jump out ahead
[46:17] matter of fact with all the messages
[46:18] that have come if you study your Bible
[46:21] you realize when Elijah was going to
[46:22] come on with when John the Baptist was
[46:25] going to come it has been told that
[46:27] there were other men that jumped out
[46:28] there saying that they were have the
[46:30] spirit of Elijah on them in our day we
[46:32] had a lot of Elijah's come in the
[46:36] Pentecostal movements and I'm Elijah
[46:38] well I've got the spirit of Elijah and
[46:40] so all of this to me is a work of the
[46:42] enemy because there's only one true man
[46:44] that God puts the spirit of Elijah on
[46:47] but notice how it comes before the true
[46:49] one comes because Satan is wanting to
[46:52] get out there and interrupt things and
[46:54] confuse people's mind before something
[46:57] good happens and then I'll apply that to
[46:58] your life is God's wanting to pour out
[47:01] his blessings pour out his love pour out
[47:03] his holy ghost it's been said before God
[47:06] wants you to have his Spirit more than
[47:08] you even desire it it's not God up there
[47:11] just holding back and saying I'll just
[47:13] wait a little bit until they live
[47:14] perfect that's not our God if there's
[47:17] any limitations it's you and it's the
[47:19] devil can you say Amen God's wanting to
[47:22] give it to you more than you even desire
[47:27] I can tell that I'm already into this
[47:29] and I'm going to have a good time today
[47:31] I'm taking my coat off already
[47:33] somebody say praise the Lord
[47:35] and I also can tell the devil doesn't
[47:37] like what I'm going to say today but I
[47:40] believe we're going to say it anyway so
[47:42] now that we know things about the devil
[47:44] and he he comes out before something
[47:47] good is about to happen in your life
[47:49] I've watched young people as they get on
[47:51] the brink of really break breaking the
[47:53] sound barrier and breaking through and
[47:54] coming to the altar getting broken just
[47:57] on the brink of getting the true baptism
[47:59] of the Holy Ghost something real and the
[48:01] devil will fight that young person the
[48:03] devil will get them involved in all
[48:05] kinds of other things the devil will
[48:07] keep them from church and keep them from
[48:09] the word the devil will give them some
[48:11] kind of worldly girlfriend or some eyes
[48:14] that he catches at work or some girl she
[48:17] sees a guy and he gives her all that
[48:18] attention and the devil goes ahead to
[48:21] stop something good
[48:24] come into that life
[48:26] he wants to connect with you God wants
[48:29] to connect with you
[48:30] but know your enemy he's stepping out in
[48:33] front of it
[48:34] and he wants to distract you can you say
[48:36] Amen
[48:37] and then in the Bible just before the
[48:39] promise came
[48:40] the devil has learned when people really
[48:43] supernaturally connect he jumps out in
[48:46] front of the promise
[48:47] he gets people nervous before the true
[48:49] promise comes the real the real thing
[48:51] and he jumps out ahead and he tries to
[48:54] tries to get a counterfeit to the real
[48:56] thing coming
[48:58] so that's the way the devil works too we
[49:00] know in the promise of Abraham okay
[49:02] Sarah's saying nothing's happening
[49:04] nothing's happening get Hager my servant
[49:06] maybe God meant that and they try to
[49:07] mechanically or they try to work
[49:09] something up and the devil works in
[49:12] those things keeping a person from the
[49:14] true promise coming to them how many
[49:16] knows the Holy Ghost is a promise
[49:19] it's your promise but the devil through
[49:21] history in the Bible has jumped out in
[49:23] front of the promise to try to confuse
[49:26] and to try to turn it into something
[49:28] else and just before the promise he has
[49:30] learned when people I'm just exposing
[49:34] him because we know him now after all
[49:36] these years just before Satan has
[49:38] learned when people really truly connect
[49:41] supernaturally connect with God's
[49:44] promise for that hour when they connect
[49:46] with it those people become powerful
[49:49] they become invincible they become
[49:51] stronger than ever before and Satan
[49:54] knows that and so he's going to keep
[49:55] them from the true promise of the hour
[49:59] he would love to stop it before it
[50:02] happens
[50:03] he would love to stop the promise before
[50:05] it happens but he's never been able to
[50:08] do it no that's the track record now of
[50:11] God you see the thing is is that once
[50:13] God speaks the promise through a prophet
[50:15] once it's spoken that's it it's as good
[50:19] as done
[50:20] and there isn't a demon there isn't a
[50:23] devil with all there is the devil in his
[50:25] minions the devil there isn't any devil
[50:29] or any spirit that once is spoken by the
[50:32] mouth of a prophet you can never stop
[50:35] that promise coming to pass
[50:39] even if it hasn't even come in the
[50:40] people yet or manifested yet you can't
[50:42] stop it
[50:45] see that's before it even gets to you
[50:47] that's just when it's released because
[50:49] God says when I speak a word it will not
[50:52] return void unto me it will accomplish
[50:54] what I set it out to do and the way that
[50:57] he accomplishes it the way he spreads it
[51:00] out there the red the way God puts out
[51:02] his word is through the mouth of a
[51:05] prophet
[51:07] it's one of the biggest things that most
[51:09] denominational systems Miss as a key in
[51:12] this Bible is that God brings his word
[51:15] through Prophets
[51:18] can you say Amen
[51:20] but Satan he's learned that you know he
[51:23] wants to stop the promise before it
[51:24] happens he's never been able to do that
[51:26] but once a prophet speaks it it's really
[51:28] over then it's over it's it's over you
[51:30] can't stop it the game's over when a
[51:32] prophet speaks to it it's over but then
[51:35] Satan has learned when the people
[51:37] connect with the promise when the people
[51:40] connect with the promise then it's
[51:43] really over
[51:44] did it really can't you can't come
[51:46] against it then you really can't stop it
[51:48] because God doesn't just want to bring a
[51:51] prophet and speaking through a prophet
[51:52] he's got that promise and he speaks it
[51:54] it has a lodging place it has a final
[51:57] end it has a place that he's sending it
[52:00] to and I can tell you he's sending it to
[52:03] your soul so you'll manifest it
[52:07] it's not supposed to manifest in the
[52:09] Bible
[52:09] it's not supposed to manifest in books
[52:11] and tapes it's supposed to manifest in
[52:13] his people
[52:18] and the devil's learned you know he's
[52:20] he's mad this morning because I've
[52:22] exposed them once the promise is spoken
[52:25] and once it lodges in the hearts of the
[52:27] people and starts to manifest there
[52:28] isn't a thing that he can do to stop it
[52:31] and the if the wheels are set in motion
[52:33] that's why I say about your own
[52:34] experience with the Lord because in this
[52:36] series I'm going to separate between
[52:38] what God does as a group and and a
[52:40] generation to the individual because
[52:43] it's the same Holy Spirit but he works
[52:45] with you individually
[52:47] and whenever we compare our experience
[52:49] with someone else's we get in trouble
[52:52] but as an individual God works with you
[52:54] and he has your experience and you have
[52:56] to realize when he begins to deal with
[52:58] you Satan becomes angry and no wonder he
[53:01] wants to mess with your mind and make
[53:03] you doubt everything that God has given
[53:05] you because he's got to stop this
[53:07] process but to me when the wheels are
[53:10] set in Motion in my life when I was 16
[53:13] years old when I was eight years old and
[53:15] got baptized I did it because the Lord
[53:17] led me to do that the Lord was in my
[53:19] life then a few experiences later and
[53:21] then at 16 he filled me with this Holy
[53:23] Spirit I look at this as a journey and I
[53:25] see God dealing with me and once the
[53:29] process has been set in motion if God
[53:32] started it God will finish it
[53:38] and you start resting in that
[53:41] because remember what brother rap
[53:42] preached that's what the Holy Ghost is
[53:44] is rest
[53:47] he rested the seventh day because the
[53:50] works were finished before the
[53:51] foundation of the world catch that
[53:52] revelation
[53:54] catch that Revelation I'm resting in the
[53:56] Holy Ghost because the works were
[53:58] finished at Calvary everything that was
[54:00] done was done there the victory was one
[54:02] there for my life the victory has
[54:04] already been won all I need to do is
[54:06] yield myself
[54:08] and once things are set in Motion in
[54:11] your life and you say God has Set Me In
[54:13] Motion I'm going to stay right here I'm
[54:15] going to keep following in everything
[54:16] that I need he's going to give me
[54:22] okay
[54:23] thank you brother
[54:25] thank you all praise the Lord
[54:28] so
[54:30] those who are taught and understand the
[54:32] Holy Ghost will know
[54:35] that I just described to you the basic
[54:37] purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost
[54:40] I've already let it out if you were
[54:42] listening I've just basically described
[54:44] and taught that that is the basic
[54:47] purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost
[54:49] it's when he the person of Truth the
[54:53] person of the word comes in you to make
[54:57] the promise and word for this hour live
[55:00] for this hour that is the evidence of
[55:04] the Holy Ghost
[55:09] can I say it again
[55:13] it's it's the
[55:15] the basic purpose and evidence of the
[55:18] Holy Ghost is when he the person of
[55:19] Truth the person of the word comes into
[55:22] you to make his word for this hour live
[55:24] through you and to lead you and to guide
[55:27] you into all truth
[55:32] that's how we know he's present
[55:35] that's how we know this message is true
[55:36] because why it was in leading us leading
[55:39] the prophet to speak us into more truth
[55:42] into truth that was covered up
[55:44] veiled truth that was unveiled can you
[55:46] say Amen praise the Lord
[55:50] Hallelujah
[55:51] so so now the person of the word so so
[55:54] after
[55:56] let's look at this after it filled those
[55:58] in the upper room because that's the
[56:00] example we go to right away that's the
[56:02] best example after the Holy Ghost filled
[56:05] those in the upper room
[56:06] the question was raise
[56:09] for those who were looking carnally and
[56:12] looking at here they come out of the
[56:13] upper room something happened up there
[56:15] they weren't up there so but they see
[56:16] the effects of the Holy Ghost they see
[56:18] the effects and the effects was my they
[56:20] were baptized in something that made
[56:22] them just begin to glorify God and lose
[56:24] all their pride and lose all the and
[56:27] come down there staggering drunk drunk
[56:29] like drunk men coming out of the upper
[56:32] room and but what they were doing is not
[56:34] speaking unknown tongues they were
[56:36] glorifying God and they weren't ashamed
[56:38] to do it praise be to God God has done
[56:41] something God has done something but I
[56:43] want to say to you they weren't just
[56:45] saying oh and because the question was
[56:47] what is this Peter what is going on here
[56:49] what is this they were asked and that's
[56:51] the question what is this going on what
[56:54] is taking place and I want to say that
[56:56] Peter did not point to any emotion he
[56:59] said they are not drunk as you suppose
[57:02] people are drunk he didn't say well we
[57:04] were just up there we were all together
[57:05] and man we started to sing and all of a
[57:07] sudden just we just got built up in
[57:09] ocean he didn't say that Peter said what
[57:12] is this Peter pointed to the word
[57:15] he said this this is that which is
[57:19] spoken by the prophet Joel
[57:23] everything that you're seeing here and
[57:26] especially as far as the person of
[57:27] Christ coming by the Holy Ghost in their
[57:29] souls first time ever in history it came
[57:31] on David's spirit and by the way the
[57:33] Holy Ghost came so much in the
[57:34] neighborhood it couldn't come on his
[57:36] soul yet because there was no Calvary
[57:37] his soul had the serpent nature you
[57:40] can't put the Holy Spirit on the serpent
[57:41] nature so but David with the Holy Ghost
[57:44] on his spirit
[57:46] worshiped and danced and and glorified
[57:50] God and it was only on his spirit
[57:54] glory be to God
[57:59] with it just the Holy Spirit on his
[58:01] Spirit he says I was glad when they said
[58:04] unto me let's go to the house of the
[58:06] Lord
[58:09] if you're hungry for the Holy Ghost and
[58:10] it's doing something to you you might be
[58:12] saying the same thing I was glad when it
[58:14] was church time I wasn't looking for a
[58:15] reason to miss it my schedule's too
[58:17] tight the Holy Spirit leads a person to
[58:19] say I'm glad it's church now I'm ready
[58:21] to go to church
[58:23] oh somebody ought to give me an amen
[58:25] somewhere without them because so now
[58:28] I've got to get on this is that now it
[58:30] can come in the soul and but Peter did
[58:33] not say we're having a big Revival here
[58:36] and there's there's something strange
[58:38] going on I don't understand what's going
[58:40] on but it just feels good people Peter
[58:43] never said that
[58:44] Peter could take the word that came from
[58:47] the prophet Joel
[58:48] and say What's Happening Here In The
[58:51] Souls of men is right here in the
[58:53] scripture it's a promise in Joel and
[58:55] that promise now after hundreds of years
[58:58] is happening and has happened in this
[59:00] Upper Room
[59:02] what was happening was not just an
[59:04] emotion it was the word being fulfilled
[59:07] for that hour
[59:10] and that's why brother Brent says you've
[59:12] got to take your experience back to the
[59:14] word
[59:16] is that okay with everybody
[59:18] it's to the word this is that it was it
[59:21] was just I don't know we're just all
[59:23] drunk and we don't know what's going on
[59:24] but I'm enjoying it would you it's like
[59:26] people come here and say what did he say
[59:28] today I don't know what he said but it
[59:30] sure felt good
[59:32] come on people
[59:33] and you know I'm correcting things
[59:35] because we can't live on the surface we
[59:37] can't live on Bubble dances we can't
[59:39] just live on a Feeling can you say Amen
[59:41] Monday morning the feeling may be gone
[59:43] but the word in our life is not gone the
[59:45] promise is not God what God has done in
[59:48] your life is not gone
[59:50] so that's why we can shout and rejoice
[59:52] on Monday morning the same as we do on
[59:54] Sunday at church
[59:56] that's why our Revival is not to the
[59:59] next cat meeting a Revival is every day
[1:00:01] in the Holy Ghost
[1:00:03] and we don't need any music we don't
[1:00:05] need anybody around we don't need Kitty
[1:00:07] we don't need the drummer we don't even
[1:00:09] need the preacher the revival can stir
[1:00:11] up within us on Monday morning and say
[1:00:14] devil I'm ready to meet you
[1:00:20] Hallelujah
[1:00:21] yes sir
[1:00:23] brother Marcelo
[1:00:24] if you invite me I'll come to preach
[1:00:26] this in Mexico
[1:00:28] praise be to God Hallelujah
[1:00:31] what is this
[1:00:34] let's book the trip let's go tomorrow
[1:00:37] I'm ready
[1:00:39] they said what is this Peter he referred
[1:00:42] he didn't refer to anything except the
[1:00:44] word he went to the Lord this is that
[1:00:45] not emphasizing the emotion of it he
[1:00:47] said this is that was the motion part of
[1:00:49] it yes but remember I said we don't know
[1:00:52] how everybody worshiped in their emotion
[1:00:54] we don't know how we weren't there
[1:00:57] so some people felt the presence of the
[1:00:59] Lord they knew something changed tongues
[1:01:01] of fire set upon each of them they were
[1:01:03] all filled with the Holy Spirit and so
[1:01:05] but we we do not know that every person
[1:01:07] worshiped exactly the same way
[1:01:10] so don't assume and put it God in a box
[1:01:13] we don't know all we know is they were
[1:01:15] changed they were filled with the Holy
[1:01:17] Ghost
[1:01:21] is this helping anybody here this
[1:01:22] morning
[1:01:24] so this is the word being fulfilled in
[1:01:26] Us in this hour there was a reason Peter
[1:01:29] said what is this this is the word being
[1:01:32] fulfilled in us there's this is the
[1:01:34] promise happening in me there was a
[1:01:36] reason for the outward motion there was
[1:01:38] a reason that they were drunk in the
[1:01:40] spirit and glorifying God the word the
[1:01:42] promise was happening something on the
[1:01:45] inside was happening and it was showing
[1:01:48] up on the outside
[1:01:51] he the person came in them to fulfill
[1:01:54] the promise of that hour it's from the
[1:01:57] inside out not the outside in
[1:02:02] what is the Holy Ghost when it really
[1:02:04] trumps really comes to you it's work
[1:02:06] it's the inside out not the outside in
[1:02:09] you don't get caught up in something on
[1:02:11] the outside and don't get nothing real
[1:02:12] on the inside
[1:02:15] it's in the inside out not the outside
[1:02:18] in
[1:02:19] so
[1:02:20] the devil tries to stop the promise
[1:02:24] if he can't stop it which he can't he
[1:02:28] looks
[1:02:29] to mess with it afterwards
[1:02:35] he tries to get it before he can't do it
[1:02:37] and then he tries to do other things
[1:02:39] maybe while it's going on but he really
[1:02:42] observes and watch watches what it is
[1:02:46] that's happening outwardly
[1:02:48] and tries to copy it
[1:02:53] but he can't copy the real life of the
[1:02:57] Holy Ghost Inside a Believer he can't
[1:03:00] get it himself
[1:03:03] because if he if he if he got it himself
[1:03:05] he'd have to be justified Sanctified
[1:03:08] filled with the Holy Ghost then he
[1:03:10] wouldn't be the devil he'd be your
[1:03:11] brother
[1:03:12] and you'd have to shake his hand
[1:03:15] but when you go down that path of
[1:03:17] justification sickness and baptize with
[1:03:19] the true Holy Ghost he's he's your enemy
[1:03:22] can you say amen and so now Satan
[1:03:24] watches I've said it this way if he he's
[1:03:27] watching everybody in in Judea and
[1:03:30] everybody in Jerusalem is watching these
[1:03:31] come out of the out of the upper room
[1:03:33] but Satan is watching too and he can't
[1:03:36] duplicate or copy what's happening to
[1:03:39] them on the inside but he has through
[1:03:42] countless years tried to copy the acts
[1:03:46] and the manifestations
[1:03:49] of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:52] now why why would he do that why would
[1:03:54] he try to copy that because he can't
[1:03:56] have the life he can't do that so he
[1:03:58] can't find the source of what's really
[1:04:00] happening in the soul level he can't get
[1:04:02] there he has no hands to touch that he
[1:04:04] can't do it but he can copy he's a
[1:04:06] copycat he's a copycat he's a duplicate
[1:04:09] he's trying to recreate situations
[1:04:12] recreate atmospheres do that and but why
[1:04:14] does he do it he does it because he
[1:04:17] wants to misdirect people from the power
[1:04:19] of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:23] so now you can say
[1:04:25] what I don't say what the scripture
[1:04:27] proclaims and what the prophet proclaims
[1:04:29] now Satan is able
[1:04:33] to in that atmosphere
[1:04:35] every gift of the nine spiritual gifts
[1:04:39] can be imitated
[1:04:42] I don't understand all that I just know
[1:04:45] that it's true
[1:04:46] he can't touch the life of it
[1:04:49] he can't change a life
[1:04:52] but he can make a life copy what's going
[1:04:55] on and he can allow people to get under
[1:04:58] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:05:00] the unjust now why would he do that and
[1:05:03] why wouldn't he go just say let's go to
[1:05:05] the bar man forget all this rejoicing in
[1:05:08] this holy ghost stuff let's just go
[1:05:10] serve the world uh he's smarter than
[1:05:13] that
[1:05:14] so if he can through 2000 years of
[1:05:17] church history if he can get people to
[1:05:20] come back into Works doing Works doing
[1:05:24] things then he can Sidetrack a real
[1:05:27] genuine New Birth and a change in the
[1:05:29] soul and if they do the works if they
[1:05:31] imitate the emotion or if they can do
[1:05:33] all the stuff that's around it then he
[1:05:36] deceives that person because they didn't
[1:05:38] really get the real thing
[1:05:41] and that's all he needs because when
[1:05:43] they get the real thing they become an
[1:05:45] invincible Army
[1:05:46] he don't know how to deal with them
[1:05:49] and I've said before if he was really
[1:05:51] smart which he's not he's dumb
[1:05:53] if he's really smart he would have never
[1:05:56] planted Jesus in the ground
[1:06:01] what a dummy
[1:06:04] because Jesus already says you plant
[1:06:05] this in the ground it's going to bring
[1:06:07] forth
[1:06:08] so he hit for three three and a half
[1:06:09] years he had one to deal with with the
[1:06:11] power of the Holy Ghost all over him
[1:06:14] he plants it in the ground it resurrects
[1:06:16] and a few days later he's got 120.
[1:06:19] talk about Harvest
[1:06:21] and then thousands of souls came to the
[1:06:23] kingdom God got filled with the Holy
[1:06:24] Ghost
[1:06:25] and the thing is going what did I do I
[1:06:29] was better just to deal with one now I
[1:06:30] got 120. now I got a thousand with the
[1:06:33] same Spirit on them
[1:06:35] because he's dumb he didn't realize that
[1:06:38] if you allow that to be planted into
[1:06:39] that that's what grows and it grows and
[1:06:42] it grows this Holy Ghost grows and grows
[1:06:45] and grows it is the power to grow it is
[1:06:47] the power to bring the full promise it's
[1:06:49] the power to take you to a Rapture it
[1:06:52] has power that Satan Can't Stop
[1:06:57] amen
[1:07:01] so
[1:07:03] this is what we know of Satan as well he
[1:07:06] likes to complicate and confuse what God
[1:07:10] has done or is doing
[1:07:13] what God sends
[1:07:16] is always simple
[1:07:21] it just needs simple faith
[1:07:23] now I'm quoting the message now
[1:07:26] how many know that the message comes God
[1:07:28] sends it in simplicity
[1:07:30] that it confounds the wise
[1:07:32] don't you ever make this message
[1:07:33] complicated that's the devil when God
[1:07:36] sends something it's simple and matter
[1:07:38] of fact it's so dirt simple that most of
[1:07:41] the world miss it and say that can't be
[1:07:43] God
[1:07:45] but we know that the message is simple
[1:07:47] and we know that it takes just simple
[1:07:50] Faith as a mustard seed to believe it
[1:07:53] that's what he needs that simplifies it
[1:07:55] God said what he sends is simple can
[1:07:58] everybody just get that point this
[1:08:00] morning to say what God sends is simple
[1:08:02] say it with me what God's sins is simple
[1:08:06] no everybody say it with me what God's
[1:08:09] sins is simple
[1:08:12] and the way to receive it is through
[1:08:15] simple faith
[1:08:19] simple faith not complicated faith
[1:08:21] simple faith
[1:08:24] the devil Works overtime and puts in
[1:08:26] extra hours to take what comes from God
[1:08:29] and to complicate it where our text says
[1:08:33] in the minds the corruption in our
[1:08:35] thinking to take something simple that's
[1:08:37] come from God and to confuse it
[1:08:40] questions can confuse people instead of
[1:08:43] help people
[1:08:45] so you always say who's asking the
[1:08:47] question what's the source of the
[1:08:49] question
[1:08:50] there's nothing wrong with a question
[1:08:53] but what's the spirit behind the
[1:08:54] question
[1:08:55] I think the Pharisees motive for asking
[1:08:58] questions
[1:08:59] was different than a sincere believer
[1:09:04] and a lot of times Jesus didn't even
[1:09:05] answer the questions he would answer it
[1:09:07] with another question because you know
[1:09:08] Jesus knew it wouldn't do any good with
[1:09:10] the Pharisees to to spend three hours
[1:09:12] having coffee with them four hours spent
[1:09:15] a week with them with that because that
[1:09:18] spirit's already banned Pharisees are
[1:09:20] already bent on their questions are for
[1:09:22] a reason I already don't believe this I
[1:09:24] already am against this I already you
[1:09:27] know and so because he knows that then
[1:09:30] he could but you see when another
[1:09:32] question comes of a Believer it's the
[1:09:34] source of the question
[1:09:36] you know when I had that uh 15 10 15
[1:09:39] years ago when I had a lot of questions
[1:09:41] come about things uh and they said I'm
[1:09:43] I'm they even said I'm sincerely asking
[1:09:45] these things but then the questions they
[1:09:48] sent to me in an email I went online and
[1:09:51] I did a little thing and I realized that
[1:09:53] the very same questions came from a
[1:09:55] source
[1:09:57] they weren't being sincere because the
[1:09:58] questions were veratum from another
[1:10:00] source
[1:10:03] so
[1:10:05] the simplicity so let's just let's just
[1:10:07] lay some more foundations I'm only on
[1:10:09] the foundations
[1:10:14] the Simplicity of Christ
[1:10:17] in Paul's day was the message of Paul
[1:10:24] when he says corrupt your minds from the
[1:10:26] Simplicity in in Christ it was the
[1:10:29] message of Paul that was the Simplicity
[1:10:31] of Christ
[1:10:32] and the message that pointed people to
[1:10:34] Christ how many leave a true message
[1:10:36] will Point people only to Christ
[1:10:39] so the the Simplicity of Christ was
[1:10:41] Paul's message it was not just Jesus
[1:10:45] went to Calvary and that's all
[1:10:47] it was Paul's message of the Christ in
[1:10:50] you you see now you have Christ and his
[1:10:53] work finished work at Calvary then you
[1:10:55] have his resurrection bringing us the
[1:10:57] power so it can be poured out upon us
[1:10:59] and so you have that that that which he
[1:11:02] did but now Paul comes into what he
[1:11:04] calls the mystery of Christ that term
[1:11:06] had never been heard before the Jews
[1:11:08] certainly didn't understand it and a lot
[1:11:10] of people that Paul was talking to
[1:11:12] didn't understand it what are you saying
[1:11:13] Paul the mystery of Christ there was a
[1:11:16] mystery hidden in Christ it wasn't just
[1:11:18] that he went to Calvary it wasn't just
[1:11:20] about that it just it wasn't just that
[1:11:22] he took away our sins and it wasn't just
[1:11:24] that he resurrected something came from
[1:11:27] that act that would affect our lives in
[1:11:30] the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:32] so Paul began preaching the mystery of
[1:11:35] Christ and that was part of the whole
[1:11:37] message of Christ because because it was
[1:11:41] bringing this mystery that would
[1:11:43] ultimately be not just talking about
[1:11:46] Jesus in the four gospels but the
[1:11:49] mystery is Christ in you the hope of
[1:11:53] glory
[1:11:58] so it wasn't just that Paul he he he
[1:12:01] directed people to Calvary in the work
[1:12:03] of Calvary he directed people to the
[1:12:05] resurrection he talked about but it
[1:12:07] wasn't just he talked about the ACT he
[1:12:10] was preaching the power that comes in
[1:12:12] our lives from that act
[1:12:16] in our lives
[1:12:17] if he was only talking about Calvary in
[1:12:19] the resurrection then why I would say
[1:12:21] this why did we need all of Paul's
[1:12:23] teaching why did we need a prophet after
[1:12:25] Calvary if if we did not need anything
[1:12:28] after Calvary and we only just we can
[1:12:30] believe in what Calvary did for us and
[1:12:32] that's it but we don't need any Paul's
[1:12:34] teaching that's the amazing thing about
[1:12:35] it Paul is acknowledged by most of the
[1:12:37] Christian denominant nations as being
[1:12:39] one there's only a few that don't
[1:12:41] believe his stuff but they give him the
[1:12:43] authority they give him the authority to
[1:12:45] speak about Christ and 14 books of the
[1:12:49] New Testament belong to Paul and is
[1:12:52] considered the Canon of scriptures it's
[1:12:54] the authority of God that was spoken
[1:12:56] through Paul how does that work when
[1:12:59] you're trying to present a prophet in
[1:13:00] the same level as Moses and him coming
[1:13:02] for our days so no no it can't happen in
[1:13:04] our day and we give Paul The Authority
[1:13:06] that what he came was the word of God
[1:13:09] how do you do that
[1:13:11] and then deny a prophet for this hour
[1:13:14] you can't it doesn't it doesn't work
[1:13:16] together that way is anybody listening
[1:13:19] so how did Paul he begin to preach of
[1:13:22] course he preached Church order and he
[1:13:24] preached marriage and divorce the same
[1:13:26] as Jesus preached he preached uh Church
[1:13:28] order he preached putting the gifts in
[1:13:31] order he you know he's preaching the
[1:13:33] gifts saying God pours these gifts upon
[1:13:35] the body of Christ he preaches all that
[1:13:37] but the along the lines he's he's
[1:13:40] pointing people to the power of the
[1:13:42] Resurrection if by if I be risen with
[1:13:45] Christ
[1:13:47] can you imagine people some people
[1:13:49] saying wait a minute wait a minute now I
[1:13:51] I'd like to hear about when Jesus came
[1:13:53] out of the Tomb I like to sing about it
[1:13:55] uh I like to sing the Hallelujah Chorus
[1:13:57] at church and all we're just so excited
[1:14:00] about talking about the resurrection and
[1:14:01] we do here on Easter but but I want to
[1:14:03] let you know it's not just Easter I talk
[1:14:04] about the resurrection I'm preaching the
[1:14:06] power of the Resurrection every service
[1:14:09] and when he says the term when he says
[1:14:12] if I be risen with Christ they're going
[1:14:14] please tell me what you mean because
[1:14:17] something more happened when you come
[1:14:19] out of the Tomb that I can rise with
[1:14:22] Christ as well
[1:14:24] in the power of the Resurrection
[1:14:26] through the Holy Ghost
[1:14:29] so a prophet why why do we need a
[1:14:31] prophet we don't need it we just need to
[1:14:34] look at the story of Calvary he not only
[1:14:36] talked about the account of Calvary and
[1:14:38] the empty tomb but he was preaching the
[1:14:40] power in our lives that comes from that
[1:14:43] where did Paul get his Thor authority to
[1:14:46] say First Corinthians 14 37 if you guys
[1:14:49] want to bring it up I want to ask you
[1:14:50] for First Corinthians 14 37 where did
[1:14:52] get Paul get the authority to say this
[1:14:55] in First Corinthians 14 37 If any man
[1:14:59] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:15:01] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:15:04] things that I write unto you are the
[1:15:08] Commandments of the Lord
[1:15:11] I could be very carnal right now and say
[1:15:13] who gave that man to the authority to
[1:15:16] say the word that came for him and the
[1:15:17] things that he wrote are the
[1:15:19] Commandments of the Lord I can see a Jew
[1:15:20] saying hey you ain't nothing we've got
[1:15:22] our Commandments from Moses
[1:15:25] I've got my Ten Commandments and that's
[1:15:26] all I need and you're not one of them to
[1:15:28] bring Commandments and he's taking his
[1:15:30] message why did Paul say that not to
[1:15:32] build up his own Ministry not that he
[1:15:34] was not a flesh man himself but the word
[1:15:37] the thus said the Lord that came through
[1:15:38] him like it did Moses when it came and
[1:15:41] it was thus said the Lord it was the
[1:15:44] word of God
[1:15:48] where'd he get the authority to say that
[1:15:49] where do you get the 30 in first
[1:15:51] Thessalonians 2 and verse 13. first
[1:15:54] first Thessalonians 2 and 13 where do
[1:15:57] you get the authority to say that uh
[1:16:02] for this cause also first Thessalonians
[1:16:05] 2 13. for this cause also think we god
[1:16:08] without ceasing because when ye receive
[1:16:10] he's talking to the Thessalonians when
[1:16:13] you receive the word of God which we you
[1:16:15] heard of us ye received it not as the
[1:16:19] word of men
[1:16:21] but as it does in truth the word of God
[1:16:24] which effectually worketh also in you
[1:16:27] that believe
[1:16:32] I don't know
[1:16:34] but uh
[1:16:36] he preached Paul's message was the
[1:16:38] Simplicity of Christ
[1:16:40] it's others who's anointed by Satan came
[1:16:42] and presented another Jesus and another
[1:16:44] gospel and another Spirit what for Satan
[1:16:47] likes to confuse the minds of the people
[1:16:50] from what God has sent
[1:16:52] so now in relation to my subject on the
[1:16:55] Holy Ghost in relation to the Holy Ghost
[1:16:56] I don't know of a subject Satan has
[1:17:00] tried to mess with so much as the
[1:17:03] subject of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:09] and we're not just talking about
[1:17:10] recently we're talking about
[1:17:14] since it started
[1:17:16] since this filling and this baptism and
[1:17:19] this change in this born-again
[1:17:21] experience happen Satan has tried to
[1:17:24] confuse people's minds as to the
[1:17:27] interpretation of it what it is he wants
[1:17:30] to confuse people isn't it amazing that
[1:17:33] the most important thing that God can
[1:17:36] ever do to an individual is one of the
[1:17:40] most confused things by Satan in the
[1:17:43] church
[1:17:45] it should say to us that's pretty
[1:17:47] important
[1:17:49] if if you look at something that's been
[1:17:50] so confusing and trying to confuse the
[1:17:52] young people trying to confuse everybody
[1:17:53] for ages uh if you say wow
[1:17:57] Satan's really doing his work to confuse
[1:17:59] my mind on this
[1:18:00] and belittle me and make me feel uneasy
[1:18:04] and make me feel like I don't have
[1:18:06] anything from God
[1:18:08] uh
[1:18:09] I just trust the Lord can lead me into
[1:18:11] some things to help us because
[1:18:13] it's Satan's work to confuse things it's
[1:18:16] Satan's work to say something simple and
[1:18:18] make it complicated
[1:18:21] I don't know of any subject isn't it
[1:18:23] amazing that the most important thing
[1:18:24] that God has ever done in an individual
[1:18:26] is one of the most confused things by
[1:18:28] Satan we ought to always be aware of
[1:18:31] this
[1:18:32] Satan is around and know that we know
[1:18:34] the say the Devils listen we know that
[1:18:38] we know the devil's lying to us when his
[1:18:40] lips are moving
[1:18:42] is that okay we know that when is the
[1:18:45] devil lying when his lips are moving
[1:18:46] and he's speaking to our minds okay
[1:18:49] if if God is not the author of confusion
[1:18:51] then who is the author of that it's
[1:18:53] Satan is the author of confusion
[1:18:54] somebody has to be the author he's the
[1:18:56] father of lies he's the author of
[1:18:58] confusion it's your experience with
[1:19:01] Christ that he will discredit the most
[1:19:03] and try to discredit the most and try to
[1:19:05] play with your mind the most to try to
[1:19:08] figure it all out and the more we try to
[1:19:10] figure it out the more confusing it
[1:19:12] becomes
[1:19:14] to make you doubt it can you say Amen
[1:19:18] the Jews could dwell on how they
[1:19:20] rejected Christ and we heard this
[1:19:22] Wednesday night in the teaching from
[1:19:23] Brother rap the Jews could dwell on how
[1:19:25] they rejected Christ Christ forever and
[1:19:28] they actually killed their Messiah but
[1:19:30] then mercy came to them oh listen to the
[1:19:32] service Wednesday night our merciful god
[1:19:35] we can't limit God's word mercy friends
[1:19:37] you can't live in God's mercy to anybody
[1:19:40] you don't have a right to do that
[1:19:43] and so God's mercy came to the Jews who
[1:19:46] actually killed their Messiah and
[1:19:48] somehow at the end he gives them another
[1:19:50] opportunity and what he says was they've
[1:19:53] been mourning for days and they've been
[1:19:54] distraught but now everything changes as
[1:19:56] God steps in and gives them mercy and
[1:19:59] gives them another Revival they didn't
[1:20:01] deserve that at all
[1:20:04] but there came a time that it's time to
[1:20:07] stop mourning over what you've done
[1:20:10] and his brother rap said it when he
[1:20:13] spreads his Mercy to us it's time to
[1:20:16] rejoice and brother rap said oh that
[1:20:18] feeling that's going to come to those
[1:20:19] Jewels someday as they know they kill
[1:20:21] their Messiah but an overwhelming more
[1:20:24] powerful feeling comes of mercy and and
[1:20:26] and and and and spreads through the
[1:20:28] glory be to God you talk about a Revival
[1:20:33] and that's what should happen when his
[1:20:36] Mercy is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:20:38] because you don't deserve it either
[1:20:42] well they killed the Messiah well how
[1:20:44] many times in your life have you
[1:20:46] stepped upon the cross of Christ and
[1:20:49] rebelled can you say Amen
[1:20:52] but that's not now
[1:20:54] his mercies come in your life
[1:20:56] so now those Jews it's time to stop
[1:20:58] Mourning
[1:21:01] it's time to stop mourning it's time to
[1:21:03] start being stop being unsettled about
[1:21:05] well maybe I don't get the grace of it's
[1:21:08] time to stop doing that and it's time to
[1:21:11] start enjoying the mercy of God who has
[1:21:14] come to your life
[1:21:17] if some of you don't get anything else
[1:21:18] today I'm telling you as your pastor
[1:21:20] it's time for you to get rid of the past
[1:21:22] and stop letting the devil corrupt your
[1:21:24] mind about the Holy Ghost or whatever it
[1:21:27] is and it's time for you to lift your
[1:21:29] hands and say I know God's mercy has
[1:21:31] come to my life and that Mercy will take
[1:21:33] me the whole way and that's it there's
[1:21:35] no more discussion there's no more of
[1:21:38] confusion can you say Amen
[1:21:43] Hallelujah and that's when you get that
[1:21:46] coffee cup in the morning
[1:21:48] I got it I said it on my desk I was
[1:21:50] going to bring it out here Brandon bring
[1:21:51] it out here later because I'm I might
[1:21:53] order one for all of you I found this
[1:21:55] coffee cup it's a great big one you get
[1:21:57] this coffee cup and I gave one to my
[1:21:59] daughter when she was going through her
[1:22:00] hard times here last year I gave I
[1:22:02] bought one for her and it just simply
[1:22:04] says not today Satan
[1:22:08] and if I get you one for Christmas this

[1:22:22] I don't have time for it I don't have
[1:22:25] time for you to corrupt my mind my life
[1:22:28] has been exposed to the mercy of God and
[1:22:31] that Mercy will take me the rest of the
[1:22:33] way there's no more discussion
[1:22:38] why do we give the devil a place at our
[1:22:40] breakfast table why do we give them a
[1:22:42] place in our minds don't even give them
[1:22:45] a place to talk to you
[1:22:54] so we know oh we know some things about
[1:22:57] anything I've got to move on from this
[1:22:58] but uh so now we need to rejoice in the
[1:23:02] mercies of God we don't know how we
[1:23:04] deserved it but we're not going to try
[1:23:06] to figure out how we deserved his grace
[1:23:08] yes
[1:23:11] did you bring coffee in it I need a
[1:23:13] coffee
[1:23:17] let's give a hand to this buddy you

[1:23:20] for the kingdom of God

[1:24:00] put that in front of the devil
[1:24:02] I'm buying it for you whatever is needed
[1:24:05] but you don't need just a cup you need
[1:24:07] an aggression against the enemy say stop
[1:24:09] messing with my mind
[1:24:11] this is not your playground to give me
[1:24:13] your thoughts
[1:24:15] you don't have a right to interpret my
[1:24:17] experience on the Holy Ghost and the
[1:24:19] mercies of God Only God can tell me what
[1:24:21] I've got
[1:24:25] I don't have to figure it out I don't
[1:24:26] need the devil helping me try to figure
[1:24:28] it out it's not something you can figure
[1:24:30] out
[1:24:33] so let's stop Satan doing that let's
[1:24:35] stop making confusion you know uh this
[1:24:39] is really a bit carnal but I was I
[1:24:41] always think of a little clip of a movie
[1:24:44] that I watched years ago and this in
[1:24:47] this movie there's this man that's he's
[1:24:49] supposedly insane and so he's hounding
[1:24:52] his doctor he's trying to get over his
[1:24:53] doctor and he just you know he's just
[1:24:55] always telling and so he's a little
[1:24:57] messed up proves at the end he's not
[1:24:58] that messed up the doctor ends up being
[1:25:00] more messed up than him so I'm not
[1:25:02] recommending movies here but I can never
[1:25:04] get away from what he the doctor goes on
[1:25:06] vacation and he's trying to to track
[1:25:09] down where the doctor is on vacation and
[1:25:12] get a hold of him he's trying to find
[1:25:13] him so he calls the operator she's got
[1:25:15] his number and his address is out hello
[1:25:17] hello Betty hello
[1:25:19] um I'd like to have his number if I
[1:25:21] could I'm having a real hard time I need
[1:25:22] to talk to my doctor and she said now
[1:25:24] you know you can't have that number you
[1:25:26] know I I know Betty I know but you know
[1:25:29] there's been some confusion about things
[1:25:31] and I laugh I know this is so dumb but I
[1:25:34] laugh at that all the time because
[1:25:36] there's no confusion at all
[1:25:39] he's creating the confusion
[1:25:42] it seems there's been some confusion I'm
[1:25:44] going no there's no confusion the doctor
[1:25:46] doesn't want you
[1:25:48] he doesn't give his number out case
[1:25:50] closed but there's Betty there's been
[1:25:52] some confusion no no I'm not doing it
[1:25:54] click oh that's it it's over but I got
[1:25:56] to thinking last night
[1:25:58] sorry for laughing at that movie
[1:26:01] but I said that's the devil
[1:26:05] and that guy was creating confusion for
[1:26:09] his own benefit
[1:26:14] that's the devil why does he create
[1:26:17] confusion in your minds because he's
[1:26:20] going to get the worship and the benefit
[1:26:21] at the end he's going to defeat you and
[1:26:24] he Satan's going to get the Victory and
[1:26:26] you're going to be defeated he's doing
[1:26:27] it for his own agenda
[1:26:32] but you need to be like that secretary
[1:26:34] that operator and that doctor says no
[1:26:36] the rules are still the same you can't
[1:26:39] get my number when I'm on vacation you
[1:26:42] can't have it there is no confusion I
[1:26:45] don't talk to you and you don't talk to
[1:26:48] me when I'm resting in the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] when I'm on a vacation through the
[1:26:54] Millennium in the Holy Ghost can you say
[1:26:57] Amen
[1:26:59] praise the Lord I love when the Lord
[1:27:01] brings things that's not in my notes
[1:27:04] isn't that the whole isn't that the Holy
[1:27:06] Ghost is it an arrest
[1:27:08] isn't it the ultimate vacation from the
[1:27:10] works
[1:27:11] that you try to work your way into
[1:27:13] heaven the Holy Ghost is that come unto
[1:27:15] me all you that are weary and heavy
[1:27:17] laden from all your Works trying to gain
[1:27:19] entrance into heaven and I will give you
[1:27:21] the comforter I will give you rest rest
[1:27:24] in my finished work at Calvary the work
[1:27:26] has been done follow me obey it be
[1:27:28] obedient to me and rest in me but I made
[1:27:31] a mistake quickly bring it under the
[1:27:33] blood of Jesus Christ and get back to
[1:27:35] your rest
[1:27:40] Satan there there is no confusion you're
[1:27:43] trying to create confusion and there is
[1:27:45] no confusion
[1:27:46] you don't have my number when I'm on
[1:27:48] vacation and you're not going to get it
[1:28:00] praise the Lord he makes confusion when
[1:28:02] there's none to get what he wants to
[1:28:05] bother you to bother the doctor that's
[1:28:07] the devil
[1:28:08] the service this service here today will
[1:28:10] just be some foundations of course
[1:28:13] but I trust that you're listening I
[1:28:15] haven't even got into the Holy Ghost yet
[1:28:17] much but I these are foundations and the
[1:28:20] foundation today is that be aware
[1:28:23] that this thing that you're seeking or
[1:28:25] that you have will be one of the worst
[1:28:28] things that Satan tries to confuse in
[1:28:31] your mind
[1:28:33] you must be aware of that
[1:28:36] this is the subject this is the thing
[1:28:38] and even in our ranks I believe
[1:28:40] sometimes Satan is working to try to
[1:28:42] confuse it but right along it's the true
[1:28:45] Holy Spirit change in lives but it makes
[1:28:48] it confusing for some young people and
[1:28:50] someone I get different things I could
[1:28:52] get people changed and then I get people
[1:28:53] confused about certain things that's
[1:28:56] because the enemy Works Among Us
[1:28:58] sometimes
[1:29:01] Satan in the beginning playing with
[1:29:03] Eve's mind from the Simplicity of the
[1:29:05] believing the promise Satan at the end
[1:29:07] right now is playing with the people's
[1:29:09] minds and their thinking taking us from
[1:29:11] the Simplicity of Christ I fear that he
[1:29:14] is doing the same thing now friends in
[1:29:16] the last days but you're you've got to
[1:29:19] find your rest and that's in the Holy
[1:29:21] Ghost the rest is in the finished work
[1:29:24] of the Lord oh I'm going to show that
[1:29:26] it's I'm going to show through this
[1:29:28] series it's a finished work and it's
[1:29:30] it's happened in you no matter what the
[1:29:34] devil says the message is the Simplicity
[1:29:37] of Christ then
[1:29:39] the message today I believe is the
[1:29:41] Simplicity of Christ the message was
[1:29:44] never meant to be complicated
[1:29:47] and Satan has more access to complicate
[1:29:50] this message because this is the day he
[1:29:52] bursts forth with the revelation of the
[1:29:54] Seven Seals that what's in the book of
[1:29:57] Redemption all these seals Mysteries all
[1:29:59] the Mysteries I'm going to read the
[1:30:00] mysteries in the mid in a minute that
[1:30:02] God has revealed through the seventh
[1:30:04] angel when you have a day that's
[1:30:05] bursting forth with all the Mysteries
[1:30:07] then Satan has the opportunity to take
[1:30:09] those things and complicate a simple
[1:30:11] message
[1:30:12] I love my wife's testimony that she was
[1:30:14] scared to read the seal book for years
[1:30:16] and just say oh my goodness that's way
[1:30:18] out of my level she was a Christian but
[1:30:19] I'm staying away from that the ministry
[1:30:21] she was under when she grew up made it
[1:30:24] such a she had a pastor that uh you know
[1:30:27] he just got up and read quotes that's
[1:30:29] basically did the whole service and
[1:30:31] he had an altar there and he had all
[1:30:34] this quote books because he didn't have
[1:30:35] you know an iPad so he brought all the
[1:30:38] quote books and they were stacked high
[1:30:39] and he would take one he'd read a quote
[1:30:41] close it take one read another quote and
[1:30:43] that was basically his preaching that's
[1:30:44] what she grew up under well then that
[1:30:46] Minister ended up following in adultery
[1:30:47] unfortunately and so all the confidence
[1:30:49] is lost and everything and so it's the
[1:30:51] only the Holy Ghost and the grace of God
[1:30:53] that brought all of her family back into
[1:30:55] Brothers Donny's Church they got the
[1:30:57] true Holy Ghost and his love the word
[1:30:58] ever since
[1:31:00] amen
[1:31:01] but in her experience you scared to
[1:31:04] listen to the seal book and then she
[1:31:05] said I need to I'm hungry to hear what
[1:31:07] God Said So she gets into it and her
[1:31:09] testimony is that after I read the seal
[1:31:11] book it wasn't mysterious at all
[1:31:14] she said the main thing I heard in that
[1:31:16] is not just all the Mysteries revealed
[1:31:19] but I heard my name I heard my position
[1:31:22] in Christ I seen my predestinated
[1:31:25] position by reading the seal book some
[1:31:28] of you haven't read it and you go to
[1:31:30] this assembly you should you're missing
[1:31:32] out on what God sent us
[1:31:38] isn't the you know the message has
[1:31:41] become
[1:31:42] can we agree that Satan has done his
[1:31:45] work to complicate the message of this
[1:31:47] day
[1:31:54] he's done his work
[1:31:56] you know to me a child
[1:31:59] should be to be able to understand
[1:32:03] when things are presented over the
[1:32:04] pulpit
[1:32:06] two or three families here and they've
[1:32:09] moved in and it's not about me but they
[1:32:11] said one of one of the family a couple
[1:32:13] families said we started to stream you
[1:32:16] and our children started to connect with
[1:32:18] your ministry
[1:32:20] our teenager said dad I understand what
[1:32:23] he's saying
[1:32:24] and that was one of the reasons to pray
[1:32:25] about it and see you're okay because
[1:32:27] that's an important thing we can't
[1:32:29] preach this way over the head of all the
[1:32:30] young people and the children I think we
[1:32:32] should present Christ and this message
[1:32:34] that a child could understand
[1:32:39] and if I'm preaching something deep here
[1:32:40] this morning and some of them don't
[1:32:41] understand that's why brother Paul has
[1:32:43] this cup up here because they might
[1:32:45] understand this
[1:32:47] not today Satan can you say man so they
[1:32:51] catch the subject and so we should have
[1:32:53] a message that even the child could
[1:32:54] understand the devil takes us from the
[1:32:57] Simplicity that's in the word let me
[1:33:00] just say this isn't our world become
[1:33:02] complicated enough
[1:33:05] say we live in a convenient World a
[1:33:07] convenient world it's more convenient
[1:33:09] with all of our technology
[1:33:12] not for me
[1:33:14] they made us a more convenient world and
[1:33:18] they've and
[1:33:19] I remember brother Branham referring to
[1:33:22] Suzanne Wesley who had I think 17
[1:33:24] children raised them all in the
[1:33:26] admonition of the Lord got up at five
[1:33:28] and had an hour or so of prayer I don't
[1:33:30] mean to make any of you mothers feel bad
[1:33:32] but you know and then she raises all
[1:33:34] these children and most of them went on
[1:33:36] to become preachers and different things
[1:33:37] just a great influence on their lives
[1:33:39] and and so he said though that he said
[1:33:42] she had all that time for prayer and I
[1:33:44] remember Luther saying he said I've got
[1:33:46] so much to do today he got up an hour
[1:33:48] five or four or five in the morning to
[1:33:49] pray he said I've got so much to do
[1:33:51] today I'm going to have to get up an
[1:33:52] hour earlier to pray two hours because
[1:33:54] I've got so much to do
[1:33:57] but Susanna Wesley he said he said we've
[1:33:59] got she washed all those clothes for 17
[1:34:02] kids by hand on a thimble board or
[1:34:05] whatever they had
[1:34:07] we've got dishwashers we've got clothing
[1:34:10] washers and he lists all the modern
[1:34:13] inventions to make it convenient and
[1:34:15] less time to pray
[1:34:17] than ever
[1:34:20] something really weird about that
[1:34:23] it says to me that the world is becoming
[1:34:25] more complicated and not more simple
[1:34:27] the world's becoming more difficult it's
[1:34:29] not getting and so the world's becoming
[1:34:32] that way
[1:34:34] if the world is becoming more
[1:34:36] complicated then do we have to let Satan
[1:34:38] complicate our walk with Christ too
[1:34:42] is anybody listening we live in a
[1:34:46] complicated world we live in pressure we
[1:34:48] live in financial pressure how are we
[1:34:50] going to make ends meet all these other
[1:34:51] things but if it's a complicated world
[1:34:54] it's hard to make a living it's hard to
[1:34:55] put things together and you're sometimes
[1:34:57] you're worried about it what's the next
[1:34:58] step what am I going to do you need to
[1:35:00] leave those cares to the Lord but listen
[1:35:02] one thing don't let the devil complicate
[1:35:04] your walk with the Lord
[1:35:10] just leave it tell Satan to leave that
[1:35:12] alone
[1:35:14] I tend to run from things that are
[1:35:16] complicated in this world so much has
[1:35:18] become complicated we all tend to run
[1:35:21] from things that are complicated and but
[1:35:23] we're drawn to stuff that we can get a
[1:35:26] hold of and it's simple for us I think
[1:35:28] that's in human nature I think young
[1:35:30] people gravitate Sinners gravitate I was
[1:35:34] telling the brother Jared and brother
[1:35:36] Brandon in the office about a quote that
[1:35:38] I read this week and he says if we have
[1:35:40] all these things going on in church and
[1:35:41] The Sinner comes in and they don't
[1:35:43] understand Paul said that you know he
[1:35:45] said if you speak in tongues in the
[1:35:48] service and don't interpret he said
[1:35:49] those unbelievers are going to think are
[1:35:51] they mad because he can understand
[1:35:52] what's being said God speaks with
[1:35:54] understanding
[1:35:56] that's in the Bible now so it's all
[1:35:59] something and and he he quoted he says
[1:36:01] it will drive the unbeliever or this
[1:36:03] it'll drive The Sinner away when he
[1:36:06] comes and he can't understand it'll
[1:36:08] drive the center away we're not here to
[1:36:10] drive the center away we're supposed to
[1:36:13] present something simple to them that
[1:36:15] they can latch on to something that
[1:36:17] they're drawn to Simplicity if it's all
[1:36:19] complicated they just throw their hands
[1:36:21] up and say I don't understand a clue
[1:36:24] what's going on
[1:36:25] I think a lot of our environments in our
[1:36:28] ranks are that way
[1:36:31] I'm not preaching against anybody
[1:36:32] personally but I think we've made it
[1:36:34] complicated that it's hard for the
[1:36:36] center to find
[1:36:38] something to latch onto
[1:36:40] can I get more amens we need to this is
[1:36:44] a simple message
[1:36:45] they're a Hungry Heart
[1:36:48] preach the Holy Ghost preach the clarity
[1:36:50] of the word that they can get a hold of
[1:36:52] something
[1:36:54] I'd run away from stuff the company my
[1:36:56] wife got another car and I can't figure
[1:36:59] out where the the gears are because now
[1:37:01] they're putting gears in every other
[1:37:02] place in this one I said hon where's the
[1:37:04] gear I want to I want to drive this I
[1:37:07] can't find drive because they have dials
[1:37:09] now and they have it everywhere and over
[1:37:11] here and over there and so come to find
[1:37:13] out her new drive and re rewind reverse
[1:37:17] is in the stick that's supposed to be
[1:37:19] for the windshield wipers it's there
[1:37:21] that's her gears now to me that's
[1:37:23] supposed to be windshield wipers
[1:37:25] and somebody should have never changed
[1:37:27] that
[1:37:28] they complicate it's like home where's
[1:37:30] the gift she said it's up here you bring
[1:37:32] this to drive you this way for rehearse
[1:37:34] this way
[1:37:35] oh my goodness
[1:37:37] so I get that thing in the drive and one
[1:37:39] day we're driving to Columbus or
[1:37:40] somewhere we're going and I forget that
[1:37:43] that's not the windshield wiper and it
[1:37:45] starts to rain and I flip that thing
[1:37:46] down in reverse while we're going 60
[1:37:48] miles an hour
[1:37:50] and I hear a sound out of it
[1:37:54] and I hear a sound out of my wife too
[1:37:58] Paul
[1:38:03] Paul thankfully they must have some
[1:38:05] protection on there and I didn't destroy
[1:38:07] your car
[1:38:08] everything's complicated I can't figure
[1:38:10] out all this stuff the world is so
[1:38:12] complicated it's not simple anymore as
[1:38:14] the world advances it becomes more
[1:38:16] complex it becomes more frustrating I
[1:38:19] don't need my walk with a lore frustrate
[1:38:21] I don't need that to be frustrating
[1:38:23] I don't need the devil to be confusing
[1:38:25] me and making me doubt my walk with the
[1:38:27] Lord
[1:38:28] I want to keep it simple can you say man
[1:38:30] everything's confusing and and you know
[1:38:32] if when there's a lot of choices for
[1:38:34] something it can make it confusing we're
[1:38:36] living America we got tons of choices
[1:38:38] we've got tons of eating outputs if you
[1:38:41] go out there's tons of places that's
[1:38:43] actually bad it's actually it's
[1:38:45] laodicean
[1:38:48] it makes people soft it makes people
[1:38:50] proud can you say amen I can go into
[1:38:53] another country and go into the little
[1:38:57] grocery store and I need shampoo and
[1:38:59] there's one brand of shampoo and if you
[1:39:02] want shampoo it's real simple you buy it
[1:39:04] and you take it back it's real simple we
[1:39:07] go in Kroger and we've got a mile long
[1:39:09] aisle of just shampoos
[1:39:11] how stupid is that how confusing is that
[1:39:15] and they've got one for every one of
[1:39:18] your hairs Curly Straight a little bit
[1:39:22] straight on the ends curly you read all
[1:39:24] the labels and you're going oh my kind
[1:39:25] of like when you're in a Bible bookstore
[1:39:27] and you got the different Bibles
[1:39:30] oh my goodness the Army Bible the youth
[1:39:32] Bible the okay so the the shampoos
[1:39:34] there's all different kinds and chamfers
[1:39:37] every kind of hair I'm telling you
[1:39:39] choices like that makes people spoiled
[1:39:41] and it actually is confusion
[1:39:43] I had a guy come into an office uh
[1:39:46] office supply place and he got
[1:39:48] frustrated because he's looking for a
[1:39:49] pencil and he says can somebody show me
[1:39:51] a comment I just want a common pencil
[1:39:53] where do you find a pencil these days
[1:39:54] that's the way it is where do you find
[1:39:56] just a simple shampoo because it's a
[1:39:58] it's for everything of hair and even
[1:40:00] people with no hair
[1:40:10] brother Brian says we are living in a
[1:40:12] day of confusion I don't know if you
[1:40:13] guys have that first quote we are living
[1:40:15] in a day of confusion
[1:40:19] we're living in a day
[1:40:21] that man and women hardly know what to
[1:40:24] do
[1:40:26] everything is it seems to be in a
[1:40:28] turmoil everything it seems to be
[1:40:30] there's so many different ways to look
[1:40:34] that's Satan to do that
[1:40:37] so he's just not talking about shampoo
[1:40:38] there he's talking about even the gospel
[1:40:41] with the internet and all this there's
[1:40:43] so many different ways to look at things
[1:40:45] and you know what it brings confusion
[1:40:48] like it did the Tower of Babel how can I
[1:40:50] stop this from happening confuse their
[1:40:53] language
[1:40:55] Babylon is compute confusion and we're
[1:40:58] called out of Babylon
[1:41:00] but he says we're living in a day of
[1:41:02] confusion
[1:41:04] so many things and you get frustrated
[1:41:06] about it
[1:41:07] I could go on and on about
[1:41:09] airports that are
[1:41:13] supposed to be more convenient
[1:41:16] and better customer care and I feel like
[1:41:20] I when I go to the airport I'm doing
[1:41:21] everything now
[1:41:23] I'm putting the tag on my bag
[1:41:26] I'm getting the tickets I'm and I was
[1:41:29] I'm looking at that person up behind
[1:41:30] that desk and saying you used to do all
[1:41:32] this for me what do you do now
[1:41:36] and I did one trip I carried my bags up
[1:41:39] there I got them all ready to go and I
[1:41:40] said
[1:41:41] this was bad but I said do you want me
[1:41:43] to take them to the plane and put them
[1:41:44] up on the plane as well these bad
[1:41:48] it's a bit of sarcasm
[1:41:52] you know in in serves is this the time
[1:41:55] he shows that the last day's messenger
[1:41:57] and message is sent to clear up
[1:41:59] confusion not to create more
[1:42:02] now I'm going to read some of these
[1:42:04] these uh I'm going to read his quote
[1:42:06] first and then I'm going to read some of
[1:42:07] the Mysteries that are revealed and then
[1:42:09] I'm going to try to close it with this
[1:42:10] because I'm not getting anywhere near
[1:42:11] finishing here today
[1:42:13] now the sounding Force this messenger
[1:42:15] the seventh angel here is sounding forth
[1:42:16] his message so that laodicean church
[1:42:18] notice his type of message now it wasn't
[1:42:21] to the first Angel wasn't given that
[1:42:23] second Angel third fourth fifth sixth
[1:42:25] but it is the seventh angel that had
[1:42:27] this type of message what was it notice
[1:42:30] this type of message finishing all the
[1:42:32] mysteries of God that are written in the
[1:42:34] book so that we understand there were
[1:42:36] seven stars in his right hand Jesus in
[1:42:39] Revelations 1.
[1:42:42] he explains later in two or three that
[1:42:44] the Seven Stars are the seven Messengers
[1:42:46] he sends to the seven churches so we
[1:42:48] know they're Messengers then we
[1:42:49] understand that those were not just
[1:42:51] local churches they were throughout
[1:42:53] history and gave the characteristics of
[1:42:54] all the churches as brother raps taken
[1:42:56] us through on Wednesday nights every
[1:42:58] other Wednesday night and so then when
[1:43:00] you get the seventh one there's
[1:43:01] something specific about what he does
[1:43:03] we're in the seventh age the last age so
[1:43:05] there's to be a messenger to the seventh
[1:43:07] Age and what he does is finishing he
[1:43:09] says in the days of the voice
[1:43:10] Revelations 10 7 in the days of the
[1:43:12] voice of the Sabbath Angel when he shall
[1:43:14] begins his album The Mystery of God
[1:43:16] should be finished he doesn't say that
[1:43:18] about the fifth sixth third fourth those
[1:43:20] angels have their work throughout the
[1:43:21] ages but this seventh one he's supposed
[1:43:24] to finish all the mysteries of God that
[1:43:26] are written in the book and then brother
[1:43:27] Branham lists all the Ministries and he
[1:43:29] also takes some of these out of his
[1:43:31] Scofield bible because Schofield
[1:43:32] mentions these Mysteries that are
[1:43:34] supposed to be settled next next thing
[1:43:36] do you have that slide
[1:43:38] do you have a slide that has the
[1:43:40] mysteries on it there so here's some of
[1:43:42] these are Schofield the Kingdom of
[1:43:43] Heaven is a mystery finished by the
[1:43:45] seventh angel the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:43:47] Israel's blindness during this age we
[1:43:49] didn't understand why they were blinded
[1:43:51] now we understand it the translation of
[1:43:53] the living Saints at the end time of
[1:43:54] this age that's the Rapture the New
[1:43:57] Testament Church as one body composed of
[1:43:59] both Jews and Gentiles the church is the
[1:44:01] bride of Christ The Living Christ same
[1:44:03] yesterday today and forever Christ says
[1:44:05] the Incarnate fullness of the godhead
[1:44:07] embodied in whom is all Divine wisdom
[1:44:10] God in this is restored to man The
[1:44:12] Mystery of iniquity is settled and that
[1:44:15] Revelation is finished by the southern
[1:44:16] Angel The Seven Stars of Revelation he's
[1:44:19] actually the one that begs who their
[1:44:22] names are he's the only one qualified
[1:44:24] because the seventh angel is not just an
[1:44:26] angel but he's a prophet and it takes a
[1:44:28] prophet to settle well who's the seven
[1:44:29] measures there was hundreds of thousands
[1:44:31] of Godly men Through the Ages that God
[1:44:33] used by the Holy Ghost but he picked out
[1:44:35] seven that he's the one that placed with
[1:44:38] the seminar that are the Angels in his
[1:44:40] right hand because he had to pick the
[1:44:42] ones that were closest to the original
[1:44:44] word
[1:44:45] and didn't compromise on that word and
[1:44:48] they they believed that so he settles
[1:44:50] the Seven Stars of Revelation the
[1:44:52] mystery Babylon The Prostitute the
[1:44:54] mother of harlots he breaks that mystery
[1:44:56] because we didn't know that who that was
[1:44:57] until the end time these are Mysteries
[1:44:59] that these are all the Mysteries and not
[1:45:02] all of them but Mysteries to be finished
[1:45:03] by the seventh angel now then he goes on
[1:45:06] to say brother Brahm the next thing
[1:45:07] that's some of the Mysteries that this
[1:45:09] Angel is supposed to wind up all the
[1:45:11] mystery all the mysteries of God and the
[1:45:13] other and may I say with this with
[1:45:15] reverence and not referring to myself
[1:45:17] but referring to the angel of God the
[1:45:20] serpent seed that's been a hidden
[1:45:21] Mystery All Through The Years what
[1:45:24] happened in the Garden of Eden was to be
[1:45:26] settled by the seventh angel
[1:45:29] it's in the Bible but it was covered
[1:45:31] over with man's ideas the Jews knew who
[1:45:33] what happened in the garden right
[1:45:36] Paul knew what happened to Garden but it
[1:45:38] gets lost to church history the serpency
[1:45:40] that's been hidden Mystery the grace
[1:45:42] straightened out in the end time by the
[1:45:45] seventh amen Grace straightened out not
[1:45:46] disgrace but real true Grace because he
[1:45:49] had the one side of armenianism and then
[1:45:51] Calvinism one but so far to
[1:45:53] predestination that everybody's saved
[1:45:55] and they could smoke and drink and live
[1:45:57] any kind of life but they're
[1:45:58] predestinated that's the bad extreme
[1:46:00] form through the Church of that then you
[1:46:03] got the other extreme of just basically
[1:46:05] uh Holiness trying to get through
[1:46:08] through works of Holiness and how you
[1:46:10] dress is how you get into heaven it's
[1:46:12] the two extremes so Grace had to be
[1:46:14] straightened out not a disgrace but real
[1:46:16] true Grace seven Angel did that no such
[1:46:19] thing as Eternal burning hell you'll
[1:46:21] burn from a million years that's that's
[1:46:23] not true but anything that was eternal
[1:46:25] had never had a beginning end and hell
[1:46:27] was created all these Mysteries
[1:46:30] everybody's ears perked up now
[1:46:32] The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost without sensation
[1:46:40] but the person of Christ performing in
[1:46:43] you the same works that he did
[1:46:47] that was said perfectly that balanced it
[1:46:49] out with one sentence
[1:46:52] now I want to ask stop on that mystery
[1:46:55] and that's what the seventh angel is
[1:46:57] supposed to come and settle the mystery
[1:46:59] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:47:01] sensation
[1:47:04] why does he have to bring that up
[1:47:05] because Church systems particularly the
[1:47:08] Pentecostal denominations messed up the
[1:47:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost number one to
[1:47:13] say if you speak in tongues that's the
[1:47:15] evidence that you got it but second of
[1:47:17] all if you have one of the nine
[1:47:19] spiritual gifts working in your life if
[1:47:20] you have this happening if you speak in
[1:47:22] tongues if you do this and they start
[1:47:23] attaching all the manifestations to the
[1:47:26] evidence of the Holy Ghost without the
[1:47:28] life and it becomes if you write down
[1:47:30] the feelings if you felt that sensation
[1:47:32] you must have the Holy Ghost
[1:47:35] because of that Pentecostal Traditions
[1:47:38] attached to the word of God the seven
[1:47:40] angel had to come and balance it out and
[1:47:42] get the middle of the road receiving the
[1:47:44] bachelor's Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:47:46] she's the mystery of it but the person
[1:47:48] of Christ performing in you the same
[1:47:51] works that he did that's the baptism of
[1:47:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:47:56] in you performing the same because Jesus
[1:48:00] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:48:01] also
[1:48:03] but we're not sign Seekers
[1:48:05] we don't follow the signs the signs
[1:48:08] follow us
[1:48:09] and Pentecost follows the signs builds
[1:48:12] up the signs but we don't follow the
[1:48:14] signs but the signs do follow us we
[1:48:16] should we should say Lord let me be
[1:48:18] available let the signs follow my life
[1:48:19] but I'm going to read a quote to you a
[1:48:21] young person asked a young one in the
[1:48:24] Lord asks but do I expect that
[1:48:26] individually from my life all the time
[1:48:27] brother I said no that's to the church
[1:48:29] you're going to see that happen but as
[1:48:31] an individual we shouldn't apply that
[1:48:33] happening every day to our lives
[1:48:38] I'll read it in another sermon but I
[1:48:41] just thought I'd now look at this next
[1:48:43] statement what time is it okay
[1:48:46] next statement and now I'm going to try
[1:48:48] to close you understand where I'm going
[1:48:49] with this
[1:48:51] this mystery had to be settled too
[1:48:54] and I think people need to go back and
[1:48:55] read this
[1:48:56] and read with because this has to be
[1:48:58] balance the mystery of water baptism
[1:49:00] where the extreme trinitarianism has
[1:49:03] brought it into the titles of father now
[1:49:05] look at that look at that word extreme
[1:49:07] so now the mystery of water baptism has
[1:49:10] to be settled just like all why does all
[1:49:14] these Mysteries have to be settled and
[1:49:16] balanced by the seventh angel messenger
[1:49:19] because of that word right there extreme
[1:49:26] and even the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:30] as tender and as special a thing simple
[1:49:33] thing that is to the person that's
[1:49:36] hungry Satan takes it and he takes it to
[1:49:40] this extreme
[1:49:41] and he takes it to this extreme let me
[1:49:43] talk about denominations
[1:49:46] our precious Baptist systems not the
[1:49:48] brothers but our Precious Precious
[1:49:50] system baptism teaches when you believe
[1:49:53] then you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:49:57] so now you have to make a confession I
[1:49:58] believe Christ died for my sins not
[1:50:00] knowing the life that's changing that so
[1:50:02] now because they believe you have the
[1:50:03] Holy Ghost that's an extreme
[1:50:06] because there's no power of a life there
[1:50:08] then the Pentecostals take away to
[1:50:10] sensation and emotion and tongues that's
[1:50:12] the Other Extreme and we still have the
[1:50:15] enemy sometimes working to take the
[1:50:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost to two
[1:50:19] extremes
[1:50:21] I remember my dad being in Dayton Ohio I
[1:50:24] believe and he was at a church and I was
[1:50:27] just a teenager and this other teenager
[1:50:28] come up and talked to Dad and he was
[1:50:30] crying and he was struggling he says I
[1:50:32] just don't know if I have the Holy Ghost
[1:50:33] he said I'm just struggling and this guy
[1:50:36] stepped up to her says you believe
[1:50:37] brother Brown was a prophet don't you
[1:50:39] you believe this message he just went on
[1:50:41] to give him the drill you know and he
[1:50:42] goes well well yeah yeah I I believe I
[1:50:45] believe he's probably just so tender you
[1:50:47] know and that man said in front of my
[1:50:48] dad he said you've got the Holy Ghost if
[1:50:51] you believe he's a prophet you've got
[1:50:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:53] stop crying
[1:50:57] and my dad bowed his head and walked
[1:50:59] away because he realized we were talking
[1:51:01] 35 40 years ago
[1:51:03] in our ranks that that's how it gets
[1:51:06] presented to a heart too hungry for God
[1:51:10] and he just hung this because he wasn't
[1:51:12] in that church he couldn't help the boy
[1:51:13] further but he could have taken that
[1:51:15] tender heart and taken him on to know
[1:51:17] the Lord
[1:51:19] to know the Lord of this message
[1:51:22] you must meet the Lord of this message
[1:51:25] first is that okay with everybody it's
[1:51:28] the Christ of this message it's the
[1:51:30] power that comes in a life that we want
[1:51:32] to get the people to
[1:51:34] we're not getting them to a church can
[1:51:36] you say brother Brian said that's the
[1:51:37] problem he said I fear we're getting too
[1:51:39] many people to the church and not to
[1:51:40] Christ we must get them to Christ
[1:51:42] not some books and tapes and all that I
[1:51:44] know the word and the rev the the
[1:51:46] revelation of the message reveals more
[1:51:48] of Jesus Christ but it has to be the
[1:51:50] person revealed to you personally
[1:51:54] can't be an intellectual stimulation
[1:51:56] somehow and that's why he had to take
[1:51:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:52:00] seventh angel had to sell it because of
[1:52:01] the extremes of emotion and the extremes
[1:52:04] of intellectualism to bring it back and
[1:52:06] say here's what it is it's not it don't
[1:52:08] depend on an emotion and don't pinpend
[1:52:11] on just a few intellectually believe but
[1:52:13] seek the person of him coming in your
[1:52:15] life recreating and doing the works in
[1:52:18] your life as Jesus did
[1:52:24] Hallelujah
[1:52:26] I love him this morning God bless you
[1:52:28] let's stand I know I have to stop or
[1:52:30] I'll never stop I gotta stop
[1:52:32] praise the Lord and I hope that somehow
[1:52:34] by the grace of God
[1:52:36] that we can learn something from the
[1:52:38] Bible about what this great Holy Ghost
[1:52:41] is that you can find your experience in
[1:52:45] the word of God that you can have
[1:52:48] something you know that you know that
[1:52:50] you know and no devil can ever tell you
[1:52:54] otherwise
[1:52:56] that you could get up every morning and
[1:52:59] have coffee not with the devil in your
[1:53:02] mind but with the word of God in your
[1:53:04] mind what the word says about you what
[1:53:07] Christ says about you
[1:53:10] instead of what the devil's trying to
[1:53:12] tell you
[1:53:13] you could say not today
[1:53:15] not any day
[1:53:17] I'm not listening to those voices
[1:53:20] now how many can raise your hand before
[1:53:21] we sing and pray together how many has
[1:53:24] felt the holy spirit in the in this
[1:53:26] service today
[1:53:29] take it a little bit deeper and say how
[1:53:31] many would raise your hand and you know
[1:53:34] I I I can't articulate everything that I
[1:53:38] want to in my life but I know that God
[1:53:41] has brought his Mercy to my life in some
[1:53:44] place in my life I'm making raise your
[1:53:46] hand to that you see devil see the CW
[1:53:49] see that take your take your hands off
[1:53:51] of God's Property Satan take your hands
[1:53:54] off of God's Property
[1:53:56] God has done something and I remember
[1:53:59] the little sister came into my church
[1:54:01] her and her husband baptized if I said
[1:54:03] their name you know them they attend
[1:54:04] another church now
[1:54:06] but she went to a camp meeting and by
[1:54:08] the end of the camp meeting she was
[1:54:09] confused believe it or not I was
[1:54:11] enjoying the word everything was good
[1:54:12] but as a young Christian she was
[1:54:14] confused she says I just don't know
[1:54:16] after that preaching I don't know if I
[1:54:18] have any anything I don't know if I have
[1:54:20] the Holy Ghost and because she came to
[1:54:22] me I was her pastor I just said I said
[1:54:24] sister let's look at what God's done in
[1:54:26] the last
[1:54:27] I think it was three months in her life
[1:54:30] your husband was a Baptist you grew up
[1:54:33] Lutheran I said out of the clear blue
[1:54:34] God brings the message to you I said
[1:54:37] three months I said look at your life
[1:54:38] look at your husband's life transformed
[1:54:40] by the word Changed by the word and I
[1:54:43] went through all that God had done just
[1:54:45] in three months
[1:54:46] and she began to stop crying and she
[1:54:48] began to have a subtle look on her face
[1:54:51] my sister said I'm your pastor I've
[1:54:52] watched this firsthand do you think
[1:54:54] that's the Holy Ghost working in your
[1:54:56] life she said it has to be my husband's
[1:54:59] changed God has done something in his
[1:55:01] life I said don't you think that that
[1:55:04] same Holy Ghost that's made all these
[1:55:05] changes
[1:55:06] would not leave you hanging somehow
[1:55:08] you're missing something the same Holy
[1:55:11] Ghost that's brought you this far will
[1:55:12] give you everything if you're lacking
[1:55:14] something and if you are lacking
[1:55:16] something
[1:55:17] the same holy ghost that did that it's
[1:55:18] going to give you the rest
[1:55:20] she just settled down said praise God
[1:55:22] and she she and her husband are going on
[1:55:24] with the Lord
[1:55:26] still serving them today still loving
[1:55:28] this message and loving Christ I say

[1:57:28] going to praise the Lord anyhow I asked
[1:57:30] my daughter to sing that song with me
[1:57:32] because it has a one line in there in
[1:57:35] the lyric that says they try is speaking
[1:57:38] to the Lord he says they try to
[1:57:39] complicate what you say
[1:57:42] they try to complicate what you say
[1:57:45] but
[1:57:47] Lord your truth is what I follow
[1:57:50] it'll still be here tomorrow and what I
[1:57:53] believe is not the works of any man

[1:58:09] your experience and you have your story

[1:58:17] his Mercy touched your life
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:21] his holy spirit touched your life to
[1:58:24] make a connection with you and you all
[1:58:26] have a different story
[1:58:28] but you can raise your hand and say Lord
[1:58:31] my story is unique
[1:58:33] but I'm not looking at my past I'm
[1:58:35] thanking you for your grace and mercy
[1:58:37] that's brought me to today
[1:58:39] and whatever has brought me to today
[1:58:43] Lord I know will bring me through
[1:58:46] tomorrow

[1:58:54] just run after you and anything that I
[1:58:58] have need of you're not hold back from
[1:59:00] me
[1:59:02] as you referred Lord when you were here
[1:59:04] you referred to will a father if a son
[1:59:07] would ask something from the father
[1:59:09] wouldn't the father do everything in his
[1:59:12] power within his means to get that gift
[1:59:15] for his son and you said how much more
[1:59:19] when a child asks for the Holy Ghost
[1:59:22] will you willingly give it Lord
[1:59:25] you're not holding these things back
[1:59:27] from us Lord you're wanting to pour it
[1:59:30] upon us
[1:59:31] so Lord we place our experience not in
[1:59:33] the devil's hands we place it in your
[1:59:36] hands Lord you started it you'll finish
[1:59:38] it Lord if there's anything to purge
[1:59:41] from my life if I'm dabbling in worldly
[1:59:44] things if I'm doing something to hinder
[1:59:46] that work of the Holy Ghost forgive me
[1:59:48] Lord may I walk may you sanctify me
[1:59:51] Father take those things out of my heart
[1:59:53] my mind and if I need my desires changed
[1:59:56] then Lord so be it let it be so let my
[1:59:59] desires change

[2:00:03] I give this service to you Lord and
[2:00:05] these people to you
[2:00:07] that in the coming days there would be
[2:00:10] such a a solemn stability and anchor

[2:00:24] confusing
[2:00:25] so may we lay hold on the promise of God
[2:00:28] and rest in it may there be such a
[2:00:31] stableness

[2:01:14] hearts
