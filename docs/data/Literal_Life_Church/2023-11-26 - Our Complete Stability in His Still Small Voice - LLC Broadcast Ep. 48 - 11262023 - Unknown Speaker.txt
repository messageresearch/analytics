of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today 50 years ago today she gave her only child away to live a life easy to [Music] regret the year years went by how time has flown her days are mostly spent alone daring to remember hoping to [Music] forget [Music] this is my body broken for you for all you've been and all you've been through this is my blood and when you free the end I offer you again the body and blood oh he fought a war against his will truth be known he's fighting still he looks for Hope through narrow blood shot [Music] eyes he slips into a p pure lingers for an now to sometimes it feels better just to sit and cry a [Music] while this is my body broken for [Music] you for all you've been and all you been through this is my blood and when You' reached the end I offer you again the body and blood one by one we take the common cup we remember and we live lift it [Music] up this is my body broken just for you for all you've been and all you've been through this is my blood and when you reach the end I offer you again the body and [Music] blood this is my blood and when you you've reach the end I offer you again the body and [Music] blood First Kings 19 and we'll start reading at verse 9 we're picking up for Elijah here in the third phase of how the Lord dealt with him here and he came thither thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake now this is extremely important what's being said here because God is going to show what he is going to be in and he's also going to show what he's not in that's important especially when you have people who are thirsty to find God and thirsty to find more of God they're in a vulnerable state because we must not just seek it anywhere but we must find what God is in and what he's speaking through we could be very deceived into thinking God is in something but he must make it clear to the prophet here where God is in where God is in and he said he wasn't in the wind he was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire all these real extravagant uh flamboyant things very extreme things but he's making it clear uh I'm not in any of those and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still Small Voice and I can finish it and God is saying that's where you'll find me that's where you'll find me strange isn't it we look for big things but God says at the end this is where you're going to find me but just the capping off that I didn't get to last Sunday of this subject and we'll see where the Lord will leave from here but we want to finish this and last week I had preached on the cure for emotional and mental instability I know that seems like a strange title but uh it's very important under the the current uh climate of the hour God has chosen us to live in uh it's very important to talk about emotional instability and mental instability you say well why do I need to preach to Believers about that well uh we're the only ones I believe that we have a place that we can go to bring any instability can you say Amen we're the ones that have a place to go praise the Lord aren't you glad you raise your hand this morning we have a place to go for all of that and that's what I'm trying to point you to but to say we don't need to talk about it well that would be denying us as a human being because we are affected emotionally by things we are affected sometimes mentally by things but God has promised in his word that he'll give us uh mental stability he says I wish above all things you prosper and be in health as your soul prospers and that he would give you a sound mind he would give us a sound mind and so uh Calvary did not just provide a saving of of from sin but it also provided all things that we need to bring to him and so now in the age that we live in and I I elaborated on it last Sunday so I don't need to talk about but we explored a little bit of the cultural plague of addiction the cultural plague of addiction how many knows that we're in an age of addiction and and the addiction is usually from a lack of the reality of God in man's Soul people people are turning to addictions and come to that because they don't have God they don't have the availability or at least they're not seeking God because God is the source for our soul God is the source for our emotions and and so now we have a whole uh nation and World addicted uh by many many things they're addicted to and it's because that they have not turned to the to the answer that God has given and uh there's no sense in preaching about other people but sometimes Christians in a hard time in their life don't turn to the answer that they know is the answer they'll turn to other things to calm their nerves they'll turn to other things to kind of settle them down and they go through mental times as I read last Sunday about Elijah when he was under the juniper tree he was going through a real mental strain he was going through a depression so let's not deny who we are we can have juniper trees in our lives we can have low times in our lives and uh and so this is a reality in the hour we live in and I won't speak uh much more on those things because we we covered it last Sunday but we realize there's a thirst because we are a three-part being and because we are emotional because we have our minds and not just our souls but we have our emotions that there are things that deplete us in our spirit uh sort of if we could call it this way constant withdrawals from our emotional bank accounts and we live in a world that constantly drains us emotionally drains us mentally can you say amen and I mentioned three things that causes that and that is it can be family or domestic trouble uh it can be number two a severe trauma that's happened in your life you lose a loved one or you have something happen or someone treats you in a wrong way there's some trauma that happens to your spirit that's the second reason sometimes your spirit gets there's a withdrawal from your emotional bank and then there's family and domestic trouble well that's number one but then there's the third thing of the Demonic forces just in the next Dimension that is an increased pressure against the Bride of Jesus Christ every day in the other dimension there is forces against you as a son and daughter of God that that are always trying to and I'm going to get to it today always trying to Mis mislead you or pull you away from or cause you to lose the value of the fountain and the source for emotional stability to turn you to something else to accuse the Brethren can you say Amen most of the Christians that's in this room and Believers understand the battle that you face and it doesn't get any lighter it's stronger demonic forces are against the Bride of Jesus Christ to drain you try to drain you spiritually and even though your soul would be sealed into the kingdom of God Satan with what he's left to try to drain you emotionally to drain you mentally to to drain you spiritually can you say amen and and then we get weak and and then when we get weak we're emotionally uh uh just instable sometimes but the worst part of it is is when we turn to hundreds of other remedies for this instability that we feel the worst part of it is is we turn to other things to calm our nerves sometimes and there can be even within the circle of Believers and I could talk about many things I did last Sunday about things we even would turn to sometimes but we must be careful even something that is wholesome we must be careful that there's not a replacement in our lives for the true stability that's in the word of God my theme today is he's provided a voice within his word and that still Small Voice is our full stability in our lives that voice that word is our stability for emotional pain that word provides Ides all things needed for for mentally not feeling right can you say am man and so there's a place that God has given no matter what we've gone through and then and then I didn't get a lot of time on it last Sunday but within the circle of Believers there's one sometimes that will seek signs and they will seek Miracles and they will seek wonders and they will seek emotional highs to try to satisy their nervousness and instability I didn't figure I'd get too many amens on that one right there but you might as well talk about it is that people will turn to some emotional High even in a service and think that's the final answer but I've been serving the lord long enough to know that I can be in the greatest Sunday services and the greatest conventions can you say amen and feel so good can you say Amen but when I go home the question is is did he bring stability in your life to face the enemy the next day if it doesn't bring stability and emotional stability then we realize that it stays shallow it stays a bubble dance Christians in this hour cannot live on casual bubble dances with the Lord our experience has to be deep with the Lord our our River has to run deep can you say amen and I believe God is calling us to be a stable people a faithful people that we found the source in God to bring emotional stability mental stability can you say am man We crave the approval of others to be acknowledged you know I could go on all day talking about the emotional sometimes we meet it because we're thinking we're getting something spiritual but sometimes we're so obsessed with with image and appearance before others people in the message all this is try to fill a void of some somehow emotional void and sometimes the person has to have a position in a church or they'll just leave they have to be seen but you see you should never take a gift and you should never try to be seen to fill an emotional void in your life am I speaking the truth this morning I know this is right down where we're living but we've got to grow into stable people can you say Amen we can't lean to the approval of others and we can't live on our appearance if I can just keep my appearance in right in front of everybody then that feels no we must fill it with God's approval and God's love in our lives because I guarantee you if you keep trying to fill it with other things from Hollywood movies all the way to the approval of preachers if you're trying to fill some need in your life you will be disappointed that's Satan's kingdom can you say Amen every alternative he has is a disappointment but in God there's no disappointment there's only satisfaction there's only satisfaction and may may look sometimes it may look sometimes like God he didn't answer oh it didn't it may look like God's disappointed but God never disappoints us God will never disappoint you God will fill your needs can you say amen God will establish you God will stabilize you God will even you out can you say amen God can take whatever you brought to church this morning and God can give you a stable peaceful mind and heart to say Satan I'm going through this by the grace of God hallelujah when we find all of it we're not we are not here to fill our thirst for stability with all this with something else but we'll find all of it in the Lord in his voice and that's my theme so now I believe God's calling us to be a stable people to Express stability and consistency in an inconsistent World confidence the Bible says in Proverbs metal not with those people who are given to change don't Fellowship a lot with people that are given to change in other words from one week to the next you don't know where they stand you look at their post it's like one week they're posting something that's completely contrary to a Christian testimony and the next week they're quoting a scripture as if they're so close to God it's an age of instability don't meddle with them that are given to change and instability don't depend on the government don't depend on anybody else can you say m find your stability in the word of God and in his voice I believe it's a people that God is Raising to be confident not arrogant but confident now I'll say this when you're not a sinner because you get nervous sometimes you're a human being you're not a sinner because you get anger angry just be angry and sin not God made us who we are we get angry it's an emotion we we we get nervous we have nerves God put them in our body we just got to find something to keep them calm we got to find the Lord but we will get nervous Elijah got nervous we can't deny how God made us but it's what we choose temporal things constantly and I'm speaking to the social media generation I'm speaking to all of us who have millions of alternatives to calm our nerves excuse me from medicine all the way to the entertainments of the world we're in we're in Satan's Eden here and if I could describe it he's the God of this world and because he's the God of this world he presents things to Believers even that would be an alternative to calm our nerves and I'm not against any of it as I said last Sunday I'm not against if a medicine is helping we give God glory but give God glory and don't ever think that's your ultimate end God helps you through that then say I give God glory he's helping me because he heals through medicine he heals through music he heals through a little bit of love he heals through a little bit of caring for somebody don't you put in a box how God heals it's not just a healing life it's just not a healing God's bigger than that God can heal you right now while I'm ministering this word you're not a sinner because you get nervous but it's when we choose temporal things constantly and we never stabilize into a more faithful consistent walk with God how many want raise your hand I want a consistent walk with God I want a relationship with him that doesn't go from c meeting to c meeting consistency can you say amen God has called you for something more can you say Amen that's right it reminds me of the the pilot was in a one seat plane and he was going and flying at a certain level and he hears something in the back and he looks at the back and there's this little mouse in the back just chitter chattering and the mouse actually as he was flying and he only had one seat there he couldn't get back to the mouse he just starts to eat at some of the wiring that's running the plane he's eating it and he's he's going at and so this guy starts to sweat and get nervous he's wondering what am I going to do now I can't get to that m and if he keeps eating of this we're going down and he thought and I thought and that thing is still eating at those wires and all of a sudden he has this thought hey I can fly higher than that Mouse I'm built to fly higher than any little creature like that can I get an amen you know what he did he just went way up high until he seen that Mouse just disintegrate and fall over dead I'm here to tell you this morning as a Believer you're not called to live like the rest of the world you're not called to addictions you're not called to any addiction you need to fly higher than that God's called you to something higher not because you deserve it but because he gave it to you say you're talking about everybody else in this room I'm sorry brother and sister I'm not talking about everybody else in this room I'm talking about you you're called to something higher loneliness and feeling alone is so prevalent today especially in our teenagers can I say something about it it's not in my notes but can I say the devil taking our teenagers in their loneliness and telling them lies in their minds you don't have a friend in the world you're a part of something that's caused you to not have any more friends you're going you're different all these other lies of the enemy and he he he abuses the loneliness until they turn to other things young person listen to me if you trust me as God's servant God has never left you he'll never leave you and he will provide you the right friends you wait on the Lord he'll provide you the right husband he'll provide you the right wife you wait until you get the right one and don't let Satan take your emotional C saing for friendship and providing you with the wrong types of friends wait on the Lord and he'll renew your strength because he loves you that much don't draw your identity off of pin Pinterest or some other stupid thing on the internet get into this Bible get into this message say God show me who I am as a daughter of God it's essential that we know where God is and where to find him to get a hold of him today amen this may be so just dirt simple this morning but listen I'm telling you this because we have an enemy that I'm facing even this morning in this service that is distracting the young people and distracting even bride members to cause us to lose value of where God is in the still Small Voice to cause us to fill our lives and make it busy to we don't have time we don't sit still amen and shut out all the noise so we can hear this still Small Voice every young person every person here every person under the sound of our voice there's a lot of people there's a lot of voices there's a lot of churches there's a lot of things there's a lot of things on social media a lot of presentations of God but listen there's only one voice of Jesus Christ and and you have to say Lord let me find where that voice is let me stay close to it let me shut out the other voices we must know where God is where to find him God is good I'm pointing you to the source can you say man don't let the devil devalue the source for your life even for stability mental emotional spiritual can you say amen that's why I read that to you last Sunday in in Luke 21 he says there will be distress of Nations there will be men's Hearts failing for fear there'll be wars and rumors of wars there'll be all this distress all this pressure come on you and Jesus describes our age perfectly and then he says Heaven and Earth will pass away he says you'll watch everything pass away you watch everything crumble corruption sets up in all things no identity left knocking at our door trying to get us to accept a trans it's crazy it's Insanity can you say Amen people won't think with a sound mind anymore and we have to deal with that I'm I'm going in Home Depot I go back to get some stuff and this person comes up like this and and the way she talks I said she said can I help you and I said yes ma'am and I said ma'am to her and she gets offended cuz I really couldn't figure out what it was and in the same store 10 minutes later I go up front and I'm having a person help my wife and he's he's a nice ah he's a nice guy and he's helping us and he's polite and all that and he's helping and I said to my wife I said this man's going to help us and he starts helping he says and by the way I'm a girl I felt I I'm sorry you I didn't realize can't tell and if you could tell then they get mad at you cuz no I'm not that anymore I'm something else now brothers and sisters listen what young people listen to me trust me as your servant this is not going to get any better these are spirits they don't AR just people it's not that person they'd open their heart a little bit I'd Point them to the source of deliverance we should love them can you say Amen but this is the world we live in we're not going to get around it and it brings pressure it brings instability our spirit is troubled but thank God he says you'll W the same generation will watch Heaven and Earth pass away it'll pass away in front of your eyes but the word will stand forever he pointed to the thing in the midst of that distress he says you'll watch something that will never corrupt can you say Amen it'll never pass away it's eternally it's stable it stays the same if that's true and that's our source let's stay in it let's feed on it let's pull away from other voices I'm if you don't get anything else today stop feeding on other things and get into this word I'm holding it up before you you need your life in this word you have to feed it and eat it for you to hear the still Small Voice let the children hear it can
