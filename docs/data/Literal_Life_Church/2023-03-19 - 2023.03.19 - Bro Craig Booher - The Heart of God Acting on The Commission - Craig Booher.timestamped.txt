[1:07] beginning

[1:14] which we have looked upon
[1:17] our hands have handled
[1:20] which means felt after
[1:23] the word of life
[1:26] for the life was manifested
[1:29] that we have seen it
[1:31] and bear Witness
[1:33] and show unto you that eternal life
[1:37] which was with the father

[1:50] that ye Also may have fellowship with us
[1:54] and truly our fellowship
[1:57] is with the father and with his son
[2:00] Jesus Christ
[2:02] I would like to preach this morning on
[2:04] the heart of God and I would like to
[2:06] subtitle this morning acting upon the
[2:09] commission and if you have a need from
[2:11] the Lord let's just it just want to show
[2:14] the Lord by the raising of the hand as
[2:16] we just pray together Heavenly Father
[2:19] we certainly appreciate your spirit Lord
[2:22] that has been in these meetings we
[2:24] appreciate your word Lord and the strong
[2:27] confidence that you have placed I pray
[2:30] Lord God that you'll move amongst us one
[2:32] again once again
[2:34] and Lord as we are so needy and Lord I
[2:37] know father the meetings have been a
[2:39] real blessing for us all but we're
[2:42] asking Lord for those that need a
[2:44] breakthrough this morning Lord God that
[2:46] you would grant that I pray that you'll
[2:49] Lift Every discouraged heart I pray Lord
[2:52] God that you'll heal every broken spirit
[2:54] I pray Lord God you'll make yourself
[2:57] real to those that have never met you in
[2:59] the power of your Resurrection I pray
[3:02] Lord that you'll take over this service
[3:04] and Lord you will make yourself known
[3:06] Lord by your power stretch forth your
[3:09] hand to heal and to manifest your word
[3:12] father we welcome you we open our hearts
[3:15] we welcome you here Lord speak to us
[3:19] father we ask that you answer from
[3:21] heaven in Jesus Christ's name
[3:24] amen God bless you thank you so much you
[3:27] can have your seeds
[3:32] and brother Branham said that the Cry of
[3:34] the human heart
[3:36] in all ages
[3:39] have been to see God
[3:41] how many can say Amen
[3:44] when Moses met God in the burning bush
[3:47] he said what is your name
[3:49] that I might go back and tell Israel who
[3:52] you are you know what would you name
[3:54] yourself how would you identify yourself
[3:57] and that's when the Lord had spoken I am
[4:00] that I am
[4:02] and and brother Branham said that it
[4:04] pleases God to reveal himself
[4:07] it pleases God to show himself so when
[4:12] you're hungry for God that's the kind of
[4:14] condition you need to be in in a church
[4:16] meeting like this and God reveals
[4:19] himself in many ways in many forms he
[4:22] revealed himself in a pillar of fire he
[4:25] revealed himself in a cloud he revealed
[4:27] himself in a whirlwind he reveals
[4:30] himself in many ways but it is the same
[4:34] God every time when no matter what form
[4:37] he is in he never changes his character
[4:40] and when God revealed himself in a
[4:45] pillar of fire or a pill or a cloud God
[4:48] was not trying to reveal physical
[4:51] attributes but rather manifest his
[4:55] characteristics
[4:57] no man that say what I'm trying to
[4:59] express is it wasn't the fire that he
[5:02] wanted the people to focus on it was
[5:04] what was in the fire it wasn't the
[5:07] Whirlwind that God wanted us to look at
[5:09] it was what was in the Whirlwind
[5:13] and God has sent us a message in this
[5:15] hour and it wasn't a five-foot
[5:17] Kentuckian that God wanted us to look at
[5:20] it was God that was being revealed to
[5:23] the people
[5:24] because God is a spirit
[5:27] and no man has seen God at any time
[5:30] and so God is revealing his
[5:34] characteristics his attributes and so
[5:37] Moses cried Lord
[5:39] Show Me Your Glory
[5:41] how many hearts cry Lord Show Me Your
[5:45] Glory
[5:46] and the Lord said that you can't see me
[5:48] and live he said but he put Moses in the
[5:51] cleft of The Rock and he said when he
[5:54] passed by he saw at the offering he saw
[5:57] the back parts of a man
[6:00] and when he passed by God descended in a
[6:03] cloud and he stood there and proclaimed
[6:05] the name of the Lord and the Lord passed
[6:08] by him and proclaimed the Lord God
[6:10] merciful and gracious and long-suffering
[6:15] Hallelujah an abundant in Mercy and
[6:19] Grace and goodness and Truth keeping
[6:22] Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity
[6:26] and transgression and sin Hallelujah but
[6:30] by no means clearing the guilty
[6:34] see God was revealing what was in him
[6:38] God's morphe he changes his mask from
[6:42] one form to another but yet his
[6:45] character is the same
[6:48] and the Bible said that Spirit became
[6:52] flesh
[6:54] and that's what John said that which was
[6:57] from the beginning our eyes have seen it
[6:59] we have looked upon and our hands have
[7:02] handled him we have felt him the word of
[7:06] life
[7:08] see God had to become flesh
[7:12] in order to pay our penalty
[7:15] the spirit God the Eternal one who never
[7:18] had a beginning or an end had to change
[7:22] his form to pay our penalty for sin
[7:26] now our minds are finite meaning they're
[7:30] limited and God can only reveal so much
[7:33] to us because there's only so much we
[7:36] can comprehend
[7:38] like I've I'm sure that every one of you
[7:40] have tried to think of living forever
[7:42] your mind can't even do it eventually
[7:45] you come to an end you can't imagine
[7:48] what it would be to live forever and
[7:51] ever see so God reveals himself in
[7:54] little pieces to us so our peanut brains
[7:57] don't pop
[8:01] see so God revealed himself in the
[8:03] pillar of fire and then the Whirlwind
[8:05] and theophories and in the prophets in
[8:07] Abraham and in Joshua and David God is
[8:10] revealed in those characters
[8:13] but then God revealed his fullness in
[8:17] Jesus Christ which was the expression of
[8:21] God to man
[8:24] can you say Amen
[8:26] the Bible said no man has seen God at
[8:29] any time but the son has declared him
[8:33] the Bible said that Jesus was the
[8:36] express image of God's person
[8:40] he was the expression of the word
[8:45] he was the expression of all that God is
[8:50] Hallelujah
[8:52] and we can understand him when he became
[8:55] one of us
[8:56] I want you to think of that now
[8:59] brother Branham you know we know that he
[9:03] revealed the mind of God in this age
[9:06] but today I don't want to talk about the
[9:08] back parts of God's mind I want to talk
[9:11] about God's heart
[9:13] because God brother Branham said I used
[9:15] to think God was angry with me and that
[9:18] his son loved me and then I learned that
[9:20] Jesus was the very heart of God
[9:28] he was manifesting God's nature and his
[9:31] love
[9:32] that's why I said when you see me you
[9:36] see the father
[9:38] Hallelujah
[9:40] and now a man's Works declare his
[9:43] character
[9:44] no matter what you say your Works tell
[9:48] you who you are
[9:50] right isn't that right and so Christ
[9:53] declared God's character by his Works he
[9:57] said if you don't believe me believe the
[10:00] works for they testify
[10:04] now Jesus was the expression of God's
[10:09] heart to man
[10:12] and he expressed it in so many ways
[10:15] because human beings you know he we have
[10:18] certain ways so contrary to God
[10:22] and they found a little Harlot woman
[10:24] caught in the very Act of adultery
[10:27] and you would look at her and you'd
[10:29] criticize her and say you know how many
[10:31] families have you busted up what a vile
[10:34] woman you are they pulled up stones and
[10:37] they were going to Stone her according
[10:39] to the law of Moses and Jesus was in the
[10:42] right place at the right time
[10:46] I believe God's timing is perfect and I
[10:49] believe everyone in this building is not
[10:52] here by chance but it is the right place
[10:55] and the right time
[10:58] and everyone's attention like wolves was
[11:01] going to destroy this woman and Jesus
[11:04] caught their attention and he was a he
[11:06] was a high profile figure and they said
[11:10] now what do you say we do with this
[11:13] woman
[11:13] you're unorthodox in all your ways
[11:19] and he said what does your law say they
[11:22] said stoner
[11:24] and Jesus says something amazing
[11:27] he said those without sin cast the first
[11:30] stone
[11:34] see sin is not drinking and smoking pot
[11:37] and and crousing and committing adultery
[11:40] that's the fruits of sin sin is unbelief
[11:45] and the Pharisees were not guilty of
[11:48] carousing and drinking but they were
[11:51] unbelievers
[11:55] and that's what condemned them
[11:59] and one by one the spirit began to
[12:02] convict them and they dropped their
[12:04] stones
[12:06] I wonder what God made them remember
[12:09] he knelt down and began to ride in the
[12:12] sand we have no idea what he wrote but I
[12:15] wonder what happened
[12:17] to make them so condemned that they
[12:21] dropped their rocks and walked away
[12:25] and he looked at the woman he said woman
[12:27] where are your accusers
[12:30] she said I have none
[12:34] he said neither do I accuse thee
[12:38] go sin no more
[12:40] he gave he's a god of Second Chances
[12:44] you don't have to be defeated all your
[12:46] life because you made mistakes he is the
[12:49] god of Second Chances
[12:51] but you're gonna have to reach out and
[12:53] take a hold of the long arm of his grace
[13:00] it was God's heart that done that
[13:04] the woman was guilty and you and I are
[13:07] guilty
[13:08] but it's the heart of God that is
[13:10] reaching for us
[13:13] Hallelujah
[13:15] I think of the the man that was the
[13:19] Bible said that he's he had um
[13:22] he was a leper
[13:24] and back then they were totally outcast
[13:28] totally rejected
[13:30] and from society I mean they thought it
[13:33] was contagious so they were ousted from
[13:35] Israel and they lived his lepers they'd
[13:38] throw to him moldy bread and so they
[13:41] can't be touched
[13:43] they can't be loved
[13:45] and people are repulsed by them it's a
[13:48] type of sin
[13:50] and they had to cry uncleared I cleaned
[13:55] and let everyone know
[13:58] that they were a leper
[14:00] and when nobody would have anything to
[14:03] do with them
[14:04] Jesus passing by a leper looked at him
[14:07] and began to cry said what do you need
[14:11] I want to be clean
[14:14] and there's many a people that can put
[14:16] on a religious show but their heart is
[14:18] leprous and their life cries unclean
[14:21] unclean unclean
[14:25] but if the Lord was manifested in a
[14:28] physical body this morning and he would
[14:30] say what would you have
[14:33] would you be as smart as that leper it
[14:36] says I want to be cleaned
[14:39] I want my heart clean before God's
[14:44] he did not fear him he touched him and I
[14:47] often think what it felt like for a man
[14:50] who have not felt physical touch in
[14:52] years when he touched him
[14:58] when he would take a person that's just
[15:01] totally Outcast and take him in his arms
[15:05] and he speaks the word be clean
[15:10] and he was healed at that moment
[15:14] that was the heart of God
[15:18] it wasn't the doctrine that made him God
[15:22] it wasn't the church that made him God
[15:25] it was the heart the works the
[15:28] expression of God's love
[15:31] he cared for those that could not help
[15:34] themselves
[15:37] I'm talking about God the revelation of
[15:40] God
[15:41] because every one of us are like that
[15:43] leper
[15:45] every one of us is like that woman
[15:47] caught in adultery I believe I'm
[15:49] Sanctified living I believe in a holy
[15:51] life and I believe God gives us the
[15:53] power to do it but every one of us at
[15:55] one time was like that leper
[15:59] and when God speaks me clean he'll take
[16:02] your heart he'll overhaul it
[16:05] he'll cleanse your heart he'll cleanse
[16:07] your mind he'll cleanse your life
[16:10] there is a power in this gospel
[16:17] God didn't come down from heaven and
[16:20] hang on a cross so the church would be
[16:22] reduced to Doctrine
[16:27] he gave his life
[16:30] that you could come out of the pit of
[16:32] despair and your helpless condition and
[16:36] make you alive again
[16:39] he takes the dead and makes them live he
[16:42] takes the Blind and makes them see
[16:47] how many believe in that kind of gospel
[16:52] when Adam had sinned Adam had covered
[16:55] himself with a fig Leaf to hide from God
[16:57] God did not accept it
[17:00] brother Benham said because botany life
[17:03] can't have no feeling
[17:07] but when God sacrificed the lamb
[17:10] it bleeded
[17:12] it bleeded it shook
[17:16] and it died
[17:18] bearing the sins
[17:21] it was something that had feeling in it
[17:25] and I believe our word Our Gospel that
[17:28] we believe in ought to have feeling in
[17:30] it and I believe our meetings ought to
[17:33] have feeling in it
[17:36] then we've got to put something in in
[17:38] order to get something out
[17:43] Heaven Ain't gonna be full of statues
[17:47] Heaven is going to be a living breathing
[17:50] holy Society a civilization of faith
[17:54] [Applause]
[17:57] I don't want fig leaves I want to come
[18:00] Redemption by Blood
[18:03] I want a religion with Felix
[18:09] that's why the Bible said he can be
[18:11] touched
[18:12] stay touched
[18:14] he can be touched
[18:17] by the feeling
[18:20] God knows your sorrows
[18:23] he can be touched by your heart
[18:26] we serve a God that wants to embrace
[18:31] he wants to embrace you take God in his
[18:34] word
[18:39] touch means a place
[18:42] to put oneself in someone else's shoes
[18:47] it means to have compassion
[18:50] and the Bible said God became a man
[18:54] and he suffered
[18:56] he said God could not suffer in the
[18:58] spirit so he become flesh to feel the
[19:02] pain of sickness
[19:04] feel the temptation to feel the
[19:08] temptation of want
[19:10] to feel the temptation of hunger and to
[19:14] feel the power of death
[19:16] that he might take it upon himself
[19:20] and be the right kind of intercessor
[19:27] Hallelujah he bore our infirmities
[19:38] he carried it brother Branham said he
[19:40] said on a rock after a healing campaign
[19:41] and he grown with headache
[19:45] the only way
[19:48] and I'm quoting the prophet the only way
[19:51] God can be expressed
[19:54] it's through love
[19:58] God did not express himself through
[20:00] popular movements
[20:02] he had no place to lay his head no
[20:05] shining movement he did not express
[20:06] himself in Doctrine
[20:09] the only way God can reveal himself
[20:14] it's through love
[20:17] the Bible tells us that he suffered
[20:20] being able to sakower or sympathize with
[20:24] those that are tempted
[20:27] he knows our ups and our Downs our ends
[20:31] and our outs and your Temptation gets so
[20:34] great you can hardly stand it he knows
[20:38] how to sympathize with you
[20:41] he said sir he loves you he'll come
[20:43] after you he'll knock on your heart
[20:46] every backslider in the building he's
[20:49] coming after you he's knocking on your
[20:52] heart he's trying to make himself real
[20:54] to you
[20:57] his love to every Mortal on the face of
[21:01] the Earth it could not be expressed God
[21:05] became flesh that he may feel
[21:12] compassion
[21:13] is feeling for others
[21:16] it is of the Lord's mercies that we're
[21:19] not consumed
[21:21] and that his compassions faileth not
[21:25] how many knows that God reveals himself
[21:28] in compassion
[21:30] and when he when he loosed Israel from
[21:34] their bondage it was an expression of
[21:37] the attribute of God of compassion
[21:40] when he hung on the cross to loose the
[21:44] human race it was an expression of God's
[21:47] compassion
[21:51] I'm talking about who God is today
[21:54] the Bible said Jesus went forth and saw
[21:56] the multitude and he was moved with
[22:00] compassion and healed their sick
[22:07] so this is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[22:11] but when Jesus died and raised again he
[22:14] had Sanctified a church
[22:16] that he may continue his work
[22:27] so the love that flowed from God
[22:31] came down on the day of Pentecost
[22:35] and it was the love of God that flowed
[22:38] from Pentecost
[22:41] and it started right away at the gator
[22:43] beautiful when Peter who at one time
[22:46] wanted to call fire down on a city that
[22:49] would not accept them
[22:51] he was walking by the gate of beautiful
[22:54] and he sees a man who was born from his
[22:57] mother's womb a crippled
[23:02] and the Bible said they made eye contact
[23:05] alums for the poor
[23:08] arms for the poor
[23:11] and Peter looked and when he made eye
[23:13] contact you you've seen that they're
[23:15] like oh goody goody I got a soft heart
[23:18] and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[23:21] None
[23:22] no not one of you guys again
[23:26] but such as I have
[23:29] give I Thee
[23:31] he grabbed a hold of him
[23:34] he was a copper wire of the love of God
[23:36] he was a conductor of the compassion of
[23:40] God and the power of God fell through
[23:43] Peter and lifted that man who never
[23:46] walked on his legs
[23:50] and he went leaping and praising God
[23:54] give God a chance let the electric power
[23:58] of God fall in your heart
[24:00] and see if I don't send you rejoicing
[24:03] from your sins
[24:08] Peter not so much as even prayed over
[24:11] him
[24:14] because Peter had a commission
[24:16] and brother Brenham said the compassion
[24:19] that was in Christ is now in the heart
[24:22] of Peter
[24:26] and he didn't have to pray
[24:28] he was commissioned
[24:32] this was the commission
[24:35] of the church
[24:37] is to bring my love into the world
[24:41] foreign
[24:52] Jesus looked over
[24:54] at the people they were like sheep not
[24:56] having a shepherd
[24:58] and the Bible said he had compassion
[25:01] upon them
[25:03] and he said you pray
[25:05] that God will send laborers into the
[25:07] Harvest
[25:09] and you know that that very next chapter
[25:12] the Bible said was the first commission
[25:14] he called his twelve and he gave them
[25:17] power over unclean spirits and to heal
[25:20] the sick and to cast out devils
[25:25] see the compassion of God was raising up
[25:29] a church that would carry on his heart
[25:36] the very last words that came off our
[25:40] Lord's lips
[25:42] because you shall lay your hands upon
[25:44] the sick
[25:46] and they shall recover
[25:52] that was the last Commission
[25:55] I Marvel at the heart of God
[25:58] when you really know you can never know
[26:02] God till you know his character
[26:04] because you can interpret the Bible a
[26:06] million ways but you must know his
[26:09] character
[26:10] brother random said it direct quote that
[26:12] God opened the seals to reveal his
[26:15] character and nature
[26:17] that's why his meetings was Deliverance
[26:20] and healing is because it was the heart
[26:23] of God the gospel
[26:26] many people use the Bible to wage war
[26:29] against others and to cut others down
[26:32] that's not God's business it's the
[26:34] devil's business
[26:35] [Music]
[26:37] Jesus did not waste his time in the
[26:40] synagogues he was out bringing salvation
[26:43] to a people that wanted it
[26:48] it was for the Pharisees if they wanted
[26:50] it
[26:52] for the hungry
[26:54] Jesus said I did not they said why you
[26:57] eat with Sinners he said I I have not
[27:00] come to heal those that are well
[27:03] see they did not know their own need
[27:08] see but it was the harlots and the tax
[27:12] collectors they knew their need
[27:14] they knew they were unworthy
[27:17] they knew they wanted something real and
[27:20] something that the Pharisees could not
[27:21] give them
[27:24] so they were swarming around him
[27:27] the sick were coming to him he was like
[27:29] like bugs on a light
[27:32] but everyone that touched that light was
[27:35] changed
[27:36] and rivers of virtue was flowing from
[27:40] him
[27:41] they didn't need a long a council
[27:44] meeting all they had to do was touch and
[27:47] they were changed we don't need a long
[27:50] service just let God pass through this
[27:52] building and all you got to do is touch
[27:54] it
[27:57] just say Lord come thy my way
[27:59] come by my way and just touch him as he
[28:02] passes by
[28:06] change your thinking it'll change your
[28:09] attitude it'll change your perspective
[28:12] it'll change your heart
[28:18] brother Branham said rivers of virtue
[28:20] flowed from him
[28:22] but then he poured his Spirit back into
[28:25] the church and brother Branham said
[28:27] rivers of virtue ought to flow from the
[28:30] body of Christ
[28:37] you can over emphasize and under
[28:39] emphasize anything
[28:41] but we're talking about the true
[28:43] Revelation the word was made manifest
[28:46] and we felt
[28:50] we touched him
[28:53] I touched him
[28:56] I knew him
[28:58] as a man knows his friend
[29:04] this is the purpose
[29:06] of the great spirit becoming flesh
[29:12] God has commissioned this church
[29:15] to open the prison doors
[29:21] he commanded he said he said the works
[29:23] that I do you shall do also and these
[29:25] signs shall follow them that believe
[29:30] now brother Branham said we have not
[29:32] done
[29:33] what he commanded us to do
[29:37] he said we have done everything but what
[29:39] he told us
[29:40] he never told us to build hospitals
[29:43] he never said build schools
[29:46] he said we have taken another road
[29:49] he said he never said build seminaries
[29:52] he said preach the gospel heal the sick
[29:56] cast out Devils freely you have received
[29:59] freely give
[30:01] he said we have adopted schools and
[30:03] education and emotions
[30:06] and denominations has brought barriers
[30:12] and Jesus gave the church power
[30:16] he said but we're afraid to act
[30:19] opponent
[30:23] back around 1958 brother Branham
[30:27] he had got a phone call
[30:29] from a Mexican man from California
[30:32] and his baby was it was just an infant
[30:35] he was dying of cancer and he asked if
[30:37] brother Brandon would come and brother
[30:39] Branham said that he he was just Divine
[30:41] Providence he picked up the phone and
[30:43] the spirit of the Lord said go
[30:47] and he said my baby's not yet four
[30:49] months and it's dying with cancer
[30:52] something told him to go and he he went
[30:54] there he said the man had little
[30:56] finished wife very sweet woman
[30:59] and he said he went to the hospital
[31:01] he said nurses were there the child was
[31:04] four months old malignant tumors over
[31:06] the Jaws he said it swole way out
[31:09] and he said the doctors tried to operate
[31:12] and they cut deep scars all over the
[31:14] child and he said it it run up its into
[31:17] its tongue the cancer
[31:19] and he said the tongue was you know
[31:21] sticking out of its mouth swollen he
[31:24] said it had turned black and he said it
[31:26] shut off its breathing from its nostrils
[31:29] and the swelling and he said so they had
[31:31] to cut a hole in its throat and he said
[31:33] it was a little whistle he called it him
[31:35] he said it was in little splints and he
[31:38] said he was sitting there they were
[31:39] draining the cancer out of it and he
[31:42] said we went to the bed and his daddy
[31:44] said Ricky your daddy's little boy
[31:48] and he said the little baby hurt his
[31:50] daddy's voice and he he got excited even
[31:52] in that condition by knowing his daddy's
[31:55] voice he got excited
[31:57] and brother Branham looked at it and
[31:59] said God how could you stand it
[32:04] he said I can't believe
[32:07] that you could sit and enjoy something
[32:09] like this
[32:11] and he goes Lord what would you do the
[32:15] Fountain of all Mercy what would you do
[32:18] if you were here
[32:21] he said they had a wrap around its head
[32:23] because they didn't want his head to
[32:25] split open
[32:29] he said Lord what would you do
[32:31] everybody listening
[32:33] amen he said something spoke to me
[32:37] and said but I'm waiting to see what you
[32:39] will do
[32:41] for I have given Authority
[32:44] to my church
[32:48] he said what will you do with my word
[32:54] brother Branham said yes Lord
[32:57] you have commissioned your church
[33:01] he said I he said I prayed over the baby
[33:03] and said I place the blood of Jesus
[33:06] Christ between Satan and this child
[33:10] and he said I pray over it in the name
[33:13] of Jesus Christ and within a few minutes
[33:15] the swelling started going down and God
[33:19] delivered that baby completely
[33:24] he didn't need a vision
[33:27] he didn't need a lightning Flash
[33:30] he needed to act upon the commission
[33:33] that God had given him
[33:39] the word commission means the act of
[33:41] committing
[33:43] or entrusting a sacred charge or Duty
[33:47] that God has given us a duty
[33:51] and he is looking for us to fulfill what
[33:55] he told us to do
[34:01] God sent the church to bring Deliverance
[34:03] to the captives
[34:06] and brother Branham said you've got to
[34:08] act you've got to do something he said
[34:11] now when you will take God in his
[34:14] promise and know that it's God's promise
[34:17] and act upon it you will see the mighty
[34:20] miracles of god return back to the
[34:23] Church of the Living God
[34:25] go ye into all the world and preach the
[34:29] gospel and act upon your commission
[34:34] these signs shall follow
[34:36] them that believe
[34:39] God is waiting for us
[34:42] to take the gospel into the world he
[34:44] said in Matthew 24 I think verse 14 he
[34:47] said my gospel shall go all around the
[34:50] world and then the end shall come
[34:52] brother Branham said the end cannot come
[34:55] until we do what God commanded us to do
[34:58] go into all the world and preach the
[35:01] gospel to Every Creature we are waiting
[35:04] on God and God is waiting on us to do
[35:08] what he told us to
[35:12] he's longing to return
[35:15] he said but he's depending upon his
[35:18] church
[35:23] brother Brenham said it's actually God's
[35:25] heart
[35:26] that is pulsating in his church
[35:30] this church ought to feel the heartthrob
[35:32] of God for a world that's dying a world
[35:35] that's collapsing a world that's blind
[35:38] and naked and don't know it and God's
[35:40] heart is still beating while there's
[35:42] blood on The Mercy Seat this church
[35:44] ought to be the very heartbeat of God
[35:47] for the lost and the sick and the dog
[35:56] The Works that I do
[36:00] ye shall do also
[36:02] he said now that's Healing The Sick
[36:04] raising the dead opening the eyes of the
[36:08] blind
[36:09] he said you'll do these things if you
[36:11] believe me
[36:13] he said but not only heal the Sick by
[36:16] prayer and cast out Devils but impart
[36:20] eternal life
[36:25] the Holy Ghost is coming and given into
[36:29] the hands of the church to impart that's
[36:32] what Calvary meant
[36:35] took and stooped to men and women and
[36:38] lifted them the Sons and Daughters of
[36:40] God and imparted Life to them
[36:45] wow
[36:46] wow
[36:49] Hallelujah
[36:53] Luke chapter 10 you'll see Jesus
[36:55] commanded the seventy to go out and he
[36:58] was teaching them how to go out and
[37:00] preach the gospel and it was in that
[37:02] chapter
[37:03] that a religious man come and said
[37:05] Master how can I have eternal life he
[37:09] said what does he said love thy God with
[37:11] all thy heart and all thy soul and all
[37:13] thy might and you live he said
[37:17] and love your neighbors yourself
[37:20] and he said on this you'll live
[37:22] he said and you know to justify himself
[37:25] in a religious manner
[37:27] but who
[37:29] is my neighbor
[37:31] and Jesus went right into a parable
[37:35] he said there was a man
[37:37] that was traveling from Jerusalem
[37:40] to to Jericho
[37:43] now Jerusalem was on a mountain
[37:45] and Jericho was in the valley and you
[37:48] know if you know your Bible said Jericho
[37:50] was a cursed City
[37:52] so this man was on a road from top to
[37:55] bottom from glory to a curse he was
[37:58] backsliding
[38:00] and brother Branham said the road
[38:02] between Jerusalem and Jericho represents
[38:05] the road to hell
[38:07] and this man was backsliding from
[38:10] Jerusalem and in his journey he got
[38:14] robbed and beaten by thieves
[38:18] and he said that the man was laying
[38:20] there and he said rest ashore if you go
[38:23] on that road from Jerusalem to Jericho
[38:25] you will meet them
[38:30] the man sitting there were just twitters
[38:32] and jitters
[38:36] and here comes a priest
[38:38] and the priest is whistling having a
[38:40] good day on his breakfast with the Brit
[38:42] bishop and he sees him and he goes
[38:45] he tiptoed across the other side and he
[38:47] went around him
[38:51] then come a levite
[38:53] he was on his way to choir practice
[38:56] and he's seen him and he he moved over
[38:59] to the other side of the street
[39:02] then come a Samaritan now this Samaritan
[39:05] is not a part of our church
[39:08] no they they'd act like they have the
[39:11] same God we do but you know this
[39:14] Samaritan is really not you don't waste
[39:16] your time with Samaritans
[39:18] but this man
[39:20] he didn't cross the street
[39:23] the Bible said he looked upon him
[39:25] and had compassion
[39:30] and the man run to his Aid
[39:33] even in a backslidden state
[39:36] even on his wrong his Road the wrong way
[39:39] he went there and he had compassion for
[39:43] that man
[39:44] now the man is laying there beaten by
[39:47] thieves the Bible said he was half dead
[39:50] that means that you are dead spiritually
[39:53] but you're still alive there are many
[39:55] people in the church that are that
[39:57] conditioned they're half dead
[40:03] and the Bible said he went to him and he
[40:05] began to pour oil and wine into his
[40:08] wounds he started a healing campaign
[40:14] he begins to minister to that man he
[40:17] began to to pour in help with that man
[40:21] the Bible said that he laid him upon his
[40:24] own Beast
[40:25] and he brought him down to the end
[40:29] and it was there
[40:30] The Innkeeper was to watch over him and
[40:33] brother Branham said he gave two pence
[40:35] which represented salvation and healing
[40:40] and said if there's anything else that
[40:43] he needs the Holy Ghost is going to
[40:45] supply it
[40:47] he said the end was the church
[40:51] that we catch the people out on the
[40:53] streets and in backslidden conditions
[40:55] and along the highways and God has a
[40:59] church somewhere that he has
[41:01] predestinated to be a hospital
[41:04] to be a place where God can bring
[41:07] healing to the body and the soul and the
[41:11] spirit
[41:15] a place of man can revive
[41:19] a place a man can come back from the
[41:22] dead
[41:23] and get a new start in life
[41:26] a place that a young person can meet God
[41:29] and change them in the power of his
[41:31] resurrection
[41:35] I believe that's what our church ought
[41:36] to be
[41:37] I believe they're not to to be anything
[41:40] else but houses of the Great Commission
[41:43] that sends lied out into a dark world
[41:47] and that even in the presence of God
[41:50] people will be changed since that I have
[41:52] never seen anything like that
[41:56] years ago I was preaching at a church
[41:58] and somehow it happened a lot back in
[42:01] those days I had I had a man in my car I
[42:03] didn't know him I don't even know how he
[42:05] ended up with me and I was going to
[42:07] preach a meeting
[42:08] and uh his brother brother Ray's
[42:12] I was a young evangelist then
[42:14] and uh I brought him to the meeting I
[42:17] don't know him from Adam
[42:19] and it was just a special meeting the
[42:21] Lord just poured himself
[42:23] the man hopped in my car we're driving
[42:25] an hour and a half back to Defiance
[42:28] he said I have done everything there is
[42:30] to do
[42:31] but I have never felt what I felt in
[42:34] that building
[42:35] I said that was the Holy Spirit
[42:39] I never seen him again I dropped him off
[42:41] and I never seen him again
[42:43] but the spirit of God Is A Healer
[42:47] the spirit of God is our living reality
[42:51] and I believe that we should not just
[42:53] push the back slit away
[42:55] but try to bring him to the hospital
[42:58] and I I believe that it more than words
[43:00] I believe those are the kind that God is
[43:04] seeking to men he he a physician don't
[43:07] look for someone healthy a physician
[43:09] needs a job
[43:11] and we give God a good employment by all
[43:15] the headaches and Sorrows we bring
[43:18] but he is a good physician and there is
[43:21] nothing too hard for God there's no
[43:23] addiction
[43:24] there's no devil that is too big God can
[43:28] heal it
[43:29] God can heal drug addicts heroin addicts
[43:33] people that have given up God Is Bigger
[43:37] yeah God Is Bigger Than every devil that
[43:40] holds people bound
[43:46] God Saves hippies
[43:49] people that are hopeless
[43:54] you know there's worse Devils than that
[43:56] brother Branham said the worst devil
[43:58] there is is a religious one
[44:01] and God cares for them too
[44:04] God would love to heal that man that is
[44:07] self-righteous and right in his own eyes
[44:09] and and criticize it sometimes the
[44:12] people that claim to be the most
[44:13] spiritual are the most shallow human
[44:15] beings on the face of the Earth
[44:19] but God wants to heal us
[44:24] a lot of times that's just a lie to make
[44:26] yourself feel that you're Justified just
[44:28] like that man but who is my neighbor
[44:33] and when it came down to expressing The
[44:35] Compassion of Christ they're dodging the
[44:37] issue
[44:43] God has raised up the church
[44:46] to be a Powerhouse
[44:48] that will heal the sick
[44:50] that will heal the spirit that will heal
[44:53] the broken heart that amend the
[44:55] confusion of mind
[44:58] that'll take the people that have lost
[45:00] their confidence in the church and
[45:02] restore it to a true faith in God
[45:09] I realize I'm the righteous or as bold
[45:11] as a lion I know that I'm anointed by
[45:13] the tribe of Judah right now but may it
[45:15] find its place in your heart
[45:19] brother Branham said we ought to live in
[45:22] a consoling atmosphere
[45:25] that people love to be around
[45:28] love is a powerful thing
[45:32] we got this little puppy named Curly
[45:33] bear
[45:34] I mean it literally thrives on love
[45:37] it's like can't you get enough
[45:41] well can you
[45:43] can you get enough
[45:45] the Lord wants us to be that way
[45:47] I can't wait to get to church streaming
[45:50] don't do it for me I've got to get into
[45:53] the presence of God
[45:55] I want in the presence of my people
[45:58] I want to be in presence of the king the
[46:00] Healer
[46:02] Hallelujah
[46:05] and you that have children you know that
[46:08] you keep Band-Aids in stock
[46:10] because at any time they're going to
[46:12] skin knees they're going to skin elbows
[46:14] so it's not I was healed when I was
[46:16] saved every day we need a physician
[46:20] we need Neosporin
[46:22] because we get in bumps and bruises and
[46:25] we get in Things We Don't Belong you
[46:27] just come to Daddy's house he'll put
[46:29] neurosporin on it and he'll cover it up
[46:31] he'll slap you on the bottom and say get
[46:32] back out and play
[46:37] amen how many appreciate our Lord
[46:40] the Bible said he makes Angel spirits
[46:43] and flames of fire ministering Spirits
[46:47] or Angels they're angels for guidance
[46:50] and protection and brother Branham said
[46:53] when you receive the Holy Spirit God
[46:56] places you in a body as a ministering
[46:59] spirit
[47:02] all right come on
[47:07] Hallelujah
[47:09] we all have a Ministry
[47:11] the Great Commission is not on brother
[47:13] Paul alone
[47:16] the Great Commission was given to
[47:18] Believers not pastors
[47:21] these signs follow the Believers
[47:24] and this burden is packed upon the
[47:26] shoulders we need more than just
[47:28] preachers
[47:30] we need workers we need prayer warriors
[47:33] we need people with passion to bring
[47:36] them in we need recruits we need an army
[47:44] ministering spirits
[47:47] to minister to those that are dying and
[47:49] lost
[47:51] God brings you from a life of sin to a
[47:55] life of service
[47:58] how many believe that
[48:01] brother Branham said we are angels angel
[48:03] means messenger we are angels of the
[48:06] Covenant
[48:07] we are angels of good news
[48:10] that there is hope for you brother
[48:12] There's Hope for you sister he said we
[48:15] are angels of the Resurrection
[48:18] amen how many want to be a ministering
[48:21] Spirit sent from the presence of God to
[48:23] minister hope to those that feel like
[48:26] they can't make it another hour
[48:30] brother Branham said just show somebody
[48:31] you care
[48:35] he said a healing goes a long way
[48:38] he said God heals by understanding
[48:41] God heals by love he said just someone
[48:45] that's upset show them you love him and
[48:47] he said God will heal them by that
[48:49] he said just a little love just a little
[48:51] care just a smile to go out of your way
[48:54] a little kind word goes a long way I
[48:58] appreciate you brother I appreciate you
[49:00] keep on
[49:02] sister I saw how hard you worked in the
[49:04] kitchen this weekend God bless you and
[49:06] reward you and fill you
[49:09] appreciate your sacrifice brother
[49:14] we are the body of Christ we are the
[49:16] hands the ministering part of the body
[49:20] the head ain't the ministering part the
[49:22] hands are
[49:24] right God working through you to bring
[49:28] Salvation to a Dying World
[49:31] isn't that wonderful
[49:32] and brother Branham said now God wants
[49:35] to anoint us with sympathy
[49:39] he said an expression of his sympathy
[49:43] will pour over our hearts that's been
[49:46] born of a spirit to reflect in the
[49:49] church the love of God
[49:51] oh sure
[49:54] but you've got a feel for the person
[49:57] you remember the story of Paul Rader he
[50:00] was a Christian he loved the Lord and
[50:02] one morning he got up and he said his
[50:05] wife went Crossways then I know everyone
[50:07] hears beyond that but just so you get
[50:10] the idea
[50:12] so Paul Rader struggling in this area
[50:15] this morning
[50:17] and he said they they she wanted to go
[50:19] somewhere he didn't want to go and she
[50:21] she got her feelings hurt
[50:23] and he said so he grabbed this briefcase
[50:26] and he said they had just a tradition
[50:29] she would walk him to the door she would
[50:31] open the door and he would kiss her and
[50:33] say goodbye she'd say goodbye and he
[50:36] would walk out to the end of the pathway
[50:38] and he would wave by and just he would
[50:40] wave by and he would go on to work
[50:42] he said well this day even though he
[50:44] hurt her feelings he said they went
[50:47] through the same routine and many a
[50:48] times people's heart is so far from what
[50:51] God is doing but they're going through
[50:53] the routine and coming to church even
[50:55] for years it can happen May God heal you
[50:58] today
[51:01] so she went right through the routine
[51:03] and she opened the door he kissed her
[51:06] she kissed him he walked out to the
[51:08] street he's bye bye he starts down and
[51:10] the Lord spoke to him
[51:12] and said what if something was going to
[51:14] happen today
[51:16] and she would never see her again
[51:19] and it really got to him
[51:22] and he turned
[51:24] and he went quickly back to the door and
[51:25] he opened the door and when he did he
[51:27] said he heard some snubbing and she's
[51:29] down there on the floor crying
[51:32] he said I picked her up
[51:34] he said I kissed her
[51:36] he said I walked out the door said bye
[51:40] she said bye and he said I walked away
[51:43] he said brother Branham you know what
[51:44] the difference was
[51:46] he said what was it he said this time
[51:49] it had feeling in it
[51:55] when God sent this message to restore us
[51:58] back
[52:00] he is restoring us to a heartfelt
[52:02] religion
[52:05] not just another church
[52:08] but a living organism
[52:10] this is something different than
[52:12] anything on the face of the Earth
[52:15] it is to be a power that has struck the
[52:18] Earth
[52:19] Jesus had no place to lay his head he
[52:21] had no church but the whole Heavens was
[52:24] his Parish
[52:26] and God's church is to fulfill his work
[52:29] and destroy the works of the devil
[52:36] how many say Lord I want feeling in what
[52:39] I believe
[52:42] I think it'd be good just to really give
[52:44] God a great Embrace this morning
[52:47] God wants action
[52:49] More Than Words
[52:52] the Bible says let love be without
[52:54] hypocrisy let love be indeed and Truth
[52:59] the only way you can ever express God is
[53:02] through love
[53:04] brother Branham said My Success
[53:07] in praying for the sick
[53:09] is that I enter into the fellowship of
[53:11] their sufferings
[53:14] so he's not casual
[53:16] he actually takes time
[53:19] to enter into it
[53:23] brother Branham said that when
[53:24] cross-eyed children would come into the
[53:26] prayer lines God never refused him
[53:29] and the reason was because when Sharon
[53:31] Rose his own daughter was dying her eyes
[53:33] severely crossed
[53:36] she suffered so bad her eyes was totally
[53:39] crossed and he said her little leg was
[53:41] jerking and she died in that condition
[53:44] since that time when he would see a
[53:46] cross-eyed child he would go back to
[53:48] that experience which would touch his
[53:50] heart
[53:51] and he said sometimes God has to squeeze
[53:54] and crush the flower to get the perfume
[53:57] out of it
[53:59] sometimes our trials we think are so bad
[54:02] is actually God trying to bring an
[54:04] attribute
[54:06] our sufferings everything will work for
[54:09] the good
[54:10] to them that love the Lord how many
[54:12] believe that
[54:13] like the little boy when the storm came
[54:16] he was upstairs and the Thunder bang
[54:18] bang Mama come up here
[54:21] and she rushed up there Mama come sleep
[54:24] with me
[54:26] she said honey honey we believe in God
[54:28] God protects us from Storm he said but
[54:30] sleep with me
[54:32] she said honey I don't we're going to
[54:34] rebuke this fear we're not going to
[54:36] accept this fear God is protecting us
[54:38] but come sleep with me she said honey
[54:40] God protects us
[54:42] she he said I believe in God
[54:45] but sometimes I want a god with skin on
[54:48] it
[54:52] we could not know God in spirit form
[54:55] so God loved us and came down and became
[54:58] flesh so he could be felt
[55:01] and when he went off the Earth he did
[55:04] not leave but he poured his Spirit into
[55:06] his charge
[55:07] that this world would experience god
[55:10] with skin on it
[55:15] Hallelujah
[55:17] Hallelujah
[55:19] God always worked through his body
[55:22] everybody loved the Lord
[55:25] preach the gospel to all the world
[55:30] and then the end shall come
[55:34] how many say Lord Make Me A ministering
[55:36] spirit
[55:38] Lord Make Me an Angel of Mercy make me
[55:41] an angel of Light
[55:44] brother Graham said now go in the name
[55:46] of the Lord every one of you into the
[55:48] highways and the hedges and the byways
[55:50] and claim the gospel and go out you
[55:53] women into the neighborhood go to the
[55:55] hospitals and pray for the sick believe
[55:57] it and exercise your faith
[56:01] wow
[56:04] wow
[56:06] he is challenging us to believe his word
[56:09] and step out on the Great Commission
[56:12] exercise your faith in God
[56:18] our job is to believe how easy is that
[56:21] God's job is to do the healing
[56:24] and healing passes through his body and
[56:27] God imparts life through his body he
[56:29] uses by the preaching of the word how
[56:31] shall they hear without a preacher
[56:36] God needs hands
[56:38] he needs willing hearts
[56:41] he's looking for a people that'll sell
[56:44] out Lock Stock and Barrel and give back
[56:46] to God what he gave
[56:49] because love is an exchange
[56:52] you can't love a statue you marry a wife
[56:56] you give and you take you give and you
[56:59] take God has a bride and he's given but
[57:03] he wants love back he wants obedience
[57:06] back God wants a relationship
[57:13] you can have relationship with a
[57:15] Doctrine
[57:16] he's got to be a person
[57:18] a person that you could talk to a person
[57:21] you can walk with I'll be with you
[57:24] always even to the end of the world
[57:27] Hallelujah
[57:31] when the preacher preaches the word of
[57:33] God the Holy Spirit begins to move over
[57:35] the congregation and anoint the people
[57:37] with faith
[57:41] you feel your heart raising up to take
[57:43] God at his word
[57:46] now these are not brother Craig's words
[57:48] these are Christ's words I give you
[57:51] power
[57:52] To Tread upon the head of scorpions
[57:55] and nothing by any means shall harm you
[57:59] is that the word of Our Lord
[58:02] the commission of God was you drive out
[58:05] the enemy
[58:07] we have a commission to cast out evil to
[58:11] cast out Devils to drive out cancer we
[58:16] are not the Healer we only point to the
[58:18] Healer and we are the representation of
[58:21] God's heart on Earth
[58:26] I've seen him save so many beyond what I
[58:29] can count
[58:30] I've seen him heal the sick we all have
[58:33] but we need him today we need him to
[58:36] manifest like never before as the world
[58:38] grows darker the church ought to grow
[58:40] brighter
[58:44] and God is calling us to rise to our
[58:46] feet in a world of perversion
[58:50] in a world that tries to confuse genders
[58:53] and bring confusion on the minds of the
[58:56] people we ought to stand up
[59:00] and say we are Sons and Daughters of God
[59:03] and there's a hope for this Dying World
[59:08] don't you Hunker back God will defend
[59:10] his own word we are not going to bow to
[59:13] your Idols we're not going to bow to
[59:15] your your liberal devils
[59:19] God made man God made woman
[59:25] he has the last word
[59:29] Hallelujah
[59:31] and we believe his word
[59:34] the gospel brings freedom
[59:37] it sets the captive free it breaks
[59:40] cigarette addiction
[59:42] it breaks pornography addiction
[59:46] you don't have to lay your hands on the
[59:48] preacher the preacher lays hands on you
[59:49] you need God to lay his hands on you
[59:52] and he can do that right now
[59:54] [Applause]
[59:56] but you've got to make a choice God is
[59:58] active now he's waiting for you to act
[1:00:03] Hallelujah just believe him
[1:00:06] Hallelujah gospel opens the prison doors
[1:00:11] I'm just curious
[1:00:13] the Lord brought me out of the world
[1:00:15] and something got a hold of me beyond me
[1:00:19] I've not gotten over it and that was
[1:00:21] when I was 23 years old
[1:00:23] how many here did God open the prison
[1:00:26] doors
[1:00:29] and you how many come out of a prison
[1:00:30] cell show me raise your hands
[1:00:33] how many know it was the hand of
[1:00:35] almighty God that did it
[1:00:37] a man a leopard cannot change its spots
[1:00:40] neither Ethiopian their skin and neither
[1:00:42] can a man that's born in sin become
[1:00:44] righteous it takes God to make a man
[1:00:46] righteous
[1:00:50] and if God can open prison doors for all
[1:00:53] these people God will open the prison
[1:00:55] door for anyone that asks
[1:00:58] he did not die in vain
[1:01:02] and I'm challenging the young people you
[1:01:05] may have been raised sheltered but
[1:01:07] knowing god is another story
[1:01:11] and God loves you like he loves The
[1:01:13] Sinner
[1:01:14] come out of that prison cell
[1:01:18] for that bondage and be free in Christ
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:23] I always tell my wife we're the
[1:01:25] Christians
[1:01:26] we can't expect other people to live we
[1:01:29] we got to live it and if there's only
[1:01:31] one in the world God let it be me
[1:01:35] I know young people have seen
[1:01:37] disappointments and church splits and
[1:01:39] all kinds of fanaticism that's only what
[1:01:41] surrounds the gospel but Christ there's
[1:01:44] no fault in him
[1:01:48] and we have something real
[1:01:51] it is the word of almighty God
[1:02:01] I believe with all my heart
[1:02:03] that God who looked upon the people with
[1:02:05] compassion
[1:02:07] I believe he looks upon this meeting
[1:02:11] and that's my prayer Lord look upon us
[1:02:14] with compassion
[1:02:16] look upon our needs
[1:02:19] there are complexes we can't get Beyond
[1:02:22] there are hurts that we cannot rise
[1:02:25] above but just ask God to help you
[1:02:28] you got to be willing to lay it down in
[1:02:30] order to be healed
[1:02:32] you say I just can't break through maybe
[1:02:34] there's sin in your life
[1:02:36] God will not hear sin separates you from
[1:02:39] God
[1:02:40] you say but if I confess it I it will be
[1:02:44] bad for me it'll be hell for you
[1:02:47] but the bible promises if you confess
[1:02:49] your sins God is faithful to forgive and
[1:02:52] cleanse of all unrighteousness I don't
[1:02:55] care what you have done
[1:02:57] give God a chance
[1:03:00] about in faith and give God a chance and
[1:03:03] see if he don't change your heart though
[1:03:06] your sins be a Scarlet it'll be as white
[1:03:08] as wool
[1:03:11] come on young people
[1:03:15] get right with God
[1:03:21] Lord manifest Your Love
[1:03:24] move Among Us Lord
[1:03:27] move in US
[1:03:29] with a compassion from a man that came
[1:03:32] from Jerusalem to Jericho
[1:03:35] and there may be tons that just don't
[1:03:37] have time because life is busy but God
[1:03:39] let me be a good samaritan
[1:03:42] let me be the man that comes and begin
[1:03:45] to pour oil
[1:03:46] and wine
[1:03:48] and bring healing to a broken person
[1:03:51] who deserved it and we did too
[1:03:54] but God's compassion
[1:03:56] he comes into a meeting and he begins to
[1:03:59] heal old burdens
[1:04:01] old grudges
[1:04:04] things that just stay there for years
[1:04:08] I think we need to push the walls down
[1:04:12] I really do I think if we want a Revival
[1:04:14] I think we need to start by taking a
[1:04:16] step we've never taken before I've been
[1:04:19] to the altar that ain't what I'm talking
[1:04:20] about I'm talking about taking a step
[1:04:22] from your stronghold
[1:04:25] many times we're in prison not because
[1:04:27] it is because of our own self we put
[1:04:29] ourselves there
[1:04:33] we actually put ourselves in bondage
[1:04:35] that's why Jesus said go sin no more
[1:04:39] we put ourselves there by believing our
[1:04:42] own life we create a world around us
[1:04:45] and we we believe that life that's what
[1:04:48] the world is doing
[1:04:49] but Christ wants to break that and give
[1:04:52] you his mind which is his word
[1:04:57] I want to thank God's thoughts
[1:04:59] my thoughts wrecked my life
[1:05:02] your thoughts are wreck your life God's
[1:05:05] thoughts only put you on a path and it
[1:05:06] gets gooder and gooder
[1:05:09] hallelujah how many like to start a new
[1:05:12] year and a new just a new breath of
[1:05:14] fresh air and say God breathing me
[1:05:17] Lord touch me like you did the leper I
[1:05:21] haven't had a Revival in my heart for a
[1:05:23] long time lord would you come by and
[1:05:25] touch me

[1:05:30] the Holy Spirit and Lord let me let
[1:05:32] touch my heart
[1:05:33] touch my mind touch my spirit bring back
[1:05:38] a love for the word of God again

[1:06:11] appreciate it but I need more than
[1:06:13] church I need a god with skin on it
[1:06:20] [Applause]

[1:29:29] that's our desire this morning praise
[1:29:32] the Lord the word of God is Rich to us I
[1:29:34] can only think of the parable of Jesus
[1:29:37] who gave the invitation he said in the
[1:29:38] parable there was an invitation for the
[1:29:40] wedding supper to go out they sent out
[1:29:42] the invitations and the first group the
[1:29:45] first poll they begin to make excuse I
[1:29:48] can't come I've married a wife I bought
[1:29:50] a piece of land and so the the leader of
[1:29:53] the home he just said we'll just put out
[1:29:55] another call second poll we'll just call
[1:29:57] those to come the second ones and he
[1:29:59] said my my house is still not full and
[1:30:02] then this last poll the last poll let me
[1:30:04] just say this for believers that know
[1:30:06] the message
[1:30:07] shame of a shame on us if we make the
[1:30:10] third poll only Doctrine
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:17] it's so much more than that
[1:30:20] so in this Parable the third poll is not
[1:30:23] go out the third poll is compelling them
[1:30:26] to come in and you can't compel them
[1:30:28] unless you're convinced and have the
[1:30:30] heart of God yourself
[1:30:32] hearing recognizing and then acting on
[1:30:36] the word and the third Point says you
[1:30:38] know what go out into the highways and
[1:30:40] hedges
[1:30:41] and the third post compel them to come
[1:30:43] in compel them to come in
[1:30:46] you know the Devil Makes Us afraid to
[1:30:48] say something I might offend that person
[1:30:50] don't offend them but don't hold back
[1:30:52] from sharing the compassion and Love Of
[1:30:55] Christ with them not in this hour
[1:30:58] judgment is getting ready to strike this
[1:31:00] Earth can you say Amen this morning when
[1:31:02] I get up and I look at look at the news

[1:31:21] investigating angels for judgment we're
[1:31:24] very close and here is the true heart
[1:31:27] and love of God where in The Bride of
