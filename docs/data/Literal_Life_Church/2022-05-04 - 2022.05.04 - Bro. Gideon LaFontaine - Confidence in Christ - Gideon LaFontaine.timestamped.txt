[1:04] men we can look at
[1:06] in our lives i know my grandpa and
[1:09] brother lonnie jenkins we have soldiers
[1:12] that we can look at and say wow they

[1:17] what the work they had and
[1:19] who christ was amen amen we can always
[1:22] look at those people and we say wow how
[1:24] did they get there i feel like i'm just
[1:26] always in the shaky ground all the time

[1:33] i want to be there amen i want to be
[1:35] where they
[1:36] they got amen i want to i want to be

[1:55] see i'm in proverbs you got to me in
[1:57] psalms
[1:59] amen psalms 27
[2:04] all right here we go
[2:06] the lord is my light and my salvation
[2:08] whom shall i fear the lord is my
[2:10] strength the strength of my life and
[2:12] whom shall i be afraid
[2:14] when the wicked
[2:16] even my enemies and my foe
[2:19] shall
[2:21] even my enemies and my foes
[2:23] came upon me to eat up my flesh they
[2:26] stumbled and fell
[2:28] though and whole should encamp against
[2:30] me
[2:31] my heart shall not fear the worst should
[2:34] rise against me in this will i be
[2:36] confident
[2:37] one thing have i desired of the lord
[2:40] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[2:42] in the house of the lord all the days of
[2:45] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[2:48] and to inquire in his temples
[2:51] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[2:53] me in his pavilion in the secret of his
[2:55] tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[2:58] me up upon the rock hallelujah
[3:01] amen let's just
[3:03] let's just uh
[3:05] let's just have our seats tonight and we
[3:07] can get right into the word
[3:10] hallelujah
[3:11] i mean tonight i want to talk about the
[3:13] confidence um
[3:16] i guess this just struck me um
[3:19] probably a couple weeks ago
[3:20] um
[3:22] i guess you you see uh
[3:25] like like what i'm talking about you see
[3:27] uh the overcomers in the past you see uh
[3:30] people in your life um your parents
[3:32] probably that you can say my i just
[3:36] i want to be that amen you just have
[3:39] something about it's not it's not you
[3:40] want to be that person but you want what
[3:43] they've got amen
[3:45] amen so you want that confidence that
[3:47] they got
[3:48] so
[3:49] confidence um just looked up some
[3:51] definitions here uh the feeling or
[3:54] belief that one can own
[3:56] one can rely on someone or something a
[3:59] firm trust
[4:01] in the hebrew it means security
[4:05] confidence
[4:07] safety
[4:08] defense assurance
[4:11] those are some of the words that we come
[4:13] come to when we find this word
[4:14] confidence amen
[4:17] so then when we look i mean we look at
[4:19] ourselves we can look at we can look all
[4:21] around us and see this confidence
[4:24] that
[4:25] we can look at the animal kingdom
[4:26] actually it's pretty exciting if you
[4:28] just look around you can see the
[4:30] animal kingdom and how they have a
[4:32] certain thing called instincts you know
[4:34] what instincts are they have something
[4:36] in them that they were they were born
[4:38] with they didn't they couldn't change it
[4:40] about them but it helps them survive it
[4:43] gets things in line for them so they
[4:45] know what to do
[4:47] one example would be
[4:49] the simple duck you've got a duck pond
[4:51] up in canada and you see them up there
[4:54] you see this male duck come and he uh
[4:57] all he's got to do is come in the middle
[4:59] of the pond and go honk
[5:01] honk
[5:02] honk
[5:04] that's all he's got to do he's got a
[5:06] honk and all those birds come right
[5:08] there it's that instinct they hear that
[5:11] they come right there
[5:13] and then right all of a sudden he says
[5:15] honk honk honk it's almost like we're
[5:17] honking our horn but he goes on to fly
[5:20] in and they head down south for the
[5:21] winter they they skip the cold i mean
[5:24] it's something about it it's instincts
[5:26] they've got it
[5:27] you got the bird to fly who teaches a
[5:29] bird to fly
[5:31] it's instincts
[5:32] right right
[5:34] do you believe there's such a thing as
[5:35] instincts amen hallelujah
[5:38] praise the lord
[5:40] then we've got
[5:41] beavers they they create a dam in the
[5:44] pond they build their home their
[5:46] security against all the evils that are
[5:48] coming attacking their families they've
[5:51] got things set in stone just inside of
[5:54] them that they've they've got and it's
[5:57] it just comes out out of out of nature
[6:00] amen praise the lord
[6:04] um they react to certain situations by
[6:08] nature to thrive in this world
[6:10] amen if they had if they didn't have it
[6:14] they could not survive
[6:15] animals have confidence in the leader
[6:18] amen just like just like a deer um
[6:22] just like a mother deer you see them you
[6:24] see the little little deers following
[6:26] them just it's just nature to follow
[6:28] amen
[6:29] they they know they know they have trust
[6:31] in their mama amen praise the lord
[6:34] and then you've got
[6:36] babies ourselves i mean we're dependent
[6:38] on the mother amen there's certain
[6:40] natures we have to just
[6:43] to just
[6:44] just
[6:45] take take our mothers and just depend on
[6:48] them completely i mean we don't have
[6:50] that
[6:50] i mean there's something in us that we
[6:52] just do we have the nature i mean we
[6:54] just breathe amen
[6:57] i mean we take that one breath of life
[6:59] just like it's just and then we we start
[7:01] getting it right right off the bat amen
[7:03] praise the lord
[7:05] so
[7:07] so that's what i come
[7:08] you know to the human and where where we
[7:11] are in this whole thing
[7:13] god gave them instincts but he gave us
[7:16] the holy ghost
[7:19] he gave them instincts but us the holy
[7:21] ghost
[7:23] if animals
[7:24] can't survive without instincts they
[7:27] can't find food they can't do what they
[7:28] need to do then christians are going to
[7:31] have a hard time to survive and thrive
[7:33] without that holy ghost you believe that
[7:36] tonight
[7:37] we need it we need it more than anything
[7:39] before in this day we need that holy
[7:42] spirit amen that token hallelujah
[7:45] praise the lord and i'm going to take
[7:46] just a little time tonight uh
[7:49] teaching from
[7:50] uh i don't know if it's teaching but
[7:53] whatever it is i don't even know what i
[7:54] do up here
[7:56] just bear with me um but we'll uh we'll
[7:59] go ahead tonight and uh we'll go from
[8:01] the sermon why are people so tossed
[8:04] about
[8:05] this sermon speaks to me so much i can
[8:07] listen to this one so much and so much
[8:09] and i get so much more out of it every
[8:12] every single time i listen to it um
[8:15] you know he starts off you know kind of
[8:17] getting the testimony where he where he
[8:19] kind of sees people and where they are
[8:21] at and he just sees people
[8:23] on the edge all the time they have such
[8:25] a such a such a um just a discomfort in
[8:29] their in their in their lives where one
[8:31] little thing can happen and it's it's
[8:34] just devastation in their lives there's
[8:36] no confidence within them at all then
[8:39] you've got this other side of people
[8:41] that you have this
[8:42] i mean whatever is going on in their
[8:45] lives they could have loved ones die
[8:47] they could have things going on but
[8:49] they're sure they're walking firm
[8:51] nothing nothing is affecting them
[8:53] nothing's keeping them out of the
[8:54] presence of god they'll be in there all
[8:57] the time amen
[8:59] amen it doesn't keep them away from what
[9:01] god's purpose is in their life they just
[9:03] keep on moving on praise the lord
[9:06] amen so i he he brings out these two
[9:09] distinctions he's first he says two
[9:11] types of christians but then he says but
[9:14] no they're actually two phases so
[9:16] there's these phases too first it's
[9:18] intellectual faith you've got first the
[9:20] intellectual faith
[9:22] where these people obviously they're not
[9:24] they're not really they're not really
[9:26] firm they don't have something settled
[9:28] within them amen they don't have
[9:30] something settled then you have the one
[9:34] i'm not
[9:35] i guess i can say the true experience of
[9:38] the lord
[9:39] the true heart experience the other side
[9:42] of this where there's two that next
[9:44] phase
[9:45] the next phase i love that word how it
[9:47] says the phase but um it's the heart
[9:50] experience where you have that
[9:51] experience with god and it changes you
[9:54] forever amen it's an eternal experience
[9:56] amen hallelujah
[9:59] so the human
[10:02] looking back at the old testament
[10:04] um
[10:06] i want to go through the tabernacle kind
[10:07] of just
[10:08] just going through it hopefully you can
[10:10] you know follow along tonight i'm sure a
[10:12] lot of you know that with the tabernacle
[10:14] and with the you know outer core inner
[10:16] court and everything the holy's of
[10:18] holies but i'd like to go through them
[10:20] and just kind of
[10:22] just lay it all out there and i i ask
[10:24] you to
[10:25] you know pull on it because it's uh it
[10:27] is good stuff just to see where you are
[10:29] in your spiritual walk amen see where
[10:31] see where god's uh is exposing you and
[10:34] where your faults are and
[10:36] and uh maybe tonight we can build some
[10:38] confidence through him amen hallelujah
[10:41] thank you lord
[10:42] so first we have this uh first we have
[10:45] the man of falling amen the man is
[10:47] falling all the time right
[10:49] man is falling we have we can bring it
[10:52] into the church here we can bring it in
[10:54] we have people in the church we have
[10:56] souls in the church
[10:58] man is falling preaches preaching he's
[11:00] coming through through the services all
[11:02] the time good preaching i'd say so
[11:04] myself
[11:05] amen do you believe that do you feel
[11:07] like we have a good
[11:08] good good preaching going on around here
[11:10] hallelujah thank you lord that's what we
[11:12] need but we have this uh man is falling
[11:15] we have this outer court though and um
[11:17] there's a there's a this is our flesh if
[11:20] you could type it with the human
[11:22] there's a flesh there's the outer court
[11:24] to this tabernacle and you have your
[11:26] outer senses and that's a lot where
[11:28] these people are at when they haven't
[11:30] really had a deeper walk in their life
[11:32] they're at this they're at the state of
[11:35] the outer court where the light
[11:38] is
[11:39] they're they're affected by everything
[11:41] going on around them it's it's not this
[11:43] it's not this focused life it's it's
[11:46] everything going on around them they're
[11:48] affected by gloomy days they're affected
[11:50] by people talking about them they're
[11:52] affected by by people
[11:54] people may be talking behind their backs
[11:57] they they they get so affected by what
[12:00] people may call them or maybe i i've
[12:02] i've noticed sometimes even in my life
[12:05] where i'll you know
[12:07] we can we can get so disappointed in
[12:09] what the weather will be like amen and
[12:11] it just consumes us and we just get a
[12:14] man brother
[12:16] and we just we get so we get so down
[12:20] because it's raining today
[12:23] wow
[12:25] i'm not going to say any much anything
[12:26] about that but it just in if you put it
[12:28] in perspective this should not be
[12:31] affecting of where we are with god amen
[12:34] hallelujah praise god
[12:36] so you have taste feel smell sound look
[12:39] oh my goodness this cake
[12:41] gross
[12:43] tastes terrible ruined my day
[12:47] i've heard people say that all the time
[12:49] it ruined my day something so simple in
[12:52] their lives and it ruined their day and
[12:53] it seems kind of humorous to us but we
[12:55] actually we we come to those times and
[12:58] we we do we fall into the flesh amen
[13:02] amen
[13:03] so this is a justified man as well he
[13:05] has gloomy days he walks
[13:08] based on his surroundings and that's
[13:10] that's a tough that's a tough place to
[13:12] be if you're walking based on your
[13:14] surroundings amen what's going on around
[13:17] you i mean
[13:19] i said it a few weeks ago but you've got
[13:21] that horse
[13:22] you know and you you've got blinders on
[13:24] them a horse
[13:25] you know you you if they got blinders
[13:28] they ain't seeing anything else they got
[13:29] one purpose they're going and they're
[13:31] doing what the master's saying amen
[13:33] that's where i want to be
[13:35] but
[13:36] if they don't
[13:37] they're they're going to find triggers
[13:38] amen
[13:40] amen
[13:41] so
[13:43] we got the next here
[13:45] here's a little quote from that
[13:47] so i i'll say that tonight as well
[13:50] i'm not saying
[13:52] brother branham says and
[13:54] why are people so tossed about i don't
[13:56] say them people are here in the
[13:57] tabernacle
[13:59] i don't say that they're here you know
[14:01] tonight i'm not saying that but but i
[14:04] say there is there's things that people
[14:06] would do and they get different
[14:09] at least little thing will bring that
[14:11] old temper back again that selfishness
[14:14] open up a year to gossip and do nothing
[14:17] and do something of that type that
[14:19] person has never entered into the into
[14:22] this pot in here
[14:23] here
[14:24] they're outside
[14:26] so that's that's what he's saying here
[14:28] he said they've
[14:29] they've come to a place where they they
[14:31] haven't moved on in their spiritual walk
[14:33] as far as just letting go and letting
[14:35] god take him into that inner court amen
[14:38] so we've got the inner court now and uh
[14:41] as i talk about you know the process
[14:44] coming into the holies of holies here
[14:46] but um i was you know i was kind of
[14:48] thinking back and even in kova times um
[14:52] kovit's starting off and i think we can
[14:54] all relate to it tonight but i remember
[14:57] uh we're watching the news quite a bit
[14:59] and i think some of us probably still do
[15:02] i've kind of left it alone i can't
[15:05] i get i get too too uh worked up in the
[15:08] mind about it but
[15:10] um the news and you know you're watching
[15:12] all the time you see kova's going on and
[15:14] oh my what's going on in this world what
[15:17] am i gonna do you have this fear you
[15:19] know build up and even i gotta apologize
[15:21] to my my grandma tonight but i remember
[15:23] her coming i'm coming to our house just
[15:25] visiting and she was just in the car
[15:28] i remember i couldn't even give her a
[15:29] hug because of that fear that they
[15:32] they had i
[15:33] i mean i i just couldn't believe you
[15:35] know after it was all passing gone i
[15:38] almost found myself in such a humble
[15:40] place i was like wow i can't even hug my
[15:43] my grandma because of what's around
[15:45] me amen
[15:47] amen so
[15:48] so for covid
[15:50] i mean a lot of ways god can send a
[15:52] worldwide disaster to expose where you
[15:55] are sometimes expose where you're going
[15:58] to stand amen
[16:00] amen so you go into the inner court
[16:02] you're seeking god you're going into the
[16:04] inner court and this is the spirit realm
[16:06] this is memory conscience imagination
[16:09] reason affection
[16:11] um this is a sanctified man also so
[16:14] you're seeking that
[16:16] you get this
[16:17] this sanctified
[16:19] you understand that um
[16:22] does all things right you're living a
[16:24] clean life before god you have
[16:27] seven cold golden uh candlesticks
[16:29] burning and giving light
[16:32] you have these candle sticks which
[16:34] actually is
[16:35] you have it burning with oil so it is
[16:38] a type of the holy holy spirit
[16:40] but at the same time those
[16:43] it's it's not it still has a potential
[16:45] to not last it has it still has a
[16:47] potential to go out it can smoke up and
[16:50] those have to be relit at times amen so
[16:53] there's still a time even with a
[16:55] sanctified life
[16:57] you're living right you've come under
[16:59] the subjection of of god's word and
[17:01] you've you've done that
[17:03] you've done the you've done the things
[17:04] that you feel you feel the the holy
[17:07] spirit leading you to do and um
[17:10] you uh
[17:12] you finally come to a place where um
[17:15] you start hearing god's word and it
[17:17] starts actually
[17:19] circumcising you cutting things out of
[17:21] your life and you've got that
[17:23] you've got that process coming god's
[17:25] process do you believe that's god's
[17:26] process bringing you through these amen
[17:29] these this inner court this this this
[17:31] outer core inner court amen it's god's
[17:33] process so we got to trust god's process
[17:35] amen we have confidence in god's process
[17:38] amen we can't put our we can't put our
[17:41] faith in anything else we got to trust
[17:43] where god has us in our lives and he's i
[17:46] love this i'll get to it here in a
[17:48] little bit
[17:49] but then we've got god's word exposing
[17:51] us and where we're actually out where
[17:53] there's not just this step of saint
[17:55] sanctification but there's another step
[17:58] of receiving the holy ghost amen there's
[18:01] another step in entering into that
[18:03] holies of holies amen god works god's
[18:07] word makes us know where we are the word
[18:10] i love this the word divides the spirit
[18:12] and the soul amen that's what what it
[18:15] does the word and i believe it's the
[18:17] word for your day too if you're not in
[18:19] that word for your day how is it gonna
[18:21] how is it gonna separate that amen
[18:24] get in the word people god get in the
[18:26] word amen praise the lord
[18:29] so we have
[18:31] the holies of holies this is
[18:33] this is my personal favorite
[18:35] the holies of holies this is the soul
[18:37] level this is where faith can abound
[18:39] amen do you believe that
[18:41] faith can abound amen it is faith
[18:44] and unbelief but with the holy spirit in
[18:47] there it's only faith amen praise god
[18:50] and this is
[18:52] when the when you enter in the holy

[23:58] and then i also want to talk a little
[23:59] bit about the personality sometimes we
[24:02] sometimes young people and i know i went
[24:04] through this myself but
[24:06] um and even still you know still in a
[24:09] process of you know sometimes you're
[24:11] just like who am i and how should i act
[24:13] what should i do amen
[24:15] and personality i believe this with all
[24:17] my heart personality is amplified
[24:20] when that soul is quickened amen when
[24:22] that soul is quickened by the word of
[24:24] god
[24:25] person your personality and what it's
[24:27] supposed to do it actually amplifies
[24:28] amen it comes to what god wants you to
[24:31] be amen
[24:32] you don't have to you don't have to
[24:33] worry what's going on around you and say
[24:35] oh i need to act this way i need to i
[24:37] need to do this in order to make this
[24:39] person happy and stuff like this
[24:41] you can have trust in what's inside of
[24:43] you and then you can have confidence in
[24:44] what is placed within you amen thank you
[24:47] lord
[24:48] amen we all we all know children have
[24:51] personalities god you know god gives
[24:53] children personalities i know i'm
[24:56] not going to talk about you but i'm
[24:58] going to talk about your mom but um
[25:01] she you know she
[25:03] as a mother you always you know kind of
[25:06] see how a children reacts and does
[25:08] certain things and they try to just say
[25:10] this is how he is that's how she is and
[25:12] that's that's how you know and uh that's
[25:15] how they react you know they know
[25:17] they've got it all figured out amen
[25:20] not really
[25:22] not to not to you know diminish your mom
[25:25] or you know make you feel bad but at the
[25:28] same time when
[25:30] when you're a new creature in christ
[25:32] amen you've got you've got a new name
[25:35] you're not a new name but your your real
[25:37] name now is being amplified amen your
[25:40] real self is being amplified amen
[25:43] hallelujah amen
[25:46] then the worldly view of praise praising
[25:48] self amen and people they do all these
[25:51] things online of all these what what who
[25:54] am i and all these tests on who how they
[25:57] can figure out who they are
[25:59] um
[26:00] to be honest it's it's uh
[26:03] it's not really
[26:04] the most accurate thing amen
[26:07] i mean you may be able to catch some
[26:08] things that you're like yeah i do kind
[26:10] of you know i could kind of see that and
[26:12] stuff but it's it's uh
[26:14] it's it's not it's not um it's not sure
[26:17] amen
[26:19] so uh
[26:20] even you know
[26:22] i mean this whole generation is a praise
[26:24] of self of self like it's uh it's
[26:27] humanism really it's um just
[26:30] basically
[26:32] you know your
[26:33] worship your abilities and what you can
[26:35] do and that that might that mental state
[26:39] you you can go far in life you can you
[26:41] can you can do so many good things but
[26:43] we know the truth
[26:45] that
[26:46] yet not i but through christ and me amen
[26:48] do you believe that amen we've got to
[26:51] knock those things
[26:52] aside amen those those worldly views we
[26:55] cannot keep that in our mind of the
[26:57] humanism thought of
[26:59] of uh wow i'm i'm proud that i could do
[27:02] that or i can do this it's all about
[27:05] it's all about me amen we have to shed
[27:07] that aside because it's not you're
[27:09] breathing because of him amen
[27:12] you're walking because of him amen
[27:14] you're seeing because of him hallelujah
[27:17] do you believe that tonight praise the
[27:19] lord amen
[27:21] we've got a
[27:23] that's we've got here the worldly um inc
[27:26] that's what i was going to say david
[27:28] said encourage yourself in the lord amen
[27:30] in the lord that's the key you encourage
[27:32] yourself and the lord praise god
[27:35] um
[27:36] also tonight i would like to i'm
[27:38] probably speeding through this i don't
[27:40] even know what time it is here
[27:42] uh we're doing okay
[27:44] i also i i hope you don't mind tonight
[27:46] but i i found something in uh
[27:49] this book called mere christianity i
[27:51] don't promote it at all but i found a
[27:53] few things in there that was really
[27:55] interesting as far as the personality um
[27:59] and um
[28:01] just what people kind of struggle with
[28:03] as far as coming into
[28:05] their walk with christ but it's cs lewis
[28:08] you guys are familiar with cs lewis he
[28:10] wrote he's a christian author but um
[28:12] obviously you know he has some
[28:15] catholic basis and just different things
[28:17] but at the same time there are some
[28:18] things he he taps into that are very
[28:22] uh they're very encouraging to me to
[28:24] find that
[28:25] our personalities and what we we come to
[28:28] do like i'm saying are
[28:30] are made known and
[28:32] um made i mean
[28:34] made good through christ amen
[28:37] so i'll just read a little bit of this
[28:38] listening closely because he was an
[28:40] englishman
[28:41] and his word you should is pretty crazy
[28:44] all right so listen closely
[28:46] the more we get
[28:48] what we know
[28:50] the more we get what we now call
[28:52] ourselves out of the way and let him
[28:55] take us over
[28:57] the more truly ourselves we become
[29:00] there is so much of him that millions
[29:03] and millions of little christ all
[29:06] different
[29:08] will still be too few to express him
[29:10] fully
[29:12] he made them all
[29:14] he he's the great inventor he invented
[29:17] and is that
[29:18] it as an author invents characters in a
[29:21] novel
[29:23] all the different men that you and i
[29:25] were intended to be
[29:27] in that sense
[29:29] our real selves are all waiting for us
[29:33] in him
[29:34] it is no good trying to be myself
[29:37] without him
[29:39] the more i resist him and try to live on
[29:42] my own the more i become dominated by my
[29:45] own heredity and upbringing
[29:48] and surroundings and natural
[29:52] desires in fact
[29:55] what i so proudly call myself becomes
[29:57] merely the meeting place for trains of
[30:00] events which i never start started in
[30:03] which i cannot stop
[30:05] but i call my wishes
[30:08] what i call my wishes become merely the
[30:11] desires thrown up by my physical
[30:13] organism
[30:14] or pumped into me by other man's
[30:16] thoughts or other or even suggested to
[30:19] me by devils
[30:21] i mean this is this is powerful stuff
[30:23] with what what that what that means as
[30:25] far as who who we are amen and coming
[30:28] into christ amen
[30:31] it is when i learn
[30:33] is when i turn to christ when i give
[30:36] myself up to his personality
[30:39] amen one god amen do you believe that
[30:41] amen
[30:42] that i first began to have a real
[30:44] personality of my own amen
[30:47] until you have given up yourself to him
[30:50] you will not have a real self
[30:53] sameness is to be found most among the
[30:56] most natural men not among
[30:59] those who surrender to christ how
[31:02] monotonously
[31:03] alike are the great tyrants and
[31:05] conquerors have been how gloriously
[31:08] different are the saints
[31:10] amen
[31:12] then we've got here
[31:16] amen where are we okay
[31:19] but there must be a real giving up of
[31:21] self amen
[31:23] you must throw it away blindly so to
[31:26] speak
[31:27] christ will indeed give you a real
[31:29] personality but you must not go to him
[31:31] for the sake of that
[31:34] as long as your own personality is what
[31:36] you are bothering about
[31:39] you are not going to him at all the
[31:41] first step is to try to forget about the
[31:44] self all together
[31:47] your real new self
[31:49] which is christ
[31:52] and your and yours yours just because
[31:56] and yours just because it's his
[31:58] will not come as long as you are looking
[32:01] for it
[32:03] it will come when you are looking for
[32:04] him
[32:07] amen i got a little bit more but i'll
[32:09] stop there i mean i think you can see
[32:11] the picture amen
[32:13] praise god
[32:15] he's talking about
[32:16] when i turn to christ when i give up and
[32:19] let go
[32:20] let let god have his way in my life
[32:24] that's when god can work from the inside
[32:27] out and actually
[32:28] i love it because god's a god of variety
[32:30] amen you don't have to be there's not
[32:32] one certain way
[32:34] how
[32:35] how you need to react to certain things
[32:37] god is a god of variety amen do you
[32:39] believe that praise the lord amen there
[32:42] is obviously we are we are made in his
[32:45] in his character his likeness
[32:48] but god's a god of variety amen do you
[32:50] believe that
[32:52] praise the lord he he loves his children
[32:54] each and every one are distinct amen
[32:57] praise the lord
[32:59] so
[33:00] just a few more quotes
[33:03] just about this and
[33:05] paul said
[33:08] paul said to me for me to live is christ
[33:10] and to die is gain
[33:12] not me that liveth any more but christ
[33:15] that liveth in me
[33:17] christ liveth in the individual so
[33:19] surrendered when christ speaks through
[33:22] the lips and thinks through the mind
[33:24] sees through the eye acts through the
[33:27] temperament
[33:28] then the things of the world pass away
[33:31] how can it be anything but sweet and
[33:33] pleasant all the time
[33:35] christ has got control amen you see it
[33:39] that's what it is it's christ in you
[33:41] christ in you amen amen that's what
[33:44] we're seeking amen christ
[33:46] christ in us the hope of glory amen
[33:49] alleluia
[33:51] i mean we're not worried so much like
[33:52] like like c.s lewis is saying we're not
[33:55] so much worried about oh god i want my
[33:58] personality to come through and i want
[34:00] things
[34:01] to start happening in my life amen based
[34:03] on what i can do but it's christ in us
[34:07] that does the work amen
[34:09] trust in that have confidence in that
[34:11] not in your own ability not in what you
[34:13] can do with your own hands amen not with
[34:16] what you can do with your own voice but
[34:19] what christ can do through you amen have
[34:21] confidence in that
[34:23] alleluia our true confidence
[34:26] is rest our true confidence rest in the
[34:30] word amen do you believe that
[34:32] amen our true confidence does not come
[34:35] from man made ideas intellectual
[34:37] thinking it comes from the word of god
[34:39] amen amen seek that person seek the
[34:42] person of of god amen
[34:45] the spirit of the the spirit and the
[34:47] word are one a lot of times people get
[34:49] confused and
[34:50] what what is right and what is wrong all
[34:52] you've got to do i love this he puts it
[34:54] through a thinking man's filter amen
[34:56] give it the word test amen go back to
[34:59] the words see what's right and wrong for
[35:00] yourself amen
[35:02] i believe every believer should do that
[35:04] come to that place amen give it the word
[35:06] test amen see see if it see what's in
[35:10] your soul if that if if there's
[35:11] something in there that says no that's
[35:13] not right
[35:14] amen you trust that amen
[35:16] amen
[35:18] and it's by the word
[35:20] amen the man i don't get old in there
[35:23] only life it's in that holy place that
[35:25] shekinah glory amen
[35:28] it's then that that place where nothing
[35:30] gets old and actually life comes forth i
[35:32] said that aaron's rod actually just in a
[35:36] matter of time
[35:37] actually butted forth life amen in that
[35:40] holies of holies amen there's no death
[35:43] in there there's only life amen
[35:46] trust in that holy place amen if you're
[35:48] seeking that tonight amen i wouldn't be
[35:50] waiting
[35:51] amen
[35:52] if
[35:53] i would not be waiting
[35:56] and how and uh just uh have in your
[35:58] heart i'm okay i'll take a halfway
[36:01] experience no if you've got something in
[36:03] your heart that you want to keep going
[36:05] find that resting place find that haven
[36:08] where you can just rest in his word amen
[36:11] then he's got it for you you have a
[36:13] right amen hallelujah
[36:15] thank you lord
[36:18] i got a few more
[36:19] see what with their own interpretation
[36:23] they couldn't do nothing else because
[36:25] they leaned to what the church had told
[36:27] them what he he could
[36:29] he did rather than
[36:31] he would every time he comes and
[36:33] everything he does
[36:35] it'll be in the taste of the word so
[36:38] therefore we can't put confidence in
[36:40] what other people say there's only one
[36:43] thing that you can put your confidence
[36:44] in and that's the word
[36:46] and the word is god and the word anoints
[36:49] and the word anointed makes the messiah
[36:52] the anointed word of the hour how
[36:55] beautiful
[36:57] amen the word
[36:58] that's right the word always right but
[37:01] their interpretation of it is wrong amen
[37:05] amen that's why we can't come with
[37:06] man-made ideas even when approaching the
[37:08] throne of god we can't
[37:10] coming into church we can't come with
[37:11] our own agendas own ideas amen we have
[37:14] to come with that
[37:17] that in our mind amen we're coming for
[37:19] the word amen hallelujah thank you lord
[37:24] don't let the liar speak to you tonight
[37:26] amen satan
[37:28] satan is defeated that's what we're
[37:30] dealing with we're dealing with a
[37:32] defeated devil amen
[37:35] amen he has no hold of what god has
[37:38] placed in your life amen if there was a
[37:40] seed started and it's quickened it's
[37:42] going to come forth satan you cannot
[37:44] stop that
[37:45] hallelujah you have a right because of
[37:47] christ
[37:50] don't settle for this is what i was
[37:51] saying don't settle for a halfway
[37:53] inconsistent walk
[37:55] amen don't settle for that amen if
[37:57] there's a deep there's a deep to respond
[37:59] amen
[38:00] alleluia
[38:02] you have a right to enter that holy
[38:04] place
[38:05] shut out from the world completely in
[38:07] the things of the world amen that's the
[38:09] rapture amen do you believe that
[38:12] only all of this to say though oh it's
[38:15] only by his grace that we have this
[38:17] process amen
[38:19] amen we only by his grace we can we can
[38:22] come into this holy place amen
[38:25] and the things
[38:26] and we find our rest and we overcome
[38:29] amen
[38:30] thank you lord another few encouraging
[38:33] quotes along with us tonight before i
[38:36] close i know this was just a short
[38:38] simple
[38:39] message tonight but i wanted you to just
[38:42] realize just the confidence we have in
[38:44] christ amen we have in him amen
