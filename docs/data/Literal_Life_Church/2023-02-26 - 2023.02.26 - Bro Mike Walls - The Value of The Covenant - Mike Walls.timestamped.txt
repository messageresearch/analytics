[2:52] if we miss doing that
[2:55] we miss the whole reason
[2:58] of being here

[3:03] our soul doesn't allow us to be
[3:06] wishy-washy but gives us stability
[3:10] and Lord today our hearts desires that
[3:12] you would speak to us

[3:23] this morning
[3:25] without you coming there's nothing I can
[3:27] do to help him
[3:29] Lord last night I felt your presence in
[3:31] the room
[3:32] you walked with us through that little
[3:34] time
[3:35] now today father I pray that you would
[3:37] do that again
[3:37] [Music]
[3:38] just to bring you
[3:40] into the presence of the people we ask
[3:43] your guidance your blessing this morning
[3:45] in Jesus name
[3:47] sorry to keep you standing so long in
[3:49] Genesis chapter 6. I just want to use
[3:53] this to start with and I made several
[3:55] scriptures and I may not it'll just
[3:57] depend on things go
[3:59] Genesis chapter 6
[4:04] in verse 5.
[4:07] and God saw the wickedness of man was
[4:09] great in the earth and that every
[4:12] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[4:14] was only evil continually
[4:16] and I repented the Lord that he had made
[4:17] man on the earth and it grieved him at
[4:20] his heart
[4:21] and the Lord said I will destroy man
[4:23] whom I have created from the face of the
[4:25] Earth both man and Beast and creeping
[4:28] things
[4:29] and the fowls of the air
[4:31] for it repenteth me that I have made
[4:33] them
[4:34] but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[4:37] Lord
[4:38] these are the generations of Noah Noah
[4:41] was a just man and perfect
[4:45] in his generations and Noah walked with
[4:48] God
[4:49] and nobody got three sons Shem him and
[4:52] japath
[4:53] and the Earth also was corrupt before
[4:56] God and the Earth was filled with
[4:58] violence
[5:00] and God looked upon the Earth and behold
[5:02] it was corrupt for All Flesh had
[5:05] corrupted his way upon the Earth and God
[5:08] said unto Noah the end of All Flesh is
[5:11] come before me for the Earth is filled
[5:14] with violence through them and behold I
[5:18] will destroy them with the Earth God
[5:20] bless you can be seated
[5:23] this morning I'd like to speak a few
[5:25] minutes
[5:27] about
[5:29] the value
[5:31] of the Covenant
[5:33] the value of the Covenant
[5:36] and you know
[5:39] we see and and hear the story of Noah
[5:42] and
[5:43] everybody knows all these stories and
[5:46] how that they come about and we've heard
[5:48] about it since we were children ever
[5:50] since we've been in church
[5:52] and yet it has something to do with
[5:54] what's happening today
[5:57] Noah was preaching a message at the end
[5:59] time
[6:00] for those people
[6:01] it was an end time message how that the
[6:04] young people at that time was being told
[6:07] that God's going to send a flood he's
[6:09] going to destroy the Earth and and yet
[6:11] people just looked at him and just like
[6:13] he's just an old man he's just preaching
[6:15] you know but he was a messenger
[6:17] of God
[6:19] and God used him
[6:21] and then the Lord comes along and says
[6:23] I'm going to destroy the Earth
[6:26] and everyone that's in it
[6:28] because they've corrupted my Earth
[6:31] they've corrupted this thing and if you
[6:33] look around the world today and
[6:36] I know that I picked up a newspaper
[6:39] article yesterday just as we were coming
[6:41] out to go to breakfast
[6:43] and on it began to talk about how the
[6:45] lgbtq and all the different things the
[6:48] percentages of how it has doubled and
[6:49] tripled and the different Generation Z
[6:52] and the Millennials and all these
[6:54] different ones and where it began to
[6:55] grow at and where it's at now and what's
[6:58] driving the way we are today and you
[7:00] know in our time we had a prophet
[7:04] to come along and tell us
[7:06] that this world was going to be the mess
[7:09] that it's in today
[7:11] and when brother Branham come along and
[7:12] told us he sings people you know back in
[7:16] that day they probably couldn't
[7:16] understand it they probably couldn't
[7:18] believe it but yet he caught something
[7:22] that people of the world could not see
[7:26] and the reason he could is because he
[7:28] was the prophet messenger
[7:30] and I'm going to read a few things from
[7:31] his this message
[7:34] and I know there's people who's not
[7:35] agreeing with the message well that's
[7:37] their problem
[7:38] I don't have a problem with the message
[7:41] because when the Lord introduced me to
[7:43] the message he didn't introduce me just
[7:46] to a man but he introduced me to the
[7:49] word of God
[7:51] in a way that I had never seen now I was
[7:53] raised up at Pentecostal
[7:55] I was saying just a bit last night and
[7:57] what Drew is my wife and I together was
[7:58] we love going to church we love
[8:00] worshiping the Lord and and I played the
[8:02] drums and when the spirit would hit on
[8:04] me I'd get up and run the aisles or I'd
[8:05] roll the floor I'd do what whatever I
[8:08] was going to worship God
[8:10] and today I've not stopped worshiping
[8:12] God
[8:13] every once in a while I still get a
[8:15] Pentecostal Footloose going
[8:17] but let me tell you when I heard the
[8:21] word through a prophet
[8:23] now when I did all that shouting and all
[8:25] that dancing I would go out feeling I'm
[8:28] missing something
[8:30] I'm missing a part of something
[8:33] and one day
[8:35] you know we had different brothers would
[8:36] tell us about the message and and how
[8:39] that God sent a prophet and many years
[8:41] ago I was privileged to be with my
[8:43] father and
[8:45] he was meeting with brother
[8:49] Ernest Fulcher which is my wife's uncle
[8:52] and in Brother David Musgrove
[8:54] I didn't know these didn't know the man
[8:56] must grow but anyway they took my dad to
[9:00] the officer in Christiansburg and they
[9:02] began to talk to him I'm 15 years old
[9:05] never thinking I'm going to be a
[9:07] preacher
[9:08] never thinking anything
[9:10] but somehow the Lord allowed me to be
[9:13] sitting there when these men are
[9:14] introducing this Prophet to my dad
[9:18] and it just kind of just you know just
[9:20] kind of went past me
[9:21] but then some years later
[9:23] my wife's family that moved up from
[9:26] where they were at and
[9:28] she was 11 years old when they came to
[9:30] her church I believe in 1971 or 72.
[9:33] and that was my first time to see her
[9:34] and so they joined their Church
[9:37] and so it was through her parents
[9:40] talking to my father and then connecting
[9:43] them even more to brother Fulcher and
[9:46] showing us and talking about the message
[9:49] so as the message if you don't mind I
[9:51] felt like I need to give a little
[9:52] background on why I believe what I'm
[9:54] preaching
[9:56] and so
[9:57] when this happened then brothers would
[10:00] come and they'd bring stacks of books
[10:01] before iPads and all this stuff and
[10:03] they'd have stacks of books and they'd
[10:05] say brother random said brother Brown
[10:06] said brother Brown said and my dad got
[10:09] to the point because
[10:10] you know they say brother Branham said
[10:12] well they say Jesus said
[10:14] now that was the attitude we took
[10:17] but one day
[10:19] my father got soul he goes
[10:23] I'm going to prove this thing wrong
[10:26] and he started studying that thing and
[10:29] the more he tried to prove it wrong the
[10:31] writer it got
[10:33] he goes that's in the Bible
[10:36] that's in this scripture
[10:38] and the first time he preached about
[10:40] serpent seed was on a Tuesday night he
[10:43] preached for two and a half hours
[10:46] and it felt like 30 minutes
[10:48] because he was feeding us something we
[10:51] had never heard before it was the
[10:53] unveiling word of God
[10:56] and from that point my soul began to
[10:58] thirst for it but I still hadn't got
[11:00] that revelation of the Prophet myself
[11:04] I'm at home and I'm we just built a a
[11:07] new house and I'm jumping ahead of
[11:09] myself and you just forgive me
[11:12] and I'll try not to preach more in an
[11:13] hour
[11:15] but the way you're going already you're
[11:16] pulling me in a different direction I
[11:18] don't know what this is about
[11:19] I'm not even at my notes yet
[11:22] and so in 1991 I was I was sitting home
[11:25] and and my wife we just come through a
[11:28] very serious situation with my wife she
[11:31] she almost died we lost a child because
[11:33] of a doctor telling us things and and
[11:37] she almost died and and we had to make a
[11:40] big decision
[11:41] about letting the doctors take the baby
[11:44] and she was 28 years old
[11:48] and when this happened
[11:51] it shook me to my core
[11:53] this is 1988. we just built a brand new
[11:56] house
[11:57] I've got a good job
[12:00] and everything's looking lovely but now
[12:02] I have a wife who's at the point of
[12:03] death
[12:06] and I go to my father and just so
[12:07] happened brother Jackie Benton was there
[12:10] with my father preaching there and I
[12:12] went to these two men of God and I said
[12:14] look
[12:14] the doctor says if you don't take this
[12:16] baby that my wife will be dead in three
[12:18] days
[12:20] and we already have three children
[12:24] and I'm praying I said Lord what I what
[12:26] do I do
[12:27] and so these brothers Just prayed with
[12:30] me and they said
[12:32] we believe God will give you the right
[12:33] answer and whatever you decide so we
[12:36] decided to let the doctors take that
[12:37] baby
[12:40] it was one of the hardest things we've
[12:41] ever done
[12:43] it was either her life or both of their
[12:46] lives
[12:47] we don't believe in abortion
[12:50] I don't accept abortion
[12:52] but this was a different kind of
[12:54] historian
[12:55] and you forgive me if it's if you feel
[12:57] like I was wrong but I did the right
[12:59] thing
[13:00] because then God would begin to really
[13:02] reveal himself
[13:04] and because of that strain
[13:07] and all of that happened she went to a
[13:11] nervous breakdown and and then she
[13:13] couldn't eat and she lost down to 91
[13:16] pounds
[13:18] she was literally dying right in front
[13:21] of me
[13:22] and as she's just dying in front of me I
[13:25] said I looked her I said you're not
[13:26] going to die on me
[13:29] I said I'm going to make you eat or I'm
[13:31] going to pick you up and physically take
[13:32] you to the hospital they're going to put
[13:34] an IV in your arm and you're going to
[13:35] live you cannot leave me in these
[13:38] children
[13:39] and I'd look her in the face many times
[13:43] and I'd pray and I'd say now honey
[13:45] I'm not praying against you I'm praying
[13:48] against a demon that's trying to destroy
[13:50] you
[13:51] and she'll testify I'd look her right in
[13:53] the eye brother because I know the light
[13:55] of the eye is there and I begin to pray
[13:57] and I'd rebuke that devil and I'd rebuke
[13:59] him and I'd say Satan you're coming out
[14:02] and one day I was down by the by the end
[14:05] of the bed and I was praying and the
[14:06] Holy Spirit came into the room and he
[14:08] said
[14:09] she'll live
[14:10] she's going to get well
[14:13] I stopped praying I got up I walked over
[14:16] I said honey
[14:18] the Lord just testified told me that
[14:21] you're going to be okay
[14:22] she says when I said I don't know when I
[14:26] don't know where and I don't know how
[14:28] but God promised that he's going to do
[14:31] it
[14:33] and it took some months but I kept
[14:35] praying and I said Lord thank you for
[14:37] answering the prayer I wasn't asking him
[14:39] no more Lord to heal her I'm thanking
[14:41] him Lord thank you for healing her
[14:44] and she ended up in the hospital she
[14:47] ended up in an insane Hospital
[14:51] and she wanted to commit suicide I'll
[14:54] tell you
[14:56] it got darker than brighter
[15:00] but because he spoke
[15:02] I said you won't die
[15:06] and I kept testifying you're going to
[15:08] make it you're going to make it
[15:09] and the doctor told me he says the best
[15:11] thing you can do is show her love be
[15:13] with her show her love show her love
[15:15] psychiatrist people say well I don't
[15:17] believe in psychiatrists he's just the
[15:19] same as a high blood pressure doctor to
[15:20] me
[15:21] he's just the same as a heart doctor to
[15:23] me
[15:24] he's just the same as a doctor that
[15:26] tells you about your sugar diabetes he's
[15:27] the same kind of a doctor but people
[15:29] think oh that's a bad word let me tell
[15:31] you something God knows what he's doing
[15:34] and when we got there we were in front
[15:35] of this psychiatrist who was a who was a
[15:38] a Jewish man
[15:40] and my wife I remember when we were
[15:42] first go over she looked him she stood
[15:44] up and she says I don't need you and I
[15:46] don't need your medicine
[15:48] God's going to heal me
[15:51] she ended up in the hospital
[15:53] under his care
[15:56] it kept getting darker
[15:58] I walked into the hospital
[16:01] the doctor meets me in the foyer
[16:04] well in this mental hospital the rooms
[16:06] are all around the walls
[16:08] and this is like the big area where you
[16:10] greet each other and just as I'm walking
[16:12] in the doctor walks out
[16:15] he goes Mr walls
[16:18] he says I want to tell you something
[16:20] I said yesterday she's already been in
[16:21] the hospital for a week
[16:23] it's on a Monday
[16:26] he walks out
[16:28] he goes Mr walls I don't know how to
[16:29] tell you this
[16:31] he goes Something's Happened
[16:33] he goes your wife
[16:35] is completely changed
[16:38] he said it wasn't my medicine
[16:41] he said it was her faith in God
[16:45] here she is today stand up honey here
[16:47] she is today she's well
[16:53] [Applause]
[16:57] when I met this message
[17:00] I met the god of William Branham
[17:04] that can testify and tell you he's alive
[17:08] he's moving the same thing that he did
[17:11] back in that day he's still doing today
[17:13] I'm not basing this message on gifts and
[17:16] signs and miracles I didn't know
[17:18] anything about signs and miracles what I
[17:21] heard was the word of God and when I
[17:23] heard the word of God through a man like
[17:25] brother Branham it changed who I was
[17:29] I was sitting home then in 1988 after
[17:32] she's went through all of this series of
[17:34] sickness and all these series of
[17:35] problems and I'm sitting there and I'm
[17:38] reading a little article and all of a
[17:40] sudden the Holy Spirit drops in and
[17:42] reveals to me who brother Branham really
[17:45] is
[17:46] that the prophet of God is here before
[17:49] you and just as Moses spoke the fleas
[17:52] and the Flies and the frogs we got a
[17:54] prophet that can speak into the
[17:56] squirrels and speak to a storm it's the
[17:58] same God today
[18:01] because if that same God can speak to
[18:03] him he could speak to me he can speak to
[18:05] you
[18:06] let me ask you today what are you
[18:08] looking for
[18:10] he preached three kinds of believers
[18:13] he talks about the kinds of Believers
[18:15] that we're faced with and all these
[18:17] things let me tell you something when
[18:19] people say that brother Branham was a
[18:20] liar he was a false prophet that's their
[18:23] problem
[18:24] brother Paul was saying something just
[18:26] before we came out that somebody was
[18:27] saying that brother Brandon was a big
[18:29] deceiver I said well he's one of the
[18:30] best deceivers I've ever heard of
[18:32] because he's deceived me wonderful and I
[18:35] believe all of it
[18:37] because something by Revelation has
[18:40] struck my heart
[18:41] and you can't give me that God has to do
[18:45] that and when God revealed to me who
[18:48] this man was then I knew from that point
[18:50] listen we've been through all kinds of
[18:52] battles through all kinds of sicknesses
[18:54] all kinds of struggles and God has been
[18:57] there to see us through this
[18:59] nobody in Jeffersonville told me to go
[19:02] start a church in Washington D.C area
[19:04] Nobody Knows the supernatural that
[19:06] picked me up and moved me from Richmond
[19:08] Virginia to that area where I am that
[19:11] was only my friend my family and two
[19:12] other families when we started in the
[19:14] living room of a man's house that's
[19:16] another story but now there's about 300
[19:18] people gathers there I've never called
[19:20] the first person
[19:22] because God called me to the place he
[19:25] sent the people God ordains his people
[19:27] and I'm preaching to them the same
[19:29] message I'm preaching to you
[19:31] that the people are corrupting the world
[19:34] and we had a prophet saying that man
[19:36] with all his wisdom is destroying us
[19:39] and even today with all the systems and
[19:42] all the things that are happening I was
[19:44] looking out the back window of the or
[19:45] out the window of the motel and seeing
[19:47] that wonderful little river running down
[19:48] and just in 2019 my wife and I was over
[19:51] in Italy
[19:52] on our 40th anniversary and we did
[19:55] something bigger than we would normally
[19:57] do we took some time away
[19:59] and we were over there and we got them
[20:00] into Italy and not forget the name of
[20:02] the town but we were we were there we
[20:04] were riding through the canals and just
[20:06] you know and all these things they said
[20:07] when you go under the bridge you're
[20:08] supposed to kiss your bride
[20:10] there was a lot of those bridges
[20:16] I had a good time
[20:19] and the other people were like singles
[20:22] divorce
[20:24] and we're back there and we're the we're
[20:26] we're the we're the joy of the boat
[20:29] but you know when I looked through that
[20:31] little river today that's behind the
[20:32] hotel
[20:33] let down that little stream has dried up
[20:36] in Italy the streets of Italy that they
[20:39] use for water it's gone it's it's down
[20:42] to nothing
[20:43] you've seen the news you've heard the
[20:45] things and how things and even the
[20:48] scripture talks about how that the
[20:50] Euphrates river is going to be drying up
[20:52] these things are happening
[20:54] and look and then the world is is
[20:56] starving there's one of the dams out
[20:58] west that if they don't get enough water
[21:00] it controls uh electricity to six of the
[21:03] different states
[21:05] and the water's not there for them right
[21:07] now
[21:08] what's going on God is getting ready to
[21:11] destroy this Earth One More Time as it
[21:14] was in the days of Noah as it was in the
[21:16] days of Sodom of lot it's going to
[21:18] happen in this day are you ready
[21:22] so if there's three kinds of Believers
[21:24] which kind of you
[21:26] you know some of us we go here we're
[21:28] sold out
[21:30] you can't change my mind you don't know
[21:31] what I went through to get to this point
[21:34] and I see the power of God and he's
[21:36] still moving today
[21:38] and then I I look at the people who are
[21:41] make-believers I call them schizophrenic
[21:46] today they're in church hallelujah
[21:48] praise the Lord tomorrow you'll find
[21:50] them out down there running around doing
[21:51] this mess around with the wrong kind of
[21:52] people telling kind of dirty jokes but
[21:55] they know that the prophet's real they
[21:57] know the message is real but they can
[21:59] only worship him when they get into the
[22:01] presence of God their schizophrenia say
[22:03] have a dual personality
[22:07] sorry
[22:08] dual personalities
[22:11] they want to be Believers but yet when
[22:14] they get outside the influence of the
[22:15] world is pulling on them more than what
[22:18] the word is pulling on them
[22:20] they come here they want to sing in the
[22:22] choir they want to play the music and
[22:24] all these things you need people with
[22:25] the Holy Ghost
[22:30] this message is real
[22:33] I was studying a few weeks ago
[22:37] something just it just shook me brother
[22:39] Paul
[22:42] I've been I've been preaching now this
[22:44] message for 30 years better than 30
[22:46] years 31 years there at the
[22:48] in the DC area in eight years before
[22:51] that with young people
[22:55] and I come along and I I was studying
[22:59] do you realize how privileged we are
[23:03] to have this ministry
[23:05] to have this message
[23:08] I'm going to read a few things to you
[23:10] because
[23:11] I hope you don't mind
[23:13] if I believe the message then why can't
[23:16] I quote him
[23:18] and if you're going to sit there with
[23:20] doubt and disbelief
[23:22] you just do it
[23:24] you won't stop me
[23:26] there's not enough wet blankets to stop
[23:29] the unquenchable fire of God
[23:32] it can put out any water you can throw
[23:36] I tell people they say well I don't want
[23:38] to go to church with hypocrites
[23:40] I said I'd rather go to church with them
[23:42] than go to hell with them
[23:46] if I don't have enough Holy Ghost to sit
[23:49] down the side of an unbeliever and
[23:51] worship God
[23:52] then why would I let them control who I
[23:54] am
[23:55] don't be ashamed of being a real
[23:57] believer this morning let go
[24:00] let gosh of God
[24:01] we don't have to put this on we're not
[24:03] to make it up just live
[24:06] strength to be what you are we were in
[24:08] one of your restaurants the other day
[24:09] what was that name of that
[24:13] Pacos or something
[24:16] Tony Packo's if you like it good for you
[24:20] but I
[24:22] I'm not a Paco
[24:26] she wanted this she just wanted the
[24:28] experience I said okay let's just go to
[24:31] the experience
[24:33] and you get into these things and and
[24:36] and you see this stuff and we were
[24:38] sitting there and we pray to our food
[24:40] and this elderly man got up and as he
[24:42] was going out he said may I say
[24:44] something yes sir he goes it's so nice
[24:47] to see people praying
[24:51] it's so nice to see people pray you
[24:53] don't have to be ashamed
[24:56] lgbtq plus 222 23 whatever they are they
[25:01] keep adding numbers and pluses let me
[25:03] tell you something they're not going to
[25:04] stop me from worshiping God
[25:07] then they're going to stop me from
[25:08] calling the name of Jesus Christ why
[25:10] because he's my Lord and Savior
[25:17] this is something that's real to me
[25:20] and this is what I believe with all my
[25:21] heart
[25:24] brother Brandon makes a comment in the
[25:25] mark of the beast
[25:27] and he says it was this man Louis Petrus
[25:31] he says how many ever heard of him he
[25:32] said the Stockholm Church in Sweden he
[25:34] said wonderful brother
[25:36] he said to me brother Branham the Jews
[25:39] has always believed their Prophets
[25:42] said if you just go down to Israel
[25:47] I said fine that looks good to me
[25:51] brother brand I'm saying fine that looks
[25:53] good to me I'll go down there
[25:56] he continues on and he says he's given
[25:59] millions of Testaments
[26:01] he said they read from the back to the
[26:02] front
[26:03] he said they read them New Testaments he
[26:06] said and asked them Jews they said why
[26:10] you come home to bring your pop and Mama
[26:12] to that's blind and sick and packing
[26:14] them in and says come to the Homeland to
[26:16] die
[26:18] they said we come to see the Messiah
[26:23] he's preaching this in 1961.
[26:27] he's telling this story 1961. he said
[26:30] brother don't worry Gentile your days is
[26:33] just about over
[26:34] he says let me warn you in the name of
[26:37] the Lord the Gentile door is closing
[26:41] just as certain as I'm standing here
[26:43] Jesus said the muhammadans there would
[26:46] tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until
[26:48] the Gentile dispensation be finished
[26:51] and fulfilled
[26:52] there she is Israel in her Homeland a
[26:55] nation with her own Army and her own
[26:57] money
[26:59] she's full
[27:01] she's a full Nation now the Fig Tree is
[27:03] putting forth its buds and already
[27:05] butted out
[27:08] brother Mike what's this got to do with
[27:09] the
[27:11] value of a covenant
[27:14] just give me time I at my church I've
[27:16] been preaching this in a series
[27:20] and so my my mind's running to all
[27:22] all my different messages
[27:26] and brother Brandon's coming along and
[27:27] he's beginning to tell these things
[27:30] he said and when they got there he said
[27:32] they give them the New Testaments he
[27:34] said
[27:35] absolutely Petrus
[27:38] he goes they read the New Testament
[27:40] about what Jesus was
[27:43] they never heard about him they said if
[27:47] this be the Messiah then he's not dead
[27:52] they're reading the New Testament now
[27:54] this man's getting the Bibles into their
[27:56] hands
[27:58] you with me okay
[27:59] he goes we believe our Prophets
[28:02] and the Messiah will be a prophet
[28:06] let us see him do the sign of the
[28:08] Messiah a prophet and we'll believe him
[28:12] is the messiah
[28:14] oh what a perfect setup just perfect I
[28:17] said Lord let me go
[28:20] brother branham's caring and he knows
[28:22] he's carrying the sign of the Messiah
[28:27] in his ministry he's carrying that sign
[28:31] and he comes along he says and when I
[28:34] when I got up in Cairo Egypt
[28:38] he said just before we met
[28:40] the king Pharaoh he said at Rome he said
[28:44] then we went down at Cairo Egypt I had
[28:47] my ticket in my hand to go
[28:49] I went up and they they didn't call the
[28:51] flight and the Holy Spirit spoke and
[28:53] said not now
[28:56] this man's on his way to Israel
[28:59] to show them the sign of a prophet the
[29:02] sign of Messiah
[29:04] and the Holy Spirit tells him not now
[29:07] he said this is not the hour yet
[29:10] more gleaning to do
[29:13] brother Branham says I couldn't hardly
[29:15] believe it
[29:17] can you imagine he knows who he is
[29:21] he knows what he has and he knows what
[29:24] he can do with it
[29:26] do you know that yourself
[29:28] do you know who you are do you know what
[29:31] you can do with this message do you know
[29:34] what you can do with this power of God
[29:36] can you understand that the Holy Ghost
[29:38] wants to lead you and guide you into all
[29:40] truth and all righteousness he wants to
[29:43] do this
[29:44] and he says I couldn't hardly believe it
[29:47] I'm thinking
[29:49] thank God
[29:51] that God didn't let him go
[29:55] what if brother random would have went
[29:57] there it would have been finished
[29:58] friends
[29:59] but God wouldn't let him go he said
[30:01] there's more gleaning to do here I am
[30:03] today here you are today if he hadn't
[30:05] went then we wouldn't be here today it
[30:08] would be over already
[30:10] but God said I've got more people I've
[30:13] got gleaning to do you can't go now but
[30:16] this man knew I can go and they will
[30:18] accept it and it would have been done oh
[30:20] thank God he waited for me
[30:22] thank God he waited for you without that
[30:25] Revelation friends we would be going out
[30:27] of here
[30:30] we wouldn't have had a chance
[30:32] brother Branham comes into this place
[30:34] realizing he could go and he says I
[30:36] couldn't believe it
[30:38] God wouldn't let me go
[30:41] and he said but this is not the time yet
[30:44] he said I went up behind the hangar God
[30:47] is my judge and I prayed and I knelt
[30:49] down and I said Heavenly Father
[30:52] just another hour or two and I'll be in
[30:55] Palestine
[30:57] I'll challenge those Jews those Jews and
[31:00] say did you say that if the Messiah be
[31:03] the true Messiah let him let him see him
[31:06] do it do the sign of the prophet and
[31:09] you'll believe him
[31:10] he said I'll go down and ask them these
[31:12] questions
[31:13] didn't you say that you would believe
[31:14] your Prophet the Messiah
[31:17] he was going to challenge him to this
[31:19] can you imagine this man knowing his
[31:22] position could have easily done it
[31:24] except
[31:25] almighty God
[31:27] was watching over
[31:29] while he was on the cross
[31:31] we was on his mind
[31:33] he knew that there had to be a voice
[31:36] speak to us and pull us
[31:39] into the presence of the Holy Ghost just
[31:41] like brother Branham was pulled into
[31:42] that presence
[31:45] he said
[31:48] he said get a Jew to promise you he said
[31:52] he will keep his word he said now if
[31:54] that's the Messiah of the Bible
[31:56] then he was a prophet and he is still a
[32:00] prophet now if he does the sign of
[32:02] Messiah will you believe him
[32:06] he's saying that's what I'm going to say
[32:07] to these Jews
[32:09] will you believe him and he knew
[32:11] he could do it he said right on the same
[32:13] grounds say select yourself a group of
[32:16] men
[32:17] and said look he wasn't afraid to
[32:19] challenge
[32:21] he wasn't afraid to stand and and talk
[32:23] about what God was
[32:26] he said
[32:27] you you can choose some men and and set
[32:29] them out here somewhere find out whether
[32:32] it's the profit or yet or not he said
[32:36] let them see it be done he said then
[32:38] write on them sane grounds where your
[32:41] father's forefathers rejected the Holy
[32:42] Ghost he said a Jew took it to the
[32:45] Gentile here is a here a gentile
[32:48] bringing it back to the Jew
[32:50] do you hear what he's saying he said I
[32:53] could do this
[32:55] but thank God the holy spirit said you
[32:58] don't do this
[32:59] he stopped him he pulled him back a
[33:02] little bit he said so the Gentile can
[33:04] bring it back to the Jew he says and
[33:05] when that Jew receives the gospel
[33:09] the Gentile days are finished but he
[33:13] wouldn't let me go
[33:15] Hallelujah
[33:18] some of you weren't even thought about
[33:21] in 1961.
[33:24] I was six years old at that point
[33:28] many of you weren't even born yet
[33:31] but because of
[33:33] The Watch
[33:34] knew that it was going to have a people
[33:36] come on the scene that the Earth had to
[33:38] be in a worse condition
[33:40] but the Covenant that he gave to Noah
[33:43] was going to be standing in this day he
[33:46] said I do set my bowl in the sky as a
[33:49] covenant to the Earth that I'll never
[33:50] destroy it again with water so today now
[33:53] they're thirsting for water and there's
[33:55] not enough water
[33:57] bye look what's happening he's not going
[34:01] to destroy it with the water but yet
[34:03] it's being destroyed because there's no
[34:05] water
[34:08] and people are looking and wondering
[34:09] what's going on and and they say well
[34:11] it's global warming
[34:14] okay
[34:16] and why is a global warming because man
[34:18] has made so many things so much industry
[34:21] put up so much stuff and polluted The
[34:24] Heirs and destroyed so many things
[34:26] that's what's destroyed and brother
[34:28] Branham said this man destroying himself
[34:33] I see this message More Alive more now
[34:35] than I ever did
[34:38] the more I studied the more like
[34:40] I'm just beginning to scratch the
[34:42] surface again
[34:44] these things are just so powerful and
[34:47] and I I don't I don't read it just to
[34:50] have something to read
[34:52] I read it because there's an inspiration
[34:54] behind this
[34:56] listen brother Branham we all know he
[34:59] wasn't re-educated
[35:01] but that's not what God's looking at
[35:03] he's not looking at your education he's
[35:05] not looking at phds
[35:07] look I've got a 12th grade education
[35:10] and I just made it by the skin of my
[35:12] teeth
[35:13] but in our church we got about five or
[35:15] six people that's got phds
[35:18] and I'm preaching to them
[35:22] and I'm like
[35:24] this has to be God
[35:28] because I'm not worthy to do such a
[35:30] thing but God knows I ain't got no
[35:31] better sense than to tell the truth
[35:33] preach what's there
[35:36] preach what's the truth tell the people
[35:37] what's exactly going around
[35:41] brother Brandon said the prophet is a
[35:43] special man
[35:44] a prophet is a man who whom the word of
[35:46] the Lord comes to
[35:48] because the prophet is so designed that
[35:51] life that his subconscious and his
[35:53] conscience is so close together that he
[35:56] doesn't go to sleep to dream his dream
[35:58] he sees it when he's wide awake
[36:01] a prophet foresees way off
[36:05] brother man told us things that happened
[36:07] in 1933 when God gave him a vision of
[36:09] seven things happening remember that
[36:12] and he tells us she starts telling us
[36:14] all these different things that are
[36:15] going to happen and all the day look
[36:17] there's people saying brother made this
[36:19] up and Brethren hey I'm going to tell
[36:20] you something
[36:21] when he made the comments
[36:24] that the Lord showed him seven things in
[36:27] 1933.
[36:28] remember when I came to the message I
[36:31] didn't know anything about the cloud
[36:33] I didn't know anything about any of that
[36:35] stuff all I heard was the word of God
[36:39] the word is what drew me to this message
[36:42] and then when I heard about the clout
[36:45] and one day I was able to go to Arizona
[36:49] my wife and I we got to travel out I
[36:51] believe it was 96 97 and we went to
[36:54] Arizona and was able to go to Sunset
[36:55] mountain and I didn't know that brother
[36:57] Brown's profile was on the end of the
[36:59] mountain have you ever been there see
[37:01] that
[37:03] I got the picture of my Bible
[37:06] your face is not out there
[37:10] you don't have to wonder is it like
[37:11] brother Branham
[37:13] you can see that it looks like brother
[37:16] Branham
[37:17] and I took a picture of it myself
[37:19] because I was in such awe I thought wow
[37:23] so now here's More The Lord's just
[37:25] adding to me now giving me more benefits
[37:28] well in 1996
[37:30] things you know they change card designs
[37:33] now I'm a car guy
[37:35] I like cars I like trucks I like things
[37:37] with motors
[37:39] I like challenges
[37:42] and but I like old stuff you know and
[37:45] and when when things happen when the car
[37:47] show comes to DC me and my brother and
[37:49] some of the brothers in church will go
[37:50] to the DC car show and we'll see all the
[37:52] new technologies we'll see you don't
[37:54] want to see all this
[37:56] he said brother you're a bane
[37:59] okay
[38:02] I don't hunt and I don't fish
[38:06] I tell my grandkids I said I'm a Hunter
[38:08] they said well I said when I see a four
[38:10] cell sign
[38:13] I'll be driving down the road and I'll
[38:15] just catch my eye and I thought I'll
[38:16] mark that
[38:19] and now my grandkids go and and I was
[38:22] playing my grandkids and they said I
[38:23] said somebody it's like a magnet starts
[38:26] pulling me come take a look take a look
[38:29] my grandson years will be riding with me
[38:31] now and say grandpa don't look don't
[38:33] look it's got a four cell sign
[38:40] I was
[38:41] 19 1996 they changed the body style of
[38:45] the Ford Taurus
[38:47] what's this got to do anything
[38:49] Prophet said
[38:50] in 1933 that cars would become more like
[38:53] an egg did he say it
[38:56] did he say that
[38:58] what does a prophet do he sees far off
[39:02] now he said they had some cars in his
[39:04] day
[39:06] but I want to tell you something that
[39:07] happened in my day
[39:10] it's thus said the Lord being fulfilled
[39:13] and I I just happened to see this new
[39:15] Ford Taurus and I said man that thing
[39:17] looks like an egg
[39:19] and sure enough it had ovals here and
[39:22] ovals there
[39:25] and so my oldest son at the time was 15
[39:27] years old now he is
[39:30] thank God he's told me the other day he
[39:33] said Dad I'm not as adventurous as I
[39:35] used to be
[39:36] I mean he was like one of these living
[39:38] on the edge kind of guys
[39:40] Daredevil
[39:42] he's going down this hill
[39:44] close to our house and another young man
[39:46] from our church and he's going so fast
[39:48] and there's a tree about this big around
[39:50] about four inches round and his pedal
[39:53] catches the tree
[39:55] need I say more
[39:58] he broke his nose
[40:00] his collarbone
[40:01] and part of his thumb I believe it was
[40:04] he got hurt really bad
[40:07] and that was all because the Lord wanted
[40:09] to show me something
[40:11] we're sitting in the doctor's office and
[40:14] as I'm sitting there I pick up AAA
[40:16] magazine
[40:18] well guess what it's got in the front of
[40:19] car
[40:21] and so I start filming through this
[40:22] magazine while he's back there with the
[40:24] doctor
[40:25] and I'm like yeah man this is really
[40:27] this is really neat I like this magazine
[40:31] and I'm looking through
[40:33] I'm like
[40:34] look at this
[40:36] you know brother Branham said he even
[40:38] said this he said a 1931 Ford or 33 Ford
[40:42] wouldn't look like an egg
[40:44] did you all know he said that
[40:46] you remember if go back and read it
[40:50] I've got the quotes on but I'm not the
[40:51] real that but he said it wouldn't even
[40:53] look like
[40:55] an egg-shaped to me
[40:57] but just so happened when I turned the
[40:59] page
[41:01] I see the 1996 Ford Taurus and it says
[41:03] the egg and you
[41:06] now here's a prophet seizes back in
[41:09] 1933.
[41:10] and now they're saying the egg and you
[41:12] let's just get a bit let's get a little
[41:14] closer
[41:15] it says the new egg shaped
[41:19] what did he say
[41:21] now this happened to me friends
[41:23] you can't tell me that this man just
[41:26] happened to be lucky
[41:29] no I've got the evidence
[41:32] right here that what a prophet said
[41:35] on original magazine it says the egg
[41:38] shaped Taurus the new egg-shaped Taurus
[41:41] the egg in you
[41:42] and I've I've often said now I wish I'd
[41:45] have bought me a 96 Ford and if I see
[41:46] one if anybody sees a 1996 Ford Taurus
[41:50] and it's white
[41:51] bring it to me
[41:54] tell me where it is I'll come get it
[41:57] and then I'm gonna paint the top of it
[41:59] yellow
[42:02] and be sunny side up
[42:07] that sounds funny but right here it says
[42:10] it
[42:10] and just so happens on the other page
[42:13] to put the words of the prophet in
[42:16] context they put a 31 Fort which looks
[42:19] like a 33 Ford right across from the
[42:23] same page tell me that God doesn't honor
[42:26] his prophet's words
[42:28] tell me that he doesn't know what he's
[42:30] talking about
[42:31] this ministry we got is more than just a
[42:34] man walking up there it was something
[42:36] that ignited his soul and the Covenant
[42:39] that he made with Abraham when Isaac and
[42:41] Jacob and Moses and Elijah and all these
[42:44] different ones that Covenant today is so
[42:47] valuable to us because we now have the
[42:49] evidence of the Holy Ghost the token
[42:53] where did you ever hear that at before
[42:54] token a prophet comes along Exodus
[42:57] chapter 12 verse 12 starts talking about
[43:00] how that you're going to have a token
[43:02] and you're going to apply the blood let
[43:03] me tell you something you got to apply
[43:05] this Blood of the words into your souls
[43:07] and don't be a don't be a schizophrenic
[43:10] believer today
[43:12] when you go out here today say I'm
[43:14] committed to God
[43:15] that he's shown me something
[43:18] we've got something more than what the
[43:20] world wants to offer us listen truly sin
[43:23] is just a pleasure for a season but the
[43:26] power and the glory of God is for
[43:28] eternity
[43:30] my wife and I we have such peace with
[43:32] each other we don't have to worry about
[43:34] it this one's going to run on this if
[43:35] I'm going around on hers you can run on
[43:37] me I work with men and when my wife went
[43:39] in through that deep depression and she
[43:42] suffered so many things I I showed her
[43:44] all the love I could I let my my
[43:46] children with my my mother-in-law and my
[43:48] mom and and I just stayed with her as
[43:51] much as they could
[43:52] and how that it was such a thing and
[43:55] then the men I was working with one
[43:57] man's wife she came into depression and
[43:59] he divorced her
[44:01] just because she went to depression
[44:04] and I'll tell you what that's not love
[44:07] that's selfishness
[44:10] let me tell you something when you marry
[44:11] somebody you marry them for real love I
[44:14] told them last night you can do we can
[44:16] have all kinds of talking about marriage
[44:18] and all that but the only way that's
[44:19] going to keep our marriage together is
[44:21] real love
[44:22] and the only way that's going to keep
[44:24] you in line with this message is really
[44:26] loving God and serving God and he'll
[44:29] show you how to make it through all
[44:30] these things that we're going through
[44:31] this is the day that we've got something
[44:33] more powerful than what the the
[44:35] sanctuaries of the religious lives have
[44:37] we got something that's greater than all
[44:39] of that and it's the power of this word
[44:41] we have
[44:43] and God has hidden it from so many
[44:44] people but yet he's chosen to let some
[44:47] of us see something that's so real
[44:48] listen I don't care if people condemn me
[44:51] it doesn't matter they don't know where
[44:52] they never walked in my shoes they'd
[44:55] never been where I've been so they won't
[44:57] understand why I can believe and preach
[44:58] a message like this
[45:01] it's not just about William Branham it's
[45:03] about you and me
[45:05] he came to give his life for the message
[45:07] the Gospel of Jesus Christ that he might
[45:09] give it to you and me
[45:12] and what did he say he said the young
[45:14] ministers sweep it on
[45:17] to the coming of the Lord
[45:19] all these different things are going to
[45:21] happen
[45:22] we're Solomon
[45:24] you're in trouble come here
[45:28] how many struggles in life have you ever
[45:30] faced
[45:33] we have faced death my wife and I faced
[45:35] to death
[45:37] just stand right there buddy
[45:41] I'm going to ask you a question what is
[45:43] this
[45:46] you sure
[45:48] you're sure
[45:53] you know what
[45:56] God knows the value
[45:59] of Who You Are
[46:01] it can make you a penny
[46:03] a nickel dying quarter or 100 bill
[46:09] and you're going to be tested
[46:11] and you're going to be tried
[46:14] you're going to be thrown to the ground
[46:17] you're going to be stepped on
[46:19] you're going to be twisted around
[46:22] and people think I'm going to stop
[46:25] them from believing that God
[46:29] you take this you take this the hundred
[46:32] dollar bill
[46:34] let me ask you something
[46:38] it's still a hundred dollar bill isn't
[46:39] it
[46:41] now this crispy
[46:44] it looks kind of used up
[46:48] but has it lost its value
[46:53] no matter what you go through
[46:56] no matter what you go through
[46:58] you're going to be crushed
[47:01] you're going to be walked on
[47:02] but you never lose your value
[47:07] you never lose your value
[47:10] you see but I can't make it but God said
[47:13] I bought you
[47:14] God said I paid the price
[47:17] and you never lose your value it's not
[47:19] about how you feel it's not about how
[47:21] you look it's about what you know is
[47:23] inside of your soul it's the value of
[47:26] the token of Jesus Christ
[47:31] here's your first wedding gift
[47:34] don't you ever forget that buddy
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:39] thank you
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:43] never forget the value that God placed
[47:46] into Who You Are
[47:49] you see but my marriage I'm struggling
[47:50] with my marriage God knows the value he
[47:53] placed in that marriage he knows the
[47:56] person he lets you be joined to today
[47:58] friend let him know that you cherish the
[48:01] value of your marriage the Covenant that
[48:03] you made a marriage covenant is to death
[48:06] do you part and I'll tell you what that
[48:08] devil will come to try to destroy that
[48:10] parting part
[48:12] he'll try to make you think well I can't
[48:14] make it you can make it
[48:16] listen there's a lot of brothers that's
[48:18] got the Holy Ghost
[48:19] and we're all human beings here listen
[48:21] the only thing that makes us different
[48:23] from the Baptist
[48:24] and the Pentecostals and the methodists
[48:26] as we receive the Holy Ghost by the
[48:28] message of the hour not just by the
[48:30] message but try to understand me now we
[48:32] received a message that God gave us the
[48:35] Holy Ghost to receive it by is that
[48:37] better
[48:38] the message didn't give me the Holy
[48:40] Ghost
[48:41] it can't do it God gives the Holy Ghost
[48:44] just try to understand him but he
[48:46] reveals to us something that's happening
[48:48] but there's a lot of men that have a
[48:51] have a holy ghost in them but they don't
[48:53] know how to talk to their wives
[48:55] they don't know how to talk to their
[48:57] children
[48:59] yet they love the Lord they love the
[49:00] message
[49:01] and they're so busy working with the let
[49:03] me tell you why because I was one of
[49:05] them
[49:06] I got so busy working doing this and
[49:08] working doing that and helping this
[49:09] brother and helping this brother my wife
[49:11] was home suffering when are you going to
[49:13] spend some time with us
[49:16] I was busy helping the brothers I was
[49:18] busy helping the the church and I you
[49:20] know there's a time in the season for
[49:21] all things but Brothers Nate you need to
[49:23] pay attention when your wife starts
[49:25] telling you I'm missing you
[49:27] one thing my wife forgot to say last
[49:29] night when she cut me down so low to the
[49:31] stump

[49:39] I'll tell you what when you come to
[49:40] become a Christian when you come here to
[49:42] to serve the Lord what are you here for

[50:10] the value of who you are today but he
[50:13] looks good and says I'll meet your needs
[50:15] I walk into where you are I'll go with
[50:18] you through your suffering but you're
[50:19] going to suffer
[50:21] because my bridegroom he said he learned
[50:24] obedience by the things that he suffered
[50:26] and brothers and sisters when you are
[50:28] learned that you've suffered through
[50:29] something then see what God's trying to
[50:31] show you on the other side of that
[50:33] don't you say oh it's me oh it's me say
[50:36] Lord what is it you want to show me
[50:41] when we see these things happening
[50:43] he knows that the value
[50:46] of the Covenant

[51:00] we love the Lord first
[51:03] we love the Lord
[51:05] we cherish because he brought us
[51:07] together
[51:09] I'm not looking for a replacement
[51:12] I'm not looking for somebody to fill in
[51:14] her spot I'm not looking for a younger
[51:16] model
[51:21] shame on these preachers
[51:24] I will not
[51:26] meet with a woman
[51:28] alone
[51:30] my wife's either going to be with me or
[51:32] the Deacon or another sister there's
[51:34] going to be three of us it's never going
[51:35] to be me in that one
[51:37] Brethren let me tell you something if
[51:39] you've got the Holy Ghost you begin to
[51:40] build a hedge around your spiritual life
[51:43] as God put a hedge around around job and
[51:46] all these things and the devil said Lord
[51:48] move the heads back let me tell you
[51:49] something you keep the Hedge as close as
[51:51] you can our hedge is the Holy Ghost
[51:54] and he's able to watch over you and to
[51:56] lead you through when the Trials come he
[51:58] said I'll go with you
[52:00] and he said I'll even be in you
[52:02] oh but we've got to trust him
[52:05] that the value
[52:07] Covenant
[52:09] as we're staying with it
[52:13] when she was on her deathbed
[52:15] and me looking at those little eyes
[52:18] she couldn't take it
[52:21] I said Lord
[52:23] I walked in that new house that we had
[52:25] just built
[52:26] we hadn't even moved in yet
[52:29] I walked in the front door
[52:32] I said Lord
[52:34] you can have it
[52:36] you can have this house
[52:38] you can have everything I own
[52:40] I said I'll serve you to whatever you
[52:43] want me to do but give her back to me
[52:46] not realizing I would have to sell that
[52:49] house I would have to leave that job but
[52:51] that security and I'd have to move north
[52:53] two hours and take on the job driving a
[52:56] bus
[52:57] to support my family a school bus
[53:04] somebody said what do you do for a
[53:05] living I said I'm a pastor of the church
[53:07] I said what'd you do wrong
[53:08] you pass your church and you drive a
[53:10] school bus
[53:14] I said
[53:15] prove him in All Things
[53:18] but let me tell you something I use that
[53:19] school bus as an opportunity
[53:22] to talk to children who would not listen
[53:24] to their parents but would listen to the
[53:26] bus driver
[53:28] now I wasn't supposed to give them sodas
[53:30] but I give them sodas
[53:35] I wasn't supposed to give them candy but
[53:37] I gave him candy
[53:40] so happens one day there was a little
[53:42] girl she was having trouble she was
[53:44] mostly mostly Disturbed and having
[53:47] issues and I saw her jump and drop kick
[53:50] her mom in the front hallway of the
[53:52] school and the principal grabs that
[53:54] young lady by the hair of the head and
[53:56] drags her out to the outside and puts
[53:59] her outside and they've called the
[54:00] police on a little 12 year old girl
[54:03] the next thing I know this little girl
[54:05] she's so obsessed she walks out in late
[54:07] sits right down in the middle of the
[54:09] street
[54:12] that was my child
[54:14] I said Lord God
[54:17] and I walked out there I'd made friends
[54:19] with her little kid
[54:21] I said listen I said why are you here
[54:24] she goes
[54:25] they don't like me
[54:27] they hate me
[54:29] I said well you know I'm your friend
[54:31] right
[54:32] she says yes sir
[54:34] I said well then you come with me
[54:36] and let's just walk over here behind the
[54:37] buses well they can't see you
[54:39] okay there's bus drivers all around and
[54:43] my supervisor was sitting in the bus
[54:45] on the road protecting the little girl
[54:47] so nobody could pass through
[54:49] and I talked to her and got her out of
[54:51] that street
[54:53] when I got her out of the street they
[54:55] said what did you do to her
[54:57] I said I was her friend
[55:02] try to introduce him to Jesus Christ I
[55:04] try to let them know that there's
[55:05] something more
[55:07] than what this world's got to offer them
[55:08] brothers and sisters this life is to
[55:10] live every day I'm not going to be a
[55:12] schizophrenic
[55:17] I've dealt with people that has that
[55:19] personality
[55:21] and I'll tell you what they're hard to
[55:22] deal with
[55:23] I've had somebody in my church that was
[55:25] a schizophrenic and they were hard to
[55:26] deal with one day they're so wonderful
[55:28] and they're great and they can't help it
[55:30] they really can't help that but some
[55:32] people can help what you're doing
[55:35] but let me tell you something God
[55:36] doesn't forget who you are
[55:39] he lists the value
[55:40] of the Covenant

[59:02] the message brother Brandon said the
[59:04] message was Jesus Christ revealed in you
[59:08] it wasn't revealed in brother Branham it
[59:10] was revealed in Jesus Christ yet he was

[59:29] fired over this I said I could care less
[59:31] if they put something up there and blow
[59:34] it up around and it made the head of
[59:36] Christ it doesn't matter to me I believe
[59:38] it anyway

[59:45] listen brother Brandon was a man I'm a
[59:48] man you're a man listen we're all human
[59:49] beings I don't see no angels in here
[59:51] today
[59:55] and we are all challenged by the same
[59:57] devil
[59:58] and if you've got the Holy Ghost we're
[59:59] all led by the same Holy Ghost
[1:00:01] so the same God
[1:00:03] that was with this Prophet is with us
[1:00:07] this bride is going to be the
[1:00:09] manifestation of Jesus Christ not the
[1:00:11] manifestation of William Branham
[1:00:13] she is to be the manifestation of Jesus
[1:00:16] Christ she is him
[1:00:19] because if he lives inside of you then
[1:00:21] it's no longer you but it's the Holy
[1:00:23] Ghost of Supernatural living inside of
[1:00:25] us
[1:00:28] don't you want to be close to the
[1:00:30] Covenant
[1:00:32] don't you realize the value
[1:00:34] of the Covenant that you carrying
[1:00:38] wow
[1:00:40] and he saw you
[1:00:43] and he gave it to you
[1:00:46] could the musicians come
[1:00:54] brother Brandon said
[1:00:56] brother Mike brother Paul says he wants
[1:00:58] you to be at home
[1:00:59] last night brother Paul said brother
[1:01:01] Mike just be at home
[1:01:03] I felt really good thank you
[1:01:06] wonderful spirit of God here
[1:01:10] I told my wife I said
[1:01:12] after I get Brother Paul's I'm not
[1:01:13] taking any more speaking engagements
[1:01:17] I do not like traveling
[1:01:20] to preach I like traveling but not to
[1:01:23] preach
[1:01:26] and I'm serious
[1:01:27] I am a nervous wreck when it comes to it
[1:01:30] God put me in a church
[1:01:33] that's where he told me the pastor and
[1:01:35] I'm happy in my place
[1:01:37] and I don't need to try to become an
[1:01:40] evangelist pastor
[1:01:41] I'd rather pay and I support evangelists
[1:01:45] and I bring evangelists to my church
[1:01:48] because they're part of the ministry
[1:01:50] now I have pastors come through and
[1:01:52] there's nothing wrong with that but if
[1:01:54] they make it a habit I got a problem
[1:01:55] with that
[1:01:58] but when I see that these abandons we're
[1:02:00] supposed to have the vanishes they get
[1:02:02] get on get them on the on the road
[1:02:05] keep them going
[1:02:07] we got a lot of good Brothers young
[1:02:09] ministers that are coming up
[1:02:12] I went to Brother Jason Watkins first
[1:02:15] Youth Camp back in 21 in October 21 and
[1:02:19] I was the oldest Pastor there
[1:02:23] like what happened
[1:02:26] when I hit 67 this year I'm like
[1:02:29] where is time gone
[1:02:31] we hit 44 years of marriage at the end
[1:02:33] of March
[1:02:35] and it seemed like it just happened
[1:02:38] but four children and 11 grandchildren
[1:02:40] later
[1:02:41] we are living it up
[1:02:44] we're busier now we were when we were
[1:02:46] starting out
[1:02:47] but we're having a great time
[1:02:50] I'm going to just sing this little
[1:02:51] portion of a song and if you know what
[1:02:52] you can sing with me
[1:02:55] before he knew me yet he loved me
[1:02:58] I'm not sure what key do you know what
[1:02:59] key I sing she's she hasn't played in
[1:03:01] the piano so long

[1:03:12] down and hit a few chords
[1:03:15] and brother Paul says we'll just sing
[1:03:16] acapella
[1:03:20] and I was thinking
[1:03:22] I probably shouldn't even try to sing
[1:03:26] but just this song
[1:03:28] came to my heart
[1:03:30] and I don't see it because I can sing I
