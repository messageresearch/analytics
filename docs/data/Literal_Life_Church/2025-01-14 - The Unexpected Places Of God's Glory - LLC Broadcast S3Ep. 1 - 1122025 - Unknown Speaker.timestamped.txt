[3:19] [Music]
[3:24] Tong your
[3:26] ways are so much High higher than
[3:33] [Music]
[3:37] mine your ways are
[3:41] higher than
[3:50] mine I'm in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse
[3:54] 6 but one in a certain place
[3:58] testified saying what is man that thou
[4:00] art mindful of him or the son of man
[4:03] that thou visited him and so he's
[4:06] referring to Psalms chapter 8 and we'll
[4:09] go there just in a minute Paul in
[4:11] Hebrews is referring back to what David
[4:13] said in Psalms chapter 8 but it says
[4:16] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[4:18] or the son of man that thou Vis visitest
[4:21] him thou mest him a little lower than
[4:23] the Angels thou crownest him with glory
[4:27] and honor and did set him over the The
[4:29] Works of thy hands thou Hast put all
[4:33] things in subjection under his feet for
[4:35] in that he put all in subjection under
[4:38] him he left nothing that is not put
[4:41] under him but now we see not yet all
[4:44] things put under him but we see Jesus
[4:48] who was made a little lower than the
[4:50] angels for the suffering and so this is
[4:53] quite amazing because he's just spoken
[4:55] of crown and glory and uh this is uh
[4:58] being mindful of his son coming and
[5:01] fulfilling something here and we've
[5:04] we've seen thou crownest him with glory
[5:07] and honor and then this word suffering
[5:09] comes in thou was made lower than the
[5:11] angels for the suffering of death
[5:14] crowned with Glory and Honor that he by
[5:17] the grace of God should taste death for
[5:20] every man for it became him for whom all
[5:24] are all things and by whom are all
[5:26] things in bringing many sons unto glory
[5:30] to make the captain of their salvation
[5:33] perfect through sufferings I'd like to
[5:36] point out that whatever suffering his
[5:39] son went through here it was for the
[5:41] benefit and the life of many sons after
[5:45] that to come to glory and if he hadn't
[5:48] come through that suffering we would not
[5:50] be able to come to that Glory so there
[5:53] was a suffering but God was in the God's
[5:56] glory was in the suffering and he turned
[5:59] the the evil towards good so let's go
[6:02] quickly let's go because Paul referred
[6:04] to Psalms 8 let's go back there and read
[6:06] that before we jump into uh the rest of
[6:09] this he refers back to something uh
[6:11] David says here in Psalms it's very has
[6:13] quite a a wonderful mystery to it and
[6:16] this term uh what is man is three or
[6:19] four other places in the Bible where he
[6:21] says what is man that thou art mind for
[6:24] him or what is man job says it a couple
[6:26] of time what is man uh because when you
[6:29] look at we're nothing and then God
[6:31] chooses us to place us in a position as
[6:35] sons and daughters that we would have
[6:37] never expected remember we fell in the
[6:39] garden when they fell we all fell with
[6:42] them and so Sons lost their position in
[6:45] place of Glory as Adam held we fell from
[6:48] that and we all fell with it and so now
[6:51] we when we look at the glory of angels
[6:53] and the glory of Heaven and the
[6:55] atmosphere and the Majesty of the
[6:57] firmament and everything he's created
[6:59] ated and then all of a sudden God
[7:01] chooses to choose man to bring the most
[7:04] of his glory through that's why the term
[7:07] comes what is man that you would be
[7:10] mindful of him that's the kind of
[7:11] humility that we
[7:13] need can you say Amen uh we're nothing
[7:16] without him so we would be saying that
[7:19] what is man who am I the song says who
[7:21] am I that I would be worthy to receive
[7:24] these benefits so he says here in Psalms
[7:26] 8 if you'd like to read with me uh how
[7:29] it's it's worded here Psalms chapter 8
[7:31] and uh just at the beginning oh Lord our
[7:34] Lord how excellent is thy name in all
[7:36] the Earth who has set thy Glory above
[7:38] the heavens out of the mouth of babes
[7:41] and sucklings thou has ordained strength
[7:43] because of thine enemies that thou
[7:45] mightest steal the enemy and the Avenger
[7:47] when I consider thy heavens and the work
[7:50] of thy fingers the moon and the stars
[7:53] which thou has ordained how many know
[7:55] you can see God's glory in all of that
[7:57] you can see God's manifestation and he's
[8:00] looking at it and saying when I see how
[8:01] great all that is the heavens and the
[8:03] work of thy fingers he says in verse
[8:05] four what is man that thou art mindful
[8:08] of him or the son of man that thou
[8:10] visitest him so what the son of man
[8:13] refers to of course we know it as a
[8:15] prophet but what is man what is the son
[8:17] of man that you would visit a prophet
[8:19] what what is it that you would so use a
[8:21] prophet verse five for thou has made him
[8:24] a little lower than the angels and has
[8:27] crowned him with Glory and Honor
[8:30] thou mest him to have dominion over the
[8:33] works of thy hands that thou Hast put
[8:35] all things under his feet all sheep and
[8:38] oxen yay and the Beast of the field the
[8:40] fowl of the air and the fish of the sea
[8:43] and whatsoever passeth through the paths
[8:45] of the seas oh Lord our Lord how
[8:47] excellent is thy name in all the Earth
[8:49] what is man that thou mind for him this
[8:51] is where Adam fell from is the glory of
[8:53] the Lord so filled this man that he had
[8:56] he had dominion and God put the whole
[9:00] earth under his charge and his Dominion
[9:02] he took care of things he was in charge
[9:04] of it and he was a minor God on Earth
[9:07] God poured his glory into them that he
[9:09] could have that kind of power he what is
[9:12] man that thou crownest him with that
[9:14] kind of Glory he had all of his angels
[9:16] He had all the all the ones worshiping
[9:18] him he had all the ones but yet he
[9:20] creates man on Earth and he puts him in
[9:22] charge of all of it and gives him his
[9:25] glory to be able to do it what is man
[9:27] that thou are mindful of him that's an
[9:29] amazing aming thing then man falls and
[9:32] Paul's bringing it up in Hebrews saying
[9:34] we can use the same scripture because
[9:36] now we have our Lord who was made a
[9:39] little lower than the Angels crowned
[9:41] with power and Glory but he goes into it
[9:44] here and he says but not without going
[9:47] through a great time of suffering the
[9:49] unexpected places that we see God's
[9:52] glory and I want to get into that a
[9:54] little bit now I want to go back to 2
[9:56] Corinthians 3:18 and we all with open
[9:59] unveiled face I'm reading it in the
[10:02] Amplified but you can read it there
[10:04] continually seeing as in a mirror the
[10:07] glory of the Lord when we're looking in
[10:09] that are progressively being transformed
[10:13] into his image from one degree of Glory
[10:17] even more to even more Glory which comes
[10:21] from the Lord who is the spirit we ought
[10:25] to be able to uh sing take the name of
[10:28] Jesus with you you and shout and say
[10:30] praise the Lord we've heard enough in
[10:32] that scripture that we could look into
[10:34] the very face of the Lord and into his
[10:36] glory but it's not just looking at
[10:38] something we're not changed by as we
[10:40] look into the right thing and we don't
[10:42] have any veil in front of us we are
[10:45] transformed into his image from one
[10:48] degree of Glory to another greater
[10:51] degree degree of
[10:53] Glory praise the Lord so how are we
[10:55] changed by a progression from one one
[10:59] degree of Glory to another how are we
[11:03] changed from one degree of Glory to
[11:07] another I'm so glad that's worded that
[11:09] way because I don't find it in that in
[11:11] that just Bible
[11:13] education right how are we changed by
[11:16] going to
[11:17] Seminary how are we changed by
[11:20] psychology no this is not psychology
[11:24] this is not a mental exercise this is
[11:26] not trying to smear on Jesus in Act like
[11:29] Jesus this is not being educated into
[11:32] something can you say Amen this is the
[11:35] spirit of the Lord having access to you
[11:39] with no veils on your heart no veils on
[11:42] your eyes and that spirit moves you from
[11:46] one glory to another Glory there's no
[11:48] psychology in that there's no mental
[11:50] exercise in that there's not trying to
[11:53] better yourself in that if you're
[11:54] looking at the right thing with no veils
[11:56] on your heart and no veils on your eyes
[11:58] you are change from glory to
[12:01] glory you are advancing to another
[12:04] degree of Glory all the time you just
[12:06] have to watch because sometimes it won't
[12:09] be as visible to you but it's changing
[12:11] you from glory to glory to glory can you
[12:14] sayen and it's more and more Glory all
[12:17] the time it
[12:19] increases it multiplies this is a great
[12:22] multiplying of his glory and it's kind
[12:24] of like compound interest on
[12:27] steroids this is this glory is like
[12:30] compound interest do you know what
[12:32] compound interest is right you should
[12:34] because you're going to be very
[12:35] successful in life if you understand
[12:37] compound interest we have Dave Ramsey
[12:39] things here that we play and whenever we
[12:41] do it you should get in there because
[12:43] you learn the what they call the power
[12:46] of compound interest how many knows it
[12:48] just all right just a few of us
[12:51] hopefully you learned it when you were
[12:52] young and hopefully you applied it the
[12:54] power of compound because that's why
[12:55] they call it a power because it's an
[12:57] amazing multi multiplication or or not
[13:00] just duplication but it's an amazing
[13:03] powerful uh growing of something not not
[13:06] simple interest it's a it's on the other
[13:08] thing of simple interest but this is
[13:10] something bigger it actually is um I
[13:12] looked it up for you and you young
[13:14] people if you caught this when you were
[13:16] young uh this would be a good thing for
[13:18] this life anyway compound interest um in
[13:21] the Dave Ramsey there's some type of an
[13:23] example of a of a young person gave $100
[13:25] a month starting at 21 years old and put
[13:27] it and never touched it by about 50 I
[13:30] think they said they you'd be a
[13:31] millionaire just by the compound
[13:33] interest now how does all that money
[13:35] $100 a month doesn't seem how does it
[13:37] get to a m million because compound
[13:39] interest meaning that the interest you
[13:41] earn each year is added to your
[13:44] principal so it's what you take your
[13:46] principal all the interest added and
[13:48] then that goes again to another year
[13:51] another month however you got it
[13:52] compounding so that the balance doesn't
[13:55] merely grow it grows as an increase at
[13:58] an increase ining rate it's one of the
[14:00] most useful concepts of Finance it is
[14:02] the basis of everything from a personal
[14:04] savings plan to the long-term growth of
[14:07] the stock market if you didn't get to
[14:10] Dave Ramsey I'm giving you a little bit
[14:11] tonight so latch on to it all right this
[14:13] is free this don't cost you
[14:15] anything all of our classes are free
[14:18] compound interest is interest calculated
[14:20] on both the initial principle and all
[14:23] the previously accumulated interest it's
[14:25] all of it and then it keeps accumulating
[14:28] generating interest on interest is known
[14:31] as the power of compound interest and
[14:34] it's nothing compared to the glory that
[14:37] keeps advancing from glory to glory to
[14:40] glory can you say Amen that means god
[14:42] takes the glory you already had within
[14:44] you he doesn't take any of it away he
[14:47] actually takes all of that and he works
[14:49] off of that to give you more
[14:52] Glory Hallelujah don't just subtract
[14:54] from it he actually adds to it and
[14:57] brings more and more and it compounds
[14:59] and so this is not a bettering of
[15:00] yourself this is not just a a better you
[15:04] this is the very glory of God on your
[15:07] life to come into the image of Jesus
[15:10] Christ
[15:12] amen that's not trying to make yourself
[15:15] better this is looking into the word and
[15:17] into his face and you're transformed by
[15:20] I'm so glad it's worded that way it's
[15:22] about his glory it's not about intellect
[15:25] it's not about trying to because most of
[15:27] you can't remember uh some of the
[15:29] scriptures sometimes anyway I'm glad
[15:31] this is not based upon
[15:33] intellect I'm glad this not remember I
[15:36] can't remember all the quotes of the
[15:37] Prophet I'm glad how many is glad it's
[15:40] not based upon how much me is brought
[15:42] you should put it in your memory you
[15:44] should Lodge it in there first the mind
[15:46] is the wound of the soul but it's not
[15:48] dependent his glory is not dependent how
[15:50] much knowledge you have up here it's his
[15:53] glory coming to change you from glory to
[15:56] glory it's it's changing it's doing it
[15:58] can you sayen and I'm so glad this is
[16:00] not based upon what I can remember in my
[16:03] memory because I don't remember a lot of
[16:05] things these days as I've said I'm glad
[16:07] this whole gospel is not based upon good
[16:09] looks because I wouldn't have made it
[16:14] either and you that are laughing
[16:16] probably wouldn't have made it
[16:19] either I'm glad it's not based upon how
[16:21] much money and how much compound
[16:23] interest we make in us it's not make
[16:24] made how much you could be poor and
[16:26] still be wealthy spiritually
[16:29] it's based upon the glory of God coming
[16:31] into your life your very life and to
[16:33] come into his life in the image of Jesus
[16:36] Christ and there's no cost with that
[16:38] there's no intellect with that it is
[16:40] what God is does as we're looking at him
[16:42] so now one thing that's been intriguing
[16:44] me in this subject is to just explore
[16:46] the examples of how his glory can come
[16:50] in unexpected things and I've read a
[16:53] couple quotes to you but how his glory
[16:55] we should never underestimate where his
[16:58] glory can show up we should never
[17:00] underestimate where his glory is
[17:03] beginning to work we should never uh
[17:06] take maybe years of the hardship of our
[17:08] life and think that there's no glory in
[17:11] that God can turn it around and all of a
[17:13] sudden you look at it completely
[17:14] different and His glory was growing and
[17:17] manifesting through those things Isaiah
[17:19] chapter
[17:20] 53 and this is one of the
[17:23] greatest uh places to really show the
[17:27] extreme of God God's glory and the
[17:30] crowning coming from something that is
[17:34] so unlike we would think it would be who
[17:37] hath believed our report and to whom is
[17:40] the arm of the Lord revealed there's
[17:43] that word
[17:45] revelation so here's Isaiah he's a
[17:47] prophet and he's
[17:48] saying who is going to believe what I'm
[17:52] saying because I'm giving the report of
[17:55] the Lord I'm giving the word of the Lord
[17:57] but who's going to believe it I can tell
[17:58] you most people ain't going to believe
[18:00] it so he's asking a question who is it
[18:03] revealed to who is it that's going to be
[18:06] a believe the prophet for their
[18:07] generation very very few who will
[18:12] believe my report as a prophet and who
[18:15] is the armor the Lord revealed because
[18:16] it's not just believe in a prophet it's
[18:18] got to be revealed to you but who is it
[18:20] revealed to it's a question who is this
[18:23] going to be revealed to who believes the
[18:27] prophet's report but then to whom of the
[18:29] armor of Lord is revealed who is the
[18:31] kind of person it's revealed to is the
[18:34] question who is it reveal revealed to so
[18:37] I want to take a look at something
[18:38] that's real hidden and he takes it right
[18:40] into the lamb Christ coming and the way
[18:46] that he come I'm going to read this out
[18:48] of the uh Amplified it's pretty close uh
[18:52] but just I want to read that you guys
[18:53] read along here for he the servant of
[18:55] God grew up before him like a tender
[18:57] Shute plant and like a root out of dry
[19:00] ground he has no stately form or
[19:04] Majestic Splendor it's worded there in
[19:07] your Bible there is no beauty that we
[19:09] should desire him think about it now he
[19:13] was oh no that that we would look at him
[19:16] nor handsome appearance that we would be
[19:18] attracted to him he was despised and
[19:21] rejected by Men A Man of Sorrows and
[19:25] pain and acquainted with grief and like
[19:28] one from from whom men hide their faces
[19:31] he was despised and we did not
[19:34] appreciate his Worth or esteem him why
[19:37] would PE people miss him like that they
[19:38] can't see the glory of God in that they
[19:40] can't see the glory of God they they
[19:43] because they're looking for the wrong
[19:44] thing rejection despise hiding their
[19:48] faces we're ashamed of him and this is
[19:51] the Messiah they were expecting to come
[19:54] he came with no Beauty he came with no
[19:56] Splendor verse four
[19:59] but in fact he was born he has borne our
[20:02] griefs so now you you know watch
[20:04] something switch because we want to
[20:05] preach on this in a
[20:07] minute he he just switches the theme to
[20:11] R in other words he's doing this but
[20:13] he's bearing he's bearing our
[20:17] griefs he's bearing our
[20:20] sins in fact he has borne our griefs and
[20:22] he has carried our sorrows and pains yet
[20:25] we ignorantly assumed that he was
[20:27] stricken struck down by God and degraded
[20:30] and humiliated by him by God but he was
[20:34] wounded for our transgressions he was
[20:37] crushed for our wickedness our sin our
[20:40] Injustice our wrongdoing the punishment
[20:42] required for our well-being fell on him
[20:46] and by his stripes his wounds we are
[20:49] healed all of us like sheep have gone
[20:52] astray we have turned each one to his
[20:54] own way but the Lord has caused the
[20:56] wickedness of us all our sin our
[20:58] Injustice our wrongdoing to fall on him
[21:01] instead of us he was oppressed and he
[21:03] was afflicted yet he did not open his
[21:06] mouth to complain or defend
[21:09] himself like a lamb that is led to the
[21:12] slaughter and like a sheep that is just
[21:14] stop just stop just you've read these
[21:16] scriptures hundreds of times but stop
[21:18] just a minute an unexpected
[21:21] place for God's glory we're saying
[21:24] there's no glory of God in that and yet
[21:27] watch watch God is
[21:29] just at the temple when he's seen all
[21:33] going on there he just breathed in he
[21:35] was so pleased but now we have someone
[21:38] rejected and despised and shame and no
[21:42] Beauty and everybody's rejecting him and
[21:46] God's back
[21:48] saying he's pourn out his
[21:51] soul this is beauty to me
[21:55] Hallelujah see friends listen let's get
[21:57] a lesson here
[21:59] why don't everybody stop looking at the
[22:01] world's qualifications for somebody and
[22:05] what they
[22:06] wear or what they do or their
[22:10] gift because God doesn't look at beauty
[22:13] that way young girls God does not look
[22:16] at Beauty the way the world makes you
[22:18] look at
[22:19] Beauty God is featured in character and
[22:23] not the beauty of this
[22:27] world all all of us like sheep have gone
[22:29] astray we have turned each one to his
[22:31] own way but the Lord has caused the
[22:32] wickedness of us all our sin our
[22:34] Injustice our running to fall on him
[22:36] instead of us he was oppressed he was
[22:38] afflicted yet he did not open his mouth
[22:40] to complain or defend himself like a
[22:42] lamb that is led to the slaughter and
[22:44] like a sheep that is silent before her
[22:46] shears so he did not open his mouth
[22:49] after oppression and judgment he was
[22:52] taken away and as for his generation his
[22:55] contemporaries who among them concerned
[22:58] himself with the fact that he was cut
[23:00] off from the land of the living living
[23:02] by his death for the transgression of my
[23:05] people to whom the stroke of death was
[23:07] due his grave was assigned with the
[23:10] wicked but he was with a rich man in his
[23:13] death uh because he had done no violence
[23:16] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[23:18] the Lord was willing to crush him
[23:21] causing him to suffer and the way that's
[23:24] worded in your in in in the King James I
[23:27] like it better than King James on this
[23:28] one verse 10 it pleased the Lord to
[23:32] bruise him try to figure that out is
[23:35] everybody
[23:38] listening how many y'all still saying
[23:41] well I want to please the Lord in my
[23:43] life he's standing back and watching
[23:46] Calvary and watching all this and
[23:47] watching his life of being despised
[23:49] rejected laughed at and made fun of and
[23:52] you know we just have a little person
[23:54] give us a little look sometimes and we
[23:57] just go crazy a young girl has somebody
[23:59] young guy has somebody you know maybe in
[24:01] the youth group or somebody at work and
[24:03] let me tell you something listen let me
[24:05] just establish this this is not a
[24:07] perfect world people are not going to
[24:09] treat you
[24:10] right and that goes for church sometimes
[24:13] and it goes for Walmart that you're in
[24:14] it goes for Starbucks it goes for your
[24:17] job your parents didn't teach you right
[24:19] this is a world that's going to put you
[24:21] down they're not going to treat you
[24:23] right said well I deserve to be treated
[24:24] right listen grow up grow up it's not
[24:27] going to treat you're right you're going
[24:29] to be laugh make fun of then you start
[24:31] to serve the Lord even within the church
[24:34] sometimes you're going to have people
[24:36] look funny at
[24:40] you and let me just say this if you're
[24:43] not prepared as a Christian to endure
[24:45] rejection and being despised like Jesus
[24:49] was you're not ready yet to be a full
[24:56] Christian what kind of Life are you with
[24:58] wanting when you walk into all kinds of
[25:00] situations and you can't stand being
[25:02] despised or rejection you know there's
[25:05] people that take tests and they have
[25:06] high rejection scores if you take a test
[25:10] um you can see where you score on what's
[25:13] high in your life you have rejection
[25:14] issues you can't handle rejection you
[25:17] know a a single guy that has that it's
[25:19] terrible he'll never get married seems
[25:20] like because every little thing you've
[25:22] used as
[25:23] rejection these are things to overcome
[25:26] as well but if you live a life saying
[25:28] I'm not going to be around anybody I'm
[25:30] not going to do anything I'm because I
[25:32] can't handle rejection you've got to
[25:33] handle rejection and if you're a
[25:35] Christian you better get ready for some
[25:37] rejection you better get ready to be
[25:40] despised I'll just make it personal the
[25:42] Lord spoke to me the other day and a
[25:45] real unique thing took place I told my
[25:48] family about
[25:49] it I was in the truck and just praying
[25:53] and the squirrel comes up looking for
[25:55] food I grab some nuts cuz I had some in
[25:57] the truck I grabbed a couple nuts I
[26:00] looked it up said this is the best food
[26:01] for squirrels right here I threw a
[26:03] couple nuts out he looked for them in
[26:05] the grass he took that nut and looked
[26:07] right up at me and ate a couple bites
[26:10] and threw it down and walked away and
[26:12] refused
[26:15] it now listen friends I don't like to
[26:18] read anything into things but I was
[26:20] really praying about the rejection
[26:23] issues in my
[26:25] life I'm serious
[26:28] so I said buddy I'm feeding you what
[26:32] says is your best food and these are
[26:34] pretty good I spent a lot of money for
[26:36] these I grabbed a handful and I threw
[26:38] them out in the yard they went
[26:40] everywhere he comes back up again he
[26:41] finds one in the grass and he comes
[26:43] right up to my truck and holds it in his
[26:45] hand takes a couple bites like that runs
[26:48] away goes and looks for other
[26:53] food you want me to tell you what the
[26:55] Lord
[26:56] said some of them are leaving you not
[26:59] because of you don't take it personal
[27:02] they don't like the food you're feeding
[27:08] them so if you have a hard time with the
[27:14] rejection you're living in a pretty
[27:16] cruel world but even amongst the church
