[1:07] to save you are mighty to set free
[1:09] father
[1:10] oh god and we just ask that you would
[1:12] bless
[1:13] your word to our hearts this evening
[1:16] father and in the name of jesus i take
[1:18] authority over every hindering spirit
[1:20] every oppressive
[1:22] spirit every spirit of division every
[1:24] spirit of confusion every
[1:26] spirit of pain now bind and cast it down
[1:28] and cast it out in the name of jesus
[1:31] father let your word go forth in power
[1:33] to set captives free today
[1:35] we ask this in the name of jesus and for
[1:38] your glory
[1:39] amen amen you can be seated
[1:44] praise god still getting used to these
[1:46] we don't have lights and
[1:47] um like this at our current church
[1:49] though i think we'll be having
[1:51] having some but it's if you're on stage
[1:55] if it
[1:56] get you get used to like looking looking
[1:58] lower so you can see people
[2:02] all right well praise god so talking
[2:05] about
[2:05] overcoming sin
[2:08] now let's let me read before we get into
[2:12] the
[2:14] the topic let's
[2:18] let's look at first john 5 and 4.
[2:33] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[2:36] the world and this is the victory that
[2:38] overcometh the world
[2:39] even our faith and we learned
[2:43] from this that a big part of overcoming
[2:46] is faith
[2:48] and this is something that i've uh
[2:51] started
[2:52] uh find myself doing more and more when
[2:55] uh we preach at the local church but
[2:58] hebrews 4 tells us
[3:00] that the word preached did not profit
[3:03] certain ones because it was not
[3:05] mixed with faith and you know sometimes
[3:07] we can get in a
[3:08] in a service and we're kind of like well
[3:12] we'll see if that that minister can say
[3:14] anything to me
[3:15] and we'll see if he knows how to reach
[3:17] me and we'll see if he can
[3:18] if he can preach and explain things and
[3:21] we can we can we can look at people
[3:23] and think well they don't know anything
[3:24] about me and
[3:26] how could they say something that would
[3:27] help me but when we come to when we come
[3:29] to service we always need to remind
[3:31] ourselves it doesn't matter
[3:32] who's which man is speaking what matters
[3:35] is the god
[3:36] who has spoken and who is still speaking
[3:39] because it's it's god's word that
[3:42] changes lives
[3:43] right and so um any minister of the
[3:45] gospel
[3:46] his words and himself are going to have
[3:48] no authority but it's it's the word of
[3:50] god
[3:50] that has authority and what we what we
[3:53] know is
[3:54] that we could hear the word of god for
[3:57] two hours we could hear for three hours
[3:58] we could hear it for four hours we could
[4:00] hear it for five hours
[4:01] but if it's not mixed with faith it
[4:03] won't do us any good
[4:05] right it won't it won't profit us and so
[4:07] instead of waiting to the end of the
[4:09] service for our faith to get built up in
[4:10] the minister to
[4:11] to work us up it helps us if we start at
[4:14] the beginning of the service and we
[4:15] decide
[4:16] that what god says i'm going to believe
[4:19] i'm going to believe
[4:20] what god says i'm i'm going to believe
[4:23] because the word when it's mixed with
[4:25] faith
[4:25] changes lives it subdues kingdoms it
[4:28] slays
[4:29] giants it brings the dead back to life
[4:32] it heals the sick
[4:33] the word of god changes things the word
[4:36] of god is is powerful the word of god
[4:38] discerns and one of the things when i
[4:40] was thinking back
[4:41] as a young person i remember
[4:45] coming to church and i remember
[4:48] sometimes
[4:50] sitting there at church thinking oh i
[4:52] hope they don't preach
[4:54] on this and anybody want to know why i
[4:57] was thinking i hope they don't preach on
[4:59] this
[5:00] because this was an area where i wasn't
[5:02] overcoming in
[5:03] in my life and i remember i see brother
[5:07] brother kenny back there but i remember
[5:08] we used to go to retreats
[5:11] and we we were we were at a at a retreat
[5:15] in howell michigan there's a brother it
[5:17] was also something brother paul would
[5:19] would put on and uh most of you know
[5:21] brother berry coffee and he was doing a
[5:23] session with the young man
[5:25] and with the young men and he picked up
[5:27] uh certain issues that are a real
[5:29] struggle for
[5:30] young men and i remember talking to
[5:33] brother kenny afterwards and
[5:35] and when when brother barry started
[5:36] tackling this issue
[5:38] and everybody's kind of sitting there
[5:39] it's like is he going to go there
[5:41] is he going to go there and he and he
[5:43] just he just hit it
[5:44] head on and brother kenny told me later
[5:47] he goes
[5:48] he said it was kind of like when he hit
[5:50] it it was almost like
[5:51] everybody just sighed and just like oh
[5:53] you know you get it get it out in the
[5:55] open
[5:55] and you know that who wants you to be in
[5:58] bondage
[5:59] the devil wants you to be in bondage the
[6:01] devil wants you to be miserable
[6:02] he wants you to be in pain he wants you
[6:05] to suffer
[6:06] day after day after day but jesus wants
[6:09] you to be free
[6:10] and he doesn't want you to be free
[6:12] tomorrow he wants you to be free
[6:13] tonight and it doesn't matter what
[6:16] you're going through it doesn't matter
[6:17] what you're done
[6:18] god wants you to be free tonight and i
[6:20] was i was a young man i still think of
[6:23] myself as a young man
[6:24] and i'll tell you when we talk about the
[6:26] topic of victory over sin
[6:28] the the the bible teaches us in first
[6:30] john that if we say we have no sin
[6:33] that we deceive ourself right we deceive
[6:35] ourselves
[6:36] so there's there's none of us that this
[6:38] this topic of victory over sin is not
[6:40] relevant to
[6:41] and i find i'll study it out and god
[6:43] will gotta give me victory
[6:45] but what happens is you have to renew
[6:47] your mind in the word of god because if
[6:48] you don't renew your mind in the word of
[6:50] god what
[6:51] what hardens your heart the
[6:52] deceitfulness of sin the trickery of
[6:55] of the devil and so by the grace of god
[6:57] uh this evening
[6:58] we would like to renew our minds in the
[7:00] word of god and i want to
[7:02] as we so we're talking we're talking
[7:04] about uh faith a bit before we get into
[7:06] it
[7:06] and when when we when we talk about
[7:09] faith
[7:10] we know the word doesn't profit us if
[7:12] it's not mixed with faith
[7:13] and so um every uh believer
[7:17] should be making a decision you know at
[7:19] the beginning when we read the word when
[7:21] we come into our devotions but
[7:22] especially when we come into
[7:24] a service in the words being preached
[7:25] under the anointing i what god says
[7:28] i will believe and i will i will confess
[7:30] it and i will i will do it and we're
[7:32] we're gonna and and so what does it mean
[7:33] to mix the word with faith we're gonna
[7:35] we're gonna look at that a little bit
[7:37] what faith is and what faith isn't so
[7:39] there's there's
[7:40] uh there's there's lots of scriptures on
[7:43] faith in the bible but there's a few
[7:45] specific ones that define
[7:47] exactly what faith is and i find it
[7:49] helpful to renew my mind continually
[7:51] these scriptures
[7:52] because what the culture tells us faith
[7:54] is is not faith
[7:56] it's not faith at all do you know that
[7:59] the bible teaches you that faith is
[8:00] evidence
[8:01] yes faith is evidence
[8:07] amen so we're going to look at look at a
[8:08] couple of these uh hebrews 11 and 1
[8:11] we'll get into this now faith is the
[8:15] substance of things hoped for
[8:17] the evidence of things not seen in other
[8:19] words how do we receive things from god
[8:21] we receive them by faith you receive
[8:24] them by faith and
[8:24] and so you can receive something from
[8:26] god right now you can receive something
[8:28] from god
[8:29] tonight and somebody might look at you
[8:33] and say you don't have that you're crazy
[8:34] where's the evidence
[8:35] you want to know where the evidence is
[8:37] it's your faith the word of god is the
[8:39] promise
[8:40] you believe it and you confess it and
[8:42] you receive it right there
[8:44] right your faith is the evidence and so
[8:46] it's it's not seen
[8:49] sometimes people pray for healing and
[8:51] they say well i wasn't healed
[8:52] why weren't you healed well i don't feel
[8:54] it i don't see it
[8:56] right but do you do you realize the
[8:57] bible teaches that god's word is settled
[8:59] in heaven first right it's settled in
[9:02] heaven first and then it manifests
[9:04] in in our life so faith is the substance
[9:06] of things hoped for the evidence of
[9:08] things not seen right so in other words
[9:10] if you see it
[9:11] there's no faith involved now think
[9:14] about that for a minute
[9:17] because a lot of times the devil will
[9:19] attack you
[9:20] and it'll be like i don't see that
[9:25] and i'm like that's right where's the
[9:27] proof
[9:29] faith faith is the proof right faith is
[9:32] the proof so
[9:33] that's it um now uh hebrews 11 6 but
[9:36] without faith it
[9:37] is impossible to please him for he that
[9:40] cometh to god must believe that he is
[9:41] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[9:43] diligently seek him
[9:44] what do we learn from this faith is not
[9:46] optional
[9:47] right right how what does the bible say
[9:51] how shall the just live
[9:52] somebody help me out by faith right
[9:55] that's that's how we live that's how we
[9:57] walk
[9:57] so our walk is not in the scene our walk
[10:00] is in the unseen
[10:01] now just take take a minute think of um
[10:04] we don't want to spend a lot of time on
[10:06] it but think think of think of
[10:08] some of the attacks that the devil
[10:09] attacked you last week and maybe today
[10:11] maybe this morning
[10:14] most of the stuff he's tackling you is
[10:16] he's pointing out things that are seen
[10:17] he's like this happened this happened
[10:19] that means this that means this that
[10:21] means this that means this
[10:22] where's he attacking you not in the
[10:24] realm of faith right
[10:25] not in the realm of faith and so if if
[10:28] we want to get out of these attacks we
[10:29] have to learn to live
[10:31] in the realm of faith right and uh
[10:34] romans 10 17 this is the last one uh
[10:37] before we get we get into this um now
[10:39] this this is
[10:40] this is simple stuff
[10:43] even if we're 10 and under we should not
[10:45] be confused by this
[10:47] so if i say my hand is up in the air
[10:50] how much faith do you need to see that
[10:52] my hand is up in the air
[10:54] 10 and under how much
[10:58] none who said none oh
[11:03] right now now if i told you to close
[11:06] your eyes
[11:07] and i said i'm not gonna lie to you
[11:10] i'm putting my hand up in the air okay
[11:14] right now if you trusted me you would
[11:17] know that my hand is up in the air why
[11:19] because i told you that
[11:20] right right so you don't you don't see
[11:22] it but but you see the minute you see
[11:24] something
[11:25] you're no longer operating in faith and
[11:27] so you it but
[11:28] it helps us understand when when we're
[11:30] coming to god a lot of times
[11:32] that the devil's antagonist is you don't
[11:33] see it you don't feel it
[11:35] and so what the the bible teaches us to
[11:38] have victory over
[11:40] um the the victory that overcomes the
[11:42] world is is our faith
[11:44] and so we will find as we as we study
[11:46] the word if we want victory over sin we
[11:48] have to learn to overcome
[11:50] sin with faith romans 10
[11:53] and 17 so this is this is another one
[11:55] that defines how faith
[11:57] operates and this was this was talking
[12:00] about
[12:01] uh salvation and it says so then
[12:04] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[12:07] the word of god
[12:10] amen and so when we when we come
[12:13] when when we come into uh a service and
[12:16] this is any service not just a youth
[12:18] service
[12:19] but we we want to come and we will come
[12:21] and get in an atmosphere of faith
[12:24] because it's in that atmosphere where we
[12:25] will receive from god
[12:27] the things that we receive from god are
[12:29] through faith
[12:30] and it reveals them to us by his spirit
[12:32] in first corinthians two it says now we
[12:34] have not received the spirit of the
[12:35] world but we've received the spirit of
[12:37] god
[12:37] for what reason that we would know the
[12:39] things that are freely given to us
[12:42] of god and so as as we look at these
[12:44] things tonight we're going to see that
[12:46] they're in the realm of faith now i want
[12:48] to i want to look at
[12:49] just a couple more things this is this
[12:52] is in romans
[12:53] 12.
[12:57] when i was a when i was a young person
[13:00] and i'm still a young person but i'll
[13:02] say when i was a younger person
[13:03] and i can't speak to the um to the
[13:07] the the young women on this particular
[13:09] issue
[13:10] but uh for for the for for the for the
[13:13] young men
[13:14] um and i don't have to say too many
[13:17] details but you young men
[13:19] know what i'm talking about whether
[13:20] you're single or whether whether you're
[13:21] married but there's there's a battle
[13:23] in in in the world of of
[13:26] of temptation and it's it's temptation
[13:29] and
[13:30] and lust and and now now i mean it's
[13:33] it attacks women too i'm not gonna not
[13:36] gonna um
[13:37] leave the the women out but the attack
[13:39] in the world is
[13:40] is so intense on the young men young men
[13:44] can often get discouraged saying god why
[13:45] did you
[13:46] put us here why did you why did you why
[13:48] did you make me
[13:50] like this and and they can they can
[13:51] begin to feel that that there's no hope
[13:54] that i'll i'll i'll never overcome and
[13:57] and
[13:57] and uh young men uh sitting there like
[14:00] oh is he gonna go there is he going to
[14:01] is he going to talk about that you know
[14:03] what
[14:06] when when we come to god you got to know
[14:08] that god wants you to be free
[14:10] when we're when we're talking about
[14:11] victory over sin i don't care
[14:13] if you're 99 if you're over a hundred or
[14:15] if if you're five years old just barely
[14:17] enough
[14:18] to hear what i'm saying god wants you to
[14:20] be free and he paid a great
[14:22] price for you to be free and he doesn't
[14:24] want you to go around getting
[14:26] beat up day after day after day he paid
[14:29] the price so you could be free and the
[14:31] bible says
[14:32] whom the son has set free is free indeed
[14:34] in other words it's not a sham
[14:36] when you're bought out of slavery you're
[14:38] set free
[14:39] where you can walk where you can hold
[14:41] your head up high and a lot of times
[14:42] sons of god get so beat down where they
[14:45] where they can't
[14:46] hold their head up because they're
[14:47] saying oh i'm guilty i'm guilty
[14:49] i'm guilty and guess what the devil's
[14:51] standing over the whole time whipping
[14:52] him and says oh yes you are
[14:54] oh yes you are oh yes you are you're so
[14:56] guilty you're so guilty
[14:58] and everybody there if they knew what
[15:00] you were doing they'd kick you out of
[15:01] this church
[15:13] but we serve a god who paid a price for
[15:16] that
[15:16] and i want to i want to um talk to you
[15:19] about that this
[15:19] this this morning or this evening rather
[15:22] but i remember
[15:23] coming to um youth meetings
[15:26] and maybe i can just um
[15:30] speak to the younger ones a little while
[15:36] when i first got saved this was how my
[15:37] my reasoning
[15:39] worked i um i said oh i
[15:43] want to ask jesus in my my heart and the
[15:47] bible when we get saved it doesn't
[15:49] really talk about asking jesus in our
[15:51] heart but
[15:51] sometimes that's all we know so like
[15:53] okay jesus i want you to come in my
[15:55] heart
[15:55] and then and forgive me of my sins and i
[15:58] i had heard preachers preach and i had
[16:00] listened to children's bible hour and i
[16:02] said okay what do i do to get saved i
[16:03] said okay
[16:04] you know you you do this you say i'm
[16:06] sorry for my sins and raise your hand
[16:08] and you come to the altar call
[16:10] and in my mind this is how i thought as
[16:13] a young child said when i got saved
[16:15] jesus forgave every sin that i had done
[16:17] up until
[16:18] that point but then everything after
[16:20] that i had to somehow
[16:21] you know i i was i was had to go go make
[16:23] it right and so
[16:24] i got a little bit older and i would say
[16:26] like oh i i was mean to this person i
[16:28] did this and this and you go you start
[16:30] going
[16:30] apologizing to everybody i'm sorry i did
[16:32] that and what he found is the mountain
[16:34] of sins were stacking up higher
[16:36] then then i could then i could make them
[16:38] right and so i started feeling
[16:40] feeling uh discouraged and then later i
[16:43] i heard
[16:43] i heard teaching on on the holy spirit i
[16:45] said oh that's what i need
[16:47] that's what i need i need the holy
[16:48] spirit and so i was praying
[16:50] and um and and and i sought the lord
[16:52] went went to camp meetings had brothers
[16:54] pray over me and i came to the point
[16:56] where i said i
[16:57] i have the assurance of the holy spirit
[16:59] i have the holy spirit
[17:00] um and we we understand when we when we
[17:03] get the holy spirit
[17:04] now now we have power and we should just
[17:06] want to do right but what i found out
[17:08] was
[17:10] sometimes i'd get tempted to sin and
[17:12] sometimes i would
[17:13] give into that temptation to sin and
[17:14] then i'd wonder did i really
[17:17] have the holy spirit i thought i had the
[17:18] holy spirit and
[17:20] and then i was kind of like you know you
[17:22] ask somebody like what happened oh when
[17:24] you have
[17:24] and some people say oh when you have the
[17:26] holy spirit you know you're you're full
[17:27] of joy
[17:28] and and it was just kind of like life
[17:30] was going to be easy and the holy spirit
[17:31] was going to control you
[17:32] how many knows god doesn't want robots
[17:35] god doesn't want god doesn't want robots
[17:37] but
[17:38] in in my in my um childlike mind it was
[17:41] so
[17:41] frustrating fighting against sin then i
[17:44] thought i'd rather be a robot god god
[17:46] just just control me and i'll do what
[17:48] you say
[17:49] and i mean i wasn't formulating like
[17:51] that i'm looking back and saying that
[17:52] that was what i was kind of thinking
[17:54] and sometimes people are praying you
[17:56] know god i can't do this just
[17:57] just do it for me well you know uh
[18:00] brother branham said uh something
[18:02] uh this this was something that that
[18:04] helped me as as a
[18:07] young man this is from the the marriage
[18:09] of of the lamb but he was talking about
[18:12] overcoming and and we we read in
[18:16] in um you know all through the
[18:18] scriptures about overcoming especially
[18:19] when we get to revelation to the church
[18:21] ages
[18:21] every everyone has to overcome and
[18:23] you're saying well well how
[18:25] how do i overcome you like will you get
[18:26] filled with the spirit you know your
[18:28] heart changes
[18:29] and and if you're predestinating you
[18:30] know that that that seed in you will
[18:32] will overcome and then you're kind of
[18:34] like okay
[18:36] well then what do i do and brother
[18:38] branham actually talks about this
[18:40] in the um in the the marriage of the
[18:43] lamb
[18:44] he says so many says if the lord will
[18:45] take this evil spirit from me
[18:47] from drinking or from gambling or from
[18:49] lying or stealing i'll serve him
[18:51] but that's up to you see you've got to
[18:53] do something too
[18:54] they that overcome shall inherit all
[18:56] things they that overcome
[18:58] you have the power to do it but you must
[18:59] be willing to lay it down
[19:01] see she has made herself ready i like
[19:03] that word now this was the one that
[19:05] really this
[19:05] i've replayed this one over and over in
[19:07] my mind over years listen to this he
[19:09] said
[19:10] he said you see god could not push us
[19:12] through a little pipe and pull us out
[19:14] the other end and say blessed is he that
[19:16] overcome
[19:18] and and and some of us it's like that's
[19:20] what we're praying for we're like god
[19:21] just just push me through the pipe but
[19:22] i'll come out the other end praise in
[19:24] your name
[19:24] and it's like oh you know god let me die
[19:27] in my sleep and wake up in heaven but
[19:29] you know we gotta
[19:30] you know we we there's something if the
[19:32] glory of god
[19:33] and the power of god is manifested it at
[19:35] least ought to be able to undo what the
[19:37] devil did
[19:38] right and that's what it says in first
[19:40] john chapter four
[19:43] it talks about why the son of god was
[19:45] manifested and you you might you might
[19:47] know this
[19:47] well we won't look up all the scriptures
[19:49] because it's gonna take too long so i'll
[19:51] just tell it to you but you can look it
[19:52] up later
[19:52] it's in first john chapter 4 and it says
[19:54] two reasons why the son of god was
[19:56] manifested
[19:57] who's the son of god the son of god of
[19:58] course is jesus
[20:00] and john chapter 1 tells us in the
[20:02] beginning he was the word right
[20:04] right and he was with god and he was god
[20:06] but what did he do
[20:07] the word became flesh so the son of god
[20:10] was manifested as
[20:11] son of man in other words he became one
[20:13] of us now he did this
[20:14] but you say why did he do this why did
[20:17] he do this
[20:18] first john chapter 4 tells us he did
[20:20] this to take away our sin
[20:22] and to destroy the works of the devil
[20:25] and i tell you tonight in the name of
[20:26] the lord
[20:27] jesus was manifested to take away your
[20:29] sins and destroy the works of the devil
[20:32] in other words he wasn't just to forgive
[20:34] you but he was to undo
[20:36] the the full effect of all the damage
[20:38] that the devil did
[20:39] you know he's he said in the old
[20:41] testament that all that the palmer worm
[20:43] had eaten all
[20:44] did the canker the woman he would
[20:45] restore every bit of it and we serve a
[20:48] god
[20:48] that can restore that can undo the power
[20:51] of evil and so it doesn't matter how
[20:53] broken we feel tonight it doesn't mean
[20:55] matter how broken
[20:57] even we we are tonight sometimes we feel
[20:59] broken and the devils just
[21:00] just tricked us sometimes we truly are
[21:02] broken but it doesn't matter
[21:04] whether the devil's trying to deceive
[21:05] you or you're actually in really bad
[21:07] shape god is all-powerful and he did
[21:10] something
[21:10] big to reverse the curse
[21:14] amen and so so we're um
[21:17] and so the um brother branham taught us
[21:20] that when he reversed the curse
[21:21] it wasn't that he was just putting this
[21:23] this um this force in you that you go
[21:25] okay holy spirit okay and and
[21:28] you just do that but sometimes we we
[21:31] think that because we all would be so
[21:32] much easier
[21:33] if god just did it all but he wanted
[21:35] sons he didn't want robots
[21:37] and he didn't want slaves how many knows
[21:40] he wasn't sown a son
[21:42] to bring forth a fruit of servants a son
[21:45] was sown to bring forth a
[21:46] fruit of sons and what do sons do sons
[21:49] know how to make decisions
[21:51] they know how to choose good over evil
[21:53] so when god wants to give you
[21:55] victory over sin i don't care how young
[21:56] you are i don't care how
[21:58] old you are that that those those habits
[22:01] that you're fighting those
[22:02] those spirits that you're fighting god
[22:03] has victory and power
[22:05] over that amen amen and it's it's
[22:09] through his word
[22:11] amen and so so we were looking at at
[22:14] faith a bit and i'd like to um
[22:18] i'm gonna i'm gonna read one one more uh
[22:20] quote here because
[22:21] you know um we talked about what faith
[22:24] is not and i've found it helpful
[22:26] in the christian walk to remind yourself
[22:28] often what
[22:29] faith is not because when you're getting
[22:31] attacked you'll you'll see a lot of
[22:33] times
[22:33] the devil all he's doing is pointing out
[22:36] circumstances
[22:37] he's just pointing at but how how do we
[22:41] overcome we overcome by the word of god
[22:42] and so we have to learn
[22:43] to see what the word of god says to
[22:45] believe what the word of god says over
[22:47] what the circumstance say
[22:48] and brother branham said here this is in
[22:51] faith as a substance
[22:52] this is in 47 he said faith is the only
[22:55] direct positive sense
[22:57] it's the sixth sense it's more than
[22:59] sight it's more than feeling now listen
[23:01] to this you do not feel faith
[23:02] you do not taste faith you don't smell
[23:05] faith you don't see faith
[23:06] faith is the substance of things hoped
[23:08] for the evidence of things not seen
[23:10] so um how many has ever been bothered
[23:12] when you don't feel your faith
[23:14] we all have like i don't feel my faith
[23:17] today you know
[23:17] i get up maybe um no so i'm a preacher i
[23:20] get up i don't feel like preaching today
[23:25] no by the time i get to the pulpit i
[23:27] always feel like preaching
[23:29] but but but sometimes i wake up in the
[23:30] morning i don't feel like preaching
[23:32] you know we got we got uh song leaders
[23:34] we you know
[23:36] every every part of the body is
[23:38] important whether it's whether you're
[23:39] sitting in the pews
[23:40] or or you're up on the platform every
[23:43] part of the body is is
[23:45] is important but sometimes we just don't
[23:47] feel like doing that
[23:49] and do you know what you don't have to
[23:51] worry about that
[23:53] sometimes we get so worried about like
[23:54] oh i don't feel like i'm a christian
[23:56] today
[23:56] well it doesn't matter because you're
[23:59] not a christian by feeling
[24:00] right and if if you if when you learn
[24:03] that simple thing
[24:04] to cast down those feelings because your
[24:07] feelings you know what your feelings go
[24:08] up and down they go side to side they go
[24:10] back and forth
[24:11] and and one day you'll feel saved one
[24:13] day you'll feel forgiven
[24:15] and but what you'll find is is if you go
[24:17] to the word
[24:18] if you stir up that gift of the holy
[24:20] ghost in you you will feel your faith
[24:23] but feelings follow they don't lead and
[24:25] a lot of times we find our the devil can
[24:27] get us so
[24:28] tripped up responding to our feelings
[24:30] and i know as a young
[24:32] person that was that was a big um big
[24:34] hangout for me
[24:35] i'm kind of getting it ahead of myself i
[24:37] want to say a few more things about
[24:38] faith before before we get into it but
[24:41] this this is about
[24:42] how faith operates and let this sink
[24:45] into your spirit romans 12
[24:46] and 1. um the apostle paul says i
[24:51] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[24:52] mercies of god that you
[24:54] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[24:56] holy acceptable unto god
[24:58] which is your reasonable service some
[25:00] translations read
[25:01] a spiritual worship your reasonable
[25:03] service verse 2
[25:05] listen to this and be not conformed to
[25:06] this world but be ye
[25:08] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[25:11] that ye may prove what is that good and
[25:13] acceptable
[25:14] and perfect will of god so let's let's
[25:16] break that down
[25:17] uh what what this what this uh means he
[25:20] says be not conformed to this world you
[25:22] know what conformed means
[25:23] has anyone um do we have any artists
[25:26] here
[25:27] anybody art into art one is that it
[25:30] okay who's who's ever cast a mold before
[25:34] anybody ever cast cast a a mold brother
[25:37] matt's an engineer
[25:38] he can tell you about different molding
[25:40] processes but there's certain molding
[25:42] processes where what they do is is they
[25:44] will actually press on something and
[25:45] form it
[25:47] into into an image and what this is
[25:49] talking about saying this is what
[25:51] happens this is what the world does to
[25:52] you
[25:53] okay so so you're you're walking out in
[25:55] the world and the world is is pushing on
[25:57] you and it's it's like a mole that's
[25:59] saying
[25:59] it would look at brother paul and say
[26:02] you know you're a 55 year old man and
[26:04] you should be like this
[26:05] and he's going to feel about pressure
[26:06] from from from society
[26:08] from people that you meet and it is
[26:09] pressing on you you should be like this
[26:11] and you look at look at brother brandon
[26:13] and say you should be like this and
[26:14] brother bryn
[26:15] you should be like this and it'll look
[26:17] at it you know i don't know
[26:19] you my brother and sister but you know
[26:21] you're young you're a young family and
[26:23] this is what you should be doing and
[26:24] this is how you should be spending your
[26:25] time
[26:26] and it presses on you day after day and
[26:28] what what it's it's like it's like a
[26:30] mold where it's
[26:31] pushing you and you're kind of feeling
[26:32] oh maybe i should be like that maybe i
[26:34] should do this
[26:35] and you're kind of getting all all
[26:37] contorted up but the bible says don't be
[26:39] like that
[26:40] and say okay i'm not supposed to be like
[26:42] that well what do i do it says biggie
[26:44] transform now this this word transform
[26:47] it's used three times
[26:49] in uh in the in the in the bible it's
[26:52] actually actually
[26:53] four but but two of the instances in the
[26:54] gospel refer to the same place
[26:56] but if you can understand what what what
[26:59] what this is it'll really help you
[27:01] in in applying the word to your life now
[27:03] how many um
[27:06] let's see do we got anybody that's
[27:08] taking biology right now
[27:09] life sciences biology life sciences
[27:12] anybody raise it high
[27:14] all right can you tell me all right we
[27:16] got two what's your name sister
[27:18] lydia all right and abigail my niece
[27:20] okay
[27:21] so just uh we'll start with with uh
[27:24] sister lydia
[27:25] do you know what it's called when a
[27:26] caterpillar turns into a butterfly
[27:30] do you remember that okay abigail do you
[27:33] know
[27:35] metamorphosis has anybody ever heard the
[27:36] word metamorphosis
[27:38] okay metamorphosis so how many knows
[27:40] what what uh
[27:41] what a uh caterpillar looks like it
[27:43] looks like a worm right
[27:44] a worm with legs and some people like
[27:46] them and some people don't like them but
[27:48] they
[27:48] they crawl around and then that's that's
[27:49] what they look like now
[27:51] do you when when they turn to a
[27:54] butterfly do they look
[27:55] anything like um like the caterpillar
[27:58] like
[27:59] you like what what's that you know you
[28:01] you you put you put it in a in
[28:02] in a box or whatever you you come back
[28:04] later you're like where's my caterpillar
[28:06] this is butterfly
[28:07] butterfly uh flying around metamorphosis
[28:10] and that comes from a greek
[28:12] root um we're not going to do a greek
[28:14] class even if i could but i'll just tell
[28:16] you
[28:17] what this um metamorphosis it comes from
[28:20] a greek root metamorpho
[28:21] and it means to change from one form
[28:24] into another
[28:25] and this so this is what romans 12 1
[28:27] tells me it says the world
[28:29] is going to push on you and many of us
[28:31] are being pressed you're being
[28:32] you're being pressed by things that are
[28:34] coming from the media you're becoming
[28:36] pressed from things that are coming
[28:37] from your your peers but god doesn't
[28:40] change you by
[28:41] pressing you he changes you
[28:44] by renewing your mind and he'll actually
[28:46] change you
[28:47] from one form and to another and you
[28:49] know how he says he changes us
[28:51] by renewing our mind do you know what
[28:52] that is it's god says something to you
[28:55] in his word
[28:56] and you believe what he said in his word
[28:58] and when you believe it and you confess
[29:00] it you will
[29:01] literally change from one form and to
[29:03] another and it will happen
[29:05] right now in this service why because
[29:07] that's what the power of god does
[29:10] that's what the power of god does and if
[29:12] you recognize that at the beginning of
[29:13] the service
[29:14] as the word is coming forth god's going
[29:16] to speak to your heart he's going to hit
[29:18] your situation
[29:19] he knows right where each of you are i
[29:21] could look at you and guess where you
[29:23] are but god knows where you are
[29:25] and he's going to speak to your heart
[29:26] and he's going to tell you something
[29:29] and what he wants the believer to do is
[29:31] not be pressed by this thing saying this
[29:33] is what you're not
[29:35] you may say god's word says that i can't
[29:37] see how it could be i can't feel how
[29:39] good it be it doesn't matter
[29:40] because that's not where the evidence is
[29:42] the evidence
[29:44] is in faith what does faith do faith
[29:46] comes by hearing
[29:48] and hearing by the word of god and what
[29:50] do we do it says the bible says
[29:52] for with the heart the mouth believeth
[29:54] we didn't continue in romans 10
[29:56] and with the mouth confession is made
[29:58] unto what
[29:59] salvation salvation how shall they
[30:02] believe
[30:04] except they hear how shall they hear
[30:06] except somebody preached the word to
[30:08] them
[30:08] that's what it says in romans 10 we
[30:10] don't have time to to
[30:11] go you know read all through it tonight
[30:13] but you can look it up later
[30:15] that's what the word of god says he says
[30:17] i will send you my word the bible says
[30:18] he sent his word
[30:20] and healed them and so it doesn't matter
[30:22] if you can't figure out how you can make
[30:24] it out of your situation
[30:25] how you can get victory over sin god
[30:27] will give you victory over sin by
[30:29] transforming you
[30:30] by the word of god right and so you want
[30:33] to know where the other two places are
[30:35] that that's used in the bible
[30:37] and there's metamorphosis three times in
[30:39] the whole bible
[30:40] three times so one time he's saying
[30:43] don't get pressed
[30:44] so we all are getting press but he says
[30:46] don't respond to that this is how i want
[30:48] to change you
[30:49] i want to change you by speaking my word
[30:51] over you i want to change you by
[30:53] speaking my word over you you know you
[30:55] say how could it be
[30:56] all right think about this you remember
[30:59] when moses was in the wilderness
[31:01] and and they had sinned what did god
[31:04] tell him to do
[31:05] he said make a brass serpent and put it
[31:07] on a pole now they they weren't just
[31:09] sick um i mean what they had was worse
[31:11] than kovit
[31:12] for covid most people recover this
[31:14] sickness if you got bit you are going to
[31:16] die
[31:17] so there's one thing that you could do
[31:19] you had to go look at a snake on a pole
[31:22] or somebody explain that to me i know
[31:24] you're in bad shape but you just go look
[31:26] at this snake on a pole
[31:27] you'll be fine trust me say what
[31:31] go look at a snake on a pole why could
[31:34] looking at a snake
[31:35] on a pole make you whole because god
[31:37] said it would make you whole and what
[31:39] god says he can do
[31:40] think about this you know how the word
[31:41] of god operates when god says something
[31:43] it happens
[31:44] what do you think happened when god said
[31:46] let there be light
[31:47] you think the sun was like oh let me see
[31:49] if i'll shine oh
[31:51] i don't know if i should shine and
[31:52] there's some people oh you won't shine
[31:53] but god said let there be light
[31:55] boom the sun was shining why it had to
[31:58] shine
[31:59] because he commanded it to shine do you
[32:01] realize that's the same way god speaks
[32:03] over your life
[32:04] he commandeth the word to shine on your
[32:06] heart
[32:07] out of darkness and then you're changed
[32:10] you're changed
[32:10] and this is the other when we're getting
[32:12] right into what the other metamorphosis
[32:13] is
[32:14] second corinthians 3 and he's talking
[32:17] about the word talking about when we
[32:18] when we read the word
[32:19] what happens and it talked about how the
[32:21] people who weren't who weren't changed
[32:23] they read the moses's law with a veil on
[32:26] their heart
[32:27] and picking up at the end we'll pick it
[32:29] at verse 17 it says
[32:30] now the spirit of now the lord is that
[32:32] spirit and where the spirit of the lord
[32:34] is
[32:34] there is liberty let me tell you the
[32:36] spirit of the lord is in this place
[32:38] and it doesn't matter if you don't feel
[32:39] the spirit the lord the spirit of the
[32:40] lord
[32:41] is here and if you'll believe it you
[32:43] will feel it
[32:44] you know what jesus said to martha
[32:45] before he raised lazarus he said didn't
[32:48] i tell you
[32:49] if you would believe you would see the
[32:50] glory of god
[32:52] if you would believe she had to believe
[32:53] first and then she would see it
[32:55] and what's god's what is god trying to
[32:57] get you to do at this part of the
[32:58] service
[32:58] he's trying to get you to make a
[33:00] decision that what he speaks over your
[33:02] life
[33:02] you will believe it and just like when
[33:04] he commanded the sun to shine
[33:06] your situation will change it will come
[33:08] into line with the word of god
[33:10] when when you believe the word of god
[33:11] and when you confess the word of god
[33:13] amen it changes you and so the spirit of
[33:15] the lord is
[33:16] there's liberty but we all with open
[33:18] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[33:20] of the lord
[33:21] how do we behold the glory of the lord
[33:22] we know we we we see him as he's
[33:24] revealed
[33:25] in his word right and and what do we see
[33:28] we see
[33:28] what was he was the firstborn among many
[33:30] brethren in other words he was
[33:32] making us like him but he says when you
[33:35] look at that
[33:36] when you look at him in the word you
[33:37] will be changed from one degree of glory
[33:40] to the other when is that to happen
[33:41] you're not supposed to go home and think
[33:43] about the service so it's good to think
[33:44] about the service but god wants to
[33:46] change you right now
[33:47] he wants to change you right now as he
[33:49] speaks to your situation
[33:51] what does he want you to do he wants to
[33:52] do what mary did it was pretty simple
[33:57] angel comes radical message you know you
[34:00] think so i mean some angels delivered
[34:01] some radical messages
[34:03] it's hard to imagine what could have
[34:04] been going through mary's mind
[34:07] when gabriel shows up and tells her
[34:10] uh you know she's she's gonna
[34:14] bear a son and
[34:18] no they didn't you can tell they i mean
[34:22] we look back and like oh she was she was
[34:23] gonna bear god in the flesh
[34:25] mary didn't really understand that
[34:26] because if she understood that she
[34:28] wouldn't ask him some of the questions
[34:29] that she asked him later on
[34:30] it was it was it was unfolding even the
[34:32] disciples didn't see that otherwise they
[34:34] would have been
[34:35] hanging their head on the road to emmaus
[34:37] and the lord saying
[34:38] you know you fool slow heart not to
[34:41] believe all that the prophets have
[34:42] spoken
[34:43] right but but he but at the same time
[34:46] even if she didn't know that
[34:48] that it was going to be god in the flesh
[34:50] it was still a radical message
[34:52] because the the whole hope of the jewish
[34:55] nation was that one of the women
[34:57] would bear the seed that would crush the
[34:59] head of the serpent
[35:00] one of one of them had had to do it and
[35:02] and the and the the jews learned at some
[35:04] point they said okay it's going to come
[35:06] through abraham then they learned it was
[35:07] going to come through david right they
[35:09] knew it was going to come
[35:10] through david even the scribes knew in
[35:12] herod's time that that he was to be born
[35:14] in bethlehem
[35:15] they they knew a lot about it but when
[35:17] he showed up they missed him by a
[35:18] million miles
[35:20] but but what what what did mary have to
[35:22] do
[35:24] he comes and says this radical message
[35:26] that you're going to conceive
[35:28] a child and she goes how's it going to
[35:30] happen i didn't
[35:32] i didn't have relations with a man he
[35:35] says well the holy spirit's going to
[35:36] overshadow you
[35:38] and she didn't go that didn't make any
[35:39] sense what she said be it unto me
[35:41] according to my word and what happened
[35:44] it began to
[35:45] that she she she was then then the word
[35:48] was was born in her and that's the same
[35:50] thing god wants you to do
[35:51] every one of us has that same
[35:53] responsibility you say how does faith
[35:54] operate it's very simple
[35:56] when you hear the word you believe in
[35:58] your heart and then you say
[35:59] amen to it and sometimes sometimes as
[36:01] young people
[36:03] like i'm too young to say amen you know
[36:05] that's that's that's the
[36:06] that's the the older people's job they
[36:08] got to say amen well guess what
[36:10] the bible says with the heart the mouth
[36:12] the with the heart the man believeth but
[36:13] with the mouth
[36:14] confession is made unto salvation so i
[36:16] don't care how
[36:17] young you are or how old you are when
[36:20] god gives you his word
[36:21] he expects you to believe in your heart
[36:23] and then to say you don't have to
[36:24] jump up like you know uh sometimes i see
[36:27] a brother andrew and he can
[36:28] he can get i remember at retreat there's
[36:30] there's a brother
[36:31] maybe he was named josh or something
[36:33] they would be up at the
[36:34] top and they're just kind of like these
[36:36] little things bobbing up and down
[36:37] they're shouting
[36:38] shout amen helping the you know you
[36:40] don't you don't have to do that
[36:42] that's that's all right everybody's got
[36:43] a way of expressing it but
[36:45] you you actually have to open your mouth
[36:47] and you say that's right
[36:49] that's right god wants you to do that
[36:51] because he says you
[36:52] believe with your heart you know he'll
[36:54] be like oh you know world that's a
[36:55] christianity is a private matter
[36:57] no no it's not if that spirit's in you
[37:01] it will manifest
[37:02] it will manifest but a lot of times
[37:04] people people you know god wants to set
[37:06] you free
[37:08] and when the people were getting free
[37:10] from the snake bites
[37:11] they had to go look at the at the
[37:13] serpent why because that's what god said
[37:16] do you realize that god moves things by
[37:18] his word that's how he does it
[37:20] that's the way god operates that's the
[37:22] way he always operated when he was
[37:24] creating
[37:24] he said let there be boom it was let
[37:26] there be boom it was how did he create
[37:28] sons of god by his word
[37:30] and how does he how does he change them
[37:32] from glory to glory by his word and when
[37:34] you understand that
[37:36] right then then you say so i'm not to be
[37:39] conformed
[37:40] but i'm to be transformed right so it
[37:43] starts by believing the word you have to
[37:44] hear the word first
[37:46] so that's my job i don't know how far
[37:48] how far it will get but we just trust
[37:49] the lord that he'll say what he
[37:51] what he wants i i usually have like this
[37:53] pile of notes that we get on
[37:54] some some some a little bit but if you
[37:57] can understand that as a as
[37:59] as as a young person that's how god
[38:01] wants to change your life
[38:02] he wants to tell you something about you
[38:05] in the word
[38:07] he's going to tell you something about
[38:08] you in the word
[38:10] and you're not going to see it you're
[38:11] going to look like yeah that sounds
[38:13] crazy
[38:14] i don't see how that could be because my
[38:15] problems are too hard i've been
[38:17] i've been going through this for too
[38:18] long i've been hurt you don't know what
[38:20] i did
[38:21] you know all of these things but god's
[38:23] word it transforms
[38:25] he doesn't need to bend you into shape
[38:26] he doesn't need to bandage you up
[38:28] he transforms you by his own creative
[38:30] power do you know when god speaks it
[38:32] it has to happen it has to happen
[38:34] because he has all power
[38:35] so he gets done what he wants but the
[38:37] way he does it in the life of believers
[38:39] is by his word so listen the two so we
[38:42] got two places where
[38:43] where people turn or from caterpillars
[38:46] to butterflies you think about now you
[38:47] can think about when you're coming into
[38:48] service back
[38:49] i want to turn to a butterfly again
[38:50] maybe if you're changed from glory to go
[38:52] i don't know what you turn into after a
[38:53] butterfly
[38:54] but but as as as believers as as
[38:57] as sons and daughters of god we are to
[38:59] be continually transformed
[39:01] so so um yes we should meditate on the
[39:04] word after
[39:05] it's been preached but you can be
[39:06] transformed right now you can be set
[39:08] free
[39:09] right now by the word of god why because
[39:12] he spoke it
[39:14] amen okay so so one was be not conformed
[39:18] to this world but be
[39:18] uh transformed by the renewing of your
[39:20] mind that's that's a transformation you
[39:23] will change from one
[39:24] form to another in other words you won't
[39:26] leave the same way you came you've heard
[39:28] that before right
[39:29] you won't leave the same way you came
[39:30] but did you think about how radical it
[39:32] was
[39:32] that you might walk out and people like
[39:33] whoa what happened to you you're like
[39:35] what god spoke over me and i believed it
[39:37] and it can happen to you too it can
[39:39] happen to you too
[39:40] when you believe in the power of god you
[39:43] realize that everything that god does
[39:45] in the life of a believer is by faith
[39:47] the just shall live how by faith is if
[39:49] you want to please god it's actually
[39:51] impossible to please him without faith
[39:52] faith is not optional it's the way of
[39:55] the believer it's the way that we live
[39:57] right that's the way that we will relate
[39:59] to god
[40:00] is is through faith in his word amen
[40:04] and so so one transformation romans 12
[40:07] another transformation second
[40:09] corinthians three all right are you
[40:10] ready for the third one does anybody
[40:11] know what it is
[40:12] do i know what it is some so some of my
[40:15] home group i'm sure they know what it is
[40:16] we've done this
[40:17] a few times all right jesus is going up
[40:20] to a mountain
[40:21] he takes takes two people with him or
[40:24] three people what
[40:25] is it peter james and john yeah three
[40:27] people with him he takes
[40:28] three people with him he gets up to the
[40:31] mountain
[40:33] and then he changes he's transfigured
[40:36] he changes from one form to another now
[40:39] what happened sometimes
[40:40] we think on the mountain he was like oh
[40:42] maybe a halo came over his head what
[40:43] happened on the mountain was so
[40:45] radical and that you want to know what
[40:49] the disciples said
[40:50] when they got down on the mountain
[40:52] they're like why hasn't elijah showed up
[40:53] yet
[40:54] that's right that's what they said
[40:59] in other words when they saw jesus
[41:01] transformed they go why did why did the
[41:03] scribes say that elias must first come
[41:05] and the what what they when they saw
[41:07] jesus transform
[41:08] shining like that like one minute he was
[41:11] a man
[41:12] and the next minute he's in his
[41:13] glorified body and we hear the voice
[41:15] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[41:16] son and whom i well please
[41:18] he was changed from one form to another
[41:20] that's the three places
[41:21] in the bible that metamorpho is used so
[41:24] you think about you think about what god
[41:26] wants to do over your life
[41:28] right now god wants to change your life
[41:31] amen amen and so
[41:35] it's as simple as hearing the word of
[41:38] god
[41:39] knowing that it applies to yourself your
[41:41] situation
[41:43] and saying yes yes i believe that
[41:46] you say but i don't see how that could
[41:48] be well
[41:49] this is how faith works as we get into
[41:53] this a little bit
[41:54] okay romans 4 talks about how how faith
[41:57] works and i'm going to paraphrase
[41:58] because it's going to it it'll take too
[42:00] long to get through all the scriptures
[42:01] but
[42:02] roman four talks about how abe it's
[42:05] talking about how abraham was justified
[42:07] by faith and it talks about how he
[42:11] got a son everybody remember the story
[42:15] of abraham
[42:16] so god um abraham married a wife
[42:20] and she was a very beautiful woman
[42:23] apparently but she had
[42:25] a one flaw or something
[42:30] does anybody remember what that was she
[42:32] couldn't have kids right
[42:34] she could she couldn't have kids now
[42:36] look at what god does he goes i'm going
[42:37] to raise up
[42:38] a great nation out of these two people
[42:41] that can't have kids
[42:43] do you realize what god does and how is
[42:45] he going to do it by his word
[42:48] that's how he's going to do it by his
[42:49] word do
[42:51] and and so so what did abraham have to
[42:53] do so this this is what this is what um
[42:55] romans 4 teaches us it said
[42:59] he was strong in faith giving glory to
[43:01] god okay so
[43:03] um maybe we'll go there we'll we'll
[43:05] we'll read it i take it back
[43:06] sorry romans 4.
[43:13] again i love this portion i got a song
[43:15] about that one too
[43:16] but we'll do that another time
[43:24] okay
[43:31] let's just read romans 4 16 that it is a
[43:33] faith that it might be grace to the end
[43:35] that the promise might be sure to all
[43:37] the seed
[43:38] not to that only which is of the law but
[43:40] to that also which is of the faith of
[43:42] abraham who is the father of us
[43:43] all so it it's it's showing abraham he
[43:46] was he was a father of the jewish nation
[43:48] but he's also a father of us
[43:49] in faith and it was it was he's showing
[43:52] us that
[43:52] the way he operated when we think about
[43:55] faith this is the way
[43:56] the way we're we're to operate now now
[43:59] you're gonna
[44:00] in in both of these situations there's
[44:02] there's a promised child that comes
[44:03] and sometimes god will do it like like
[44:05] like with mary where she just says yes
[44:07] and boom it's happening right then
[44:09] but sometimes god is speaking some
[44:11] things and they don't happen
[44:13] right away and you know what that's
[44:15] called it's called the
[44:16] trial of your faith right your faith is
[44:19] tested
[44:20] right and so if um has has anybody ever
[44:24] um you know prayed for something
[44:28] and you don't see it and you're like
[44:29] well that must not have worked
[44:32] you know what that's called that's
[44:33] called the prayer of unbelief
[44:35] right because when we when we pray and
[44:38] we believe
[44:39] what god said then we don't need to see
[44:42] it
[44:42] he wants us to keep believing and so
[44:44] this is what happened to abraham god
[44:45] says
[44:46] abraham come out of your nation and i'm
[44:48] going um
[44:49] and and follow me and i'm gonna make a
[44:51] mighty nation of you
[44:53] like okay god and he and he leaves and
[44:55] you know he's he's going around and god
[44:57] promises him
[44:58] he's gonna have a son you know he sees
[45:00] these these visions and
[45:01] look at the stars that's how your how
[45:03] many kids are gonna have look at the can
[45:05] you number the
[45:06] the sand and the seashore that's how
[45:07] many kids you're gonna have and he's
[45:08] like all right
[45:10] and um you know with um
[45:13] the he was husband and wife and they
[45:15] they were
[45:17] they were doing what they they needed to
[45:19] do
[45:21] to um produce children but
[45:24] wasn't any children coming and they're
[45:26] like
[45:29] maybe god meant another way
[45:35] now he didn't disbelieve god but he
[45:38] limited god and the bible actually tells
[45:41] us
[45:42] that god does exceeding abundantly above
[45:45] all that we ask or think
[45:46] so when you hear that voice when god
[45:48] tells you something in his word
[45:50] and you hear that voice that says well
[45:51] maybe god meant this and it is some like
[45:53] weaker sorrier version of that
[45:56] believe me that's not what god meant
[45:57] because god does he always does better
[46:00] than what we think he does exceeding
[46:02] abundantly
[46:03] above what we ask your thinking it was
[46:05] the same with abraham but
[46:06] it got you know they they they had us a
[46:09] son through through hagar and god says
[46:11] no that's not what i meant
[46:13] and so um so he's like okay i'll keep
[46:16] believing
[46:18] and now abraham's old he's too old
[46:21] to conceive a child that sarah's too old
[46:24] to conceive a child
[46:25] and if there's any wonders like well
[46:26] maybe they weren't old enough the
[46:27] scripture leaves no doubt it says
[46:29] it was ceased to be with sarah after the
[46:31] matter of manner of women
[46:33] in other words it was physically
[46:34] impossible for her to bear a child
[46:36] and god says all right now
[46:39] it's time to see my power you know what
[46:42] he said
[46:42] when he showed up at the tent sarah
[46:45] laughs is anything too hard for the lord
[46:47] and that's what that's what you have to
[46:49] ask yourself because we're in situations
[46:51] that are hard for us
[46:53] but there's nothing too hard for the
[46:55] lord and what did abraham have to do
[46:56] this is this is what it this is what it
[46:58] says
[46:58] that it does it says who against who
[47:01] against hope um
[47:02] let's see before god whom he believed
[47:04] who quickeneth the dead means he makes
[47:05] the dead alive and calleth those things
[47:07] which be not as though they were who
[47:09] against hope believed in hope that he
[47:11] might become the father of many nations
[47:14] according to that which was spoken so
[47:16] shall thy seed be so look
[47:18] god said something to him he believes it
[47:20] right and now this is what he did
[47:22] it says and not being weak in faith he
[47:24] considered not his own body now dead
[47:26] when he was about a hundred years old
[47:28] neither yet the deadness of sarah's room
[47:30] he staggered not at the promise of god
[47:32] through unbelief
[47:33] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[47:35] god being fully persuaded that what he
[47:37] had promised he was also
[47:38] able to perform therefore it was imputed
[47:40] to him for righteousness
[47:42] now there's a lot there but let's just
[47:44] break it down what it is
[47:45] abra is saying every day abraham had to
[47:48] make a decision he got up
[47:49] and he said my body body's too old to
[47:51] have a son doesn't matter
[47:53] he looks at sarah sarah sarah um can't
[47:56] have children it's physically impossible
[47:58] it said he considered them not
[47:59] and so in other words when god tells you
[48:01] something there will be things staring
[48:03] you in your face
[48:04] when you get up when you turn this way
[48:06] when you turn that way
[48:07] that will say the opposite of what god
[48:09] told you and what does he say this is
[48:10] what abraham did he said
[48:11] nope why because there's a greater
[48:14] reality those are what are called
[48:16] facts but god's word is truth and truth
[48:18] is higher than facts
[48:20] truth will always overpower facts he is
[48:23] the way he is the truth he is the life
[48:25] and what he says
[48:26] comes to pass because he's able to do
[48:28] what he said that's what he told sarah
[48:30] sarah laughs
[48:31] she says it's impossible he says is
[48:32] anything too hard for god
[48:34] and god can set you free tonight from
[48:36] and i thought we were going to talk
[48:38] mainly about victory over sin i trust
[48:39] we'll get to it a little bit but it
[48:41] looks like most of the sermons on faith
[48:42] that's okay god because we gotta if we
[48:45] if we believe
[48:45] god will find our lives transformed
[48:49] we'll have we'll find our lives
[48:50] transformed but you have to recognize
[48:51] this is what you have to do
[48:53] if you want to have faith you have to
[48:55] learn to recognize that the thing you
[48:57] see has
[48:58] nothing to do with faith and so it's
[49:00] going to come to you the devil's going
[49:01] to bring it
[49:02] and do when you realize it has nothing
[49:04] to do with faith you'll find
[49:05] as as you walk in faith it actually gets
[49:07] easier to say that doesn't matter
[49:10] because he's attacking you in the area
[49:12] of sight
[49:14] right he's attacking you in the area of
[49:16] sight but there's a truth that's higher
[49:18] than that right and so abraham
[49:19] it was said he was strong in faith
[49:21] giving glory to god do you know what
[49:22] that means he was strong in faith giving
[49:23] glory to god it means he was confessing
[49:25] the word
[49:26] over him glory is associated with the
[49:28] tongue
[49:29] and and it means he was strong in faith
[49:31] giving glory to god he said god promised
[49:33] me a son
[49:34] god will give me a son and it will come
[49:36] through sarah and so what god says
[49:38] he's able to do amen
[49:44] amen so we're thinking about this as as
[49:47] we
[49:48] um we're just going to have a little bit
[49:50] of time uh to
[49:51] to get on this but so think you think
[49:53] you know we're thinking about
[49:55] faith and the bible teaches us that the
[49:57] word of god when he speaks it it changes
[49:59] things
[50:00] but it won't change things if it's not i
[50:02] mean
[50:03] it it won't change things in your life
[50:05] if it's not mixed with faith
[50:07] won't change it for the better i'll say
[50:09] that you know if god
[50:10] um but if you want to receive the
[50:13] promises of god
[50:14] we receive them through faith right and
[50:17] faith
[50:18] faith is the evidence in other words the
[50:20] proof that you have that god will do
[50:23] what he said is your faith so a lot of
[50:26] people say well that didn't happen
[50:28] if you believed god for it if you
[50:29] confessed it it's as good as if you have
[50:32] it
[50:32] and your faith is the proof your faith
[50:34] is the proof now think about this
[50:36] romans 6 this is what the word says
[50:39] about us
[50:40] and and this this is where i struggled a
[50:42] lot as a young person
[50:45] and so what would happen to me as as a
[50:48] young person i i
[50:49] i believe i was in in um
[50:53] in high school when the when the lord
[50:55] really started dealing with my life and
[50:57] i believe i was i was filled with the
[50:59] the holy spirit but i went off to
[51:02] to college and and facing a lot of the
[51:05] temptations
[51:06] um of of the world i had some some
[51:09] stumbles
[51:12] and here's how the devil will attack you
[51:14] when you stumble
[51:15] and i'm talking about born again people
[51:17] we'll we'll talk about unsaved people
[51:19] in in a minute but born again people
[51:21] what he will say to you is this
[51:22] if you had the holy ghost you would not
[51:25] have done
[51:26] that and he'll start
[51:29] he'll start bringing um
[51:32] bringing scripture to you and you
[51:36] and and he'll say he that is born of god
[51:40] cannot sin
[51:42] right you sinned he'll never quote to
[51:45] you the whole passage
[51:47] but he'll he'll um he'll come and and
[51:50] quote uh
[51:50] to you and
[51:55] and i'm like it would be one thing if
[51:57] somebody tricked you into doing that
[52:00] but you actually liked that you enjoyed
[52:02] it and you you you enjoy the sin and
[52:05] he's just starting to attack you and and
[52:08] condemn you and
[52:09] you're kind of like did i enjoy it i i i
[52:12] didn't want to do it but
[52:13] but i did it and i tried to confess and
[52:16] i try to repent maybe i don't have the
[52:17] holy ghost
[52:18] oh maybe i'll just better go back into
[52:20] sin and you go into this this cycle
[52:22] of of condemnation and repeating the bad
[52:25] habits the devil tells you
[52:26] you know why even try and then then one
[52:28] day one it's like one day maybe you'll
[52:30] come to a service
[52:32] and the holy spirit will move so
[52:34] powerfully that you won't even want to
[52:35] do that bad
[52:36] thing again
[52:39] sometimes that happens but actually the
[52:42] bible teaches us an overcoming sin that
[52:44] is
[52:44] actually the exception then than the
[52:47] rule even what brother branham was
[52:48] saying he said he said
[52:50] you say to god if you take this away
[52:52] from me if you take this away from me if
[52:53] you take this away from me i'll serve
[52:55] you
[52:55] he said you have to be willing to give
[52:57] it up so how does that work
[52:59] well let me say it this way
[53:04] i don't know the specific sin that you
[53:06] have that you struggle in your life some
[53:07] of them
[53:08] uh maybe different different sins that
[53:10] you struggle with
[53:12] but the only sins that you can overcome
[53:14] in your life
[53:16] are forgiven sins
[53:19] the only sins that you can overcome in
[53:21] your life are forgiven sin
[53:23] you know what do you mean by that well
[53:25] you have to understand what god does
[53:27] when he saves you
[53:29] what does god do when he saves you has
[53:31] anybody heard that word justification
[53:35] justification justification
[53:39] comes from the word just and what it
[53:42] means to be is it means to be lined up
[53:44] with something has anybody ever used a
[53:45] word processor using like microsoft word
[53:49] anybody ever use that or google docs or
[53:50] whatever anybody use that raise your
[53:52] hand if you use that
[53:53] okay there's these little um there's
[53:55] these little things
[53:56] on the word processors you can click it
[53:58] and it will line up
[53:59] everything to the right of your page or
[54:01] you can click the other one it'll line
[54:03] everything up to the left of that you
[54:04] know what that's called
[54:05] it's called left justified and right
[54:08] justified it means you're
[54:09] lined up with a standard okay
[54:12] now god does something when he saves you
[54:16] and it's called justification and so
[54:19] if justification means lined up what
[54:21] would it mean
[54:22] if god says you're justified well it
[54:24] means not that you're lined up with the
[54:26] right side of the page it means that
[54:27] you're lined up with his standard
[54:30] what's his standard it's his law right
[54:33] it's it's
[54:34] it's his law now what the bible teaches
[54:37] us that nobody could be
[54:39] justified by the deeds of the law right
[54:41] so ev
[54:42] the law was given to us and we're trying
[54:44] to do it we're trying to do it we're
[54:46] trying to fall
[54:46] and we keep falling short okay
[54:49] this um i've heard it said
[54:53] and there's a kind of strange way of
[54:54] saying it but if you think about it
[54:56] you can understand what how it works
[54:59] that um
[55:00] i think this is in scotland in the old
[55:02] days when people had done a terrible
[55:04] crime okay
[55:06] they did a terrible crime and the
[55:08] punishment of the crime what's her name
[55:10] on the end
[55:12] ethan all right say ethan killed
[55:16] somebody
[55:17] all right how old are you 17.
[55:20] so ethan he's a young 17 year old he's
[55:24] got all this wild 70 year old energy
[55:26] and he does something and then he gets
[55:28] in a rage and he kills somebody
[55:29] all right stand up ethan
[55:33] you want to be an example tonight can
[55:34] you help me out no all right
[55:36] somebody else help me out no what about
[55:39] you
[55:40] no all right you help me out
[55:43] all right jayden
[55:46] okay all right so uh so jaden
[55:50] um jaden went in a fit of rage and he
[55:53] killed somebody
[55:54] right what's what's the penalty for for
[55:56] uh for for
[55:57] killing somebody just broadly speaking
[56:00] death right
[56:01] penalty is death okay so jayden comes
[56:04] here
[56:05] okay and uh you know jaden
[56:08] jaden comes and then they say um you
[56:11] know
[56:12] do you have you have anything to to to
[56:14] say before the sentence is
[56:16] executed on you
[56:19] all right so if if if he was a little
[56:22] remorseful you go i just want to say i'm
[56:23] sorry to the family and everybody i
[56:25] heard and you say
[56:26] he was saying he's so sorry and they're
[56:27] like that's nice but
[56:29] the law has a requirement okay and so we
[56:32] would we would string him up this would
[56:33] be in scotland
[56:34] and then then he'd be hung and then he'd
[56:36] be dead and then he would put him down
[56:38] right and then now now um jaden is dead
[56:41] and now there will be a proclamation and
[56:43] so today is is may 16th
[56:45] and it would say on may 16th jayden was
[56:49] justified
[56:50] okay you can sit down right he's
[56:51] justified now
[56:54] okay now now you're now you're saying
[56:56] what in the world are you talking
[56:58] about he he um he
[57:01] killed somebody and he died and he was
[57:03] justified
[57:04] well what does it mean justified means
[57:06] you're lined up with the law
[57:07] okay so the the penalty
[57:10] for killing somebody was that he had to
[57:12] give his life
[57:14] so now he's at odds with the law but
[57:16] when he pays with his life
[57:18] now he's lined up with the law the law
[57:20] has no more
[57:21] requirements on him he is justified so
[57:24] if by some means he could come back to
[57:26] life
[57:27] guess what he'd be free to go because he
[57:29] already paid
[57:30] the penalty that's what justified means
[57:33] it means that there's
[57:34] no more requirements that the law has
[57:37] on you now what does the bible say in
[57:40] isaiah 54
[57:42] we sing the song no weapon formed
[57:44] against me shall prosper
[57:46] and every tongue that rises against
[57:49] me in judgment i will condemn this is
[57:51] the heritage of the servants of the lord
[57:53] why he tells you the secret their
[57:56] righteousness is of me
[57:58] saith the lord in other words they are
[58:00] justified
[58:02] every requirement that the law has
[58:04] against them
[58:05] has been met okay in other words
[58:08] they are forgiven okay do you realize
[58:13] that when god wants you to overcome sin
[58:17] he does something for you first he
[58:22] justifies you
[58:24] he justifies you okay let's look at
[58:27] romans
[58:28] eight and and one and this this was the
[58:31] thing that i struggled with
[58:32] as a young person romans 8 1 says there
[58:37] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[58:39] who are in christ jesus who walk
[58:41] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[58:44] and we we could we could read more
[58:45] but this this is what it says how many
[58:48] has ever felt condemned
[58:50] all right we've got lots of christians
[58:51] raising our hands here you've felt
[58:53] condemned
[58:53] and then you go to romans eight god
[58:56] there's no condemnation why do i feel
[58:58] condemned
[58:58] well sometimes from the context you can
[59:01] understand exactly what it's saying
[59:03] this one sometimes it's helpful if you
[59:06] um
[59:06] you can get online they have little
[59:10] greek dictionaries and they'll tell you
[59:12] the meaning behind this word but this
[59:14] this word condemnation
[59:15] the greek word we're not going to do a
[59:17] greek lesson but i'll just tell you this
[59:19] it's kataka and you know what it means
[59:21] it means damn to hell
[59:23] it means judgment is passed on you and
[59:25] so now what what is this saying this
[59:26] doesn't say you will never feel guilty
[59:28] it says once you are in christ jesus
[59:31] you will never ever ever ever ever ever
[59:34] ever be
[59:35] damned to hell in other words because
[59:38] sometimes you've heard it said what what
[59:39] what would you do in your life if you
[59:41] knew you couldn't fail
[59:43] and people talk about that for starting
[59:45] businesses do you realize that that's
[59:47] what god does with his children
[59:48] he starts out and he says he says when i
[59:51] save you
[59:51] this is what i'm going to do for you you
[59:53] don't have to worry you will never
[59:55] ever ever ever ever be damned to hell so
[59:58] what he does
[59:59] when we're justified when we when we put
[1:00:00] our faith in christ
[1:00:03] he says you're lined up with the law you
[1:00:05] know how can i be lined up with the law
[1:00:06] by just believing him well it's because
[1:00:10] he paid the debt
[1:00:12] he paid the debt
[1:00:15] how could he pay the debt you say how
[1:00:17] could jesus pay the debt
[1:00:20] the old testament law was an eye for an
[1:00:22] eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a
[1:00:24] life
[1:00:24] you know they talked about a kinsmen
[1:00:26] redeemer if somebody killed one your
[1:00:27] family
[1:00:28] the goal he could go after and kill the
[1:00:31] person who killed them and that was so
[1:00:33] that justice
[1:00:34] would happen in the land wouldn't be
[1:00:35] polluted for blood god always wanted to
[1:00:37] execute justice
[1:00:38] he'd say well it was just one person
[1:00:41] that died
[1:00:42] so he should have been at best able to
[1:00:44] redeem one person so who got redeemed
[1:00:46] was it the thief at the cross
[1:00:48] it's like well how could he redeem
[1:00:51] everyone
[1:00:52] well the reason he could redeem everyone
[1:00:54] if if somebody could redeem everyone
[1:00:56] the worth of his life would have to be
[1:00:57] worth more than all of the lives put
[1:00:59] together
[1:01:00] right worth more than all of the lives
[1:01:03] put together
[1:01:03] and when jesus died his life was worth
[1:01:06] more
[1:01:07] than every life that was ever created
[1:01:08] every life that will be created
[1:01:10] why because the bible tells us that the
[1:01:12] builder has more honor than the building
[1:01:15] right my kids they make they make little
[1:01:17] um castles in the backyard
[1:01:19] i can kick it down but they can build
[1:01:21] another you can kick it down they can
[1:01:22] build another but if you killed them no
[1:01:25] more would be built
[1:01:26] what are we we are his workmanship what
[1:01:29] does it say john chapter 1 says there
[1:01:30] wasn't a single thing made
[1:01:32] that he didn't make every single one of
[1:01:35] you were made by jesus
[1:01:37] and so if if he died
[1:01:40] he paid the price for everything that he
[1:01:43] ever created it was paid in full
[1:01:46] and he says how does it get paid in full
[1:01:48] by you believing that it gets paid in
[1:01:50] full
[1:01:50] you believing and confessing it and so
[1:01:53] when we struggle with guilt when we say
[1:01:55] i'm not going to make it to heaven
[1:01:57] the bible tells us if you're justified
[1:02:00] filled with his spirit yes you will make
[1:02:03] it to heaven you will never
[1:02:04] be damned to hell why because god said
[1:02:06] so he said he wouldn't damn you to hell
[1:02:09] later in romans 8 it says who is it that
[1:02:11] condemns it's god that justifieth
[1:02:14] how's it going to be when you get up to
[1:02:15] the judge and he's the judge
[1:02:17] and he says i paid the debt well guess
[1:02:20] what
[1:02:20] you're going to go free right because he
[1:02:23] said you were going to go free
[1:02:24] he said you're going to go free so let's
[1:02:26] just look at a couple more things i know
[1:02:28] it's
[1:02:28] i know it's going a bit long but if you
[1:02:29] can understand what the word of god says
[1:02:32] about you
[1:02:32] it will set you free from that guilt of
[1:02:35] sin it will set you
[1:02:37] free from the power of sin so romans
[1:02:39] romans
[1:02:40] 6 6 says this
[1:02:43] knowing this that our old man is
[1:02:45] crucified with him
[1:02:49] has anybody ever tried to crucify your
[1:02:51] old man
[1:02:53] sometimes we do but what does the
[1:02:55] scripture say
[1:02:57] the scripture says this time about
[1:02:59] people are born again says your old man
[1:03:00] is crucified with him so do you think
[1:03:02] your old man is crucial do you think you
[1:03:04] should crucify your old man
[1:03:05] or you think your old man is already
[1:03:06] crucified
[1:03:09] well i think i would believe what the
[1:03:12] word of god says
[1:03:13] it says knowing this now what does he
[1:03:15] say
[1:03:16] he says that the body of sin might
[1:03:17] destroy be destroyed that henceforth
[1:03:19] we should not serve sin for he that is
[1:03:22] dead
[1:03:23] is freed from sin now if we be dead with
[1:03:27] christ we believe that we shall also
[1:03:29] live with him knowing that christ being
[1:03:32] raised from the dead dieth no more
[1:03:34] death hath no more dominion with him for
[1:03:36] in that he died he died unto sin once
[1:03:37] but in that they liveth he liveth unto
[1:03:39] god
[1:03:39] now verse 11 is what we want to get to
[1:03:41] likewise reckon
[1:03:43] ye also yourself to be dead unto sin but
[1:03:46] alive
[1:03:46] unto god through jesus christ our lord
[1:03:49] do we get any accountants in the
[1:03:51] building i know there's at least one
[1:03:52] is is there our accountant in here where
[1:03:55] is she
[1:03:57] we got another accountant another
[1:03:59] accountant okay
[1:04:01] reckon reckon in the king james
[1:04:04] it was the the king james english they
[1:04:07] weren't from the southern
[1:04:08] um southern us they didn't say well now
[1:04:11] you reckon god will do that
[1:04:13] you reckon uh that's that's not what
[1:04:15] reckon means in the king james sometimes
[1:04:17] you can use
[1:04:17] a different translation but it's
[1:04:18] actually an accounting term and it's an
[1:04:21] exacting term
[1:04:22] so your account your accountant brother
[1:04:24] boaz so what what do they call it
[1:04:27] when when when somebody's you know
[1:04:29] trying to trying to go through the
[1:04:30] numbers and there's some missing and
[1:04:32] they just
[1:04:33] they just kind of make it up and fill it
[1:04:34] in
[1:04:37] what's that they call it reconciliation
[1:04:41] but when they make it up they would call
[1:04:43] it fraud right
[1:04:44] or cooking the books right so what you
[1:04:46] have to recognize
[1:04:48] when when you when you uh when you
[1:04:50] balance your checkbook
[1:04:51] when you when you do accounting you you
[1:04:54] can only mark it
[1:04:55] off if it is exactly there you can't say
[1:04:58] well i hope we'll get funds here
[1:05:00] so let me count these so this is what
[1:05:03] god through the holy spirit is telling
[1:05:05] the believer to do he's saying wrecking
[1:05:08] yourself dead to sin he's
[1:05:09] he's not saying act like you're dead to
[1:05:11] sin and pretend that you're dead to sin
[1:05:13] and dream up that you're dead to sin
[1:05:15] he's saying god
[1:05:17] already did this when you were born
[1:05:18] again you are dead to sin
[1:05:20] now believe that it's done in other
[1:05:22] words the funds have been paid
[1:05:23] and you are dead to sin and he says that
[1:05:25] has consequences
[1:05:27] when you're dead to sin now think about
[1:05:29] it you've got a slave
[1:05:30] let's go back to the slave days brother
[1:05:32] brandon don't help me out come on
[1:05:36] we're we're we're winding down but you
[1:05:38] recognize this
[1:05:40] okay brother brother you you'll be the
[1:05:43] slave for this
[1:05:46] this one because otherwise we won't be
[1:05:47] able to leave the script sit down
[1:05:52] get up go give me a clean axe
[1:05:58] right he's a slave he's got to do what
[1:05:59] he says now what if i get him
[1:06:01] get angry at him and um and he said he's
[1:06:04] not bringing it
[1:06:05] fast enough and so i started beating him
[1:06:08] right and um and i beat him until he's
[1:06:10] dead and pretend you're dead
[1:06:12] all right now if i was his master
[1:06:16] guess what i'm not as master anymore
[1:06:19] there's nothing i can do to order him
[1:06:21] around because he's dead okay thank you
[1:06:24] all right so so that that that
[1:06:26] relationship is over
[1:06:27] now this is what the bible is saying
[1:06:29] he's saying there was a relationship
[1:06:30] that you were in you had a master and
[1:06:33] his name was the devil you had a master
[1:06:35] his name was sin but when you were born
[1:06:38] again
[1:06:38] you were justified and you were dead and
[1:06:41] that old master has no more
[1:06:43] rights over you and now you've got to
[1:06:44] make a decision you got to make a
[1:06:47] decision what you're going to believe
[1:06:48] and what you're going to confess now
[1:06:50] imagine let's flip the situation
[1:06:52] let's let's say that um by some way
[1:06:56] right it was just uh has anyone ever had
[1:06:58] a bad
[1:06:59] a bad boss anybody had a job where they
[1:07:01] had a really bad monkey they didn't
[1:07:02] ran in again okay so you had a bad boss
[1:07:05] and and pretend
[1:07:06] i'm the bad boss right and
[1:07:10] if you can understand because what god
[1:07:12] says in his word is exactly what he
[1:07:13] means
[1:07:14] he doesn't mean maybe he doesn't mean
[1:07:16] something sideways he doesn't mean for
[1:07:17] you to work it up
[1:07:18] what he says he does when he said let
[1:07:20] there be light he caused the light to
[1:07:21] shine when he said there would be sons
[1:07:23] of god
[1:07:24] he was the one who brought forth the
[1:07:25] light of the sons of god by speaking his
[1:07:27] word over them what was their part right
[1:07:28] their part was
[1:07:29] to respond to the word of god just like
[1:07:30] mary did you say amen to the word of god
[1:07:33] and so god is
[1:07:34] telling something to justified people
[1:07:36] today he's telling you something
[1:07:38] about your christian life about how you
[1:07:41] can overcome sin because you have
[1:07:42] somebody who's been trying to boss you
[1:07:44] around
[1:07:44] and when brother brandon had that bad
[1:07:46] boss he didn't like him but when the bad
[1:07:47] boss said do this he was like okay
[1:07:49] and he would do it and he but imagine
[1:07:52] now brother brandon gets
[1:07:54] a new job now he's got a new job
[1:07:57] and this isn't quite as extreme because
[1:07:59] the bible actually says
[1:08:00] you know you were dead that relationship
[1:08:02] is severed forever
[1:08:04] okay but now he's got it he's got a new
[1:08:06] job and brother paul's his boss he's a
[1:08:08] much better boss and brother paul's for
[1:08:10] the policy you know just treating him
[1:08:11] great
[1:08:11] but then the old boss comes hey brandon
[1:08:14] he's like
[1:08:16] yeah i need you to do something for me
[1:08:19] and he's kind of thinking he's saying it
[1:08:21] really mean
[1:08:23] what does he need to say you're not the
[1:08:24] boss of me
[1:08:26] do you realize that that's what god is
[1:08:28] telling you to do listen to this
[1:08:30] okay you understand the example he says
[1:08:32] likewise
[1:08:33] reckon yourselves dead indeed unto sin
[1:08:35] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[1:08:37] he's saying something happened
[1:08:38] when you were born again now you notice
[1:08:40] what the devil is the bible tells us
[1:08:41] that the devil was a liar he was a cheat
[1:08:44] he was a thief from the beginning in
[1:08:45] other words when he comes to you he
[1:08:46] doesn't need to use logic
[1:08:48] he doesn't play fair he'll just say
[1:08:50] stuff and see if it works
[1:08:51] right so he'll say you're not a son of
[1:08:53] god and you respond to that maybe i'm
[1:08:54] not a son of a guy he's like oh that's
[1:08:55] working he'll keep working that
[1:08:57] but if if he if he um if that's not
[1:08:59] working about well you are a son of god
[1:09:01] but if you're a son of god you should do
[1:09:02] this and he'll start trying to build up
[1:09:04] build up your pride
[1:09:05] because he doesn't care he's just
[1:09:06] throwing lies at you
[1:09:08] to see what works but what god does in
[1:09:10] his in his word
[1:09:12] is he tells us the truth and the truth
[1:09:14] sets us free
[1:09:15] and the truth concerning those who are
[1:09:16] born again
[1:09:18] is that he's not your master anymore and
[1:09:20] he says reckon yourself
[1:09:22] dead to sin and so what what it's saying
[1:09:24] is you will still be attacked
[1:09:27] you will still be attacked but now you
[1:09:29] have a choice to make he said let not
[1:09:31] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[1:09:33] in other words sin wants to rule over
[1:09:34] you but you don't belong to sin anymore
[1:09:36] your heart's been changed and so he'll
[1:09:38] intimidate you but in first timothy it
[1:09:41] says god has not given us a spirit of
[1:09:43] fear
[1:09:44] but a spirit of power and love and a
[1:09:45] sound mind if you look up that spirit of
[1:09:47] fear you know what it is it's
[1:09:48] intimidation
[1:09:49] cowardice and do you realize a lot of
[1:09:51] times when the devil attacks you
[1:09:52] he's trying to intimidate you he's
[1:09:54] trying to back you into a corner you're
[1:09:55] like oh maybe i don't know this maybe i
[1:09:57] don't know this that's why you've got to
[1:09:58] renew your mind in the word of god
[1:10:00] because it tells you the truth about
[1:10:01] yourself
[1:10:02] it says that relationship is severed
[1:10:04] he's not the boss of you anymore you say
[1:10:06] i am dead to sin why
[1:10:07] because i put my trust in christ he died
[1:10:10] for me
[1:10:11] and he rose for me and so i every
[1:10:13] requirement that the law has of me has
[1:10:16] been
[1:10:16] met in other words there's not a single
[1:10:18] accusation
[1:10:19] that's going to come up against me that
[1:10:21] i'm not going to condemn he said you
[1:10:23] will condemn it
[1:10:24] why because your righteousness is the
[1:10:25] righteousness of god
[1:10:27] so in other words he's going to point us
[1:10:29] us and jesus is going to say his
[1:10:31] righteousness is my righteousness
[1:10:32] do you know one of the names of gods is
[1:10:35] the lord our righteousness jehovah sit
[1:10:37] canoe
[1:10:38] the lord our righteousness he would give
[1:10:40] that as one of his names
[1:10:41] do you realize in proverbs it says that
[1:10:43] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[1:10:45] the righteous run into it
[1:10:46] and are safe you can run into the lord
[1:10:48] your righteousness
[1:10:49] and be safe from the attacks of the
[1:10:52] enemy and so what one of the ways i
[1:10:54] realized as a young person
[1:10:55] the devil was beating me up and down
[1:10:57] tricking me that i was wasn't born again
[1:10:59] that he was still my master and you know
[1:11:02] what
[1:11:03] a lot of times i believed it because i
[1:11:06] was going by feeling
[1:11:08] i felt guilty you know what psalm 32
[1:11:11] says
[1:11:12] blessed is he blessed is the man to whom
[1:11:15] the lord does not impute sin
[1:11:21] the lord you're like how could the lord
[1:11:22] not impute sin
[1:11:26] the way the lord doesn't impute sin is
[1:11:28] that he paid for our sins
[1:11:30] he paid for our sins what is the penalty
[1:11:32] for sin
[1:11:34] it's our life it's our life right the
[1:11:36] wages of sin is death that's what
[1:11:38] that's what the bible says if you know
[1:11:40] that your
[1:11:41] sins have been paid for right the bible
[1:11:44] tells us that you are right with god
[1:11:46] and so romans 8 1 says you don't have to
[1:11:49] worry about being damned to hell
[1:11:52] so now he says you have a choice to make
[1:11:54] neither yield you your members
[1:11:56] as instruments of unrighteousness but
[1:11:57] yield your selves unto god as those that
[1:12:00] are alive from the dead and your members
[1:12:02] as instruments as righteousness
[1:12:03] unto god for sin shall not have dominion
[1:12:06] under you in other words the power
[1:12:08] of sin has been broken you guys sing the
[1:12:09] song the anthem here the power of sin is
[1:12:11] broken
[1:12:12] jesus overcame it all you guys ever sing
[1:12:14] that that song you know that song
[1:12:15] the power of sin is broken do you know
[1:12:17] how jesus broke the power of sin
[1:12:19] well there's there's uh the first thing
[1:12:21] that he did was he justified you
[1:12:23] the second thing that he did was he gave
[1:12:25] you new life
[1:12:26] and he changes your heart and so that
[1:12:28] when when you're born again
[1:12:30] that there's a there's a change that
[1:12:31] will happen you will you the
[1:12:33] in your inner man you would desire to do
[1:12:36] the will of god but your three parts
[1:12:38] spirit soul and body
[1:12:41] the devil won't be able to make your
[1:12:43] spirit desire the things of the world
[1:12:45] but he can attack you
[1:12:47] in your soul in your flesh and a lot of
[1:12:49] times we get confused
[1:12:50] because he's he's attacking us on our
[1:12:52] flesh and we're like oh i still
[1:12:53] i still feel these things maybe i don't
[1:12:55] have the holy spirit no i do have the
[1:12:56] holy spirit but i have to walk out
[1:12:59] right the thing that god already did
[1:13:01] that's why it would tell you he's saying
[1:13:02] go balance your checkbook see what god
[1:13:05] did for you
[1:13:07] what did he do for you he saved you you
[1:13:09] passed
[1:13:10] from death into life and so when when
[1:13:12] when you're attacked
[1:13:14] by the enemy what's the answer
[1:13:18] well it's simple you're not the boss of
[1:13:20] me
[1:13:21] jesus is is the boss of me and you say
[1:13:24] well that's that sounds too easy
[1:13:26] well the the gospel is simple but but
[1:13:28] it's it's not it's not easy
[1:13:30] there's there's there's a battle right
[1:13:32] there there's there's a battle
[1:13:33] there's there's a battle that we go
[1:13:35] through but
[1:13:38] it's a choice that we make it's a choice
[1:13:40] that we make as believers
[1:13:42] just one more as as we as we close
[1:13:46] i want to cover one in in first john
[1:13:49] chapter 5.
[1:13:58] i want to talk a little bit about
[1:14:00] condemnation so we we talked about
[1:14:02] um the condom romans 8 1 is talking
[1:14:06] about
[1:14:07] being damned to hell and it says once
[1:14:09] you're in christ jesus you will never be
[1:14:11] damned to hell
[1:14:11] in other words your sins have been
[1:14:13] forgiven you're like what does that mean
[1:14:14] i don't have to confess anymore
[1:14:16] no you do you do have to confess but it
[1:14:18] means when when you've passed from death
[1:14:20] into life
[1:14:22] hebrews 10 14 says by one offering he's
[1:14:24] perfected forever
[1:14:25] them that are sanctified
[1:14:28] well how many times do you think you'd
[1:14:30] have to perfect somebody forever
[1:14:33] how many once right if they're perfected
[1:14:35] forever it's done
[1:14:37] do you know how many times you get
[1:14:38] justified one time
[1:14:41] right one time you get because the blood
[1:14:43] of christ is enough
[1:14:44] to pay for every sin that you ever did
[1:14:46] and every sin that you ever will do
[1:14:48] what you have to do is you have to
[1:14:49] believe it you have to believe it you
[1:14:52] believe it in your heart
[1:14:53] and you confess it and the bible says
[1:14:54] that's how we're justified
[1:14:56] when we believe it and so what what
[1:14:58] we're trying to do a lot of times is
[1:14:59] we're trying to feel it
[1:15:01] we're trying to feel it do you realize
[1:15:04] you don't have to feel forgiven to be
[1:15:05] forgiving
[1:15:07] this this is something i struggled with
[1:15:09] a lot as a because you feel
[1:15:10] so guilty for your sin you're like
[1:15:14] i don't feel forgiven that was so bad
[1:15:16] what does the word say it says if we
[1:15:18] confess our sin
[1:15:19] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[1:15:20] our sins and cleanse us from all
[1:15:22] unrighteousness
[1:15:23] and and primarily to somebody who's born
[1:15:25] again that's about fellowship
[1:15:27] that's that's that's about fellowship
[1:15:28] with god it's about it's about
[1:15:30] it's about relationship now there are
[1:15:32] people who think they're born again
[1:15:33] if you never have the fruits of
[1:15:34] righteousness then the you know
[1:15:36] we start with a little fruit but if if
[1:15:39] if your desires haven't changed
[1:15:40] and you you just you're just coming to
[1:15:42] church you know you haven't been born
[1:15:43] again
[1:15:44] you need to be born again and god god
[1:15:46] will we'll we'll save you but we serve a
[1:15:48] living god
[1:15:49] and what i just wanted to share with you
[1:15:52] tonight is that the the secret to
[1:15:55] overcoming sin
[1:15:57] number one you have to be born again
[1:16:00] if you're not born again you will not
[1:16:01] overcome sin it doesn't matter how much
[1:16:03] you try
[1:16:04] but the way god causes believers to
[1:16:06] overcome sin
[1:16:08] is he forgives them first in other words
[1:16:11] he removes that penalty of hell
[1:16:13] first first john 4 says hearing is our
[1:16:16] love made perfect that we may have
[1:16:17] boldness in the day of judgment you know
[1:16:20] boldness in the day of judgment is
[1:16:21] it means when you're coming to the
[1:16:23] judgment seat you're not wondering what
[1:16:25] the verdict will be
[1:16:26] has anyone ever wondered when i get to
[1:16:28] the judgment seat
[1:16:30] is god going to say guilty
[1:16:34] or justified that's not boldness
[1:16:38] but he said he said hearing is our love
[1:16:40] made perfect then it might have boldness
[1:16:42] in the way of judgment
[1:16:43] in other words the way that god brings
[1:16:45] you to maturity
[1:16:46] is he first takes away the fear of
[1:16:49] condemnation in other words
[1:16:51] he's saying you will not be judged
[1:16:53] because your righteousness is of me
[1:16:56] right and and the devil the whole time
[1:16:58] is telling you you're not worthy and you
[1:17:00] say
[1:17:01] that's right i'm not worthy that's why
[1:17:02] it's called grace
[1:17:05] right because he is worthy what he did
[1:17:08] is more than enough and if you can
[1:17:09] believe that then you receive it
[1:17:11] by faith right and then you're righteous
[1:17:14] with god not because you feel righteous
[1:17:16] but because he made you righteous and if
[1:17:18] you confess that if you believe it
[1:17:20] you'll notice that your feelings will
[1:17:21] change that what god wants you to do is
[1:17:24] believe
[1:17:24] exactly what he says in the word about
[1:17:26] you so if it says christ
[1:17:28] paid the penalty for your sin it means
[1:17:30] that he paid the penalty for your sin
[1:17:32] and i don't care how
[1:17:33] young you are or how old you are we have
[1:17:35] to renew our mind in that
[1:17:37] right that that i'm right with god that
[1:17:39] he's paid the penalty for my sin
[1:17:41] and these attacks that are coming with
[1:17:42] me they're not the boss of me
[1:17:45] god is the boss of me i'm i'm risen with
[1:17:47] christ why because i put my faith in
[1:17:49] christ
[1:17:50] amen and you'll notice so herein
[1:17:54] is our love made perfect that we may
[1:17:56] have boldness
[1:17:57] in the day of judgment because as he is
[1:17:59] so are we in the world how is he in the
[1:18:01] world
[1:18:02] he said be of good cheer i have overcome
[1:18:04] the world that's that's how
[1:18:05] that's how he is in the world it goes on
[1:18:08] there is no fear in love
[1:18:09] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:18:12] because fear hath torment
[1:18:13] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[1:18:15] love now a lot of times we think of this
[1:18:17] verse
[1:18:18] and we think of oh if i'm afraid then
[1:18:21] then i just got to think about love and
[1:18:22] i won't be afraid and
[1:18:24] it is true that the love of god will
[1:18:26] deal with these these fears but
[1:18:27] he's talking about that that he's
[1:18:30] actually removed
[1:18:32] the fear of being judged
[1:18:35] so he because he says here in his love
[1:18:37] made perfect that you may have
[1:18:39] boldness in the day of judgment in other
[1:18:41] words when god saves you
[1:18:43] he doesn't want you to say i think he
[1:18:46] saves gideon and he doesn't want gideon
[1:18:49] wondering is he going to make it to
[1:18:52] heaven today
[1:18:53] but tomorrow he's not going to make it
[1:18:54] because he had a bad day
[1:18:56] maybe he he struggled with some things
[1:18:58] now he's not going to make it no he said
[1:19:00] gideon
[1:19:01] i saved you and i want you to know that
[1:19:03] i saved you and be bold about it
[1:19:05] in other words what's boldness in the
[1:19:06] day of judgment can you imagine walking
[1:19:08] up to the judgment seat
[1:19:11] he's like righteous that's what that's
[1:19:13] what he's saying
[1:19:14] about you why because your righteousness
[1:19:16] is of him
[1:19:18] right and he said he says so perfect
[1:19:20] love casts without all
[1:19:21] fear when you walk in his perfect love
[1:19:23] the perfect love is the love that
[1:19:25] god had for you when he saved you and he
[1:19:27] goes that's
[1:19:29] it's from that place that you overcome
[1:19:31] sin knowing not that you're trying to
[1:19:32] earn
[1:19:33] his salvation but that he's already
[1:19:35] given it to you and he's
[1:19:37] so when he says reckon when when you're
[1:19:40] struggling with sin
[1:19:41] as a young person you have to recognize
[1:19:44] that you will not
[1:19:45] earn god's favor the galatians tells us
[1:19:47] if we actually try to earn god's favor
[1:19:50] we will actually undo what what god
[1:19:53] will that that the that
[1:19:56] that our faith will be in in vain you
[1:19:59] have to put your trust in christ
[1:20:01] and him alone you know what our
[1:20:03] righteousness is
[1:20:04] filthy rags god gives us a beautiful
[1:20:06] white robe
[1:20:07] you got this dirty rag
[1:20:11] the word used in isaiah is actually a
[1:20:12] pretty uh
[1:20:14] crude when it talks about filthy rags
[1:20:17] this is the word
[1:20:17] it's used in the scripture but it says
[1:20:18] menstrual cloth i mean that's that's
[1:20:21] that's what your righteousness is now
[1:20:22] can you imagine god giving you a white
[1:20:24] robe you know like i just got to put
[1:20:26] this on here it'll look real nice
[1:20:28] that's what our righteousness is to god
[1:20:31] you can't earn
[1:20:32] it you have to recognize that he already
[1:20:35] did it for you and why did he how did he
[1:20:37] do it
[1:20:38] it wasn't cheap
[1:20:41] god himself shed his own blood for you
[1:20:44] the one who's worth more than
[1:20:46] all of creation combined he did that it
[1:20:49] came
[1:20:50] at great cost why did he do it he did it
[1:20:52] for his love
[1:20:53] to you amen let's have the musicians
[1:20:55] come
[1:20:59] he did it because of his love for
[1:21:02] us amen and he wants us
[1:21:06] to overcome sin from that place of
[1:21:09] already being made righteous
[1:21:11] and if that was i don't know how many
[1:21:14] years it took me to understand that and
[1:21:16] i
[1:21:16] i i trust that god is speaking to some
[1:21:19] of your spirits
[1:21:20] and i trust that he's speaking to
[1:21:22] everybody but remember what we
[1:21:24] remember what we we talked about earlier
[1:21:27] in the service
[1:21:28] we talked about faith and faith
[1:21:32] is what god says about you you say so be
[1:21:35] it
[1:21:36] in other words i receive it now if god
[1:21:40] if you've put your faith in christ if
[1:21:42] you haven't put your faith in christ you
[1:21:44] can put your faith in christ tonight
[1:21:47] you can put your faith in christ tonight
[1:21:51] but if you have put your faith in christ
[1:21:57] if you've trusted him what does it mean
[1:21:59] to trust him
[1:22:00] the bible says that the devils believe
[1:22:03] and tremble
[1:22:03] believing in christ doesn't mean
[1:22:06] believing a bunch of facts about him
[1:22:08] it means staking your whole life on him
[1:22:11] the the what's the the
[1:22:14] closer word in in in what we use in
[1:22:17] modern english should be closer to trust
[1:22:19] when when you trust somebody you do
[1:22:21] something about it
[1:22:22] and you can't say you believe in christ
[1:22:24] unless your actions
[1:22:26] change because if you actually believe
[1:22:28] in what he's done for you
[1:22:29] then you'll do something about it you
[1:22:31] know what he said he that believeth on
[1:22:32] me
[1:22:33] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:22:35] right when we when we believe in god
[1:22:37] changes happen in our life
[1:22:42] amen keep playing we've been made more
[1:22:46] than conquerors
[1:22:55] the devil doesn't doesn't fight
[1:22:58] fair
[1:23:03] and uh for a lot of
[1:23:08] people he'll attack us and he'll just be
[1:23:12] making you feel guilty all the time so
[1:23:13] you can never do anything for god
[1:23:17] but you know what how god is glorified
[1:23:19] he's glorified in you
[1:23:20] bringing forth fruit and do you know
[1:23:22] what he says bringing forth fruit is
[1:23:25] he says if you abide in me and my words
[1:23:27] abide in you you'll bring forth much
[1:23:29] fruit
[1:23:30] in other words the things that he spoken
[1:23:32] concerning the sons of god
[1:23:34] especially as we would come into the
[1:23:36] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:23:37] god wants you healing and raising the
[1:23:39] dead who's ever sung i've got a river of
[1:23:41] life flowing out
[1:23:41] of me you know what that song says it
[1:23:43] says make the lame to walk
[1:23:45] and the blind to see but you don't feel
[1:23:48] like you could raise the dead you don't
[1:23:50] feel like you can make
[1:23:51] the blind see but god said
[1:23:55] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:23:57] shall do shall he do also
[1:23:59] he didn't say the apostles that believe
[1:24:01] on me the works that i do shall he do
[1:24:03] also
[1:24:04] he said he they believe upon me the
[1:24:07] littlest
[1:24:07] lowliest child that believes on him to
[1:24:10] save works
[1:24:11] you'll do why because when god says
[1:24:13] something
[1:24:14] in the in the heart of the believer when
[1:24:16] you confess it
[1:24:17] the transformation happens you might
[1:24:20] have come into this place
[1:24:21] a caterpillar today god wants you to
[1:24:23] leave a butterfly
[1:24:25] different than when you came he's
[1:24:27] speaking over your life
[1:24:28] you know the devil would like to make
[1:24:30] you feel guilty and
[1:24:31] confusing about what god did but when he
[1:24:34] paid the debt he paid it in full he
[1:24:35] didn't leave part of it
[1:24:37] for us to pay he delivered us from fear
[1:24:40] so you don't have to walk in fear you
[1:24:42] don't have to wonder if you can
[1:24:44] fail that's what predestination is about
[1:24:46] he said he said i've chosen you
[1:24:49] from the foundation of the world he that
[1:24:50] began a good work in you will perform it
[1:24:52] how
[1:24:53] until the day of jesus christ
[1:24:57] psalm 37 says the steps of a good man
[1:25:00] are ordered by the lord
[1:25:02] not if he fall though he fall he will
[1:25:05] not be cast down why
[1:25:06] because underneath him the lord's hands
[1:25:09] are holding him up
[1:25:11] that's what god does when you're born
[1:25:14] again
[1:25:14] yes we fall but he says you won't be
[1:25:17] condemned
[1:25:18] because your righteousness is of me and
[1:25:20] he wants you to get that in your spirit
[1:25:22] balance some checkbooks balancing the
[1:25:24] checkbook is marking the line of what
[1:25:27] jesus did for you
[1:25:29] i was buried him with him in his death
[1:25:32] and i'm risen with him
[1:25:34] colossians chapter three and verse one
[1:25:36] if you then be risen with christ
[1:25:38] it's not saying if you feel you're risen
[1:25:40] with christ but if you're risen
[1:25:42] with christ seek those things that are
[1:25:44] above you have decisions to make
[1:25:45] i thought i couldn't make those
[1:25:47] decisions because i was pressed
[1:25:50] i was pressed by the temptations i was
[1:25:53] pressed by the things people were doing
[1:25:55] around me
[1:25:57] but he said you don't have to be pressed
[1:26:00] you can be
[1:26:00] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:26:02] you can believe
[1:26:04] that you're already righteous because i
[1:26:06] made you righteous
[1:26:08] and if you haven't been made righteous
[1:26:09] yet if you're still trying
[1:26:11] it's simple you want to know how you get
[1:26:14] saved
[1:26:15] two things repent and trust
[1:26:20] two things acts 2 38
[1:26:23] how do you repent also two things you
[1:26:27] acknowledge and turn it's not enough to
[1:26:29] just
[1:26:29] acknowledge i know there's some of you
[1:26:31] who probably aren't saved here tonight
[1:26:33] and i don't want you to leave this place
[1:26:34] god wants people to be free
[1:26:36] not tomorrow he wants you to be free
[1:26:38] tonight
[1:26:39] and sometimes you know we've walked for
[1:26:41] a long time but the devil's still been
[1:26:42] beating us up with things
[1:26:44] but he said whom the son shall set free
[1:26:46] it's free indeed
[1:26:47] in other words you're not a slave any
[1:26:49] longer they'll become a tax
[1:26:51] after you they're saying do this do that
[1:26:53] you say oh no you don't
[1:26:55] i'm not a slave any longer because jesus
[1:26:58] set me free
[1:27:00] and if you're under condemnation jesus
[1:27:02] wants to set you free
[1:27:03] tonight what does it mean to repent
[1:27:06] acknowledge
[1:27:07] acknowledge that what you've done is
[1:27:10] against god
[1:27:11] you have to turn from your way and turn
[1:27:14] to something
[1:27:15] it's not repentance unless you turn the
[1:27:18] root of the word repentance means to
[1:27:19] turn in other words you're going one way
[1:27:21] but you say god god speak in his hearts
[1:27:24] tonight
[1:27:26] and some of you have not yet turned god
[1:27:28] wants you to turn
[1:27:29] tonight acknowledge i'm going the wrong
[1:27:32] way
[1:27:33] after a turn but when i turn i have to
[1:27:36] turn to
[1:27:37] something what do you turn the cross
[1:27:41] the cross was made a tree of life to us
[1:27:43] when his blood was shed
[1:27:48] his body was made a tree of life to us
[1:27:50] what do you trust in
[1:27:51] you trust jesus what did jesus do he
[1:27:54] paid the debt he was whipped so you
[1:27:56] don't have to be whipped
[1:27:58] some of us we let the devil whip us
[1:27:59] because we feel like we deserve to be
[1:28:01] whipped
[1:28:02] how many of you are going to go in a
[1:28:03] store and you
[1:28:05] paid for all your goods and you get to
[1:28:08] the thing
[1:28:09] and they say no why don't you leave them
[1:28:12] here
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:16] i don't know what young people like
[1:28:18] these days
[1:28:19] maybe gadgets whatever the newest phone
[1:28:22] is
[1:28:24] what's the newest phone
[1:28:27] iphone 11 all right
[1:28:31] 12. oh man bust
[1:28:35] all right iphone 12. joshua saves up his
[1:28:39] money
[1:28:40] he likes apple stuff gets an iphone 12
[1:28:44] he goes in the store
[1:28:46] he paid for it he gets to the gate
[1:28:50] security stops him says let me have your
[1:28:54] phone no you don't
[1:28:56] i paid for it
[1:29:00] prove it got a receipt
[1:29:03] now it could be a mean security guard i
[1:29:05] mean brother paul is pretty intimidating
[1:29:06] if he put a mean face
[1:29:08] and you know you you might you might
[1:29:10] second guess given your phone
[1:29:12] but why are you gonna take it out of the
[1:29:14] store because it's paid for
[1:29:16] do you know why jesus paid for your sins
[1:29:19] do you want to know why he paid for your
[1:29:21] healing
[1:29:21] do you know why he bore your burdens he
[1:29:23] bore him so you wouldn't have to
[1:29:25] so you don't have to leave without the
[1:29:29] things that he paid for
[1:29:30] so you don't have to wait till tomorrow
[1:29:33] do you know that in the old testament
[1:29:34] law
[1:29:35] there was a law that if somebody worked
[1:29:37] for you
[1:29:38] you could not turn them away that night
[1:29:40] without paying them if you had the money
[1:29:43] how could god put that in his own law
[1:29:46] and when he paid for your healing say oh
[1:29:48] we'll better wait till tomorrow
[1:29:49] if it's paid for now do you know in
[1:29:51] isaiah 53 it says
[1:29:53] by his stripes we are healed but in
[1:29:55] first peter 2 24 do you know what it
[1:29:56] says
[1:29:57] by his stripes we were healed in other
[1:29:59] words it's paid for
[1:30:01] we expect things that were paid for and
[1:30:03] so when we get to the gate and somebody
[1:30:05] says
[1:30:06] you ain't taking that phone out of here
[1:30:07] you say oh yes i am
[1:30:09] because it's paid for that's what faith
[1:30:11] is about
[1:30:12] it's recognizing what he has done jesus
[1:30:15] paid a great price
[1:30:16] and if you haven't trusted god tonight
[1:30:18] you can trust him
[1:30:20] trust him that he paid for your sins
[1:30:24] and he paid for you to go free and when
[1:30:27] we sing this song we've been made more
[1:30:28] than conquerors that comes
[1:30:30] from the end of romans chapter eight and
[1:30:32] romans chapter 8
[1:30:34] talks about obstacles the end of it
[1:30:37] the beginning we read he says you're not
[1:30:39] damned to hell
[1:30:40] but he keeps going he says if the
[1:30:44] spirit is in you
[1:30:47] it'll quicken your mortal body
[1:30:51] there's so many promises in romans 8 we
[1:30:53] go through things
[1:30:55] and he says all the things that you go
[1:30:57] through god's going to work them out
[1:30:59] for good but what's the good it says his
[1:31:02] purpose that he'd actually bring you as
[1:31:04] a manifested son to glory
[1:31:05] because it said he was the firstborn
[1:31:07] among many brethren
[1:31:08] that's what god's destiny is for you
[1:31:10] tonight i don't care what you think
[1:31:12] about yourself
[1:31:13] in the in the healing revivals uh what's
[1:31:16] called the latter rain
[1:31:17] movement the the be before the time
[1:31:21] brother branham came on the scene
[1:31:22] there were there were a few pioneers
[1:31:24] before him john alexander dowie
[1:31:26] smith wigglesworth um john g lake but in
[1:31:30] um in the in the early part of the 1900s
[1:31:34] during the revivals under smith
[1:31:36] wigglesworth he was a he was called the
[1:31:37] apostle of faith
[1:31:38] in britain and i read a story as a
[1:31:41] four-year-old girl
[1:31:43] during this revival man had cancer
[1:31:46] guess who prayed for the man with cancer
[1:31:49] the four-year-old girl
[1:31:51] she laid her hands on him and he was
[1:31:53] healed
[1:31:54] god honors the faith of children god
[1:31:57] wants
[1:31:58] you to be free because he paid for it
[1:32:00] you think
[1:32:01] can you imagine how angry i would be
[1:32:05] i don't know what the fanciest
[1:32:06] restaurant in this area is but in
[1:32:09] is that area restaurant in sylvania trio
[1:32:12] is that still there
[1:32:13] there's a restaurant called trio that
[1:32:15] was the fanciest one i saw
[1:32:16] in sylvania but you can imagine if they
[1:32:19] were still open and we're wrapping up
[1:32:20] the meeting
[1:32:24] and i said you know what we're all gonna
[1:32:25] go to trio we're gonna we're gonna do it
[1:32:27] up tonight
[1:32:28] and i paid for every last person in here
[1:32:30] so you could eat a trio
[1:32:33] and you know how if i came to trio
[1:32:36] later and i didn't see
[1:32:40] any food out i didn't see anybody there
[1:32:44] and i asked the maitre d at the front
[1:32:46] and say what happened they say oh yeah
[1:32:47] everybody came here
[1:32:49] i told them told them to go away
[1:32:52] you know what i'd be mad you want to
[1:32:55] know why i'd be mad
[1:32:57] why do you think you pay for somebody to
[1:32:59] have something because you want them to
[1:33:01] have it
[1:33:01] do you think god doesn't want you to
[1:33:03] have deliverance god wants you to have
[1:33:05] deliverance
[1:33:06] it's a thief that doesn't want you to
[1:33:07] have deliverance it's a thief that
[1:33:09] doesn't want you to have healing
[1:33:10] it's a thief that wants you to have
[1:33:11] condemnation but god wants you to be
[1:33:13] free
[1:33:14] tonight he wants you to be free if
[1:33:16] you've been battling with things
[1:33:18] sometimes we've been christians for a
[1:33:20] long time
[1:33:25] but even though we've been christians
[1:33:26] for a long time we've still been facing
[1:33:28] some battles sometimes
[1:33:30] it's the spirits of condemnation spirits
[1:33:32] of fear spirits and uneasiness
[1:33:34] and what some of these things are called
[1:33:36] that we face a long time they're called
[1:33:37] strongholds
[1:33:39] but the bible says the weapons of our
[1:33:40] warfare they're not
[1:33:42] carnal but they're mighty to god to the
[1:33:44] pulling down of strongholds
[1:33:46] i believe god wants you to be free
[1:33:48] tonight stand with me as we sing this
[1:33:51] song
[1:33:51] we've been made more than conquerors do
[1:33:53] you notice it didn't say
[1:33:54] that we made ourselves conquerors but it
[1:33:56] said we've been made more than
[1:33:58] conquerors how
[1:33:59] through the blood of jesus christ we
[1:34:00] just sing this
[1:34:02] song if anybody needs prayer tonight
[1:34:06] you're welcome uh to come while we're
[1:34:08] singing this song
[1:34:10] we serve a god that sets people free
[1:34:13] we serve a god who sets people free and
[1:34:15] i'm just gonna share this
[1:34:16] testimony
[1:34:22] what the devil does is cheat and lie
[1:34:26] he works illegally
[1:34:32] and when god gives you something
[1:34:35] it belongs to you when he gives it to
[1:34:37] you do you know when he gave the
[1:34:38] children israel the promised land
[1:34:40] everybody who was in the promised land
[1:34:42] immediately became trespassers
[1:34:44] because the land belonged to them and
[1:34:47] you have to use the authority that god
[1:34:48] has given you
[1:34:49] to kick out the trespassers and we were
[1:34:52] we were in our
[1:34:53] our um home church we're teaching on
[1:34:57] trespassers
[1:34:58] and we just offered people to come up
[1:35:00] for prayer who wanted deliverance for
[1:35:02] things
[1:35:04] and um young man there some of you have
[1:35:08] heard
[1:35:08] his testimony andrew
[1:35:12] had a gluten allergy for years
[1:35:15] and he wanted deliverance from that god
[1:35:18] didn't give me the gluten allergy
[1:35:20] this stuff came in through sin but god
[1:35:24] paid for him to be free from that
[1:35:25] wasn't a fancy prayer just spoke to the
[1:35:29] trespasser
[1:35:30] and said leave him now in the name of
[1:35:32] jesus
[1:35:35] and he was free and the great part about
[1:35:38] it was a lot of the neighbors knew about
[1:35:40] it so they began
[1:35:41] telling about the neighbors but do you
[1:35:43] realize that it's not how sincerely we
[1:35:45] pray but it's the authority
[1:35:46] when god speaks that's when it's done
[1:35:49] and so
[1:35:50] what as as we sing this song you know
[1:35:52] i'm not i don't believe in twisting
[1:35:53] people's arm for prayer but if you want
[1:35:55] prayer tonight
[1:35:56] if you've been struggling with something
[1:35:59] and you need to be delivered from a
[1:36:01] stronghold that you can't be
[1:36:04] god will set you free tonight we've been
[1:36:09] made more than conquerors
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:17] overcomers in this life
[1:36:24] we've been made victorious
[1:36:33] through the blood of jesus christ
[1:36:41] we've been made more than
[1:36:46] conquerors
[1:36:50] overcomers in this life
[1:36:57] we've been made victorious
[1:37:06] through the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:14] we've been made more than calm
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:24] overcomers in this life
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:31] we've been
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:40] through the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:49] amen amen god bless you tonight
[1:37:53] i trust that god has
[1:37:59] spoken to you by by his word
[1:38:03] you know so it's so simple the devil
[1:38:05] likes to get us all
[1:38:08] twisted up but it's as simple as
[1:38:11] believing and confessing
[1:38:13] and it happens because god said it what
[1:38:15] happened
[1:38:16] amen brother paul
[1:38:31] praise the lord well i just
[1:38:34] say that jesus
[1:38:37] has provided a way for all of you
[1:38:42] and if he didn't provide that way then
[1:38:45] there's a real hell there's a real place
[1:38:46] that we go with our
[1:38:48] but we have a place to bring our sin and
[1:38:50] it's offered every young person tonight
[1:38:52] so i wouldn't leave the service or if we
[1:38:54] even close the service and
[1:38:56] and this simple message shows you the
[1:38:59] power to be able to overcome
[1:39:01] you got to begin to believe what god has
[1:39:03] done for you
[1:39:04] if you haven't personally done that it's
[1:39:05] not about your parents believing it's
[1:39:07] about you believing
[1:39:08] if you feel a pull to give your heart to
[1:39:10] god and be baptized
[1:39:12] even if it's dismissed if you want to
[1:39:13] come forward i would do that because
[1:39:16] it's the only way
[1:39:17] that provides a way that there'd be no
[1:39:20] damnation of hell for us that he
[1:39:21] provided a way for us to be saved can
[1:39:23] you say man
[1:39:25] and i
