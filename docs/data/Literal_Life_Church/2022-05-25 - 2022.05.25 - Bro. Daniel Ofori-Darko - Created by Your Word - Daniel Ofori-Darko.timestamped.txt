[0:04] we open our scripture to first king
[0:05] chapter 17
[0:12] and then
[0:14] we will also read matthew chapter 17.
[0:23] first king chapter 17 we read
[0:27] verse 1.
[0:31] let's hear the word of god
[0:34] say elijah the tishbite
[0:37] who was of the inhabitants of gillette
[0:40] said unto aha
[0:41] as the lord god of israel leave it
[0:44] before whom i stand
[0:46] there shall not be due
[0:47] nor reign these years but according to
[0:51] my word
[0:55] matthew chapter 17.
[0:58] and
[0:59] 20th
[1:01] verse
[1:04] and jesus said unto them
[1:06] because of your unbelief
[1:08] for verily i say unto you
[1:10] if ye have faith as a grain of mustard
[1:13] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[1:16] remove
[1:17] hands to yonder place and it shall
[1:19] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[1:22] unto you
[1:24] the lord that is blessing to the reading
[1:26] of his word amen let's take our sea
[1:35] tonight
[1:37] the lord have laid
[1:40] something upon our hearts
[1:43] and uh in god will we will share
[1:46] together
[1:47] and the title
[1:50] of this short semon is creating by your
[1:53] word
[1:56] creating by your word
[1:59] hallelujah
[2:02] well the bible said
[2:04] where's our
[2:06] spirits things that come from our mouth
[2:10] they are spirits
[2:12] and that is the reason why as a
[2:14] christian
[2:15] anything that you say you must be very
[2:18] careful
[2:21] god bless you
[2:24] amen
[2:26] you know your words can be a blessing to
[2:29] someone
[2:30] and at the same time it can be a case
[2:34] so anything that proceeds out of your
[2:36] mouth
[2:38] you must check it
[2:40] it must be seasoned
[2:44] because by that same power
[2:48] that came from god
[2:51] establish every creation
[2:53] under this heaven
[2:56] um sometimes the scientists will tell us
[2:59] that the world has been in existence it
[3:01] is three million years
[3:05] some say billion billion years
[3:08] i don't know where they get that
[3:09] information from
[3:11] but thank god we have a prophet who told
[3:13] us
[3:14] the year of this earth
[3:18] but of course
[3:19] nobody can determine how long our god
[3:23] was in existence
[3:25] before one day he got up
[3:28] and he said let there be
[3:30] and there was
[3:35] he said let there be light
[3:37] and there was light all over the place
[3:40] and so he created all his creation
[3:44] by his word
[3:47] and after
[3:49] his creation
[3:51] the bible said that then
[3:53] he made man he created man also
[3:56] and he gave man the ability the power
[4:01] to also create
[4:03] because man
[4:04] was in the image of god
[4:08] of all the creations of god it was only
[4:11] man
[4:12] that god made him in his own image
[4:16] in his likeliness
[4:19] in fact the prophet tells you that that
[4:20] is why god could not cast adam
[4:24] because
[4:26] when he looked on adam he found out that
[4:28] if he kissed adam he has scares himself
[4:31] so he couldn't curse it he said adam for
[4:33] thy sake case is the ground
[4:38] hallelujah
[4:40] so ma was given that opportunity that
[4:42] ability you know we we know that even
[4:45] god gave adam
[4:47] the power and authority to name all the
[4:50] creations that he created
[4:54] all the trees
[4:55] all the animals in the forest the best
[4:58] in the world adam was the one that named
[5:01] all
[5:03] because god gave him that ability and
[5:05] power
[5:07] the bible said that at the cool of the
[5:09] night as we have gathered this evening
[5:12] god will descend into the garden and
[5:13] have fellowship with adam
[5:16] so
[5:17] the unfortunate happened
[5:19] over there
[5:21] and it broke the fellowship
[5:23] between god and man
[5:26] and god said
[5:27] because of what you have done
[5:30] you till the ground before you feed
[5:32] yourself
[5:34] it means from the beginning it was not
[5:36] so
[5:38] god provided for them
[5:41] but when sin came into the garden of
[5:43] eden to affect the relationship between
[5:46] man and god
[5:47] man lost that opportunity
[5:51] so his creative power was taken from him
[5:54] and man became so miserable
[5:57] you understand
[5:58] because
[5:59] adam didn't like the condition
[6:02] now let me ask you a question before i
[6:04] continue
[6:07] the whole world
[6:09] consider america to be
[6:11] the number one country is that
[6:13] do you know that
[6:15] and i think you also believe that
[6:18] that your country is the number one
[6:19] country
[6:22] there's money there's everything there
[6:24] is food everything
[6:25] and millions of people
[6:28] are always trying to enter into america
[6:32] you are aware of that because it's a
[6:35] nation that they think everything is
[6:37] okay
[6:39] now let me ask you a question will you
[6:41] be happy
[6:43] when they will tell you tomorrow morning
[6:45] get out from america
[6:47] and go and live
[6:49] in one of this poorest country will you
[6:52] be happy about that
[6:54] certainly not
[6:56] no no no no how can you leave america
[6:58] and forget about your pizza and the
[7:00] hamburgers and ice creams
[7:03] where would you get those things
[7:06] certainly you don't like it
[7:08] and that was the condition of adam
[7:11] because he lost those privileges
[7:14] he lost that power and he was because he
[7:17] became so miserable
[7:19] when he left the garden of eden
[7:22] but do you know that god was also
[7:24] miserable
[7:28] yes because god also lost his fellowship
[7:33] god lost his god god lost his follow you
[7:36] so he also became miserable god didn't
[7:38] like the situation
[7:42] amen look
[7:45] if the marriage could pose will be
[7:47] sincere
[7:51] the day you allow you allow the enemy to
[7:54] bring confusion between you
[7:57] how do you feel
[7:59] when your wife would turn her head this
[8:01] way and you you turn your head that way
[8:05] do you feel good
[8:07] yes sir
[8:09] you will not feel good
[8:11] because that is not what you're married
[8:13] for
[8:14] you married for fellowship
[8:17] so when anything break that fellowship
[8:19] whether the fault of the man or the
[8:21] woman there becomes some you know
[8:25] what should i use here
[8:27] uncertainty
[8:30] you lose your joy
[8:33] for one day
[8:34] or two days
[8:36] or three days
[8:37] no don't do that
[8:39] don't allow the devil to push you into
[8:40] those conditions
[8:42] if anything is risen at all bend it
[8:44] immediately
[8:46] and so god himself didn't like the
[8:48] situation
[8:49] so you know what he did he found another
[8:52] way to restore the fellowship back
[8:57] hallelujah
[8:59] i love that brother sister because that
[9:01] is where somebody like me i found myself
[9:05] god found another way to restore that
[9:08] fellowship
[9:11] you remember when you called
[9:14] people like enoch and noes and those all
[9:18] of them it was a way that he was
[9:21] looking to restore that fellowship
[9:24] and one day
[9:26] there was a man
[9:28] that was living with his father and his
[9:30] family
[9:33] and he had a voice
[9:35] from nowhere
[9:37] abram
[9:39] get out from among your people
[9:41] and go to a place that i will show you
[9:45] and i'll make a nation out of you
[9:49] my
[9:50] abraham
[9:51] didn't know the god that was talking to
[9:54] him
[9:55] but he only had a voice
[9:58] but by faith
[10:00] he followed the voice
[10:04] when god called abram
[10:06] he put in him faith
[10:10] you see it was a way that he was
[10:13] restoring the fellowship back
[10:19] so abraham god put in him faith
[10:23] because at that time the wife that he
[10:26] was living with was barren
[10:28] and
[10:29] everybody knew that no this this cannot
[10:32] be possible
[10:33] especially when god promised them a
[10:35] child
[10:37] but because of the faith that god
[10:39] restored or god put in abraham
[10:43] he maintain it no matter the condition
[10:47] the ways of abraham created the child
[10:50] for him
[10:53] in fact i like the way the prophet
[10:55] dramatized it
[10:57] he said when the promise came the first
[10:58] month
[11:00] abraham called his wife
[11:03] honey
[11:05] what is the situation what's the
[11:06] condition
[11:08] he said
[11:09] my lord
[11:10] it's the old story i don't i don't i
[11:13] don't see any any change
[11:16] and everyone say bless god there shall
[11:18] be a performance
[11:21] another time
[11:23] he will ask the same thing
[11:24] the same islam will come
[11:27] can you imagine
[11:28] abraham
[11:29] enter them into shops
[11:32] well that time i don't know whether
[11:33] walmart or
[11:35] uh maya or whatever it was
[11:38] and abraham
[11:41] will be buying
[11:42] baby food
[11:47] he will be buying baby dress
[11:51] hallelujah he will buy him sure
[11:54] that he will put their baby in the child
[11:58] and the people will look at abraham say
[12:00] this man are you serious
[12:02] are you buying it for your for your for
[12:04] your for your friends or what he said no
[12:07] my wife sarah is going to give me a
[12:10] child
[12:11] and i'm getting myself prepared
[12:13] what was that it was his weight
[12:16] it was his weight
[12:18] based on his faith in the word of god
[12:21] and one day he asked the same question
[12:25] it's why
[12:27] sarah
[12:28] what do you feel now
[12:30] he said my lord
[12:32] today
[12:33] i felt unusual within me
[12:36] i i find something moving i don't know
[12:39] what it is i've never experienced it
[12:41] before
[12:42] and i feel like i feel nausea you
[12:44] understand
[12:46] abraham said bless the lord
[12:48] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[12:52] his word
[12:54] created
[12:57] oh brother sister
[12:59] you know something
[13:00] and based on this faith that god put in
[13:03] abraham
[13:05] when his nephew lot
[13:09] okay joined himself to sodom and
[13:11] gomorrah
[13:13] and then
[13:14] five nations came together and attacked
[13:16] sodom
[13:18] and
[13:19] lord was taken captive
[13:21] we know the story already
[13:23] one man escaped
[13:25] and told abraham
[13:27] the unfortunate incident
[13:30] but abram didn't say that well the
[13:34] nephew
[13:35] proves stubborn and for that matter that
[13:38] is up to him
[13:39] abraham didn't do that
[13:41] but the bible said that abram
[13:43] immediately organized the 300 men in his
[13:46] house
[13:48] he said hey
[13:50] we are going to rescue my nephew lord
[13:55] now think about this
[13:57] how on earth can
[13:59] 318 men
[14:01] go and face five nations
[14:06] but by faith
[14:09] abraham marched against those five
[14:12] nations
[14:13] and the bible said that when they got
[14:15] there he divided the 318 men
[14:19] and they pursued these five nations they
[14:22] conquered them and they rescued lord in
[14:25] his household
[14:28] it was a great victory that day
[14:31] and this
[14:33] made god
[14:35] pull one of the bodies over there in
[14:38] heaven
[14:39] and jumped into it
[14:41] and descended upon this earth and he
[14:44] walked as a man
[14:46] by a name melchizedek
[14:49] in fact
[14:51] god couldn't sit on his throne
[14:54] but he came down to encourage abraham
[14:56] for the faith and love he demonstrated
[15:01] he said wow
[15:03] i have not come to see you only but i
[15:06] brought communion and wine
[15:10] i want to dine with you
[15:12] because you have overcome this world
[15:17] you have overcome every obstacle
[15:20] you have overcome troubles you have
[15:22] overcome temptation
[15:24] you have overcome the world
[15:26] and for that matter you deserve
[15:28] fellowship
[15:30] and mercy
[15:32] gave
[15:32] abraham communion
[15:35] he demonstrated the love
[15:38] he demonstrated a creative power
[15:41] hallelujah
[15:43] now let's read something in genesis
[15:45] genesis chapter 14
[15:50] verse
[15:53] verse 18.
[16:00] and melchizedek
[16:02] king of salem
[16:04] brought forth bread and wine
[16:08] okay
[16:08] and he was the priest of the most high
[16:11] god
[16:13] and he blessed him
[16:15] and said
[16:16] blessed be abraham of the most high god
[16:19] possessor of heaven and earth
[16:23] he blessed abram
[16:26] oh hallelujah
[16:29] make history bless everyone
[16:32] because of what abraham did
[16:35] because the faith he demonstrated
[16:38] hallelujah and he promised him another
[16:41] time he met him again over somewhere
[16:45] and that was where he called him lord
[16:48] he
[16:50] don't pass come to my house
[16:53] let my wife prepare something for you
[16:55] before you continue your journey
[16:57] and it was that time the promise came
[17:00] for sarah
[17:03] and abram stood on his face and that
[17:05] thing was made manifest
[17:07] today people don't know who mercury was
[17:10] intellectuals
[17:13] uh
[17:14] their theologians
[17:16] they will discuss this and discuss this
[17:19] and discuss this
[17:21] but they lack revelation
[17:23] to see
[17:24] god
[17:25] he said that the bible say that he has
[17:27] no beginning of days he has no ending of
[17:29] days he has no father he has no mother
[17:32] and there is only one
[17:35] entity or
[17:36] deity that qualified for this and that
[17:38] is god the creator
[17:41] he is the only one
[17:43] that don't have beginning of days that
[17:45] don't have ending of days he doesn't
[17:47] have mother he doesn't have mother and
[17:49] so mechanic was god
[17:54] but when the prophet paul was explaining
[17:56] the characteristics of mercy
[17:59] we'll find out that
[18:01] mckisson
[18:02] of the old testament who had the
[18:04] creative power to promise to abraham was
[18:07] jesus christ who came in the new
[18:09] testament
[18:11] and when christ also came he
[18:13] demonstrated his creative power
[18:15] by his word
[18:19] so he said he that believeth in me
[18:21] the words that i do shall you also do
[18:26] by his word so if you use his word to
[18:29] create you can also use your word to
[18:31] create
[18:34] hallelujah
[18:36] because he said it was not ordinary
[18:40] and for that matter jesus christ was not
[18:42] also ordinary
[18:45] remember the day that he was working
[18:47] with his disciples
[18:50] and then they came to meet a certain
[18:52] blind man
[18:54] you see the disciples where
[18:56] those who ask jesus the question it's a
[18:59] master
[19:00] who did sin
[19:02] in this this man
[19:04] himself
[19:06] that he was born blind
[19:08] or the parents
[19:11] jesus says something
[19:14] and sometimes we look down over right
[19:18] he said
[19:20] neither this man or their parents
[19:24] saint
[19:25] but this man was born blind
[19:29] that the glory of god
[19:31] might be made manifest
[19:35] hallelujah you say beloved brothers and
[19:37] sisters let us understand
[19:39] that our situations and our conditions
[19:42] cannot be the same
[19:45] it varies
[19:47] but no matter what we go through let's
[19:50] give glory to god
[19:54] jesus said
[19:55] that the glory of god the man didn't
[19:57] have to be born blind
[19:59] but god knew why he was born blind
[20:02] just to make the glory of god manifest
[20:05] oh praise be the name of our god
[20:08] and after jesus said that he looked
[20:10] around
[20:11] and he saw that particularly
[20:14] we were created from the claim
[20:18] but the prophet said that man consists
[20:20] of 16 elements
[20:21] yes the atom the potash the potassium
[20:24] the petroleum and all that
[20:27] rather i cannot determine the type of
[20:29] clay god used in making my ear
[20:33] because if you look the texture of my
[20:36] ear is different from the texture of my
[20:39] tongue
[20:41] don't you see that
[20:44] my elbow
[20:46] is hot
[20:47] i don't know the type of clay god used
[20:49] to do it
[20:51] and for that matter i don't know the
[20:53] type of clay god used to make my eye
[20:55] but i believe that that day
[20:58] whereas over there he saw the clay he
[21:00] used innate in the eye of a man
[21:03] and his part on that plane
[21:06] and he met peter out of the clay and
[21:08] anointed the eye of the man
[21:10] he said go and wash
[21:12] and the man washed went and washed and
[21:15] he saw
[21:16] oh praise be the name of our god
[21:20] the pharisees should have rejoiced
[21:24] but then because of their false doctrine
[21:29] because of their hypocrisy
[21:32] they have told all the people nobody
[21:34] should believe on jesus rights
[21:37] but i can't go for the life of the blind
[21:39] man
[21:41] when they questioned him
[21:43] he said well
[21:45] he anointed my eye with mad
[21:47] and he told me to go and wash and i went
[21:50] and i watched and i did see
[21:53] and they asked him what do you make of
[21:55] that man he said he's a prophet
[21:58] and the bible said that they didn't
[21:59] believe that
[22:00] so they went and called the parents of
[22:03] this man
[22:04] they asked their parents
[22:07] are you sure this is your son
[22:10] whom you say you were born blind they
[22:13] said yes
[22:14] how then
[22:15] is he seeing now
[22:18] isn't that climb
[22:20] is it a crime
[22:21] that somebody should receive his or her
[22:23] healing
[22:26] now think about the mentality of the
[22:27] pharisees
[22:31] you see that is why i don't understand
[22:34] that today so many families
[22:37] are making sure that their children will
[22:40] not believe this message
[22:44] many families are making sure that their
[22:47] children will be remain in their
[22:49] denominations
[22:51] when their denomination cannot change
[22:52] their lives
[22:55] hallelujah
[22:57] brother sister we have been over there
[23:00] before
[23:01] we were just church members
[23:05] yes sir
[23:06] i know satan don't like what i'm saying
[23:08] but it's true
[23:09] we are just church madness
[23:11] we worship god's heart all right
[23:14] until god opened our eyes to know this
[23:16] message of the server
[23:18] and we started our christian journey
[23:22] so their parents were afraid if they
[23:24] said something in support of their son
[23:27] they would be excommunicated from the
[23:28] church
[23:29] so they asked them they said well this
[23:32] is our son
[23:33] we know he was born blind
[23:35] but as to how he can see now we don't
[23:37] know he is of age ask him
[23:40] they asked him the second time the man
[23:42] said you have already asked me i have
[23:45] told you i didn't believe it why do you
[23:47] ask me again
[23:49] do you also want to be his prophet or
[23:51] his servant
[23:52] they say no
[23:53] that man cannot be our our leader
[23:57] moses is our leader that man is a sinner
[24:00] oh the man laughed
[24:02] say what thing are you telling me
[24:05] you

[24:14] you ever heard
[24:16] that somebody can open the eye of a
[24:18] blind man

[24:22] have been able to do that
[24:23] they said no no he's a sinner he's a
[24:26] legitimate born
[24:27] and this is what the man said
[24:30] he said whether he's a sinner or not i
[24:34] don't want to know anything about it
[24:36] one time i knew
[24:38] i was blind once but now i can see

[24:51] message away
[24:52] i don't care how people bend the message

[25:11] we are free from the dangers of this
[25:13] world
[25:14] because of the message of this hour
[25:20] amen
[25:23] he said once i was blind
[25:25] but now i can see
[25:29] the creative word
[25:31] of jesus christ
[25:32] is in the church today
[25:35] the creative power of god is in you
[25:37] today
[25:38] it only will be on line of duty
[25:41] anything that you say
[25:43] it must be made manifest
[25:46] that day
[25:48] on a mountain
[25:50] elijah did a miracle
[25:53] he said
[25:55] so long as i live
[25:58] ah
[25:59] there will not be any rain
[26:03] but according to my word
[26:06] this was the period that
[26:08] israel has entered into idolatry
[26:12] the worship of god was no longer there
[26:16] everyone was doing anything he or she
[26:19] could hold him
[26:22] and
[26:23] it was so much on elijah
[26:27] and he called
[26:29] other people
[26:31] so because of your unbelief
[26:34] because of your i don't watch it
[26:36] i am locking
[26:38] up the skies
[26:40] i am locking up the heavens
[26:42] it will never rain
[26:46] until i call for it
[26:49] it was his weight
[26:52] and when he said that
[26:55] god
[26:56] stomped it
[26:57] and it was filled
[27:00] three and a half years no reign
[27:03] by
[27:07] how are we going to grow our crops
[27:10] there was farming all over the land
[27:13] and now
[27:14] god have already told elijah to go to a
[27:16] place
[27:17] and he was there he was fed
[27:19] by ravens
[27:21] they brought food
[27:23] for him to you know make goodies of it
[27:26] until
[27:27] that food
[27:28] was no more coming
[27:30] and god said go to that widow
[27:34] that is the god that we are worshiping
[27:37] you can never understand him
[27:39] the only thing you can do is to believe
[27:41] him
[27:42] why will god send enlarger to a widow
[27:45] who don't have anything
[27:47] he said go there and she would take care
[27:49] of you now when elijah made the woman
[27:52] breaking sex
[27:54] the woman said master we don't even have
[27:56] anything
[27:57] there is only one muscle of what you
[27:59] call and i'm going to knead it and bake
[28:02] bread for myself and my son and when we
[28:05] eat it we'll die because there's nothing
[28:08] elijah said yes i know that but go and
[28:10] do for me first
[28:13] that is the god that we are worshiping
[28:16] you don't have to understand god
[28:19] you only have to believe god
[28:21] based on his word
[28:23] and when you believe on his word there
[28:26] must be a performance of anything that
[28:28] you declare
[28:32] and when the whole place was so much
[28:34] firming
[28:37] then elijah
[28:38] appeared
[28:40] he met obadiah it's all baday i said
[28:43] master we have been looking all over the
[28:45] place for you
[28:47] we don't found you
[28:48] he said well go and tell your master
[28:50] that today
[28:52] he will see me
[28:54] and when he finally met
[28:56] he said now call all the bad prophets
[29:01] let them meet me on mount carmel
[29:04] for today we must determine
[29:07] who is the god of israel
[29:10] he is bow is god
[29:14] let the people worship him
[29:17] if jehovah god is god let the people
[29:19] worship him
[29:21] and you see the prophet
[29:24] we're so much confident
[29:27] that they were going to challenge elijah
[29:30] so they met on the mountain you like i
[29:32] said well
[29:33] you are many and i'm alone
[29:37] just finish with your sacrifice and now
[29:39] attend to mine
[29:41] hallelujah
[29:46] and
[29:48] they took their sacrifice
[29:50] they dressed it on the altar
[29:52] and they started chanting
[29:54] they started calling on bar
[29:57] they call and call and call and call and
[29:58] call
[30:00] was not ready to respond
[30:03] and then elijah started mocking them
[30:07] he said oh
[30:08] where is bar
[30:10] is he not answering you
[30:12] shout and they shouted
[30:15] they shouted bad was nowhere to come he
[30:18] said oh
[30:19] i think bao has gone to little pizza he
[30:23] is going to a little caesars he's going
[30:24] to buy pizza so you know chance more
[30:27] chance more chant more they chanted
[30:29] enchanted enchanted bar couldn't answer
[30:34] and do you know that they ended up
[30:36] cutting themselves with knives
[30:40] bible said that their body was filled
[30:42] with blood
[30:43] because that was how sometimes they do
[30:46] sacrifice to those idols
[30:49] they killed human beings
[30:51] and they used the blood
[30:53] so when they called and called and baal
[30:55] was not answering they started cutting
[30:57] themselves
[30:58] that perhaps
[31:00] he may respond to them he did it and
[31:02] they did it and they did it it was the
[31:04] same story
[31:06] how do you think val will make that
[31:09] mistake
[31:11] if bob was a demon
[31:13] he recognized the presence of god on
[31:15] mount carmel that day
[31:18] so so long as elijah was standing over
[31:21] there on the mountain
[31:23] bar will never make that mistake
[31:26] hallelujah
[31:28] he knew that god was over there on the
[31:30] mountain how can he go there
[31:34] and beloved
[31:36] as you are filled with the holy spirit
[31:39] any place that you stand
[31:42] god is standing by you
[31:45] anything that you say according to the
[31:48] word of god god is standing by you
[31:52] see jesus said if we have faith like the
[31:54] mustard seed
[31:56] and we don't doubt what we say it must
[31:59] be
[32:00] because our god has not changed
[32:06] then
[32:07] after
[32:08] some time
[32:09] elijah said oh okay
[32:12] it's good
[32:13] if your god have not answered you
[32:15] it's my pain
[32:18] and then he mounted
[32:22] the altar
[32:23] with 12 stones which represent the 12
[32:25] tribes of israel
[32:28] he killed the sacrifice
[32:31] he placed it upon the altar
[32:34] and he requested for 12 barrels of water
[32:37] to pour upon it to watch the sacrifice
[32:42] and he said lord
[32:44] i have done this according to your word
[32:50] when he said that
[32:51] fire came from heaven
[32:55] and all the people were shocked
[32:59] and they started shouting
[33:01] oh lord god our lord god god is god god
[33:05] is god jehovah god is god
[33:10] and
[33:10] the bad prophet
[33:12] was so much shaking
[33:15] they wanted to run away
[33:17] elijah said no way
[33:20] don't allow any of them to escape
[33:23] make sure you kill
[33:25] every one of them
[33:28] and that day they make sure they kill
[33:31] everyone of the bad prophets
[33:37] the day that the holy ghost came into us
[33:42] that day we kill every bald prophet in
[33:46] our lives
[33:49] we kill every unbelief in our hearts
[33:53] we kill anything that will discourage us
[33:56] from going forward as christians in our
[33:58] lives
[34:00] in our surroundings
[34:02] any environment that was full of
[34:04] unbelief we kill it from around us
[34:09] and that is the reason why
[34:12] by god's grace we are pressed on till
[34:15] today
[34:16] we kill jezebel by the way of elijah
[34:20] jezebel was killed by the word of elijah
[34:23] adam was killed
[34:25] and every unbelief surrounded him
[34:28] and that is what beloved beloved
[34:30] children of god we have to use the word
[34:33] of god from our mouth
[34:36] to create an atmosphere
[34:38] that will make us happy
[34:40] amen
[34:42] oh yes
[34:44] we all know how
[34:46] god used moses
[34:48] to bring the israelites
[34:50] from bondage
[34:52] and after all the miracles and
[34:55] you know pledge that god use the hand of
[34:57] moses to to rot in egypt
[35:01] finally
[35:02] pharaoh allowed them to leave
[35:05] and when they were leaving
[35:07] the bible said that their fellow pharaoh
[35:09] realized that no he had made a mistake
[35:12] for making the egyptian i'm sorry the
[35:14] israelites leave his country who was
[35:16] going to do their work for them
[35:18] so he organized his soldiers
[35:21] they chased israel
[35:23] but unfortunately
[35:26] israel
[35:27] were also stabbed
[35:29] before the red sea
[35:31] and so when they saw the egyptians
[35:33] suggest you know just pursuing them
[35:37] they became so
[35:39] alarmed
[35:40] and they started crying
[35:42] and shouting on moses
[35:45] why
[35:46] are there no graves in egypt
[35:49] that your brothers here to die on the
[35:51] wilderness
[35:52] moses
[35:54] this is what we told you in egypt that
[35:57] allowed us to be servants
[36:00] to the egyptians
[36:03] in fact
[36:06] they saw
[36:07] the dust
[36:09] over there
[36:10] by the chariots
[36:12] that they were pursuing them
[36:15] and they were melted
[36:16] oh my
[36:19] i thank god that we have those things
[36:20] for example
[36:23] why should we
[36:24] melt
[36:26] because an enemy is pursuing you
[36:29] have you forgotten the god that saved
[36:32] you from the hand of pharaoh
[36:36] have you forgotten that because of you
[36:39] god brought flocks from nowhere
[36:41] to torment the egyptians
[36:44] have you forgotten that because of you
[36:46] god turned water into blood
[36:48] and people of egypt could not drink
[36:51] have you forgotten that because of you
[36:54] god brought lookers to destroy the crops
[36:56] of the egyptians
[36:57] because of you have you forgotten that
[37:00] because of you there were three days
[37:02] darkness in egypt
[37:05] have people just forgotten that
[37:07] and more so for your sake
[37:09] god killed every firstborn
[37:13] have you forgotten that so soon
[37:16] have you forgotten that
[37:19] and the people standing at the red sea
[37:21] and they were crying
[37:24] until moses also cried
[37:28] oh god have mercy
[37:31] brother when the situation arrives
[37:33] don't cry well it depends upon your
[37:36] condition
[37:38] even if you cry
[37:40] cry because you have a god
[37:44] after your cry
[37:47] don't discourage yourself just pick the
[37:49] word
[37:51] because i know that people are emotional
[37:54] okay sometimes bro it's not because they
[37:56] pull up they have problems they cry
[37:58] sometimes even when they are happy they
[38:00] cry
[38:02] haven't you seen that before
[38:05] we've seen a lot of people crying when
[38:07] they are happy
[38:10] i've seen a man
[38:12] okay
[38:13] going to
[38:14] bless his marriage
[38:16] and when he saw his wife
[38:18] the father bringing the wife
[38:21] he started crying
[38:23] why
[38:24] so sometimes people cry when there's no
[38:26] trouble people cry when they be happy
[38:29] but i said no matter condition you found
[38:31] yourself after the crying you have to
[38:33] know that there is a god
[38:37] hallelujah
[38:39] they cried and cried and cried moses
[38:42] why
[38:44] but then look at what god did
[38:47] god immediately placed the pillar of
[38:50] fire
[38:51] between the israelites and the egyptians
[38:55] and they were not able to come and
[38:56] attack them
[38:57] do you know that every place that you
[38:59] are there is angels around you
[39:02] as a child of god
[39:04] do you know that the prophet said that
[39:06] any place that the messages the pillar
[39:09] of fire will be around
[39:11] and today where is the message the
[39:13] message is in your heart the message is
[39:15] from you that wherever you are the
[39:17] pillar of fire is around you
[39:20] let us believe that brothers and sisters
[39:22] don't let that just say it let us
[39:25] believe it and let it be part of us
[39:29] amen
[39:32] and this
[39:33] affected moses
[39:35] until moses himself started to cry
[39:40] oh god
[39:42] what can we do
[39:44] the egyptians are coming
[39:47] but then he was still encouraging the
[39:49] people
[39:51] he said wait and see the salvation of
[39:54] god
[39:56] for these egyptians that you see today
[39:59] you will never see them again in your
[40:00] life
[40:01] but when you are doing that you are
[40:03] still crying
[40:05] because the people of influence know so
[40:07] much
[40:08] but what did god tell him let's read the
[40:10] exodus
[40:16] exodus
[40:18] chapter 14.
[40:30] elder chapter 14 verse 10
[40:33] let's see something quickly there
[40:39] and when pharaoh drew 9
[40:42] the children of israel lifted up their
[40:44] eyes
[40:45] and behold the egyptians much after them
[40:49] and they were so afraid
[40:52] and the children of israel cried out
[40:54] unto the lord
[40:56] and they said unto moses
[40:58] because there were no graves in egypt
[41:01] had thou taking us away to die in the
[41:04] wilderness
[41:05] wherefore her doubt dealt that's with us
[41:08] to carry us
[41:10] forth out of egypt
[41:12] verse 12.
[41:14] is it not this the word that we did tell
[41:16] thee in egypt
[41:18] saying let us alone
[41:21] that we may serve the egyptians
[41:23] for it had been better for us to serve
[41:26] the egyptians than that we should die in
[41:29] the wilderness
[41:30] verse 14
[41:31] and moses said unto the people
[41:34] fear yeah not
[41:36] stand still and see the salvation of the
[41:39] lord which he will show to you today for
[41:42] the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye
[41:46] shall see them again no more forever
[41:49] the lord shall fight for you
[41:51] and you shall hold your peace
[41:55] i want the believer to say amen here
[41:59] verse 15
[42:00] and the lord said unto moses
[42:03] wherefore christ died unto me
[42:06] speak
[42:07] unto the children of israel that they go
[42:10] forward
[42:12] this is the challenge
[42:14] speak unto the children of israel that
[42:17] they'll go forward yes i know that they
[42:20] have come to a hindrance
[42:22] but speak to them
[42:24] let them go forward beloved brothers and
[42:26] sisters
[42:27] anything that you face in life speak to
[42:30] that situation and go forward
[42:34] don't slide back
[42:37] because of situations that arise in your
[42:39] life
[42:41] don't slide back because of certain you
[42:43] know
[42:44] unusual condition
[42:46] don't slide back and say that oh brother
[42:50] pastor is too much on me
[42:53] if anything is too much on you nothing
[42:55] is too much for god just turn on the
[42:58] word of god and tell yourself go forward
[43:04] god knew
[43:06] that the people has come to face they
[43:08] have come before the red sea and there
[43:10] was no way they were going to cross
[43:13] but god said tell them to go forward
[43:18] until you take a self beloved brother
[43:20] you don't know what god has prepared for
[43:22] you
[43:24] until you take a step
[43:25] no matter the situation i say you don't
[43:28] know what god has prepared for you
[43:31] praise the name of his of his praise the
[43:34] name of our god amen
[43:38] he said tell them to go forward
[43:40] but lift down up thy road
[43:43] and stretch out thy hand over the sea
[43:46] and divide it
[43:49] and the children of israel shall go on a
[43:52] dry ground
[43:53] through the midst of the sea
[43:57] amen
[43:59] tell them to go forward and i remember
[44:02] when moses said that who was going to
[44:04] take the first step
[44:07] there was just stunning at the break of
[44:09] this red sea
[44:11] and god said straightforward your road
[44:14] and you stretched it
[44:16] and the bible said that the water
[44:18] spotted into two
[44:20] and they walk on a dry ground
[44:22] have you thought of that beloved
[44:26] that the red sea
[44:28] was there since from creation
[44:30] and in fact you and i
[44:32] we cannot determine the volume of the
[44:36] mud
[44:37] under the water
[44:39] even when the rains come for just about
[44:42] five minutes
[44:44] look the way
[44:45] the ground becomes so muddy
[44:48] and these waters have been dead since
[44:51] creation
[44:53] you see god will never make a mistake
[44:56] he said don't walk on the dry ground
[45:00] no matter what
[45:01] and that is the god that we are serving
[45:04] and it is based upon how you look at on
[45:08] him
[45:09] the way and manner you consider him
[45:12] he will perform the same in your life
[45:15] the way you seek out to be that is the
[45:17] way he will appear to you
[45:20] hallelujah
[45:24] and immediately
[45:26] the grounds were dry
[45:29] israel walked on a dry ground to the red
[45:32] sea
[45:33] but can you imagine
[45:36] then the egyptians wanted to trace them
[45:39] in the same track
[45:41] and god did not prepare that trap for
[45:43] the egyptians he prepared it for the
[45:45] israelites
[45:47] oh hallelujah
[45:49] so the place that the israelites walked
[45:51] on a dry ground when the egyptians just
[45:54] got there then it turned into muddy
[45:56] place
[45:58] because god was not their god
[46:01] amen
[46:03] are you catching it beloved
[46:05] and they walk on it so that is the
[46:07] reason why they could not chase and
[46:10] catch the israelites because they found
[46:13] themselves in mud
[46:14] and their horses and their chariots god
[46:17] the bible said that god removed those
[46:19] wheels
[46:21] and they were stuck in their mouth
[46:23] and after the last person of israel
[46:25] crossed
[46:26] god turned the waters back
[46:28] and it swallowed all of them
[46:30] oh hallelujah brother sister
[46:33] don't you see what god has made you to
[46:35] be
[46:36] he has given that ability the power of
[46:38] creation from your
[46:40] word amen
[46:43] when jesus christ was passing on that
[46:46] street that day
[46:48] the bible said that there was a woman
[46:50] who had infirmities for 12 good years
[46:54] he has been to one hospital to another
[46:58] and no physician was able to to to cure
[47:01] her
[47:02] or yes
[47:04] but look at what this woman did
[47:07] nobody advised her
[47:09] but by a word
[47:12] he created a whole healing
[47:15] he said but if i can touch the hand of
[47:19] his garment i'll be made whole
[47:21] he created her own healing by a word
[47:26] oh praise be the name of our god
[47:30] and indeed
[47:31] she heard the help of the government of
[47:33] jesus
[47:34] and immediately
[47:37] her 12-year problem vanished
[47:42] jesus said wow
[47:44] peter
[47:46] virtue has gone out of me
[47:49] somebody has touched me
[47:52] and peter said master a lot of people
[47:54] have touched you when we're on your way
[47:56] and you are surrounded by a whole lot of
[47:58] people
[47:59] and people are touching you here and
[48:00] there
[48:01] so why do you make such a statement
[48:05] jesus said peter
[48:07] i know a lot of people have touched me
[48:09] but those touches were ordinary touches
[48:13] but this particular touch
[48:17] was a touch of faith
[48:20] because virtues have gone out of me
[48:24] healing victory has gone out of me
[48:27] and so while they were talking like that
[48:29] the woman owner
[48:32] jesus christ look at the woman
[48:34] he's a woman
[48:36] your word
[48:38] have created
[48:40] your own healing
[48:42] amen
[48:46] go in freedom
[48:48] amen
[48:49] so brother sister god has restored us to
[48:53] that power of creation the ability to do
[48:56] what is impossible
[48:59] he said with god all things are possible
[49:03] depending upon where you are standing
[49:06] amen
[49:08] jesus said if you no doubt you can speak
[49:11] to this mountain be thou removed
[49:16] in fact adam
[49:18] had the power
[49:19] to tell that tree hey i don't like where
[49:22] you are standing move and come and
[49:23] sunday and the prophet said that three
[49:26] will have obeyed eden
[49:29] speak to your life
[49:32] speak to your condition
[49:34] create the atmosphere that will bring
[49:36] joy and happiness into your life
[49:39] for god has nothing to be miserable
[49:42] he said you have given us peace
[49:46] hallelujah he said i left peace with you
[49:49] not the peace of the world
[49:53] amen
[49:54] we have the ability we have the power
[49:56] to let our words great for us
[50:00] you remember one time
[50:02] the prophet went with some brethren on
[50:05] hunting
[50:06] and they come and come and come they
[50:08] didn't get it
[50:10] they didn't get the game
[50:12] and it was almost dark
[50:15] so they plan you know i mean closing and
[50:18] getting up to go and have the arrest
[50:21] and this by that time the prophet have
[50:23] separated himself
[50:24] for some time and he said when he
[50:27] thought of going back
[50:29] he heard the voice
[50:32] speak the word
[50:34] he said you have that ability
[50:36] you have that power to create
[50:38] what do you want
[50:40] speak
[50:42] and look around whenever god spoke to
[50:44] him he knew that it was god
[50:46] so he knew that god has come right
[50:49] say lord what should i
[50:51] he say yes you love squirrel
[50:55] call them into existence
[50:59] the prophet was so much convinced that
[51:01] yes it was god that was dealing with him
[51:05] then
[51:06] all of a sudden
[51:08] he said well
[51:10] god
[51:12] i want one squirrel no i'm going to use
[51:15] some blood for example okay
[51:18] i want one squirrel
[51:20] to be on the head of brother gideon
[51:28] i want another spirit
[51:30] to be um brother josiah
[51:33] brad josiah's head
[51:37] i want another squirrel
[51:39] to be on my good sister sherry's head
[51:44] she he requested for three squirrels
[51:49] within no time
[51:51] the spirit
[51:53] was created
[51:55] upon the head of ragidian
[51:59] the prophet robbed his eye
[52:01] to see whether it was real and he found
[52:04] out that it was real
[52:08] he read to his gun
[52:10] and he aimed at the squirrel
[52:13] he shot it
[52:15] and he got
[52:16] it will not quite long
[52:20] he saw the second one on the head of the
[52:22] josiah
[52:24] he shot that one also
[52:27] he got it
[52:29] then
[52:30] he sold another one
[52:33] on the head of the raton
[52:36] and that was even closer than the
[52:38] previous ones
[52:40] he aimed at it he shot it and he missed
[52:43] it
[52:44] he shot it and he missed it
[52:46] he shot it and he switched it he said
[52:48] what
[52:50] this range is rather closer to me
[52:53] why am i missing it so much like that
[52:56] then
[52:58] all of a sudden the one guy requested us
[53:00] to share his head was there
[53:03] and he shot it and you got it oh
[53:05] hallelujah
[53:07] here's what created those creatures
[53:10] but then you ask yourself paul
[53:13] why isn't that
[53:15] the one that came on brother tom's head
[53:18] he missed it
[53:20] because
[53:21] when he was requesting
[53:23] when he was creating by his word he
[53:26] didn't ask that one should be on brother
[53:28] tom's head
[53:30] he said but i'll give your head
[53:32] but jose said a sister share his head
[53:36] oh hallelujah
[53:38] what you say that is what god will do
[53:40] for you
[53:44] amen
[53:45] so you let your word create
[53:48] the atmosphere
[53:50] for you to know that indeed as he spoke
[53:53] his word so is he he said i am not a man
[53:57] that i should lie
[53:59] god will never lie
[54:01] and today he is the same yesterday today
[54:04] and forever
[54:05] but our problem is that we normally or
[54:09] we don't we don't we don't
[54:11] recognize
[54:13] what god has made us to be
[54:16] sometimes believers we think that we are
[54:19] worshiping a historical god
[54:24] the prophet preaches a message
[54:26] he said lifting him out of history
[54:31] let god out from history and bring him
[54:33] into your life today
[54:36] and you'll be the same as he was with
[54:38] elijah
[54:39] he would be the same as he was with
[54:41] abraham he will be the same as what we
[54:43] gave it
[54:44] bring him out from history
[54:50] praise be the name of our god
[54:53] when you speak the word
[54:55] do you know what you have done
[54:57] you have put god into action
[55:02] when you speak
[55:03] you have put god into action
[55:06] hallelujah let your word create
[55:09] you have that ability brother sister
[55:12] to do that
[55:14] create an atmosphere
[55:16] that you can worship god in and be happy
[55:22] oh hallelujah
[55:24] rapper do i have still time
[55:27] i love her
[55:28] okay
[55:29] let me go through this quote and then
[55:31] we'll call it okay
[55:34] i am quoting from all things are
[55:35] possible
[55:37] we'll close very soon
[55:39] he said now just simple trying to hide
[55:42] behind some kind of a
[55:43] church
[55:44] doctrine instead of coming and and
[55:48] saying you ain't got no faith that is
[55:50] all
[55:51] satan never received the holy ghost and
[55:53] satan can never have the holy ghost
[55:55] because he cannot repent
[56:00] he don't have food to give to you okay
[56:02] it is god that has got the faith
[56:05] and just as you are filled with god you
[56:08] are filled with faith
[56:11] if you are the son of god you are like
[56:13] god
[56:15] oh you don't believe that amen
[56:17] or you didn't hear that
[56:19] the prophet said if you are the son of
[56:21] god or a daughter of god
[56:23] you are god amen yeah you have to say
[56:25] amen
[56:27] to declare that you believe
[56:28] it when you become silent here it means
[56:31] you don't believe it
[56:33] are you understanding what we are saying
[56:36] he just speak the word and he creates
[56:38] itself
[56:40] his wish the creative power
[56:44] how the world came into existence he
[56:46] made it out of things which were not
[56:49] he just said let there be and here it is
[56:53] he believed his word
[56:56] so if god believed his word
[56:59] for it to create you must also believe
[57:02] the word for it to create for you
[57:08] amen
[57:10] he said cut every obstacle from human
[57:12] beings
[57:13] that me
[57:14] that might be connected like in the
[57:17] garden of eden
[57:19] cut every obstacle anything that caused
[57:22] the downfall of
[57:23] adam and the woman in the garden he said
[57:26] cut everything out
[57:29] the prophet said i was going to choke it
[57:31] but i am going to say it
[57:35] man is omnipotent
[57:40] he says you don't believe it
[57:44] because the paradox
[57:46] but he is
[57:48] you are
[57:50] according to the prophet
[57:53] he said a man that is fully surrounded
[57:55] to god is omnipotent
[57:58] did not he said in matthew 11 22
[58:00] that what sort of things you say and
[58:03] don't doubt in your heart it will come
[58:05] to pass
[58:06] you can have what you've said
[58:09] hallelujah
[58:11] you can have what you have said
[58:14] you can have what your word will say
[58:18] according to the word of god
[58:21] now let me give a testimony before we
[58:23] close
[58:25] there is a brother
[58:26] that we visited
[58:28] and his son gave us a tremendous
[58:32] testimony
[58:33] he is elected electrician
[58:35] electrical engineer
[58:37] and he was looking for
[58:39] a shop
[58:40] and then
[58:42] he chanced to see
[58:43] an auction or is it functional auction
[58:47] auction
[58:48] of a very huge building
[58:51] and the price on it was eight hundred
[58:53] thousand dollars
[58:56] he didn't have that money
[58:59] but
[59:01] he called the auctioneer and said that i
[59:04] am interested in that building
[59:06] but i have only hundred thousand
[59:10] he said well
[59:11] we are waiting for others to you know
[59:13] call in and then we'll see what we can
[59:15] do about that
[59:16] he waited and waited and waited because
[59:19] he said when he saw that building
[59:22] he said lord
[59:24] i want this building in your name
[59:26] for my business
[59:28] and that was what he said
[59:32] some weeks passed
[59:34] and they called you
[59:36] hey brother
[59:39] you offered that hundred thousand for
[59:41] the building he said yes
[59:43] is it come and take it
[59:47] eight hundred thousand
[59:50] now he only gave hundred thousand
[59:53] for that building
[59:55] and you know what
[59:56] before they even did uh the ocean
[1:00:00] they have already pulled off all the
[1:00:03] roofing the old roofing and you have
[1:00:05] used
[1:00:06] 53 000
[1:00:09] to put new roofing on it
[1:00:13] so it means the brother pays something
[1:00:15] about 40 something thousand for that
[1:00:17] whole building
[1:00:21] isn't wonderful
[1:00:24] his word
[1:00:26] is what created that victory for him
[1:00:29] and brother sister you are not different
[1:00:31] from that
[1:00:32] let your word create the atmosphere for
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:37] amen he said don't doubt
[1:00:40] don't doubt for the same
[1:00:43] amen what happens
[1:00:46] when two or many potentials meet
[1:00:48] when god and man comes together through
[1:00:50] omnipotence something got to shake
[1:00:54] whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:00:56] power of omnipotence of god knowing that
[1:00:59] he has promised it and he said it in his
[1:01:01] word it creates a power that goes out
[1:01:05] yonder and bring things to pass
[1:01:08] thing that is not it make them as though
[1:01:11] they are
[1:01:12] because two or many potents have met
[1:01:15] their distance
[1:01:17] oh it's wonderful
[1:01:19] too omnipotent you and god has met
[1:01:24] when i say you and god it is you because
[1:01:27] the word of god is in you
[1:01:31] and god
[1:01:33] you become one
[1:01:35] he said the whole world will deny me but
[1:01:37] i will not deny myself so if you don't
[1:01:39] deny god's word it means god is in you
[1:01:42] then you become an omnipotent
[1:01:45] and when you meet something has to
[1:01:48] happen that day at the beautiful gate
[1:01:52] when peter and john met the
[1:01:55] the was expecting something from
[1:01:57] them
[1:01:58] and they said silver and gold have we
[1:02:00] men
[1:02:01] but such as we have we are given to you
[1:02:04] hallelujah such as we have we are given
[1:02:08] to you but look on us
[1:02:12] peter didn't say look on me
[1:02:14] or look on the thumb he said look on us
[1:02:18] in the mind and the heart of peter he
[1:02:21] knew that there were not only two but
[1:02:24] there were three because jesus christ
[1:02:26] was standing by again
[1:02:27] he said in the name of jesus christ of
[1:02:30] nazareth rise
[1:02:32] and the man arose
[1:02:34] the crippled man arose and he was
[1:02:37] jumping and was happy and was singing
[1:02:41] the word created
[1:02:45] amen
[1:02:47] what happened
[1:02:49] on a mountain in the west
[1:02:51] on a sunset mountain
[1:02:53] when we were told that rocks were cut in
[1:02:56] promiscuity
[1:02:59] what happened
[1:03:01] when the prophet said that
[1:03:03] there were some beds
[1:03:05] tiny tiny bears and they came to him in
[1:03:08] the form of a pyramid
[1:03:10] and it tends to be doves another time
[1:03:13] then they tend to be like something like
[1:03:15] jack titus no knowing they were seven
[1:03:17] angels
[1:03:19] and they pick him up to the skies
[1:03:21] within a short time they reveal
[1:03:23] everything and he said that this is the
[1:03:26] revelation of the services go and
[1:03:28] project and when they were living there
[1:03:31] formed a cloud in the skies
[1:03:35] and when the pictures were taken
[1:03:38] supernaturally
[1:03:39] we saw the face of jesus christ what
[1:03:42] happened it was because two or many
[1:03:44] potent meant on the mountain
[1:03:47] today
[1:03:48] it is not on the sunset mountain
[1:03:52] today is not on sabrina
[1:03:55] today it is you and jesus christ
[1:03:59] wherever you are something has to happen
[1:04:04] oh brother i wish i have time
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:11] okay let me go my last quote okay
[1:04:15] now
[1:04:16] you say brother brother i need healing
[1:04:19] yes sir
[1:04:20] the promise is yours
[1:04:23] but if you get if you ever get it
[1:04:26] you aren't going to get it easy
[1:04:29] i'm going to tell you that
[1:04:31] you are going to have to take it away
[1:04:33] from satan
[1:04:35] satan captured your health
[1:04:37] you've got a right to go to satan and
[1:04:40] say give it back
[1:04:43] hand my hearing over to me
[1:04:46] i come in the name of the lord
[1:04:48] the possessor of heaven and earth and i
[1:04:51] am his heir
[1:04:52] give it back
[1:04:58] don't let satan capture your healing
[1:05:02] don't let satan put you into any
[1:05:04] frustrated condition
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:08] he said claim it
[1:05:10] the prophet said you are not going to
[1:05:11] get it easy but claim it how do you
[1:05:14] claim it it's just by your word
[1:05:19] sometimes
[1:05:20] we go to the hospital
[1:05:22] doctors will diagnose us
[1:05:25] and you'll find now that there are some
[1:05:28] problems in our body
[1:05:30] they will find out that there are some
[1:05:32] diseases in our body
[1:05:34] it is true that diseases are in our body
[1:05:37] but don't accept it
[1:05:41] don't accept it
[1:05:44] every whatever we call it a laboratory
[1:05:46] test will prove that yes you have this
[1:05:49] you have that you have this you love
[1:05:50] that yes i say it is true but don't
[1:05:53] accept it
[1:05:55] because sickness does not belong to you
[1:05:58] sickness is of the devil
[1:06:01] the prophet said that every sickness
[1:06:03] there is a demon behind it it's only
[1:06:06] signs that are giving them names
[1:06:09] and don't accept it
[1:06:14] i was at the hospital some time back
[1:06:17] and uh
[1:06:19] they tested me
[1:06:21] and the doctor said say
[1:06:23] you have this problem in you
[1:06:25] i don't want to mention that name
[1:06:28] because if i mention that demon that
[1:06:31] demon be happy
[1:06:34] i look at the
[1:06:36] i look at the doctor a young doctor
[1:06:39] i say look at a small mouth that is
[1:06:41] telling me that i have that disease in
[1:06:42] me i said that in my mind
[1:06:46] don't use that your small mouth to tell
[1:06:48] me that
[1:06:50] and then i left them and i went to my
[1:06:52] regular hospital i normally go
[1:06:55] and there was this doctor also who have
[1:06:56] attended to me before
[1:06:58] they did the same test
[1:07:00] they said who said
[1:07:02] i think it is true
[1:07:04] i said i don't accept it
[1:07:07] they say who said you have to accept
[1:07:08] this that will start the medication
[1:07:11] i said boy
[1:07:12] i don't accept it
[1:07:14] your machines
[1:07:16] can tell you that i have that but i said
[1:07:19] i will not accept it until today i will
[1:07:22] not accept it
[1:07:25] oh hallelujah
[1:07:27] i want my words to create
[1:07:30] healing for me
[1:07:33] and by that brother i am strong
[1:07:39] like a gorilla
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] it's by your word
[1:07:48] now listen it says
[1:07:50] tell the devil
[1:07:52] you took my child
[1:07:54] you got him mixed up with the wrong boy
[1:07:57] you took my boy
[1:07:58] and mixed up with the wrong girl
[1:08:01] i am claiming them
[1:08:03] that is right i claim my children i
[1:08:07] claim my brother i claim my sister yes
[1:08:10] satan give them to me
[1:08:15] sometimes you are here in the church
[1:08:18] your parents don't want to serve the
[1:08:20] lord
[1:08:22] claim them from the devil
[1:08:24] that is what the prophet said he said
[1:08:26] you can claim them
[1:08:29] sometimes you the parent you are here in
[1:08:32] the church worshiping god but your
[1:08:34] children don't want to surrender
[1:08:37] claim them you have the power to tell
[1:08:39] the devil give my children to me
[1:08:44] hallelujah
[1:08:45] give my children to me
[1:08:48] have you forgotten about the testimony
[1:08:49] of sister haiti
[1:08:51] when one time the prophet went to the
[1:08:53] house
[1:08:54] and the prophet said that sister had
[1:08:57] tell me everything that you want
[1:09:01] right now
[1:09:03] if the lord don't give it to you
[1:09:04] don't believe me as his servant
[1:09:08] and the prophet was going up and down
[1:09:11] going up and down waiting to hear what
[1:09:13] sister had to demand
[1:09:16] and then
[1:09:17] sister hurt he became so confused
[1:09:20] he didn't know what to ask
[1:09:21] he said
[1:09:23] if you ask for one million dollars it
[1:09:25] will come on your life because the woman
[1:09:27] was poor
[1:09:29] but look what happened
[1:09:32] there was a sister of society
[1:09:35] in the church all the years
[1:09:39] sister heidi didn't think about her
[1:09:42] but the two sons
[1:09:44] who were making mercury
[1:09:46] of what was going on
[1:09:48] they didn't
[1:09:49] have jesus in their life they were
[1:09:51] making mercury when the prophet was
[1:09:53] going up and down and his statement to
[1:09:54] their mother and they were laughing
[1:09:56] laughing laughing laughing then sister
[1:09:58] hearty eyes caught on them
[1:10:01] he said say
[1:10:03] i asked for salvation for my two sons
[1:10:06] and the prophet said have it
[1:10:09] immediately
[1:10:11] these children rushed and nailed
[1:10:13] and they were crying
[1:10:15] calling jesus christ to come to their
[1:10:18] lives
[1:10:19] a word
[1:10:21] a word created salvation for her own
[1:10:25] sons
[1:10:26] he said claim them from the hands of the
[1:10:29] devil
[1:10:30] you have that power in you brother
[1:10:32] sister tonight
[1:10:34] you have that power
[1:10:36] what about this admirer
[1:10:39] when the son took bad company
[1:10:43] and have drunk
[1:10:44] have snuff cocaine and all those ditty
[1:10:48] elements
[1:10:50] and all his organs
[1:10:52] destroyed
[1:10:54] and he fell into you know the doctor
[1:10:56] said no there is no hope for your son
[1:10:59] take him home and he is going to die
[1:11:02] and this one brought the son home
[1:11:05] and the son was groaning in pain
[1:11:08] but the woman didn't sleep
[1:11:11] he prayed a prayer
[1:11:14] by her weight yes he said god
[1:11:18] send me
[1:11:19] your elijah to my home
[1:11:24] send me the elijah
[1:11:27] and when he played that player around 2
[1:11:29] 30 am
[1:11:31] he left the sun
[1:11:33] in the room
[1:11:34] and came out
[1:11:35] and stood on her fence
[1:11:38] from that time
[1:11:41] such a prayer
[1:11:44] you may think it was ordinary
[1:11:46] but it was full of god's word
[1:11:51] immediately
[1:11:53] the prophet was flying
[1:11:56] over memphis
[1:11:58] and can we imagine that the prayer of
[1:12:01] this woman made the airplane to develop
[1:12:04] fault
[1:12:06] and the plane has to land by force
[1:12:09] for technical reasons
[1:12:12] but it wasn't anything it was the prayer
[1:12:14] of that woman
[1:12:17] the prophet said that then he got up
[1:12:19] from
[1:12:20] because they gave them to you know relax
[1:12:22] because they were going to see their
[1:12:24] fault and he said he had some letters to
[1:12:26] post so he wanted to go to the person to
[1:12:28] go and post then immediately
[1:12:30] a voice came around he said don't go
[1:12:33] that way go this
[1:12:34] way and then he started going
[1:12:37] he started going he got he went continue
[1:12:40] to go
[1:12:42] the voice said go go ahead
[1:12:45] he said god what do you want me to come
[1:12:46] and do here
[1:12:48] he said go i said go
[1:12:52] he continued
[1:12:54] then all of a sudden he came to me this
[1:12:56] woman
[1:12:57] the woman
[1:12:59] put her hand on the fence like this
[1:13:02] right from 2 30 a.m to about seven
[1:13:04] o'clock in the morning
[1:13:06] the moment you saw the prophet
[1:13:09] he said
[1:13:10] person
[1:13:12] are you the elijah
[1:13:15] and the prophet said how did you get to
[1:13:17] know that i'm a person because in those
[1:13:19] days they said the black women the black
[1:13:21] people they call a preacher's person
[1:13:24] how do you get to know that i'm a person
[1:13:28] she said
[1:13:30] do you know the woman in the bible
[1:13:33] whose son died
[1:13:35] and the prophet elijah came
[1:13:37] and brought him back to life he said yes
[1:13:39] i know that
[1:13:40] he said i am that woman
[1:13:45] what then the prophet remove his heart
[1:13:48] he said what about that
[1:13:50] he said i have a son only son
[1:13:54] and he took bad company
[1:13:56] and found himself in drugs
[1:13:59] now he is dying
[1:14:01] the doctors have rejected him
[1:14:04] that there is no hope
[1:14:05] and i prayed to the lord and i asked god
[1:14:09] to bring me the elijah
[1:14:12] to my
[1:14:12] home and the prophet said wow
[1:14:16] then the prophet understood
[1:14:18] why they claimed how to land
[1:14:22] he said where is the boy where is your
[1:14:24] son he say in the room
[1:14:26] and the prophet entered into the room
[1:14:29] in fact he said the woman was a poor
[1:14:31] woman
[1:14:32] but there was one inscription he saw
[1:14:35] that he was very happy about that say
[1:14:38] god bless our home
[1:14:41] and this boy was groaning
[1:14:46] because he was dying
[1:14:49] and the prophet said well woman let's
[1:14:51] pray together
[1:14:53] and you all laid your hands upon this
[1:14:54] young man and they prayed and he said
[1:14:56] the power
[1:14:58] of the prayer of the woman
[1:15:00] the prophet even was silent that's right
[1:15:03] now then he said well lord
[1:15:06] if this is the reason why you brought me
[1:15:07] he
[1:15:09] then your word is fulfilled
[1:15:12] immediately
[1:15:13] the boy jumped
[1:15:15] he said mama
[1:15:17] i can see light
[1:15:18] mama i can see light
[1:15:21] mama i can see life
[1:15:23] you know why because where he got to
[1:15:26] was darkness
[1:15:27] he got into the region of the lost and
[1:15:30] there there's no light there
[1:15:32] so but god brought him back
[1:15:34] to the light
[1:15:35] and this boy was healed in fact when
[1:15:39] he embraced the mother then the prophet
[1:15:41] went away
[1:15:43] straight to the airport when he got to
[1:15:45] the airport the plane was ready
[1:15:47] waiting for him alone
[1:15:50] and he boarded it and then they flew
[1:15:52] can we imagine that the faith of a woman
[1:15:56] he spoke the word and because of her
[1:15:58] faith god made the aeroplane to develop
[1:16:01] forth immediately
[1:16:03] oh brother sister we are not different
[1:16:05] from that woman
[1:16:08] your faith can create something for you
[1:16:11] and that's what god said we should do
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:17] he said
[1:16:18] and as long as you i'm closing okay i'm
[1:16:20] sorry about that and as long as you are
[1:16:23] in the line of duty
[1:16:25] keeping god's word
[1:16:27] doing just what he told you to do
[1:16:30] matching by the orders of god you've got
[1:16:33] a right to say to the mountain removed
[1:16:37] and they have to obey you
[1:16:40] hallelujah god keep his word
[1:16:43] if you said to this mountain be moved
[1:16:45] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:16:47] that that what you said will come to
[1:16:49] pass you can have that what you have
[1:16:51] said
[1:16:53] amen amen
[1:16:54] amen and amen
[1:16:56] yes sir
