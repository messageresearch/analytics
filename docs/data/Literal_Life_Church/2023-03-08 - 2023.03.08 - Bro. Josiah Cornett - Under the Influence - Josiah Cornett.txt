TRANSCRIPT
========================================
go straight to the word this evening so we don't take too much of your time but we want to make the most the time that we have with you if we could well let's go ahead and open with the word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord as we just turn the order of this service now Lord the musicians have been faithful Lord not just faithful in their playing but they've been faithful and they're consecrating their gift and practicing Lord and laying before you to choose the right songs for the service Lord and Lord I've been faithful as I know how to lay before you and bring your word to your people Lord and now It All Leads up to this moment Lord we just turn it over to you father and ask that you would Lord bring your word your seed your bride Lord and plan it in a way that would bring life and fruitfulness to each Heart Lord as we turn the pages of this precious Bible I pray that you would lift the words and the Heart behind those words off from the pages Lord and into our hearts we pray and Jesus Christ's name will give you sovereignty in the service amen amen if you would turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 6 and 12. pulled just from from there and also Ephesians 5 and 18 will be pulling from both uh both texts this morning when you get the first text go ahead and give me a resounding round of Amen so I know that you're with me this evening and all right well we've got some fast Turners here beat me to it that's First Corinthians and then over here in Ephesians all right 6 and 12 and the Apostle Paul writing to the Ephesians making an argument to them in in light of fornication in in different things that they're dealing with he says well all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient and all things are lawful to me but I will not be brought under the power of any and Ephesians 5 and verse 18. and it says hear and be not drunk with wine whereas in wherein is excess but be filled with a spirit may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated this evening by God's grace I'd uh as you're seated this evening I'd like to title this sermon under the influence under the influence and uh we read the scripture here to be not drunk with wine whereas in his success which doesn't mean don't drink too much wine what it really means in is don't drink wine where wherein is excess wherein is if you open up that word it and extrapolate it means whereas riotousness and and lasciviousness and unclean living all that lies inside of there so don't be drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit so there's something about this wine that that it has the power to bring us under its influence that when you when you drink from this wine it it it it it it it it causes you to do something that you otherwise wouldn't do and we're just going to get this we're just going to get this out of the way this right away this evening so there's just some there's an influence behind this wine where when we drink from it it begins to alter our course of actions and alter our course of decision making so that we make other decisions that we otherwise would not have done so with with that I I think about how we how we got to that point how we how we got to that point with wine and all wine is is it starts out on the Shelf as some innocent bottle of grape juice and you just set it on the shelf and all by itself there's there's no problem without grape juice matter of fact you can drink as much of that grape juice as you want to and all the all it'll make you do is go to the bathroom a little bit more often it has no power to influence your behavior it might influence your gut if you drink a lot of it with all that sugar and all the unnecessary calories but that's all it's going to do it's not going to alter the course of your life but there's something about that grape juice innocent though it may seem that if you lay it on the shelf and under the right atmosphere under the right conditions under a covid-19 condition where you have too much time on your hand under under a condition where there's no accountability in your life under some kind of set of conditions that grape juice can lay lay there and through the process of time there begins to develop an influence behind it because it's not the grape juice but it's that alcohol that that influence that develops behind it so I think that like wine there are many things in our lives which seek to gain influence and power over of us things that start out seemingly innocent but with the right condition and through the process of time those things have their way in our lives and I I looked uh you look begin to look at some modern examples you can just look no further than our current culture and how do we get here and the advertisement that we have and what they want us to look at as being normal and and you look at you think about what normal is and what your sense of normal comes from your sense of normal comes from nothing else than what you bring yourself under as an influence they call it when you go from uh when you pick up a plane from here in America and you fly to to Africa where brother Tony is you're going to experience something they call culture shock especially if you've never been outside of Toledo poor you and and you think the whole world acts the same way that Toledo is and this is your normal and you have no basis of any other kind of normal if you get on a plane and ride home with brother Tony tonight and fly down into his his home country you will have a culture shock you'll be like what do you mean they do things this way and what do you mean they do things this way and what do you mean they think that's normal and you might even get a little bit judgmental because the way they do things is different than the way you do things but this world has a way of normalizing what God calls abnormal and if we're not if we're if we lay our lives underneath of its influence then it's going to become normal to us to see a woman and a man kissing on a screen somewhere it's going to become normal to us to see a man holding a woman in an Embrace where if we brought them into our home we'd kick them out but we'll let them do that on a screen in front of us because that's normal and and be careful because the whole culture what what how culture starts out as they start out by rationalizing it and they'll they'll start out by rationalizing it saying well that's not so bad and and and and that's the same way they've done with this homosexual agenda they start out by saying well you know animals kind of have some of that characteristic too well first of all I'm not an animal I'm not confused I'm I'm not I'm not confused about the I don't I don't have hormones that I can't keep in check I I'm not a confused being I've I've been given sovereignty over my vessel by the Holy Ghost I I I can have discernment I'm not an animal oh I'm so glad I I don't fall for that that conception that I evolved some from some ape somewhere I don't evolve from an ape I I evolve from from the son of Adam who is the Son of God and that's my Heritage that's my Evolution that's my that's my train that's where I come from but they'll rationalize it and they'll say well it's this and that and then they're saying you've got to accept that because some people are just that way and that's just the way it is all this rationalization and and then and then once you build it up to being accepted well now we've gotta we've come to the point where it's become normalized it's not just there's a small contingent of people way out here on the friends take any ideology you want to not just homosexuality not just transgenderism but take any ideology away from God and you see that follows the same pathway rationalize and then and then accept and then it becomes normal and then it's not enough to leave it being normalized if you're not careful you're going to find yourself wrapped up in a culture that wants to celebrate these things and then for go it goes from being celebrated to being pervasive and you don't want to be living in a culture where you're tied into that you're being just swept away and your idea of what normal is is being defined by the influences that surround you that's why we have to make sure that we're we're not forsaking from ourselves the the assembling together of the Saints as the time draws near like the scripture says it's not just coming to church twice a week like we were fellowshipping there with brother Jared in the back it's not just it's not just it's not just checking a box and getting enough time into to hear a sermon here and there who are you fellowshipping with who who do you hold discourse with who who is defining your normal who who surrounds your family do you live in an echo chamber or are you filling your family with the word of God I I think about this this culture and how it it tries it seeks to influence us and you know it's it's no longer a wolf in sheep's clothing anymore they they come out and they say it straight up and they'll say my job is to influence you how many have heard about online influencers amen all the young people know what I'm talking who am I talking everybody knows what an online influencer can you imagine just being so bold is to say I'm an influencer like who are you who may who made you so important that you get to influence my life and yet we'll still click on that and we'll watch their their their video about how we ought to live our life and they may not you just say the 10 points of how you ought to live your life because first of all that would be boring content but they've got a message it's grape juice but it's been sitting on the shelf long enough that there's an influence developing behind it now you look at the they'll they'll they're they're the you you go on YouTube and you find all kinds of influencers you find parent influencers and family influencers and oh you've got you you've got the you've got the the you've got the the family that'll get on there with their RV and they'll jump in their RV and they'll go on the road and they hit the road for a whole year and and every video that you see is just a bunch of smiles and and you know that it's not you know it's not legit there's some there's something inside of us rational logical thinking person that says this is a farce but yeah we get entertainment from it and yet if you entertain yourself off that you know what you're going to find yourself doing after a while you pull out your phone be like I wonder how much an RV costs kind of fun you'd know they're they're just pulling the wool over your eyes but yet there's something that's subversive enough you're drinking that wine it tastes good but there's an influence behind it there's an alcohol that's coming down that's changing your course of decision making and before you know it your thumbs are starting to reflect what's in your heart because something's gotten there and you haven't stopped to ask yourself what is it about this family that would just jump in an RV and and leave behind their family leave behind their grandparents and and their kids grandparents and leave behind a church community and just hit the road for a year we've just entertained ourselves with their lifestyle not thinking that maybe this person hasn't it's not the kind of person I I want to pattern my life after there's a family out there called the I'm just going to call a couple a name or two here uh The Bucket List family you know it's so fun to watch The Bucket List family because their whole their whole mantra's life is let's do everything fun before we kick the bucket now we'll uh we'll we'll pick that apart in just a minute here but just imagine you're you're you're watching them and they're they're going out to Timbuktu and they're going out to Costa Rica and they're they're diving in the ocean they're seeing these beautiful fish and they've got all I don't know where they get the money but apparently being an influencer pays well and they're going from from hopscotching from one place over the world to another and you're like wow I'd I'd like to travel the world like that with my family I wonder how much a ticket costs and wow that ticket cost a whole lot of money now what could we do to to just get a little piece of their life I don't want to live their whole life I just want a little piece of it I just I just want to go to Africa with brother Tony and that would that would really be the bomb going to Africa with brother Tony would be the bomb but if you're going there just because you're patterning your life after some influence you've seen that life is all about trying to fill up your bucket before you kick it you know I've I've got one thing on my bucket list and I guarantee you this family doesn't have it they're the one thing that's on my bucket list is I want to walk into those Gates of Glory holding the hands of my family with no man left behind and saying family we made it we made it we had to shun the world we had to shun the evil we had to turn off the television we had to find we had to look like oddballs to the world but we're here we're passing through the through the we're leaving time behind us and we're entering into eternity that's what's on my bucket list but you look at these families and and they look happy and their smiles all around but what it projects is it projects a lie because it projects a life happy but devoid of God and I've got news for you they're not showing it and I don't know where it is but if they're not if there's not a problem now there's a there will be a problem because you cannot have happiness you cannot have Pope you cannot have the fruit of the spirit you cannot have peace Joy love you cannot have contentment without the Holy Ghost without Jesus Christ do you know how I know that young person do you know how I can say that so confidently that no matter what you look for if you don't get Jesus first you will not be happy I don't say that as some some Mantra from the Bible I say it because I know that God created you and if God created you he created you in a specific way for a specific purpose and that purpose was to be in relationship with him and so if you're not fulfilling the relationship of your creator then you're looking you're like a door looking for a key and only he holds it and anything that's being projected online outside of that is nothing but a lie you wonder why this world is so bogged down with anxiety and so bogged down with with with an appetite for more it's because they've been lied to and they've bought it hook line sinker they've been lied to not just by the parent influencers but they've maybe you you get there on Tick Tock and Tick Tock has all these all these new dance moves or they've got the new they've got the new uh fashion that you want to get in your life and they got the new sneakers and that would be just a thing if I could just if I could just have that or if I could just you get on YouTube and it says that all the health professionals and they're going to tell you how to how to build muscle mass or reduce body fat amount and that's fine Paul said that not this Paul the Paul in the Bible Paul said that bodily exercise profiteth a little that's all right but it's just a little and those people are conveying a completely different influence they're conveying that it's a lot you say well brother Josiah that's that's all right I but I I just I just like to hear what other people have to say because I I just like to know how other people are living their life and maybe I can pick up a little bit of something out of their life and and and redeem it for the good you know if that's your approach to online influencers if that's your approach to the council that that is out there in the world I'm going to let you know right now your thinking man's filter is going to get clogged awful fast because the thinking man's filter is not a wide pore filter it's not a it's it's not a big mesh on that filter it's a fine mesh it says narrow it straight is the way and narrow is the gate that leadeth to repentance into the eternal life it's going to be a narrow fine filter go find a good source of counsel Saul of a sudden in the first in the first chapter of Psalms it says that blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly no you you read further down that scripture it has a lot to say about the mockers and the scorners and and all those but the ungodly that's just the first stage that's that's not he's not saying the ma the scorner he's not saying all these these deleterious people he's just saying the ungodly what's that that's just the people without God in the presence of many counselors there's safety yes but the Bible says also that the count of the king who surrounds himself by evil counsel that King will fall so it's not just in the Council of many in the presence of many counselors their safety but who are you surrounding yourself by what counsel are you inundating your life with and if you don't think that listening to YouTube after YouTube and watching Tick Tock after tick tock counts as being in the counsel of the ungodly I have news for you Council just simply means to give advice and whether you like it or not they they're calling themselves influencers for a reason they're trying to influence you and they're not just trying to influence you for their product there's a power behind that a demonic power that's trying to influence you away from your God but the Bible says that wine is a mocker you know what else is a mocker social media is a mocker you know what I I I I get on Facebook and I load up Facebook and it seems like it it just wants to mock the Simplicity of a Godly life it's just I I can't just enjoy my blessings I have to look at what everybody else is bragging about their blessings on and and look at their their highlight reels of their life and yeah I just came back from a month-long vacation and I I think the good Lord for it and that was a special privilege to be able to take that but before I know it someone else is traveling to Florida and I I it seems like wow and they're going to Disneyland and my family ought to be going to Disneyland and I've never been able to take my kids to Disneyland and and all these things come as fruit of social media because it wants to to mock your life wants to mock the simplicity that is in Christ you know the Bible says that godliness with contentment is great gain and there's something about social media that just steals away your contentment they tapped us into some kind of psychology when they got with that endless scroll and there's something about the human psychology that it wants to have a finish to something but when the when the social the social scientists there at Facebook or wherever it was found that endless girl they they found a human trigger that now you scrolling and before you know it you look at your clock and say my goodness it's time for bedtime already where has the time gone and that whole time what have you been it is it's not just what could I have been doing with all that time and and we we will feel badly about that by itself that we've been wasteful of our resource of time but ask yourself what have I done with that time Christ says it this way he says the light of the body is the eye therefore when thy eye is single thy whole body is also full of light but when thy eye is evil thy body is full of Darkness what is it that you're bringing Through Your Eyes what is it that as you go through that endless scroll on whatever social media platform that you enjoy or what is coming through your eyes what is becoming normalized you turn your head and say oh I wish I hadn't seen that but then you go right back and you keep on scrolling friends I'm not here to condemn I'm saying I'm I can speak with knowledge about this because your struggles and the struggles of this laodicean age in America are my struggles but we've got to find a way to beat it and it's not becoming Amish because that's not our calling we are called to be a bride that lives above the laodicean that is called up into a bride age with the Lord Jesus Christ by a potent powerful message of the hour it's not the Amish as much as I as much as I'd love to be like the Amish and just turn my back on it all I'm not called to turn my back at all I'm called to overcome it all I'm called to be in the world but that not of the world I'm called to be able to show to to this to Satan that that this Eve is not like the first Eve that that she can listen to The Whispers of a serpent and still stay true to her Adam this is our our calling but yet Satan wants to twist your frame and your character into a black hole I say that not to be dramatic but because that's exactly what it is a black hole of envy and covetousness that can never be filled Envy is what is that is it's lusting after that what your friend has what is covetousness it's an ungodly greedy appetite for something more and you didn't start out that way but you got on your phone and you found out that the more you saw the more you want and the world has this this offering to your life and it says well just get this and you look at Pinterest in that fact just do this little DIY project like everybody else is doing and make my home just like this that'll be it and I can rest sit down and I can say I have Pinterest worthy home never mind that in that whole process you never invited a saint over to your home you never broke bread with us saying she never had fellowship with those things but you have a Pinterest worthy home that's modeled after some woman some man that you don't even know and they're they're calling themselves an influencer but what are they influencing you on too don't let this world twist the character of your frame into a black hole but we're called to be filled with a spirit not to be made of black holes of envying with screen time reports that turn our hedge and shame at the end of the week knowing that we've proselyted our time out to the world and not redeemed it for the Lord the Bible says this God gave them over to reprobate mind being filled this is what Satan wants to fill you with with all unrighteousness and fornication oh I don't do that but what do you what what is the movies that we're watching what are we what's coming into our eyes what's what's the if the light of the eyes is your if the light of the body is the eyes then then what are you filling yourself with filled with fornication and wickedness and covetousness malishness maliciousness full of Envy murder I I don't I don't I don't have anything like that in my life well how about all those docu-series that you watch and the true crime and is that something that would be beneficial to a Christian you know the Bible says that there's there's certain things that are not even convenient that are shameful that are done in secret that aren't are would be shameful for even to talk about and this world wants to make a whole docu-series about it and say hey why don't you educate yourself about all the things you're missing out on and at the end you know what Christian you can glorify God that you're not a part of all that no turn yourself away put that thing away from you backbiters and haters of God despiteful proud boasters and vendors of evil things and disobedient to parents but their end was to be turned over to unnatural affections and that's the way this world has gone but I hope better things for us I believe there's been a more sure word of Prophecy over this group of people that that it will not be our end that we will not succumb to this world that our character will not be eroded over the over the years week by week hour by hour giving our time up to something that's not of God but that will not be our end but God wants to change this from Glory unto Glory oh my there there we could preach a sermon it's not it's it's not it's not screen time but it's face time not face time with our phones but face time with Jesus Christ getting into his face and looking into this this word and being changed the Bible says to look unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith and looking unto him were were changed from Glory unto Glory not from not from covetousness unto covetousness not from oh here's the next thing and once you get there you've got the next thing and once you get there you've got the next thing and you look behind and you're like what have I been doing with my life I've been filling it with all these things the things that are no longer fashionable no longer desirable no longer no longer admirable by even the world and my life is filled with it I can tell you about all these video episodes and I can tell you about all the things that Hollywood came out of but can you tell me about the word of God and what God's doing in your life and what God's doing in your family life not not 10 years ago but what he's done last week and what he's done this morning and what he's doing right now and what he what do you feel he might be doing in your life is as far as the next step in the next Direction because there's something about a relationship with Jesus Christ when he calls you to a Next Step it's not a carrot in front of a donkey it's a it's a promise and it's part of the daughter and son of God he says here's your promise I've set before you this day choose whom ye will serve and when you choose me I offered you not a carrot but I offer you eternal life so much so that the God of all Heaven swore by himself and said I will not repent of my promises my promises are sure and they're true not the carrots of the world but you find out that as you go down this journey with God long enough you start looking back and you can say like that old little Southern black woman I think it was she said I sure is not what I want to be it is not what I ought to be but I can look back over the course of time and I can tell you I sure am not what I used to be God had brought her to enough next things that she could look back and say I'm so glad I came from all of that I've made progress my life is built up not upon sinking sand but it's built up upon the rock of Jesus Christ and brothers sisters parents we have a responsibility not just that we could say that of ourselves but if we lead our family correctly in this laodicean hour we can say that of our family we aren't where we want to be we aren't where we ought to be I can say that tonight I'm not where I want to be with my screen time with my family I'm not where I ought to be thank God I'm not where I used to be and I'm not talking about screen time I'm talking about now I'm talking about we're not where we used to be where we were just little parents that were holding a little baby in our arms and didn't know what to do with it I'm glad I'm not there anymore but I can I can say I I've prayed the sinner's prayer with my little three-year-old son when it was three I I saw his heart begin to open up as I talked to him about the Lord just the other day we were we we chose to we're trying to make the right decisions with our entertainment and when showing a movie to my little boy we chose a little a little bible cartoon and they introduced the story of of Zacchaeus and I'm like he's not catching any of this I asked him a couple questions afterwards and didn't have a clue but he came to my wife just today she said and she said he recited the whole story of Zacchaeus come in its entirety to me they're catching more than what we're realizing and I'm so glad that I can say my family's my family's not where it used to be but but we're making progress and I so appreciate what our Pastor said on Sunday that if we keep our minds towards the Eternal and not the temporal that will guide our decisions for our family that'll guide the cartoons that our children watch and not just making a pure entertainment but what what can I endow to my children what heritage can I give my children today how can I get across this huge gift that God's given me I can't give it one big block but it's like I've got to give it to them in little pieces of bread I've got to find ways to break it down on a daily basis but wine is a mocker it'll mock your Ambitions in life it'll mock your holy ambition you know what else is a mocker HDTV HGTV is a mocker I'm gonna there's this confession time right now a little while back I got the discovery Discovery um channel for my son and we wanted to watch some documentaries with each other they've got some good documentaries on there and sat down and on the one side is you know documentaries about God's creation and things and you can watch that and that's it's fun on the other side there's all these reality TV shows and and then there's HGTV I've always had kind of a hankering for real estate and I thought I'd watch a couple episodes and I didn't much care for the Joanna Gaines you know all the flippers but I I really like that that format where they come in and they buy a house brother Henry and first of all they sit down with a realtor and they said well this is how much we this how much we have to spend and if they say you know fifty thousand dollars or 150 000 you just turn the next Channel I don't I don't want to watch somebody that has my budget right I want to watch somebody that makes like 10 or 20 times more than I do so they they sit down they're like we have this budget a few million dollars I'm like all right now this is this is what it looks like to be riding High and then they'll go out and they'll go and they'll go through three different they'll go three through three different houses and they'll pick the house whether you like it or not they'll pick that one and they have all different iterations of this they have Montana they have Mountain life and they have log cabins and whatever you like oh I happened I happened to like log cabin so I started watching all these log cabins and you know some people get involved in football I was getting involved in this I just about they picked the wrong cab and I just wanted about wanted to take my shoe and throw it at the screen like are you kidding me why would you pick that cabin oh you pick a a 5 000 square foot cabin on one acre of land what are you thinking go for the place with 20 acres with 1500 square foot who cares so I thought this was all good entertainment right a few days later I'm watching my thumb you know sometimes your thumb tells you where your heart's at especially when it's connected to your phone I see myself click on the Zillow app and load up and kind of wonder what kind of cabins are in my area happens in Toledo there's no mountains either why do I live here and all that godliness with contentment that God's been giving me as his great gain is turned to seep right out of the windows of my heart and I had to stop myself and say what am I doing because I'm sitting in a house that's I'm literally sitting within God's testimony for me I I just bought this house a year and a half ago what am I doing not only that but it's not just a Time duration but I've got to testimony that comes from this house and I've gotta I've got I've got a Heritage in this area and I've got a People of God that I that I fellowship with and I've got family that serves the Lord in this area and I've got so many roots I'm not talking about Roots like the world gives you roots and what they talk about but I've got spiritual roots that go down into into the terror firm of God's experience for my life and draws from the water table of God's word and his spirit and I can say I I have something way more than anybody on HGTV has and I had to I had to give myself a heart check because what was it doing HGTV was coming into my life brother Henry and it was mocking God's testimony it was mocking God's goodness to me sister Esther it was saying you don't have a good house and you don't live in a good area and you don't have nothing but when I started to think about it I do have it I have more than they have and one day I'm going to a place that's that's that I'm going to Mount Zion one day I have all the mountains I want I don't have to spend my whole life aspiring to find some Mountain out in the Colorado Rockies with my log cabin I've already got that box checked from the foundational world God's Got a Mansion prepared for me in glory and I've got a whole lot more worth living for right here on Earth but this is just an Evidence of what Christ said when he says but they that be rich will fall in Temptation and the snare and many hurtful and fullest losts which drowned man in destruction and perdition say well brother Josiah that scripture is not talking about me I'm I'm not rich you didn't see my tax return this year you know if your tax return kind of blow your mind a little bit for a second do you know what the median global household income is after adjusting for local cost of living would you believe it's about ten thousand dollars per year that means the average person that reads their Bible lives on about ten thousand dollars per year and somehow they figure out how to get by and if you had to you would too because there's people in America that live that look on that on that pay scale you might live in a hut you might live in a grass shelter down in Florida but you would you would find a way just like the average person in the world that reads the Bible so if you make any substantial amount more than ten thousand dollars on your tax return this year if you forgot how much you made you can go back and check out your tax return I just did mine today it's not ten thousand I thank God but it does put me in this bucket it also puts me in the bucket where Christ said that it's harder for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle which was a tricky gate going to Jerusalem then it's I'm sorry it's harder for a rich man to go into the Kingdom of Heaven than for that Camel to go through the eye of the needle that's you friends that's laodicea that's our challenge so we have to be careful that we're not falling at those foolish and hurtful losts you know what one of the the most obvious indicators of wealth is it's not so much as how much is in your bank account or what your discretionary income is but really wealth is what your discretionary time is if you have enough time that you don't have to keep on working to get food in your mouth you're wealthy now the question is what are you doing with all that discretionary time I'll just leave that one there but wine is a mocker you know what else is a mocker there's going to be some stepping on toes tonight is that all right do we still have time to step on a few more toes it happens to you be your toes do we still have time Hollywood is a mocker Hollywood makes a mockery of holiness Hollywood makes a mockery of your home's values when you bring that accursed thing into your home it's making a mockery in front of your children in front of your wife of the values that you profess to believe and you say well brother Josiah I don't bring the accursed thing you don't you don't understand we only bring Pidgey into our home or we only whatever your criteria right I'm asking you to look at it again tonight I'm not asking you to throw it out that's between you and the Lord and I don't know where my family is going with this but I know that where we're at right now is not where we're going to stay Hollywood celebrates adultery you can't get away from it and you may not have a a a movie that's rated that way and you say well we don't we don't watch that kind of stuff but Hollywood celebrates adultery brother said when when when when you kiss a a a woman that's not your wife and you're even if you're not married yet you're kissing another man's wife and Hollywood has that plastered over their screens Hollywood celebrates fornication you say well I don't have anything like that in my home but Christ said that for for a man to look upon a woman and lust after her and his heart he's committed adultery with her they're right there in his heart you say well brother Josiah the sons of God turn their heads what are you talking about I I know that that stuff sometimes slips across brother but I just turn my head no sons of God turn their heads when it happens on the street but when you've chosen to bring it into your home that puts things in a different category and brother you can choose to Pivot your head but what about your 12 year old son that's sitting right beside you what about your little daughter that's there what about your what about your family that's going to one day rise up and say but the preacher preached this and we saw you do something contrary wise see Hollywood doesn't just want to make a mockery of your values but they want to make your children rise up and mock you proverbs 31 says that if Proverbs 31 Woman shall rise up they'll grow up they'll become mature and they'll look back and they'll call their mother blessed but Hollywood wants to take your children and when they get to D12 14 18 and 36 years old they want you to turn back and say and mock your parents because there was something in the home that engendered a disrespect some duplicity that was happening something that didn't line up between the things that you said were your values and the things that you chose to entertain your family with Hollywood celebrates corrupt communication what is corrupt communication the Bible says it this way in Ephesians 4 29 let therefore no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may be Minister Graves unto the hearers oh I would that we would choose things that ministered Grace to us when we hear it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed into the day of redemption and let all bitterness and wrath and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you that that pertains to swear words sure that's that's that's the Baseline condition right but what what what are those people projecting is there Strife involved is there is there clamor is there bitterness is there is there frustration let me put it this way for people that occupy the main characters and the movies that your family watch are they people that you would want your children to be around oh there's a high standard but those are the people that's influencing you and in our digital age they're influencing you more than your friends are influencing you because you know what you see them more often you spend more time with the movie stars on the screen and and the influencers on YouTube than you even spend with your friends and church family if you're not careful but I think we need to reset if we find ourselves in this condition Hollywood celebrates celebrates murder celebrates True Crime like there's docusaries they're coming out with and I don't even want to say the name of it almost but Donner or Dahmer or whatever it is and and people will flock to those things because they they're intrigued by it it's so different it's it's tantalizing don't make that your your kind of environment friends be careful about what you watch the Galatians 5 19 says it this way now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery and fornication and uncleanness and lasciviousness and idolatry Witchcraft and wizards oh I put that in there but witchcraft these are the works of the flesh variants and emulations Strife which happens to mean electioneering and partisanship try listening to only Fox News for a week and you'll find out that the Republican spirit is not a spirit of Christ news flash if you didn't know seditions and heresies and things murderers drunkenness and revelings and they do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God I believe better things of us but at the same time I don't want to be surrounding myself with people that are not going to be inheriting the kingdom of God I want to be surrounding myself with you people I want to be surrounding myself with people that one day I'm going to enter into eternity with and and enjoying your presence and not the presence of of some ungodly counsel coming into my room Hollywood presents ideologies that are completely devoid of God you might think it's just an entertaining children's show but it's if if I can say it this way when that producer comes to mind with his script and his his production he's creating his world and he's welcoming you into it so be careful who's behind that Hollywood production because you're spending a little bit of time inside of his mind inside of her mind or inside of their mind or its mind or whatever kind of mind mixed up mind it is and when we get uh where we're watching these things that are it's just from the thrill it's just for the entertainment it's just because it's it's exciting the senses be careful what it is that's exciting your senses because remember where your senses come from your senses come from a serpent this this body this the sensations of this body are sin born and maybe if The Thrillers and and the the demonic things that are going on and and and you you might say well it's not demonic but just give it the word test a little bit is it appealing to these senses or is it appealing to to the spirit that's within you do you do you leave that do you leave that Hollywood session that Cinema session say I feel so edified I feel so lifted up I feel so encouraged or to say wow that was really thrilling that was really something wasn't it didn't you like the effects didn't you like this wasn't that little Hub wasn't that monster something else wow that was something what's that did you know there's going to be a whole group of people that are turned so insane until they see locusts with hair like woman is what Revelations tells us and brother Branham says that those things are preparing their mind for the blast don't let yourself be wrapped into all that you're not meant for the blast friends you're not meant for all that you're called to a resurrection power you're called to come into the holy city where's Treacher of gold and it's Purity and light all the time but yet we come out of these Hollywood experiences and it's been dark and now our eyes are dark because we've been feeding this sin-borne vessel and say wow it was just entertainment I'm here to challenge you in the name of the Lord if you fall into this camp you're being rebuked tonight In The Name Of The Lord but it's not a rebuke of a man because I wouldn't do that to you but when God comes to you and God convicts your heart he says those who are those who I love I rebuke and I cherish it's not an indictment tonight but it's God's loving hand saying no this is the way over here walking in it turn away from all of that turn away from from a Hollywood that wants to mock the Holiness and mock everything that's about God but wine is a mocker a strong drink is Raging and the Bible says that whoever is deceived thereby is not wise and so there's a deception that lies behind any form of influence it's first recognizing what those form of influences are in our lives and in this digital culture a lot of it comes from these screens and I'll tell you this these screens right here these are the new door to Sodom you know you look a lot he was he was barring the door of his household down there in Sodom so those sodomites couldn't get through the door no one's knocking on your door today they're too busy quarantining they don't want to see you anyhow your heart even you hardly ever get a door-to-door Salesman anymore even no one's knocking on your door but they're knocking on these doors and we have to be the man and the woman of God who stands at these doors and meets that knock meets that call this hour and say no Sodom will knock and I will answer I'll be the man of God that takes up that simple hiss of faith and says I don't know how to close this Pandora's box but by God I'm going to take this hiss up I'm going to dip it in the blood of the lamb and I'm going to say family we're going to apply the token to the doors of our home we're going to apply the token to your cell phones we're going to apply the token to the video monitor we're going to apply the token to the iPads and we're not going to let Sodom through these doors because behind there is an influence and it's not just those things I I recognize that some of us perhaps you you your thing is books but I want to encourage you that remember the grape juice on the Shelf just let it sit there long enough if you're not watching it if you get your eyes off the ball it can develop an influence behind it a little habit a little good book reading practice in life can still go sour so be careful who's writing the books that you read well cute example of this is I I was picking up some books some from the local library here and they had some book giveaways or a dollar book or something and I pulled a bunch down because I always tell myself I'm going to read all these books and I bring them all home like this and my sister Rebecca I'm holding them all like this and my wife's like you're not going to read all those I'm like but someday someday I'm going to read them and they're going to make me a better man because every one of them is a self-improvement book and I've got a lot of improvement from self-help books and I've needed a lot of help so I it's been good for me through the years but I opened up this one self-help book and it was about family and family life and I thought wow yeah I want to be a better Family Guy I want to be a better dad this will this will be good and I started to read the introduction because I wanted to know who the author was I wanted to know who this person was going to tell me how to be super dad and he writes all these thank yous the tributes to people and he says to to to Susie my my previous my my former wife um I kind of read it I'm like giving them benefit of doubt I thought maybe she's maybe she's buried maybe she's former that she's passed on and raised brother who never stops reaching out the hand of friendship towards me I'm like well that she's not buried This Woman This Woman they separated he's writing a whole book to tell me how to be a family man and he's a divorcee not not saying that there's not divorcee not not Grace for divorce his life not saying that that that the words of wisdom can come out of someone that has that in their past but here he is he's glorifying it he's saying she's still reaching out her hand and we're we're proud of this marital relationship or this former marital relationship well that book that book went right in the trash and um you know I you read certain marriage or a certain parenting advice and some of it goes more towards the side of psychology and I so appreciate it when I can find a parenting book that focuses on the word focuses on the nature that God's Building in the children be careful where you get advice is because it's not all created equal you know how about I'll just touch on this how about where you're getting your marriage relationship advice with brother Branham had something to say about that he says don't pay attention to the nonsense and these sexy books and the things that you read about and all this stuff and everything like that that was in 1965. don't pay attention to the nonsense and these sexy books and the things that you read about and all this stuff well all this stuff has become a whole lot more stuff since 1965. we're talking about there in the Thursday night meetings with the men all this stuff is becoming a problem for our generation and the accessibility of it it's no longer something you just pick up in the in the checkout line at the grocery store it's something that you have 24 7 access to and all this stuff wants to completely warp your image of what a marriage relationship could be like and I want to tell you this if you've ever come into contact with the influence of the world whether it's in this category or any category that wants to like like like like my experience with with watching HGTV they wanted to warp my mind and for a few days I believe that the ultimate the ultimate goal was that log cabin in the mountains but then God's grace came to me and he changed my perception the whole thing and now what I saw it for was no longer the beautiful great wonderful Log Cabin surrounded by the mountains and having that experience but it was God's token Fellowship that he's given me with my wife and my family inside of our home so if you've come across to influence the world in these things God's grace still extends it's like Isaiah he when he saw the Lord high and lifted up in his train filled the temple he said oh I'm a man of unclean lips born from among unclean people but what did God do he took the coal fire and set it to the prophet's list and said now you're anointed for service so what's the solution then the Bible says be not drunk with wine we're in a success but be filled with the spirit amen there's there's what we fill ourselves with not the not the endless screens the world not the not the shoes on macarian or Marketplace not the not the clothes at JCPenney not the not the new DIY projects or I could go on and on because it literally doesn't end but to be filled with the spirit that word filled means to abound to furnace to fill up to satisfy like we talked about you were created by God only he knows how to satisfy your heart he is the only key your your heart will ever find he is the only one who will unlock the doors of of goodness to you and give that fruit of the spirit which is love joy peace long-suffering patience goodness meekness and temperance so how do you get there well it's real simple just love God more how do you get more of the spirit you just love God more Christ said if you abide in me and I in you he says abide to me and you'll have the Fruit of the Spirit but how do you how do you really abide in God well I'm not going to turn this into another hour sermon because it's a lot more simple than that it's just loving Jesus Christ they say well how do I do that brother Josiah well God's blessed every one of us here with relationships that we can use for insight you've got your relationship with your best friend maybe as a young person or you've got your relationship with your spouse you know how to build relationships you know that if you call your friend more often on the telephone and communicate with them that relationship grows if you share your heart with your wife and don't hold back and and talk to her that relationship grows in fact the the writer here in in the scripture in Ephesians the very next verse he says be filled with the spirit in the very next verse he says speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual singing and making melody in your heart towards the Lord giving thanks for all things you know isn't that isn't that how it works with our relationships if I start thinking about my wife and thinking about her a little bit I I won't let you guys hear any of those songs but you know start thinking about her start kind of humming her Praises a little bit and you know telling you how wonderful she is and giving thanks a little bit it just doesn't build her up it builds her up inside of me it builds up that relationship and that's all he's saying here is hey don't be drunk with all these influences but be filled with the spirit and gender that relationship with Jesus Christ spend time with them and I I don't know how we we start doing it because it you know that if if you open the Pandora's box of electronic devices and if you open the if you've formed habits even even with book reading like we talked about there's a certain pathway that you just fall into maybe what you need is just a little bit of a fast a brain fast as it were and just set aside everything and say you know what I'm going to clean house but I'm not going to just stop there because I know the story of that man that swept his house and it went vacant and and seven demons worse than the first came back and I'm not going to just sweep my house but I'm Gonna Fill my house I'm not gonna just sweep my house of Hollywood and sweep my house of of social media but I'm Gonna Fill my house I'm Gonna Fill my house with singing and praises and I'm not going to just tell Alexa to do it for me I'm going to start doing it myself I'm going to start singing to the Lord myself I'm going to start singing his Praises myself oh Hallelujah there you bring the presence of God and he says oh now now I feel welcome in this place now this is a home I can step into and have fellowship with it's not just swept clean for me but it's furnished that's what that word filled with the spirit means to be furnished he says ma they've they've haven't just swept it clean but they've they've they've put out the chair for me and they've got the favorite blanket out and they've got a fire going and they they want to make my spirit comfortable that's a you ever you ever host somebody you ever just have somebody over you you don't you don't just have them over and when we turned off a TV for you that'd be a real good host you're laughing because you maybe you've had a horse like that I don't know but you just don't turn off a TV for them and consider that being a good host right you say well I know that they enjoy eating this and last time we had them over there they really commented on it so we're gonna we're gonna make them their special food or and we we know we're we're gonna turn the heat up a little bit because we know we know we kind of keep it cold around here but we can spend the extra 2.59 today to turn the heat up a little bit and you do whatever you can to make your guests feel comfortable don't you friends if you feel rebuked tonight Christ isn't saying you're worthless little woman a little dishwasher woman your heart not even worth my time anymore he's not saying you've squandered what I've given you you've spent so much time looking at the world and he's not saying any of that through the sermon tonight he's saying I care about you enough to send you a preacher that's dealing with the same thing and to tell you that I want more time with you to tell you that I don't want another man having his way with my wife I don't want to see a man flirting with my wife and I'm sending that that this man tonight not just to rebuke you in love but rebuke that man that's been flirting with you that influence and to rebuke him hard because that's not when I speak straight about Hollywood and when I straight speak straight about the social media and things I'm not rebuking you I'm rebuking of that thing I'm rebuking that you that that man that's been flirting with the bride of Jesus Christ and I'm saying that man needs to go because it's hurting the relationship with God's bride you can't tell me when I can when I can watch a two-minute trailer video of of movies that I hear Believers say they watched and I have to shut it off halfway through the trailer you can't tell me that it's not hurting the relationship of the Bride of Jesus Christ when she begins to call that normal and you might justify it but Brother Bear him said in the in the sermon total different Deliverance he says there's something way down in the heart of a man that knows when he's wrong and if God's touching that part of your heart tonight can I just encourage you as musicians would come to respond to that to respond to it is not just a man with his opinions although I have mine and my journey is incomplete I'm still trying to plow the road for my family but I'm holding a key in my hand I'm I'm not I'm not shouting from from some place some Podium on high I'm down here in the prison house with you and I've got the the key in my hand and the cell door has been opened and I'm holding it I'm I'm running out the cell doors and I'm saying hey come with me don't stay locked up in this digital world don't stay locked up in screen time don't let that be your lot in life respond to Jesus Christ let more let him let more of him come into your life I wonder if we could stand this evening as they would play something Softly [Music] [Music] let's go before the Lord just a minute dear Lord I delivered my heart the words that you've given me Lord but now comes that special time in the service are we reserve just a small portion for your people to respond to you it's always such a special time to me Lord see how your bride responds to you after the word and I hope the people tonight can down to even the youngest one down to the most immature one I hope they can see tonight Lord that it's not them responding to my words Lord there would be a real feeling they've heard from you asking for more Fellowship Lord more relationship to get rid of the accursion thing cut off the influences to make sure that the token is applied to their phone applied to the entrances into their heart [Music] friends I wonder if you would just leave a little space this evening for the Lord did speak to your heart [Music] you're a fool if you think this sermon doesn't touch some aspect of your life if not your life and someone in your family that you may have responsibility for or have influence with [Music] I don't know that I would know anyone in this generation that wouldn't hear this call of the Lord say I want more of you and less it influence the world now how much you've let the world come and influence you that's between you and God how much you've got to scrape out of your heart that's between you and God but God is able God is able to thoroughly Purge your heart friends of every influence and to fill you up with his spirit but I wonder if you desire that tonight I wonder if there would be any honest hearts that would just lift their hands tonight [Music] and say Lord that's that's my desire to change to change the way things have been going to change the direction of things to change how much importance I put upon friends and Facebook social media to change how much importance I put upon the Council of the world [Music] and to really start bearing my face in the word and letting myself be changed in a greater way from Glory into Glory [Music] God bless those Honest Hearts I believe the Lord sees those tonight [Music] I would be anyone that would like to come forward for prayer with your pastor brother Paul tonight as I am just close out the sermon foreign here and brother Paul I'm sure they'd be happy to pray with you if you'd like to come
