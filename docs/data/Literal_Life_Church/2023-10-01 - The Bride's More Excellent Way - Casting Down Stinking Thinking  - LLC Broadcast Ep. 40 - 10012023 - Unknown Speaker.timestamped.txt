[6:04] second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[6:07] 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do
[6:12] not war after the flesh
[6:14] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[6:16] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[6:19] pulling down of strongholds and that's a
[6:22] reference to something in war where you
[6:25] have strongholds we have walls in the
[6:27] Old Testament different things that are
[6:29] are blocking us and so we have a power
[6:32] within the word and within the spirit of
[6:34] God that will pull down strongholds and
[6:37] we're thankful for that but remember we
[6:39] don't walk in the flesh we are we are
[6:41] fleshly we are human we make mistakes
[6:44] can you say Amen so but though he said
[6:46] we walk in the flesh verse 3 we do not
[6:49] war after the flesh so we cannot fight
[6:51] demons with fleshly power
[6:55] we can't respond to demonic forces and
[6:58] what Satan brings us with just an
[7:01] intellect or something human it has to
[7:03] be something more powerful so even
[7:05] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[7:07] war after the flesh weapons of our
[7:09] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[7:11] through God to the pulling down of
[7:13] strongholds casting down imaginations
[7:15] and every High thing that exalteth
[7:18] itself against the knowledge of God and
[7:21] bringing into captivity every thought to
[7:24] The Obedience of Christ and having an a
[7:27] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[7:31] when your obedience is fulfilled that's
[7:34] quite a statement in itself that having
[7:35] a Readiness we're prepared to Revenge
[7:38] all uh all disobedience
[7:41] so no that now that's you know we we
[7:43] talk about revenge we're not supposed to
[7:46] take revenge on our own hands towards
[7:48] someone else but any Disobedience that's
[7:50] in our life Disobedience and our
[7:52] thoughts that's something we can take
[7:54] revenge on and come against so the whole
[7:57] thought here is as Paul's thought to be
[8:00] able to bring these thoughts captive to
[8:02] him to be ready to Revenge all
[8:05] Disobedience and that our obedience was
[8:07] fulfilled I personally believe this
[8:09] scripture speaks of a final Victory also
[8:12] uh in when he says when your obedience
[8:14] is fulfilled someday your complete
[8:16] obedience will be fulfilled when the
[8:19] love of God moves us then we need to go
[8:21] without and we need to watch what it
[8:24] does can you say mom when the love of
[8:26] God moves you you need to go with that
[8:28] and go because we need to trust that and
[8:31] then watch what the love of God can do
[8:33] supernaturally and don't let your
[8:36] thinking talk you out of it
[8:39] do you know that your thinking can talk
[8:41] you out of good things that's supposed
[8:42] to come your way
[8:44] your fears can influence your thinking
[8:47] and talk you out of something really
[8:49] good that's supposed to happen to you
[8:50] God's sending something your way and you
[8:53] can talk yourself out of it
[8:54] amen so think about how powerful that is
[8:57] that's Well what we'll speak of but we
[8:59] don't want to let our thinking interrupt
[9:01] and we want to apply in every situation
[9:03] during during the day uh what we're what
[9:06] we're we're learning can you say man
[9:08] that love is flowing through us it
[9:10] should flow out of us and that we need
[9:12] to apply it to every situation my
[9:14] problem I don't know if it's your
[9:15] problem but there's certain situations
[9:16] come up I'll Resort back to I'll figure
[9:18] this one out myself but but we're
[9:21] supposed to say Lord but now here's
[9:22] another situation I'm speaking to my
[9:25] child I'm speaking to this one or that
[9:27] one or speaking to someone else and
[9:29] every situation we just lay back say now
[9:31] what would the love of God want to say
[9:34] here I was going through the Valvoline
[9:37] Instant Oil last night and doing getting
[9:39] my oil changed and my mom's van there
[9:41] and so I won't be long on this but I was
[9:44] just sitting there and when I told him
[9:46] it was a church related vehicle this
[9:49] young man this young man just began to
[9:51] really talk to me and I told him as a
[9:52] church but the talk was very bitter uh
[9:55] he let me know clearly he was an atheist
[9:57] he let me know he grew up in a
[9:59] Conservative Christian Home In Georgia
[10:00] and said well you don't have an accent
[10:01] anymore and he'd only been here just a
[10:04] few years I said usually my wife just
[10:06] still has her accent you know and he
[10:07] said he don't have that well that just
[10:08] opened up and then he talked about his
[10:10] the legalism of his childhood and his
[10:13] parents and just he went on and on and
[10:15] on and on and luckily he had other guys
[10:17] working on my car to get the job done
[10:19] but he just talked and so then you know
[10:22] this is how I thought I'm just being
[10:24] honest with you not my first thought was
[10:25] that that's a ton of scriptures came to
[10:28] me that I could address this I could
[10:30] correct this I could respond quickly
[10:32] because I you know I've fed on the word
[10:34] since I was 16 years old and that was
[10:36] the first but I just sat back said no
[10:38] wait a minute this is an opportunity to
[10:40] say what what's God want to do here
[10:42] instead of just giving a bunch of
[10:44] scriptures and he might associate we me
[10:46] with his family and his childhood and I
[10:49] said Lord what are you doing here
[10:50] because this man's really opening up to
[10:52] me and I don't know him from from
[10:53] anybody and he just really is letting me
[10:55] have it he didn't know as a pastor but
[10:57] you know I was a church related and he
[10:59] just kept getting going and I said I
[11:01] said well isn't it interesting I said I
[11:03] felt the Lord led me to say this isn't
[11:04] it interesting that God you're an
[11:06] atheist Now isn't it bad that somehow in
[11:09] this world God has to be tainted by some
[11:12] bad things that the church does
[11:15] it's too bad that God got tainted for
[11:17] you because to me God should be separate
[11:21] than that he's pure he doesn't have
[11:23] anything to hurt you but yet you
[11:25] associate it with that you know I just
[11:27] said that's too bad and then he went on
[11:28] and on he did all the talking and uh
[11:30] kept going and I said what what was it
[11:33] what was the re what's the real deal
[11:34] he's showing me a tattoo of joining
[11:36] Satan's church and all of it's in
[11:38] retaliation let my parents know I mean
[11:40] it this was this guy was he was a
[11:42] friendly guy but man was he ever bitter
[11:44] and I just said nor let my love reach
[11:48] out to this young man what do you want
[11:50] to say to him and I just begin to feel
[11:52] I'm going to just to say a few things I
[11:54] told him I appreciate you sharing your
[11:56] heart I knew I'd be through there again
[11:57] I said I'll see you next time and just
[12:00] plant the sea a few seeds there that's
[12:01] what I felt to do but I said what was it
[12:04] what's really what what happened he said
[12:05] I'll tell you he said
[12:07] he said the church was trying to be put
[12:10] on such a such a front to everybody and
[12:12] make me put it on he said when I was
[12:14] molested sexually by my uh by uncles or
[12:17] whoever it was as a little boy the
[12:19] church covered that up they wouldn't
[12:21] talk about it they wouldn't deal with it
[12:22] they wouldn't preach against it and he
[12:25] says that's what I said I and you know
[12:26] what fella I understand how you feel
[12:29] because I said that should never happen
[12:32] and so he still was very cold and
[12:34] everything but you know what I got a
[12:35] chance to say a few things just to look
[12:37] past all the front all the bitterness
[12:40] and look past and the way he was talking
[12:42] to me it's almost like he felt like that
[12:45] he was reaching out for something and
[12:48] unsettled and that's what I said and so
[12:51] I I'm going to say I'm going to leave
[12:52] and leave him with some good words and
[12:54] I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for him
[12:56] I'm going to prayer for and I don't know
[12:58] his name I wouldn't say it here tonight
[13:00] but I'm going to pray for him so every
[13:03] everything nothing should be left out of
[13:05] in our lives of something we come up
[13:07] against
[13:09] of praying saying now Lord how do you
[13:11] want your what that which is within me
[13:13] to come out in this situation it might
[13:16] be your husband in an argument with your
[13:17] husband
[13:19] may not be the guy at Valvoline it might
[13:21] be your husband or wife the subject that
[13:24] Paul brings out here is actually first
[13:26] related to Paul being misread by uh a
[13:31] few Believers and so This Is How They
[13:33] misread him back in the first scriptures
[13:35] if you want to break it down in second
[13:36] Corinthians chapter 10 he said I Paul
[13:38] myself beseech you by the meekness and
[13:41] gentleness of Christ who Am presence and
[13:43] base among you
[13:44] but being absent and bold towards you
[13:47] I'm going to pick it up in the Amplified
[13:48] and read it so I want you to catch why
[13:51] Paul's writing this chapter and the
[13:52] theme behind it it's it's some Believers
[13:55] that were Mis uh misunderstanding Paul
[13:57] and this is how they must understood
[13:59] them uh now I Paul urge you to by the
[14:01] gentleness and graciousnesses of Christ
[14:02] I who am meek he said now I who am meek
[14:06] so they say when I'm with you face to
[14:09] face but bold outspoken and fearless
[14:11] towards you when I'm absent so it's not
[14:13] he said that they're actually
[14:15] criticizing some Believers and saying
[14:17] Paul he's so different when he's in the
[14:19] Pulpit he's so different when he's face
[14:20] to face and he's so he's so humble and
[14:23] he's just so gentle about things but the
[14:25] letters we're getting from him my
[14:27] goodness he's raking us over the goals
[14:30] and they were they were clearly
[14:32] misunderstanding his love and
[14:34] misunderstanding him and these were
[14:36] Believers that were doing that and he
[14:38] goes on to say then he says they say
[14:41] when you when you're face to face you're
[14:43] humble and meek but bold when you're out
[14:45] smoking a Fearless when you write us
[14:47] your letters I ask that when I do come I
[14:50] will not be driven to the boldness that
[14:52] I intend to show towards those those few
[14:55] who regard us as if we walked to the
[14:59] flesh like men without the spirit so he
[15:02] discerned that these guys were being
[15:03] these brothers were being carnal about
[15:05] how they were viewing Paul and he said
[15:08] when I come I'm praying that I will be
[15:10] driven to be bold towards those men and
[15:13] also the the how they've misread me for
[15:16] though then he goes into for though we
[15:18] walk in the flesh as mortal men we are
[15:20] human we are mortal men we are we are we
[15:24] have mortal weakness can you say Amen we
[15:27] are not but we are not carrying on our
[15:30] spiritual warfare according to the Flesh
[15:33] and using the weapons of man so they
[15:36] were misreading Paul in what he was
[15:38] saying that somehow it was some carnal
[15:40] agenda that he what he was saying uh in
[15:43] his letters to them and uh I I just can
[15:46] just tell you I have been there and done
[15:48] that and I feel that feeling sometimes
[15:51] people misread your motives and misread
[15:53] the things that you're saying and
[15:55] sometimes would even take it personal
[15:56] and I never intend to want to do that if
[15:59] I do it I apologize for it
[16:01] but I not never want to intend to do
[16:03] that but you know I've met ministers and
[16:05] you can sit across the table from them
[16:07] and you can't hardly get a word out on
[16:10] they're just so quiet uh and they're
[16:12] just they don't hardly say nothing you
[16:14] can't hardly fuss with them because
[16:15] they're just so humble and so quiet we
[16:17] see humble is quiet that's what we
[16:19] associate it with
[16:20] and and but then you see him in the
[16:22] Pulpit just as bold and
[16:25] you know just say it like it is you know
[16:27] and so sometimes the anointing will
[16:30] bring a minister to do that and he's
[16:32] saying things that might appear carnally
[16:35] to you that might hurtful but you don't
[16:38] want to take it as hurtful you want to
[16:40] say this may be the Lord speaking to me
[16:43] but you know he goes on to say here
[16:46] for though we walk in the flesh we are
[16:48] not carrying our Warfare according to
[16:49] the Flesh and using the weapons of man
[16:51] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[16:53] physical weapons of Flesh and but our
[16:55] weapons are divinely powerful for the
[16:59] destruction of fortresses we are
[17:01] destroying listen to this we are
[17:04] destroying sophisticated arguments and
[17:07] every exalted and proud thing that sets
[17:11] itself up against the true knowledge of
[17:14] God we are warring against sophisticated
[17:17] arguments
[17:19] on the internet today
[17:21] that's what we're warning at but we're
[17:23] not warring against it with reasoning or
[17:25] or the spirit of argument can you say
[17:27] man we're coming at it with the love of
[17:30] God and the weapons of our Warfare are
[17:32] our spiritual not carnal you can't fight
[17:35] anger with anger
[17:37] you can't fight carnality with carnality
[17:39] you can't fight an evil spirit with
[17:42] another evil spirit you can't do that it
[17:44] has to be something greater than that
[17:46] evil spirit and so I loved how he this
[17:49] is worded in the Amplified we're
[17:50] destroying the sophisticated arguments
[17:53] and every exalted and proud thing that
[17:55] sets itself against the knowledge of God
[17:57] and we are taking every thought and
[18:00] purpose captive to The Obedience of
[18:03] Christ being ready to punish Every Act
[18:06] of Disobedience when your own obedience
[18:08] as a church is complete so now what we
[18:11] pull out of this section of scripture is
[18:15] something beyond what Paul was saying
[18:17] that these men are judging me carnal he
[18:19] we get the lesson that our the weapons
[18:21] of our Warfare are not carnal they're
[18:23] spiritual and we don't fight back with
[18:25] something carnal Paul's saying I'm a
[18:27] human being being but I can't fight back
[18:29] with something human it has to be
[18:31] something greater than that it has to be
[18:34] the love of God it has to be the the
[18:36] knowledge of God and so now but we take
[18:39] a lesson out of this and what's the
[18:41] lesson we learn Paul is giving the power
[18:45] the the huge power of our own
[18:49] imagination our power comes when we
[18:52] bring this body under subjection to him
[18:55] that that uh that every channel is
[18:58] cleaned out and ready for service for
[19:00] the Lord that the devil doesn't know
[19:02] what channel to get into
[19:04] that's the victory for the bride then
[19:06] let God do what he wants to do through
[19:08] that but our vessels got to be submitted
[19:10] to him we can't have a Victorious Life
[19:12] over to the devil if our imaginations
[19:14] are going wild we can't have a
[19:16] Victorious Life of a reasoning with the
[19:18] word all the time we have to bring those
[19:20] things in our spirit under his
[19:22] leadership
[19:24] so the power of our own imagination in
[19:28] our spirit realm and the worst thing
[19:30] about
[19:31] this realm of imagination is when it
[19:34] will exalt itself above the knowledge of
[19:38] God can you imagine the arrogance
[19:40] Lucifer did it at the beginning
[19:44] he got thoughts he was the right-hand
[19:46] angel of God
[19:48] and he got started to have thoughts
[19:51] and those thoughts got him into the
[19:53] different thoughts of lifting himself I
[19:55] will be above the most high can you
[19:57] imagine the arrogance
[20:00] and so his thoughts became so powerful
[20:03] that he actually begin to a a connive a
[20:07] plan to somehow bring in him lift
[20:10] himself above the knowledge of God and
[20:13] set himself above God and so now we
[20:15] shouldn't always we know the devil did
[20:17] that but it shows the power of a human
[20:20] mind
[20:21] that can be in us even
[20:23] let me just say it this way if the
[20:25] Lucifer did that at the beginning his
[20:27] own thoughts eventually got so arrogant
[20:29] that I will lift myself above the I will
[20:33] sit as him and be worshiped of God if if
[20:36] if your thoughts
[20:38] exalt itself above the word of God who
[20:41] are you being inspired by
[20:44] so this is you know the worst thing
[20:46] about it is it lifts itself above the
[20:48] knowledge of God that's a serious thing
[20:49] that's a tragic thing when it's happened
[20:52] it's actually to me the worst thing that
[20:54] a Christian can let happen is to let our
[20:58] own thinking or Satan's thing thinking
[21:00] lift itself above the knowledge of God
[21:03] what does it do it quenches the spirit
[21:05] of God from moving in you
[21:07] it quenches the spirit of God from
[21:10] moving in the church it's stunts your
[21:13] growth
[21:15] it keeps marriages and families from
[21:18] finding that key to get out of the rut
[21:20] that they're in to get out of the spirit
[21:22] that's with them for years it stunts and
[21:25] it keeps a marriage and family from the
[21:28] key because sometimes there's just a key
[21:30] of faith that unlocks and all of a
[21:33] sudden in a moment's time forgiveness
[21:35] comes in and things are changed and
[21:37] Everything's changed can you say man but
[21:39] if our minds interrupt that it quenches
[21:42] that from happening you see and people
[21:44] can live in a miserable marriage for
[21:46] years sometimes even living together
[21:48] living separate but it's because there's
[21:50] something holding them from getting that
[21:53] key that unlocks Faith to change the
[21:55] situation
[21:57] and so when our thoughts lift themselves
[22:00] above the knowledge of God it quenches
[22:02] the love of God it quenches the spirit
[22:03] of God it stunts our growth it it
[22:06] hinders families it brings bondage to
[22:09] marriages and families what what is it
[22:11] your own thinking has the power to do
[22:14] that your own thoughts our thoughts are
[22:15] to be under the spotlight of God's word
[22:18] and his spirit all the time always
[22:21] subject to to uh to being corrected
[22:27] always subject to the scrutiny of the
[22:30] Holy Spirit
[22:32] always
[22:35] because of 9 11 happening in our country
[22:37] we will never ever enter an airport
[22:40] again without walking through the
[22:42] scanner
[22:44] you realize that
[22:45] we'll never have a day when we won't be
[22:48] walking through something to scan what's
[22:50] on our body after 9 11.
[22:54] because we learned
[22:56] the enemy can get through
[22:59] so now we have to scanner you're not an
[23:01] enemy you might not have a gun you're
[23:03] not a terrorist but because everybody's
[23:06] suspect right we all got it for the rest
[23:09] of our lives we're never going to change
[23:11] it we'll never enter an airport again
[23:13] without a scanner and if that's a lesson
[23:15] Force we realize if you have a 911 in
[23:17] your life and you have a jolt in your
[23:19] life of what the enemy did to you to
[23:21] tear up your marriage or tear up your
[23:23] life or make you fall that's a 911 that
[23:26] says from now on every thought is
[23:28] captive to the Lord and every thought is
[23:31] scanned scanned and checked by the Holy
[23:34] Spirit
[23:35] because it was my thought life that got
[23:37] me into all that it was my thoughts in
[23:40] pornography that led me to adultery
[23:44] it started with my thoughts is anybody
[23:47] listening tonight it starts in the
[23:49] thought life nobody goes and sins right
[23:51] away it starts in their thinking it
[23:54] starts and then they think that I want
[23:55] more of that Allah so I'm going to look
[23:57] at pornography I'm going to look at this
[23:58] magazine I'm going to look at this woman
[23:59] I'm going to keep doing but it started
[24:01] in their thoughts they let their
[24:03] thoughts be uncontrolled and unchecked
[24:05] by the Holy Spirit
[24:06] and then it turns into sin and so if you
[24:09] have a 911 you better start saying every
[24:12] thought comes under the Captivity of the
[24:14] Lord there is no thought allowed to
[24:16] think on my own it's scanned by the Holy
[24:19] Spirit
[24:19] and if it's a negative thought it's a
[24:21] thought to put somebody down if it's a
[24:23] thought against me when you've got
[24:25] everything under the blood and Satan's
[24:26] accusing you if it's a thought from
[24:28] Satan you're an unworthy believer you
[24:30] don't deserve to come and worship God
[24:31] you don't deserve to even pray today
[24:33] because of what you've done that's a
[24:35] thought that originates in the pits of
[24:37] hell and you quickly say that's not of
[24:39] God it gets scanned it gets out of here
[24:41] it's Satan trying to be bring a gun
[24:43] through the airport can you say man he's
[24:45] bringing a weapon against you in the
[24:46] airport but it gets scanned and it gets
[24:48] confiscated
[24:51] that thought gets confiscated and will
[24:54] not be allowed to go any further into
[24:56] the airport
[24:57] so this is our text
[24:59] casting down
[25:01] imagination
[25:03] for the weapons of other casting down
[25:05] imaginations
[25:07] and and everything that exalteth itself
[25:11] above against the knowledge of God it's
[25:14] contrary so we cast down that
[25:16] imagination we cast down that stinking
[25:20] thinking we cast down what's lifting
[25:23] itself higher than than the leadership
[25:26] of the Lord can you say Amen
[25:28] you think I'm not talking to you as a
[25:30] teenager tonight
[25:32] or as a young man or as a young woman
[25:35] say well I don't even know about what
[25:36] what you're preaching I you know I can't
[25:38] catch all of it you can catch this
[25:42] say I'm only 12 years old you can catch
[25:43] what I'm saying here because guess what
[25:45] when you leave here and even tonight
[25:46] while I was preaching your thought just
[25:48] wandered off somewhere what am I going
[25:51] to do tomorrow
[25:52] I wonder if my my school is going to be
[25:55] difficult tomorrow you have a mind you
[25:56] have a brain you had thoughts
[25:59] and if you looked at something dirty
[26:01] today then your mind's going back to
[26:03] that and I might go back and look at
[26:04] that when I get home
[26:06] so this message is for you tonight this
[26:08] message is for you teenager and it would
[26:11] be better that you get filled with this
[26:13] Holy Spirit and bring your mind under
[26:15] control when you're 10 12 years old it
[26:18] would be better you listen to this fat
[26:19] preacher now and get you now
[26:24] and you could live a lot more Victorious
[26:27] the rest of your life
[26:28] because when you get to 25 30 years old
[26:30] and you fed on wrong things and your
[26:32] mind is all messed up
[26:34] it's a lot harder for the Lord to get a
[26:36] hold of you
[26:37] becomes concrete you'd be like that guy
[26:40] at Valvoline oil Instant Oil Change that
[26:43] is so bitter and atheist I don't even
[26:45] believe in God anymore
[26:48] that's how far mind can go
[26:51] but I'm going to keep loving because
[26:53] there's a there's a force of love of God
[26:55] that can change that and when your
[26:57] thoughts
[27:00] are led to the exalt itself above the
[27:02] word of God then what inspiration are
[27:05] you under that's under the same one as
[27:06] Lucifer from the beginning can you say
[27:09] Amen
[27:10] so we have stinking thinking we have
[27:13] we're to cast down any stinking thinking
[27:16] when it has a smell on it we need to
[27:19] admit that it smells you ever had
[27:21] somebody that smells and they don't
[27:24] smell it
[27:27] but everybody else can
[27:31] and so they need a shower or they
[27:33] something you don't need something and
[27:35] and so but it smells and and so we need
[27:37] to have a sensitivity when thoughts are
[27:40] stinking thinking that's a thought
[27:41] that's stinking that smells that doesn't
[27:43] ring with the aroma of God
[27:46] amen we need to admit it when something
[27:48] a thought doesn't smell right and it's
[27:51] pretty bad when we lose our smell for
[27:54] stinking thinking we should be able to
[27:56] see so sensitive we can smell sin when
[27:58] it's coming we can smell a Temptation
[28:01] when it's coming at us and we can smell
[28:03] stink and think in a bad thought that
[28:05] Satan's thought we can smell it when
[28:07] it's coming and get rid of it
