[6:30] [Music]
[7:14] to Genesis 26 and verse 1 and there was
[7:17] a famine in the land beside this the
[7:19] first famine that was in the days of
[7:20] Abraham and Isaac went unto abimelech
[7:23] King of the Philistines into career and
[7:26] the Lord appeared unto him and said go
[7:28] down go not down into Egypt dwell on the
[7:31] land which I shall tell thee of sojourn
[7:33] in this land and I will be with thee and
[7:36] will bless thee For unto thee and unto
[7:38] thy seed I will give all these countries
[7:41] and I will perform the oath which I
[7:43] swear unto Abraham thy father and I will
[7:46] make thy seed to multiply as the stars
[7:48] of heaven and will give unto thee thy
[7:51] seed all these countries and in thy seed
[7:54] shall all the nations of the earth be
[7:56] blessed this is the same blessing that
[7:58] came on his father Abraham and now God
[8:00] revisits him because how many know that
[8:02] the blessings of Our Father Abraham
[8:04] falls on all his seed after him because
[8:07] that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my
[8:10] charge and my Commandments my statues my
[8:12] laws and Isaac dwelt in Greer and the
[8:15] men of the place asked him of his wife
[8:17] and he said she is my sister for he
[8:19] feared to say she is my wife lest said
[8:21] he the men of the place should kill me
[8:23] for Rebecca because she was a she was
[8:25] fair to look upon and it came to pass
[8:28] when he had been there a long time that
[8:30] bemnat king of Philistines looked out at
[8:32] a window and saw and behold Isaac was
[8:34] sporting with Rebecca his wife and
[8:36] abimelech called Isaac and said behold
[8:39] of a surety she is thy wife and house
[8:41] sayeth thou she is my sister and Isaac
[8:44] said in him because I said lest I die
[8:46] for her and abimelech said what is this
[8:49] thou has done unto us one of the people
[8:51] might lightly have lion with thy wife
[8:54] and thou shouldest have brought guilty
[8:56] guilt guiltiness upon us and abimelech
[8:59] charged all his people saying he that
[9:01] toucheth this man or his wife shall
[9:03] surely be put to death then Isaac sowed
[9:06] in that land and received in the same
[9:08] year a hundredfold and the Lord blessed
[9:10] him so I want you to notice now an
[9:12] elected Abraham seed coming by but he
[9:14] has to go because of the famine down
[9:16] into Greer and these other places that
[9:19] are that will become difficult places
[9:21] because you're going to run into
[9:22] jealousy and you're going to run into
[9:24] trouble and you're going to run into
[9:25] problems and you're going to be run into
[9:28] reactions of people because you're not
[9:30] in your own land you're having to go
[9:32] into places like you have to go into
[9:35] places of life that are not going to be
[9:37] the best response even though you're the
[9:40] Blessed of God
[9:41] so this is a type now in Isaac's life
[9:44] it's a type of the Bride now because we
[9:46] are certainly not in our homeland right
[9:48] now
[9:49] spiritually we are but we're not in our
[9:51] homeland yet so we're living in every
[9:53] day in Satan's Eden we're living in a
[9:55] career we're living in a a place where
[9:58] you're not going to be accepted and
[9:59] there's going to be all kinds of
[10:00] situations happen in your life just
[10:03] simply because you're blessed and you're
[10:05] the promised of God and when you get
[10:07] into those situations you're going to
[10:09] have reactions from people what I want
[10:11] you to notice in this is Isaac's
[10:13] reaction to all of it because we can't
[10:17] change what the world treats us like
[10:20] what our trials treat us like but we can
[10:23] change or God can change how we react to
[10:26] all of it verse 13 and the man whacks
[10:29] great and went forward and grew until he
[10:31] became very great so Isaac was being
[10:34] blessed in these situations no matter
[10:35] what he was prospering I may believe you
[10:38] can prosper spiritually in any situation
[10:41] for he had possessions of flocks and
[10:43] possession of herds and great storm
[10:44] servants and the Philistines envied him
[10:47] okay there's the jealousy the Envy for
[10:49] all the wells which his father's
[10:51] servants had digged in the days of
[10:52] Abraham his father in the Philistines
[10:54] had stopped them and filled them with
[10:55] Earth and abimelech said unto Isaac go
[10:57] from us for thou art much mightier than
[11:00] we so he just sends them away sends
[11:02] Isaac away and Isaac notice now no
[11:05] response he said look what I'm doing
[11:07] here I I'm I'm prospering here if they
[11:10] had to pay taxes then it's like you
[11:13] could say sometimes I want to say to
[11:14] townships and different ones you know we
[11:16] pay taxes here and you're making us feel
[11:18] unwelcome and he could have responded
[11:20] but Isaac didn't respond to any of it
[11:21] you know what he just polite he said all
[11:23] right I'll move on to another piece of
[11:25] land here
[11:27] and Isaac departed this and pitched his
[11:29] tint in the valley of Greer and dwelt
[11:31] there and Isaac did begin the wells of
[11:32] water which they had digged in the days
[11:33] of Abraham his father noticed these are
[11:35] his possession that's it's Abraham he
[11:38] dug these well for the Philistines had
[11:40] stopped them after the death of Abraham
[11:42] and he called their names after the
[11:43] names by which his father had called
[11:44] them and Isaac's servants digged in the
[11:47] valley and found their well-springing
[11:49] water so now once he starts digging
[11:51] these old Wells out then he starts to
[11:53] find water none of these guys could find
[11:55] that so he's blessed in fine water you
[11:57] can imagine how the jealousy just keeps
[11:59] Rising my goodness look what he's doing
[12:01] they become jealous and envious and
[12:03] start to turn against them even more
[12:05] Isaac servants digged in the valley and
[12:07] found there as well springing and the
[12:09] Herdman of guerrer did strive with
[12:12] Isaac's Herdman saying the water is ours
[12:14] and he called the name of the well esek
[12:16] because they strove with them and that
[12:18] means that they want to defuss they
[12:20] wanted to Stew they wanted to argue they
[12:23] wanted to have Strife they wanted to get
[12:25] mad they they were jealous and they they
[12:27] digged another well and strove for that
[12:29] also and he called the name of it sitna
[12:33] and he removed from thence and digged
[12:35] another well and for that they strove
[12:36] not and he called the name of it
[12:38] rehabath and he said for now the Lord
[12:40] hath made room for us and we shall be
[12:42] fruitful in the land and he went up from
[12:44] thence to Beersheba and the Lord
[12:46] appeared unto him the same night and
[12:47] said as the Lord appearing to him again
[12:49] I am the god of Abraham thy father fear
[12:52] not for I am with thee and will bless
[12:55] thee and multiply thy seed for my
[12:57] servant Abraham's sake I know I'm taking
[12:59] a while here but I'm getting this now
[13:00] I'm preaching on this now so I won't
[13:02] have to come back to it but I want you
[13:04] to notice in the midst of a trial in the
[13:06] midst of people wanting to argue people
[13:08] want to fuss Express every other thing
[13:10] but love Isaac expresses it and right in
[13:13] the middle of that God Appears to him
[13:16] again and encourages them in I'm with
[13:19] you doesn't God do that with you
[13:21] sometimes
[13:22] if we're faithful to say Lord I want to
[13:25] walk with you and and give the right
[13:27] response back to people and give Divine
[13:30] love back to people when they're fussing
[13:32] and acting a certain way and treat them
[13:34] with respect the lord loves that and the
[13:36] Lord comes on the scene to Isaac said
[13:38] Don't Fear I am with thee I Will Bless
[13:41] thee and multiply thy seed for my
[13:42] servant Abraham say and he builded an
[13:44] altar there and called upon the name of
[13:46] the Lord and pitched his Dent there and
[13:47] their Isaac service digged a well then
[13:49] abimelech went to him from Greer and has
[13:52] us one of his friends and file and the
[13:55] chief captain of his army and Isaac said
[13:56] unto them wherever Come Ye to me
[13:59] coming back again to fuss with them
[14:02] seeing ye hate me and have sent me away
[14:05] from you you're the one that sent me
[14:07] away you're the one that's expressing
[14:09] hatred here why are you coming out to me
[14:12] again and that's the way spirits will do
[14:14] in your life they're going to keep
[14:16] coming after you you've expressed love
[14:19] they're going to keep coming and keep
[14:21] coming and agitating and wanting to fuss
[14:24] with you can you say Amen Isaac's
[14:27] response was only one response because
[14:29] he expressed the mystery of divine love
[14:31] and that is that no matter what they do
[14:35] I'm going to stay in my calling God's
[14:37] chosen me I if they asked me to move
[14:40] I'll move over here and do my work
[14:41] diligently for the Lord and his promise
[14:43] I'm going to live in his promise and
[14:45] whatever I do I don't want to react and
[14:48] be like them God throughout history of
[14:52] the Old Testament was actually building
[14:53] towards something and when he came to
[14:56] his final Masterpiece it's kind of like
[14:58] a sculptor he takes many many years and
[15:01] a sculptor would take and God was taking
[15:03] through the Old Testament many many
[15:04] years until he got to his final
[15:06] Masterpiece in Jesus Christ I like to
[15:09] say it this way in the Old Testament God
[15:11] was trying to say something unless you
[15:13] have spiritual discernment it's hard to
[15:15] read the Old Testament but when you have
[15:16] Revelation the whole entire book of
[15:19] books of all the Old Testament God is
[15:21] trying to say something and he was
[15:23] trying to say something he's trying to
[15:24] say something in types and shadows and
[15:26] lives but then when Jesus came on the
[15:28] scene Jesus was what God was trying to
[15:32] say
[15:33] Jesus was the Masterpiece that God was
[15:36] building all through the Old Testament
[15:38] can you say amen and he come to his
[15:40] final Masterpiece and this one and think
[15:42] about what he was building a man like us
[15:45] he was virgin board but he was a man
[15:46] like us God came down and became us and
[15:49] God actually put his fullness within
[15:51] that man that God could express himself
[15:53] on Earth and see what God would look
[15:55] like on the face of the Earth that's was
[15:57] God's mystery as they would come down
[15:59] and express himself to man so that was
[16:01] God's Christ was God's Masterpiece all
[16:04] the character of God all the love of God
[16:05] all everything that was God he poured
[16:08] into that physical vessel and it was
[16:10] expressed to the world so everything was
[16:12] a build up in the Old Testament to get
[16:15] to that final Masterpiece but God's work
[16:18] did not stop there just like God did not
[16:21] stop his work in the Garden of Eden when
[16:23] he stopped with Adam he didn't stop with
[16:25] Adam there was another mystery that was
[16:28] there was another Masterpiece to be
[16:30] formed not just Adam how many knows he
[16:33] didn't stop it Adam there was an eve
[16:35] that was to become a masterpiece too and
[16:37] she was part of the whole mystery of God
[16:39] and so just like he did he took Eve out
[16:42] of Adam now when he finishes with Jesus
[16:44] Christ two thousand years ago as his
[16:47] Masterpiece not his final Masterpiece
[16:49] but his Masterpiece now he takes out of
[16:51] the sight of Jesus Christ you wonder why
[16:54] the the there's the types and shadows
[16:56] and things that we can look at but he
[16:58] takes that spear that Roman surgery and
[17:00] he puts it up in into Christ into his
[17:02] side and blood and water comes out of
[17:04] Christ and spirit comes out of him and
[17:07] we know he gives up the ghost he raises
[17:09] on the third day but then something
[17:10] happened his Spirit did not just go up
[17:13] into heaven his Spirit came back on a
[17:16] group of people what was God doing God
[17:19] was bringing Eve out of Adam
[17:23] God was beginning to form a woman of
[17:27] many membered bride just like he did
[17:29] taking Eve out of Adam now he was going
[17:31] to form a many member body that would be
[17:34] the next Masterpiece can you say man and
[17:38] these would not be virgin born these
[17:40] would be sin-born people that have such
[17:43] a new birth in their life they would be
[17:46] transformed by the power of God and they
[17:49] have the potential now to become Sons
[17:51] and Daughters of God and express the
[17:54] Masterpiece of God to this world oh I
[17:57] just explained to you God's full mystery
[17:59] can you say Amen that God did not stop
[18:02] with Jesus Christ but he wanted to have
[18:04] a bride and now here we are two thousand
[18:06] years after that and I can tell you God
[18:10] is culminating this statue this this
[18:13] image this masterpiece and he's doing it
[18:17] not in a building like this not in
[18:19] fineries of churches but he's doing it
[18:22] in people
[18:24] praise the Lord he's doing it in a
[18:27] people he's going to have a bride
[18:28] Ephesians he'll have a spotless bride
[18:30] without wrinkle without blemish Washed
[18:33] by the Water of his word we're coming to
[18:35] the final climax of a people that are
[18:38] the full expression of the image of God
[18:40] there's several stages that a sculptor
[18:44] that's like Michelangelo or someone like
[18:46] that when they're going to do a statue
[18:48] there's several stages that they go
[18:50] through and you can read those stages
[18:52] there's many stages they go through to
[18:54] get to the final product can you say man
[18:57] there's many different facets and phases
[18:59] and things that they do and so you can
[19:02] learn things from that because we
[19:04] realize God is our great Michelangelo
[19:06] God is our great architect God's our
[19:08] great sculptor can you say amen and he
[19:11] over time forms this Great Masterpiece
[19:14] and he does it to his certain way but
[19:17] it's just like a natural sculptor we can
[19:20] learn so much about God in our lives and
[19:23] somebody one of our misses ought to
[19:24] preach a sermon and just take all the
[19:26] stages of a sculptor but we can assume
[19:29] some things about a sculptor that we
[19:31] know if it's a really great statue like
[19:34] Michelangelo did some we know that it
[19:36] takes years to do it it doesn't take a
[19:39] week it doesn't take a month it doesn't
[19:41] take a year I was in the Vatican and
[19:45] scene of my someone Michael I was I was
[19:46] I seen a bunch of stuff that you've done
[19:48] and I guarantee you there are countless
[19:50] years that the sculpture took of working
[19:53] on it and working on it and working on
[19:55] it until he got to something you know
[19:58] what he got to he had a vision already
[20:00] in his mind what that was supposed to
[20:02] look at and and it looked like and he
[20:04] kept working on it and chiseling it and
[20:07] working on it until finally someday the
[20:10] vision that was already in his heart
[20:12] finally one day after years he seized
[20:15] the vision right in front of him in a
[20:16] statue I'm telling your friends the same
[20:19] God is working in our lives can you say
[20:21] amen and it may take years but if you'll
[20:24] submit to him he'll keep chiseling he'll
[20:26] keep working because why our God has a
[20:29] vision in his mind can you say Amen of
[20:32] what we're supposed to come to now when
[20:35] you have a sculptor number one we can
[20:37] assume it takes years how many would say
[20:39] Amen it takes years it takes many types
[20:41] of tools
[20:44] there's big tools that take big chunks
[20:46] there's little tools fine tools we
[20:49] consume it goes through many stages of
[20:51] cutting chunks are taken off and little
[20:53] carvings and then just little areas
[20:55] which something you feel like who've
[20:56] been in the way of the Lord a little
[20:58] while it's what I felt like the last uh
[21:00] two or three weeks here maybe a month
[21:02] God dealing with things in my life very
[21:04] very secret things and he just takes
[21:06] that little chisel and the thing he
[21:08] thought you're pretty good you're doing
[21:09] pretty good in your Christian walking
[21:10] then the Lord just says but but what
[21:12] about this I'm going to just shave that
[21:14] off
[21:18] and I've been down a little bit but at
[21:20] the same time I've learned let God do it
[21:22] let him dig it out
[21:24] let them carve that little thing because
[21:26] if it brings me closer to my goal a
[21:29] Divine love coming from this vessel I'll
[21:30] take the carving
[21:32] just that little edgy you might feel
[21:34] like your pastor's like that I'm just
[21:36] got that little tool I'm just I'm just
[21:38] digging right in that little spot
[21:42] but I love you
[21:44] I really do
[21:45] it's not me it's the Lord that loves you
[21:48] you think I know everything I don't know
[21:50] everything God knows everything though
[21:52] and if people come and counsel and stuff
[21:55] that's wonderful but most times if we
[21:57] just pray and let the Lord deal with us
[21:59] he'll speak things across the pulpit
[22:02] you get well that man didn't know about
[22:04] that and he gets right down in those
[22:06] little areas and exposes it say now I
[22:09] got I got to cut that off because it
[22:10] doesn't match the vision of what you're
[22:12] supposed to be God's got a vision of
[22:13] what you're supposed to be
[22:15] and you ain't there yet
[22:17] you think you're there and you're not
[22:19] there yet
[22:21] but we're on our road
[22:23] he's still working on me
[22:26] to make me what I ought to be it took
[22:29] him just a week to make the moon in
[22:31] Stars the Earth and the Sun Jupiter and
[22:33] Mars how loving and patient he must be
[22:37] he's still working on me
[22:41] amen
[22:43] uh there's another thing here that the
[22:45] sculptor does
[22:47] he's got that vision and he'll know when
[22:50] he sees it and he keeps working and
[22:52] shaving off what's needed to get to that
[22:55] Vision that's our life and if we would
[22:57] learn to stand still
[22:59] then God can do his work so now as we
[23:03] look at these things I want us bring us
[23:05] back into the channel of my PowerPoint
[23:07] here and talking about the different
[23:10] attributes of divine love this made me
[23:12] get very basic like it did a few weeks
[23:13] ago and we were dealing we dealt with
[23:16] out of 15 attributes of divine love in
[23:19] First Corinthians we dealt with the
[23:20] first three attributes of divine love
[23:23] all right so here's the next one
[23:26] love
[23:27] does not brag or boast love does not
[23:32] brag or boast and here's the scripture I
[23:33] gave you Matthew 6 1 says take heed that
[23:36] you do not your alms before men to be
[23:38] seen of them otherwise ye have no reward
[23:40] of your father which is in heaven
[23:42] therefore
[23:43] when thou doest thine alms do not sound
[23:46] a trumpet before thee that's bragging
[23:49] do not sound a trumpet before thee as
[23:52] the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and
[23:54] in the streets that they may have Glory
[23:56] of man that thine arms may be in secret
[23:59] thy father would seeth and secret
[24:00] himself shall reward thee openly and
[24:02] when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as
[24:04] the Hypocrites are for thy love to
[24:06] praise they love to pray standing in the
[24:08] synagogues in the corners of the streets
[24:09] that they may be seen of men verily I
[24:12] saying you they have their reward
[24:15] but thou will now prayers enter into thy
[24:17] closet and when thou has shut the door
[24:18] pray to thy father which is in secret
[24:20] and thy father which seeth in secret
[24:22] shall reward thee openly there's
[24:23] something wrong with somebody who keeps
[24:25] directing the conversation back to their
[24:28] life their story
[24:30] their successes
[24:32] they have to one-up everybody
[24:36] When Love focuses on one another on the
[24:40] other person love focuses on that but
[24:42] this person it's not that we can't give
[24:44] glory to God and brag on him or bro or
[24:47] say God did this in my life and there's
[24:51] there's a certain way that you can bring
[24:53] it but this is a constant directing
[24:55] things back to me myself and I and
[24:59] bragging about it love focuses on
[25:01] another not self and there's another
[25:03] thing love focuses on and that's giving
[25:05] glory to God when you're bragging about
[25:08] yourself you're not giving glory to God
[25:10] John MacArthur JR says bragging and
[25:13] pride stem from selfishness and they are
[25:16] the flip side of jealousy we've already
[25:18] dealt with jealousy and what that is and
[25:19] that's not in Divine love as well but
[25:21] jealousy this is the flip side of
[25:23] jealousy jealousy is wanting what
[25:25] someone else has bragging is trying to
[25:28] make others jealous of what you have
[25:32] so you're talking about constantly
[25:33] because you want to get attention you're
[25:35] craving for attention so you're bragging
[25:37] on yourself and your successes and all
[25:39] that you've done Divine love doesn't do
[25:41] this jealousy is wanting what someone
[25:43] else has bragging is trying to make
[25:44] others jealous of what we have jealousy
[25:46] puts others down bragging builds us up
[25:49] bragging is an outward manifestation of
[25:52] Pride we'll get to Pride in a minute but
[25:54] bragging is the outward manifestation of
[25:56] Pride the braggart tries to impress
[25:58] others of his Great accomplishments in
[26:01] order to make himself look good
[26:04] so in relation Pride now love is not
[26:07] arrogant or proud and and and
[26:10] bragging and boasting is interrelated
[26:13] with pride you brag because you are
[26:16] proud
[26:17] when pride comes
[26:19] boiling up with an arrogant attitude of
[26:21] self-importance then come dishonor and
[26:24] shame but with the humble the teachable
[26:26] who have been chiseled ah
[26:30] teachable who have been chiseled by
[26:32] trial and who have learned to walk
[26:34] humbly with God there is wisdom and
[26:36] soundness of mine so that's the fruits
[26:39] of the humble but the fruits of a
[26:40] bullying up with arrogant attitude of
[26:42] self-importance it's all about three
[26:44] people me myself and I everything you'll
[26:47] destroy your marriage if you're all
[26:49] about yourself you destroy your family
[26:51] if you're all about yourself
[26:53] when pride comes
[26:55] arrogant attitude about self-importance
[26:57] then come dishonor and shame that's the
[26:59] fruits from this continued years of
[27:02] self-importance it's all about me all
[27:04] that comes is dishonor and shame in the
[27:06] family dishonor and shame in your life
[27:07] and other people's lives that's the
[27:09] fruit of it
[27:11] to talk a lot about the pride of life
[27:13] and the pride of this world
[27:15] but to Christians I've got to move into
[27:17] an area of religious Pride
[27:21] because religious pride is the worst
[27:23] kind
[27:27] to think that you are more spiritual
[27:29] than anyone else
[27:32] as I read in Matthew 6 the Pharisees
[27:34] they did everything over the top and but
[27:37] they did it for the wrong motive they
[27:39] did everything over the top but it was
[27:40] to appear more holy than the other men
[27:44] I thank God that I'm not like this
[27:45] sinner here
[27:48] everything the Pharisees did was to
[27:51] appear more holy to other men as better
[27:53] than other men a religious spirit thinks
[27:56] it has it all together and looks down on
[27:59] others no one ever measures up to where
[28:02] they are at I hope you're listening to
[28:03] me one and all a religious spirit you
[28:06] don't want a religious spirit you want
[28:08] the holy spirit thank you for watching
