for granted and we surely we surely don't do that well God bless you all uh good to be back and uh glad to see that we're not the only family on the men that gradually we're getting better perhaps we can open our Bibles to Revelation chapter three and uh we'll we're going to talk again speak again from Revelation 3 on the uh seventh Church age allowed to say in church age and looking at the themes of repentance and uh and restoration and uh this may very well be the uh the last part in this uh in this series and I thank you all for your uh for your patience the last uh last uh I think year and a half or so it's been a while but it's been a real been a real blessing for for me personally but uh we'll just start here from verse verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lisans write these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would you were were cold or hot so then because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you out of my mouth because you say I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know not that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked and that uh verse 17 is where we're going to kind of focus uh um for the first part this evening Lord willing we'll get through uh the rest of this as well this evening but let's just uh take this to the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you very much for your goodness and your grace father Lord as we read the description of the uh of of the church age in which we've been um grown up and and and born and we can be so thankful Lord that we've heard a call to out to come out of that and come into a personal uh walk with you that's so much richer than an organizational walk Lord we just uh we're very grateful for this message Lord that that you've put something into our hearts to hear so that we can walk personally with you oh God lord I just pray that you would anoint my words this evening in Jesus name amen Lord bless you may be seated so last uh um I think it would been last year in December uh last service we were looking at the loudan church and we noted uh four different ways that was described through the um description as in as we found it in Revelation 3:14 the first thing that God says um he knows them um actually he doesn't say he knows them he knows their Works they're the busy Church they're doing all kinds of things and is is something that is good enough for them and uh God knew their works but he never knew them and that's something we want to be careful that we're not going to get caught up into that we want to make sure that God knows us that we know God and it's not just that we're not just busy doing good things cuz I tell you you can be you can be so busy you can be be preparing sermons you can be preparing Bible lessons and things like that but that's not the same as being quiet for the Lord for yourself and you can be busy doing all these good things on the inside you can feel like you're it there's nothing there there in and then the next thing that we notice about them um the scripture says that they lukewarm church and there wasn't just idea of temperature really spoke to me when I for the last service they wer really interested in living the truth they were just interested in debating the truth and you have to be interested in doing more than talking about it because talking is very very easy um you're committed to something you can be skeptical you can f find fault in things but when you're really living it and determin to live it that is uh that is not lukewarm that is that that's and last the third thing I noticed um it's the talking church it's the only church age whose own words are being recorded and and they're saying God I've done this I've done that I've done all these other things and almost like it's me it's me it's me oh Lord look at all I've done they're not asking God to do anything because they don't feel that they need anything and it's it's the it's the talking church and we want to make sure that we're not just talking to God but we're actually being still and and listening that's right and lastly we saw that they were the desensitized church because we saw that they um they no that's what we'll do our best here they desensitized church because they're wretched miserable poor blind and naked and don't know it and that was just the the the the image of the leper who has this nerve disease and they don't re and what what what what a gift it is to be able to feel and sense pain because pain protects us from what we how we could be hurting ourselves much much more and this desensitized church this this condition gradually built up and they didn't realize how what they were getting into that brought so much pleased to their flesh was actually harming them and uh um you'll see that um brother Gideon was talking about how he was blessed this last night in his night shift with good patience not all patients are good from what I hear from my doctor family and um the lysan church is not really a good patient there uh the doctor comes and they know what they think they need it's kind of like you go to the doctor say doctor these are the medicines I'm will take you tell me what I have that this will work with but when we go to the doctor when we go to God we need to be willing to listen to what God's diagnosis is because here you've got in Revelation 3:17 I'm seeing to Dueling diagnosis I'm busy I'm busy I'm busy um I'm stressed God you give me something like Gideon said can you give me a pill to help me and you don't realize there might be a much deeper issue involved and God's diagnosis isn't just that you're busy God's diagnosis is you're wretched miserable poor blind naked and that's not a message that any of us want to hear much less is allowed to say in church so this evening I want to start on just looking at what God's diagnosis of this church was because like brother brandham says what God saw was entirely different from what they said they saw they see the glittering buildings they see the increasing numbers of everything and they their dat it looks like their church is growing but God doesn't count his church he weighs his church he's looking for quality not quantity they thought they were rich in goods and spiritually healthy that they had arrived that they needed nothing but God saw it otherwise amen I just want to take a few minutes this evening and go over some of these uh really negative adjectives God is not using very um woke language he's using somewhat offensive language he's not making anybody feel good with his diagnosis but a good mechanic a good doctor isn't into making you feel good he's into making you be good he's making he's willing to tell you hey your car is rotten you need some serious work done that's what you want to have told to you if that's what the case is and God's going to tell them some tough things the first thing that God says to him is you you don't realize it but you're in a wretched condition you've been able to cover it up with all kinds of things but you find yourself in a wretched condition and on page 396 of the church age book brother brandom said it's it points to the irony in this age of Plenty and opportunity suddenly we find mental illness taking such such a toll as to alarm the nation and um some of the things that I mean chickens are gradually coming home to to roost because in the in the 60s and 70s have the sexual Revolution you have feminism you should be able to do live your life however you want to don't get married just just just live your life as you want to and now one of the results of this you have the United Kingdom have the United States they have a a minister for loneliness because people wanted to live their life as they wanted to live in their young years and then you get older and you're you're alone and you got all these all these health problems because of it well it's because you were you you were choosing a selfish way for a really long time it's not easy raising kids and then you did what you wanted to do for many many years and now you're just lonely but uh they've got everybody ought here here in the world today everybody ought to be happy the United States we have we're this is we've got a lot of blessing here and I remember going when I was at College I'd go into the uh going to the cafeteria I was thrilled it was already food was made for me it was paid for I just got and people are walking around like there's nothing to eat I'm not going to eat this there's we're we're we're blessed but in this place still millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol all these things when we're so blessed yeah we're having but there's something inside there's a voice that you that that cannot be drowned out there's a hunger that cannot be satisfied with any other thing if the devil wants to distract you from that we'll talk more about that late later it's a it's it's it's it's a wretched condition that they find themselves in this age at the bottom of page one they boast themselves of tremend mendous stores of worldly Goods but people are less happy than ever after Christmas everybody's got the things on their Christmas list and my kids are already updating their Amazon list we just got all things that way was on there then you're were already it's like what are Lord help us my goodness um sorry job but uh um bottom of page two without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear the world is so dark in this age could well be called the age of neurotic that it boasts but it can't back it up and you notice it's you got the you have the you have the bully there in the school he all the boasting when somebody finally calls his boast then he backs down and he realizes he he he doesn't have the goods and that's what you find this age also having we we make all kinds of boasts we think we can live this live that but when if you if you don't have the Lord you really can't do half what you think you can you need that on the inside like the um the Old Testament talks about we have peace peace but there is no peace that's what all the worldly philosophies promise they promise all kinds of wonderful things but there is no peace there in the end and the church is not just wretched they're they're miserable brother bam says that means that they objects to be pitied they're they're full of Pride um they they've built upon quicksand rather than upon the rock of for the revelation of God's word we know soon cometh the earthquake he say pity of the poor people who are in this last day ecumenical move and call it the move of God when it's actually the move of Satan and it's pitiable because they've got their the hopes are so high expectation is so high and then in the end a minister fails or something else fails and there's not the enduring power and the keeping power I was telling brother Paul earlier this this uh week I read in the uh news and the the BBC was been following a particular uh big Healing Ministry in Africa and I can remember when a brother left the message some years ago we were saying yeah you've got brother Brandon has got signs and wonders but there are many better even greater signs and wonders being done by this particular healer in Africa and he he traded the one for the other and the News came out this big healer in Africa he was been committing all kinds of uh um sexual abuse and things like that and I thought man the more that the longer time passes the more extraordinary the prophet actually becomes because he had so many signs and wonders and yet by God's grace he kept his feet on the ground he was humble he lived a clean life that's extraordinary and you can and but you've got this this worldly Church part of The ecumenical move and they they set their heights and all these other things and this is a disappointment when it happens here but it's even greater dis point when you get to the other side and think ah Lord Lord I've all these great things but the Lord says I never knew you and that is a that is a pitiable disappointment and it can be difficult even when when people can come into sometimes would be perfect storms created in in in in our lives where we can have difficult circumstances and then maybe we're dissatisfied with something in the church or something in the message and then because we we just feel like there's really no good place to turn anywhere and that's where we really just have to be watching our our um like a pil watches his dashboard his instrument so you just stay flying straight straight just fly by the instruments because those perfect storms can come up and you can think man these other big churches they've got the great worship team they've got the great charismatic uh gifts being poured out and they've got huge amounts of people coming they they care about the community the community is receiving something from them you can man how does that compare with my church and when you when that perfect storm gifts created man I need I need to try going somewhere else because maybe I didn't have everything I thought I had and I think brother Brandon he makes a point here pity them don't envy them because it can look um Fool's Gold can glitter they can look so wonderful but he calls us back back to the old store buildings back to the dimly lit rooms back to the cellers back to less of the world and more of God and that's what we need we don't want to become so polished that there's no room to just have a have have have a have a have a just a great repentance there at the altar who cares what people think let's just let's just keep it simple have God move because that's what it's about and God's blessed us with with with with a great building but that's not the point we come here just it's wonderful we can host all kinds of things but the point is that God can move in here and he can move in our hearts and that's what what we want cuz if it's if it's all all about the buildings earthquake will destroy the building it'll burn up and there's nothing left over but if it's about the heart that'll abide forever and that's what we're here for poor now of course brother bam says this means spiritually poor because one thing the the worldly church is not is it is not financially poor they've got business managers they've got all kinds of things but he says this is the spiritually poor and I just I I just was really blessed going through these adjectives going through the church age book but there been writs a lot in there I just tried to clip out some highlights but there's more in the notes the sign of this age as it Clos it is bigger and better churches more and more people with more and more manifestation of what's supposed to be demonstration of the Holy Ghost and you can find some huge churches you can find with with lots of people they think man what are we doing wrong we're not doing anything wrong but don't get distracted by what's going on outside he says the filled altars the gifts of the Spirit in operation remarkable attendance is not the answer from God for those who come to the altars very seldom say to go on with God it's changed lives that lasts and it's not just putting your name on a role becoming part of a small group Bible say but you're actually being trans transformed you your family from the inside out and it it's so important uh to catch the vision for the time that we're living in to see that hey the Revival swept the land in 1956 they're in there're in those those revivals back and forth and we still pray that God will continue to move but our expectation isn't for this big work of God so when we see that kind of thing happening we don't think oh yeah that's what I want to be part of we we know we that time has come we pray for them to work in our hearts we pray for them to work locally but we have it helps us to have discernment that's why God gives us the message so that we can we can capitalize on it and we can see what the characteristic of the True Vine are what the characteristics of the false Vine are so that we won't be easily so LED astray and envious why why can't we have a a huge Outreach everybody just pours in um it's easy to have everybody pour in when you say come to the altar just as you are and leave just as you were but when there's change involved that's a much higher expectation so these people continuing on here with that dot dot dot um where all those who came down the aisle they might have heard a man listened to an appeal they came into the net but they were not fish and he says Turtle like they crawled back to their own Waters so yes when you when when when when you throw the gospel net they can get all Jesus tells us in the Matthew 13 The Parables of the Kingdom you can get all kinds of creatures coming in the net and at the end when you get back to shore you you you throw the Turtles out you throw the crawdads out and you keep the fish so it's not just what the heavy net you what's in the net and he also quotes then about um in the last days um many will come to the Lord the Judgment say didn't we do many wonderful works in your name even to the casting out devils and Jesus says um depart from you that work iniquity I never knew you you that work iniquity that's that th those are strong words he called them workers of iniquity yet you can get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation prophecy coming forth in all manner of the Supernatural and people will gather around him and saries of the Lord even though he's actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin and that's what you often see and it's just it's remarkable um in brother Brandon's Ministry you didn't have that because when you have your Ministries being blessed and then people's tendency is going to be to put you on a pedestal that is a that can be a a trap and many fall into that um and that's what we just read in the news about but um the only answer they have is the absolutely unbiblical answer well he gets results so he must be of God that's not it it's not the man you have to take it back to the word this sounds so good oh he gets results look at what's what what what what at what's happening but how actually poor this age is in the spirit of God and the poor poverty-stricken ones don't even know it that's what Revelation 3 says and knoweth it not because you seem it you have all kinds of seeming manifestation seeming results but how much of it well actually the Apostle Paul I think in first 2 Corinthians talks about the um the foundation that is solid what you build upon that Foundation wood Hast double that'll be burned up what are you going to build upon the foundation and what we want to be make sure we're building things on our that Foundation of Grace that's going to stand the test then the last characteristic these offensive terms that God uses here to to to wake us up he says you're blind and naked and uh he talks about how these who are are they who have become blind because they've refused the word of God they've stripped themselves naked by leaving God's care and protection they seek to build their own way of Salvation and that is how it's been since the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve when they fell onto sin the first thing they did they realized they were naked and they got fig leaves they thought they were covered but God's message was to them you're still naked they were covered with fig leaves and God said who told you you're naked we're not naked we're covered you're you're not covered if it's your own righteousness that covers you and every single man-made religion is always going to be giving us a covering by our own righteousness and it's always going to be a case of The Emperor's New Clothes we're so impressed with how how how good it looks but it covers nothing and um talking about about nakedness this is the same experience that the children of Israel had there by Mount Si when Moses came off the mountain and the people Aaron had built this golden calf and the people were were partying around the calf and Moses saw the people that they were naked and the Bible says Aaron had made made them naked under their shame among their enemies how did he make them naked he wasn't going out there stripping off their clothes but he removed God's word from them they had the just like the last sentence said they left God's care and protection they're building their own way of Salvation when you leave God's care and protection you're you're you're leaving your garments behind and you are naked and it's not just naked as far as immodest but you're also exposed to the element there's nothing to protect you all of that is there is there included and uh he says oh how lovely and beautiful dressed they can appear in their own eyes as they form their General assemblies their councils Etc but now God is stripping it all away and they're naked he's revealing the nakedness for these organizations have but led them into the camp of antichrist and the field of tears right up to their binding and burning and he repeats again objects of pity indeed they are pity them warn them beseech them and still they can go their way headlong into destruction but um we've got the we've got the diagnosis and it's not a good diagnosis and it's even worse when You' got a patient who's not willing to hear it but the doctor has the responsibility I've got to tell them he tells then the doctor goes on and he gives a um he gives a prescription and we take a few minutes and looking at what God's prescription was in verses 18 and 19 we notice he doesn't go and give them a list of things to do he doesn't hand them a book of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Christians he doesn't do that what he we just read it I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that th mayest be rich and I suggest that these are the the the these what what he suggesting that they acquire or buy we look at them as as as symbols because they have enough gold what is the gold that God's talking about here and also buy of me white rment that you may be clothed that the shame of your nakedness not appear and anoint your eyes with iav that you may see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent and I want to look the way I was looking at this last night verses 18 and 19 they work really really really well together Verse 18 is basically a picture or an illustration that's a little more lengthy verse 19 gives it short sweeten to the point you need to repent that's verse 19 Verse 18 shows us what repentance actually looks like what does repentance actually include it breaks it down really really well first off God's prescription he says buy of me for the loudan church if somebody comes to them needing help they will give them sign them up for this program that program give them all kinds of things to do but God tells him come to me by of me he points us to himself and that is that's the most I thought that was really uh really noteworthy brother Brandon pointed that out he directs this last day Church to one hope and that hope is himself he says come to me and by and it's evident he says from this phrase by of me that the laian church is not at all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God their transactions cannot be spiritual they've been doing all these kinds of things but they've been not been dealing with Christ because now he's saying come back to me and buy they've been doing all kinds of things this at the top of page four but if they've been if they've been dealing with Christ we've already gotten this but they're not because this the loudan church isn't Christ's Church anymore all the way back in the paman church this says Satan sits enthroned upon the church and it it's his church and Christ has finally been pushed outside the church so when they're busy and this is the greatest deception it's like Satan has hacked the church he's hacked everything about it they think they're accessing Christ they think they're getting something from Christ but it's the greatest deception because he is outside the church and they're so busy he's turning the music up so I getting doing so many things they can't even hear the knock knock knock and even if they could hear they couldn't hear the voice because Satan doesn't want you to buy of him because really all Christ says come to me my yoke is easy my burden is light and you'll find true rest to your souls there transactions cannot have been spiritual you may think they're spiritual but how can they be the works in their midst are definitely not as Paul would say God in you willing and doing of his good pleasure so what about all these churches schools hospitals missionary Ventures Etc God's not in them as long as they're denominational seed and spirit and not the seed and spirit of God they can be doing all kinds of really good humanitarian things and it's that that those can be great things to do but don't deceive somebody to thinking that they're also getting saved because those are two different things the gold of God brother Bram says the gold of God is Christlike character produced in the furnace of Affliction brother brand says these people had plenty of gold it was the wrong kind it was that gold that bought men's lives and destroy them it was the gold that warped and twisted human character for its love was the root root of all evil the gift of the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the furnace of Affliction this age is designed to get us to avoid Affliction does not want us to have any kind of Affliction at all this morning in Bible class we're going over Paul's missionary journey uh to Philippi and you know at the beginning of the day Paul might have prayed like many of us will pray in the mornings Lord please bless this stay and help it to be a good day in Jesus name amen that seems like a really good prayer but God's idea of a good day and your idea of a good day could be very very different when we say Lord please help me have a good day we're really probably meaning a painfree day that's what we're asking for that is not necessarily God's will for us because 1 Thessalonians 4 says that God's will is our sanctification that's God God's will that's what God probably cares about definitely he cares more about our sanctification than us getting a particular kind of car particular kind of house particular kind of job we pray about those things but we should also be praying about Lord help me to grow in sanctification more in your christlikeness so Paul had been praying for weeks Lord where would you have me to preach where would you have me to go and he tries to go up into Bia and de Asia and missia and everywhere that says the Holy Ghost suffered him not to go there yeah I think man if anybody's being led by the spirit of God it's Paul what does walking in God's will look like and sometimes I showed the kids you guys maybe seen the the famous statue of The Thinker like this right and if Paul had been like The Thinker he wouldn't have gone anywhere until he knew exactly where God wanted him to go and I thought when we're analysis paralysis or sometimes we could say praying for God's will paralysis until I know exactly what God's perfect will is I will go nowhere God if Paul had thought that way he would never have made it out of Antioch because Paul has you brother Stephen you told me a long time ago God can't steer a stationary ship the rudder only works the ship's moving once Paul starts moving God can I had the kid get up and Gideon get up just a minute if you're willing to start taking steps just take some steps it's easy to turn you one way to the other if you're taking steps but if you I'm not going to go anywhere brother rap until I know exactly what God wants me to do and he just stands and I have to really push P until I know ex you don't know where I'm pushing you yet so I'm not going to go anywhere until I know exactly where I'm supposed to go I'm going to push push push I really have to push you to know what God's will is that's we don't want to have that kind of relationship with our with our prayer life thank you but Paul did not have a good day in Philippi yeah yes there was Deliverance from demons but then there was a Deliverance of a Jailer but I thought man I tried to avoid jailers I try to avoid policemen Paul did not have a good experience with the with with the Jailer he got whipped he got beat it was not a painfree day but it was a good day in God's eyes why does God treat this missionary like that God could have done this much more easily because when God gives us a good day it's not a pain for day Lord please bless tomorrow is uh but he doesn't give us a painfree day but he's building something inside of us and the devil wants to do everything he can to alleviate the pain alleviate the Affliction but that is not how God works take a look at First Peter chapter 1 and this is not in the slides 1 Peter chapter 1 want to notice a couple words that go together Hebrews James 1 Peter one in verse uh um verse uh verse five we are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaveness through manifold Temptations if need be so if we're in heaviness through manifold Temptations It's because God determined that there was need God doesn't waste those things that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ trial is paired with glory honor and praise verse 11 searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before him the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow sufferings and Glory are inseparably linked Romans 88:18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and the sufferings is that's one of those words on Satan's TV station that get censored out he's preaching about suffering no we don't we don't hear that because that's what that that is what this that's what this age is wretched because they have everything else to cover up the sufferings to cover up the Affliction so we don't feel it so we feel better about it but inside it's not being dealt with and it's still there which is why they go from one thing to another thing to another thing Hebrews chapter chap 2 and verses 9 and 10 but we see Jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bring many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings if that was the way our Lord had to walk we can walk that way too and we look at the promise that's given to the bride allow to see and age they will sit with him in that Throne they'll walk a path similar to his path to get there you can't have that Glory without the sufferings that are connected with it so Satan does everything everything he can to keep us from the Affliction and when we're in Affliction he does everything he can to prevent us from understanding and valuing its purpose if we're in a trial we try to get out of that trial as fast as we can but really when we're in a trial we have we need to realize we are in God's hands and we just want to stay there for as long as it takes I remember one time I was thinking in James chapter one talks about let patience have its perfect work that you may be holy and entire wanting nothing nothing I can just remember the image that God gave me was somebody in open heart surgery on the operating table and he's tired of the surgery he wants to jump off before the doctor's done with him that's us we're trying to jump out of our trials before God's done with us we want God to he will complete the surgery he will take care of us take care of us through the trial as we will be accomplished in the trial we will just wait and have that patience on him amen it's not fun but the glory is great it's worth it next part of the prescription is by white rment that we might be clothed and that white rment we'll find that is the righteousness of um the Saints if we look over in Revelation 197 and 8 this is looking forward to the bride of Christ and the marriage of the Lamb verse 8 says and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and we don't have our own righteousness Philippians 3:9 says we want to be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that righteousness which is of the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith so here we when we repent we're done with our own works we put all the and the lean church is characterized by their own works I know your Works they're gloring in their own works but a true Christian doesn't glory in our own works we glory in Christ's work and that's one thing this talking Church talks nothing about they're not talking about Christ's work but that is all that we can sing about because we haven't we don't have our own righteousness we don't want our own righteousness our best days our best acts are like trying to clean a dish with a dirty dish rag our our righteousnesses are as filthy rags Romans chapter 4 talking about Abraham to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt the Lan church was working a lot but we've got such a huge we we talked at youth hisory about credit we've got such a huge debt and Satan charges lots of Interest we can work as hard as we can but we will never pay that off the only way to get it paid off is to have faith and and our millionaire God billionaire God who can settle all those accounts one perfectly thank you Lord but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness the Lan church was not acknowledged for their faith but for their works and works leads to debt we want to have the Faith of Christ in the in in the church age book brother Brandon says about those those white garments there is a price to to pay for those garments and that is the price of Separation in order to because we have to buy of him where is he he's on the other side of the church door because he's been kicked out so if we have to buy of him we have to be willing to separate from this group that we're with we have to be willing to go to him and put our trust in him and be hey Lord I've done all kinds of things I thought I was doing good but I don't want my I see this is this is terrible these great things I thought were so super it's terrible would you can I trade them with you Lord I will give you all of mine and you can give me yours that's what that's what repentance is about and uh uh Paul talks about you can't be unequally yolked together with unbelievers in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 what Concord Christ with bile what parth the believer with an Infidel and this is where he says and for 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 17 uh verse 16 the top of page five what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them I will be their God they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate say the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you there is a price for these garment it's the price of Separation we have to leave this established Lan church and go to where Christ is then lastly he says anoint your eyes with isav that you may see because otherwise you can't see right you can think you see but you are not seeing what is true and brother Brandon points out he does not say you have to buy this isaf no because there's no price tag on the Holy Spirit but without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open opened to a true spiritual revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to God and His truth and one comparison I have is H you can try to work on the jigsaw puzzle but if you don't have the the picture you can try as hard as you can to put these pieces together and you'll achieve some limited success by grouping colors together you'll be able to put some just by hard study and hard work but when you have that picture that Revelation from God what it's supposed to be like and then then it can come together but without that you can be working and working and working and you can be really proud of the few pieces you've put together when you've got the picture wow it's so much easier you know there have been brother brandom says you know there have been some awful cold drafts blowing on the church in this generation and I'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen shut and she's blind to what God's done for you he was talking about how up in the Log Cabin his his eyes be matted shut in the morning wife mom to get the grease to get them out to get to get them open back up again and the church needs some hot oil of the spirit of God to open her eyes unless she receives the spirit of God she will go on substituting program for power and Creed for word because the programs look great the special effects look great but that is no substitute for the power of God the Creeds can be very eloquent can seem to cover every single logical position possible but God is above all of that and we can't substitute Creed for word again God sent us he did not send us a theologian he didn't send us books with footnotes he sent us a prophet and we should be really thankful for that again without having our eyes Anointed with isav we'll count numbers for success rather than look for fruit all of this looking for true gold getting that white reignment anointing your eyes with isaf I I love the Sy symbolism because it enriches our our vision of what repentance is the next the next part of it is hey and some be zealous therefore and repent that's he's getting right down to it it's not easy to repent it takes some uh it takes the Holy Spirit to even help us to see that we there's something to be repented from because whatever we've grown up doing that is for us normal and normal is usually connected with being good why would I want to do something different this is normal but then when the gospel comes then oh wow this the way I've been seeing things isn't as good as I thought it was this is how as Sinners we grew up looking at the world and we think this is normal this is the way the world is this is how we see it and any attempt to to tell us the contrary yeah you've got it turn the wrong way you're looking at it the wrong way that's that's how we've always seen it but repentance has to do with being you're going One Direction and then you are being turned and going the other direction but there's also a lot of turning in us we need to be turned around and our whole mind gets turned around so that we can actually see things as they are that's because repentance turned to us around but there's a gradual turning around of the Holy Spirit working with us through the process of sanctification there's a Metamorphoses of our hearts and our minds that's a continuing work of the Holy Spirit when uh when Paul was he went from Philippi went down to thessalonica and he was not greeted with open arms after the first couple weeks uh one of his the one of the new Believers Jason had the magistrates pounding on his door because people were accusing him these are the people they believed that these guys they've turned turned our world upside down actually the gospel turns your world right side up cuz we didn't realize how we were looking at things everything was upside down the gospel comes and turns it right side up there we there we have that but the people battling diagnosis dueling diagnosis different vision of the world no that's wrong no this is right but we've got to be willing to listen and take a look at what repentance is is God is God is calling for repentance he says acts 3:19 reent ye therefore be turned around and be converted that change we're turning directions our our our Direction completely changes and we are also completely changed our sins get blotted out times of refreshing will come from the presence of the Lord and then um Revel sorry Romans chap 12 I besee you therefore Brethren by the mercies of your mind that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and this is something that we can do daily but there's also an act of repentance here we're presenting we're we're surrendering ourselves to God but I love verse two be not conformed to this world don't let the world push you into its mold but be be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind and this is a a metamorphosis that happens it doesn't happen right at the altar it starts there but then there's this sanctification where God is changing US changing us because our whole mental World our whole picture of the world has been wrong we don't re when we repent we don't realize how wrong we viewed the world there's so many things that we just kind of have hanging on because we think is normal but we're willing to lay everything down and say God tell me how to think tell me what it really means to look at the world the right side up because we have no idea repentance includes all of that it's not just the first step is turning around changing direction that can happen in an altar that can happen in your car wherever God's moving you but you you turn around change direction and you continually walk with him and you're being changed into His Image everything about your mind your heart your affections all these things are being gradually changed change it doesn't all happen at one moment some things remember brother Lonnie telling me it can be like this big meat cleaver that say one day I was smoking the next day I wasn't it was gone but there can be other things that hang on for a long time we battle battle battle and as we keep on renewing our mind with God's word those other tastes will gradually change and pass away amen when we look at this loud to say and age that's having this battle with the doctor disagreeing with everything that God's saying about them it doesn't look very hopeful for them it's a really a far cry from the Glorious church that we see described in Acts chapter 2 throughout the Book of Acts much much different um and really if you look at the Arc of the church ages it seems that Satan and the false Vine have really had their way it seems like that even after the Reformation Sardis and the great missionary age in Philadelphia like my it has to end like this it looks like Satan is able to to keep the upper hand up upper hand and squats the Revival it seems hopeless and here's where we have to point ourselves back to the attributes that God draws our attention to at the very very beginning in Revelation chapter 3 because we we've spoken throughout how the attributes that God emphasizes as he introduces himself that has significance for the age so draw attention to this kind as we kind of wind things down these things Seth the amen that's an attribute of God the faithful and true witness that's an attribute of God the beginning of the creation of God God is saying each one of these things for a purpose the amen God has the last word it looks like and this layan message that looks like the Satan's ending with the upper hand and God's church is just Broken and Spilled Out worthless but God has the last word he will he will win the argument the devil will not the devil won't have anything to say when God's done we can apply that to the church age with you can apply that also to our daily life and the trials that we Face we can it seems like the trial we're in is endless it's never going to get better we can get so down and discouraged God has the last word Satan never has the last word in our trials God is the amen Satan might try to inject himself into the story but God has the pen to finish the story and a lot can happen in one or two pages and God makes sure the story of your life your children's life that he will bring that to the end because God does not start something and leave it Half Baked being confident of this very thing he which hath begun a good work in you will be faithful and will to perform it to the day of Jesus Christ he's also faithful and true when Paul writes in Ephesians 5 about the about the bride of Christ who is uh who's without spot has no spot wrinkle any such thing Paul is describing but he's also speaking prophetically he's he's he's writing here in the book of in the time of the book of Acts to the Ephesian to to the Church of Ephesus but these words are prophetic over the ages there is going to be a bride of Christ she doesn't have spot or wrinkle or any such thing it's she's going to be there amen and Christ is faithful and true I said this I'll be faithful to perform it and you can connect this attribute of faithful and true here in Revelation 3 it comes up another time in Revelation chap 19 when it says he that is faithful and true is on this white horse and he's in righteousness he do judge and make war and the and the Bride Comes Down out of heaven with him and they defeat the enemies of Israel and they and they and they they come and defeat the Devil at the there at the Battle of Gog and Magog I I believe but this is that what God said it he is faithful and true he will perform it that's an attribute of God that we can take much much consolation from now and he's the beginning of the creation of God the beginning is always full of promise and again it appears Satan has successfully blocked out light and smothered Revival but God's word and God's nature removed that as a possibility he's the beginning of the creation of God which means he will not be alone there will be other sons and daughters of God who will come along because he is just the beginning a restoration is Promised uh let's go back to Revelation chapter 3 so verse uh 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent again behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh that means there's going to be an overcomer will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne when the church ages begin it's just like Jesus Christ he died on the cross he was resurrected and he says except a corn of wheat fall under the ground and and die it abides alone that's why I have to give my life if I don't I I would abide alone and the church goes to the same cycle there in the church ages that corn of wheat is planted in the Ephesian Church age and then gradually it dies it seems to die throughout the ages and that's the miracle of it Satan thinks if I can just kill it I'll win no he's actually contributing to the seed's success so he he tries to kill it the seed dies in the ground and then a little radical Sprouts forth the first little root goes out and gradually this is what starts at Ephesus and it seems like at the end of the church ages you've got something like the stump and you can look at it man you can ask can this tree live again is that even possible and this is what the Jew Jews would have thought after Malachi there were a few faithful Jews there in the days of Zacharias and Elizabeth and Mary and Joseph there were a few Faith ones who were looking for a redeemer and Messiah to come the other ones it' been pretty tough what Babylon had left Persia had eaten up what Persia had left the Greeks had eat up what the Greeks left the Romans ate up there wasn't much hope for a messiah anymore and people would be looking my that's the great promise that was left can this tree ever live again and what Joel spoke applied to them that which the palmerworm has left that's the Locust eaten with the Locust has left the cankerworm is eaten with the canorth left the caterpillar is eaten there's nothing left the forces of antichrist have laid my Vine waste barked my fig tree laid it clean bear cast it away the branches thereof are made white it looks hopeless that's how it would have looked and in that Century before Christ was born but there was a prophecy Isaiah 11 says there shall come forth a Shute from the stump of Jesse and it looked like a hopeless case but a shoot came out of that I never knew that could happen years back I was trying to clean up my backyard in Holland and I borrowed I got this chainsaw I I I took some brush out took it down to the stump man did good work and then spring came and I'm getting ready to bike to work I look back hold up everything is sprouting from these stumps I thought I took care of it no you can think it but there's still life there and that's when Just Awaken me the devil can think he's chopped us off there's nothing left but as long as there's still connection to that seed and to that root there's life there and there was a root that a chute that came from the stump of Jesse a branch from his roots that was Christ but the same cycle that happened with Christ happened to the the end of the church ages also because those Prophecies of Joel what the Palmer worth left the canker eaten what the canker room left at the Locust eeden that's is the the spirit of antichrist the horse riders going through trying to kill away kill away kill away they did that to the church Ag and it looked like it was so successful but the promise was I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker room with Eden this was fulfilled in the days of Jesus in the days of Peter it was also fulfilled bu at the day of Pentecost in 1906 when the Pentecostal blessing came down and he's been continuing to restore even the word to us because that's what was promised Matthew 17:11 says Eli Jesus says Elias truly shall first come and restore all things and he wasn't speaking of John the Baptist because John the Baptist was in no wise a restorer he was a preparer Jesus is speaking about the second fulfillment of Malachi 4 where it says I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he'll turn the heart of the fathers to the children that's what John the Baptist ministry was doing because the children of Israel were coming and were believing at Christ's feet and the fathers of Israel the Pharisees the Sadducees Saul was one of them Saul had his heart turned to see what the young Church of Church of Israel was was believing the Father's Heart was turned to the children through John the Baptist ministry to the to the disciples Ministry but at the end time the heart of the children will be turned back to the apostolic fathers and that is what we had an Elijah the prophet Ministry prophesied for in these last days and that is what the angel of the Church of laa does these and just look at the work of restoration that can be done the stump looks like a picture of hopelessness but there's a lot of Life there under that stump and this this this ministry of repentance first showing us what real repentance looks like that's what makes restoration possible because if a church is unwilling to repent if we as individuals are unwilling to repent how can we ever sit in Christ's Throne we can't we repent we follow the word of restoration the only way that we can sit in Christ throne with him is in like in verse 22 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth under the churches but if like this patient who's listening to the doctor with his fingers in his ears he's not hearing what the doctor is saying to him we have to have our ears open to what God is speaking to us so that we can have a heart to repent a heart to change so that our mind can be transformed because you know what the media today was constantly working to turn that map back around and without the spirit of God it's going to tend to go back back back back back before we realize it we'll be raising our hands in church on Sundays and thinking like heathens throughout the week we let be transformed continually by the renewing of your mind that is a continual process we can never say we've arrived continue to transform me amen and we have this promise of Overcomer because this is a restoration this is Paving the way for us to be restored back to the same Dominion that Adam and Eve had there in the Garden of Eden because we will have the same Authority as the as the King of Kings has sitting with him there in the throne and then I'm going to end with I want to read this last paragraph from the uh Church age book and then we'll be finished for this evening I think this is brother Brandon expresses really clearly what the purpose of his ministry is he says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my my church or start some fellowship an organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people because if you love God you love people too and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied what's that one thing that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word that's the one thing Lord may we have a true relationship a true spiritual not the true works relationship but a true spiritual relationship between with with the Lord he says I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart and it does Amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you very much for your goodness and your grace to us father and just as we spent last uh service and this one looking at the conditions of the church age that surrounds us father I'm even more thankful than ever before that there has been a message to call us outen thank you Lord for showing us so vividly what repentance looks like it can be so easy to get our eyes on the wrong things and and start valuing the gold that is hawked on Amazon the gold that's hawked at the stores and we want want those kinds of things but Lord I pray that you would help us to have that value even for the trials that you put into us we may have real gold Christlike character bought by bought in the furnace of Affliction Lord father I pray that you would encourage each one Lord I pray for those who are still sick at home father you would raise them up Lord I just pray that you would bless us even as these in these end times that can be so deceiving Lord I pray that you would help us to keep our ears open that we may hear what the spirit is continuing to say to the churches oh God draw Us close to you we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you amen thank you brother rap appreciate the teaching praise the lord well I just say Jesus help us amen and he has come and and as much as we rejoice in the at the end there the promise of restoration in an age so bad we rejoice in that because we're part of that too by God's grace we still take the rebuke you know it's such a strong rebuke to think that we're in a time that as brother rap said there are the last few words that we could be raising higher in chch in church on Sunday and living like in a heathen the rest of the week it's only in this age that Satan allows people and leads people to live that that way live like a heathen through the week and raise your hand worship on Sunday we don't want to be living that way and so I thought it was really neat he said this age is a real battle with the doctor it's a battle with the doctor because only doct Jesus can diagnose us perfectly and um it's I was it's kind of funny how people do go I was talking to my daughter this week about just the lack of trust sometimes and you know they call it a practice so they're practicing on you and so but people argue all times with the with the doctor and such but this is Dr Jesus and he's the only one qualified to diagnose this age and we might as well make it to the individual he's the only one qualified to diagnose your spiritual life you don't diagnose it yourself cuz if you do you're going to come out smelling like a rose but thank God for a doctor like a mechanic or a good mechanic or good they're going to tell you the truth going to tell you the truth I don't like a mechanic that is giving me stuff I need to do in my car that don't really need to be done but then he's hiding and other things as well I like to shoot I like them to shoot straight I like a doctor to shoot straight and Dr Jesus shoot shot straight with this leoan age he diagnosed it it was rough words it was straight words and they didn't want to hear it for the most part but I'd rather trust Dr Jesus diagnosis than my own or a denomination or my families I'd rather trust his diagnosis because in the end this doctor is going to help us get out and and uh so I wanted to say uh tonight we come to the end of this series and it's been such a joy to enjoy this study for the last year and a half I wanted brother rap to uh to to bring it out we can get some good videos of it because I know not only want it for the Believers here and whoever else you want to refer to it if they want to settle down and study you see the thing is is that the church ages we're we're at the end we're at the very end so now we're looking back to 2,000 years since Christianity began and you all have learned that right after Christianity began the Antichrist Spirit come in to to duplicate excuse Not Duplicate but to try to impersonate so so now at the end um those those who lived during those ages that were Believers were anointed to overcome that age they were given an anointing to overcome whatever the Antichrist Spirit was doing but they didn't know what was going on true you see they didn't really know the diagnosis they didn't really know they just had the anointing to overcome it and sometimes we're that way we don't really have all the answers but if we're the under the anointing we're going to overcome but the benefit of the last age with the seventh angel he will go back now and diagnose not just the seventh Church age but he'll look into all that say this is what was happening in Ephesians this is what was it we're really blessed cuz those Saints didn't get to see that but now at the end the seventh angel takes us through this process is this is what was happening Ephesus Mna pergamus for 2,000 years then he gets to the last one and so we're really blessed in this time under the seventh angel and under ministers and teachers like this to break this down but and so if you're interested if you're interested I wanted to have it you can get a church age book in the library I want to make this available eventually on YouTube that anybody that you witness to that it's a serious Bible studier of the last 2,000 years they can go to that and they can they can they can we can send them a church age book you can have

tonight and i' say praise the Lord we've got something because I believe and I'm not to build up I'm not building up brother rat but I do really appreciate because I think he's really broke this down uh very well uh through the gift that God has given him and it's very easy to understand and very uh much in line with what the seventh angel brought us and so it's very good and it's completed tonight um and so we appreciate it and we want to say thank you for the labors in the word the last year and a half of all the study hours that brother rap has gone through to do this thank you brother rap amen um he mentioned tonight he's been coming here seven years now and this church has benefited from uh his gift growing in this way um do you want to take the Seven Seals now and go through them we're talking about it um but you know uh he's grown so much in his gift and we have B the benefit here and also other places that's listening in uh and his family has grown his his in in the Lord and so it's been a good thing for us and it's a good thing for them so we thank the Lord for what he's done so I'll say it again we'll have this now if those who are listening in charge of the technical stuff let's get all these notes on the YouTube so that when you go to YouTube you can listen to brother rap you can take your church age book you've got the notes here that I've enjoyed going through each Wednesday that he preaches it but these are great notes with all the scriptures and uh also you have the Powerpoints on there as well so let's get that done as well so you got about four sources there as you study it the Powerpoints he's using and he had a lot of really good ones the notes and everything you could just really settle down and study it and go back over it again so I think that's good amen let's Stand Together get in to sing a few songs and I thank the Lord for his healing to the body of Christ there's many still recovering and coming back out of it but I think we're on the other end of this and uh so we appreciate you uh listening in tonight want to say happy birthday uh I don't think she's here I think she's listening in sister Jennifer jessa's birthday is

Brother Sam Browning's church I can't remember the time I think it's 4 or 5:00 and there's a flyer back there with the address and so that's a nice singing going on if you want to attend that and then he has brother Trevor enman Sunday morning and then Sunday afternoon is youth meeting there we encourage our young people if you're not doing anything to drive over I've hearing good things about Trevor enman brother Trevor enman really uh good Minister for the Youth so that is Sunday night at brother Sam's and then a singing Saturday brother Josiah will speak this Sunday uh for about the last probably 10 years uh precious Pastor up here brother John Martin has asked me to come a Sunday and to speak speak for them and so I think it's been 10 years he's asked for a or more than he's asked for a Sunday so I feel glad of the Lord to go and help that group and just in whatever way I can so this uh weekend brother Josiah will Minister here uh at home praise the Lord I think that's all the announcements let's continue to pray for one another and then Lord willing since we finish this series next Wednesday night we will be uh back in the back room by the fire Fireside midweek service and uh we'll have it synagogue style and gather and have our teaching back there for the winter Wednesday nights praise the Lord God is good amen come on brother Gideon and I'll just say a word of Prayer in closing and then he can sing a couple choruses and close the service tonight Heavenly Father Lord we are humbled to hear these things and we are blessed to live at the last age because now our eyes have been open to look back and see all the traps of the enemy all the the exposing the two Vines the false Church the true church both claiming Christ we're just so blessed that our eyes see this and Lord the result and fruit should be that we not live in this age in a lukewarm state that we' live through the week as as as a heathen and then try to be but we not live that way not be lukewarm not cold nor hot but Lord that we would ask you to just burn those holy fires within us and let us be on fire for you let be uh just passionate for you when we make a mistake that we quickly repent of it Lord repentance is the way out of Leo deia uh The Cry of the Bride is I'm wrong Lord you're right and we're wrong we humbly say we're wrong and you're right and may we find true repentance that's not just an exercise upon our lips but may we find it a change in our hearts that we this diagnosis we would not stay in this state of wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked but we could be redeemed and and Rise Above It Lord and be called one of those Overcomers to the leoan age and I think of the song that Sher wrote my sister Sher wrote that when we get on the other side someday and others gather around us who came from this age and they say are you she the Bride of the last days who stood such Temptation and such lukew Warmness and yet there was some Overcomers Lord I want to be one of them I want to be one of those that escaped this age help me give me more of the Holy Spirit give me more repentant heart give me a humble Heart Lord that I could be one of those that would be escaped of Israel that beautiful branch in the last days mold me into that father whatever you have to do mold me into it and tonight we learn Lord that our trials are the gold that we need to seek after not Riches of this life not to be a big church not to be a wellknown famous church not to seek for numbers but Lord the pouring out of your Holy Ghost upon the people salvation Holy Ghost Redemption Deliverance oh God come in our midst father come in our M pour your spirit through this place Lord May Hearts be convicted father for this is the very last hours of time we can't be leot Deans we must be Believers on fire for you I humbly ask Lord that you forgive me and that we would lift above the the spirit of this age we thank you Father May conviction always be a part of our hearts not condemnation but true conviction Lord we commit this series to you brother rap has brought and may I pray you'll Prosper it Lord Lord that it would go to many ears and many hearts unbelievers many people we wouldn't expect may it reach out Lord as brother rap was saying he was witnessing to people and directing up to the YouTube so they could go and listen to the church Lord may you reach out and use it to not just minister to us but many others who need to hear what you've done throughout the ages and that son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks reveal yourself to them Lord I pray and we thank you Father so much continue to heal the sickness in our body Lord so so many have been through it I pray you'll continue to bring restoration and
