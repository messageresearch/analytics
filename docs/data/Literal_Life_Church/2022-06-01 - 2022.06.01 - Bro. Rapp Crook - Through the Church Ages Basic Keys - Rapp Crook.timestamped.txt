[0:00] the most
[0:02] energetic of ministries and it can be
[0:04] difficult for a wednesday night to
[0:06] to endure but you're all hanging with us
[0:08] really well and i appreciate that
[0:12] let's start with revelation 2
[0:14] read through the first um
[0:17] uh the first seven verses this is the
[0:19] the message to the
[0:21] first uh first church verse one unto the
[0:23] angel of the church of ephesus right
[0:26] these things saith he that holdeth the
[0:28] seven stars in his right hand
[0:30] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[0:32] golden candlesticks
[0:34] i know thy works and thy labor and thy
[0:37] patience and how thou canst not bear
[0:40] them which are evil and thou hast tried
[0:42] them which say they are apostles and are
[0:44] not and that's found them liars and
[0:46] brother branham talks about this in the
[0:49] uh church age book he he talks about how
[0:51] this is a a church who's
[0:54] working in there and they're very
[0:55] diligent and to be different people
[0:57] coming along with different uh different
[0:59] teachings and they and they and they try
[1:01] them and compare them back to the word
[1:03] that paul preached what isn't true what
[1:04] is true and they and they're very
[1:06] serious what they accept
[1:08] verse three and s born this test
[1:10] patience and for my namesake has labored
[1:13] and has not fainted nevertheless i have
[1:16] somewhat against thee
[1:18] because now has left thy first love he
[1:20] talks about this being a church that's
[1:22] working and working working but working
[1:24] without love eventually
[1:26] and leads to backsliding he talks about
[1:28] that also at some point
[1:31] verse five remember therefore from
[1:33] whence thou were fallen and repent and
[1:35] do the first works or else i will come
[1:37] unto thee quickly and will remove thy
[1:39] candlestick out of his place
[1:41] except or unless thou repent
[1:44] but this thou hast that thou hatest the
[1:47] deed of the nicolaitans which i also
[1:49] hate
[1:50] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:51] the spirit says to the churches to him
[1:54] that overcometh who i give to eat of the
[1:56] tree of life which is in the midst of
[1:58] the paradise of god
[2:00] let's pray
[2:01] heavenly father we just thank you for
[2:02] your goodness and your grace to us lord
[2:04] i thank you for the
[2:05] for the word that you've given father
[2:08] through the through the message lord
[2:10] showing us what these things mean
[2:12] father eunice we're living in the
[2:14] shadows of your coming lord i pray
[2:15] father as brother branham
[2:17] prayed at the very first service of the
[2:20] revelation of jesus christ series may
[2:21] this not be a lecture but something that
[2:23] just draws us closer and closer to you
[2:25] lord that's our prayer tonight lord let
[2:27] us also pray again for the for the sea
[2:29] family lord you give them this be the
[2:31] god of all comfort to them i pray in
[2:33] jesus name amen god bless you may be
[2:36] seated
[2:39] so this evening i'm going to talk about
[2:42] some of the things where the brandon
[2:43] talks about the very beginning of the
[2:45] ephesian church agent that's just
[2:47] basic keys that unlocked his
[2:49] understanding
[2:51] that allowed him to
[2:52] how did he establish
[2:54] what the duration of each age was how
[2:56] did he establish who the church age
[2:58] messengers were
[3:00] how did how did those things come about
[3:03] and he and he's going to share a couple
[3:04] of keys
[3:06] that unlock that forum
[3:09] but first i want to talk about
[3:11] how how we can understand
[3:14] the seven churches themselves because
[3:17] there's there's different ways that uh
[3:19] the theologians look at these particular
[3:21] chapters revelation two and three um one
[3:24] way that many will look at it is that
[3:26] these were
[3:27] these were
[3:28] seven local churches in asia minor at
[3:31] the time which they were there and that
[3:34] these were letters met just for that
[3:36] time period with no bearing at all to
[3:39] anything in the future or to us today
[3:42] and i would
[3:43] and brother branham talks against that
[3:46] stamp i just want to draw a couple
[3:47] things that kind of back up scripturally
[3:50] why can we say you know this these these
[3:52] church these churches are not just local
[3:55] local
[3:56] congregations then but they're talking
[3:58] about seven
[3:59] different periods of church history
[4:02] up to the present that have certain
[4:04] conditions or characteristics that
[4:06] mirrored conditions in local assemblies
[4:09] at that time
[4:10] and first off we go back to revelation
[4:12] chapter one and i'm going to look at
[4:14] revelation chapter one um it's kind of
[4:16] giving the setting
[4:18] to chapters two and three that this
[4:20] patents vision does that well first off
[4:23] revelation 1 3
[4:25] says that blessed is he that readeth and
[4:27] they hear the words of this
[4:29] prophecy so revelation is a prophetic
[4:32] book sure it had application of the time
[4:34] period that john was in
[4:36] but it's it's mainly being written as a
[4:38] prophetic book for the first for the
[4:40] time to come and i thought it was
[4:42] interesting just kind of looking um
[4:45] today
[4:46] um
[4:47] back at the patentless vision we looked
[4:48] at two weeks ago and here's where where
[4:51] john he's in the spirit on the lord's
[4:53] day and remember he he turns around and
[4:56] then he sees behind him um this this
[4:59] this vision of these seven golden
[5:01] lampstands
[5:02] and these these lamp stands have had an
[5:05] important symbolism that each lampstand
[5:07] symbolized one of the churches and then
[5:10] christ is walking through the lampstands
[5:12] and he's holding seven stars in his hand
[5:14] and each of those seven stars are one of
[5:16] the angels to the seven churches and we
[5:19] saw how
[5:20] the lamp stand had such an important
[5:22] meaning because it was connected to oil
[5:24] and oil
[5:26] we looked at i think zechariah chapter
[5:28] four how the lampstand had its it was um
[5:31] it was it was uh zechariah four have a a
[5:34] lamp stand that is between two olive
[5:36] trees and it's drawing its oil from
[5:39] these from these olive trees so it's
[5:40] right from the source it'll be able to
[5:42] shine forever nothing can hinder this
[5:45] flow of oil
[5:46] and i just kind of thought if these
[5:48] seven churches are just seven local
[5:50] congregations in the first century
[5:53] the the eternality of the oil kind of
[5:56] loses its meaning
[5:58] because oil is supposed to go on forever
[6:00] and ever for all for all time it's not
[6:03] just this the seven congregations in the
[6:06] in the first century
[6:08] and you also see
[6:10] um
[6:12] in revelation chapter two verse four
[6:14] john's giving greetings are one verse
[6:16] four it says john to the seven churches
[6:18] which are in asia grace be unto you in
[6:20] peace
[6:21] from whom he says from him which is
[6:24] which was and which is to come
[6:27] and then even from and from the seven
[6:29] spirit which are before his throne from
[6:31] jesus christ and this with he which is
[6:33] which was which is to come
[6:35] all pertain to different aspects or
[6:38] offices of christ
[6:41] he which is what is christ's role right
[6:43] now he's an intercessor he's uh he's
[6:47] he's he's our he's our high priest
[6:50] well what was he well he was the son of
[6:52] man god and flesh um deuteronomy 18 15
[6:56] talks about him moses says there will
[6:57] come a prophet like unto me
[7:00] flesh man that god is going to be fully
[7:01] indwelling that is who it was and jesus
[7:04] is our high priest or intercessor and
[7:07] who's coming he's the king that's coming
[7:09] he'll be a judge that's coming and
[7:13] the patentless vision especially
[7:15] describes
[7:16] jesus's return as judge we looked at all
[7:19] those characteristics how he's he's got
[7:21] this white wig on he's got eyes flaming
[7:24] his fire he's got
[7:25] feet that are like like brass hot is hot
[7:29] burned in the furnace he's got a sword
[7:31] coming out of his mouth the sword of the
[7:32] word
[7:33] all these things are not really
[7:35] characteristics you would associate with
[7:37] an intercessor
[7:39] as someone coming to to make things
[7:41] right to to be the to be the judge
[7:44] prepare to to reign over things again
[7:46] and i would
[7:48] this is this is my take on it you can
[7:50] take what it's worth i kind of see
[7:52] revelation 2 and 3
[7:54] kind of starting the story of how does
[7:57] christ's role change from intercessor to
[8:00] judge
[8:00] because you can see all kinds of because
[8:02] revelation chapter 1 it talks about
[8:05] christ's coming he behold he cometh with
[8:07] clouds i think that's in verse and verse
[8:09] 7. so john's right here in the first
[8:12] century and he's seeing jesus coming
[8:14] with clouds and then everything in
[8:15] between is also going to be described
[8:18] there in the church ages these are
[8:20] conditions that are going to be
[8:22] prevailing in different churches
[8:25] and each of these characteristics that
[8:27] were in these churches foreshadowed the
[8:28] conditions
[8:30] of the church
[8:31] into the future kind of explaining how
[8:33] christ takes such a drastic change in
[8:35] role being a high priest to being a to
[8:38] being a judge
[8:40] and in romans 11 25 paul uses the phrase
[8:44] um how god will be dealing with
[8:47] dealing with the gentiles until the
[8:49] fullness of the gentiles become in and
[8:51] after that he turns to the jews well
[8:54] brother branham talks about at the
[8:55] bottom of page one how the seven ages in
[8:58] revelations two and three taken the
[9:00] whole span of time that is the fullness
[9:03] of the gentiles the whole time of the
[9:05] church ages that god is dealing with
[9:08] with the gentiles
[9:10] so i think it's a i think we definitely
[9:13] have scriptural basis for the brand
[9:15] underlines also that this is not just
[9:17] seven churches that are local
[9:18] congregations in asia minor but these
[9:21] are this is speaking prophetically about
[9:24] characteristics of the church
[9:26] in in ages to come
[9:30] and as you look i just kind of wanted to
[9:31] go through this
[9:33] as you might study that some yourselves
[9:35] are going through the church age book as
[9:37] we look at what we just read in chapter
[9:39] 2
[9:40] we can kind of break down the pattern
[9:43] that each message each church age is
[9:45] going to follow
[9:47] first off
[9:48] christ is going to be identifying
[9:50] himself with specific attributes and
[9:53] with every church age this is how he
[9:54] starts and he introduces himself
[9:57] in revelation 2 1 to the ephesian church
[9:59] i'm the one with the seven stars in the
[10:01] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[10:04] and
[10:05] and if you look at um like the the
[10:08] smyrna church age on page you've got a
[10:09] little table that's just kind of
[10:11] summarizing this he identifies himself
[10:13] i'm the first and the last the one who
[10:15] was dead and yet is alive and with the
[10:18] pergamian church age i'm i'm the one i
[10:20] am he with the sharp sword
[10:22] with with uh with two edges
[10:25] you can go on and look at each one of
[10:26] them
[10:27] but if you look at it i kind of think
[10:29] that you can see
[10:32] a core a connection between how he
[10:35] introduces himself the the attributes
[10:37] that he's highlighting
[10:39] and the trials
[10:41] that that age is going through
[10:43] because if you look at i think you see
[10:45] it well with smyrna smyrna is a
[10:46] persecuted church he tells him don't
[10:49] fear what you're going to suffer it'll
[10:50] be a tribulation of the last 10 days but
[10:52] be faithful unto death and you'll
[10:54] receive a crown of life
[10:56] well to this suffering persecuted church
[10:58] who does he identify himself as he
[11:00] identifies himself as the first and the
[11:02] last who was dead and yet is alive
[11:05] i am proof i made it through they
[11:08] couldn't kill me i was resurrected you
[11:10] have my life in you you'll be
[11:11] resurrected as well in the pergamian
[11:14] churches the age of false doctrine where
[11:16] the papacy is just starting to to rule
[11:19] and how does he identify himself as he
[11:21] identifies as i am he with the sharp
[11:23] sword with two edges that is the word of
[11:25] god
[11:26] so whenever we go through a particular
[11:28] trial
[11:30] we should look for what attributes of
[11:32] god do i need to be keying in on right
[11:34] here because that's how god is
[11:36] introducing himself to each of these
[11:37] church ages
[11:39] you need to know me in this way because
[11:42] you're going to be tested in this
[11:43] particular aspect
[11:45] as well
[11:47] it's interesting in the you know god
[11:49] starts the process off in ephesus and
[11:51] then in sardis
[11:52] um he does he starts doing a work of
[11:54] restoration in in
[11:56] there in the reformation
[11:58] well in in ephesus he identifies himself
[12:00] as the one with seven stars in the midst
[12:02] of the golden candlesticks and then
[12:04] sardis he identifies himself very
[12:06] similarly i'm the one who has the seven
[12:08] spirits of god and the seven stars he's
[12:10] he's starting this work of restoration
[12:13] of reformation there
[12:15] and then after he introduces himself
[12:17] um highlighting his own attributes that
[12:19] parallel their their needs
[12:22] he then is to be giving them kind of a
[12:24] report card
[12:25] kind of going through and like a teacher
[12:27] does giving comments at the end of the
[12:28] year i just had to do that and you
[12:31] always try to give a rose with every
[12:33] thorn
[12:34] and that's kind of what he does
[12:36] and with each with each church age
[12:38] he's he's showing uh he's throwing in
[12:40] the ephesian church he gives he's able
[12:42] to praise the ephesian church quite a
[12:44] bit they're they're working um
[12:47] they're laboring they've gotten their
[12:50] patient endurance they're not they're
[12:52] not going to put up with false doctrine
[12:53] they're going to put it away from them
[12:56] you've tried them to say they're
[12:57] apostles and they're false apostles and
[12:59] you've called them liars that which they
[13:01] are
[13:02] all these things he doesn't like the
[13:04] nicolaitans we'll talk about that later
[13:06] perhaps and he's complimenting them with
[13:09] every single as much as he can but he
[13:11] also says yes all these things are great
[13:13] but
[13:15] i've got one thing against you
[13:17] and that is
[13:18] you've left your first love
[13:20] and with each church as much as possible
[13:22] he highlights the things they're doing
[13:23] good and then brings a correction
[13:26] and i like the comment brother brandon
[13:28] makes on on this
[13:31] section the top of page two here he says
[13:33] how beautifully the savior praises and
[13:35] commends his children
[13:37] he takes full account of their fine
[13:39] spiritual attitudes and behavior he
[13:41] knows there's weakness among them
[13:44] but as yet he does not cry out against
[13:46] it isn't that just like the lord he
[13:48] knows how to encourage us in the right
[13:49] manners and discourage us in the wrong
[13:52] matters
[13:53] we could all learn a good lesson right
[13:55] here on running the church and our
[13:57] families
[13:58] how often is it how easy it is you just
[14:01] focus on what what what are kids doing
[14:03] wrong you're doing this wrong you're
[14:04] doing this wrong you're doing this wrong
[14:05] you know all this wrong i'm i'm fed up
[14:07] with it
[14:09] without taking the time to catch them
[14:10] doing good and they just
[14:13] just monopolize this make a moment of
[14:15] what they've done well and that's one
[14:17] that we can learn from
[14:18] um don't ever be discouraged
[14:21] saint of god for god is not ungracious
[14:23] to get
[14:24] your labors of love even the smallest
[14:26] thing even giving a cup of cold water to
[14:28] someone has reward and blessing from the
[14:30] lord
[14:31] so he starts off identifying who he is
[14:33] attributes are real important to their
[14:35] time of trial
[14:36] he goes through what they're doing well
[14:38] with him to work on and then he finally
[14:41] ends with a promise of reward to the
[14:43] overcomers it's really um inspiring to
[14:46] read
[14:47] the reward that's promised to each to
[14:49] each age and brother branham talks it's
[14:52] not just just that age but all of us are
[14:54] going to if we overcome we're heir of
[14:57] these things also so like the ephesian
[14:59] age they have the reward of being able
[15:01] to eat of the tree of life
[15:03] the smyrnan age won't be heard of the of
[15:05] the of the second death you can go on
[15:07] all the way down until finally the
[15:08] overcomers allowed to see an age we'll
[15:10] be able to sit with christ and his
[15:12] throne
[15:13] what a reward
[15:14] so it's nice to be able to see the kind
[15:16] of see that as you read what's being
[15:18] said in these verses and be able to
[15:20] place it
[15:21] in that way
[15:23] i want to take a look at the top of page
[15:25] three
[15:26] kind of starting off with the question
[15:28] how did brother branham come up with the
[15:30] dates for the ages the messengers and
[15:32] things like that
[15:34] and
[15:35] i kind of emphasize one thing he doesn't
[15:37] say he doesn't say i came up with all
[15:39] this myself
[15:41] he doesn't say that
[15:44] sometimes we can get that impression
[15:46] when it's taught that he came up with
[15:48] everything himself but he doesn't say
[15:50] that himself
[15:52] and it's one of the criticisms that
[15:53] people have of uh people who've left the
[15:55] message will have a criticism though
[15:57] brother the church's book's full of
[15:58] plagiarism he just copied it from this
[16:00] person that person
[16:02] um
[16:03] that's not the case i'm going to show a
[16:05] show a couple things about that
[16:07] he makes frequent references if you look
[16:09] in the in the revelation of jesus christ
[16:11] seriously drawing from commentaries from
[16:13] histories
[16:14] and someone who's plagiarizing doesn't
[16:16] do that
[16:18] now he's god did not send us a college
[16:19] professor he did not send us a
[16:21] theologian god sent us a
[16:23] a prophet who didn't know about
[16:26] how he should be citing sources things
[16:28] like that but he's telling us where he
[16:30] got things from and that and that we we
[16:32] should be happy with what god brought
[16:34] and what god sent us
[16:37] but the major part of brother brandon's
[16:39] ministry
[16:40] was
[16:41] tying together truths that had been lost
[16:44] throughout the ages
[16:45] so we don't need to disrespect or
[16:47] diminish his ministry when we say he
[16:49] didn't come up with everything himself
[16:51] because that wasn't all everything he
[16:53] was called to do
[16:55] and the message um is this a sign of the
[16:57] answers
[16:58] he says this is from middle quote on
[17:01] page three it says there's lots of truth
[17:03] out there
[17:05] um lots of truth lost out there why were
[17:07] others compromised on truth
[17:09] but this seventh angel doesn't
[17:11] compromise on anything he gathers up all
[17:13] the loose ends
[17:15] gathers them all up and that his
[17:17] sounding all the mystery of god
[17:20] should be finished
[17:22] and right above there he
[17:24] he talks about how somebody has come
[17:26] forth with a chart and draw everything
[17:28] out and somebody else comes forth with
[17:30] another
[17:31] thing and draws everything out all
[17:33] contrary to this one and somebody says
[17:34] well this is it or that's it coming back
[17:37] to this net that creates
[17:38] confusion
[17:40] and that's what he contacts with an
[17:42] uncertain sound and he says what we
[17:44] needed then is somebody to take the
[17:46] loose ends if this person has this right
[17:48] this person is this right this person is
[17:50] this right and saying this is what's
[17:52] truth and he says that's what this angel
[17:54] from revelation 10 7 is supposed to do
[17:56] take the mysteries them loose ends that
[17:59] people run out on
[18:01] so when we look at
[18:03] am i good
[18:07] very good
[18:11] all right very good
[18:13] so when we look at the things that um
[18:15] some of the things he says here we'll
[18:16] see he's he is drawing from lots of
[18:18] different uh um
[18:21] sources
[18:22] so first he says
[18:24] these are all quotes from the revelation
[18:25] of jesus christ series he says
[18:28] this is taken from the most outstanding
[18:30] historians
[18:31] that i know of the history of it all
[18:34] and then he talks about in the um and
[18:36] now with all the commentaries and so
[18:38] forth i could not have brought all the
[18:40] books to the platform i just wrote them
[18:43] down on the paper here and things like
[18:45] that
[18:46] and then he says i've been studying the
[18:48] histories to find out how long that
[18:50] church began how it pulled off and what
[18:53] taken place
[18:54] and then once again he says and every
[18:56] time when you see me referring to pages
[18:58] i have written here it's stuff i've
[18:59] taken from commentaries and so forth
[19:02] so he's not making a claim to
[19:04] originality i've got everything myself
[19:07] he's not saying that
[19:08] he's saying this but he does he does
[19:10] emphasize i went into prayer and before
[19:13] i ever picked up these other books i was
[19:15] i was praying seeking god and searched
[19:17] out from the scripture and then the
[19:20] holy spirit guided him what was correct
[19:22] here what was correct hear what was
[19:23] correct here and that's what we need a
[19:25] prophet to come along and say this is
[19:27] right there but that's not right
[19:29] these two go together to give us a
[19:31] correct picture but he's not saying i
[19:34] got everything myself
[19:36] and here we have this is um
[19:38] this is the way a lot of students would
[19:39] like to be able to cite their sources
[19:41] you know how to do this in your english
[19:42] papers but as you're ministering and
[19:44] that works just fine
[19:51] so the first um
[19:53] the first key as he's going through this
[19:57] is he talks about it being the keystone
[19:59] of the bible
[20:01] and the keystone is that that center
[20:03] stone of the arch
[20:04] it's a it's a wedge-shaped stone at the
[20:06] apex of a masonry arch
[20:09] and it bears all the ways you can get
[20:11] you can get the the one the one column
[20:14] going up the second column going up and
[20:16] you can see without that arch connecting
[20:18] the two without that keystone these
[20:20] these these pieces are just going to
[20:21] fall in
[20:22] but that keystone is exactly fit to bear
[20:25] the pressure from both sides fit exactly
[20:27] so it'll bear all the pressure
[20:29] distribute the weight going right down
[20:31] to the foundation of it because that is
[20:33] what this truth is is this this
[20:36] important key that god gave me
[20:38] um that's what
[20:40] it's like a keystone here and the basic
[20:42] key that god gave him to be able to
[20:44] figure out what are the correct dates
[20:46] who is the correct messenger
[20:48] the first three says that both god
[20:50] and his ways are unchanging that is the
[20:53] keystone of the bible
[20:56] and um
[20:57] it says here it is an unchanging god
[20:59] with unchanging ways what he did at the
[21:01] first you'll have to keep on doing until
[21:03] it's done the last time there will never
[21:06] be a change
[21:08] and the and the first quote on page four
[21:11] it says in order for you to fully
[21:13] understand the message of the church
[21:15] ages i'd like to explain the various
[21:17] principles that allowed me to arrive
[21:20] at the names of the messengers the
[21:22] length of the ages and other fractures
[21:24] involved therein
[21:26] since this study was to be the most
[21:27] serious one i had ever taken up to this
[21:29] time i sought god for many days for the
[21:31] inspiration of the holy spirit so this
[21:33] wasn't just study drawing from sources
[21:35] he seeks the inspiration of god
[21:38] then only did i read this scriptures in
[21:40] the church ages and delve into the many
[21:42] church histories written by the most
[21:44] unbiased historians i could find
[21:47] god didn't fail to answer my prayer
[21:49] while i read the word
[21:50] and the histories i was enabled by the
[21:52] holy spirit to see unfold of the pattern
[21:55] that runs the present through the
[21:57] centuries right into this present this
[21:59] last days that is the keystone of the
[22:01] bible the revelation that god never
[22:04] changes and his ways are unchangeable
[22:07] as
[22:08] he is
[22:09] and the part of that is how god started
[22:12] working at the church at pentecost
[22:14] that's the pattern that'll that that
[22:17] that that should go on into the future
[22:18] the church at pentecost sets the pattern
[22:22] so you can go back to the beginning see
[22:24] the first and perfect act of god and
[22:25] then judge by that standard that's how
[22:28] it's done so we could look and see uh
[22:30] which which men have gone in a
[22:32] particular age or how do they compare to
[22:34] what paul was teaching paul was the
[22:35] standard of the church age messengers
[22:37] not everybody they didn't have to copy
[22:38] him exactly but they would be
[22:39] approximating him in each church age
[22:42] that the proxy best approximates that uh
[22:45] that original age that is the original
[22:47] church the true church will always try
[22:49] to be like the original at pentecost
[22:52] the true church they will try to
[22:53] approximate that early first one
[22:56] and you have to work from the
[22:59] original that's that that's important
[23:02] the devil doesn't want us to do that by
[23:04] any means and it's interesting if you
[23:06] look at different commentaries on the
[23:08] book of acts
[23:10] i taught from the book of acts a couple
[23:11] years ago in my bible class in high
[23:14] school and
[23:15] there are a couple different errors that
[23:17] come up frequently when you look through
[23:19] the book when when you look through
[23:21] commentaries on the book of acts
[23:23] and the first one has to do
[23:27] with with the trinitarian baptism
[23:29] they're not going to do it the exact
[23:31] same way that it was done in the book of
[23:33] acts
[23:35] and but the clear the clear pattern is
[23:37] you should do an exam that you shouldn't
[23:39] leave the original pattern how god
[23:40] worked at the first church that's how it
[23:42] should be done all the way through
[23:44] all the way through and what you have
[23:46] then once you start changing
[23:48] the building structure of the arch you
[23:50] have what's called a a bald arch and you
[23:53] see this arch that keystone isn't
[23:55] exfitted exactly so the weight isn't
[23:57] being distributed just right all the way
[23:59] down to the columns and eventually
[24:01] that arch is going to collapse and fall
[24:03] because this little bit the design
[24:05] changes
[24:07] this past year in school of my geometry
[24:08] class we had the students make a um
[24:11] a popsicle stick um
[24:14] suspension bridge
[24:16] it was really kind of fun um but you
[24:18] were here we had the goal was try to get
[24:20] your bridge had to hold at least 40
[24:22] pounds and we were able to uh stack them
[24:24] up we were i had all my weights on the
[24:26] winning bridge it was over 100 pounds
[24:29] it was really really cool one of the
[24:31] bridges was almost like 80 pounds and
[24:33] one little popsicle stick snapped loose
[24:36] from the glue
[24:37] and we stopped right there because once
[24:39] one little stick breaks forth that
[24:41] changes the weight relationships for the
[24:43] entire bridge if we'd kept on going the
[24:46] whole thing would have snapped pretty
[24:47] fast
[24:48] so as you start changing just a little
[24:50] bit
[24:51] and you're teaching away from the
[24:53] original church that changes the
[24:55] distribution of everything in the system
[24:58] and it's going to lead to a collapse it
[25:00] might not happen right away
[25:02] but it's going to happen before too long
[25:04] and it's just interesting um it's very
[25:06] clear what peter preaches on the day of
[25:08] pentecost
[25:09] repent and be baptized in the name of
[25:10] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[25:13] and you shall receive the gift of the
[25:14] holy ghost
[25:16] every time there's baptism in the book
[25:18] of acts it's very clearly done in the
[25:20] name of the lord in the name of the lord
[25:22] jesus in the name of the lord jesus
[25:23] christ it's it's it's it's immersion
[25:26] you've got the the ethiopian eunuch he's
[25:28] he's traveling along
[25:30] on this long journey and i'm sure he
[25:32] would have had a bottle of water
[25:35] in his uh in his carriage somewhere and
[25:37] phillip saying wow
[25:39] yes okay i believe can i be baptized and
[25:43] he doesn't pick up the bottle of water
[25:45] could you sprinkle me he says no there
[25:47] is water can i go down into the water
[25:50] and be baptized it's not just a little
[25:53] sprinkling they're actually being
[25:54] immersed they're being their old life is
[25:56] being buried so they can be resurrected
[25:58] out into a new life symbolically
[26:01] but
[26:02] changes get made through the system
[26:04] because the devil doesn't want our arts
[26:06] to stand strong
[26:07] he wants to he wants to change the
[26:09] construction one way or the other so
[26:12] that keystone can be modified in one way
[26:15] or another
[26:16] so the trinitarian baptism that
[26:20] a lot of folks will look to matthew 28
[26:22] 19 and 20. the parallel scripture to
[26:25] that
[26:25] is um is luke 24.
[26:28] and matthew 28 19 and 20 that's where
[26:30] jesus says go ye therefore and teach all
[26:33] nations baptize them in the name of the
[26:34] father son of the holy ghost
[26:36] luke 24 says it's luke's telling the
[26:39] same story and luke says
[26:42] repentance and remission of sin should
[26:44] be preached in his name among all
[26:47] nations beginning at jerusalem
[26:50] well beginning at jerusalem how was that
[26:52] in jerusalem then because jerusalem will
[26:53] be the correct interpretation of this
[26:55] jerusalem we just said is
[26:57] peter says repent and be baptized in the
[26:59] name of the lord jesus christ that's the
[27:00] way they do it
[27:02] matthew who wrote matthew 28 19 and 20
[27:04] doesn't racing hey hold up hold up peter
[27:06] that's not what he said
[27:09] and if you watch the chosen matthew
[27:11] would certainly do that
[27:12] but he doesn't
[27:14] because
[27:15] peter had it right
[27:17] and if you i don't have these notes with
[27:19] me but um
[27:22] church historians have looked back and
[27:24] they made it looks like that matthew 28
[27:27] 19 text
[27:29] might be have might have been corrupted
[27:30] in some way because there was a church
[27:33] of the first church restorer in eusebius
[27:35] i believe he was in the second century
[27:37] and i've got i've got the copy of his
[27:39] his book on it he was
[27:40] from he was writing like the year 280 or
[27:42] something he quotes from matthew 28 19
[27:44] and 20.
[27:46] he quotes from it and he says
[27:49] be baptism in his name
[27:52] he doesn't say of the father can hold
[27:53] egos and he would have been using a
[27:55] scroll
[27:56] that was dated pretty early but anyway
[27:58] that's either here nor there the
[27:59] revelation of it is there's one name or
[28:01] no other name given under among under
[28:03] heaven whereby we must be saved
[28:07] another thing that denominations will
[28:09] often take a look at the looking at the
[28:10] early church and says all the
[28:12] supernatural things down the book of
[28:14] acts they were great in the book of acts
[28:16] it was to help this early church get
[28:18] started to be vindicated but gradually
[28:21] they just kind of got faded out
[28:23] and
[28:24] that's why we don't have
[28:26] and that and that was the intention
[28:28] that's a convenient uh interpretation of
[28:31] the if if the supernatural is gradually
[28:33] leaving your assembly or leaving your
[28:35] movement you come up with something to
[28:37] explain it and um and that's actually
[28:40] what i was reading another church
[28:41] history and he says
[28:44] i'll have to get the notes next time on
[28:45] that he says
[28:47] these things were gradually fading and
[28:49] they created the theory to explain why
[28:51] the supernatural what wasn't there but
[28:53] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[28:55] and forever the promise of the holy
[28:57] ghost was to them even that we're afar
[29:00] off even as many as as as the lord our
[29:02] god shall call
[29:04] that's that's what the promise is so the
[29:06] book of acts is not a transition the
[29:09] book of acts is showing what god is
[29:10] doing something new and this is the
[29:12] standard all the way all the way through
[29:15] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[29:17] forever
[29:18] and then the trinitarian might say so
[29:20] the redemption in the old testament was
[29:23] god the father providing way for the
[29:25] people to come to him by sacrifice and
[29:27] foreshadowing how god the son would die
[29:30] on the cross
[29:31] that would make the way finally for god
[29:33] the holy spirit to get in on
[29:36] the redemption story
[29:38] that's not the case at all though
[29:41] it's not that
[29:42] there isn't a trinity it's one god the
[29:44] whole time revealing himself and i love
[29:46] brother branham's comment as he talks
[29:48] about
[29:50] he reads from let me see
[29:52] here he reads from acts chapter one
[29:57] this is at the top of page five
[30:00] he reads from acts chapter one
[30:02] i pulled up here
[30:09] it says the former treatise have i made
[30:11] to be the book of luke o theophilus of
[30:14] all that jesus began both to do and
[30:16] teach all that jesus began both to do
[30:18] and teach and brother branham comments
[30:19] on there on the token
[30:23] it has to be because woman and her
[30:25] husband become one they become one so
[30:27] does the bride in christ become one the
[30:29] ministry of the bride and the minister
[30:30] of christ is the same and remember
[30:33] the former treatise oh theophilus have i
[30:35] written unto you that jesus began to do
[30:38] and continues to do that's how he
[30:41] that's his comment on that
[30:43] luke shows what jesus began to do
[30:46] act is what jesus is still continuing to
[30:48] do but it's jesus christ working through
[30:51] the whole time because the ministry of
[30:53] the bride and the groom are the same
[30:55] luke shows what the ministry of the
[30:57] groom was and the book of acts shows
[30:59] what the ministry of the bride is and
[31:01] they're the same because it's one spirit
[31:03] working through it all the whole time i
[31:05] just really like he says he returned
[31:07] again not a third person but the same
[31:09] person returned again in the form of the
[31:11] holy ghost to continue the work because
[31:13] in john chapter 14 jesus said don't
[31:16] worry
[31:16] i will come to you well how did jesus
[31:19] come to them he came to them in the form
[31:22] of the holy ghost that's why we said
[31:24] last time
[31:25] how paul is the whole the um the pillar
[31:28] of fire comes down on the road to
[31:29] damascus and paul look saul looks up at
[31:32] that pillar of fire and who does he see
[31:34] there he sees
[31:36] jesus
[31:37] and he says you've been you've you
[31:39] you've been persecuting me
[31:42] well paul hadn't touched jesus you saw
[31:44] hadn't touched jesus but the spirit of
[31:46] jesus was in all the believers and jesus
[31:49] identifies hey they are me
[31:52] you've been persecuting me when you
[31:54] persecute them because we are we are one
[31:58] amen
[31:59] so the the devil does everything that he
[32:02] can
[32:03] to
[32:04] affect the arch of our teaching the arch
[32:06] of our testimony of the arch of our
[32:08] lives
[32:09] so that he can bring decay onto certain
[32:11] crucial stones there are different ways
[32:13] that an arch like this can develop a
[32:16] bald arch
[32:18] one of them just be ground shifting
[32:20] and
[32:21] think about what is ground shifting when
[32:24] you talk about what are foundation
[32:25] principles what are foundational truths
[32:28] as you start changing the foundational
[32:30] truths that your whole system of faith
[32:32] is built upon that affects everything
[32:35] and eventually it will fall apart
[32:38] it can be because of
[32:40] weathering and talk about the trials of
[32:42] life
[32:43] how they can they have they have an
[32:45] impact upon your testimony and you can
[32:47] say oh you just you've experienced so
[32:48] many things you've been disappointed so
[32:50] many times by by so many people how can
[32:53] god still care for me how can god still
[32:56] love me and you can and if you're if
[32:58] you're not careful you can get you can
[32:59] get caught in the cycle of the blues
[33:01] and let go of certain important things
[33:04] and that just cause that can wear down
[33:06] at your arch and that can cause your a
[33:09] faith to collapse
[33:11] but um that that that is the devil's
[33:13] goal he cannot change he cannot
[33:15] challenge the lord himself
[33:18] but he just he tries to get our our
[33:20] confidence shaken and who and who god is
[33:25] so the the the first main important key
[33:28] that brother brahm talks about that
[33:30] helped him unlock um what god's doing
[33:33] throughout the scripture what god's
[33:34] doing throughout history what god's
[33:36] doing in the present day is that god
[33:38] never changes he never changes in who he
[33:41] is and how he works
[33:43] and that the and that the um the book of
[33:46] acts church that was the that was the
[33:48] pattern
[33:49] well the second basic key
[33:51] is that this is one that if you if you
[33:53] take the time to read through the church
[33:55] edge book it comes up again and again
[33:58] and again that there's that there's a
[33:59] true and false vine running throughout
[34:02] the scripture
[34:04] and he says
[34:06] out of this first key that we've
[34:08] received of the lord there comes another
[34:10] and slightly less wonderful truth
[34:13] there is a true church
[34:15] and a false church a true vine and a
[34:18] false line but of course that false
[34:20] church
[34:21] will always try to usurp the position
[34:24] of the true church how it was how it was
[34:26] in the book of acts
[34:28] that's how it's set forth in the seven
[34:30] ages that's how it is declared in the
[34:32] various epistles that's how it has been
[34:35] that's how it is now that's how it will
[34:37] be it can't change it's not going to
[34:40] change and this is important for us even
[34:42] today to realize for ourselves so we can
[34:44] understand
[34:45] why are things working the way they are
[34:47] in the world that we're in why do we
[34:49] have a hard time as believers
[34:51] being being recognized by other churches
[34:53] because that false spine doesn't want
[34:56] the true vine
[34:57] to get any light a day
[34:59] so we just we don't take it personally
[35:01] that's just the way things are because
[35:03] they didn't accept the established
[35:05] systems didn't accept jesus it's not
[35:07] going to accept his servants either
[35:08] that's just the ground rules of the game
[35:13] just like the the book of genesis is
[35:14] important understanding
[35:17] all of scripture because the things that
[35:18] began as a very small seed form in
[35:21] genesis continue throughout
[35:23] the rest of the bible and then just just
[35:26] get
[35:26] this get more significant and more
[35:28] significant as a as the seeds begins
[35:31] small and grows up big the ephesian
[35:34] church ages that way too things that
[35:35] will begin in very small innocent
[35:38] looking but just a little bit off
[35:40] they'll get
[35:42] more and more off as the
[35:44] as the time as as the ages go on
[35:47] as the basic error errors that crept
[35:50] into the first church were revealed in
[35:52] the book of acts and revelation and the
[35:53] epistles will become more and more
[35:55] visibly manifested and you'd subsequent
[35:58] age until we come to a complete blackout
[36:00] of truth
[36:01] in the loud to see an age
[36:04] maybe we can just look at an example of
[36:06] this
[36:07] in the book of acts chapter
[36:10] 8.
[36:11] i think it's kind of interesting to read
[36:12] the book of acts as um
[36:15] as the story of the first church age
[36:17] getting started never really thought
[36:18] about it that way
[36:20] but you you can definitely see it as
[36:22] that
[36:24] and we'll just see an example of these
[36:26] true and false vines growing up together
[36:29] and then see some examples of the
[36:31] characteristics of that uh false vine
[36:35] what brother branham talks about is
[36:37] nicolaitanism how
[36:40] that's a greek word made up of two words
[36:43] nico comes from the word of the same as
[36:45] the shu nike nikes do with victory
[36:48] overcoming and so if you have a nike
[36:51] shoe on it's the same
[36:53] first part of the word of nicolaitanism
[36:55] because you're overcoming something and
[36:58] what you're overcoming the laity and
[37:00] lady are the are the regular church
[37:02] members and
[37:04] the church might look at them as regular
[37:06] church members but god looks at them as
[37:08] my sheep
[37:10] and who is that overcoming and trying to
[37:12] subdue my sheep that's a big deal to god
[37:15] and we'll see some some really
[37:18] interesting characteristics how this
[37:19] plays out
[37:20] in acts chapter 8.
[37:23] and here we have a revival
[37:26] in samaria
[37:27] and we'll start at verse 5.
[37:31] then philip went down to the city of
[37:33] sumerian preached christ unto them
[37:36] and the people with one accord gave heat
[37:39] unto these things which philip spake
[37:41] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[37:43] did this is exactly what happened on the
[37:45] day of pentecost this is a continuation
[37:48] of that
[37:49] and then what happened
[37:50] unclean spirits crying with loud voice
[37:53] came out of many that were possessed
[37:54] with them many were taken with palsies
[37:56] and were lame and they were healed and
[37:58] there was great joy
[38:00] in that city
[38:01] an example of this revival revival is
[38:04] going to bring a deliverance from all
[38:06] kinds
[38:07] of oppression
[38:09] brother branham talks about this
[38:10] particular revival and
[38:13] in samaria philip is going to a place
[38:16] where a man named simon the sorcerer
[38:18] had been holding church and brother
[38:20] brahm talked about simon the sorcerer he
[38:22] had a church
[38:24] and it was a formal church perhaps a
[38:26] state church and he had them all bound
[38:29] down and they didn't have no joy they
[38:32] didn't have no power but when philip
[38:35] came down he preached to them christ
[38:37] resurrected great joy came and healing
[38:41] came
[38:42] and as he's preaching as philip's
[38:43] preaching uh
[38:46] they get baptized and you have a
[38:47] confirmation of a particular apostolic
[38:49] pattern here
[38:51] and then apostolic pattern
[38:54] is that
[38:55] once you believe
[38:57] then you're baptized verse 12 when they
[38:59] believed philip preaching the things
[39:01] censoring the kingdom of god in the name
[39:03] of jesus christ they were baptized both
[39:06] men and women so this is a great verse
[39:07] that shows why don't we baptize babies
[39:10] because babies can't believe you you
[39:13] baptize a believer in acts verse 16
[39:17] as yet the holy ghost wasn't fallen upon
[39:19] any of them only they were baptized in
[39:21] the name of the lord jesus how were they
[39:23] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[39:26] it wasn't the name of the father son
[39:27] holy ghost was the name of the lord
[39:28] jesus it's the only name given
[39:31] to be baptized or healed or whatever by
[39:33] and then after that
[39:35] after peter came down laid his hands
[39:37] upon them he had the keys to the kingdom
[39:40] he says look at what happened in
[39:42] jerusalem then preached in all judea
[39:44] then in samaria under the outermost
[39:46] parts of the earth god used peter in
[39:48] jerusalem to unlock the keys of the
[39:49] kingdom the kingdom is the holy ghost
[39:51] baptism does it throughout judea and
[39:53] finally samaria peter comes says the
[39:55] same thing and they're baptized with the
[39:58] holy spirit
[39:59] this is just the apostolic pattern here
[40:05] so that apostolic pattern is confirmed
[40:07] and finally they're delivered from this
[40:10] dictatorship of simon the sorcerer i
[40:13] just want to take a look at some
[40:14] characteristics
[40:16] of simon the sorcerer's
[40:18] teachings
[40:19] and let's take a look at verse at verse
[40:21] 9.
[40:25] why didn't they have great joy in the
[40:27] city before samaria came because verse 9
[40:29] says there was a certain man
[40:31] called simon
[40:33] which before time in the city used
[40:35] sorcery and bewitched the people of
[40:37] samaria giving out that himself
[40:39] was some great one
[40:42] and here's an important aspect i would
[40:44] say of an antichrist system
[40:46] it's going to hold the people in fear
[40:49] he's the great one he keeps control
[40:52] and this is the this is a characteristic
[40:54] of of nicolaitanism this is of this is
[40:57] not according to the true pattern that
[40:59] that that's laid out here this is this
[41:01] is the the false vine trying to grow up
[41:03] right as a true vine is right there
[41:05] beside it he's holding the people in
[41:07] fear
[41:09] verse 10 they all gave he to him from
[41:11] the least to the greatest saying this
[41:13] man is the great power of god they're
[41:15] just awed by him
[41:18] and if we if we're awed by the man of
[41:20] god
[41:21] more than god
[41:23] we've got our eyes on the wrong one
[41:26] we don't need to be
[41:27] we have we have a good respect for the
[41:29] lord's anointed but don't put the man of
[41:32] god above above god
[41:35] was as as as philip comes here and does
[41:38] this and
[41:39] and he's just
[41:40] he's just people are streaming out of
[41:42] simon the sorcerer's church because
[41:43] they've got something that's that's much
[41:45] better they're having joy and everything
[41:49] so after they believe and they're
[41:51] baptized in verse 12 verse 13 then simon
[41:53] himself then simon himself believed also
[41:57] he's willing to become part of this
[41:59] system of the this new faith why
[42:02] so he can get his people back that's the
[42:05] real reason that he's interested in
[42:06] being part of it
[42:07] um he can he and then he was even
[42:10] baptized and he continued with philip
[42:12] and wondered beholding the signs and the
[42:14] miracles that were done
[42:17] why is he doing this he just wants to
[42:19] keep close to his sheep so he continue
[42:21] fleecing them at some point in the
[42:23] future and then once peter comes he lays
[42:25] the hands his hands on the new believers
[42:27] and they receive the holy spirit and
[42:29] simon's like wow
[42:32] i could have that
[42:34] what kind of program could i build
[42:36] he wants the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:38] because he sees it as a
[42:41] business investment
[42:43] how does he intend to get the holy
[42:45] spirit
[42:46] verse 18 says when simon saw that
[42:48] through laying on of the apostles hands
[42:50] the holy ghost was given he offered them
[42:53] money
[42:54] i would love to buy this because with
[42:56] this little seed money i will be able to
[42:59] cash in on this
[43:01] big time
[43:02] and if you're he's going out of
[43:04] completely the wrong way but this is how
[43:06] false systems get started looking at the
[43:09] great man
[43:10] looking at how great he is he's the
[43:12] center of everything you have to have
[43:14] him pray for you have to send your money
[43:16] to him all these things it's the wrong
[43:18] thing it's a voice it's going right off
[43:20] the path and completely off the pattern
[43:23] but the book of acts as as the holy
[43:26] spirit plants the true seed right next
[43:28] to just a few chapters later the
[43:31] antichrist is already there because the
[43:33] true and the false wine
[43:34] are growing right together and
[43:37] thankfully there is the apostle peter
[43:38] right there to kind of be there to set
[43:40] things in order and that's what you see
[43:42] in the seals in revelation chapter 6 the
[43:45] the antichrist spirit goes out and the
[43:48] first spirit that goes against it the
[43:49] beast is a lion this apostolic anointing
[43:52] roaring against it that's what we see
[43:54] right here happening in revelation
[43:56] chapter 8.
[43:58] so simon
[43:59] he's wanting to he he sees this as a
[44:01] business investment he wants to uh to
[44:04] pay him for the holy spirit but peter
[44:05] says in verse 20
[44:07] thy money perish with thee because you
[44:10] have thought that the gift of god may be
[44:12] purchased with money
[44:14] you have no partner lot in this matter
[44:16] for your right is your heart is not
[44:18] right in the sight of god repent
[44:20] therefore
[44:21] and pray god if perhaps the thought of
[44:23] your heart may be forgiven thee
[44:27] simon doesn't do that
[44:29] simon might be one of the first people
[44:31] in the book of acts
[44:33] to pray to
[44:34] a man because he doesn't pray to god
[44:37] like peter says but verse 24 says then
[44:40] answered simon said pray you to the lord
[44:43] for me that none of these things will
[44:45] come to have spoken on me simon the
[44:47] sorcerer he see
[44:49] he the only religion that he knows is
[44:52] that some some man has become me and god
[44:54] that's how he's been teaching everybody
[44:56] now he sees another great man coming he
[44:59] sees peter as the next great man i've
[45:01] got to get him to pray for me to god i
[45:04] can get something he doesn't see you
[45:06] have a direct connection with god
[45:09] and that is the pattern that's laid down
[45:11] the book of acts or you receive the holy
[45:12] spirit yourself you have one mediator
[45:15] between god and man the man christ jesus
[45:17] there's there's a direct connection
[45:20] but as soon as the antichrist spirit
[45:21] gets in there
[45:23] it's there's something else there's
[45:25] always going to be something there's
[45:26] some level of interference that's going
[45:28] to fleece you of joy please you have
[45:30] peace flees you have your money all
[45:32] kinds of things because the devil wants
[45:34] his control there
[45:36] the first one to pray to a man and said
[45:38] of god so simon the sorcerer here at the
[45:40] very beginning of acts
[45:41] he's a picture of how antichrist systems
[45:44] work because there's a true vine and a
[45:47] false vine they're both planted about
[45:50] the same time
[45:51] and they're just growing up right around
[45:54] each other and you can see this from the
[45:56] book of genesis all the way through you
[45:58] can see this from the ephesian church
[46:00] age all the way through the other church
[46:02] ages because like brother branham said
[46:04] the basic errors that crept into the
[46:05] first church
[46:07] all that we saw with simon the sorcerer
[46:09] we we took the characteristic assignment
[46:11] of sorcerer's ministry we can erase
[46:13] simon the source of antichrist systems
[46:16] that's how it is that's how the false
[46:18] vine works
[46:19] just those basic areas of crept in there
[46:22] are just going to get magnified as the
[46:25] ages continue
[46:29] on the back of page six
[46:31] oh i think it's in first john four he
[46:34] says brethren says believe beloved
[46:36] believe not every spirit but try the
[46:38] spirits whether they're of god
[46:40] because many false prophets are gone out
[46:42] into the world and that's exactly
[46:45] what jesus christ commends the ephesian
[46:48] church age for
[46:50] he says you have tried them which say
[46:53] they are apostles and are not and has
[46:56] found them liars that's a very difficult
[46:59] process to have to go through
[47:01] but they they they did it because the
[47:03] truth was important enough
[47:06] it wasn't like hey what's true for you
[47:08] is true for you what's true for me is
[47:09] truth might just kind of part ways and
[47:11] be cool with each other
[47:12] they it was so important that they were
[47:14] they were going to have it out and
[47:15] establish what was really true
[47:20] top of page six you see characteristics
[47:22] of nicolaitanism
[47:24] the false line was getting a hold it was
[47:26] teaching that the rulership by man was
[47:29] right
[47:30] it taught that the church had to be
[47:31] governed it taught that control over the
[47:34] people but instead of doing it god's way
[47:36] they simply took authority
[47:38] invested
[47:39] all the spiritual power
[47:42] in their own hands and they came out
[47:43] with a holy priesthood standing between
[47:46] god and the people
[47:48] that's obliterating the whole new
[47:49] testament
[47:50] that's taking you taking a people back
[47:53] to the old testament was an aaronic
[47:54] priesthood that was what god wanted to
[47:57] grow out of and to where there's a where
[47:59] there's everybody that there's every
[48:01] believer is a priest before god
[48:04] they went back to the old aaronic system
[48:06] they became antichrist they disposed of
[48:09] his mediatorship
[48:11] and imposed their own god
[48:13] hated that
[48:15] the ephesians hated that and any true
[48:18] believer will hate it too and if you and
[48:19] if you've been through it yourself and
[48:21] you get any inkling i sense that spirit
[48:23] i work somewhere you run for the hills
[48:26] as fast as you can because you've been
[48:27] there done that got the t-shirt you
[48:29] don't want anything to do with it
[48:34] we'd have to be stone-blind not to see
[48:35] that same thing at work all through the
[48:37] ages and right now it's the worst of all
[48:40] what it was
[48:41] was organization that seemed so logical
[48:45] and now you've got businesses you've got
[48:47] churches have the ceo of online outreach
[48:50] a ceo of this because they're trying to
[48:52] grow their church
[48:53] using organizational man-made methods
[48:56] and you can have it so logical but
[48:57] that's not how god works
[49:00] at all
[49:03] they separated that that separated the
[49:05] people god's people are supposed to be
[49:07] won by one spirit are they all baptized
[49:10] into one body
[49:11] everyone is removed on by the holy ghost
[49:14] everyone is to participate in the
[49:15] worship of god
[49:16] but men wanted the primitives so they
[49:18] took over control
[49:20] i just really appreciate i don't have
[49:22] this quote um i have it's in my bible
[49:24] case you're left at home
[49:26] i think it's in the beginning of the
[49:27] message
[49:29] this a sign of the answer
[49:31] and brother brahms is making some
[49:32] introductory comments
[49:34] which i think are much more interesting
[49:37] than they sometimes
[49:38] led on to be
[49:40] he's just making some comments here
[49:42] about he's going to be in trying to be
[49:44] talking about six or seven different
[49:45] dreams and visions that the people have
[49:46] come to him with is i'm going to try to
[49:49] uh nope i've people have come to with
[49:51] dreams and visions you know i've some of
[49:52] them i haven't been able to interpret to
[49:54] you before
[49:55] he says at the beginning of his message
[49:57] i've not been able to interpret
[49:58] everything that you've brought to me if
[49:59] the lord gives the interpretation i give
[50:00] it to you but he doesn't always give it
[50:02] to me it says
[50:04] god doesn't work as a kind of an answer
[50:06] man where there's gonna be one great man
[50:07] that gives every single answer to you
[50:09] i've not tried to teach you that way i
[50:11] just thought that was so humble because
[50:13] we make brother brandon sometimes
[50:15] he has the answers to it all
[50:17] but he didn't make himself that
[50:20] and i just want to end with um
[50:23] with two statements that brother branham
[50:25] makes at the end of the ephesian church
[50:27] age and when when i read them the first
[50:29] time they just really struck me i think
[50:31] man he's saying this is really important
[50:33] so i really want to focus on this
[50:36] and
[50:37] he says don't ever forget these truths
[50:40] as we study the church jj's and later
[50:42] the seal whether those truths the first
[50:44] key that unlocks a lot of truth as you
[50:47] read through the bible is that god's
[50:48] unchanging his ways are unchanging
[50:51] that's key number one the second key was
[50:54] there is a true vine and a false line
[50:56] don't ever forget these truths
[50:59] don't ever forget these truths because
[51:01] that helps you understand what's going
[51:02] on
[51:03] through little bible stories as you go
[51:05] but it also helps you understand what's
[51:07] going on in your own life
[51:09] what's why are things why why why this
[51:12] particular area of my life not been
[51:13] blessed because maybe i'm not doing it
[51:15] according to god's original pattern
[51:17] maybe i'm off somewhere
[51:18] those are those are really important
[51:20] truths and don't and above all don't
[51:21] forget that's in this last age
[51:24] when the tares are getting bound if
[51:25] they're burning they will shove out the
[51:26] wheat that's regarded by the lord it
[51:28] says don't forget that especially in
[51:29] this last stage because you're gonna be
[51:31] going you'll be feeling the effects of
[51:32] this
[51:33] don't take it personal it's just what
[51:35] they did to him which christ they'll be
[51:36] doing to us too
[51:38] that's how it goes guys let's just keep
[51:40] on don't forget these truths
[51:42] and then he talks also about
[51:45] revivals
[51:46] as a revival signifies a move of god in
[51:49] power
[51:50] and every time god moves satan is there
[51:53] to move also we saw that in acts and
[51:55] during the book of acts in jerusalem god
[51:57] was moving then in samaria god was
[51:59] moving and then simon the source was
[52:01] right there moving along because
[52:03] whenever there's a revival
[52:06] satan's right there to move also and
[52:08] then it never fails i thought this next
[52:10] part was i hope and trust your spiritual
[52:13] mind enough to get that
[52:14] and capitalize on it
[52:17] if you're told to capitalize on
[52:18] something that means there's profit to
[52:20] be made there
[52:21] there's there's great truth to be
[52:23] garnered from this there's something
[52:24] here i don't have it all but man this is
[52:26] important because he said you get you
[52:28] keep this in your mind
[52:29] capitalize on it
[52:31] and one thing i just as i was thinking
[52:33] about this today
[52:34] the revival signifies a move of god in
[52:37] power and satan's will be right there
[52:39] and they can everybody's going to be
[52:40] moving and showing trying to get your
[52:42] eyes off what god's doing and what satan
[52:44] is doing right next to god
[52:47] because how do vines work it's not like
[52:49] the false binds over there and the true
[52:50] vines over here that's not how it works
[52:53] false and true vine are going to be
[52:54] coiled together
[52:56] so just because there's something false
[52:58] happening right next to what's true
[53:01] doesn't mean you have to leave what's
[53:02] true
[53:03] and that's what the devil tries to
[53:05] convince you to do but that's false
[53:08] that's why he says don't forget these
[53:10] truths
[53:11] capitalize on it because whatever's
[53:13] god's yes there might even you go to a
[53:15] special meeting somewhere something
[53:16] might be going off of one there but that
[53:18] doesn't mean there's not some real
[53:20] happening there and you go there and get
[53:22] something real because that's true
[53:24] so don't look at the devil that strikes
[53:26] oh everything's wrong no but whenever
[53:28] there's a move of god in power satan's
[53:29] gonna be right there too but don't let
[53:32] satan's presence keep you from getting
[53:34] what god is giving there at that very
[53:37] same time
[53:39] amen
[53:40] and that um that's the first part of our
[53:42] study for uh the book of ephesus um lord
[53:46] willing um i'd like to take a look at
[53:47] next time um if you if you were to
[53:50] next time we'll be going over uh the
[53:52] ephesian church age
[53:54] further so if you haven't read that
[53:55] chapter yet it'd be great to take the
[53:58] time to do it uh not too many pages if
[54:00] you do five or six pages a day you'll
[54:01] have it done just fine
[54:03] um one of the things that
[54:05] that the that the message that brother
[54:07] branham is criticized for is saying that
[54:10] paul was a prophet messenger he said
[54:12] people said no way nowhere does paul say
[54:15] that he was the prophet and the brother
[54:16] brandon mattis he can say he's a prophet
[54:19] we're going to go into that because we
[54:20] can find when paul's writing i think he
[54:22] really did understand his ministry to be
[54:24] pretty remarkable and even prophetic so
[54:27] take a look at that for next time and
[54:29] we're looking forward to taking uh going
[54:31] into that further let's go ahead and
[54:32] pray let's stand
[54:35] and brother gideon if you'll take over
[54:36] from there
[54:39] heavenly father i thank you for the
[54:41] for the keys that you give us lord
[54:44] now you see how
[54:46] how you started working in the very
[54:48] first
[54:49] church age way back there in the book of
[54:51] acts lord

[54:55] finally they're in ephesus lord

[54:59] part of the word you gave to ephesus
[55:00] that commendation how faithful they were
[55:02] and how how zealous they were and
[55:05] lord i
[55:06] know we've got
[55:07] many heroes

[55:27] renewing of your holy spirit father or

[55:41] every situation help us to do that o god

[55:46] discernment to see that false fight in
[55:47] the true vine and not let the false ever
