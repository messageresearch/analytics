[0:48] failed me and you never will. It's true.
[0:53] Might sound crazy but I'll sing it
[0:56] still. I count it all joy when I run
[0:58] into trouble. I count it all good when
[1:01] the bad days come. Cuz I know that
[1:03] you're always working. And I know that
[1:06] you're still not done. So I'm going to
[1:08] lift your praise through the trial.
[1:10] Ain't no storm. I'm going to stop my
[1:12] voice. Cuz I live some life and I've
[1:15] learned that I can always count it all
[1:18] grace. Count it all joy.
[1:25] And I gave you my heart in pieces
[1:28] and it healed inside your hands. The
[1:30] more I learn I can trust you, Jesus.
[1:34] Oh, the more I understand you
[1:37] never failed me and you never will. And
[1:41] you prove it on the daily. So I'll say
[1:45] it still. I count it all joy when I run
[1:48] into trouble. Count it all good when the
[1:50] bad days come. Cuz I know that you're
[1:53] always working and I know that you're
[1:56] still not done. So I'm going to lift
[1:58] your praise through the trial. Ain't no
[2:00] stop going to stop my voice. Cuz I've
[2:03] lived some life and I've learned that I
[2:05] can always count it all grace. Count it
[2:08] all joy.
[2:12] Oh,
[2:14] I'm counting all my blessings. I'm
[2:17] naming them one by one. And that number
[2:20] keeps getting higher. And I've only just
[2:23] begun. I'm counting all my blessings.
[2:27] I'm naming them one by one. That number
[2:31] keeps getting higher. And I've only just
[2:34] begun. Count it all joy when I'm running
[2:37] into trouble. Count it all good when the
[2:39] bad days come. Cuz I know that you're
[2:42] always working. And I know that you're
[2:44] still my turn. So I'm going to lift your
[2:47] praise to the child. Ain't no song going
[2:50] to stop my voice cuz I miss a life and
[2:53] I've learned that I can always count it
[2:56] all grace. Count it all joy. D
[3:01] oh
[3:06] we do the chorus again. Count it all joy
[3:08] when I run into trouble. Count it all
[3:11] good when the bad days come. Cuz I know
[3:14] that you're always working and I know
[3:16] that you're still not done. So I'm going
[3:18] to lift your praise through the trial.
[3:21] Ain't no stop. Got to stop my voice cuz
[3:24] I live some life and I've learned that I
[3:26] can always count it all. Count it all. D
[3:43] count it all grace, count it all joy.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 4. Now there cried
[3:48] a certain woman of the wives of the sons
[3:51] of the prophets unto Elisha, saying,
[3:54] "Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and
[3:56] thou knowest that thy servant did fear
[3:58] the Lord, and the creditor is come to
[4:00] take unto him my two sons to be
[4:03] bondmen." So it was very rough times
[4:06] down the road from when Elijah
[4:08] pronounced judgment on the whole
[4:09] generation, the whole nation. And so
[4:12] they're this this godly woman is living
[4:15] under the shadow and the the glooiness
[4:17] and the debt and all that's happening.
[4:19] And now they want to take her sons, take
[4:21] her family under the debt. Creditors are
[4:24] coming. She appeals to Elisha, not
[4:26] Elijah. Elisha. And Elisha said unto
[4:28] her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me,
[4:30] what hast thou in thy house?" And she
[4:32] said, "Thy handmmaid hath not anything
[4:34] in the house, save a pot of oil." Amen.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; I don't have anything but a little pot
[4:41] of oil. And then he said, "Go, borrow
[4:44] the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors,
[4:47] even empty vessels. Borrow not a few.
[4:50] And when thou when thou art come in,
[4:53] thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
[4:55] upon thy sons,
[4:58] and shall pour out into all those
[5:00] vessels, and thou shalt set aside that
[5:02] which is full." So this is not a public
[5:05] show. The third pole is not a public
[5:07] show. Shut yourself in your house with
[5:10] your sons and start pouring that oil
[5:12] into these vessels. She went from him
[5:15] and shut the door upon her and upon her
[5:17] sons who brought the vessels to her and
[5:19] she poured out. And it came to pass when
[5:21] the vessels were full that she said unto
[5:23] her son, "Bring me yet a vessel." And he
[5:25] said, "There is not a vessel more." And
[5:27] the oil stayed.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; And the oil stayed.
[5:37] And then she came and told the man of
[5:39] God and he said, "Go sell the oil, pay
[5:43] thy debt, and live thou and thy children
[5:46] of the rest." Praise be to God. So in
[5:48] Matthew 25, we have three parables that
[5:51] are related to the seventh seal or the
[5:53] coming of the Lord. And that parable
[5:56] spoke about the first parable spoke
[5:58] about was about the oil that was
[6:00] essential to finish the journey. It's
[6:03] about five wise virgins, five foolish
[6:06] virgins. And the only difference in the
[6:08] two, there wasn't hardly there wasn't
[6:09] hardly any difference in those two
[6:12] groups gathering. They were virgins. Uh
[6:14] they were sanctified. They loved the
[6:16] Lord. They took the journey in the
[6:18] message to go meet the bridegroom. They
[6:19] were all in the same group, but the only
[6:21] difference is one had oil in their
[6:23] lamps. The other didn't have oil in
[6:24] their lamps. And so we were speaking
[6:27] about this oil that is needed at the end
[6:30] time. the last thing that they needed
[6:33] for the last leg of the journey was oil.
[6:36] The only thing, the main thing. And so
[6:39] if that's a theme right now in the last
[6:41] days for our lives, then we should be
[6:44] saying, "Lord, there's one thing most
[6:46] important in me and my family's life. Do
[6:49] we have the oil? And do we have enough
[6:52] of the Holy Spirit to finish the
[6:54] journey?" Amen.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; That's that should be dominating our
[6:57] minds more than any business adventure,
[7:00] more than any family problem, more than
[7:02] any sickness. Lord, do I have the oil?
[7:07] &gt;&gt; And he made it the most prominent thing
[7:09] in the parable of the seventh seal and
[7:11] the coming of the Lord. And so it became
[7:13] essential. Uh what I'm basically
[7:15] preaching is essential oil.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; This is the the real essential oil. that
[7:24] I'm preaching about. And so now the
[7:27] foolish virgins, they discovered that
[7:30] they didn't have it the last minute.
[7:31] They discovered they had everything and
[7:34] they loved the Lord and they had all
[7:35] this, but they discovered they didn't
[7:37] have the oil. They came in the message
[7:40] to pursue the bridegroom. They heard the
[7:42] midnight cry because when it says
[7:45] midnight, how many know when it says
[7:46] midnight, that's at the darkest time. So
[7:49] it was at the darkest hour when the
[7:51] world had become dark when it had become
[7:53] full of perversion and everything that
[7:56] it was at that time the midnight cry the
[7:59] final cry went out rise up it's time to
[8:01] meet the bridegroom and take the last
[8:04] the last step of the journey to meet the
[8:07] bridegroom.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; And so they were virgins. They were
[8:11] sanctified. They they re they rejoiced
[8:14] in all this cry. They they actually woke
[8:17] up to the cry. It wasn't just the wise
[8:19] virgins that woke up. They woke up too.
[8:21] They all woke up. I heard the cry. I
[8:24] heard the midnight cry. They all were
[8:26] trimmed their lamps. All were the same
[8:28] as far as trim. They were pure good
[8:30] people. The prophet mentions they were
[8:32] pure good people, sanctified vessels of
[8:35] God,
[8:37] &gt;&gt; but lacking the oil to take the final
[8:41] leg of the journey.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; And that's pretty serious. I can't
[8:46] preach it any more serious than what the
[8:47] parable gives it. It's for our time.
[8:50] It's for right now. And so now, if
[8:52] that's the essential thing, there
[8:53] shouldn't be any other more essential
[8:55] thing in our lives. Except, Lord, every
[8:58] teenager ought to be saying, "I can't
[9:00] get in on my parents coattail." Every
[9:02] teenager should be going to God and say,
[9:04] "That's what the parable said. My God
[9:06] warned me that the only thing lacking
[9:08] was the oil. I better make sure, God,
[9:10] I'm seeking the Holy Ghost
[9:12] &gt;&gt; for myself. If my dad don't have it, my
[9:15] mom don't have it, it doesn't matter.
[9:17] I've got to seek this for myself, it's
[9:19] more important than anything in life.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; How many would say amen to that?
[9:23] &gt;&gt; If Jesus said it was important and
[9:25] that's the parable we're living in right
[9:27] now and you're interested in the coming
[9:29] of the Lord and you're interested in
[9:31] meeting the bridegroom, if you're
[9:33] interested in that, then you have to
[9:35] have the oil.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; You have to have the Holy Spirit. You
[9:39] have to know that you have the Holy
[9:41] Spirit in your life. Not just that you
[9:43] love God, but there's an identification
[9:45] of the depth of your soul that I believe
[9:48] this word of this hour and I'm following
[9:50] it as best I can with all of my heart.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; It's gambling with your life to think
[9:54] that trimming your lamp every now and
[9:56] then is enough.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what the parable says? It is
[10:03] is gambling with your life to think that
[10:05] trimming my lamp every now and then in
[10:07] church or being stirred to wake up by
[10:09] the midnight cry is enough. It was not
[10:12] enough. It is not enough to depend on
[10:14] others. It's not enough today to only
[10:16] open your Bible just at church. It's not
[10:19] enough to overcome this midnight hour of
[10:21] darkness with just being a good boy.
[10:23] It's more than being a good boy. It's
[10:25] more than being a good girl. It's not
[10:27] enough to wear the right clothes. It's
[10:29] not enough just to attend a message
[10:31] church. You have to have the whole true
[10:34] Holy Spirit, the oil in your life.
[10:38] Excuse me for being so straight, but you
[10:40] can't get any more straight than what
[10:41] the parable preaches to you. Some were
[10:44] lacking oil and they discovered it and
[10:46] they said, "Oh, can" and then they tried
[10:48] to depend on and take from oil from the
[10:50] other ones and they said, "Wait a
[10:51] minute. Wait a minute." And I feel like
[10:53] I have to say that to people sometimes
[10:55] because people can be so needy and
[10:57] they're clinging to something and what
[10:58] they're what they're clinging to
[11:00] clinging to sometimes is their own lack
[11:02] of the Holy Ghost themselves and they
[11:04] see the strength in you. But you see now
[11:06] I'm saying I've got enough just for
[11:09] myself to finish the journey.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; That's what they said. The wiser. We
[11:13] only have enough for oursel to finish
[11:15] this journey.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Go to them that buy and sell. Go get it
[11:19] yourself.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Come through the same thing. Do the same
[11:23] thing. Sell out to yourself to get
[11:27] what's needed. And I want to say this
[11:29] lastly about Matthew 25. It's about
[11:32] having what's needed to finish this
[11:36] journey.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; It's not that you started this journey
[11:40] in the message.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; It's about how you end.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Can I get any help this morning?
[11:49] &gt;&gt; It's not that you start. Praise the Lord
[11:51] that you started. Praise the Lord that
[11:53] you believe. Praise the Lord that you
[11:55] set on a journey to see the bridegroom.
[11:58] Praise the Lord you started. But from my
[12:00] all the Bible things, Bible scriptures
[12:02] that I read and I'm going to read some
[12:03] to you this morning. It's not about just
[12:05] that you started. It's how you end.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; It's how the the the journey ends. Can
[12:09] you say amen? And how tragic it would be
[12:12] that you started the journey, but now
[12:14] you're kind of doubting and you're kind
[12:15] of phasing out. No. No. This is not the
[12:18] time to phase out. This is not the time
[12:21] to stop praying. It's the time to pray
[12:23] more.
[12:25] This is not the time to become more
[12:27] worldly and dabble in more worldly
[12:28] things. It's the time to become more
[12:30] sanctified.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you say amen? The last hour,
[12:35] the last leg of the trip, the last run
[12:38] of the race. It's not the time to be
[12:40] dillydallying around. It's time to run
[12:42] with all of our hearts. It's time to go
[12:45] forward. Can you say amen?
[12:47] &gt;&gt; It's not the time to get lexadasical.
[12:49] It's not the time to get loose. It's not
[12:51] the time to look for things you can get
[12:52] by with. Is that the time I think of
[12:55] Jesus when he was in the garden? His
[12:57] last hours there, it got so dark and his
[12:59] disciples, he took them in to pray. They
[13:01] fell asleep in the garden. They all fell
[13:04] asleep because why did they fall asleep?
[13:06] They didn't recognize the hour that they
[13:08] were in. This is it. This is a wrap-up.
[13:11] And it's not a time to sleep. It's time
[13:14] to pray. Brothers, I need your prayers.
[13:16] But they couldn't do it because they
[13:17] didn't recognize the hour. Anybody who
[13:19] recognizes this hour right now, the
[13:22] final seconds, we're not three minutes
[13:24] before midnight. We're just a few
[13:25] seconds before midnight. And anybody who
[13:28] catches that revelation is not praying
[13:30] less. They're praying more. They're not
[13:32] they're not they're not pulling away and
[13:34] getting more bitter. They're saying,
[13:36] "Lord, heal my bitterness. Take me
[13:38] closer to you."
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Anybody who recognizes where we're at
[13:42] right now, there's going to be changes
[13:44] in their life.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; The oil is the most essential thing.
[13:47] Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; And I want to live and I want to be
[13:50] filled with it. And so, you know, that's
[13:52] the thing is the is the final stage of
[13:55] the journey, the final life. This is not
[13:56] a time to be dabbling and playing around
[13:58] and playing church. It's not the time
[14:00] for it. And when Jesus was in that
[14:02] garden, that's what I was finishing.
[14:03] Jesus was in there. He come and woke him
[14:05] up. He said, "Go ahead and take your
[14:07] rest now." But he said, "This hour, the
[14:10] Bible says that Jesus, he prayed. He
[14:12] come and found them sleeping. He prayed
[14:14] again. And the Bible says he prayed more
[14:18] earnestly than he'd ever prayed.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; In Jesus' final hours,
[14:23] &gt;&gt; it was not this attitude. This is all
[14:26] wrapped up anyway. It's just about over.
[14:29] I'm predestinated to do this.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many predestinated people that
[14:35] think they're so predestinated? And we
[14:37] heard it Wednesday night from brother
[14:38] Rap. I love to say amen to the truths of
[14:41] predestination. I believe God knew me
[14:43] before the foundation of the world. But
[14:44] that doesn't justify laziness. That
[14:47] actually should build faith to say, "I'm
[14:49] one of them and I'm going to finish this
[14:50] journey." Well, I'm going to finish this
[14:52] journey filled with the Holy Ghost.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; It's not a things that I'm predestined.
[14:57] Jesus say, "Well, this whole thing's
[14:58] predestinated anyway. I'm supposed to go
[15:00] to the cross." And and so he just lays
[15:01] back and he said, "You know why you guys
[15:02] are sleeping? Make make some room for
[15:04] me. I'm going to lay down and take a
[15:05] nap, too."
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Bible says he prayed more earners. He
[15:08] didn't pray less. He prayed more.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; He entered in more. Anybody hearing what
[15:13] I'm saying this morning?
[15:15] &gt;&gt; And so in the darkest hour, the final
[15:17] leg of the journey, that's not the time
[15:20] to play around. Can you say amen? That's
[15:22] not the time to be doing something less.
[15:24] That's not the time to be moving along
[15:27] in the social media with the direction
[15:29] that the defectors are going and the
[15:31] people who left the message and keeping
[15:33] your eye, man, look what they're getting
[15:34] to do now. Look at Oh, look what they
[15:36] get to wear now. This is not the time to
[15:38] be looking at them.
[15:40] They if they keep going, they're fitted
[15:42] for destruction. Are you called to that?
[15:45] No, you're not called to that. It's not
[15:46] a time to loosen up and say, "God, I
[15:48] need more of you."
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." This not a time to
[15:53] be just just say, "Oh, this we're here.
[15:56] We're going to finish it up. Let's
[15:57] finish well. Let's finish the last leg."
[16:00] Well, let's run with patience the race
[16:03] that sets before us.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; It's about finishing well. It's not that
[16:08] you had enough to start. It's about you
[16:10] had enough oil to start. It's about do
[16:12] you have enough to end. It's about
[16:14] finishing. It's not that you started.
[16:16] I'll come back to that in just a minute.
[16:18] With all the scriptures that talked
[16:19] about talk about God's interested in how
[16:21] we finish, not just that we start with
[16:23] the Lord. There's so many types about
[16:25] Elijah and Elisha concerning this day. I
[16:28] don't have time, but I want to bring out
[16:29] one first of all, and that is Elisha and
[16:32] Elijah both had meetings with widows,
[16:35] with women,
[16:37] &gt;&gt; and they were widows. And they were
[16:38] living in a dark time, both of them. And
[16:40] they had a need during the dark time.
[16:42] That's a type of the bride. Because we
[16:44] live in the darkest times. We live in a
[16:46] time of debt spiritually. Can you say
[16:48] amen?
[16:49] &gt;&gt; We're in in debt. The world's in debt
[16:51] spiritually. We're in a time that they
[16:52] want to take our children. How many
[16:54] raise your hand? They want to take our
[16:55] children.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; So all these scenarios are here. And
[16:58] both these women had some Elijah came to
[17:00] one, Elisha came to another one. And
[17:02] it's interesting how they dealt with
[17:03] them. They live they lived in famine.
[17:05] They lived in debt. They lived in
[17:07] depressing times. They lived in a time
[17:08] of loss. They were barely getting by.
[17:11] But then the scripture says in chapter
[17:13] four, I read to you, "But in the middle
[17:14] of that, there cried a woman." Under
[17:17] those conditions, a woman cried. Now,
[17:20] wasn't there other people crying during
[17:22] that time? Wasn't there other women
[17:24] crying? I'd say there was. I'd say
[17:26] because of the depressing times and the
[17:28] debt and all the the depression, there
[17:30] was probably other women that had tears.
[17:32] And and that's fine. God knows about
[17:34] that, too. But yet God, this this one,
[17:37] these women got God's attention. Their
[17:40] cry got God's attention.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; And so now that's a wonderful thing to
[17:46] recognize that they both went to widow
[17:47] women and that was to their that was
[17:49] their ministry because Elijah, he had a
[17:51] dispensational ministry. He spoke to the
[17:53] whole nation. He brought a curse on
[17:55] Jezebel. He brought a curse on Ahab and
[17:57] the whole house of Ahab, which was a
[17:59] Jehovah Gyra believing king. He was the
[18:02] king of of Israel. but he married the
[18:04] wrong woman. And so now Elijah came to
[18:06] put a curse on all that thing and he
[18:08] stopped up the heavens. There was no
[18:09] rain. There was famine in the land. All
[18:11] the conditions, a lot of the Oh boy, let
[18:14] me say it. A lot of the conditions we're
[18:16] in right now is because Elijah came in
[18:18] this hour and he spoke the word and our
[18:21] nation and our world rejected Elijah.
[18:24] And that's why we're in the conditions
[18:25] that we're in.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; So remember that. Can you say amen? It's
[18:29] because Elijah has come that we live in
[18:31] these conditions.
[18:33] But the bride has to live in it until
[18:35] the rapture time. The bride's living in
[18:37] these conditions. And so there was
[18:38] others crying, but this one got their
[18:40] attention and they went to these women.
[18:42] So now I want you to notice something
[18:43] else. There was a change in leadership
[18:46] from it was the same message, but there
[18:48] was a a bit of change in leadership from
[18:50] Elijah to Elisha because we know that
[18:53] Elijah had a double portion of the
[18:54] spirit of the prophet. Elijah called
[18:56] fire down from heaven. He spoke to the
[18:59] entire dispensation. and Elijah. He
[19:01] rebuked the whole generation. His
[19:03] indictment was to the whole religious
[19:04] system. He spoke boldly to Jezebel. But
[19:07] Elisha Elisha, he didn't do all that. He
[19:10] didn't speak judgment to the whole uh
[19:12] generation and dispensation. He didn't
[19:15] have to. Elijah had already done it.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; It's not to the whole generation. But
[19:20] Elisha's ministry was more to the
[19:23] personal effect.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't to the nation. And it was more
[19:28] to the person.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; It was to non. It was to this widow
[19:34] woman. It was dealing personally.
[19:36] Anytime he got involved with preachers,
[19:38] it didn't go so well. Remember when he
[19:39] first was first finished there, they
[19:42] were looking for Elijah. They said,
[19:43] "We're we got to go find Elijah. Would
[19:45] you come with us?" He said, "You know,
[19:47] Elijah's gone on in the chariot. They're
[19:48] trying to bring Elijah back.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; They're trying to act like Elijah's
[19:53] still here." And there's a change in
[19:55] administration from the hymn to the she
[19:58] from Elijah to Elisha. And I'm telling
[20:00] you, Elijah spoke to the whole, he
[20:03] indicted the entire religious system.
[20:06] Not the people, but he indicted the
[20:08] entire religious system for crucifying
[20:11] the son of God. Aresh again.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; But Elisha when he came, he didn't do
[20:16] that.
[20:17] It was more of a personal level to meet
[20:20] the God meeting the personal needs,
[20:22] personal revival, not a national
[20:24] revival, a personal healing to
[20:26] individuals, a personal restoration to
[20:29] individuals, not judgment. Now, I want
[20:32] to say to you that God is still a God of
[20:34] judgment.
[20:36] And God may put us back in line when
[20:38] we're out of line, but for the most
[20:40] part, we're not here now to pronounce
[20:42] judgment like Elijah did. Anytime a a
[20:45] pastor or ministry today tries to be the
[20:48] prophet and pronounce judgment on
[20:49] everything, he's out of his office. He
[20:52] can give discernment. He can give
[20:53] counsel. But when he takes in his hand,
[20:55] pronounce judgment over the whole thing.
[20:57] He's taken the office of a prophet. And
[20:59] you're not a prophet. You're a pastor.
[21:01] Elijah, he pronounced judgment of the
[21:02] whole system. Jezebel, he wasn't afraid
[21:04] of judgment. He was bo just telling it
[21:06] like it is. And but but Elisha, his
[21:10] matter was more to the personal thing.
[21:12] And I just want to say once again about
[21:14] judgment. The bride is the true bride is
[21:16] no longer under the judgments of God.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; She has the Holy Ghost. She's pass
[21:21] judgment.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; So why do you keep bringing judgment on
[21:24] the bride? She's pass judgment.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "What about when Elisha called
[21:34] two she bears out of the woods because
[21:36] he got offended at his complex about his
[21:38] bald head?"
[21:40] Oh, I got another sermon.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; One of the things preachers needs to two
[21:45] or three things pre preachers have to
[21:47] grow out of personally in their walk
[21:49] with God, they've got to grow out of
[21:51] their complexes.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes they preach their
[21:55] complexes and not the word of God.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; And that day,
[22:00] if you think that he was, that's the day
[22:02] that Elisha was acting like Elijah a
[22:04] little bit because he's going to call
[22:05] the she bears out and kill those kids.
[22:07] And brother Bram said he that was not
[22:09] the Holy Spirit. That was him acting
[22:12] &gt;&gt; in his own way.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; But it looked like Elijah. He's getting
[22:15] out of step. His ministry wasn't Elijah
[22:18] to pronounce judgment like that. It was
[22:19] Elisha. And so he acted out of place. He
[22:22] made a mistake.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Did I say that on national?
[22:30] &gt;&gt; He made a mistake.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; And he preached his own complex. Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Should we go through the Bible and talk
[22:38] about Moses, the great prophet, who made
[22:40] a mistake
[22:41] &gt;&gt; and one day struck the rock twice
[22:44] because of his frustration with the
[22:46] people and his temper got up to the
[22:49] people so bad. He was supposed to strike
[22:51] it once and struck it twice, made a
[22:53] mistake. God said, "Your temper, that
[22:55] thing, you're not even going in the
[22:57] promised land."
[23:01] &gt;&gt; It's in your Bible. Everybody hold your
[23:02] Bible. It's It's in there.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; God's true prophet definitely.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; But he made a mistake there. He got in
[23:12] the flesh.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; And so Elisha, that's the one time, I
[23:16] don't know why I'm elaborating on this.
[23:18] It's not in my notes, but I like to say
[23:19] that he called them out. He shouldn't
[23:21] have done that because once again, it's
[23:23] this whole thing is that the
[23:24] administration or the leadership had
[23:26] changed under Elisha. Even though the
[23:28] spirit was a double portion, the
[23:29] administration of it changed a bit
[23:31] because it was not to speak to the
[23:32] nation. There was not to be a national
[23:34] revival. That was that day he called
[23:36] fire down and then Israel they all they
[23:38] come around that he did Elijah was to do
[23:41] that. Can you say amen? Around the
[23:42] country almost in every major city in
[23:45] this nation Elijah spoke.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Now Elisha he ministers and he ministers
[23:52] personally. It's not a national revival.
[23:55] And so now one of the things that Elisha
[23:59] does clearly is when someone has a need,
[24:05] he always asks for them to do something
[24:07] first
[24:09] &gt;&gt; before he meets the need. Now Elijah had
[24:12] the power. Somebody was out of money or
[24:13] somebody had Elijah, he just say, "Okay,
[24:15] it's yours. That's it. It's yours." But
[24:17] somehow with Elisha,
[24:20] he's asking for them to do something.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; And then they get their miracle.
[24:25] Amen.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Non was struck with leprosy and he comes
[24:29] send he didn't even go himself. He said
[24:31] you you go and tell non he needs to dip
[24:34] seven times in the dirtiest river in all
[24:38] of Israel Jordan. He needs to go dip
[24:41] seven times and then he'll receive my
[24:43] healing. Now this is a great man and
[24:45] he's and he doesn't even come himself.
[24:47] My dad used to say that the servant
[24:49] knocked on the door and non came to the
[24:51] door and his servant he said I asked for
[24:53] Elisha to come. He said, "Elijah said
[24:55] he's not coming. He just sent me, his
[24:57] servant."
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to see the man. I want to
[25:03] see the pastor himself.
[25:06] Good thing he didn't have that attitude.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; But he says, um, he said, "If you go
[25:13] down and dip seven times in Jordan,
[25:16] you'll be healed."
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Just at that moment is a test of your
[25:20] faith.
[25:23] But it's God asking you to do something
[25:25] dirty. Not dirty in the sense of sinful,
[25:28] but doing something that's not
[25:30] convenient, not easy. Go dip seven
[25:32] times. Okay. All right. I'll go do it.
[25:36] And maybe he was grumbling the whole
[25:37] time. I wanted to see Elijah. I wanted
[25:39] to see the guy. And he goes down. This
[25:42] is the muddiest river in in all of
[25:44] Israel, the Jordan. Why couldn't he pick
[25:46] this? How could he why? Oh, why do I
[25:48] have to do this? He dips. finish the
[25:50] story. He went ahead and dipped seven
[25:52] times and when he come out he was healed
[25:54] of his leprosy.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; So this prophet was asking you to do
[25:58] something first.
[26:00] A personal contact with God through
[26:03] Elisha, but he's asking for you to do
[26:05] something first. And he did that with
[26:06] this woman. He says,"Woman, what do you
[26:08] have need of? What can I do for you?"
[26:10] And she says, "They're going to take my
[26:12] sons. We're in debt. You know, my
[26:14] husband's gone. I'm a widow. He served
[26:16] you with the fear of God. He loved the
[26:18] message of the hour. He's gone. We're
[26:20] under the pressure of this famine and
[26:21] they're going to take my children. I
[26:23] have nothing. He said, "You have
[26:25] nothing." She said, "I have nothing."
[26:26] "Do you have anything?" Well, I've got a
[26:28] pot of oil left. Now, when Elijah dealt
[26:30] with the widow woman, she had a little a
[26:32] little meal and she had a little bit of
[26:34] oil. And he says, "I want you to take
[26:36] that and make a cake." She said, "Well,
[26:38] I'm making the cake. It's my last cake
[26:40] for me and my son to die. We're going to
[26:42] That's it. We're finished. It's our last
[26:43] meal. Go and make the cake. Take what
[26:46] oil you have, put it together, make a
[26:48] cake, and bring the cake to me so I can
[26:49] eat.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; God knows how to test you
[26:58] &gt;&gt; in what you won't give up.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; But she did it and she got a miracle.
[27:05] And this woman said, "All right." And he
[27:08] said, "Go get all the vessels.
[27:10] Empty them all. Make sure there's
[27:11] nothing in the vessels. Empty out the
[27:13] vessels." And and and then you start
[27:16] bringing this together and their son son
[27:18] started to do it behind closed doors in
[27:20] a secret place with God and they filled
[27:24] every vessel up. Every empty vessel
[27:26] vessel was filled with the oil. Can you
[27:30] say praise the Lord?
[27:31] &gt;&gt; It's a type of our day.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Bring your empty vessel to God.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Empty out of yourself. Empty out of your
[27:40] knowledge and your past bitterness and
[27:42] your past experiences. Empty out of your
[27:45] religious pride. Empty out of all of it
[27:48] and say, "God, fill it now with your
[27:50] oil."
[27:51] &gt;&gt; God is a completer.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; How many knows that God is a completer?
[27:58] &gt;&gt; God is not wanting to start something in
[28:00] you. He wants to finish something in
[28:03] you. He that hath begun a good work in
[28:06] you will be faithful to complete a work
[28:08] in you.
