[0:00] Corinthians 15 and verse 1 is where we
[0:02] want to read and we'll just allow the
[0:05] Lord to take over this morning and do
[0:07] whatever he wants in this service God
[0:10] bless you I hope I didn't miss any of
[0:12] the announcements I always go home and
[0:14] feel like I have guilt that I forgot
[0:16] somebody or something so if I forgot you
[0:18] this morning God bless you God doesn't
[0:21] forget amen God doesn't forget First
[0:24] Corinthians 15 and verse 1.
[0:29] moreover Brethren I declare unto you the
[0:31] gospel which I preached unto you which
[0:33] also ye have received and wherein ye
[0:36] stand by which also ye are saved so the
[0:39] gospel that he preached brings salvation
[0:41] that's how they were saved if the gospel
[0:43] is not preached people can't be saved
[0:45] but when the gospel is preached the good
[0:48] news then people are saved by which also
[0:51] you're saved if you keep in memory what
[0:53] I preached unto you
[0:55] unless ye have believed in vain and what
[0:58] that means is that if you really
[1:00] believed it not superficially not just
[1:02] in your head but from your heart if you
[1:05] really believe this then you are saved
[1:08] and also you are you you should keep it
[1:10] in your memory the things that I've
[1:12] preached to you how many know it's
[1:13] important to keep the word of God in
[1:15] your memory and keep that's why we come
[1:17] to church to bring things into
[1:19] remembrance uh tomorrow is Memorial Day
[1:22] and there's a certain time we give to
[1:24] remember what's been done I want to talk
[1:26] a little bit about that this morning
[1:28] what Memorial Day means not just for
[1:30] this country but also for Christians God
[1:33] has memorials for us and God wants us to
[1:35] remember what he's done for us amen and
[1:38] keep the word of God in our memory keep
[1:40] reminding us of the word of God but
[1:43] verse 3 says for I delivered for I
[1:45] delivered unto you the first first of
[1:47] all that which I also received and what
[1:50] he means there is that this is the most
[1:52] important thing this is top priority
[1:55] uh for I delivered unto you first of all
[1:57] before anything before anything I
[1:59] preached first of all that which also I
[2:02] received in other words what God gave me
[2:04] I gave you how that Christ died for our
[2:09] sins according to the scriptures the
[2:12] first thing that Paul said I brought to
[2:15] you and the most important thing is
[2:17] somebody died for you
[2:21] and if we skip to the other parts and
[2:24] miss this part we're missing something
[2:26] essential to the Christian walk can you
[2:29] say Amen my title this morning is
[2:31] somebody died for you somebody died for
[2:34] you I'm going to read that verse again I
[2:35] delivered unto you the priority first of
[2:38] all before all things that which I
[2:39] received how that Christ died for our
[2:43] sins according to the scriptures can we
[2:46] pray together Lord Jesus thank you Lord
[2:48] for this opportunity for to the people
[2:51] of God to gather together and Lord we
[2:54] pray that your anointing would fall upon
[2:56] our lips this morning Father we stand as
[2:58] a man but Lord we stand as a minister of
[3:01] the gospel and Lord the things that we
[3:04] handle Lord must be handled with Clean
[3:06] Hands the things that we handle in your
[3:08] word must be handled right Lord and if
[3:10] we put our own agenda to it our own
[3:12] motive to it it's wrong father if I have
[3:15] just my own thing that I want to push
[3:17] that's wrong but Lord Jesus when you can
[3:19] take a vessel over and give the gift
[3:21] back to your church then many lives can
[3:24] be affected for the kingdom there'll be
[3:26] salvations there'll be holy ghost
[3:28] fillings there'll be people healed and
[3:30] Lord God we see it happening overseas
[3:32] and we see it here last Sunday as you
[3:34] over and over again Lord people's Faith
[3:37] raised to the place to believe that
[3:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[3:42] and forever and there isn't a cancer
[3:44] there isn't death there isn't somebody
[3:46] being paralyzed there's nothing Lord
[3:49] that would stand in the way of a
[3:51] Believer just simply believing if God
[3:53] did it again if God did it in the past
[3:55] he can do it again and Lord that's the
[3:58] faith we want in your word this morning
[4:00] for these signs shall follow them that
[4:02] believe this word we place it in your
[4:04] hands we pray you will affect everyone
[4:06] that's in the service this morning and
[4:08] those that are listening as we commit it
[4:10] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:12] Christ we ask him and everybody said
[4:14] amen amen praise the Lord thank you Lane
[4:17] for that big amen I'll need those later
[4:19] give me some more of those God bless you
[4:22] may be seated I appreciate the faith
[4:24] last Sunday as brother Matt was bringing
[4:26] and showing those cancer patients
[4:28] completely delivered and showing the
[4:30] pictures of it and just Rose your faith
[4:32] I was very proud of the congregation how
[4:35] that we didn't have to force any kind of
[4:37] prayer line but Faith dropped in your
[4:39] heart to believe that all things are
[4:40] possible I would like to hear those
[4:42] testimonies back if you have them this
[4:44] week if God has delivered you or brought
[4:46] you anything that came from that I'd
[4:48] certainly like to hear it because I like
[4:50] to testify of it and give the devil a
[4:52] black eye God is doing some wonderful
[4:54] things but just the faith that came in
[4:56] the people uh people believe in for any
[4:58] little thing or any big thing it didn't
[5:00] matter when God raises our faith that
[5:02] way all things are possible praise the
[5:04] Lord as as I just like to speak a little
[5:07] bit this morning on someone died for me
[5:09] and I want to we realize that tomorrow
[5:12] is a holiday uh Memorial Day and that
[5:16] was set up since 1971 our country set it
[5:18] up as a national holiday and I would say
[5:21] that I guess like with most holidays
[5:24] over time the new generation especially
[5:27] begins to lose the purpose and the
[5:29] meaning of the holidays it happens
[5:31] almost with every good holiday that
[5:34] we're really not celebrating the true
[5:35] thing of what it meant years ago the new
[5:38] generation tends to lose the being
[5:41] connected with the meaning of it so some
[5:44] of my sermon this morning will be just
[5:46] letting everyone know what Memorial Day
[5:49] means and what it uh what it what it was
[5:52] started for and there was another
[5:54] holiday that went on from years before
[5:56] that but then they changed it and so
[5:59] since 1971 uh there's a there's a
[6:02] meeting behind this holiday tomorrow and
[6:04] quite often we get together for our hot
[6:06] dogs and hamburgers and if that's
[6:08] happening of course I'm there I'm not
[6:09] going to miss it but through all of our
[6:12] you know any holiday can lose its
[6:14] purpose Christmas has certainly lost its
[6:16] purpose and its meaning can you say Amen
[6:18] July 4th and and you can just say all of
[6:21] the all most of the holidays and and I
[6:24] hate that Thanksgiving kind of gets lost
[6:26] in the shuffle of turkey and different
[6:28] things because we miss the meaning of it
[6:31] and what the purpose was and why it was
[6:33] set for a memorial can you say Amen we
[6:36] we tend to We tend to uh lose the
[6:40] meaning of something and and there's
[6:42] when we take something and turn it into
[6:45] something else it loses its immediate
[6:47] meaning and it loses loses a feeling to
[6:50] it uh there's a natural disconnect in
[6:53] the new generation from the meaning and
[6:56] even the power of something because
[6:59] sometimes something can have a meaning
[7:01] to it and An Origin to it but sometimes
[7:04] when we are connected to the meaning of
[7:07] it it has a power with it to affect our
[7:10] lives today
[7:11] when we're connected with something the
[7:14] way it started especially God's word and
[7:16] when he did something in the past when
[7:18] we connect let me just bring this when
[7:20] you connect with the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:22] and his word truly connect in your heart
[7:25] and with what he did at Calvary when you
[7:28] connect with that it has an effect on
[7:30] your life today it has a power that goes
[7:33] with it
[7:36] and so uh we we tend to become
[7:38] disconnected and there's a saying that I
[7:40] use that comes from Rush Limbaugh he
[7:42] applied it to the the Democrats but I
[7:44] will not do that this morning because I
[7:46] think it's a great statement he attached
[7:48] to the Democrats but I attach it to
[7:50] Christianity Today and to many other
[7:52] things he said that it becomes symbolism
[7:55] over substance and he was saying that
[7:57] some people it becomes something becomes
[7:59] a symbol something in history just
[8:01] becomes a symbol and we celebrate the
[8:03] symbol and we celebrate some distant
[8:06] thing that took place but we miss the
[8:08] substance of what It produced we miss
[8:11] the substance that what it really means
[8:13] to us how many can safely say in
[8:15] Christianity that that the church as a
[8:18] whole loses the power of the Cross can
[8:21] you say Amen but they're celebrating the
[8:23] cross they're singing about the cross
[8:25] but you can lose the power of the Cross
[8:27] and what it does in our lives
[8:30] people talk about Jesus Christ at
[8:32] Christmas they talk about his birth oh
[8:34] yes he was born God came to Earth but
[8:36] there ought to be a revelation behind
[8:38] that affects our lives that today I'm
[8:41] living because of what happened in the
[8:42] past I'm living in the power of what
[8:45] took place in the past I'm living in the
[8:47] meaning of it can you say it means
[8:49] something to me because he's done
[8:51] something through the work of the cross
[8:52] two thousand years ago I'm feeling the
[8:55] effects of that
[8:56] can you say man
[8:58] and if that doesn't happen then we
[9:00] become symbolism over substance we don't
[9:03] have the substance of what it means we
[9:05] don't have the reality of the Holy Ghost
[9:07] and what this Bible is to produce as the
[9:09] Holy Ghost
[9:11] and that's a tragedy because then it
[9:12] becomes religion and religion isn't
[9:16] working anymore
[9:18] I'll say that for the world I'll say it
[9:21] for our own ranks religion isn't working
[9:24] anymore matter of fact it never did
[9:26] really work but people are discovering
[9:29] that even when they have the religion of
[9:31] this and the movement of the message
[9:32] it's not enough it has to be a personal
[9:34] relationship with Christ and the power
[9:37] God hates a powerless religion did you
[9:41] know that
[9:42] God hates a powerless religion God hates
[9:46] symbolism over substance God hates that
[9:49] is resurrection and his crucifixion and
[9:51] the power of what he brought he hates
[9:53] that it becomes just a symbol in
[9:55] people's lives
[9:56] God hates a powerless Church
[10:01] that God loves to see his power
[10:03] manifested in lives
[10:05] on an everyday basis
[10:08] symbolism over substance some things
[10:10] have a a powerful impression and affect
[10:13] our lives and when we really understand
[10:15] the meaning of it we've become connected
[10:18] with the results of it and it's like
[10:21] Christ dying to take our sin away that
[10:24] statement as is read in the scripture he
[10:26] said how that Christ died for our sins
[10:29] according to the scriptures there was an
[10:32] effect Christ died for us somebody died
[10:35] for us but what's the effect to take our
[10:38] sin
[10:40] to take our sin if we lose the meaning
[10:43] of that then we're caught with our sin
[10:46] and the soul that sinneth it shall die
[10:50] so what the Bible says
[10:52] if you're not delivered from your sin
[10:54] the soul that sinneth it will die
[10:57] there's no future to that it ends
[10:59] someday but the effect of Christ someone
[11:03] dying for us has a a residual effect and
[11:07] even up until last week and the week
[11:09] before watching lives transformed we're
[11:12] seeing that the blood the the one who
[11:14] died for us we're still seeing the
[11:15] effect in people's lives in young people
[11:18] being changed just a few weeks ago a
[11:20] young person breaking down before their
[11:22] parents and saying I need God I need to
[11:24] be baptized it doesn't have to be in
[11:27] church but we're still seeing the
[11:29] effects of the blood of Jesus Christ
[11:31] somebody died for us but what good is it
[11:34] to talk about it if we don't have our
[11:36] sins released from us
[11:37] [Applause]
[11:40] what good is the message of the hour
[11:42] unless we see the powerful effect of
[11:44] Jesus Christ coming from the message of
[11:46] the hour
[11:48] and that's not just a feeling that's not
[11:50] just an emotion that's not just dancing
[11:52] in the spirit it's the power to live a
[11:55] life it's the power to overcome demons
[11:57] it's the power to overcome habits it's
[12:00] the power to overcome pornography it's
[12:02] the power I'm talking about Calvary
[12:04] somebody died for us and in that is the
[12:07] power to overcome can you say Amen the
[12:10] power to overcome fornication the power
[12:12] to overcome adultery the power to
[12:15] overcome any demon Spirit Satan bring
[12:18] the best of your spirits to us and the
[12:20] power of Calvary can deliver that person
[12:22] from it
[12:23] [Applause]
[12:26] Memorial Day is a day to I didn't know
[12:29] if you the young people knew it they
[12:30] probably do but I'm reminding us of that
[12:33] day Memorial Day is is to remember ones
[12:35] who have died in military service
[12:38] throughout history
[12:40] and they died for a reason thank God
[12:42] they died for a reason and that is they
[12:45] died to preserve our Liberty they died
[12:47] to preserve our unity in our country
[12:50] to preserve the Liberties that we enjoy
[12:52] you see the new generations we tend to
[12:55] let our liberties become common someone
[12:57] will get 16 17 years old and they'll be
[13:00] given a a car and and they can go and
[13:02] come and drive places and so but see
[13:05] there are some countries or some places
[13:06] we can come to church today still in
[13:09] Liberty I don't know how much longer
[13:10] those Liberties will be left but I can
[13:12] tell you as long as I've got it before
[13:14] they shut these doors I want to be here
[13:16] every time the doors are open because
[13:18] that's a liberty that I'm enjoying and
[13:19] there's many countries that don't have
[13:21] that Liberty they can't worship the way
[13:23] they want to worship but in our country
[13:25] there's been millions of lives that have
[13:27] been given somebody died that you could
[13:30] come in your car this morning and nobody
[13:32] told you what to do nobody told you to
[13:34] come to church or not go to church
[13:36] nobody dictated you pretty much live in
[13:38] those Liberties I can go to the store I
[13:40] can go here I can go do I do I'll say
[13:43] something about covet though I will say
[13:45] something kovid was a a the first step
[13:49] towards moving toward is a communist
[13:51] control that comes over our lives that
[13:54] you're going to do this you're not going
[13:55] to do that and all in the name of covet
[13:57] for the safety of all mankind you better
[14:00] have the discernment to know where that
[14:01] was going
[14:03] because that was the first set to me to
[14:05] engage in in the minds of the people
[14:08] that for the safety of all we all need
[14:11] to join in with this and you need to do
[14:13] this matter of fact you have to do this
[14:15] oh that's not popular there's not many
[14:17] amens to that
[14:19] and I can't even hear him on the
[14:21] streaming I can't even hear the amens
[14:22] that's not very popular but I'm going to
[14:24] tell you something there is scripture
[14:26] that shows that there's a control
[14:29] that you can't buy or sell
[14:32] unless you bought into that image into
[14:34] the beast that's coming and it's closer
[14:37] than you think but the people's minds
[14:39] have to be prepared for it so
[14:41] controlling but listen today you didn't
[14:43] have anybody tell you not to come to
[14:45] church young people you didn't have told
[14:47] me about you couldn't drive your car to
[14:48] church you have Liberties here and I
[14:50] want to tell you you have them because
[14:52] there's been hundreds of thousands of
[14:54] lives that have died so you could have
[14:56] Liberty this morning
[14:59] and that's what Memorial Day is about
[15:01] tomorrow
[15:02] it's the memorial not of one's uh not of
[15:06] ones that have served in the military
[15:08] that's Veterans Day this is one who have
[15:10] died
[15:13] to preserve our Liberty to keep us safe
[15:15] from tyrants to keep us safe from
[15:17] terrorists so we can live in a free
[15:20] country people have died for that and
[15:22] when many of them signed up for it
[15:24] signed up for the military service to go
[15:26] fight in wars and they signed up knowing
[15:28] that they may die for it that's bravery
[15:31] to sign up to realize I can lose my life
[15:33] over this but if they did it for the
[15:35] right intentions not to just become some
[15:37] He-Man but they did it for the right
[15:39] intentions they did it because I'm
[15:41] willing when I sign off on this I'm
[15:43] willing to give my life I may not come
[15:45] back home but I'm doing it for my
[15:46] country and I'm doing it for the future
[15:48] preservation of Liberty and so that
[15:51] other ones could live I'll die so they
[15:54] can live
[15:55] who's that sound like to you our Lord
[15:58] and savior I'll go to this cross so they
[16:01] can live in Victory I'll go and take
[16:03] this death so that they can live every
[16:05] day in the power God doesn't want us to
[16:07] die for him he wants us to live for him
[16:10] in the power of the Holy Ghost
[16:13] is that okay with everybody
[16:16] so I want us to think about this a
[16:17] minute and how special that is
[16:19] how special it is when
[16:22] because we lose the feeling it was I
[16:24] want you to and this might be very basic
[16:26] to somebody maybe you were looking for
[16:27] something deeper this morning but I want
[16:29] you to think about how special it is
[16:31] when someone dies so that you can enjoy
[16:36] something in the future
[16:39] that we are living in certain Liberties
[16:40] still today different than other
[16:42] countries lives were taken lives were uh
[16:46] blood was shed can you say Amen blood
[16:50] was shed young people blood a lot of
[16:54] blood was shed for your Liberties
[16:56] tomorrow it's Memorial Day for the blood
[16:59] that was shed and people gave their
[17:01] lives so that you can enjoy your day of
[17:05] hot dogs and hamburgers and volleyball
[17:09] with nobody stepping in and taking say
[17:11] you can't do this
[17:13] people gave their lives for that
[17:15] they shed blood for that their lives
[17:17] were ended lives that could have come
[17:19] home and enjoyed their freedoms but they
[17:22] didn't come home they died and you still
[17:24] have your life there's something about
[17:26] that that it should never become common
[17:30] to us
[17:32] I said it should never become common to
[17:35] us that somebody died so I could live
[17:40] that part should never become common to
[17:43] us
[17:45] the power of a life-giving
[17:49] affecting the future I forgot to read
[17:51] this on Mother's Day or if I read it
[17:54] right now
[17:55] and you say he did read that on Mother's
[17:59] Day
[17:59] then you know I'm having trouble with
[18:02] remembering things
[18:03] but I think I forgot this I think I
[18:06] forgot
[18:08] you see I don't have Alzheimer's I have
[18:10] Alzheimer's
[18:12] I remember half of it
[18:16] I thought this was an amazing Story
[18:18] related to our subject today years ago a
[18:20] young mother was making her way across
[18:22] the Hills of South Wales carrying her
[18:24] tiny baby in her arms when she was
[18:27] overtaken by a blizzard a blinding
[18:29] blizzard she never reached her
[18:30] destination when the blizzard had
[18:32] subsided her body was found by Searchers
[18:34] beneath a mound of snow but they
[18:37] discovered that before her death she had
[18:39] taken off all of her outer clothing and
[18:42] wrapped it around her baby when they
[18:44] unwrapped the child to their great
[18:46] surprise and joy they found he was alive
[18:48] and well she had mounded her body over
[18:51] his and given her life for her child
[18:54] proving the depths of her mother love
[18:57] years later that child David Lloyd
[19:01] George grown to manhood became Prime
[19:04] Minister of Great Britain and without a
[19:06] doubt one of England's greatest
[19:08] Statesmen
[19:11] hour of the future On A Life That's laid
[19:14] down for someone else
[19:16] that was a case of a mother but then
[19:18] there's hundreds of lives can you say
[19:20] Amen that we're willing to say I know
[19:22] I'm going to die over this there's
[19:24] another story that I like I've told it
[19:25] here before this story always moves me
[19:28] to tears it's it's amazing there was a
[19:30] little boy and he was brought into the
[19:32] doctor's office and said his older
[19:33] sister he's only about seven years old
[19:35] his older sister had a rare blood
[19:37] disease and she's about 11 or 12
[19:40] something like that and so they they
[19:42] realize if they took some of the boy's
[19:44] blood then and had a transfusion it
[19:47] would help her and so they brought him
[19:48] in the office and they explained to this
[19:50] young boy that he was that and asked him
[19:52] would you they explained the sister
[19:54] situation and he was already crying a
[19:57] little bit you know he didn't want to
[19:58] lose and his sister and so they said but
[20:00] we can do something here if you give
[20:03] your blood for your sister she can live
[20:05] and so he just stopped and he thought
[20:07] and then his eyes swelled up again with
[20:09] tears and he thought about it just about
[20:11] 30 seconds and he was just crying and he
[20:14] says I'll do it I'll do it and so when
[20:17] they got them on the the two uh beds
[20:20] next to each other to begin this blood
[20:22] transfusion they begin to do it and you
[20:24] could actually see it and this just
[20:26] restore the life of this girl after a
[20:28] few minutes the little boy said to the
[20:30] doctors and to his parents he said and
[20:32] he said and when do I die
[20:36] because he had understood it to be that
[20:39] for her to live he would have to give
[20:41] his blood and at that moment in the
[20:43] office he thought about it he said I'd
[20:45] rather have my sister live
[20:47] I'd rather give my life as a
[20:49] seven-year-old boy so she can go on
[20:51] being happy so she can go on and live
[20:53] she doesn't have to die but I will he
[20:56] made that decision
[20:58] and he said when do I die that honey no
[21:00] we didn't mean for you to die you're
[21:02] you're helping her with your blood but
[21:04] see my I moved in my heart because a
[21:06] young boy was willing to do that for his
[21:09] sister
[21:10] there's something about that in the love
[21:12] of God and Beyond a little boy the love
[21:15] of God is here this morning can you say
[21:17] Amen there's nobody could go to a cross
[21:19] like that unless he had you in mind that
[21:22] you could live in Victory that you can
[21:25] live over habits could you live in the
[21:27] Holy Ghost yes you can can you say Amen
[21:30] there isn't anything that you can't
[21:32] overcome
[21:34] because somebody made a decision
[21:37] because of that Victory I'll go to the
[21:39] cross for them
[21:41] I'll die for them
[21:42] and with him it wasn't just a blood
[21:44] transfusion it was a death and it was a
[21:47] blood transfusion in that the spirit in
[21:49] that blood could come back on them on
[21:51] the day of Pentecost
[21:54] you have the Holy Ghost today it's
[21:55] because he died at the cross
[21:58] split his blood cell by Spirit into his
[22:01] body
[22:02] you say well I'm just a young person you
[22:04] ought to think about that
[22:06] come on now
[22:08] you ought to think about it so I got my
[22:10] life ahead of me and I got this and I
[22:12] I'm looking at this on my phone and I
[22:14] and I got all this and got all my
[22:16] hormones going all this stuff you ought
[22:17] to look at what somebody died for you so
[22:20] that you don't have to have a you have
[22:21] to be a statistic or some young person
[22:23] that's caught up in a spirit of lust
[22:25] your whole life you don't have to live
[22:26] that way you can be filled with the Holy
[22:29] Spirit
[22:29] I said you can be filled with this Holy
[22:32] Spirit as a young man as a young woman
[22:34] and live a holy life unto God because of
[22:37] the cross
[22:39] why do you want to be like the rest of
[22:40] the world why do you want to come with
[22:42] them why do you want to to repeat their
[22:45] comments that you read on the end why do
[22:46] you want to be that everybody's that
[22:49] Christ has called you to be something
[22:51] different in this world mothers and
[22:53] fathers Christ has called you a
[22:54] different family in this world parents
[22:56] of children God's calling you a
[22:58] different home than the rest of this
[22:59] world may you feel the call of Christ
[23:02] this morning
[23:03] something different for your life
[23:05] because what somebody died for you
[23:09] can you raise your hand and say God I
[23:10] thank you somebody died for me I thank
[23:13] you Lord you died for me I don't ever
[23:15] want to lose the feeling somebody died
[23:18] for me
[23:19] it's personal can you say Amen
[23:23] I was looking at last night how many
[23:25] lives total were lost just for our
[23:27] country so that can preserve our
[23:28] freedoms and I have a little visual of
[23:31] it we know that the Civil War was the
[23:33] most lives lost but they counted up and
[23:35] this one lady in this article just this
[23:37] weekend put this together and she was
[23:40] pulling up the lives over the years of
[23:42] all the wars that our country has fought
[23:44] it's amazing how many lives it looks
[23:46] like close to a million the different
[23:48] Wars the Revolutionary War 4 400 War of
[23:51] 1812 Indian Wars Mexican now friends
[23:54] let's not lose the feeling listen this
[23:57] is almost a Million Lives that have been
[23:59] lost over history to preserve the unity
[24:02] and to preserve a country so that you
[24:04] can live all these years in Liberty
[24:05] let's not lose the feeling of it I thank
[24:08] God for these Million Lives
[24:10] they could have gone living like you
[24:12] they could have life raise their
[24:14] grandchild children and grandchildren
[24:16] left and inherit all these other things
[24:18] but they laid down their lives overseas
[24:20] or in our own land and all this and so
[24:23] you know here is something as they go on
[24:25] almost the the Persian Gulf War the
[24:28] global war on terror
[24:30] and and so these are the lives that have
[24:32] been lost these are amazing and I study
[24:36] a little bit the Civil War this is an
[24:37] amazing War to me uh to have almost on
[24:41] our own ground almost a half a million
[24:43] lives lost and to to us in our carnal
[24:47] mind that just seems stupid it seems
[24:49] crazy that we had to have that type of
[24:52] bloody battle and that many of our young
[24:54] men uh and older men got destroyed but
[24:58] you know what that battle it had to be
[25:00] fought
[25:02] there was a lot of tensions in our
[25:04] country can you say Amen there was a lot
[25:06] of things that were wrong in our country
[25:08] and they could have been corrected of
[25:10] course and they they tried different
[25:13] ways to correct it but this tension
[25:15] began to grow it was an internal war and
[25:18] and and and and and and they begin to
[25:20] fight over the things but the problems
[25:22] with our country was not not uh outside
[25:25] problems but it was internal problems
[25:28] with man's heart uh there was problems
[25:31] to break the unity of her these problems
[25:33] would cause the unity in our nation that
[25:36] we would split up into two Nations or
[25:37] many nations or States would become
[25:39] their own so now we had problems but the
[25:42] problems were in our heart racism
[25:44] Prejudice slavery bigotry
[25:48] um uh uh elitism we had problems but I
[25:52] wanna I want you to realize this morning
[25:53] and I know you know this these are
[25:55] problems of the heart
[25:58] these are not things that you can
[26:01] legislate in government to change
[26:04] how arrogant of our government to try to
[26:08] think I've got the new answer every
[26:09] presidential candidate will rise I've
[26:12] got the answer to the problems of our
[26:13] nation without addressing the word of
[26:15] God without going to God you don't have
[26:18] the problems you don't have it solved
[26:20] for these problems and I like what
[26:22] brother Matt said this weekend you think
[26:24] our votes are the thing that puts a man
[26:25] into it we we appreciate the votes and
[26:27] and I vote praise the Lord but it's not
[26:30] by the word of God it's not just our
[26:32] vote that puts a man in it's whether God
[26:34] wants that man in or not God is the
[26:36] ultimate control over it if that offends
[26:39] you then listen now uh I have some more
[26:42] things that can offend you
[26:47] why why do I have to be the one that
[26:49] offends all the time I want to be the
[26:51] nice guy the rest of my life
[26:54] but the anointing of the Holy Ghost says
[26:56] otherwise
[26:57] tell the truth it's God that puts man
[27:00] and brings them down into governments
[27:02] but the arrogance of government say I'm
[27:04] going to fix these problems and back
[27:05] then I want I it's always amazed me
[27:08] about the Civil War
[27:09] and I studied a bit and so many lives at
[27:12] such a deadly bloody battle and the
[27:14] deadliest battle was Gettysburg seven
[27:16] thousand at Gettysburg in that battle
[27:18] and when you watch some of the
[27:21] documentaries and the movies related to
[27:23] Civil War when you watch those things
[27:25] the only thing I conclude is these are
[27:26] real men these you know I think I'm a
[27:28] man these are real men
[27:30] these guys what they did uh to fight and
[27:34] and then losing their lives and just
[27:35] what they went through I went on a civil
[27:38] war tour one time over to Gettysburg
[27:40] those places uh I always conclude these
[27:42] were real men it's hard to find men like
[27:44] this today but they was where real men
[27:46] who fought this way and my point is
[27:48] always that I get out of this is that
[27:50] the document was signed in 1776 which
[27:54] actually would have should have
[27:56] addressed the issue of prejudice in our
[27:59] country it should have addressed it
[28:01] because that document said all men are
[28:03] created equal
[28:05] and you realize you have some of the
[28:06] founding fathers there that still were
[28:08] slave owners we still had slavery and so
[28:11] we have the so now we have a document
[28:12] that should have solved the problem
[28:16] are you listening
[28:18] we have a document that should have
[28:20] solved the problem of prejudice on our
[28:23] country but guess what just having a
[28:25] document doesn't necessarily solve the
[28:28] problems of the heart
[28:31] that's a very important point because
[28:34] all of us even with the word of God just
[28:37] because you have a Bible in your home or
[28:38] in your hand or in your shelf at home
[28:41] doesn't mean your heart problems are
[28:43] solved there's a power in the gospel
[28:46] that changes you can you say Amen
[28:48] there's only the power of the Holy Ghost
[28:50] that changes the heart it's not just
[28:52] that you read your Bible because God
[28:54] gave is the is our victory in the word
[28:56] yes did he write it in here yes is it in
[28:59] the I'm glad it's in the document but
[29:01] there has to be something more than a
[29:02] document 1776 all men are that should
[29:05] have problem they should have laid off
[29:06] slavery down that should solve the
[29:09] division in our country all the other
[29:11] problems as well whether it be racism
[29:13] whatever that the document should have
[29:15] solved it but it didn't and as I studied
[29:17] the Civil War you realize that 87 years
[29:21] later
[29:22] 87 years later is when we have a another
[29:25] thing signed and we we have come through
[29:28] two or three years of a bloody war over
[29:31] this subject the unity of our country
[29:33] the the racism the slavery and so that
[29:37] tension but where's the tension it's in
[29:39] man's heart it took a bloody war
[29:43] to bring it to a head
[29:46] and to solve the problem
[29:48] now we're in another day where the
[29:50] problems of men's Hearts still not
[29:53] solved
[29:55] we don't have slavery in our country but
[29:57] we have a lot of other problems in men's
[29:59] hearts
[30:00] we have violence on the rise can you say
[30:03] Amen we have homes we have a perverted
[30:06] spirit in this world that if you
[30:09] brothers and you sisters are not careful
[30:11] to keep yourself clean a perverted
[30:13] spirit will take your might and your
[30:15] spirit you'll take on a devil's spirit
[30:18] why because our world is perverted and
[30:20] is filled with perverted people
[30:22] Hollywood stars are the worst perverted
[30:24] people ever
[30:28] they're just dirty they're just
[30:30] perverted that's why they make perverted
[30:31] movies
[30:32] because we live in a perverted Spirit
[30:34] you can't solve that with a document
[30:43] War bloody war 87 years later the
[30:47] Emancipation Proclamation
[30:50] and to bring the issue to the Forefront
[30:52] and finally deal with it
[30:54] I'm just going to stop here and say that
[30:56] I use this scenario when I open with my
[30:58] marriage pre-marriage counseling there's
[31:01] a lot of people don't believe in that
[31:03] don't do it
[31:05] but if a couple would come to me and say
[31:07] we would like to talk with you then I'm
[31:09] all there to try to help them brother
[31:11] Brandon the other ministers to have to
[31:13] help them through this
[31:15] most important decision of their lives
[31:18] that they would besides receiving Christ
[31:20] the second most important decision I
[31:22] don't I don't think it should be made
[31:25] shallow or flippantly
[31:27] I think that they should have some
[31:30] counsel in it
[31:32] and I'm prepared not to get
[31:34] all the amens just now but I believe
[31:37] that all along and I've watched
[31:40] most of the marriages that I put
[31:42] together and signed off on to officiate
[31:45] because I don't give away daughters the
[31:47] Dad gives away a daughter but I
[31:49] officiate and if I officiate I'd like to
[31:51] be a little bit involved to ask them a
[31:53] few questions to see where their heart
[31:55] is
[31:58] to see if they're ready
[32:00] and it's not like I'm a big Downer to
[32:03] kill the romance and the love that
[32:06] they're feeling for one another I'm not
[32:08] out to get them but I'm just want to go
[32:11] through a little bit of talking
[32:12] sometimes it's it's two sessions
[32:15] sometimes it's a whole year sessions I'm
[32:17] always thankful for couples willing to
[32:19] do it not be afraid of it because if
[32:21] you're if this is the will of God you
[32:23] shouldn't have anything to hide from one
[32:25] another
[32:26] your heart should be laid out that's the
[32:28] most important decision I want to know
[32:30] and if anybody steps into oh no we're
[32:32] going to do this ourself that's wrong I
[32:35] can show you scripturally that's wrong
[32:37] but I go through this thing and this one
[32:40] thing that I have and it goes through a
[32:43] process but this is what I bring up
[32:45] first before to to have them get
[32:47] confidence is that the Civil War I talk
[32:48] about the Civil War in premarital
[32:50] counseling it's very interesting
[32:54] but I bring this point up they had a
[32:57] document
[32:58] okay they had a document but the
[33:01] document did not solve the problems with
[33:03] the heart
[33:06] so you can approach your marriage that
[33:08] way that if there's unresolved issues of
[33:10] your heart you can ignore them you can
[33:13] go with it uh you probably shouldn't
[33:16] with a 60 divorce rate in our country
[33:19] pushing 70
[33:21] you probably shouldn't do that but it's
[33:23] up to you I'm not going to force you to
[33:25] do it thank God for some who come and do
[33:27] it but it's just uh it's like it's like
[33:29] that that they have the document but I
[33:32] tell them that the heart issue wasn't
[33:34] solved and so now if time would have
[33:36] been taken early on you see now it
[33:39] turned into a bloody war to solve the
[33:41] issue and you can do it that way there's
[33:44] some marriages that survive because they
[33:47] work it all out while they're married
[33:48] and work it out with the Lord and I say
[33:50] praise God when I pray for that I pray
[33:53] for that I'm not pronouncing doom on
[33:55] anybody my own children's marriages
[33:57] anybody I want it to work and there's a
[34:00] lot of things you can't learn before the
[34:02] marriage that you will only learn in
[34:03] marriage I realize that because I've
[34:06] been there done that and got the T-shirt
[34:07] there's things you don't know when you
[34:09] get married okay but but if there's
[34:12] things that you can explore with a
[34:15] trusted man and a trusted couple that
[34:18] you can explore that's unresolved issues
[34:20] in your heart or red flags why not try
[34:24] to deal with those things that's my
[34:26] argument with it why not try to work
[34:28] through it a little bit why not try if
[34:30] there's unresolved if there's pain in
[34:32] the heart you see because these days
[34:34] there's a lot of unresolved pain in the
[34:37] heart there's there's narcissistic men
[34:41] in this world I'm finding it's a spirit
[34:43] a narcissist and in women too a
[34:46] manipulating a man a manipulator he's
[34:49] self-focused he's all about himself and
[34:51] the Holy Ghost has not delivered him
[34:52] from that yet
[34:54] you take a narcissist a man or a woman
[34:56] you put him in a marriage like that it's
[34:58] going to be an explosion it's gonna be
[34:59] rough
[35:01] so and that's one of hundreds of heart
[35:04] issues and so I'm I'm learned through
[35:07] the years to talk about those heart
[35:08] issues from my experience and also from
[35:12] reading books and reading what the
[35:13] scripture says there can be things
[35:15] that's unresolved and I'm sorry I don't
[35:18] go with the theory that says that just
[35:21] says if they got the Holy Ghost they
[35:23] don't need to talk to anybody the Holy
[35:25] Ghost is all they need I'm sorry I've
[35:28] been a pastor way too long they may even
[35:31] have the Holy Ghost but I know people
[35:34] with the Holy Ghost have unresolved
[35:37] heart issues
[35:39] and if you don't know that you haven't
[35:41] you're not you're not thinking deeply
[35:46] I say to them
[35:48] isn't it amazing that 87 years later
[35:51] a bloody war of a half a million lives
[35:54] problems come to the Forefront and then
[35:56] they deal with them so you can do that
[35:58] you can do that
[36:00] but I want to let you know a document a
[36:02] marriage license
[36:04] and a ceremony
[36:07] is not going to solve heart problems
[36:13] and if they're not ready I just like to
[36:15] I take them through
[36:17] you know first two or three chapters of
[36:19] learning do they understand in the
[36:21] scripture what marriage is do you do
[36:23] they understand give and take do they
[36:24] understand what Christian marriage is so
[36:27] they fill out things they answer
[36:28] questions because we assume oh they just
[36:30] understand what a Christian marriage is
[36:33] a lot of times they don't they
[36:35] understand marriage they read it on the
[36:36] internet Pinterest has taught them what
[36:38] marriage is I can't wait let's do it
[36:40] but they don't know under the Bible what
[36:42] a Christian marriage is
[36:43] so I can't assume that they do so take
[36:45] them through that there's a chapter
[36:47] there on important scripturally to have
[36:49] the both parents blessings on the
[36:51] marriage we go through that scripturally
[36:53] then we come into the heart matters and
[36:55] do we deal with things that kind of draw
[36:57] out things unresolved things from their
[36:58] childhood or anything in their heart and
[37:01] if it's unresolved that can become a
[37:03] factor because if this person has a pain
[37:05] that's not been healed by the Lord then
[37:07] this mate will get in the marriage and
[37:09] start stepping on that pain and this
[37:11] person reacts and gets mad or they close
[37:13] in their shell and they're going man I
[37:15] just married this person two years ago
[37:16] they've they've closed off for me
[37:18] they're like a wall I can't get through
[37:20] them there's no Oneness anymore it's
[37:21] because probably you're stepping on her
[37:23] pain every day you or she's stepping on
[37:26] some pain that's unresolved
[37:30] and so we we work through that we work
[37:32] through a chapter on purity
[37:35] because I believe in purity
[37:37] and if you don't think you need to talk
[37:39] about that before marriage you need to
[37:41] talk about it before marriage with all
[37:43] these young guys and young girls and
[37:45] show them scripturally the blessing of
[37:47] going the pure way keeping your hands
[37:49] off of one another until the wedding day
[37:55] Purity and then if you think it's not
[37:56] important to talk about purity after
[37:58] marriage you're crazy
[38:00] because the same Devils that we're
[38:02] working on you as a young person
[38:04] the same Devils that work on you in your
[38:06] marriage
[38:07] they have to know from scripture what
[38:09] Purity is the value of it that I want it
[38:11] because it's God's blessing
[38:14] and go through some other chapters on
[38:16] different things and different things
[38:18] and come to the end and and then I give
[38:21] my summary of what I feel like are going
[38:23] to be some challenges see
[38:27] exposing the devil and these things is
[38:30] half the battle
[38:31] the devil hates it here it is out in the
[38:33] open it hurts it's painful and a lot of
[38:35] times I become the bad guy because I'm
[38:37] bringing them up I'm willing to be the
[38:39] bad guy if you'll talk about it I'll
[38:40] talk about it but all these things went
[38:41] oh this I didn't know this I didn't want
[38:43] to know that about you
[38:46] you see there's a thing in the marriage
[38:47] wall call it says if anybody has any
[38:50] impediment if the two of you have any
[38:51] impediment no of any impediment to
[38:53] disclose it now
[38:55] and it's the congregation anybody let
[38:57] him say so now forever hold his peace
[38:58] I've never heard you may say anything
[39:01] these days probably people should not
[39:03] got something here back in the old
[39:05] English wedding
[39:09] stop
[39:11] he's been married before well that's
[39:13] that's an impediment
[39:15] nobody knew that she's been married
[39:16] before
[39:17] um so the old English wedding is where
[39:19] that wedding ceremony comes from and
[39:22] actually in the Old English church the
[39:24] pastor would get up when the two said
[39:26] they wanted to get married
[39:27] Pastor would get up to the congregation
[39:29] two or three months before and announce
[39:31] they're interested they want to get
[39:32] married two or three months before does
[39:34] anybody know of any impediment or
[39:36] anything in their lives that we don't
[39:37] know about it was to the whole
[39:39] congregation they better disclose it not
[39:41] just at the ceremony it was way before
[39:45] and there was an accountability to the
[39:48] whole congregation wow that's strange
[39:52] well maybe the Holy Ghost is in the
[39:54] congregation and you trust that
[39:59] right thank you
[40:03] Lane I'm not hearing those amens like
[40:05] you were saying that
[40:06] what do you draw in there what are you
[40:08] doing
[40:09] I'm not hearing you amens I need them
[40:11] right now this is the time I need your
[40:13] amens
[40:15] thank you
[40:17] thank you
[40:19] hope he's still saying that when he's 18
[40:21] years old falls in love
[40:25] so um anyway uh so what was I talking
[40:28] about
[40:32] yeah maybe the Holy Ghost is in the
[40:33] church and you you should trust that you
[40:35] can't trust Pinterest you can't trust
[40:37] Google you can't trust the movie stars
[40:39] and maybe you can trust that something
[40:41] the people some of those people have the
[40:43] Holy Ghost
[40:44] and they're out to help you not to hurt
[40:46] you maybe that Pastor has the Holy Ghost
[40:50] maybe he's called to say something that
[40:52] would help
[40:57] so they announced it to everybody and
[40:58] then they announced it at the wedding
[40:59] and then so impediment back then would
[41:01] have been something like they had had
[41:03] relations with somebody before or they
[41:05] were married before and they were hiding
[41:07] it you see they were hiding it but if
[41:08] somebody knew there's no need to hide
[41:10] that this is important that's how
[41:11] important the marriage decision ceremony
[41:13] was back then today it's it's it's
[41:15] finished there it's such a looseness
[41:18] today
[41:20] and I said to some of the I I've said to
[41:24] some of the couples this is
[41:26] it's just you're going to be married
[41:28] this week do you understand what you're
[41:31] going to stay in the marriage vow do you
[41:33] understand it
[41:35] if you don't understand anything else do
[41:36] you understand what you're going to say
[41:37] before God in that congregation if you
[41:39] understand that by Revelation I think
[41:41] your marriage will be okay but if you
[41:42] don't understand it it's just a day you
[41:44] get lost in the fluff of it
[41:47] and you say those vows and you don't
[41:48] mean them or you don't know what they
[41:50] mean
[41:51] it's a commitment for life
[41:54] in sickness and in health
[41:56] for richer for poor
[41:59] fat skinny oh that's that's not in there
[42:02] is it
[42:05] you're going to live out those vows
[42:08] you better know what they mean
[42:10] so the point is is that
[42:12] heart changes are important
[42:15] and heart things can be there and a lot
[42:18] of times I suggest to this because
[42:20] they're not ready they think they're
[42:23] ready
[42:25] but let's ask the Lord if they're ready
[42:30] they decide they're ready okay
[42:34] they're not ready if they're 17 18 19
[42:37] years old they're not ready
[42:39] and that's for my own kids too
[42:42] Gabi if you're listening
[42:44] you may be sick but you're getting
[42:45] preached on this morning it goes for my
[42:47] own children to you're 17 18 19 years
[42:50] old for the most part let me qualify
[42:52] that for the most part you're not ready
[42:54] but the only thing ready is your
[42:56] hormones
[42:58] and that's why you want it so bad
[43:01] that's the only thing ready is your
[43:02] hormones
[43:05] but takes more of a marriage more to a
[43:07] marriage then your hormones being ready
[43:12] usually they're not ready financially
[43:14] they're not ready emotionally they're
[43:16] not ready in a lot of ways in those ages
[43:18] they mature at age 21 there's a big jump
[43:21] in maturity that's scientifically now in
[43:24] the brain they take a big step they say
[43:27] they choose different sometimes two
[43:28] different choose different mates if
[43:30] they're over 21 than what they would if
[43:32] they're 17 18 because you just mature in
[43:34] your mind 25 once again
[43:36] so you know I'm marrying people you can
[43:38] come to me about 30 years old about the
[43:40] top of that is that a good deal
[43:43] just kidding
[43:51] the document doesn't mean that the heart
[43:53] problems are solved
[43:54] can you say man took a lot of time on
[43:57] that because I felt led of the Lord to
[43:58] do it
[43:59] because a bloody war was fought and
[44:03] lives were given and a destruction
[44:05] almost of our country almost come to
[44:07] complete destruction to try to fight
[44:10] battles over heart things
[44:12] documents don't solve the problems just
[44:15] like the Bible doesn't solve it message
[44:17] books does not guarantee solving
[44:20] heart problems
[44:22] you can have every one of them you can
[44:24] have the app on your phone and you
[44:26] better be into it listening to it with a
[44:27] sincere heart and connecting with the
[44:29] Christ that's in it because if it's just
[44:30] a book or it's just an app on your phone
[44:33] it doesn't guarantee solving your heart
[44:35] problems
[44:37] blood has to be shed sometimes life has
[44:39] to be given to bring results we want
[44:41] something real from God how many would
[44:43] raise your hand this morning if you
[44:45] still love me I'm going to raise your
[44:46] hand say I want something real for me I
[44:49] want something real for my children I
[44:52] want something real from almighty God I
[44:55] don't want to be disconnected from the
[44:56] meaning of Calvary somebody gave their
[44:59] life for me
[45:00] and I want to live
[45:02] in in appreciation see that's what it is
[45:05] is that when young people tomorrow don't
[45:07] appreciate the lives that we're given
[45:08] there's no detached from it then they
[45:10] don't appreciate they're not grateful
[45:12] for the lives that we're given we need
[45:14] to be grateful can you say man we need
[45:16] to stay in constant appreciation and
[45:19] gratefulness
[45:21] for somebody who died for us can you say
[45:24] Amen my brothers and sisters God bless
[45:26] you amen we want something real
[45:28] interesting thing that she the lady
[45:30] Megan Krieger said in this article
[45:32] talking about the the lives that were
[45:35] lost she said not long ago most
[45:36] Americans were likely to know an active
[45:39] military service a service member many
[45:42] of our young people many Americans knew
[45:44] somebody but today because of the
[45:45] factors like political cost of launching
[45:47] a military draft and the increasing
[45:49] Automation and Outsourcing of
[45:50] military-related tasks fewer Americans
[45:53] have a personal connection to some
[45:56] in the armed
[45:59] Armed Force during World War to about 12
[46:01] percent of the total U.S population were
[46:03] part of the Armed Forces according to
[46:05] the Census Bureau and Department of
[46:07] Defense and while fewer service
[46:09] ministers while fewer service members
[46:12] enlisted during the Vietnam era the
[46:15] conflicts draft cut across American
[46:17] society explains Gala through a medical
[46:20] a medical person uh over the Department
[46:23] of Veterans Affairs she talked she talks
[46:27] with veterans primarily those who fought
[46:29] most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq
[46:32] and explores ways to use narrative as a
[46:35] tool for mental health care even though
[46:37] there's so much talk about the
[46:38] opposition and difficult experiences
[46:41] that Vietnam veterans had come coming
[46:43] home with protests there was still a
[46:46] sense that people were very close to
[46:48] someone who had served or knew somebody
[46:51] who had served she said today out of a
[46:55] nation of nearly 329 million people
[46:59] 1.3 million Americans are in active duty
[47:02] military and another 800 000 serve in
[47:05] the reserves according to the Department
[47:06] of Defense that small figure influences
[47:09] the way the general public thinks about
[47:11] the cost of the conflict
[47:15] see disconnected from the cost
[47:18] disconnected that somebody gave their
[47:20] life for me
[47:22] more and more the new generation when
[47:24] they become disconnected from that they
[47:26] don't have an appreciation and a
[47:28] gratefulness for the Liberties they have
[47:31] disconnected that small figure influence
[47:33] is the way the general public thinks
[47:35] about the cost of the conflict in our
[47:37] society we've seen the real ship she
[47:39] said now now less than one percent of
[47:42] our population has served
[47:45] the experience of going to war and
[47:47] coming home we don't have we don't have
[47:50] as much awareness of it we have a
[47:53] disconnect in our society about what's
[47:55] going on who has served and what they
[47:59] experienced
[48:01] I thought that was very interesting to
[48:04] show the lack of connect to somebody
[48:08] died for me so that I could enjoy this
[48:12] there's a detachment
[48:14] there was a there's many moms who had
[48:17] their kid go away to war and never come
[48:20] back home their their son dies their son
[48:23] never come home
[48:24] and she's that mom being related to that
[48:29] son that's her son and he never came
[48:31] back home from war she's going to feel
[48:33] that
[48:35] she's going to feel that personally
[48:37] she's going to do a lot of crying she's
[48:39] got to do a lot of weeping if she's like
[48:41] most of them they are prouder of their
[48:43] country and they're proud that their son
[48:45] has served but you don't get around the
[48:47] fact of the feeling of being hurt
[48:49] being completely oh my son is gone my
[48:52] son gave his life and you don't think
[48:55] they think sometimes all these boys and
[48:57] young men walking around enjoying their
[48:59] cars and enjoying their Liberties and
[49:01] her son died so they could enjoy them
[49:05] feels it can you say Amen
[49:07] and and so but they're saying in the
[49:09] start of that people feel it less and
[49:11] less because they don't have a family
[49:13] member who went and didn't come back and
[49:15] they don't have a they don't know
[49:16] anybody a very small person knows
[49:19] somebody that served and died when they
[49:21] know somebody it's kind of like my
[49:24] friend he he died over there
[49:29] they forget somebody died for them they
[49:31] don't know someone who died for them if
[49:34] you have someone step in front of you
[49:36] and take a bullet young man what if
[49:38] you're standing there
[49:40] maybe downtown New York like I was this
[49:43] week a little nervous about New York
[49:45] wasn't bad but when you hear the things
[49:47] coming out of the news a little nervous
[49:49] and somebody can step out with a gun
[49:52] and what if you were standing there
[49:54] somebody steps out with a gun and they
[49:56] point it right at you and your your
[49:59] buddy that's sitting next to you today
[50:00] your buddy seen what was going to happen
[50:03] and jumped out and took the bullet for
[50:05] you
[50:06] and died
[50:09] and you had to go to the funeral of that
[50:11] friend
[50:12] I would say that you were feeling
[50:15] what your friend did for you
[50:18] and I would say that it would affect you
[50:21] so much emotionally you would cry even
[50:23] as a man you would cry and realize my
[50:26] buddy took the bullet for me and now I'm
[50:29] going to live my life in appreciation
[50:31] I'd say at that funeral you're going to
[50:33] be telling the story
[50:35] of your friend and you're going to be
[50:37] living your life in honor in honor and
[50:40] appreciation for what he did for you
[50:42] because you wouldn't be breathing unless
[50:44] he took that bullet for you I want to
[50:46] tell you young poor people this morning
[50:48] and every person under the sound of my
[50:49] voice there's a man Jesus Christ who
[50:52] took the bullet for you
[50:53] two thousand years ago he took the
[50:55] bullet for you you deserve to die in
[50:58] your sin you deserve to pay for your
[51:00] sins those little sins are big sins that
[51:02] you do that should come on you and you
[51:04] should die for that but I'm here to tell
[51:06] you somebody took the bullet for you
[51:11] and the very least that you could do you
[51:13] should give them all the least you could
[51:15] do is come to an altar and say I give my
[51:18] life back
[51:20] I'll be baptized in the name of Jesus
[51:23] Christ I'll be filled with the Holy
[51:25] Spirit and the rest of my life belongs
[51:27] to Jesus Christ because he took the
[51:29] bullet for me
[51:31] he took my sins
[51:35] blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:40] I just feel
[51:41] moved
[51:43] by the Lord this morning
[51:46] and I feel grateful
[51:49] and there's some more here
[52:00] somebody died for you
[52:04] no matter what you think of Paul
[52:05] LaFontaine or this church or your
[52:08] neighbor said Ninja
[52:10] why is that important
[52:13] I would say if you had the reality of
[52:16] this hit you
[52:18] then it would make you love others not
[52:21] according to the flesh
[52:25] hatred would be purged
[52:28] in our hearts
[52:30] when we know what this man has done for
[52:33] us
[52:35] our minds as brother Matt talked about
[52:38] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[52:41] and that means everybody's mind
[52:43] including mine
[52:45] left by itself it's it's a it's a it's
[52:49] an enemy of the leadership of God
[52:52] constantly whether it's lust or whether
[52:55] it's you know everything above everybody
[52:57] else it's carnality and it's an enemy of
[52:59] God
[53:00] and if all of us have that if all of us
[53:03] have that there has to be something
[53:05] stronger come from this man that died
[53:07] for us that would be powerful enough to
[53:10] purge us
[53:11] and have a power to overcome and be
[53:14] transformed by the renewing of our minds
[53:17] does that really count today what you
[53:18] think about other churches and what you
[53:20] think about situations how important is
[53:24] that
[53:26] it's way down here
[53:29] compared to what God has done for you
[53:31] and how he wants you to live
[53:34] I'd say when this Revelation strikes you
[53:37] I'd say there's an overwhelming love
[53:43] for everybody
[53:48] including me
[53:50] I say there's no way overwhelming love
[53:52] in it for all of us
[53:55] and for me to love everybody
[53:58] including you
[54:01] including all of you
[54:03] I don't have a right to be selective
[54:07] somebody died for me
[54:10] so I can live for him today
[54:13] I got a bunch more here but I feel the
[54:16] Holy Spirit saying we should pray now
[54:21] do you mind standing
[54:25] I was listening to a sermon on Pardon
[54:28] last night 1963
[54:33] and
[54:35] the story that he he told in that sermon
[54:37] was
[54:40] foreign
[54:42] man in the Civil War a service man was
[54:46] supposed to be on duty
[54:48] and he got a little bit afraid I think
[54:51] of the guns shooting and so he just ran
[54:54] away
[54:55] and they caught him and they said you're
[54:57] guilty of deserting your post of Duty so
[55:00] you're going before the firing squad
[55:02] and a friend ran and found Abraham
[55:05] Lincoln and begged him to stop the
[55:07] carriage and they stopped and he says I
[55:09] have a friend he was supposed to be in
[55:11] the line of duty he got sidetracked let
[55:13] me tell you friends how many of you get
[55:15] sidetracked from your line of duty
[55:17] sometimes just about six of us all right
[55:22] he got sidetracked from where he was
[55:24] supposed to be and he's going from
[55:25] before the firing spot in that day you
[55:27] deserved it because you don't leave your
[55:29] post to duty
[55:31] please it's my friend he got on a Sneezy
[55:33] beg to say please they're putting him
[55:35] before the fire Squad please do
[55:36] something for him and Abraham Lincoln
[55:39] said it started to tear up
[55:41] took something wrote out he says I
[55:43] pardon this man what's his name I pardon
[55:45] him I give him a pardon you know he took
[55:47] him back to the jail here he's in
[55:49] shackles he's changed he's getting ready
[55:51] to go before the firing squad
[55:53] and he gives out with Abraham's own
[55:55] signature on it
[55:58] remember I said a document
[56:01] doesn't really mean anything
[56:04] unless it's received
[56:07] unless you realize the significance of
[56:09] it he could have got happy he said oh
[56:11] that's neat I got a thing with Abraham
[56:13] Lincoln's signature on and he could have
[56:15] said he could have been real happy and
[56:17] he could but instead he turned against
[56:20] it he said listen I don't believe that
[56:23] that's not real
[56:25] so he went before the firing squad and
[56:27] he got shot
[56:28] they took it to the court to make sure
[56:30] that the military was acting right and
[56:32] what they did not just killing just a a
[56:35] man like this and so they kept hashing
[56:37] over it and they'd concluded that a
[56:40] pardon even though this is a real pardon
[56:42] it's not good unless it's accepted as a
[56:46] pardon by the person
[56:50] and brother Bram says in that message he
[56:51] says a pardon is not just
[56:54] pardon he says it's a release
[56:57] a pardon is a complete freedom and a
[57:00] release from bondage if that man would
[57:03] have said I accept this as real they
[57:05] would have taken his shackles off
[57:08] he wouldn't have died in the firing
[57:10] squad and he would have without shouting
[57:12] and rejoicing I'm free I'm free because
[57:14] somebody wrote my pardon
[57:17] that's what he could have got out of the
[57:18] pardon but he didn't get that out of the
[57:19] pardon because he didn't see the meaning
[57:21] of the pardon
[57:23] he didn't see the significance of it
[57:24] that's what our Lord has done for us
[57:27] and a pardon is not just a piece of
[57:29] paper it's not just what the Lord said
[57:31] two thousand years ago when he said it
[57:32] is finished it's not just it's the
[57:34] reality of it it's your release it's
[57:37] your Victory can you say man
