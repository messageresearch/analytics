[2:27] you know when when you think about the
[2:28] book of Philippians in in the Apostle
[2:31] Paul is writing there and he's talking
[2:34] about I can do all things through Christ
[2:36] and everything but I want I want you to
[2:39] notice where he was writing that book he
[2:41] was in prison
[2:43] so just think about it
[2:45] your situation this morning you may
[2:48] think you know it's like you know I'm
[2:49] going through sickness I'm going through
[2:51] tribulations I'm I'm going through
[2:52] family situations but
[2:55] Paul in the midst of all of that he said
[2:58] I can do all things through Christ so
[3:00] what can we say this morning I'm not in
[3:03] prison amen I I I'm alive I'm I'm well I
[3:08] can breathe so what can I say this
[3:10] morning I can do all things through
[3:12] Christ amen so we're grateful to be in
[3:15] the house of the Lord so if you have
[3:16] your Bibles uh we can take our Bibles
[3:19] and go to the Book of Psalms chapter 36
[3:25] just pray for me amen this morning is
[3:28] always
[3:29] you know that
[3:31] being nervous and what are we going to
[3:33] say and Lord how we're going to bring it
[3:35] it has to be in the right Spirit the
[3:37] right atmosphere and everything so just
[3:39] pray with me and for me this morning
[3:45] Psalms 36 uh verse 5 through 10.
[3:50] and Psalm 63 verse 7.
[3:55] in Psalms 36 verse 5 reads like this die
[3:59] Mercy O Lord
[4:02] thy mercy O Lord is in in the heavens
[4:04] and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the
[4:08] clouds
[4:09] thy righteousness is like the great
[4:11] mountains thy judgments are a great deep
[4:15] oh Lord the upper service men and Beast
[4:19] how excellent is thy loving kindness oh
[4:22] God therefore the children of men put
[4:26] their trust under the shadow of thy
[4:29] wings
[4:30] they shall be abundantly satisfied
[4:33] satisfied with the fatness of thy house
[4:36] and thou shall make them drink of the
[4:38] river of thy Pleasures for with thee is
[4:42] the Fountain of Life in thy light shall
[4:46] we see light
[4:48] or continue that loving loving kindness
[4:51] unto them that Know Thee and thy
[4:53] righteousness to the upright in heart
[4:56] you may have your sins
[4:58] then Psalm 63 verse 7.
[5:05] and then is is a
[5:08] here it says because thou has been
[5:12] my help therefore in the shadow of thy
[5:16] Wings will I Rejoice therefore in the
[5:20] shadow of the of your wings will I
[5:22] rejoice and this morning by God's grace
[5:24] we can talk about Under The Shadow
[5:28] of thy wings
[5:30] under the shadow of thy Wings you know
[5:33] meditating in this phrase this morning
[5:37] you know David expressing himself and
[5:40] and he will say in the shadow of your
[5:43] wings hide me under the shadow of your
[5:46] wings so this morning by God's grace we
[5:49] can meditate on that what does it mean
[5:52] to be on there under the shadow of his
[5:55] wings
[5:56] you know Danny we go back to Psalms uh
[5:59] chapter
[6:01] 17. David is writing here in um if you
[6:07] you know when when you look at the
[6:08] different Psalms they have they have a
[6:11] purpose and they they they were written
[6:13] at a specific time in life of the people
[6:17] that were writing them amen so if if we
[6:20] read Psalm 17 chapter 8 8 17 and verse 8
[6:24] it says keep me as the apple of the eye
[6:29] hide me under the shadow of thy Wings
[6:32] this is David and then from the wicked
[6:36] that oppressed me from from deathly
[6:38] enemies who come past me about so now
[6:41] what was happening or why did David
[6:44] write this song and then I I went back a
[6:46] little bit of history on this song he
[6:48] was writing this song in the midst of
[6:51] crisis
[6:53] in the midst of a crisis that he was
[6:55] going through he says Lord hide me under
[6:58] the shadow of thy Wings amen can can
[7:01] that be our prayer this morning Lord
[7:03] hide me under the shadow of thy wings
[7:06] that doesn't mean that my circumstance
[7:09] is Gonna Change what it means is I'm
[7:11] gonna be hidden under the shadow of your
[7:14] protection Lord that's what I want this
[7:17] morning amen let's let this be a
[7:19] reminder that in whatever situation we
[7:22] may be this morning as the storm of
[7:24] sickness family situations financially
[7:27] stress raged against us we can have the
[7:30] same prayer as David hide new Lord how
[7:33] many is that is your prayer this morning
[7:35] Lord hide me oh Lord Keep Me O Lord
[7:38] Praise protect me that's my prayer Lord
[7:44] hide me under the shadow of your wings
[7:47] Lord
[7:48] and then if you read Psalms 91
[7:51] Psalms 91 verse 1 through 4 it says he
[7:55] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[7:58] mosque shall abide under the shadow of
[8:02] the Almighty
[8:04] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[8:07] and he is my Fortress he is my God in
[8:11] him will I trust
[8:13] surely he shall deliver the Liberty From
[8:16] The Snare of the Fowler and from the
[8:20] noise the noise on pestilence and then
[8:24] he shall cover thee with with his
[8:26] feathers and under his wings shall thou
[8:30] Trust his truth
[8:33] and if I if I if we can say you know we
[8:36] may think that all the Psalms were
[8:37] written by David but this Psalm
[8:39] specifically was written by Moses
[8:43] and if you read the entire Psalm then
[8:46] he's talking about a pestilence wasn't
[8:49] he the leader in Egypt from pestilence
[8:52] he was so now he's able to write this
[8:55] and he says but that's what he's saying
[8:57] he shall covered it with his feathers
[8:59] and under his wings shall thou trust his
[9:02] truth shall be thy shield and Buckler
[9:06] and I was thinking well okay with the
[9:08] shield that that's a shield and there's
[9:10] the partner but if you look if you study
[9:13] that in ancient times shields were very
[9:15] large
[9:17] and they were used to hide behind during
[9:20] an attack usually from arrows or spears
[9:24] that were being thrown by the enemy but
[9:26] the popular was a small Shield that
[9:29] usually fit on the wrist or forearm of
[9:31] the soldier and was used to in hand in
[9:34] hand to come in it for combat amen so
[9:38] it's in that wonderful to know Lord I
[9:41] can trust when the big
[9:43] comeback when the big bottle is coming I
[9:47] know that I can trust you I know that
[9:49] you are my shield and then when the
[9:51] little ones may come against me I know
[9:53] that you are my Buckler
[9:56] but then you look here it's like when
[9:59] he's saying under his windshield that
[10:02] trust and then he's saying his truth
[10:05] didn't Jesus said I am the truth I am
[10:08] the life I am the way then Moses is
[10:12] writing his truth he's gonna be my my
[10:15] shield his word is gonna be my butler
[10:19] his truth will be my peace his truth who
[10:23] will be the one that is going is going
[10:25] to sustain me through the in the time of
[10:27] the drought
[10:29] amen
[10:34] I'm shaking but I'm okay
[10:40] it's like we're amongst family man
[10:43] he's gonna talk as if we're having a
[10:45] conversation but then it's not exciting
[10:47] amen
[10:48] you want to be screaming and you want to
[10:50] cap people people's attention amen
[10:53] but help us Lord this morning amen now
[10:56] there was uncertainty sir from what uh
[10:59] talking about Ruth
[11:01] there was uncertainty from what she was
[11:03] going to be while she was going from
[11:05] Moab to Bethlehem
[11:08] the only person she she was acquainted
[11:10] to was her mother-in-law what a lot she
[11:13] had
[11:15] so that was a good mother-in-law amen
[11:18] and many love their mother-in-laws amen
[11:23] she might have had many questions you
[11:25] know Ruth may have had so many questions
[11:28] she was like is this true
[11:30] am I making the right choice
[11:32] is this real
[11:35] you can have the same questions this
[11:37] morning what am I doing here
[11:40] is this true is this message true is
[11:43] this Bible true is this real is God
[11:46] alive today
[11:48] can my complexes be dealt with this
[11:51] morning can the past hurt be healed can
[11:56] broken relationships be restored
[11:59] oh we can say praise the lord we go by
[12:03] faith and we don't go about by side we
[12:06] go back by a true experience another
[12:08] religion amen because religion has
[12:11] failed us time and time again because
[12:13] what is religion is just the covering
[12:16] these peace because when you start
[12:17] thinking about something from a
[12:19] religious perspective or a religious
[12:22] Duty it becomes like what is other
[12:23] people gonna say about me if I am if I
[12:26] dress this way or if I if I do this in
[12:28] my life
[12:29] but when you see as a relationship with
[12:33] God you're not gonna do it by what
[12:35] people is going to think about it just
[12:37] you're gonna do it out of love to your
[12:39] heavenly father that's a different thing
[12:41] amen religion and an experience a
[12:44] relationship
[12:46] amen
[12:47] we go by faith we go we don't go by
[12:50] sight because if we if it were by side
[12:52] long time ago we would have been left on
[12:55] the side of the road how many can say
[12:56] Amen to that but his Amazing Grace had
[12:59] kept us so far amen so that's what we're
[13:02] here this morning you know certainly
[13:03] this stress and under a lot of pressure
[13:06] but the Lord is good this morning amen
[13:08] and I can give you a little testimony
[13:10] here my family experience uh and I I
[13:13] have shared this with some of some of
[13:15] you but like remember hearing the
[13:16] testimony of my grandpa
[13:19] in my grandpa since his early childhood
[13:22] became an orphan
[13:23] and for sure he was rejected and he
[13:27] lived in in the streets when he was six
[13:29] years old I was talking to my mom he was
[13:30] like well you know you when after his
[13:33] mom like my mom's Grandma after she
[13:35] passed then they were they were they
[13:37] went to live with one of my grandpa's
[13:39] sisters and then the the husband didn't
[13:43] like my grandpa so they were kicked out
[13:46] so they they so they were they were like
[13:49] in the streets when he was six years old
[13:51] so I was just thinking Lord how is it
[13:54] possible that a a young child or like a
[13:57] six-year-old he was able to accomplish
[14:00] so what he was able to accomplish
[14:02] but you know as he grew up he became a
[14:05] successful businessman and but then in
[14:07] his late 20s he was in the porch of his
[14:10] home he was thinking about about life
[14:13] and then he was thinking about how empty
[14:16] he was
[14:17] and perhaps he was ready to take his
[14:20] life
[14:20] but Jesus went by his house
[14:23] Jesus went by his house I won that this
[14:27] morning if if you're in need may Jesus
[14:29] come by your house may he come and
[14:31] change your situation amen
[14:34] you know he was getting ready you know
[14:37] life is is worth nothing living in the
[14:39] condition that he was living but then
[14:42] there was this sister who was a prayer
[14:44] Warrior
[14:45] say man
[14:48] she used Bye by he she just passed by
[14:50] his house and reviewed those recital
[14:53] thoughts without knowing that Grandpa
[14:57] was dealing with those thoughts
[14:59] he just said I rebuke them in the name
[15:01] of Jesus
[15:03] and he said you know but what was
[15:06] happening here after that he was a
[15:08] leader he he gave his heart to Lord and
[15:10] then he became a missionary for the Lord
[15:12] and then he he became a you know Pastor
[15:14] in everything
[15:16] why is that praise the Lord because my
[15:19] grandpa he he was here under the shadow
[15:23] of the almighty God
[15:25] if he wouldn't have lived I wouldn't be
[15:27] here this morning
[15:28] amen what can we say that that is that
[15:32] the purpose of God cannot be defeated if
[15:35] you're here this morning is because God
[15:38] has a purpose for your life you know and
[15:40] we hear that over and over and over
[15:42] again but it's like we have it has to
[15:44] become a revelation to our hearts that
[15:47] Lord you have a purpose for my life and
[15:49] if you don't know your purpose ask him
[15:51] Lord show me your purpose
[15:54] there is a purpose for your life can you
[15:57] believe that this morning we might get
[15:59] discouraged for example you know think
[16:01] about David he got discouraged but he
[16:03] was able to always go to the greatest
[16:05] source of strength and I invite you to
[16:09] go there this morning if you feel this
[16:11] courage come to Christ come to the
[16:13] Fountain of Life as we as we as we read
[16:16] in the life we will see light
[16:20] oh we can say Jesus do not pass me by
[16:24] and I'll think about Ruth
[16:27] you know she was
[16:30] going from a place where she she was
[16:32] used to everything and she was going
[16:34] going to another place where everything
[16:36] was foreign to you was foreign to her
[16:38] everything was new to her the Traditions
[16:41] everything was new to her but now she
[16:43] went out from out from her people to a
[16:45] land that she didn't know but when she
[16:47] gets to Bethlehem the people were
[16:49] looking at her past
[16:52] people were looking at her past people
[16:55] were looking at her lineage you know she
[16:58] she was she was uh related to to Lord in
[17:01] one of his daughters right so that that
[17:03] was not a good name for her to have but
[17:06] she came to the right place she came to
[17:08] the house of the The House of the the
[17:11] bread of of God Amen
[17:13] but you know the people there the
[17:16] religious community they couldn't see
[17:18] beyond that
[17:19] amen they couldn't see beyond that but
[17:21] how great is when she met boas she
[17:24] looked beyond that he saw the potentials
[17:26] that were in her
[17:29] how great he sees it is that when you
[17:32] come to the Lord certainly the religious
[17:35] world you know they are looking at your
[17:37] past or or where or where your parents
[17:39] were coming from but the lord of the
[17:42] land or Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[17:45] he's looking beyond my faults he's
[17:48] looking at the seed that he that has
[17:50] been deposited in my heart
[17:52] and more than that he's in he's looking
[17:55] at the Royal seed he's looking that you
[17:58] are a child of God
[17:59] and he wants to deal with your complexes
[18:02] he wants to deal with any areas in your
[18:05] life because people may focus more like
[18:07] on the spiritual realm but I can tell
[18:10] you when you are kind of in the daily
[18:11] living you have to deal with that as
[18:13] well
[18:17] you know nobody wanted her you know when
[18:19] she when she went to the field nobody
[18:21] wanted her nobody wanted to talk to her
[18:26] if you look at the Book of Ruth
[18:28] he can be divided in four parts and if
[18:30] you have this coffee version of your
[18:32] Bible there are four parts that the Book
[18:35] of Ruth is divided and the first section
[18:38] is root decides
[18:41] amen there is brother Brandon says there
[18:43] is four stations or for uh Junctions in
[18:46] Ruth and Boaz the first is Ruth is
[18:49] deciding
[18:50] amen she had to decide
[18:53] and and then he says well all of you I
[18:55] guess I I I've had it he says she had to
[18:58] decide whether she was going to go into
[19:01] the land or not
[19:03] so that's the message for us this
[19:05] morning you have to decide whether you
[19:06] want to be here or not
[19:08] whether you want to serve the Lord or
[19:10] not or you you are just kind of wasting
[19:13] your time
[19:14] you have to decide you know we think I
[19:17] have decided to follow Jesus have you
[19:20] decided really
[19:22] amen so she whether she was going to the
[19:24] land or not with Naomi she had to make a
[19:27] decision then after she got there the
[19:30] next thing she had to do she had to
[19:32] serve in the field above us and there he
[19:35] was there barefooted and gleaning behind
[19:38] the Reapers and serving and then after
[19:40] she cut she had found Grace in in the
[19:43] sight of Boaz
[19:44] she had to wait
[19:47] isn't that amazing you know the Lord we
[19:49] come to church you decide you come with
[19:51] all that fire and then you you you're
[19:53] serving and then the Lord asks you to
[19:55] wait
[19:56] he's like Lord you want me to wait I
[19:58] have been coming to this church for so
[20:00] many years and now you want me to wait
[20:01] well that was what happened with Ruth so
[20:04] now she's not a foreigner to us anymore
[20:06] so if it applied to her it applies to us
[20:08] this morning
[20:10] there are prayers that you have been
[20:12] that you have been that you have been
[20:15] having for years and you just have to
[20:17] wait
[20:19] amen after she had found Grace in the
[20:22] sight of boa she had to wait amen and
[20:26] then after she waited then she was
[20:28] rewarded amen so the first the first one
[20:31] what was it she cut she needed to decide
[20:34] whether she wanted to stay in Moab or
[20:36] she wanted to go with her mother-in-law
[20:37] and then she had to serve when she came
[20:40] to to Bethlehem now she was serving in
[20:43] the fields of Allah say man and then she
[20:45] had to wait why because Boaz had to do
[20:47] some work in order for him to be fully
[20:50] redeemed
[20:51] and then after that she was rewarded
[20:54] that's the same condition that we we are
[20:57] this morning you may be in your deciding
[21:00] face maybe this morning that you want to
[21:02] serve the Lord you don't want to serve
[21:04] the Lord but hey make a choice
[21:09] now
[21:11] in the Book of Ruth second chapter verse
[21:14] 10.
[21:15] and he's like why is he talking about
[21:17] about Ruth uh I'll tell you why I'm
[21:20] talking because we're remember that
[21:22] we're talking about Under The Shadow of
[21:24] Your Wings amen
[21:26] now in a second chapter of the Book of
[21:30] Ruth verse 10 it says then she fell on
[21:33] her face and bowed herself to the ground
[21:35] and said unto him why have I found Grace
[21:38] in thine eyes that thou shouldest take
[21:42] knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger
[21:45] what is that if you just think about
[21:47] this verse here what is that it is a
[21:49] sign of reverence and submission she
[21:52] went to defeat aboas
[21:54] as soon as the first time she went to
[21:57] her feet to his fate and and she said
[21:59] why have I found Grace in thy side
[22:02] in Boaz verse 11 and Boaz answer and
[22:05] said unto her it had fully been showed
[22:07] me all that thou has done unto thy
[22:10] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[22:12] husband and how that has left thy father
[22:15] and thine mother in the land of that
[22:17] Nativity and art come onto a people
[22:20] which thou knows not heretofore
[22:24] what now what's this verse she had a
[22:28] testimony even though she hasn't been a
[22:30] long time in the land she had a
[22:33] testimony
[22:34] it's like well you you already refused
[22:36] to be in Moab you decided to follow your
[22:39] mother-in-law now I can appreciate
[22:42] something someone like that
[22:44] many many times people see our testimony
[22:47] and they can tell many good things
[22:49] but we only see our faults and our
[22:52] shortcomings
[22:55] amen like the spies when they they came
[22:58] back from exploring the land they saw
[23:00] themselves as grasshoppers while they
[23:02] have testify about them as a mighty Army
[23:08] it you know it depends on the
[23:10] perspective on how you're seeing
[23:12] yourself the Lord is seeing you as an
[23:15] overcomer and it will be up to you how
[23:18] you see yourself
[23:20] amen help us learn to change our
[23:22] perspective amen what is my testimony
[23:25] today can people testify on who you are
[23:28] can people see that you have been with
[23:31] the Lord
[23:33] may that be my testimony this morning
[23:35] Lord that people when I leave this
[23:37] building may people can see that I have
[23:40] been with you that I have had an
[23:42] encounter with you Lord
[23:45] everything is about perspective
[23:49] in verse 12 it says the Lord recompense
[23:52] thy Work in a full reward be given thee
[23:56] of the Lord God of Israel and then he's
[23:59] saying under whose wings Thou Art come
[24:02] to trust
[24:04] why why does Boaz said under whose wings
[24:08] thou has come to trust because under his
[24:11] wings there is a shadow there is a shade
[24:15] there is protection in this case
[24:18] specifically talking about Boaz and Ruth
[24:21] it says in in this case it refers to
[24:24] under someone Superior than her
[24:28] in other words Boaz was proposing to
[24:32] Ruth
[24:35] it was a proposal from Boaz to Ruth it's
[24:38] like seriously is there is there a
[24:40] proposal I will show you
[24:43] but he was asking her do you want me to
[24:46] be your provider
[24:48] do you want me to be your protector
[24:50] do you want me to be your husband do you
[24:53] want me to be your headship
[24:57] amen
[24:58] he was asking her that
[25:02] amen
[25:04] but she didn't immediately responded
[25:06] with that yes but she answered verse 13
[25:09] she said let me find favor in thy side
[25:12] let me do some work so that you see
[25:15] what's in my heart and then we will talk
[25:19] that's for you young men and you young
[25:21] sister let you see let let her show you
[25:25] some some some some things you know
[25:27] things in in terms of how does she
[25:29] manage a house
[25:31] does she know how to cook
[25:35] does he know how to work
[25:41] but Boaz was working
[25:43] he had already money
[25:46] and she was there just like well let me
[25:48] show you what I can do let me show you
[25:49] that I can make bread let me show you
[25:51] that I can
[25:53] make flour tortillas
[25:57] that's how we said in Mexico you know
[26:00] show me that and then we'll see we can
[26:02] talk
[26:04] my wife can make good tortillas so
[26:05] that's why
[26:11] she said let me find favor in your sight
[26:14] for thou has comforted me like now
[26:16] you're telling me something you have
[26:18] comfort in me
[26:19] and for that thou has spoken friendly
[26:22] unto thine
[26:24] a handmade in Maine so what is what is
[26:27] she telling him he's like you have been
[26:29] friendly you have shown yourself
[26:31] friendly to me
[26:32] but let me show you who I am let me show
[26:35] you let me show you my testimony and
[26:37] then you can decide
[26:39] then she says though I I be no like onto
[26:42] one of the handmaids had made handmade
[26:45] maidens amen
[26:46] and then the prophet of God says now
[26:49] notice closely now
[26:51] he's our Kinsman Boaz or arboas and you
[26:55] can find
[26:57] this is what what I really love about
[26:59] this quote brother says if you can find
[27:01] Grace with him you will find
[27:04] rest
[27:06] if you can find Grace in the sight of
[27:09] God you will find rest
[27:13] boss represented a Christ the rich man
[27:16] the the heir of all things the lord of
[27:19] the Harvest oh my when boas come riding
[27:21] out there in the carriage looking around
[27:23] over the fields and his eyes fell on
[27:26] Ruth he was the master he was the lord
[27:28] of the Harvest and she found Grace in
[27:31] his side there were a lot of Maidens in
[27:33] that area but there was one that found
[27:36] Grace in the sight of Christ and I can
[27:39] tell you there there is many people now
[27:41] upon the Earth but there is one that has
[27:43] found Grace in the sight of God and is
[27:45] here you are the one that had found
[27:47] Grace in the sight of God
[27:52] amen that's that's what the church is
[27:54] doing today what well the Lord the of
[27:56] the Harvest well he's going by he's not
[27:59] looking you know at the big things he's
[28:01] looking for individuals man and woman
[28:04] who are dedicated and had made a clean
[28:07] cut decision for Christ
[28:11] consecrated themselves to his service
[28:14] and you can say God I believe it every
[28:17] word of this book I believe it when you
[28:20] were when your word says anything I stay
[28:22] right with the word
[28:25] that's your word I believe in every word
[28:28] that is written I believe in that what
[28:31] that is what he's looking for the lord
[28:33] of the Harvest that's what he's looking
[28:34] for someone that is going to stay by
[28:37] with the word
[28:39] and that's what he he wants to give he
[28:41] wants to give the Holy Spirit to those
[28:43] who are hungering and thirsting for this
[28:48] now
[28:50] you know when when they came back in in
[28:52] there may be a lot of reading this
[28:53] morning but I want you to capture this
[28:55] and you know because we have like our
[28:57] youth like some some of them may not
[28:59] know about this but let's let's take a
[29:00] little bit of time to to explain some of
[29:02] this so
[29:04] we said that first Naomi in in limelick
[29:08] they went to uh to Moab for a season of
[29:13] time amen and they went with their two
[29:14] children right melanin kellyanne they
[29:17] went and and they stay there their their
[29:20] children they found wives for themselves
[29:22] or find Ruth amen but then um
[29:26] they they died
[29:29] so then they had to make a decision
[29:31] whether Naomi wants us wanted to stay
[29:34] there or not or she wanted to go back to
[29:37] Bethlehem amen so now there came a time
[29:41] when uh a she's like you know what I'm
[29:44] going I'm going back to Bethlehem she
[29:46] told her uh two daughter-in-laws he's
[29:49] telling them you know I'm going back
[29:50] back to Bethlehem and if you guys or if
[29:53] you girls want to want to stay here
[29:55] you're free to go because you know I
[29:57] don't have more children but if even if
[29:59] you want to wait I can get married and I
[30:02] can have children but then you have to
[30:03] wait 30 uh 20 to 40 20 to 30 years and
[30:07] then you can marry them and then the
[30:08] lineage will continue but but like don't
[30:11] wait for that
[30:13] but then one of them was like you know
[30:15] what she kissed she she went in and said
[30:17] you know what I'm going back and she
[30:19] returned and the prophet of God tells us
[30:22] that the one that is kissing the the
[30:25] kissing Naomi which was orpha She's
[30:28] kissing the word and he's she's just
[30:30] going back
[30:32] but then there is another one which is
[30:34] Ruth that she's not kissing the word and
[30:36] she's going back she's like you know
[30:38] what I will go with you your people
[30:40] shall be my people your God will be my
[30:43] God so that's what we're talking when
[30:45] we're saying that she had to make a
[30:47] decision that was the strongest decision
[30:50] or the hardest decision that she had to
[30:52] make because she was gonna leave her
[30:54] family behind she was going to leave
[30:56] whatever possession she had because she
[30:58] had to leave them behind because she was
[31:00] making a decision to go to the unknown
[31:05] and that's why you know like then she
[31:08] she she
[31:09] got to to Bethlehem and then everybody's
[31:12] looking at her funny and then you think
[31:14] about it wouldn't she be discouraged to
[31:18] see all these people that she thought
[31:19] that she would they were gonna welcome
[31:21] her with open arms and hey we're so
[31:24] happy that you're here no they saw her
[31:25] and they were like oh she's coming from
[31:27] Moab she's coming from from from from
[31:29] the from from something that that wasn't
[31:32] right
[31:34] wouldn't that be something that will
[31:35] discourage her to keep being or to stay
[31:38] in in Bethlehem for sure
[31:40] you know many times when we have made
[31:42] the choices for Christ we find ourselves
[31:45] in the same position you come to church
[31:46] and somebody you know they turn their
[31:48] face to you and then you're like well
[31:49] you know I made all these choices and
[31:51] now I come to church and nobody wants to
[31:52] talk to me nobody wants to fellowship
[31:54] with me well you know Show Yourself
[31:56] friendly as is stalking here
[32:00] so you know he didn't have to say
[32:02] anything but she showed herself friendly
[32:03] but one one thing she did she started
[32:06] serving as we were saying she started
[32:08] serving so if you want if you want to be
[32:11] involved in the congregation in the
[32:12] church and start serving
[32:14] and then you're gonna see you're gonna
[32:15] find out you're gonna find yourself a
[32:17] lot of friends
[32:18] you're gonna you're gonna grow better
[32:20] relationships why because now you're
[32:22] serving somebody had to do it and then
[32:25] the testimony came after that oh she's
[32:27] serving she's reaping there with with
[32:29] with with the young man and all the all
[32:33] the um the younger maidens they are on
[32:36] one side but she's on one side but she's
[32:37] serving
[32:39] Show Yourself friendly serve
[32:42] you know because I I like to serve in
[32:44] church everybody has to serve no but if
[32:46] you're gonna have friends in church you
[32:48] want to make a family in church serve
[32:52] that's what she did
[32:58] then she says boys and then she's like
[33:00] well
[33:02] she knew that the fields were above us
[33:05] right
[33:06] but brother Brandon says it's like when
[33:09] they they went back from Moab to
[33:11] Bethlehem they came during the Harley
[33:14] season it was the it was barley season
[33:17] was bread season
[33:21] it was fresh bread that was being served
[33:24] it was not all bread that was being
[33:25] served and the church in these last days
[33:29] through 2000 years of pagan teachings
[33:31] and all of that you have come in barley
[33:34] season why because you are receiving the
[33:37] freshness of life you are receiving the
[33:40] new bread the honey Out of Heaven amen
[33:43] this is the bread from Heaven that's
[33:45] what Jesus said I am the bread of life
[33:49] amen I am the bread of life your your
[33:52] fathers did eat mana and they are that
[33:54] amen but I am the bread of life that
[33:57] comes from God out of Heaven if I'm in
[34:00] if a man eats his this bread he will
[34:02] never die so this is a time for the
[34:06] church that now you're coming in that's
[34:08] that season where the where the word is
[34:10] is being planted and now you're reaping
[34:14] all of that and this is a time of uh new
[34:17] breath not all teachings no no not uh
[34:21] you know uh 2 000 years of teaching of
[34:24] formalism and all of that no you are
[34:26] receiving the fresh Manna From Heaven
[34:28] and that you can say I believe that
[34:33] amen certainly she was a gentile she was
[34:36] as communicated amen she she was she was
[34:39] being she was the worst but she was
[34:41] accepted as a bride
[34:43] amen and so now if you see yourself you
[34:47] have to believe that you are a part of
[34:49] the bride of Christ amen because you
[34:51] have come during this season where the
[34:53] world has been opened to us the seals
[34:55] have been opened to us and what is
[34:57] inside of those seals there is my name
[35:00] written in the last book of life
[35:03] that's what is in there is not in any
[35:05] any any complicated thing but it just
[35:08] says that my name is written in the book
[35:10] so now when the when we say that the
[35:12] Bible became a new book is because every
[35:15] single time you go back and read your
[35:17] Bible you are seeing Christ and I can
[35:19] tell you if you see Christ then you'll
[35:21] see you sir you will see yourself that's
[35:23] when we're talking in the Book of Ruth
[35:25] I'm seeing the bride and I'm seeing
[35:27] Christ therefore I am seeing myself with
[35:30] a relay personal relationship with
[35:31] Christ
[35:33] that's why go back and read your Bible
[35:35] go back and pray go back and talk him
[35:39] Lord Show Me Your Glory show me more of
[35:43] yourself when I open this book
[35:46] because this is the power listen this is
[35:48] the time of new breath in this we sing
[35:51] it's a new season is a new day
[35:54] this is the day that the Lord has made
[35:57] amen
[36:00] now
[36:01] in the book of root chapter 3 verse 7
[36:08] it says in wimboas
[36:11] got eaten and drunk and his heart was
[36:14] married
[36:15] he went to like lay down at the end of
[36:18] the Heap of green
[36:21] then Ruth came softly and uncovered his
[36:24] feet and lay down
[36:27] and then at midnight haven't we heard
[36:29] many times then at midnight there was a
[36:32] cry
[36:33] the bridegroom
[36:35] is coming
[36:37] here you can see the same thing at
[36:39] midnight there was a cry there was a cry
[36:41] what's going on there is a woman laying
[36:45] at the feet above us something needs to
[36:47] happen
[36:50] and at midnight the the man was start
[36:53] started and he turned over
[36:56] in a woman lay at his feet and he said
[37:00] who are you
[37:01] and she answered I am Ruth your mate
[37:04] servant
[37:06] spread your skirt
[37:09] spread your skirt
[37:11] over your maidservant for you are a next
[37:14] of kin
[37:15] so now she had a message for Boaz guess
[37:19] what we are related
[37:21] send that beautiful to know now you can
[37:23] come in in in during this time these the
[37:26] Midnight Cry where there is Darkness now
[37:29] you can come to Boaz and you can tell
[37:30] him hey we are blood of I'm brother of
[37:33] your blood I am flesh of your or your
[37:35] flesh I am yours I am yours
[37:39] is the same thing that you can see this
[37:41] morning now in in during in the midnight
[37:44] during the time of Crisis you can come
[37:46] to him and say hey I am yours
[37:50] and then here if you look the word here
[37:52] there is die skirt SK I
[37:57] RT
[38:00] these words
[38:02] in in I think it's in the Hebrew is
[38:05] canap and it literally means an edge or
[38:09] extremity and can and it can refer to
[38:13] the border of a garment
[38:16] in but also it is a word that is
[38:20] commonly used for a bird's wing
[38:24] so that's what we're saying is like
[38:25] under the shadow of your wind like in in
[38:28] in in in in in in the second chapter
[38:30] he's that you have come to under the
[38:32] Shadow and now in this verse
[38:34] specifically she's referring to the same
[38:36] thing
[38:38] but this word is frequently used as a
[38:41] figurative for protective care in other
[38:43] words she is like you know what
[38:46] you have said before
[38:49] in in in in in verse 2 and verse 12 the
[38:53] Lord recompense thy Work in a full
[38:55] reward be given the of the Lord of God
[38:58] of Israel under whose wings Thou Art
[39:00] come to trust
[39:02] she's like now she's responding and
[39:05] she's saying
[39:06] spread your skirt
[39:09] spread your wings express your the wings
[39:14] of your protection over your maidservant
[39:18] what is this and and then this word is
[39:21] frequently used as a a few figure for
[39:24] protective care and then if you read in
[39:27] the in the Book of Matthew 23 and verse
[39:29] 37 in in the Book of Luke Chapter 13
[39:32] Verse 34 Jesus used the same analogy
[39:35] though in a different language when he's
[39:37] saying Jerusalem or Jerusalem how I have
[39:40] I have a desire to gather you as a hand
[39:43] with with her chickens
[39:46] Jesus is using the same the same thing
[39:48] why because there is protection under
[39:50] the shadow of his wings
[39:53] in fact in this precise context in which
[39:56] boas had used the same very word in
[39:59] speaking with Ruth chapter second
[40:02] chapter verse 12 the law recompense thy
[40:04] Work in a full reward be given thee of
[40:07] the Lord God of Israel under whose wings
[40:10] Thou Art come to trust
[40:12] is saying the Lord is going to
[40:14] recompense you now she's like extend
[40:17] your wing
[40:19] can we say that this morning Lord extend
[40:21] your wings a protection
[40:24] rude was Now using the same analogy to
[40:27] request boas to bring her under his
[40:31] protective Wing as as her husband now
[40:34] she was saying yes I accept yes I accept
[40:37] your proposal making her meaning
[40:40] unmistakable as she pointed out his
[40:42] rights and duties as the near Kinsman
[40:44] because now she knew she knew a little
[40:47] bit more she knew a little bit more of
[40:49] the message she knew that now Boaz was a
[40:51] kinsman redeemer in other words remember
[40:53] in in Redemption there was when the
[40:57] husband was dead when the father was
[40:59] dead and there was nobody else that
[41:01] could take care of of the widows
[41:03] somebody will have to come and redeem
[41:06] them in order for them to preserve their
[41:08] name
[41:10] the only one that was that was close to
[41:13] them both Saturday in in in the third
[41:16] chapter it says when when he comes to
[41:19] her in verse 11 and there is one that's
[41:22] boy you know what
[41:24] I know it is true that I am died near
[41:26] Kinsman Habi there is a Kinsmen neater
[41:30] than I in other words Boaz was telling
[41:33] her there is someone in between you and
[41:35] I
[41:37] what can we say this morning there is
[41:39] someone in between God and you you know
[41:41] could be your flesh could be your
[41:43] desires who could be whatever it is who
[41:45] is he is the enemy that could be in
[41:47] between you and God
[41:49] but then Boba says Theory this night and
[41:52] it shall be in the morning that if he
[41:54] will perform unto thee the part of a
[41:56] king's man well let him do the Kinsman
[41:58] part
[42:00] but if he will not do the part of
[42:02] accusement to thee then will I do the
[42:04] part of a Kinsmen to thee as the Lord
[42:07] liveth lay down until the morning in
[42:10] other words he is like you know what
[42:12] you're still on my feet lay down rest
[42:14] and we will finish the mother in the
[42:16] morning
[42:17] what is this telling you now that there
[42:21] is you know we always say that like
[42:22] there is a it's going to be a
[42:24] resurrection in the morning wouldn't
[42:26] this be talking about Resurrection
[42:28] happening to Boaz and Ruth
[42:32] because he's telling her I will finish
[42:34] the matter in the morning
[42:38] and that is what's happening with us you
[42:40] know we may find ourselves during in the
[42:42] midnight of our crisis but Rejoice
[42:45] because there is always mourning coming
[42:51] amen
[42:52] she was obedient she laid up his feet
[42:55] until the morning and she rose up before
[42:56] one could know another and he said let
[42:59] it not be known that a woman came into
[43:02] the floor
[43:03] because I would have Dishonored Ruth if
[43:06] she already had a name just think about
[43:08] her coming to the feet of a man
[43:13] if we already have a name right now that
[43:15] people make fun of us that you're
[43:16] following a man you're following these
[43:19] that and the other just rest
[43:22] and the Lord will finish the work
[43:26] amen
[43:29] and also he said bring the veil that
[43:31] thou has a pandian hold it and when she
[43:34] held it he measures six measures of
[43:37] barley
[43:39] think about this why six why not five
[43:42] why not for why not eight what why
[43:46] because six in the numerology of God is
[43:49] a number of men
[43:51] but he was the seventh he was the
[43:54] seventh portion for Ruth in other words
[43:57] seven is a number of completions so he
[44:00] was sending her a message in between the
[44:03] lines to tell her hey I'm giving you six
[44:06] but the seventh is coming
[44:09] isn't that amazing this morning you know
[44:11] here I'm giving you a portion of the
[44:13] word but the completion is coming Jesus
[44:16] Christ the same yesterday today and
[44:18] forever he is coming he is coming to
[44:22] change your life he's coming to redeem
[44:24] you he has come already to redeem your
[44:26] life
[44:29] but now she didn't just keep the message
[44:31] for herself because when she came to her
[44:34] mother-in-law she said who are who who
[44:36] are thou my daughter and she told her
[44:38] all the men had done to her and she said
[44:41] there's these six measures of barley gay
[44:43] he gave me gave him in where he said to
[44:46] me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law
[44:49] in other words whenever you come to
[44:51] church you will not live empty every
[44:54] time you come with a with a willing
[44:56] heart that you say Lord I want to be
[44:58] under the protection of your of your of
[45:00] your work you are not gonna live empty
[45:02] this morning
[45:06] verse 18.
[45:08] but there was a request
[45:12] Ruth
[45:13] is given a message from her
[45:15] mother-in-law and brother random says
[45:17] that the mother-in-law is the Hebrew
[45:18] church amen the orphan is is the
[45:22] denominational world that they are
[45:23] kissing the word and they are they are
[45:25] going back to the traditions and the
[45:27] documents and everything but he says
[45:28] that Ruth is the real church because
[45:31] she's making decisions that are going to
[45:33] have an impact in the future
[45:36] but you know Naomi she told her this
[45:38] then she said sit steal my daughter
[45:44] until thou know until thou know how the
[45:47] matter will fall for the man will not be
[45:50] in rest until he have finished the thing
[45:54] this day
[45:57] he will not be at rest he will not rest
[46:00] until he finish the work in your life
[46:04] don't we read in the book of Philippians
[46:06] if he started the work he will be
[46:09] faithful to complete it until the day of
[46:12] the Lord
[46:13] look what Naomi tells tells Ruth sit
[46:17] steal
[46:18] just rest
[46:20] because it is now his part of the deal
[46:25] you don't have to do anything else now
[46:27] you just have to sit still now you just
[46:30] have to rest he won't rest until you are
[46:33] made whole he won't rest until you are
[46:36] filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:37] he will rest until your thoughts are
[46:40] changed he won't rest until your quest
[46:43] questions are answered
[46:46] but the Bible says be still and know
[46:49] that I am God
[46:52] in Romans 8 28 verse 31 sorry Romans 8
[46:57] 28
[47:02] we read these many times but it says and
[47:04] we know that all things work together
[47:07] for good
[47:08] to them that love God
[47:11] to them who are they called according to
[47:15] his purpose
[47:17] is not your purpose it's God's purpose
[47:19] you are being called to a purpose that
[47:22] is higher than your purpose
[47:24] and then for whom he did for no he also
[47:27] predestinate to be conformed to the
[47:30] image of his son that he may be the
[47:33] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[47:35] whom he did predestinate then he also
[47:39] called and whom he called them he also
[47:42] justified in whom he justified them he
[47:45] also glorified
[47:47] what shall we say to these things if God
[47:50] be for us who can be against us
[47:53] he that is burned not his own son but
[47:56] deliver him for us all for us all how
[48:00] shall he not be with him as how shall he
[48:03] not with him also freely give us all
[48:06] things
[48:08] freely giving you all things who shall
[48:11] lay anything to the Church of God's
[48:13] elect
[48:14] he has the answer it is God that justify
[48:18] it
[48:19] who is he that brings come the nation to
[48:21] your life
[48:22] it is Christ that died
[48:25] yea rather that it is reason again who
[48:28] is even at the right hand of God who
[48:31] also make it intercessions for us
[48:33] and then who shall separate us from the
[48:36] love of Christ who who separated who
[48:40] could separate Ruth from the love above
[48:42] us nothing could separate her because
[48:44] she was already given a word you just be
[48:47] still and you will and he will finish
[48:49] the work
[48:51] that's the word for you this morning be
[48:54] still
[48:55] and know that he is God
[48:58] who shall separate us from the love of
[49:00] Christ shall tribulation
[49:02] or distress or persecution
[49:06] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sore
[49:11] as it is written for thy sake we are
[49:14] kill all the day long we are accounted
[49:17] as sheep for the slaughter
[49:20] nay in all these things we are more than
[49:26] conquerors through him that loved us
[49:30] that's what Ruth could say in all these
[49:33] things he I am more than conqueror now
[49:36] you can say you can make fun of me you
[49:38] can mock me because I don't look like
[49:40] you but I can tell you I have a message
[49:42] I have a word from Heaven that I'm gonna
[49:45] be redeemed I have a message I have a
[49:47] word from Heaven that I can be healed
[49:50] this morning I have a message I have a
[49:52] word from Heaven that my family
[49:54] situation is gonna be fixed according to
[49:56] the perfect will of the father
[49:58] and then what what is what else is Paul
[50:01] writing here for I am persuaded that
[50:04] neither death
[50:06] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[50:10] nor powers nor things present
[50:13] nor things to come nor height nor that
[50:17] that
[50:19] nor any other creature shall be able to
[50:22] separate us from the love of God which
[50:25] is in Christ Jesus our lord
[50:28] what can who can separate us from the
[50:30] love of God
[50:31] can separate me from the love of God
[50:35] criticism
[50:37] in all the isms
[50:41] nothing
[50:48] we're good here
[50:49] have a good time
[50:55] you know during that great feast
[51:01] the prophet of God says boys laid on the
[51:03] floor at night
[51:04] in a young woman beautiful morally
[51:07] righteous
[51:08] she had to put her confidence in Boaz
[51:12] without knowing him
[51:15] no matter what anybody had to say she
[51:18] trusted him as a righteous man and she
[51:21] had to do it
[51:22] and everyone that comes to Christ must
[51:26] do likewise you got to lay yourself at
[51:29] the disposal of Christ
[51:32] no matter what your mother says or what
[51:34] your dad says what anybody else says lay
[51:37] yourself at his feet
[51:40] root showed her confidence by laying her
[51:42] head upon his feet while he was sleeping
[51:45] she laid at boss's feet and when he woke
[51:47] up and he and he saw the car the
[51:50] confidence
[51:51] he but the prophet of God says one of
[51:53] these days he will see the confidence
[51:55] that his church has got in him when he's
[51:58] seen that confidence he taken out he
[52:01] taking his own robe his holy spirit he
[52:04] said he had to spread over hurt it was
[52:06] getting cold you know but he had to
[52:08] spread his robe over her and then he
[52:11] sent her on her Road
[52:13] and so did people it happened the same
[52:15] in the day of Pentecost amen the new
[52:18] church when they went out there you know
[52:20] they they were not ashamed because you
[52:22] know when she wasn't she was at boys's
[52:24] feet after that after when she went to
[52:26] her mother-in-laws she was not ashamed
[52:28] that she was at voice as Faith she was
[52:30] happy that she was able to receive a
[52:32] portion
[52:33] just one portion a small portion this
[52:36] the six portions of barley but she was
[52:39] waiting for her double portion
[52:41] and that is what is happening with the
[52:43] church today you have received a portion
[52:45] you know what is in part you have
[52:47] received it but when the that thing that
[52:49] is in part will be taken away then the
[52:51] the fullness of Christ will come to you
[52:54] and I believe we are experiencing
[52:57] experiencing the fullness of Christ in
[52:59] our lives in a small measure but when
[53:02] your body is ruptured then that will be
[53:05] the full expression of Christ in your
[53:07] life

[53:12] in order for God to redeem the human
[53:14] race God had to come down he had to be a
[53:17] human amen he had to experience your

[53:38] drama or anything that you may be facing
[53:40] today he already experience that
[53:43] amen because he he so he came in order
[53:47] for him to experience that to say you
[53:49] know what hey this is possible you can

[54:04] right kind of a man and Jesus was that
[54:06] man amen and now

[54:11] there is redemption amen what did he

[54:25] that is what happened when he put you in
[54:27] the pound shop certainly Satan put you
[54:29] in the pound shop and nobody could pay
[54:31] the price for you but he the kinsman
[54:34] redeemer was the only one that was able
[54:36] to redeem you amen that he was the only
[54:39] one that was closer to you so he is the
[54:42] one that paid the price
[54:44] Jesus Christ uncover it was your kinsman
[54:46] redeemer and he redeemed you from every

[55:52] that I what I need to do this morning is
[55:55] just to keep pressing on keep pressing
[55:57] on keep pressing on Amen
[56:00] now
[56:02] in The Book of Leviticus chapter 15
[56:04] verse 25
[56:07] and remember we're talking under the
[56:09] shadow of his wins and we're talking
[56:11] about garments we're talking about the
[56:12] Hem of His Garment
[56:14] but now I want you to notice this
[56:21] Leviticus chapter 15 verse 25.
[56:28] it says and if a woman
[56:30] have an issue of her blood many days are
[56:33] out of the time of her separation or if
[56:36] it run beyond the time of her separation
[56:38] all the days of the issue of her unclean
[56:40] uncleanness shall be as a days of her
[56:43] separation she shall be unclean
[56:47] every bed everything everything where
[56:49] she was you know everything was unclean
[56:51] verse 27 and whosoever told you those
[56:53] things shall be unclean and shall be
[56:55] shall washed his clothes and bathed
[56:57] himself in water and be unclean until
[56:59] they even
[57:01] he's talking about the law
[57:04] and he's you know I think last time we
[57:06] were talking about like how the law was
[57:08] written with a purpose but then when
[57:10] Jesus came there has to be a fulfillment
[57:12] there has to be something that needed to
[57:14] happen so that people could be like well
[57:17] he he it is what what the law says but
[57:19] what does Jesus say
[57:21] you know in this specific instance
[57:25] we're talking about uncleanness of our
[57:28] offer of a woman that had had a a blood
[57:32] many days amen
[57:34] and and then but now in the Book of Luke
[57:38] chapter 8 43
[57:41] it says uh in a woman
[57:44] having an issue of blood for uh 12 years
[57:47] which had to spend all her living upon
[57:50] Physicians neither could be healed of
[57:53] any
[57:54] and we know about we have heard about
[57:56] this woman you know she she went to all
[57:58] the doctors because she wanted to be
[58:00] clean you know because when you're gone
[58:01] when you go to the doctor is because you
[58:03] want to receive your healing amen and
[58:06] but there was a desire and she heard
[58:09] that Jesus was was coming her way
[58:12] and she's like I have to do something I
[58:15] I I I have to get to Jesus
[58:18] how many this morning I was like I want
[58:20] to get to Jesus this morning I I want to
[58:23] Touch the Hem of His Garment this
[58:25] morning and you know she had in her
[58:27] heart she was like she came behind him
[58:29] and touched the border of His Garment
[58:32] and immediately her issue of blood
[58:35] stenched
[58:36] and Jesus said who told me when all
[58:40] denied Peter and Dada were with him said
[58:43] Master the multitude trondy and Prezi
[58:46] and says Thou who touched me
[58:49] because they were in in our in like kind
[58:51] of the the physical sphere but they were
[58:54] not looking at what's going on in the
[58:56] spiritual Realm
[58:57] there was something else going on there
[58:59] and Jesus said somebody had touched me
[59:02] for I perceived that virtue is gone out
[59:04] of me in other words power had come out
[59:07] of me
[59:08] and when the woman saw that that she was
[59:12] not hit she came trembling and falling
[59:15] down before him again
[59:17] coming to the feet of Jesus coming to
[59:20] the feet above us why because there was
[59:22] something going on there at the feet of
[59:24] Jesus she declared unto him before all
[59:27] the people for what for what cause she
[59:30] had touched him and now she was healed
[59:32] immediately
[59:35] and she and he said unto her daughter be
[59:39] of good Comfort thy faith had made the
[59:42] whole go in peace
[59:45] notice the law was against her why
[59:49] because she wasn't clean for many days
[59:51] and she couldn't be around people
[59:53] because if they would touch her they
[59:54] would have to do all their lord rituals
[59:57] and they have to go and wash themselves
[59:58] and then wait for seven days to be again
[1:00:00] back among the people so nobody wanted
[1:00:03] to be her friend
[1:00:06] just think about it
[1:00:08] that every time she will be around
[1:00:11] people they will call her or they will
[1:00:13] they will scream at her unclean unclean
[1:00:16] unclean don't be near near to her
[1:00:19] because she is unclean
[1:00:22] oh Lord under the law there was nothing
[1:00:26] that could be done but Jesus was passing
[1:00:29] by
[1:00:30] amen what can we say this morning Jesus
[1:00:34] was passing by she wanted to be under
[1:00:37] the shadow of his wings as she said if I
[1:00:40] could only Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:00:43] I will be made whole
[1:00:47] the same request as Ruth extend the hand
[1:00:50] of your garment and I will be made I
[1:00:54] will receive a new name
[1:01:01] so when they were in front of her
[1:01:03] and we're like you are unclean because
[1:01:05] you have you have a blood issue
[1:01:08] and she was like well the blood is not
[1:01:10] coming anymore
[1:01:12] I'm clean
[1:01:13] amen so the same you know it's like can
[1:01:17] we say that this morning Lord extend the
[1:01:20] Hem of your garment when the enemy is
[1:01:22] coming and telling me of my mistakes or
[1:01:26] or my past wrongs now I can say I am not
[1:01:29] unclean anymore because I have touched
[1:01:32] Jesus Jesus has touched me this morning
[1:01:34] and he said that I am clean he said that
[1:01:37] I am saved he said that I can receive
[1:01:40] the holy spirit this morning
[1:01:46] government Don't We Sing cover me when I
[1:01:48] am broken coming me when or cover me
[1:01:51] amen Grace descended and made her whole
[1:01:55] she was clean in that very hour oh if
[1:01:59] there is someone cleaning uncleanness in
[1:02:01] my life Lord Let Me Touch the Hem of
[1:02:04] your garment this morning I don't want
[1:02:06] to be calling clean anymore I don't want
[1:02:09] to recall a sinner anymore Lord I want
[1:02:11] to be called a redeemed I want to be
[1:02:13] under the shadow of your wings Lord I
[1:02:16] want to be at your feet this morning

[1:04:38] shouldn't be doing Lord I bring them at
[1:04:41] the feet of Jesus
[1:04:43] all my thoughts Lord
[1:04:45] whatever is is not if I even if I think
[1:04:48] something against my brother something
[1:04:50] against my sister Lord I'll bring I
[1:04:52] bring it I bring it I bring them at your
[1:04:55] feet Lord that you forgive me this
[1:04:57] morning Lord I don't want to be cold and
[1:04:59] clean anymore I don't want to be called
[1:05:01] a sinner I don't want to be called out
[1:05:03] wishy-washy that today I can be in
[1:05:05] church tomorrow I don't know
[1:05:07] my desire this morning is that you can
[1:05:10] catch this and you can say Lord I want
[1:05:12] to be under the shadow of your wings I
[1:05:14] wanna be under your protection I want to
[1:05:17] commit to you this morning because once
[1:05:20] Ruth was able to be under the shadow of
[1:05:23] that protection then she was she knew
[1:05:25] that she was commuting to Boaz she knew
[1:05:27] that all the men around her were gone
[1:05:30] and then she was now only keeping
[1:05:32] herself for both
[1:05:34] may that be your desire may that be your
[1:05:37] heart this morning that's my heart this
[1:05:39] morning Lord
[1:05:40] I am only yours this morning
[1:05:43] help me this morning Lord
[1:05:45] now he just bought our heads just to
[1:05:48] finish the woman we spoke about today
[1:05:50] Ruth the woman with the blood issue
[1:05:53] they had something in common
[1:05:55] according to the law they were not
[1:05:58] worthy
[1:05:59] they were condemned but Amazing Grace
[1:06:02] came to them how sweet is that sound
[1:06:05] that that save of rich like me there
[1:06:08] there is a place where you can be safe
[1:06:10] under the shadow of his queen of his
[1:06:14] wings at the feet of Jesus
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:18] we've got bar heads in him in your heart
[1:06:22] there is something that you want to
[1:06:24] bring at the feet of Jesus even you can
[1:06:26] come to the to the altar
[1:06:29] but you can say Lord
[1:06:32] I want to be a steel
[1:06:34] I'm gonna make a decision for you this
[1:06:36] morning
[1:06:37] if I have been all these many years Lord
[1:06:39] wishiwashy kind of I can be here or I I
[1:06:42] don't want to be here may we make clear
[1:06:46] cut decisions for you this morning Lord
[1:06:48] that we can say I want to love you I
[1:06:51] want to be under your protection I want
[1:06:53] to commit to you this morning Lord
[1:06:56] that's my desire as my prayer Lord this
[1:06:59] morning may everything that I say may it
[1:07:02] wouldn't be only words father but may
[1:07:05] they be the groanings from My Heart Lord
[1:07:08] a desire from my heart that I want to be
[1:07:13] closer to you I want to be at your feet
[1:07:15] this morning that's my prayer Lord
[1:07:17] that's the prayer I I pray that that's
[1:07:20] the same prayer from your children that
[1:07:22] they want to be closer but when we live
[1:07:24] here we live different new people new
[1:07:28] minds that need new thoughts
[1:07:31] that we can live here for a given we can
[1:07:34] live here hard the Lord we can live here
[1:07:37] comforted Lord knowing that you have
[1:07:39] done the work for us
[1:07:40] because as we read who shall separate us
[1:07:42] from the love of God
[1:07:44] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:07:46] God
[1:07:47] either on their your wings we want to be
[1:07:49] this morning
