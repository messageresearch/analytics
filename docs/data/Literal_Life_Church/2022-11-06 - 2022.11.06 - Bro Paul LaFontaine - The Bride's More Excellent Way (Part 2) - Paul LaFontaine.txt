TRANSCRIPT
========================================
came by and spoke for us and there's a couple of children's books this one we have in the library this is a new one by a sister in Chicago so those that have young children check those out in the library there this is a coloring book and this is a nice little story she did with illustration if you're looking for materials to read to the kids those are really nice check those out in the library after church today First Corinthians 12 and 31 it's just one scripture and we'll continue talking about the more excellent way the bride's more excellent way and Paul mentions it in the Bible here first Corinthians 12 and verse 31 he says but covet earnestly the best gifts and the reason that Paul mentions the gifts of the Spirit is because he's just spent several chapters talking about the gifts and not just talking about gifts that work in the church but he's actually correcting how they were using them and making sure they're in order and making sure it doesn't get off track and there's another reason Paul corrects it is that we tend to when we have the gifts we tend to get just a bit carnal with them in that we lean on something the gifts more than they More Than The Giver of the gifts and that's car that's human tendency is that when you have a gift if you have a big display of Miracles and signs and wonders which Our God can do we've had here in the church cancer healed we've had testimony is around the world of the Dead being raised you say well my I don't ever hear that well it's happening because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's able to do everything he's ever done before he's able to do it this morning again so you can imagine now your habit that you have you think you'll never overcome nothing is too hard for the Lord if he can heal the sick he can raise the dead still then God can do anything this morning and so you see then that that Paul is not only talking about coveting the best gifts he's never eliminating the gifts but there's a tendency in human beings to gravitate towards the visible into the manifestations and to the healings and the physical things and we get you know excited rah-rah about it but our tendency is to cling to seeing the gifts and not have a relationship with The Giver and and not have the substance of what the giver wants to bring from our lives and what he wants to bring from our lives is not just Miracles and signs and wonders and signs following life he's wanting to bring Holy Ghost manifested Divine love from our lives and this is what Paul refers to now as he says covet earnestly the best gifts all you Corinthians yet show I unto you a more excellent way and then he takes the next chapter and he begins to explain the more excellent way and that's what we're going to by the grace of God do this morning if you give attention to the Lord I believe it will be a blessing to you thank you Father for to be back with my family again today Lord and we know we've been here Lord in the city but we just when we gather together it's something special in our hearts because we know that we share something Kindred in our Spirits Lord we share you and we share the word we share the message of the last days and Lord we have something in common and we are also sharing the fact Lord that we're thirsty for more of you and Lord I pray you'll bless every soul lord Every Soul here listening whether it be online or here in the building is so important to you and Lord that Soul was so important that you went to Calvary for them you opened up a fountain for them and Lord we're thankful for that we pray that you'll get across your word this morning may The Vessel step out of the way and may you be able to bring us into a deeper mention of yourself and learn of you for you said I am meek and lowly you said learn of me come unto me all that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest Lord we just look to you this morning and speak through US Lord we pray speak to every heart no matter what they've come from no matter what what place they've come from today what background meet them today I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated hmm if they wanted to bring that PowerPoint out which which button do I push here I'm I'm new at all this but the big button and which do I point it to do I point it to brother Bob here or where do I point him up to you Genie this you know this always happens to me not the other preachers it always happens to me because I'm technically challenged so here's I want to begin with something uh that William Branham said the first quote here and and he's referring to this scripture Paul talking up to the Corinthians about the more excellent way and I just the the reason I brought it into a PowerPoint is I wanted to bring some of the quotes in this PowerPoint and also I wanted to bring this in a teaching because today the Lord willing I want to break down the more excellent way I want to break down the attributes of this love and in order to do that I just want to open it with just this quote and William Branham was a had a powerful Ministry in the 50s and 60s and we believe that he fulfilled scripture even to bring us back to Bible faith if you're interested in hearing more of that which certainly would share anyone here would share more of that with you but I'm going to read from what something he said in a sermon and it's just a powerful thing and as he refers to Paul correcting the Corinthians he says listen at that Stern old Apostle drive it into this Sensational church now he told he called the Corinthians a sensational church and that means they were more about sensation than they were substance and he said listen to this old Stern old Apostle drive it into this Sensational Church who is basing their hopes upon sensation now this is Sunday school this is a place of Correction this is a place of teaching and woe unto the man that will stand in the pulpit and mislead I'm going to say I want to repeat that woe unto the man that would stand in the pulpit and mislead the people I think we should teach balanced solid Doctrine and not lean any other way as brother George was saying on Wednesday night we need a balance can you say amen and so on to the man they'll stand the pulpit and mislead brother it's time that we've made Spirit compared with scripture that's right and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor Paul said though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it prevaileth me nothing see all your good works all your good deeds all the spiritual things you have all the gifts you have all the sensations you have all the joy you have all the peace you have has nothing at all to do with it to begin with think of that just a moment and think of the churches today our great churches Presbyterian methodists Baptists and denominational they think because they say I Believe come in put your name on the book and that settles it that settles it how far they're off and so there is dealing with just coming and putting your name on a book and that's good enough then he goes into the Pentecostals and the next one he says our Pentecostal people think well because they got a little sensation they felt good they spoke with tongues they got a blood in their hand oil in their face or something we got it we got it oh 10 million miles off you get it see how the devil as the God of this world has blinded the eyes of those and they just go right on living like that listen for although I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned and have not charity I am nothing look at all those gifts all those good things I feed the poor I got a good heart about me I do this I do that I go to church I speak with tongues I prophecy I prophesy I heal the sick I preach the gospel I do these things Paul said Still Still I am nothing all those things can be carnally impersonated the devil can imitate all of these good works and that's why when you come to the Lord and come to the message of the last days it's not just books and tapes and good works and wearing the right dress and wearing the right clothes can you say man you've got to have the substance of the Holy Ghost living in you or and because why do you have to have Holy Ghost love why do you have to have the substance of the Holy Ghost because true Holy Ghost love cannot be imitated cannot be impersonated but all these gifts they can be impersonated so if you just have the gift Satan can impersonate them now once again Paul's not dumping out the gifts he's not dumping out going to church he's not dumping out the tongues and interpretation he's not saying any of that he's just saying that if you live on that and don't have the substance and have not charity it doesn't mean anything is everybody everybody understand what Paul's saying and so now we have to be careful that our emphasis is on the right thing because we could emphasize the wrong thing and not get to the substance ourselves personally Even in our in our ranks around the message of the last days we can swing and it's interesting the way the prophet brought it there as he swings to the intellectual and he says you could put your name on the church book and say I'm fine that's all I need to do that's the intellectual side as long as I believe all the mysteries of the Bible that's fine all the Mysteries revealed and then he swings in the rest of the quote to the other side and Pentecost will say because I shouted because I smoke in tongues because I had a sensation I'm fine I'm good and Paul all the way back two thousand years ago is saying you can swing either way and not have the right thing how many want the right thing this morning amen so now this more excellent way is for the Bride of Jesus Christ in the last days if all the Corinthians back then didn't catch it this bride is called to Capstone love this bride is called to find this more excellent way my Hunger is that I find this more excellent way more so than a gift more than preaching more than singing more than doing good works I want to find this more excellent way because Paul preached it and I believe at the end time is when this bride comes into that atmosphere to manifest Divine love so we shouldn't leave on just live on just what we do as good works and so now Paul he's going to break things down in the most beautiful words I believe about agape love that's ever been said I believe he's going to be begin to express what is this in First Corinthians 13 and many of you have read it probably everybody's read it and see so what is what this what is Paul's going to bring is the evidence of this mature Capstone love and what it looks like in our everyday life what it looks like in a Christian's life he's going to begin to break down the attributes of this Capstone love and what it looks like in our life and most of it is manifested towards others we know we love God can you say Amen but it's it's it's when we what we're expressing in Christ is not meant just to express to God but it's to be expressed and manifested to everyone else and also it's to be expressed to very difficult situations meeting up with difficult people and a lot of times you think you're thinking of somebody outside the boss or something or the lady who who uh drove by you and got mad at you because you you stayed too long at the red light because you were texting and she comes by and gives you the wrong finger and all that stuff you see but you think it's people like that we need to love that person anyway but the greatest challenge is the people we live with every day because we know them so well and they they know how to get our gizzard they know how to say the right things so this comes down to everyday life and and I've been thinking a lot I think I'm going to preach a sermon about what is the attraction on the mountain as as our Prophet brings that whole uh thing of what was the attraction and he brings it through the Bible and shows that when God did something it was on the mountain Moses brought the word in the mountain and he brings it all through the Bible and Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and Jesus on Mount Calvary it was always on a mount something glorious happening on the mount and what he said what's the attraction on the mountain God's word being fulfilled that's a pretty big attraction and and and we are we get excited about it matter of fact when he come on occult on a little horse there and he come out of the mountain and begin to come out on the mountain olives they were rejoicing it was a rejoicing time they were shouting here he comes and some people were saying who is this they're saying this is the Messiah and here he comes humbly on a coat like Zechariah said he would come he's riding on a coat and they're laying down all the bushes in front of them and they're rejoicing praise be to God he's here so it was a great rejoicing time as he come out of the mount but you see he's coming out of the mount and Jesus knew it's a great rejoicing time you're enjoying me the word being fulfilled but Jesus knew they didn't know but Jesus knew he was headed right down to a great valley and that's to go to Calvary so here's what I've been thinking about and I don't want to say too much because I'll give my sermon away we've been rejoicing for years and the attraction on the mountain because in our day he brought his word in a mountain again and we can rejoice and we can have a great time and we can Rejoice that God's word being fulfilled but when the mountain is over with you've got to come down in the valley when Moses come back out of the glory of God come down the mountain the people were actually rejecting and sinning and all these other things so now the word that was brought had to deal with situations down in the valley you may be able to enjoy the mountain and the glory of God but can you live love in the valley there's the attraction on the mountain but then there's the life in the valley and a lot of people for years in message conventions could shout and glorify God in the revelation of the word being fulfilled but when they come down to into everyday life they didn't have the substance to live everyday life didn't expect too many amens on that one the attraction on the mountain is just that it's an attraction and attraction of God for fulfilling his word is highly attractive and very exciting but the valley is not very exciting the Valley's scary sometimes and the valley has a lot of people that treat us wrong so most of these attributes now are going to be manifesting Christ's Divine Capstone love manifesting it to others mostly to others so we're going to talk about there's 15 characteristics in this love and I don't want you to read them as if this is some type of code to live by or sometimes if I can just do this and get the what would Jesus do bracelet and if I can be more like him and imitate these things don't approach these things this way because Divine love is not something that we put on it only comes by him who is Love by the Holy Ghost but when we have the Holy Ghost if we'll break down our walls and are Prejudiced and all the things and our hurts from the past and be free this is what comes out of Capstone love here it goes and I'm going to break all these down it might take me three or four weeks but I'm going to break them down and you might it might not be a shouting service although it should be why should it be that you would shout what I'm preaching on the moral excellent way because it is the more excellent way I can preach anything today I can preach anything in that Bible these signs shall follow that and then that believe I can preach all of it and because we have a five-fold Ministry we're going to hear all of those things but for this pastor right now I'm going to preach the more excellent way because the bride is supposed to come into a more excellent way can I get an amen and guess what this is the more excellent way it's not that we speak squirrels into existence it's not just that we we have all these other things this is what Paul pointed to as the more excellent way this is the attributes of a Christian who truly has the Holy Ghost everybody's still on board love is patient love divine love is kind love is not jealous love does not brag or boast this Divine capsule love is not proud or arrogant this Divine love is not rude to anybody it's the amens just start falling off falling off it just becomes like complete silence I said love is not rude to somebody else love is not self-seeking I got to go to the next train because next screen because there's more that's only half of them but I feel like I need to hit the altar now love is not easily provoked to anger Divine Capstone love does not keep a record of others wrongs Divine Capstone love does not rejoice with injustices or iniquity it doesn't gloat or get happy over some injustice that's done and they got what come what's coming to them they did that they do not rejoice with injustices or iniquity love rejoices in something it rejoices when truth prevails love bears and protects things that's what Bears all things means it means to protect things love protects things love bears all things we're going to find out the meaning of that it's hard for me not to go into the meanings right now but I just want you to see them all love bears and protects all things and remember now I'm not making this up when Paul said I'm going to show you a more excellent way this is the more excellent way it's not another gift it's not another meeting it's not another rise in a healing campaign this is the more excellent way love bears and protects love love believes the best of things first love always has hope for all things and love endures and holds up during difficulties amen so now we could just close the service right now and have a prayer line but it would be a prayer line to get this because this is a more excellent way no offense now we we have so many needs we we have sickness that's come that's why God gave us an atonement through his atonement he gave us his blood he gave us the stripes upon his back for our healing how many still believe in that I'm dealing with my my wrist this morning is completely gone out I'm in pain right now with it I'm praying for God to heal it while I'm preaching right now this morning I need all the atonement I need physical healing I need emotional healing God's provided for all of it can you say Amen we need healing lines sometimes we need the gifts the gifts are what keep the church clean brother Brown says we need those things but Paul shows a more excellent way we don't want to jump to emphasizing all those things and neglecting the most important part and that's this excellent way this this Dimension that we come into this love that we come into this is him it's not another theory to live by it's not a theory it's this what I read to you is not a code to live by it's not it it's not a code it's Christ in action by Divine Holy Ghost love this is the person of Christ manifested in our lives this part is the is part of the threefold purpose of God which was we know the threefold purpose of God was is to manifest himself to man to come in be man and then for him to get the preeminence in the church how many know that's the third part of the great mystery of God is for him to get the preeminence in the church and I'll tell you when you've come into that Divine love he's going to have the preeminence in your life over all things he's going to conquer all things through love because love is the greatest force in the world holy ghost Capstone love is the greatest there is no demon that's greater than Divine love love cast out all fear love will cast out demons there isn't no problem in your life that the Divine love of God cannot overcome it's greater than a gift well I overcome him with a gift I'll go be prayed for by a minister that's wonderful but this is greater because he can through Divine love he can conquer the worst of your enemies the worst of your troubles there isn't any divorce in this Divine love there isn't splitting up in this Divine love that's carnal that's the world filial love which is another kind of love as we break down from Divine love we break down break down till we have sexual love and then we have perverted love today what Satan calls love and all this perverted love we have in the world but the best of love the best of Love is Capstone love and that's Agape Love Can you say man filial love with a husband and wife have filial love if a man insults his wife he's ready to kill for he's ready he's ready to get put that man and get him in an alley and do something to him you don't insult my life my wife but agape love says don't do that but I'm going to pray for you I want to pray for your lost soul it goes deeper a lot of marriages have filial love but they don't have agape love Amen brother Paul this is when the god Christ has preeminence in the church this is what Paul's laying down even in a prophecy in First Corinthians 13 this is coming there's coming today he will have full preeminence in the church this person of love will be expressed this love will be pre the preeminent thing at the end all the others stuff all the other things will fade with the bride and will no longer be the emphasis and I'm quoting scripture now because he he says in First Corinthians 13. we prophesy in part and we we have these things in part but one day that which is perfect what is come will come and that which is in part will be done away not that it's eliminated but we come to the more excellent way the greatest of these is Charity the greatest of these is divine love all the other stuff will fade with the bride and will no longer be the emphasis I can safely say that I've seen the prophecy of the faith of the original book of Pentecost and the book of Acts restored in my lifetime I've seen it restored to the church with the signs following the Believers I have watched that for years it's not something coming we're living in the original faith of Pentecost we've been restored back to the original faith of Pentecost it has been expressed now for many years but there's one thing that still needs manifested more if you'll agree with me this morning there's one thing that still needs more manifestation and see it come to Perfection and that's Divine love it's token love it's true Holy Ghost love there's one quote and I don't have it up here but it's just very small and he says so did the Pentecostal people but the Pentecostal people as great as they had it they begin to organize in the Oneness and threeness and trinitarians and all kinds of an organization now can you imagine a church in Souza Street on so powerful the restoration of the gifts so many manifestations dead on gifts all over going on and yet he says it ends up in division it ends up in different denominations and then he goes he says it splits into Oneness and threeness and trinitarians we didn't think Pentecost would do that but they did all kinds of organizations and then he says and fussing and pulling at one another and it proved that the token wasn't showing malice Envy strife but that's what it got to now friends I'm going to be very careful what I say but here he's pointing to a group that have all the gifts flowing and manifesting but because they had malice and envy and strife and fussing with one another he said it shows the token the Holy Ghost isn't showing oh my I'm gonna get myself in trouble you can have all that manifesting and still not have the token but I thought the token produced those things it does produce those things but more than anything else it'll produce Divine love for God and for one another and he said if you see fussing and stewing and division going on in the body of Christ and preachers fighting with preachers and fighting back and forth on Doctrine and going back and forth across their Pulpit it shows that something's missing something's not quite there yet we're not there yet we haven't come to a victory in Divine love yet shows the token isn't showing so if you have somebody who's got about 10 years of fussing and stewing and he's preaching this message but he's fussing and stewing with preachers and debating and going on I can say I don't know if the token's showing there yet preaching gifted and preach like an angel but the token's not showing because it's fussing and it's envy and strife and Malice this is God's holy ghost reaction to What life will give you and how people treat you it's God's response to things this is God's Holy Ghost God living a person God's Divine love reaction and response to what life dishes you out it's not how your boss responds it's not how you would respond carnally it's not what the first thought that comes to your mind sometimes and what to do to somebody this is God's reaction this is God's love manifesting so it's God's response to things I'm throwing out some things what this Divine love is and I'll come to this later because I'm going to get back to breaking down some of these attributes it's the reason I keep elaborating is I want you to know don't put this in some psychological uh thing that we do and here's okay those 15 things there'll be people in here that lean towards uh uh more left-brained people that say okay let me write those down and I am going to send this out to you and and print some of these out because I know some people like to have the scriptures and quotes I'm going to do that for you but some people they're bent towards okay 15 there's 15 things love does this it does this it does this and does that okay if I can just do that this week I'm going to call this person because I need to do this more to them this is not psychology and I Don't Preach psychology I preach the Holy Ghost but I also believe when you get emptied out and filled in your spirit with the Holy Ghost this is the excellent way that you'll be manifesting by Holy Ghost Capstone love so it's not just oh oh if I could just no no no it's saying Lord I want to know that I have your spirit Within Me and whatever's clouding the way I want to see these I want to see this image manifested more in my life and I lay my life before you remember what the prophet said about idolatry he said in the Old Testament when they had idolatry and still today he said they would bow down before an image there was a a frog or some type of image in a statue and they would get down and they bow before it and they believe that they've worshiped that image that that image that God would come in that image and speak back to them he said in Christianity we're not what we're bowing before is the image of Jesus Christ right and so now we're not looking for something to speak back to us he says we bow before the perfect image of Jesus Christ we yield to it we lay before him this these characteristics say Lord there's your image and as I bow down in my heart before it speak it back through me because I want to be the image I want to be the statue of a perfect man can I get an amen praise the Lord so this is I'm I'm separating this from any kind of uh thing that we just do and put on but no this is and also we want to go into this this is also an atmosphere uh uh I'm gonna throw this out to you that in 1955 and 1956 there were several incidences that the prophet began to share that happened in his life and they were an atmosphere that come over him when he had extreme demons coming after him and also animals that could have destroyed him you know the stories and we'll read them because a lot of our young Generations don't know him but they're not just stories but there are times when he said at that moment when there was a killer Bowl it was a killer Bowl in the field and he was caught in the field and the bull was headed towards him he said something came over him and instead of hating that he said he began to have this overwhelming love back towards it and that love had an atmosphere and by the time that bowl got to him he in boldness said in the name of Jesus Christ Bo I didn't come to bother the area I I love you I'm sorry for coming into your field but in the name of Jesus Christ before you get to me you bow and you lay down in front of me and as soon as it got to him something come over him something come over the bowl and he laid down when he was mowing the grass a big Hornet's bee's nest was stirred up and he says I'm sorry for doing that he said something come over him and instead of getting angry or running or whatever we do he loved it and spoke to the bees and there was more than just words there because something got across to the bees I didn't mean to do that he loved them and they all turned around not one sting turned around and went back in back into the ground he said a maniac went on the platform while he was praying for the sick and he says I'm going to tear you to pieces I'm gonna I'll show you I'll break every bone in your body tonight demon possessed man and he said something come over him in one place he said oh I wish I could have that all the time and when he said that I say he had little temporary places where that love come over him in that real overwhelming way and when it come over he said I wish I had that I'll tell you I'm praying that's what my life I I want to come into that I wish I could have that all the time I believe it's the promise of the Bride not just a psychological exercise but it's the promise that because of this decision you've made this will bring their tremendous victory in Divine love that we can live like that all the time it's an atmosphere and it must have been a power That Conquers demons demons and animals or demons and people and the maniac he runs over to Tara's body tear him up and he says his thoughts turn to thinking within himself he said now that man has a family somewhere he's lacking love in his life instead of looking at a man who's demon possessed ready to tear him to pieces he began to love the man's soul and see why he come from that and sympathy for him when that love came in so overwhelmingly it was more powerful than the demons in that man broke him down that man come up got so close to him he hopped up in his throat and spitting brother Bottom's Faith over the pulpit most of you I don't know how you would react with somebody hawked and spit junk in your face but he's saying the only way is something come over him and overwhelmed him and I love the man he said in the name of Jesus he said I'll you'll he said you'll you'll fall to your feet and bow before me today and that man said I'll show you whose feet is going to bow to and he come after him and something broke him and he did fall right at brother bradham's feet and what did he attribute to love love was more powerful in that case he didn't he didn't necessarily have a healing line it was something else working there can I get an amen this morning so now let's start breaking these down here are you still on board this morning that clock in the back says one o'clock but we gain an hour so we're only at noon I love this time of year I love daylight savings time I love it you say brother Paul you're thinking you've got an extra hour preach because of that yes I do I get an extra hour to preach I'm going to break these things down and I've been breaking them down looking at the Greek words for these words looking the Amplified looking through different things researching it and I don't want just man's opinion but I want to know what these words mean when he says love is patient and that's the first one love is patient scripture says now we exhort your brother and warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men and the Amplified we earnestly urge you Believers admonish those who are out of line the undisciplined the unruly the disorderly admonish those ones give them a slight rebuke because they're out of line they're undisciplined they're unruly give them a slight rebuke do that to those who are unruly encourage the timid those who lack spiritual courage courage encourage the timid help the spiritually weak these are things that we want to do as Christians be patient with everyone always controlling your temper so when we look at this word patient it means that It suffers long it never gives up it is slow to lose its patience it does not demonstrate irritations or reflect anger or have a quick temper I'm going to say that again it does not demonstrate irritations or reflect anger or have a quick temper and as I said these things are really tested in the people we live around every day more than anybody else I I'm some of these attributes I'm taking from a couple Christian writers one of them is Stephen Cole he was a pastor and I'm taking some of those things from him and then uh there was Sam Levinson said you know one thing about love at first sight is easy to understand loving somebody at First Sight it's when two people have been looking at each other for years that love becomes a miracle but it's not really a miracle it's the result of yielding to God repeatedly confronting our selfishness and daily practicing biblical love in our homes the Greek word for patient comes from two words meaning long tempered long tempered that's in the Greek if you're patient you're slow to anger you endure personal wrongs without retaliating if you bear with others imperfections false uh differences you bear with other people's imperfections faults and differences you give them time to change room to make mistakes without coming down hard too quickly on them do you do that men with your wife and children and he's asking some questions as a pastor here do you do that with others do you do that with your wife and children at home you you give them time to change room to make mistakes without coming down hard you bear with other imperfections faults and reminding you of the scripture he said be patient with everyone always always controlling your temper so this patience it goes further just just little human patience it's divine love patience it's his patience expressed and you know the reason you know the best place we can see it God's Divine patience with you all this originates in God can you say Amen how much patience has he had with you how many times should he have lost his temper over you but when this flows from the very throat of God through the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a patience that goes beyond just human patience can you say Amen and it goes beyond here's here's an example of it going Beyond in the late 1500s Dr Thomas Cooper edited a dictionary with the addition of 33 000 words and many other improvements to the dictionary he had already been collecting materials for eight years eight years he did this when his wife a rather difficult woman went into a study one day while he was gone and burned all of his notes under the pretense of fearing that he would kill himself studying too much she burned everything eight years of work a pile of Ashes Dr Cooper came home saw the destruction asked who had done it his wife told him boldly that she had done it the patient man heaved a deep sigh and said oh Dinah Dinah thou has given a world of trouble thou has given a world of trouble that's the way they said it again back then thou Dinah you have given thou have given a world of trouble that's all he said then he quietly sat down to another eight years of hard labor to replace the notes which she had destroyed that was it next time you think you've arrived at being patient I'll read that story to you again give you something to aim for brother Bram says and we should have patience with one another we get so much impatient with one another like I've tried to get this message over at the Tabernacle his own church I've tried to get the message over the Tabernacle to see that each member of the Tabernacle become this become this what patient with one another are you listening patient with one another I've tried to get the Tabernacle to this to be patient with one another it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this 33 years see have patience women still Bob their hair still just the same but just have patience even one time and that's not the biggest thing you know just the hair in First Corinthians you say where do you get that go to your Bible Paul talks about the difference in a woman's hair in man's hair it's in the Bible it's not anything we teach weird here it's in the bible let me believe that amen so but still still women Bob their hair still just say but just have patience every one time when that Rebellion a bunch of people had such pop impatience they caused Moses to do something was wrong but yet when it come down there was times that Moses lost his patience but then when it come down The Showdown God got sick of their actions the children of Israel he said separate yourself Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them how many know that Bible says that God says I'll I'll kill the whole bunch of them and start a new start a new group of people Moses throwed himself on the breach and said God don't do it God don't do it what patience with people that was rebelling against him I wonder if we could do that who was it in Moses that stood in between God and the people and said Lord don't destroy him this is your people think of your testimony you raised these people up he's reasoning with God who was it in Moses standing in the gap having patience with God's people's Rebellion Christ was in Moses and when Christ is in US it's christ-like patience can you say Amen and he says church we need to have patience with people they're wearing this they're doing this they're cheating on their taxes they're being sneaky they're gossiping they're oh my and some of it's just they don't know better some of it's just outright Rebellion and he's teaching us there's no other reaction except patience and prayer to say God deal with that Rebellion but as far as me they're only going to get one thing from me the patience of God we're going to keep loving you we're going to keep preaching to you we're going to keep wooing you on to more of Christ I'm not going to look at the outside I'm going to look at what God's doing on the inside how many want the patience of divine Divine love the patience part of it about 10 of us all right I think all of us want more of divine love Capstone patients we need it can you say amen he says there's an old Tabernacle people there for years 33 years past and still rebellious still doing their own thing what's your what's our reaction patience patience there is no other correct reaction than patience amen we all praise the Lord the next one is love is kind love is kind be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you in the Amplified it says be kind and helpful to one another tenderhearted compassionate understanding forgiving one another readily and freely just as God in Christ also forgave you so the first thing that we see about the kindness of divine love kindness being expressed to one another it is closely related to forgiveness the word forgiveness is mentioned with kindness because really you can't manifest true kindness towards someone unless you're forgiving to someone it's when we're not kind is that when we're not being forgiving we haven't forgiven them for something we're holding a grudge of something they did to US 10 years ago they're never going to be in in my eyes the same they did this that's it that's an unforgiving Spirit that'll bind you did you realize it's not binding them it's binding you can I say it can I say it forgiveness is not releasing them as much as it is releasing you but they need to come and apologize they need to give me a full explanation of what they did wrong they need to come and give me the all the points and they need to list all the things that they've hurt me by I'm not finding that in the Bible I'm not finding it with the kindness of God their repentance and I believe fruits to repentance I believe that but the repentance of God is Not to Come for countless hours and for you to write down and make a whole list and you know what we did to our kids is that you did that bad so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do this you had to write it 50 times I'm not doing it I'm not going to do this I'm not going to say that bad word I'm not going to say that bad I'm not going to say that bad word we do these things with our kids you know but but God doesn't do that all right you did you had a bad thought the other day you need to write it God says write it a million times and when you're done then I'll forgive you can't find it and it's not us I'm going to lose some of you but that's okay it's not us who determine the change of a heart it's not us who gives the rules of how much they have to do before I forgive them I'm not talking about just human kindness here I'm talking about Capstone love the more excellent way and all you need to do to find out what it's like is compare it to God's love to you amen God does not manifest the forgiveness and a kindness to you that is determined on so many things he requires true repentance he wants true repentance but it's by the heart and guess what someone at a moment's time at their heart can be changed in one second and God knows it and when they're sincere as brother Josiah read the scripture Sunday I love that the promise we we come into relationship because of a promise not because we deserve it we're promised to come into relationship wasn't that good but not one time does God make that a requirement all these requirements is at one moment someone's heart can change and God knows that more than anybody and it's changed the heart's changed is it that person may need he needs to go make things right he needs to go apologize he means to do it but in God's eyes he's already forgiven because God's seen the sincerity he really means it when it's hard his heart's been changed praise the Lord the kindness the kindness of God be kind and helpful to one another tenderhearted not hard-hearted tenderness tenderhearted may the Lord Jesus I pray this morning take the harshness out of my heart towards people take the hard bitter years of things and then when somebody does a similar thing to me my heart becomes hard again oh God deliver me from that give me a tender heart towards everybody no matter what they've done past present or future the only thing that's going to come out of this vessel is kindness towards that person God give it to me if nobody in this congregation gets a hold of this I want to get a hold of this excellent way it's my promise can you say Amen brother Josiah this is my promise this glorious victory in Divine love is the bride's promise for this hour and because it is a promise I have inherited all the promises of God be kind to one another tenderhearted to one another compassionate understanding forgiving to one another and it doesn't give a list of certain ones you have a list of certain ones that they get that and the other ones don't get it but he doesn't say but there's other ones you know it's just no way no way Tammy Faye no way it's the kindness tender heart and gentle has ability to soothe hurt feelings to calm and upset person to help quietly in practical ways and the reason to say this is the Greek word comes from a word meaning useful this is the kindness in the Greek word is useful a kind person is disposed to be helpful instead instead of being not helpful if you've got a bad attitude towards them that's not helping the matter if you're gossiping about them it's not helping people but kindness becomes useful how can I become useful to see a result to this a kind person is disposed to be helpful he seeks out needs and looks for opportunities to meet those needs without repayment he is tender and forgiving when he or she is wronged he expresses kindness this kindness responds with kindness to people that are being harsh towards you the Bible says in the Old Testament a soft answer turns away Wrath a soft kind answer turns away Wrath and so be kind to one another tender heart and forgive you it's tied to forgiveness in fact forgiveness is the spirit that would actually make a person be more kind forgiveness there needs to be more talk about forgiveness God's forgiveness God's love of forgiveness it's hard to forgive others when we haven't really realized the complete forgiveness God has given us it starts with us before we can give it out you have to examine yourself how much has God forgiven you and if some of you think well he hasn't had to forgive me for a lot because I haven't really done a lot bad so you're looking at the other person and they're bad that's really bad but your bad isn't that bad because you've been in church and you wore the right dresses and you did the right things and and you know the preachers and my I have some bad but it's not as bad as this who who died and made you boss of bad who put you in charge of terming determining what was bad my Bible says he that's guilty of the lease is guilty of the whole we got levels smoking and drugs and drinking and all this and we got bad that's really bad that's bad but in God's books I can go back there to Psalms or Proverbs somewhere it is he says the seven things that God hates and there wasn't any smoking and drinking in there it was one who sows Discord among the Brethren it was one who has hatred in their heart that's the things God hates so who determines what's bad and if you're saying my bad is not as bad as bad this guy's bad bad's bad's bad you already have something bad you have pride you have a religious spirit you think you're better than everybody you never find the Forgiveness that you need to forgive somebody else unless you look at yourself first because whatever they did you without God are capable of doing the very same thing I didn't expect to say this this morning but I'm saying it you without any of God in your life are capable of doing everything that person that's so bad that you think and you can't forgive you're capable of it you would do it without any restraints you would have done the same thing you would have looked at the same thing you would have committed adultery the same way now we start to come into feeling unworthy before God and then grateful to God that the only way that I'm worthy is because of Calvary because before that person stuck a needle in his arm before that person got addicted to pornography before that person become an alcoholic before they did any of that they were already a sinner unacceptable to God so don't give me these levels of different things that say Lord I realize you've really forgiven me of a lot forgiveness is tied to kindness if you have something in your heart to forgive you're going to be more kind to people Lord I need this I don't know about you this morning but I need this I do not want this to be just a sermon May I'm not putting on a show but I mean this if you weren't in the room any of you today are listening online I could look over these things and come before my God and say God I need this I need this more excellent way brother Bram says about kindness be kind one to another be kind to your enemies love everybody no matter what they done love them anyhow and if you can't do that brother sister if there was a time you need a at the altar it's thin so if you can't do it you need an altar you need an altar of repentance that's the answer it's not saying Lord help me be brother and get in your car and go home it's you need an altar in your heart and an altar here you need an altar if you can't do it brother sister if there was a time you need you need an altar when you come back create when you come back create and I recognize the other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me of saying this man is wrong and I ought to tell him about it that's wrong remember I'm saying that man's wrong and God's saying you're wrong you're wrong in your attitude he's wrong and I'm gonna go say something about it and the whole attitude God says you're wrong God is the one to tell him about it that's not it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and to love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy you're all enemies of God you're maybe not this morning but before you come to the Lord You're an enemy of God you're one of his enemies oh no I was a good person you were an enemy of God and he loved his enemies he showed kindness to his enemies he loved me that's right when I was unlovely Jesus Christ loved me when I was in his enemy that's right when I was unlovely he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely let me love them the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in US amen I love him I love him oh my reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother and sister and love one another with undying love you say well I just can't I just can't well just stay here a little longer and then you will like people too you'll love those who doesn't love you that's really a good sign of Christianity when you can from your heart love those who don't love you love the unovable Jesus said if you just do favors for those that do favors you well the publicans do the same that's why I'm saying this love is not something the world could produce if you're only nice to the people and have have so and so over because she's your friend you have them over for steak and then you have somebody else over for hot dogs thank you or you don't even have them over something's wrong you're a little bit you're playing favorites they're respecter of persons and I I was setting myself up there for a invite to a steak dinner right there if you do favors for those who do favors for you well the publicans do the same but you see you must be kind to those who are unkind to you see kindness do good for those who would do even do you always remember keep that before you that God is watching you love divine love is patient love is kind how many understand just a little bit more of what kindness is can we do one more today love is not jealous love is not jealous so before I read the scriptures it says here about jealousy now the word means it leans in the Greek to an eagerly desire it is used both positively and negatively in the Bible jealousy in the negative sense is related to Greed and selfishness the jealous person wants what others have he wants things for himself he is too selfish to applaud others success he has to have all the attention in the family a jealous husband refuses to trust his wife he doesn't want to recognize her abilities and contributions he is jealous of the time she spends sometimes even with the children and with her friends he wants it all for himself whoo wow he's jealous of everyone else even closeness in his life because he wants all that attention to himself jealous of the time she spends with the children or family and friends he wants it all for himself I'm not saying this this Christian writer's saying it just so you don't throw the tomatoes in me James says now we're in the Book of James jealousy is often the source of quarrels and conflicts throw s Bob James 4 2 from Once come Wars and fightings among you come they not of your own lust so so um jealousy most the time is the source of arguments and quarrels and fussing it's what Satan's beginning to use jealousy to cause tensions and fights ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have him cannot obtain yet fight you fight in war yet you have not because you ask not and that's in the Book of James so the prophet he said you know the prophet said the start of all the children Israel going into bondage how did they get there was the jealousy of his Joseph's brothers your brother Brian said the start of the murder of king of Kane Cain murdering Abel was jealousy he murdered he murdered him but it was the start was a jealousy because Abel brought a sacrifice God was pleased with it and instead of and this is the way he said instead of Cain saying Abel my brother praise the Lord God's endorsed your sacrifice you got a real Revelation there brother and I'm going to come alongside you I'm going to help you with this get this animal up on here and I'm going to join with you and I'm going to ask God to forgive me and ask God to give me the same revelation of what sacrifice I can bring that's acceptable that's what Cain should have said and guess what if he would have come the Bible says God said I would have accepted even Cain who was serpent seed that's how God's grace can come can't limit God's grace if he had come and done the same sacrifice God would have had to accept that sacrifice but he should have said Abel my brother I haven't grown as much as you but you have excelled you've got signs fall in your life you've got things going on you've excelled in the excellent love I see a Divine love but see instead of rejoicing in someone else growing further than us and saying praise the Lord somebody is get into rapturing Faith here I wouldn't criticize somebody brother Brown says I come into the faith of Enoch to be raptured I wouldn't criticize that I want to come on to the same Faith but instead in our humanness instead of looking and said I praise God they've been blessed and they've been accepted by God you can see Prosperity over their whole life I want to do what they do I want to find what I want to learn from them instead it's jealousy and jealousy brings fusses and stews and murder murder can you imagine so angry at that person I wanna I wouldn't kill him but I'd do something real close jealousy it's the opposite of selfless love it's selfish love it's got to all be directed back to just three people Me Myself and I it's all they care about just three people me myself and I jealousy will do this the Greed for what others have I never had it like them we're not to compare ourselves with one another so I'm going to start ending now on this quote and yeah I'm gonna end on this one because we can't go further we got several other attributes to go so we'll continue on another time Third Exodus he says God give us a Pentecost he gave us a Pentecost he gave us the book of Acts he gave us the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us he gave us a land and why are we out of it why is the church out of it 1963 why is the church Ottawa why isn't the great Christian church today living again like the book of Acts bringing forth the same thing it's a good question why isn't the book of Acts bringing for the same there's some reason for it now we all know that we're broke up and we're in a terrible condition and the most terrible condition that Christianity has ever lived in is today broke up in different denominations Christianity is a mass 33 000 different denominations within Christianity all these other split UPS all this divide it's not the token that's not the Holy Ghost that's not what God intended and right here in the brim of the brick of the great tariff Terrible Terror terrific judgment laying for the church and before this judgment can happen God is calling it Exodus just like he did then the Amorite sin was heaped up so he's calling a spiritual Exodus they went down in Egypt now this is I skipped along in the quote and I'm unveiling the reason why that that they got out of their promise they got out of their land how many has ever been in the flow of being filled with the spirit and living that during the day and you just felt God leading you and you felt filled with the spirit how many Believers have felt that before that is your land signs following them that believe the Book of Acts Church repeated again that's a typical day in the life of a son and daughter of God should be a typical day but how he's ever felt that and then all of a sudden something happened you don't feel that again there's a lot of reasons but sometimes it's you got out of your land and when you get out of your land well here's what I'm getting how do you get out of your land here's one of the reasons again that's the reason Israel was in Egypt at that time out of the land remember God's promises was only as long as they stayed in the land they went down into Egypt a couple lines up I missed it all because of the jealousy of a brother laughs God's people went into 400 years of bondage away from God away from their land because of one thing it started with jealousy of a brother not a heathen their own brother now something if jealousy green jealousy Wicked jealousy one time the prophet said pure jealousy and then he corrected himself no no there can't be anything like pure jealousy but if jealousy can be so bad that it actually brought a people of God in bondage for 400 years then I'd say it's something we better bring before the Lord because it can cause a lot of division in the church in your marriage in your relationships with your children it can bring a lot of things jealousy can bring a lot of things as I said quarrels arguments irritations fussing how many loves to argue only me nobody's going to raise their hand but nobody answered it nobody loves because most of the time it doesn't and we argue to win we're going to win you know you argue with a four-year-old and it's a battle who's going to win and you parents have to win but but like when you get in with adults and relationships and marriages and stuff it's and if it's all about winning I'm going to win this that's not the approach so we argue because we're out to win Dwight Moody said I'd rather win souls than win arguments I'd rather win souls and spend my time winning Souls than winning arguments it's a good feeling to win an argument to argue to get okay and you won at the end that's why we do it there's a jealousy to to want to win I'm going to win I'm going to win what if we were just to let that go and release and release that jealousy and release all that back and there'd be less arguments there will be less fusses less fightings less Wars say Lord kill all the jealousy in me I don't want to have any jealousy and if we kill the jealousy we kill the arguments we kill more of the tension what kind of homes would we have if we say Lord take the jealousy in my heart and Lord Purge it by the Holy Spirit what kind of more kind homes patient homes loving homes would we have what kind of marriages would we have if jealousy would not come in the picture I'm here to end this today to say they got out of their land starting with jealousy and I'm gonna venture to say that a lot of times when we step out of our promise and out of our land of the Holy Ghost and out of our walking in Divine love every day it's some type of jealousy that's popped up and if we can recognize and expose the enemies they I know what you're doing I know where this is going I know what you're trying to do here I know you're trying to be all right if we could catch it before I say I'm not I don't want to go there I don't want to go to that argument it's gonna we're gonna say things we don't mean we're gonna we're we're not gonna speak to one another for two days I don't want to I've learned I don't want to go there I want to go a different way so Lord take the jealousy out of my heart I don't trying to be someone else I'm not trying to be jealous of that person I have the blessings you've given me bless them Lord and may I respect and honor them and not be jealous of their gifts and what God's blessed them to do and who they are as a person see in a marriage you have to respect who they are as a person you have to respect who they are as a person people come along and say Hey you know uh the one guy there years ago years ago not now so you don't think I'm talking about you if my wife would just clean her house like sister so and so we had a sister she kept her house immaculate it was so clean and it was it was amazing I have to say and it was just beautiful but he's sitting in the if she if she would do this and do this and do this and serve do this that then we wouldn't have any marriage problems if she would just keep the house clean we wouldn't have any marriage problems boy you need to go back to your mama tell us you married a four-year-old here and a lot of girls do they marry a they may report your older 16 year old hasn't really left mama it's all about himself or she does the thing and she's all about herself she's coming into marriage it's all about her and she moved it no no that's that's not love that's not agape love it's not about Mom and Dad anymore it's about you two growing in Grace and knowledge Jesus Christ and respecting one another can you say amen and he said if she would just keep her house clean like sister so and so I won't mention her name if she would just do that I said no no no and comparing his wife and not looking at the gifts that she did have and the kind of person she was and I said I said you didn't marry sister so and so you married this person you took a vow and when you took a vow you said in sickness and in health I'm the preacher I made you repeat it I know this stuff I got the book I read it and young people don't value it when you take that you take it before God and before Witnesses and it should mean what you say in sickness and health for richer for poor fat skinny no it doesn't say that till death do us part it's a vow it's a commitment it's this I didn't marry this and you don't try to take somebody help me this morning you do not try to take the image of the perfect one you think that's a perfect this and perfect God and try to fit that image into this guy or this girl you're marrying that is wrong brother sister you took a vow and embraced all of them who they are weaknesses everything that's what love does you know seriously I wish I would have that I wish I had this a little bit of that and some do it I'm gonna go get a new model or a model this is who God has given you and I'm not you know there's I'm not belittling anybody here that has a different marriage God knows your life and God has blessed you that's that's fine but you see now when you marry you know now some of you that have been divorced and remarried you're not you now you know some of this and you don't compare with other ones I embrace and love every part of this person good or bad and we grow together I didn't expect to say any of this this morning seriously I didn't sit last night and write this all down specific this this part's all free you don't put that person and you don't put people in the church that way you don't say I want everybody to act this way and act this way towards me it's not going to happen but I love them for who they are good bad ugly whatever it is because I know that's the only way to draw them out of themselves to become not the other guy or Christian you're looking at or not to become brother Paul and oh don't do that that they become the image of Christ because that's what you're doing sister or brother that's what you're doing is that you're saying Lord take my Falls take my weaknesses take my mistakes I don't know why this happened I don't know why I did that but Lord I bring it under your blood and God I'm saying now help me not to ever do that again and Lord why did I do it and they're exploring they're going to the heart journey the Heart Journey why you do things the inbred things in you the heart journey is the most dangerous Journey you ever take and most people don't take it because it's too scary but you go the hard journey and say why am I this way the devil's got this he's attached to himself this God I've come to Christ I've come to you to all this stuff that I can overcome these things that are by past history and I can become into the image of Jesus Christ but when you come to image of Jesus Christ he doesn't get rid of your personality I want my husband to be a I just don't like even I don't like even his personality I wish he would be more like somebody different than him when God changed you he didn't change your personality he didn't change your gifts he made all that that's Gibson callings are without repentance he gave you all that inbred in you born in you that's who I am but brother sister don't ever justify and say a temper and belittling your kids and belittling your wife and cussing at your employees don't you ever say that's just me that ain't you that's the devil on you that's it's destroyed your relationship with your children it's destroyed can you say Amen don't you ever say that's just me and Justified that's not you that's the devil on you and that's the part you got to overcome and become into one image not brother Paul not brother Bob not there not brother Kenny but the image of Jesus Christ and you be who you are through Christ who strengthens you and it's in our weakness that he becomes strong to acknowledge our weaknesses he becomes strong because his strength is perfect when our strength is gone I'm going to sing that now as the missions musicians come but listen to me is anybody getting anything out of these attributes of the excellent way [Applause] this to me is the Revival of the Bride this is the Capstone love she comes into the whole culmination of the entire message that you
