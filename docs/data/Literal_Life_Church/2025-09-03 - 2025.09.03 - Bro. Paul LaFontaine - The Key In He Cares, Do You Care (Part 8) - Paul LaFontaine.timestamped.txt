[11:05] something greater. Amen. Cuz just like
[11:08] Peter, he can he can deny Christ. But

[11:13] soul in that day of Pentecost, when it's
[11:15] settled in Peter, Amen, that's when he's
[11:18] not turning back at all cuz he's got
[11:20] something inside him that holds him

[11:43] is dark
[11:47] and it's hard to see.
[11:50] [Music]
[11:52] What you are doing here in the ruins and
[11:56] where this will lead.

[13:35] when the options are few.
[13:40] When I can't see what you're doing, I
[13:43] know that you're proving you're the God
[13:46] who comes through.
[13:48] Hallelujah. Oh, but I know
[13:54] that over the years

[20:51] God.
[20:55] There is none like you.
[21:01] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Let's
[21:03] turn in our Bibles tonight to Romans
[21:05] chapter 10. God bless you all and we
[21:08] appreciate you being in the house of God
[21:09] tonight. Those joining in with us from
[21:12] different places. Uh we serve a
[21:15] wonderful Lord and it's a privilege to
[21:16] be able to gather together and break
[21:18] bread together tonight.
[21:20] Everybody doing for my challenge on
[21:22] Sunday?
[21:24] Don't don't answer that. Praise the
[21:27] Lord. I can tell you Monday was a rough
[21:29] day and uh I did a little repenting
[21:32] Monday. Um, but the last two days been a
[21:35] little better. So maybe it's just the
[21:36] devil fighting it. But uh, God bless you
[21:39] with that. And, uh, we encourage you in
[21:41] the Lord. I think, uh, after a month, I
[21:44] believe that we'll see some fruit come
[21:45] from it for sure.
[21:47] Romans chapter 10 tonight. And, uh, we
[21:50] continue with talking about the key and
[21:52] he cares. Do you care? If you've been
[21:54] listening along, we've been taking that
[21:56] message and just breaking it down. And
[21:58] there's a lot of keys in it actually,
[22:00] but there's a real main key, I think,
[22:02] and it's how to get a hold of God and
[22:04] how to set ourselves in a position
[22:05] towards him, to a God who really cares.
[22:08] And so, we'll break that down a little
[22:09] bit more tonight. This is part eight.
[22:11] And uh we'll just go into the word.
[22:13] Romans chap 10:9,
[22:15] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[22:18] mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
[22:21] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[22:23] from the dead, thou shalt be saved. I
[22:26] don't know if you noticed two things
[22:27] there that are crucial, very important
[22:29] things and that is the confession of the
[22:31] mouth and believing with all your heart.
[22:34] That's the two things that brother Brand
[22:36] actually mentions in this sermon. He
[22:38] cares. Do you care? So, uh, it's such a
[22:41] it's a a wonderful thing to have a
[22:45] scriptural prophet sent to us in the
[22:47] last days because more and more
[22:49] throughout the years as I study it,
[22:51] received the Holy Ghost when I was 16
[22:53] years old and that gave me a great
[22:55] hunger to find out what this Bible said
[22:58] and find out the prophet of this age and
[23:00] what he said. And every time everything
[23:02] comes back to the scripture. So two
[23:04] things here is that if you'll confess
[23:06] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall
[23:08] believe in thine heart that God hath
[23:10] raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
[23:11] saved. For with the heart man believeth
[23:14] unto righteousness, and with the mouth
[23:16] confession is made unto salvation. For
[23:20] the scripture saith, whosoever believeth
[23:23] on him shall not be ashamed. Amen. Now,
[23:27] what we read last Wednesday night was in
[23:30] James and talking about healing and the
[23:33] confession that goes with it. So, I want
[23:35] to add that in again because we'll be
[23:37] speaking along those lines again
[23:38] tonight. James chapter 5 and verse 13.
[23:44] Uh, actually just put in verse six,
[23:46] verse 16. Confess your faults one to
[23:48] another and pray for one another that ye
[23:51] may be healed. The effectual fervent
[23:53] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[23:56] How many can say amen? Amen. May God
[23:59] bless the reading of his word tonight.
[24:01] May he bless our service together. You
[24:02] may be seated. Praise the Lord. So, we
[24:07] should really pay attention tonight to
[24:09] the study in the word of the two things
[24:11] that are spoken of here, confession and
[24:14] believing with all of our heart, because
[24:16] they're perfectly lined up with he
[24:18] cares. Do you care? Um, this is what God
[24:21] is bringing in this message is God's
[24:23] provided way. It is the entrance to the
[24:27] power of God. It's the entrance to uh a
[24:31] God who cares. And if we've learned
[24:34] something through this, we learn that
[24:35] God cares not by just saying, "I really
[24:37] care." But God cares when he uh backs up
[24:41] his word and he steps into situations.
[24:44] He steps into impossible situations. God
[24:47] doesn't just say he cares, but he steps
[24:50] in to help. He steps in to do what needs
[24:52] to be done. Shouldn't we be a people
[24:54] that not don't just say we care, but we
[24:57] have actions to our caring as well? God
[24:59] as our father is excell that way and so
[25:02] we should be that way as well. So this
[25:04] this becomes an entrance to the power of
[25:06] God. You never will connect with a God
[25:09] who steps in if you have a hesitant
[25:12] heart or that that wants to believe
[25:15] 100%. You never connect with a God who
[25:18] steps in if you have a hesitant heart
[25:21] and if you have a wrong confession or a
[25:23] lack of confession. If you're missing
[25:25] those two elements, then you limit the
[25:28] power of God and what he can do. Can you
[25:30] say amen? Those two things are key
[25:32] things in the scripture and they're key
[25:34] things that brother Brand was brought up
[25:36] to us and they're key things and it's
[25:38] still true today. God works in these
[25:40] this provided way to get to him and to
[25:43] get to answers and to get to uh some
[25:45] things that we need in our lives. We'll
[25:47] never get there. We'll never connect
[25:49] with him if we have a hesitant heart. If
[25:52] we have an unbelieving heart, if we have
[25:54] a heart that's uh not allin and only
[25:57] God, you and God know if you have a
[25:59] heart that's not allin. You know, it's
[26:02] it's got to be a heart. And when God
[26:04] looks, he sees a heart and he sees
[26:06] they're they may be saying something,
[26:08] but their heart all ain't all in yet.
[26:10] It's not they're not giving 100%. God
[26:12] sees that. And so it makes God just uh
[26:15] be be restrained a bit because he wants
[26:18] two things. He wants to have a heart
[26:21] that believes 110% from the depths of a
[26:25] heart. And he also wants our confession
[26:27] to be the right confession. So those two
[26:29] things are here in scripture. I also
[26:31] want you to notice a couple other things
[26:33] that those things lead to two very
[26:35] important things and that is uh the way
[26:37] he says it. He says with the mouth we
[26:40] believe unto righteousness and we excuse
[26:42] me with the heart we believe under
[26:44] righteousness and then with the mouth
[26:45] unto salvation. Those are two uh some of
[26:49] the most important things that we can
[26:50] have in God is his righteousness and
[26:53] salvation. I'm going to be real simple
[26:55] tonight. Uh this this this is uh the
[26:58] ABCs. But the two things that we want is
[27:01] we need salvation when we're lost. We
[27:03] need salvation.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; And only he can save us. Can you save
[27:07] me? Young people, you can't just jump to
[27:09] the algebra and say, "I'm going to make
[27:11] the rapture because I'm in the message."
[27:13] No. You need salvation. You were lost.
[27:16] You were lost when you were born. And
[27:19] God provided a way for salvation for
[27:21] you. And you have to receive that with
[27:24] all of your heart. You have to confess
[27:25] him. And then we come into these gifts
[27:28] that he gave us. And that is that he
[27:30] gives us salvation, but he also passes
[27:34] his righteousness onto us because our
[27:38] righteousness is as filthy rags. But the
[27:42] gift is he says, "If you'll confess and
[27:44] believe with all your heart, I'll pass
[27:46] my righteousness unto you." Now,
[27:47] friends, that's pretty important things.
[27:49] Before we talk about other reasons why
[27:51] we confess and other things like that,
[27:53] this is basic tonight. And I think it's
[27:55] important that we realize that even
[27:57] these elements of confessing, even these
[28:00] elements of believing 100% in your heart
[28:03] tied to the very essential things that
[28:05] we need, and that's salvation and his
[28:07] righteousness. So um his his salvation
[28:11] is offered to us uh because we are lost.
[28:14] And when you're lost, you're without
[28:16] hope. When someone's lost, there's no
[28:18] hope. Um, and and and it's not just that
[28:21] we're lost and don't know the Lord. We
[28:23] need salvation. We need to be saved. I I
[28:26] when I teach young people, I say, "Do
[28:28] you know what it means to be saved?"
[28:30] Well, if you need to be saved, that
[28:32] means you're lost. And if you don't know
[28:34] that you're lost, then you don't know
[28:36] you need to be saved.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; You see, this is real basic, but you
[28:41] realize if there's not a conviction, if
[28:43] I were to die right now, I'd be lost and
[28:45] go to hell because I'm lost. Without
[28:47] Christ, I'm lost. That's a conviction
[28:49] that every person has to realize. I'm
[28:52] lost. But he offers salvation.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; If you don't know you're lost, then
[28:56] you're not going to reach out for
[28:57] salvation. But if you know if I were to
[29:00] go right now and have an accident or
[29:01] whatever, I know that I'm lost. I'm not
[29:04] going to make it. That's why he offers
[29:05] us salvation. And when you know I'm
[29:07] lost, I need Christ. Then you can
[29:09] embrace salvation. And how does it come?
[29:11] By our confession and by believing with
[29:13] all of our heart. So many and I just
[29:16] want to say besides being lost as as we
[29:18] were uh born lost then there are many
[29:21] situations that that we come to in life
[29:24] that are without hope. In other words,
[29:27] they need to be saved. You're going to
[29:28] come to a lot of situations in your life
[29:31] that they're they're without hope.
[29:33] Without God, there's no hope for the
[29:35] situation.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; And but he can save situations that seem
[29:39] hopeless.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; So So his gift of salvation is to us.
[29:44] We're saved from our sin and the
[29:45] consequences of it. So, we're saved from
[29:47] that. So, these two things are really
[29:48] big. Really big. And yet, there is a
[29:51] provided way to get to righteousness and
[29:54] to get to salvation. A heart that
[29:57] believes 100%. No unbelief there. No
[30:00] doubt. Uh just a a heart that says, "I'm
[30:03] I'm completely on board. I believe it.
[30:06] I'm not just saying it with my lips, but
[30:08] my heart is there." Because, you know,
[30:09] there's a lot of scenarios here. People
[30:10] can say things with their lips. I
[30:12] believe. Brother Bram said in the prayer
[30:14] line, people would be saying, I believe.
[30:16] I believe. But he said only God knows if
[30:18] you're all on board in your heart. So,
[30:20] isn't it funny how we're made up as a
[30:22] human being? We can actually confess a
[30:25] lot. But, as I said last Wednesday,
[30:27] we've got to get our heart lined up with
[30:29] our confession that both of them are
[30:31] aligned. And if I say I believe, God's
[30:33] going to look at my heart. He really
[30:35] believes.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; I don't want those two things divided.
[30:38] And then I don't want to have a heart
[30:39] that's just here. I love God a lot. You
[30:42] know, everybody loves God, but you're
[30:44] you're too embarrassed or too ashamed to
[30:46] confess it with your mouth. You see, so
[30:50] these two things are important and they
[30:52] lead to the two most important things,
[30:54] salvation and his righteousness. Oh,
[30:56] what a blessed thing that we take on his
[30:58] righteousness. What a blessed gift. And
[31:00] so, these are the provided way to get
[31:01] there. A heart that believes with no
[31:04] doubting. And and then confession, which
[31:06] is what we're going to speak of tonight.
[31:08] Confession. God leads you. and even
[31:10] these things uh I can't attach this just
[31:13] to us because the Bible says it's God
[31:16] that leads us to repentance.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; So I mean if we start making it
[31:23] mechanical and just like a formula uh
[31:26] that's not it either. It's it's that
[31:28] it's pray God I'm lost. I need to be
[31:31] saved. It's pray and say God I need you
[31:33] to lead me to a heart that can repent.
[31:36] Everything is up to him leading us. And
[31:38] then when he leads us that we we got to
[31:40] yield. So even in the beginnings of our
[31:42] journey with the Lord, they can never be
[31:45] right unless these things are dealt with
[31:47] about confessing and about believing
[31:49] with all our heart. We've seen it there
[31:51] in the opening scripture in Romans
[31:52] chapter 10. It's a wonderful scripture.
[31:54] If you confess with your with your mouth
[31:56] and you believe with all your heart,
[31:58] then these things begin to come to you.
[32:00] So in the beginning of our journey with
[32:02] the Lord, these things are essential. Uh
[32:05] they're they're things that we have to
[32:07] have. Uh our natural bent that we're
[32:09] born with is actually to disbelieve and
[32:13] to turn away God's provided way to move
[32:15] away from it. You're born with a natural
[32:18] bent to turn away from the provided way
[32:20] that God's provided. So you got you got
[32:23] an uphill battle here, young people. You
[32:25] got an uphill battle because you're born
[32:28] with a canelike uh worship and a
[32:30] canelike nature that says, "Ah, yeah, I
[32:33] might want to come to God, but I want to
[32:35] come to God my own way." uh you're born
[32:38] with that. You you have a bent towards
[32:40] being rebellious. You have a bent.
[32:41] That's why it starts to really come out
[32:43] in life is because if you don't have a
[32:45] born again experience, you're going to
[32:46] start rebelling against everything,
[32:49] including parents that are trying to
[32:50] lead you because without a new birth,
[32:52] you don't even have anything to work off
[32:54] of.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; You're born with that. You're going to
[32:58] start resisting God's word. It's in your
[33:00] nature. your bent that you're born with
[33:02] is to disbelieve, to not trust God's
[33:05] word, and to turn away from God's way.
[33:07] Another natural bent is to be too
[33:10] embarrassed to confess you're wrong and
[33:13] that you're a sinner.
[33:16] That's another natural bent. It's it's
[33:18] it's too embarrassing. But I'll tell
[33:19] you, when somebody really gets a hold of
[33:22] God, the embarrassment goes away and
[33:24] they're not ashamed of the gospel of
[33:26] Jesus Christ.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Go back to Romans 10
[33:29] there. I want to read that because he
[33:31] brings that up. Bring get your Bibles.
[33:33] Romans 10 again. I think I added the
[33:35] scripture, but that in that ashamed is
[33:38] is in there. It says uh yeah, verse 11.
[33:42] For the scripture saith, whosoever
[33:44] believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
[33:48] So now when we're talking about
[33:50] confession tonight, the reason people
[33:52] won't confess their sins, the reason
[33:55] people won't confess and be honest with
[33:57] God or honest with one another, cuz
[33:59] remember James says, "Confess your
[34:00] faults one to another." Not just to God,
[34:03] sometimes it's to a brother or sister.
[34:05] But you see now, the reason people won't
[34:07] believe with all their heart and the
[34:10] reason people won't go the next step to
[34:12] confess, I believe this, and I why why
[34:15] won't they? They're a little bit
[34:17] ashamed. But when he's moving on the
[34:19] heart, they lose all of their
[34:20] embarrassment.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; They're not afraid. And when they get
[34:24] stimulated by the revelation of God's
[34:26] touching their heart, they don't care
[34:28] who's around them anymore. I'm not
[34:30] ashamed. If they're at work, they're not
[34:32] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[34:34] Can you say amen? And only the Holy
[34:36] Ghost can do that. But when he does it,
[34:38] they cross over into what he's saying
[34:40] here. that it that that that whosoever
[34:43] believeth on him really believes 110% in
[34:46] other words truly believe from their
[34:48] heart shall not be ashamed and when
[34:50] they're not ashamed they're not ashamed
[34:52] to confess it. Now we go into our
[34:55] subject of confession because when we're
[34:56] not ashamed to be honest and to be open
[34:59] before God and before one another. When
[35:02] we have that, then they're wi then we're
[35:03] willing to confess and own up to when
[35:07] we're wrong verbally.
[35:10] Not wishy-washy sorryries. Not a sorry
[35:15] of a 2-year-old who doesn't mean it.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Say sorry. Sorry.
[35:23] No, it's got to be something that I'm
[35:25] really broken about this. I'm really
[35:27] sorry. I I I'm God. I'm really sorry for
[35:29] what I've done and I'm not ashamed to
[35:31] even tell people I've done some some
[35:33] things that's not right. Uh even if it
[35:36] was this week, I've done some things
[35:37] that's not right. I want to make it
[35:39] right. Not too many people, some
[35:41] families sometimes that doesn't work in
[35:43] their family dynamic at all to own up to
[35:45] when they said something wrong. But we
[35:47] as Christians got to grow into that
[35:49] because I'm going to show you in a
[35:50] minute why it's it's wrong to not
[35:53] confess when we're wrong. Okay? It's
[35:56] wrong. and you're going to see the
[35:57] fruits of it. So in the next verse, they
[36:00] shall not be ashamed. Something happens.
[36:02] God leads a person to be unashamed, to
[36:05] step out, to believe it, to become sold
[36:08] out, lock, stock, and barrel. And the
[36:10] evidence will be that you're not ashamed
[36:12] to say it in front of the whole world if
[36:14] it's needed. You're not ashamed to
[36:16] confess it in front of the whole world
[36:18] if it's needed. In other words, I am not
[36:20] denying Christ. I am standing with
[36:22] Christ. I talk to people that are
[36:24] baptized about this. You're going to be
[36:25] baptized publicly to show the whole
[36:27] world that I'm not ashamed to stand for
[36:29] Jesus Christ. But it's not just a
[36:31] physical baptism. It's your life that
[36:34] says I am not ashamed of naming the name
[36:36] of Christ and he is the word. So I'm not
[36:39] ashamed of the word of God. Praise the
[36:41] Lord. So I want to point out though even
[36:44] though this is the beginning of a
[36:45] Christian's life and the soul gets saved
[36:48] from sin by confessing and by believing
[36:51] a lot of times certain denominations and
[36:53] certain Christianity will stop right
[36:55] there. You had to believe. If you
[36:57] confess with your mouth you're saved.
[37:00] That's it. You're saved. And then all of
[37:01] a sudden the confession stops. No. All
[37:05] of a sudden now I'm in. I'm going to
[37:06] heaven. That's it. No. This is a
[37:09] continual life of keeping all unbelief
[37:13] out of your mind and spirit and keeping
[37:15] our life a life of confession.
[37:19] It's not just when you first get saved.
[37:21] Once saved, always saved. That would be
[37:24] good. Uh some Baptist doctrines that I
[37:27] confess with my mouth. Once saved, I'm
[37:30] saved. That's it. But you see now this
[37:31] is a continual thing because there was
[37:33] one guy in the Bible to Jesus. He said,
[37:35] 'Lord, I believe, but help thou my
[37:39] unbelief.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; So now, this is a continual walk with
[37:44] the Lord that if is any shadows of
[37:47] unbelief that take our spirit and cause
[37:49] us to lock up or if there's anything
[37:51] that holds us back from confessing our
[37:53] sin, confessing our mistakes, confessing
[37:56] to one another, and I start to go into
[37:58] hiding a little bit, and then I put on a
[38:00] show to everybody else, but I'm not
[38:01] confessing. This is where we get into
[38:03] trouble because we realize that this
[38:05] must be a continual life of being open,
[38:09] being transparent, being open before
[38:11] God, open before one another. Our lives
[38:13] should be an open book. And you know
[38:15] why? Because Christ opened the book. How
[38:17] many knows the book of redemption? He
[38:19] said it's Christ. Christ is the book and
[38:22] the bride is the words in the book. And
[38:23] you know what he did in Revelation 5? He
[38:25] took the seals off the book. And that
[38:28] means all of Christ was transparent to
[38:30] us. we could see him in all of his
[38:32] glory. Now, if Christ did that for you
[38:35] in this hour, our lives should become an
[38:38] open book to him.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[38:42] &gt;&gt; If he did that in this age, he took the
[38:45] seals off of himself. We see Christ in
[38:48] all of his glory. No church age has ever
[38:51] seen Christ this way before. You're a
[38:54] blessed people tonight, sir.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; But if he was willing to do that for
[38:57] you, then why are you hiding things from
[38:59] him? Right?
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Why are you withholding things from him?
[39:04] He and you know you think of Calvary
[39:06] when he was there on the cross. Even
[39:07] there he was naked. They they covered
[39:10] him up but he was naked. He had nothing
[39:12] of this world. His hands were stretched
[39:14] out and there he was completely open to
[39:17] the entire world. Here I am open. And
[39:19] then spiritually speaking his word, his
[39:23] mysteries, everything that he was now at
[39:25] the end time he's another open book
[39:27] before us. I think that we should become
[39:31] an open book to him.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I think we should live a life of an open
[39:36] book to others. And the only reason we
[39:37] don't is sometimes we're too embarrassed
[39:40] and sometimes we're trying to hide
[39:42] something. But you can never be fully
[39:44] free if you're hiding something.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; You can't be fully free.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:53] So, this is more than just when you're
[39:56] first saved. It's a continued life of
[39:58] keeping all the unbelief out of your
[40:00] mind and spirit. How many want to live a
[40:02] life of keeping all unbelief out?
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Spirits of unbelief. You're reading too
[40:08] much of the internet. You know what it
[40:10] is? It's not a matter of them solving
[40:13] problems. It's spirits of unbelief to
[40:15] cause you to doubt.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You really want to play around with
[40:18] those spirits?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; No. Just get your Bible and get the
[40:22] message
[40:23] &gt;&gt; and ask the Lord to show you. get your
[40:26] answers from that, but don't dabble in
[40:28] the spirits of unbelief.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, keeping a li and then
[40:32] keeping a life of confession. So, I just
[40:34] want to jump ahead in the sermon down a
[40:36] little bit. And brother Brandon explains
[40:37] it just real simply later on. And he's
[40:40] showing the provided way, not it's not
[40:43] in joining a group. It's not in joining
[40:45] a church. I'm and tonight I'm building
[40:47] the case a little bit more of how
[40:49] crucial it is to be open to have a
[40:52] confession of our faults and confessing
[40:56] his word as well. And brother Bram says
[40:58] along in in in the message he cares you
[41:00] care. Now see man will say well I join
[41:03] church that settles it with me. That
[41:06] isn't God's provided way. Joining church
[41:09] is not God's provided way.
[41:13] Being in the message group is not God's
[41:16] provided way. I It's my home church, so
[41:19] I can say this more and more. I realize
[41:21] there's a lot of people that are in the
[41:23] movement, but they don't understand what
[41:25] this message is.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; They do not understand what it is.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And if they exit, they didn't understand
[41:31] what it is. Because there's nobody
[41:33] there's nobody that could exit this and
[41:36] understand what it is. Amen.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; How in the world does God send us a
[41:41] message to take us out of systems of
[41:43] denomination and partial presentations
[41:45] of Christ and then what spirit the
[41:48] spirit takes you out of that commodifer
[41:50] my people? What spirit took you back to
[41:51] it?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't work that way. It
[41:54] doesn't make any sense. And so he
[41:56] brought us something that a lot of
[41:58] people the reason even they don't live
[41:59] it is because they don't understand what
[42:01] it is. And God needs to reveal to the
[42:04] person what this really is. it it to me
[42:06] today after however many years it's been
[42:09] 16 years old I was filled with the Holy
[42:10] Ghost. I was telling the brothers in the
[42:12] office a little while ago I you know I
[42:14] got filled with the Holy Ghost. God
[42:16] changed my life. He changed my desires.
[42:17] And one of my greatest desires is to
[42:19] find out what this Bible says. I Dad
[42:22] didn't have to tell me anymore to read
[42:23] my Bible. I had a hunger to read my
[42:25] Bible. And then I said if God sent a
[42:27] messenger prophet to my generation I'm
[42:30] going to hear what he had to say. Amen.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; And I took the next four or five years
[42:34] and stacked cassette tapes and brought
[42:36] them home from the library. And I'm not
[42:37] boasting. I'm just saying I had to bathe
[42:39] myself in the word because I said, "If
[42:41] God, if this is of God, I'm going to
[42:43] find out what it said. God spoke to this
[42:46] generation."
[42:48] &gt;&gt; And I think a lot of people are not
[42:49] doing that. And that's why they're
[42:51] susceptible to unbelieving spirits
[42:53] sometimes that's that's uh that's out
[42:56] there because they haven't just and I I
[42:59] got a hunger for the word and I I just
[43:01] wanted to I wanted to be devour I just
[43:03] want to devour it. I wanted to find out
[43:06] that's what came with my experience. But
[43:08] you know I can say today that it means
[43:12] so much more to me than it ever has. And
[43:14] I was going to say this. This is what I
[43:15] was you know I forgot what I was going
[43:17] to say and now I remembered and I better
[43:18] say it before I forget it again.
[43:20] I know none of that ever happens to you,
[43:23] but more and more this message that he
[43:26] breathed on this generation is less and
[43:28] less to me about William Brandham.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And I say that to with the most respect.
[43:34] But when I look at this, if you look at
[43:36] this as seventh grade education and you
[43:39] know where where did he have his stories
[43:41] wrong, you're looking at human flesh
[43:44] &gt;&gt; more and more. This doesn't have to do
[43:46] with the man. Your truth is what I
[43:49] follow. It'll still be true tomorrow.
[43:52] What I believe is not the works of any
[43:54] man.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he says this, I
[43:59] didn't finish the quote. He says, "Well,
[44:01] I joined church. That settles it with
[44:03] me. That isn't God's provided way. God's
[44:07] provided way is repentance, confession,
[44:11] and I like this, showing results.
[44:14] bringing forth fruit, meat for
[44:16] repentance, showing sincerity. So that's
[44:18] God's provided way. You got to repent.
[44:21] You got to confess. Can you say amen?
[44:23] And you got to bring forth fruits, meat
[44:25] for repentance. John the Baptist said
[44:27] that to the Pharisees, "Well, we want to
[44:28] come. We want to be baptized. We want to
[44:30] join the message." And he says, but but
[44:32] he didn't see the sincerity to it. He
[44:34] didn't say they were repenting. They
[44:35] didn't come up and repent. They didn't
[44:37] come and said, "We're wrong and we're
[44:38] leaving our denominational system." They
[44:40] just wanted to join the movement. And he
[44:42] says, "Bring forth fruits worthy of
[44:45] repentance." If you really repent,
[44:47] there'll be fruits of this message
[44:48] coming on your life. I'm going to say it
[44:50] again. If there's true repentance,
[44:52] there'll be fruits coming in that
[44:53] person's life of this message of this
[44:55] hour.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And you'll see the fruits in their life.
[44:57] That's repentance. It's not saying, "I'm
[44:59] sorry," and then all the fruits are
[45:01] worldly fruits. No, you'll see the
[45:02] fruits of the message.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe not overnight, but they're going
[45:06] to start coming out because you've had a
[45:08] real experience.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:11] So it's bringing forth. So that that's
[45:13] why he mentions the word sincerity. So
[45:14] now not just at the beginning of your
[45:16] spirits but a continual thing. And then
[45:19] James puts this confession as a huge
[45:21] part of our life. Not only for healing
[45:23] but he he ties it to our prayer of faith
[45:26] saving the sick all healing. He ties it
[45:29] to our prayer of faith when he says
[45:31] confess your faults one to another. Not
[45:34] just to God. We dealt with that last
[45:35] Wednesday night. It's not just to God.
[45:37] as last Wednesday he talked about a
[45:39] husband who was flirting with another
[45:41] woman and put his arms around another
[45:43] woman. Then he comes and just casually
[45:45] says, "Honey, you don't mind that, do
[45:46] you?" And you know, we're buds and
[45:48] everything. And it was an insincere
[45:50] confession. And and and so when you have
[45:53] a confession that's insincere or you
[45:55] don't have any true repentance, then we
[45:59] realize that it hinders faith to be able
[46:02] to bring healing to our lives and
[46:04] healing to the body. A lack of
[46:06] confession
[46:08] restricts the Holy Spirit from doing
[46:11] more healing.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; And we're going to see that in a minute.
[46:16] So, why is it so important that we live
[46:19] a life of open confession, even
[46:21] confessing our faults? James says, and I
[46:23] said last Wednesday night, James, did
[46:25] you have to bring that up? Talk about
[46:26] healing. Talk about laying hands on the
[46:28] sick and they're recovering. Talk about
[46:30] all these other things, but where do you
[46:32] get this confess your faults one to
[46:33] another? I ain't doing that.
[46:37] Well, you're missing a key element in
[46:39] more healing.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Because why? Why? Let's talk about why.
[46:44] Why did James make it important? Why
[46:47] does the Lord make it important that we
[46:48] live this life? Why there's so why is
[46:51] there so much in the Bible about what
[46:53] comes out of our mouths as we preached
[46:56] on Sunday?
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Why is it so important in the
[47:00] scriptures? Why is it so important
[47:02] what's coming out of these mouths?
[47:05] And a confession is needed. Why? A lot
[47:09] of secrets can be held up within us. And
[47:13] the problem is the secrets can bind us
[47:17] up.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Secrets can bind God up.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Secrets can bind our family up.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Secrets can bind a church up.
[47:36] And I'm I'm teaching sons of God here
[47:38] tonight. Listen, this applies to all of
[47:40] us.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Secrets that need that lay there hidden.
[47:46] The devil uses it to bind up families,
[47:49] bind up churches
[47:51] &gt;&gt; because something's laying there and
[47:53] only go God knows about it and only you,
[47:55] but it's laying there. It's laying
[47:57] there. unconfessed sin or maybe
[47:58] something that's it just if it's laying
[48:00] there then there's shadows and there's
[48:02] there's a limitation put on the whole
[48:05] moving of the Holy Spirit. God could
[48:08] burst somebody into the kingdom. But if
[48:09] a whole congregation came together and
[48:11] they had resentment in their heart, God
[48:13] can't move and that person that's
[48:15] sitting in the seat may not be able to
[48:16] get their salvation because you've
[48:18] limited the freedom of the Holy Spirit.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; All of us are involved in this. All of
[48:25] us. This confession is important.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; We have an accountability to one
[48:29] another. Can you say amen? We have an
[48:31] accountability to create the right
[48:33] atmosphere. And part of that is that
[48:35] there's not secrets uh uh and and
[48:38] secrets that are not exposed can be
[48:42] listen now. Secrets that are not exposed
[48:45] can be manipulated by Satan and turned
[48:49] into lies.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; How many know Satan is the father of
[48:53] lies? He dwells in the realm of lies,
[48:57] not truth. Truth sets you free. So he
[48:59] dwells in the realm of lies. So secrets
[49:02] that are not exposed quickly and brought
[49:04] out become manipulated because that's
[49:06] where he dwells. He gets right down in
[49:08] there in the realm of the secrets. And
[49:10] he gets in there and manipulates them
[49:12] into lies because he's the father of
[49:14] lies. And lies create bondage. How do we
[49:18] know that lies create bondage? We know
[49:20] that because Jesus said, "Ye shall know
[49:22] the truth and the truth will set you
[49:23] free." The opposite is that is a is a
[49:26] lie. So lies must bring bondage. Truth
[49:30] brings freedom.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And so uh lies bring bondage.
[49:37] Lies put someone in a prison on the
[49:39] inside.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; True.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; You never find Satan wanting to reveal
[49:44] the secrets of your heart.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; There's no scripture for that.
[49:50] In fact, there's only two scriptures
[49:51] that speak about the secrets of the
[49:53] heart being made known. And that is um
[49:56] one I'm going to bring it up if you guys
[49:58] bring it up. Psalms 44:20.
[50:02] Even us, if we have forgotten the name
[50:05] of our God or stretched out our hands to
[50:08] a strange God, even if we did that,
[50:11] shall not
[50:13] next one. Shall not God
[50:16] search this out? for he knoweth the
[50:19] secrets of the heart.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; So even if we're failing and we're
[50:23] drifting away for an elect, God's going
[50:26] to say, "I'm going to reveal the secrets
[50:28] of the heart. I'm going to search you
[50:30] out. I'm going to find you and I'm going
[50:32] to find what's wrong in the heart. I'm
[50:34] going to expose it. I'm going to reveal
[50:36] it." Why? Because he's a God of truth
[50:38] and he dwells in truth, not lies. And so
[50:42] the the the scripture has many places
[50:44] that speak about but Satan Satan will
[50:46] never reveal the secrets of your heart.
[50:48] He helps you hide them.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And the deeper the secret goes inside of
[50:54] you, the deeper he can hide it and cover
[50:57] it up, the better for him. But it's our
[51:00] loving God who likes to reveal the
[51:03] secrets of the heart.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why does he do that? It's
[51:06] embarrassing." Because God knows if it's
[51:09] a little bit embarrassing temporarily,
[51:12] there's more freedom down the road.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; I was just reading something today about
[51:18] a a University of Michigan study, and
[51:20] they found with the younger ages, and I
[51:23] can't remember the ages, but younger
[51:25] kids will emotionally get used to
[51:29] confessing to their parents and
[51:31] confessing things even though they're
[51:33] born with a spirit to lie. You're born
[51:35] in sin, shaped in iniquity. come into
[51:37] the world speaking lies. You don't have
[51:40] to teach a kid to lie. They'll do it.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; But sometimes after they've been around
[51:44] their parents, they learn emotionally
[51:46] that there's better benefits to con
[51:48] confessing it because then their
[51:51] probably their parents changed their
[51:53] demeanor to them and they get open to
[51:55] them, maybe give them some more
[51:57] privileges. So they learn it's better to
[51:59] confess. But then the other study showed
[52:02] as they got older, 10, 11, 12 years old,
[52:04] as they get older, then they emotionally
[52:06] tie to hiding things instead of
[52:08] confessing it because it becomes better
[52:10] for them. Uh they can do the things that
[52:13] they want. If they live a life of not
[52:14] confessing it, probably the discipline
[52:17] is going to be there. So they become
[52:18] fearful of the discipline, right? And so
[52:21] now they choose emotionally to to start
[52:25] to start keeping the lies going because
[52:28] they can live kind of the way that they
[52:30] want to live and the lies keep building
[52:32] up
[52:35] and then um you know I don't know where
[52:37] it was but yeah here here they what what
[52:40] it is is that they get to what they want
[52:42] and they forget listen they forget the
[52:44] greater freedom and the release in their
[52:46] spirit that comes from confessing. They
[52:49] learned that as a child, but they forget
[52:52] that that the greater
[52:55] uh the greater feeling is when you
[52:57] confess things and they forget that and
[53:00] then we become adults and we become
[53:02] professionals at lying,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; We become very good at it. We play
[53:10] grown-up games with one another
[53:14] and and adults become more childish in
[53:17] that way and because they too become
[53:20] professionals at hiding and throwing
[53:23] people off and deflecting the pain and
[53:25] the fear of an embarrassment because
[53:27] when sins build up then it becomes more
[53:30] embarrassing to confess it. They don't
[53:31] confess it to God. They don't confess it
[53:33] to one another and the fear of
[53:34] embarrassment and they learn very well
[53:36] how to hide it. They become
[53:38] professionals at lying. They become
[53:40] professionals at deflecting the pain.
[53:42] They become professionals at hiding it.
[53:45] Professionals at hiding it. And they
[53:47] forgot that on the other side of life
[53:52] uh of confession is true freedom. They
[53:55] forgot it
[53:57] because it's too much pain. It's too
[54:00] embarrassing to bring it up. Now, I
[54:02] didn't have this down, but you remember
[54:04] the incident where
[54:06] uh the school the Sunday school teacher,
[54:09] Brother Brian was dealing with her,
[54:10] exposed that she had adultery in her
[54:12] life that she hid some way back 10, 20
[54:14] years ago. She was continuing to be a
[54:16] Sunday school teacher and she was so the
[54:19] Holy Spirit brought it up and exposed it
[54:21] just as a gentleman, but said, "You've
[54:23] got this back here." And she said, "Who
[54:26] told you that?" Oh, I I I confessed that
[54:30] to God years ago. And brother B said,
[54:32] "Well, you didn't confess it to your
[54:33] husband. Nobody else knows about it. You
[54:35] didn't confess to your husband. You
[54:36] sinned against your husband, too." And
[54:38] so, she gets real defensive. And she had
[54:40] hid hid that thing this long going on,
[54:43] being a Sunday school, maybe even doing
[54:44] those things to cover it up because
[54:46] sometimes people religiously
[54:49] &gt;&gt; work hard to cover their condemnation.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say amen to these. You
[54:55] can just think about it cuz this is
[54:57] getting deep for all of us. But there's
[55:00] a lot of things done in the name of
[55:02] serving Christ that are covering up
[55:04] people's guilt.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And that's not a good reason to do it.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be free and he wants
[55:12] you to serve his kingdom,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; but not out of guilt.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Not doing penance.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; That's the Catholic church. You want to
[55:20] do penance, join the Catholic church.
[55:22] No, don't join the Catholic church. But
[55:24] we're not we're not paying back for our
[55:26] sins. We're not working to give a big
[55:28] offering to the United Way so you can
[55:30] relieve your guilt. All you need to do
[55:32] is bring it and confess it to the Lord.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; He's faithful and just to forgive. If we
[55:36] confess our sins, he's faithful and just
[55:38] to forgive us of our sin. Once again,
[55:40] what confession?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; He promises if we confess it, he'll
[55:44] forgive us of our sins.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; He's promised that.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:49] So adults become professional at hiding
[55:52] it, but they forget they forget the the
[55:56] freedom that would be on the other side.
[55:58] And they and be they can be set free by
[56:01] God. One writer says, "If we've done
[56:03] something wrong and hide it in our
[56:05] hearts, unconfessed and unforgiven, it
[56:07] will always work against us and become a
[56:10] stumbling block on the pathway of our
[56:11] life." As long as pride, oh, he mentions
[56:14] the word pride. As long as pride tells
[56:17] us to keep it hidden, the enemy can use
[56:20] the ungodly choices we have made to
[56:22] undermine our lives. True.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; The principle of confessing sin as a
[56:27] step towards healing and wholeness is
[56:30] not just New Testament healing practice
[56:31] seen in James 5:16. That's the one we
[56:34] just read. It's not just for that
[56:35] healing, but it is a theme which is
[56:38] interwoven through the scripture. When
[56:40] we deal with our sin, then we can
[56:43] receive mercy and forgiveness.
[56:45] But if you don't deal with it, if you
[56:47] leave it alone, if you hide it, and if
[56:50] you if you're working hard for the
[56:52] kingdom to try to cover it up, that's
[56:55] not the provided way God has for you.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Don't try to work it off. Don't try to
[57:01] do that. That's that's not what God
[57:03] wants. He knows your heart. Uh serve the
[57:05] kingdom of God, but don't do that. So
[57:07] now, here's a couple things is that a
[57:09] couple words out there. Pride is what
[57:11] makes us do it. too embarrassed to talk
[57:13] about it or we don't want to deal with
[57:16] it. That's two things I think there were
[57:17] good things Peter Horban wrote brought
[57:19] up there. So now look at look at David
[57:22] for a minute and the Lord dealt with me
[57:25] late last night about this and I think
[57:27] I'll bring this at the men's meeting. I
[57:28] have to speak a couple services there.
[57:31] David over time, God's king, a king
[57:37] after God's own heart, rose to his
[57:40] place, had a position in the kingdom,
[57:42] fought, brought on the enemies, subdued,
[57:45] everything was going good. And remember
[57:46] now, this isn't in the world. This is in
[57:48] Jehovah, God's own army, and this is
[57:50] God's king positioned. But over time,
[57:55] David built this private world that
[57:58] nobody knew about. You say, "Well, I
[58:00] thought he had sinned with Bashibba."
[58:02] Yeah, but that was only the end of it
[58:03] all. You don't you don't have an
[58:06] adultery like that unless something's
[58:08] been privately building up
[58:10] &gt;&gt; over time. Something's happened. Your
[58:13] spirit um for a man, I just told a man,
[58:16] a young man this the other day. I just
[58:18] said, "We draw our uh encouragement
[58:22] sometimes and our worth from praise of
[58:24] what we're doing. We're working hard.
[58:26] We're providing for the family. If they
[58:28] don't get enough praise for that, then
[58:29] if if their job fails and or they're not
[58:32] getting a promotion, it really affects
[58:34] us as men because we want to be
[58:35] successful in our work and successful in
[58:37] life. And when we have a couple damages
[58:39] happen, our spirits get really low.
[58:41] You're very vulnerable in those times
[58:43] when your spirits gets low. Also, David,
[58:48] the Bible says that he normally would go
[58:50] out and fight with the other ones. Well,
[58:52] he stayed home.
[58:54] So there's little things happening to
[58:56] David, little changes that only he knows
[58:58] that he's making. The rest of the
[59:00] kingdom is going on. They're still
[59:02] having church every Sunday.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Everything's functioning the same. And
[59:07] yet privately, this little world of
[59:10] David has changed. Before Basheba come
[59:12] in the picture, there was something that
[59:14] began to be built up in him that become
[59:16] a hidden world. And uh he could have
[59:19] talked to somebody about all that. David
[59:21] could have talked to somebody where
[59:22] first of all he should have called
[59:23] Nathan the prophet in
[59:25] &gt;&gt; he should have fed on the message
[59:29] &gt;&gt; but obviously he had he had reasoned
[59:33] that I don't need the prophet for this
[59:35] one
[59:37] &gt;&gt; hiding
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I don't need to listen to the prophet
[59:40] you know there's something going on here
[59:42] but but he really needed it he needed
[59:44] help he needed accountability
[59:48] &gt;&gt; and that particular area of his life
[59:50] he's just leaving hidden,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; unaccountable. So now uh then his
[59:56] position brought him a pride. I'm not
[59:58] going to go out to fight now. I'm going
[59:59] to stay home and let my guys do it. That
[1:00:01] pride made him start hiding things. And
[1:00:05] when the prophet was told what was
[1:00:07] happening, I can just tell you the
[1:00:09] prophet came to him and never give him a
[1:00:12] free pass.
[1:00:14] And a prophet will never give you a free
[1:00:17] pass when there's sin to be exposed.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And all of us adult sons and daughters
[1:00:24] of God, young people may not understand
[1:00:25] this yet, but all adult sons of God have
[1:00:28] learned this. And they raise their hand
[1:00:30] and praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord,
[1:00:32] for your rebuke and your correction.
[1:00:34] Thank you for the prophet in my life.
[1:00:36] Thank you for the Nathans that come in
[1:00:38] my life because I know the joy that's on
[1:00:40] the other side of being exposed. You're
[1:00:43] a childish. I don't want anybody tell me
[1:00:45] what to do. Stay out of my life. That's
[1:00:47] none of your business. You sound like a
[1:00:48] teenager.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; You sound like a teenager spiritually. I
[1:00:52] don't have to live up to all that
[1:00:53] message. That was Brother Brandham's
[1:00:55] opinion. And you're acting like a
[1:00:56] teenager. But sons that are growing are
[1:00:58] saying, "I'm embracing the correction of
[1:01:01] God's word. I want accountability." Can
[1:01:05] I get an amen tonight? I embrace if it's
[1:01:08] the right kind of correction coming from
[1:01:09] the Lord even through a brother and
[1:01:11] sister. We're to if a brother be
[1:01:13] overtaken in a fault, ye which are
[1:01:14] spiritual, go and restore such a one in
[1:01:16] the spirit of weakness. Why isn't there
[1:01:18] a lot of sermons on that? That's
[1:01:20] something supposed to be working in the
[1:01:21] body that you trust somebody to tell you
[1:01:24] the truth.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You're not bucking up against it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And so David was not given a free pass.
[1:01:33] He gave room for him to confess. And he
[1:01:36] gave a scenario of the sheep there. And
[1:01:38] you you know the scenario and and I have
[1:01:39] to go back. I even last night I just
[1:01:42] went in and read that one part on my
[1:01:44] phone. I read it that said finally
[1:01:48] Nathan said, "You're the man. You are
[1:01:50] the man I'm talking about in the
[1:01:52] parable." But I want you to notice
[1:01:53] something. When he was first presented
[1:01:55] with it, he should have confessed. But
[1:01:57] God gave him grace again to confess that
[1:01:59] he did it. Because the first reaction
[1:02:02] was to continue to hide it
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; and to blame to take that scenario and
[1:02:09] say, "Well, if that happened and that
[1:02:11] sheep was stolen that let's take the
[1:02:13] whole full measure of the law." We are
[1:02:16] always so good at judging everybody
[1:02:19] else.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to putting the lights
[1:02:23] back on us, we deflect it.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; What What should happen to that person?
[1:02:29] ah they should do they this should
[1:02:31] happen to them. They they went away from
[1:02:33] we we're quick to judge and quick to
[1:02:35] we're professionals at diagnosing
[1:02:37] everybody else's problem
[1:02:39] but we're not professionals at
[1:02:40] diagnosing oursel. That's why we need
[1:02:42] God sometimes when we're so stubborn to
[1:02:44] hide things to diagnose us what we're
[1:02:47] said David you're the man and you better
[1:02:51] you better look at things now.
[1:02:54] uh he should have been accountable at
[1:02:55] the beginning. Somehow he hit it because
[1:02:58] I want to maintain my position in the
[1:03:00] church.
[1:03:02] I want to keep things going, but I want
[1:03:04] to keep this going on the side.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And God just wouldn't let that go.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; and it was God's love that come through
[1:03:13] the prophet and come right down there
[1:03:15] and said, "You are the man."
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; What was he saying to a son of God? This
[1:03:20] another work of the message. It's
[1:03:23] another work of the message. There's a
[1:03:25] spirit of discernment that's still in
[1:03:27] this message and still in this word.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; It's not just God sent a prophet and no,
[1:03:32] no, no. There's a spirit of discernment
[1:03:34] in this message in this word. And if you
[1:03:36] expose yourself to that kind of light,
[1:03:39] you're going to find some victories that
[1:03:40] you wouldn't have had if you didn't have
[1:03:42] that light.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; When you see it as the wrong thing, it's
[1:03:46] bad. But when you see it as light and
[1:03:49] it's going to be for your good and it's
[1:03:50] got some victories down the road, you
[1:03:52] say, "Lord, shine your light on me. I'm
[1:03:54] an open book before you." That's what
[1:03:56] David should have been saying, but uh he
[1:03:58] he wasn't. And even when he was
[1:04:00] presented with the scenario that fit him
[1:04:02] and not everybody else, he put it on to
[1:04:05] somebody else.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; He really gotten into a mode of hiding
[1:04:10] and to deflect to other people, to
[1:04:13] deflect. And and Nathan said, "Now, it's
[1:04:16] it's time for you to look. I've got the
[1:04:19] kingdom in mind here, and I need your
[1:04:20] ministry to continue, but it can't
[1:04:23] continue unless you expose this thing
[1:04:24] and repent of it."
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And God didn't, you know, embarrass him
[1:04:29] in front of the whole thing. And Nathan
[1:04:30] didn't come in and say, "Hey, you know
[1:04:32] what? We need to really manage this
[1:04:34] whole situation now. Uh, you keep this
[1:04:36] quiet. I'll keep it quiet because we
[1:04:38] need to keep the kingdom going." No, no,
[1:04:39] no, no, no. God said, "No. The kingdom
[1:04:42] won't even continue. The kingdom will be
[1:04:44] taken out of your hands unless you deal
[1:04:46] with this right now.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; There's lots of pain that came from that
[1:04:56] time in David's life and it's all
[1:04:58] because of his secret world was not
[1:05:00] exposed. His secret sexual world.
[1:05:05] Some things in my experience with
[1:05:07] dealing with people through the years is
[1:05:10] I have found that if they're under a
[1:05:12] real legalistic, harsh,
[1:05:14] excessive, strict home,
[1:05:17] they tend to have sexual secrets.
[1:05:20] And this is not recent. This is years
[1:05:23] ago watching things. The more legalistic
[1:05:25] that it is, the more they're secret
[1:05:28] sexual sins behind the scenes. It's
[1:05:31] true.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; And of course, I wouldn't give
[1:05:33] scenarios, but I've watched it. I've
[1:05:35] watched look at these homes and they
[1:05:38] look so perfect on the outside. They fit
[1:05:40] the message perfectly. And yet, there's
[1:05:43] hidden things that are not dealt with
[1:05:46] sexually behind the scenes. Abuse,
[1:05:48] sexual abuse. And if it's not, it's just
[1:05:50] private sexual things going on. I don't
[1:05:52] know all the reasons yet. I'm, you know,
[1:05:54] almost whatever age I am, but I don't
[1:05:57] know all the reasons why that kind of is
[1:05:59] together. But maybe the pain of sin is
[1:06:04] too extreme
[1:06:07] and the consequences are too extreme.
[1:06:11] So they hide it because the consequences
[1:06:14] of small things were dealt with in such
[1:06:18] a harsh way that they're scared to
[1:06:21] reveal something that's deeper.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And so they hide it. And you know what?
[1:06:27] I can see us humans doing that
[1:06:31] because
[1:06:32] we're human beings
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; and the pain of exposing it is going to
[1:06:37] be too much. Like that woman, she says,
[1:06:41] "Don't tell that to anybody." That
[1:06:42] Sunday school teacher, "Don't tell that
[1:06:44] to anybody."
[1:06:46] And he said, he said, "If you don't," he
[1:06:49] says, "nothing will be right." And he
[1:06:50] says, "Your husband's got the same thing
[1:06:52] to confess to you." And then she was so
[1:06:54] surprised cuz she didn't know that. This
[1:06:56] is we're talking about 15, 20 years of
[1:06:57] just hidden secrets. He was a deacon in
[1:07:00] the church and they're just going on and
[1:07:01] functioning. But listen, the Holy Spirit
[1:07:04] just wanted them to come to a greater
[1:07:06] victory and it came through confession.
[1:07:10] I don't know all the reasons why, but
[1:07:11] maybe the pain of sin is too extreme to
[1:07:13] avoid. So they hide it to deal with to
[1:07:15] or so they hide it. Hiding and feeling
[1:07:18] good
[1:07:20] is safer for them
[1:07:23] than exposing it.
[1:07:26] May God help us to
[1:07:29] see this tonight.
[1:07:32] Kind of like a kid who
[1:07:35] mom and dad ask him to go clean the room
[1:07:38] and you go up, they say, "Come on, mom
[1:07:40] and dad. You got to check this room out.
[1:07:43] Everything's perfect in the room." And
[1:07:44] you go, you say, "This is amazing. The
[1:07:46] bed's made and yours. I'm so proud of
[1:07:49] you. You're This looks so good." And you
[1:07:52] go over and open the closet and they
[1:07:54] have stuffed everything in the closet.
[1:07:57] The closet is an absolute mess because
[1:08:00] all they did was clean up what everybody
[1:08:02] would see out here.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And they stuffed it all hiding in the
[1:08:05] closet. You see, that's what we do
[1:08:07] sometimes.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Hide it in the closet. Look good to
[1:08:10] everybody.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Put a mask on to everybody.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; But it's time to take off all the mask.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Selfdeception
[1:08:20] is the worst kind. Can you say amen? It
[1:08:22] says it in the Bible. 1 John 1:5. And
[1:08:24] then I'm going to bring this down to a
[1:08:25] close. This then is the message which we
[1:08:27] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:08:28] that God is light and in him is no
[1:08:31] darkness at all. If we say that we have
[1:08:33] fellowship with him and walk in
[1:08:35] darkness, we lie and do not the truth.
[1:08:38] But if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:08:40] the light, we have fellowship one with
[1:08:42] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] his son cleanses us from all sin. You
[1:08:47] limit the power of the blood. Can you
[1:08:50] say amen? By not living in the light.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; You limit the power of good fellowship
[1:08:56] with him and with one another. By not
[1:08:58] living in the light, you can't find a
[1:09:00] real connection of true fellowship. It's
[1:09:02] all service. But when you live in the
[1:09:04] light, the benefit to the light is
[1:09:06] fellowship one with another and the
[1:09:07] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you.
[1:09:10] Let's go on with it. If we say that we
[1:09:12] have no sin, we deceive ourselves.
[1:09:13] There's selfdeception. Underline it in
[1:09:16] your bi Bible. And the worst type of
[1:09:18] type type of decept deception, excuse
[1:09:20] me. The worst type of deception is
[1:09:22] selfdeception.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; A person deceiving them their own
[1:09:27] selves.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; If we say that we have no sin, we
[1:09:30] deceive ourselves. And the truth is
[1:09:32] notice how all this is going on with
[1:09:34] yourself. God knows. You know, but it's
[1:09:36] not something everybody else knows.
[1:09:39] Truth is not in us. If we confess our
[1:09:41] sins, here's the promise you want to
[1:09:42] latch on to. If we do what? Say it.
[1:09:45] Confess. If we confess
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; our sins, he's faithful and just to
[1:09:50] forgive us of our sins
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and to cleanse us from all
[1:09:53] unrighteousness. If we say that we have
[1:09:55] not sinned, we make him a liar and his
[1:09:58] word is not on in us. I just want to
[1:10:01] read it in the amplified back to verse
[1:10:03] um back to verse 5
[1:10:06] real quickly. This is the message of God
[1:10:08] promised revelation which we have heard
[1:10:10] from him and now announce to you that
[1:10:12] God is light. He is holy. His message is
[1:10:15] truthful. He is a per He is perfect in
[1:10:17] righteousness and in him is no darkness
[1:10:19] at all. No sin, no wickedness, no
[1:10:22] imperfection. If we say that we have
[1:10:24] fellowship with him and yet walk in
[1:10:26] darkness of sin, we lie and do not
[1:10:28] practice the truth. But if we really
[1:10:30] walk in the light, that is live each day
[1:10:32] and every day in conformity with the
[1:10:34] precepts of God as he himself is in the
[1:10:36] light, we have true unbroken fellowship
[1:10:38] with one another. He is with us and we
[1:10:41] with him. And the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] his son cleanses us from all sin by
[1:10:45] erasing the stain of sin, keeping us
[1:10:47] cleansed from sin in all of its forms
[1:10:49] and manifestations.
[1:10:51] If we verse eight, if we say we have no
[1:10:54] sin, refusing to admit that we are
[1:10:56] sinners, we delude ourselves and the
[1:10:59] truth is not in us. His word does not
[1:11:02] live in our hearts. If we freely admit
[1:11:05] that we have sinned and confess our
[1:11:07] sins, he's faithful and just, true to
[1:11:09] his own nature and promises, and forgive
[1:11:12] our sins and cleanse us. Listen to this.
[1:11:14] He'll forgive our sins and and cleanse
[1:11:17] us continually from all unrighteousness,
[1:11:20] our wrongdoing, everything not
[1:11:21] conforming with his will. The last one
[1:11:24] is what I amaze me. Verse 10. If we say
[1:11:26] that we have not sinned, and this is
[1:11:28] somebody who's not willing to confess
[1:11:30] when they're wrong. If we say that we
[1:11:33] have not sinned, refusing to admit acts
[1:11:36] of sin, we make him out to be a liar
[1:11:40] by contradicting him and his word is not
[1:11:43] in us. That's pretty straight.
[1:11:46] That's pretty straight.
[1:11:48] So here's the here's the quote that I
[1:11:50] wanted to get to and then we're closing
[1:11:52] in and he cares. Do you care? The next
[1:11:56] section he says, "Now we notice that the
[1:11:58] people making their confession has got
[1:12:00] to come from the deepness of sincerity."
[1:12:03] I have here,
[1:12:06] I ain't got time to read it, but it's in
[1:12:08] Bingampton, New York, I believe. I've
[1:12:10] got that wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Bingampton.
[1:12:12] I believe it's right. The place where
[1:12:14] the Indic shoe company is there.
[1:12:16] Bingham, I believe it's called
[1:12:18] Bingington. That's right. New York. He
[1:12:20] was We was there in Indicate Johnson
[1:12:22] shoe place, a big auditorium. And we the
[1:12:25] this this uh shoe company made all the
[1:12:27] shoes for World War I, World War II.
[1:12:30] Huge company. It's not there anymore. It
[1:12:32] was bought out, but they had a lot of
[1:12:34] money flowing through there. 1940s,
[1:12:37] 1950s, and built a big auditorium. They
[1:12:40] built a theater. These rich guys built a
[1:12:43] lot of things. And I was reading today
[1:12:45] that they they wanted to build a whole
[1:12:48] community to help the people on their
[1:12:50] day off to have some entertainments. And
[1:12:52] so they built auditoriums, they built
[1:12:54] theaters, and there was a big fight that
[1:12:56] they had with the city leaders because
[1:12:58] that back then it was wrong in society
[1:13:01] to attend a movie theater on Sunday. It
[1:13:04] was wrong to do that. And so they
[1:13:07] changed the laws and they got the people
[1:13:09] doing things and that they could go to a
[1:13:10] theater after church on Sunday. They had
[1:13:12] to go to church. And so all this, one of
[1:13:15] these men were heard about the message
[1:13:17] and I think was affected. I'm still
[1:13:18] researching that. But they had brother
[1:13:20] Brandham in 1954
[1:13:23] and here's what happened in that
[1:13:25] meeting. We was having a meeting up
[1:13:27] there and one morning Billy Paul was
[1:13:28] next to me real cold winds blowing and I
[1:13:31] found among the people a lack of
[1:13:33] sincerity it seemed like and I wondered
[1:13:35] why. Here was one man. Listen now. Here
[1:13:38] was one man that was healed purpose or
[1:13:41] one man in particular I'm speaking of.
[1:13:43] The man had a great affliction and he
[1:13:45] was healed this night standing there and
[1:13:47] before we left 5 days the affliction was
[1:13:50] back on him again.
[1:13:52] You see because in the presence of the
[1:13:56] Holy Spirit, it took that off of him
[1:14:00] just like it did this young woman a
[1:14:01] while ago here in the yard. The young
[1:14:03] man last night. You see? But there must
[1:14:06] be a deep sincerity to know that the God
[1:14:10] that can take it away from you now with
[1:14:13] that same anointing on you can keep it
[1:14:16] away from you.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Now we just learned a huge lesson as
[1:14:19] sons. Now we don't want just a temporal
[1:14:23] blessing.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church and we don't
[1:14:26] serve the Lord this way to get a
[1:14:28] temporal deliverance and a temporal
[1:14:30] blessing. God has an anointing and God
[1:14:33] wants us to continue in our confession
[1:14:35] so that we keep that healing and we keep
[1:14:38] what God has given us. But he that man
[1:14:40] was delivered in that prayer line and
[1:14:42] now he's going to give the reason why it
[1:14:45] came back on him. And he says we must be
[1:14:47] sincere to know that God can take it
[1:14:49] away from you with the same anointing.
[1:14:51] He can keep it away from you. And then
[1:14:52] the Holy Spirit spoke to me one morning
[1:14:54] about daylight and said get up. Okay.
[1:14:58] Did I did I read the part about
[1:14:59] confession? confession.
[1:15:09] I I must have missed a part because he
[1:15:11] said the trouble with the meetings is
[1:15:13] that there was a lack of insincerity in
[1:15:15] the people and a lack of confession in
[1:15:16] the people. So I must have missed that.
[1:15:18] But he says he the Lord showed him this
[1:15:21] whole meeting it was it was going great
[1:15:23] but it wasn't the effect it could be
[1:15:25] because the lack of sincere confession
[1:15:27] among the people. So he says, "Then the
[1:15:30] Holy Spirit spoke to me one morning
[1:15:31] about daylight and said,"Get up on the
[1:15:33] platform or something and bring these
[1:15:34] people up there and make them confess
[1:15:36] everything that they've did before you
[1:15:39] pray for them." You see the depthness,
[1:15:43] the deepness of sincerity, unless the
[1:15:46] world repents, it's got to perish. And
[1:15:47] confession is what the world needs today
[1:15:51] is honest confession.
[1:15:54] It's actually limiting the success of an
[1:15:57] entire meeting. I mean, who wants to
[1:16:00] pray for people and then as they all go,
[1:16:03] they all get their sicknesses back?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And he says it's because there was a
[1:16:08] lack of confession in the people. There
[1:16:09] was things laying in the congregation.
[1:16:12] They were insincere. They weren't
[1:16:13] confessing. Confession comes first and
[1:16:16] then there's a real healing that takes
[1:16:18] place. got up and said, "Listen, before
[1:16:20] we have the healing line tonight, we're
[1:16:22] just going to lay things before the
[1:16:24] Lord." And then the meeting was come to
[1:16:27] uh the blessing of brother Bren feeling
[1:16:30] like something was more successful. But
[1:16:32] I want you to notice just as I close
[1:16:34] here, notice that statement to sons and
[1:16:36] daughters of God. I I never knew this
[1:16:39] until I begin to study it that that in
[1:16:42] the presence of the Holy Spirit, it took
[1:16:44] that off of him, but it was only
[1:16:47] temporary. Right?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And then the fellow, the maniac that
[1:16:52] come up and just was, I'm going to tear
[1:16:53] you to pieces tonight and God delivered
[1:16:57] him. But did you know he was only
[1:16:58] delivered temporarily? He fell at
[1:17:00] brother Bram's feet. They took him off
[1:17:02] the stage, the policeman. But he says he
[1:17:04] goes back to that because he worships
[1:17:06] that spirit.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I can tell you as sons of God tonight,
[1:17:11] daughters of God, God is not interested
[1:17:13] in a temporary deliverance for you. He's
[1:17:16] inter interested in a complete
[1:17:18] deliverance.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And that's comes as we learn how
[1:17:22] important our confession and our open
[1:17:25] book is before God. I have nothing to
[1:17:29] hide.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I'm an open book before him. Praise the
[1:17:33] Lord. Well, it's been good to be in the
[1:17:35] word tonight.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's been good to be in
[1:17:38] the house of God. Praise the Lord. I
[1:17:41] love it. I love it. I'm learning a lot.
[1:17:43] Can we stand together and pray together?
[1:17:49] Amen.
[1:17:53] Heavenly Father, you are so good to us.
[1:17:57] And Lord, it's not any different than
[1:17:59] when you were here 2,000 years ago.
[1:18:02] Sometimes we say, "I wish I was back
[1:18:04] then." But your manner and your the way
[1:18:05] that you are, you act the same way
[1:18:07] tonight. And Lord, you if you were in
[1:18:10] your body there, Jesus of Nazareth, that
[1:18:13] body, you'd speak to us the same way
[1:18:15] tonight. No doubt. Because it's Jesus
[1:18:17] still speaking to us. Maybe he has a
[1:18:19] suit on. Maybe he's a different form,
[1:18:22] but it's still your nature, Lord, to
[1:18:24] teach your sons, even David, who made
[1:18:27] such a huge mistake.
[1:18:30] You you drew him aside, Lord. You didn't
[1:18:32] want to embarrass him as such, but you
[1:18:34] drew him aside. Said, "You've got to
[1:18:36] address this thing. you've got to you
[1:18:37] got to confess this. And Nathan waited
[1:18:40] until David confessed and then went into
[1:18:43] repentance. We find his repentance in
[1:18:45] Psalms 51 as he repented before God and
[1:18:49] said, "Lord, purged me with hissup. Help
[1:18:52] me never to do that again. Lord, build
[1:18:54] the walls of Jerusalem. Lord, it was a
[1:18:56] complete repentance when he owned up to
[1:18:59] everything that he had done." And Lord,
[1:19:01] then his kingdom went on in such a
[1:19:03] wonderful way. And Lord, we have our
[1:19:05] little domains and our little kingdoms,
[1:19:07] our homes and our lives, Lord. And the
[1:19:10] responsibilities you've placed over us.
[1:19:13] And in any moment, if we start to hide a
[1:19:15] private sin, it can be taken away from
[1:19:18] us. Homes can be broken up. Churches can
[1:19:20] be broken up. Lord, at any moment, Satan
[1:19:23] could get in and with lies and destroy
[1:19:25] the unity of a church at any moment.
[1:19:27] He's waiting in the wings to do it. But
[1:19:30] Lord, I pray that you'll put up the the
[1:19:32] walls of Jerusalem for us tonight. Lord,
[1:19:35] I pray as we confess to you that we're
[1:19:37] wrong and you're right. I pray, Father,
[1:19:39] that you go to the very depths of our
[1:19:42] spirit and that we would just trust you
[1:19:45] to say, "God, I'm wrong and you're
[1:19:48] right. God, take out of me any desire
[1:19:51] that's not of you.
[1:19:53] Take out of me any desire to hide from
[1:19:55] you, Lord. I'm not we're not hiding
[1:19:57] anything from you. But the very fact
[1:19:59] that we would pretend we could hide it
[1:20:01] from you and could hide it from others.
[1:20:03] Forgive us, Lord, of that. Purge us,
[1:20:05] Lord. Cleanse us, Lord. If we live in
[1:20:08] the light, as promised in First John
[1:20:10] here, if we walk in that light, we're
[1:20:13] willing to be an open book. We're
[1:20:15] willing for that light to shine so deep
[1:20:17] in us, then we have real fellowship and
[1:20:20] real friendship and real godly
[1:20:23] connections with the body.
[1:20:26] And then Lord, the blood cleanses us
[1:20:28] from all sin. Lord, thank you for your
[1:20:31] word tonight. Thank you for loving us
[1:20:34] this way. And I pray, Lord, it wouldn't
[1:20:36] be just a intellectual moment, Lord,
[1:20:39] that our hearts be moved in a deep way,
[1:20:42] Father, to give you number one place in
[1:20:45] our lives.
[1:20:47] May we be sold out, Lord, 110%. May when
[1:20:50] you look at our heart, we believe,
[1:20:52] there's not a hesitation. We believe
[1:20:54] with all of our heart, soul, mind, and
[1:20:56] strength. That's the way you said to
[1:20:58] love you. Love me with all your heart,
[1:21:01] soul, mind, and strength. And that means
[1:21:04] everything that we are. Thank you,
[1:21:07] Jesus. And we pray there'll be many
[1:21:08] fruits come from this service tonight in
[1:21:12] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:21:15] Amen.
[1:21:17] Praise the Lord. God bless you tonight.
[1:21:19] Let's sing a couple courses. Jesus
[1:21:24] I love you Lord

[1:23:48] you what an awesome God you are. But
[1:23:54] words are not enough to tell you of your
[1:23:59] love.
[1:24:00] Listen to our

[1:24:26] And we will use the words we know to
[1:24:30] tell you what an awesome God you are.
[1:24:37] But words are not enough to tell you of
[1:24:41] our love. Listen to our heart. God bless
[1:24:46] you. You're dismissed tonight in Jesus
[1:24:47] name. Listen to our hearts.

[1:24:59] Praise the Lord.

[1:25:13] you.
