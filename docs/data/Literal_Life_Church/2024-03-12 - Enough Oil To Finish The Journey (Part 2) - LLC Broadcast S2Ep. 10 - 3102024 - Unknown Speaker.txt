for my I speak the Holy Name Jesus second Kings chapter 4 is where we want to read 2 Kings chapter 4 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and th th knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be Bond men so it was very rough times down the road from when Elijah pronounced judgment on the whole generation the whole nation and so there this this godly woman is living under the Shadow and the the gloominess and the debt and all that's happening and now they want to take her sons take her family under the debt creditors are coming she appeals to Elisha not Elijah Elisha and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in thy house and she said thy handmade hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil I don't have anything but a little pot of oil and then he said go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou when thou art come in Thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon the thy sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so this is not a public show the third poll is not a public show shut yourself in your house with your sons and start pouring that oil into these vessels she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed glory be to God and the oil stayed and then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the rest last time we talked about this we read in Matthew 25 the mystery under the seventh seal which the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord so in Matthew 25 we have three Parables that are related to the seventh seal or the coming of the Lord and that Parable spoke about the first Parable spoke about was about the oil that was essential to finish the journey it's about five wise virgins five foolish virgins and the only difference in the two there wasn't hardly there wasn't hardly any difference in those two groups Gathering they were virgins uh they were Sanctified they loved the Lord they took the journey in the message to go meet the bridegroom they were all in the same group but the only difference is one had oil in their lamps the other didn't have oil in their lamps and so we were speaking about this oil that is needed at the end time the last thing that they needed for the last leg of the journey was oil the only thing the main thing and so if that's a theme right now in the last days for our lives then we should be saying Lord there's one thing most important in me in my family's life do we have the oil and do we have enough of the Holy Spirit to finish the journey that's that should be dominating our minds more than any business adventure more than any family problem more than any sickness Lord do I have the oil and so now the foolish virgins they discovered that they didn't have it the last minute they discovered they had everything and they loved the Lord and they had all this but they discovered they didn't have the oil they came in the message to pursue the bridegroom they heard the midnight cry because when it says midnight how many know when it says midnight that's at the darkest time so it was at the darkest hour when the world had become dark when it become full of perversion and everything that it was at that time the Midnight Cry the final cry went out rise up it's time to meet the bridegroom and take the last the last step of the journey to meet the bridegroom and so they were virgins they were Sanctified they they re they rejoiced in all this cry they they actually woke up to the cry it wasn't just the wise virgins that woke up they woke up too they all woke up I heard the cry I heard the Midnight Cry they all were trimmed their lamps all were the same as far as trim they were pure good people Sanctified vessels of God but lacking the oil oil to take the final leg of the journey and that's pretty serious I can't preach it any more serious than what the parable gives it it's for our time it's for right now and so now if that's the essential thing there shouldn't be any other more essential thing in our lives except Lord every teenager ought to be saying I can't get in on my parents coattail every teenager should be go to God and say that's what the parable said my God warned me that the only thing lacking was the oil I better make sure God I'm seeking the Holy Ghost for myself if my dad don't have it my mom don't have it it doesn't matter I've got to seek this for myself it's more important than anything in life if Jesus said it was important and that's the parable we're living in right now and you're interested in the coming of the Lord and you're interested in meeting the bridegroom if you're interested in that then you have to have the oil you have to have the Holy Spirit you have to know that you have the Holy Spirit in your your life not just that you love God but there's an identification of the depth of your soul that I believe this word of this hour and I'm following it as best I can with all of my heart my goodness so important I want to remind just now some some things of the final summary I gave of Matthew 25 last Sunday and then we'll go into to to some things today it is foolish here's my summary of Matthew 25 it's foolish to pursue Christ the bridegroom without the oil first it's needed and I want to say this lastly about Matthew 25 it's about having what's needed to finish this journey we find here in the text of Second Kings chapter 4 that it is it's another witness in the Old Testament of the last days essential thing because anytime you read scriptures about Elijah or Elisha you're talking about our day because how many would say in Malachi 4 it says he'll send Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen and I we believe he has sent that that Ministry is done it's over he's fulfilled that scripture Malachi fulfill if you're listening on the broadcast or any other way come and talk to me because there's been a lot of Prophecy fulfilled that people don't know it's been fulfilled it's been fulfilled already and we're living in the time of that right now and so now because we're in the days of when Elijah was fulfilled when we go in the Old Testament and read about Elijah and Elisha we're right in our time the types and shadows apply to us and we can say I'm living right here and so when we come to Elisha he says to Elijah what do you want Elijah says what do you want Elisha says that a double portion of your spirit would fall on me hallelujah oh my what a request he said if that's what you ask for that's what I'm going to give you you know you have to ask for things God doesn't just hand it to you so now Elijah goes off the scene and Elisha she bride it's not the masculine part it's the feminine part now everything we read about Elisha now is typing I wanted to say first of all there's so many types in this that I don't have enough time today to preach on all the types another thing is I like to keep my jacket on so I look proper and good but it's too hot today so I'm taking my jacket off which means that I'll probably preach even harder there's so many types about Elijah and Elisha concerning this day I don't have time but I want to bring out one first of all and that is Elisha and Elijah both had meetings with widows with women and they were widows and they were living in a dark time both of them and they had a need during the dark time that's a type of the Bride because we live in the darkest times we live in a time of debt spiritually can you say Amen we're in in debt the world's inbt spiritually we're in a time that they want to take our children how many raise your hand they want to take our children so all all these scenarios are here and both these women had some Elijah came to one Elisha came to another one and it's interesting how they dealt with them they they lived in famine they lived in debt they lived in depressing times they lived in a time of loss they were barely getting by but then the scripture says in chapter four I read to you but in the middle of that there cried a woman under those conditions a woman cried now wasn't there other people crying during that time wasn't there other women crying I'd say there was I'd say because of the depressing times and the debt and all the the depression there was probably other woman that had tears and and that's fine God knows about that too but yet God this this one these women got God's attention their cry got God's attention and so now that's a wonderful thing thing to recognize that they both went to Widow women and that was to their that was their Ministry because Elijah he had a dispensational Ministry he spoke to the whole nation he brought a curse on Jezebel he brought a curse on Ahab and the whole house of ABAB which was a Jehovah Gyra believing King he was the king of of Israel but he married the wrong woman and so now Elijah came to put a curse on all that thing and stopped up the Heavens there was no rain there was famine in the land all the conditions a lot of the oh boy let me say it a lot of the conditions we're in right now is because Elijah came in this hour and he spoke the word and our nation and our world rejected Elijah and that's why we're in the conditions that we're in so remember that can you say am man it's because Elijah has come that we live in these conditions but the bride has to live in it until the Rapture time the brides living in these conditions and so there was others crying but this one got their attention and they went to these women so now I want you to notice something else there was a change in leadership from it was the same message but it was a a bit of change in leadership from Elijah to Elisha Elijah was bold Elijah called fire down from heaven he spoke to the entire dispensation Elijah he rebuked the whole generation his indictment was to the whole religious system he spoke boldly to Jezebel but Elisha Elisha he didn't do all that he didn't speak judgment to the whole uh generation and dispensation he didn't have to Elijah had already done it it's not to the whole generation but Elijah's Ministry was more to the personal effect it wasn't to the nation it was more to the person it was to non it was to this widow woman it was dealing personally anytime he got involved with preachers it didn't go so well remember when he first was first finished there they were looking for Elijah they said we're we're going to go find Elijah would you come with us he said you know Elijah's gone on in The Chariot they're trying to bring Elijah back Elijah spoke to the whole He indicted the entire religious system not the people but he indicted the entire religious system for crucifying the Son of God aresh again but Elisha when he came he didn't do that it was more of a personal level to meet the god meeting the personal needs personal Revival not a national Revival a personal healing to individuals a personal restoration to individuals Elijah he pronounced Judgment of the whole system Jezebel he wasn't afraid of Jezebel he was B just telling it like it is and but but Elisha his manner was more to the personal thing and I just want to say once again about judgment the bride is the true bride is no longer under the judgments of God she has the Holy Ghost she's past judgment so why do you keep bringing judgment on the bride she's past judgment praise the Lord you say what about when Elisha called two she Bears Out of the Woods because he got offended at his complex about his bald head one of the things preachers needs well two or three things PE preachers have to grow out of personally in their walk with God they've got to grow out of their complexes right because sometimes they preach their complexes and not the word of God and that day if you think that he was that's the day that Elisha was acting like Elijah a little bit because he's GNA call the she Bears out and kill those kids but it looked like Elijah he's getting out of Step his ministry wasn't Elijah to pronounce judgment like that it was Elisha and so he acted out of place he made a mistake did I say that un National he made a mistake and he preached his own complex should we go through the Bible and talk about Moses the great prophet who made a mistake and one day struck the rock twice because of his frustration with the people and his temper got up to the people so bad he was supposed to strike it once and struck it twice made a mistake God said your temper that thing you're not even going in the promised land it's in your Bible everybody hold your Bible it's it's it's in there God's true Prophet definitely but he made a mistake there he got in the flesh and so Elisha that's the one time I don't know why I'm elaborating on this is not in my notes but i' like to say that he called them out he shouldn't have done that because once again it's this whole thing is that the administration or the leadership had changed under Elisha even though the spirit was a double portion the administration of it changed a bit because it was not to speak to the nation there was not to be a national Revival that was that day he called fire down and then Israel they all they come around that he did Elijah was to do that can you say Amen around the country almost in every major city in this nation Elijah spoke amen now now Elisha he ministers and he ministers personally it's not a national Revival and so now one of the things that Elisha does clearly is when someone has a need he always asks for them to do something first before he meets the need now Elijah had the power if somebody was out of money or somebody had Elijah he just say okay it's yours that's it it's yours but somehow with elij Elisha he's asking for them to do something that's right and then they get their Miracle non was struck with Leprosy and he comes send he didn't even go himself he said you you go and tell non he needs to dip seven times in the dirtiest River in all of Israel Jordan he needs to go dip seven times and then he'll receive my healing now this is a great man and he's and he doesn't even come himself my dad used to say that the servant knocked on the door and non came to the door and it servant he said I asked for Elisha to come he said Elijah said he's not coming he just sent me his servant well I want to see the man I want to see the pastor himself good thing he didn't have that attitude but he says um he said if you go down and dip seven times in Jordan you'll be healed that's right just at that moment is a test of your faith but it's God asking you to do something dirty not dirty in the sense of sinful but doing something that's not convenient not easy so go dip seven times okay all right I'll go do it and maybe he was grumbling the whole time I wanted to see Elijah I wanted to see the guy and he goes down this is the muddiest river in in all of Israel the Jordan why couldn't he pick this how could he why oh why do I have to do this he dipped finish the story he went ahead and dipped seven times and when he come out he was healed of his leprosy so this Prophet was asking you to do something first a personal contact with God through Elisha but he's asking for you to do something first and he did that with this woman he says woman what do you have need of what can I do for you she says they're going to take my sons we're in debt you know my husband's gone a widow he served you with the fear of God he loved the message of the hour he's gone we're under the pressure of this famine and they're going to take my children I have nothing he said you have nothing she said I have nothing do you have anything well I've got a pot of oil left now when Elijah dealt with the widow woman she had a little a little meal and she had a little bit of oil and he says I want you to take that and make a cake she said well I'm making the cake it's my last cake for me and my son to die we're going to that's it we're finished it's our last me go and make the cake take what oil you have put it together make a cake and bring the cake to me so I can eat God knows how to test you in What You Won't Give Up but she did it and she got a miracle and this woman said all right he said go get all the vessels empty them all make sure there's nothing in the vessels empty out the vessels and and and then you start bringing this together and the son Sons started to do it behind closed doors in a secret place with God and they filled every vessel up every empty vessel vessel was filled with the oil can you say praise the lord it's a type of our day bring your empty vessel to God empty out of yourself empty out of your knowledge and your past bitterness and your past experiences empty out of your religious Pride empty out of all of it and say God fill it now with your oil now let me go back to this theme of finishing you know God is looking for ones who can finish the race not just starters it's not that you begun believing this message of Christ a lot of people begin how many knows that two million come out of Egypt right under a prophet's message how many you know that amen there's a lot of people that began the journey with a prophet out of Egypt through the Wilderness there was a great host that did that there was a lot of starters but very few finishers it's that you it's not that you begin but it's that you it's how you end is that you end the same way Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed God is a completer how many knows that God is a completer God is not wanting to just start something in you he wants to finish something in you he that hath begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete a work in you she brought her vessels that girl brought her vessels empty to be filled with oil it made all the way to the end it was enough the Bible said and the oil stayed that's my sermon to you this morning the oil stayed there was enough oil to finish out the darkness to finish out the days of famine she she lived through it all and guess what she got her children back too somebody say praise the Lord she got her children back they didn't take them away from her this oil is so powerful it'll bring your children back to you this oil is so powerful it'll bring you into the glories of God this oil is so powerful it'll heal cancer this oil is so powerful it'll give us rapturing f Faith this oil is powerful to make you a mighty warrior this oil is powerful to give you faith when you don't have faith the most essential thing at the end time is the oil thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall
