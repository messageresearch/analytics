[0:00] i'm going to go back and finish in
[0:01] nehemiah tonight we'll be all
[0:03] wrapped up in this section of scripture
[0:05] so if you would read with me the text we
[0:07] read last wednesday and uh this would be
[0:09] blessed families part 11.
[0:11] and we'll finish up this uh segment of
[0:14] scriptures here and then we'll just see
[0:15] where the lord leads after this i i want
[0:17] to have a few of the ministers here some
[0:19] wednesday nights and get them back
[0:21] on board and to share what theirs are
[0:23] they're on their hearts they you know
[0:25] they're studying the word and seeing
[0:27] things and sending me quotes and
[0:28] different things and they just get on
[0:29] fire of god
[0:31] some things that god's placed on their
[0:32] hearts so we want to give room for all
[0:35] the gifts to be able to be used whatever
[0:37] they are and there's not just one gift
[0:39] here but there's many gifts in the body
[0:42] and we want to encourage those and see
[0:44] them grow in the lord all your gifts
[0:46] everyone should have a part
[0:47] nehemiah chapter 4 is where we were
[0:49] reading nehemiah chapter 4 and starting
[0:52] at verse 7. you love the lord tonight
[0:55] but it came to pass that when samut and
[0:58] tobiah and the arabians and the
[1:00] ammonites
[1:02] and the astadites heard that the walls
[1:04] of jerusalem were made up and that the
[1:06] breaches began to be stopped that they
[1:08] were very roth
[1:10] and conspired all of them together to
[1:12] come and to fight against jerusalem and
[1:14] to hinder it nevertheless
[1:16] nehemiah says nevertheless we made our
[1:18] prayer unto god
[1:20] and set a watch against them day and
[1:22] night because of them
[1:24] and so notice now what he's saying that
[1:26] we heard that they were going to
[1:27] intimidate us we heard that they were
[1:29] going to come against us they didn't
[1:30] know how
[1:32] they were going to come against them but
[1:33] he says we we set a watch we set a guard
[1:36] day and night because of them because of
[1:37] their intimidation we're ready for them
[1:40] and judah said the strength of the
[1:42] bearers of burdens is decayed and there
[1:44] is much rubbish so that we are
[1:46] not able to build the wall and our
[1:48] adversary said they shall not know
[1:51] neither see till we come in the midst
[1:52] among them and slay them and cause the
[1:55] work to cease that was the agenda to
[1:57] stop the work of the lord and it came to
[2:00] pass that when the jews which dwelt by
[2:02] them came they said unto us ten times
[2:06] from all places when she shall return
[2:08] unto us they will be upon you talk about
[2:10] intimidation and they said it ten times
[2:13] intimidating things they're gonna be
[2:14] coming
[2:15] they're gonna be coming they'll be upon
[2:17] you and therefore set eye in the lower
[2:19] places behind the wall and on the higher
[2:21] places i even set the people after their
[2:25] families
[2:26] with their swords their spears and their
[2:30] bows and i looked rose up and said unto
[2:33] the nobles and to the rulers and to the
[2:34] rest of the people be not ye afraid of
[2:37] them remember the lord which is great
[2:39] and terrible and fight for your brother
[2:41] and your sons and your daughters your
[2:43] wives and your houses notice zerubbabel
[2:47] inspiring the people encouraging the
[2:50] people what to fight for fight for your
[2:52] sons
[2:53] fight for your daughters fight for your
[2:55] houses fight for your families can you
[2:57] say amen amen
[2:59] it came to pass when our enemies heard
[3:01] that it was known unto us and god had
[3:03] brought their counsel to naught that we
[3:05] returned all of us to the wall every
[3:08] everyone unto his work
[3:10] and it came to pass from that time forth
[3:13] that the half of my servants wrought in
[3:15] the work and the other half of them held
[3:17] both their spears the shields and the
[3:19] bows
[3:21] and the hammer what is that word
[3:23] somebody help me out
[3:26] habergeons i guess it is and i really
[3:28] don't know what that is that's got to be
[3:30] some type of weapon of some kind i would
[3:32] imagine if it's with the shields and
[3:33] bows and spears somebody look that up
[3:36] and get back to me if you would
[3:38] and the rulers were behind all the house
[3:40] of judah
[3:42] they which build it on the wall and they
[3:44] that bear burdens with those that loaded
[3:46] look at this now every one every one
[3:49] with one of his hands wrought in the
[3:51] work and with the other hand held a
[3:54] weapon
[3:55] it's a good balance right
[3:57] for the builders everyone had his sword
[3:59] girded by his side and so build it and
[4:02] he that sounded the trumpet was by me
[4:04] and this goes on and on and on i hope
[4:06] you read through nehemiah had the chance
[4:08] to because it's very inspiring to see
[4:11] what the lord did there let's let's just
[4:12] have a small word of prayer
[4:14] lord jesus we ask you again to bless the
[4:17] word tonight
[4:18] bless those prayer requests that we
[4:20] brought before you some of them urgent
[4:21] lord we pray you'll be mindful of them
[4:24] bless brother paul coffey tonight who's
[4:26] sick has been sick yesterday and just
[4:29] healing now but just continue to make
[4:30] him well so that he can enjoy his trip
[4:32] here and we pray you'll bless the word
[4:34] bless the families lord we pray that we
[4:37] as we come tonight you'll be able to
[4:38] pierce through
[4:40] any walls of darkness that we have put
[4:42] up or if satan has brought in our lives
[4:44] and the lord that we could walk in the
[4:46] joy of the lord and we commit that to
[4:48] you and our lives to you just now as we
[4:50] sit at your feet
[4:52] in jesus name we ask it
[4:54] amen amen you may be seated tonight god
[4:57] bless you
[5:00] the last time we spoke we were talking
[5:02] about the meeting
[5:03] of building the wall together
[5:06] and for some reason uh nehemiah we don't
[5:09] know all the reasons but he set the
[5:11] people on this wall of jerusalem he set
[5:14] them on there according to their
[5:15] families we don't know all the reasons
[5:17] but i thought it was significant to
[5:18] realize that somehow this leader
[5:20] under the inspiration of god was wanting
[5:22] to bring the families together let them
[5:25] be able to do something together as a
[5:27] family this was the vision of the lord
[5:29] for that day this is what god was trying
[5:32] to accomplish for the day that they
[5:34] lived in and they caught the inspiration
[5:36] of it but somehow nima i said if you've
[5:38] caught what we need to do let's do it
[5:40] together as families maybe there was a
[5:41] greater protection with that or
[5:44] something with that i know that god's
[5:45] all for families i know that i know that
[5:48] god is for the families being in unity i
[5:50] know that god is for churches to be in
[5:52] unity
[5:53] uh whether we look like it all the time
[5:55] or not god has that uh god has that in
[5:58] his mind can you say amen the bible says
[6:00] in ephesians till we all come into the
[6:01] unity of the faith so i know god has in
[6:04] his mind and i know he has it in mind
[6:06] for families to be one for fathers and
[6:08] mothers and children and the families to
[6:10] be able to be as one so it does come
[6:12] from the mind of god for nehemiah to say
[6:15] if we're going to work on this wall
[6:17] let's set it according to the families
[6:19] and let the families work on the wall
[6:21] together let them do that i think i
[6:24] think that's a great encouragement to
[6:25] the families and not only encouragement
[6:28] but a challenge to you to ask yourself
[6:31] the question what what is our family
[6:34] goal what is a
[6:35] let me just ask it this way because
[6:36] brother ram asks this of all of us he
[6:38] says if if you know god put you here on
[6:40] earth then somewhere along the line
[6:43] you've got to go say to the one who put
[6:45] you here god what do you have me on
[6:47] earth to do
[6:49] what am i here for
[6:51] if you haven't asked that as an
[6:52] individual then then you're not even
[6:54] acknowledging the one who brought you
[6:56] here
[6:57] who brought you here you didn't bring
[6:58] yourself here you know it's not your own
[7:00] life god breathed life into you
[7:03] god brought you on the face of the earth
[7:05] your creator did and so somewhere along
[7:07] the line we got to acknowledge that god
[7:10] sent us here and so we say as he worded
[7:12] it he said you know lord what did you
[7:14] give me on earth to do what did you put
[7:16] me here to do show me he says it's like
[7:18] being out on a job and you took a job
[7:20] and you go out there in the field and
[7:22] but you don't know what your duties are
[7:23] you don't know what you're supposed to
[7:24] do and you sit around he says we don't
[7:26] want to do that you'd go to your boss
[7:28] and say now i've been hired here but
[7:30] what what is it you want me to do what's
[7:31] my duties and in every age god has this
[7:34] vision god has something he's trying to
[7:36] do something he's trying to achieve and
[7:38] in every age we should ask yourself and
[7:40] in this manner every family should ask
[7:43] themselves god
[7:44] what do you want our family to
[7:46] accomplish for the kingdom of god
[7:49] and friends i don't want to put anybody
[7:51] in a box in that that i have heard so
[7:54] many testimonies and stories of how god
[7:56] uniquely uses families to accomplish
[7:59] something for his kingdom
[8:01] uh our family sings and and that's our a
[8:03] lot of our contribution to the work of
[8:05] the lord and we it's just by yielding to
[8:08] the gifts but i don't want that to be
[8:09] emphasized there are so many things and
[8:12] every family needs a family identity
[8:14] what is it you know we all have things
[8:16] we enjoy to do together whatever it is
[8:18] but what is your family identity is that
[8:20] what can we do as a family or what can
[8:22] we not so much do but what is our
[8:24] contribution what is our part
[8:26] what is our gift what is our little slot
[8:29] there that that and when we get on the
[8:31] other side i want to know that i made a
[8:34] contribution to god's work
[8:36] being continued amen there might be some
[8:39] family and they got a multi-million
[8:41] dollar business and and so now they're
[8:43] able to build churches around the world
[8:45] they're able to go sometimes and if they
[8:47] got a construction company send a crew
[8:49] and build those churches actually and
[8:52] there's families in the message that do
[8:53] that families and denominations that do
[8:55] that and so that's their family they're
[8:57] able to be uh have millions of dollars
[8:59] and and so you're saying man i wish that
[9:01] was mine i'd like to be the i'd like to
[9:03] be the contributor a million dollars but
[9:05] you see you can't you you got to go and
[9:07] ask god what is my contribution here
[9:10] what is my part because i've seen people
[9:11] do even more without any dollars
[9:14] can you say man a lot of things in this
[9:16] slide say it takes money well it does
[9:18] take money um but some things if you
[9:21] yield to the lord he'll provide what's
[9:23] needed amen can i get an amen he'll
[9:25] provide what's needed because he's the
[9:27] provider he's jehovah jireh and he's got
[9:29] something for you to do he will provide
[9:31] a way
[9:33] the spanish translation project is an
[9:35] example of something that's been in my
[9:37] heart for about almost 20 years to see
[9:39] launch and see done and sped up
[9:42] and uh god has his timing and his season
[9:44] too you can push all you want to but
[9:46] until it's god's season and here the
[9:48] last couple years bang things begin to
[9:50] open up and listen you don't have to
[9:51] worry about the money you have to worry
[9:53] about the money if god's in something
[9:54] the money will be there but all the
[9:57] gifts and the families all the things
[9:58] what is it and and so i may not be able
[10:01] to convince a 70 year old man of this
[10:04] but i've got young guys sitting here and
[10:06] someday someday they're going to have a
[10:08] family someday they're going to have
[10:09] little kids coming up and and some of
[10:12] you got that little children i would
[10:14] love for you to have a desire in your
[10:16] heart to put before the lord god i don't
[10:18] know what our family vision is but i
[10:20] want to ask my i want to teach my
[10:22] children that we're on earth to
[10:24] accomplish something for the kingdom of
[10:26] god amen not only to live this gospel
[10:29] not just to do that but lord what is it
[10:31] that you can do through us
[10:33] and that's good to get that in our
[10:34] hearts now these young girls to get it
[10:37] in their hearts now to live an unselfish
[10:40] life to love a life living for others
[10:42] that if i go to be an engineer if i go
[10:44] to be a farmer or if i go to be this i'm
[10:46] going to be a housewife whatever it is
[10:48] whatever calling god has for you no
[10:50] matter what it is god can use it for his
[10:52] kingdom
[10:53] praise the lord to that for sure
[10:56] we believe it but you got to find your
[10:57] place or you'd be bouncing around your
[10:59] whole life
[11:01] you got to find your place what am i
[11:02] here to do find that place but family's
[11:05] doing i think that's a wonderful thing
[11:06] when families can do it a family
[11:08] identity some goal that you're wanting
[11:10] to achieve together
[11:11] have a family vision and so the word
[11:14] in in this hour is building a people
[11:17] into himself and that's why we can type
[11:19] this thing of of this wall being built
[11:22] of protection around the temple of god
[11:24] the whole temple the all that speaks of
[11:27] the temples of the holy ghost that god
[11:29] is building in the last days a bride
[11:31] that he's building a word bride that
[11:33] he's building in the last days and the
[11:35] building or we should say the rebuilding
[11:38] of it is happening now the word is
[11:41] building a people unto himself
[11:43] the word right now i don't you can look
[11:46] at all the negative all you want to get
[11:48] your eyes off the negative
[11:50] pastor get your eyes off the negative
[11:53] saints of god get your eyes off the
[11:54] negative
[11:55] all along while the negatives going on
[11:58] god has spoken his word and you know
[12:00] what he's doing he's building a people
[12:02] for himself he's building temples can
[12:04] you say a man
[12:06] he's building the people of character
[12:08] he's building that statue of a perfect
[12:10] man in us and he's building a bride unto
[12:13] himself and so and a lot of it is
[12:16] rebuilding or restoration because he had
[12:19] a people as brother doug was saying he
[12:21] had a people at pentecost they would
[12:22] have been ready for the rapture right
[12:24] there that would have been it and he
[12:25] explained to us the reasons why that
[12:27] there was more seed
[12:28] of god to come and so now because there
[12:31] has more to come that was the time for
[12:33] the rapture but they had the faith right
[12:35] there in the early church
[12:36] but it wasn't time yet so now uh there
[12:39] has to be a purging or a captivity time
[12:42] just like when the children went into
[12:43] captivity in babylon to purge off all
[12:46] the the bad seed so that all the true
[12:48] seed could come forth and here these
[12:50] people right are right here coming out
[12:52] of babylon making the trip with zoroable
[12:55] making the trip with ezra making the
[12:58] trip now with nehemiah to come back for
[13:00] the purpose of restoration restoring
[13:03] they had the temple one day but now
[13:05] we're under a ministry of restoration
[13:07] amen
[13:08] all the scriptures many of the
[13:10] scriptures in the end times speak of a
[13:11] ministry of restoration starting with
[13:13] the prophet ending with his people
[13:14] coming into that restoration ministry
[13:17] being rebuilt themselves and so i'd like
[13:19] to say this that uh part of working
[13:23] on what god is doing in this our part of
[13:25] working is being teachable to learn
[13:29] god's ways for everything that's you
[13:31] know that's that's part of rebuilding
[13:33] because
[13:34] if men would have come in that did not
[13:37] know god's principles
[13:39] they would have rebuilt that place their
[13:41] own modern way
[13:42] the worldly way the wisdom of the world
[13:45] can you say amen so so now being 70
[13:47] years away from it maybe not remembering
[13:50] all about it they had to read books they
[13:51] had to they had to go to the prophets
[13:54] they had to learn of the teachers
[13:56] what is god's way to build something
[13:59] now we're that way because you know what
[14:01] happens for generation after generation
[14:03] especially the television generation
[14:06] it so messes with our minds
[14:09] that we only know the world's way on
[14:11] something
[14:13] we only know the world's way of the
[14:14] approach to christianity
[14:18] he wasn't born you wasn't born back in
[14:20] the in the middle ages or early ages or
[14:22] even in the time of luther when the
[14:24] restoration started he wasn't born that
[14:26] then but you were born here at the at
[14:28] the uh the
[14:30] last century or or of the 20th century i
[14:33] should say and during the 20th century
[14:36] is satan's almost his worst work to
[14:39] destroy the minds of men through
[14:41] television to destroy marriages to
[14:44] destroy manhood to destroy womanhood
[14:47] to bring in homosexuality to destroy
[14:50] families can you say amen to destroy and
[14:53] through all that destroy the true vision
[14:55] of christianity and what it means to be
[14:56] a christian
[14:58] to where today we can sit in churches
[15:01] and that church by the way people are
[15:04] acting by the way they're dressing by
[15:06] the way they're involved in the things
[15:08] of the world it doesn't resemble the
[15:11] it's really watered down the name
[15:12] christian hasn't it
[15:15] so what did we need
[15:16] we needed a prophet
[15:18] we needed a restoration
[15:20] and so under a restoration it begins to
[15:23] god and his grace begins to reteach us
[15:27] now listen if you're not teachable
[15:29] you're not going to be re-taught
[15:32] you have to have a spirit of humility
[15:33] i'm i'm ready for god to challenge every
[15:35] former thinking that i had i'm ready for
[15:37] god to re-teach me i'm sitting at his
[15:39] feet lord teach me what it is to rebuild
[15:42] the temple of the holy ghost amen
[15:44] what it means to be a christian what a
[15:45] spirit-filled christian is re-teach me
[15:47] what that is and so now part of working
[15:50] is being teachable to learn god's ways
[15:51] on everything to rebuild things his way
[15:54] to rebuild things
[15:56] god's way
[16:03] internet opinions
[16:05] are probably the last place in the world
[16:08] to find god's way
[16:12] to build a family to build a christian
[16:14] life
[16:16] and this is the information age it's a
[16:18] lot of information a lot of it sounds
[16:19] good
[16:20] but we can be well
[16:22] whether we realize or not we're being
[16:24] taught by that
[16:25] so we got to have a guard up to who
[16:27] we're taught by because we only want to
[16:28] build this thing according to god's
[16:29] blueprint
[16:31] the way god wants it bill that's right i
[16:32] want to be the christian that god said
[16:34] that i would be and what god's looking
[16:36] for in this hour and so internet
[16:38] opinions is the last place to look the
[16:40] modern family is the furthest model to
[16:42] look at even television shows called the
[16:45] modern family uh with perversion in it
[16:48] one of them is a homosexual couple one
[16:50] of one of those this one of that three
[16:51] families there in the whole scenario of
[16:53] that television show called the modern
[16:55] family and it's a mockery to what the
[16:57] true family is
[16:58] but people feed on that and now a sudden
[17:00] the true family is dished out and this
[17:02] is what they have as a vision of a
[17:04] modern family this is what a family is
[17:07] and so if you you get filled with that
[17:09] god has to purge those things out of
[17:11] your mind and you start to look in your
[17:13] bible what a real family is
[17:15] amen i'll tell you that i'm telling you
[17:17] that does not happen overnight
[17:19] the holy ghost comes in your life uh i
[17:22] believe in a in a change of your nature
[17:24] but growing into god's principles does
[17:27] not happen overnight that's why we got
[17:29] to have a lot of grace for one another
[17:31] because every once in a while some of
[17:33] those old
[17:35] uh ways and those old soap operas
[17:39] spill over into your life
[17:41] and you got drama going on in the church
[17:43] you got drama going on in the families
[17:45] whenever we see that happen it's just
[17:47] like okay something's spilling over here
[17:49] and we're going
[17:50] that's not how things are supposed to
[17:52] work
[17:53] it's a spirit-filled people and so you
[17:55] have grace and you say lord
[17:57] it's spilled over in me before
[18:00] somebody's ever had something spill how
[18:02] much i ever had something and it just
[18:04] you know before you
[18:06] you hear it and it spills out of here
[18:08] before you process it through the brain
[18:10] or through the heart for that matter
[18:13] praise the lord i feel at home here
[18:15] tonight
[18:17] not everybody raises my hand but anyway
[18:19] you know
[18:20] it comes in here and things just spill
[18:22] out and it's all sudden you realize even
[18:24] after you say it man if you're in your
[18:26] bible you're feeding on the word you
[18:28] can't justify that
[18:30] because that is a carnal human being
[18:33] acting like a gentile carnal human being
[18:36] not as a christian
[18:38] so it's a growth
[18:40] it's a growth it's purging out old ideas
[18:44] of what a christian should be what a
[18:45] husband should be what a wife should be
[18:48] television teaches
[18:50] 99
[18:51] point whatever percent that is teaches
[18:54] wrong images of almost everything can i
[18:57] get a witness of that yes
[18:59] yeah brother brandt says if it could
[19:01] have been used for the kingdom of god
[19:02] would have been the greatest tool for
[19:03] the world and thankfully there's some
[19:05] channels there that are used to preach
[19:07] the gospel that's wonderful i praise god
[19:09] for that but for the most part it's all
[19:11] the wrong images
[19:13] it's all idols and images that we begin
[19:15] to bow to you say well i didn't i don't
[19:17] get down in front of the tv and bow to
[19:19] it but what you're bound to is the the
[19:22] principles it's teaching you because
[19:24] when you buy into them your life bows to
[19:26] that because it starts to incorporate it
[19:29] all right yeah that's how you bow to
[19:31] that idol it's an image placed in front
[19:33] of you and so you eventually buy into
[19:35] the image and you bow to it in your this
[19:37] is what i want uh an example of that
[19:40] would be uh you see somebody what they
[19:42] wear there or something so yes a young
[19:44] girl she's watched enough and that
[19:45] becomes her image so in her heart she
[19:47] begins to bow to that and worship it
[19:50] that's what i want to be
[19:52] you see so and it may not be the right
[19:54] image a lot of times it's not and it and
[19:56] it's taking you from the image of what a
[19:58] true young girl should be so television
[20:01] teaches wrong images i don't have to
[20:02] spend a lot of time on that because you
[20:04] know that been there done that you know
[20:05] those things you should know these
[20:07] things
[20:08] but god uses stones to build with in
[20:10] this stones and i really believe the
[20:13] stones is the word of god or the
[20:14] revelation he gives us at the end time
[20:17] and we take these his own stones and
[20:20] begin to begin to build rebuild with his
[20:23] stones
[20:25] his revelations
[20:26] his principles
[20:28] not the worlds but but those in those
[20:30] days nehemiah gave them the stones that
[20:33] they were to use to rebuild this temple
[20:35] god has given us the principles and
[20:37] stones through the message of the hour
[20:39] to rebuild families to rebuild lives to
[20:42] rebuild christians that we have
[20:43] spiritual christians
[20:46] i'm thankful for the message of the hour
[20:48] because it's given us the revelations we
[20:50] need
[20:51] to rebuild
[20:54] gave us the foundation gave us the
[20:56] stones to build the walls and so we
[20:58] begin rebuilding the stones that god
[21:00] sent us and i want to say this that's
[21:02] the word the radical things that the
[21:04] prophet brought
[21:06] be careful you don't criticize them
[21:08] because even the radical things the
[21:10] prophet brought that are now being
[21:11] dished off as brother brahma's opinions
[21:13] and everything's be careful and just say
[21:15] be careful because the the things that
[21:17] appear so radical that he's saying
[21:19] uh
[21:20] are brought to be the rebuilding stones
[21:23] that god sent us
[21:25] to rebuild us into a people of god
[21:28] amen
[21:29] and it's quite possible some of them
[21:30] will why are they radical
[21:32] because we're a hundred years now past
[21:34] anything being decent in this world
[21:37] the prophet starts speaking and he
[21:38] becomes a radical right come on you know
[21:40] how to dress all the other what's proper
[21:42] in church order all these other things
[21:44] now it's become radical because why is
[21:46] it radical not because
[21:48] god made us radical because we live in a
[21:50] world that makes that look radical
[21:53] it looks radical some of it looks
[21:55] radical to most of christianity
[21:58] be careful you don't dump the baby out
[22:00] with the bath water
[22:02] be careful you don't just dismiss it as
[22:04] being that was brother brown's opinion
[22:06] you dump it out his opinion
[22:08] i have found that sometimes those things
[22:10] that seem so strange to the world are
[22:13] the rebuilding stones
[22:16] amen
[22:17] that i can build my life on
[22:20] so give it a chance feed on the message
[22:22] yourself
[22:23] don't take people's opinion
[22:25] from somewhere else and what it is you
[22:27] find out what it is
[22:29] you read it yourself everybody in this
[22:30] building can read
[22:32] everybody in this building can listen to
[22:34] can you say man don't find out from some
[22:36] other some other person or some other
[22:38] source you go and find out
[22:41] you find it and you know what if you're
[22:42] prayerful and humble i believe god will
[22:44] show you that god in his grace sent the
[22:47] stepping stones and the building stones
[22:49] to rebuild a people for the lord yes
[22:52] that's right
[22:53] and then when that happens all of a
[22:55] sudden is what happened with me
[22:57] as i got into it then brother branham as
[22:59] a man
[23:01] begin to fade out of the picture to
[23:03] where i couldn't even already see him
[23:04] anymore that's right yeah amen that's
[23:06] why i can't get my mind wrapped around
[23:08] somebody saying that we're lifting up a
[23:09] man because when i begin to study it and
[23:11] caught the christ in it the band william
[23:13] branham just faded off
[23:15] i will love him i'll embrace him someday
[23:17] when i get the other side i will thank
[23:18] him for his service but as i fed on the
[23:20] word christ became prominent in his
[23:22] principles and i don't see the man when
[23:24] i feed him the message i don't see the
[23:26] man anymore
[23:27] i see what god gave me for this hour
[23:31] no disrespect to him but i'm telling you
[23:34] that's what happened to me that's what
[23:35] happened with this message i don't i i i
[23:38] that that if that thing that that makes
[23:40] him something that
[23:41] and i and even being accused of lifting
[23:43] him above it no god put him in that
[23:45] position but but when i feed on it it's
[23:48] now it's like brother brown says you
[23:50] have one of those pictures
[23:51] and you're in the mall or whatever it is
[23:53] and you look and it's all messed up and
[23:55] it's all just a bunch of colors and
[23:57] everything else but you got to stand
[23:58] there and keep looking at it
[24:01] and you keep looking at it because
[24:02] there's something in there somebody's
[24:04] ever done that in the mall how many's
[24:05] done it for hours before you caught it
[24:08] i'm usually there for quite a long time
[24:10] so you're looking you're looking
[24:11] and everybody else catches it within
[24:13] seconds and i'm still there i don't see
[24:15] it
[24:16] you know there's this there's a
[24:18] beautiful picture in there and you keep
[24:20] looking and looking sometimes when you
[24:22] strain too hard
[24:24] you still see it
[24:26] so you don't need to get all nervous i
[24:28] gotta see this
[24:30] even with the message right just pray
[24:33] just keep looking at it
[24:35] be humble
[24:36] and this is the way brother says this he
[24:38] says once you see christ the message
[24:41] then the rest is filler amen
[24:43] that's why he said it about his own
[24:45] message
[24:46] once you see christ the rest is filler
[24:49] amen that's right
[24:51] and that's what i've seen that's my
[24:52] testimony and so now before we disregard
[24:55] things we should realize some of this
[24:58] is the rebuilding stones to rebuild a
[25:01] people now let's talk about them
[25:03] having to stand there as families or sit
[25:06] there however they did it
[25:08] around this wall
[25:10] holding on to their swords
[25:12] their spears their weapons
[25:16] last week we talked about them building
[25:17] what that meant so now i want to get to
[25:19] but while they're building he had him
[25:21] set his families and they got their
[25:22] swords there near them they're holding
[25:24] their swords they got their in fact the
[25:26] next few scriptures says he had some men
[25:28] there that were building with one hand
[25:31] and had their sword in the other hand
[25:33] i love it i love it
[25:36] and so why why though that they had the
[25:38] swords because
[25:39] there was a hindering force around them
[25:42] all the time that had an agenda to
[25:45] discourage them
[25:47] to scare them
[25:49] to intimidate them
[25:52] uh let me go further to there was a a
[25:54] there was a an influence there that was
[25:57] right close
[25:58] that was meant to hinder the work that
[26:00] they were trying to do to discourage
[26:03] true believers
[26:04] of uh to follow the instructions and you
[26:07] remember friends and i hate to keep
[26:09] getting on it but you remember that this
[26:12] the instructions they had to go back and
[26:14] rebuild and the whole restoration thing
[26:16] was a prophet's word under jeremiah that
[26:19] says that after 70 years i will deliver
[26:22] you out of captivity and i will take you
[26:24] back and restore the temple and you'll
[26:25] build it again that was the prophet's
[26:27] word that they do this they're walking
[26:29] in the vision of a prophet's word
[26:32] and the instructions of a prophet's word
[26:34] so now this wasn't their own agenda
[26:35] there was no own thing to do they
[26:37] weren't going to do it just to
[26:39] make themselves popular they're under a
[26:41] prophet's word when they do this so when
[26:43] they went back and done it there was
[26:45] those there to discourage the true
[26:48] believers who were wanting to follow the
[26:50] instructions of the prophet's word of
[26:52] restoration
[26:54] i said that they were there those there
[26:57] to discourage
[26:59] is everybody got their ears on amen if
[27:01] you believe me as a pastor believe me
[27:04] now
[27:04] that there are influences to discourage
[27:08] true believers
[27:09] when they want to follow the
[27:10] instructions of a prophet's word of
[27:13] restoration amen amen
[27:16] it's not them it's the spirit
[27:19] in the last days
[27:20] not the people
[27:22] but but but we have here uh tobiah and
[27:26] sanbolt
[27:28] being used
[27:29] of the enemy
[27:31] to discourage the true people of god
[27:33] true believers that want to follow the
[27:34] instructions of a prophet's word that's
[27:36] all scriptural jeremiah jeremiah he had
[27:39] the word of restoration that would be
[27:40] restored and under zerubbabel nehemiah
[27:43] and ezra they come back under that work
[27:44] of restoration and so now they
[27:47] we're not wanting to argue but the
[27:49] prophet spoke of this restoration coming
[27:51] and so now they caught that vision and
[27:53] says we're going to go do it zerubbabel
[27:55] ezra nehemiah we're going to go do this
[27:57] nehemiah wanting to build the wall and
[28:00] they said you know what if nobody else
[28:02] is interested in this we're interested
[28:03] in it
[28:04] we want to do it if no one else lives
[28:07] this we want to live it by his grace
[28:09] if no one else cares and says it's not
[28:11] important anymore but well that's fine
[28:13] but it's important to me
[28:15] we want to live this thing by his grace
[28:17] we want to build this thing and and and
[28:20] we want to and if we have to stand alone
[28:23] we'll stand alone but we have caught the
[28:25] vision of this day
[28:27] can i get an amen
[28:28] come on now there was some there that
[28:30] caught the vision of the day and said
[28:32] listen
[28:33] some may want may not want this but we
[28:35] want it we want to live it by his grace
[28:37] we want to do it because we believe this
[28:40] is what god wants to do at the evening
[28:41] time
[28:43] we have to stand alone we'll stand alone
[28:45] willing to stand alone
[28:48] praise the lord
[28:49] because it's not our word
[28:51] it wasn't their
[28:53] word it was jeremiah's prophecy one day
[28:55] that says after 70 years you'll be
[28:58] restored the temple will be rebuilt
[29:00] again
[29:02] the people will come back together again
[29:04] they'll go back into jerusalem against
[29:06] the prophet's word
[29:08] and so now there wasn't anything that
[29:10] could stop it if it's a true prophet's
[29:12] word right
[29:13] if he spoke something in his own name or
[29:16] his own assumption
[29:18] which men can do
[29:20] that's true
[29:21] he's reading deuteronomy 13 deuteronomy
[29:23] 18 you find the two places where he
[29:25] talks about testimony testing of a
[29:27] prophet testing of a
[29:29] whether he says what's right or not
[29:31] if that man points you should point you
[29:33] to other idols and he says he's a
[29:34] prophet of the lord
[29:36] we know that we can't follow him because
[29:39] he's pointing us to the wrong thing
[29:40] he points to himself if he points to
[29:43] other gods that's deuteronomy 13.
[29:45] okay that's how we know
[29:47] deuteronomy 18 says if one comes and
[29:49] he's pointing to other gods we know it's
[29:51] wrong but then if one comes in my name
[29:54] he's not pointing the people at other
[29:55] gods okay
[29:57] but the people ask
[29:58] but how do we know that what he's saying
[30:01] is what you said and not his own
[30:03] assumption it's a good question
[30:06] and god answers they weren't asking how
[30:08] do we know whether he was a prophet or
[30:09] not because a prophet can come in his
[30:11] name using his name
[30:13] and sometimes preach say something in
[30:15] their own assumption but he says how do
[30:17] i know that what he speaks to you so now
[30:18] i'm asking whether he's a true prophet
[30:20] or not he's asking is is how do we know
[30:23] whether this came from you what he says
[30:25] he says if it comes to pass it was from
[30:27] me if it doesn't come to pass then it
[30:29] wasn't for me
[30:30] amen
[30:32] and so
[30:33] these people knew this come from a true
[30:36] prophet of the lord they had already
[30:37] seen signs that god was in it all
[30:40] because
[30:41] uh nehemiah gets all discouraged at his
[30:43] job when he hears about the walls torn
[30:44] down his employee said this last week
[30:47] his employer the king there says what's
[30:49] the matter with you gideon you're always
[30:51] happy and singing and you know i got my
[30:53] mind made up and you're just
[30:55] for 10 years you've been working for me
[30:56] you've been happy every day a great
[30:58] employee today you're discouraged and
[31:00] distraught and you're sat in your face
[31:02] and finally uh nehemiah says all right
[31:04] i'll tell you i just heard my people
[31:06] went down the temple's been rebuilt but
[31:08] the walls that are of protection are
[31:10] torn down and they're just laying in
[31:12] waste and his heart was so grieved over
[31:14] that
[31:15] and so so the king has grace and says
[31:17] you know what take a bunch of people
[31:18] i'll send stuff with you whatever you
[31:20] need
[31:20] go on a mission and go get that wall
[31:23] rebuilt
[31:24] now that was a confirmation
[31:26] that the prophet's word was true
[31:28] that there's going to be a work of
[31:29] restoration a full restoration not a
[31:31] half do a job
[31:33] it's probably why nehemiah was upset
[31:34] because it's not fully restored yet even
[31:36] if the temple is restored the walls of
[31:38] protection weren't up that's right
[31:40] god confirmed that now he's going to
[31:43] finish his work of restoration and tell
[31:44] you i'll tell you brothers and sisters
[31:46] tonight you know this and i believe you
[31:49] can say amen to it god is not going to
[31:51] send a prophet in this age and we all
[31:53] just kind of go off into oblivion and
[31:55] just leaves us all hanging god is going
[31:58] to finish the work in his bride despite
[32:00] what we see despite the divisions
[32:03] god's going to do it because he said he
[32:05] was going to do it amen he's going to
[32:07] have a bride without spot rico and
[32:08] blemish there's going to be unity of
[32:10] faith and there's going to be a rapture
[32:14] because you said it no because i said it
[32:15] no because it's something well we
[32:17] believe it it's going to have no because
[32:18] god said it amen
[32:20] god said it and he spoke it through the
[32:22] mouth of a prophet acts chapter three
[32:24] it's mentioned about three times he
[32:25] spoke things through the mouth of a
[32:27] prophet and so if that's god's word
[32:28] coming through his mouth it's a seed and
[32:30] when the people believe it and it's
[32:32] planted in their hearts by by a vision
[32:33] coming in their hearts they begin to
[32:35] live out the vision for the hour
[32:37] i said they begin to live out the vision
[32:39] for the hour are you living out the
[32:41] vision for the hour are you living some
[32:43] self selfish life i want to live the
[32:46] vision for the hour
[32:47] whatever was spoken i wanted to be see
[32:49] it lived in my life can you raise your
[32:51] hand brothers and sisters
[32:53] i want to see it lived out in my life
[32:55] i'm not on this earth to to do my own
[32:58] thing
[32:59] not even just to enjoy a few
[33:00] entertainments and retire on the beaches
[33:03] of florida somewhere i'm here to first
[33:05] fulfill his purpose
[33:08] god put that in our hearts i mean he put
[33:10] it deeper in my heart and may he put it
[33:12] in your heart so samuel it and tobiah
[33:15] we found out were the influences that
[33:17] were opposed to the rebuilding of
[33:18] jerusalem now why why do you think that
[33:20] is when you look at their names you
[33:23] can't really detect anything wrong with
[33:24] these fellas because samolet means
[33:26] strength tobiah means jehovah is good
[33:30] but the problem was is their origin
[33:32] not their names their names were nice
[33:35] they were
[33:36] nice nice people
[33:40] the problem was was the origins sam
[33:41] bullet came from the moabite
[33:44] moabites
[33:45] children of moabites and
[33:47] tobacco from the ammonites with the
[33:49] children of ammon
[33:51] and if you read your bible you will see
[33:53] that the origin was not good because
[33:55] that's the two sons of incest
[33:58] that lots daughters after his wife
[34:00] turned to a pillar of salt
[34:04] the two daughters had incest and were
[34:06] with their father when he was drunk got
[34:07] him drunk
[34:08] terrible thing
[34:10] and two sons were one of one was ammon
[34:13] and one was
[34:15] uh
[34:17] moab
[34:18] and now they become the children of moab
[34:20] and children of ammon and became a
[34:23] hardship and a bad influence for israel
[34:26] all the way through right under balaam
[34:28] was those children trying to influence
[34:29] them to come come on over and worship
[34:31] with us we're the same we're all this
[34:32] we're all we're all the same balaam's
[34:34] doctrine
[34:35] children the moabites were involved in
[34:36] that and so now you notice how closely
[34:38] linked they are
[34:40] because they have a distant they're a
[34:42] distant relative of abraham
[34:45] they're tied in they're not just out
[34:47] right out here you know just no they're
[34:50] connected by relation to our father
[34:52] abraham that's right
[34:54] but look how it came
[34:56] first of all you have lot which is a
[34:58] nephew of abraham and he made a choice
[35:00] one day with his wife abraham says
[35:02] there's tension in the camp you choose
[35:05] one way and respectfully i'll choose to
[35:07] go the other way let's shake hands and
[35:09] let's do it and and it was that's how it
[35:11] happened and then the bible says lot
[35:13] pitched his tent towards sodom he didn't
[35:15] move to sodom right away we don't know
[35:17] how many years it was but he pitched his
[35:19] tent towards sodom
[35:20] you can tell the direction he's headed
[35:22] yeah that's right amen
[35:24] and so that was a very respectful thing
[35:26] later on abraham out of his love went
[35:28] and delivered a lot when he was in
[35:29] captivity he was still reaching out on
[35:31] his hand and even after that lot stayed
[35:33] in sodom
[35:34] so but notice now when he leaves sodom
[35:36] and it's destroyed lotus this inceptious
[35:39] thing that took place that produced
[35:41] fruit and produced these two boys that
[35:44] became a a problem for israel all the
[35:46] way through of influencing them trying
[35:48] to be the same coming against them
[35:50] threatening them and here's these two
[35:52] boys tobiah and sambalet that come from
[35:54] those tribes doing the very same thing
[35:56] against the true work of the lord amen
[35:59] against the message of the day
[36:03] you say why why were they against it
[36:05] they were probably nice men they had
[36:07] nice names their names meant something
[36:08] nice but their origin began to come out
[36:11] of them that that spirit is always
[36:13] jealous and always against the word for
[36:16] the age
[36:19] and that's who tobiah and samuel it were
[36:22] and i read to you last week i won't read
[36:24] them again because i'm taking up my time
[36:26] here tonight but i read you all the
[36:27] places if you want to read it again
[36:29] uh nehemiah two
[36:30] two places in chapter two
[36:32] uh two places in chapter four and then
[36:34] one place in chapter six one place that
[36:36] says it mocked them one place that says
[36:38] they were wroth with them one place that
[36:40] says it laughed them to scorn when they
[36:42] learned they were going to build on this
[36:44] wall everything they could do and the
[36:45] last thing in chapter six they did they
[36:47] they hired a prophet to prophesy against
[36:49] them right
[36:50] so now you've got all these attributes
[36:52] and their whole agenda we've we
[36:54] we want to stop this work we don't like
[36:56] we we don't it doesn't even say why they
[36:58] don't like it they were just mad
[37:00] they were just jealous they just they
[37:02] just you know they're not going to ever
[37:03] see this happen why do you have to do
[37:05] this and trust me friends these men were
[37:07] worshipers of god
[37:10] they weren't worldly they were
[37:12] worshippers so basically what they were
[37:13] saying is that we're already worshiping
[37:15] god why do we need the temple rebuilt
[37:20] why do we need this message
[37:23] we're already worshipping god come on
[37:25] why did we even need it to come it's not
[37:27] essential to salvation
[37:30] and i've taught you it's not essential
[37:32] for
[37:33] salvation
[37:34] the message is not essential for
[37:35] salvation but it's essential for the
[37:38] last days to bring a bride to perfection
[37:41] else it wouldn't have been in the bible
[37:42] to come
[37:43] and they're saying where worship what do
[37:45] we need a temple for what do we need
[37:46] walls built for this is stupid and they
[37:48] laughed them to score but there was the
[37:49] people who caught a vision saying this
[37:51] is what god said to do amen
[37:53] so my family here
[37:55] you can call us you can laugh us all at
[37:56] us all you want to but we're building on
[37:58] something that god said to you amen
[38:00] and we're right there you're a little
[38:02] two-year-old boy hey get you what's the
[38:03] name of your son there
[38:05] really rolling this right rolling hey
[38:07] rowan you know grab something grab some
[38:09] mortar you know rowan grab some more
[38:11] grab that stone
[38:12] rose you just you know he's picking it
[38:14] up and helping dad bring it up there
[38:17] and place it up there that's good son
[38:18] way to go what are we doing we're
[38:20] building the vision of the lord we're
[38:22] rebuilding god's work
[38:24] the whole family was involved
[38:26] teaching those children from there we're
[38:27] young we're in god's vision here we're
[38:29] doing god's work for this hour but daddy
[38:31] looking over there laughing at us look
[38:33] at samuel over there look at the
[38:34] children of establishment look at tobia
[38:36] laughing at us saying this is important
[38:37] they're worshiping god this is important
[38:39] i know they're laughing at us don't
[38:40] worry about that son this is what god's
[38:41] word said to do amen
[38:43] god says it's important so we say it's
[38:45] as important as a family
[38:47] amen
[38:50] there's even people today laughing at
[38:51] the way i'm preaching right now
[38:54] and calling it cultist
[38:57] because
[38:58] there's just some new theory that i
[39:00] can't draw out of scriptures and then
[39:01] bring this whole presentation to try to
[39:03] get people to follow and listen that's
[39:05] not what i'm doing here tonight the word
[39:06] has discernment for every hour and that
[39:09] shadow of zeb zerubbabel's day is the
[39:11] shadow of our day
[39:14] who said jesus said when he says in the
[39:17] last days i'll send elijah the prophet
[39:19] to restore
[39:21] somebody say it with me restore it's a
[39:24] ministry of restoration amen
[39:26] are we done yet
[39:28] are we done with this ministry is it
[39:30] over
[39:31] no because i'm not missing it
[39:35] that's right amen when i come up missing
[39:38] then it's done
[39:40] when you come up missing then it's done
[39:43] so we're still is everybody still here
[39:44] tonight okay put your hand on put your
[39:46] hand on your wrist everybody
[39:48] check everybody's still living in this
[39:50] earth okay i can see you you haven't
[39:52] raptured yet there's some doctrines of
[39:54] the message think we're already
[39:54] resurrected and already raptured are we
[39:56] resurrected believe it or not
[39:58] it's a wacky stuff
[40:02] and i'm going we're already resurrected
[40:04] raptured in the millennium i said this
[40:06] is it
[40:08] i'm disappointed
[40:12] i mean i gave my whole life for this and
[40:14] this is the millennium
[40:16] we're not there yet this works not over
[40:18] it's not time to give up
[40:21] it's time to keep building on this wall
[40:23] until the wall is completely finished
[40:26] and until uh i'm missing that's that's
[40:28] that's the final thing that i've been
[40:30] restored come to adoption as a son of
[40:32] god there'll be a quick short work of a
[40:34] manifestation through the bride of the
[40:36] of god of a supernatural work in the
[40:38] bride i believe that's supposed to
[40:39] happen not so much to tell the whole
[40:41] world it's not a show to the whole world
[40:43] but to identify there is god's group
[40:45] we'll know within ourselves something
[40:46] happened some of those resurrected
[40:48] saints will be risen from the grave
[40:50] after no doubt an earthquake in
[40:52] california somewhere they're going to
[40:54] raise for 30 to 90 days somewhere in
[40:56] there and some will see those saints
[40:58] raised from the dead they'll see them
[41:00] they'll appear to them and then we'll
[41:01] begin to know now we're on the final
[41:03] stretch
[41:05] it's gonna happen friends it happened
[41:07] before it'll happen again according to
[41:09] god's word now you can go out there and
[41:11] live your own life or you can be sitting
[41:13] right in the vision of god for this hour
[41:15] and saying lord fill me with your spirit
[41:18] lord let me walk with you no matter what
[41:20] you think of yourself just say lord i
[41:22] want to walk with you amen amen i want
[41:24] to walk in i want to be a part of your
[41:26] vision i want my family to be a part of
[41:28] the vision for this hour if i have to
[41:29] stand alone i'll stand alone can i get
[41:31] an amen tonight are you happy tonight
[41:35] praise the lord is is
[41:36] as much good preaching as we get all the
[41:38] time in is we're so blessed with the
[41:41] meat of the word we us preachers could
[41:44] just take 10 minutes and it should be
[41:45] enough to just revive us because we hear
[41:48] so much good food
[41:52] i'll be just it's just ought to bring us
[41:54] to just a rapture friends can you say
[41:56] amen
[41:57] so now this is so now uh
[42:00] the children of i need to get off of
[42:01] them but there's so much could be said
[42:03] there's always something trying to
[42:05] hinder the children of moab and ammon
[42:07] always were right close
[42:10] to the children of israel or trying to
[42:11] get close to agitate
[42:14] to distract
[42:15] and to threaten
[42:17] always
[42:19] i love the attitude of nehemiah
[42:22] this is going to happen boys
[42:24] i love the attitude of nehemiah this is
[42:27] going to happen in chapter 2 and verse
[42:29] 19 when samuelt and tobiah
[42:33] uh heard it they laughed us to scorn and
[42:36] despised us and said what is this thing
[42:38] that ye will do will you rebel against
[42:40] the king verse 20 then i
[42:43] uh nehemiah answered them and said unto
[42:45] them the god of heaven
[42:47] he will prosper us
[42:48] therefore we his servants will arise
[42:52] and build but ye have no portion nor
[42:54] right nor memorial in this jerusalem and
[42:57] you'll find that several times through
[42:58] the book of nehemiah you find nehemiah
[43:00] speaking back to these guys saying
[43:02] listen god will prosper us right god
[43:05] will finish his work and we will finish
[43:08] this wall
[43:10] threaten us all you want to we will
[43:12] finish this wall we're going to do it
[43:13] with one sword in one hand and building
[43:15] in the other hand we're going to do it
[43:17] with guards up we're going to we're
[43:18] going to have our garden so let's get to
[43:19] that part real quick here and so i i
[43:21] love the attitude of nehemiah if you get
[43:23] a chance to read that read it it'll be
[43:24] an encouragement to you
[43:26] so now it's a lesson for us this is a
[43:29] lesson for us for our times in this full
[43:31] restoration of faith and full
[43:33] restoration of families there are people
[43:36] anointed of the enemy to discourage you
[43:43] let's be adults about this let's be
[43:45] mature sons and daughters of god
[43:48] there are influences of people who be
[43:50] it's not the people but they become
[43:52] anointed of the antichrist spirit
[43:55] and the enemy
[43:56] to discourage you in what you believe
[43:59] amen
[44:00] more often now than ever
[44:02] it's right close to us
[44:04] that we are looked down on as being too
[44:06] extreme
[44:08] that we're looked down as being cultish
[44:12] i knew the world made fun of
[44:15] certain things that we believed years
[44:16] ago
[44:17] but now to be made fun of or looked at
[44:20] funny by our own in the message ranks
[44:23] i didn't think that would happen i knew
[44:25] the world made fun of leading our girls
[44:28] to be keepers at home like the bible
[44:30] says and to love their husbands and to
[44:32] obey their husbands
[44:33] but to be looked down on on someone of
[44:36] their own rank sometimes in the message
[44:39] right at teaching them to be keeper at
[44:41] home
[44:42] come on to be looked down on for that
[44:48] i knew
[44:49] that because we don't dance and take a
[44:50] social drink like the world
[44:53] to look like the world i knew if we
[44:55] didn't do that i knew we would look
[44:57] weird to our business associates and i
[44:59] knew we'd look weird to the world you
[45:00] don't dance a little bit what's wrong
[45:02] with dancing you don't take a little
[45:03] social drink at the office or the office
[45:05] party every now and then what's the
[45:07] problem with that don't you know they
[45:08] drunk wine in the bible
[45:12] same story
[45:15] i knew that i would look weird to the
[45:17] world i know i'm going to get
[45:19] persecution for that
[45:21] but now when you stand and you receive a
[45:24] little bit of funny look or put down on
[45:28] but some who supposedly be the believe
[45:30] the message
[45:32] things have changed it's true that's
[45:35] right
[45:35] people have changed
[45:38] but i want to say it's still wrong
[45:40] because of what it represents can you
[45:41] say man
[45:43] but to be told that it's too strict by
[45:45] someone
[45:47] who's following the word supposedly
[45:48] that's way too strict you don't do that
[45:50] i can dance at my wedding i can drink at
[45:52] my wedding i can have these things that
[45:54] has nothing to do with being a christian
[45:57] but friends these are the times that we
[45:59] live in
[46:01] these are the time i'm not here to talk
[46:03] to the nominal world i'm not here to
[46:04] talk to denominationals tonight
[46:06] everybody's believers here so i can be
[46:08] at liberty to say to you i never would
[46:10] have dreamed we'd come to these things
[46:11] and those are listening on the internet
[46:13] i never would but we're here now
[46:15] and the squeeze is ending up being a
[46:17] little bit different than what we
[46:18] thought that's the truth amen come in
[46:20] come on
[46:22] i'm not i don't have anybody in mind
[46:24] right now so don't think that i'm trying
[46:26] to preach on anybody particular if i did
[46:28] that i wouldn't be right i'm just trying
[46:30] to say it's real it's here and it's
[46:34] so why is he saying have your sword up
[46:36] while you're building and while you're
[46:38] growing in the lord have your sword
[46:39] handy have your guard handy because
[46:42] we're living in the times that these
[46:44] influences are trying to discourage you
[46:48] so the sword is used for cutting the
[46:50] sword is not used for patting somebody
[46:52] on the back
[46:54] the sword is used for cutting away
[46:55] unbelief
[46:57] but the ramp says you can have the sword
[46:58] but it takes a strong hand of faith to
[47:00] drive it to the heart of the enemy and
[47:01] he says it's used to cut the unbelief
[47:03] out so you can get to the promises of
[47:04] god there are unbelieving spirits that's
[47:07] in between you and the promise of god
[47:09] and you use the sword to cut that back
[47:10] so you can get to your promises
[47:12] that's what the sword is for so when
[47:14] those unbelieving things come up and say
[47:16] the days of miracles has passed we don't
[47:18] believe that anymore there's no more
[47:20] prophets passed uh past the book of
[47:22] revelations past john and those
[47:23] unbelieving spirits start to bring all
[47:25] this we cut that back and say that's no
[47:27] that's disbelief
[47:29] amen we've got to believe god's word if
[47:31] we're going to see results
[47:34] praise the lord
[47:37] amen
[47:39] as brother doug said
[47:41] the satan's guns are trained i want to
[47:43] refer you to revelations chapter 9
[47:47] and just hold your hand in nehemiah
[47:49] revelations 9 and verse
[47:52] the reason i'm taking time to qualify
[47:53] this is we assume sometimes everybody
[47:56] just
[47:56] understands these things when the
[47:58] prophet said there's two hundred
[47:59] thousand thousand two million
[48:02] religious devils trained against the
[48:03] bride where's that in the bible
[48:07] revelations 9 preachers refer to it
[48:09] brother doug did
[48:11] revelations 9 and verse 14 says and this
[48:14] is under the sixth trumpet
[48:16] verse 13
[48:18] uh and the sixth angel sounded and i
[48:20] heard the voice from the four horns of
[48:21] the golden altar which is before god
[48:23] saying to the sixth angel which had the
[48:24] trumpet loose the four angels which are
[48:27] bound in the
[48:28] great river euphrates and the four
[48:30] angels were loose which were prepared
[48:32] for an hour and a day and a month and a
[48:34] year for to slay the third part of men
[48:37] and the number of the army of the
[48:39] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[48:42] thousand so that's two million and i
[48:44] heard the number of them and thus i saw
[48:46] the horses in the vision and then that
[48:49] sat on them having breastplates of fire
[48:52] and of jason and brimstone and the heads
[48:55] of the horses were as heads of lions and
[48:57] out of their mouth issues fire
[48:59] and smoke and brimstone so now
[49:02] this is all symbolism of course
[49:04] but if we have it under the sixth
[49:05] trumpet we have it during the time now
[49:08] that there's a persecution coming on
[49:10] god's people naturally the jews
[49:12] right
[49:13] so no on the natural side of these
[49:15] devils
[49:17] who were so cruel and remember their
[49:19] horses that's why we know their their
[49:21] their their powers because of horses
[49:23] power right
[49:24] horsepower
[49:26] got it
[49:27] all right
[49:28] so now 200 000 000
[49:31] spiritual demons
[49:33] on the natural begin to raise up during
[49:35] the time of hitler mussolini stalin and
[49:38] begin to bring this cruel persecution
[49:41] against who
[49:43] god's chosen people in the natural
[49:45] there it is right there in the bible and
[49:47] it's under the sixth trumpet because the
[49:49] trumpets are all to israel the seals are
[49:51] to the bride the trumpets are to israel
[49:54] and so now the revelation of all that
[49:56] happened with the jews the majority of
[49:57] it is two
[49:59] it's for the jews it comes out of the
[50:00] trumpets and so you have the trumpets
[50:02] you get to the last one the sixth and
[50:03] the seventh then you have something
[50:05] significant coming for our day because
[50:07] things are wrapping up so under the
[50:08] sixth trumpet is when these demons are
[50:10] released lose from the river euphrates
[50:12] and come against the jews what the
[50:15] prophet taught us though is if we're
[50:16] getting close to the end under the sixth
[50:18] and seventh seal then we realize there
[50:20] is an ecclesiastical religious or
[50:23] spiritual side of the natural cruelty
[50:26] that came against those jews to go
[50:28] against the other people of god the
[50:30] bride of jesus christ
[50:33] so that's when he says 200 000 000
[50:36] religious
[50:37] ecclesiastical death devils released at
[50:40] the evening time on
[50:42] not the church
[50:45] but the bride
[50:48] that's right
[50:49] that be you
[50:54] now go back and read the cruelty on
[50:56] god's people
[50:57] right things you can't even talk about
[50:59] hardly
[51:00] the cruelty what did it wasn't hitler it
[51:02] was the anointing he was under
[51:05] these 200 000
[51:06] look at the cruelty relentless
[51:09] persecuting
[51:10] killing
[51:11] but now on the spiritual ecclesiastical
[51:13] side has a religious side to it to bring
[51:15] persecution against the true believers
[51:18] who believe all of the word of god
[51:20] not just a portion
[51:22] and i want to remind you of something
[51:24] awesome brother doug brought up in the
[51:26] numbers being the engineer that he is or
[51:28] was
[51:30] seven
[51:31] billion people on the face of the earth
[51:34] and one in a million would be seven
[51:36] thousand
[51:37] if that's true we're not making this a
[51:39] doctrine by the way but i thought it was
[51:41] real good if you divide all that up if
[51:43] there's seven billion people and there's
[51:44] seven thousand of the true believers
[51:46] 200 million demons released on the true
[51:49] believers you split them up and you have
[51:52] 28 000 demons per person of the seven
[51:55] thousand
[51:58] no wonder you're having a hard time
[52:01] that's right
[52:03] that's each of you individually if
[52:05] they're divided up like that we don't
[52:06] know that i'm not preaching a doctor
[52:08] here tonight but if they were to divide
[52:09] into each person and there was seven
[52:11] thousand believers on the face of the
[52:12] earth true believers spirit-filled
[52:14] believers then 28 000 per person
[52:17] would come upon each vision i don't know
[52:19] if you caught that when brother doug
[52:20] said that but you see what you're
[52:22] dealing with no matter
[52:24] no it's no wonder it's what i want to
[52:25] say no wonder no wonder it's so hard to
[52:29] live a christian walk in this day come
[52:31] on yes sir
[52:33] no wonder you ought to you know you
[52:35] ought to say amen to this because no
[52:37] wonder you give one small effort to get
[52:40] close to god and it's so
[52:42] fought against by the devil in two or
[52:44] three days sometimes you can have a
[52:46] setback in my i said here i am given an
[52:48] effort and i have such a setback
[52:50] it's because there's a hindrance there's
[52:53] a spirit there's a force against you
[52:56] being spirit-filled young girl there's a
[52:58] force against you being spirit-filled
[53:00] that's what god wants for you and that's
[53:02] what you desire but get ready because
[53:05] there's a force against it
[53:07] young men the same way
[53:08] older men the same way older women the
[53:10] same way married couples 50 years old 60
[53:13] years old the same way no wonder when we
[53:15] make a stride towards spiritual things
[53:18] something hits us
[53:20] something hinders us
[53:22] somebody persecutes you somebody says
[53:24] something say something happens to
[53:27] discourage us
[53:29] just simple discouragement
[53:32] the devil says
[53:33] that's enough
[53:35] that's all i had to use on them
[53:37] is discouragement
[53:39] they're easy
[53:41] i'm not threatening to cut their head
[53:42] off
[53:44] like they're believer friends come on
[53:46] preach it did you just love when brother
[53:48] doug says oh yeah i know why you're
[53:49] discouraged yeah you got eternal life
[53:51] and
[53:52] yeah i can see you
[53:54] got these blessings you got the promises
[53:56] of god a little sarcasm there but you
[53:58] know what it's true
[54:00] we don't really have it as bad as we
[54:01] make it all to be
[54:04] but we have the power and we do have
[54:06] forces against this we just have to be
[54:08] recognizing it
[54:11] we have to be as these men that nehemiah
[54:13] instructed
[54:14] with our swords in our hand
[54:17] to cut back that unbelief
[54:20] and continue working on the wall
[54:23] praise the lord so no wonder the battle
[54:25] so hard so cool i could go on and preach
[54:27] more and more about that
[54:29] no wonder when we make a step no wonder
[54:31] a young person gets discouraged they get
[54:33] a bad thought
[54:34] they lean towards the wrong thing just a
[54:36] little bit and they just the devil beats
[54:38] them up over it
[54:40] don't be discouraged my friend
[54:42] don't be discouraged young girl
[54:45] god is looking at your desires
[54:48] can i get an amen
[54:50] every one of you god's looking at her
[54:51] desires
[54:53] he's not looking at you he's looking at
[54:54] your desires
[54:56] and there if the deep's calling to the
[54:58] deep there's a deep to respond god
[55:00] desires his promises for you you desire
[55:02] them on the inside whatever's in between
[55:05] you're going to have to crash through
[55:06] that with the sword you're going to cut
[55:07] through it
[55:08] you're going to have to get bold in your
[55:10] faith that's right get up in the morning
[55:11] realize that's where's my 28 thousand
[55:14] i'm ready for you come on can you say
[55:16] man you're gonna have to be bolder
[55:18] you're going to be
[55:19] be rougher with the enemy that's right
[55:21] no doubt about it
[55:22] or he'll just he'll just beat you up
[55:24] he'll just discourage you he'll use
[55:26] someone else to discourage you
[55:27] that's why a lot of people are giving up
[55:29] that's why people giving up
[55:31] you know i've tried this and
[55:33] you know what i've seen so much and now
[55:34] they're going to judge the message
[55:36] by
[55:37] all the things they've seen all their
[55:38] life in the message come on throw the
[55:40] baby out with the bath water that's
[55:41] right
[55:42] it's true i'm through with this thing
[55:44] i've seen it i'm through with the people
[55:46] and that's it
[55:47] we're not coming to this because of the
[55:49] people
[55:52] i'm done with it you know
[55:53] this is it they get so discouraged
[55:56] and they allow the discouragement to
[55:57] take him too far
[56:00] to throw out the good things of god that
[56:01] god's done in their lives
[56:04] amen
[56:08] praise the lord so their leader has set
[56:10] them up to live every day
[56:14] to live every day together as a family
[56:17] building
[56:19] and guarding
[56:21] friends don't stop building
[56:23] don't stop teaching your children don't
[56:25] stop teaching fathers don't stop
[56:27] cheating teaching your children don't
[56:30] let that fall i can always sense it in
[56:32] my home and actually we're there right
[56:33] now i'm just being honest with you i
[56:35] always sense that when we go too far
[56:36] without meeting together for prayer
[56:38] three or four days and i can always see
[56:41] the change that comes in the home
[56:43] don't stop doing it
[56:46] keep working against this
[56:47] this
[56:49] time we live in
[56:51] do the things even if it's painful even
[56:52] if don't feel like doing it even if
[56:54] you're tired sometimes you gotta do it
[56:55] when you're tired
[56:56] don't stop building for the kingdom of
[56:58] god
[56:59] don't stop that keep it going but have
[57:01] your swords very close to you and ready
[57:04] to use can you say amen for cutting away
[57:07] the unbelief
[57:08] uh and say i don't want to be rough here
[57:11] but if the enemy comes too close with
[57:13] his ideas
[57:14] i can get rough that's that's the that's
[57:16] what you want to say to the devil
[57:19] i got my sword here
[57:21] i don't want to get rough remember the
[57:22] swords isn't to use on one another by
[57:23] the way
[57:33] cutting people up on the internet just
[57:34] slicing people with the message you know
[57:36] i want to say this i think i'm bearing
[57:39] the blunt lately
[57:41] of a bunch of stuff that's happened on
[57:43] the internet the last two years and i'm
[57:44] getting labeled under a certain label
[57:48] people that act extreme and act
[57:51] unchrist-like and
[57:52] are sometimes a bad representation of
[57:55] this message
[57:56] and using the sword to cut everybody up
[57:58] come on we're not supposed to use it on
[58:00] one another let's use it on the devil
[58:02] amen
[58:03] i feel like i'm bearing the blood of
[58:04] some things but i don't like to be put
[58:06] into those classes but still you want to
[58:08] say to the devil i don't want to be
[58:10] rough here but i can be rough devil
[58:13] that's right that's why i think laying
[58:15] your store there and having it near and
[58:17] working in the kingdom of god i think
[58:19] that's what that says it said i don't
[58:20] want to be rough but if i have to come
[58:22] on
[58:24] good can you live a christian walk like
[58:26] this young people
[58:28] can you say that to the devil
[58:31] i don't want to be rough but i can get
[58:33] rough
[58:35] i have the soul of the world of the word
[58:36] i can do it amen
[58:38] that's what it's teaching us here
[58:41] the sword's for cutting
[58:43] and so i don't want to be rough but if
[58:44] the enemy comes too close with his ideas
[58:47] i can get rough i don't just use my
[58:50] sword just to use it but i will use it
[58:52] if i have to
[58:54] you know you brother some of you are
[58:55] carrying your guns now
[59:00] and you have to have a lot of wisdom to
[59:01] carry that gun you don't just use it for
[59:03] every little thing
[59:07] right
[59:08] but a lot of you carrying them now you
[59:10] know that's fine and i'm not against
[59:11] that in the the world we live in or
[59:12] whatever that's fine some of them are
[59:14] bringing them into church
[59:16] i probably shouldn't have said that now
[59:17] it's going to make everybody nervous but
[59:19] you know that's fine you know i i don't
[59:21] have one right now anyway but you know i
[59:24] that that's fine but you know what
[59:26] hopefully you have the wisdom because
[59:27] you know what you have it there in case
[59:29] you have to use it right for protection
[59:32] right
[59:33] just in case you don't have it there
[59:35] just so you can flash it around
[59:36] everybody
[59:39] the guy's in front of you in the lane
[59:44] you just
[59:45] wave it out the window say i'm merging
[59:49] no
[59:50] that's not what that's for
[59:54] or to make somebody dance and get them
[59:56] out of the room and just shoot around
[59:57] their feet that's that's showing off
[1:00:01] but there is something you said to be
[1:00:03] said about this whole picture of they
[1:00:05] had their swords there they had their
[1:00:06] swords they were girded with their
[1:00:08] swords they were ready
[1:00:10] because of the threat of the enemy
[1:00:13] and if unbelief tries to come and
[1:00:14] threaten they were ready to cut against
[1:00:16] it
[1:00:17] that's the way you have to live in these
[1:00:20] times as a christian
[1:00:23] that's the way you have to be
[1:00:26] to cut through people people sometimes
[1:00:28] are not willing to use the word to cut
[1:00:30] through ideas of unbelief and poison
[1:00:32] that's trying to poison the minds of the
[1:00:34] people they want to be nice all the time
[1:00:37] but we do we're not nice to unbelieving
[1:00:38] devils
[1:00:40] we have to use the word against them
[1:00:42] amen because they'll poison us so catch
[1:00:44] a glance at his family as i'm trying to
[1:00:45] bring it to a close as brother doug

[1:01:06] with the stones god's given us and on
[1:01:08] the other side guarding all the time
[1:01:11] guarding all the time right you can't

[1:03:53] against all the things that you've
[1:03:55] learned all of your life
[1:03:56] that are true
[1:03:58] you didn't learn everything right but
[1:04:00] you learned some things that were true
[1:04:05] beware the spirits that make you
[1:04:06] question all of that that's true
[1:04:09] beware of it this i'm trying to give you
[1:04:10] i get down to the end of these i try to
[1:04:12] give practical advice
[1:04:13] there's terrorists spirits against your
[1:04:16] kids against your families
[1:04:18] there's lesbian spirits
[1:04:23] that come in every sort of way and
[1:04:26] attack a girl that's discouraged attack
[1:04:28] a girl that for all sorts of reasons in
[1:04:30] her minds you don't tell if you if you
[1:04:32] don't know i'll let you know not my kids
[1:04:35] not not my girls listen
[1:04:37] you better have your sword
[1:04:38] ready because then it can come through
[1:04:41] anything and now someone's as vulnerable
[1:04:43] to some insecurity they feel
[1:04:46] homosexual community and those spirits
[1:04:48] and the lesbian community is not happy
[1:04:50] to stay amongst itself
[1:04:51] and that's in the bible when it knocked
[1:04:53] on the door of lot asking for those men
[1:04:56] wanting their daughters couldn't give
[1:04:57] the dollar so they asked her for the men
[1:04:58] not offered his daughters to them so he
[1:05:00] wouldn't take these angels it's not good
[1:05:02] enough to stay in their little club
[1:05:04] in sodom it was knocking on the door of
[1:05:07] a righteous man
[1:05:09] who his soul was vexed daily
[1:05:11] knocking knocking until the bow says
[1:05:13] they were crashing the door down
[1:05:16] wake up that's our day we live in sodom
[1:05:19] and these spirits take a young mind of a
[1:05:21] young girl a young guy and start to
[1:05:23] confuse their minds
[1:05:24] and that's why we be a strength to them
[1:05:26] with the sword of god and cut that
[1:05:28] unbelieving thing or that movie that's
[1:05:30] bringing in whatever it is we don't mess
[1:05:32] around with these
[1:05:34] spirits don't think this is happening in
[1:05:36] the message
[1:05:38] girls pastor's daughter turned into
[1:05:40] lesbianism that's right
[1:05:42] i don't i don't like to share that stuff
[1:05:44] but i'm telling you we're living in real
[1:05:46] time right and i'm not here to scare you
[1:05:48] i'm here to say we've got a sword to put
[1:05:50] up we've got a sword to guard against
[1:05:52] these things and we better do it
[1:05:54] because it's at the door
[1:05:56] many times these things are real and
[1:05:59] there's dividing spirits as well that
[1:06:01] we're fighting
[1:06:02] against against kids coming against
[1:06:05] marriage come against your mind right
[1:06:09] dividing spirits to come against the
[1:06:11] church and to divide the church
[1:06:13] divide families
[1:06:15] god help us
[1:06:17] may we all have the love of god in our
[1:06:19] hearts tonight to override these
[1:06:21] dividing spirits
[1:06:22] and say lord help me to love anyway
[1:06:25] may just be in agreement that loves the
[1:06:27] answer many times to killing demon
[1:06:29] spirits loves the
[1:06:30] answer because the part of that sword is
[1:06:32] the sword of the spirit and in that
[1:06:34] spirit is the love of god
[1:06:36] you give enough love something of the
[1:06:37] true genuine love of god demons start to
[1:06:39] run away
[1:06:41] lord help us to love one another help us
[1:06:43] to pull together help us not to separate
[1:06:47] through the true love of god would you
[1:06:49] read one scripture with me about that
[1:06:50] romans 16 verse 17 i'm closing on this
[1:06:52] one i'm pulling off
[1:06:58] i've been reading this scripture quite a
[1:07:00] bit
[1:07:00] uh
[1:07:02] but it says here in romans i pray this
[1:07:04] as an encouragement to you tonight
[1:07:09] but we have terrorist spirits
[1:07:11] and today they sneak in so ugly they're
[1:07:13] not ugly
[1:07:15] looking but they sneak in sometimes
[1:07:17] among us they never look destructive you
[1:07:19] know the islam religion the extreme
[1:07:21] islam religion you know they strap bombs
[1:07:24] to a people they strap bombs to a woman
[1:07:26] strap bombs to a man they think they're
[1:07:28] going to get rewards in heaven for doing
[1:07:29] this
[1:07:30] but that's
[1:07:32] characteristic of a terrorist spirit
[1:07:34] look how they're doing it it reflects
[1:07:36] the demonic realm that comes against you
[1:07:38] right it goes into the grocery store it
[1:07:40] goes into a coffee shop
[1:07:42] and it looks like everybody else it's
[1:07:44] being friendly it's talking and all the
[1:07:47] while it's got a bomb on it to just
[1:07:49] in cruelty destroy all kinds of children
[1:07:51] and men and women that's right that's
[1:07:54] how the devil works especially in this
[1:07:56] hour amen
[1:07:58] be ever so nice ever so but but be
[1:08:00] careful friends in the hour we live in
[1:08:02] that there's not a something there to
[1:08:05] try to destroy and discourage you it
[1:08:07] says in romans 16 17 and now i beseech
[1:08:10] you brother and it's an urgency i
[1:08:12] beseech you
[1:08:13] mark them which cause divisions and
[1:08:15] offenses
[1:08:17] contrary
[1:08:19] to the doctrine which she have learned
[1:08:24] to the doctrine that you've learned if
[1:08:26] it's true doctrine you've learned even
[1:08:27] if you grew up in it if it's true
[1:08:30] mark them that cause divisions and
[1:08:32] confusion to try to get you away from
[1:08:34] that that's right amen
[1:08:36] mark them and avoid them
[1:08:40] mature uh immature sons of god don't
[1:08:42] like to read the scriptures on avoiding
[1:08:44] people
[1:08:45] but mature sons realize it's it's in the
[1:08:47] scripture and sometimes it's required
[1:08:49] right
[1:08:50] they're causing divisions contrary to
[1:08:52] the doctrines you've learned avoid them
[1:08:53] for they that are such serve not our
[1:08:55] lord jesus christ but their own belly in
[1:08:58] other words their own
[1:08:59] um agenda their own
[1:09:02] their own self they serve themselves
[1:09:04] and by good words
[1:09:08] and fair speeches
[1:09:11] deceive
[1:09:12] the hearts
[1:09:13] of the simple it's true
[1:09:16] how'd they do it
[1:09:18] how did you see the hearts of the simple
[1:09:19] by good words
[1:09:21] by fair speeches
[1:09:23] but by things that sound so good right
[1:09:27] and you need to be in the word yourself
[1:09:30] and check it out
[1:09:33] because on the front of the surface it's
[1:09:34] good words and fair speeches and so nice
[1:09:37] and it can be an agenda to discourage
[1:09:40] you
[1:09:41] that's what the bible says
[1:09:44] there is security for families
[1:09:47] in someone
[1:09:48] who's willing to stand
[1:09:51] on the same things for the long haul
[1:09:54] and be consistent not trying to change
[1:09:56] things after a certain time
[1:09:59] if something has been established as
[1:10:01] truth beware of new ideas
[1:10:03] trying to modernize things
[1:10:07] i'm giving instruction as a pastor
[1:10:08] tonight all right
[1:10:10] i'm being really down to earth and i'm
[1:10:11] getting ready to close but what i'm
[1:10:13] saying here
[1:10:14] i wish i could articulate it better i
[1:10:16] wish i was an orator i'm not
[1:10:18] but what i'm saying is is so important
[1:10:21] and i say it to you as a pastor what i'm
[1:10:23] saying is instruction
[1:10:24] and admonition
[1:10:26] and encouragement to you these things
[1:10:28] are real this is how you need to live in
[1:10:30] this hour
[1:10:33] i'm not playing games but when someone
[1:10:35] stands for something for the long haul
[1:10:37] and it's a clear stand that brings
[1:10:38] security to families you know how many
[1:10:40] people have come to me and said through
[1:10:42] these turbulent times
[1:10:45] thanks for staying consistent thanks for
[1:10:46] saying it like it is right young girl
[1:10:49] says
[1:10:49] i'm sitting there and i'm i'm
[1:10:52] wearing the wrong things and i've got
[1:10:54] you know caked on makeup and all these
[1:10:56] other things and she's the one that
[1:10:58] comes and says
[1:10:59] i went back and listened to your service
[1:11:01] on modesty
[1:11:02] i went back and listened to things and
[1:11:03] every once in a while you hang on
[1:11:04] brother paul don't stop hitting on it
[1:11:06] stay consistent keep saying it like it
[1:11:09] should be said
[1:11:14] i don't always listen to the ones who
[1:11:16] are complimenting me
[1:11:18] i take the constructive criticism too
[1:11:20] and i get it
[1:11:24] but security comes when fathers and
[1:11:27] pastors and leaders
[1:11:29] like nehemiah
[1:11:31] are consistent
[1:11:32] we believe the word amen
[1:11:35] and 20 years later we believe the same
[1:11:37] thing
[1:11:38] nothing's changed here
[1:11:41] security comes not trying to change
[1:11:43] things beware of new ideas
[1:11:45] trying to modernize things as nehemiah
[1:11:48] did this i believe it created unity not
[1:11:50] fear
[1:11:51] creating unity security and happiness
[1:11:54] happiness can i end on that
[1:11:56] what he did for the people created unity
[1:11:59] it created security it created happiness
[1:12:01] when you have caught god's vision it's
[1:12:03] not bondage it's not fear it's joy
[1:12:07] no greater joy than to see my children
[1:12:08] walk in truth it's seeing families in
[1:12:10] order in this hour walking in the vision
[1:12:12] and working on this wall and that brings
[1:12:15] happiness it brings joy it brings
[1:12:17] security because we are little creators
[1:12:19] can you say amen
[1:12:22] we are little creators and when a man or
[1:12:25] a pastor
[1:12:26] or a woman who's kind of the manager of
[1:12:28] the home
[1:12:29] when she
[1:12:31] brings consistency and she's consistent
[1:12:33] what she believes
[1:12:35] and she has a creative power to create
[1:12:38] security in her kids
[1:12:42] fathers have creative power to create
[1:12:44] security in their families
[1:12:46] where's our security today
[1:12:47] that we have an unchanging
[1:12:51] psalm says meddle not with them that are
[1:12:53] given to change
[1:12:56] don't fellowship much with people that
[1:12:57] are given to change
[1:13:00] this word is unchanging
[1:13:02] we need we need to live as a people
[1:13:04] that's unchanging that's right
[1:13:06] and that's where you find families happy
[1:13:08] and secure and
[1:13:10] and uh
[1:13:11] imagine those little kids there just
[1:13:12] around working around mom and dad on
[1:13:15] that wall and just
[1:13:18] realizing it's god's vision daddy's
[1:13:19] happy dad's working there and
[1:13:23] mom's working with them and then she
[1:13:25] cooks them a little meal there
[1:13:27] those kids working with daddy and
[1:13:28] getting in there
[1:13:30] once they catch that principle this is
[1:13:31] this is the work of the lord
[1:13:33] didn't bring bondage you brought
[1:13:35] happiness
[1:13:36] you're part of something
[1:13:39] noah's sons being young he preached it
[1:13:41] for 120 years so they had to be pretty
[1:13:43] young when they started helping their
[1:13:44] dad with the ark right
[1:13:46] this is god's vision for the our sons
[1:13:48] amen and we're part of this vision
[1:13:51] let them laugh you to score in this
[1:13:52] god's vision for the act amen that's
[1:13:54] what we do that's the way to raise a
[1:13:56] family
[1:13:57] can you say amen
[1:13:58] and by the way someone said a note
[1:14:00] haberdeon's
[1:14:02] habergeons
[1:14:04] is that what it said swords spears and
[1:14:07] hammer geons is that how i say it too
[1:14:10] nobody knows tonight
[1:14:11] it means armor
[1:14:14] it means armor
[1:14:16] so have your sp sear your sears
[1:14:20] don't have your sears card
[1:14:22] have your spears have your swords
[1:14:25] have your armor have it ready
[1:14:28] can you say amen
[1:14:29] let's stand together god bless you
[1:14:32] hope you
[1:14:33] learned something tonight
[1:14:35] take it home with you pray about it
[1:14:39] and uh
[1:14:44] not something we come up with on our own
[1:14:45] that something that's a blessing from
[1:14:47] the scripture for us
[1:14:49] heavenly father i want to pray lord
[1:14:52] tonight and ask you to bless the
[1:14:53] families of the church

[1:15:16] embrace all those and if someone don't
[1:15:17] feel like they have a family they do

[1:15:22] the sons and daughters of god the
[1:15:23] fathers within the body of christ to be
[1:15:25] a blessing to be an encouragement
[1:15:28] and so lord i pray you but whatever

[1:15:50] the church and fall on the people and
[1:15:53] lord as the coming days come may there
