[18:18] Oh my soul,

[18:26] Thank you Jesus for the blood
[18:32] of blood.
[18:35] Thank you Jesus. You have washed mine.
[18:43] Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life.
[18:51] brought me from the darkness into
[18:55] glorious
[18:57] light. You thank him tonight. Oh,
[19:01] thank you Jesus for the blood
[19:06] applied.
[19:09] Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white.
[19:16] Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[19:22] life.
[19:24] Brought me from the darkness into
[19:28] glorious
[19:30] life.
[19:32] Try to sing these verses. I was a
[19:36] wretch. I remember who I was.
[19:41] I was lost. I was blind. I was running
[19:46] out of time.
[19:49] Oh, sin
[19:51] separated.
[19:53] The breach was far too high.
[19:57] But from the far side of the chasm, you
[20:01] held me in your side. So you made a way
[20:09] across the great divide. Hallelujah.
[20:12] left behind
[20:14] heaven's throne

[21:31] life.
[21:33] Brought me from the darkness into
[21:37] glorious
[21:39] light.
[21:41] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[21:43] praise tonight. Thank you, Lord.
[21:47] Praise the Lord. And appreciate those
[21:49] inspired songs of the Lord. I believe it
[21:52] was um Charity Gale that wrote that one.
[21:55] And we met her, Sherry, years ago when
[21:57] we were singing there at the tent at
[21:59] Bill Gaither's tent. And she is just
[22:01] starting out, apostolic girl. Now she's
[22:03] real popular, but she's held her
[22:06] standard. And uh but talk about some
[22:08] anointed songs. Amen. It's just
[22:10] wonderful. Thank God for that. Praise
[22:12] the Lord. God bless you tonight. It's
[22:13] good to be in fellowship with you and to
[22:15] have us joining together here. If you're
[22:17] online, it's always good just to see one
[22:20] another and encourage one another. Uh,
[22:22] and we appreciate you coming out showing
[22:24] your hunger for the word of God tonight.
[22:26] And we just want to turn together if you
[22:28] would to first Peter chapter 5. 1 Peter
[22:31] chapter 5. And then we'll read one place
[22:33] also in the Old Testament in Jeremiah. 1
[22:36] Peter chapter 5.
[22:40] Once again, God bless you all in
[22:42] Christian love tonight. We appreciate
[22:44] the body of Christ and the people that
[22:48] can come together and pray when there's
[22:50] needs. ask you to remember all the
[22:51] requests tonight. I know um brother Ryan
[22:55] and sister Haley are sick tonight. So
[22:57] just lift them up a prayer as well if
[22:59] you could do that. 1 Peter chapter 5
[23:02] and verse 7. Casting all your care upon
[23:08] him for he carth for you. And then if
[23:12] you'd go back to Jeremiah chapter 2, I
[23:15] wanted to add this in because it'll be
[23:16] related also to the subject tonight as
[23:18] we continue our study uh out of he cares
[23:22] do you care. So Jeremiah
[23:25] chapter 2 and I think we'll just read
[23:27] one verse there as well.
[23:30] Jeremiah chapter 2 verse 13 I believe it
[23:34] is.
[23:36] For my people have committed two evils.
[23:39] They have forsaken me the fountain of
[23:41] living waters and hewed them outistns,
[23:45] broken sistns that can hold no water. So
[23:49] God uh discerns the nature of his
[23:52] people, but it's kind of like a na the
[23:55] nature of a human being as well is that
[23:58] we never stay neutral. If we forsake
[24:01] God's answer to something, we always
[24:03] seek out our own answers. And if we
[24:06] refuse the refreshment of his living
[24:08] water, then here it says we'll we'll
[24:11] carve out for ourselves or make to
[24:13] ourselves places we can drink from. But
[24:15] they're not they won't hold water.
[24:17] They're they they bring emptiness. They
[24:19] won't satisfy. So it's not in our nature
[24:21] to stay neutral. If there's a hunger, if
[24:23] there's a need, if there's something
[24:25] that we need and we're not going to God
[24:28] for it, we will go to another source.
[24:30] It's just just the way we're made. And
[24:32] we're going to find out tonight why we
[24:34] do that and that we don't need to do
[24:36] that. We don't need to turn to any other
[24:38] source but the Lord as far as his
[24:40] fountain. How many believe that there is
[24:42] a fountain open in the house of David in
[24:44] the last days for people to come and
[24:46] drink from? There's a fountain opened
[24:48] and God opened it to us when he opened
[24:50] the seals. Uh you can just say he opened
[24:53] up a a rush of his fresh water again
[24:56] from Calvary. And uh boy, it's a
[24:58] wonderful thing. So we learn that that
[25:00] the human nature is to do that. but also
[25:02] God is displeased because he's given the
[25:04] fountain and his people keep going to
[25:06] other things. So, we want to talk a
[25:08] little bit about that tonight. Father,
[25:09] help us and strengthen us and anoint us,
[25:12] Lord. Anoint the people's faith tonight
[25:14] to rise, Lord, to uh Lord, the hour that
[25:16] we live in, the time we live in. Give us
[25:18] grace, give us teaching from your throne
[25:21] that we can learn of you. We pray in
[25:23] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you all.
[25:29] It's kind of been a huge pause since uh
[25:33] I did the last study on He Cares, Do You
[25:36] Care? And uh some of that pause and I'm
[25:39] jumping back into it tonight. Some of
[25:41] that pause as I let some of the local
[25:43] ministers and we have several ministers
[25:44] from overseas. So, it's been a while
[25:46] since I've taken a Wednesday night. So,
[25:48] we put a little pause on the study, but
[25:50] we want to pick it up again tonight and
[25:53] uh studying this book. I'm encouraging
[25:54] you to get that sermon and listen
[25:56] through it while we're studying this. He
[25:58] cares. Do you care? If you can get that
[26:00] on the table app or however you can get
[26:02] it, download it, listen to it, or read
[26:05] it, it would be good because we're
[26:06] finding some really good things in here.
[26:09] And because we've it's been a little
[26:10] while since we talked about uh this and
[26:13] the reasons why I got into it. I have to
[26:15] just refresh our hearts a little bit and
[26:18] give a summary a little bit as to why
[26:20] we're studying this message, why we're
[26:22] looking it over. And uh it's the message
[26:24] he cares, do you care? And and we we
[26:26] found if you just allow me to go back
[26:28] and just in case we forgot some things
[26:31] knowing that principle that we tend to
[26:33] forget a lot more than what we remember.
[26:36] Maybe that's just me at 59. I don't
[26:38] know. But uh people uh tend to not
[26:41] retain things for a while unless it's a
[26:43] revelation. If God drops a revelation in
[26:45] your heart, that's altogether a
[26:47] different story. But just to uh bring
[26:49] you back into remembrance of things as
[26:51] uh the Bible says to do so that we can
[26:54] come back to why I'm taking this. He
[26:56] cares. Do you care is more than a
[26:59] sermon. He cares. Do you cares more than
[27:01] a sermon? It's it's an unveiling of a
[27:04] powerful principle
[27:06] uh in connecting a supernatural God with
[27:11] the people in order to get supernatural
[27:14] results. And I really believe that it's
[27:16] a principle laid out to us by God's
[27:19] prophet. He cares. Do you care? And if
[27:21] you just look at the title, you can
[27:23] understand it's it's giving us a
[27:25] principle. And that is it's real simple
[27:26] to catch. Uh he God cares about every
[27:30] need. God cares about every detail. God
[27:33] cares what you're going through. God
[27:35] cares about your family situation. And
[27:37] even in me saying that, let's not that
[27:39] ever let that become common to us. Can
[27:42] you say amen? That might be a standard
[27:44] say I know he cares. I know he cares.
[27:46] But but we in this series I was trying
[27:48] to bring out that God doesn't just say
[27:51] uh doesn't just say he cares. He's a
[27:54] supernatural God that wants to show that
[27:56] he cares by changing the situation.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Can I have an amen tonight? God doesn't
[28:04] stand back and say, "I care." He wants
[28:07] to step in and show that he cares. And
[28:09] he wants to show himself supernatural on
[28:12] your behalf. But notice the title now.
[28:14] It's not just that he cares. It's do you
[28:17] care?
[28:19] &gt;&gt; And so I think we find a principle. It's
[28:21] not just a sermon, but it's a it's a
[28:23] principle. It's unveiling a powerful
[28:25] principle of connecting those two
[28:27] things, connecting a supernatural God
[28:29] and the people connecting with that so
[28:31] that we can get supernatural results.
[28:34] And we're we also found in in speaking
[28:37] about this that it's not just surface
[28:39] revol results or not just physical
[28:42] healing. I gave two examples at the
[28:44] beginning of that message. He cares do
[28:46] you care. Brother Brown goes right into
[28:48] two examples of two people. One's a
[28:49] young minister, one's a woman, and she
[28:51] was seeking God nine years about
[28:53] something. And then the the minister
[28:55] also had something happen to him, but it
[28:58] wasn't physical healing that they
[28:59] needed. The one lady was trying to get
[29:02] an interview with brother Brandham for I
[29:04] think she nine years she tried and
[29:06] finally she got to see him. So, but but
[29:08] they weren't needs that we were surface
[29:10] or physical or some type of disease.
[29:12] They actually ended up being as we
[29:14] elaborated on a pre a young preacher
[29:16] just married with a complex and then a
[29:19] woman that had kind of a bad incident
[29:21] when she was younger. So they were not
[29:23] physical problems. They were not
[29:25] physical diseases. That teaches us that
[29:27] God cares and is interested about every
[29:31] need in the human being from our past,
[29:33] from our present, whatever it is, God
[29:36] cares about it. And so if we know that,
[29:38] then we should become a people that's
[29:41] not dishing certain things to the side
[29:43] and just only reaching out to God for
[29:45] surface things. Everything that we come
[29:48] across that we uh cannot handle, we
[29:51] shouldn't turn to our own reasoning, but
[29:53] we should say, "God knows about this.
[29:55] God cares about this, but how does God
[29:58] want to care? I want to submit myself to
[30:00] find out how God's going to change
[30:02] this."
[30:03] &gt;&gt; We need to be that way, too. So we we
[30:06] find then that in this complex that the
[30:08] minister had and the woman that had this
[30:10] problem, the devil was working on those
[30:12] things to defeat them. Can you say amen?
[30:14] To defeat uh their Christian walk
[30:18] because of these complexes and because
[30:19] of these things. So it's it's going we
[30:22] we must realize it's God likes to go
[30:24] beyond just what's happening and get to
[30:27] the cure. my mother mother-in-law uh a
[30:30] couple mornings ago, she was reading
[30:31] something and she said she appreciated
[30:33] Sunday morning service. We're talking
[30:35] about the cure for non and talking about
[30:38] this word having a cure in it. And uh
[30:40] it's always nice to get compliments from
[30:42] your mother-in-law. It it kind of boosts
[30:44] your energy quite a bit. But she said
[30:46] she remembers reading that brother
[30:47] Brandon said himself and she remembered
[30:50] the quote that he says all these being
[30:52] compared with all the other healing
[30:53] evangelist ministers. They did a great
[30:55] with work of God and they had their own
[30:57] work. But he said God has given my
[30:59] ministry to get to the cure
[31:02] &gt;&gt; and not just physically but to get to
[31:04] the cure of the problem of sin of this
[31:07] age. When God sends a prophet, he's
[31:09] interested in a cure, not just a
[31:11] band-aid on the problem.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; He wants to get to the cure. And and and
[31:15] also that brother Bram talked about
[31:18] this. He wants to go deeper. So he he
[31:20] not only wants to get to the cure, but
[31:22] before you get to a cure, you have to
[31:24] find the cause. And brother says a a
[31:27] good doctor will want to get to the
[31:29] cause of it because you can't get to a
[31:30] cure till you find the cause. And so
[31:33] this word is to help us to un unveil
[31:37] things so we can get to the cause of the
[31:39] problem, expose the enemy, but then God
[31:41] wants to bring the cure and bring
[31:43] complete healing. So we we we can't get
[31:45] to the cure without finding the cause.
[31:47] Here's it. Here it is. God wants to go
[31:50] deeper than just the surface. So we must
[31:52] not stop short of all the healing God
[31:55] can do for us. I find many believers
[31:57] that can testify of salvation. They have
[32:00] a great testimony of their salvation uh
[32:02] of being baptized of receiving the Holy
[32:05] Ghost and great healing of the body,
[32:07] healed of cancer and everything. And
[32:09] we're always going to have that as long
[32:11] as God is present among us. And people
[32:13] have great testimonies and they're
[32:15] wonderful testimonies. But we should not
[32:17] limit God in any way. There should maybe
[32:20] be testimonies of other things. I've
[32:22] heard, I don't hear it very much, but I
[32:23] was delivered of uh somebody would say,
[32:26] I want to testify to the saints. I was
[32:28] delivered of bitterness. I had
[32:29] bitterness in my heart for years and God
[32:31] delivered me of that.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; I had a pride in my heart for years and
[32:35] God delivered me of that. I had a temper
[32:37] and God finally dealt with that thing
[32:39] and I no longer have that temper.
[32:42] But we hear the other testimonies, the
[32:44] surface testimonies more than we hear
[32:46] the inward things. But God is interested
[32:49] in digging out all that he can dig out
[32:51] so we can be free. Praise the Lord. So
[32:54] now we should be we should show that we
[32:56] care about every question, every fear,
[33:00] every past cloud that's over us. Can you
[33:02] say amen? We should show that we care
[33:05] because God cares about that and to
[33:07] bring those things to him. He cares to
[33:10] move in all things that cause our hearts
[33:13] to be locked up.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; I said he cares to move in on everything
[33:20] that would cause our hearts to be locked
[33:23] up
[33:26] &gt;&gt; or our hearts to be held back
[33:29] or he wants to find what causes our
[33:32] hearts to lock up towards him toward him
[33:35] and get to the bottom of it. God wants
[33:37] to do that. I was thinking of a
[33:39] scripture today. Hebrews 10:38.
[33:41] Now the just shall live by faith. But if
[33:44] any man draw back, my soul shall have no
[33:48] pleasure in him. God does not get
[33:50] pleasure of somebody having their locked
[33:53] up heart towards him and towards one
[33:55] another. If there's a spirit that's
[33:57] locked up, something's holding you back.
[33:59] You're not free in your spirit. And
[34:01] especially when it's towards the Lord.
[34:03] If a man draw back, the judge shall live
[34:06] by faith. But a man just draws back. God
[34:08] doesn't take pleasure in that. But God
[34:10] takes pleasure when a heart is got
[34:12] everything on the table, saying, "God,
[34:14] here's my heart. Here's my life. Here's
[34:16] my problems. I'm not hiding anything
[34:19] from you. Expose it, Lord, and deliver
[34:21] me."
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But I will have no
[34:25] pleasure in one who's draws back and
[34:27] draws back and got their hearts locked
[34:29] up towards God. It's not a good thing
[34:31] because he cares about everything that
[34:33] defeats us and cares enough to change.
[34:36] That's why he does it. He cares enough
[34:38] to bring change. So look how powerful
[34:40] this principle both things coming
[34:42] together. He cares, but do you care? And
[34:46] the supernatural God who cares
[34:49] connecting with a sincere
[34:52] uh nononsense believer. Let me call him
[34:55] that tonight. God who cares sup and
[34:57] wants to supernaturally care and connect
[35:00] that somehow with a a sincere nononsense
[35:03] believer who really cares too and really
[35:06] wants it and is willing to do whatever
[35:08] it takes. That type of key coming
[35:10] together, I'm telling you, God's going
[35:13] to come on the scene.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; God's going to come on the scene. And it
[35:17] won't be because you had a 30-day fast.
[35:19] If God leads you to do that, that's
[35:20] fine. What he needs is a heart that's
[35:22] open to say, "I am ready for God to deal
[35:25] with this thing. I'm ready to be honest
[35:28] about it. I'm ready to bring it to him
[35:30] and I'm willing to confess it." And when
[35:32] you've got that type of atmosphere, then
[35:34] God steps in and he can do something
[35:36] about it. But that that's what I'm
[35:37] talking. So the key is bringing God a
[35:40] God who cares to connect with a person
[35:42] who really cares to be delivered. I know
[35:44] that's simple and this might be a simple
[35:46] sermon tonight, but I'm telling you uh
[35:49] uh something happens when you bring
[35:52] those two things together.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; It's not just that God cares. God is
[35:57] limited only by our lack of faith and
[36:01] our lack of opening up our hearts to
[36:03] him, our lack of uh hum humility.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; He's only li he's not limited except for
[36:10] what we hold him back with. But you
[36:12] bring those two things together,
[36:14] something is going to happen. Something
[36:16] we bring it together, something
[36:18] supernatural can happen. I If that is
[36:20] true, then the enemy would work really
[36:23] hard at making a person hesitant to turn
[36:27] everything over to him. Why? Because if
[36:29] the enemy is working hard at keeping you
[36:32] your heart blocked, keeping you distant
[36:35] from the Lord, keeping you hiding
[36:36] things, if he can keep you doing that,
[36:39] then what's he keeping you from? If you
[36:41] make that supernatural connection,
[36:43] &gt;&gt; it's over. It's over. It's done. It's
[36:47] finished. God steps in. It's over. No
[36:50] wonder Satan fights against an open
[36:52] heart. When No wonder Satan fights that
[36:55] try to keep this from happening. We will
[36:57] get into all the ways that he keeps a
[37:00] person from fully trusting God and the
[37:02] hindrances to God. We'll get into a lot
[37:04] of those things still in this series.
[37:07] The hindrances to God stepping in. So
[37:10] remember, uh, and I I've already covered
[37:12] that he says I care, but he doesn't just
[37:14] say I care. He's his caring is doing
[37:17] something about it. If God cares that
[37:19] way, I'm I'm still um summarizing so
[37:23] that we can remember from two months
[37:25] ago, whatever it was. All right. Is that
[37:26] okay with everybody? So if God says, "I
[37:29] care, but it's not just saying it." His
[37:31] caring is doing something about it. Our
[37:33] caring has to be willing to do something
[37:35] about it.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; We can't just say, "I really care. I I
[37:39] want this habit I've had for years and
[37:41] this thing I go to this private sin that
[37:43] I do and you know I really Okay, put
[37:46] your money where your mouth is.
[37:49] God wants to step in and show that he
[37:51] cares. Well, we want to step with God
[37:53] and show that we really care. How
[37:55] willing are you? Do you really want?
[37:59] &gt;&gt; As he said told the man, "Do you want to
[38:01] be well? Do you really want to be well?"
[38:02] He had to be asked first. Do you really
[38:05] want this? If you want it, I can do it
[38:07] for you, but you got to really want to.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, it's the only way
[38:12] that it works. And his caring has
[38:14] emotion and an action to it. So, our
[38:16] caring must have emotion and an action
[38:19] to it. It's the only way it works. If
[38:21] our bitterness is bringing us to an
[38:24] insensitive feeling of saying, "I really
[38:26] don't care anymore." Be careful of that,
[38:28] friends. I'll tell you, our world, Satan
[38:31] is is permeating our world with an I
[38:34] don't care attitude towards a
[38:36] supernatural God.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Just I I don't know what else how else
[38:40] to say it. I don't have a better way to
[38:41] say it, but just be careful because
[38:43] every day people are dropping like flies
[38:45] because you know why? I just don't care
[38:47] anymore. I'm giving up. I don't care. I
[38:51] you know, I'm not coming to the altar. I
[38:52] had a man tell me, "I'm not going to do
[38:54] that anymore. I tried that and it didn't
[38:56] work." Really? really you tried it
[38:59] didn't work. What are you just ruling
[39:00] things out on your own until you come to
[39:03] the place you get an insensitive heart
[39:04] you just don't care anymore. Don't let
[39:06] your heart lose its sensitivity to God.
[39:09] Don't let your heart have an I don't
[39:11] care attitude.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; It's the worst bitterness that you can
[39:14] come to because you start to lose that.
[39:16] You actually move yourself further and
[39:19] further away from God being able to
[39:22] express his feelings toward you, his
[39:25] heart towards you. That's what happens
[39:26] in relationships. We lose the
[39:28] sensitivity to one another. We're not
[39:30] emotionally connecting with our siblings
[39:32] or our mom or our dad. And if we allow
[39:35] it, we keep getting more and more and
[39:37] more distant from one another. Same
[39:39] thing happens with God. We're not
[39:41] connecting with God because we're slowly
[39:43] getting distant from him.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Can't let that happen. uh insensitivity
[39:48] like the woman that eventually she
[39:50] missed her uh part there when God was
[39:52] speaking to her way when she was early
[39:54] and then she was on her deathbed
[39:56] screaming to get brother Brandham in
[39:58] there. He says, she said, you remember
[40:00] the story? She said, when you spoke to
[40:02] me in that service and I was bitter
[40:04] toward you in that service, when you
[40:06] spoke to me, he says, she said, that's
[40:07] where I lost my chance. I should have
[40:09] responded. And she said, now I can see
[40:11] my mother's soul fry in hell, and I
[40:14] wouldn't care.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; That's how far it can take you.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; I just don't care anymore. All
[40:20] sensitivity is gone. Let's keep a
[40:23] tender, workable
[40:26] heart. A heart that can cry. A heart
[40:29] heart that can be humble. A heart that
[40:31] when we lose a you know when when when
[40:34] the uh when the eyes leak the head won't
[40:38] swell.
[40:42] What George used to say when the eyes
[40:44] leak the head won't keep God. Stay
[40:47] humble before God. We're getting so if
[40:49] we can't even be moved and I don't say
[40:51] have to cry but I'm saying we need to be
[40:53] moved to brokenness. We need the spirit
[40:55] to always be able to move us to tears
[40:58] and not just because you're going
[40:59] through something because you feel the
[41:00] presence of God. You feel his assurance.
[41:03] You feel he's wanting to minister peace
[41:05] to you. Don't ever become so hard in
[41:07] your heart that you don't feel that
[41:09] anymore. Anybody with me tonight? This
[41:12] is an insensitive world. Jesus said the
[41:14] love of many will grow cold.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; That's the atmosphere we live in. Let's
[41:19] not let it happen to us. Let's stay
[41:21] sensitive to the Lord. Can you say amen?
[41:23] Our bitterness is bringing us to that in
[41:25] feeling sometimes I don't care care
[41:27] anymore and it limits God. So when these
[41:30] two things come together I'm not getting
[41:31] very far tonight in just bringing my
[41:33] summary of the past sermons. When these
[41:36] two things come together he cares. Do
[41:38] you care? There's a you know there's a
[41:40] couple places brother Ben mentions that
[41:42] I pulled them up today. Two omnipotence
[41:44] meeting. How many's ever seen those?
[41:46] There's only a couple places I can found
[41:47] but he but he says this. Amen. And he
[41:50] says, "Cut every obstacle from human
[41:52] beings that they might be connected like
[41:54] the Garden of Eden." Cut. How do you get
[41:56] connected like the Garden of Eden? You
[41:58] cut every obstacle from human beings.
[42:01] That they might be connected like the
[42:02] Garden of Eden. Now, man, I was going to
[42:05] choke it, but I'm going to say it. Man
[42:07] is omnipotent. You don't believe that?
[42:09] But he is a full A man fully surrendered
[42:12] to God is omnipotent. In other words, he
[42:15] has all power. did not say, did he not
[42:17] say in Mark 11:22, "Whatsoever things
[42:19] you say and don't doubt in your heart,
[42:21] it'll come to pass, you can have what
[42:23] you have said." What happens when two
[42:26] omnipotents meet? When God and man comes
[42:29] together, two omnipotents, something's
[42:32] got to shake.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; So, he cares. Do you care? Bring that
[42:37] together for a connection. There's going
[42:39] to be some real electricity
[42:42] &gt;&gt; from the throne of God. Can you say
[42:43] amen? whosoever shall would say with a
[42:45] creative power of omnipotence of God
[42:47] knowing that he promised it and he said
[42:49] it with in his word. It creates a power
[42:52] that goes out yonder and brings things
[42:55] to pass things that is not. It makes
[42:57] them as though they are because two
[43:00] omnipotence have met. He says it again
[43:03] in 19 uh 60 in uncertain sound. Then the
[43:07] first thing you know, little old Martha,
[43:09] he's talking about Martha and Mary and
[43:11] and uh her, you know, their uh brother
[43:13] died, Lazarus, and she's coming out
[43:15] there and she said, "Oh Lord, oh uh I
[43:18] like that." And she titled him Lord. And
[43:21] that was good. Uh Lord, I like that. She
[43:23] titled him what he was. He was her Lord.
[43:26] If thou would have been here, my brother
[43:29] would not have died. Now, I want to say
[43:31] something. There's the human side of
[43:33] Martha.
[43:34] little bit of an attitude with it. Just
[43:36] a little bit of an attitude, Lord. Uh
[43:39] she's she's respectful, Lord. But it's
[43:43] just like a little just a Lord, if you'd
[43:46] have been here, if you'd have hurried up
[43:48] a little bit, you really took your time
[43:50] here. You know, I needed you a long time
[43:54] ago and you really took your Well, we
[43:56] know now the Lord took his time for a
[43:58] reason.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord took his time for a reason. So
[44:02] notice this human side which is us
[44:05] sometimes the complaining side or didn't
[44:07] work out right and so she brings out the
[44:10] human side where she says Lord if you'd
[44:12] have been here my brother would not have
[44:14] died see and she said even now whatever
[44:17] you would ask God will give it to you
[44:19] what's speaking now
[44:21] the word in her the seed of God is
[44:24] reaching in faith and speaking something
[44:26] look at how close the human side and
[44:27] what's inside of her Lord if you'd have
[44:29] been here this wouldn't have happened I
[44:30] wish you'd have been here earlier and
[44:32] Then something comes from resonates from
[44:34] the deep inside said but even now
[44:36] whatever you should say it'll come to
[44:38] pass.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Now if we only let the human side come
[44:43] out of us every day and not that seed
[44:46] that's in the inside to bring it to a
[44:49] confession and say it because a lot of
[44:51] times the devil's going to squelch that
[44:52] out. You're going to be complainers.
[44:54] You're going to be speaking negative.
[44:56] You're going to say life is stressful.
[44:58] Life is too much. and you're gonna just
[45:00] push God out of all of it. The human
[45:02] side is never going to make a connection
[45:04] with this omnipotent God.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen?
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Your complaining, your bitterness will
[45:11] never make a connection with this
[45:13] supernatural God.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; You can keep saying, "Oh, Lord, if you'd
[45:16] have been here, Lord, that should have
[45:18] happened a lot." You can keep bringing
[45:20] out the human side, but it'll never
[45:22] bring this connection, but he cares. Do
[45:24] you care? It'll never make two
[45:26] omnipotence meet so the supernatural God
[45:28] can do something. But when something
[45:30] reached in Martha and something of God
[45:33] said, "Whatever you would say even now,
[45:36] it would come to pass."
[45:37] &gt;&gt; And that's all she needed to say.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Lazarus came to life. Somebody say,
[45:42] "Praise the Lord."
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Even now, whatever you ask God, God will
[45:47] give it to you. Nothing uncertain about
[45:48] that. No. See, and that's when two
[45:50] positives meet. That's when two
[45:52] omnipotents meet. When one omnipotent
[45:54] she had, she had a perfect omnipotent
[45:57] faith in Christ. And Christ was
[45:59] omnipotent. See, is he bringing out the
[46:01] two? She had a perfect omnipotent faith
[46:02] in Christ. And Christ was omnipotent.
[46:05] See, she had faith, infinite faith in
[46:07] Christ that he was the Lord. And note,
[46:10] whatever he asks, God would give it to
[46:12] him. In other words, she said, you just
[46:14] speak the word. That's all you have to
[46:15] do. Whatever you ask, God will give it
[46:17] to you. That's right. That's omnipotent.
[46:19] All powerful cuz he just said so. See?
[46:22] All right. And he was all powerful.
[46:25] That's when two powers, two omnipotent
[46:28] powers meets together. It's contact.
[46:31] Then when a line here has got 150 volts
[46:35] and this one has 150 volts. When they
[46:37] come together, you got 150 volts both
[46:41] ways.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden you got power now. All
[46:45] of a sudden, listen, we have to connect
[46:47] our faith with this living Christ.
[46:53] We cannot be disconnected.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Leodysa disconnects you with a
[46:58] relationship with the Lord. Leoa
[47:01] disconnects you from reading your Bible.
[47:03] Leodysia disconnects you from being in
[47:05] the word. Leodysia's if if Leodysia and
[47:09] the devil could do it, he dis disconnect
[47:11] all of us from the presence of God and
[47:13] all of us from one another and split
[47:15] every marriage in this church.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; He's got an agenda.
[47:22] We need to be on our toes and say, "No,
[47:24] no, this is the hour I'm becoming one
[47:26] with him.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; I won't let any of Leo dis do that. He's
[47:30] not going to destroy my walk with the
[47:31] Lord. He's not going to destroy my
[47:32] marriage. He's not going to destroy my
[47:34] family." Why? Because I'm becoming one
[47:36] in him. I'm becoming one with one
[47:38] another as well. A lot of marriages
[47:39] don't even know what oneness is.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; It's only through Christ.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Your oneness cannot be some material
[47:47] gain of this earth. Well, we found
[47:50] agreement to buy this together. We found
[47:52] agree. Your oneness cannot be based upon
[47:54] material things. Your oneness cannot be
[47:57] based upon just a sexual relationship.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Every millions of people have that and
[48:04] they have no oneness.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Is that part of it? Yes. But oneness is
[48:09] when both it's a three cord pole, a
[48:11] three cord uh rope is not quickly
[48:14] broken. There's three part of a
[48:16] marriage. Christ the husband and wife
[48:19] and that's where you have a union. You
[48:21] find fellowship together about him
[48:25] &gt;&gt; with him. Can you say not just in your
[48:27] Bibles but you find it has to be a
[48:30] oneness with Christ and one another.
[48:32] There is no other basis for true
[48:34] oneness.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; There is no job. There is no house.
[48:37] There is no achievement in life that you
[48:40] can base your oneness in your marriage
[48:42] on. I don't know why the Lord's having
[48:44] me say this, but I'm saying it. Do not
[48:46] think that you can connect the right way
[48:49] with one another and with Christ by
[48:52] reaching from something that's worldly
[48:54] and making it happen. No, there has to
[48:56] be a oneness with the Lord and a oneness
[48:58] with one another based upon the word and
[49:01] Christ. When I say the word, not just
[49:03] this Bible, Christ is the word. I'm
[49:05] talking about a person in your home, a
[49:07] person in your marriage, a person that's
[49:10] there that you're inviting between you.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're praying together. We're
[49:14] making this work, but Lord, you're going
[49:16] to make it work for us. And Father,
[49:18] we're together in this. We're praying
[49:20] together. That's oneness. Can you say
[49:22] amen?
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Any other thing tries to tear you apart.
[49:25] And let How many would say, "May this
[49:27] 150 vote connect with that 150 vote."
[49:30] And two omnipotence meet, there's going
[49:32] to be a flow of the power of God.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:38] So this is what happens when a caring
[49:40] God is connected with a true humble
[49:42] heart of faith that they really care. We
[49:45] pray for that connection to happen. As a
[49:47] minister, we do that. And so I'm
[49:49] ministering on this series so I can
[49:51] learn from it a little bit myself. Uh
[49:53] but and ministers stand in the gap
[49:55] sometimes, pastors and ministers, we're
[49:57] standing between the people and God, and
[49:59] we're trying to see that connected. I'm
[50:01] preaching tonight so that we'll have a
[50:03] connection and revelation with this
[50:04] person of Christ. That's what we do. And
[50:06] it's a difficult job sometimes because
[50:08] we don't want to do it in our own
[50:10] intellect. We want to pray and get out
[50:11] of the way that God can connect you.
[50:13] God's presence can connect you. But you
[50:16] have to be willing. You have to care,
[50:17] too. On a Wednesday night tonight, you
[50:20] have to care.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; I care about what brother Paul's saying.
[50:23] I I care about I I'm here, but I'm not
[50:25] just want to hear be here and body, but
[50:27] I want to be all here. You know, people,
[50:29] my dad used to say, uh, we're we're not
[50:32] we're we're here, but we're not all
[50:34] there.
[50:37] We're here, but we're not all there. In
[50:38] other words, they weren't really all
[50:39] there. And a lot of Wednesday nights are
[50:41] that way. And I understand totally
[50:43] understand the tiredness. But if we're
[50:45] going to go and come all this way, uh,
[50:47] we might as well be here when we're
[50:49] here.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's good to be where
[50:54] you're at, you know, all there. And
[50:57] engage your mind and your heart and say,
[50:59] "Let's make this worthwhile." Can you
[51:01] say amen? But ministers try to connect
[51:03] that. And some of the reason uh that I'm
[51:06] into this a little bit studying is that
[51:08] I get asked some questions sometimes.
[51:10] How do you counsel? How do you approach
[51:12] counseling? Well, listen, this is the
[51:14] best counseling instruction you can get.
[51:18] Because if you're counseling in an
[51:19] office or you're trying to help someone
[51:21] or you're preaching to people, if you
[51:23] have hearts to begin to get humble and
[51:26] bring up and bring real just really
[51:28] being honest and confession before the
[51:30] Lord and repentance, if you can get that
[51:33] atmosphere going, God steps into that
[51:36] atmosphere. Whether it's counseling or
[51:38] anything, he cares. You need a
[51:41] revelation that God cares. Brother Paul,
[51:44] for my situation, my it's it's almost
[51:46] hopeless if not hopeless. It's not
[51:48] hopeless in God.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; It's not hopeless in God.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And so, you got to have that revelation.
[51:56] Bring that person along that he cares
[51:57] about this situation. He knows about the
[51:59] situation. He cares. No matter how dirty
[52:02] your sin is, maybe the sin is just
[52:04] hidden and it's just it's too dirty to
[52:06] talk about. God cares about that.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; But then you work on this other side.
[52:11] say now what can you bring here to the
[52:13] Lord as a humble heart and you start
[52:15] seeing that it can happen within within
[52:18] just a few seconds in counseling or
[52:22] sometimes it's five years of counseling
[52:25] &gt;&gt; doesn't matter when that moment happens
[52:28] &gt;&gt; this isn't just a ministry this is a
[52:32] moment that needs to happen
[52:34] &gt;&gt; between God and you
[52:38] that moment happens it's over
[52:41] God steps in.
[52:44] Praise the Lord. So we pray that
[52:47] connection happens. So we have in this
[52:49] series, we've explored many ways of how
[52:51] we approach and show God that we really
[52:53] care. Okay, here's some things we've
[52:56] covered. Real true unclouded faith from
[52:59] the heart. You need that to show you
[53:00] care. We've covered true submission from
[53:03] the heart. We've covered that. That
[53:05] shows you care. You show your care with
[53:07] a real true humility from your heart.
[53:09] That shows you you're telling God that
[53:11] you care. You care by giving more
[53:13] attention to him that is speaking. In
[53:15] other words, reverence. I read the
[53:17] scripture in Hebrews. We ought to give
[53:19] more earnest heed to the things God is
[53:22] saying. By giving reverence to what God
[53:24] is saying even tonight, a fear for it, a
[53:27] reverence for it. If you give attention
[53:29] to it, then you're giving attention to
[53:31] him that is speaking. Not Paul Le
[53:32] Fontaine or some other preacher, but is
[53:34] it him speaking? If he's speaking, give
[53:36] more reverence to it. give more heed to
[53:38] it. That's how you show you care. You
[53:41] show you care by perseverance that will
[53:43] not run away or hide. Perseverant. The
[53:46] the fellow that had the complex went all
[53:48] the way to New York and he was under
[53:50] this cloud of complex just married by
[53:51] brother Bram took off and him and
[53:53] another minister. They drove all the way
[53:56] back. They weren't running. They weren't
[53:58] hiding. They wanted to come and meet the
[54:00] prophet again because they wanted I'm
[54:02] not going to go on like this. I'm just
[54:04] freshly married. I'm not going to carry
[54:06] this complex. I want to deal with this
[54:07] right now. I don't want to hide it. He
[54:09] drove all the way back to
[54:10] Jeffersonville. And brother Bram was
[54:12] just driving down, taking his family
[54:14] out, just said, I feel led to go into
[54:16] this motel room. And there they are
[54:17] standing there, gone. Two omnipotence
[54:20] meet
[54:21] &gt;&gt; in the motel parking lot.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Bam, I didn't could I didn't
[54:25] know I was going to see you. This must
[54:27] be of God. In a few minutes, that thing
[54:29] was that complex was unveiled. That sin
[54:31] exposed. It was over. He said they were
[54:33] just happy and free and went back to
[54:35] their honeymoon. Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the other lady we
[54:40] find was perseverant to wait nine years
[54:42] before she could see the prophet. She
[54:45] didn't run. She didn't hide. She kept
[54:46] it. And then a desperation. How do we
[54:48] show we care? Desperation that we won't
[54:51] ever give up.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; God likes to see that. This is how we
[54:54] show we care. Another way is believing
[54:57] that he is. Not that he was, but he is.
[55:00] And that he's a rewarder of those that
[55:02] diligently seek him. He is here now.
[55:06] It's not I was, not I will be, but I am.
[55:10] And we show we care when we when we
[55:12] believe he is, and he's a rewarder of
[55:15] those that diligently seek him. It's not
[55:17] that he was, but he is right now.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And we show that we care by that. Can
[55:22] you say amen?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; He's here in every way except his
[55:25] corporal body. And then uh we dealt a
[55:29] little bit with this, but I just want to
[55:30] linger a bit on it tonight. truly
[55:33] casting our cares upon him. So this is a
[55:37] way we show we care. We cast our cares
[55:40] upon him. For he carth for us. So we
[55:42] cast our stress. We cast our anxiety. We
[55:47] cast our worries. We cast our fears. We
[55:51] don't hold them. We cast them on him.
[55:54] Cares is worries. Cares is problems.
[55:57] Cares is anxiety. Cares is worried about
[56:00] the future. He said, "How do we show we
[56:03] care? Cast our cares on him." Now, do
[56:06] you know what that means? Do you know
[56:09] what it means casting? In the original
[56:11] word, the Greek word is uh pet patito
[56:14] and it means to throw. It means to cast.
[56:17] I had to research that a little bit more
[56:19] because we realized that really that's
[56:21] how he wants us to do it. It's not just
[56:23] somebody coming over and just holding
[56:25] back and just slipping something to the
[56:27] Lord. It's casting. It actually has to
[56:29] do with throwing it to him.
[56:33] Let me go deeper with that. A little
[56:35] cultural and historical background. In
[56:37] the ancient Greece Roman world, the act
[56:39] of throwing or casting was a common
[56:41] physical action whether in daily life,
[56:44] in sports or in military context. The
[56:46] term rit would have been understood by
[56:49] contemporary audiences audiences as a
[56:51] vigorous and intentional action. So,
[56:55] this is not just slipping over to the
[56:57] Lord and saying, "Could you take care of
[56:58] this?" And I'll just slip this under the
[57:00] door. No, this is a vigorous,
[57:02] intentional. I'm casting it all on you
[57:07] &gt;&gt; and you're not ashamed to do it.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Take a little bit further. It's a
[57:12] vigorous and intentional action. I tell
[57:14] you, if you care about deliverance,
[57:17] you're intentional.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; You mean it.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Put your money where your mouth is.
[57:24] Don't don't come up to the altar and
[57:26] say, "I want deliverance." And not no,
[57:28] you you're you want deliverance. And if
[57:32] you say you want it, you're intentional
[57:34] about it. I'm ready to leave this thing
[57:35] at the altar with the Lord.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. goes on to say he said
[57:40] that in the biblical context this word
[57:43] cast often carries a deeper spiritual
[57:46] and symbolic meaning reflecting listen
[57:49] now the and this fits with my series
[57:51] here reflecting the decisive actions of
[57:54] God or individuals in response to divine
[57:59] instruction or intervention. Let me read
[58:01] that again in case you got clouded over.
[58:03] This word often carries a deeper
[58:05] spiritual and symbolic meaning
[58:06] reflecting the decisive actions of God
[58:10] and the decisive actions of individuals
[58:13] in response to a divine instruction or
[58:16] an invention. In other words, the
[58:18] commandments given, the words given, but
[58:20] now you have an intentional action of a
[58:23] believer and an action of God. An
[58:25] intentional vigorous action. Lord, I am
[58:28] ready to cast this on you
[58:31] &gt;&gt; because you said that I could. Yes.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm ready to take this thing. I
[58:38] have been haven't been able to bear it.
[58:40] I I can keep trying to do it on my own,
[58:42] but I am ready. And it's not just
[58:45] slipping under the I'm casting it on
[58:47] you. I'm giving it all to you. I'm
[58:50] giving up and let Jesus take over.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Casting is an intentional, decisive
[58:57] action not just to believers, but of
[58:59] God. It's a decisive action for him to
[59:02] step in and deliver you.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; He's not going to He's not half-hazard
[59:06] about it. He's not He's not saying, you
[59:09] know, I care and you know, no, no, he he
[59:12] he when he steps in, he steps in
[59:15] &gt;&gt; and he brings everything with him
[59:18] that's within him to deliver this
[59:21] precious soul.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; So, I wanted you to see what casting
[59:28] means. It's it it is throwing. It is it
[59:31] is I'm giving this all to you. It is a
[59:34] very vigorous symbolic action of when
[59:37] someone's in counseling or someone's in
[59:39] a service when God touches them and
[59:41] they're ready. They're ready. I'm ready
[59:43] to cast this on the Lord for he carth
[59:46] for me.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Casting all your care upon him for he
[59:50] carth for you. Praise the Lord. Not
[59:53] halfhazard, not hesitant. Right?
[59:55] &gt;&gt; A a a believer comes to the place that
[59:58] they are sick and tired of being sick
[1:00:00] and tired. They're sick of their habit.
[1:00:02] They're sick of their sickness. They're
[1:00:04] sick of the the bondage of it. Can you
[1:00:07] say amen? You you you bring it to him
[1:00:10] and it's an intentional thing for you to
[1:00:13] have it all on the table. If you come to
[1:00:15] counseling with me, be ready to give it
[1:00:17] all on the table. That's probably going
[1:00:20] to run all of you off from counseling
[1:00:21] from now on, but listen, it's not me.
[1:00:23] It's just come ready to say, "Lord,
[1:00:26] whatever you would use here, I'm not
[1:00:28] afraid of you. I'm not afraid of being
[1:00:31] afraid."
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; That's the way you got to be. Come
[1:00:34] intentionally. Have it all on the table.
[1:00:36] Not just hand it over, but cast it. Show
[1:00:39] a bit of anger at yourself for covering
[1:00:41] up and hiding.
[1:00:43] Are you angry about it? Are you fed up
[1:00:45] with it? Shamgar was fed up with the
[1:00:47] enemy doing what he was doing. Can you
[1:00:49] say amen? Shamgar got fed up with the
[1:00:51] what the enemy was doing. It it led him
[1:00:54] to to take take the take the the ox goat
[1:00:57] and fight through the Philistines
[1:00:59] because they had done it every year.
[1:01:00] Finally got fed up.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; We have to get fed up. We have to get a
[1:01:05] holy anger. Can you say amen?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Are you angry? It reminds me of when uh
[1:01:10] I won't mention the couple, but brother
[1:01:12] Barry was counseling a couple in our
[1:01:13] church getting out of debt and every few
[1:01:17] months he would call them and say, "Are
[1:01:19] you still angry?" Because if you're not
[1:01:21] angry at your debt, angry at your
[1:01:23] problems, you're not going to get out.
[1:01:25] This is a good type of anger.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; I got in a a heap of debt and I did it.
[1:01:31] I'm owning up to it. I was led in the
[1:01:34] wrong things, made the wrong financial
[1:01:35] decisions, but I'm ready to own up to
[1:01:37] it. And let me testify something to you
[1:01:39] here in just a second. But listen, you
[1:01:42] he'd call and ask him, "Are you still
[1:01:44] angry?"
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't stay angry, you're
[1:01:47] not going to get out of all the debt.
[1:01:49] There has to be an emotion put towards
[1:01:51] the right thing. You know, people get
[1:01:53] mad at people. People get mad at
[1:01:55] preachers. Why don't you direct your
[1:01:57] anger towards the devil and towards your
[1:01:59] habits?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Why don't you direct your anger towards
[1:02:04] I'm fed up with being under bondage?
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Why don't we direct it towards the enemy
[1:02:08] like Shamgar did instead of always to
[1:02:11] one another? And some people their anger
[1:02:13] towards God or towards their dad or
[1:02:15] towards their mom. Why don't we stop
[1:02:17] directing it to the people sometimes who
[1:02:19] love us the most
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and start directing it to the enemy
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; and your habits? Say, I'm I'm I'm tired.
[1:02:26] He said, "Are you still angry? Are you
[1:02:28] still angry? Call a few months. Are you
[1:02:30] still because if you don't stay angry,
[1:02:31] you're not going to get out."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; There's probably some other things in
[1:02:35] financial counseling you need to do
[1:02:36] besides anger. But you can't do all the
[1:02:39] other stuff without being angry at your
[1:02:40] problem, right?
[1:02:43] Amen. So just testifying that we were we
[1:02:48] had 10 rental properties and soon after
[1:02:51] we bought them in two years the market
[1:02:54] fell apart. We lost the values in them
[1:02:56] and everything else and we were in a
[1:02:59] hole and and some of it is decisions we
[1:03:02] made too quickly
[1:03:04] and uh
[1:03:06] so when that happened there was you it
[1:03:08] didn't seem like there was any way out.
[1:03:09] So I I out I I considered the Ishmael.
[1:03:13] And so I remembered Abraham
[1:03:16] bringing Ishmael and holding him up
[1:03:18] before the Lord. Oh, wouldn't this work?
[1:03:21] Oh, that Ishmael would live before thee.
[1:03:23] Please bless Ishmamail. And a lot of
[1:03:26] times we do that. We take our poor
[1:03:27] decisions.
[1:03:29] We justify ourselves and we're asking
[1:03:31] God to bless what we've created,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:36] And God said, "No, Abra." He He blessed
[1:03:38] him, but he never chose that as the
[1:03:41] promise. Isaac was the promised son.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I'll do it my way, and I'm going to do
[1:03:45] it through Sarah, not Hagar. I'm not
[1:03:47] going to do it your way or Sarah's way.
[1:03:48] I'm going to do it my way. The quicker
[1:03:50] we can grow and do things God's way in
[1:03:52] his will, the better off we'll be.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; So, I I felt that way. I And finally, I
[1:03:58] prayed. I said, "God, I'm not asking you
[1:04:00] to bless what I've done or or I'm just
[1:04:03] asking for you to give me wisdom how to
[1:04:05] get out of it. Lead me cuz I I I owned
[1:04:09] up to it. I did this. It's my issues, my
[1:04:12] problem. I've learned from it. But Lord,
[1:04:14] would you help me give me wisdom to know
[1:04:16] how to get out?" And you know what? He
[1:04:18] did through some mentors, through some
[1:04:20] men. He spoke through some men. Took me
[1:04:22] seven years. But today I'm completely
[1:04:25] debtree by the grace of God. So we don't
[1:04:28] ask God to bless our Israels, but we're
[1:04:30] still going back to God saying, "God, I
[1:04:32] made a mess. God, can you give me wisdom
[1:04:35] to get out of it?"
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, everybody.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me go back up here and find
[1:04:41] out where I'm at in my notes.
[1:04:43] So
[1:04:46] the next section of He Cares, Do You
[1:04:49] Care? The next section is what we want
[1:04:51] to get to now and we'll just touch on it
[1:04:53] and then we'll go into this because I'm
[1:04:55] taking that sermon if you're listening
[1:04:57] and please do listen to it. I'm taking
[1:04:59] it in sections here. It's so such a good
[1:05:02] some of some of brother Brandham's
[1:05:03] sermon. Some of the sermons are
[1:05:05] doctrinal revelation of doctrine. Some
[1:05:08] of is a restoration of some are faithb
[1:05:10] buildinging messages and some preachers
[1:05:13] only quote out of the faithb building
[1:05:15] quotes um and some only quote out of the
[1:05:18] doctrinal. But there's a lot more in
[1:05:20] there than than that. Can you say amen?
[1:05:22] And some sermons are not doctrinal
[1:05:24] restoration. Some are just some are
[1:05:26] faithb building, but some are teaching
[1:05:28] sons of God how to live and sons of God
[1:05:32] how to be taught how to live, how to how
[1:05:34] to live like a son and daughter of God.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; So you should be listening to all the
[1:05:37] message and realize don't just go in
[1:05:39] there to get faith-building messages.
[1:05:41] Don't just go in there to to get your
[1:05:43] mind all filled with all the revelation
[1:05:47] of all the doctrines.
[1:05:49] You could have all the mysteries and
[1:05:50] understand all the mysteries and miss
[1:05:52] divine love.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Did anybody know the Bible says that
[1:05:55] though I give my body to be burned,
[1:05:57] though I understand all mysteries and
[1:05:58] have not love, I have nothing. So
[1:06:00] there's more in there of the love of God
[1:06:02] and we learn things and this he cares.
[1:06:05] Do you care? Is is a principle that if
[1:06:07] we'll catch it, it'll be very helpful to
[1:06:09] us in the next section of the service.
[1:06:11] If you're reading along with me, you'll
[1:06:13] find out uh that he says here now, we
[1:06:16] must go on to another portion of
[1:06:18] scripture here and another thought to
[1:06:20] back this up. Before I go, I might say
[1:06:23] this. Everybody doesn't have this
[1:06:25] comforter because he's just been through
[1:06:27] talking about the Holy Ghost as a
[1:06:28] comforter. And when he was leaving, the
[1:06:31] disciples were concerned. But he says,
[1:06:34] "I I will not leave thee or forsake thee
[1:06:36] because it was a comfort to have the
[1:06:38] Lord there in that body. It was a
[1:06:39] comfort to them. We can lean on him. We
[1:06:41] can go to him. He's here." When he talks
[1:06:43] about leaving, they get nervous. What
[1:06:45] are we going to do? He said, "I'm not
[1:06:46] going to leave you comfortless. I will
[1:06:48] send you the Holy Ghost and he'll be
[1:06:50] your comforter. He'll be with you. And
[1:06:52] he'll be so close. He won't just be with
[1:06:54] you. He'll be in you." So the same
[1:06:57] comfort in the same God who cares will
[1:07:00] come in the Holy Ghost inside you and be
[1:07:03] there with you all the time.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he's talking about this
[1:07:07] comforter. He says, "But they don't." He
[1:07:08] says, "Everybody doesn't have this
[1:07:10] comforter. They don't they don't have
[1:07:12] it." So the reason they don't have it is
[1:07:14] because they don't accept it. It's for
[1:07:16] them, but they don't accept it. Now, I
[1:07:18] hope that you're spiritual enough to
[1:07:19] read what I'm saying. See, I'm speaking
[1:07:21] to a group here that's to be prayed for
[1:07:22] in a few minutes. And we have this
[1:07:24] comforter in the Holy Spirit that's sent
[1:07:26] for the comforter. But all people won't
[1:07:28] receive that. They don't believe in it.
[1:07:29] See, they in order to do that, then
[1:07:32] listen now, here's the next principle.
[1:07:34] Then they gather their comfort from some
[1:07:37] other resource, some other means. If
[1:07:40] they don't accept God's provided
[1:07:43] comforter, then they have to get some
[1:07:46] other comforter. See, listen. because
[1:07:49] you can't live without something to live
[1:07:53] for.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Very deep comment. Very just I think it
[1:07:58] just so so deep in the Lord for him to
[1:08:00] to to express this in this hour as human
[1:08:04] beings are just turning to so many
[1:08:06] things and so much emptiness. But why do
[1:08:09] they keep doing why don't they just give
[1:08:10] up? And there are some that give up and
[1:08:12] just commit suicide. But most people
[1:08:14] because we're human beings, we have to
[1:08:16] have something to live for.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; But he says that's the reason that
[1:08:23] people take some other comforter besides
[1:08:26] the Lord, besides his counsel, besides
[1:08:28] his source. They don't. They turn it
[1:08:31] down because we have to find something.
[1:08:33] The reason they turn to another
[1:08:35] comforter is because you can't live
[1:08:37] without something to live for. Don't you
[1:08:39] ever believe, and let me lay this down
[1:08:41] here. Don't ever believe the lie that
[1:08:43] he's left us. And he left he's left us
[1:08:45] with no source to care for us or deliver
[1:08:48] us. I will not leave you when I go. I
[1:08:50] will send the Holy Spirit with you and
[1:08:52] it'll be so close. It'll be in you.
[1:08:54] That's how much he cared. Brother Bram
[1:08:56] keeps bringing this out. That's how much
[1:08:57] he cared and how close he would come.
[1:09:00] Not a distant God. He wants to tell us
[1:09:02] he won't be a distant God. He'll put his
[1:09:04] source within you, the comforter within
[1:09:06] you. That's why when we counsel someone
[1:09:10] with the Holy Ghost, it's a lot easier.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; It's a lot easier. You know why? Because
[1:09:19] God can pull from that seed that's been
[1:09:23] anointed on the inside of him. Many
[1:09:25] times the answer is laying right there,
[1:09:27] but it's covered over with all kinds of
[1:09:29] past all kind. I'm I'm convinced people
[1:09:32] can receive the Holy Ghost even at a
[1:09:34] very young age. And this is what happens
[1:09:36] with teenagers is that a lot of times
[1:09:38] the Lord really deals with them. They
[1:09:40] get a real change on the inside, but
[1:09:43] they're still a teenager.
[1:09:45] And the parents will think, "Oh, you got
[1:09:48] the Holy Ghost at camp. Oh, and they
[1:09:50] expect this full adult with these huge
[1:09:53] expectations." And when that kid goes
[1:09:56] through stages of young stages that he
[1:09:59] has to go through, they have too many
[1:10:00] expectations for them. even though God's
[1:10:02] done something for them.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I don't think I think it's a tragedy
[1:10:06] when parents do that.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And it's the same with us. We might have
[1:10:09] God has done something to us, but if we
[1:10:11] have a bunch of past baggage and we have
[1:10:14] a bunch of stuff that's hanging on us
[1:10:15] and the devil's defeating us, can you
[1:10:17] say amen? All we need to do is move that
[1:10:20] stuff away and get to that seed that's
[1:10:22] on the inside
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; to pull from there. Because a lot of
[1:10:26] times I'm talking to somebody and as
[1:10:28] that shadow moves away and God forgives
[1:10:31] them and all this stuff, then it's
[1:10:33] confessed, the devil's exposed, they
[1:10:35] start to get the answer themselves. I
[1:10:37] don't have to counsel the answer.
[1:10:38] They're speaking it themselves. Why? The
[1:10:40] Holy Ghost is in them.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; It's not the counselor's not trying to
[1:10:45] work here. That's the counselors today
[1:10:47] do. They're trying, okay, I'm going to
[1:10:48] have to get the answer. I'm going to
[1:10:50] have to get the answer of this person so
[1:10:51] they get delivered. No, no. Holy Ghost
[1:10:53] person, the answer is actually down
[1:10:55] here.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You just got to pull it out of them.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; So, it's a lot easier when someone has
[1:11:00] the Holy Ghost. If they don't, it's a
[1:11:01] lot more difficult because there's
[1:11:03] something missing. The comforter on the
[1:11:06] inside is missing. And you can help
[1:11:08] people. I I believe the the Lord can
[1:11:10] help anyone. But to have this real
[1:11:13] freedom and supernatural God to step in,
[1:11:16] uh it it takes something deeper. It
[1:11:18] takes those two omnipotence meeting. So
[1:11:20] God pulls out what's in the inside of
[1:11:22] them. Again, once you get all the past
[1:11:24] and the clouds in their spirit and their
[1:11:25] mind and that slowly starts to fade, you
[1:11:28] get to that seed that's in the inside.
[1:11:29] Not everyone will receive this though,
[1:11:31] brother Bram says.
[1:11:33] But the worst is
[1:11:36] we become we're built to seek other
[1:11:39] things
[1:11:40] that pacify
[1:11:42] or give us temporary comfort. It's
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; true. And he says it in Jeremiah 2, my
[1:11:49] people
[1:11:50] refuse me the fountain of living water,
[1:11:52] but then they hew out broken systems for
[1:11:55] themselves.
[1:11:57] So he's saying he we do this and we seek
[1:12:00] instead of seeking God thoroughly, we
[1:12:03] seek to pacify it and put it off, cover
[1:12:07] it up and to give us a temporary
[1:12:10] comfort, not an eternal, not a real
[1:12:12] change. Why do we do it? Probably the
[1:12:14] same reason Adam sewed fig leaves
[1:12:16] together.
[1:12:19] Religion is a covering. So we want to
[1:12:20] cover up what we're hiding.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; So he sewed fig leaves. That was his
[1:12:24] answer. I think brother Aaron was
[1:12:25] speaking on it here. He he he sewed fig
[1:12:28] leaves together because we got to do
[1:12:30] something. We've got to do something
[1:12:31] about our what we're hiding. We've got
[1:12:34] to cover it with something. We got to
[1:12:35] turn to something. We got to we got to
[1:12:37] relax into something. We've got to we
[1:12:40] got to cover up this shame and guilt
[1:12:41] we're feeling.
[1:12:44] So in our human nature, we will tend to
[1:12:46] sew fig leaves together. We got to do
[1:12:48] something. We got to escape into a
[1:12:50] relief and bring peace to us. Something
[1:12:52] that relieves us. Why?
[1:12:56] We won't in most cases just end it all
[1:12:59] like suicide. Most cases will keep going
[1:13:01] on but live with comfort from some else
[1:13:05] or someone else. You ever heard of
[1:13:07] codependency?
[1:13:09] We live from comfort from somebody else.
[1:13:11] We draw everything from someone else
[1:13:14] instead of from God.
[1:13:17] The real reason though is what the
[1:13:19] prophet gave. We're built that we must
[1:13:21] have something to live for. All of us in
[1:13:24] here tonight have something we want to
[1:13:26] live for. If we're losing that hope, you
[1:13:28] better pray and I'll pray for you. We
[1:13:30] don't want ever want to lose our hope
[1:13:31] and have something to live for.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to find it in this
[1:13:35] life. We want to find it in our Lord.
[1:13:37] That's right. this precious person that
[1:13:39] can come near us. That's what we're
[1:13:41] living for. I am glad I dedicated my
[1:13:44] life at 16 years old. He became what I
[1:13:47] was living life for. And it's still true
[1:13:49] tonight. I'm living for him.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever life dishes me out, I can go
[1:13:55] through it. But I'm living life with
[1:13:57] with a thrust, with a skip in my step.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; My grandchildren are fun. I love them to
[1:14:04] death. But my I don't live life for
[1:14:07] them. I'm living for the Lord.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Because if things can be taken away, I
[1:14:12] still have the Lord.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; The real reason is we have to have
[1:14:16] something to live for. So important.
[1:14:19] It's so important if we're counseling.
[1:14:22] Here's the point. Now, if people come in
[1:14:24] and they have a bunch of things that
[1:14:26] they're drawing for their comfort,
[1:14:28] sometimes in counseling, you have to
[1:14:30] dismantle all of their crutches that
[1:14:34] they have learned to lean on
[1:14:37] in order to get to a real answer from
[1:14:39] God. Part of counseling.
[1:14:42] Let's talk about what you're leaning on.
[1:14:44] Let's talk about your crutches. Let's
[1:14:46] talk about your comfort you're turning
[1:14:47] to. Should I mention some of them? Ah,
[1:14:50] we'll do it in the next service.
[1:14:53] saved you all. I'm going to read
[1:14:56] something Brother Brandham said. It's in
[1:14:58] the message. He mentioned so many
[1:14:59] things. But you know what? If if
[1:15:01] somebody is is there and they're ready
[1:15:04] to
[1:15:06] go before the Lord, you have to start
[1:15:08] talking about those crutches that you
[1:15:10] have created to lean on and dismantle
[1:15:15] some of those crutches.
[1:15:18] if they keep turning to their own
[1:15:19] man-made comfort, they may never see
[1:15:22] beyond and they go back to that crutch
[1:15:24] again.
[1:15:28] So, what are some of the things brother
[1:15:29] Brandon mentioned as we bring it to a
[1:15:31] close tonight? I haven't been very long.
[1:15:33] I want you to make note of that.
[1:15:35] What are some of the things that he
[1:15:37] mentioned so I don't get in trouble
[1:15:38] tonight. I'll just uh and I don't I'm
[1:15:41] just summarizing. So, after he says
[1:15:43] people turn to their own comfort, then
[1:15:45] what's some things he mentions? Okay.
[1:15:48] And I'm just summarized a few of them
[1:15:50] for you. There's a few more in there.
[1:15:51] There's details. I'm going to have you
[1:15:53] read the details around it, but just
[1:15:54] summarizing. Number one, he mentioned
[1:15:56] drinking. People turned to drinking. And
[1:15:59] he even mentioned a minister ministers
[1:16:01] in his own uh the healing revival
[1:16:04] turning to drink and actually being
[1:16:06] drunk in the pulpit. He said, "It's been
[1:16:08] it's been said. We've heard this and
[1:16:10] it's a tragedy." One one great
[1:16:12] minister's wife called him and said,
[1:16:13] "What do I do, Brother Brown? He's
[1:16:15] turned to another woman. what do I do?
[1:16:17] He said, "Man, I I don't know what to
[1:16:18] do." But that's what was happening. He's
[1:16:20] turning to another woman. Money, women,
[1:16:22] popularity is what ministers and men can
[1:16:24] fall by. And so, but drinking is what he
[1:16:27] mentioned. Read what he said about it.
[1:16:29] It's incredible what he says. He says,
[1:16:31] and we, he said, "That should never
[1:16:32] happen. It's a reproach. It's not a good
[1:16:34] thing." But he says, "That's no
[1:16:36] different." And he mentioned stealing
[1:16:37] and cheating and lusting after women.
[1:16:40] We'll criticize somebody who's drunk in
[1:16:42] the pulpit, but what about all the other
[1:16:43] things that people do? mention
[1:16:46] stealing, cheating, lusting after women.
[1:16:48] A high passion man is always in trouble
[1:16:51] looking at other women. He's high
[1:16:53] passion. He's that way. He leans that
[1:16:55] way. Hasn't brought it to the Lord.
[1:16:57] Hasn't been delivered. And and bring
[1:16:59] that that nature of being high passion.
[1:17:02] Bring it to the Lord. Brother Brandon
[1:17:04] mentioned, I feel so safe tonight just
[1:17:05] to mention things he said. He's
[1:17:07] mentioned smoking, which is legalized
[1:17:11] drug basically. How many legalized drugs
[1:17:13] do we have now today? Do people turn to
[1:17:16] drugs today as their comfort? Oh yeah.
[1:17:19] Smoking legalized uh drug. Number four,
[1:17:23] a woman drawing her comfort by being so
[1:17:27] well put together.
[1:17:31] That's what he said. So it's not drink,
[1:17:34] not just drinking and smoking and
[1:17:36] stealing and the men lusting after
[1:17:38] women. It's a woman that draws comfort
[1:17:42] by being so well put together in her
[1:17:44] figure,
[1:17:46] working hard. And if she's not well put
[1:17:48] together, she's working hard to be well
[1:17:50] put together, to get man's attention.
[1:17:54] What's she doing? She's not come to the
[1:17:56] comfort of the Holy Ghost. She's turning
[1:17:58] to something else to draw her comfort.
[1:18:01] She feels peace from that. That
[1:18:02] attention and that flirting from men
[1:18:04] gives her peace, but it's a false peace.
[1:18:09] working hard to be well put together to
[1:18:11] get man's attention even to get your
[1:18:13] husband's attention. Uh overly doing it.
[1:18:16] Uh brother Brandon says that you you're
[1:18:18] working so you the the tires will
[1:18:20] squeal. A man looks at you and the tires
[1:18:22] are squealing and they're whistling at
[1:18:24] you, flirting with you all just for
[1:18:27] attention. It gives a comfort but it's a
[1:18:30] false comfort. And you feel okay when it
[1:18:33] happens. You feel good when that
[1:18:34] happens. You feel to get that attention.
[1:18:36] And it makes you feel good.
[1:18:39] He mentions Satan mentioned the length
[1:18:42] of skirts getting shorter and shorter.
[1:18:45] Satan just keeps cutting off the length
[1:18:47] of the skirt, making it shorter and
[1:18:48] shorter. He mentions they take more and
[1:18:50] more of their clothes off every year,
[1:18:52] becoming almost naked on the beaches and
[1:18:54] stuff. Why does it keep going to more
[1:18:57] and more clothes off? Because why? Lust
[1:18:59] is never satisfied. And they not getting
[1:19:01] enough attention just by dressing a
[1:19:03] certain way. Take off more clothes. so
[1:19:06] they can get more attention.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It's feeding something.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And so he mentions a little statement
[1:19:16] here. He says in my summary, it's
[1:19:19] dressing to impress the other women at
[1:19:22] the church.
[1:19:24] Because he says after I say all this,
[1:19:26] many women will say, well, I don't do
[1:19:28] that. I don't undress at the beach. I
[1:19:31] don't you know I'm not doing all this
[1:19:33] other stuff of you know taking
[1:19:35] comforting I'm being so well put
[1:19:37] together. Many of them will say that
[1:19:40] well I don't do that but you so dress
[1:19:43] themselves in such an appeal till they
[1:19:46] try to be more modern than the women
[1:19:48] that's going to sit by them in church
[1:19:51] the next morning.
[1:19:54] It's so quiet in here. I think I'll just
[1:19:56] take a drink right now.
[1:19:59] See, I said I was closing and
[1:20:04] I am in just a couple of minutes.
[1:20:08] He said they dress themselves. This
[1:20:11] isn't out there trying to get a man's
[1:20:12] attention. This is they're actually
[1:20:14] dressing to impress someone else in the
[1:20:18] church.
[1:20:20] Now, this does don't just happen in
[1:20:22] church. You know that's not true. You
[1:20:23] know, it happens also on social media.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a worldwide web, which
[1:20:35] should scare you right away,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; right, brother Paul? You know, he's a
[1:20:39] he's a web guy and it guy all that those
[1:20:43] guys do. I don't know all that they do,
[1:20:45] but it's the worldwide web. That's the
[1:20:47] original aim of it. And so all of a
[1:20:50] sudden now that's a whole web of
[1:20:52] comparisons with one another.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Comparing your looks with their looks,
[1:20:57] comparing your car with their car,
[1:21:00] comparing your vacation with their
[1:21:02] vacation, comparing your figure with
[1:21:05] their figure. I'm glad I'm not on there
[1:21:07] cuz I would have lost my my figure would
[1:21:10] have been out of there, you know. Just
[1:21:11] don't even look. You know,
[1:21:14] it's it's a world of comparisons. It's a
[1:21:17] world of people feeding what they lack
[1:21:20] in their their confidence as a daughter
[1:21:24] and son of God.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Does it have some good things? We can
[1:21:29] see how our friends are doing. Yes. I
[1:21:32] mean, and we're using it for to put
[1:21:34] sermons and music and everything else.
[1:21:36] We always use technology for that. But
[1:21:38] the biggest thing that they say and even
[1:21:41] teenagers committing suicide, teenagers
[1:21:44] are saying themselves now in the world,
[1:21:46] not believers. They're saying this is
[1:21:48] not good for us because we we are
[1:21:51] comparing oursel with other identities
[1:21:53] and we're living in depression because
[1:21:55] of it.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Teenagers are saying that
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; they're in the worst depression because
[1:21:59] why? You've come into a world of
[1:22:01] comparing your life with everybody else.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:22:06] Brother Bram says they're trying to draw
[1:22:09] their comfort out of that to give them
[1:22:12] some peace.
[1:22:14] So he says, "You're sitting by the woman
[1:22:16] in church. You you you can dress a
[1:22:18] little bit more modern. You're going to
[1:22:19] sit by them in church the next morning,
[1:22:21] wear a better hat or better clothes
[1:22:23] because you can afford to do it." So now
[1:22:25] he's talking about money. Basically, you
[1:22:26] can afford to do it. You see, sin
[1:22:28] reaches way down and they try to find
[1:22:32] comfort by doing so. I'm skipping to the
[1:22:34] next one. He talks about making millions
[1:22:37] and millions politicians to buy
[1:22:39] themselves into a position like a
[1:22:41] politician and to make a great name for
[1:22:44] himself
[1:22:45] cheating of millions and millions of
[1:22:47] dollars. So I I found out of that that
[1:22:49] just trying to make tons of money in
[1:22:51] life only for the purpose of getting you
[1:22:54] in a higher position and making yourself
[1:22:57] more popular.
[1:22:59] It's drawing comfort.
[1:23:02] It's turning to something that you can
[1:23:03] draw comfort from. Money can do that.
[1:23:05] And then he says being a part of a
[1:23:07] social group or a social life. He uses
[1:23:10] the word social. We use social media and
[1:23:12] that's part of it. But people draw
[1:23:15] comfort as far as being part of a social
[1:23:17] group. I'm a part of this group. I'm a
[1:23:19] part of this church. I'm a part of this.
[1:23:21] And so the social life is a comfort
[1:23:23] people turn to. And he says little
[1:23:25] social clans. You like to be in a social
[1:23:28] clan. A little click. So they can say,
[1:23:30] brother Bram says, we're better than the
[1:23:32] next group. That's why they're drawn to
[1:23:34] comfort that if I'm a part of a social
[1:23:36] clan and a certain one, they draw
[1:23:38] comfort that they can say we're a little
[1:23:41] better than the next group.
[1:23:46] Praise the Lord. Let's pray that
[1:23:48] churches don't keep doing this.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; We got our church and it's the happening
[1:23:54] thing and it's, you know, we're on the
[1:23:56] map now.
[1:23:58] We're a little bit better better than
[1:23:59] the other group. We're a lot better than
[1:24:00] the other group. God have mercy on that
[1:24:02] carnality. God have mercy that's come
[1:24:04] into our ranks in the message. What a
[1:24:06] shame.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; None of this stuff. You know what it's
[1:24:09] people drawing their comfort. Preachers
[1:24:11] and different ones from some pride or
[1:24:13] from some following or your church is
[1:24:15] getting big and it's all just carnal
[1:24:17] drawing your comfort. that preacher
[1:24:19] probably many times some of those
[1:24:20] preachers will preach against a woman
[1:24:22] that's wearing a a skinny skirt or
[1:24:24] preach against someone being naked or
[1:24:26] preach against but what about his own
[1:24:28] pride to have that motive that I want to
[1:24:30] be on the map and I want to be popular
[1:24:32] and our church is better than the rest
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; it's drawn your comfort out of the wrong
[1:24:36] thing
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; all of this is to try to get a comfort
[1:24:41] so so and and and see if someone cares
[1:24:45] and see if someone would care for them
[1:24:47] I'm just word it this
[1:24:49] if someone would care for me. It's all
[1:24:51] about feeling a need to for someone to
[1:24:53] care. I need attention. I'm not getting
[1:24:55] it. And I choose these other things to
[1:24:58] soothe to soothe my heart and give me
[1:25:00] peace. And that's why I read that
[1:25:04] scripture and I'm closing that God's
[1:25:07] heart was hurt when he said, "They have
[1:25:08] forsaken me, the fountain of living
[1:25:10] waters, and hewed them out broken
[1:25:12] sistns." We always do it instead of come
[1:25:16] to the Lord. You know, we give a baby a
[1:25:19] pacifier
[1:25:21] as a replacement to soothe them,
[1:25:26] but it's not the real thing. I'm
[1:25:29] watching a lot of grandb babies and they
[1:25:31] make that transition that only goes so
[1:25:33] long. The pacifier only works so long.
[1:25:37] You may introduce it. You may try to
[1:25:39] keep it as long going as long. But what
[1:25:41] happens eventually is you keep faking
[1:25:43] the baby out. But eventually the baby
[1:25:46] gets smart. You know why get smart?
[1:25:48] Because he realized there's no substance
[1:25:50] coming out of this pacifier. There's no
[1:25:53] meat. If they could talk, they say,
[1:25:55] "Hey, where's the beef?"
[1:25:58] Right?
[1:26:00] So we give it to them to it's a
[1:26:02] replacement and they they they they
[1:26:07] duped by us because they start to settle
[1:26:09] down into that pacifier and feel
[1:26:11] soothed. It's called a soother. Soother
[1:26:14] pacifi and they just but after a while
[1:26:16] they catch on.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; We need to catch on
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; to the emptiness in our pacifiers that
[1:26:23] we keep going to.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen. We need to quit being
[1:26:27] babies in the Lord and quit turning to
[1:26:30] our pacifiers to soothe our spirit.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; We need to be saying, "Where's the
[1:26:35] beef?" When you come to church, where's
[1:26:38] the beef? I got to eat. Can you say
[1:26:39] amen? And brother Bram says, "Al Shadi,
[1:26:41] the double- breasted one." That's what
[1:26:43] he called it. We nurse on the promises
[1:26:45] of God. We don't want no pacifier. We
[1:26:48] got to have the word of God.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; We got to feed on the word of God.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; But just like that baby, he gives into
[1:26:54] that. But after a while, he begins to
[1:26:56] cry and that phases out because he has
[1:26:59] to grow and he learns that he's not
[1:27:02] truly satisfied with the pacifier. When
[1:27:04] are we going to learn as Christians?
[1:27:07] When is Israel, the Lord was saying,
[1:27:09] you're going to learn that your broken
[1:27:11] systems are broken. They don't hold any
[1:27:13] water. There's no fulfillment. There's
[1:27:15] no satisfaction in them. When will you
[1:27:18] learn? Come to me. And brother Bram says
[1:27:20] that's a wellspring. I'm going to go
[1:27:21] into a series in a few weeks, a
[1:27:23] wellspring. I want to go into the deep
[1:27:25] thirst within us. He said that artisian
[1:27:27] well, it's not a broken sister. It comes
[1:27:30] from way down deep in the earth and it's
[1:27:32] springing out. God is an artisian well.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; But we heal out broken sistns that get
[1:27:38] the rain water off of the barn with all
[1:27:41] kinds of bugs in it.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And after a while, when are we going to
[1:27:44] say like the baby, "This isn't
[1:27:46] satisfying anymore. I'm spitting this
[1:27:49] pacifier out
[1:27:52] until I scream and get the real thing.
[1:27:55] And boy, have I ever heard them do some
[1:27:57] screaming.
[1:27:59] We still got Christians trying
[1:28:00] pacifiers,
[1:28:02] carrying around their pacis.
[1:28:06] Didn't they even a few years ago have
[1:28:08] this like 20 years ago they were
[1:28:10] everybody was starting to suck their
[1:28:11] thumb again. Teenagers were sucking
[1:28:13] their thumb and adults were sucking
[1:28:16] their thumb.
[1:28:20] What was that all about? I don't I was I
[1:28:23] I remember I was going into Walmart and
[1:28:24] the teenagers walking through sucking
[1:28:26] their thumb, you know, pacifier in their
[1:28:29] mouth.
[1:28:31] When are we going to grow up into the
[1:28:33] things of God and stop turning to other
[1:28:36] things for our comfort?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; When are we going to run to the true
[1:28:40] fountain if we really care? We have to
[1:28:43] be willing to take a take a real deep
[1:28:46] look at all of the replacements
[1:28:51] that we have put in our life to draw our
[1:28:54] peace and our comfort from.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:29:08] Whatever
[1:29:09] it takes
[1:29:12] to draw closer to you, Lord,
[1:29:16] that's what
[1:29:18] I'll be willing to do
[1:29:23] for whatever it takes
[1:29:28] for my will to break.
[1:29:32] That's what I'll be willing
[1:29:38] to do
[1:29:42] for whatever.
[1:29:46] Give me a key, brother Michael.
[1:29:50] Just give me something there.
[1:29:53] Ever it takes to draw closer
[1:29:59] to you, Lord. Oh, that's what I'll be
[1:30:04] willing
[1:30:06] to do.
[1:30:09] Yes, Lord.
[1:30:11] For whatever
[1:30:14] it takes
[1:30:16] for my will to break. Oh,
[1:30:22] that's what I'll be willing
[1:30:27] to do. Can we have the first verse?
[1:30:32] First verse. Do we have one there?
[1:30:36] For whatever
[1:30:39] it takes
[1:30:41] to draw closer
[1:30:44] to you, Lord.
[1:30:47] That's what I'll be willing
[1:30:51] to do
[1:30:56] for whatever
[1:30:59] it takes. Yes, Lord. for my will
[1:31:04] to pray. Oh,
[1:31:06] that's what I'll be willing
[1:31:11] to do.
[1:31:13] I'll trade sunshine. I'll trade sunshine
[1:31:18] for rain,
[1:31:21] comfort,
[1:31:23] for payment.
[1:31:25] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:34] for whatever
[1:31:37] it takes
[1:31:39] for my will to break.
[1:31:44] That's what I'll be willing
[1:31:48] to do. Sing that one more time. I'll
[1:31:51] trade sunshine. I'll trade sunshine.
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:58] comfort.
[1:32:01] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. That's what I'll
[1:32:05] be willing
[1:32:07] to do
[1:32:11] for whatever
[1:32:14] it takes
[1:32:16] for my will to bring.
[1:32:21] That's what I'll be willing
[1:32:26] to do.
[1:32:29] Can we pray together tonight? You just
[1:32:31] lay your hands on one another. Father,
[1:32:34] we're so grateful, Lord, for the grace
[1:32:36] of God in your word. It's extended to
[1:32:38] us. Lord, your word is has grace in it,
[1:32:42] the headstone come forth with grace,
[1:32:45] cryings of grace, grace unto it. Lord,
[1:32:48] whenever you show us the way plainly,
[1:32:50] the provided way that you have in this
[1:32:52] day, Lord, we always sense that your
[1:32:54] grace is speaking to us and leading us
[1:32:56] and guiding us. Help the people, Lord,
[1:32:59] to see that you really do care for every
[1:33:01] situation of our life. You care to take
[1:33:04] the most broken situations and mend them
[1:33:06] and heal them, Lord, to make them better
[1:33:09] again, Father. Not just put a band-aid
[1:33:11] on it, Lord. You bring true healing. Let
[1:33:14] the people know that you care so much,
[1:33:16] Lord, that you want to change it by your
[1:33:18] supernatural hand. And then, Lord, could
[1:33:21] we offer up a a heart that's soft before
[1:33:24] you, that we show you, Lord, we care. We
[1:33:27] care about getting deliverance. We care
[1:33:29] about getting help. Help us as well,
[1:33:31] Lord, and give us a tender heart toward
[1:33:33] you. And Lord, we sing the song,
[1:33:35] whatever it takes tonight. May we be
[1:33:38] willing to lay everything on the table,
[1:33:40] Lord, before you, God, not hide anything
[1:33:42] from you and that you could come and
[1:33:44] have full uh sway in our lives, Lord.
[1:33:49] Sons of God, led by the spirit of God on
[1:33:52] a daily basis, help us, Lord. Take all
[1:33:55] of our bitterness out, Lord. Wash away,
[1:33:57] Lord, our sin and pain, and maybe it's
[1:34:01] from the past. Whatever it is, just wash
[1:34:03] it from us, Lord. God, may we rise as
[1:34:06] lights in this hour, Lord, of the
[1:34:09] testimony of how close a Christian can
[1:34:12] become to the real victorious life. This
[1:34:16] is the hour for it, Lord. And we pray
[1:34:18] you'll do it in my life. We pray you'll
[1:34:20] do it in these people's lives. Do it in
[1:34:22] the bride around the world. I pray,
[1:34:24] Father, as we commit
[1:34:28] these things to you in Jesus name.
[1:34:32] Amen. Everybody said, "Amen.
[1:34:35] Well, I keep coming back to the well of
[1:34:38] grace. Great is its power. Sweet is its
[1:34:43] taste. Whenever temptation is smile, I
[1:34:47] face. Oh, I keep coming back to the
[1:34:50] well. Well, I keep coming back to the
[1:34:54] well of grace. Great is it power. Sweet
[1:34:59] is it taste. Whenever temptations and
[1:35:02] trials I face, I keep coming back to the
[1:35:06] well. Well, I keep coming back to the
[1:35:10] well of grace. Great is the power. Sweet
[1:35:14] is the taste. Whenever temptation and
[1:35:18] trials I face, I keep coming back to the
[1:35:22] well.
[1:35:24] Blessed is the fountain in a barren land
[1:35:27] that satisfies the thirst of the inner
[1:35:30] man. No better place could be found to
[1:35:34] dwell. Amen. Oh, won't you come to the
[1:35:37] well? Well, I keep coming back to the
[1:35:41] well of grace. Help us, Lord, to keep
[1:35:44] coming back to you. Oh, whenever
[1:35:47] temptation and trials are, oh, I keep
[1:35:51] coming back to you. The second verse.
[1:35:54] Jesus made a well at Calvary
[1:35:58] for healing, cleansing at victory. How
[1:36:01] it's joy overflows. No tongue can tell.

[1:36:13] Great is his power. Sweet is his. In
[1:36:17] every temptation and trials I face, I
[1:36:21] keep coming back to the well. One more
[1:36:24] time. I keep coming back to the well of
[1:36:27] grace. The greatest
[1:36:34] trials I face, I'll keep coming back to
[1:36:37] the west.
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:40] God bless you. Christian love tonight,
[1:36:42] saints. I know many of you got to get
[1:36:43] back home. And if you need any special
[1:36:45] prayer, just come forward. And I just
[1:36:47] like to ask you who would commit to
[1:36:49] listening or reading that sermon. He
[1:36:51] cares. Do you care as we get back into
[1:36:53] this study a little bit? All right. I
[1:36:55] appreciate that you lifted your hand. So
[1:36:57] I trust you to do it when you get time
[1:36:59] in this busy life. But set that aside.
[1:37:01] Listen to that. I believe you get some
[1:37:03] good things in there. Hopefully some
[1:37:04] more things. Even though what I'm
[1:37:06] preaching, I believe it. It's a
[1:37:07] principle. He cares. Do you care? And
[1:37:09] God's trying to bring that together for
[1:37:11] us. So we know as Christians how to face
[1:37:14] every trial of life and the answer is to
[1:37:16] coming back to the well. That's the
[1:37:18] answer every time. God bless you
[1:37:19] Christian friend. God be with you.
[1:37:22] You're dismissed. I keep coming back to
[1:37:25] the well of grace. Great is it power.
[1:37:29] Sweet is it taste. No manation
[1:37:33] and trials I face
[1:37:36] back to the well.
[1:37:38] Blessed is the fountain in a barren land
[1:37:42] who satisfies the thirst of the inner
[1:37:44] man. No better place can be found to
[1:37:48] dwell. Oh, won't you come to the well?
[1:37:52] Well, I keep coming back to the well of
[1:37:55] grace. Great is it power, sweet is it
[1:37:59] taste whenever temptation and trials I
[1:38:03] f. We go up one. Second verse.
[1:38:07] Jesus made a well at Calvary
[1:38:11] for healing, cleansing, and victory. How
[1:38:14] it's joy overflows. No tongue can tell.
[1:38:18] I thank God for the well. Oh, I keep
[1:38:22] coming back to the well of grace. Great
[1:38:26] is his power. Sweet is his taste. Never
[1:38:29] temptation and trials I face. Oh, look
[1:38:34] the well. Well, Jesus made a well at
[1:38:37] Calvary.

[1:39:05] coming back.
