[3:52] Acts chapter 2 and verse 41 it says then
[3:56] they that gladly received his word were
[3:59] baptized and the same day they were
[4:02] added unto them three thousand souls and
[4:04] they continued steadfastly in the
[4:05] apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in
[4:08] Breaking of bread and in prayers and
[4:10] fear Came Upon every soul and Many
[4:12] Wonders and signs were done by the
[4:15] apostles and all that believe were
[4:17] together and had all things common and
[4:21] sold their possessions and goods
[4:22] imparted them to all men as every man
[4:25] had need notice the the Holy Ghost
[4:29] working in the church one of the things
[4:31] that brought out is they became very
[4:33] sensitive and aware of another man's
[4:35] needs in other words the selfishness had
[4:37] gone away and they became become aware
[4:40] of the needs within their own body and
[4:42] other needs and begin to do things to
[4:44] try to help in those needs whatever they
[4:46] could
[4:46] and they continuing daily with one
[4:48] Accord in the temple and breaking bread
[4:50] from house to house because there was no
[4:53] church buildings at that time for the
[4:54] Believers they broke bread from house to
[4:57] house and did eat their meat with
[4:58] gladness and singleness of heart
[5:00] praising God having favor with all the
[5:03] people and the Lord added to the church
[5:05] daily such it should be saved sounds all
[5:08] positive to me can you say mom and then
[5:10] Acts chapter 4 I think I was reading as
[5:13] well Acts chapter 4 and verse 32 verses
[5:17] 31 and when they had prayed the place
[5:19] was shaken where they were assembled
[5:21] together and they were all filled with
[5:23] the Holy Ghost and they spake with the
[5:24] word the word of God with boldness and
[5:26] The Malt of the multitude of them that
[5:29] believed were of one heart and of one
[5:31] Soul neither said any of them that all
[5:33] the things which he possessed was his
[5:35] own but they had all things common and
[5:37] with great power gave the apostles
[5:39] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[5:42] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[5:46] so this as we look at these things in
[5:49] the book of Acts we see the first
[5:51] account of relationships not not only
[5:54] with God relationship with God and with
[5:57] others and you know from the series that
[5:59] everything that that was lost in the
[6:02] Garden of Eden now has been restored and
[6:04] man has been restored back that
[6:06] everything he lost besides his new body
[6:08] he's received everything back again and
[6:11] so now we have this Oneness with God now
[6:14] that they hadn't had for all these
[6:17] thousands of years now they've come back
[6:19] into it by the Holy Spirit coming in
[6:21] them they've become one it wasn't a
[6:23] religion it wasn't rules it wasn't a
[6:27] duty it wasn't some new religion that
[6:29] come along it was completely separate
[6:31] than religion it was an internal work of
[6:34] the Holy Spirit coming in the soul the
[6:36] control tower and he himself came in so
[6:39] that by one Spirit they became one with
[6:41] God again so that's totally different
[6:44] than a mental exercise or a denominator
[6:46] Nation or a Duty or a code of ethics to
[6:49] live by it goes beyond any of that and
[6:52] should never be associated with that
[6:54] it's the power of God coming into the
[6:56] vigil and he at that moment comes in
[6:59] Oneness with God and there's no man can
[7:01] take that away
[7:03] and so I want to emphasize tonight
[7:05] relationship over rules relationship
[7:08] over uh religion of course and so they
[7:12] had come after being redeemed into a
[7:14] real relationship with God here that
[7:16] they hadn't experienced since the Garden
[7:17] of Eden quite this way people have been
[7:19] anointed prophets had come the people
[7:22] had been blessed well there's some
[7:23] healed there's many powerful things that
[7:25] took place but they had never had
[7:27] relationship like this with God for
[7:30] thousands of years until this Upper Room
[7:32] when all of a sudden everything that was
[7:35] lost from Adam and Eve come back again
[7:36] that's a pretty powerful thing so in the
[7:39] book of Acts that we read here this kind
[7:42] of the first window that we have of the
[7:44] book of Acts church and what it looked
[7:46] like and I'm emphasizing the
[7:48] relationship part but there are many
[7:49] things that God did in the book of Acts
[7:51] and all of them none of them are to be
[7:54] cast aside we're we're we should have
[7:57] the word working in our lives and the
[7:59] spirit work in our lives that even
[8:01] personally we should be able to write a
[8:03] book of Acts in our lives it may not be
[8:06] as big as this book maybe yours is but
[8:09] nevertheless there should be acts of God
[8:11] in your life that you could write a
[8:13] story at the end of all this and if
[8:15] there was a future if there was a future
[8:17] generation they could read your story
[8:19] and and have a book of Acts from your
[8:22] life in purpose in life in spirit and
[8:26] envision everything had been restored
[8:28] back from Eden again except a new body
[8:31] they were in every way purpose Vision
[8:33] life and spirit they were every way
[8:36] restored back to the Garden of Eden
[8:37] again in spirit and so it's the same
[8:41] today and we should know then that it
[8:44] did not take very long
[8:46] uh until the Antichrist Spirit began to
[8:50] come into those days of the book of Acts
[8:52] and that shouldn't surprise us because
[8:54] Satan entered the Oneness with Adam and
[8:57] Eve right away and destroyed their
[8:59] Oneness so now when you have the same
[9:01] Oneness it shouldn't be a surprise that
[9:04] Satan comes in in the early church and
[9:07] begins to bring that Antichrist spirit
[9:09] and begins to do and one way we know
[9:11] it's the Antichrist spirit it's just
[9:13] working against what's happening in the
[9:15] church it's doing something opposite can
[9:18] you say Amen it's presenting a different
[9:20] a different way to God than coming
[9:22] through the Holy Ghost
[9:24] and that's how we know that the
[9:25] Antichrist spirit is working is that
[9:27] when you see this love when you see this
[9:30] Fellowship when you see this coronia
[9:32] when you see this this pureness this
[9:35] this guileless atmosphere going on with
[9:39] this this uh speaking in uh tongues that
[9:42] uh they heard them in their own language
[9:44] when you see the spirit making them like
[9:46] drunk men when you see all of this going
[9:48] on then then Satan is coming on the
[9:51] scene because his agenda is to stop this
[9:54] and present another gospel so we know if
[9:58] you have good things going on in church
[9:59] and the spirit is moving and God's doing
[10:02] things and there's Harmony and Oneness
[10:04] and love get ready for the Antichrist
[10:07] spirit
[10:09] amen you're going to fight it can you
[10:10] say man you're going to fight this it's
[10:12] going to be a battle when they come into
[10:13] the promised land that's when their
[10:15] battles began and people say it's not
[10:17] fair it's not fair that all these things
[10:19] are happening to me in all this battle
[10:20] but you what you should say is if you're
[10:23] having all these trials then you're
[10:25] probably possessing some land
[10:28] you're probably gaining ground because
[10:30] as you gain more ground the battle
[10:33] intensifies from your enemy more trials
[10:37] no more pressures because he can't stand
[10:39] Oneness and here in the early church he
[10:41] starts to turn against it and starts to
[10:43] come in an antichrist Spirit we're not
[10:44] going to talk a lot about that but it is
[10:46] relevant to say this that when you see
[10:49] the good things of God coming like they
[10:52] did at the book of Acts get ready for
[10:54] the Antichrist Spirit to come real close
[10:56] and to work against it when it manifests
[10:59] everything contrary to this new
[11:02] relationship the Antichrist spirit will
[11:03] manifest everything contrary to this new
[11:05] relationship they had this new Oneness
[11:07] with God is what was produced in not
[11:09] only Miracles and signs and wonders but
[11:12] it produced the right relationship with
[11:14] God the right relationship with
[11:16] Believers the right relationship with
[11:18] families the relationship with God is
[11:21] what they had first it was a perfect
[11:23] relation Jack relationship back with him
[11:25] again and I want to just say now this
[11:28] relationship in the book of Acts that
[11:30] had had not been there for thousands of
[11:33] years and now they come out of the upper
[11:35] room with this this this my spirit this
[11:38] connection with God that they never had
[11:41] since the book of Eden when this began
[11:44] this relationship was before they had a
[11:48] church to Worship in
[11:51] can I say it relationship is before
[11:54] attending church
[11:57] because these guys didn't have a church
[11:59] to go to you ought to praise the Lord
[12:00] tonight you have a church to go to
[12:02] you ought to go to it can you say mine
[12:05] but you see now this this relationship
[12:08] didn't require to have a church building
[12:14] this relationship in the book of Acts
[12:16] was before Worship in church it was
[12:19] before church order came
[12:22] Paul brought Church order later so they
[12:24] had relationship before they had Church
[12:26] order oh can I get an amen tonight I'm
[12:29] not dumping out Church order I'm glad
[12:31] for it but I'm telling you the book of
[12:33] Acts had relationship before they had
[12:35] Church order it was about relationship
[12:37] and that's it a simple relationship by
[12:40] spirit and Oneness with God before any
[12:43] of that was said before any of it they
[12:45] had relationship
[12:49] before Paul broke into the mystery of
[12:51] Christ in the book of Ephesians before
[12:53] Paul broke down the Old Testament
[12:55] shadows and explored the Christ revealed
[12:58] in the Old Testament before the riches
[13:00] of the Revelation the theophany bodies
[13:01] when he said if this Earthly Tabernacle
[13:04] be destroyed we have one waiting on the
[13:06] other side before all of those
[13:07] Revelations the thing before those
[13:09] Revelations was relationship with God by
[13:12] the Holy Ghost
[13:14] so I tell you today what's more
[13:15] important what's most important all
[13:17] that's important but relationship is
[13:19] more important
[13:21] didn't Paul say though I understand all
[13:24] Mysteries
[13:26] though I understand how to give my body
[13:28] to be burned and I feed the poor and I
[13:31] give and I do all those things and I
[13:33] understand all the Mysteries and yet I
[13:36] can still be locking the main thing
[13:38] somebody say praise the Lord
[13:41] so now before uh before Paul preached
[13:45] all these things before the riches of
[13:47] the Revelation before all this had to be
[13:50] a relationship first by the Holy Ghost
[13:52] and all of that was important but never
[13:55] to be put before relationship in
[13:58] Simplicity before the book of Acts
[14:00] Church could produce anything that they
[14:03] did they each one had to come into
[14:06] relationship by the Oneness of the
[14:09] spirit as a matter of fact you could
[14:11] never produce the book of Acts church
[14:13] and what they manifested without the
[14:16] relationship first now how does Satan
[14:19] duplicate the signs the Wonders the
[14:21] Miracles which he can can you say amen
[14:23] he can work through their things and and
[14:25] and you see then then to me I've always
[14:28] viewed it this way is Satan is watching
[14:30] what's going on because remember this is
[14:31] the first time for thousands of years
[14:33] he's seen this type of spirit in the
[14:36] people like this and he's just an
[14:38] observer he's not a Creator and he
[14:40] always tries to duplicate or or or to
[14:43] mess up what God is doing or to try to
[14:44] give an alternate alternative route than
[14:47] the Holy Ghost so he's watching them
[14:49] come out of the room they're acting like
[14:51] drunk men I mean he remembered David and
[14:53] David got happened he danced and before
[14:55] the ark coming in so he knows some happy
[14:57] people that got happy about the Lord but
[15:00] never was it quite like this and then he
[15:01] watched them hearing the other nations
[15:03] hearing them in their own language as
[15:05] they glorified God so Satan every time
[15:08] he observes things and he was there
[15:10] observing it all every time he's there
[15:12] he's always thinking how can I
[15:15] counterfeit this
[15:18] how can I bring uh something that's
[15:22] similar to it that can distract the
[15:25] people from the real thing
[15:27] what is it all about keeping men and
[15:31] women from the real thing
[15:34] have them dress upright or have them go
[15:38] to church or have them burn a candle all
[15:40] of religious systems Satan has been
[15:43] behind the systems not the people but
[15:45] behind systems to misdirect the people
[15:48] away from one thing the relationship of
[15:51] the Holy Ghost in the upper room people
[15:53] we don't want to present a code we don't
[15:54] want to say if you just do this if
[15:56] you're just dressed this way if you act
[15:57] this way if you just come to church and
[15:59] be here every service then you're okay
[16:00] we don't want to deceive people like
[16:02] that we want the Holy Spirit to come
[16:04] down and he makes a personal connection
[16:06] with them and they turn their lives over
[16:08] and there's a relationship when they
[16:09] walk out the door they may not be
[16:11] dressing all right yet they might
[16:13] understand everything brother Paul
[16:14] preached but they've come into a
[16:16] relationship with God he can talk to
[16:18] them he can they can talk back to him
[16:21] there's a relationship started and
[16:24] that's what we want
[16:26] not just some phony something but a real
[16:28] they've entered into I'm not just
[16:31] talking to God through my parents now or
[16:33] saying prayers when I talk to them I
[16:35] know that I'm in relationship with him
[16:36] by the Holy Ghost if we skip over the
[16:38] relationship part
[16:40] looking at the relationship of a simple
[16:42] redeemed people in the book of Acts as I
[16:45] said before church order before all
[16:47] these things and but then we see Paul
[16:50] says later in second Corinthians 11
[16:52] verse 3 but I fear lest by any means as
[16:56] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[16:59] subtility so your mind should be
[17:01] corrupted
[17:03] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[17:07] so now the early church comes out of the
[17:09] upper room we go through the book of
[17:10] Acts and it's early now in the second
[17:12] book of Corinthians that we see Paul
[17:15] sharing his fear and his burden as the
[17:18] answer Christ comes in what would be his
[17:21] work to complicate things to grab ahold
[17:24] of
[17:25] the do's and don'ts and for people to
[17:29] skip the relationship
[17:31] and grab a hold of the do's and don'ts
[17:34] and complicate salvation and complicate
[17:37] the Simplicity of relationship and come
[17:39] he's in he said who's who will be doing
[17:42] it the same serpent that talked to Eve
[17:45] would complicate and take them from the
[17:47] Simplicity of this Oneness and this
[17:49] relationship with God men preachers
[17:52] would be used of Satan to complicate the
[17:55] Simplicity in Jesus Christ
[17:58] and did Satan do it yes he did
[18:02] yes he did messing with the people's
[18:04] minds and to me we're we're reading the
[18:08] Simplicity of a relationship with Jesus
[18:11] Christ in the early church
[18:15] it's got in Simplicity it's the
[18:16] Simplicity of Christ
[18:18] and that spoils down to a true Holy
[18:21] Ghost Oneness relationship
[18:24] with God yourself
[18:27] I fear less by any means some some Force
[18:30] begins to take you away from that
[18:33] Simplicity because it all starts with a
[18:35] relationship and it should end with
[18:37] relationships Simplicity in Christ is
[18:39] not dumping out revelation
[18:41] and further Revelation Simplicity of
[18:44] Christ is not stopping to grow to full
[18:46] knowledge of the word of God
[18:48] can you say Amen but it's knowing the
[18:51] one in me and in you that can never
[18:53] change whether I can understand it all
[18:56] or not when I'm into relationship with
[18:59] God and I know that I know that I know
[19:02] that I have it and God doesn't say
[19:04] you're going to lose it if you don't
[19:06] understand everything by next week
[19:11] I'm going to give you a year and if you
[19:12] don't catch all of these Seven Seals
[19:14] you're done in my relationship that's
[19:16] not God at all
[19:18] if you have a Oneness Holy Ghost
[19:19] relationship listen you the devil cannot
[19:22] take that away from you
[19:24] nothing can take that away from you you
[19:27] may sit in services and say I I don't
[19:29] have a clue what that guy is saying and
[19:31] then everyone said you catch that
[19:32] Revelation then it grows then it grows
[19:34] and it is and that's all fine but newer
[19:36] converts sometimes they may not have a
[19:38] clue but there's something deeper
[19:39] working in them and they say I don't
[19:41] know a lot but I know I come into a
[19:43] relationship with God I know I got the
[19:45] Holy Spirit I know I got the a matter
[19:47] down the inside and the mind is saying I
[19:51] don't mind the thing I don't understand
[19:52] but the soul is saying Amen to the word
[19:55] of God
[19:56] because you can't be saying amen from
[19:58] the soul unless you got the amen or down
[20:00] there
[20:02] Moses my servant is dead and he makes a
[20:04] personal connection with Joshua and says
[20:07] as I was in Moses I will be with you and
[20:10] it's a personal relationship with Joshua
[20:12] it was going to be I'm just going to try
[20:13] to duplicate what Moses did that wasn't
[20:15] it God said I'll be with you like I was
[20:18] with Moses
[20:20] because God doesn't say I'm going to go
[20:21] through just I'm going to go through
[20:23] Moses still even though he's dead I'm
[20:25] going to keep using him and you're just
[20:27] supposed to no no no no God's about
[20:29] relationship I want a personal
[20:31] relationship with Joshua and those that
[20:33] are going in the Promised Land
[20:35] I want to tell you that every place your
[20:37] foot your foot not Moses foot every foot
[20:40] your foot shall go it'll be possession
[20:43] to you and you'll take the left acts 15
[20:45] verse 1.
[20:47] so now and I want to talk about the
[20:49] positive relationship in the book of
[20:50] Acts with God and with one another we're
[20:52] going to get to a lot of that but I just
[20:54] want to stop and look at this Antichrist
[20:56] spirit that enters the book of Acts
[20:57] right away through men and it says and
[21:00] certain men everybody remember that now
[21:02] certain men
[21:05] which came down from Judea taught the
[21:08] Brethren and said except you be
[21:10] circumcised after the manner of Moses
[21:12] you cannot be saved now they're coming
[21:14] to new Christians that had come to the
[21:16] message of the hour circumcision had had
[21:19] been lost because God was bringing the
[21:22] true circumcision of the soul of the
[21:24] Holy Ghost they didn't understand that
[21:25] they came from being Pharisees but they
[21:28] believed and came in to the message
[21:31] certain men it didn't come from Satan on
[21:34] a cloud somewhere it was through
[21:35] preachers that actually traveled down to
[21:38] these new converts and said you know
[21:39] what praise the Lord you came to God and
[21:42] you're feeling this uh great Revival and
[21:46] God's changed you but except you be
[21:48] circumcised after the matter of Moses
[21:50] you cannot be saved
[21:52] these are guys that come in to the
[21:54] message of the hour
[21:56] and they're bringing their past up
[22:00] and misleading these new converts
[22:04] when therefore Moses Paul and Barnabas
[22:06] had no small dissension and disputation
[22:08] with them they determined that Paul and
[22:10] bartimus and certain other of them
[22:11] should go to Jerusalem under the
[22:12] apostles and Elders about this question
[22:14] and being brought on their way by the
[22:16] church they passed through fanis and
[22:18] Samaria declaring the conversion of the
[22:20] Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto
[22:22] all the brethren and when they were come
[22:24] to Jerusalem they were received at the
[22:26] church and of the Apostles and Elders
[22:27] all the work Paul and Barnabas did it's
[22:29] a great work of the Lord going to the
[22:30] Gentiles and they the church received
[22:33] them the church Elders received them
[22:34] they declared all things that God had
[22:36] done with them but there arose up
[22:38] certain of the sect of the Pharisees now
[22:42] I want you to notice this now
[22:44] certain of the sect of Pharisees which
[22:48] believed
[22:50] so already in the church you have those
[22:54] that don't have the Holy Ghost that
[22:56] carried over and it says they believed
[22:58] and that's why just believing from the
[23:00] intellect is not good enough
[23:02] believing from the heart is what you
[23:04] need and so these men come into the
[23:07] church and they were a sect of the
[23:08] Pharisees which was the religion they
[23:10] came from in the past when you come to
[23:12] the Lord you've got to be washed of all
[23:15] those former things can you say amen and
[23:17] say Lord what is your truth what is
[23:19] being what is being held back from me my
[23:21] brother and sister who may be listening
[23:23] here I don't say this to be mean but you
[23:25] better look at your life because those
[23:27] systems can hold you back like these and
[23:30] you hold on to old traditions that have
[23:32] been taught to you by a denomination and
[23:35] it may not be the truth and so these
[23:38] certain of the sect of the Pharisees
[23:40] which believed so they were amongst the
[23:42] crowd of the new message Believers
[23:44] saying that it was needful to circumcise
[23:46] them and to command them to keep the law
[23:48] of Moses and the apostles and Elders
[23:50] came together to consider this matter
[23:51] and when there had been much disputing
[23:53] Peter rose up and said unto them men and
[23:56] Brethren you know how God that a good
[23:58] while ago God made Choice Among Us that
[24:00] the Gentiles by the mouth should hear
[24:01] the word of the Gospel when believed and
[24:03] God which knoweth the hearts bear them
[24:05] witness giving them the Holy Ghost even
[24:07] as he did unto us Brothers You've got to
[24:09] admit without your help they received
[24:12] the same Holy Ghost the Gentiles did is
[24:14] what we got you know what he's saying
[24:17] that's the end of the story
[24:19] you don't complicate it any more than
[24:22] that
[24:23] there's no dispute there's no arguing
[24:25] there's no putting circumcision on this
[24:27] because what's the proof they come into
[24:30] relationship without any of you
[24:36] I wonder if that's the way Peter said it
[24:38] that day probably not
[24:40] hey you guys it's a settled argument
[24:43] they've got the same thing we've got
[24:45] and you didn't have to they didn't have
[24:47] to be circumcised to get it
[24:50] so what are you trying to teach these
[24:52] new converts
[24:56] and God with no other Hearts better than
[24:58] witness giving the Holy Ghost as he did
[24:59] unto us and put no difference between us
[25:01] and Them purifying their hearts by faith
[25:03] now therefore why tempt you God to put a
[25:05] yoke upon the neck of the disciples
[25:07] which neither our fathers nor we were
[25:08] able to Bear but we believe that through
[25:10] the grace of the through what
[25:15] through the grace of the Lord Jesus we
[25:18] shall be saved come into relationship
[25:21] then all the multitude kept silence and
[25:23] gave audience to barnos and Paul
[25:24] declaring that What miracles and wonders
[25:26] God had wrought among the Gentiles by
[25:28] them and after they held their peace
[25:30] James
[25:31] uh answered saying men and brother and
[25:32] hearken unto me and so Peter says it to
[25:35] him it wasn't poem bars Peter stood
[25:36] behind him uh uh uh James
[25:40] who was the Elder of the church there in
[25:41] Jerusalem he backed him up and says we
[25:44] are not going to put anything extra on
[25:46] these new converts because here listen
[25:49] if they need to come to anything they
[25:52] got the same holy ghost that we did and
[25:54] the same Holy Ghost will bring us into
[25:56] what we need
[25:59] by grace
[26:01] instead of you taking some old tradition
[26:03] and requirement
[26:07] how many knows that they did it to the
[26:09] Galatians the whole book of Galatians in
[26:11] your Bible is dedicated to men coming in
[26:15] and requiring circumcision of new
[26:17] Gentiles the Galatians
[26:19] they fell for it and Paul wrote in the
[26:21] Galatians his brothers
[26:23] why are you listening to these men
[26:26] why are you being moved from the Liberty
[26:30] God has brought you into
[26:33] you know what he said who hath Bewitched
[26:36] you
[26:38] you Galatians who did it
[26:42] Pharisees men that came to the message
[26:44] from Pharisees but they didn't get a
[26:46] true birth so they're bringing all their
[26:48] stuff to these new converts
[26:50] and Paul said they've Bewitched you
[26:52] they've cast a spell on you
[26:55] Stand Fast in the Liberty that you once
[26:58] had
[27:01] through Paul and through Paul's letters
[27:04] and through the word
[27:06] the Galatians finally come out and they
[27:09] probably saying I'm coming back to the
[27:13] Heart of Worship
[27:16] and it's all about you
[27:19] amen It's All About You Jesus let God do
[27:26] it his own way get in the spirit get
[27:29] free in the spirit let the Revelation
[27:31] come stimulation of Revelation you don't
[27:34] have to work it up you don't have to
[27:36] have a pep rally to work the people into
[27:38] motion preach the word preach the
[27:40] Revelation and the stimulation of
[27:42] revelation will make some people cry and
[27:44] weep make some people shout the Isles we
[27:46] actually will shout and scream can you
[27:48] say Amen some of them just sit and stand
[27:50] in all but it's the holy spirit let the
[27:52] Holy Spirit do it the way he wants to do
[27:54] it they want it to be wherever he was
[27:58] and consistently be there
[28:00] that's the relationship of the New
[28:02] Testament Church
