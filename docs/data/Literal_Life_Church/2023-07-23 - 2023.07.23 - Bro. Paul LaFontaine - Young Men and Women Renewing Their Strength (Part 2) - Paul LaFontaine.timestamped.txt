[1:01] we'll pick this up again from Wednesday
[1:03] night and we'll just continue with a few
[1:07] things here in points I'd like to
[1:09] make this young men and women renewing
[1:12] their strength and that's what we'll
[1:13] speak on here this morning we just pick
[1:16] it up we don't have time to read the
[1:17] entire chapter you know the incident and
[1:20] the story here so we'll just pick it up
[1:23] here maybe in verse 11.
[1:27] and when she had brought them unto him
[1:29] and to eat he took hold of her and said
[1:32] unto her come lie with me my sister and
[1:35] she said nay my brother do not force me
[1:39] for no such thing ought to be done in
[1:41] Israel do not thou this Folly and I
[1:45] whether shall I cause whether shall I
[1:48] cause my shame to go and as for thee
[1:51] Thou shalt be as one of the fools in
[1:53] Israel now therefore I pray thee speak
[1:56] unto the king for he will not withhold
[1:59] me from thee how be it he will not heark
[2:02] he would not hearken unto her voice but
[2:05] being stronger than she forced her and
[2:08] lay with her and then Ammon hated her
[2:11] exceedingly so that he hated wherewith
[2:13] he hated her was greater than the love
[2:16] wherewith he had loved her and animals
[2:18] said unto her arise and be gone I want
[2:21] to add another scripture this morning
[2:22] that I didn't expect but it's a familiar
[2:25] scripture in the New Testament about
[2:27] strength Ephesians chapter 6 and I could
[2:31] almost just quote it and many of you
[2:32] know it by by heart talking about the
[2:36] armor of the Lord and how many knows
[2:39] that we need to keep on the whole armor
[2:41] of the Lord in the times we live in it
[2:44] is a time to
[2:45] keep on the whole armor of the Lord and
[2:48] Paul says it here at the end of the
[2:50] Ephesians chapter where he goes into the
[2:53] depths of a Christian life then he ends
[2:56] it by saying verse 10 the psalm of
[2:59] saying finally my brethren be strong in
[3:02] the Lord and in the power of His might
[3:06] put on the whole armor of God that she
[3:08] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[3:10] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[3:12] flesh and blood but against
[3:14] principalities against Powers against
[3:17] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[3:19] against spiritual wickedness in high
[3:22] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[3:24] armor of God that he may be able to
[3:27] withstand in the evil day and having
[3:30] done all to stand stand therefore having
[3:33] your loins Gert about with truth and
[3:35] having on the breastplate of
[3:37] righteousness and your feet shod with
[3:39] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[3:41] above all taking the shield of Faith
[3:44] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[3:47] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[3:50] the helmet of salvation and the the
[3:53] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[3:56] God praying always prayer is a part of
[3:59] your armor too
[4:00] praying always with all prayer and
[4:03] supplication in the spirit and watching
[4:06] there into with all perseverance and
[4:09] supplication for all the Saints verse 10
[4:12] says
[4:13] finally be strong in the Lord and in the
[4:16] power of His might praise the Lord may
[4:19] God bless the reading of his word God
[4:20] bless you may be seated
[4:26] so this past Wednesday night I went into
[4:30] a subject
[4:31] um
[4:32] here and I dealt with five points out of
[4:36] this second Samuel chapter 13 that I
[4:39] feel like were valid things that we can
[4:41] learn from not only all of us but also
[4:43] the young people of this generation and
[4:46] as you know I'm uh this I mentioned
[4:48] Wednesday night I'm doing something that
[4:50] I really enjoy doing and I was asked to
[4:52] do a youth camp this week this next
[4:54] weekend for the young people at brother
[4:56] Mike Wall's Church they have about a
[4:57] hundred young people gathering in
[4:58] Virginia and then finishing it out in
[5:01] Washington DC on Sunday so I'm always
[5:03] excited I always considered a huge
[5:06] privilege when I get the chance to speak
[5:08] to Youth and we continue that vision and
[5:11] that that burden here and continually if
[5:15] your young people attend here they're
[5:16] going to con receive a continual
[5:18] teaching on the word of God and
[5:20] principles of his word and boundaries
[5:22] setting them in the right direction
[5:24] Satan's certainly doing his job to teach
[5:26] our young people today and to get and
[5:29] he's Relentless about it and so to
[5:31] counter that thank hopefully we have
[5:33] something stronger than what Satan says
[5:35] it's the word of God but we must teach
[5:37] that to them and then they must receive
[5:39] it in order for it to do its work so
[5:42] we're very excited about being able to
[5:45] go and do that brother Stevens true will
[5:47] be ministering this Wednesday and Sunday
[5:49] and he's told me his subject and I think
[5:51] it's going to be very timely for the
[5:54] church here talking about being in the
[5:55] valley If he if he doesn't go that
[5:58] direction then I was wrong God changed
[6:00] his Direction but I think it'll be a
[6:02] very timely Series this Wednesday next
[6:04] Sunday with brother Stevens true here
[6:06] praise the Lord but we are excited about
[6:08] being able to share this and I wanted to
[6:10] share some things that are relevant out
[6:12] of these points to the congregation and
[6:14] whoever else may be listening and this
[6:17] story in second Samuel 13 is a tragic
[6:20] story if you read it it's it's not a
[6:22] good thing that it ends on but we find
[6:25] that there's some points of I want to
[6:27] switch it now because there's some
[6:29] points in strength that we can learn
[6:32] from in responses and everybody can
[6:35] learn from these responses from Tamar
[6:37] God bless Tamar I look forward to being
[6:40] with her someday shaking her hand as a
[6:42] sister and to watch her strength that
[6:44] she had here the only reason that she
[6:46] was violated is because she found
[6:48] herself alone and didn't not have any
[6:50] protection around her to stop what was
[6:52] going on but as far as her principles
[6:55] and her strength and what she said here
[6:57] we can learn from it greatly not only
[6:59] the young people but also many of us who
[7:03] need strength in the Holy Ghost
[7:06] and so uh when you have a woman
[7:09] responding with strength like this in
[7:12] the worst possible forceful atmosphere
[7:14] then we can learn from it can you say
[7:16] Matt as a matter of fact we could safely
[7:18] say that these things are a type of the
[7:20] Bride because she's going to need
[7:22] strength at the end time to live in the
[7:24] middle of Satan's Eden in the weakness
[7:27] of this age I mentioned Wednesday night
[7:29] that Jesus referred to the age as a a
[7:32] wicked and adulterous generation and
[7:35] then brother Brown says it's a weak and
[7:37] adulterous generation and I believe
[7:39] that's the generation we live in it's
[7:41] marked by weakness weak in the mind
[7:43] weaken the spirit weaken convictions
[7:45] weakness but also adulteress and I think
[7:48] those things are tied together because
[7:50] you have if you have open doors to
[7:52] perverted sexual Spirits it's because
[7:55] it's a weak conviction it's a weak mind
[7:57] it has no principles to stand against
[7:59] the adulterous spirit so the spirits
[8:02] enter in when you open the door by the
[8:04] weakness of the mind can I get an amen
[8:06] this morning a weak and adulterous
[8:08] generation goes together and soon as you
[8:10] open the doors you open the doors if you
[8:12] don't use the word as your boundaries
[8:14] and the word is your protection then you
[8:17] open the doors to your life to your
[8:19] family and to your church to sexual
[8:21] perversion and that goes for Christians
[8:24] too
[8:25] were not exempt because we're a message
[8:27] Church demons are still the same matter
[8:30] of fact their guns are trained on
[8:31] Believers more than anybody his guns are
[8:34] trained on young believers that are
[8:35] hearing this message more than anybody
[8:37] in the world he's got the world but it's
[8:39] our young people that he wants it's our
[8:42] children that he wants and I know if
[8:43] anybody noticed about the Antichrist
[8:45] spirit that brother Danny was speaking
[8:47] on last weekend but there was Satan just
[8:49] ahead of inherit Satan just ahead of the
[8:52] birth of Christ because he wanted to get
[8:54] their children when Moses was coming on
[8:56] the scene if I could get him at a child
[8:58] level if I could kill Moses before he
[9:00] comes if I could kill the prophet it's
[9:02] at a birth level that he's trying to get
[9:04] our children he was trying to that that
[9:07] Beast was trying to get a hold of the
[9:09] Christ child before he was born but
[9:11] guess what he didn't get a hold of him
[9:13] Christ was born power was born can you
[9:16] say Amen but his desire is to get them
[9:18] at a young level
[9:21] and so today is no exception
[9:26] I had a good conversation with my sister
[9:29] yesterday and she's let you know about
[9:31] the state that she's in and she's a
[9:33] woman of confession she's a movement of
[9:35] faith and uh we're standing together
[9:39] with her to believe for a complete
[9:41] healing for my sister
[9:43] but it had about an hour with her
[9:45] talking she shared with me some of the
[9:47] things that that God had just impressed
[9:49] upon her to share with all the people
[9:51] serving in the um uh uh the the uh homes
[9:55] excuse me the kids days this year and
[9:58] telling all the 60 or 70 that were
[10:00] involved to catch the vision of this
[10:02] this is not a fly-by-night thing but to
[10:04] prepare our hearts and some of the
[10:05] things she said in that was to realize
[10:07] that we realized Satan's pattern is to
[10:10] be relentless and intentional to go for
[10:13] our children in the schools today and
[10:15] everywhere he Satan has an agenda he
[10:18] he's he's blatant about it he's not
[10:20] hidden about it anymore he's going for
[10:22] the kids can you say Amen so why why is
[10:25] it that we have to back off and not
[10:27] teaching our children and being
[10:29] intentional to teach them the boundaries
[10:31] of God's word can I get an amen you
[10:34] parents have a responsibility to be
[10:36] aggressive to be intentional not to
[10:38] force it down them but to be forceful
[10:40] towards another demon that's trying to
[10:42] take your kids so we're intentional to
[10:45] train them we're intentional to train to
[10:47] to teach them and also to be prepared
[10:50] the Sunday School teachers everyone to
[10:52] be prepared and pray up say this is an
[10:54] important thing I can tell you I don't
[10:56] just get up here and just in the hour
[10:58] that we live in I better not get up here
[11:00] and just through a sermon together
[11:03] can I get an amen that's not the way it
[11:05] goes here we're in different times I
[11:07] can't just throw a sermon together and
[11:09] make a few copies on the Xerox and get
[11:11] up here and repeat something no no no no
[11:13] I have to pray I have to labor for we're
[11:16] fighting way too many demons for that
[11:18] when I stand here it's not just a sermon
[11:21] saying God demonstrate yourself with the
[11:23] power that the people would receive
[11:25] something stronger than what the world
[11:27] is offering
[11:29] you ought to pray for me I have a lot of
[11:31] prayer warriors but I need more of them
[11:32] today because you don't prepare this
[11:34] isn't just public speaking this isn't
[11:36] just a speech but I'm feeling the burden
[11:39] of demon power
[11:46] and I believe that we're in a time that
[11:50] we need all believers and parents to
[11:53] stand up to the plate a little bit
[11:56] and recognize how serious this is
[11:59] preacher so I appreciate her input and
[12:02] and so when you have a forceful and
[12:05] that's why this story fits because
[12:07] amnon would be a type of the mind and
[12:10] the brain and the spirit of Satan taking
[12:13] a kid over so much that it becomes not a
[12:16] respectful thing but a forceful thing
[12:18] and when you have a woman the bride
[12:20] living in Satan's Eden it's a forceful
[12:22] thing let me say this this new
[12:25] generation needs its own Revival in the
[12:27] word of God this new generation needs a
[12:29] Revival and the true Holy Ghost it's the
[12:32] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[12:35] young person needs their own baptism in
[12:37] the spirit of God this is this is the
[12:40] time for strength and this is the
[12:42] strength of this age to have the true
[12:44] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost not a
[12:47] sensation not an emotion not some
[12:49] fly-by-night thing but the real Spirit
[12:51] of Christ in their lives they need that
[12:54] strength because the Holy Ghost is what
[12:56] makes the word live
[12:58] can I get some amens this morning it's
[13:00] the Holy Ghost that'll make this Bible
[13:02] live can you say Amen it puts the
[13:04] convictions and principles to live by
[13:07] inaction against the devil you can have
[13:09] the convictions and principles but the
[13:11] Holy Ghost makes them live and puts them
[13:13] into action against the forcefulness of
[13:16] the devil
[13:19] it comes off of the book it's not just a
[13:21] Bible but the Bible now becomes alive
[13:24] and it puts it into action In the Heat
[13:26] of the Moment
[13:29] we need strength
[13:31] in not only our youth but also everyone
[13:34] in here we need Strength In the Heat of
[13:37] the Moment
[13:39] In the Heat of the private moment
[13:42] everybody can be strong here
[13:45] everybody can look like Christians here
[13:47] every every young person can raise their
[13:50] hand and I appreciate that but that's
[13:52] not what we need strength for that's not
[13:54] what will give you strength we need
[13:56] Strength In the Heat of the Moment We
[13:58] need strength when the devil's forcing
[14:00] us we need strength to answer back to
[14:03] Satan's lies
[14:05] Hallelujah
[14:06] and so the Bible gives us those things
[14:10] but the strength of the Holy Ghost
[14:11] behind is what makes it live and so I
[14:14] want to remind something else brother
[14:16] Danny said is that Christ he reminded us
[14:18] of Christ overcoming the Devil by the
[14:20] written word so I want to say that
[14:22] without it without a gift without using
[14:25] his power he could have used the power
[14:26] against the devil he could have used a
[14:28] gift against the devil but in that
[14:30] moment to show every weak Christian
[14:33] that the written word will work anytime
[14:36] anywhere any place if it's quoted black
[14:39] to the enemy that in itself has a power
[14:41] to it and that's the strength that we
[14:43] need our strength is not intellectually
[14:45] mentally trying to figure out how to
[14:47] overcome this oh my I'm In the Heat of
[14:49] the Moment how do I mentally get out of
[14:51] this our strength is in the Lord our
[14:53] strength is in the word our strength is
[14:55] in the convictions of the word of God
[14:57] it's not in you our strength is in the
[15:00] Lord
[15:01] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[15:03] of His might
[15:05] amen so now and so even the Old
[15:09] Testament people didn't have the Holy
[15:10] Ghost they only had it on their Spirit
[15:12] but even Old Testament people like Tamar
[15:14] here could respond to Temptation could
[15:17] respond to bad situations uh Joseph is a
[15:21] is an example and my son Gideon was
[15:23] preaching on the prosperity and what
[15:25] true Prosperity is I really enjoyed it
[15:28] because he went into Joseph which is a
[15:29] type of Christ and he showed how God
[15:31] could Prosper a man God could bring true
[15:34] Prosperity even when he was in the worst
[15:37] situations prison can be some of the
[15:39] worst situations I don't know if you've
[15:41] been to prison or not but if you've seen
[15:43] as Gideon said videos and different
[15:45] things it's terrible situations to be in
[15:47] that but in the worst possible
[15:49] surroundings Joseph Prosper prospered by
[15:54] God
[15:55] why because he was a man of conviction
[15:58] he was a man of principle
[16:00] he's a he's a man who didn't bend he's a
[16:02] man that was strong
[16:05] can you say Amen
[16:06] he was strong in those situations
[16:09] and you know the situation that fits in
[16:11] with today is that we have a pontifer's
[16:14] wife he began to work then when he come
[16:16] out of prison excuse me before that he
[16:18] began to work in the uh he was in prison
[16:21] he came out and then he was accused by a
[16:24] pumped over his wife or his boss's wife
[16:27] because she was coming on to him she was
[16:30] a a married woman number one she was a
[16:33] no doubt a highly sensual woman and she
[16:35] the Bible says she set her eyes on
[16:36] Joseph this young man maybe 18 19 years
[16:40] old and here he is and he's growing and
[16:42] he's got a body just like our body and
[16:45] he's growing and he's a his hormones and
[16:47] emotions and all that too he's just a
[16:49] young man and she's coming on to him and
[16:51] the Bible says she pressed him daily she
[16:53] had come daily and offer herself to them
[16:56] let me tell you something there is
[16:58] nothing they nothing to get that man out
[17:01] of that situation with a highly
[17:03] passionate sexual woman who was
[17:05] experienced and all that and to come on
[17:07] to that young man like that there was
[17:09] nothing to get him out of it except the
[17:12] fear of God that he had before God
[17:15] he's Young
[17:17] she's off herself hey but there's
[17:20] nothing to get out except the principles
[17:22] of the word
[17:23] and I like how he answered
[17:26] he said how could I do this sin
[17:29] I want everybody listening right now
[17:33] how could I do this sin
[17:36] against my God
[17:40] was so real to him and he was so
[17:43] sensitive to the presence of God that he
[17:46] didn't said say oh I might get in
[17:48] trouble or I he didn't have a wife so he
[17:51] wouldn't Ascend against his wife but it
[17:53] wasn't about the wife or this or that
[17:55] losing his job anything like that it was
[17:57] that how could I do this because he
[17:59] lived in a way that God sees everything
[18:03] and I don't live this because I'm trying
[18:06] to be a strong man
[18:08] to this pontiver's wife I lived this
[18:11] before God
[18:13] he is the one that I answer to he is
[18:17] here all the time
[18:19] I got a lot of teaching this morning to
[18:21] finish on this subject and it's one of
[18:25] those Services I'll be prepared
[18:27] to not get many amens
[18:30] because but I'm going to stand here and
[18:31] do it anyway
[18:33] because the devil needs it and some of
[18:35] us need it
[18:37] got to let the devil know where we stand
[18:40] that's right amen and you people that
[18:44] say he's preaching on me
[18:47] I didn't know you were going to be here
[18:51] how can you say that
[18:52] I didn't know you're somebody you're
[18:54] here other times you're not I never know
[18:56] when you're going to be here I don't
[18:56] know I'm not a prophet I don't know so I
[18:58] study what God gives me and I've heard
[19:00] that for years and I get intimidated
[19:02] about it he's preaching on me and
[19:03] usually I say I say no if I have to
[19:06] address things I address the whole
[19:09] congregation and I address many
[19:10] different issues it's just not one
[19:12] person if I'm directing at one person
[19:13] that would be a little disrespectful so
[19:16] that's the answer I always get but then
[19:17] I realized wait a minute I don't even
[19:19] know when they're going to be there
[19:23] thank you Lane
[19:25] 's here a lot though
[19:29] so
[19:30] uh let me just move on because I got a
[19:32] lot a lot of hair in my Fork here but
[19:34] listen let me say it again the new
[19:36] generation needs strength to be strong
[19:38] in the Lord
[19:39] because now it's a force it's a it's a
[19:42] mind manipulation Satan is intentional
[19:45] things he does as planned can you say
[19:47] amount how many know that we're under
[19:48] the influence of AI artificial
[19:50] intelligence
[19:51] if anybody's ever looked at that a
[19:52] little bit we're under it and it's in
[19:54] the news quite a bit because it's
[19:55] becoming they say it's a good thing on
[19:57] this side it's really good because we're
[19:58] more productive when we learn what the
[20:00] people are thinking and all this stuff
[20:01] but then there's this other bad side
[20:03] that they're starting to write about
[20:04] this thing could take over this thing
[20:06] could control well it already has the
[20:09] power of AI is already over our lives
[20:12] and has grown Way Beyond any of us
[20:15] realize
[20:16] artificial intelligence it's a control
[20:19] it's a power but run through computers
[20:21] and in an article by Brookings called
[20:24] how AI is transforming the world they
[20:27] summarize AI by saying AI is a
[20:29] wide-ranging tool that enables people to
[20:32] rethink how we integrate information how
[20:35] we analyze data and how we use the
[20:38] resulting insights to improve decision
[20:41] making
[20:43] boy does that ever sound subtle
[20:47] it's going to re-change everything
[20:48] around so that we can improve the
[20:51] thinking process that we can improve the
[20:55] decision-making process
[20:59] that's serious
[21:01] and he says it's a transformation
[21:04] of every Walk Of Our Lives
[21:07] as a Christian I would be very very
[21:11] concerned about that
[21:15] it's already happening we're already
[21:17] underneath it it's a force so when I say
[21:19] Force when I say amnon Force this girl
[21:21] there's a force in this world there's a
[21:24] force it's not just a subtle thing that
[21:26] you've got to go get it anymore it's a
[21:27] force it's a control over our thinking
[21:29] the wisdom of this world sounds very
[21:32] good but we're not living by the wisdom
[21:33] of the world the Bible says if you read
[21:35] your Bible in First Corinthians 1 the
[21:37] wisdom of this world is actually
[21:39] contrary to the wisdom of God and
[21:41] actually it'll never be what the wisdom
[21:43] of God is can you say Amen we're not
[21:45] here to live by the wisdom of this world
[21:47] even though it sounds good but God's got
[21:50] a wisdom for us God's got a revelation
[21:52] for us a greater than Solomon is here
[21:55] now
[21:56] with the wisdom of God to teach us
[21:58] praise the Lord so now we don't want to
[22:01] be under that we want to have the Holy
[22:03] Spirit in our lives and we don't want
[22:05] something that's controlling us to
[22:07] transform every walk of our life we
[22:10] should be aware that that is going on
[22:12] and that effort is being made praise the
[22:14] Lord so now here's the story we're going
[22:16] to just remind you of the story and then
[22:18] we're going to get to five other points
[22:20] here from it in a teaching that show us
[22:22] the strength that this young girl Tamar
[22:25] tried to resist this force and so uh
[22:29] amnon is laying around and he's become
[22:33] what he says in love with this girl and
[22:36] Wednesday night we dealt with that he
[22:38] didn't know true love because after he
[22:41] says he loves her then everything every
[22:43] action that he did every action he
[22:46] expressed did not show genuine love
[22:49] and so we realize that means somebody
[22:52] can call something love but it's not
[22:54] love
[22:56] you remember brother I'm talking about
[22:58] the purity of the pure love of God
[23:00] flowing from his Fountain he's pure love
[23:02] but as the devil takes it and and
[23:04] perverts it it keeps getting down and
[23:06] filio love and then then it comes down
[23:08] to a rare perverted love but they're
[23:10] still calling it love
[23:12] uh a man who uh is with a man he says he
[23:16] loves the man so love is being used by
[23:18] all different terms today perversion
[23:20] well I did it because I love them
[23:23] so that's a perversion of genuine love
[23:25] and Amna and here he is he's sitting
[23:27] around and then he has a friend uh here
[23:30] whose name was Jonah dab and we we
[23:32] brought that out Wednesday night so if
[23:34] you want to listen to it you can we'll
[23:35] put it up but you see now he's laying
[23:37] around in his friend just to catch the
[23:38] story here his friend comes in and see
[23:41] his sees his friend amnon laying there
[23:43] and he said hey bro you know what's
[23:45] going on you've been doing this for
[23:46] about 10 days and you've been laying on
[23:48] the couch here and what's the matter
[23:50] with you you look like you're sitting
[23:51] here I am sick I am sick
[23:53] I've got I've got love for this girl and
[23:56] I'm I'm just sick about it I'm just you
[23:58] know and so he's sitting there and uh
[24:01] his friend says you've been laying there
[24:03] for 10 days in your bedroom uh you know
[24:06] playing Call of Duty the whole time Ops
[24:09] 2 and that's all you've been doing he
[24:11] said I know I'm a mess and this but this
[24:13] is what I'm doing I love this girl I'm
[24:14] sick I've got to have her I've got to
[24:17] have her I'm in love with her and and
[24:19] maybe in his earbuds he's got uh I'm in
[24:22] love with your body uh by Ed Sheeran
[24:28] one of the number one songs a few years
[24:30] ago blatantly says I'm in love with the
[24:33] shape of you
[24:34] my heart is coming along but really I'm
[24:36] in love with the shape of you I'm in
[24:38] love with your body that's probably what
[24:40] was in amnon's earbuds as he was on his
[24:43] video games
[24:45] I tell you you take a combination of all
[24:47] this stuff
[24:48] opening up the doors and the the the
[24:51] places for demons and uh
[24:55] you're going to turn into something
[24:58] I'm gonna tell it like it is you're
[25:00] going to turn into something you listen
[25:02] to country music you listen to the music
[25:04] of this world you do it privately and
[25:06] you feed on and you bring all this
[25:08] combination of stuff you're gonna get
[25:10] the results of an adulterous fornicating
[25:12] spirit because that's what it's done for
[25:15] six thousand years
[25:17] can you say Amen how how is it not going
[25:19] to get a different result
[25:21] so what we need is not just parents
[25:23] pointing their kids the right way and
[25:25] not just pastors preaching it and youth
[25:27] leaders teaching it every Friday night
[25:29] we don't just need that we need young
[25:32] people that are strong in the Holy
[25:34] Spirit in their life so they can combat
[25:37] these things
[25:40] they can recognize what would it be if
[25:42] young people would rise and streak today
[25:44] and say Dad and Mom listen I don't want
[25:46] to have my computer in the bedroom I
[25:49] want it out so it can be seen it's not
[25:51] the parents asking for it what would it
[25:53] be if we had young people coming to
[25:54] their parents saying that listen I don't
[25:56] trust the devil I don't trust myself I
[25:58] want to be strong in the Lord I don't
[26:00] want to have this Dad and Mom I want you
[26:02] to have on my phone I want you to have
[26:04] access to everything I'm looking at see
[26:06] parents have to do that sometimes I've
[26:07] heard parents have to do that
[26:09] but when you see what if we have the
[26:12] strength of young people saying
[26:13] themselves I want you to see everything
[26:15] I'm looking at
[26:21] hallelujah praise the Lord
[26:25] what if we had young people recognize
[26:27] the spirits behind country music
[26:30] what if they on their own come to an
[26:32] altar and really repented
[26:35] with results
[26:36] and say I walk up from here God's
[26:38] changed my life I believe he's changed
[26:39] my life and they go home and they kick
[26:41] out themselves
[26:43] perversion of the world out of their
[26:45] lives
[26:47] that's the strength I'm preaching about
[26:49] and guess what it's going to happen
[26:52] maybe not with everybody but I'm
[26:54] preaching because he's called he's
[26:55] calling young people to that in this
[26:57] stage
[26:58] so he's so love sick and he's doing all
[27:00] this and notice what happens
[27:02] He suggests
[27:05] his friend suggests if you do this and
[27:08] you do this and you do that you can set
[27:10] it up where you're alone together
[27:11] because really she had sets boundaries
[27:13] in her life he says my problem is I
[27:15] can't get to her I can't do what I want
[27:17] to her
[27:18] the mind and the spirits that he was
[27:20] feeding on eventually because you all
[27:23] know the
[27:24] long-standing principle that we've
[27:25] learned about lust lust is never
[27:27] satisfied
[27:30] you're only satisfied were you content
[27:32] in Jesus Christ but lust is never
[27:33] satisfied so lust once it comes to one
[27:35] level it's ready for the next level this
[27:38] I've been feeding on this six months but
[27:40] this isn't good enough now I got to take
[27:41] this less is never satisfied
[27:44] so he had come to the place it wasn't
[27:45] good enough just to look at anything or
[27:47] look at her from a distance I want to
[27:49] get to her I want to do something to her
[27:50] but I can't get to her because she's got
[27:53] boundaries around her and she's crying
[27:55] says oh he's telling his friend I don't
[27:57] know what to do bro I'm all messed up
[27:59] I'm sick and what do I do hey I got this
[28:01] you know I got this you do this you do
[28:04] this that she'll be in she'll bring you
[28:06] some cakes and you can set it up where
[28:08] you'll be alone
[28:13] time for a drink
[28:16] this is when you this is when you say
[28:18] praise the Lord Brother Paul keep
[28:20] preaching
[28:27] so with within just a little while
[28:34] once she's got her in that place he can
[28:36] do whatever he wants to alone with her
[28:40] so when he began to force her
[28:43] her responses
[28:45] were the right responses
[28:48] you know if anybody's ever noticed
[28:49] before
[28:51] but her responses were the responses
[28:55] of a Godly girl
[28:58] a strong girl remember Wednesday night I
[29:00] read the scriptures that we not only
[29:02] need strong young men I run right unto
[29:05] you young men because you are strong and
[29:07] you know how to overcome the enemy
[29:10] but then in Proverbs 31 we find strength
[29:13] in a Proverbs 31 Woman her arm is
[29:16] strength her clothing is strength she
[29:18] reeks of strength not that she's
[29:21] bodybuilding in the workout room she
[29:24] reeks of strength in the Lord
[29:27] don't mess with her devil don't mess
[29:30] with this woman
[29:34] that's what we need
[29:36] we needed a married woman we needed in
[29:38] single women we need the strength of
[29:39] Holy Ghost and married man we need the
[29:41] strength of the Holy Ghost and in single
[29:43] men can you say Amen we need to teach it
[29:45] as their young men how to handle it we
[29:46] need this is that we need the strength
[29:48] of the lord it's summarized God give us
[29:51] your strength out of your word out of
[29:53] the Holy Spirit make us strong can you
[29:55] say Amen how many raise your hand and
[29:57] say make me strong God make me strong in
[29:59] the word to be strong in the Lord let me
[30:01] put my armor on in this hour
[30:04] praise the Lord so here's how it happens
[30:06] so when he began before her first thing
[30:09] and that's my first point her first
[30:11] thing that she said he was the first she
[30:13] said nay which in modern terms means no
[30:18] now I know that sounds very
[30:21] uh simple
[30:23] but it's just got a lot of depth to it
[30:26] because young people don't know how to
[30:29] say
[30:30] no
[30:34] even our secular schools 30 years ago
[30:37] sent out the campaign for drugs
[30:40] just say
[30:43] no I don't know how well it's worked
[30:48] I don't know why we have a campaign to
[30:51] say no to drugs and not say no to a
[30:52] bunch of other stuff pre-marital sex
[30:57] pornography
[30:59] it's funny how they just put it out for
[31:01] drugs that's damaging to them drugs well
[31:04] there's a lot of other things damaging
[31:06] to them so they just kind of missed it
[31:08] there just say no when a spirit tells
[31:10] you I don't think I'm a boy anymore I'm
[31:12] a girl
[31:14] you don't hear the campaigns for that
[31:17] but I'm just going to teach you a simple
[31:19] lesson this morning it's not profound
[31:21] it's not revelatory it's not going to
[31:24] blow your minds where you get back in
[31:25] the park and say to your wife it was so
[31:28] huge and revelatory that I didn't even
[31:30] understand all of it but I'm good
[31:32] because no I'm just going to teach the
[31:34] first point and says we learn we need to
[31:37] learn and young people need to learn the
[31:40] power of saying no
[31:51] girls and young guys need to learn the
[31:54] power of just saying a small word with
[31:56] two letters no amdon no and he keeps
[32:00] going and she says what part of no
[32:03] didn't you understand
[32:05] the Inn or the o
[32:07] you young people have heard your parents
[32:09] say that it's one of our classic
[32:10] statements what part of no didn't you
[32:12] understand the N or the O there's only
[32:15] two letters in it it's real simple no
[32:20] young people need to learn the power
[32:21] it's because they have no strength if
[32:23] they can't say no and stick with or no
[32:25] it's because they have no strength but
[32:27] strengthen young men and young women is
[32:29] the the strength to say no
[32:33] giving in is weakness
[32:36] can I get an amen giving in is weakness
[32:39] strength is saying no and sticking with
[32:41] the no
[32:42] and the only reason this did not work
[32:44] for Tamar is because she was alone with
[32:46] him there was no protection and I I I
[32:49] regret that this has happened and and
[32:51] it's but it's a lesson for us to learn
[32:52] it's in the Bible we God didn't say
[32:56] leave that chapter out it's too graphic
[32:58] God left it in for our teaching for our
[33:01] learning these things are real young
[33:03] people these things are real and the
[33:05] only reason her strength to say no
[33:07] didn't work is because this man had come
[33:09] to such a place he didn't care for her
[33:11] he didn't love her he didn't care he
[33:14] didn't respect her no he didn't respect
[33:16] the family he didn't respect anything
[33:20] and he overrode it because they were
[33:22] alone
[33:24] sometimes we have this happen and and so
[33:27] it's just no so number uh Point number
[33:30] six from picking up from Wednesday night
[33:32] young people you must learn as a young
[33:34] person the power of saying no to someone
[33:36] doing or saying and wrong inappropriate
[33:40] things and then distance yourself from
[33:43] them when you do that that is strength
[33:48] can I get an amen that's when you're
[33:51] becoming strong
[33:53] let me read it again you must learn as a
[33:56] young person the power saying no to
[33:57] someone doing or saying inappropriate
[34:00] things and the reason I say saying is
[34:02] because it's not just doing something
[34:04] inappropriate probably 95 of our issues
[34:09] today is not doing something as much as
[34:11] saying something inappropriate in a text
[34:14] or in some type of communication saying
[34:18] something inappropriate that nobody else
[34:19] is watching
[34:21] so you need to learn how to say no say
[34:23] that's inappropriate don't ever say that
[34:24] again or I'll never communicate with you
[34:26] again that's strength but just to let it
[34:28] go on that's weakness
[34:30] and we want to be strong right
[34:32] and so even if it's saying inappropriate
[34:35] things then then I think going the extra
[34:38] mile if they stop if they don't stop
[34:40] doing that you distance yourself from
[34:42] them that is strength in the Lord and
[34:44] the scriptures I have to go with it I
[34:46] can do this here is submit yourself
[34:48] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[34:52] will flee from you resist the devil and
[34:54] he will flee from you draw an eye to God
[34:56] and He will draw an eye to you cleanse
[34:58] your hands you Sinners and purify your
[35:00] hearts ye double-minded don't be
[35:02] double-minded don't live in a double
[35:04] world don't say act like you're obeying
[35:07] to your parents but you're not obeying
[35:09] it all on your own no it's it's purify
[35:11] your hearts and don't be double-minded
[35:13] your principles your character the
[35:16] things you stand for are good when
[35:18] you're in public and they're good when
[35:19] you're in private they're good when
[35:21] somebody's saying inappropriate comments
[35:23] they're good anytime and they stay the
[35:25] same
[35:29] praise the Lord
[35:31] so this is the story I came to pass
[35:33] everything that Master's wife Master
[35:35] Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph so she
[35:37] said lie with me but he refused and said
[35:39] unto his master his wife behold my
[35:40] master what if not what is with me in
[35:42] this house and he has committed all this
[35:44] hath to my hand there is none greater in
[35:46] this house than I neither hath he kept
[35:48] back anything from me but thee because
[35:49] Thou Art his wife how then can I do this
[35:52] great wickedness and sin against God and
[35:54] it came to pass that she spoke to Joseph
[35:56] day by day that he hearkened not unto
[35:59] her to lie by her or to be with her she
[36:03] did it she wooed him day by day not
[36:06] monthly not weekly day by day can you
[36:09] imagine the pressure that but he hearken
[36:12] not day by day Church alive with her or
[36:14] to be with her
[36:16] strength
[36:19] strengthen the Lord young person that's
[36:21] strength
[36:23] Joseph was put in that the Bible for a
[36:25] reason as a type of Christ came to pass
[36:28] about that time that Joseph went into
[36:29] the house to do his business and there
[36:30] was none of the men of the house there
[36:31] within and she caught him by His Garment
[36:34] saying lie with me and he left his
[36:35] garment in her hand and fled and got him
[36:39] out I preached a sermon years ago on he
[36:42] got him out
[36:45] and I started preaching and I said if we
[36:48] could just live by those three words he
[36:50] got him out
[36:51] and I preached the whole sermon
[36:54] saying if we could live by three words
[36:56] not realizing that it's four words and
[36:58] not three
[37:00] and my precious brother-in-law Hank van
[37:03] wyke
[37:06] reminds me of that sermon
[37:09] the last 35 years
[37:12] because Henry has all of my bloopers
[37:15] I don't know what my mind's going but
[37:17] he's got all of my bloopers for 35 years
[37:19] right there if you need to hear it he
[37:22] can tell it it comes right up
[37:25] he's got them all he said Paul he said I
[37:28] looked over and you were preaching he
[37:30] got him out just live by those three
[37:33] words and there were people counting on
[37:35] their fingers
[37:43] you know for some of you it's okay to
[37:45] laugh you know
[37:47] Jesus had a sense of humor
[37:51] but
[37:52] he got him out is four words that we
[37:56] should live by
[37:57] he didn't try to witness to her
[38:01] I think God's put me here for a reason
[38:05] you know God prospered me and I'm like
[38:07] at the right hand of Potiphar's hands
[38:09] out he's put me in charge of everything
[38:10] in his kingdom and I think God's put me
[38:13] here for a reason to witness to this
[38:15] his wife
[38:19] program says you're on the Devil's
[38:20] Ground
[38:21] I can go to the pool hall and maybe I
[38:23] can be a witness no no you're on the
[38:25] Devil's Ground
[38:26] you don't go on the Devil's Ground he
[38:27] comes on our ground
[38:29] maybe I can you know maybe I can do
[38:32] something here and you know he's a man
[38:33] that's why I tell young men in young
[38:35] men's me he's he's a man with passions
[38:37] you know he stayed single he hasn't been
[38:38] with a woman yet so he's got his
[38:40] passions he got all this and all he's
[38:42] had to overcome personally himself now
[38:44] he's got a woman offering himself to
[38:46] them and you know his response how can I
[38:48] do this sin against my God number one
[38:49] number two he got him out
[38:53] and that's what I'm saying this is real
[38:54] simple today okay I got some simple
[38:56] principles saying no and he got him out
[39:01] what do you do when something's going on
[39:03] it's making you nervous you get out
[39:07] what do you do if something pops up on
[39:09] your screen or your phone
[39:10] you get out
[39:12] you erase it you get out of that room
[39:16] praise the Lord
[39:20] Bram says that then when he was there in
[39:22] his exaltation and before his excitation
[39:24] his temptation remember Joseph was put
[39:26] into prison because he was innocent the
[39:28] Roman because you know the story that
[39:29] once he said no and ran from her he
[39:32] grabbed his she grabbed His Garment and
[39:33] then she accused him later that he did
[39:35] something
[39:36] the Israelite General by the name of
[39:38] potiphar Padre went and went away on a
[39:40] trip he had a pretty wife and his wife
[39:41] had Joseph come into the house to do
[39:43] something and try to get Joseph to do
[39:45] something wrong and he was loyal to God
[39:47] I tell you they always you women I've
[39:49] hollered at you now I'm going to take up
[39:51] for you a minute see the woman is the
[39:52] weaker vessel I know there can't be a
[39:55] bad man before there's a bad woman but
[39:57] men knows that men knows that you are a
[39:59] son of God and take advantage of a woman
[40:02] shame on you no matter what she does
[40:05] she's a weaker vessel and you know that
[40:10] brother but I'm just lean in there just
[40:12] a little bit
[40:14] saying hey
[40:15] when push comes to shove boy you should
[40:19] have been strong enough to stop it
[40:24] because why because that's Joseph in the
[40:25] Bible I mean you're not going to change
[40:27] that situation unless there was some
[40:29] strong conviction in Joseph's heart for
[40:32] his God and when you don't have that
[40:35] then anything can happen
[40:38] she's a weaker vessel and you know that
[40:40] so you're the strong one in other places
[40:42] says you're the strong one you're
[40:43] supposed to be the stronger one so I'll
[40:45] get to another quote here in just a
[40:46] minute if she goes out acting unladylike
[40:50] take her by the hand and talk to her
[40:52] like a sister you're a Son of God don't
[40:55] do them evil things look at Joseph he
[40:57] was an example to you so he's saying hey
[41:00] wait a minute the guy's saying she's
[41:01] acting unladylike take her by the hand
[41:04] and talk to her like a sister you're a
[41:06] Son of God don't do them evil things
[41:08] look at Joseph he was an example to you
[41:11] going back
[41:14] go back to the next one I don't know if
[41:15] you guys can do that there so I'm going
[41:17] to my next Point here that's number six
[41:19] you must learn as a young person to the
[41:21] power of saying no to someone doing or
[41:23] saying wrong
[41:25] all right
[41:26] so now next she says to him uh Tamar
[41:30] says to him
[41:31] this is not what we do as Believers in
[41:34] Israel this is not even heard of I'll
[41:36] read I'll read it in her words so you
[41:38] understand For No Such Thing ought to be
[41:40] done in Israel right there Tamar is our
[41:44] identifying herself with the message
[41:46] that they believe
[41:49] God bless her
[41:51] in front of this boy alone she is
[41:55] identifying herself with the entire
[41:57] message she said we don't do these
[42:01] things around here in Israel the Heathen
[42:04] does this the world does this
[42:07] but she's saying in strength
[42:11] we don't do it this way buster
[42:15] this is not how the message teaches
[42:18] this is not how brother Paul has taught
[42:21] us
[42:21] this is not how the ministers this is
[42:24] not how my Daddy has taught me but never
[42:27] mind Daddy and the pastor this is not
[42:30] what we believe she is fully identified
[42:33] with the distinction that I am a part of
[42:36] the children of Israel that believe
[42:38] these Ten Commandments
[42:40] we stand on the Ten Commandments we
[42:43] stand on what we believe and in this
[42:45] Heat of the Moment I'm telling you this
[42:47] boy what I don't know what you're doing
[42:49] but this is not what we do as Believers
[42:52] this is not our conviction at all and
[42:54] you know it amnon
[42:56] way to go Tamar
[42:58] you go girl
[43:01] she told them
[43:03] and this is the world's way amnon this
[43:05] is not our way boy straighten up man up
[43:08] act like a man
[43:10] let me go
[43:15] let me go this is not the way we do
[43:17] things
[43:18] let's do it right
[43:22] so number seven you should never
[43:28] you should never be afraid girl or guy
[43:31] you should never be afraid to speak what
[43:34] we believe in this message to anyone at
[43:38] any time under any kind of pressure
[43:43] that is strength
[43:50] praise the Lord
[43:52] I ought to have every
[43:55] Daddy
[43:57] saying amen and supporting this
[44:00] not because it's Paula Fontaine but
[44:03] because it's the word of God it's the
[44:05] message it's what we believe you attend
[44:08] a message Church
[44:09] you ought to be able to say Amen in your
[44:11] heart at the very least to what we
[44:13] believe in this message
[44:15] you do your kids a better service to
[44:17] stand and make a strong stand for what
[44:20] you believe we believe this message
[44:23] should never be afraid to speak young
[44:25] person younger or young guy never be
[44:27] afraid to speak what we believe in this
[44:29] message to anyone at any time under any
[44:32] kind of pressure this is strength
[44:36] oh my God I trust in thee let me not be
[44:39] ashamed let not my enemies triumph over
[44:41] me I think you should not be ashamed
[44:43] strength is not being ashamed of what we
[44:46] believe in this message
[44:47] weakness is to be ashamed of it
[44:51] oh keep my soul deliver me let me not be
[44:54] ashamed for I put my trust in thee they
[44:57] shall not be ashamed in the evil time
[44:59] and in the days of famine they shall be
[45:02] satisfied oh let not the oppressed
[45:04] return to shame let the poor in needy
[45:06] praise thy name then shall I not be
[45:09] ashamed when I have respect unto all thy
[45:11] Commandments in other words if I respect
[45:13] your Commandments in the Heat of the
[45:15] Moment then I don't have to ever be
[45:17] ashamed
[45:18] I can stand for this at any moment and
[45:22] stand strong
[45:23] even if I'm laughed at even if I've made
[45:25] fun of
[45:27] don't be ashamed can you say I would
[45:28] speak of the testimonies also before
[45:30] Kings and I will not be ashamed
[45:34] we shouldn't back down if we're before
[45:36] King
[45:37] we should proclaim the message in front
[45:39] of anybody can I get an amen this
[45:41] morning it doesn't matter if it's a king
[45:43] in public if it's the mayor of the city
[45:46] or if it's in a private moment or it's a
[45:48] text from a boy or from a girl that's an
[45:50] inappropriate comment we should not be
[45:53] ashamed and say this is what we believe
[45:56] and when I see a young person do that
[45:58] and they respond in strength to what
[46:01] this message says they might even not
[46:03] fully understand all the revelation of
[46:05] it but they're sending that message back
[46:06] when I hear about it I praise that young
[46:09] person God bless you young girl God
[46:11] bless you young man
[46:13] because the fact is is that God honors
[46:16] those who honor him God honors those who
[46:19] honor himself God prospers those
[46:22] spiritually that honor the message of
[46:24] the hour why because the message is what
[46:27] God has sent to this generation and
[46:29] whosoever shall be ashamed of me I'll be
[46:32] ashamed of him but whosoever is not
[46:34] ashamed of me and stands for the truth
[46:38] and that day I won't be ashamed of them
[46:40] God's on your side
[46:42] God has your back
[46:44] I'll stand with these young people from
[46:46] laodicea because they stood for me
[46:50] oh praise the Lord
[46:53] your Four Kings I won't be ashamed let
[46:54] my heart be sound in thy statues that I
[46:58] be not ashamed how many oh let's have
[47:01] young people that are sound
[47:03] in his statues
[47:06] sound in their thinking
[47:11] brother Bram says here concerning this
[47:13] point I say God give us boldness in men
[47:15] that will stand for truth regardless of
[47:17] what comes or goes
[47:19] that's what we need the gospel is not
[47:21] something for a gospel is for man
[47:24] God called men you never judge a man by
[47:27] how big his hands is or how wide his
[47:29] shoulders is I hear them say oh isn't he
[47:32] a man I've seen men that weighed 200
[47:35] pounds and didn't have an ounce of men
[47:37] man in them
[47:39] that's right
[47:40] you don't measure a man by his size
[47:42] that's Brute you measure him by his
[47:45] character
[47:48] the next point is she said to him boy
[47:51] this is folly this is stupidity this is
[47:54] what her responses was
[47:56] don't do this folly eminent this is
[47:59] stupidity that's what Folly is this is
[48:01] foolish that's what Folly is this is
[48:03] rashness
[48:04] boy this is stupidity this is folly this
[48:07] is not the way to handle me as a girl
[48:09] where are you getting these ideas from
[48:11] this is a filing this is foolishness
[48:13] what kind of foolish mind are you Hamden
[48:16] you're the King's son act like it
[48:22] childish this is folly this is foolish
[48:25] you're acting childish and perverted
[48:27] grow up man up act like a king son if
[48:30] that's what you are God give us curls
[48:33] with strength like this
[48:36] and so that point goes to this strength
[48:39] is calling something for what it really
[48:41] is not justifying it don't be afraid to
[48:45] call something what it really is and
[48:47] she's calling it what it is this is not
[48:49] just an attraction to one another this
[48:51] is not love this is folly
[48:55] this is foolishness
[48:57] this is rashness
[49:00] for my mouth shall speak truth and
[49:02] wickedness is an Abomination to my lips
[49:06] he that speaketh truth showeth forth
[49:08] righteousness but a false witness deceit
[49:11] but have I but have renounced the hidden
[49:14] things of dishonesty not walking in
[49:17] craftedness nor handling the word of God
[49:19] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[49:22] truth commending ourselves to Every
[49:24] Man's conscience in the fear of God in
[49:27] the sight of God what a tremendous
[49:28] scripture to say I want to live a life
[49:30] and I have renounced renounced the
[49:33] hidden things of dishonesty live life in
[49:36] the open Live Life honestly live life
[49:39] truthfully and never be afraid to call
[49:42] black black and white white
[49:44] never be afraid when something's wrong
[49:46] to call it wrong
[49:51] they're afraid to speak the truth right
[49:53] I don't care 1956. I don't care if it
[49:55] hurts the pastor or who it hurts it's
[49:57] God's Eternal Word and we're responsible
[49:59] for it the preaching of it we must tell
[50:01] the truth I don't care how bad it hurts
[50:03] can you imagine that that means that
[50:05] sometimes when you travel to tell the
[50:06] truth it hurts it's hard
[50:10] if it hurts the pastor whatever it is
[50:12] you got to tell the truth you got to be
[50:13] open can you say Amen but you know they
[50:15] spoke to the wrong man when he spoke to
[50:16] Micah you look at Micah in the Bible he
[50:19] was strong he followed after what the
[50:20] Prophet Elijah said he stood with it and
[50:23] he said they spoke to the wrong man when
[50:24] they spoke to Micah they tried to
[50:25] influence him oh no he wasn't one of
[50:27] these compromisers with his wing set to
[50:29] see if he'd get a good offering or not
[50:31] oh no no he was a man of God
[50:36] praise the Lord you love him
[50:42] God give us men who will stand for the
[50:44] truth
[50:46] regardless of who's setting close or who
[50:48] it is
[50:50] you guys I think the battery's out on
[50:52] the clock in the back
[50:56] s who are all in trouble
[50:59] give us men who will stand for the truth
[51:01] regardless who's setting closer who it
[51:03] is let the chips fall where they want to
[51:05] and lay the gospel to the healing line
[51:07] that's right call black black and white
[51:09] swipe now this isn't a quote just for
[51:12] older people this isn't a quote just for
[51:14] people to say oh that's my parents this
[51:16] is the quote for everybody call black
[51:19] black and white white and if the truth
[51:21] hurts go ahead and tell the truth
[51:22] because in the long run you'd be better
[51:24] to tell the truth than to to than to
[51:27] hide it can you say Amen
[51:29] young person you'd be better this quote
[51:31] is for you too let the kids fall where
[51:33] they want to lay the gospel of the
[51:34] healing call black black and white white
[51:36] can you say man rights right wrong's
[51:38] wrong if you're not right then get right
[51:40] it will straighten you up make you look
[51:42] different act different live different
[51:44] be different the Holy Ghost is good for
[51:46] you it will straighten you out
[51:50] next point now her next statement is and
[51:54] I wither shall I cause my shame to go I
[51:58] want to make this statement the choices
[52:00] we make today young person the choices
[52:02] we make today create the future That
[52:05] We're Dreaming of
[52:08] that's a man named Kapil totter wall and
[52:11] I think it's a good quote the choices we
[52:13] make today create the future That We're
[52:16] Dreaming of because every young person
[52:18] has a dream
[52:20] every young person has something and if
[52:23] it's based on the word of God without a
[52:25] vision the people perish every young man
[52:27] and young woman needs a vision based
[52:28] upon the word of God I got a vision for
[52:30] my life
[52:31] I got a vision for the kind of young man
[52:33] that I want to marry
[52:35] I got a scriptural vision for the kind
[52:37] of girl that I want
[52:38] you're going to approach a girl and you
[52:40] don't have that Vision in your heart yet
[52:41] based upon the way to the the word of
[52:43] God really
[52:45] you're gambling with your future
[52:48] we're not supposed to gamble either as
[52:50] Christians you're gambling with your
[52:52] future
[52:57] choices we make create the future That
[53:00] We're Dreaming of now she shows she is a
[53:02] girl who can look to the Future
[53:04] consequences of this action
[53:07] Tamar shows she's a girl who's looking
[53:09] at the future
[53:11] he was not looking at the future he was
[53:13] looking for the moment
[53:15] whether shall I cause my shame to go
[53:18] means that she was saying amnon if we do
[53:21] this how am I ever going to get rid of
[53:23] my shame she's a girl who's thinking
[53:24] about the future
[53:26] we need young people that think about
[53:28] the future
[53:30] not just for their careers but their
[53:32] testimony what will this do to my
[53:36] testimony and guess what you have
[53:38] control of your testimony you have a
[53:40] choice in your testimony
[53:42] and if you want a testimony amongst the
[53:44] congregation that builds respect because
[53:46] every young teenager loves to have the
[53:48] respect of parents and the people that I
[53:50] like you want the congregation to be
[53:52] able to say that's a that's a good young
[53:53] man they have their struggles but
[53:55] they're good they're they're trying and
[53:57] so you want that respect from the
[53:59] congregation you choose your testimony
[54:01] amongst the congregation you choose it
[54:04] and so he was blinded by his lust he
[54:07] didn't care about the future he lives
[54:08] for the one moment of pleasure and guess
[54:10] what then he ditches her
[54:13] she looks to the Future and knows the
[54:15] shame that will follow her life and his
[54:17] and she says that to him I may never
[54:20] lose the shame for this moment and I'd
[54:22] only like to correct her on that thing
[54:24] she she believes because there's no
[54:26] atonement of Calvary there
[54:28] she actually is saying something real
[54:31] I don't think I'll ever be able to get
[54:33] rid of my shame the rest of my life if I
[54:36] do this act
[54:38] wow
[54:40] but I just want to correct her just a
[54:42] little bit after Calvary
[54:45] after Calvary
[54:47] there's cleansing of sin
[54:50] somebody ought to be shouting Hallelujah
[54:52] after Calvary there's cleansing of sin
[54:56] and God can not only wash the sin away
[54:58] God can wash the guilt away God can wash
[55:01] the shame away God can restore God can
[55:04] make you a daughter son of God God can
[55:07] make you strong yes you do have hope to
[55:09] marry the right man because he can wash
[55:11] if you truly repent and have found that
[55:14] forgiveness in God he can wash it all
[55:16] away and you don't have to live the rest
[55:18] of your life with shame
[55:24] I may never lose a shame for this moment
[55:26] she says and guess what you will be
[55:28] looked at as one of the fools she said
[55:30] what do I do with my shame and as for
[55:32] thee thou shall be as one of the fools
[55:33] in Israel you won't be ever looked at
[55:35] the same buddy
[55:37] you will never be looked at the same
[55:39] you'll be looked at like a fool in
[55:41] Israel possibly for the rest of your
[55:42] life she has a long range vision for
[55:46] what this act will do she don't want a
[55:48] life of Shame and guilt she understood a
[55:51] long the long range consequences of sin
[55:54] we need young people that are strong
[55:57] around this world
[55:59] that know the consequences of sin
[56:03] because if you know what the
[56:05] consequences are then you'll have
[56:06] stronger convictions to say I don't live
[56:09] for today in the moment I don't live in
[56:11] the Heat of the Moment my testimony is
[56:13] not just now but it's for the rest of my
[56:15] life and I want to be strong that I'm
[56:18] protecting that the rest of my life
[56:23] God give us young people that understand
[56:25] long-range
[56:26] consequences of sin
[56:28] number nine
[56:31] point from this
[56:33] you should never act just in the moment
[56:36] but instead always have your future life
[56:38] and testimony in mind
[56:42] that is strength
[56:48] be not deceived God is Not mocked
[56:52] for whatsoever man soweth that shall he
[56:55] also reap
[56:58] God's not going to be mocked
[57:02] God has his principles God has his word
[57:04] and if you if you violate those things
[57:07] you sow the wrong Seas but God won't be
[57:09] mocked because he gave you his word
[57:11] before
[57:13] God is Not mock what sore man soweth for
[57:16] he that saw through the flesh shall reap
[57:17] the flesh corruption but he that soweth
[57:19] to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
[57:22] everlasting life
[57:24] I know nobody will tell me the time so I
[57:26] have to look it up myself here
[57:29] oh that's not showing it
[57:32] can't get it
[57:38] thank you says I'll go another 15
[57:40] minutes because I got one clap all right
[57:42] it sounds good
[57:44] these artists a bunch of artists went to
[57:47] Rome to study art these are young people
[57:49] all of them would go to out of the
[57:50] nighttime most of them and get a big
[57:52] drunk boys and girls lay out together
[57:54] just some of the modern the way modern
[57:56] Americans do but one young man they
[57:58] noticed that young man he didn't carry
[57:59] on like that he lived clean at night
[58:01] time he come home and went to bed
[58:03] he lived like a gentleman should and one
[58:05] day the old caretaker said I like to
[58:07] take a walk with you son he said all
[58:08] right they started up the hill walking
[58:09] together towards the setting of the Sun
[58:11] and he said Young fella you came over
[58:13] with that bunch of Americans didn't you
[58:15] and he said yes sir I did I said I want
[58:17] to ask you something he said all right
[58:19] he said why is it that you don't go out
[58:21] and drink and Carry On and lay out with
[58:23] the girls and things all through the
[58:25] night and come in the next morning the
[58:26] way they do he stopped put his arm
[58:28] around the old man he said you see the
[58:31] way that Sun is setting under it West he
[58:33] said yes sir I do he said beyond the
[58:35] setting of that sun there's a certain
[58:36] state in the New England states and said
[58:39] in that certain state is a certain city
[58:40] and in that certain city is a certain
[58:42] house and in that certain house is a
[58:45] girl
[58:47] and that girl I vowed before I come here
[58:49] to be true to her
[58:52] that when I return we're going to be
[58:55] married
[58:56] she made a vow to me a promise therefore
[58:58] sir
[58:59] all of my attention is attracted as far
[59:03] as it comes to women towards that girl
[59:06] at that place
[59:11] long range vision
[59:16] and he said I live today for tomorrow to
[59:20] come
[59:21] what a testimony
[59:25] God give us strong young people strong
[59:28] parents
[59:29] strong people in the Holy Ghost
[59:32] that In the Heat of the Moment they're
[59:34] thinking about their testimony
[59:36] you know you're an example of the rest
[59:37] of the church
[59:38] you're responsible to the rest of the
[59:40] body of Christ don't take communion
[59:43] don't children anybody else don't take
[59:45] communion unless you understand the
[59:46] soberness of it
[59:49] because if you take it unworthily and
[59:51] you're living in sin Paul says people
[59:53] could get me getting sick in the
[59:54] congregation and people could die
[59:56] because your irreverence and dishonor
[1:00:00] for the body of Christ
[1:00:02] how many knows that's Bible
[1:00:04] now I am not a prophet I can't attach
[1:00:06] things to tell who it is but you need
[1:00:09] the soberness to know if you privately
[1:00:10] sin and you take communion you could
[1:00:12] give someone a disease
[1:00:15] you could bring sickness in this body
[1:00:18] and we're going to hold on the atonement
[1:00:20] for the people who are sick the people
[1:00:21] have cancer we're going to keep trying
[1:00:24] but if I can work on this other end said
[1:00:25] don't take communion unless you've got
[1:00:27] everything under the blood and you're
[1:00:28] living a life that's going towards the
[1:00:30] Lord and not away from him
[1:00:33] things would be better if you would do
[1:00:34] that
[1:00:35] I live today for tomorrow to come what a
[1:00:37] testimony I live long-range visits and
[1:00:40] everybody can use this quote today can
[1:00:42] you say Amen all of us can live this
[1:00:44] quote I'm living today for the future
[1:00:50] what a Christian can say why don't you
[1:00:51] smoke why don't you have a little fun
[1:00:53] why don't you do this like the rest of
[1:00:55] them doing oh you can say Beyond a
[1:00:57] certain star there's a certain city and
[1:00:59] in this certain city is a certain person
[1:01:01] hallelujah oh I live for him for he died
[1:01:05] for me and someday he's coming and I
[1:01:07] live for that life that is to come
[1:01:10] that's why I live a holy life it's not
[1:01:13] legalism it's not anything like that
[1:01:15] anything these people that are
[1:01:17] detracting the message and teaching our
[1:01:20] young people that this is legalism no
[1:01:21] not when you get the Holy Ghost this is
[1:01:23] not legalism I live holy and Sanctified
[1:01:25] to my Lord not for today but I live
[1:01:29] because I want to see my Lord someday I
[1:01:31] want to go to a millennium with him
[1:01:33] and I know my acts and my Holiness won't
[1:01:36] get me in he's already purchased that
[1:01:37] but I out of respect back to the Lord
[1:01:40] what's the word say I want to live it I
[1:01:42] want to wear it
[1:01:44] because I don't live for today I don't
[1:01:46] live to be buff and you know just a a
[1:01:49] sexual type of attraction to some women
[1:01:52] or something like that I don't live for
[1:01:54] that that's today and you'll die with
[1:01:55] that but I live today for the future
[1:02:01] praise the Lord
[1:02:03] I'm enjoying this
[1:02:05] whoops
[1:02:06] all right the next point
[1:02:08] don't forget when he said I made a
[1:02:10] promise to girl over there I made a
[1:02:11] promise to her
[1:02:13] but I teach young men and young women
[1:02:14] you don't you may not have made a
[1:02:16] promise yet an engagement but you
[1:02:20] if you grow enough in the Lord you say I
[1:02:22] know God knows who my mate is somewhere
[1:02:26] so even though you don't know their name
[1:02:27] yet
[1:02:29] you can live today to protect yourself
[1:02:32] for the future
[1:02:34] and you can pray say God prepare that
[1:02:36] young man for me

[1:02:42] how to get a hold of their Bible Lord
[1:02:44] and let them introduce let them be
[1:02:46] rooted down where he knows where he
[1:02:48] belongs he knows where he goes to church
[1:02:50] and he's in relationship with you pray
[1:02:52] for him now
[1:02:53] but I don't know his name game pray for
[1:02:55] him anyway God knows his name
[1:02:59] he doesn't he knows my name God knows
[1:03:02] your name and he knows your guy's name
[1:03:06] and guys pray for that girl say God
[1:03:09] prepare that girl
[1:03:11] fill her with the Holy Ghost take him
[1:03:13] through things Lord that are just
[1:03:15] driving closer to you
[1:03:17] see
[1:03:18] he is the lord it's wonderful
[1:03:27] so
[1:03:32] here's the last thing she says
[1:03:35] I got some of you are happy
[1:03:38] it's the last thing
[1:03:40] I pray that the last effort she gives
[1:03:43] and strength to stop this
[1:03:47] amnon
[1:03:51] speak to the king
[1:03:59] what a statement of strength stop this
[1:04:02] speak to the king
[1:04:05] and he will not withhold me
[1:04:08] from thee
[1:04:11] she's saying boy
[1:04:15] do this right
[1:04:18] go through the right channels
[1:04:21] build respect not disrespect and
[1:04:24] dishonor
[1:04:25] speak
[1:04:27] to the king
[1:04:31] she's pointing this loser
[1:04:35] she and her strength is pointing this
[1:04:38] loser
[1:04:39] to the authority in both of their lives
[1:04:46] she is actually making a last-ditch
[1:04:48] effort to stop him from doing this she's
[1:04:51] giving in an Open Door
[1:04:53] actually he's a loser she's actually
[1:04:56] giving him an open door to have her
[1:05:00] the right way
[1:05:03] I tell you I'm gonna shake this girl's
[1:05:04] hand
[1:05:09] he lost his life
[1:05:11] she went on
[1:05:16] God doesn't let these things go by
[1:05:19] God knows the future
[1:05:22] and I just got to believe he went and
[1:05:23] continued to bless her life
[1:05:27] he got killed
[1:05:31] she's actually making a last-ditch
[1:05:32] effort as I'm making a last-ditch effort
[1:05:34] to close this service
[1:05:37] she made a last-ditch effort to stop him
[1:05:40] give him an open door to actually have
[1:05:42] her if he would just do it the right way
[1:05:43] now if and she now she if
[1:05:48] now she can't get out of the room
[1:05:51] but she's making an effort to point him
[1:05:53] and and this was a smart Godly girl she
[1:05:57] would never give she would never give
[1:06:01] that kid or any other boy
[1:06:05] an opportunity in her life but what I
[1:06:07] mean by that is that if she got out of
[1:06:10] that room
[1:06:11] she would never open the door again
[1:06:15] for another boy
[1:06:16] to create a situation like this
[1:06:20] why because she has a value for herself
[1:06:25] she says hey if you're going to do this
[1:06:27] do it the right way man up
[1:06:30] go through the authorities in our life
[1:06:33] if you're a man
[1:06:35] then you won't have a problem working
[1:06:37] with all the authorities that's in my
[1:06:39] life
[1:06:44] I'm going to say this to everybody just
[1:06:45] now
[1:06:46] you will never be blessed by going
[1:06:48] around the authorities the delegated
[1:06:51] authorities that's placed on on planet
[1:06:54] Earth
[1:06:56] the Bible talks Of Us talks about us
[1:06:58] obeying the authorities of the land
[1:07:00] unless they tell us to do something off
[1:07:02] the word of God
[1:07:04] God works with his delegated authorities
[1:07:08] you'll never be blessed if you go around
[1:07:10] that
[1:07:15] she says if you're a man then you won't
[1:07:16] have any problem going to the king with
[1:07:19] authorities in my life speak to the king
[1:07:21] let that be a theme for all this as I'm
[1:07:24] trying to end this now let that be a
[1:07:26] theme for all of our Lives all of the
[1:07:28] influences that come our way all the
[1:07:30] force all the pressure everything goes
[1:07:33] to the authority of the word of the king
[1:07:36] and through the filter of God's word may
[1:07:39] we live lives that everything goes
[1:07:41] through the filter of God's word this
[1:07:44] word is an authority can you say Amen
[1:07:46] let us live life to everything nothing
[1:07:49] gets done unless it's brought through
[1:07:51] the filter of God's word and if it
[1:07:53] doesn't make it through the filter of
[1:07:54] God's word it's not going to be in my
[1:07:56] life
[1:07:57] but there are delegated authorities in a
[1:07:59] person's life they're delegated
[1:08:00] authorities a pastor as one parents are
[1:08:03] one the Bible's strong about these
[1:08:05] things you can never be blessed when you
[1:08:07] go around those authorities both parents
[1:08:09] mom and dad of the boy mom and dad of
[1:08:11] the girl that's what we had in the
[1:08:13] situations with Isaac and different ones
[1:08:15] in the Bible as we've taught these
[1:08:17] things for years to realize that when
[1:08:19] God looked upon it when they went about
[1:08:20] the proper ways to go about it then you
[1:08:23] can expect God's blessing come from it
[1:08:29] so the last Point number 10 is it takes
[1:08:31] a strong guy or a girl to resolve
[1:08:34] by always going through the god-ordained
[1:08:37] channels of authority in their lives
[1:08:41] you can never go wrong by doing it
[1:08:44] it is weakness to go around all of that
[1:08:47] and my sermon to you is young people
[1:08:50] young men and young women of strength
[1:08:54] in this age
[1:08:55] and I'm trying to point out I'm trying
[1:08:58] to move you away from what's strong it's
[1:09:00] not physically it's strong in your
[1:09:02] spiritual life
[1:09:04] it's strong responses to Temptation it's
[1:09:07] strong responses to the wrong boy I wish
[1:09:10] I could say the wrong boy or the wrong
[1:09:11] girl is out there in working in
[1:09:13] Starbucks with you Starbucks box
[1:09:16] Starbucks
[1:09:19] I wish I could say that's your
[1:09:20] temptation
[1:09:22] but just because everybody attends a
[1:09:24] church doesn't mean they're feeding on
[1:09:26] the right things
[1:09:28] so you might have a boy or a girl I'm
[1:09:30] not talking about any situation here I'm
[1:09:32] talking about 35 years of pastoring
[1:09:35] I was I was doing a youth meeting
[1:09:38] my wife and I had a few things every
[1:09:40] Friday night at our house you know why I
[1:09:42] did it to give them a place to go
[1:09:43] teaching them all these years and some
[1:09:46] 30 years ago had a young girl a young
[1:09:48] boy
[1:09:49] coming to my youth beings come about six
[1:09:52] months to a year listening to every
[1:09:54] possible thing being taught to them
[1:09:56] and I find out about five years later
[1:09:58] they were doing the wrong things with
[1:10:00] one another meeting together you know
[1:10:03] and that's heartbreaking
[1:10:05] nobody knows about that I'm not going to
[1:10:07] tell you who it is but it was
[1:10:09] heartbreaking to me to realize that
[1:10:11] someone within the church could
[1:10:14] disrespect those boundaries that much
[1:10:18] this is real
[1:10:21] it's a bit sober
[1:10:23] but I just want to say we're not playing
[1:10:25] Church
[1:10:27] this has nothing to do with Paul
[1:10:29] LaFontaine what you think of him this is
[1:10:32] me pointing you to what God has given us
[1:10:36] to prosper and stabilize and protect our
[1:10:40] young people that's what this is about
[1:10:44] and the quicker that parents and young
[1:10:46] people get on track then you will you
[1:10:50] will have a you will have a strength
[1:10:52] against the weakness of this hour the
[1:10:54] weak thinking the weak mind the wisdom
[1:10:56] of this world there's so much stuff that
[1:10:58] goes on oh just let them do that and do
[1:11:00] that it's the wisdom of this world now
[1:11:01] wait a minute wait a minute I've never
[1:11:04] stopped being a parent to my kids
[1:11:06] and they don't even like it sometimes
[1:11:08] but I'm still Daddy
[1:11:09] so if they live in my home they're going
[1:11:11] to be under the guidance of my home but
[1:11:13] did I even tell them
[1:11:15] when they're married already
[1:11:17] I give my opinion even when it's not
[1:11:20] welcome
[1:11:21] because I haven't lost my position as
[1:11:23] Daddy now they can get mad they can kick
[1:11:26] and scream they cannot talk to me for
[1:11:27] six months whatever you want to do but
[1:11:30] I'm still the dad in your life and I'm
[1:11:31] going to politely just suggest I never
[1:11:33] undermine their mates I talk to them
[1:11:35] together I never unwind that they're
[1:11:37] married to somebody so I talked to both
[1:11:39] of them I said you know hey I'm daddy so
[1:11:42] I'm going to continue to be Daddy I'm
[1:11:43] going to give some input to your lives
[1:11:45] oh boy here he goes again
[1:11:49] but I don't lose my office as being a
[1:11:53] protective father when they get to a
[1:11:55] certain age who said that
[1:11:57] that's a blessing God put and there's no
[1:12:00] age limit when it says honor thy father
[1:12:01] and mother mother honor thy father and
[1:12:04] mutter
[1:12:06] I said something Wednesday night what
[1:12:09] did I say I said the wrong word or
[1:12:10] something what did it
[1:12:12] Tic Tac yeah don't get on Tic Tac
[1:12:18] I don't know what Tick Tock is but stay
[1:12:19] away from Tic Tacs
[1:12:22] it's evil
[1:12:26] so I'm still their daddy and the thing
[1:12:28] is honor thy father and mother there was
[1:12:30] no age limit on that did anybody help me
[1:12:32] out
[1:12:38] the wisdom of the world puts all this
[1:12:40] stuff no there was no way it's honor thy
[1:12:42] father that your days may be long a
[1:12:44] bunch of other promises that go with it
[1:12:46] it's just it's God's principle
[1:12:49] honor obey your father and mother
[1:12:55] and when a wife gets married she's under
[1:12:57] The Obedience of her husband she's under
[1:12:59] the headshot I understand all that I
[1:13:01] understand it but there should be a
[1:13:02] respect level from both of them that we
[1:13:04] never come to this place that we're
[1:13:06] we're free we're out of this you don't
[1:13:08] want to be out of that all the things
[1:13:09] God places in your life a pastor
[1:13:11] whatever it is you may go through
[1:13:13] Seasons you can't stand me that's okay I
[1:13:16] love you anyway
[1:13:18] you go away for five years and come back
[1:13:21] and we're still here you're going to
[1:13:23] find me preaching the same way
[1:13:26] because God's word don't change
[1:13:29] you have to get over not liking me
[1:13:32] because I had to get over not like in
[1:13:34] you
[1:13:39] takes a strong guy girl to resolve by
[1:13:42] always going through God's ordained
[1:13:43] channels of authority in their lives it
[1:13:45] is weakness to go around all of that and
[1:13:47] the scripture proclaims some things a
[1:13:50] wise man is strong here a man of
[1:13:51] knowledge increaseth strength
[1:13:55] for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy
[1:13:57] war and in multitude of counselors there
[1:13:59] is what everybody say it
[1:14:02] the multitude of counselors go through
[1:14:03] the god-given authorities you got safety
[1:14:06] ignore them you got uh you got um
[1:14:09] unprotected uh alive you you don't have
[1:14:13] safety you have fear you have scared you
[1:14:16] have you're not protected it's it's it's
[1:14:19] not safe anymore but in the multitude of
[1:14:21] God's authorities there's safety wisdom
[1:14:22] is too high for a fool he openeth not
[1:14:25] his mouth in the gate he that deviseth
[1:14:27] to do evil shall be called a mischievous
[1:14:29] person the thought of foolishness is sin
[1:14:31] and the scorner is an abomination of men
[1:14:33] if thou faint in the day of adversity
[1:14:36] adversity which means the Heat of the
[1:14:39] Moment pressure Temptation if thou faint
[1:14:42] in the day of adversity thy strength is
[1:14:44] small it's because you don't have
[1:14:46] strength that you faint In the Heat of
[1:14:49] the Moment
[1:14:50] and that's why he says a wise man is
[1:14:52] strong a man of knowledge will increase
[1:14:55] his strength I say Amen
[1:14:59] honor thy father and thy mother as the
[1:15:01] Lord that God had commanded thee that
[1:15:02] thy days may be prolonged and that it
[1:15:05] may go well with thee in the land with
[1:15:08] the Lord thy God giveth obey them that
[1:15:11] have the rule over you
[1:15:13] and submit yourselves for they watch
[1:15:16] over your souls
[1:15:19] as there's no age limit on this
[1:15:22] this is a principle can you say Amen
[1:15:25] obey them that means somebody has a rule
[1:15:28] over you if you're 80 years old somebody
[1:15:30] has to rule over you
[1:15:31] godly people have rule over you
[1:15:34] obey them that had rule overly and
[1:15:36] submit yourselves for they watch over
[1:15:37] yours as they that must give an account
[1:15:39] that they may do it with joy and not
[1:15:41] with grief for that is unprofitable for
[1:15:44] you the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:15:46] wisdom respects 1961 I'm trying to wrap
[1:15:48] up the fear of God is the being in
[1:15:49] wisdom now that don't mean that you're
[1:15:51] afraid of him but that means that you
[1:15:53] are giving him respects and reverence
[1:15:55] and when you respect God you fear God
[1:15:57] you fear that you might displease him in
[1:16:00] some way you fear lest you would do
[1:16:01] something wrong you wouldn't want to I
[1:16:04] fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my
[1:16:06] church I fear all of God's servants
[1:16:09] unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:16:11] somewhere in their way I fear the people
[1:16:13] I fear the people of this city unless I
[1:16:15] should do something that would cause
[1:16:17] them to think that I wasn't a Christian
[1:16:19] listen this is life in the open this is
[1:16:22] an accountable life this is I don't do
[1:16:25] anything on my own in my own home
[1:16:27] privately anything I represent the body
[1:16:29] of Christ and I want I have a fear of
[1:16:32] God that I don't want to do anything
[1:16:33] privately that would affect my testimony
[1:16:36] to the rest of this world and to the
[1:16:39] congregation
[1:16:40] you're not an island young person you're
[1:16:42] not to yourself you don't say I do my
[1:16:44] own thing Christians don't do their own
[1:16:46] thing we're accountable to the Holy
[1:16:48] Ghost into his body
[1:16:50] we are part of his body now you can go
[1:16:53] live a life that's not accountable to
[1:16:55] that but if God's got your number you're
[1:16:57] going to come back to it because you
[1:16:59] didn't see it as love but this is his
[1:17:01] love that he's given you in protection
[1:17:03] someday you're coming back you'll come
[1:17:06] harder you come easy but you're going to
[1:17:07] come back I'm going to raise your hand
[1:17:08] and says of those in the congregation
[1:17:10] I've come back I came back I had to
[1:17:12] learn this lesson the hard way raise
[1:17:14] your hand I had to learn this lesson the
[1:17:16] hard way young people look at look at
[1:17:18] this
[1:17:19] I had to learn this principle the hard
[1:17:21] way
[1:17:23] but how many keep your hand raised say
[1:17:24] God's grace brought me back
[1:17:27] God's grace forgave me look at that look
[1:17:28] at that jumpers God forgave them and
[1:17:31] brought them back but they had to go the
[1:17:33] hard way to learn the lesson you don't
[1:17:35] have to do that
[1:17:36] you can follow it now you can have the
[1:17:38] fear of the Lord I fear the people I
[1:17:40] fear the city I fear the God's servants
[1:17:42] unless I should do something wrong that
[1:17:44] would cause them to think that I wasn't
[1:17:47] a Christian every day that I live in the
[1:17:49] grocery stores and wherever I'm at you
[1:17:52] are manifesting the testimony of Jesus
[1:17:57] see you've got before you can have
[1:17:59] respects you've got to have fear and God
[1:18:00] demands it he demands respects God does
[1:18:02] he demands it and fear brings it and we
[1:18:04] know that fear brings respects
[1:18:10] last one it's a serious thing when we go
[1:18:12] to choose a wife a man for the vows here
[1:18:15] is untep until death do us part
[1:18:19] that's how we should keep it and when
[1:18:21] you take and you take that vow before
[1:18:23] God that only death will separate you
[1:18:25] and think we and I think we should a man
[1:18:27] in his right mind that's planning a
[1:18:29] future that he should choose that wife
[1:18:31] very careful be careful what you're
[1:18:33] doing
[1:18:34] and a woman choosing a husband or
[1:18:36] accepting the choice of a husband should
[1:18:38] be real careful what she's doing and
[1:18:41] especially in these days
[1:18:43] a man should think and pray so that's
[1:18:46] why I say do we have less teaching about
[1:18:48] it
[1:18:49] do we talk about it less
[1:18:52] no we should talk about it more parents
[1:18:55] should talk about it more with their
[1:18:56] kids
[1:18:57] preachers to preach on it more
[1:19:00] a man should think and pray before he
[1:19:04] chooses a wife
[1:19:05] not wish to bring a prayer across the
[1:19:09] parking lot first time you've seen her
[1:19:11] she's gorgeous and I'm going for it
[1:19:13] right now and you just whisper a quick
[1:19:16] Wing in a prayer
[1:19:18] God help me as I
[1:19:20] approach this sister
[1:19:23] it's not what he's talking about
[1:19:26] it's thinking it's praying it's taken
[1:19:30] some time you could ask the question
[1:19:31] Lord am I ready
[1:19:35] for the responsibility of leading a
[1:19:37] Christian home am I ready to be a Godly
[1:19:39] wife
[1:19:42] because sex
[1:19:44] will not be the answer
[1:19:47] to a union in marriage
[1:19:51] everybody has sex the world has sex all
[1:19:54] the time
[1:19:55] sorry parents for being so blunt
[1:19:57] but the devil's blunt
[1:20:00] you can have all of that you can go and
[1:20:01] have all every night you can go have all
[1:20:03] of it but there's no respect there's no
[1:20:05] commitment there's no honor none of it
[1:20:08] so that is not guaranteed a marriage
[1:20:13] it's all the other stuff
[1:20:15] woman choosing a husband accepting a
[1:20:17] choice so others should be real careful
[1:20:18] what she's doing especially in these
[1:20:19] days a man should think and pray before
[1:20:21] you choose his wife and I think today
[1:20:22] what's got so many divorce cases now
[1:20:24] that we lead the world in American
[1:20:25] divorce cases we leave the rest of the
[1:20:27] world there's more divorces than
[1:20:28] anywhere else this nation is supposed to
[1:20:29] be and thought of as a Christian Nation
[1:20:31] what a reproach our divorce courts I
[1:20:33] think the reason it is is because that
[1:20:35] men has got away from God and women has
[1:20:38] got away from God
[1:20:41] and we find that if a man prayed and
[1:20:43] prayed woman prayed over the matter not
[1:20:45] just look at a pretty set of eyes or big
[1:20:47] strong shoulders such as that or some
[1:20:49] other worldly affection but would look
[1:20:51] first to God and say God is this your
[1:20:54] plan and just before we got married I
[1:20:57] know what I had to ask her parents for
[1:20:58] her she said you'll have to ask Mother
[1:21:01] and Daddy and I thought oh I'm in for it
[1:21:03] again
[1:21:04] I said how about just asking your daddy
[1:21:06] you remember brother REM said he's in
[1:21:08] his life he said he didn't want to ask
[1:21:10] both of them but it was both of them
[1:21:13] man up you got to go with us daddy and
[1:21:16] mommy
[1:21:16] she's she's going through the channels
[1:21:21] and he was Larry so he made a deal you
[1:21:23] go to Mom tell him I'll go to Dad
[1:21:25] it's a little bit of the scare in young
[1:21:27] men to not man up and say oh boy I'm
[1:21:29] scared to do it don't ever be afraid of
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:33] if you're man enough to take on the girl
[1:21:34] you're man enough to go through God's
[1:21:35] authorities
[1:21:38] I was going to ask her daddy I was
[1:21:40] sitting there so nervous and that's
[1:21:41] that's the last of it
[1:21:43] praise the Lord
[1:21:46] God you can stand as I say these last
[1:21:49] things
[1:21:50] and hopefully our hearts are
[1:21:53] sober to the teaching of the word today
[1:21:56] hopefully there's a heart of repentance
[1:21:58] and those who need to go before the Lord
[1:22:01] maybe come to the altar this morning and
[1:22:04] speak to him about it speak to him about
[1:22:06] it in your seat
[1:22:08] but I want to say that God is calling a
[1:22:11] generation of young men and young women
[1:22:12] to strength
[1:22:14] in a week an adulterous generation he's
[1:22:16] calling young people to raise up and be
[1:22:18] strong
[1:22:19] he's calling for Purity in the middle of
[1:22:22] perversion
[1:22:23] he's calling for accountability in the
[1:22:26] middle of private sin he's calling for
[1:22:28] us to be truthful and have truth in the
[1:22:31] middle of lies he's calling for us to
[1:22:34] stand for the message in the middle of
[1:22:36] compromises of the message
[1:22:38] God is calling young men and young women
[1:22:40] to renew their strength to mount up with
[1:22:44] wings as an eagle to run and not be
[1:22:47] weary to walk and not faint
[1:22:50] that's the scripture Wednesday we read
[1:22:52] in Isaiah all of us have a place that we
[1:22:54] can renew our strength
[1:22:57] he said even the young man
[1:23:01] are getting fate and getting weary
[1:23:04] but the same promise for the adults as
[1:23:06] for the young says but they that wait
[1:23:09] upon the Lord young person do you know
[1:23:11] how to wait on the Lord
[1:23:13] I'm only 15. let me get off my back do
[1:23:16] you know how to weigh down the Lord
[1:23:17] because if you learn how to wait before
[1:23:19] the Lord and pursue the Lord
[1:23:21] you tap into the strength
[1:23:25] I'll get to that later brother no no

[1:23:28] you 14 year olds 15 years 17 year olds
[1:23:30] 13 year olds right now do you know how
[1:23:32] to wait in the Lord because the Bible
[1:23:33] says if they will wait on the Lord I'll
[1:23:35] renew their strength
[1:23:37] they shall Mount up with wings as eagles
[1:23:39] they so run and not be weary they shall
[1:23:42] walk and not faint
[1:23:45] there's a strength in the word of the
[1:23:48] Lord
[1:23:49] for this generation
[1:23:53] you feel free to come and pray if you
[1:23:55] want to come and pray
[1:23:57] his strength is perfect

[1:24:11] when we can
[1:24:13] carry all
[1:24:18] raised in his power the weak
