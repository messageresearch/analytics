[3:54] Because of
[3:57] Jesus, I have been
[4:01] [Music]
[4:04] changed because of
[4:08] Jesus. I have been changed.
[4:13] [Music]
[4:17] Luke chapter 18 and verse one. And he
[4:20] spake a parable unto them to this end,
[4:23] that men ought always to pray and not to
[4:27] faint, saying, There was in a city a
[4:30] judge, which feared not God, neither
[4:32] regarded man. And there was a widow in
[4:35] that city, and she came unto him,
[4:37] saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary."
[4:39] And he would not for a while. But
[4:42] afterward he said within himself,
[4:45] "Though I fear not God, nor regard man,
[4:48] yet because this widow trouble troubleth
[4:52] me, I will avenge her, lest by her
[4:55] continual coming, she weary me." This is
[4:59] a parable of a judge here that this
[5:02] widow kept coming and kept coming and
[5:06] did not give up and kept kept bringing
[5:09] her uh need. And we'll talk about this a
[5:11] little further tonight, but because of
[5:13] her continual coming and finally a judge
[5:16] that actually did not regard man or fear
[5:19] God, it actually worked on him to
[5:21] finally come through and stand for the
[5:23] woman. So he says in verse 5, I
[5:26] emphasize again, because this widow
[5:28] troubleeth me, I will avenge her, lest
[5:31] by her continual coming she weary me.
[5:34] And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[5:37] judge saith, and shall not God avenge
[5:42] his own elect, which cry day and night
[5:45] unto him, though he bear long with them?
[5:49] And I tell you that he will avenge them
[5:52] speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of
[5:55] man cometh, shall he find faith on the
[5:58] earth." This is actually goes into a
[6:00] prophecy for the end time, this parable,
[6:03] because he's actually asking when the
[6:04] son of man comes at the coming of the
[6:06] Lord, will he find this kind of faith
[6:09] when he comes? This faith that won't
[6:13] quit. This faith that keeps coming to
[6:16] the judge, this faith that will not be
[6:19] turned down. That's the kind of faith we
[6:21] need towards God. Last couple services
[6:23] we showed that God doesn't care by just
[6:26] saying he cares and putting his hand on
[6:28] your shoulder and say, "I care." God is
[6:30] a supernatural God that wants to care by
[6:32] doing something different to change the
[6:34] situation. I'm just laying that
[6:36] foundation again so you understand why
[6:38] we're on this series and talking about
[6:40] it. God stepping into the situation is
[6:43] how he shows he cares. Changing,
[6:46] creating, uh doing the impossible, doing
[6:49] the supernatural. And then we find
[6:52] there's another side to it. But he he's
[6:55] stepping in to show that he cares. But
[6:58] he does it because the right thing on
[7:00] your side, on the believer's side, the
[7:03] right attitude, the right atmosphere, uh
[7:06] the right openness, the right honesty,
[7:08] the right sincere confession. You'll
[7:10] find all of these things in the message.
[7:12] There are things that we bring as a as
[7:15] an attitude that show we care about a
[7:18] caring God. We care about getting help.
[7:21] We're not running from it, but we're
[7:22] running towards it. And so I just I want
[7:25] to make it clear at the uh at the I'll
[7:27] make these things clear at the middle or
[7:29] towards the end uh that brother Brandham
[7:31] leaves no doubt to this key when he says
[7:34] at the end he said God cares and this is
[7:37] what I've been preaching on. God cares
[7:39] when you care but you have to care
[7:42] first. So, um I know there are no doubt
[7:45] times when we are so away from God and
[7:48] and and God just comes down and grabs us
[7:51] out of the miry clay. I know God can do
[7:54] that. But when we're believers and we're
[7:56] coming to him for a certain need, God is
[7:58] looking for our attitude that's an
[8:01] that's a kind of a relentless uh faith
[8:04] that says, "Listen, I'm not just
[8:06] halfhazardly asking. I'm asking and I'm
[8:09] continually asking and I'm waiting God
[8:12] for God to step in in a supernatural
[8:13] way. Can you say amen? So God cares when
[8:16] you care, but you have to care first. So
[8:18] if this is true, then we should work our
[8:20] way through this message that has been
[8:22] preached to learn the ways that we show
[8:25] we care. I don't want to miss any of the
[8:27] ways. I don't want to have an area in my
[8:29] life that I'm an attitude that I'm
[8:31] presenting to God that makes God
[8:33] hesitate towards me. I don't want
[8:35] anything hindering my faith. I don't
[8:38] want anything in the way. And most
[8:39] believers are very sensitive to this. Uh
[8:42] I've had phone calls this week. Is that
[8:44] is am I doing something wrong? Brother
[8:46] Paul is do I have a lack of faith and
[8:48] say, "Well, I'm I'm not I say I I'm a
[8:50] pro I'm not a prophet. I don't know."
[8:52] But believers have should have a
[8:54] sincerity. They want to examine every
[8:56] part of their life. Is there anything
[8:58] that's blocking this? Is there any sin?
[9:00] Is there something I don't know? And
[9:02] just that attitude itself, I think God
[9:05] appreciates because there are some
[9:07] things that are mysterious. So, we just
[9:08] don't know why they're going on. But our
[9:11] job is to stand there before God and
[9:13] say, "God, if there's a hindrance to my
[9:15] faith, help me. Show me that you remove
[9:18] all hindrances so the flow of faith can
[9:21] flow freely through me and all the
[9:24] hindrances will be removed." Can you say
[9:25] amen? There seems to be with the Lord
[9:27] sometimes that there's something that's
[9:30] real hard that is put out there by the
[9:33] Lord that that makes it a bit of a a
[9:36] challenge for us to break through so
[9:39] that we show that we're serious about
[9:41] it. And he gave the example it seemed
[9:43] like the Lord is g he gives a bit of a
[9:45] test to show if we really mean it and
[9:47] want help. And the great great example
[9:49] we gave gave was this non who was asked
[9:52] to go wash himself seven times in the
[9:56] worst muddy river in the whole region.
[9:59] Can you say amen? So that shows us that
[10:02] his his blessing of his healing of his
[10:05] leprosy was just just waiting right
[10:08] there. But he had to go through some
[10:10] muddy waters and be washed before he
[10:13] come to a supernatural God. And that
[10:16] says something about God's character.
[10:19] And some people are not willing to go
[10:21] through the muddy waters to get to the
[10:24] real
[10:24] deliverance. You know, for non it was a
[10:27] new thing to him. So he reasoned with
[10:29] that. And why can't I go to the the
[10:31] waters that are cleaner and you know,
[10:33] he's a he's a ruler there in Syria. So
[10:36] he's probably not used to ever being in
[10:38] muddy waters like that and thinks it's a
[10:40] dirty thing. So he's reasoning in his
[10:42] mind. He thought it was going to happen
[10:44] a certain way with the prophet and we
[10:45] get in our minds and the one thing we
[10:47] need to learn about God. Don't tell God
[10:49] how he's going to bring the deliverance
[10:51] or the or the healing. Can you say,
[10:53] "Man, don't tell don't have your mind
[10:55] already set in concrete, but say, God,
[10:58] whatever you use to do it, whatever
[11:00] muddy waters I have to go through, I'm
[11:02] willing to do it. And I'm willing to do
[11:04] it not five or six times. I'm willing to
[11:06] wash seven times. Whatever he says to
[11:09] do, that's the obedience that we should
[11:10] offer." But you see, he had to go wash
[11:13] seven times in the worst mighty river.
[11:15] What uh what do we what do you have? Uh
[11:18] sometimes, you know, uh referring to
[11:21] Elisha, he's speaking of there's a
[11:23] there's a real transition from Elijah to
[11:27] Elisha in ministries. Now, that being
[11:30] said, Elisha asked Elijah that a double
[11:33] portion of his spirit would come on him.
[11:35] And there are some miracles and things
[11:37] that he did that Elisha did that are
[11:40] similar. But if you really read your
[11:42] Bible, and I can't read it tonight, but
[11:43] if you read it and you pull out the
[11:45] differences, there's a because brother
[11:48] says you got Elijah and he was bold and
[11:51] he's speaking to Jezebel and he's
[11:53] speaking the whole political system.
[11:55] He's speaking against the king. It's
[11:57] more of a dispensational, more of a a a
[12:00] political rebuke over the whole nation,
[12:03] over the whole thing of Israel. But when
[12:05] it come to Elisha, it was more of a
[12:07] personal ministry to the widow. It was
[12:10] more it wasn't an international thing.
[12:12] It was taking the same double the spirit
[12:14] double portion of it, but it was
[12:16] ministering personally. And I find in
[12:19] the incidences with it is that in
[12:22] Elisha's incidence in dealing with the
[12:24] people, there was something that he
[12:26] asked for from them first where Elijah,
[12:29] he would just he would go do it. He
[12:31] would speak it. He'd say there would be
[12:32] no more rain. But you see now Elisha
[12:34] says in these in the in the muddy radar
[12:36] he said go dip seven times then you'll
[12:38] get your healing. He told the woman uh
[12:41] what do you have in your home? What can
[12:42] you offer me? And she said I got a
[12:44] little cruise of oil. Go get that cruise
[12:46] of oil. Well that's all we got. Well
[12:48] look at now what he's asking for. Take
[12:50] everything you got. Give it to me. I'll
[12:52] take it. And then he's God's testing us.
[12:54] Are you willing to do the hard thing in
[12:57] order to get to your miracle? Amen. And
[13:00] Elisha just dealt a a bit different with
[13:03] the people. He told the rich young
[13:04] ruler, he got him where his where it
[13:07] counts in his uh his billful, his bank
[13:12] account. God always knows where to get
[13:14] us, doesn't he? Most of us, he does he
[13:16] wouldn't test us with our bank accounts
[13:18] because we don't have very much. But
[13:20] with the rich young ruler, it was
[13:21] everything.
[13:23] So it was the rich young ruler kept
[13:25] probing saying, "Uh, I've done all the
[13:27] commandments, but I really want eternal
[13:29] life. I want He's the one that kept
[13:31] asking." So then Jesus said, "All right,
[13:33] go sell everything that you have and
[13:34] give it to the
[13:37] poor." He's feeling the pain of that.
[13:39] And God God got him right where his pain
[13:42] was, right? The hard thing to give up.
[13:45] You don't think some of these things
[13:47] that's in the word about a woman's dress
[13:50] and these different things, you think
[13:52] sometimes it's just all we write it off.
[13:54] But you see, sometimes it can be a test.
[13:56] Are you willing to do the little thing?
[14:00] How important is you to hang on to this
[14:02] thing? I'm going to dress this way. I'm
[14:03] going to hold on to this. And God just
[14:05] test somebody. And he tests every one of
[14:07] us a little different because he knows
[14:10] if we're serious and we care, then he's
[14:13] going to test us if we care. And just
[14:15] some more things about the uh the
[14:18] supernatural here or about uh uh non. Um
[14:21] in the story of non God through the
[14:23] prophet dealt with leprosy different
[14:25] than he had before. People had leprosy
[14:28] and until that point the only answer was
[14:30] for them to just deal with it. Just
[14:32] you's ever heard that just deal with it.
[14:34] You know you got leprosy just deal with
[14:36] it. And to separate you had to go out in
[14:37] a camp. So there wasn't too much that's
[14:39] dealt with. Now in this incident when
[14:42] Elisha type of the bride Elijah's come
[14:45] Elisha Sha is she type of the bride. How
[14:48] is he dealing with leprosy? Well he's
[14:50] dealing with it a different way. He said
[14:52] go he says go dip seven times in Jordan
[14:55] and your leprosy will be healed. We
[14:58] never seen it quite that way. But I want
[15:00] to bring the point. Don't ever question
[15:03] what God is asking you to do because he
[15:07] might ask you to do something that is
[15:09] strange to the mind, but God knows what
[15:12] he's doing. Can I get an amen? Trust God
[15:15] he knows what he's doing. And and so uh
[15:18] it was a crazy thing to do. Non had to
[15:20] uh lay down all of his ideas and all his
[15:23] uh everything and trust what the prophet
[15:25] said to do. Uh and do something.
[15:27] Sometimes he has to do something that we
[15:29] don't agree with or we don't want to do
[15:31] but it got the results. Isn't that the
[15:34] thing that counts? Does it get results?
[15:36] We are result we are are resultoriented
[15:39] people. We want to see a supernatural
[15:41] God. We want to see
[15:44] results in in God's own time. But we're
[15:47] looking for results. The word in that
[15:49] day was dealing and I believe it deals
[15:52] this in this day with modern problems
[15:54] and personal problems. The answers are
[15:57] here and we overlook the answer because
[16:00] the answer is not in the way doesn't
[16:03] come the way we expected sometimes. So
[16:06] under Elisha and Elijah it's a it's a
[16:08] change in the ministry. Same spirit
[16:11] double portion of the spirit but through
[16:13] the bride's ministry now it's more of a
[16:15] personal work. It's not an international
[16:17] work. Even the third pole says it's not
[16:19] a public show. So, it's more of a
[16:21] personal Elijah dealt personally and and
[16:24] so you would need to study that real
[16:26] close in your Bible in First Kings and
[16:28] Second Kings to see those types and
[16:30] shadows there and see the differences
[16:32] between Elijah and Elisha. This is not
[16:35] the days of Elijah anymore in our day,
[16:37] but we're in the days of Elisha. So,
[16:39] those types and shadows should be a
[16:41] blessing to you to see in the word
[16:43] because we're living in that time. Can
[16:45] you say amen? So, when we go to read
[16:47] these two examples of Brother Brand, he
[16:48] cares and you care. Uh uh I want to read
[16:50] those but I want to give this scriptural
[16:52] base first in Luke 18 that we read as a
[16:55] text. I want to lay this and so now the
[16:57] text speaks of a parable of an unjust
[17:01] judge. It what what this does in this
[17:04] parable is basically takes an extreme
[17:08] example of a judge that's very distant,
[17:11] very detached. Uh it says he doesn't he
[17:15] doesn't revere God. He doesn't rever
[17:17] man. He's insensitive. He He's He He
[17:21] doesn't want to have a hands-on with the
[17:23] people's problems at all. And so, the
[17:26] scripture goes to an extreme to show
[17:28] this unjust judge is completely detached
[17:31] to wanting to meet a need of this
[17:33] nobody, this little widow woman. He's
[17:35] completely detached from it. and and uh
[17:38] it it takes it to an extreme of a judge
[17:41] that's very distant, unreachable, and no
[17:45] fear of God and didn't regard man. Of
[17:48] course, that's not our God. Uh he's not
[17:50] that way. He's a just God. How many
[17:52] believe he's a just God? He's a just
[17:54] judge and he is a judge. But we're
[17:56] learning in this series, thank God, he's
[17:59] a God who cares.
[18:01] So, he's a just God, but he's a God who
[18:04] cares. And and so you say, "Well, why
[18:07] does this parable speak of this this
[18:09] woman, a type of the bride, coming to
[18:11] this unjust judge?" Because I believe
[18:13] it's using an extreme of a completely
[18:16] detached uh uh God or judge who doesn't
[18:20] care. And I'm wondering if it's put in
[18:22] the Bible that way because that's the
[18:24] way people will begin to view God.
[18:29] So he goes to this way that's extreme in
[18:32] this parable to say he's unjust. He
[18:34] doesn't fear God. He doesn't care. He's
[18:37] he he doesn't he's not going to listen
[18:40] to anybody who knocks on the door at
[18:42] all. He don't have any time for it. And
[18:44] that's the way people start to feel with
[18:47] God. And so that's why they give up so
[18:49] quickly because they think God can't
[18:53] supernaturally come in or they're
[18:55] unworthy for God to do something or
[18:58] somehow uh he's not going to listen to
[19:00] me or I knocked one time and he didn't
[19:03] respond so I'm giving up. But God does
[19:06] not want you to give up.
[19:09] I said God doesn't want you to give up.
[19:12] And so the people got this the it's the
[19:15] way people look at God today. They feel
[19:17] so far away. They feel so unworthy to
[19:20] get his attention. Now, when you got a
[19:22] widow, you have a widow is someone who
[19:24] doesn't have a husband. She She has no
[19:27] advocate. She has no protector. She has
[19:29] no head. She actually has nothing. She
[19:32] can't help herself. That's a widow in
[19:34] the Bible. She has no she has nothing
[19:36] left. A lot of times, most cases,
[19:37] they're poor because they don't have
[19:39] anybody to support them. So, a widow
[19:41] represents someone who's helpless. In
[19:44] other words, they don't have money. They
[19:46] don't have position. They they've lost
[19:48] uh their position, their identity with
[19:51] their husband because her husband's
[19:52] gone. And so they've lost everything
[19:54] that would be an earthly way for her to
[19:56] have any credibility to come before this
[19:59] judge. She doesn't have anything to get
[20:02] her in the front door. Nothing. And God
[20:05] uses that as a type of the bride in the
[20:08] last days. Let me tell you friends,
[20:10] we're helpless without him.
[20:13] Come on, why don't you agree with me?
[20:14] We're helpless without him. The problems
[20:16] that are facing us today, we're helpless
[20:18] without this great God to come on the
[20:20] scene. That's why we'll learn to be more
[20:23] dependent on him, more dependent on a
[20:25] supernatural God, more dependent on
[20:27] finances. Can you say amen? It's a good
[20:29] thing that we're pressured because we
[20:31] learn how to pray more. We learn how to
[20:32] depend on him more instead of depending
[20:35] on our own plans.
[20:38] He wants us to be dependent on him. So
[20:40] this widow is someone who has no
[20:42] husband, has no advocate, no protector.
[20:44] She has nothing. She can't help herself.
[20:46] She and then she can't stand up to her
[20:49] enemy uh by herself. She has no power
[20:53] against her adversary. She's helpless to
[20:56] this adversary. I don't know who was
[20:58] bothering her and badgering her,
[21:00] probably trying to steal from her, take
[21:02] advantage of her and but she had an
[21:05] adversary and she had she was powerless
[21:08] for somebody to deal with that
[21:09] adversary. And she said, "I'm going to
[21:11] have to try to go to a higher power
[21:13] because I can't deal with my adversary
[21:16] myself." Is anybody listening to me here
[21:18] tonight? You're in a good spot when
[21:20] you're helpless.
[21:22] You're in a good spot when you say, "I'm
[21:24] going to have to go to I can't go to any
[21:26] other place but to God about this."
[21:28] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." You're
[21:29] in a good when nothing but a miracle
[21:31] will do. My sister Sherry said, "You get
[21:33] in spots when there when nothing but a
[21:36] miracle will do."
[21:38] Hallelujah. So she appeals to the higher
[21:41] court to bring vengeance on her enemy or
[21:45] is called in scripture her adversary.
[21:47] Hey, we have an adversary. That's right.
[21:51] The devil going about seeking whom he
[21:54] may devour.
[21:56] We have the same adversary. Can you say
[21:58] amen? We have This is the bribe. This is
[22:00] the type of the bride. We have an
[22:02] adversary. And many times we're helpless
[22:05] against this adversary. and she appeals
[22:08] to the highest court, this judge. And
[22:10] she didn't know, I don't know how I'm
[22:12] going to to get through to him, but it's
[22:14] the only power that I can go to to deal
[22:18] with this adversary. It's the only one
[22:20] that I can appeal to, but I'm going to
[22:22] go do it. I have no money. I have no
[22:25] prestige. I have no husband. I have no
[22:28] but I'm going to go to him and I'm going
[22:30] to ask anyway.
[22:33] Many times friends were helpless. But
[22:36] she did not come just one time. The
[22:38] parable is something deeper than just
[22:41] her coming one time. She didn't come one
[22:43] time, but
[22:46] she she came over and over and over and
[22:50] over again. She didn't give up.
[22:54] The first few times she came, he didn't
[22:57] even listen. He didn't she he didn't
[22:59] even hear her. He didn't even bring her
[23:01] in. and he didn't let her in, but she
[23:02] kept knocking. She kept presenting her
[23:05] case to the servant, whoever, however
[23:07] she did it. And she kept and she didn't
[23:10] give up. There's a key here that we must
[23:12] see, and I know it might be simple to
[23:14] you tonight, but we need to not just nod
[23:16] and say, "Amen." We need to live this
[23:17] out every day. That she wearied this
[23:21] judge by what? One thing, her continual
[23:24] coming to him. I'm not giving up. I'm
[23:28] not taking no for an answer.
[23:31] Now, I know that God says no sometimes
[23:33] to certain things, we should be happy
[23:34] with, brother, we should happy with his
[23:36] yeses or nos. But when we're talking
[23:38] about deliverance and we know God could
[23:40] do it, our duty is to stand there with
[23:42] all faith and keep saying, "Listen,
[23:44] Lord, I'm going to keep coming to you
[23:46] and believe that you can do this."
[23:50] Hallelujah. So, she came not one time,
[23:53] but she and and just gave up after one
[23:56] time. There's a key must we must see
[23:58] here. If we really want help, we're
[24:01] going to be desperate. We're going to be
[24:04] perseverant. And that's how we show that
[24:07] we really care.
[24:11] We're not to faint. And that's what he
[24:13] says at the beginning of the parable. He
[24:15] says, "Men ought always to pray." In
[24:18] other words, you didn't just pray,
[24:20] "Lord, please help me with this." And
[24:22] you don't visit it again. Men are always
[24:24] to pray. and not faint. What does the
[24:29] word faint mean? I'm glad you
[24:33] asked. Men are to pray always and not
[24:37] faint. It can refer in the physical to
[24:40] physical
[24:41] exhaustion. Physical exhaustion. And we
[24:45] we can't sometimes we don't have a
[24:47] choice in that. We just are physically
[24:50] exhausted. And so that's and then
[24:52] somebody faints. But then in the
[24:54] spiritual it means a spirit that comes
[24:58] into discouragement. It's a
[25:00] discouragement of your spirit to give
[25:03] up.
[25:04] That's
[25:06] fainting. Oh, do we have a lot of that
[25:08] today? Giving up on God, giving up on
[25:11] the message seen too much. Their spirit,
[25:15] it actually happens sometimes internally
[25:18] for months and years before you see an
[25:20] outward expression. I'm through with
[25:22] this. I'm throwing up my hands for
[25:24] years. They give up in their spirit and
[25:27] they're let down. And so they faint in
[25:29] their spirit. Exhaustion. They they fade
[25:31] out. They uh that's why the Bible says,
[25:33] "Be not weary and welloing for in due
[25:36] season you shall reap if you faint not."
[25:40] Uh they that wait upon the Lord shall
[25:43] renew their strength. They shall mount
[25:46] up with wings as eagles and they shall
[25:48] not faint. Can you say amen? So there's
[25:50] a strength by this continual coming,
[25:52] this continual laying before God. And so
[25:55] but this discouragement of spirit is
[25:57] what fate means. And uh when people get
[25:59] a discouragement in their spirit, that's
[26:02] the worst thing because they they
[26:04] quickly can quit trying. They quit
[26:06] trying. They quit praying. They quit
[26:09] trying. They they there there's there's
[26:11] they're just I've tried this. And she
[26:13] meant businesses was not going to give
[26:16] up. This widow was not going to give up.
[26:18] She meant business and she showed she
[26:20] cared and she actually wearied the judge
[26:23] by her continual coming. She just kept,
[26:26] you know, she showed up at the
[26:30] court. She showed up at his
[26:32] house. She showed up when he was working
[26:35] out at the
[26:36] gym. She showed up every You know, they
[26:38] say there's a saying in the world says
[26:41] 90% of success is just showing up. And
[26:43] this widow kept showing up. I'm still
[26:46] here. He's going, "Is she Is that the
[26:49] same woman? She's been coming for months
[26:52] now. She's at my door again. I'm She's
[26:55] actually frustrating and she's making
[26:58] the judge weary. She wasn't weary. She's
[27:02] making the judge weary by her continual
[27:05] coming until finally she brings out an
[27:09] unjust judge who doesn't care for man,
[27:12] doesn't fear God, so distant from the
[27:15] from this need. It doesn't matter. She
[27:19] by her faith draws the power of this
[27:23] judge out to the front door says, "Bring
[27:25] her in. I'll talk to her. I'll avenge
[27:27] her enemy."
[27:29] It shows what faith can do. Amen. It
[27:32] shows but faith that is uh rel
[27:35] relentless continue coming bringing it.
[27:39] I'm not going to give up. That's the
[27:40] kind of faith that God wants to see. Can
[27:42] you say amen? Wherever he was, she came
[27:45] after him, showing him and showing up in
[27:48] front of him and saying, "You are my
[27:50] only hope and I mean business. I'm not
[27:53] going away until I get through to see
[27:56] him." And finally, she pulled a distant
[27:59] judge on the scene. She kept showing up
[28:03] until he showed up. Oh, put that on the
[28:06] refrigerator. She kept showing up until
[28:08] he showed up. Thank you for watching our
