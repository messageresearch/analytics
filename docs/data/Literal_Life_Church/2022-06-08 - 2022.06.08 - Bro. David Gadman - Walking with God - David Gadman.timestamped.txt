[0:00] just kind of break the ice and you know
[0:02] get on get all my scaredness out of the
[0:04] way
[0:05] this is called some church members it
[0:07] says fred somebody thomas everybody
[0:10] peter anybody and joe nobody were
[0:12] neighbors
[0:14] but they were not like you me they were
[0:16] odd people
[0:18] and most difficult to understand the way
[0:20] the way they lived was a shame
[0:22] all four belong to the same church but
[0:24] you would not have enjoyed worshiping
[0:26] with them
[0:27] everybody went fishing on sunday or
[0:30] stayed home to visit with friends
[0:32] anybody wanted to worship but was afraid
[0:35] somebody wouldn't speak to him
[0:37] so guess who went to church yeah nobody
[0:40] really nobody was the only decent one of
[0:42] the four nobody did the visiting nobody
[0:46] worked on the church building once they
[0:48] needed a sunday school teacher
[0:50] everybody thought anybody would do it
[0:52] and anybody thought somebody would do it
[0:54] and you know who did it that's exactly
[0:56] right nobody it happened that a fifth
[0:59] neighbor an unbeliever moved into the
[1:00] area
[1:01] everybody thought somebody to try to win
[1:04] them for christ
[1:05] anybody could have made an effort you
[1:08] probably know who finally won him
[1:11] amen this little parable
[1:14] brings to focus again the fact that each
[1:15] one of us is personally responsible for
[1:17] god's work if we leave it for somebody
[1:20] or everybody or anybody nobody will do
[1:22] it let's work till jesus comes
[1:25] so i thought that was real good

[3:37] us lord
[3:39] allowing us once again to be able to
[3:40] gather in your house
[3:42] with brothers and sisters of like
[3:43] precious faith and father we just asked
[3:46] oh god that you just help us tonight
[3:47] lord
[3:48] as we would
[3:50] try to draw something from
[3:52] each other lord and from your word
[3:54] father
[3:55] lord because lord that's what we come
[3:57] here for is draw strength one from
[4:00] another lord

[4:04] father i pray lord that we can all pull
[4:06] from your gift tonight lord
[4:08] would you speak to us through your word
[4:09] lord maybe through a song or whatever it
[4:11] may be father just speak to us lord
[4:13] jesus
[4:14] and when we leave this building we can
[4:16] say like they did on the road to emmaus
[4:18] did not our hearts burn within us as you
[4:20] talk with us along the way and we'll be
[4:22] careful to give you the glory and the
[4:24] honor and the praise for it all for we
[4:26] ask these things in saying
[4:28] amen
[4:29] if you have your bibles tonight turn
[4:31] with me to the book of genesis the fifth
[4:33] chapter then in genesis the sixth
[4:36] chapter
[4:39] try not to hold you very long or you
[4:42] just want to
[4:43] say what maybe the lord's led up put
[4:45] upon our hearts to say tonight and just
[4:48] appreciate the invitation from brother
[4:49] paul and just each and every one of you
[4:51] tonight hey man
[4:53] genesis the fifth chapter and we want to
[4:55] look at the 22nd verse
[4:59] and enoch walked with god
[5:01] after he begat methuselah 300 years and
[5:04] began sons and daughters
[5:06] and all the days of enoch were
[5:09] five years
[5:11] and enoch walked with god
[5:13] and he was not
[5:14] for god took him
[5:16] then over in the sixth chapter
[5:19] and the eighth and ninth verse
[5:22] it says but noah found grace in the eyes
[5:25] of the lord
[5:26] these are the generations of noah
[5:29] noah was a just man
[5:31] and are perfect in his generations
[5:33] and noah
[5:35] walked with god
[5:37] may the lord add his blessings to the
[5:39] reading of the word you may be seated
[5:41] i like to take for a thought if i can
[5:42] tonight just for a little bit
[5:45] walking with god
[5:48] walking with god and so we just we just
[5:50] look at this and we find out we see here
[5:53] in the book of genesis and there where
[5:55] it said in the that enoch walked with
[5:58] god and went on when we read in the
[5:59] sixth verse it said that noah found
[6:02] grace in the eyes of the lord and that's
[6:03] what i want to find tonight if i can
[6:06] is grace in his eyes i may not find
[6:09] grace in your eyes tonight but as long
[6:11] as i can find grace in his eyes i think
[6:13] i'll be all right cause i sure do want
[6:16] his grace and his mercy to us i sure
[6:18] don't want his judgment and we find out
[6:21] that here noah it says that but noah
[6:23] found grace in the eyes of the lord and
[6:25] these are the generations that knowing
[6:26] those are perfect was a just man perfect
[6:29] in his generations and we find out
[6:31] according to that message of the and the
[6:33] scriptures that we've been that
[6:36] was in the age where it was just evil
[6:38] altogether
[6:40] just everywhere you turn just evil on
[6:43] every hand just like it is today because
[6:45] the scripture did say over there in
[6:47] saint luke as it was in the days of uh
[6:49] uh a lot as it was in the days of noah
[6:52] shall shot me
[6:53] and we see that today we see all these
[6:55] things happening to us today don't we
[6:58] we see all these things happening and
[7:00] everything and it just goes to show us
[7:02] that you know do we still can walk with
[7:04] god if noah walked with god and the age
[7:07] that he was living in where the bible
[7:09] says that the all the imagine every man
[7:12] all the man's imagination was evil
[7:15] everywhere you turned was evil just
[7:17] sodom everywhere but noah still found
[7:20] grace in the eyes of the lord and the
[7:22] bible says and noah walk with god
[7:25] so if noah could do that what about me
[7:27] and you tonight amen we can walk with
[7:30] god
[7:32] i like that amen we can walk with god
[7:34] just the way that noah did we can find
[7:36] grace in the eyes of the lord but let's
[7:39] just look i want to look at for a little
[7:41] bit tonight at enoch's walk with god
[7:44] let's look at it here just here for a
[7:47] little bit it says
[7:48] let me just start with this what is
[7:50] meant by enoch's walk
[7:52] i think it was a walk that was it was
[7:55] pleasing to
[7:56] god because the scripture says over
[7:59] there in hebrews the fifth chapter and
[8:01] the and hebrews 11 chapter i mean in the
[8:03] fifth verse and sixth verse it says by
[8:05] faith enoch was translated
[8:08] that he should not see death and was not
[8:10] found because god had translated him for
[8:13] before his translation he had this
[8:16] testimony brother paul that he pleased
[8:18] god that's the kind of testimony i want
[8:21] tonight that my walk is pleasing to him
[8:26] said this walked please god
[8:29] he had that testimony that he pleased
[8:31] god
[8:33] verse 6 says but without faith
[8:36] we all know what faith is a revelation
[8:39] revelation of what god wants his word
[8:42] revelation how god wants us to live and
[8:44] how he wants us to act
[8:47] says by but without faith it is
[8:49] impossible to please him
[8:51] for he that cometh to god must believe
[8:54] that he is
[8:56] he that cometh to god must believe that
[8:59] he is god i believe he's god tonight
[9:02] amen we heard the testimony about that
[9:05] brother he's still the same god tonight
[9:09] amen i don't care who you are or what
[9:11] you think you are he's still jesus
[9:13] christ the same yesterday today and
[9:15] forever
[9:17] god hasn't lost it power god didn't go
[9:19] off the scene in 1965 god's still here
[9:23] and he's still god
[9:26] amen he's still the same god
[9:29] amen if he healed back then he can heal
[9:32] today
[9:33] because he's still the same yesterday
[9:35] today and forever if he saved back then
[9:37] he can save the day
[9:39] amen if he delivered back then he can
[9:41] deliver today amen if you need
[9:43] deliverance tonight he can deliver you
[9:47] because i believe that he
[9:49] amen
[9:51] must first believe that he is
[9:53] amen
[9:55] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[9:57] diligently seek him
[10:00] i looked up that word diligently because
[10:01] i ain't too smart and it means an
[10:03] energetic application
[10:05] so i believe that when we come into the
[10:06] house of god we are to put an energetic
[10:09] application to it
[10:11] amen we are going to put something forth
[10:13] to it we should let the soul leader do
[10:15] it all we should let the prayer people
[10:18] do it all we shouldn't let the preacher
[10:20] do it all but we have a part to do
[10:24] amen i want to put everything i got into
[10:26] the service tonight
[10:28] amen and not just tonight but every
[10:31] service i tend to i want to put
[10:33] everything i got into it
[10:35] amen
[10:37] i don't have to wait for the doctor to
[10:39] say let's raise our hands there should
[10:40] be just something on the inside of me
[10:42] that's burning amen and i can't help it
[10:45] but i raised my hands to the one who
[10:47] bled and died for me
[10:51] hallelujah
[10:53] amen
[10:54] he's a rewarder of them that do that
[10:57] you want to get something out of the
[10:59] service you're going to put something
[11:00] into the service
[11:01] amen so i want to come here tonight and
[11:04] put my part in the service amen and say
[11:07] god you promised amen it's according to
[11:09] your word that you're a rewarder of them
[11:11] that diligently seek you so i'm seeking
[11:13] you tonight with everything i got
[11:17] amen i believe that's what was meant by
[11:19] enoch's walk
[11:21] amen
[11:22] that is what was pleasing
[11:24] hey man
[11:26] now he didn't do no special deed
[11:28] he probably didn't have no special gift
[11:30] but by faith
[11:32] he walked with god
[11:34] amen that's what it is tonight my
[11:36] friends it's a faith walk amen there's
[11:39] some things we might not understand we
[11:41] might not can comprehend amen but i know
[11:44] one thing that god's got everything in
[11:45] control amen we may look at the picture
[11:48] tonight
[11:49] the way the world's going and it may
[11:51] look bleak you say oh brother david it
[11:52] looks awful and i say amen but i tell
[11:55] you what we got a god that can see us
[11:57] through
[11:58] amen he never did say he'd see us around
[12:00] it it says over it he sees under it but
[12:02] he promised that he'd see us through it
[12:05] amen and i believe tonight my god can
[12:07] see me through
[12:10] hallelujah
[12:11] wasn't no special gift that he had
[12:14] but it was just by faith that he walked
[12:16] he took god at his word
[12:18] amen god said it he believed it that's
[12:21] what i want to do tonight just take god
[12:23] in his word lord whatever you say i
[12:25] believe it lord you said you can heal me
[12:27] then i believe it lord
[12:29] amen you said you'd fill me with the
[12:31] holy ghost then i believe it lord you
[12:33] can give me the baptism lord you can
[12:35] give me a refilling
[12:37] if that's what i so desire tonight
[12:40] hey and a lot of us need that
[12:42] amen we need god to recharge us again
[12:45] amen we need god to come on the scene
[12:47] and baptize us once again
[12:49] refill us with the holy ghost you know
[12:52] the bible says that the church was
[12:55] birthed in acts 2.
[12:59] amen
[13:00] they were birthed that's when the church
[13:01] was birthed but in acts 4 they was back
[13:04] in the upper room praying and crying say
[13:06] lord you see their threatenings you see
[13:08] they beat us they're going to they said
[13:10] that they'd whip this lord let's say
[13:12] they'd stone us and kill us if we preach
[13:13] anymore in your name
[13:15] come lord help us and the bible says the
[13:17] place where they were gathered where
[13:19] was shaken and they were all filled
[13:21] with the holy ghost and they went out
[13:23] and began to preach the word with more
[13:25] boldness than what they had before
[13:28] hey we need a refilling every now and
[13:29] then
[13:31] amen a renewing
[13:33] of our spirit
[13:34] a renewing of our soul
[13:37] amen
[13:38] another thing about enoch's walk i
[13:41] believe he realized in the divine
[13:43] presence of the almighty god
[13:47] i don't believe you can walk with
[13:48] somebody day in and day out and not
[13:50] realize they're right there
[13:53] hey
[13:54] you brothers and sisters if you work or
[13:56] whatever you do
[13:57] hey man you can't work with somebody day
[13:59] to day and not know a little bit about
[14:02] them
[14:04] hey you can you'll know their ups and
[14:06] downs
[14:07] you know what makes them tick
[14:09] what turns them on what turns them off
[14:11] if you if you're that close to them you
[14:13] know working side by side will i be the
[14:16] enoch he was that much he was that close
[14:18] so close to god that god knew him and
[14:21] and enoch knew god
[14:22] hey amen hallelujah he realized in the
[14:25] divine presence amen that you can't walk
[14:28] with someone daily without knowing that
[14:30] amen a little bit about him and he knew
[14:32] a little bit about enoch and in fact
[14:35] they shared the same interest
[14:37] amen hey man every now and then you get
[14:39] together with somebody on at the job or
[14:41] whatever and sometimes you share the
[14:43] same interests you know how it is when
[14:45] we get together with brothers and
[14:46] sisters of life precious faith you begin
[14:48] to talk about you may talk about cars
[14:50] you may talk about sports or whatever
[14:53] but it come around and say let me tell
[14:54] you what the prophet said here let me
[14:56] tell you what the bible says here and
[14:58] the bible says there's a book of
[14:59] remembrance wrote off about them who
[15:02] speak one another to one another
[15:04] about him
[15:06] oh i hope i'm in that book tonight
[15:09] hey amen so they shared the same
[15:11] interest they and also they was
[15:13] traveling in the same direction
[15:17] i want to be traveling in the same
[15:19] direction that he is
[15:21] hallelujah
[15:23] amen another thing they was going at the
[15:26] same pace
[15:30] hey they used to tell me
[15:32] i don't know how many
[15:34] used to walk to church
[15:36] amen any old timers in here that used to
[15:38] work the church by lantern light but
[15:40] they tell me they used to walk to church
[15:42] and it got dark before they got back
[15:44] home and they had to use a lantern to
[15:45] get back home by
[15:48] and they had to keep the same pace with
[15:50] the light
[15:51] because they said if they got ahead of
[15:53] the light they wrecked up
[15:56] and then they got to lagging behind the
[15:58] light they wrecked up
[16:00] i tell you what we need to keep the same
[16:02] pace with the light
[16:03] amen walk in the light as he is in the
[16:06] light because if we get ahead of the
[16:07] light we'll mess up brother paul but if
[16:10] we lag behind we'll mess up i want to
[16:12] keep the same pace
[16:15] amen
[16:17] hallelujah
[16:19] and then there was no distractions

[21:12] receive the more i can give out amen i
[21:15] want to be able to give out more
[21:18] amen i want to be like they was
[21:21] peter and john when they went to the
[21:23] house of prayer and they said silver and
[21:25] gold have a nun

[21:35] give unto thee in the name of the lord
[21:37] rise up and walk
[21:39] well they didn't have it to give out
[21:42] amen that man would have said they're
[21:44] crippled
[21:46] but because they had something to give
[21:48] out
[21:49] hey man
[21:52] that man that was sitting there lame
[21:54] all them years hey man he had to go get
[21:57] a job now
[21:59] amen he went leaping and dancing and
[22:02] praising god hallelujah i like to have a
[22:05] dvd of that see him leaping and praising
[22:08] god amen because there was something
[22:10] that happened silver and gold have we

[22:39] more
[22:41] amen
[22:42] hallelujah
[22:44] amen
[22:45] oh i believe also enoch's walk
[22:49] was one that was holy
[22:54] because god would never walk outside the
[22:55] way of holiness
[22:59] what did they do when they uh then
[23:01] priests went in there
[23:03] you know how they were dressed
[23:05] and they walked holy
[23:07] holy
[23:08] holy unto the lord
[23:11] that's how i want to walk
[23:12] holy
[23:13] holy unto the lord when that priest went
[23:16] out there a bell and a pomegranate bell
[23:18] and it ringed holy holy unto the lord
[23:22] and they tell me
[23:24] now i guess legend history declares that
[23:27] they try to rope around that ankle the
[23:29] priest
[23:30] because if he went out that if he went
[23:32] in there behind the veil behind to the
[23:35] holy of holies and his life wasn't right
[23:39] amen what happened he died
[23:42] and nobody could so they had to drag him
[23:44] out you know how you know a person's
[23:46] dead or not their bells stopped ringing
[23:49] to deny that if our bells are still
[23:50] ringing holy holy unto the lord
[23:54] i want my bells to still be ringing
[23:56] tonight
[23:58] holy holy unto the lord
[24:02] amen hallelujah i want him to be walking
[24:06] that way amen because the lord he don't
[24:08] have no company with the unjust and
[24:10] rebellious
[24:11] another thing about enoch's walk it was
[24:14] a happy one
[24:16] amen because with god who can be jury
[24:22] yea though i walk through the valley of
[24:23] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[24:25] for thou art with me thy rod and my
[24:27] staff they comfort me you know what the
[24:30] prophet said that rod and that staff was
[24:32] was hard preaching
[24:37] amen that that comforts me you can't
[24:40] preach it too hard for a believer
[24:44] you can't say it too hard for a believer
[24:48] amen
[24:50] it was a
[24:51] it could be dreary if you're walking
[24:53] with god
[24:55] amen
[24:56] i want it to be one of joy
[24:59] the bible says the joy of the lord is my
[25:02] strength how many believes that tonight
[25:04] can i come out here
[25:06] i'll try to get you got to measure with
[25:08] six feet you know
[25:11] i ain't scared of that stuff
[25:13] amen
[25:14] let's say it's here to stay covered
[25:16] hey but just cause it's here to stay and
[25:19] it comes around every season that don't
[25:21] mean i have to get it every time it
[25:22] comes around
[25:24] amen 95 bad hey man i don't have to get
[25:27] it every time it comes around
[25:29] amen but let me tell you joy and happy
[25:32] they're two different things we're
[25:34] supposed to be happy people
[25:37] but we're also supposed to be full of
[25:38] joy
[25:40] amen happy comes from the word hat or
[25:42] happen in other words in order for you
[25:44] to be happy something has to happen
[25:48] the preacher shakes your hand and you're
[25:49] happy
[25:51] they sing your favorite song and you're
[25:53] happy
[25:55] they don't stay too long church service
[25:57] is over at your time
[25:59] let somebody say brother david preach as
[26:00] long as you want we go home at nine
[26:02] o'clock
[26:03] you're happy
[26:05] amen but joy comes from a different
[26:08] source it comes from the creator himself
[26:11] and if the pastor don't shake your hand
[26:13] if they don't sing your favorite song
[26:15] you still got joy and the joy of the
[26:17] lord is my strength
[26:20] amen
[26:22] hallelujah
[26:24] amen
[26:26] oh we don't have to be dreamy tonight
[26:28] another thing about enoch's walk
[26:30] it was a safe one
[26:34] what a protection
[26:37] he had
[26:39] hey
[26:40] i've been protected before

[26:45] about our heads and prayed over our food
[26:48] especially in this iron age we're living
[26:50] in we better pray
[26:53] and god has protected us
[26:55] i believe there's been many times
[26:58] hey man here i walked here back a couple

[28:44] hedge built around me

[28:53] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[28:54] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[28:56] almighty amen
[29:00] hallelujah you know another thing about

[29:06] of lords what an honor amen to walk with
[29:10] the king of kings amen the prophet of
[29:12] god said i counted the privilege that he
[29:14] came down and let me have my picture
[29:16] taken with him
[29:18] i counted the honor that i can walk with
[29:20] him to the tonight and not just tonight
[29:23] but every night every day of the week

[29:37] canada and they had the parade that king
[29:40] was coming out and they gave every uh a
[29:42] pupil in the school a flag to wave
[29:46] and so after the parade went by and the
[29:48] king went by and you know and every it
[29:51] all and that when the classes got
[29:53] assembled back there was a little girl
[29:54] that was missing
[29:56] they wanted to find her the teacher they
[29:58] found her up against a pole just to cry
[30:00] her heart out she said honey what's

[30:23] he sees you raising your hands and
[30:25] worshiping him
[30:28] it's an honor
[30:30] amen
[30:32] it's an honor
[30:33] to serve him
[30:35] amen it's an honor to walk with him
[30:38] you know another thing about enoch's
[30:40] walk it was one that was noteworthy
[30:43] because all it said in the scripture was
[30:46] enoch walked with god
[30:49] not too many details
[30:50] just that he walked with god
[30:52] now hey what what would be better than
[30:54] that but after you're gone and they put
[30:57] that on your headstone amen paula
[30:59] fontaine walk with god amen david gadman
[31:03] walk with god what an honor that would
[31:04] be
[31:07] amen you don't need too many details
[31:09] just that you walk with god
[31:13] hallelujah who needs details
[31:16] anyway
[31:19] i you know he was a public man
[31:22] he probably worked
[31:24] but you know what
[31:26] he still walked with god
[31:28] he didn't care what was going on around
[31:30] him
[31:31] he didn't let them
[31:32] hey man
[31:34] mold
[31:36] and and and and and
[31:39] and uh
[31:41] do the standard or proclaim the standard
[31:43] that he should live by
[31:45] he
[31:46] made the standard that they should live
[31:48] by
[31:49] because he walked with god
[31:51] amen he also was a family man because
[31:53] the bible says he he begets sons and
[31:56] daughters amen so therefore amen i
[31:59] remember brother homer telling me one
[32:01] time when they first came in the message
[32:02] he said man you try to listen to change
[32:04] and you get them and they wasn't too
[32:05] good because you know when we first came
[32:07] to message 1969 and all that and some of
[32:10] the tapes wasn't too good and you know
[32:12] the noise on the background i'm glad
[32:13] they filter now we can get them on our
[32:15] phones on our ipads ipods everything
[32:17] else
[32:19] he said he used to wait to all of his
[32:21] children had was in bed and it was quiet
[32:23] after he worked all day
[32:25] and he had to get in there and he tried
[32:26] to listen to tape
[32:28] because he wouldn't hear
[32:30] what the voice of god for this day was
[32:32] saying
[32:33] hey man
[32:35] hey
[32:36] we know with everything that's going on
[32:39] hey sometimes
[32:40] we it's kind of
[32:42] it's kind of hard sometimes you know
[32:45] especially sunday morning
[32:46] oh the devil's really right there ain't
[32:48] he you know the wise lake with the
[32:50] breakfast
[32:52] you can't find your belt
[32:55] honey where's my belt at it's the same
[32:57] place you put it at the last time you
[32:59] wore it
[33:00] you know how it is
[33:02] amen you know being a family you know
[33:04] how it is you know the kids are crying
[33:07] you know and all this and walking around
[33:09] and you find out hey where's all the joy
[33:11] i had and all of a sudden you had to say
[33:12] let's be quiet
[33:15] let's pray
[33:16] and that's god to help us
[33:18] amen ask god to be with us as we're
[33:20] going to the house of god amen and said
[33:23] hey who who knows who's preaching it
[33:25] could be brother paul it could be
[33:26] somebody else but hey if god's got a
[33:28] word for us i want to be able to receive
[33:30] that word that he's got for me so i want
[33:32] to pray for the service i want to enter
[33:34] in and pull from the gift
[33:39] so even though he's a family man
[33:41] he still walked with god amen
[33:44] he lived in an evil age
[33:46] it's a day of markers and despisers
[33:50] where few loved god
[33:52] church and state were proposing a lie a
[33:54] lot alliance fashion and pleasure rule
[33:57] of the day hour an unhallowed compromise
[33:59] was the order of the day
[34:02] let me just can i just read you
[34:03] something real quick
[34:05] somebody
[34:06] and i ain't going to read it all just
[34:08] the same time
[34:10] but somebody said wrote this as writer
[34:12] describe the
[34:14] conditions
[34:15] between enoch and the flood enoch's
[34:18] noise time and he said the universal
[34:20] prevalence of lust and violence
[34:23] encouraged by longevity which put the
[34:25] thought of death far away from the
[34:27] antediluvians was the prostimate cause
[34:29] of the destruction of the ungodly world
[34:32] a confluence of various streams of evil
[34:34] and swelled into overflowing torrent of
[34:36] corruption the adulteress or atheistical
[34:39] race of cain the religious decline kind
[34:42] and final apostasy of the sethikes who
[34:45] disappointed in their hope of the
[34:47] promised deliverer abandoned their faith
[34:50] are attracted by the whirling prosperity
[34:52] and gay lives of the canaanites
[34:55] gradually cultivated their society and
[34:58] forming matrimonial alliances with them
[35:01] merged into full conformity with the
[35:03] world
[35:04] the wickedness increased with filter
[35:06] rapidly until in the 10th generation the
[35:09] iniquity of the old world came to the
[35:11] full
[35:15] the
[35:15] tenth generation
[35:17] i was telling brother homer the other
[35:19] day
[35:21] i thank god for brother paul his family
[35:23] when i first met you know raised in this
[35:25] message
[35:26] and sometimes when we're raised in it
[35:28] sometimes
[35:29] you know how it can become
[35:30] it can be just come common to us
[35:34] hey man sometimes we need to go back and
[35:37] look again
[35:38] like elijah told his servant when he
[35:40] said hey when he prayed for rain and he
[35:43] came back said i don't see nothing he
[35:44] said go look again
[35:46] every now and then we need to look again
[35:48] we need to take another look
[35:51] amen
[35:52] find out what this thing is all about
[35:55] amen but i was telling brother homer
[35:58] here it was 69 my mom and dad got
[36:00] baptized hardy arkansas
[36:03] been me
[36:05] and my brother raise up then i get
[36:07] married have a family and now my
[36:09] family's got they're having fun four
[36:11] generations
[36:13] but i'll tell you what i still believe
[36:15] god's coming again and i still believe
[36:17] god sent a prophet to this generation
[36:19] and i still believe the only way in a
[36:21] rapture is go by the way of this message
[36:24] hallelujah
[36:26] amen
[36:28] oh hallelujah the bible says amen it's
[36:32] it here let me just say where this
[36:33] writer
[36:34] finished it he took his thoughts from
[36:36] psalms 14 1
[36:38] through 3 where it says the full has
[36:40] said in his heart there is no god they
[36:41] are corrupt they have done abominable
[36:43] works there is none that doeth good the
[36:45] lord looked down from heaven upon the
[36:47] children of men to see if there was any
[36:48] that did understand and seek god
[36:51] they're all going to size they're all
[36:52] together become filthy there is none
[36:54] that doeth good no not one so this was
[36:56] the condition of the earth on the day
[36:59] and the day of enoch to noah every sin
[37:02] every evil fault thought every kind of
[37:04] balance every kind of corruption the
[37:07] aesthetic
[37:08] atheistic race of cain
[37:10] dominated missed marriages conformity by
[37:13] the world their heart was evil their
[37:15] attitudes were evil their dispositions
[37:17] were evil their designs were evil their
[37:19] walk was without was wicked and yet
[37:23] enoch walked with god
[37:25] noah walked with god both without the
[37:27] holy ghost like mean you did and if they
[37:30] did it back then we're way the world and
[37:32] it's the same today can't we walk with
[37:34] god
[37:36] hallelujah
[37:38] amen jude 14 15 says in enoch also the
[37:41] seventh from adam prophesied to thee
[37:43] said behold the lord cometh with ten
[37:45] thousands of his saints
[37:47] to execute judgment upon all and to
[37:49] convince all that are ungodly among them
[37:51] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[37:53] have ungodly committed
[37:55] and all their hard speeches which
[37:56] ungodly sinners have spoken against him
[37:59] brother brown said like this in 1954
[38:02] show us the father
[38:04] i can see him when he died
[38:06] his soul went down into the regions of
[38:08] the lost i can see a knock at the door
[38:12] of the lost somebody said who is it
[38:14] opens the doors and there the mingling
[38:16] souls they're in prison waiting for the
[38:18] day of judgment he said you already
[38:20] believed enoch you might you ought to
[38:22] have believed the prophets i'm the
[38:24] virgin born son of god that enoch said
[38:26] he'd come with ten thousands of his
[38:28] saints i'm he
[38:30] i'm the one and everything was written
[38:32] me in my father's word i have confirmed
[38:35] yet uh you're under on the cross it's
[38:37] finished close the door that's all of it

[41:30] but the one with the halo over brother
[41:31] branham's head that's the real the
[41:33] prophet god said it was the same light
[41:35] that

[53:04] i won't miss one word i'll i'll be
[53:07] faithful to you lord jesus
[53:09] lord i'll have that walk it won't be
[53:11] just on sunday and wednesday but every
[53:13] day of the week lord
[53:14] i'll walk with you lord
[53:17] amen i'll fill my way every day with
[53:19] love as i walk with that heavenly
[53:22] i'll walk with you
[53:25] let me can i just read you one more i
[53:28] thought this was real good
[53:29] rebrands
[53:31] says this and then
[53:41] you know
[53:43] i thought that's real good
[53:45] what he said
[53:55] 1956 father the hour has come listen
[53:59] what he says
[54:00] he said in jehoshaphat
[54:04] his son
[54:05] rising up to take his place
[54:08] had a good background to look upon
[54:10] to see
[54:11] that one now listen what he says to see
[54:13] that when a man
[54:15] will walk for god
[54:17] and walk with god
[54:19] god will walk with that man
[54:22] i like that
[54:23] when a man will
[54:25] walk
[54:27] for god and with god
[54:29] god walk with that man
[54:31] and he goes on to say listen what he
[54:33] goes on to say he said god will walk but
[54:34] when that same individual
[54:37] turns his back from god
[54:39] then god just lets him shift for himself
[54:43] and we find out it's very sad thing when
[54:45] we have to shift for ourself
[54:50] that's amazing so when a man will walk
[54:53] for god and with god
[54:55] god will walk with that man
[54:57] but when that same individual turns his
[55:00] back
[55:01] and don't walk with god no more
[55:03] he lets that man shift for himself and
[55:06] said it's a hard thing for somebody to
[55:07] shift for themselves
[55:10] so my prayer tonight
[55:12] as we bow our heads
[55:14] is god don't let me never forsake you
[55:17] let me walk for you
[55:19] and with you
[55:21] because i have a promise by the prophet
[55:22] of god that he said when a man walks for
[55:25] god and with god
[55:28] god will walk with that man
[55:30] when that same individual turns his back
[55:32] and don't walk with god no more god just
[55:34] lets him shift for himself
[55:36] i don't want to shift for myself
[55:38] i want her tonight with our heads about
[55:40] our eyes closed right before we turn it
[55:41] back
[55:43] if you're here tonight and you say god
[55:45] help me
[55:46] i want to walk with you
[55:48] just like enoch
[55:50] i don't have that kind of walk that he
[55:51] had
[55:52] a safe one
[55:54] one of protection a holy one
[55:57] one that's with great complication
[55:59] i want to walk for you lord and i want
[56:02] to walk with you because you promised
[56:04] lord by your prophet that you said if a
[56:07] man will walk with me like that i'll
[56:08] walk with that man
[56:10] but if he don't and turns his back then
[56:12] he'll have to shift for himself i don't
[56:15] want to have to shift for myself
[56:17] i'm in enough trouble or getting enough
[56:20] trouble just trying to walk with him
[56:22] and walk for him
[56:24] let alone trying to shift it for myself
[56:28] amen god bless that hand that hand
[56:30] my hands up let's just buy our heads
[56:33] heavenly father
[56:35] lord we love you tonight
[56:38] we appreciate you so much lord jesus
[56:40] [Music]

[56:43] done for us lord
[56:46] and lord i just want to i want to walk
[56:49] for you lord
[56:50] and i want to walk with you lord
[56:53] may my walk be like enoch
[56:56] one that's pleasing to you lord jesus
[56:59] lord
[57:00] everywhere i go when i'm driving down
[57:02] the highway
[57:04] when i'm in the grocery store if i'm
[57:06] working on a job
[57:07] when i'm out ministering somewhere lord
[57:10] let my life be pleasing to you lord
[57:12] jesus
