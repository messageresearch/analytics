and Hallelujah the Lord got that on yeah okay we're good thank you musicians amen if we want to open our Bibles to First Peter chapter 3 verses 8- 15 it's thankful to be in the house of the Lord thankful for the grace and mercy the Lord has given us so it says and finally be ye all one mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil evil for evil or railing for railing but contris blessing knowing that ye are there unto called that ye should inherit a blessing forther he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him asue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their Terror neither be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear let's pray Lord we just ask that you add the blessing to your word Lord Lord I pray that you just open our hearts Lord let us hear from you Lord Jesus Lord let them pull on this gift Lord that you've given me Lord let me step out of the way Lord so I can hear from you Lord Jesus we thank you for that Lord in Jesus name we pray amen you have your seats so I'm really terrible with titles and I don't like titles because I don't want to box up this and make it into something that God didn't want it to be but if I had a title it would be it's time to be out of control so I'm going to read this in the Amplified again and he says finally all of you be like-minded this is Peter speaking United in in spirit sympathetic brotherly kind-hearted courteous and compassionate towards each other as members of one household and humble in spirit being like-minded with your brothers being humble in spirit and never return evil for evil or an insult for an insult avoid scolding berading and any kind of abuse but on the contrary give a blessing anyone that hurts you or abuses you or insults you return them with a blessing pray for one other's well-being contentment and protection for you have been called for this very purpose that you might inherit a blessing from God that brings well-being happiness and protection praying for others is extremely important verse 10 say for the one who wants to enjoy life and see good days good whether it's apparent or not good is relative in a lot of ways we like to think of good in a certain way but it doesn't mean that's what God wants so whether it's apparent or not and you want to enjoy life keep your tongue free from Evil and your lips from speaking Gile from treachery and deceit he must turn away from the wickedness and do what is right he must search for peace with God with s and with others and pursue it eagerly actively not merely Desiring it pursuing peace with God and in yourself and peace with others Peter's got a lot of good things to say for eyes of the Lord are looking favorably upon the righteous the upright and his ears are attentively attentive to their prayers eager to answer but the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil Lord will hear our prayers when we don't practice evil now who is there to hurt you if you become enthusiastic for what is good but even if you should suffer for sake of righteousness thou it is though it is not certain that you will you will still you are still blessed happy to be admired and favored by God do not be afraid of their intimidating thoughts nor be troubled or dis disturbed by their opposition with God what do we have to fear we get so afraid and everything is about fear today everything we come up against every news article everything you hear is Fear With God what do we have to fear but in your heart set Christ apart as holy acknowledging him giving him first place in your lives as lord always be ready to give a logic iCal defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope and confidence Assurance elected by faith that is within you yet do it with gentleness and respect you should know why you believe what you believe and we shouldn't be fighting people of what we believe we should be doing with gentleness and respect so I want to paint a picture of Peter for a minute so don't get ahead of me just stick with me for a minute so Peter has a lot of Godly advice a lot of good good thing to show us here in these scriptures and Peter is very bold and fearless and if we look in the book of Acts we'll see a lot of this so if you want to go to you don't have to but acts 2:14 we're going to read quite a few here but if you want to pull that up but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be with uh be this known unto you and hearken to my words 15 for these are not drunken as you suppose see it is but the third hour of the day but this is what that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit onto All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in Earth beneath bold and fire blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord shall be saved it doesn't matter who it is the Lord just has a call on his name they shall be saved ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man above approved of God among you by Miracles wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know so they know all the Wonders and the signs that Jesus done they've watched it him being delivered by the determinate counsel and for knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain so Peter starts to get really serious to them right now and whom God had raised up and having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it they tried to kill him it didn't work for David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved keep going therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope I'm going to 38 because thou Wist not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou Hast made known to me the ways of life Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy counter countenance men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and this Seer is with us until this day therefore be a prophet and being a prophet prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would rise up Christ to sit on his throne he is seeing this before spake he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did he see corruption this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear for David has not ascended into the heavens but he but he saith himself the Lord say unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy foot stol therefore let all the house of Israel knowing assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so Peter is really bold he calls all these guys out on everything they've ever done he literally tells them that they know what Jesus did they know the Miracles and then they crucified him they're the ones that killed Jesus Peter is not standing in front of two or three people when he does this there's 3,000 people that receive the Holy Ghost when this happens so Peter boldly goes out and speaks in front of all these people calls them all out on every terrible thing that they've committed on Jesus it wasn't very easy for him to do that this is a giant mob if you can imagine walking out to the to a giant m mob in doing that to walk out into somebody and tell them terrible things that they've done that you've seen that they do and you're going to call them out on every last bit of it and there's a couple of you and thousands of them but the Lord sent you to say all of the stuff that they've done and sent you to give this message the boldness it would take to do that how much grit you would have to have to stand before all those people and do that at any given time they can just beat you up they can rob you they can kill you they can do whatever they want to do there's nothing you're going to be able to do to thousands of people but Peter stood out there and did this because the Lord called him to do it he did it with boldness and 3,000 people receive the Holy Ghost so Acts 3 1-9 says now Peter John went up together in the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked alms so this beggar man is just sitting there and he asked Peter and John for something and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John said look unto us look on us and he gave heed on them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said silver and gold have Have I None So if you can imagine being this dude sitting here that needs money and Peter says look onto me and gets real serious with you and you think sweet this is going to work out today and then the guy says Silver and Gold Have I None well that didn't go so well didn't see that one coming and he says but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaped up stood and walked and entered in with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God so Peter again I mean this is bold so if you imagine you're at the Walmarts you're walking around and the Lord sends you to one person a beggar a panhandler whatever you call them and send you down to that person to tell them they're going to be healed this could go really bad for you you could come up with a thousand reasons of why you don't want to do this you could talk yourself out of it very easily to think what if this isn't right what if I'm doing it wrong what if this isn't what I'm supposed to say what if this is a wrong guy people are going to see me if this doesn't work this is embarrassing what if God isn't going to do it right now what if he's going to do it later there's a thousand things you could say but Peter walked right up to him with boldness and knew what he had to do and he did it and the man walked the man was healed in jesus' name he was healed you can think of the boldness it would take to do that how hard it would be for you to walk up to a random stranger and say that to them with such confidence that you know this is going to happen there's there's no getting around it verse 10 and they knew that it was he which sat in alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they filled with wonder and amaz and they were filled with wonder and amazement that which had happened to him and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John he healed held Peter and John all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's greatly wondering and when Peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of Israel ye men of Israel why Marvel ye at this and why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power and Holiness we had made this man walk there marveling at what Peter did and Peter's telling them it has nothing to do with me I didn't do this Jesus did this I didn't do this the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob and the god of the fathers ha glorified his son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when ye when he was determined to let him go they were going to let him go but you guys are the one that denied it but ye denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murderer be granted unto you the man that healed this man is the man you killed he's the man you gave up for a murderer so Peter Ken just starts calling everyone out he's not worried about it and killed the Prince of Life whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we Are Witnesses you've killed the Prince of death the you killed the Prince of Life and his name through faith in his name hath made his man man this man strong whom ye see and know ye the faith ye the faith yeah the faith which is by him hath given him his perfect soundness in presence of you all and now Brethren i w that thou ignorance you did this and did also your rulers in ignorance you killed Jesus so Peter starts to bring it back around but those things which God before had showed by the mouth of All His prophets that Christ should suffer he has so fulfilled repent ye therefore and be converted and your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you he's given them a way out they know that you killed the Prince of Life but this is your way out repent onto the man that you killed and you will be forgiven so in Acts 3:2 24- 26 this in the Amplified indeed all prophets who have spoken from Samuel and those who came after him also announced these days so they knew it was coming you are the sons descendants of the prophets and HS of the Covenant which God made with your father saying to Abraham in your seed descendants all the families of the Earth shall be blessed it was for you first of all that God raised up his servant and son Jesus and sent him to bless you by turning everyone of you from your wicked ways so Peter's telling them they did this for you you are the first one that this was that Jesus was raised up for and then you killed him so Peter continues to call them out with this boldness Peter has this such boldness he can't be stopped he's just going to keep going along the lines of what God told him to do it's just absolute fear fear fearlessness to go through and listen to the Lord like Peter has in Acts 4 it says in verse one and as they spake unto people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus resurrection from dead from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in hold onto the next day for it was now even tide so now Peter's called him out and it's not working out the same way he's getting arrested how be it many of them which heard the word believe word believed and the number of men was about 5,000 and it came to pass on the marrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and ananus and the high priests sephus and John and Alexander Caiaphas sorry and John and Alexander And as many as were of the kind Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and they then and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the important impotent Man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him do this man stand here before you whole as Peter just continues he just throws a crucifixion in there every time this is a stone which was said not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved so in Acts 4 do in verse 18- 21 and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor to teach in the name of Jesus so as they're trying to get Peter to stop talking about this trying to get Peter and John to stop talking about this but Peter and John answered them and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard we ain't stopping we're going to keep going so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all the men glorified God for that which was done there was nothing they could do when the crowd agreed with Peter so Peter's boldness continues throughout the Book of Acts and he continues to be arrested and beaten for preaching the gospel and it's amazing what Peter does for the kingdom of God right and what he endures while doing it so but we know Peter's story and as you look at at it in all of these scriptures Peter is very bold he's very Fearless nothing can stop him he's going to do what the Lord has him to do nothing's going to stand in his way so if you stick with just this part of Peter and you don't see the whole story it makes it a whole lot easier to follow Peter he's going to be the guy that's going to show up he's going to be the guy that's going to help you through the hardest times he's going to be the guy that's right there in the fire with you with a smile on his face with this boldness he's going to just continue to show up for you he's going to be your hero he's going to be your night and shining armor he's going to be the guy with the answers to every question because as you keep in these scriptures he's done everything right he's just going to keep going he can't fail it looks like he just can't fail there's nothing he can do wrong he's so in tune with God it' blow your socks clean off if you had two pair of socks It Blow both pairs off it's how in tune it looks like he's in with God right now now but we don't have all the information and nowadays humans love information we have to have so much of it we have to have every single side we Google everything it's right at our fingertips it takes two seconds to figure out anything you could ever want so we can't handle not having the information I have to have the information to make an informed decision brother I have to have this stuff to make sure I'm doing everything right I have to know what's going on and sometimes you do sometimes you don't sometimes more information is helpful but what are you going to do if you don't have all the information are you going to keep moving or are you going to freeze up and stay right there and keep trying to find more information if the Lord's trying to get you to do something what are you going to do you only have partial what he wants you to do but you know part of it are you going to do that part or you just going to sit there and do nothing with it so and as I said in some in some instances more information is helpful and I know that so as a mechanic I have to figure out why things broke and it's helpful if you tell me what you did but it's programmed in humans that when you break something and a mechanic shows up tell them nothing because then they won't know it's you that broke it but you're sitting in the seat and it's broken so it was you that's it it's that easy you're the one that broke it but they will deny till they die they will never never tell you what's going on I went to a combine one time and it broke a belt so I didn't think anything of it I just started doing it and started getting the belt out of it because the belts wrap up and everything and so I start cutting the belt out of it getting everything apart and talking to the guy say you know what happened he's like I don't know I know it's a weirdest thing never broke this belt before it just broke have no idea what happened ain't got a clue like okay I didn't think anything of it so I got everything apart and I was trying to move the combine the internals of the combine by hand and it wouldn't move I'm a big boy and it does take a lot but I can usually get in budge and it would not move so couldn't figure it out like guess is weird and again I didn't pay attention because I was just focused on this one key area of what I was doing and I kept asking them did something happen nothing happened I have no idea it's the weirdest thing must be a faulty belt no idea what happened it's weird okay so I get the belt back on I'm like man we need to like look through this thing and figure out something's stuck in it so I get the belt on it can't get a move walk around the front of the combine there is an entire tree sticking out of the front of the combine it's that big around and this the whole bushy leaves part is sticking out of the front of the combine and I said do you think that has anything to do with a tree and he was as surprised as I was when we seen the tree and he looked at it and thought where did that come from the forest is where that came from it can't go in the combine that's why the belt broke so he acted like no idea it's the weirdest thing ever no idea where I picked up a tree at I don't know how you missed that tree so I yanked the tree out with my truck and I said we got to fire this thing up but there's still parts of the tree and in the combine I said so if it starts making a bunch of noises just shut the machine down we had to dig it out and he's an older guy and older guys are really stuck in their ways so he was like I got it I said don't idle the machine up whatever you do don't rev the machine up he says yep so he turns it on and it just starts hammering hammering hammering I'm waving stop and he looks down at me and smiles and revs up as fast as it'll go and it just starts destroying this tree inside the machine throws out chunks a tree everywhere and so I ran around I said hey I told you to stop why don't you stop like I asked you to stop that's going to tear the machine all up and he said this isn't the first time I ran a tree through this machine I knew it' chew it up so he knew the entire time that he had a tree stuck in that machine he just didn't want to tell me that information he just let me figure it out on my own so another story my grandparents my grandpa really doesn't like to tell both my grandpas never really like to tell you the whole story they'll tell you half of what you need to know so I was 11year old chubby me riding my bike over my grandpa's house we had a bill hay so my grandpa had this thing where he'd bail all the hay and lay it in the field so there's little round bails everywhere and he puts me on the tractor and he's riding on the side of it and he said put it in low gear and jump off the tractor and run around and throw all the bails up on the wagon and when you get to the end steer it around so you don't hit the woods I'm like okay that sounds kind of cool but what happens if I fall off and get ran over by the tractor and he looks at me very serious and says don't okay so hypothetically let's say there's an emergency what do you want me to do and he said don't have an emergency okay so I learned not to get run over by a tractor really fast just don't my other grandpa who also didn't like to tell me everything I needed didn't know needed me to help him drive somebody when I was 13 years old so we start driving cross country and he says get up here get in the seat and he airs up my seat because I'm too short and it looks like a little kid's driving somebody because little kid's driving somebody that's why it look like that so he said just steer it keep it between the lines don't pass nobody don't do anything and I said well I can't really reach the foot pedals because my air the seat so aired up so high and he said that's what cruise control is for and he turned turn the cruise control on so I'm like Grandpa hypothetically let's say there's an accident and I need to stop and he said don't okay so let's say there's an accident that I can't prevent what do I do and he said wake me up before you hit anybody okay that's good I got it don't hit anybody wake you up really fast so we continue on we get to where we're going and we have these they're like tasers for cows to get them in the trailer so there's a 1200lb bull up on the top side of the trailer and this little cubby and you're in a stall as wide as those chairs and so he gives me his hot shot and he says go up there and get that bull and I said what happens if he comes at me and he said he'll kill you okay so how do I prevent the action where he hits me and kills me and he said don't get run over okay I feel like the information there there is lacking of how to not get ran over cuz I don't really want to get ran over but that's all I got and the reason I had to ride with him at this time was because he got run over by a bull the week before so more information this sometimes very very helpful I get that I never got ran over by a bull though I learned really fast don't do that I don't know how I learned it I just came up with something so sometimes you do need more information this very helpful in certain situations but when does too much information hurt us right now the way you look at Peter you're willing to follow Peter right now you can see Peter as doing nothing wrong he's very bold very Fearless he's a man of God he's proven it you can't deny it by his actions but if you go back a book and look at what happens and see The Human Side of Peter then what will you do so in John 13: 34-38 a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love as I have loved you that ye also love one another but this shall all men know that ye are disciples if ye have love one to another Simon Peter said unto him Lord whether goest thou Jesus answered him whether I go thou C come follow me can can not follow me now but Thou shalt follow me afterwards Peter said unto him Lord why can I follow you these these now follow thee now I will lay down my life for thee for thy sake Peter's telling him I'll kill myself for you I'll do whatever it takes I need to follow you no matter what Jesus answered him will thou lay down thy life for my sake will you actually do it say verily verily I say un to thee the shall not Crow till thou has denied me Thrice so as you see the Bold Peter now he's going to deny Jesus there's no way he denies Jesus he loves Jesus so much he's willing to do whatever it takes he's willing to lay his die life down for Jesus do anything for Jesus and Jesus says before the crows you'll deny me three times is this the same Peter that was arrested and beaten and imprisoned for preaching the Gospel of Jesus there's no way that Peter that Peter would deny Jesus but in John 18 10-12 veres 10-12 then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and smokee the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear the servant's name was malus then said Jesus unto Peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father ha given me shall I not drink it then the band then the band in the cap aptain and officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him so Jesus is saying what are you doing this is the plan this is my plan all along and now you're standing in the way of it so why does Peter start standing in the way of God Peter's getting nervous Peter's cutting off people's ears he's starting to freak out because he's losing control of these situations Peter has a plan in his head of how this is supposed to go and Jesus dying this is not how he wants it to go Peter's with Jesus he's all about it but once Jesus is gone what does Peter have that's how Peter sees it he's losing control of the situation so now this bold Peter now you're seeing where he came from somebody that you would think would never deny Christ somebody who stands in front of thousands of people and boldly proclaims that you killed Jesus and holds it against all these people for them to repent of their sins so they can be be saved this same Peter just verses later in John 18: 15- 27 and Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with Jesus into the Palace of the high priest that was yeah John 18: 15- 27 but Peter stood at the door without then then went out that other disciple which was unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in Peter then saith the damsel that kept the door onto Peter art not thou also one of the men's disciples he saith I'm not not me and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was gold cold and they warmed themselves and Peter stood with them and warmed himself and the high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples then the high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples and of and Jesus answered him of his Doctrine and Jesus answered him and spake openly to the world I ever taught in the synagogues and in the temple with the Jews always Resort and in secret have I said nothing why ask thou me ask them which heard me what I have said unto them behold they know what I said and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so Jesus answered him if I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if but if well why Smit us thou me then annus had sent him bound unto sephus kyus the high priest and Simon Peter stood war and warmed himself they said therefore unto our th art not thou also one of the disciples he denied and said I am not one of the Servants of the high priest being his Kinsman whose ear Peter cut off sayith did not I see thee in the garden with him so I seen you chop this dude's ear off in the garden are you sure that wasn't you no was not me Peter denied again and immediately the cop crew Crow so is this the same Peter this is the same bold Peter that wouldn't deny Jesus so in Luke it says that Jesus looked at Peter after he denied him the last time Jesus saw him and Peter knew what he had just done Peter knew that he went from flying high with Jesus to all of a sudden denying everything that he said that he was for all this boldness everything that you see him later on everything is gone he denies Jesus while Jesus is looking at him so is this the same Peter so you can say well he doesn't have the same he doesn't have the Holy Ghost yet so okay that's fair enough acts 10 verses 12- 15 wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and the creeping things and Falls of the air and there came a voice to him rise Peter kill and eat but Peter said not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time what God hath cleansed that call not thou common and this was done Thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven so watch Peter as he right away he has something to say right away he says no way not doing it I've never never eaten anything unclean instead of going on with What the Lord Has to tell him he instantly says nope I've never eaten unclean and the Lord says don't call this unclean so Peter instantly has commentary and then in verse 25 and as Peter was coming in cornelus met him and fell at his feet and worshiped him but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come come together and he said unto them ye know how that is that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come onto one of another Nation but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean therefore came I unto you without gain saying as soon as I was sent for I asked therefore what intent ye have sent for me and cornelus said four days ago I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright clothing and said Cornelius thy prayers is heard and thy alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God send therefore to japa and call Heather Simon the surname is Peter he is lodged in the house of one Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou Hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that are common thee of God commanded thee of God and Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons so it's when God starts to bring everything to the Gentiles he's using Peter to do it Peter Peter obeys and goes to corus's house which he knows is going to get him in trouble and Peter gets a revelation right there in verse 34 he realizes this is for everyone this isn't just for a certain group of people Jesus wants us to go to everyone so in verse 35 says but in every nation he that fearth him and worketh righteous is accepted with him the word which God sent on the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is the Lord of all so Peter has this Revelation that the message of Jesus is for everyone like I said it's not hidden away for special person that's not hidden way just for the Jews the Lord opens this door up to everyone and he uses Peter to do it and I do like Cornelius here just as a side note this Cornelius is never mentioned again it's brought through Cornelius and he's never mentioned again in the Bible but he's used so profoundly to get everything started so we can never underestimate what God is doing so Peter boldly does all this Peter's he he goes to this house he does everything he's not supposed to do he's going to get himself in trouble but he does it because he realizes the Lord does not respect your persons but then in Galatians 2 but when Peter was come to Enoch Galatians 2:1 but when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed so Paul is calling Peter out for before that certain came that certain came from James he did eat with g Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other Jews disassembled likewise with him in so much that Barnabas also was carried away with a dis dissimulation but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all if thou being a Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews Why compell Us thou Gentiles to live as do the Jews so Paul's calling Peter out just like Peter called out everyone else later on in life Peter gets called out because he boldly comes says he's calling people out he's going to tell them that they're the ones that crucified Christ they're the ones that did all these bad things he's going to go to Cornelius and start to spread the message of Jesus to all the Gentiles but then the second pressure gets put on Peter he melts and he folds in front of all these people CU he's afraid because Peter starts to lose control and he's afraid of what can happen he loses focus on what he's supposed to be doing so this is the same Peter this is the same Peter that walked with Jesus and watched all the Miracles and then denied Jesus this is the same Peter that learned from that mistake and boldly proclaimed Jesus and was beaten for it and imprisoned for it and then even in with the Holy Ghost full of the Holy Ghost once he put pressure on him he melted and he fell apart and denied it and he even started to bring other people along with him in these false things and Paul had to come and straighten him out and that's Peter so that's a full picture of Peter so when my computer used to work better but my wife kind of broke it so so I just want to throw that part in there in John 21: 15-19 so when they had Deni dying Jesus said unto Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yay Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto him feed my Lambs verse 16 and he saith unto him again the second time Simon Peter son of Jonas lovest thou me he he saith unto him y Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep and he saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he had said unto him third time lovest thou me and he said unto him Lord thou knowest I love thee all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep so verily verily he says verily verily I say thee when thou was young thou Gest thyself and walst wherever thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall G thee and carry thee wherever thou wouldest not verse 19 this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me so watch what what Peter says in the very next verse then Peter turned about seeing the disciple who Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee Peter seeing him say to Jesus Lord what shall this man do Jesus saith unto him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me so Peter instantly it's like what about that guy I know what you just said I was supposed to do but what about that guy and Jesus says don't worry about it and the disciples come to an instant conclusion as well in verse 23 then when this saying abroad among the Brethren that the disciples should not die yet Jesus said unto him he shall not die but if I will he T till I come what is that to thee so they instantly think okay this guy's never going to die that's what he's come up with theyve completely missed Jesus's point so we've read a lot of scriptures about Peter we've learned about Peter's life so what is the point the point is Peter's life is a mess and Peter keeps trying to control different parts of his life because he doesn't like the mess he's trying to do whatever he can to regain some kinde of control in his mess of a life and our lives are the same way our lives are a mess and we continually try to just grab have control of whatever we can grasp in our lives or even in someone else's life to try to control a little bit of it because we think we can do better but the problem is we can't be distracted by the mess we can't try to control the mess we have to let go of the control because Jesus as he told Peter you're going to have no control you're going to have no control over this God has it handled God knows every step God knows every corner God created the corners he's not worried about it we're the ones that are worried about it so why wouldn't he just tell Peter right off how he's going to die why wouldn't he just tell Peter the whole story and let him know what's about to come instead of talking to him in Parables and talking around it so if you can imagine humans can't handle it if humans knew what was going to happen we could do better we always like to think we can do better whether we want to admit that or not humans love to think that we can do better than God like Lord if you just tell me your plan I've got this watch what I can do no we'll make a mess of it so if he told Peter Peter buckle up it's going to be a rough road you're going to be arrested you're going to be beaten you're going to be imprisoned you're going to be chased out of places you're going to lose everything you have you're going to be beaten again you're going to be imprisoned again you're going to lose everything you have again you're going to lose all of your friends you're going to be called out in front of everyone because you've denied God you're going to be called out in front of everyone because you've gotten away from what you're supposed to be teaching and you started leading people astray and you're going to be embarrassed in front of everyone because you're going to be called out because of the things that you've done so and God will continue with them and you will continue to make mistakes until the very end you continue to do these things you continue to get things wrong Peter in your life and in the very end of your life people will force you to go to places you don't want to go and at the very end you'll be brutally executed for living This Life of Christ if he told Peter that Peter run in the other direction anybody would run in the other direction or we would try to take control of that situation and think that we know things are coming and we can do better like God didn't see what was coming God already knew what was coming he's well aware of it he created the situation that is coming for you we could never do it better than God but we think we can we think we can do it better with other people we think we can do it better with ourselves and we just keep trying to do it so why would we want to keep trying to control our situation we want to try to maintain some kind of what we think is control we want to at some point have a say in something that we do we want at some point to say well that was my good idea but we have no control over this the faster we lose the control the faster God can come in and help us we want God to help us but we don't want God to help us in his way we want to have the control and say well this is how it probably should go we should do this this and this we want to look like our Western culture has told us that it should be we shouldn't have a mess we shouldn't have anything going on we should everything together if you got a problem deal with it in in private don't let anybody see it make it look nice don't fall apart everything is great everything's fine we're not going to talk about it even though the Bible could tells us to confess thought faults one to another we ain't doing that we ain't doing anything like that we're going to let the devil have our heads and continue to stay right inside that and we're not going to move because we continue to tell ourselves we've got this handled we've got it under control we have nothing under control we like to sing songs like can you bring up I think it's called refiner is that the song purified can you bring that lyrics up so we like to sing these songs but then I don't know that we really think about what it says so it says I want to be Tried by fire purified so Kenny and Gideon come sing this and play will you real quick so that way you get the full effect of what the song does it says I want to be Tried by fire purified take whatever you desire Lord here's my life I want to be Tried by fire and purified these guys do a lot better job [Music] I to [Music] be so we want to be by fire we want to be purified and it sounds so perfect you can keep singing the whole song [Music] yeah whatever it takes take me there you offer your life up to God I'll be a Living [Music] Sacrifice I want to be consumed consum by the fire I want to be Tri by fire purified you take whatever you desire Lord's my so you thank you guys so you say you want to be Tried by fire purified take whatever whatever it takes my life is a Living Sacrifice and your fire the refiner but the second the fire starts we don't want to do it anymore we're good we don't want to be purified we don't want the refiner we're good we don't need any of that because we don't like the way that it looks it sounds amazing in that song that's song sounds good Gideon sings it well Kenny plays it well it sounds really good and you just you can't help but worship it Lord I want to be refined I want to be Tried by fire fire hurts really bad really bad and once the fire starts we want nothing to do with it and if the fire starts for somebody else we want to think their life is falling apart everything's coming to Pieces Devil's attacking them that might be the Lord It's the Lord that allows that to happen but we want blame the devil for it every time but we want to be refined we just want to blame the devil for it instead of giving God the credit he's trying to change you into something that he needs you to be we don't like it that way at all though we want to blame it on the bad guy because there's bad people no it's the Lord trying to get you into position that he need you to be the refining fire hurts but it's worth it when you get to that point do have that quote from he cares do you care so in 63 brother R says and I hope that each of you get that especially you people that is to be paid for that's so uncomfortable this morning with many troubles that doctors cannot touch and we believe that doctors help people I believe that God heals by medicine God heals by surgery God heals by understanding God heals by love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them see God heals by love God heals by prayer God heals by Miracles God heals by his word God heals whatever Source it is God heals by it it's God that's healing for he said I am the Lord that Health all these diseases so all of it should work together and men in different Ministries should work together for that see so God does the healing God is the one that does the Miracles whatever Source the person gets help from it's God's the one that's doing the healing a little bit of love goes a long way we want to perform all these Grand things and do these big marvelous acts for people and show up for people and give them money and do anything we can to help them when we're always trying to talk them into something trying to get them to do this this is going to help that's going to help have you ever tried to love them a little bit have you ever tried to compliment somebody at all we we want to love we want to move Heaven and Earth and you can't tell anybody they look nice because you're worried that they might think think something of you you can't encourage anybody with just a little thing but we want to move Heaven and Earth we're not even close to moving Heaven and Earth we can't love each other just a little bit just a little bit of love all the ministry should work together for this right we should all be working for this a little bit of love it's love that does the work we don't do this work God does the work God's the one that does the healing we can't fix anybody we'd like to think that we can but there's no one we can fix we can't fix ourselves we can't do anything we can't just love people right where they are we have to get people into a lovable spot we have to get ourselves into a lovable spot and we don't like to say that we should love ourselves because the world's perverted that the world's perverted that for a reason because you have to be comfortable with who you are if you don't possess what you other people need you can't give it to them you don't have it if you don't have the peace and you don't have the love nothing's going to happen if you don't get to where you want them to be nothing's going to happen you have nothing to give them you're going to show up and he's going to say Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you I don't know who you are and you're not going to like what happens in that situation because you have no love to give because you don't have it for yourself so as the world continually perverts this love it's doing it on purpose so you don't realize that love is everything without it nothing else matters nothing you can't earn anything you can't fix people you can't earn people's to fix their situations you can't do anything with that so I'm going to pick on Gideon you can pick on me next time so you're going to walk the Walk of Life just walk from there to there just keep walking back and forth for me so Gideon's walking his Walk of Life and he's walking along and he falls off you don't have to fall just keep walking so he's walking he's doing fine and his life starts to fall apart he he loses his job he's getting really depressed he doesn't know what to do and now he's starting to get into things that he shouldn't get into so you want to help him so badly and I want to keep talking to him because I've done the drugs I've done the drinking I've done the bad things that you can do so I want to tell him man it's time to stop you've got to stop all this stuff you can't keep walking this life you cannot do this this is what I did this is how it worked for me you need to stop I can help you if you just stop I can help you you got to do this this and this this is a 12-step program that worked for me if you would just do this it would stop I know exactly how to help you if you would stop right now I can show you everything I know to to help you get off this track your life is falling apart you're in shambles I know you're extremely depressed I know you want to take your life if you would just listen to me I could help you but you won't stop and he's going to continue to walk this path because you want to help them in your control in your way because you don't like the mess of his life because you don't like the way that it looks and he's going to keep walking because he's not going to listen to you he's going to be stuck in what he's doing and you go through all these things and you think that's exactly what he's going through I can help him but I talk to him and nothing happens he just keeps walking God put you in that situation so you can pray for that person so God can show up for that person so you know specific ways to pray pray that's why never underestimate your prayer you are put in that situation for a specific reason that's why you know what you know so you can pray for that person specifically you know exactly what they're going through with depression with the things that they can struggle with so finally God can show them God can show up and say it's time to stop this is where it stops because God shows him this is where it stops his life is a wreck you sit down thank you buddy his life is a wreck and we tried so hard hard to get him to stop doing it and he would stop doing it because you are not in control you are not in control of your life you're not in control of other people's lives God is in control of those lives he set you in those situations that you're trying to fix so much so you can pray for those situations and if God tells you to move then move but you ignore the moves because they're not big enough they don't look right this isn't going to do anything anything it is going to do something God is telling you to move for a reason he needs you in that situation he needs you to pray your whole entire life do you understand that's how much God loves you if somebody has ever helped you that has trials they've gone through the horrible depression they've gone through their life was abusive everything that they've gone through if that person has helped you God did that to that person to help you in the future that's how much God loves you because is everything he was willing to put that person through that and he knew he was going to rescue both of you and he knew that person was going to understand and he did it on purpose so he could get you help later on for what you were going to put yourself through God didn't tell you to walk that path you wanted to walk that path these people want to walk these paths but we have no control over that and as humans we hate that we want to have that control but it's time to be out of that that control to lose that control to pray for them to actually enter in for them to actually love them the way that you're supposed to love them not try to fix their mess and cover everything up I'm not talking about making things okay people do stupid things and they know they're stupid they already know that they're very well aware of it trust me they just need you to love them right where they are they don't need you to try to get them to a lovable spot they don't need you to try to do a 12-step program to get them in the church to get them to do that they need you to pray for them specifically where they are because you know about it if you know about the depression you know about the Temptations you know about the lust you know about these different things and you see this happening that happened in your life so you could pray specifically for that person so you could actually help them not so you could try to take control of the situation we don't like our flaws we really don't like our flaws but I think I stole this from Brother Alex from last week in your flaws and your dis the way you disqualify yourself in your flaws is exactly what God qualifies you with that is what makes you qualified to do that job right when you think you cannot do anything great because you can't there's nothing that you can do that's perfect if you think I don't have what it takes I'm not the right man perfect because you're not the right man and you don't have what it takes but God does God is the same yesterday today and forever it has never changed he's always showed up for everyone he showed up for the woman at the well he showed up for the adulterous woman he showed up for the man on the cross who deserved nothing I always go back to the man on the cross because I can't get over that fact the man deserved nothing and then gets into heaven with God he deserved absolutely nothing he did nothing right everything was wrong so you can say all you care about is love you're hippie you're this that and the other and that world tries to pervert that on purpose so if you bring up 1 Corinthians 13 in musicians you can come I think I'm about done so 1 Corinthians 13 to show that love is everything though I speak with tongues and Men of and Men of angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass and of a tingling symbols and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all the knowledge and through know I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing go back to that one so you can know all the Mysteries you can understand everything that people need you can have all the faith in the world so that you can move mountains you can have the right thing to say you can do everything exactly right you can preach perfectly you can minister to anybody you walk up to you can speak in tongues you can move mountains you can heal people you can do everything perfectly right because you have the gift of Prophecy you understand all the mysteries of life you can tell people what's coming you can see into their lives if you do it without love you're nothing it says nothing it doesn't say that you're a piece of wood it doesn't say that you're drywall it doesn't say that you're dirt you're nothing you don't exist to God because you did it without love you moved Heaven and Earth for somebody but you didn't love them you did that for you so you could have a little bit of control in that sit situation so you cannot let go of that Pride where God's going to get the glory for that you did it for you you're nothing you cease to exist so you can walk up to God and he can say I never knew you you did all these Grand things I never knew you did it all without love love is everything if we cannot love nothing else happens if you love you're of God without love nothing matters you can move Heaven and Earth and nothing matters we have to love one another with everything we have we have to understand what that means not to try to get somebody into a lovable spot but love them right where they are love them enough to let them walk that path it looks like a mess and it is a mess that's why it looks like that but it's okay that's God's mess he's doing something with that don't go in there and try to sweep everything up and fix everything yourself pray for that situation God will show up for those people he's done it in my life he's done it in so many people's lives you can sing something if you want he showed up every single time every single time he's never failed anybody and if we can just find how to love those people in that situation and stop trying to change them into what we think is okay what we think is not a mess then we can know what God needs what God has for those people to do if we can just get out of the way and lose our control let God be God he's the same yesterday today and forever he knows love he is love if we do anything without love we're nothing we can change that right now we can change that any time just let go of that control let it go and let God God has an easy burden he wants to give it to you all all you have to do is turn it over to him there's nothing to worry about nothing to worry about he's got it with God before you what can stand against you what are you worried about we have God there's nothing to be worried about it might look like a mess because it is and it might be a really bad situation but God
