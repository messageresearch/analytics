[3:40] creatures of his grace is raise hands
[3:42] and lift up voices and just begin to
[3:44] worship you know that atmosphere that
[3:46] you feel just imagine that's just a
[3:49] taste
[3:51] just of just a moment just a taste of
[3:53] Heaven just to Earnest the Bible says
[3:56] the Holy Ghost is just the earnest my
[3:58] goodness if that's just the down payment
[4:00] brother Paul what's it going to be like
[4:01] when I receive the fullness
[4:04] amen of my inheritance I'm looking
[4:06] forward to it but I want to say I'm glad
[4:08] that I can get a taste this morning amen
[4:10] just for a moment just to fill Heaven
[4:12] amen we'd walk through a world of
[4:15] weariness and dreeriness and suffering
[4:17] and pain my goodness I'm so thankful to
[4:20] have a place where we can gather and
[4:22] just touch the Lord
[4:25] amen Joshua chapter 4 if you have your
[4:27] Bible amen certainly a great honor to be
[4:30] here with you thank you for that gift
[4:32] basket whoever that was that brought
[4:34] that and put that in the room amen thank
[4:36] you appreciate that a lot
[4:38] and want to bring greetings also from my
[4:40] dad and the church back home Amen to
[4:43] send their love and greetings we love
[4:44] you here amen at literal life and love
[4:47] this the the uh the ministry that you
[4:49] have here of music and Ministry and amen
[4:52] and just down through the many many
[4:54] years I was reminiscing with brother
[4:55] Paul last night took me on a little
[4:57] historic drive when we left and I
[5:00] preached at that original I guess it was
[5:01] the original Church uh there years and
[5:04] years ago and then again there in the
[5:06] building you were in last time and what
[5:08] a upgrade amen what a wonderful upgrade
[5:10] this is amen and I believe that with it
[5:13] you know it's one thing to have a nice
[5:15] building but I just believe Lord if
[5:17] you've increased this this way then I
[5:19] can say Lord increase this in your
[5:20] spirit increases in your presence Lord
[5:23] let it if that went up a notch then let
[5:25] our praise go up Lord amen let our
[5:27] worship go up he's worthy of it amen
[5:31] hallelujah well we're again just want to
[5:33] uh be obedient to the Lord this morning
[5:35] and what he have us to speak and so I'm
[5:38] going to minister to you this morning
[5:39] out of Joshua chapter four we got a
[5:41] lengthy reading and so I'll just get
[5:43] right to it also in second Kings chapter
[5:45] two
[5:47] amen I've ministered this thought of
[5:49] actually a few different parts and so
[5:52] when I ministered it maybe a way the
[5:55] lord always has a way to change me I
[5:57] don't honestly I beat straight up with
[5:59] you this morning I don't have any notes
[6:00] uh here before me and so just the Lord
[6:03] is just so impressed this upon my heart
[6:05] just a burden and you know I believe as
[6:09] brother Brandon talks about that the
[6:11] woman with the blood issue in the Bible
[6:12] who who needed to get to Jesus and
[6:15] brother Branham says something so
[6:16] amazing about that little woman with
[6:17] that issue and he says you know the
[6:19] father had shown Jesus Lazarus he had
[6:22] shown him jerice's daughter he had shown
[6:24] him and led him and Jesus was just
[6:26] obedient to the father's Direction and
[6:29] did you know brother Madam said but
[6:30] actually that little woman with that
[6:31] blood issue the father didn't show it
[6:33] that's why he says when she touched him
[6:35] who touched me
[6:37] brother Brandon says see she operated
[6:40] the gift that was in the Son of God and
[6:42] she with her need Drew out from the Lord
[6:45] Jesus what she needed
[6:48] so I believe if you're here Jesus is the
[6:50] same yesterday today and forever and
[6:52] maybe God has prepared me a certain
[6:54] direction but I believe that the pool of
[6:56] your heart if you've got a need this
[6:58] morning can take a Ministry God's put a
[7:00] gift in my life and can just move me out
[7:02] of the way and I could go down a channel
[7:03] that would even be in my mind here at
[7:06] this moment but I believe that's just
[7:08] how real the Lord Jesus is I believe
[7:10] that's just the hour that we're living
[7:12] in today friends you know the Bible the
[7:15] the devil is more evident and more
[7:17] manifest ever than he's ever been he's
[7:19] bold he's right out in the open he's not
[7:21] hiding hey in case you haven't read the
[7:23] news
[7:24] the devil is no longer hiding under a
[7:26] rock somewhere you know working subs and
[7:29] subtility and subliminally that's not
[7:31] what the devil's doing if ever before
[7:33] there was ever a time that you live in
[7:35] the devil is manifesting himself right
[7:38] out in the open as bold as he could ever
[7:40] be right in your face
[7:42] well I just happen to believe that if
[7:44] hell wants to manifest himself right out
[7:46] in the open I got to believe that heaven
[7:49] wants to manifest himself right out in
[7:52] the open brother Brennan says when all
[7:54] hell turns loose all Heaven lets loose
[7:58] and I say heaven let go this morning how
[8:00] many would say that and say Lord I Give
[8:03] You full Reign for preeminence amen this
[8:06] morning to do whatever whatever we have
[8:08] planned we'll put that aside and let the
[8:10] Holy Spirit move I believe when we
[8:12] really have that in our heart God can do
[8:14] something special
[8:16] amen Joshua chapter 4 we're going to
[8:18] speak to you this morning on anointed by
[8:21] the supernatural
[8:22] anointed by the Supernatural and we
[8:25] talked a lot last night about an
[8:26] anointing and so we just want to carry
[8:28] that over from last night
[8:30] and it came to pass when all the people
[8:32] were clean passed over Jordan
[8:35] that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying
[8:38] take you 12 men out of the people out of
[8:41] every tribe of man
[8:43] and command you them saying take you
[8:46] hence out of the midst of Jordan out of
[8:48] the place where the priest feet stood
[8:52] firm
[8:54] now notice what your Bible's saying here
[8:56] this is important it's where the priest
[8:59] feat stood not jellyfish not cowards not
[9:04] backing down under pressure but the
[9:06] Bible says we're the priest feat stood
[9:09] firm
[9:11] 12 Stones and you shall carry them over
[9:14] with you and leave them in the lodging
[9:17] place where you shall Lodge this night
[9:20] then Joshua called the 12 men whom he
[9:22] had prepared of the children of Israel
[9:23] out of every tribe of man Joshua said
[9:26] unto them pass over
[9:28] before the Ark of the Lord your God into
[9:30] the midst of Jordan now remember
[9:32] Jordan's going to represent two things
[9:34] the prophet of God said it represents
[9:36] sin
[9:37] and it represents death
[9:40] Jordan is going to represent death and
[9:43] so these these priests under that
[9:45] levitical priesthood would go into the
[9:47] water and they would Place their feet in
[9:50] the water and this is what Joshua says
[9:51] and take you up every man of you a stone
[9:54] upon his shoulder verse 5 according to
[9:57] the unto the number of the tribes of the
[10:00] children of Israel so 12 Stones they're
[10:02] going to take these stones and the Bible
[10:04] says that this may be a sign among you
[10:07] that when your children ask their
[10:11] fathers now anytime is a message
[10:13] believer you see children and fathers
[10:15] your mind ought to go to one place
[10:18] that behold I'll send you Elijah the
[10:20] prophet he didn't send him to everybody
[10:22] listen friends you can't convince a
[10:24] person who's not meant to see this
[10:26] message the message
[10:27] you can try you can persuade but Elijah
[10:30] was only sent to a certain specific
[10:32] group of people
[10:34] and so the Bible says he shall turn the
[10:37] hearts of the children
[10:40] back to the fathers
[10:44] and so Joshua's saying I want you to
[10:46] take these stones and I'm going to have
[10:48] you set this up as a memorial isn't it
[10:51] powerful that God would provision
[10:53] something now for something a need that
[10:57] would come up way down the road later on
[10:59] when children are born and children
[11:01] begin to ask their parents and say what
[11:03] do these Stones even mean
[11:06] Hallelujah
[11:08] and he says when your children shall ask
[11:11] their fathers in time to come saying
[11:13] what mean ye by these stones
[11:17] then you shall answer them that the
[11:20] Waters of Jordan were cut off before the
[11:22] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it
[11:24] passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan
[11:26] were cut off and these Stones shall be
[11:28] for a memorial under the children of
[11:31] Israel forever Joshua verse 9 set up 12
[11:35] Stones in the midst of Jordan in the
[11:37] place where the feet of the priests
[11:40] which bore the Ark of the Covenant stood
[11:43] and they are there unto this day meaning
[11:48] the day that it was written for the
[11:50] priest shall bear the ark for the priest
[11:52] which bore the ark stood
[11:56] I love that
[11:58] they stood they didn't waver
[12:01] the priests which bore the Ark of the
[12:03] Covenant listen these men were holding
[12:05] back death
[12:06] from the people's lives and when you're
[12:09] standing in a position to hold back or
[12:12] to protect or defend you've got to keep
[12:14] your feet firmly planted as God to Moses
[12:17] told Joshua don't waver Joshua don't
[12:19] look to the left or to the right
[12:22] until notice until everything was
[12:26] finished
[12:28] that the Lord commanded to Joshua to
[12:30] speak unto the people according to all
[12:32] that Moses commanded Joshua and the
[12:34] people passed over one more scripture
[12:36] and I'll have you be seated second Kings
[12:38] chapter 2 verse 1 and it came to pass
[12:41] when the Lord would take up Elijah into
[12:43] Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went
[12:46] with Elisha from gilgall and Elijah said
[12:49] unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for
[12:53] the Lord hath sent me to Bethel
[12:55] and Elisha said unto him as the Lord
[12:59] liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not
[13:03] leave thee
[13:04] so they went down to Bethel
[13:08] verse 4 and Elijah said unto him Terry
[13:11] here I pray thee
[13:12] for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho
[13:15] and he said as the Lord liveth and is
[13:17] thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so
[13:20] they came to Jericho verse 6 and Elijah
[13:23] said unto him Terry I pray thee here for
[13:26] the Lord hath sent me to Jordan and he
[13:29] said as the Lord liveth and is thy soul
[13:31] liveth I will not leave thee and they
[13:35] too went on verse 8 and Elijah took his
[13:39] mantle and wrapped it together
[13:41] and smote the waters and they were
[13:44] divided hither and thither so that they
[13:47] too went over own dry ground
[13:49] and it came to pass when they were going
[13:51] over that Elijah said unto Elisha
[13:54] ask
[13:57] what I shall do for thee
[14:01] it's a powerful thing
[14:03] when the Lord Jesus asks his children
[14:05] ask
[14:07] what I shall do for thee in other words
[14:09] sister Hattie whatever you say right now
[14:14] whatever your whatever you speak sister
[14:17] Hattie whatever you say right now will
[14:20] be done unto you notice do you realize
[14:22] how powerful words are not just thoughts
[14:25] but words are thoughts expressed because
[14:28] when you speak words you're creating or
[14:31] disturbing the atmosphere that's around
[14:33] you that's why worship is so powerful
[14:36] that's why the preaching of the word
[14:37] comes by vocal cords and voice because
[14:40] you speak the word of God and that
[14:43] changes the atmosphere around you
[14:46] and brother Brandon said that when
[14:47] sister Hattie Wright spoke those words
[14:49] it felt like the room was about to come
[14:52] apart
[14:54] and he said whatever you say right now
[14:56] at this moment Elijah says to Elisha ask
[14:59] what I shall do for thee
[15:02] ask whatever you ask right now it'll be
[15:05] done before I be taken away from thee
[15:07] and Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[15:11] portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[15:14] and he said thou has asked a hard thing
[15:18] now it wasn't going to be hard for God
[15:21] as nothing is too hard for the Lord
[15:24] it wasn't going to be hard for Elijah he
[15:27] was leaving
[15:29] but the harder way would be for Elisha
[15:34] you've asked a hard thing nevertheless
[15:37] now notice this is powerful if thou see
[15:40] me when I am taken from thee it shall be
[15:43] so unto thee but if not it shall not be
[15:47] so do you realize that when you
[15:49] transliterate this verse this is
[15:51] literally what Elijah's saying to Elisha
[15:53] Elisha I'm about to leave the scene I'm
[15:56] about to go home and if when I leave if
[15:59] you see me gone
[16:02] in other words if you see me taken if
[16:05] you see me as taken from you
[16:09] in other words you can't see me and
[16:12] still want me to be here and still only
[16:14] see Elijah
[16:15] but if you see Elijah that Elijah is
[16:18] gone he's went on to his reward if you
[16:21] see me that I'm taken from you but yet
[16:23] Elisha there's still a work for you to
[16:25] do
[16:26] there's still a commission for the bride
[16:28] to do there's still a position you've
[16:30] got to come to you can't see Elijah
[16:32] anymore you got to stop looking at
[16:34] Elijah because the focus has now changed
[16:37] to not the prophet but his prophecy
[16:41] I believe there's Believers here
[16:44] amen and he says he says if you see me
[16:47] when I go notice this here if you see me
[16:49] uh verse 10. and it shall be so but if
[16:53] not it shall not be so and it came to
[16:55] passes they still went on and talked
[16:57] that behold they're repaired a chariot
[16:59] of fire and Horses of fire and parted
[17:01] them both asunder and Elijah went up by
[17:03] a whirlwind unto heaven and Elisha saw
[17:06] it and cried my father
[17:07] Elijah saw it and said my father my
[17:10] father The Chariot and of Israel and the
[17:12] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[17:19] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[17:22] he rent them into two pieces and he took
[17:25] up also the mantle of Elijah that fell
[17:28] from him and went back and stood by the
[17:31] bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of
[17:33] Elijah that fell from him and smote the
[17:35] waters and said notice not where's
[17:37] Elijah
[17:42] but where's the god of Elijah
[17:47] Heavenly Father Lord we just right now
[17:49] we bow Lord before you all one one and
[17:53] all
[17:54] Lord we're all equal
[17:56] all Lord at the foot of the cross
[17:59] Lord right now God In This Moment I just
[18:02] so need you to come Lord Jesus
[18:04] father I've watched you time and time
[18:07] and time again Lord when I've preached
[18:09] this message
[18:10] Lord I've watched a special thing take
[18:12] place
[18:13] Lord and I believe that same God who's
[18:16] shown up time and time again when we
[18:18] begin to speak about you your Prophet
[18:19] said then you come near
[18:21] Lord and I believe Lord that the healing
[18:24] angels in this building right now Lord I
[18:26] pray that you would break the spirit of
[18:28] resistance Lord at this moment god
[18:30] father may you break the callous may you
[18:33] break the heart and Heart Lord so that
[18:36] fertile ground would be able to receive
[18:38] your word we ask Lord I pray God you
[18:41] know that I'm nothing and within me Lord
[18:42] is no good thing
[18:44] Lord and I need your grace right now to
[18:46] come and take preeminence Lord we Just
[18:49] Surrender ourselves our vessel Lord to
[18:51] you
[18:52] Grant it now Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[18:54] amen amen you can be seated
[19:00] foreign
[19:03] God is going to be take Elijah home and
[19:06] his ministry has came to an end Elijah
[19:09] knows this he knows that his days were
[19:11] coming that you take some on this
[19:13] journey and even before he goes on this
[19:16] journey with Elijah with Elisha Elijah
[19:19] already knew that the Lord was going to
[19:21] take him home and it's going to be a
[19:24] very difficult thing for Elisha it's
[19:26] going to be a very hard thing for Elisha
[19:29] because no doubt through the times of
[19:31] his life and through watching the
[19:32] ministry of Elijah he was no doubt just
[19:35] in awe and enamored by the ministry of
[19:38] this man and the Miracles and the the
[19:40] signs and the Wonders and just the way
[19:42] that God had chosen to use this man in
[19:45] such a powerful way and you can survey
[19:47] his entire life and throughout his the
[19:50] course of his life God had shown up in
[19:52] such Supernatural ways but now his life
[19:55] was ending and the dispensation you
[19:58] could say was changing and there was a
[20:00] changing of the Garb or the passing of
[20:03] on and so this moment was a very
[20:06] important moment in the life of Elisha
[20:09] it was the beginning of something new
[20:12] and the ending of something previous you
[20:15] know the Bible speaks about the death of
[20:17] the testator and you could read that in
[20:18] the book of Hebrews that how that a will
[20:20] or a covenant can't go into effect until
[20:23] the death of one and then something else
[20:26] begins I think it's a powerful principle
[20:29] in our life that many times God has
[20:31] something that he's wanting to release
[20:33] or something that he's wanting to give
[20:36] or pour out upon a person but until
[20:39] there comes a separation or a death of
[20:42] one thing the new thing can never come
[20:44] into effect no matter how much God wills
[20:47] it or God wants it you can even take it
[20:49] down to relationships that and it would
[20:52] be a could you could type it down to any
[20:54] place or any spot in your life that many
[20:56] times some of the things God's wanting
[20:59] to give us he is bound by a covenant or
[21:02] a will that there must be the death of
[21:05] one thing an order for something else to
[21:08] begin and you know no one likes change
[21:10] nobody here around us all of us are
[21:12] creatures we love the same thing we love
[21:15] our children to say the same size and
[21:17] the same age and the same face and the
[21:19] same smile and we hate things that
[21:21] change I'm not the only one am I here
[21:23] today but we hate change but you know
[21:25] God's always a god of change he's always
[21:28] a God on the Move growth is natural it's
[21:31] the way that God matures anything is
[21:33] through seasons and of change
[21:35] but there must be the death of one and
[21:38] nothing can be held on to the previous
[21:41] an order for the new to take effect
[21:46] and so Elijah knows this this is the
[21:49] last few moments of his life this is
[21:51] your reading some of the last things
[21:53] that he will say you're reading some of
[21:56] the last moments that Elijah has you say
[21:58] brother Matt do you believe that Elijah
[22:00] knew he was going I believe that he did
[22:02] I believe even our Prophet God's Prophet
[22:05] knew that his days were numbered and and
[22:07] you can read some of the last things
[22:08] that he's saying here and some of the
[22:11] last moments this is some of the the
[22:13] last experiences he takes him through
[22:15] these three cities of gilgallon and
[22:18] Jericho and Bethel and these are three
[22:21] powerful cities if you study your Bible
[22:23] for Israel this was always significance
[22:26] these cities drew some type of
[22:28] significance they were significant in
[22:30] Elijah's Ministry they were going to be
[22:32] significant and Elisha's and so you're
[22:35] reading some of the last few things
[22:38] some of the last words
[22:42] some of the last things he wants to
[22:45] convey and it's it's so important it's
[22:49] it's so it's so Paramount to Elijah that
[22:52] he passes off the right Reflections the
[22:56] right the right thoughts the right
[22:58] perspective the the to set his course in
[23:01] the right direction it's going to be
[23:03] important some of the last words that he
[23:07] he's going to speak
[23:09] you could read some of the last words of
[23:11] Mighty Men of God in the Bible you can
[23:13] read the last words of Jacob as he
[23:15] begins to tell his children don't leave
[23:17] my bones in in Egypt but take them to
[23:20] Canaan to the promised land you could
[23:22] read some of the last words of Joseph
[23:23] you go on your Bible and read some of
[23:26] the last words of David that David's on
[23:28] his deathbed and he's mentioning some of
[23:30] the last things to his son
[23:33] I've been scouring just over months now
[23:36] just what were some of the last words
[23:39] over some of the last thoughts
[23:43] upon God's Prophet before he left the
[23:46] scene
[23:47] what was some of the last things that he
[23:50] wanted to convey what was some of the
[23:52] last burdens that was upon his heart
[23:55] you see the last some of the last
[23:58] moments or the last reflections of that
[24:00] individual's life
[24:02] can have a great imprint upon the
[24:05] generation that's raising up
[24:07] they can have a great impact on the
[24:10] expectation that is set upon the new
[24:13] generation
[24:14] and depending on the depending on the
[24:16] the the the moments of that man's life
[24:19] well have a great impact at what the
[24:22] next generation is looking for what
[24:24] they're reaching for what they're
[24:26] striving for what they're running for it
[24:28] sets their course and so Elijah takes
[24:31] Elisha through these cities now these
[24:34] cities were amazing because in Elijah's
[24:37] life Jericho was a city that you could
[24:39] say was in Revival
[24:41] it was under great expectation
[24:44] even Bethel we read about it last night
[24:46] you can read about it at first when
[24:48] Jacob dreams a dream and sees Angels
[24:52] coming from heaven and ascending and
[24:53] descending
[24:55] and bethel's a powerful City even under
[24:57] the ministry of of Elijah it's a city
[25:01] you could say that was on Revival it was
[25:03] it was under expectation and God did
[25:06] many mighty Works in this city even
[25:08] gilgall
[25:09] but this is going to be a very specific
[25:12] Journey that Elijah takes Elisha through
[25:15] and he's passing through as he's this
[25:18] old Prophet is coming to the end of his
[25:21] days
[25:22] and he's pondering maybe his life
[25:25] it's pondering all of the journey
[25:28] pondering all of the as we spoke on last
[25:30] night all of the highs and all of the
[25:33] lows and
[25:34] all of the journey that God had led him
[25:36] through
[25:37] and he's coming to ponder this last few
[25:40] moments
[25:41] imagine the burden that was upon Elijah
[25:45] knowing that the work was far from over
[25:49] knowing that the Battlegrounds and
[25:52] territories that have been gained yet
[25:54] even after he leaves he knows that the
[25:57] course and effect of life that there's
[25:59] still more ground to gain
[26:01] there's still more battles to win that
[26:04] we haven't fully taken our inheritance
[26:07] and we haven't fully came to the
[26:09] position that that was in the back part
[26:12] of God's mind he even knows this that
[26:14] there's there's still so much work
[26:18] left to do
[26:21] and so he begins to take him as we said
[26:24] on this journey through these towns of
[26:27] Jericho and Bethel and he brings Elisha
[26:30] with him and they set out on this
[26:33] journey and and at each stop after they
[26:35] visit the town they arrive at the bank
[26:38] of Jordan Elijah takes off his mantle
[26:41] this is just a robe it's a wide loose
[26:44] cloth it's a it's a a garment that he's
[26:48] wearing
[26:49] now I want to say to you today that
[26:51] there was nothing in particular about
[26:53] the mantle that was special it wasn't
[26:56] the stitching wasn't the type of
[26:58] clothing it wasn't even the material
[27:01] that it was made out of
[27:03] but within that mantle
[27:05] it was drenched with an anointing from
[27:10] Jehovah
[27:12] and within that mantle though there was
[27:14] nothing peculiar about the outside of it
[27:16] nothing special in fact most likely it
[27:19] was something very simple and maybe
[27:22] unremarkable to anybody else
[27:25] but Elisha knew that within that mantle
[27:28] was The Inheritance or the promise of
[27:33] blessing of Jehovah
[27:36] and so he takes off this mantle and the
[27:40] Bible says that he smites the waters and
[27:44] supernaturally Jordan parts and they
[27:47] walk over on dry ground
[27:50] now this was a special experience for
[27:52] Elisha to experience something also
[27:55] years before that we read about in
[27:57] Joshua that Joshua was at the Jordan
[27:59] River and they're going to part the
[28:00] Jordan River and now that powerful
[28:03] moment of The God Who Parks Waters has
[28:06] been passed from one generation to the
[28:09] Next Generation to the Next Generation
[28:11] notice not everything was passed down
[28:14] but some of the most important things
[28:16] for the people to understand that God is
[28:19] a God who Parts your Jordan
[28:23] God is a God who moves back death
[28:27] who can remove Sin from your life
[28:30] and David said we will not hide these
[28:32] things from our children but we will
[28:34] tell them another generation and another
[28:37] generation about the powerful works of
[28:39] God you can't tell them everything you
[28:41] can't pass it all down you can't give
[28:43] them all of your wisdom and all of your
[28:45] understanding but you can pass down a
[28:48] supernatural God who's never the never
[28:51] changing he's always the same and you
[28:53] can say to your children the same God
[28:55] that has been faithful to me all the
[28:58] days of my life will be remain faithful
[29:01] to you in your life if you'll serve him
[29:03] all the days of your life
[29:07] and so he passes this down as they walk
[29:09] through Jordan and all the prophets the
[29:12] school of the of the prophets the
[29:14] prophet killed there the Bible calls it
[29:16] the school of the prophets watch this
[29:18] great event take place and he smites the
[29:21] waters and Jordan Parks and it's a
[29:24] powerful thing as he comes through these
[29:26] this place and he comes and he says ask
[29:29] what I shall do for thee before I be
[29:31] taken from thee
[29:33] there's no hesitation at all there's no
[29:36] contemplating there's no measuring
[29:38] there's no trying to figure it out
[29:40] that Elisha just gives a very simple
[29:42] answer and he says I pray thee let a
[29:46] double portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[29:52] all right
[29:55] now what's so powerful about Bethel and
[29:57] Jericho as we said is in the Days of
[30:00] Elijah when he's starting out his
[30:03] ministry and he's he's going through and
[30:05] there's Mighty Miracles Bethel was a
[30:07] town that was rejoicing was in Revival
[30:09] and Jericho was very much the same they
[30:12] were on fire you could say with God and
[30:14] great Revival fires burning him and
[30:16] Elijah's Ministries there and everyone
[30:18] wants to see the power of God and and
[30:20] they're in his meetings and there's
[30:22] great crowds and Great Gatherings of
[30:24] people and and great expectation and and
[30:27] everyone's there under the ministry and
[30:29] is just accepting him and invited him to
[30:31] his churches and invited him to his
[30:34] meetings and wanting to be part of the
[30:35] revivals and wanted to get a picture
[30:37] with him and wanting to put him in the
[30:39] newspaper and make their announcements
[30:41] and but oh how so different these same
[30:45] exact cities were at the end of Elijah's
[30:48] Ministry in contrast to the beginning of
[30:51] his ministry
[30:53] now these cities are in fact so
[30:56] backslidden that they're mocking God's
[30:59] prophet
[31:01] that they're mocking and mockering an
[31:03] entire generation has risen up that is
[31:06] literally mocking The Works of God in
[31:09] this man's life and so much that Bethel
[31:11] is so backslidden and Jericho's such a
[31:14] sinful City and Jericho is so bad that
[31:16] Elijah says come on Elijah stay here why
[31:20] don't you plant a garden and build a
[31:22] home and put your children here and
[31:23] raise a family come on Elisha you'd make
[31:27] a good pastor to these people you'd make
[31:30] a good man and Elijah says no as the
[31:32] Lord God liveth as my soul liveth I'm
[31:35] staying right here beside Elijah I'm not
[31:38] going to depart from him I'm not going
[31:40] to remove from him I've made my decision
[31:43] I've made my choice
[31:44] I want to stay with the anointed mantle
[31:47] of God I want to stay with the presence
[31:49] of God there's only one Elijah that can
[31:52] turn my heart back
[31:56] and now the city that is so was so
[31:59] accepted of him before oh how very
[32:02] different when Elijah comes to his real
[32:04] Ministry and then suddenly he comes to
[32:06] the desert and he says you know I never
[32:09] wanted to start a church here in Tucson
[32:11] I actually just wanted to be part of
[32:13] your fellowship and I come to those
[32:15] meetings and brother Brandon goes to
[32:16] that
[32:18] men's bible breakfast there and the Full
[32:21] Gospel businessman and the man from the
[32:23] Assemblies of God has put it on and
[32:25] there's a presbyterian man there there's
[32:27] a Catholic priest sitting there and
[32:28] brother Brandon Gets behind that
[32:30] microphone and says you know I never
[32:32] wanted to start up a church here and I
[32:34] never wanted to break up any kind of
[32:35] Fellowship but I sat here in the desert
[32:38] for three years and you never invited me
[32:41] to your pulpits you never invited me to
[32:43] your churches you you never invited my
[32:45] Ministry what was it friends you know
[32:47] when he was coming to his real Ministry
[32:49] there was great rejection of that
[32:52] Ministry everyone can receive the fishes
[32:55] and Loaves and the Miracles oh listen
[32:56] friends let me just preacher for a
[32:58] moment everybody loves the spectacular
[33:00] everybody loves the blessings of God
[33:02] everybody loves a good feeling
[33:05] everybody loves a good Miracle a good
[33:07] circus a good show that you can show oh
[33:10] but when it comes to the word
[33:13] they'll always show their true colors
[33:16] when it comes to the word as the Bible
[33:18] says when Jesus began to speak and he
[33:21] would say unless you eat the Flesh and
[33:23] drink the blood of the son of man you
[33:24] have no part and even the disciples said
[33:27] this is a hard saying
[33:29] who can bear it
[33:32] this is a hard thing who can bear it and
[33:35] you know what the disciples are saying
[33:36] that and suddenly a hundred and some
[33:39] people get up and leave the room
[33:42] and the only people sitting there you
[33:43] imagine a view if everybody in the
[33:45] church leaves the church and it's you
[33:46] and 12 11 other people
[33:48] and then the pastor looks at you and
[33:50] says what are you doing here
[33:55] won't you go also oh Lord do who would
[33:57] we go
[34:00] and so powerful to me that this same
[34:02] Nation who was accepting of the word of
[34:05] God who was pulling on the word of God
[34:08] who wanted Revival in their churches who
[34:10] wanted the power of God to move who
[34:12] wanted the who wanted the ministry of
[34:15] Elijah now when he comes to his real
[34:17] Ministry and now when the word is being
[34:19] preached that the word divides asunder
[34:21] and suddenly they're going you know what
[34:23] I don't know about this guy and I'm just
[34:25] not so sure about this and you know I I
[34:28] I don't know really what that was I
[34:30] can't speak to to what that was
[34:31] yesterday but all I know today is that's
[34:33] just a little bit too hard for me
[34:38] and so even even this man in his life
[34:41] that there's great acceptance there's
[34:44] great there's great uh uh
[34:46] uh attraction
[34:48] but now he comes to this last stage of
[34:50] his life and some of the last Journeys
[34:52] and these are some of the last words
[34:54] that he's going to speak to Elijah
[34:56] before he crosses Jordan and Jordan's
[34:59] going to represent death to the to the
[35:01] to all of Israel it's going to represent
[35:03] sin it's amazing because you even go
[35:05] before this and you imagine here's
[35:07] Joshua standing there ready to cross
[35:09] over Jordan and and and God brings him
[35:12] to this place and and God tells him he
[35:14] says I want you to take uh the priests
[35:17] these are levitical priests you know God
[35:19] had chose these men specifically God
[35:22] didn't have this responsibility neither
[35:24] did Reuben or Manasseh or Simeon but God
[35:27] had chosen the levitical priesthood to
[35:30] Bear a certain responsibility that no
[35:33] one else would have to bear that no one
[35:35] else would ever have to go through
[35:36] listen to me friends your pastor in the
[35:38] ministry goes through things that you
[35:40] may never understand and God will take
[35:43] them through certain Journeys and to go
[35:45] through certain things and certain
[35:46] battles that they have to face that
[35:48] maybe you don't have a clue or could
[35:50] never relate with but their commissioned
[35:53] and anointed of God to stand in that
[35:56] place for your life
[35:58] I want to notice you to notice something
[36:00] so powerful about this Crossing of
[36:02] Jordan as God says I want you to take 12
[36:05] men and I want these to be priests and
[36:07] he says that out of every tribe a man I
[36:10] want you to take from the children of
[36:12] Israel and so God brings up these
[36:14] Levites and here's a man and here's
[36:16] another man the Bible says it this way
[36:18] that when they put their feet in the
[36:21] water Jordan Will part
[36:24] now notice friends not before not when
[36:26] they thought it not when God told them
[36:29] that was Jordan ready to part but it
[36:30] looked just like the Jordan that was
[36:32] always there
[36:33] and so that but the Bible says when they
[36:35] put their feet in the water oh so you
[36:38] mean sometimes you have to do something
[36:40] naturally
[36:41] and order for there to be a supernatural
[36:44] consequence
[36:45] sometimes God's expecting you to do
[36:48] something in order for him to listen to
[36:51] me friends sometimes what you bind in
[36:53] heaven will also be bound in Earth
[36:55] sometimes what you loose in heaven will
[36:58] also be loosed in Earth
[36:59] sometimes you've got to speak it Hattie
[37:05] sometimes you've got to speak the word
[37:07] because when you speak that changes the
[37:10] atmosphere around you and you might have
[37:12] doubt and destruction and discouragement
[37:14] all around you but just start to whisper
[37:16] the word of God start this speak the
[37:19] name of Jesus and watch what happens to
[37:21] your atmosphere
[37:22] and so God says I want you to take 12
[37:24] men and so he takes all of these men and
[37:27] he puts their feet in the water command
[37:29] brother Paul I want you to use you and
[37:30] brother Brandon if you could just hear
[37:31] for a moment in the ministry any other
[37:33] ministering Brothers if you just come
[37:35] here just for an illustration here for a
[37:37] moment and I want you to notice that God
[37:39] says as these men take if you could face
[37:41] brother Paul as these men come any other
[37:44] brothers here Ministry brothers would
[37:46] come this come if you could have not we
[37:48] just got two and that's fine Brother
[37:49] Gideon come on maybe one more brother
[37:51] just stand here brother get him beside
[37:52] on this side of your dad and stand there
[37:55] now this is what God instructs Joshua to
[37:57] do he says I want you to take 12 men out
[38:01] of the priests now not just out of
[38:03] everybody but this is the levitical
[38:05] order that God has placed this burden in
[38:08] their heart and notice behind each man
[38:11] out of these 12 men is going to
[38:14] represent a stone
[38:15] you notice when Aaron wore that
[38:17] breastplate and inside that urim and
[38:19] thumbum there were 12 Stones the Sardis
[38:22] and topaz and carbuncle and the Ruben
[38:24] and the Jasper and all of those stones
[38:27] that he wore on his breastplate was
[38:29] actually representing a tribe
[38:32] because behind that Sardis and behind
[38:35] that topaz was an entire tribe of God
[38:37] and the entire tribe of Reuben and so on
[38:39] the day of Yom kompur the day of
[38:41] atonement when that air in the high
[38:43] priest would come into the holiest of
[38:45] holies he was bearing the burdens of all
[38:48] of the people you say why is that
[38:50] powerful brother Matt because within
[38:52] that tribe was a family and within that
[38:56] family was a mother and there was a
[38:58] father and there was sometimes sickness
[39:00] and there was sometimes disease there
[39:02] were sometimes financial problems and
[39:04] issues with children and the issues in
[39:06] homes and real life problems
[39:09] come on somebody we got real life
[39:11] problems sometimes
[39:13] we can be very real and so he would he
[39:16] would represent all of those families
[39:19] and so behind each priest was a stone
[39:21] that represented a certain family oh I'm
[39:25] so glad that when Aaron went behind
[39:27] there listened friends he was carrying
[39:29] all the burdens of the people upon his
[39:32] heart
[39:33] and when Jesus went to the Cross he was
[39:36] representing every one of his children
[39:38] upon his heart that meant all of my
[39:41] needs and all of my troubles and all of
[39:43] my struggles
[39:45] because all of the burdens were upon the
[39:48] heart of the priest
[39:49] and God says I want you to put your feet
[39:52] in
[39:54] death
[39:58] and you're going to stand in a place
[40:00] that no one else has to stand
[40:04] but here's what's important stand
[40:08] here's what's important hold your ground
[40:12] here's what's important cat and Simeon
[40:14] here all of these priests are gonna that
[40:16] they're depending upon you they're
[40:18] depending upon the priest to keep their
[40:21] feet in the water
[40:25] and God says I want you and as they put
[40:27] their foot in the water a little bit of
[40:29] Jordan parts and they put their next
[40:31] foot in the water and a little bit more
[40:34] of Jordan Parks and they put their next
[40:36] foot in the water and it's scary and
[40:38] it's it's Troublesome but as they put
[40:40] their foot in Jordan the water begins to
[40:42] part and before you know it there's a
[40:44] highway from this Bank all the way to
[40:46] the other bank and God says I want the
[40:48] priest to keep their feet and he says
[40:50] and I want you to to stand and keep your
[40:52] feet there so you're standing firm and
[40:55] all of the families with all of their
[40:57] little ones and all of their young ones
[40:59] are to pass through the priests
[41:05] and you say how long are the priests
[41:07] going to stand there until the work is
[41:10] finished
[41:12] I said until the work is finished
[41:15] they're going to keep their feet in the
[41:17] water listen to me friends I hope you
[41:19] catch it here today I ask you what's
[41:21] keeping Jordan out of your life
[41:27] what's keeping sin out of our families
[41:30] what's keeping the devil this lady is
[41:32] seeing lukewarm age with all of its
[41:34] standards changing and trying to
[41:36] redefine everything I asked you what
[41:38] keeps Jordan out of your home out of
[41:40] your young people out of your minds out
[41:43] of your children out of your body's out
[41:45] of your spirits what's holding back the
[41:47] devil out of our churches and our
[41:49] families do you realize what would
[41:51] happen if we took preachers out of the
[41:53] pulpit and stop preaching and stop
[41:56] preaching the word of God do you realize
[41:58] what's holding back the tidal wave of
[42:00] sin
[42:03] do we have a church here today that
[42:05] would say preach the word preach it
[42:08] straight brother Paul preaching shade
[42:11] Brothers give me the unadulterated word
[42:13] of God don't compromise don't die I
[42:16] don't care about my feelings don't
[42:17] listen to me friends you don't want to
[42:19] know the sign of a false prophet is
[42:20] he'll tell you everything you want to
[42:22] hear and everything that makes you feel
[42:23] good you want to know what the sign of a
[42:25] true Prophet is a man who doesn't care
[42:27] about your feelings he's lost his
[42:30] reputation he doesn't care if it hurts
[42:32] you and I say you've got a church here
[42:34] they don't say preach me the word of God
[42:36] tell it to me straight brother Paul
[42:38] preach it to me preach preacher the word
[42:41] of God unadulterated word of God give
[42:43] these brothers a hand clap this morning
[42:48] he says I want you to take 12 Stones
[42:52] now out of the place where the priest
[42:54] feet stood firm not just any stone
[42:56] Joshua
[42:57] his right foot was here
[43:00] and his left foot was here
[43:02] out of the place where they stood and he
[43:05] places one and then he places another
[43:07] and then he places another and before
[43:09] you know it there's a memorial of stones
[43:11] of everywhere the priest feet stood firm
[43:15] you say brother Matt why couldn't it be
[43:17] any stone it couldn't just be any stone
[43:19] because these Stones were going to
[43:22] represent truths that would turn the
[43:24] hearts of the children back to the
[43:27] fathers
[43:30] that's why the prophet of God said it
[43:31] with a messenger of Malachi 4 will do
[43:33] two things he'll reveal the Thunders the
[43:36] the seven Thunders which are the
[43:38] Mysteries contained within the Seven
[43:39] Seals and it will be these
[43:42] Mysteries these mystery Divine mystery
[43:45] truths that will literally turn the
[43:48] hearts of the children back to the faith
[43:52] of the of the original Pentecostal
[43:56] fathers
[43:58] and listen to me friends unless your
[44:00] heart has been turned back
[44:03] I don't care what experience you've had
[44:05] I don't care what intellect you've had I
[44:07] don't care how much you've studied how
[44:08] much you've read how much you've spoken
[44:10] tongues how much you've danced in the
[44:12] spirit
[44:13] it will be these mystery truths
[44:16] that will literally turn your heart back
[44:20] I think oftentimes the problem we have
[44:22] is people's hearts have never really
[44:24] been turned back they might have been
[44:26] turned back to a story or to an example
[44:28] or a good uh uh you know a good hunting
[44:30] or fishing story and I'm grateful for
[44:32] them I love all of them but unless your
[44:35] hearts turned back to the original faith
[44:39] your body will eventually follow where
[44:41] your heart is
[44:46] I want you to take notice this here as
[44:49] they walk along and he says you've got
[44:52] to see Elijah as gone Elisha you've got
[44:55] to realize that Elisha's away notice
[44:58] what brother Brandon begins to say here
[44:59] in this message why Christ speak you
[45:02] know so many times I went over this
[45:03] message and I don't normally do this but
[45:05] I listen to this tape probably my
[45:07] goodness over 30 times over and over and
[45:10] over and over and just wrote something
[45:11] different each time I heard it and the
[45:14] Holy Spirit was just dealing with my
[45:15] heart so personally
[45:17] and you know I thought of so many times
[45:19] as brother Brandon begins to say this
[45:21] here notice what he says may the Holy
[45:23] Spirit teach us today
[45:26] the things that we ought to know I got
[45:28] this here thank you
[45:30] May the Holy Spirit teach us
[45:34] today the things
[45:37] that we ought to know
[45:39] and may we then in return listen closely
[45:45] to every word
[45:48] and to weigh it deeply
[45:52] and then made those who are listening by
[45:54] the way of tape may they listen close
[45:58] and may we be able to catch what the
[46:02] holy spirit is trying to reveal to us
[46:07] you know I thought about this how many
[46:08] times I would hear Brother Branham over
[46:10] and over on tape and he would come to a
[46:12] crescendo he'd come to a moment and he
[46:15] would say now don't miss it
[46:18] don't miss it
[46:20] in other words you can miss it
[46:24] in other words you can miss what God's
[46:27] doing you can watch what's taking place
[46:29] and completely miss it
[46:33] may you listen close may you be in tune
[46:36] you know what this tells me the holy
[46:38] spirit is always trying to speak to you
[46:40] listen to me friends he's not just
[46:42] trying to speak to you uh you know here
[46:44] in church but all through the day all
[46:46] through your week all through the
[46:47] morning all through the evening the Holy
[46:49] Ghost has something he wants to say to
[46:52] you and I say God don't let me miss it
[46:54] this morning don't let me be distracted
[46:56] God I want to catch what the Holy Ghost
[46:59] is trying to say
[47:02] for we realize if he should anoint us
[47:04] then the anointing is not in vain
[47:10] that it might work to the good to the
[47:13] Lord
[47:14] we spoke on it last night what is an
[47:16] anointing it's the smearing or rubbing
[47:18] it's this transfer I almost preached
[47:21] this morning entitled this message the
[47:22] transfer of anointing
[47:25] because it was so important
[47:27] that what Elijah had Elisha caught
[47:31] there must of necessity been a passing
[47:34] on now they wasn't going to replace
[47:36] Elijah he wasn't going to replace his
[47:38] ministry it wasn't going to redo
[47:40] everything that Elijah did
[47:42] God had more work and a commission for
[47:44] Elisha to fulfill and he must recognize
[47:48] what the Holy Spirit was trying to do in
[47:52] his life
[47:54] may we be able to catch it Lord
[47:57] for we realize if he should anoint us
[48:00] then the anointing what is that
[48:02] anointing as we spoke last night
[48:04] it's a purpose that God has
[48:06] it must be passed down
[48:10] it's not a funny feeling the
[48:11] charismatics use it as a word like a
[48:13] catchphrase and a catch word of just an
[48:16] anointing an anointing of the Holy Ghost
[48:18] and a great feeling I love great
[48:19] feelings I love I love when the Holy
[48:21] Ghost comes on my flesh I don't hardly
[48:23] know how anybody would ever criticize
[48:25] speaking in tongues it is one of the
[48:27] most powerful real Supernatural
[48:30] experiences I ever experienced in my
[48:32] life and every time I speak in tongues I
[48:34] thank God how could anybody ever
[48:36] criticize that is the closest thing I've
[48:39] ever came to heaven
[48:42] in my body that is
[48:44] but you let me say something friends an
[48:46] anointing is not just a feeling that you
[48:48] feel
[48:50] but it's a transfer of a promise it's a
[48:53] transfer don't you know what David says
[48:56] in the Psalms and he says I how
[48:58] beautiful it is for Brethren to dwell in
[49:01] together and unity it's like the
[49:04] anointing oil that flowed from Aaron's
[49:07] head down to his beard down his garments
[49:11] down onto the ground what was it that
[49:14] oil wasn't just going to stay on the
[49:16] head ship but it had to pass down to the
[49:19] urine which represented all of the
[49:21] families all friends the anointing of
[49:24] this hour isn't just for preachers it
[49:26] isn't just for teachers it's for the
[49:29] whole body to come under the same
[49:31] anointing I say God anoint our young
[49:33] people anoint-time musicians anoint our
[49:36] deacons anoint our laity anoint our
[49:38] mothers and our fathers our teenagers oh
[49:41] God let this anointing flow
[49:45] from the head
[49:47] all the way down through the
[49:50] this message is not a preacher's Revival
[49:53] hello somebody
[49:55] it's not an American Revival either it's
[49:58] a global move of the Holy Ghost
[50:00] and I just say I'm so glad to be a part
[50:03] of the anointing of the hour and what's
[50:05] God doing and I say God let me play My
[50:07] Position let me play my part oh God
[50:09] don't let me look to the left or to the
[50:11] right let me keep my feet firmly planted
[50:14] in Jordan
[50:16] let me catch it Lord
[50:18] and may our hearts and understanding be
[50:21] open Lord and he knows notice this here
[50:24] and he knows I love this how to do these
[50:27] things how to deal with man he knows
[50:30] what's in man
[50:34] you might think you know everything
[50:37] there is to know about you but only God
[50:41] knows everything inside of you you say
[50:43] how because he's the one who put it
[50:45] there
[50:47] and you may think I'm nothing and I'm
[50:49] nobody and I'll never be anything but
[50:50] listen to me friends if God planted
[50:52] something inside of you he takes a
[50:54] nobody and makes him a snow he takes a
[50:56] nobody makes him a somebody in Christ
[50:58] Jesus when you surrender and yield Your
[51:01] Vessel to the Holy Spirit
[51:03] only he knows what's in man you don't
[51:08] he knows him we only know from the
[51:12] intellectual side
[51:14] he knows what's really
[51:17] in the man
[51:19] Moses was born in this world and a
[51:22] gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a
[51:25] deliverer he was born with the equipment
[51:29] Hallelujah
[51:31] he was born with the equipment in him as
[51:35] every man that comes into the world is
[51:37] born with this equipment
[51:41] it's already in you
[51:45] we spend so much time looking for our
[51:47] answers externally when it's already
[51:49] right here inside of the seed that God
[51:52] has placed in you before the foundation
[51:54] of the world quit looking for your
[51:56] answers outside the answer lays in the
[51:59] seed
[52:03] do you realize that friends the answer
[52:05] lays in the seed
[52:07] show us the father it'll suffice us
[52:09] brother Brandon says everything that you
[52:11] have need of in this life's journey is
[52:14] already in the seat of God even the
[52:16] Rapture is down inside of the believer
[52:19] right now all it takes is an atmosphere
[52:21] of the Holy Ghost to anoint what God
[52:24] already placed in you
[52:28] great it's already there
[52:32] you don't need to try to pop it up you
[52:33] don't need to pump it up it's already
[52:35] there
[52:36] brother Benham says it was already
[52:38] inside of him he really knows what's in
[52:41] the boy Moses born and then he was
[52:44] afterwards he was brought to the place
[52:45] where he was anointed
[52:48] and notice the seed laying there with an
[52:51] intellectual conception with all the
[52:54] faith he was born to deliver this people
[52:55] yet it never came to life
[52:59] all of it down inside of him
[53:01] yet it never came to life
[53:05] until that light
[53:08] from the burning bush
[53:10] Ed burned burning bush flashed across it
[53:13] I love this until he's seen with his
[53:17] eyes until he seen not something he read
[53:19] about but something he's seen with his
[53:22] eyes something that spoke to him and he
[53:25] spoke back to it I say God give us that
[53:29] kind of experience in the Holy Spirit to
[53:31] where we have something we speak to and
[53:34] it speaks back to us something we
[53:36] commune with and it communes back to us
[53:39] not just a dead letter not just a story
[53:41] from yesterday but a real reality of the
[53:44] Lord Jesus made personal to you
[53:49] it's already inside of him listen to me
[53:53] friends if you could give the Holy Ghost
[53:55] to your children I promise you would
[53:59] if I had a big red button here and that
[54:01] bread butt when you pushed it was to
[54:03] give your children the baptism of the
[54:05] Holy Ghost I'd like to say we'd have a
[54:06] stampede a literal Life Church and
[54:08] everybody wouldn't want to be mashing
[54:10] and pushing that button if you could
[54:12] give them the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[54:14] you would I promise
[54:16] but God doesn't give you that
[54:18] opportunity God doesn't give you that
[54:19] power you say then what power do I have
[54:21] to do to fight the devil with bring them
[54:23] to church Freedom the word of God play
[54:26] the word of God create the right
[54:28] atmosphere and then put your faith in a
[54:31] seed that God has placed inside of their
[54:33] heart and when the anointed word of God
[54:35] flashes across that seed no devil in
[54:38] hell can stop it from coming forth in
[54:41] Jesus will say Lazarus come forth and
[54:43] they'll come up out of that grave I say
[54:45] it doesn't matter I don't even care if
[54:47] they're not in this service this morning
[54:49] you put your faith in a seed of God that
[54:52] God put before the foundation of the
[54:54] world and say God that's my promise
[54:56] that's my inheritance I'm going to stand
[54:59] on the word of God
[55:03] thank you
[55:05] I think any man or woman or boy or girl
[55:07] with an intellectual conception what
[55:10] they think the word is and so forth can
[55:12] never have a full Foundation stand until
[55:15] they have met that light
[55:22] that light that's in that picture of the
[55:25] pillar of fire it's a wonderful thing to
[55:27] have in your home it's much more
[55:28] wonderful when it actually goes into the
[55:30] hearts of your family
[55:33] and then it becomes their reality then
[55:35] it becomes their word then it becomes
[55:37] their Revival then it becomes their
[55:38] message
[55:41] and he says now hundreds and hundreds of
[55:43] years before God had said that Israel
[55:45] would sojourn and be mistreated in a
[55:47] strange country and would stay there 400
[55:49] years but God with a mighty hand would
[55:52] bring them out so you see with this
[55:53] Burning Bush just as we know is a man
[55:56] asked me a few moments ago about the
[55:59] coming and the Rapture now listen all he
[56:01] says this and we know
[56:03] we've lived the time out how many would
[56:05] say that's true it's got to be more true
[56:08] today than it ever was in 1963 we've
[56:10] lived the time out
[56:14] and we're notice the time of the Rapture
[56:18] is at hand
[56:20] and we're looking for a rapturing faith
[56:26] who was looking for a Rapture in faith
[56:28] brother Branham was looking for a
[56:29] Rapture and faith
[56:31] that can pull the church together
[56:35] give it some intellectual faith
[56:38] intellectual strength more understanding
[56:41] more more more you know more to do more
[56:44] missions work more to give more to gain
[56:47] no
[56:48] to give it some
[56:50] Supernatural strength
[56:55] I can change these bodies
[56:57] that we live in
[57:00] my body just said hey man
[57:05] that can give my body some
[57:09] Supernatural strength what was God's
[57:12] Prophet looking for rapturing Faith
[57:14] something that would take these bodies
[57:16] and change them back to young bodies
[57:18] again
[57:20] when we see a God that can raise the
[57:22] dead off the floor
[57:26] are out in the yard
[57:28] and bring him back to life again
[57:33] when we see a God who can raise the Dead
[57:38] and bring him back to life again
[57:42] when we see a God and present him before
[57:45] us when we see God who can take a cancer
[57:48] that's ate a man to a shadow
[57:50] and raise him up to a strong healthy man
[57:55] that
[57:57] what brother banham that
[58:01] ought to give us
[58:03] that ought to give Rapture in faith
[58:06] do you realize what he's saying here in
[58:09] other words he takes a man who is dead
[58:11] you tell me what is natural about a man
[58:14] who's dead that comes back to life and
[58:16] starts breathing again
[58:19] tell me what part of that dead man
[58:22] brought him back to life that he did
[58:25] himself
[58:28] hello somebody
[58:30] tell me a man who's eight with cancer
[58:32] tell me a man who's dead and tell me
[58:34] what part what effort what work what
[58:37] labor what works did they do to bring
[58:40] them back to to life again I tell you
[58:42] the same Grace that saves you and it's
[58:45] free and apart from anything that you've
[58:47] ever done is the same Grace that'll
[58:50] change your body one day it has to be
[58:53] something completely apart from me
[58:59] when we see a God who raises a man from
[59:02] the dead who takes a man who had cancer
[59:05] ate his body up to a shadow
[59:09] and can raise him up to a strong healthy
[59:13] man that ought to give rapturing Faith
[59:17] to the people
[59:20] you know we just had that happen I know
[59:22] that Supernatural things are taking
[59:23] place everywhere and if you're not baby
[59:25] if you're not privy to it I just want to
[59:27] tell you some of this testimony here
[59:29] today that even back home we just had
[59:31] something very Supernatural take place
[59:33] just a few months ago and and a very
[59:36] good friend of mine and many of you some
[59:38] of you may know him brother Travis
[59:40] Jackson is just my my closest buddy God
[59:42] gives you good friends in life and I'm
[59:44] thankful for good Godly friends brother
[59:46] Travis years and years before uh we had
[59:50] met him even as a young man he was he
[59:53] was searching for the the truth and he
[59:56] would he would even as a young 14 13 14
[59:58] year old boy would read his Bible and he
[1:00:01] would pray at night and even though his
[1:00:03] parents didn't know that and his mom and
[1:00:05] dad were raised in the Beaufort Baptist
[1:00:07] church and they they his dad was a
[1:00:09] deacon there at the Beaufort Baptist
[1:00:10] Church and good Godly Parents and good
[1:00:13] godly people raised in a very good home
[1:00:15] but his parents had became disillusioned
[1:00:18] as they would brother Donald would say
[1:00:19] to go to church and and the preacher
[1:00:22] would preach on the cross and then
[1:00:23] preach on repentance and preach on
[1:00:24] salvation and he says then you know
[1:00:26] somewhere in the middle of the sermon
[1:00:28] the deacons would take a breath smoke
[1:00:29] break outside and smoke a pack of
[1:00:31] cigarettes and just talk about things
[1:00:33] and they just messed with Donald's mind
[1:00:35] so much and he said I didn't I don't
[1:00:37] understand this is this is this has got
[1:00:39] to be wrong how can this be normal how
[1:00:42] could this be the the Church of the
[1:00:44] Living God
[1:00:45] go home that night and they would go to
[1:00:47] restaurants and someone would have a
[1:00:49] drink here and a drink there social
[1:00:50] drinking and it just he got so
[1:00:52] disillusioned and he completely left the
[1:00:55] church and and went home and just stayed
[1:00:57] at home and and didn't even know his
[1:00:58] children his children Travis at that
[1:01:00] time too young I didn't even know
[1:01:02] whether you know they even knew anything
[1:01:03] about the Lord accepted what they had
[1:01:05] taught them and and you know Travis is
[1:01:08] just going through his he just begins to
[1:01:10] get such a hunger and such a thirst for
[1:01:12] God and he would just read the book of
[1:01:15] Acts and he'd read through Poe's letters
[1:01:17] in the New Testament Church and
[1:01:19] he'd go to church and he'd go to his
[1:01:21] youth leader and he'd go to the local
[1:01:23] churches there in Beaufort and even at
[1:01:26] 17 years old he was sitting down with
[1:01:28] the youth pastor of a church there we
[1:01:30] have and he'd say now you know after the
[1:01:32] youth meeting said I just want to ask
[1:01:33] you you know I read about the
[1:01:35] supernatural God in the Bible that he's
[1:01:37] a God that that healed the sick and
[1:01:40] raised the dead and I read about Peter a
[1:01:42] silver you know a Peter and he would say
[1:01:44] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:01:48] I have
[1:01:50] unto you
[1:01:53] and then he said where's this God that
[1:01:55] we read about in the Bible and this this
[1:01:58] God of the Apostles that was moving and
[1:02:00] acting and there was Miracles and signs
[1:02:03] and wonders and I read about a real
[1:02:05] Risen Savior in their life and and the
[1:02:08] youth pastor said brother Travis He said
[1:02:09] you know that's wonderful things you you
[1:02:11] realize you see in the Bible and that's
[1:02:14] just something God did special for the
[1:02:16] church that God who had sun dry time
[1:02:18] spoke to the prophets and through the
[1:02:19] law is now again spoken in the last days
[1:02:21] through his son and and everything that
[1:02:24] Jesus wanted to say that we have it
[1:02:26] written in the Canon of the Bible and
[1:02:28] there's nothing else that we need and we
[1:02:29] all we need is the Bible and we don't
[1:02:31] need any of those kind all those things
[1:02:33] God only did and you know Travis those
[1:02:35] Miracles that you see that they don't
[1:02:37] happen like they did in the book of Acts
[1:02:39] and so he left that church he said that
[1:02:41] just didn't sound right he moved from
[1:02:42] that church and went to another church
[1:02:44] and he went to the pastor actually of
[1:02:46] that church pastor pretty much told him
[1:02:48] the same exact thing and he moves from
[1:02:49] there and goes to the mega church we
[1:02:51] have there are non-denominational
[1:02:52] Evangelical Church and he goes to the
[1:02:55] pastor Dallas Thea Theological Seminary
[1:02:57] train and he asked him the same question
[1:02:59] pulls out his Bible says where's the God
[1:03:01] we read about in the Bible that's a
[1:03:03] supernatural God you're wonderful people
[1:03:05] and you love the Lord I believe you're
[1:03:07] real Christians but why don't we see
[1:03:09] some of these things that God said in
[1:03:11] the Book of Joel I'll pour out my spirit
[1:03:13] upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:03:15] daughters will prophesy on your old
[1:03:16] mental dream dreams and your own mental
[1:03:18] dreams visions and we we see the book of
[1:03:20] Acts and the Bible says Jesus is the
[1:03:22] same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:26] you know that Pastor told him is a good
[1:03:28] man he told him well Travis that you
[1:03:30] have to understand and this was his
[1:03:32] exact words the apostolic age is over
[1:03:34] and the days of Miracles are passed
[1:03:37] now where have we heard that from isn't
[1:03:39] that exactly what they tried to tell
[1:03:40] brother Brandon
[1:03:43] you see if you if he's never been
[1:03:45] revealed to you personally you have one
[1:03:48] or two options you either explain it
[1:03:51] away or repent of it and say God give it
[1:03:54] to me I don't know why you haven't
[1:03:55] revealed you have one or two choices
[1:03:58] and pride will always take a man away
[1:04:00] further away from the word of God
[1:04:03] and he would say the same exact thing so
[1:04:05] I'd go from that church and go to
[1:04:06] another church and go to another church
[1:04:07] he was a church Hopper
[1:04:11] they finally came to one Church very
[1:04:13] last church he comes to is a Vineyard
[1:04:14] Church and it's they call it that it's a
[1:04:17] cool church and you just dress however
[1:04:18] you want and it's good people good good
[1:04:20] godly people there that love the Lord
[1:04:22] love their Bible and and he would go to
[1:04:25] that same Pastor there and and he's and
[1:04:27] he's searching for something he's
[1:04:28] looking for something he can't he can't
[1:04:31] find it even as a young man and and just
[1:04:34] you know maybe a month or two after that
[1:04:35] he goes to his mom's mom's claws on his
[1:04:38] phone with books and with some religious
[1:04:40] books he begins to read them and read
[1:04:42] them and he's pulling them off the shelf
[1:04:43] and he pulls a book off the shelf that
[1:04:46] didn't have a spine uh there and the
[1:04:48] book was tattered and they didn't have
[1:04:50] all the pages and was a little bit
[1:04:51] incomplete and he pulls it off the shelf
[1:04:54] and he takes it to his room and the book
[1:04:56] is called the acts of the prophet
[1:05:00] written by Perry green
[1:05:03] so he starts reading this book and he
[1:05:06] says oh my now here's a man this is a
[1:05:09] man who had the power of God in his life
[1:05:11] this is what I've been looking for my
[1:05:14] whole life
[1:05:15] he goes to his mom he said Mom where'd
[1:05:16] you get this book
[1:05:18] she looks at the bug looks at the sponge
[1:05:19] says I don't have a clue where I told to
[1:05:21] this day they don't know how in the
[1:05:22] world the book got there amongst many
[1:05:24] many other books don't know anything
[1:05:25] about the book so but she's so intrigued
[1:05:28] by it she takes that book to her work
[1:05:29] she's a secretary at a plumbing business
[1:05:32] at there at the front office and she's
[1:05:34] reading this book and reading through
[1:05:36] the acts of the prophet and then a man
[1:05:38] from our church comes to there and he
[1:05:40] happens to stop in the office and he
[1:05:42] looks at the secretary reading this book
[1:05:43] the acts of the prophet and he says
[1:05:46] ma'am can I ask you where'd you get that
[1:05:49] book
[1:05:50] and she said well uh uh I don't my son
[1:05:53] found it uh you know it's called the
[1:05:55] action he says yeah I know I know the
[1:05:57] book of Eric familiar she said really he
[1:05:59] said yeah my son found it in open my
[1:06:01] closet I don't we don't know how it got
[1:06:03] there but boy he sure does love it he
[1:06:04] said okay I'm gonna bring you something
[1:06:06] else back and he brings him he brings
[1:06:07] with the supernatural oh and jerkerson
[1:06:09] Supernatural books
[1:06:10] and he says if he liked that he's really
[1:06:13] gonna like this book
[1:06:15] so brother Travis begins to read it now
[1:06:17] whatever part he had it didn't have all
[1:06:19] of the books but he begins to read about
[1:06:22] this life of brother Burnham and you
[1:06:24] know brother Travis in his testimony if
[1:06:26] he was here today it's just a just a
[1:06:28] wonderful testimony that's been this has
[1:06:29] been maybe 15 years ago today and you
[1:06:32] say where's brother Travis's Faith at
[1:06:34] today well if it was a raging fire then
[1:06:37] now it's a burning flaming nuclear
[1:06:39] Inferno

[1:06:43] five minutes and you're going to hear
[1:06:44] about the Lord and you're going to hear
[1:06:45] about Jesus and you're going to hear
[1:06:47] about a god who's the same yesterday

[1:06:53] passion
[1:06:55] and he and he goes and he and he his mom
[1:06:57] he starts reading these books so brother
[1:06:59] Travis starts to ask everybody he sees

[1:13:17] 1949 what cancer is
[1:13:21] you ever read the book it's parentheses
[1:13:23] it's called healing
[1:13:24] and I had been studying that my entire
[1:13:27] message was drawn around that and so I I
[1:13:30] was able just to take everything that
[1:13:32] I'd been studying and and I go there
[1:13:34] already you know they're on the way with
[1:13:36] Travis and I me and Travis are just
[1:13:38] talking I said well you know brother
[1:13:39] Travis God's a god of miraculous we know
[1:13:41] that he's a supernatural God and we
[1:13:43] don't really know what we're coming into
[1:13:45] but let's go in there so we go into this
[1:13:46] man's house and we knock on the door and
[1:13:49] his wife comes to the door and we go up
[1:13:51] the stairs lead it into his home there
[1:13:52] and just a wonderful uh uh uh man and
[1:13:56] woman there and there's another family
[1:13:57] from his church a trustee and she had
[1:14:00] lost her son to brain cancer when he was
[1:14:02] 13 that woman did and so she's a real
[1:14:04] Advocate there and there and you could
[1:14:06] walk into the room and you could
[1:14:08] immediately just feel there's Marcus
[1:14:09] sitting there and here's this man that I
[1:14:11] had seen that was so healthy and so
[1:14:14] strong and and now he's just so weak and
[1:14:17] he's and he's and he's just it you can
[1:14:19] tell his entire life had been sapped
[1:14:21] away from him and and he and he and he
[1:14:24] was you know just his entire just didn't
[1:14:26] even look the same and he had a tumor
[1:14:28] about the size of a grapefruit on his
[1:14:30] neck and uh maybe you could advance to
[1:14:32] that slide 15 if you can do that and
[1:14:35] just click to it if you could and Marcus
[1:14:37] is sitting there and he's and he's just
[1:14:39] got a tumor about the size of a
[1:14:41] grapefruit on his neck and there he is
[1:14:43] just sitting there and and it just was
[1:14:46] so terrible and and he's there he is on
[1:14:48] his living room chair
[1:14:49] and the next picture there if you go to
[1:14:52] the next slide you can tell just the
[1:14:54] cancer in his body and you can feel the
[1:14:57] atmosphere when we've walked in that
[1:14:58] room it was just an atmosphere of death
[1:15:02] you know he had completely given up on
[1:15:04] himself and couldn't have any faith for
[1:15:06] himself at all we started testifying you
[1:15:09] know later on in that testimony start
[1:15:11] testifying and I started testifying
[1:15:13] about a little woman who was diagnosed
[1:15:15] slide 10 with the same exact disease and
[1:15:18] I testified to his wife about little
[1:15:20] sister Elena butts and I began to tell
[1:15:23] them I said you know I have a friend
[1:15:24] also who was diagnosed with the same
[1:15:27] exact thing stage four Non-Hodgkin's
[1:15:30] lymphoma and the doctors had completely
[1:15:32] given up on the sister and and she was
[1:15:35] dying they said diagnosed with the same
[1:15:36] exact disease I said yes and she was
[1:15:38] diagnosed with the same exact trouble
[1:15:39] had been given up on him you know I
[1:15:42] thought it was so powerful I begin just
[1:15:44] to read the testimony even myself not
[1:15:47] fully knowing it and I went back to the
[1:15:49] sisters of post that she made on
[1:15:51] Facebook and I began to read her
[1:15:53] testimony and I just want to share it
[1:15:55] with you if that'd be okay this morning
[1:15:56] she says a week before Christmas I was
[1:15:59] diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin's
[1:16:01] lymphoma and two days after Christmas I
[1:16:03] started the first of 12 chemo treatments
[1:16:06] they told me that they told me that
[1:16:09] after four treatments they would do a
[1:16:11] pet scan to see how my body is
[1:16:13] responding I believe God Is A Healer and
[1:16:17] I've told anyone who asks how I'm doing
[1:16:19] I told them I was looking to him and
[1:16:23] believed he would kill me on Sunday I
[1:16:26] leaped and danced before the Lord with
[1:16:28] joy and victory because I knew it was
[1:16:31] already a finished work
[1:16:37] even though I didn't have edit and know
[1:16:41] or have any proof of it yet
[1:16:45] you say what was her proof a pet scan
[1:16:47] that showed she was full of cancer
[1:16:50] she says I leaped and danced before the
[1:16:52] Lord and she says I knew it was already
[1:16:54] a finished work you mean sometimes
[1:16:56] brother man you have to do something
[1:16:58] naturally in order for there to be a
[1:17:01] supernatural consequence hello somebody
[1:17:04] they were singing what have I to dread
[1:17:08] what have I to fear
[1:17:12] leaning on the
[1:17:15] Everlasting Arms
[1:17:21] I have blessedness
[1:17:23] with my Lord so near leaning on the
[1:17:27] Everlasting Arms that might sound
[1:17:29] strange to many but in the Bible Mariam
[1:17:31] Dance for Joy when she crossed the Red
[1:17:34] Sea and the Egyptians who had plagued
[1:17:37] and enslaved her were drowned David
[1:17:39] danced before the Lord when the Ark of
[1:17:41] the Covenant was brought back to
[1:17:42] Jerusalem it's an expression of extreme
[1:17:45] joy and victory I knew my healing would
[1:17:48] come sooner or later I want to tell you
[1:17:51] what the sister writes and you've got
[1:17:53] the card there before you she writes
[1:17:55] this down declare war
[1:17:58] own the devil
[1:18:01] no retreat lay hold on eternal life oh I
[1:18:06] hope they would anoint somebody's Faith
[1:18:08] here tonight maybe you have a child
[1:18:10] that's not even in this service let me
[1:18:12] tell you what you ought to do you want
[1:18:14] to declare war on the devil you might
[1:18:17] have just came into a battle and you say
[1:18:19] how did this ever happen to me I say
[1:18:21] declare war on your enemy no retreat no
[1:18:26] return no no turning back
[1:18:30] oh
[1:18:32] this little sister began to dance before
[1:18:34] the Lord I got a slide there and the
[1:18:36] next one there she says I begin to dance
[1:18:39] before the Lord David danced for Joy
[1:18:41] it's an expression straight expression
[1:18:43] of extreme joy I knew my healing would
[1:18:47] come sooner or later because the Jesus
[1:18:50] of the Bible is the same Jesus I have
[1:18:54] served for 27 years
[1:19:00] you say brother map what does it mean it
[1:19:02] means sometimes you do something
[1:19:04] naturally I know no one likes to get in
[1:19:06] the flesh but sometimes you gotta get
[1:19:08] into the flesh before it drops down into
[1:19:11] your soul and everything real move of
[1:19:13] God always starts in your flesh whether
[1:19:15] it's in your mind or in your heart or in
[1:19:18] your body you know why did Brother
[1:19:20] Branham when he's with banks Woods throw
[1:19:22] a rock up into the air and that rock
[1:19:24] when it went into the air the prophet
[1:19:25] said Disturbed the atmosphere and it
[1:19:28] started a little Whirlwind and when it
[1:19:30] landed it nearly sank Alaska
[1:19:34] why did Hattie Ray have to speak okay
[1:19:36] you say why did Jesus have to spit into
[1:19:38] the dirt
[1:19:39] ball up some mud and rub it upon why
[1:19:43] couldn't he just speak
[1:19:45] because the natural types spiritual
[1:19:49] why did name it have to dip not one time
[1:19:51] now why can't he just speak the word but
[1:19:54] sometimes God's looking he's a
[1:19:56] supernatural God
[1:19:58] and sometimes God's looking for it
[1:19:59] whether it's a decision that you make
[1:20:02] in your life
[1:20:04] firm decision you don't realize
[1:20:07] sometimes how powerful it is just
[1:20:10] standing up for the truth
[1:20:16] this is her pet scan one on your left
[1:20:20] full of cancer one on your right
[1:20:23] completely cancer
[1:20:25] free
[1:20:34] yesterday I had my pet scan in the day I
[1:20:36] met with a doctor before my fifth
[1:20:37] treatment he informed me that my cancer
[1:20:39] has already gone I had a seven
[1:20:42] centimeter tuber in my lung and multiple
[1:20:44] lymph nodes that were affected in the
[1:20:45] picture you'll see the before and the
[1:20:47] after the second is totally clear
[1:20:53] you think God's dead
[1:20:55] you think that the anointing that was on
[1:20:57] God's Prophet you think that that same
[1:20:58] Jesus who stood before the pulpit and
[1:21:01] the angel of the Lord would come to the
[1:21:02] platform and begin to discern the hearts
[1:21:04] of of people and and miracles would take
[1:21:07] place do you think that's yesterday and
[1:21:09] that's only yesterday I say today
[1:21:10] friends if all hell is cut loose and I
[1:21:13] say Oh Heaven is ready to pour itself
[1:21:17] out upon the living bride of Jesus
[1:21:19] Christ
[1:21:20] there's more for you than what you've
[1:21:23] received I say today if you've got a
[1:21:25] Hunger for More there's more of God for
[1:21:27] you to receive if you've got something
[1:21:29] inside of your soul it says Lord I'm
[1:21:31] thirsty for a living God and I say today
[1:21:34] God can feel you and refill you with the
[1:21:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:41] Hallelujah giving praise this morning
[1:21:44] he's worthy of all of our praise
[1:21:48] Hallelujah
[1:21:51] begin to testify to that that little
[1:21:54] woman there that wife of Mary
[1:21:57] and here was Marcus go two slides I can
[1:22:00] advance it now that's fine
[1:22:02] here's Marcus
[1:22:04] you know he had completely given up on
[1:22:06] himself
[1:22:09] starts to tell us the story and
[1:22:12] it was just so terrible you know
[1:22:14] sometimes it's so easy to have faith for
[1:22:16] others
[1:22:17] but it's so hard to have faith for
[1:22:19] yourself
[1:22:22] sometimes it's so hard to have faith for
[1:22:25] other people's kids but it's so hard to
[1:22:27] have faith for your own
[1:22:29] sometimes it's so hard to have faith
[1:22:31] that's so easy to believe for another
[1:22:33] person but when it comes to yourself and
[1:22:36] your layers of layers of Oppression and
[1:22:39] that demon Spirit has got you down and
[1:22:41] got you smothered under and you're
[1:22:43] trying so hard to be positive and you're
[1:22:46] trying so hard and you're just trying to
[1:22:48] come up like that little muddly brother
[1:22:50] random tails and she was buried
[1:22:52] underneath all of the mud sometimes it's
[1:22:54] so hard but I just want to preach to you
[1:22:56] here today and say just even a little
[1:22:59] voice I don't care how small it is I
[1:23:01] don't care if it's just a hand that
[1:23:03] would raise up to God and say God I
[1:23:05] don't care what I'm going through or
[1:23:07] what's facing me today I'm a believer
[1:23:09] I'm going to believe your word I'm going
[1:23:12] to confess your promises oh God
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:15] I say speak to that doubt that's around
[1:23:18] you
[1:23:19] and it was so hard for him to have faith
[1:23:22] he had completely given up on himself
[1:23:28] brother Travis begins to testify to him
[1:23:31] he says what's the pro what what's the
[1:23:33] prognosis Marcus says well it's a it's
[1:23:35] completely hopeless
[1:23:37] and he says it's just completely
[1:23:38] hopeless he says Travis I didn't want to
[1:23:40] die this way but they've tried chemo
[1:23:42] eight times
[1:23:44] failed all eight times
[1:23:46] they sent me home and said it's make
[1:23:48] your make your you know your life ready
[1:23:49] you maybe maybe I think they gave him I
[1:23:52] think it was two to four months if I'm
[1:23:53] not mistaken two to four months to live
[1:23:55] cancer had completely ate in this man's
[1:23:59] body from his head it started uh it
[1:24:01] started in his neck and moved all the
[1:24:03] way down to his body into his eyes on a
[1:24:06] normal pet scan you can actually see a
[1:24:08] black spot there for your heart for your
[1:24:11] lungs for your kidneys you can't see any
[1:24:13] organs there the cancer is completely
[1:24:16] ate up his body went from his neck to
[1:24:18] his eyeballs down his shoulders he said
[1:24:20] I have apple sized tumors on my calves
[1:24:23] right now
[1:24:25] completely ate a man to a shadow
[1:24:30] and he said I didn't want to die this
[1:24:32] way but you know it's important unto man
[1:24:34] wants to and he says I just I you know
[1:24:36] he said I I we've tried everything and
[1:24:38] it was a real Spirit of just an
[1:24:39] atmosphere and so Travis just says he
[1:24:42] says well Marcus he says you know he
[1:24:44] says I figure it's so do such such a
[1:24:47] bleak report and he said and there's no
[1:24:49] hope he said I just he said I get I
[1:24:52] think because of you know the
[1:24:53] circumstance he said ah I just got to be
[1:24:55] really really honest with you and he
[1:24:58] said what I'm going to say he said I'm
[1:24:59] just going to cut straight to the Chase
[1:25:01] and he said I'm going to cut straight to
[1:25:03] the point he said I don't believe it's
[1:25:04] any time to mince words he said it's now
[1:25:06] or never so I'm just going to tell you
[1:25:08] when I came to your church I was looking
[1:25:10] for the truth and he says and I want to
[1:25:12] tell you Marcus that Living God is not
[1:25:15] in your church not in your denomination
[1:25:16] he's not in your dead Creed of Trinity
[1:25:18] of gods he's not three coexistent
[1:25:21] co-eternal persons revealed in one he's
[1:25:23] one god Jehovah is his name and you're
[1:25:26] the doctrine of the Trinity is a
[1:25:28] doctrine of devils and denominations or
[1:25:30] of the devil they're spoke of in the
[1:25:32] Book of Revelations but I want to tell
[1:25:34] you Marcus that God is a real living God
[1:25:36] he's a God who can still heal he's a God
[1:25:38] who can still speak he's a god who's
[1:25:40] still speaking who still reveals himself
[1:25:43] and and the full word of the of the
[1:25:45] Apostles has been restored back to a
[1:25:48] church it's been restored back to a
[1:25:50] people and God has revealed himself
[1:25:52] through a messenger of the end time and
[1:25:54] God once again has appeared in the flesh
[1:25:56] and the son of man has once again
[1:25:58] appeared and he's made himself known
[1:26:02] and that same Apostolic blessing and
[1:26:04] promises that was promised to that first
[1:26:06] church I was searching for that God when
[1:26:08] I came to your church and I want to tell
[1:26:10] you Marcus I have found the truth of the
[1:26:13] Bible I have found the pearl of great
[1:26:15] price and you're wonderful people and I
[1:26:17] love you but I just want to tell you
[1:26:18] there's more of God for you to receive
[1:26:20] than what you've received
[1:26:25] and he's not in your doctrines he's not
[1:26:27] in the the Trinity he's telling him all
[1:26:29] this and I'm just thinking oh my God
[1:26:33] I mean talking about double barrel
[1:26:35] shotgun
[1:26:38] full choke I mean he just
[1:26:40] and I'm thinking my goodness Travis
[1:26:43] didn't know you say that it's not in
[1:26:44] your he's not in your systems and Marcus
[1:26:46] the god the the your denominational
[1:26:48] system is dead and here's my friend Matt
[1:26:51] Now Matt go ahead
[1:27:00] if you knew brother Travis you'd know
[1:27:01] brother Travis has got one of the most
[1:27:03] sweetest Tender Hearts I've never heard
[1:27:05] a fly any minute such out of the
[1:27:07] sincerity the depth of his heart and
[1:27:10] he's bowed his head he said now Marcus
[1:27:12] he said I I sure hope I didn't offend
[1:27:14] you and he said I hope nothing I said
[1:27:16] hurt hurt your feelings he said I just
[1:27:18] want to be real with you that God's the
[1:27:20] god of the Bible and he still performs
[1:27:21] miracles
[1:27:23] and he's still the god of the
[1:27:24] supernatural he can heal you of that
[1:27:26] cancer
[1:27:27] and he said I hope I didn't offend you
[1:27:29] and I was sitting there and Marcus just
[1:27:31] bowed his head he said no Travis
[1:27:33] he said in fact nothing that you said
[1:27:35] offended me and he said and I'll tell
[1:27:37] you why he said when you and your friend
[1:27:39] her knocked on the door he said an
[1:27:41] audible voice spoke and said these are
[1:27:43] men sent from God hear what they have to
[1:27:46] say
[1:27:52] Jesus said take no thought for what
[1:27:54] you'll say
[1:27:55] God works on both ends
[1:27:59] now either that was a devil that spoke
[1:28:02] to him or that was the angel of the Lord
[1:28:04] that spoke to his heart I asked you
[1:28:06] which one was it
[1:28:08] either that was a devil from the pits of
[1:28:10] hell and we had nothing but deception
[1:28:12] and evil to give him or God had sent us
[1:28:15] as barrier as bearers and carriers of
[1:28:18] the light of the End Time Gospel
[1:28:21] you think God would back up a lie you
[1:28:23] think God would stand behind and speak
[1:28:24] to a man like that who was dead with
[1:28:26] cancer and he's going to get behind a
[1:28:28] lie or some deception listen to me
[1:28:30] friends this thing is real
[1:28:32] this thing is their living reality
[1:28:34] listen to me friends this is not a dead
[1:28:37] book and a dead letter it's a living
[1:28:39] organism it's a living life it hasn't
[1:28:42] lost its power
[1:28:48] I begin to testify to that little
[1:28:51] that's sister and you know all I did
[1:28:54] through that is I began to speak I just
[1:28:56] took everything brother Barnum had said
[1:28:58] out of that book and I began to tell him
[1:29:00] I said now Marcus that cancer that's in
[1:29:03] your body that's a life that's a real
[1:29:06] living life of a demon Spirit that's
[1:29:09] trying to rob and suck the life out of
[1:29:11] you and if it can it'll suck the very
[1:29:13] life of you and kill you now I said
[1:29:15] Marcus now God heals through doctors and
[1:29:17] heals through medicine and if he could
[1:29:18] take or chemotherapy or some treatment
[1:29:21] that you've taken and if they could
[1:29:22] scrape out every last licking every last
[1:29:24] part of that cancer then wonderful
[1:29:26] that's how God God can use that for
[1:29:28] healing but they've given up on you
[1:29:30] you've tried it eight times and they
[1:29:31] haven't you say brother Matt do you
[1:29:33] believe in doctors I do brother Brandon
[1:29:35] said that the supernatural was when
[1:29:37] doctors couldn't help anymore that's
[1:29:40] when Divine Healing Supernatural healing
[1:29:43] steps in
[1:29:46] and so you go as far as you can and so
[1:29:49] so I said now that life that's living on
[1:29:51] you I said I got to tell you that tumor
[1:29:53] that I see that's just the body just
[1:29:56] like I've got a body and I've got a
[1:29:57] spirit but inside me is the soul the
[1:29:59] real life that's the real me and I said
[1:30:01] down on the inside of you inside of that
[1:30:03] tumor I said now the doctors with their
[1:30:05] tool bag they'll work on you with all of
[1:30:07] their tools I said I got to tell you I
[1:30:09] have no tools here in my bag uh to work
[1:30:11] on that tumor but I do got a bag full of
[1:30:13] promises out of the word of God and I
[1:30:16] said I'm going to pray over you and I'm
[1:30:17] going to curse the life of that demon
[1:30:20] spirit and I said that's a that's a
[1:30:22] spirit you've got to recognize that's a
[1:30:25] spirit call it what it is Jesus in Mark
[1:30:27] chapter nine when he speaks to that man
[1:30:30] who was deaf and he was dead he was lame
[1:30:32] and Jesus when he speaks to him in Mark
[1:30:34] 9 he says Thou foul spirit
[1:30:38] thou death spirit
[1:30:42] come out of the man and don't enter him
[1:30:45] again
[1:30:47] and I said I'm going to speak to Mary
[1:30:48] says that's the truth she began to weep
[1:30:51] she said I've been in church my whole
[1:30:53] life she says I've never heard it said
[1:30:55] that way but now that you say it that's
[1:30:56] exactly what the Bible teaches
[1:31:00] and I said I want to share with you
[1:31:01] about a little woman I began to show her
[1:31:03] marriage sister Elena's pet scans and
[1:31:06] you can just feel the atmosphere change
[1:31:08] you know it takes an atmosphere
[1:31:11] the right atmosphere
[1:31:15] it takes an atmosphere of faith and you
[1:31:17] could feel that atmosphere come into
[1:31:19] that little living room
[1:31:20] and Marcus begin to just weep and Mary
[1:31:23] begin to weep and I said I'm going to
[1:31:25] pray over you and I'll never forget
[1:31:26] laying my hands on him as we gathered
[1:31:28] there with that family from his church
[1:31:30] and we just begin to call upon God and I
[1:31:33] said Lord Jesus is Hezekiah was given to
[1:31:35] death sentence over his life and told he
[1:31:37] was going to die but he came and
[1:31:39] approached you and and he pleaded with
[1:31:41] you God and you added more years to his
[1:31:43] life so remember your servant here this
[1:31:46] man God who stood for you and preached
[1:31:48] your gospel from uh in this country and
[1:31:51] other countries would you remember
[1:31:52] Marcus oh God and give him more years to
[1:31:55] his life
[1:31:57] we curse that demon spirit that was upon
[1:31:59] him and you know what we did
[1:32:02] we left it there
[1:32:06] sometimes that's all you've got to do
[1:32:09] we left that living room told them
[1:32:12] goodbye walked out walked out the door
[1:32:14] and I said Travis we've taken our
[1:32:16] burdens to the Lord now our job is over
[1:32:17] what the Lord wanted us to do is finish
[1:32:20] there's nothing else to do we've left it
[1:32:22] with the Lord we waited didn't really
[1:32:24] hear from them for months went by
[1:32:26] and maybe I think it was I forget how
[1:32:29] many maybe three months if I'm not
[1:32:30] mistaken
[1:32:31] just so happens
[1:32:34] brother Travis is in my home and my
[1:32:36] living room and he's there on the couch
[1:32:38] and we're just talking about work we're
[1:32:39] talking about different things and and
[1:32:41] he's just going through something and
[1:32:42] I'm talking he gets a text on his phone
[1:32:44] and he pulls out his phone and I watch
[1:32:46] his eyes as I get about this big
[1:32:48] and he says Matt it's a text from Mary
[1:32:51] and he reads the text praised the
[1:32:54] supernatural Living God Marcus has been
[1:32:57] supernaturally healed of stage four
[1:32:59] Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma there's no cancer
[1:33:02] left in his body all you want to praise
[1:33:06] the Living God this morning I say Jesus
[1:33:09] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:12] and your faith might be weak today God
[1:33:15] can energize your faith and say I
[1:33:17] believe in God I'm a Believer in your
[1:33:19] word nothing's impossible for a risen
[1:33:22] savior he's the same yesterday today and
[1:33:26] forever what God did to a little woman
[1:33:29] in Louisiana gone upon the faith of a
[1:33:32] believer in South Carolina

[1:33:51] this morning maybe they're here right at
[1:33:53] your seat and right beside you and
[1:33:55] inside your heart you're worried and
[1:33:57] you're wondering and you're praying and
[1:33:58] you're distressed over that situation I
[1:34:01] say take the same faith that saved you
[1:34:03] and apply it to that unsaved loved one
[1:34:05] and say God the same a light that's
[1:34:08] shining in my soul may it shine and
[1:34:11] break past the barriers of doubt and
[1:34:13] unbelief
[1:34:14] may it break past Every Chain you know
[1:34:17] there is a man in the Bible who couldn't
[1:34:19] get to Jesus he couldn't get to the Lord
[1:34:21] he was dead he was laying there laying
[1:34:23] on his bed but the Bible says that his
[1:34:25] friends picked up his bed
[1:34:29] and carried him to Jesus
[1:34:32] and you know the Bible says that when
[1:34:34] they got to Jesus he was surrounded by
[1:34:36] people and crowds of people and little
[1:34:38] HUD there but you know what the faith of
[1:34:40] those friends wasn't going to stop at
[1:34:42] the crowds they actually climbed up on
[1:34:44] the roof
[1:34:46] and they ripped the roof off and they
[1:34:49] lowered the man down to Jesus and Jesus
[1:34:51] Says by your faith this man's made whole
[1:34:56] you see him in the map what does that
[1:34:58] mean I say today say God I am tearing
[1:35:01] the roof off I am lowering them down to
[1:35:04] you Lord Jesus I can't help them men
[1:35:07] can't help them they can't help
[1:35:09] themselves but I believe in a Jesus
[1:35:11] who's the same God who spoke the world
[1:35:13] into existence oh how many believers do
[1:35:16] we have here today that'll say God I'm
[1:35:18] taking my faith and I'm lowering that
[1:35:21] person
[1:35:26] Satan you might have tried to snatch
[1:35:28] them and snare them away but Jesus said
[1:35:30] all the father has given me will come to
[1:35:33] me they're in my hands I won't lose one
[1:35:36] of them I say oh hell can't stop a seed
