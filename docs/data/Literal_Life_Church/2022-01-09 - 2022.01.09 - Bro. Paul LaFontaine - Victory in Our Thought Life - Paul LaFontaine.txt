========================================

first three verses and uh just continue this on because i believe there's some good things in here and there will be choir practice this afternoon at three and then they have a little birthday cake for solomon after the service you're welcome to that god bless you each one we're going to read from psalms chapter one are you glad to be a christian today glad to be a believer boy that song pretty much said all we believe didn't it we won't let the enemy know we believe it with all of our hearts we believe it amen blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and his in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper i say amen to that second corinthians chapter 10 will be a verse related to the subject this morning second corinthians chapter 10 and we'll just add this in to bring us into the channel of the thought ii corinthians chapter 10 and verse 5. casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought every thought what a christian life bringing into captivity every thought how many have has a lot of thoughts come to you how many know some of them aren't of god bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ i can't do that for you i don't even think the lord does that for you you in submission you do this you bring into captivity every thought so there might be a lot of things we don't have control over in this world but i believe a christian has control over his thoughts to direct his thoughts by the holy ghost within him father bless your word today as we speak on this may it minister and lord you do beyond way what a human can do way beyond it lord when your holy spirit is present and lord we believe you're here today we have sensed your presence and we know that you have something that you had in your mind for us no matter if someone that's here always or a visitor you have their life in your mind lord and you know what's needed right at this time more than a preacher knows you know so i pray as we yield ourselves and the people yield themselves something will happen supernaturally because we know that you're a supernatural god bless every heart that's come and we commit everything that's said in your name in jesus name amen amen god bless you shake somebody's hand as you're seated and god bless you all this morning now psalms chapter one has turned into a bit of a series here and i didn't expect that but it did and it's about where the believer positions himself it's really about that in three verses that really speaks of where a believer posits himself himself so that he can have perfect faith and that he can live a prosperous life spiritually he can live a life that's um before god and we found on wednesday night that the first thing that he does is he he positions himself away from the influences of ungodly counsel away from the influence of the way of sinners and away from sitting in the seat of the scornful so it's specific things that we talked about wednesday night if you want to hear it i'm sure that they have it there where it's specific so that's that's the first thing is a believer has to position himself away from certain influences if he doesn't he can't live in victory if she doesn't she can't live in victory if you're not willing to separate yourself from wrong things and the seed of the scornful and all these things we mentioned that you're then you're really not willing to live in full victory so you have to be willing to do that and so he positions himself and brother branham speaks at length about a believer's separation from not only the things of the world but separation from doubters separation from influence separation from what you read that's wrong separation from wrong type of television he speaks at length about the believer is a life of separation why does he do that does he do it to make us weird or strange or different no that's in psalms 1 a believer has to separate himself from certain things in order to live in victory abraham separated himself from all of his kindred even because he had to get to the promise of god so now when we separate ourselves that's only the first step but that's not all we find more here that if you sanctify and separate yourself it's it's there's something about it that when you separate and sanctify yourself for the lord you have to fill your life with something else how many knows the scripture jesus said uh the spirits in a man and in a vessel in a house and then they're cleaned out and if that man doesn't get filled then seven other demons come and fill him because there's another process there's another step to be filled with the holy ghost can you say amen you may sanctify your life and separate this but if you don't replace it with something else then you're going to be weak again and jesus even says other demons will come back so we learned that's something that's throughout the bible that a believer can't just separate himself from things of the world but he has to be filling himself with the right things be filled that's why you have terms in the bible like be filled with the spirit walk in the spirit receive ye the holy ghost he gave the holy ghost to them that obey him on the day of pentecost brother brehm says they emptied out for 10 days they emptied out everything and when they emptied out they prayed and the holy spirit came and filled them it's not good enough just to empty out you have to be filled with something else can i get a greater amen than that that's the truth brothers and sisters and anybody is under those rules any of human beings are under those rules you can sanctify your life to the max but unless you're exposing yourself to the word of god and feeding on the word of god and saying lord fill me with your spirit and keep me filled with your spirit so this man in psalms 1 if we look at it he's a blessed man of god blessed is the man he's blessed and it says first of all that his delight is in the law of the lord so we find something that that this is a passion this is something that he gives his life to his passion and his delight is in the word he's not only separated himself from other influences but his passion his thrust his attention his desire is to be filled with the word and to stay in the word can you say amen and so above anything else the word is his passion it's his delight i'm going to linger on this a bit because we know we have sometimes where people it's it's it's a duty but it's not a delight in this man it's not a duty to be in the word it's his delight and if it's not that to you to you all you have to say lord deal with my heart because i want it to be a delight i want it to be a passion and to this fellow here he's blessed because his passion and delight is in the word it's above anything else the word is exciting to him is the word exciting to you it's exciting to him he can't wait to hear the word he can't wait to get to church david was this kind of person about the word because he said i was glad when they came and told me let's go to the house of the lord the the chariot is outside waiting it's time to go to church it's the set time at 11 o'clock what 10 30 whatever it is and david said something rose in me when they came and told me the chariot's ready the the the the the car is outside it's warmed up ready to go and when they said it's time to go something rose up and says i was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the lord it wasn't a duty it was a delight it's exciting to them can't wait to get to church can't wait to open his bible and read it can't wait to have time to get into his word this and i want you to catch this point because we'll go into this a little bit more this is at a desire level on the inside of this man and if a desire level is at the soul level this is at a soul level that this is coming from remember the little story when brother brown is talking to the little rippling and the bubbling uh brook of the bubbling spring and he starts talking to it and says why do you why are you so happy why are you bubbling well it's not me it's something way down in the deep deep on the inside it's bubbling it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soul there's something way down deep where it's coming from it's not intellectual knowledge it's not a duty it's a passion it's a desire and it's at a soul level praise the lord so now i want to make some statements here so so at this this this believer or this sister i should say this is not a duty it's a delight this is not grievous this is enjoyable and paul says the commandments of god are not grievous to us this is not grievous this is enjoyable this is not i have to this is i get to come on now say amen this is not i have to do this this is i get to do this big difference can you say amen this is not a pressure this is a passion this is not a drudgery this is a desire this is not someone telling you to do it or you need it this is your soul telling you that you want it big difference it's at a desire level it's at a soul level but you see now it's not just reading it it's not just his passion is for it but as he takes it to the next thing he says his delight is in the law of the lord but he so loves it that in this law in the word he doth meditate day and night so it's not just that he has the desire it's not just he has a passion for the word of god it's not just that it's this this uh something's consuming him on the inside but he takes it further because he he takes this word and he lets it be lodged in his mind and in his thoughts if somebody says i'm meditating on this day and night as much as i can i'm going to meditate on his word that's somebody that's saying i want his word to not just invade my soul but i want his word to invade my thought life and i want to tell you that's deeper than just a desire in the soul that's why i titled this this morning victory in our thought life how many want a victory in your thought life that's this that's the secret place you can put on a lot of things at church but nobody knows what your thought life is only you and god and the devil can plant thoughts there he doesn't know the secrets of the thought secrets of her god does so it's you and god so so i can preach about this today but i don't know what your thought life is now i can watch your life and there's enough evidence to show what you think about most is gonna come out it's gonna you know it's not like it's here and then it comes and it spills out of your mouth eventually so you can tell what people are thinking because the bible says whatsoever a man thinketh in his heart so is he and so you'll see eventually but really nobody knows what you're thinking even right now maybe you're thinking of lunch already but i want to tell you put that out of your mind because this is your true lunch first this has to be your lunch how many is glad to be at lunch today amen we're glad you made the trip but we got to get into it a little bit we say lord feed me feed me feed me feed me in my soul so now this fella he's he's getting it lodged in his mind he he lives a life that he has to switch out his thoughts always back to the word he meditates day and night so he he if he's a human being he has other thoughts he has wrong thoughts he has a lot of things hitting him but he has learned that he must meditate in the word because he has to live a life of switching out wrong thoughts and replacing it with the word and that's why i read to you bringing every thought captive into captivity bring every thought into captivity every thought not just letting other ones go through can you say amen not just letting all the other things just and some of them just slip through because they're not going to be scanned you know let me just say this um so the children maybe will understand all of us understand better after 911 our country changed and all the rules changed it changed everything can you say man and to elaborate on it it's because that all of a sudden now we thought we were safe and we thought we were okay but an enemy snuck in without us knowing it through our borders and we didn't know that it snuck in it snuck in with guns and actually stayed here for many years within the state among us and getting trained in a in pilot school without our own country all this happened and we did not know that it slipped in with a plan to not just be in our country there's a plan to do what it planned to do and all you know what it is if you children don't know they come they train to be pilots and then on 911 they took over the pilot in three airplanes and one of them was the plan was and listen friends satan has a plan satan has a plan when he gives you the wrong thoughts it's not just the thought he has a plan he's a planner can you say man that's why you have to be a planner so when these things come and he slips in they had a plan and that was to learn to be a pilot so they would take over the plane and redirect one plane into the twin towers in new york redirect another plane into the pentagon and then plans to redirect the third plane they think into the white house and destroy the white house that one didn't make it but look at the enemy's plan and look why it happened and after that day with however many people that died the country was torn apart how did this enemy get in but after that point everything had to change and our security level had to go up and and our airports and everywhere had to have scanners to scan everybody including me including you good people bad people people that's never done anything anything wrong their whole life every everything has to be scanned we didn't have that before i could just walk into the airport and go to my plane not anymore now i got to take my belt off and my shoes off and i got to lay everything up there take everything out of my pockets all this and every person has to do it can you say man why why did it happen because something slipped in i'm gonna tell you about your christian life okay let me tell you about your life okay i believe that every christian every christian will no doubt have a 9 11 that happens in their life you might have more than one if you don't learn your lesson in fact just so that our teenagers and our children can know how many would older ones that's been serving the lord how many has learned you've had a 911 in your life and what i mean by that is that the devil slipped in and got you and brought destruction because he slipped into something you wouldn't normally think he would have slipped in and how many raise your hand say it started in the thought life come on raise your hand appreciate you being honest so everybody's here has had a 911 and what it do it jolts you even as a christian that joseph said wait a minute i've got to put a higher security in place okay so we go through these airports and we have uh things that we have to do and we have to run uh people everybody no matter how good looking they are no matter how nice a suit they have on no matter how great a song leader he is how many thinks he's a good song leader no matter how good-looking he is taken from his dad i'm trying to put a good word for you buddy no matter the high standard that he lives and the christian life he lives no matter what when he comes to that airport he gets scanned like everybody else you understand and so now so gideon let's let's pretend now that this is the from here you're going to walk up here and you're going to walk through a scanner we're going to check you out and i want everybody to associate this if there's something notice now we don't know what he has on him so we have even though he says he's a good guy we have to check and see if he has anything on him because usually the devil's hiding something to slip through the security everybody listen typing what what i'm saying here this morning so now we need a security guard solomon you come and i want you to help me scan this fella because he's trying to come in he looks like a good guy and everything has to go out okay take your phone okay so everything looks good take your jacket off all right everything is confiscated so now as you walk up here okay a lot of times what happens as you walk up here as you walk up here you come through this scanner and it can be beep beep beep beep beep beep would you step back down there please all right check him out because there's something wrong there's something he's trying to get through pull something what do you have anything in your pocket that's what it is his shoes all right keys it was what's that let me see that okay and if we're talking about a thought sneaking through i'm going to call this the devil says the days of miracles are passed that thought doesn't come from god what are you doing with this and what are you trying to get for that thought doesn't belong in god and so we'll confiscate that and i can't believe you're trying to get through the kingdom of god with that thought in your mind come and try it again beep beep beep beep beep what is it what is it now check it now what is that what does he have anything else there what what is this mechanism this is a thought that says you're unworthy of the kingdom of god you've done things to feel unworthy that's the thought that didn't come from god and it can't make it through this scanner [Applause] one more time one more time okay bb what's this thought here huh give anything else in your pockets okay never mind don't do that what's this thought here this thought is bad movies don't affect me as a christian it only affects other people i can watch this i can listen to it and it doesn't affect me now solomon and gideon and i could go on with this all day long but i want an illustration to show you the bible says bringing every thought into captivity you have to have a scanner on your thought life if it's not of god it stops right there and it gets dumped out this guy's guilty put the cuffs on him get him out of here take his stuff this is what happens this is what you take this is what you should do with every thought that's not of god bring him into captivity take him to jail he's not making it through into the kingdom of god hurry up and do that i got a lot of sermon left solomon hurry up and do that thank you get him out of here every thought has to go through security isn't that what the bible is saying every thought has to go through security every actor has to leave the stage so i can preach good job guys thank you and that was unrehearsed by the way [Applause] so now this brother his thinking is directed his thought life is checked it's it's and then the bible says he has to meditate it on it on the word day and night so not only does he kick out wrong thoughts but he replaces them with the thoughts of god are you doing that day and night i want to put something in my mind i want to be filling my mind this is how you work as a human being this is how god created you can you say man and the devil's more aware of how your thought life influences you he's more aware than human beings we've got millions if not billions of human beings on the face of the earth that feed on things and they don't realize the power of the mind and the power of their thought life we have murderers in in jail can you say amen and it's because they didn't understand the principle of the power of a thought life and where it started is in the thought life nothing got checked can you say amen and so he focuses his mind on the word of god or on positive things and he dumps out and he scans the wrong thoughts that come through there are many things that this man may not be able to control in life things that happened to him things that other people did but he has control of what he thinks about and meditates on can you say man and there can be a good fruit that comes from someone who replaces their thoughts with the word of god and with positive things he has control of what he thinks about meditates on he says satan my thought life is my domain my thought life is my domain and you don't that's my territory is anybody listening this morning i know i know we may not and i appreciate it but i want you more than nodding morning saying amen i want to make sure that you understand and i'm not preaching to just unbelievers this morning preaching to mostly believers this is significant in your life you have to know that your thought life every day is your domain to take under the control of the holy spirit and satan does never ever belong there at all if you give him that territory he will take it but he needs to be scanned and checked at security every thought needs to be checked and i'm not talking about the person next to you i'm talking about you [Applause] some of you are defeated in your life because you haven't learned the one principle that what you think about every day is really going to influence who you are and your actions and that can be worldly thoughts that can be dirty thoughts or that can be depressing thoughts or that can be lies of the enemy or that can be things that are contrary to the word of god it can be anything but if it's not of god then we don't have to think about it i'm giving you permission today that you don't have to think about what you thought about this week and spent probably most of your week dwelling on a dominant thought and if it's not of god i'm giving you permission you did not need to spend 60 70 hours in your thought life this week thinking about that and letting that be your dominant thought the word gives you permission not me the word gives you let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus paul said forgetting those things which are behind it's not any more complicated than that the word gives you permission to forget those things are behind if it's under the blood which i believe with believers it's under the blood i have confessed it it's done and paul says forget all of it behind i give you permission a believer can forget because god's forgiven and for god he can't remember it no more so you don't have to remember god has a sea of forgetfulness you should have a sea of forgetfulness that you don't have to revisit a thought that's underneath the blood of jesus christ [Applause] what a waste of time what a waste where is it going to get you what a waste of time now i'm sensitive to the fact there are things that happen to us that it's hard to get out of our minds it doesn't happen overnight some things happen and it's just it's a part of our spirit it's a part of it and so it consumes us i understand that part of the human being but you can't stay there for years because god has god has something for you and i've preached this before that you cannot get to the glories of the future even as a believer if you're dwelling in the past you can never move forward if you're dwelling in the past in your thought life you can be trying to step forward in things but in your thought life you're in the past you can't move forward and satan knows that that's why he plagues you with the things of the past that's why he has a thought life that's he's trying to dominate because he knows you can't move forward but i give you permission you if it's under the blood you can forget that which is behind and press toward the mark of the high calling in christ and you deserve it because his blood has purchased you to press towards the high calling of christ you can't get there because of you he said you would get there he he purchased your journey all the way to glory is anybody getting something out of this this morning if i don't stay up here on these notes i won't get very far so now we see that with thoughts that we know come from satan and are not of god they must quickly be thrown out and replaced and i can't do that for you your mom and dad can't do that for you the deacons can't do that for you you have to refuse to let satan mess with your mind i just today if you if if you're hearing me because i i being a pastor privy to things through the years know that believers probably have the biggest battle and struggle in their thought life because satan's already got the unconverted mind he's already got their minds he owns it besides that through ai he he dominates through social media and everything he dominates people are like robots they've been taught by hollywood for years and they're only acting out because satan has the domain of their mind they lost it years ago but it's the believer who's trying to say i don't want to think wrong thoughts i want the thoughts of god that's the people that battle the hardest with the mind battle because if you start to get a hold of these things there's a victory and satan is defeated and he doesn't like that you have to refuse to let satan mess with your mind can you say man it's your domain and to mess with your identity and to put thoughts trying to change your identity and who you are people you know i don't know if it's the age i'm getting to but people are starting to see me associated with somebody else i walked into the y the other day and you know working out i'm with some of the older people i begin to wonder why am i in this age group now and i realize well you're in it because you're in it let's say you come up to me the other day and she says hey how you doing she acted as she knew me she how you doing you didn't you didn't want to bring janet to the y today [Music] i said no it was a little cold i didn't feel to bring her in with me i'm just beginning to wonder it's like who does she think i am satan's always messing with your identity he's always messing with your mind he's always misinterpreting the word to you even the word even the precious word the message satan will use quotes against you so that's why we have to be careful there's only one person qualified to handle and to live this word and that's the holy ghost that wrote it and so if that thought of that quote is not originating by the holy ghost you need to scan it and be careful because the satan may be using the bible and using a quote to defeat you and if it's defeating you it's not right because we're not called to defeat my brother and sister we are not called to live an everyday life of defeat we are called to live in victory [Applause] every one of you are called to live in victory over the enemy every day we may not do it every day but it's not because of god but we're called to live in victory every day you're called to live in victory every day especially over your thought life so i'm going to go back to the beginning now what i mentioned that it's when we are born again and when we see the word of god it's at a soul level and but we know when we have been taught that this begins the journey because two parts of us the spirit and the body are not regenerated so god through the new birth of the holy ghost has dealt with you at a soul level and there's something that keeps coming up to me in the last few years how i viewed the message i've always i've never had a a bad uh perception of why god sent this i thank god for that but i understand people sometimes who've been their thoughts have been twisted that they got a bad perception of brother branham in the message i never had a lot of that until i hear other people talk about it but but something's been coming up and how important it is to see this message and what it was really sent for because if you stand back and look at it you can never get a negative reason why this message came through a prophet in the last days you can never conclude on a negative reason you can't humanize it even though there's a human part of it of the man definitely a human part but i think of john the baptist there was a man sent from god whose name was john the baptist he was a flesh human being he made mistakes he was a fleshy me but god sent him and so we have to separate that so now when we look at the message there's something that keeps popping up in my mind that it's important for people to see this message and what it was really sent for and i can summarize for you god needed to speak his thoughts to his sons and daughters of god in the last days are you with me god needed to come down and for one purpose one main purpose and that's to speak directly and intimately with his sons and daughters of god in the last days and and and and give them the order for them to come to full restoration and full victory in the last days because the prophecy is shall come to full victory you talk about a victory the ultimate victory of the rapture i like that one can you say man that's what sons will come to at the last days that's what the bible says you talk about a victory a victory that this word will be so powerful and so consume us and in our minds and in our hearts until this body this body can no longer handle the revelation because it wasn't meant for all this revelation that finally this body gives up and you go to your new word body that can handle all of it and that'll be a victory someday when i step into that body but we can have some victories here in these bodies that's the miracle of the blood is it's powerful enough to bring a body that's completely unconverted never wants to serve god never wants to come to church never has a desire i'm talking about this body now never wants to line up never no no you don't want to do it it never will but the power of the holy ghost can bring an unconverted body under subjection and say buddy you're doing it because i want to glorify god in my life and your body's going to glorify god not the world not the devil not the kingdom of the enemy this body's gonna bring glory to almighty god even though you're not converted in the body pretty powerful can you say amen paul talks about the infirmity infirmity of this flesh this flesh is an infirmity it's like a sickness and it always will be but it's going to line up with the word whether it wants to or not and this is where we have victories about the thought life if you leave it alone it'll always wander off and if you leave it alone satan will plant more thoughts in your mind because it's not converted it's not converted so now we have some powerful things that we must look at in the level of the soul he's come but the message has come the message has come to bring the thoughts of god to his sons to bring them to full restoration and victory in the last days if you're listening today here or online the message the precious message of god has come the man has gone he's fulfilled his commission but god sent this message to breathe on his sons and daughters what they will need to know by revelation to come to full victory pours out to his sons in the last days revelations of who they are from the fall in the garden to to the godhead to predestination why is the last day's messengers elaborating messenger elaborating on all these points why does he have to go back and reveal the truth of what happened in the garden that it wasn't an apple and i said that's you know that's not a big deal it could have been an app no that's a big deal that we understands of god must understand what happened in the garden because we know what we're being restored back to the very reason jesus had to be virgin born shows it was sex in the garden this thing had to be reversed by a virgin birth without sex sons of god needed to know what happened in the garden because why it's going to bring their victory [Applause] that calvary will bring the power to put the devil under your feet and sons will say i am no longer under the fall of the first adam i am under the victory of the second adam jesus christ right now somebody ought to shout hallelujah i'll tell you not because of me but these truths the sons and daughters of god in the last days that's what the message was for it goes into predestination he goes into the seed of god said things we've never heard since the early church fathers if you were a son of god you didn't it wasn't one night at an altar you got saved you were saved in god's mind before the foundation of the world if you're a seed of god i had all my children my sons in me before they were even born and if that's true naturally it's true spiritually if you're a son and daughter of god here this morning you had to be in the loins of the father from the foundation of the world it's a truth it's a revelation and the sons needed to know i didn't get saved one night at an altar but god in his mind knew i would be saved sons of god sons of god and i could go on and on and how many conventions for the last 50 years have we shouted and i've enjoyed every moment building the faith of believers and sons and daughters god preached in this word predestination our position in christ preaching it preach until we rise to a place of faith but i find not very much is talked about in conventions and i say that respectfully about our thought life you can't just preach some of it you've got to preach the whole picture if sons are going to come to victory and you don't talk about everyday thought life they can't come to their full victory so you can be in a prayer line you can come through you can receive the holy spirit you can be delivered you can have the devils cast out of you but i just want to present to you what good would it do if you have a spirit and the power of the name of jesus and the church can cast out devils and that person hasn't learned that the same power that can cast the spirit off of you can be used in you to cast the devil out of your mind because you might go monday and the devil's plaguing you in your mind still the same name of jesus in the church can cast out casting down imaginations in every high thing that exalteth itself now you have things sometimes happening in the church and i think some of them happen because somebody's preaching all the wealth of the revelation to sons and their position but they're ignoring a very important message that god breathed on us as well the greatest battle ever fought why did he need to take a two or three hour message and and that's your homework this week i want everybody if you would to listen to it take your time meditate on it because god certainly breathed some things to us yet your battle is not one another your battle's not really with your wife not battles not with your husband or your teenager really when it comes down to it it shows a place in the beginning where the battleground people just like every nation choose where's the battle going to be what field it's going to be and he said it's going to be it's going to be from the garden of eden we know it's the mind because the first place satan got into is the mind of eve that's the battleground the chosen you didn't choose the background okay you would have told something different probably you didn't choose it but it was chosen back then and now i think when we come to the end time greatest battle ever thought had to be preached to sons and daughters of god because we have reached a place in our world in satan's eden that our minds are there is a there is the greatest competition for our thought life than has ever been before teenagers you're listening we live in the greatest time when satan is vying for your mind time what you think about and what images are put in front of you to think about later this is the worst so god knowing that he says i'm going to have to preach something very specific not just about predestination not about what happened in the garden not about there's no eternal hell not about the seed of god i'm going to give all that to them but i'm going to preach a message called the greatest battle ever fought and in that message i'm going to allow my prophet to expand upon you're a three-part being you have a spirit you have five inlets to the body of fine living that's to your spirit and if you're a christian and you let those areas if you ignore those areas and you don't stand as a soldier in those areas you will be defeated so god says i'm going to talk about it through my prophet oh it's wonderful so he begins to elaborate on something that i don't hear a lot of messages about even from me but what you think about every day is really turns out to be where you're at and where you stay i would love to have all of us me starting with me have this goal for the year of psalms one and two that i could just replace negative and thoughts of satan and meditate on the word of god my mind and my heart to be filled and when anything if i hear gossip or i hear something you know what we hear those things for one thing that we should be a prayer warrior and go to our knees in prayer say god i heard about this situation i heard about this person he even spoke against me but i can do two things i can just let it start why do they speak against me where'd they get that from well on sunday i'm going to get up and defend myself don't smile at me that's the way you think too you're thinking about revenge and you're thinking about all and really what a believer should do i heard it if it's another thing we look at is is it truth or is it a lie sometimes you don't know that right away but if somebody has been hurt or somebody has been sick or some word or somebody's gossiped our thing to do is think about it for a minute but then we're on our knees or we're before the lord wherever and we take it to the lord and we leave it there god bring deliverance if they're telling a lie god change let them see the truth and guess what we just we just freed up our thought life instead of losing sleep over it for five years we laugh but people can do it i will not allow that to cause me to lose sleep unless i wake up sometimes at three or four in the morning which is very really i know when i wake up then the lord's wanting to burden me with something burns are a different story what do you do with a burden though you don't lay awake and think how you're gonna figure it out you take it to the lord i'm gonna release this to the lord i get burdens for you mostly for this congregation someone will come in my mind four five six in the morning and for me to get up that early is very strange it's borderline sinful actually to me i just i mean there's a six o'clock in the morning like there is at night i don't know i didn't know that but well i know when i wake up and i have this person the congregation on my heart i know god's done something and so then i i go to prayer about it i do i'm not up here making myself spiritual i'm not a super spiritual person i just try i just try to live for the lord but i know the lord when he moves on my heart it's time to pray and then if i release it to the lord because i know have the power i can sometimes i can go back to sleep because i've given it to the lord sons of god got to learn friends you cannot let thoughts that are from satan dominate your thought life for days you don't have to [Music] jairus saying amen god pours out to his son's revelations of who they are in all rapturing faith to build the faith of sons victory faith perfect faith even bless us with specifics in the message how to love how to dress how to act as a christian how to treat one another as christians in the world how young people should not kiss before marriage taught us sons and daughters god taught sons of god what a beautiful woman is what is beauty in the eyes of god he taught you sisters what's beauty in the eyes of god and that that she didn't need the makeup and flaunting the outward looks in apparel god said you don't have to do that i'll tell you what beauty is i'll tell you what it is what is it it's god breathing on his sons and daughters because sons and daughters will come to a full victory i love it i love it you still with me but i just draw your attention to the greatest battle for a fault because for the first time he spends a lot of time he's mentioned those things before but he spends a lot of time on where satan will work even on a believer that's what he says in greatest battle even on a believer that the soul has been excuse me at the soul level satan has been sealed out but if the mind is open ground to the devil the devil will take it you can be have satan sealed out of your soul until the day of your redemption but if you open your mind to the wrong thoughts satan will take advantage so we're now through greatest battle ever fault where god is speaking to sons at the level of their mind at the level of their thought life at the level of memory imagination conscience effective reason god could have left that alone god could continue to talk about predestination you're a seed of god raising power praise the lord but no he didn't leave it alone because you would have to live another 50 60 years hopefully it's not anymore in a battle of your mind can you say man where you could be have god sealed in your soul and the devil sealed out of your soul at that level and still if you open your thought life to him you can live in defeat still if you feed on the wrong things you're going to live in defeat still if you watch the wrong movies and watch the wrong songs and listen to the wrong songs and watch and read the wrong things and your phone is dominating and all the social media if you if you fill your mind with those things no matter how much you feel you have a love of god you're gonna stay in a state of being defeated and god does not want you to be defeated he wants you to have power and control over your thought life so he wasn't just speaking at a soul level to his stuns and greatest battle or fault greatest battle and in the ministry that was calling a church back to casting out devils now he takes an entire message on the decision and the thought level he said why why was the mind chose and incidentally hit this 1962 and he's teaching sons that the the battleground that was chosen was your mind 1962 it's interesting that some of the writers christian writers are just now discovering uh what's the woman women preacher what's her name on the tv joyce wrote a book three or four years ago the battle in the mind this giggling just wrote a book talking about the thought life and the mind and that's where the battle is that's what he says that's where the battle is they're just discovering it late can you say man what god showed his prophet to give to his sons now that you can't just say i'm saved and i'm filled with the holy ghost and live an open-minded life to satan's thoughts can't do it can't do it doesn't work that way so he elaborates he talks about it and i'm just going to read a few just a few quotes for it before before we try to bring it to down a little bit today but in that message if god spoke to his sons through the message to give power for victory in their position then he is giving our victory in our thought life as well he's proclaiming there's a victory brother branham is so positive and so bold to draw soldiers to a place that if we would stand with the word of god and not let satan get a doubt in our mind about your healing the doubt in your mind about your restoration if we could stand as soldiers against what he's putting in our minds we can be a victorious people we could be a mighty army can you say man he's giving victory to our thought life greatest battle it's not listen now greatest battle ever fought if you listen to it this week it's not for the shallow feeling an emotionally based christian it's not for them it's winning the battle of the mind each day casting down every thought before i read some of the quotes in that message so familiar of story with you but it bears repeating i should have mentioned it wednesday night because i was talking about positioning yourself and he says nellie sanders gave her heart to the lord got an experience with the lord prophet meets her one day out and she said oh i've been so scarred by the world i'm not wearing makeup but i got the scars of wearing all that and doing all that i wish i looked like your wife they're so fresh they grew up in the church and he said she's saying i wish i was that you know and i'm also so scarred and brother brandt says well sister the blood of jesus christ cleanses us all from all of us from sin and from the past it's over you're christian a few months later you know she was a dancer she was later she's on her way down the street during the day towards the end of the day to go buy material to buy to to make dresses because she didn't have any so she's going down there and on the way up and up the stairs it's the old dance hall and she stops right there just to listen to it and you know what brother bram says that's where she got in trouble wednesday night i was on you don't stand in the way of sinners you're not going down the wave centers you're just standing watching wow what are they doing watching them on the internet where are they going what are they doing what are they wearing next let's stand there and watch the direction they're going there's another thing for you to watch she stopped and she said it won't hurt me just to listen just a little bit and she listened and she said i remember that song and she stopped she said he he said you shouldn't have stopped right there let me let me go ahead to the end of the story and then back up she comes that night later she's pounding out the door brother branham i failed i'm lost i've crossed the line oh i did this and he said what's wrong with you so why he talks to her he she tells him what he did and there's a spirit that comes out of her that becomes actually visible comes out of the back of her and it's a big bat-like creature with long hair and he said we've seen it come out of the background she was and rattling the door he had a friend there that he had brought home that was drunk to take care of him he sobered up real quick when that demon was in a room he ran to the other room no one messing with that so that's the end of the story he prays for her that she gets delivered from that spirit not possessed by it but a spirit come on here now you go back earlier in the day and you see she stopped there she listened a little bit it's not going to hurt you and then she found herself heading up the stairs and this is why she headed up the stairs everybody listening she reasoned in her mind she says i wonder if i went up there i could share the lord with them and witness to them what a religious nice thought but you're on the devil's ground so before she took that bat-like evil creature into her and if if if if you don't know that these things are real in the other dimension right now brother braham said they were here in the service he said angels of god are here right now and demons are here fighting and he says your faith determines which way that battle goes right now it's happening in this service right now that's why some of you get mad at me because i'm i'm touching on some demons that are trying to bother you that's why you get upset but if you only realize this is another battle in the other dimension but i've got the word i'm preaching that in the name of jesus christ i can drive away and cast out devils [Applause] but i want you to notice before that ugly spirit came on her it was in her thought process that opened her mind to get her on the dance floor the rest of the evening dancing around again and through the dancing she took on this ugly ugly-looking bat-like long-haired creature of a demon if you you are blind if you don't know those things are real i'll just let you know you'll know they're real if you catch yourself in tribulation because everything that we see in movies and all that we don't see in the dimension are going to be very visible come on now you believers you know that's true if you don't believe they're true and here right now you just wait along for tribulation and you're going to see how real they are they are real but before she had any of that on her or got delivered of that she just opened her mind and that's how the process started nelly sanders thanked the lord got delivered that night and the spirit went out and she was peaceful again but boy what a what a thing and why didn't why the brother bram take something from years ago and bring it up in greatest battle or fall because he's talking about your thought life he's teaching sons that your thought life every day matters your reasoning with the word of god say well this is all right and that's okay and i want and your dominant thought i want this more than i want more than anything more than the word more when counsel i'm going to get it i'm going for it you better watch your life because he will give you the fruits of your thoughts if you have a dominant thought you're going to get what you want but is it the will of god we human beings can make a dominant thought and we can accomplish what we want no matter if the whole entire world is against us but that's not god's path that's not god's way your thought life can convince you of things that are wrong and the word is the only thing that corrects it please excuse me for being straight with you this morning i feel heavy in my spirit that if you'll catch this every one of you we can live even a greater victorious life this week this week talking about you talking about me so he teaches us that satan tries to come in our imagination our affection our reasoning in this message he's working from the inside first the first quote says that's your battle he's talked about in ali sanders he says kill him at the beginning kill him at the beginning and stop him dead in his track it ain't how long you make the war linger it's stop it right now if you'll come and you'll keep the memories and conscience everything thinking about well i might fail it might not be right don't do that at all look at that thought i might fail it might not be right don't think that way dump that thought out you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say god your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet i can't fail because i'm taking your word there's the battle that's the thing talk about a place of power if the whole church goes awry i can't because i'm in the word and the word can't fail thus i can't fail the next quote says if you got your senses see taste feel smell and hear and they're all right they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imaginations conscious memories reasons and affection they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you blow a flu right quick see if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it that's right the engine if your memory if your imagination if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it the next quote he said the raging the battle rage when eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning that's the fluid come in that's the channel it run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes was sight excuse me her eyes was sight she saw the serpent he was beautiful he was handsome far better than her own husband he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband he looked like a great masculine beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and the first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings caught it why wouldn't that be a thrill it's not too far from the devil's thoughts to us today so he said we've got to be bold and be willing to take these things one thing at a time what's got to be done to live a victorious life okay it's this in my life we're going to tackle it with the word of god you may not be able to tackle all of it today but take it one thing at a time he gave a servant he gave an example of peter carthright going and he developed lead just felt led to go to a church and start a work so he goes to the city he gets ridiculed for it he buys this church and he's got to fix it up so he's what's next what's next what's next what's going to be done next we've got to get and wash the windows and get the church over so he's in there because he's got a commission to start a church and start preaching the gospel he's doing all this what's got to be done next i'm doing this because god told me to do it what's got to be done next i'm doing this because god told me to do it and then the town bowling says he knows doesn't he know that anybody that does anything in this town has to come through me big guy peter carthrice a little guy and so he says i'm going to go over there and talk to him so he's out there and he's washing the windows peter carthage and this big bully says what are you doing here i said i feel led to start a work of the lord i'm going to continue on goes right back to washing the windows didn't even worry how big this guy was and then this guy says you know have you heard that anybody who does anything in the city has got to go through me and peter carthage said okay if you're next then he goes over there and he rose up his sleeves he says if you're next then i'm coming after you and he tackled him down and said okay i took care of you what's next for the rest of that's the faith that we need that's the boldness that we need applying the faith of the word of god all right if i got to tackle you and beat you down i'll do you next and that's what you need to do if your imagination is not under control of the holy spirit this morning don't try to deal with all to say lord this week i'm taking my imagination and we're going to defeat satan using my imagination if your memory your past memories are haunting you says god i'm taking your word i'm going to read things about our memory and i'm going to read your word and i'm going to tackle this if this is next and then he says after peter carthage he looked like a great masculine beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell here what a great thing it was and the first thing she did now the next one there you are see it's take the word of god and cut your way through every doubt you see it sure that's it that's the next job that's peter crosby what's the next job let's get it done right next thing i'm i'm to do is to get away from my doubts cut it down that might be where you're at this morning the next thing you peter carth you say the next thing is my doubts brother brian says get to the place that you doubt your doubts next thing is get away from my doubts cut it down that's my next job is to get all my frustrations away anybody got any frustrations anybody got any frustrations brother brown mix flustered and you mix the two words together that's my next job is my frustrations might be your next job this morning if my senses tell me well you feel bad the next thing to do is to cut that thing away that's right praise the lord let me end this by saying whenever i get to preach again here in the next few weeks i think it's a couple services and then i agree but i would just we got to pick this up again is that okay with everybody now we got to pick up you put and replacing it with the word because really when we come to the the final thing when we come to the final thing the victory is beginning to open your mind more to the word of god dumping out the wrong thoughts in psalms 1 his delight is in the word and he meditates in it day and night he kicks out any wrong thoughts and replaces it with the word and brother brahm says in greatest battle god is calling every seed of abraham this morning to the same that same kind of life same kind of life as abraham great battle is on now worldwide god wants his children it's the last quote on there guys god wants his children separating themselves from what see taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memories reason affection he names them all everything open up their mind and let the word come in and march with the word that is a real soldier praise the lord get into these scriptures next time and god saw that the wickedness of man was great and earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually did you notice how the evilness and the acts of evilness were tied to the thought life that they couldn't think a good thought they couldn't think of pure thought anymore this thing is real it wasn't just they were doing evil in the days of noah it's that every imagination of their thoughts of the heart was evil continually psalms to the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all of his thoughts psalms 94 the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity emptiness nothing the thoughts of man you don't want the thoughts of man you want the thoughts of god jeremiah 6 says hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts you want it bad enough you think about it all the time god's going to give you the fruit of your thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words door unto my law but rejected notice it's in the thought life that they're coming down and that god says you're going to eat you want it so bad you're going to eat the fruit of your own thoughts psalms 19 though i hate vain thoughts david said i hate vain thoughts i'm going to say this morning i hate vain thoughts but thy law do i love search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts that's when you're inviting the light of his word into your thought life and saying there is nothing hidden from you there is a security checkpoint in my thoughts this week know my thoughts lord commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established romans 2 15 i was amazed at this scripture in the new testament because he's talking about the people who aren't jews that are receiving the holy ghost and he points to he says he says they got the law written in their hearts they don't even know the law but they're starting to live out the law even though they don't they've never known it paul says how does that happen it happens because they got the holy ghost the one who wrote the law in them and he says which show the work of the law written in their hearts and that has to be by the holy ghost show the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another because this is amazing because of the holy ghost in their hearts their thought life doesn't have to be ruled by the law there's something working in their thought life that actually their thoughts that meanwhile accusing yes here's the translation sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done wrong now we talked about a few weeks ago conviction the holy ghost will convict you and this makes them guilty and sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done right and this makes them not guilty that's all happening in the mind of a christian every day that he don't necessarily have to go get a quote god may speak through a quote but because the holy ghost is being able to take over the thought life can you say man the holy ghost will help you decide i'm not going to be under this guilty thought because it's not true this thought that come i did something wrong yesterday and i got i haven't brought it underneath the blood yet so then that's where i convict you says you're wrong you're guilty bring it underneath the blood that's all happening in the thought life of a believer i love that i'm ending i know i'm ending i promise you and sometimes their thoughts tell them sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done wrong and remember this is a holy ghost christian and this makes them guilty and sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done right and this makes them not guilty did you notice satan's not allowed in that whole thing at all only the holy ghost only the word and satan's not alone along there to say no wait a minute wait a minute i'll decide you're guilty you're wrong you're unworthy you'll never be anything greater he's not allowed in the thought life you're deciding by the holy ghost you're deciphering those things how many want to live a victorious thought life let's stand together and rejoice in the lord i want my thoughts i give my mind completely to you lord fill me with your thoughts the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind taking old thoughts past thoughts wrong thoughts and the way that we're changed constantly every day he says brother ben says now that you've been saved now that you've been filled with the holy ghost now he says let the thoughts of christ be in you and be transformed by the renewing of your mind i give my mind give my mind completely to you we're gonna pray in a minute speak to the lord just sing this song fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new and change my life yes lord let me live in all that's true you have to live in truth i just want to think like you singing again i get my mind [Music] yes lord jesus [Music] oh i just wanna think like [Music] teach me to [Music] me show me your [Music] perfect i give my mind to you fill me with your thoughts yes lord and make it all branded and changed my life let me live in all that's true [Music] i just want to think one more time take me lord make it your prayer this morning [Applause] take me [Music] teach me to please [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord i give you i give it to you lord jesus please [Music] fill me with your thoughts [Music] yes lord change me lord let me live in all that's true i just want to thank you like you if you bow your heads and pray with me this morning we had lord gave me that song years ago when we had a retreat [Music] and we had a theme at the retreat called our mind his thoughts it's our mind but it's his thoughts we want invading our thoughts and invading our life so once again i just asked you lift your hand this morning if you want to say i want to take this step of a greater victory in what's coming through this thought life every day i want to take this step and yield to the lord a little bit more let him have this domain let his thoughts fill it will you go so far and say i'm willing brother paul before the lord i'm willing to separate myself and pull back away from things that's filling my thoughts with wrong things maybe they're dirty things but maybe they're just negative things maybe they're consuming your time maybe they're okay but they just consume so much and you don't spend hardly any time in the word of god just raise your hand say help me help me lord help me to make those steps today lord nobody can do that for me i have to do it my wife can't do it for me my sons and daughters can't do it a pastor can't do it for me i have to make a decision and the reason that the battleground was chosen of the mind by the ramps is because decisions are made from the mind if god can deal with us at that level as sons i believe satan is really on the run satan is shaken in his boots to know that sons and daughters have control of their thought life what great victories lie ahead lord for these lives what great victories lie ahead for the bride she can surrender herself more in this realm that nobody sees in this realm that's hidden from everybody except you what great mighty supernatural things can be done in transformations when this bride begins to yield what she's thinking about every day help me as a pastor be an example lord nobody sees my thoughts either congregation can't see what i think about every day my wife can't see that may i set an example lord and say let every thought be brought into captivity [Music] scanning it through the scanner and make sure there's nothing there that's trying to get through security lord plant these things deep and richly in the hearts of the people i pray we commit so much to you lord everything is belongs to you today every life is important to you every soul no matter what 9 11's we've been through we learn from it we look at our 9 11's lord and we say [Music] you meant it for good you mean it for good because we learn we have to put a greater security on our thoughts forgive us if we make mistakes lord clean us wash us may we leave here different people today than we ever were before by your word we will prevail in jesus name thank you lord
