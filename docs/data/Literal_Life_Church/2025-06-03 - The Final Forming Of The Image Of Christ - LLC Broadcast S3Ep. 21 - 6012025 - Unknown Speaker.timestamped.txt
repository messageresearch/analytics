[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're

[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at
[0:20] literalife.urch. May God bless you, my
[0:22] friend. May the music and message
[0:24] encourage you.
[0:28] [Music]
[0:41] Oh, one more
[0:44] time.
[0:49] [Music]
[0:50] Oh, do it again. Sing it with us.
[0:54] [Music]
[1:00] Oh Lord, you know when I'm giving my all
[1:04] or when I give
[1:08] in. And you know when I'm trying, but my
[1:12] heart's not in it.
[1:18] I'm amazed by the grace that you have
[1:21] for me every
[1:24] [Music]
[1:25] day. How could I let myself give you
[1:29] less than my highest
[1:33] praise? I've seen what we've been
[1:37] through and how much I've been
[1:41] blessed by you.
[1:45] So I'll do my best to bring you glory.
[1:50] Give my all. Tell your story, praise you
[1:55] through the trials, showing you're worth
[1:58] it
[1:59] all. Amen. Oh, you have stepped into my
[2:05] fire. Call me
[2:07] upon the water. You have called me to
[2:13] higher. You gave your
[2:15] [Music]
[2:17] all. So I'll do my best.
[2:24] [Music]
[2:35] Oh, I will lift up my hands when the
[2:39] circumstance pulls me down.
[2:44] When the world tries to silence me, I
[2:47] will
[2:48] [Music]
[2:52] sing. I will turn up my praise in the
[2:55] face of my
[2:58] enemy.
[3:00] Amen. I will dance in my freedom even in
[3:07] captivity. Why? Because I've seen what
[3:10] we been through.
[3:13] and how much I've been
[3:16] blessed by
[3:19] you. So I'll do my best to bring you
[3:24] glory. Give my all to tell your story.
[3:29] Praise you through the trials. Show me
[3:33] you're worth it
[3:34] [Music]
[3:36] all. You have stepped into my fire. Hold
[3:42] me up on the water. You have called me
[3:47] to it higher. You gave your all. I'll do
[3:52] my best. So I'll do my best to bring
[3:56] your glory. Give my all to tell your
[4:01] story. Praise you through the triumph
[4:05] showing. You're worth it all.
[4:09] Oh, you have stepped into the
[4:14] fire
[4:15] upon the water. You
[4:19] have to higher. You gave your
[4:25] own. So I'll do my best.
[4:33] Oh, I'll do my best.
[4:41] Oh, I'll do my
[4:45] [Music]
[4:50] best. I'll do my
[4:57] [Music]
[5:00] best. Philippians chapter 3 um verse 20
[5:04] and 21. Verse 20 says, "For our
[5:07] conversation is in heaven." Some of
[5:10] these appear to be kind of deep things,
[5:11] but they're not really deep. Paul's
[5:13] trying to bring us something here.
[5:15] Conversation in the Bible usually means
[5:18] your manner of life. It's not just what
[5:19] you're saying. It's actually both. So,
[5:22] our manner of life and our conversation,
[5:25] our manner of life and also our words,
[5:28] our conversation, our manner of life is
[5:30] in heaven. So, it's in a different
[5:31] place. Even though we're here, our
[5:34] focus, our our our our bent, our our our
[5:37] manner of life is has a focus. It's not
[5:40] an earthly focus. It's a heavenly focus.
[5:43] So our conversation is in heaven from
[5:45] whence also we look for the Savior, the
[5:48] Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our
[5:51] vile body. So now here's the body
[5:53] change. who shall change our vile body
[5:55] that it may be fashioned or formed like
[5:59] unto his glorious body according to the
[6:02] working whereby he is able even to s
[6:04] subdue all things unto himself. So I
[6:07] want you to notice in two scriptures
[6:08] here before there's a body change before
[6:11] there's a rapture our focus and our
[6:14] place that we've come to has a heavenly
[6:16] focus already. So we come into this
[6:19] place before the body change and then
[6:21] the body change and while that's
[6:24] happening our bodies and our uh
[6:26] character is being formed like unto his
[6:30] glorious body. So I want you to keep
[6:32] that thought in mind and let's just add
[6:33] in 2 Corinthians chapter 3. But even
[6:37] unto this day when Moses is read the
[6:39] veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless,
[6:42] when it shall turn to the Lord, and it
[6:44] there he means Israel, when the nation
[6:46] of Israel, when they'll turn to the
[6:48] Lord, the veil shall be taken away. How
[6:50] important is it is to see the Lord, not
[6:53] just uh Bibles and words, and because
[6:57] the Jews were they had the words read to
[6:59] them, but because they had a veil, they
[7:01] couldn't see the word, right? But when
[7:03] they turned the the Lord of the Lord of
[7:06] it, and they met him personally, the
[7:08] veil gets taken away. Nevertheless,
[7:10] verse 16, when it shall turn to the
[7:12] Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now
[7:14] the Lord is that spirit, and where the
[7:16] spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty.
[7:19] But we all with open face beholding as
[7:22] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[7:25] changed. So it brings all of us in now.
[7:28] We're changed into the same image from
[7:31] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[7:34] the Lord. There's a quote from St.
[7:37] Martin. St. Martin was the church age
[7:41] messenger to the Ephesus murder Pergamus
[7:44] church age the third one and uh there's
[7:46] a quote I wanted to put up of him that
[7:48] is in relation to what we're speaking
[7:50] this morning I thought it was uh really
[7:52] amazing that he has this insight back
[7:55] then early on but he just says this St.
[7:58] Martin says, "Allow me, brothers, to
[8:00] look toward heaven rather than at
[8:03] earth." Allow me, brothers, to look
[8:05] toward heaven rather than at earth so
[8:07] that my spirit may set on the right
[8:10] course when the time comes for me to go
[8:13] on my journey to the Lord. I'm going to
[8:16] read it again. Allow me, brothers, to
[8:18] look toward heaven rather than on at the
[8:21] earth. So that it's he's he's expressing
[8:24] kind of like a prerequisite or a pre uh
[8:27] condition before the body change before
[8:29] the coming of the Lord. The condition is
[8:31] is that may I set my eyes and everything
[8:34] towards heaven and get it off the earth
[8:36] and get it towards heaven first so that
[8:38] my spirit is set in the right direction.
[8:41] How many this morning I'm going to bring
[8:42] it in our terms. How many this morning
[8:44] would love to have that rapturing faith
[8:47] to be raptured? You know the promise
[8:49] right now in front of us is the rapture.
[8:50] This is the coming of the Lord. And so I
[8:52] would want to know anything that the
[8:54] scripture brings me to set me in a place
[8:57] and in a condition to be ready and set
[9:00] in the right direction for the rapture.
[9:01] That's everything to me. It's not about
[9:03] making money. Can you say amen? It's not
[9:05] about all the things of earth. That's
[9:07] fine. Uh I think thank the Lord he's
[9:09] blessed us with a little funds to be
[9:10] able to pay our bills. But my focus is
[9:13] this promise. I want to get out of here.
[9:15] I want to see this rapture take place.
[9:17] We've been waiting for how long now? two
[9:19] 2,000 years that's been promised. And so
[9:22] I thought this was wonderful and I'll
[9:23] just bring it in our terms. In other
[9:25] words, what Martin is saying here is
[9:27] before the journey, he is coming into a
[9:29] certain place and that place that is
[9:32] setting him above earthly things, that
[9:36] place sets him in the faith for a body
[9:39] change. That's in my own words, words
[9:41] that we understand more because when he
[9:43] speaks of the coming of the Lord, then
[9:45] uh we know he's talking about a rapture
[9:48] and a body change. So, we keep looking
[9:50] at the one of my favorite chapters in
[9:52] the Bible is Psalms 27 because it is
[9:55] related to the conditions and the place
[9:58] that we're in before the rapture. Psalms
[10:00] 27. Let's read it
[10:02] together and we're going to break it
[10:04] down a little bit today. You got time
[10:06] with me? We're going to break down the
[10:08] conditions that surrounding the rapture
[10:09] in Psalms 27. So, it's all a secret.
[10:12] It's about a secret place. How many know
[10:14] the rapture is a secret? It's a secret
[10:16] catching away. So, all this becomes a
[10:18] secret. And there's actually a secret
[10:20] place of his pavilion that he hides us
[10:23] in. That's related to the rapture. No
[10:25] one will even see what's going on in
[10:27] this forming that's going on in this
[10:29] secret place. One day, we'll just be
[10:31] gone. But before we're gone, he has to
[10:34] hide us. He has to protect us. And what
[10:37] we learn in this place, if we'll get in
[10:39] it, we learn to overcome these
[10:41] conditions. And we learn to run and hide
[10:44] with him. The safest place to be is in
[10:47] that pavilion with him.
[10:51] And we learn to run to him. We learn to
[10:53] stay in that place with him because the
[10:55] conditions are too overwhelming for you.
[10:58] But this place is so powerful that we
[11:00] actually get two things. We overcome and
[11:02] live above the conditions
[11:05] and we're raptured out of the
[11:07] conditions.
[11:09] It's pretty powerful place. It's
[11:12] pointing us to a place Psalms 27. A
[11:14] position we get into for the rapture.
[11:16] Hiding and living above conditions. Hold
[11:18] that thought. Let me just say it this
[11:19] way. Isolated or more specifically
[11:22] insulated. Because we're not totally
[11:24] isolated from the conditions around us,
[11:27] but we can be insulated from it.
[11:29] spiritually insulated.
[11:32] I like that. So, it says in Psalms 27,
[11:35] "The Lord is my light, my salvation.
[11:37] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[11:39] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[11:41] afraid?" I'm going to read through it
[11:42] and then I'll come back and comment on
[11:43] the conditions. When the wicked, even my
[11:45] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[11:47] up my flesh. They stumbled and fell.
[11:50] Though, and host should encamp against
[11:51] me, my heart shall not fear. Though war
[11:53] should rise against me, in this will I
[11:55] be confident. One thing have I desired
[11:58] of the Lord, that will I seek after that
[11:59] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[12:01] the days of my talking about a dwelling
[12:03] place. Dwelling place. Can you say amen?
[12:05] To behold the beauty of the Lord, to
[12:06] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[12:08] of trouble, I did a series on the time
[12:10] of trouble. In the time of trouble,
[12:12] what's he going to do? In the time of
[12:14] trouble, fight back. Fight, fight,
[12:15] fight. No. In the time of trouble, he
[12:18] shall hide me.
[12:20] That's God's answer. Come on now. He'll
[12:22] hide me. Time of trouble, he'll hide me
[12:24] in his pavilion. In the secret of his
[12:25] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[12:27] set me up upon a rock. And now shall
[12:29] mine head be lifted above mine enemies
[12:31] round about me. Therefore will I notice
[12:33] this position. Now your head lifted up
[12:35] above your enemies, not below above.
[12:39] Therefore will I offer in this
[12:40] tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will
[12:42] sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the
[12:44] Lord. Hear, oh Lord, when I cry with my
[12:46] voice. Have mercy also upon me and
[12:48] answer me. When thou sayest, seek me ye
[12:50] my face. My heart said unto thee, thy
[12:52] face, Lord, will I seek. Hide not thy
[12:54] face far far from me. Put not thy
[12:57] servant away in anger that thou hast
[12:59] been my help. Leave me not, neither
[13:01] forsake me, oh God of my salvation. When
[13:03] my father and my mother forsake me, then
[13:05] the Lord will take them up. Teach me,
[13:07] take me up, teach me, oh Lord, and lead
[13:09] me in the plain path because of mine
[13:11] enemies. Deliver me not over the unto
[13:13] the will of mine enemies. For false
[13:15] witnesses are risen up against me, and
[13:17] such as breathe out cruelty. I have
[13:20] faded unless I believe to see the
[13:22] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[13:23] living. Wait on the Lord. Be of good
[13:26] courage and he shall strengthen thine
[13:28] heart. Wait, I say wait on the Lord. I
[13:32] love it. So now if we break this down,
[13:34] what's the conditions before rapture
[13:36] that we're under? First of all, in verse
[13:38] one, fear and being
[13:42] afraid. More extreme than any other
[13:44] thing taking over people's lives. And
[13:47] Jesus said it about the end time. Men's
[13:49] hearts shall fail them for
[13:52] fear. I'm amazed how many Christians
[13:55] sometimes making decisions and the
[13:58] motivation is not faith. It's based out
[14:01] of fear.
[14:02] They're afraid.
[14:05] They're even doing things of the Lord
[14:06] sometimes, but they're doing it. Are you
[14:09] listening?
[14:11] If you obey the commandments of the Lord
[14:14] out of fear,
[14:18] They must not be done out of fear. They
[14:20] must be done out of
[14:23] faith. But the whole generation is full
[14:25] of fear. Being afraid. I got to move on
[14:28] to the next one. Verse two. There are
[14:31] forces who are out to destroy the body.
[14:33] There are demon um demonic uh forces in
[14:36] the realm that bring physical attacks
[14:39] against our body. Sicknesses, diseases.
[14:41] They're increasing. And so in this
[14:44] generation, a great condition that
[14:46] challenges us and makes us discouraged
[14:50] is the attack from the enemy to eat up
[14:52] my flesh. In other words, that's an
[14:54] attack on your physical body.
[14:57] Okay? This condition of this time,
[15:00] always remember, always remember
[15:03] uh that it's the enemy that's doing
[15:05] that.
[15:07] It's some force that's against you.
[15:10] The doctor doesn't even know that.
[15:13] So, we appreciate doctors, but you have
[15:15] to realize that when we're under these
[15:17] conditions, if he can get you down
[15:18] physically, he discourages you when
[15:21] you're physically down and you're
[15:22] physically sick. He did it with Jesus
[15:25] when he was hungry, he attacked them at
[15:26] his weakest point. Now, we have more
[15:28] sickness than we've ever had. We have
[15:30] more migraines than we ever had. We have
[15:32] more sickness, more medicine, but more
[15:34] sickness than we've ever had. So, what
[15:36] is that? What is What is that? Science
[15:38] should have solved the problem already
[15:40] and we appreciate science. But why do we
[15:42] have more sickness? More medicine but
[15:44] more sickness. Why do we have that?
[15:46] Because of the conditions before
[15:48] rapture. This is the attack from the
[15:50] enemy.
[15:52] Can you say amen?
[15:54] So number three verse three. What's
[15:56] another condition? Though a host should
[15:58] encamp against me, my heart should not.
[15:59] So now it's about the heart. It's about
[16:01] your spirit. And though war should rise
[16:03] against me, in this way I be confident.
[16:06] So the feeling in your heart of feeling
[16:09] surrounded, feeling overwhelmed in your
[16:12] spirit, feeling overwhelmed in your
[16:14] mind, this is a condition that I think
[16:16] is even worse today. Mental illness is
[16:19] worse than physical illness today.
[16:23] And they say in mental and and uh and
[16:27] heart it it's it's something that it
[16:31] overwhelms the mind and it overwhelms
[16:33] the heart. spoke on it a few months ago.
[16:35] Jesus said, "Take heed to yourself that
[16:38] you're not overburdened by the cares of
[16:40] life." The the trade of this age is
[16:42] being over our minds are not meant to
[16:45] handle all this pressure
[16:48] and the minds are going mental because
[16:50] it's just it's it's like it feels like
[16:54] David said this feels like because
[16:56] remember David is speaking he's speaking
[16:59] about terms of being a warrior but he's
[17:01] saying what you'll feel like in your
[17:03] generation in rapture time he's
[17:05] prophesying you'll feel like you're
[17:07] sitting somewhere and there's a host in
[17:10] camped around you and you're surrounded
[17:12] by the devil and your mind feels that
[17:15] way. They tell me that a panic attack a
[17:17] panic attack is feeling overwhelmed and
[17:21] then it's all coming at you and it hits
[17:22] you all at once and you have a panic
[17:24] attack.
[17:27] There it is right there in the
[17:28] scripture. Feeling
[17:31] overwhelmed. Verse seven says, "I
[17:35] cried." Sometimes you're so bad that in
[17:39] this generation, you're crying out for
[17:41] God's mercy with a loud urge in your
[17:43] heart. You're just crying out. I won't
[17:46] ask for hands, but I know I've done it.
[17:48] Is that you're just crying out, God have
[17:50] mercy on the situation. God have mercy
[17:54] on this. God have mercy. There's a cry.
[17:57] We're crying sometimes in this journey
[17:58] because we're human beings.
[18:01] It's okay to cry. Can you say amen?
[18:04] Crying out for God's mercy. Verse nine,
[18:06] the feeling I want to elaborate on this
[18:09] one. Are you still with me a little
[18:11] bit? Verse nine, hide not thy face from
[18:14] me. Put not thy servant away in anger.
[18:17] Thou hast been a help. Leave me not,
[18:19] neither forsake me, oh God. Now, David
[18:21] addresses God. And he says, it's the
[18:24] feeling that God is angry with
[18:26] you, that he's turned away his face, and
[18:30] God has forsaken you.
[18:34] Now, let me ask this question. When I
[18:35] read that last
[18:37] night, is that true that God has
[18:41] forsaken you?
[18:45] That can't be true. That's right. Not to
[18:47] his elect, not to his sons and
[18:49] daughters. But the feeling, the feeling
[18:53] is that you feel he's turned his face
[18:56] away. He's angry with me and he's
[18:59] forsaken me.
[19:02] It's not true, but it's so real to you
[19:05] that you feel like God has forsaken you.
[19:09] God, I don't feel his presence. I don't
[19:11] think he's there. And often, and I try
[19:13] to be careful because people start
[19:14] blaming God for things and God's
[19:16] forsaken me and I've crossed the line.
[19:18] And I try to be careful because you have
[19:20] to have a care for their heart because
[19:21] they're feeling that. You can get them
[19:23] to admit, you know, that's not true that
[19:25] God's forsaken you. He doesn't forsake.
[19:27] I will. He says, "I will never leave
[19:29] thee or forsake thee." Right? That's
[19:32] what his word says. But the feeling of
[19:34] it is God has turned his anger towards
[19:37] me. God has forsaken me. Guess what?
[19:41] Jesus said it at the cross.
[19:45] In other words, he come into such a dark
[19:47] time and such a low, the spirit left him
[19:50] in the garden and he's there going to
[19:52] the cross according to what the prophecy
[19:54] said he would do. And it's so dark and
[19:57] he feels so distant from God that he
[19:59] cries out, "My God, my God, why have
[20:02] thou forsaken me?" Jesus felt that.
[20:06] Aren't you glad he felt that feeling?
[20:09] Our Lord felt like what it felt like
[20:12] that the father had forsaken him. But it
[20:15] wasn't true. The father was right there
[20:19] ready to fulfill his word. But he Jesus
[20:22] had to go through that so he would
[20:23] understand us when we go through this
[20:26] last days condition of feeling like
[20:28] we're forsaken by God. I've got to move
[20:30] on here now. But now we move to the next
[20:33] place and that's verse 10. And this is
[20:36] probably the one of the hardest ones.
[20:38] When my mother and my father forsake
[20:41] me. What a generation of a breakdown of
[20:44] families. The voice of the father to a
[20:46] son missing in this generation. All of
[20:49] his confidence is is is is uh formed by
[20:53] the approval of the father and you're
[20:56] not getting it because there's a
[20:57] breakdown of fathers then mothers that
[20:59] that woman she looks even to the voice
[21:01] of the father the approval of the father
[21:03] and generationally we're not getting it.
[21:06] So can I say something about this is
[21:08] that you can live your whole life being
[21:10] a victim that my parents didn't do me
[21:12] right. It's time to say, "Okay, we know
[21:15] that, but it's time to look to the
[21:17] victory of the future and not what your
[21:19] parents did." I preach to many people
[21:22] here that were raised the same way. But
[21:24] you know what? They're getting past
[21:25] their past. They're saying, "I can't
[21:26] dwell on that for 20 years. If you
[21:28] didn't have a good father, you have the
[21:31] heavenly father."
[21:34] And his voice speaks to you even this
[21:37] morning. Brings comfort, brings
[21:39] confidence. Amen. It's a breakdown of
[21:42] fathers and mothers. And he's saying
[21:43] that it's because the condition of the
[21:44] last days. When my father and mother,
[21:46] and that's that's a pretty close
[21:48] relationship breakdown. You can have a
[21:52] whole world forsake you, but when it's a
[21:54] father and mother, that affects us.
[21:56] Verse
[21:57] 11, teach me, oh Lord, lead me into the
[22:00] plain path. Well, I got to believe that
[22:01] the opposite of a plain path is a fuzzy
[22:04] path,
[22:06] unclear, a complicated path. That's the
[22:09] hour we live in. We got forces that have
[22:12] are distorting this message and
[22:14] distorting this
[22:16] Bible. Distorting this message to many
[22:18] people. It's the conditions for Satan to
[22:21] complicate things and take something
[22:22] simple and make it complicated. And
[22:25] that's why David cries, "Give me a plain
[22:28] path because everything's fuzzy right
[22:31] now. Deliver me over, not over to the
[22:34] will of mine enemies, for false
[22:36] witnesses are risen up against me, and
[22:37] such as breathe out cruelty. I know none
[22:40] of you have ever experienced any of
[22:41] this, but I'll preach it anyway. False
[22:43] witnesses that speak lies and words of
[22:46] cruelty and hurtful words to
[22:50] you. God, help me not to yield over to
[22:52] their will. Because you yield over to
[22:54] people who are saying hurtful words
[22:56] towards you. You wield over to their
[22:58] will under the pressure and you become
[23:00] controlled by their words. Somebody
[23:03] ought to say amen. For years, you're
[23:05] controlled by the hurtful words of
[23:06] somebody else. But we live in a day
[23:08] people are rough. People are hurtful.
[23:11] People are
[23:16] cruel. Pressure being controlled by
[23:18] them. In verse 13, the last one, I had
[23:21] fainted. It means fainting means you
[23:23] feel like giving up. But I don't know if
[23:26] you noticed that in all of those
[23:29] conditions of the end time and
[23:31] pre-rapture time, how first of all, how
[23:34] many raise your hands and say, "I've
[23:35] experienced all these."
[23:38] Yeah. Because this is a rapture chapter.
[23:41] That's what we deal with. But guess
[23:43] what? There are conditions that make us
[23:45] run into that secret place. They should.
[23:48] It should make us run away. The
[23:50] conditions, not the bride.
[23:53] It shouldn't make us more bitter. should
[23:55] make us better for the bride. These
[23:57] conditions, Satan's saying, "I got her.
[23:59] I got her. I'm I'm having her
[24:01] persecuted. I've got fear demons on
[24:04] them. I've got I'm I Their mind is they
[24:06] feel overwhelmed in their minds. I've
[24:08] got this. I'm going to discourage this
[24:10] bride." And Satan doesn't realize,
[24:12] buddy, it's going to backfire on one
[24:15] group of people. It's going to put them
[24:16] in a rapture someday. Somebody say,
[24:19] "Praise the Lord." It's going to
[24:21] backfire on you, devil.
[24:23] Put all you want to on the pressure on
[24:25] them, it's going to backfire on this
[24:28] bride. She is going to come out of it.
[24:31] Did you notice every time there's a
[24:33] symptom or there's a condition, there's
[24:35] a positive side to every condition,
[24:38] there's a victory. Number one, when
[24:41] there's fear and being afraid, the Lord
[24:42] is my light and my salvation. The Lord
[24:44] is the strength and my light. Number
[24:46] two, when the enemies surround him, even
[24:49] my enemies and my foes came upon me,
[24:51] eating my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
[24:53] God will make the enemies, the feelings
[24:56] are
[24:57] overwhelming, it'll make them stumble
[24:59] and fall.
[25:01] Verse three, though a host should encamp
[25:03] against me, my heart shall not fear.
[25:05] He'll drive away my fear. The war should
[25:07] arise against me. In this will I be
[25:10] confident. You know what God's going to
[25:11] give you through that feeling
[25:13] overwhelmed, and surrounded? He's going
[25:14] to give you more confidence.
[25:17] Every condition has a positive response
[25:21] to it.
[25:23] You know why? Because this bride always
[25:27] gets the victory because Christ is in
[25:30] charge. He'll always get the victory.
[25:36] Skip down to the other ones. Let me get
[25:39] the positive side real quick. And now uh
[25:42] no, verse uh seven. Oh here, oh Lord,
[25:44] when I cry my voice, have mercy on me
[25:46] and answer me. When thou sayest, seek my
[25:48] face, I seek, hide not thy face from me.
[25:50] When you when when it seems like God is
[25:52] forsaking you, he says, be my
[25:55] help. Uh when when my father and mother
[25:59] forsake me, what's the answer? Then the
[26:01] Lord will take me up. He'll be my
[26:03] father.
[26:05] Teach me, oh Lord, and lead me in the
[26:07] plain path because of my enemies.
[26:09] Deliver me not over the will of my
[26:11] enemies, for false witnesses are rising
[26:13] up against me, and such as breathe out
[26:15] cruelty. So deliver me not over to what?
[26:17] What's the positive? Here's the
[26:19] positive. Don't let me yield to their
[26:22] will.
[26:24] I want God's will. I don't not I don't
[26:26] want their will. And then I love this
[26:28] one. I had given up. I had fainted. And
[26:31] unless
[26:34] unless I had believed to see the
[26:37] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[26:39] living, there's a victory in every
[26:42] condition. Wait on the Lord. Be of good
[26:46] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[26:48] heart. Wait, I say wait on the Lord. Can
[26:52] you say, "Praise the Lord." So God turns
[26:55] the test to a testimony. That's right.
[27:00] God turns the loss into a liberty.
[27:04] God turns the lemons into lemonade.
[27:09] God turns the pressure into more
[27:11] potential.
[27:12] God turns the hurt into healing. God
[27:16] turns the panic into a promise. God
[27:19] turns the trouble into more trust.
[27:22] Oh, I should be getting more amens than
[27:24] that. He can turn a man of addiction
[27:27] into a man of conviction. Amen. Amen.
[27:34] God turns depression into possession.
[27:38] God turns mistakes into miracles.
[27:43] God turns confusion into confidence.
[27:47] God turns tribulation into jubilation.
[27:51] God turns problems into a position.
[27:55] God turns the rough days into a rapture
[28:03] because his
[28:04] people in these conditions are going to
[28:08] get the victory over it. Thank you for
