faithfulness [Music] [Music] [Applause] this is my high soul I save your God [Music] [Music] pray though [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman ye hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said in the servant we may either the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman knee shall not surely die for God doth know in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil I want you to notice the first thing that's happening here is a misinterpretation of the word but you can really technically call it a lie it's a lie even though there's 90 percent truth to it if it's got air in it this way and it's misinterpretation it's still called a lie and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the uh she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord walking God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God Among the Trees of the gardens and the Lord called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told me that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and that is instead of taking ownership and telling the truth himself because remember now the spirit of Lies is consuming everything now listen now they become Liars themselves he should have been answering yes I took of it and said now he's blaming his wife so nobody starts to answer truthfully because you're under the spirit of Lies now so now in in this and lies Spirit of Lies will never work in Oneness in relationships only the truth and he said who told me that that was naked verse 12 and the man said the woman thou gave us to me she gave me a tree and I did and the Lord said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat it's amazing if you look very deeply you can see that there are characteristics coming out that are so revealing of how broken relationships function today if we if we can be honest and we can see our fallen condition and the broken conditions that we live in today uh if we would just look honestly at that then we can see it back where it started at the beginning and not just to look honest and to be honest and to see we're in a fallen condition and uh we're in broken conditions with our families and there's such a a such a so many things we can talk about as far as broken families and broken relationships the hour that we live in I think it's a worse age that we've ever had for that and so but when we look at the beginning we can look and honestly see where our fallen condition came from and that also there is no way to get on the road to Redemption and restoration unless we are honest about the condition that we are in in Lester's repentance unless there's an acknowledgment of the condition that we're in first and that's why when the kingdom of God opened up in the book of Acts it began with repentance you'll never get into the channel or God's Redemptive power unless there's repentance first unless there's an acknowledgment of the condition that you're in and that I need help from God that I need help my relationships are broken I I'm at I'm at a lost here I don't know what to do unless there's a repentance and say Lord I need help you'll never find the path to Redemption but once you begin repenting and saying I acknowledge the condition I'm in I see it in the garden I see it now in my family I see where I've done I see what I've done wrong and when you begin to get in that kind of mode then you open yourself up to a great great power and The Road to Redemption and restoration and the only way we have that is through the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary that he made a way to redeem us back and to restore broken relationships not only with God but with one another as well let me Proclaim at the outset that whatever I say on relationships in your life that are in a still in a fallen condition if I get specific today and talk a little bit about things that make it uncomfortable for you let me say that whatever I talk to you about in the relationships in your life being maybe still in a fallen type condition no matter how ugly no matter how bad it is you need to know that however Fallen the power of redemption can come to Sons and Daughters of God and give them the right thing and restore the worst conditions and if we don't believe that we shouldn't even be at church this morning there is a power of redemption that comes from Calvary that has the power for every impossible situation every marriage that's broken every family that's broken anything that has been broken Calvary has the power to restore it's when you admit that you are in a mess and say I need you Lord I need you Lord right now that's what God needs and he didn't just need that 20 years ago when you came to the altar he needs that every day Paul said I Die daily to myself I Die daily I need the Lord more than I've ever needed him before and he needs you here that cry in your heart I need you Lord I'm crying out to you Lord this whole generation millions of people they don't need the lord they're not crying out but there's a bride that's crying out I need you Lord I need your blood but I need I need your blood to have power in it to change my life God wants you to hear that you need him God needs you to speak the truth God needs honest truthful confession not a religion not to just know it was the blood it's when true Redemption takes place that Redemption power kicks in it's when true repentance takes place that true repentance and fellowship kicks in so let's start to break this down first thing they both started to do is lie and the other thing they start to do is blame the other person that is a relationship that is not healthy and normal it's a fallen condition when you lie and when you blame other people and don't take personal responsibility for what you've done that is a fallen condition that's from your Fallen nature and you will act that way from a fallen nature never never is that within what Christ is trying to be in your life here and now when Adam and Eve listen to the die of the devil the holy image of God left them their Fellowship was broken with God The Fellowship of Oneness with God was broken the very minute they listened to the LIE of the devil that broke their Fellowship in the very minute that you listen to the LIE of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of God like she did is when you failed to take God's word just as it is so everybody understands the foundation to this Oneness message is to realize when you listen to the LIE of the enemy it breaks Oneness with God uh it breaks fellowship with God and it breaks fellowship and the minute you listen to the LIE the devil he says it'll break your fellowship so what's the thing that establishes Fellowship what's the thing that strengthens Fellowship your fellowship with God what's the thing that solidifies what's the thing that brings it back certainly we when we stay close to the word of God and we listen and obey the word of God and we're living on the word of God and not the LIE of the enemy not his interpretation of the word you can't have a solid marriage unless you live on truth and the truth comes out and you speak truth to one another anytime there's secrets in time of Secrets it breaks the fellowship anytime this little dabbling over here in adulterous pornographic things you don't even have to tell your wife you'll start to feel the the Oneness break and the wife starts to sense something's wrong and there's a break and there's a pride and there's there's uh he's getting more angry about stuff what's going on you break here with a fellowship with God you dabble in sin you break your Oneness with one another blaming as a result of the Fall it's not right it's not the christ-like way there's a young man in jail that said it's not my fault the other guys stole the stuff but they accused me the comedian Philip Wilson I remember this as a kid he used to say the devil made me do it so people blame other people they blame the devil and they blame God and you got a lot to you know you got a lot to blame there you know lots of people you blame God you can Blade the devil Flip Wilson said the devil made me do it the devil why'd you do that the devil made me do it that's not always good to shift the blame on him when you got to own up to what you did we blame fast food restaurants for making us fat we blame tobacco companies for giving us cancer we blame the church for our lack of spiritual growth we blame God for results of our poor choices oh God why is this happening to me we are in a culture we're blaming others for our failures happens all the time but how does God view this Blame Game could it be a form of idolatry where our feelings of Pride are elevated above any sense of responsibility we expect blame shifting from a child we expect it from a child how many has ever seen a child do that they're exposed it's it's there and they're still going to say Johnny Johnny did it he did it we expect children to act this way but not adults many adults never grow to mental and emotional maturity still blaming others for their mistakes grown-ups acting like children counselors call this blame shifting we come by this Blame Game honestly it's inherited sin I'm reading a lot of things that happen to us are the result of multiple multiple contributing factors and it can be caused by a mix of our own actions and those of other people for example if you were to hit a pothole in the road and fall off your bike it was probably partly due to the fact that the road has been poorly maintained but also that you were cycling too fast and not looking where you were going if that were you you might be ranting and raging about your taxes are spent on these roads now that one was just too close to home with me it's just too convicting I had to repent right here ranting and raging about what your taxes are spent on these days and or would accept the part that you played in it and vow to learn from your mistakes if you find yourself trying to pass the buck for every mistake you make then it's probably gotten you into trouble in the past especially if you try to shift the blame onto your partner your marriage partner family best friends or people you have to work closely with no matter how much people love us there's only a certain number of times people will tolerate taking the blame for something that genuinely genuinely wasn't their fault you're only going to do that so long it's going to catch up with you and I'm talking to all of us here you're going to do that for so long it's going to catch up with you because people aren't going to tolerate being blamed for your mistakes as well as weakening our relationship being unable to take responsibility for our mistakes can damage Us in other ways so now we have some reasons we blame others for our mistakes just so we we don't know sometimes the reasons why we do it you may have your own reasons but here's reasons why we choose to blame others for our mistakes all right number one to explain why something happened as humans it's our default to always look for something called it's our default to always look for the cause of something we like to have narratives that explain why things happen so that we can add these to our mental story of life rather than turning the light on ourselves or looking at the bigger picture and context we can explain things more quickly and easily by attributing them to others number two the reason why we blame others to attack someone Shifting the blame onto someone who is a subtle way to attack them we might do it so unconsciously but if we hold a grudge against someone for some reason perhaps we feel you've they've wronged us or blamed us in the past then if an opportunity to blame them presents itself it can be very tempting to take it blaming them for something is also a tactic we may use to hurt our partners whether we're aware of doing it or not number three why do we blame others it's a great defense mechanism Shifting the blame directly onto someone or something else is the perfect way to avoid having to reflect on your behavior or delve deeply into your uh psyche that way that way you can remain blissfully unaware of your own shortcomings which can help maintain a fragile Eagle number four it's easier that way to blame others why would we bother doing all the tricky self-analysis and taking steps to fix the situation if we can just take the blame off of our own shoulders and place it on someone else sometimes we convince ourselves that it's really someone's else's fault but sometimes we know we're lying but we often decide on the spur of the moment that it's easier to tell a lie than it is to deal with the consequences of Truth we learn to lie early on in life how many would say Amen we are taught to lie we learn to lie early in life and most of us get pretty good at it we weigh the possibility of people finding out we've lied against the consequences we have to face if we own up and often take the easy option I'm just reading these to show you this is all from a fallen nature this is how we can react react if it's from the Fallen nature but Christ does not react this way as a matter of fact I might as well say it Christ took the path of Calvary and to actually take the take the pain of our sin on himself number five we blame others because it removes inhibitions blaming other people can provide us with an excuse to act in a hurtful manner it's a way of justifying our actions excuse me it's a way of justifying our actions to ourselves to remove our brains natural inhibitions that are there to prevent us from having behaving poorly towards others it means we can build a thought pattern that allows us to act in a way that our moral compass would normally prevent so that's that's the five that came from other writers I'm adding six and seven you blame others because you come out looking good self-righteous talking about other people makes us feel better about ourselves if we can tell what they did we don't look so bad that's why people talk about other people many times and God convict us all I'm guilty of it may we all do you think that I'm preaching that someone no no no no no I'm preaching to every one of us here this morning number seven reason you do is you're more interested in being right than the full truth or Oneness with that person relationship must not be that important if you're always trying to put the blame on somebody else and not own up to it yourself you're more interested in looking out for yourself than the other person you're happy to hold on to a half truth then whole truth thus if you have hold on to half truth instead of pursue the whole truth thus half victories and not full victories God himself is not to blame for your problems bring your problems to the Lord and admit you're wrong you'll never be able to use it on Judgment Day to stand there and say but they did me wrong and this happened in this preacher and nor did you know about this situation it'll never stand up in court on the other side because at the end of the day it's about you and the word can you say Amen in this Bible there's prophets that Satan condemned and spoke against and tore down and fought against and guess what the truth marched on and they're still in this Bible and we're still feeding on it Satan I want to remind you you can never destroy the truth of God's word do it and so I can use that to say in situations sometimes when I'm counseling you be patient because the truth will always come out God is a Defender Of Truth the hardest thing is to wait till it comes out we want to act quickly that the truth is marching on you can't destroy this message you can't destroy the prophets that they came from God you can't destroy the influence of it you can't take children and Sons and Daughters of God and cause you can't do it you can't Satan you couldn't do it throughout Generations you can't do it today the truth is marching on can you say that why am I saying that because the way that we can live life is to be lovers of Truth and waiting till the truth comes out because the truth will set you free Julia Ward Howe 1819-1910 gave the United States and the world some of the most inspirational words ever written and she penned The Battle Hymn of Republic public I don't know if you have that sister Genie up there she penned The Battle Hymn of Republic in November of 1861 during a wartime tour of Washington DC As Americans realize with Gloom that the seven month old Civil War would be longer darker and deadlier than it was anticipated so she's right there in the middle of it she's watching she's watching the campfire she's watching the things and they realize this isn't going to be over anytime School anytime soon this is going to be a fight it's going to be a fight a lot of lives are going to be lost and they knew that they knew thousands of lives one of the worst wars ever and more lives lost than just about any other war and they knew it and it was coming but you know what the fight was over you know what the fight was over the truth that all men are created equal but there's gonna have to be a fight there's going to have to be men give their lives for truth how many you know your freedom today wasn't free she pinned this song house Masterpiece has been called America's fight song Glory Glory Hallelujah his truth is marching on it's been called the fight song it's lyrics inspired the United States this spiritual resolve and sacrifice the words tell the biblical heroic story of the Union Soldiers marching to their death in the Name of Christ devanque slavery so they're Marching In The Name of Christ and her songs in the lyrics we won't go through all of them their lyrics intertwine with scripture especially when she says the word as he died to make men holy we die to make one free it's a link between what Christ has done for us spiritually and what we have to do in war sometimes to fight for a truth and lives are lost and so this is all intermingled and it says the words tell the biblically um heroic story of Union Soldiers marching to their death in the Name of Christ to Vanquish slavery as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free his truth is marching on blaming others will only bind you but the truth will set you free fighting is okay if you're fighting to get to the truth not fighting one another and against one another but we rest that the truth will always win you start blaming the message or blaming everybody else you're on your promise you're fighting against the wrong thing We Fight Together as believers for truth and no matter how much the devil tries to knock it out his truth here we are friends he's never been able to trample out the truth it's still here despite what you would think of me and what I would think of you and we go through Seasons or whatever the truth keeps marching on thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by
