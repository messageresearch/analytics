her victory foreign [Music] [Music] oh you take off the enemies [Music] foreign [Music] it's time to understand [Music] love yourself [Music] this is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] to Genesis 26 and verse 1 and there was a famine in the land beside this the first famine that was in the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto abimelech King of the Philistines into career and the Lord appeared unto him and said go down go not down into Egypt dwell on the land which I shall tell thee of sojourn in this land and I will be with thee and will bless thee For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the oath which I swear unto Abraham thy father and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thee thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed this is the same blessing that came on his father Abraham and now God revisits him because how many know that the blessings of Our Father Abraham falls on all his seed after him because that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge and my Commandments my statues my laws and Isaac dwelt in Greer and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for Rebecca because she was a she was fair to look upon and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that bemnat king of Philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebecca his wife and abimelech called Isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and house sayeth thou she is my sister and Isaac said in him because I said lest I die for her and abimelech said what is this thou has done unto us one of the people might lightly have lion with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guilty guilt guiltiness upon us and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year a hundredfold and the Lord blessed him so I want you to notice now an elected Abraham seed coming by but he has to go because of the famine down into Greer and these other places that are that will become difficult places because you're going to run into jealousy and you're going to run into trouble and you're going to run into problems and you're going to be run into reactions of people because you're not in your own land you're having to go into places like you have to go into places of life that are not going to be the best response even though you're the Blessed of God so this is a type now in Isaac's life it's a type of the Bride now because we are certainly not in our homeland right now spiritually we are but we're not in our homeland yet so we're living in every day in Satan's Eden we're living in a career we're living in a a place where you're not going to be accepted and there's going to be all kinds of situations happen in your life just simply because you're blessed and you're the promised of God and when you get into those situations you're going to have reactions from people what I want you to notice in this is Isaac's reaction to all of it because we can't change what the world treats us like what our trials treat us like but we can change or God can change how we react to all of it verse 13 and the man whacks great and went forward and grew until he became very great so Isaac was being blessed in these situations no matter what he was prospering I may believe you can prosper spiritually in any situation for he had possessions of flocks and possession of herds and great storm servants and the Philistines envied him okay there's the jealousy the Envy for all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father in the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with Earth and abimelech said unto Isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we so he just sends them away sends Isaac away and Isaac notice now no response he said look what I'm doing here I I'm I'm prospering here if they had to pay taxes then it's like you could say sometimes I want to say to townships and different ones you know we pay taxes here and you're making us feel unwelcome and he could have responded but Isaac didn't respond to any of it you know what he just polite he said all right I'll move on to another piece of land here and Isaac departed this and pitched his tint in the valley of Greer and dwelt there and Isaac did begin the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father noticed these are his possession that's it's Abraham he dug these well for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and Isaac's servants digged in the valley and found their well-springing water so now once he starts digging these old Wells out then he starts to find water none of these guys could find that so he's blessed in fine water you can imagine how the jealousy just keeps Rising my goodness look what he's doing they become jealous and envious and start to turn against them even more Isaac servants digged in the valley and found there as well springing and the Herdman of guerrer did strive with Isaac's Herdman saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with them and that means that they want to defuss they wanted to Stew they wanted to argue they wanted to have Strife they wanted to get mad they they were jealous and they they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitna and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehabath and he said for now the Lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land and he went up from thence to Beersheba and the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said as the Lord appearing to him again I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake I know I'm taking a while here but I'm getting this now I'm preaching on this now so I won't have to come back to it but I want you to notice in the midst of a trial in the midst of people wanting to argue people want to fuss Express every other thing but love Isaac expresses it and right in the middle of that God Appears to him again and encourages them in I'm with you doesn't God do that with you sometimes if we're faithful to say Lord I want to walk with you and and give the right response back to people and give Divine love back to people when they're fussing and acting a certain way and treat them with respect the lord loves that and the Lord comes on the scene to Isaac said Don't Fear I am with thee I Will Bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham say and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his Dent there and their Isaac service digged a well then abimelech went to him from Greer and has us one of his friends and file and the chief captain of his army and Isaac said unto them wherever Come Ye to me coming back again to fuss with them seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you you're the one that sent me away you're the one that's expressing hatred here why are you coming out to me again and that's the way spirits will do in your life they're going to keep coming after you you've expressed love they're going to keep coming and keep coming and agitating and wanting to fuss with you can you say Amen Isaac's response was only one response because he expressed the mystery of divine love and that is that no matter what they do I'm going to stay in my calling God's chosen me I if they asked me to move I'll move over here and do my work diligently for the Lord and his promise I'm going to live in his promise and whatever I do I don't want to react and be like them God throughout history of the Old Testament was actually building towards something and when he came to his final Masterpiece it's kind of like a sculptor he takes many many years and a sculptor would take and God was taking through the Old Testament many many years until he got to his final Masterpiece in Jesus Christ I like to say it this way in the Old Testament God was trying to say something unless you have spiritual discernment it's hard to read the Old Testament but when you have Revelation the whole entire book of books of all the Old Testament God is trying to say something and he was trying to say something he's trying to say something in types and shadows and lives but then when Jesus came on the scene Jesus was what God was trying to say Jesus was the Masterpiece that God was building all through the Old Testament can you say amen and he come to his final Masterpiece and this one and think about what he was building a man like us he was virgin board but he was a man like us God came down and became us and God actually put his fullness within that man that God could express himself on Earth and see what God would look like on the face of the Earth that's was God's mystery as they would come down and express himself to man so that was God's Christ was God's Masterpiece all the character of God all the love of God all everything that was God he poured into that physical vessel and it was expressed to the world so everything was a build up in the Old Testament to get to that final Masterpiece but God's work did not stop there just like God did not stop his work in the Garden of Eden when he stopped with Adam he didn't stop with Adam there was another mystery that was there was another Masterpiece to be formed not just Adam how many knows he didn't stop it Adam there was an eve that was to become a masterpiece too and she was part of the whole mystery of God and so just like he did he took Eve out of Adam now when he finishes with Jesus Christ two thousand years ago as his Masterpiece not his final Masterpiece but his Masterpiece now he takes out of the sight of Jesus Christ you wonder why the the there's the types and shadows and things that we can look at but he takes that spear that Roman surgery and he puts it up in into Christ into his side and blood and water comes out of Christ and spirit comes out of him and we know he gives up the ghost he raises on the third day but then something happened his Spirit did not just go up into heaven his Spirit came back on a group of people what was God doing God was bringing Eve out of Adam God was beginning to form a woman of many membered bride just like he did taking Eve out of Adam now he was going to form a many member body that would be the next Masterpiece can you say man and these would not be virgin born these would be sin-born people that have such a new birth in their life they would be transformed by the power of God and they have the potential now to become Sons and Daughters of God and express the Masterpiece of God to this world oh I just explained to you God's full mystery can you say Amen that God did not stop with Jesus Christ but he wanted to have a bride and now here we are two thousand years after that and I can tell you God is culminating this statue this this image this masterpiece and he's doing it not in a building like this not in fineries of churches but he's doing it in people praise the Lord he's doing it in a people he's going to have a bride Ephesians he'll have a spotless bride without wrinkle without blemish Washed by the Water of his word we're coming to the final climax of a people that are the full expression of the image of God there's several stages that a sculptor that's like Michelangelo or someone like that when they're going to do a statue there's several stages that they go through and you can read those stages there's many stages they go through to get to the final product can you say man there's many different facets and phases and things that they do and so you can learn things from that because we realize God is our great Michelangelo God is our great architect God's our great sculptor can you say amen and he over time forms this Great Masterpiece and he does it to his certain way but it's just like a natural sculptor we can learn so much about God in our lives and somebody one of our misses ought to preach a sermon and just take all the stages of a sculptor but we can assume some things about a sculptor that we know if it's a really great statue like Michelangelo did some we know that it takes years to do it it doesn't take a week it doesn't take a month it doesn't take a year I was in the Vatican and scene of my someone Michael I was I was I seen a bunch of stuff that you've done and I guarantee you there are countless years that the sculpture took of working on it and working on it and working on it until he got to something you know what he got to he had a vision already in his mind what that was supposed to look at and and it looked like and he kept working on it and chiseling it and working on it until finally someday the vision that was already in his heart finally one day after years he seized the vision right in front of him in a statue I'm telling your friends the same God is working in our lives can you say amen and it may take years but if you'll submit to him he'll keep chiseling he'll keep working because why our God has a vision in his mind can you say Amen of what we're supposed to come to now when you have a sculptor number one we can assume it takes years how many would say Amen it takes years it takes many types of tools there's big tools that take big chunks there's little tools fine tools we consume it goes through many stages of cutting chunks are taken off and little carvings and then just little areas which something you feel like who've been in the way of the Lord a little while it's what I felt like the last uh two or three weeks here maybe a month God dealing with things in my life very very secret things and he just takes that little chisel and the thing he thought you're pretty good you're doing pretty good in your Christian walking then the Lord just says but but what about this I'm going to just shave that off and I've been down a little bit but at the same time I've learned let God do it let him dig it out let them carve that little thing because if it brings me closer to my goal a Divine love coming from this vessel I'll take the carving just that little edgy you might feel like your pastor's like that I'm just got that little tool I'm just I'm just digging right in that little spot but I love you I really do it's not me it's the Lord that loves you you think I know everything I don't know everything God knows everything though and if people come and counsel and stuff that's wonderful but most times if we just pray and let the Lord deal with us he'll speak things across the pulpit you get well that man didn't know about that and he gets right down in those little areas and exposes it say now I got I got to cut that off because it doesn't match the vision of what you're supposed to be God's got a vision of what you're supposed to be and you ain't there yet you think you're there and you're not there yet but we're on our road he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be it took him just a week to make the moon in Stars the Earth and the Sun Jupiter and Mars how loving and patient he must be he's still working on me amen uh there's another thing here that the sculptor does he's got that vision and he'll know when he sees it and he keeps working and shaving off what's needed to get to that Vision that's our life and if we would learn to stand still then God can do his work so now as we look at these things I want us bring us back into the channel of my PowerPoint here and talking about the different attributes of divine love this made me get very basic like it did a few weeks ago and we were dealing we dealt with out of 15 attributes of divine love in First Corinthians we dealt with the first three attributes of divine love all right so here's the next one love does not brag or boast love does not brag or boast and here's the scripture I gave you Matthew 6 1 says take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee that's bragging do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of man that thine arms may be in secret thy father would seeth and secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for thy love to praise they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I saying you they have their reward but thou will now prayers enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly there's something wrong with somebody who keeps directing the conversation back to their life their story their successes they have to one-up everybody When Love focuses on one another on the other person love focuses on that but this person it's not that we can't give glory to God and brag on him or bro or say God did this in my life and there's there's a certain way that you can bring it but this is a constant directing things back to me myself and I and bragging about it love focuses on another not self and there's another thing love focuses on and that's giving glory to God when you're bragging about yourself you're not giving glory to God John MacArthur JR says bragging and pride stem from selfishness and they are the flip side of jealousy we've already dealt with jealousy and what that is and that's not in Divine love as well but jealousy this is the flip side of jealousy jealousy is wanting what someone else has bragging is trying to make others jealous of what you have so you're talking about constantly because you want to get attention you're craving for attention so you're bragging on yourself and your successes and all that you've done Divine love doesn't do this jealousy is wanting what someone else has bragging is trying to make others jealous of what we have jealousy puts others down bragging builds us up bragging is an outward manifestation of Pride we'll get to Pride in a minute but bragging is the outward manifestation of Pride the braggart tries to impress others of his Great accomplishments in order to make himself look good so in relation Pride now love is not arrogant or proud and and and bragging and boasting is interrelated with pride you brag because you are proud when pride comes boiling up with an arrogant attitude of self-importance then come dishonor and shame but with the humble the teachable who have been chiseled ah teachable who have been chiseled by trial and who have learned to walk humbly with God there is wisdom and soundness of mine so that's the fruits of the humble but the fruits of a bullying up with arrogant attitude of self-importance it's all about three people me myself and I everything you'll destroy your marriage if you're all about yourself you destroy your family if you're all about yourself when pride comes arrogant attitude about self-importance then come dishonor and shame that's the fruits from this continued years of self-importance it's all about me all that comes is dishonor and shame in the family dishonor and shame in your life and other people's lives that's the fruit of it to talk a lot about the pride of life and the pride of this world but to Christians I've got to move into an area of religious Pride because religious pride is the worst kind to think that you are more spiritual than anyone else as I read in Matthew 6 the Pharisees they did everything over the top and but they did it for the wrong motive they did everything over the top but it was to appear more holy than the other men I thank God that I'm not like this sinner here everything the Pharisees did was to appear more holy to other men as better than other men a religious spirit thinks it has it all together and looks down on others no one ever measures up to where they are at I hope you're listening to me one and all a religious spirit you don't want a religious spirit you want the holy spirit thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if you would like
