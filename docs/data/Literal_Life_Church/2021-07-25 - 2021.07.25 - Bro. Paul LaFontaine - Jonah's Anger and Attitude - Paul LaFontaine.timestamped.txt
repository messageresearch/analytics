[0:00] as you're seated god bless you
[0:09] yeah i be i began to read this a few
[0:11] months ago
[0:12] and as i've told you before i'm
[0:15] intrigued now by the
[0:16] minor prophets and the prophets in my
[0:18] early christian journey
[0:20] those were books i kind of stayed away
[0:22] from because there was so much symbolism
[0:24] and it's so difficult to understand
[0:26] now i love really to read the prophets
[0:28] and the minor prophets and see
[0:30] those things and if you take some time
[0:31] god can open those things to you
[0:34] but i begin reading this about jonah
[0:36] towards the end of his life and it's um
[0:38] it's quite mysterious uh it's quite a
[0:41] mysterious way
[0:42] that jonah's second chapter of his life
[0:45] ends
[0:46] very mysterious uh very and many
[0:49] commentators and many people have
[0:51] tried to comment on it and bring out
[0:53] different things about it
[0:55] and i think it's quite interesting the
[0:57] way
[0:58] that really really the whole story of
[1:01] jonah is a bit
[1:02] a bit of a strange story and you know
[1:05] when you have
[1:06] god directing a big fish to swallow
[1:09] his son and transport him back to his
[1:13] will
[1:13] that's kind of a strange story already
[1:16] and then the bible says that god
[1:18] spoke to the fish and tells him to spit
[1:21] him out and vomit him on the shore god
[1:23] spoke to a fish so you know this is not
[1:27] a normal story by any means but
[1:29] we don't serve a normal god
[1:33] we don't serve a god who does everything
[1:37] uh like we expect it sometimes
[1:40] we don't serve a god that is just
[1:43] catering to
[1:44] make outcomes the way that you want them
[1:48] and there's one thing that i find in the
[1:51] in the book of jonah and the story here
[1:53] is
[1:53] he is a son of god and so because he is
[1:55] a son of god
[1:56] god continues to deal with him it's not
[1:59] like he's a serpent see her as something
[2:01] he's not a son of god
[2:02] he is his son and brother brahman says
[2:05] he's not even a backslider we say oh
[2:07] he's just being a jonah and we call him
[2:08] backside her brother
[2:09] said i stand up for jonah he wasn't
[2:11] backsliding he he said he actually
[2:13] becomes an
[2:14] example of all of us in some of his
[2:16] actions and some of his running away
[2:18] from the presence of god
[2:19] might as well admit it we're the same
[2:21] way sometimes
[2:22] but one thing that i learned and i hope
[2:24] i can bring many things out of the book
[2:26] of jonah the next few sundays or
[2:28] whatever
[2:29] but one thing that you need to catch is
[2:31] that there's certainly a theme here
[2:34] that if you are expecting god to do a
[2:36] certain thing with your own mind and not
[2:38] open to the holy spirit god can come
[2:41] around and do something completely
[2:43] opposite of what you're expecting
[2:45] and yet his ways are higher than our
[2:47] ways and we have to learn as sons to
[2:50] submit to the way god wants to do things
[2:54] so it's a strange story and god speaks
[2:57] to the fish and
[2:58] and you know there's a lot of strange
[2:59] things going on and there's things that
[3:01] you would not
[3:02] see god in many times and the prophet
[3:05] said
[3:06] what a sad ending when he's when he
[3:08] spoke of uh even
[3:09] jonah when he when he was told go to
[3:11] nineveh and preach to them
[3:13] and he got on a ship to tarshish running
[3:15] away from it and going on vacation he
[3:17] said he said it's very strange and he
[3:19] also said
[3:20] it's very sad that's the way he comments
[3:23] he says
[3:23] it's a very sad ending and then as you
[3:26] read the rest of the book of jonah it
[3:28] gets to me even more sad
[3:30] how jonah responds to god's power and
[3:34] god doing things the way he decided to
[3:36] do them
[3:36] it's really sad how jonah responds to it
[3:41] and so it kind of gets worse as you go
[3:43] along but
[3:44] and you know we americans we are used to
[3:47] um
[3:48] we've been taught we're used to happy
[3:52] endings
[3:53] stories uh we like stories that have
[3:56] happy endings
[4:00] we're we're the disney culture
[4:04] we've grown up on disney world and
[4:06] disney world got us in a flow of
[4:09] you know these these things and there's
[4:10] a story line and then
[4:12] uh then there's trouble in the middle
[4:15] and but but all of them
[4:17] all of them all of them end in a happy
[4:20] happily ever after
[4:23] can you say amen so you know and i'm not
[4:26] against that i don't think a
[4:27] a person's life can live in
[4:31] any happier than a christian that's
[4:33] filled with the holy ghost i believe in
[4:35] but i believe in true happiness i don't
[4:37] believe in fake happiness can you say
[4:39] amen
[4:40] i believe in god's happiness i believe
[4:42] in god's joy
[4:43] not the worldly type joy
[4:46] but we have been taught that every story
[4:48] needs to end a certain way and
[4:50] we've been taught to expect things to
[4:52] end a certain way
[4:53] and this is where people get in trouble
[4:55] with god and get angry with god
[4:57] is because your story line of your life
[4:59] if it's not turning out to what you
[5:01] expect
[5:02] you can develop feelings of resentment
[5:05] and anger
[5:06] not just towards people but towards god
[5:10] because why you had a certain thing in
[5:12] your mind and you prayed for a certain
[5:14] thing
[5:15] and you had it kind of set the way
[5:16] things were supposed to turn out
[5:18] i believe god has his way that things
[5:20] are supposed to turn out
[5:22] and the quicker that we can say lord i
[5:24] submit to that and i am
[5:25] happy with your will no matter what it
[5:28] may be
[5:29] that's when we're coming to maturity as
[5:32] sons
[5:34] and if you're not there this morning i'm
[5:36] not fully there yet but if you're not
[5:37] there
[5:38] that's when you say lord i come to the
[5:40] altar this morning i want to be there
[5:42] that i trust your ways are higher than
[5:44] mine your thoughts are higher than my
[5:46] thoughts
[5:49] that's where we need to grow to so you
[5:51] know
[5:53] and i believe there is a true happy
[5:55] ending for the bride of jesus christ but
[5:57] i
[5:57] i would say this that if there's a happy
[5:59] ending for the bride
[6:00] i don't think it's the complete
[6:02] happiness in this world because this
[6:04] world does not give us final and true
[6:06] happiness
[6:08] but when you talk about a rapture when
[6:10] you talk about a change of a body
[6:12] when you talk about this holy ghost that
[6:14] we love and are living by
[6:15] is going to turn into a new body and go
[6:17] into a millennium a honeymoon with the
[6:19] lord
[6:20] that's a happy ending but happy endings
[6:24] don't always happen on this earth every
[6:26] once in a while we have a temporal thing
[6:28] and we rejoice in it and god gives us
[6:30] true contentment and joy in this life
[6:31] that's because of the holy ghost
[6:33] not because you got a new car or a new
[6:35] truck or a new house or a new job
[6:37] that's not our contentment but when the
[6:39] lord gives you a revelation
[6:41] and something settles in your heart
[6:42] that's when true happiness comes
[6:44] but ultimately we're not going to have
[6:46] it in this world
[6:48] there's not going to be a complete happy
[6:50] ending in this world
[6:52] there's going to be trouble there's
[6:53] going to be persecution there's going to
[6:55] be family problems
[6:58] and it will continue because of the
[7:00] world that we live in but there is a
[7:02] happy ending
[7:03] for the holy ghost filled believers can
[7:06] you say amen
[7:06] there will be a change of the body there
[7:09] will be ultimate healing where you'll
[7:10] never get sick again
[7:12] there will be relationships restored can
[7:15] you say amen and there will be a
[7:16] millennium that we spend
[7:17] with perfect peace on this earth
[7:21] hallelujah so
[7:24] uh the the the the bible doesn't end it
[7:26] here in a normal thing at least in our
[7:29] eyes
[7:30] so i kept loving it leaving along and
[7:32] going back to it and pondering it and
[7:34] and so much of this is related to a son
[7:38] which has been spoken about the brother
[7:39] burley and different brothers now so
[7:41] much of this related to a son
[7:43] being corrected by the father and that's
[7:45] related to adoption
[7:47] a son being corrected by the father to
[7:49] cause him to grow
[7:50] and mature this is if if we want to see
[7:52] adoption we can see it in the life
[7:54] of jonah we're in the age of adoption
[7:57] we're in the time of
[7:58] adoption we're not in the time of the
[8:00] birth of the church
[8:01] we don't just emphasize salvation in
[8:04] christ
[8:05] although today you can be saved in jesus
[8:07] christ
[8:08] but it's not the age of just salvation
[8:10] that's why we have a church
[8:12] world that mostly emphasized salvation
[8:14] as long as somebody comes in salvation
[8:15] that's it that's the end
[8:16] and even pentecost did that brother
[8:18] brown says pentecost that's where you
[8:20] failed
[8:20] you thought because of the birth of the
[8:22] son that was it he said but no there's
[8:23] an adoption there's a placing of the son
[8:25] and in
[8:26] that placing in maturity the father
[8:28] deals with the son as
[8:29] a son and takes him through things to
[8:32] teach him
[8:32] how to become more mature through his
[8:35] trials
[8:36] we're in that time right now can you say
[8:39] amen you can go on and say well i was
[8:41] saved 30 years ago at the camp and
[8:43] god dealt with me back then i'm okay now
[8:45] you can go and do it all you want to but
[8:46] the time where
[8:47] the holy spirit is dealing with us as
[8:49] sons
[8:50] and he's looking for mature sons and
[8:53] daughters
[8:53] to carry out his kingdom in a mature way
[8:58] and we learn that through the trials
[8:59] that we go through in dealing with our
[9:01] specific predestinated trials that he
[9:03] gives us
[9:04] so this is the father dealing this
[9:06] special way with his son jonah
[9:08] i want to remind us of what the prophet
[9:10] said he says
[9:12] jonah becomes an example of us all
[9:15] that's the way he says it jonah
[9:16] becomes an example of us all i think all
[9:20] includes oh
[9:23] so you can't look over to your neighbor
[9:24] this morning and say how yeah
[9:26] he's been a jonah for sure this is this
[9:28] service is for him
[9:29] brother brahm says jonah is an example
[9:31] of us all
[9:32] right preachers deacons everybody
[9:37] so when we look at his life then we
[9:39] don't say well he's a jonah he's a
[9:41] backsider he's a
[9:42] you know he's a worldly person now he's
[9:44] a son of god
[9:45] but he sure is not acting like a son of
[9:47] god and he's got
[9:49] issues with running away from the
[9:51] presence of the lord and he's got issues
[9:52] with anger
[9:53] and that's the title of my sermon this
[9:55] morning jonah's anger
[9:57] and attitude
[10:00] so i don't know it'll be a shouting
[10:02] revival service but it all depends on
[10:04] how you relate to it
[10:07] so now you know he becomes an example of
[10:10] us
[10:10] all so no one is left out this morning
[10:13] he's a
[10:13] his life is the type of our life as a
[10:15] son and
[10:17] in other words this this writing in the
[10:19] bible is part of your spiritual
[10:21] biography
[10:22] it's laying right here in the bible it's
[10:24] part of your spiritual journey
[10:25] and part of your spiritual biography the
[10:28] prophet said he wasn't a backsider
[10:30] uh he was not an unbeliever but but
[10:32] jonah gets a
[10:33] bad rap many times that he's a he's a
[10:35] backslider but he
[10:36] but but brother brown says i i'm taking
[10:39] up for him i've always took up for jonah
[10:41] uh and in the first chapter of his life
[10:44] he had a problem running from the
[10:45] responsibility that came with the word
[10:47] that god give him
[10:48] and the word was given to him and he run
[10:50] from it he run from the presence of the
[10:52] lord
[10:52] he run from the word that was given he
[10:54] run from responsibility
[10:56] and brother brown brings out in running
[10:58] from the presence of the lord
[10:59] it he takes an easy route he says that's
[11:02] the type of us all
[11:03] we're always looking the for the easy
[11:04] way out of things
[11:06] an easy an easy christian walk an easy
[11:08] way
[11:09] and he took he took that and to serve
[11:12] the lord
[11:12] isn't always an easy way
[11:16] so he come through a great lesson and
[11:18] god taught him
[11:20] that he can run and he teaches us that
[11:22] you can run but you can't hide
[11:24] you can run from god and from his
[11:26] presence but god is everywhere trying to
[11:28] bring you back to the word because you
[11:30] are a son
[11:31] you can run from god all you want to but
[11:34] brother braham said to us
[11:35] god is in everything when he jumped in
[11:37] the boat god was in the boat
[11:39] when he was in the whale god was in the
[11:41] whale can you say a man
[11:43] i don't care how far you run if you're a
[11:45] son of god
[11:46] god going to be in every little thing to
[11:47] bring you back
[11:50] why because you are a son because you
[11:53] are his daughter
[11:55] somebody else can run away and that's
[11:56] not going to be a big deal but a son and
[11:58] daughter of god
[11:59] god is going to be out there somewhere
[12:01] looking for you
[12:03] god's going to be speaking through some
[12:05] neighbor can you say amen
[12:07] god might speak through a donkey god may
[12:09] speak through a fish
[12:10] but he's doing it because he's got a son
[12:13] that's rebellious and running from the
[12:14] presence of the lord
[12:15] you can run but you can't hide you young
[12:19] people you go and you've got thoughts so
[12:20] i'm tired of this i want to get out of
[12:22] this cage that i'm in
[12:23] listen if you're a son and daughter of
[12:25] god you're better off to submit now
[12:27] because god is your life you can run
[12:29] from your parents you can think you're
[12:30] running from god
[12:31] but he's going to love you right back to
[12:34] his throne to love you back
[12:38] and that's our god that's how he deals
[12:40] with sons
[12:42] a lot of other people might give up on
[12:44] you but god's not going to give up on
[12:45] you
[12:47] he don't run his kingdom like that god's
[12:49] not an indian giver he doesn't give
[12:51] something then take it back
[12:55] god doesn't do anything halfway
[12:58] god doesn't save you to lose you in the
[13:00] end
[13:02] he's serious about it he's serious about
[13:05] his work
[13:06] and those that continue in my word they
[13:08] are not my disciples he that hath begun
[13:11] a good work in you he will be faithful
[13:14] to complete it
[13:16] oh i love him this morning so
[13:19] he come through the great lesson god
[13:22] told him you can run but you can't god
[13:23] taught him you can run but you can't
[13:25] hide
[13:25] it's grace that keeps dealing with such
[13:28] unfaithfulness and i'll say that
[13:30] for my own life and yours it's grace
[13:33] that god continues to deal
[13:37] with our unfaithfulness
[13:41] and like i said a few weeks ago i don't
[13:42] want to be unfaithful to him
[13:45] i don't want to be unfaithful anymore
[13:46] he's faithful to me
[13:48] but i want to be faithful to him
[13:53] so let me just
[13:56] skip some of this
[14:00] so when he is supernaturally survive he
[14:03] survives
[14:04] supernaturally three days in a big fish
[14:05] he's vomited out on the shores of
[14:07] nineveh
[14:08] god providing transportation even back
[14:10] to his responsibility
[14:12] he didn't have jonah going back and
[14:15] getting off the ship
[14:16] swimming his way to shore and then take
[14:18] the chance of him running away again
[14:20] god provided uber
[14:25] an uber whale they had it back then you
[14:28] know
[14:29] god paid the fare and it said
[14:32] he spoke to the fish you know and
[14:35] directed him
[14:36] and god provided transportation to his
[14:39] son and took him right back
[14:41] to the shores of nineveh and that worked
[14:43] out well because nineveh had a
[14:46] fish god so you can imagine now jonah's
[14:49] being vomited out of a big fish
[14:52] god knows what he's doing he already had
[14:55] favor with the people
[14:57] and so now god brings them back and you
[14:59] knew like i said i want to move on
[15:01] because
[15:02] i know you know that part of the story
[15:03] but i want to bring wanted to bring some
[15:05] points out of it
[15:06] that that that the correction that god
[15:08] gave
[15:09] brings them back as a on in the fish and
[15:11] transports and
[15:12] that that that's all the correction that
[15:14] he needed because then
[15:16] we we find that he he got back to the
[15:19] commission
[15:19] and he did what he was told to do and we
[15:22] know that part of the story but there's
[15:25] obviously from the story there's more
[15:26] deeper things in jonah
[15:29] that's quite surprising and
[15:33] i'll just say it this way we would think
[15:36] that that's all the correction jonah
[15:37] needed
[15:39] and that's quite a correction that's
[15:40] quite a that's quite a story and it's
[15:42] quite a thing from god
[15:44] imagine jonah being vomited out of this
[15:46] fish now
[15:47] and he's seen god in all of it and you
[15:50] say
[15:50] you got to be able to conclude and say
[15:52] god is in my life
[15:54] it's time to surrender and thank you
[15:57] lord for correcting me
[16:00] guess what jonah still needed
[16:03] there was other things in him that
[16:04] needed to be corrected
[16:07] there were more inner things not outward
[16:09] things that he would pay a fair and go
[16:10] to
[16:11] tarshish instead of nineveh they were
[16:12] more inner things that needed to be
[16:14] corrected that maybe you couldn't see
[16:16] they were deeper things in jonah that
[16:18] was quite surprising and they had to be
[16:20] manifest and come out and he had to be
[16:22] corrected for those things
[16:24] it would be nice if jonah just settled
[16:26] down now but
[16:28] but he's not settled yet he's not
[16:30] settled
[16:31] he's still up and down in his attitude
[16:35] he's still unfaithful in his attitude
[16:38] that should have been enough but still
[16:40] he's unsettled in his spirit he's
[16:42] unfaithful in his spirit
[16:43] he's up and down may god help us if
[16:46] there's anything been resonating in me
[16:48] god lead me by the holy spirit as a
[16:50] pastor and as a people
[16:52] may we move ourselves out of this
[16:54] unfaithful up and down
[16:56] go for a few weeks in church and then
[16:58] you're out for a few weeks and
[16:59] one day you're reading your bible and
[17:01] you don't look at it for another six
[17:02] months may
[17:03] god in his mercy somehow use me or use
[17:06] somebody in your life
[17:07] to pull you out of that unfaithfulness
[17:11] god have mercy on us that we stay in
[17:14] relationship with him
[17:16] every day and so now we see then that
[17:20] uh brother brahm says in this first
[17:22] quote he said the principle
[17:24] the reason the principle reason that i
[17:27] believe that he did this thing right
[17:29] here was because jonah was a jew so now
[17:32] brother adam and these messages starts
[17:33] to get in the reasons why jonah did
[17:35] things
[17:36] and in the first quote that i sent you
[17:37] guys there if you have it the reason the
[17:39] principal reason that i believe that he
[17:41] did this great thing here
[17:42] was because jonah was a jew and he was
[17:44] asked to go to a gentile city
[17:46] to cry out against it thinking that he
[17:48] would not be received
[17:50] because the gentiles would think what's
[17:52] this jew got to do with us
[17:54] but you see another thing it gives us a
[17:57] great thing here to see
[17:58] that god not only is a god of the jew
[18:02] but he's god also of the gentile he is
[18:06] god of all people
[18:09] now i know this is a simple lesson but
[18:12] if we have prejudice
[18:13] or if jonah had prejudice and he thought
[18:15] he was a jew
[18:16] god calls him to speak to people that
[18:18] are gentiles which
[18:19] you know the issue that jews had with
[18:21] gentiles they never gave them the time
[18:23] of day
[18:24] they were just godless people can you
[18:26] say man they just they didn't know
[18:27] and even that prejudice continued in the
[18:29] book of acts
[18:30] after they had the holy ghost peter
[18:33] still had prejudice towards the gentiles
[18:36] after he had the holy ghost i've
[18:38] preached this before
[18:39] and you can't believe that someone has
[18:41] the holy spirit and he's still got
[18:42] prejudice so what did god do
[18:44] same thing with jonah he said to peter i
[18:46] want you to go down to the house of
[18:48] cornelius to all those gentiles
[18:50] and i want you to preach the gospel to
[18:51] them because they're going to come in
[18:53] god has ways of putting us into
[18:56] situations we don't want to be in
[18:59] and it's part of us dying to our
[19:02] prejudice
[19:04] i believe brother brown if you put that
[19:06] quote up and leave it up for a minute
[19:07] i believe he's trying to teach us the
[19:08] same lesson that he told
[19:10] jonah and that is what's this jew got to
[19:12] do with us he had a fear of going to the
[19:14] gentiles
[19:15] because they're going to say i won't
[19:17] receive you get out of here jew
[19:19] so he didn't he had a hesitance to go do
[19:21] it and to be a faithful witness to the
[19:23] message and what
[19:24] god said sent him to do you see another
[19:26] here's another lesson
[19:27] it gives us a great thing to see that
[19:29] god not only is the god of the jew but
[19:30] he's god also of the gentile
[19:32] he is god of all people you know that
[19:38] this morning
[19:41] he's oh we can't
[19:45] possibly jonah had some pride that this
[19:48] is not for them
[19:50] this is not for everyone
[19:55] i don't think that we should ever think
[19:56] this message is exclusive
[20:02] now brother paul i thought that the this
[20:04] message is only sent for the elected
[20:06] people the bride
[20:07] yes i know that but i don't want you to
[20:11] have that attitude
[20:14] that's the truth but when but what
[20:16] happens is
[20:17] if we take that truth and we become
[20:20] proud in it
[20:20] then we start to be selective of who
[20:23] we're going to give the message to
[20:27] i mean raise your hand seeing this in
[20:28] the message oh god help us
[20:31] may it may it go out this morning may i
[20:33] proclaim it i don't have any fear of
[20:34] proclaiming it
[20:35] there's been imbalances around our ranks
[20:38] to take the truth of election
[20:40] and all of a sudden now that person
[20:41] serpentine and this person's elect and
[20:43] this is bride and
[20:44] we're bride listen let me tell you i'll
[20:46] go with what he said he's the god
[20:48] of all people and if somebody will
[20:50] receive him that's not up to you
[20:52] who receives it
[20:55] [Music]
[20:56] just because somebody rejects him
[20:58] completely doesn't mean he's still not
[21:00] their god
[21:02] they may serve other gods but he is the
[21:04] god
[21:05] of all human beings
[21:08] just most people won't acknowledge it
[21:10] and come to it a lot of you this morning
[21:12] have come to it praise the lord
[21:14] glad to be in fellowship with you amen
[21:17] so he's the god of all people and we
[21:19] can't everyone deserves a chance at
[21:21] truths
[21:22] and uh we have preached the elected so
[21:24] much the elect the elect the bride the
[21:26] bride
[21:26] the message is only for the elect that's
[21:28] true but you don't know who that elect
[21:30] is
[21:31] brother perry green who was a mentor of
[21:33] mine and brought many people to the
[21:35] message
[21:35] he used to have a little saying and he
[21:37] witnessed to everybody he could see on
[21:39] the planes everywhere he witnessed and
[21:40] brought so many people to this light
[21:42] and it's because he had a principle this
[21:44] message is for everyone
[21:46] and everyone deserves to hear it at
[21:49] least once
[21:51] so he talked and talked and talked and
[21:53] talked and talked
[21:54] see sometimes we hold back like jonah
[21:57] did
[21:58] because we think this is only for a
[22:00] selected people and i don't know if they
[22:02] could receive this
[22:03] there's a lot to this and then you look
[22:06] at them what they're wearing
[22:11] they're cussing like a sailor
[22:14] that woman she's no doubt she's been
[22:16] with all kinds of men
[22:18] and now we say wow
[22:22] you know this message is a lot
[22:25] it's going to overload her and right
[22:28] there
[22:29] we become selective
[22:37] and i think that we should grow up and
[22:39] stop doing that
[22:42] jonah did it and run from the presence
[22:44] of the lord and his responsibility to
[22:45] bring it
[22:46] because those gentiles will never
[22:48] receive me it's not up to you to decide
[22:49] that
[22:50] there's a god that's bigger than all
[22:52] this
[22:56] there's so much to it brother pawn i'm
[22:58] going to get off my notes here a minute
[22:59] because i just like to elaborate on this
[23:02] there's just so much to it you know
[23:04] there's the truths and
[23:06] you start the beginning and it it wasn't
[23:09] an
[23:09] apple that they ate back there but it
[23:11] was a sexual act oh my god that's a
[23:13] tough
[23:14] that's a tough sell
[23:18] and god's not a trinity but he's one god
[23:20] in three offices
[23:22] it's a tough oh when almost all of
[23:23] christianity believes there's three
[23:25] persons
[23:27] in the godhead and there's not there's
[23:29] one person
[23:32] you got that so you go through all the
[23:33] doctrines predestination
[23:35] and there's no eternal hell oh my
[23:38] goodness no eternal hell no there's an
[23:40] everlasting but there's an into hell
[23:41] someday
[23:43] you go throughout and then that's the
[23:45] restored truths that we're enjoying
[23:47] and then you start getting into god
[23:49] restoring
[23:51] the dignity of a woman and what a man is
[23:54] and what a woman is and how a woman
[23:55] should dress and how a man should dress
[23:57] and
[23:57] you got this and it's in complete
[23:59] contrary contradiction
[24:01] to the entire culture that we live in
[24:03] today
[24:05] so you that grew up in this you got all
[24:07] this you know
[24:08] and you're saying this is this is a
[24:11] tough sell
[24:12] well it isn't you that sells it
[24:16] say well i don't know how to talk about
[24:18] it just tell how your candle got lit
[24:20] tell what happened to your life just be
[24:22] real
[24:24] they ask you a question you don't know
[24:25] the answer say well i don't know the
[24:27] answer
[24:31] i can't do that yeah you can that one i
[24:34] don't know i'll get back with you on
[24:35] that one
[24:36] i'm sure enjoying serving the lord under
[24:38] the message of the last days
[24:42] we don't have a right to say this is too
[24:45] big
[24:46] for somebody this may be exactly what
[24:49] the person needs
[24:54] i know it's big because it's the i tell
[24:56] you it's the greatest revealing of
[24:58] christ that's ever hit planet earth
[25:02] that's big that's wonderful
[25:05] but i'd take it any day to just some
[25:07] partial
[25:09] truth of jesus christ if god gave me at
[25:12] all i'll take it all
[25:14] see you got all of something and you
[25:15] want to hoard over it and keep it back
[25:17] from people no
[25:18] give it to somebody else
[25:24] the word of god he said will destroy
[25:27] this place
[25:28] in 40 days and moving on with jonah now
[25:30] the word of god will destroy this place
[25:31] in 40 days now he says it
[25:33] all right he speaks the word of god
[25:36] thus saith the lord this this nineveh
[25:40] will be finished god told me to tell you
[25:45] this nineveh will be destroyed in 40
[25:48] days
[25:48] thus saith the lord and then when he
[25:52] spoke that
[25:53] then out of the clear blue
[25:58] that's not what happens
[26:04] out of the clear blue they start
[26:06] repenting
[26:08] the king starts repenting
[26:12] i think god has surprises from some of
[26:14] you sometimes
[26:18] well i invited him
[26:21] and they came to church i can't believe
[26:24] it
[26:25] how many people have you invited to
[26:27] church
[26:29] you go to this church you believe this
[26:30] message but how many people have you
[26:32] invited to come here and why won't you
[26:37] i know some of you live a long ways away
[26:39] and getting somebody to drive
[26:40] three hours or two hours to church i
[26:43] know that's a
[26:44] but depending how hungry the person is
[26:48] we got people traveling a long ways to
[26:49] church friends
[26:52] even on wednesday nights you know what
[26:54] it is it sure ain't this buddy that's
[26:56] preaching
[26:57] it's a hunger for the lord it's a
[26:59] priority
[27:03] so when's the last time you invited
[27:06] someone
[27:07] and it's 40 days this place will be
[27:09] destroyed they started to repent they
[27:11] started to come around
[27:12] the king starts to repent the king
[27:14] orders an entire national repentance
[27:17] and maybe god will turn his fierceness
[27:19] away from us
[27:20] and and give us deliverance and so now
[27:22] we have something happen contrary
[27:25] now you just put yourself in jonah's
[27:26] shoes now he's been commissioned to say
[27:28] thus
[27:29] saith the lord thus
[27:32] saith the lord this place is finished in
[27:35] 40 days
[27:37] now i want to stop there because
[27:41] the prophet teaches us something here
[27:44] when it comes in the message
[27:46] warning then judgment and he says
[27:49] god gives a warning he gives every man a
[27:52] warning
[27:54] but sometimes there's a delay in the
[27:56] judgment coming
[27:58] based upon their repentance so it
[28:01] appears
[28:02] like sometimes that thus saith the lord
[28:04] was not the saith the lord
[28:06] but because god is merciful and god
[28:08] knows whether they'll repent or not
[28:10] god gives mercy and gives an extension
[28:13] of time
[28:14] to somebody who repents and guess what
[28:18] if god does that we shouldn't be hung up
[28:21] trying to figure out i thought that was
[28:23] thus they at the lord i thought it was
[28:24] supposed to be just this way
[28:26] i thought it was supposed to happen just
[28:27] this way we shouldn't get hung up on
[28:30] that because it's the grace of god in
[28:32] his timing that does something.
[28:36] so now you've got people saying oh i
[28:38] wasn't going to get into this but
[28:40] okay he said this he said that and he
[28:43] said that there was a bridge and a
[28:45] certain man fell from a bridge and he
[28:46] had a vision and
[28:47] we can't find enough articles to prove
[28:49] that and he said there was
[28:50] certain thousands of people in this
[28:52] meeting in south africa
[28:54] and there's no records that show that
[28:56] and we get hung up
[28:58] on how prophecies come to pass
[29:02] and some people have dumped the message
[29:04] out because of it
[29:06] but god is not interested in proving to
[29:09] us
[29:09] how it's supposed to happen our own way
[29:14] when he says something he means it can
[29:17] you say man
[29:18] and he'll fulfill it the way that he
[29:20] wants to fulfill it not the way you want
[29:22] to do it
[29:25] leaving the message over that and you
[29:27] got prophets in the bible
[29:28] were inspired to say something but it
[29:31] ended up coming out quite different than
[29:33] they expected
[29:34] if that happened with prophets in the
[29:36] bible then it can happen with the
[29:37] prophet today
[29:40] people get hung up okay this there's
[29:41] nothing to this thing i'm i'm leaving
[29:43] this thing my you know what you're doing
[29:45] you're living by your own will
[29:47] you've exercised your own will this
[29:49] thing better
[29:50] better tally up perfect with no flaws in
[29:54] it or i'm leaving it
[29:55] you go ahead and make that statement and
[29:57] see where you stand with god
[30:00] expecting perfection out of
[30:06] the man who's bringing the message but
[30:09] you wouldn't expect perfection that kind
[30:11] of perfection out of you
[30:13] am i allowed to say these things
[30:17] so in here we find some real lessons
[30:19] about people who just leave on a whim
[30:22] i didn't i don't understand why god said
[30:24] it that way
[30:25] and it didn't come to pass that way so
[30:28] i'm scrutinizing that
[30:30] and jonah responds so let's move on now
[30:32] so that's what happens out of the clear
[30:34] blue this whole country
[30:35] begins to repent that's not how the
[30:38] prophecy was supposed to happen
[30:39] that's not how thus saith the lord was
[30:41] supposed to happen
[30:44] jonah was
[30:47] you know if if an entire nation repented
[30:50] over a minor prophet like jonah coming
[30:52] in saying
[30:52] repent or perish it's like it's going to
[30:55] be over
[30:56] jonah should be shouting in his boots
[31:00] jonah should be rejoicing over what god
[31:02] has done
[31:04] the next chapter chapter 4 and that's
[31:06] why when i read it i'm going
[31:08] jonah what in the world are you doing
[31:11] what kind of an attitude is this
[31:15] where in the world and anger anger what
[31:18] in the world are you
[31:19] angry about and that's what i begin to
[31:20] ask what in the world is he angry about
[31:23] he's not supposed to be angry he's
[31:25] supposed to be happy
[31:27] he's supposed to be rejoicing
[31:31] and he's not because he's got inner
[31:32] anger to deal with
[31:35] maybe wednesday night i'll talk about
[31:36] anger in depth
[31:39] because what is one of the biggest
[31:41] issues
[31:42] is unresolved anger internally in
[31:44] somebody
[31:46] that you can say you're over it all you
[31:47] want to but if you're holding it
[31:49] it's faster see anger has a way to
[31:51] fester
[31:53] praise the lord glory be to god what a
[31:55] service today and rejoice
[31:56] in all the wow angers festering even
[31:59] from 30 years ago
[32:04] and paul tells us in ephesians to deal
[32:06] with our anger to not let the sun go
[32:08] down on our wrath
[32:09] we have a place to bring our anger and
[32:12] we have a healing balm
[32:13] from calvary that can heal all
[32:17] anger i'm not talking about the emotion
[32:20] and we we get
[32:21] we have the emotion of anger that's a
[32:22] part of us i'm talking about festering
[32:23] anger
[32:24] it just lays there and that's what jonah
[32:27] had
[32:28] and i don't know what all it comes from
[32:29] but it's such a surprise to have him
[32:31] respond this way
[32:32] to people repenting an entire nation
[32:34] repenting i can't believe
[32:36] i cannot believe that this response is
[32:38] from this minor prophet it's
[32:39] unbelievable that's why i begin to look
[32:41] at and say what in the world
[32:42] is going on with this man
[32:47] so now some of these reasons are
[32:52] unveiled in the message and when he
[32:54] begins to speak warning the judgment
[32:56] i already mentioned there are two
[32:57] message two messages to you that you can
[32:59] study this
[33:00] number one is running from the presence
[33:02] of the lord listen to that read it in
[33:04] 1965
[33:05] and now the one i'm commenting now from
[33:07] is warning then judgment
[33:09] and this is in the message where he
[33:11] explains
[33:13] from isaiah 38 that isaiah told
[33:16] god told isaiah the prophet to go to
[33:18] hezekiah
[33:20] and say thus saith the lord set your
[33:23] house in order
[33:24] you're going to die thus saith the lord
[33:28] so isaiah obeys just like jonah did he
[33:31] goes
[33:31] he says to hezekiah i'm sorry to tell
[33:33] you this but thus saith the lord your
[33:35] days are numbered you're going to die
[33:36] real soon
[33:37] and you need to set your house in order
[33:38] because it's almost over okay
[33:40] now just to lay down some foundations
[33:43] here a little bit for
[33:45] the way he's going to look at this this
[33:47] next quote in
[33:48] god warning and judgment god warning a
[33:51] man before bringing him into his death
[33:53] not everyone has this we might say
[33:57] well we might say well this fellow died
[33:59] without a warning no no no
[34:02] god never you don't know what was in
[34:04] that man's heart
[34:05] you don't know what's being so you know
[34:06] what he's saying is that god never
[34:08] sends a man to judgment without first
[34:10] warning him
[34:12] and we may think man that guy never got
[34:14] a warning he he went on and he died and
[34:16] i know god always for every human being
[34:19] gives them a chance you see well i
[34:22] didn't see anything happen
[34:24] well god's not trying to make you see
[34:26] things happen
[34:28] he didn't come the way i thought he
[34:29] should come well that's up to god
[34:31] that's right now i'm not trying to put
[34:33] people in heaven
[34:36] you know there's nothing worse than
[34:37] preaching a funeral and and you know
[34:39] these preachers putting people in heaven
[34:40] and you know
[34:42] they didn't i don't know it's pretty
[34:44] rough i don't like being in those
[34:45] situations
[34:46] i just talk to the family and encourage
[34:48] them to serve the lord and
[34:50] do what i can i've been in those
[34:51] situations and it's rough but one thing
[34:53] that we don't want to do too is all of a
[34:54] sudden go the other thing and just say
[34:56] that person's burning in hell right now
[34:59] god gives everybody a chance and it's
[35:01] how they respond they may have turned it
[35:02] down
[35:03] but we don't know how god got to that
[35:05] person
[35:06] and we may say this fellow died without
[35:08] a warning no no no god never
[35:10] you don't know what was in that man's
[35:11] heart you don't know what's been going
[35:13] on in
[35:14] his life you see god never brings any
[35:16] man to his death without first warning
[35:18] him about it
[35:18] telling him it's something a preparation
[35:21] god is sovereign
[35:22] and he knocks at the heart of every man
[35:26] giving him the opportunity to come can
[35:28] you say praise the lord
[35:31] he knocks at the door of every man
[35:34] giving him
[35:35] the opportunity to come
[35:38] he might warn away and turn it down and
[35:40] shake his head and walk away and say oh
[35:42] it's just a funny feeling that's what
[35:44] that man say
[35:45] oh that's just a funny feeling and he
[35:46] walks away i'll get over it but anyhow
[35:49] it was god god speaking to him
[35:53] in a funny feeling they had and they
[35:54] turned it down but that was god speaking
[35:56] to him
[35:59] god always gives a man a chance so
[36:02] hezekiah
[36:06] does what nineveh does he goes to
[36:09] repenting before god said god i'm not
[36:10] ready i don't have my house in order
[36:12] and i need more time god forgive me i
[36:15] need more time
[36:16] and so god says to the same prophet
[36:20] go back and talk to hezekiah and tell
[36:23] him thus saith the lord
[36:24] i give you 15 more years because
[36:28] repentance our friends true repentance
[36:29] does a lot with god
[36:33] god is not the kind of god that is
[36:36] looking for ways to make things
[36:38] difficult for you in the sense
[36:40] of nope finish like some of us parents
[36:43] are to our kids sometimes
[36:45] we're just you know no you're done
[36:48] that's it
[36:49] i don't care how much you say i'm sorry
[36:51] you're done god is not looking for ways
[36:55] to say that
[36:56] he's looking for true repentance and he
[36:59] responds to it
[37:01] amen so
[37:04] hezekiah you know he's he's given 15
[37:07] more
[37:08] years but put yourself in the prophet's
[37:10] shoes isaiah going down how does it make
[37:12] him look
[37:13] how does it make jeremiah look excuse me
[37:17] isaiah look
[37:17] when he says thus say the lord and come
[37:20] back and it appears like
[37:22] god has changed his mind you get 15 more
[37:26] years
[37:26] thus saith the lord the prophet goes on
[37:28] to say all right we find out
[37:31] the next quote he sends his prophets
[37:32] without warning excuse me he sends his
[37:34] prophets with warning
[37:36] he doesn't change his way his method of
[37:37] doing things he does not always strike
[37:39] when he warns
[37:40] i want you to watch this quotation god
[37:42] gives a warning but he don't always
[37:44] strike
[37:45] the same time he warns did you notice
[37:47] that
[37:48] and then when he doesn't strike when he
[37:49] sends a warning then the prophet is
[37:51] mocked
[37:52] you didn't have it you told a lie you
[37:54] wasn't right
[37:55] that's the same same thing might have
[37:57] been said to isaiah what do you think
[37:59] that that man thought when he went up
[38:00] there and prophesied the king was going
[38:01] to die
[38:02] then come back down and said he no he's
[38:04] going to live
[38:05] what about jonah going through the
[38:06] street saying oh this city is going to
[38:08] be destroyed within so many 40 days
[38:10] and then god didn't do it you see you
[38:12] have to watch
[38:13] god don't always strike when he warns
[38:18] are you learning but
[38:21] but he there's one thing then the
[38:23] prophet is mocked
[38:25] the prophet is mocked interesting
[38:30] our prophet is mocked and a lot of the
[38:33] reason is because
[38:34] they want to see things turn out the way
[38:37] they want to see them turn out
[38:40] so isaiah is mocked jonas thinks he's
[38:42] going to be mocked because
[38:44] this thus the lord is not turning out
[38:46] the way that i thought it was supposed
[38:47] to turn out
[38:49] the prophet is mocked but but if he is a
[38:52] vindicated prophet with the word of the
[38:54] lord
[38:54] see signs of god vindicated as god said
[38:56] the prophet would be vindicated
[38:58] which these men were see his word is not
[39:01] his
[39:02] but it's god's and it will come to pass
[39:06] it's got to come to pass if it's god's
[39:08] word there's only one thing can stop it
[39:11] that's a quick repentance
[39:15] praise the lord so not too much more i
[39:19] say about it but
[39:21] we have to approach the message
[39:24] the same way god's not trying to work it
[39:27] all out so
[39:28] it works out the way that we think it
[39:31] should work out
[39:32] and that's for years we take a quote and
[39:34] we think we're going to apply a quote to
[39:36] something
[39:36] apply be careful how you apply a quote
[39:38] something to
[39:39] a quote to something so quickly it may
[39:41] not be the right quote that applies
[39:45] be careful using it as ammunition so
[39:48] quickly
[39:48] god didn't extend his word to use
[39:50] ammunition against other people
[39:53] the ammunition is against the devil our
[39:56] weapon of the word is
[39:57] for the devil not your husband or your
[40:00] wife or your children or your
[40:01] person that did you bad this week the
[40:03] weapon of the word i got some quotes for
[40:05] him buddy i'm going to come down with
[40:06] some quotes i got a book of them here
[40:08] get ready partner i've got you the word
[40:10] was not intended to use for a weapon
[40:12] against other people
[40:16] but for the enemy and here this prophet
[40:19] is
[40:20] he could be embarrassed it doesn't say
[40:22] isaiah is but
[40:23] the prophet is mocked on the internet
[40:26] for the last three or four years
[40:28] especially four or five years
[40:30] the prophet of this age has been mocked
[40:34] and continues to be mocked
[40:36] just simply because
[40:40] people see that it hasn't come out
[40:45] the way they thought it was supposed to
[40:47] come out
[40:50] and he tells billy paul he says someday
[40:53] notice that sign in los angeles
[40:58] yes dad the may company he says you
[41:01] won't be an old man
[41:02] before there will be sharks swimming
[41:06] in this through that building the may
[41:09] building
[41:12] it's not just something he said to his
[41:13] son this is not on t
[41:19] so now people wait
[41:24] they look for all this to happen it's
[41:25] going to happen it's going to happen but
[41:28] there's been two or three times
[41:31] that los angeles has had flooding
[41:35] and floods the may building
[41:38] and they reported there was sharks
[41:42] swimming in the may building already
[41:46] so in our we're waiting for something to
[41:48] come but we don't know
[41:49] maybe it's already happened now that's
[41:53] just between us
[41:54] here you know don't go and make
[41:56] doctrines out of that
[41:57] just between us and the whole world on
[41:59] the internet
[42:04] but you understand another minister
[42:06] brought that out that's a great point
[42:08] and it's all about this god that hasn't
[42:11] left it up to us to figure all this out
[42:14] how it's supposed to happen
[42:16] it's up to us to believe it
[42:19] and he's either god's prophet for this
[42:21] hour or please somebody come and tell me
[42:23] who's the prophet for this hour because
[42:25] the bible says there's supposed to be
[42:26] one
[42:27] and if this one isn't it wasn't it
[42:29] please somebody tell me i'm desperate
[42:31] for my spiritual life
[42:33] i need to know who malachi 4 is but i
[42:35] don't have an identity crisis
[42:37] i know who malachi 4 wifi was and i know
[42:40] who i
[42:41] am i'm not struggling whether this is
[42:44] still struggling with us
[42:45] and if you're struggling just pray
[42:47] because you need to settle it in your
[42:49] heart
[42:50] the devil has all kinds of voices settle
[42:52] it this is truth
[42:53] this is the man god sent and now that
[42:55] man is gone and the truth that he
[42:57] restored
[42:58] i'm living in the glory of it can you
[43:00] say amen and i'm gonna be a witness to
[43:02] it i'm gonna live it i'm gonna testify
[43:04] of it
[43:05] i'm gonna believe it with all my heart
[43:08] i'm not a clone of the world can you say
[43:10] amen i'm an image of jesus christ in his
[43:13] word
[43:14] i'm a message believer of this last days
[43:16] and i'm unashamed to say that i am
[43:19] the greatest message that's ever come
[43:25] praise the lord
[43:29] so then uh
[43:33] he goes on to talk a little bit about
[43:34] jonah
[43:37] 12 30. i got plenty of time here praise
[43:39] the lord
[43:40] i'm doing good so the next question says
[43:43] why he commissioned isaiah to go tell
[43:45] him thus saith the lord
[43:47] then if there's a change in that or a
[43:49] lingering
[43:52] notice that word lingering okay it's
[43:54] going to happen anyhow he died just the
[43:56] same hezekiah died just saying
[43:57] but if there's anything in that then
[43:59] he's obligated to come back to the man
[44:01] that he sent thus saith the lord he told
[44:03] isaiah go back out there and tell him
[44:04] now jonah took a different attitude now
[44:06] what you just
[44:07] that that's why i titled my message
[44:08] jonah's anger and his attitude
[44:10] because ram says in this message he said
[44:11] jonah took a different attitude
[44:13] than isaiah isa isaiah just went with it
[44:16] i don't know why i'm going back over to
[44:18] hezekiah's house and saying
[44:19] you got 15 more years thus saith the
[44:21] lord
[44:22] but i'm not going to figure it out god
[44:24] is god
[44:26] but he said jonah took a different
[44:28] attitude he got
[44:29] mad he got angry
[44:33] see lord i told you did anybody have
[44:36] their bible open
[44:37] to chapter four verse one but it
[44:39] displeased jonah keep that quote up keep
[44:41] that quote up
[44:42] i need that but it displeased jonah
[44:45] exceedingly and he was very angry
[44:47] and he prayed unto the lord and said i
[44:48] pray thee verse 2 of chapter 4
[44:50] oh lord was not this my saying when i
[44:52] was yet in my country therefore i fled
[44:54] before
[44:54] unto tarshish for i knew that thou art
[44:56] gracious god and merciful soul to anger
[44:58] and the great kindness and repentance of
[44:59] the
[45:00] he actually said when he was
[45:01] commissioned to go back there he told
[45:03] the lord see
[45:04] god if i go down there they might repent
[45:06] and look see i told you
[45:08] they repented
[45:12] this guy has issues he's got a problem
[45:17] they all repented see lord i told you
[45:19] they would repent because you're a
[45:20] merciful god
[45:25] my goodness brother brahm says jonah had
[45:28] a different attitude
[45:30] than than isaiah because isaiah said
[45:33] you told me go down give him 15 more
[45:35] years i'm just i'm just a
[45:37] messenger i'm going to try to figure out
[45:40] thus saith the lord and what it meant
[45:42] all the intricate details i just know
[45:44] you're god
[45:44] and i know i'm the prophet i'm going to
[45:46] do what you said to do jonah didn't do
[45:47] that he took a different attitude
[45:49] and he says jonah took a different and
[45:51] gets up on the top of the hill and says
[45:53] well it'd be good if i was never born
[45:55] that's what he says in verse 3
[45:58] verse 3 keep the quote up he says
[45:59] therefore now verse three got your bible
[46:01] oh lord take i beseech you my life from
[46:04] me
[46:05] take my life from me lord for it is
[46:08] better for me to die
[46:10] and don't have just just take me lord
[46:14] i don't want to face the ninevites i
[46:16] don't want to face you
[46:18] i look like an idiot i said they were
[46:22] going to be destroyed and they're
[46:23] repenting
[46:24] just take me lord
[46:27] i just want to die
[46:31] and brother brian says well it's
[46:36] jonah said it'd be good if i never was
[46:37] born and oh how he went on and god
[46:40] had a little gourd to come up and make
[46:42] him some shade
[46:44] until he got cooled off a bit cooled off
[46:47] up there
[46:49] so this is the rest of the story and uh
[46:52] if you want to hear it you have to come
[46:53] back next sunday we'll get into the
[46:56] gourd
[46:58] he cooled off a bit but he said now here
[46:59] i went down there and they're going to
[47:01] say i'm a false prophet
[47:03] jonah's saying god i went down they're
[47:04] going to say i'm a false prophet and god
[47:06] spoke to him and said look at that city
[47:07] down there lookie
[47:08] john look at that whole city is
[47:10] repenting with sackcloth and ashes
[47:12] and then he told him about the little
[47:13] gourd and the worm that cut it down one
[47:14] day the lord willing
[47:16] i want to come to the tabernacle and
[47:18] take a series just on jonah
[47:20] oh there's so many great things that
[47:22] east wind blowing and oh there's so many
[47:23] things in there it's thrilling
[47:25] them nuggets when i read that and i'd
[47:27] been studying this for six months when
[47:28] he said that
[47:29] praise the lord there's something in
[47:30] here i just don't know what it is yet
[47:34] but brother bram says there's nuggets in
[47:36] here that you can preach on for weeks
[47:39] i'm going lord in jonah what in the
[47:42] world can i preach out of that
[47:45] but if he said it then i'm studying it
[47:47] them nuggets are in there at all types
[47:49] for perfectly fit
[47:50] it even brings jesus christ in it and
[47:52] everything else
[47:53] of course every line in the bible brings
[47:55] jesus christ
[47:59] so i'm going on with the quote now i
[48:00] didn't have them put that up and i'll
[48:02] bring you into the quote here in a
[48:03] minute because there's so many quotes
[48:04] but listen to this and i will close on
[48:06] this final
[48:07] thing because brother brown gives a
[48:08] story here about his own life
[48:10] and it's very teaching for all of us in
[48:13] this jonah situation we'll end here
[48:16] i want you to ponder this and then we'll
[48:17] go on with jonah's life next sunday
[48:20] anybody get anything out of this today
[48:21] amen amen
[48:23] praise the lord i like those big amens
[48:25] that keeps me going through the week let
[48:27] me hear that again
[48:33] god bless sister abigail
[48:36] praise the lord
[48:40] he said i want to show you another jonah
[48:43] that's in the platform tonight
[48:47] one night there was a people that come
[48:48] in here and the lady maybe some of their
[48:51] people here tonight so i won't call the
[48:52] name but
[48:53] you would probably know who it is but
[48:55] they come in here
[48:56] a fine bunch of people from down in
[48:58] kentucky and they come here for years
[49:02] but the people being very fine people
[49:04] good friends of mine
[49:06] they were they were real good friends of
[49:07] mine but just one of those kind of
[49:10] people that when a revival was going on
[49:12] they could come to church and when the
[49:16] revival was off
[49:17] and the load was pulling nobody would
[49:20] pull
[49:24] and uh i'm just i would love to stop
[49:28] there and preach a whole sermon on that
[49:34] i think you should have your families in
[49:35] church
[49:38] especially in the times we're living in
[49:41] this
[49:41] a family is real close friends with them
[49:43] great people great people
[49:45] but he said they'd come and then they'd
[49:47] they wouldn't pull the load and they'd
[49:48] stop coming all the children was here on
[49:50] the crater roll and they when we had our
[49:52] classes and things and one day
[49:53] come to sunday school one day i come
[49:55] home about four years ago or five
[49:57] something like that and this young girl
[49:58] which was about eight years old when she
[49:59] was in the cradle role
[50:01] she had been married had two children
[50:04] and she was laying out in the hospital
[50:05] out there at the point of death
[50:07] and she was about four months five with
[50:08] a baby and the baby had died and they
[50:10] couldn't operate because she had
[50:12] anemic and they couldn't operate so had
[50:14] to let the mother die
[50:16] too can't operate and see the baby would
[50:17] kill her like that
[50:19] and she was just dying that's all wasn't
[50:20] no chance for her i went out to see her
[50:22] she had
[50:22] sent for me and i went to the hospital
[50:24] and there was a she was under an oxygen
[50:26] tent
[50:26] and i raised up the little flat and
[50:28] talked to her a little bit and i said

[50:47] down and prayed and her mother and her
[50:48] husband and many of them in the room and
[50:49] her mother and husband started crying
[50:51] and then i asked her and she got right
[50:53] with god paid her vows and come back and
[50:55] made god the promise
[50:56] and if she'd be forgiven how she loved
[50:58] him and sorry for her sins

[51:02] her repentance and crying
[51:04] and after a while i got up and went out

[54:19] and when i come back home and media told
[54:20] me that the girl died that night
[54:22] i couldn't i went to see the mother
[54:27] the next quote and i don't know what
[54:29] caused me to do it
[54:34] but i said lord god you owe me an
[54:37] understanding
[54:39] after me going out there and telling
[54:41] that husband and him coming to the lord
[54:43] after you've done these things for him
[54:45] and all like that
[54:46] and then take that girl's life like that
[54:48] i said you
[54:50] owe me and understanding
[54:54] when you tell god something like that
[54:57] he'll leave you sitting alone
[55:04] he don't owe me nothing
[55:08] i'm in debt to him can we learn the
[55:11] lesson this morning
[55:14] god doesn't owe us anything god doesn't
[55:19] owe us an explanation of what happens in
[55:21] our life
[55:23] there are a lot of things we will not
[55:25] ever
[55:26] know why they happened in our christian
[55:29] life
[55:29] until we get to the other side amen and
[55:34] the quicker you come to peace with that
[55:36] and go on with the lord the happier
[55:39] you'll be
[55:42] you start get demanding from god in your
[55:45] anger
[55:47] lord you owe me an explanation for this
[55:49] and if you don't show me then
[55:51] a few months from now i'm i'm i'm
[55:53] leaving you
[55:54] you start threatening like that you do
[55:56] it out of your anger
[55:58] it's anger it's what jonah had as we
[56:01] heard last sunday
[56:02] we got to quit functioning and making
[56:05] decisions
[56:06] based upon our anger and our emotions
[56:10] and start being led of the holy spirit
[56:18] when you tell god something like that
[56:19] he'll leave you sitting alone he don't
[56:20] owe me nothing i'm debt to him well
[56:22] he just let me pout it out for a few
[56:24] days you know and after about three or
[56:26] four months
[56:27] one day i was out on the creek bank and
[56:29] the lord spoke to me in a vision and
[56:31] said
[56:31] now go to her mother and say this to her
[56:33] mother did not her time come the year
[56:35] before that when she was drowning in a
[56:37] creek and a picnic
[56:38] on a picnic she should have went at that
[56:41] time
[56:42] but i had to take her when she was ready
[56:45] to go
[57:04] and that's why all this happened
[57:08] and why you went out there and then i
[57:11] got down and i cried
[57:14] and i said lord jesus forgive me
[57:18] your poor stupid servant
[57:22] i should have never said that lord
[57:27] we say things in our anger
[57:31] we say things because we want a certain
[57:33] thing to happen
[57:36] and those who are still micromanaging
[57:38] your life
[57:40] the outcome of everything in your
[57:41] children and everything
[57:43] you need to let go and let god
[57:47] have his way no matter how afraid you
[57:50] are
[57:51] you need to let the spirit lead
[57:59] sorry i i can't read those words already
[58:02] without breaking down
[58:04] i cried i said lord jesus forgive me
[58:06] your stupid servant i should have never
[58:08] said that
[58:13] it goes on to say and this is not with
[58:17] you guys up there
[58:18] and i had went back down to the lady she
[58:20] lived over there on market street and i
[58:21] went over
[58:22] to her and said i want to ask you a
[58:23] question she said sure brother bill
[58:25] i said is it true that this girl almost
[58:27] drowned and she said
[58:28] that's right brother branham her husband
[58:30] and they had her out in a creek and they
[58:32] had to use artificial respiration and
[58:34] put on pressure and they had to get a
[58:35] machine and pump the water out of her
[58:38] she had her skirt on and they was having
[58:39] a picnic she was out there and stepped
[58:41] in some sand slipped off
[58:42] over her head and strangled in the water
[58:44] they didn't notice her
[58:46] directly they seen her coming up and
[58:47] down and they run in and got her and
[58:49] brought her out and said
[58:50] she almost died and i said to
[58:53] mom that was her time to go
[58:58] but god in his mercy
[59:02] waited until the family got right
[59:08] his ways are higher
[59:11] than our ways
[59:16] his thoughts are not our thoughts
[59:21] next quote says so god knows what he's
[59:24] doing
[59:29] next quote
[59:33] one that starts god knows what he's
[59:35] doing
[59:39] let me say that again can i get an amen
[59:41] back back to that one please
[59:43] back to the one before
[59:47] god knows what he's doing
[59:50] if you don't get anything else today
[59:53] grow up
[59:55] mature settle down
[59:58] and anchor in the truth
[1:00:01] that god knows what he's doing
[1:00:05] let him do it his way
[1:00:08] the lord probably would have told me
[1:00:10] that if i hadn't taken the attitude that
[1:00:12] i did
[1:00:13] lord you owe me to tell me about that he
[1:00:16] don't owe you nothing
[1:00:18] i stood in a meeting one night and heard
[1:00:20] an evangelist praying
[1:00:21] for a sick person said god i command you
[1:00:24] to heal this person
[1:00:26] who command god it isn't even
[1:00:28] intelligent
[1:00:35] because that god he does what he wants
[1:00:39] to
[1:00:41] can the clay say to the potter why did
[1:00:43] you make me thus
[1:00:46] see certainly not but if the prophet
[1:00:49] will keep still and then seek the lord
[1:00:52] for the answer
[1:00:54] there's the answer there i say amen
[1:01:00] keep still and seek the answer there's
[1:01:03] the answer
[1:01:04] i could word that that way seek sit
[1:01:07] still and seek the answer
[1:01:11] and that's the answer
[1:01:14] he may not give you all the details
[1:01:18] but there's the answer
[1:01:29] amen praise the lord
[1:01:38] i really i really love the lord this
[1:01:41] morning
[1:01:42] i trust that you love him amen
[1:01:47] i really love him and i i want to i want
[1:01:52] to grow
[1:01:56] i want to trust him more
[1:01:59] i don't trust a lot of people and you
[1:02:01] don't either
[1:02:04] and if i trust people i trust the god
[1:02:06] that's in them
[1:02:09] but i have a god that i can trust when
[1:02:11] everyone else fails i have a god i can
[1:02:13] trust
[1:02:16] and i want to be faithful to him
[1:02:19] no matter what outcome is happening
[1:02:22] and if i'm i i'm not against it all in
[1:02:25] faith believing that something for the
[1:02:27] impossible i'm not against that
[1:02:28] we should do that but don't predetermine
[1:02:32] the outcome the way it's going to happen
[1:02:35] if it lingers if you've been praying
[1:02:38] about something
[1:02:39] for 10 years you just keep praying
[1:02:42] that's right
[1:02:44] because it may linger but if it's of god
[1:02:48] it will come it will come
[1:02:51] i want to be a real christian i want to
[1:02:54] be a
[1:02:55] growing christian i want to be led by
[1:02:58] the spirit of god
[1:03:00] not my own mind not my own emotions
[1:03:05] i want them to heal the hurt that would
[1:03:07] be within me
[1:03:09] and the anger
[1:03:12] i was telling the young people friday
[1:03:14] night we had such a really nice time
[1:03:16] friday night at the house just such a
[1:03:17] holy spirit really came down and just
[1:03:20] just a precious time
[1:03:24] i just i was honest with the youth and i
[1:03:27] said you know what i was
[1:03:30] angry at a few people today
[1:03:34] and i had to bring it to the lord i just
[1:03:37] but i want to get to the place that
[1:03:41] i admit there's an emotion there of
[1:03:43] anger i can't deny it
[1:03:45] but i don't want to let it eat at me
[1:03:49] and what growing me out of it is just
[1:03:50] saying you know what
[1:03:52] i get the opportunity to spoke to speak
[1:03:54] to the next generation tonight
[1:03:55] so i'm going to forget all those people
[1:03:57] who've done me wrong
[1:03:59] and i'm looking to the new generation to
[1:04:00] teach them
[1:04:02] how to deal with their anger
[1:04:06] how to get married
[1:04:11] what good friendships are what bad
[1:04:13] friendships are
[1:04:14] i get the opportunity to influence the
[1:04:17] next generation and that's a wonderful
[1:04:19] thing
[1:04:19] it brings joy to my heart but i want
[1:04:22] them to see me
[1:04:24] always growing whether i'm
[1:04:28] 80 years old i want them to always see
[1:04:31] me
[1:04:32] if i do wrong to repent
[1:04:37] i make it right if i'm unfaithful
[1:04:40] i'm praying saying lord bring more
[1:04:42] faithfulness in me
[1:04:44] the children and the young people are
[1:04:46] watching us older ones
[1:04:48] our lives are priorities they're
[1:04:50] watching us
[1:04:52] we can't be like jonah and act alone
[1:04:55] self-focused
[1:04:56] it's all about jonah his anger
[1:05:00] his outcome how he looked through it all
[1:05:02] got to forget all that
