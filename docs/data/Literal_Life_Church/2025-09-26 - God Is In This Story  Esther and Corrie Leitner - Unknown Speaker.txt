God Is In This Story

There's torn up pages in this book
Words that tell me I'm no good
Chapters that defined me for so long
But the hands of grace and endless love
Dusted off and picked me up
Told my heart that hope is never gone
God is in this story
God is in the details
Even in the broken parts
He holds my heart, He never fails
When I'm at my weakest
I will trust in Jesus
Always in the highs and lows
The One who goes before me
God is in this story
So if the storm you're walking through
Feels like it's too much and you
Wonder if He even cares at all
Well, hold on tight to what you know
He promised He won't let you go
Your song of healing's written in His scars
God is in this story
God is in the details
Even in the broken parts
He holds my heart, He never fails
When I'm at my weakest
I will trust in Jesus
Always in the highs and lows
The One who goes before me
God is in this story
If it reads like addiction
If it reads like disease
He's the One who frees the prisoner
He's the healer of all things
If it reads like depression
If it reads broken home
He's the One who holds your sorrow
He won't leave you here alone
God is in this story
God is in the details
Even in the broken parts
He holds my heart, He never fails
When I'm at my weakest
I will trust in Jesus
Always in the highs and lows
The One who goes before me
Always in the highs and lows
The One who goes before me
God is in this story (you're in this story)
God is in my story (right here in my story)

[Music] There's torn up pages in this book. Words that I'm good for so long. But the hands of grace and endless love dusted off and picked me up. Told my heart that hope is never gone. God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fills. When I'm at my weakest, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the highs and lows. The one who goes before me. God is in this story. So if the storm you're walking through feels like it's too much and you wonder if he even cares at all. Well hold on tight to what you know. He's promised he won't let you go. A song of feelings written in his scars. God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm at my weakest, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the highest low, the one who rose before me. God is in this story. And if it like addiction, if it like disease, he's the one who frees the prisoner. He's the healer of all things. And if it like depression, if it is broken home, he's the one who holds your sorrow. He won't leave you here alone. &gt;&gt; God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm kissed, I will trust in Jesus.
