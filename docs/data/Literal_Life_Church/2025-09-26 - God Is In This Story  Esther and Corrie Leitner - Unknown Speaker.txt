========================================

[Music] There's torn up pages in this book. Words that I'm good for so long. But the hands of grace and endless love dusted off and picked me up. Told my heart that hope is never gone. God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fills. When I'm at my weakest, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the highs and lows. The one who goes before me. God is in this story. So if the storm you're walking through feels like it's too much and you wonder if he even cares at all. Well hold on tight to what you know. He's promised he won't let you go. A song of feelings written in his scars. God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm at my weakest, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the highest low, the one who rose before me. God is in this story. And if it like addiction, if it like disease, he's the one who frees the prisoner. He's the healer of all things. And if it like depression, if it is broken home, he's the one who holds your sorrow. He won't leave you here alone. &gt;&gt; God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm kissed, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the high and lows. The one who goes before me. God is in this story. Oh, God is in my story. &gt;&gt; He's in this story. &gt;&gt; God is in this story. God is in this story. God is in your story. It's my dream story. [Music] Hallelujah. Glory. Praise God.
