[0:00] nation uh under looking at both
[0:03] kings that were anointed by the same
[0:05] prophet and come under the same
[0:07] uh anointing of god and yet there's so
[0:10] such a different choice
[0:11] and one choice is by the people and one
[0:14] choice
[0:14] is god's choice so we find in here a
[0:17] tremendous lesson
[0:19] not only in the message in our in in the
[0:21] last days message and
[0:23] things that have happened in the message
[0:24] and things that have
[0:26] transpired in our history of maybe 60 70
[0:30] years now in the last days message we
[0:32] see so many things
[0:33] played that has played out but this also
[0:37] would be a subject that has so much to
[0:39] it
[0:40] that we examine ourselves and examine
[0:42] our own lives examine the choices that
[0:45] we make
[0:46] it is so important that we come to the
[0:48] place to say lord
[0:49] i really want your choice in my life
[0:52] because i know what my choices can get
[0:55] me in
[0:56] and i want to really surrender surrender
[0:59] thank god they sang the song
[1:00] i surrender this morning because that's
[1:02] what it comes down to is trusting
[1:04] god's choice and waiting for god's
[1:07] choice before we would choose something
[1:09] that god would even bless god would
[1:11] anoint and god would say
[1:12] go ahead and do it but it's not god's
[1:14] choice
[1:16] and i trust you learned something a
[1:17] couple weeks ago but i want to continue
[1:19] because there's so
[1:20] much revelation related to the story of
[1:23] david and saul
[1:24] and so just to have a care for those who
[1:28] maybe didn't hear it
[1:29] and to bring you up a little bit saul
[1:31] was the people's choice
[1:33] david was god's choice but both choices
[1:36] were approved by god
[1:37] both kings were anointed the same way
[1:40] with the same anointing oil
[1:41] that went on their head both were both
[1:44] choices were under the same prophet
[1:46] under the same message
[1:48] there are two different forms of
[1:50] leadership
[1:51] one form of leadership that the people
[1:53] chose i want this type of leadership
[1:55] and one that god says this is the leader
[1:57] that i want to give you
[1:58] to lead your life and that's significant
[2:01] in our lives because we can
[2:02] choose the thing that leads our lives
[2:05] and influences our life
[2:07] and then we know that god has his choice
[2:10] of how our lives are led
[2:12] praise the lord so god let them have
[2:16] their choice
[2:16] because they wanted it so bad and then
[2:19] he warned them of the type of leading of
[2:20] their life that
[2:21] what it would do and they still wanted
[2:23] it after god warned them
[2:26] we have been blessed in the last days to
[2:29] receive a message of restoration and in
[2:32] that message of restoration
[2:34] we have seen a restoration of truths
[2:37] that have been lost
[2:39] many of them hundreds of truths that
[2:40] have been lost through the church ages
[2:42] have been restored to us through the
[2:44] message of the last days
[2:46] but one very important truth that we
[2:48] lost that got restored
[2:50] as brother branham preached it and
[2:51] anointed ones at the end time
[2:54] one of the great truths that was
[2:55] restored is the truth that the rain
[2:58] the holy spirit the anointing can fall
[3:01] on the just and on the unjust the rain
[3:05] can fall
[3:05] on the just and the unjust and that was
[3:07] in the bible but we didn't realize how
[3:10] deep this truth was to realize
[3:12] that you can have the rain falling and
[3:15] some of the things that it's falling on
[3:17] is false it's not right it's false
[3:19] doctrine it's a false vessel
[3:21] and yet they can be anointed under the
[3:23] same holy spirit as the true thing
[3:25] that's a hard thing to swallow we
[3:27] actually wonder why would god anoint
[3:29] something like that why would god do it
[3:31] well a lot of the reason is because the
[3:32] people
[3:33] choose something and they want it so bad
[3:35] god says all right go with it and god
[3:37] says i'll even anoint it but it's not my
[3:39] choice
[3:41] but the rain falls on the just and the
[3:43] unjust and this is the thing that we
[3:45] learn and anointed ones at the end time
[3:46] there's so many things that can be
[3:49] done under even the true anointing
[3:52] but they may not be god's perfect choice
[3:56] can i say that again there are so many
[3:58] things that can happen
[4:00] under the anointing even in this message
[4:03] but
[4:03] are they god's choice or not
[4:07] jesus said it when he says false christ
[4:10] will arrive as
[4:11] rise in the end time and christ means
[4:13] the anointed one
[4:14] so false christ which teaches us and he
[4:18] said
[4:18] the spirits would be so close in the
[4:20] last days it would deceive the very
[4:22] elect if possible
[4:23] but the elect won't be deceived because
[4:25] she receives a revelation
[4:26] of what's the true and what's the wrong
[4:28] but it's not here's how it is
[4:30] we because we've been taught this and
[4:32] this truth has been restored
[4:34] we in the end time cannot judge
[4:36] something just
[4:37] by the anointing of it
[4:41] we cannot judge things just because it's
[4:44] blessed
[4:46] we have to think deeper than that we
[4:49] have to seek god
[4:50] deeper than that can you say we cannot
[4:52] live on just a
[4:53] feeling that we're good with god we
[4:55] can't live with when uh
[4:57] when the hair stands up on our arms
[4:59] sometimes in the presence of the lord
[5:01] that's fine and we enjoy it but we've
[5:03] got to live
[5:04] deeper than just an anointing can you
[5:06] say man
[5:07] we cannot trust just because something
[5:09] is anointed
[5:10] we have to go deeper to say god i
[5:13] surrender to your choice and your will
[5:16] because we realize somebody can be
[5:18] completely out of the will of god
[5:20] and still anointed for a service
[5:24] praise the lord stick with me today i
[5:26] believe that we can learn something
[5:27] so it's it's so close and christ
[5:31] anointed one
[5:32] and that word in the bible is christ
[5:34] plural not one christ but
[5:36] many anointed ones many christ and so
[5:38] it's not the anointing that's false
[5:41] it's the vessel that's false and many
[5:45] times it's the preaching
[5:46] that's false somebody can be preaching
[5:50] false doctrine and get up and pray for
[5:53] somebody
[5:53] even prophesy and the prophecy come true
[5:58] and yet the vessel's faults are what he
[6:00] preaches his faults
[6:02] now i don't understand all of that but
[6:04] all i know is god simplified it for me
[6:06] when he says the rain falls
[6:08] on the just and the unjust and over time
[6:12] we will see the results just like with
[6:14] saul and david
[6:15] over time we will see who was the
[6:18] people's choice
[6:19] and who was god's choice in this message
[6:22] we will see over time what was people
[6:25] choosing their own way of the message
[6:27] and david rising up christ in the
[6:29] message
[6:30] and we're starting to see it more and
[6:32] more and more and i am rejoicing
[6:34] i'm excited i could some after last
[6:37] sunday i could just run the aisles
[6:38] of what god is speaking to us why
[6:40] because we're seeing david the anointed
[6:42] rising up god's choice for what should
[6:45] be the leadership in this message
[6:47] not man's leadership not dictatorship
[6:49] can you say amen
[6:50] not an angry man like saul not a man
[6:52] that disobeyed god like saul
[6:54] but god choosing for his people true
[6:57] pastors
[6:57] true leadership christ rising up in the
[7:00] message
[7:01] can you say amen so
[7:05] it a person let me just move on from
[7:07] that subject of knowing once because
[7:08] that just keeps going on
[7:10] but when a truth is given to us we don't
[7:12] judge it by the prophecy or how anointed
[7:14] it feels
[7:15] we judge it by the word of god and this
[7:17] is solemn david it's a great example
[7:19] with saul and david because both
[7:21] were anointed under the same prophet as
[7:22] we we preached to you
[7:24] so it is too true today not only to
[7:27] situations within our ranks
[7:29] and around the world but it's true to
[7:31] our lives is that god when we want
[7:34] something so bad
[7:35] god actually lets us have it
[7:40] if you even pray for something so bad
[7:43] god actually
[7:44] can let you have it and let it and he
[7:46] lets it go
[7:48] and then we begin to live with those
[7:50] things in the message we live with those
[7:52] things that's the people's choice
[7:54] instead of god's
[7:55] but but thank god he raises eventually
[7:58] he raises david up
[8:01] there's a christ there's a david of this
[8:04] message
[8:05] i hope that's not mysterious to you
[8:08] but there's a david that god raises up
[8:11] eventually and god
[8:12] anoints and in the midst of all the
[8:15] the mess that saul caused
[8:18] thank god for his grace that he sends us
[8:20] to david
[8:22] because if we're left with saul the
[8:24] people's choice we'd be in trouble
[8:26] if you're left with your own choices in
[8:28] life even as a christian
[8:30] you're in trouble come on raise your
[8:32] hand
[8:34] and by god's grace in our lives he lets
[8:36] us go on
[8:37] he lets us go on he we see the results
[8:39] of the choice
[8:40] there's time there that even in saul and
[8:42] david's life and we want to get into it
[8:44] down the road
[8:45] as we have time but you see there was a
[8:47] season
[8:48] that god chose saul because the people's
[8:50] choice there was a season that he
[8:52] anointed david but he wasn't king yet
[8:54] and so saul and david were there and
[8:57] conflicts began
[8:58] all these conflicts begin between the
[9:00] two leaderships going on
[9:02] and then eventually god faced saul out
[9:05] completely and finally we get to see
[9:07] what david's leadership is like
[9:09] all those phases all those cycles can
[9:11] even happen in your life
[9:12] that you begin to look upon your choices
[9:15] down the road and you see oh
[9:17] god forgive me that was my choice back
[9:19] there now i'm living with this
[9:21] god forgive me god raise up the david in
[9:24] my life
[9:25] let christ rule and reign in my life
[9:28] hallelujah so it's true to our lives
[9:33] and after a season god raises up his
[9:37] choice of leadership for our lives
[9:39] and uh so i want to talk about today i
[9:42] want to talk about behold what you chose
[9:44] behold the king you chose samuel is
[9:47] saying
[9:48] i want you to start beholding the kind
[9:50] of choice that you made
[9:52] behold the king that you chose
[9:57] because god was saying i want you to
[9:59] stand back and i'm going to
[10:00] by the grace of god do that look at the
[10:02] choices we make
[10:03] behold the king you chose
[10:06] and uh then the conflict between
[10:10] saul and david and the conflicts that we
[10:12] have
[10:13] between the will of god between us
[10:15] fighting for our own way
[10:17] the jealousy that was be from saul to
[10:19] david
[10:20] and then finally if we can get to it
[10:22] talking more about
[10:23] saul being taken out of the picture and
[10:25] the people submitting to david as a true
[10:28] leadership
[10:29] finally submitting to god's choice after
[10:32] years i don't know how many years it was
[10:34] i think it was two before david was
[10:36] anointed
[10:37] saul reigned two years and then we've
[10:39] had the many years of
[10:40] exile of david and the tension between
[10:43] them so i don't know i'll have to look
[10:44] that up how many years it was but
[10:46] there's many years that that reflects
[10:47] our lives can you say amen
[10:50] and we come to the place of what a full
[10:52] final surrender
[10:53] to god's leadership in our lives and
[10:57] we we start to finally submit to god's
[10:59] choice
[11:00] after many years now as we look at our
[11:02] own lives i like to bring it down where
[11:04] we live
[11:05] as we look at our own lives god gives us
[11:08] grace
[11:09] with our own choices god says i'll let
[11:12] you have it
[11:13] i wish i wish god would uh just come at
[11:17] the beginning and just
[11:18] slap me in the face you know
[11:21] for so many things in my life that i
[11:24] wish god would have come and just
[11:25] slapped me and said here is my will this
[11:28] is
[11:29] clear this is distinct and just stop the
[11:32] whole process from the very beginning
[11:34] how many would say amen to that
[11:35] i wish god would just sadly say do this
[11:38] and i would surrender and do it
[11:40] but god never works that way in our
[11:43] lives
[11:44] because he doesn't force you to do
[11:46] anything
[11:47] god doesn't override your free more
[11:50] agency
[11:51] he didn't do it with adam and eve and
[11:53] brother branham says it's not fair if he
[11:55] would start doing that now
[11:57] it's not fair under the same basis as
[11:59] adam and eve
[12:00] you're he said today you're under the
[12:02] same basis
[12:03] as adam and eve you have free moral
[12:05] agency
[12:06] you have your own choice you have
[12:09] choices to make in your life
[12:10] who you're going to marry what career
[12:12] you're going to have as you come to a
[12:13] young team
[12:14] you start to get more choices you get
[12:16] liberties to make your own choice
[12:17] and then through life as parents you're
[12:19] making choices every day
[12:21] what do i allow what do i not allow your
[12:23] choices choices joy
[12:24] you can get weary parents can get weary
[12:26] of the choices they have to make
[12:28] and then they get teenagers and they get
[12:30] very very weary
[12:31] of the choices they're having to make in
[12:33] the process of raising teenagers
[12:36] and uh strung out just weary of it
[12:39] because you have to make calls all the
[12:41] time
[12:42] and you have to really begin to depend
[12:43] on the lord but i wish the lord would
[12:45] just come at the beginning and say this
[12:46] is what
[12:47] you're supposed to do and do it but god
[12:49] has never worked that way in our lives
[12:52] god will not work that way in our lives
[12:54] if we're fighting for a way and a choice
[12:56] our only
[12:57] he's going to give it to us
[13:02] he's going to give it to us he's going
[13:04] to let us he's going to let us go
[13:07] and and deal with our own choices
[13:10] and he won't override our choice
[13:14] our lord jesus is a gentleman that's
[13:17] what brother branham referred to
[13:19] he's a gentleman and he he's got that
[13:22] gentleman
[13:22] even when he was in the prayer line with
[13:24] the people he said the holy spirit's a
[13:26] gentleman
[13:26] he just he's not forcing anything can
[13:29] you say amen
[13:30] what are these people that are leaving
[13:32] you know the truth and saying
[13:33] i was forced to do this i was forced to
[13:35] do that before that
[13:36] it wasn't the holy spirit forcing you to
[13:38] do it maybe human got involved there
[13:41] maybe a parent somebody got human
[13:42] and maybe they were forcing you but i
[13:44] want to tell you it never was the lord
[13:46] jesus christ forcing you
[13:48] to do anything
[13:52] now he may present a picture he may do
[13:54] like he did samuel say if you choose
[13:56] this
[13:56] this is where you're going he may warn
[13:58] you he may put the whole picture before
[14:00] you
[14:00] but he will never force you to do
[14:02] anything and override
[14:04] your override your will and override
[14:06] your free war agency
[14:08] he lets us go can you say amen that's
[14:11] the way the nature is of the holy spirit
[14:13] he's a gentleman and so god did not
[14:15] drive you away from the message
[14:17] god did not drive you away by forcing
[14:20] you to do anything
[14:21] you know if you feel that you have been
[14:23] forced i would
[14:24] here's what i would do is that give the
[14:26] message another chance give the holy
[14:28] spirit another chance
[14:30] shut out all the past and say i'm just
[14:32] looking at the lord and what he wants in
[14:34] my life
[14:35] and look to him and get a fresh look at
[14:37] the holy spirit
[14:38] a fresh look at the word of god a fresh
[14:41] look at the message of the hour
[14:44] because if you begin to feed on the word
[14:46] and get close to the holy spirit and
[14:47] deeper
[14:48] you'll find the gentleman of the holy
[14:50] spirit works with you
[14:52] a completely different way
[14:55] there's no force to this
[14:58] there's no pressures to this except for
[15:00] the pressure of of us
[15:02] living a godly life suffering
[15:03] persecution because people will make fun
[15:05] of us that's going to come with it can't
[15:06] guarantee that it won't
[15:07] it'll come with it amen and so
[15:11] this truth then runs through the whole
[15:14] bible then
[15:15] eve took her own choice she brought adam
[15:17] in to make the own choice over god's
[15:19] word and how to do it
[15:20] the only way to try to fulfill the way
[15:22] they chose their way to fulfill the word
[15:24] multiply and replenish the earth god's
[15:26] way was through the spoken word of god
[15:28] he made her own choice through the
[15:29] serpent's influence eve made her own
[15:31] choice through the serpent's influence
[15:33] to bring god's promise to pass by her
[15:36] own choice
[15:38] this is all through the bible abraham
[15:39] and ishmael abraham
[15:41] and then abraham had ishmael and ishmael
[15:44] was not god's choice
[15:45] ishmael was their own choice him and
[15:48] sarah
[15:48] ishmael was not god's choice can you say
[15:51] amen
[15:51] and later in their lives we see the
[15:53] conflict and the contrast between
[15:56] ishmael and isaac
[15:57] until in one stage in abraham's life he
[16:00] took ishmael and held him up before the
[16:02] lord and said
[16:02] oh that ishmael may live before thee
[16:04] please accept him
[16:06] the promise is supposed to come please
[16:08] take ishmael and god said no
[16:09] that's not my choice
[16:13] we bring our decisions and choices and
[16:17] so bad for god to accept it
[16:22] but he said no that's not my choice
[16:24] jacob and esau
[16:26] jacob was god's choice esau was not
[16:29] god's choice as the
[16:30] as the as the one to receive the
[16:32] blessing
[16:33] one is god's choice joseph and his
[16:35] brothers joseph was god's choice
[16:38] his brother's attention came over time
[16:41] and over time
[16:41] god showed his own brothers who god's
[16:44] choice really was
[16:45] a long time it's all through the bible
[16:48] of men making their own choice for
[16:50] something
[16:50] and the brothers getting jealous of
[16:52] god's choice of joseph but you couldn't
[16:54] change joseph was god's choice
[16:56] and it took them years of hardships to
[16:59] finally realize
[17:01] i submit i submit to god's
[17:04] choice
[17:07] i just want you to notice that it's not
[17:10] a choice in our lives of
[17:12] choosing god we choose god that's not
[17:15] what i'm talking about
[17:17] it's a choice of his will in our lives
[17:19] over
[17:20] our own will you talk about
[17:23] israel and saul and david they weren't
[17:25] unbelievers they're the children of
[17:27] israel
[17:28] they're already serving god they're
[17:29] already worshiping god
[17:31] i'm talking about people within the
[17:32] church that are already worshiping god
[17:35] i'm not talking about the choice you
[17:36] made to start serving the lord and get
[17:38] salvation i'm not talking about i'm
[17:39] talking about the choice you make every
[17:41] day
[17:41] between your choice and god's choice
[17:44] the message to the last days has come to
[17:46] us
[17:47] with a a special call to a total
[17:51] surrender i said it last a couple of
[17:53] sundays ago
[17:54] nothing less than a total surrender and
[17:58] the thing of a total surrender does not
[18:00] fit in this age at all a total surrender
[18:02] to god in the word
[18:03] does not fit for this age at all it's a
[18:05] challenge but the message
[18:07] is this way the message which you feed
[18:09] on it is nature this way
[18:12] calling for a total surrender and it's
[18:14] such in contrast to the nature of the
[18:16] age
[18:17] that it's difficult for people they get
[18:19] caught in between the message was sent
[18:21] the way that it was sent from god
[18:24] because it came in a church age where
[18:26] the people
[18:28] exercise their own choices so much
[18:33] they take or leave what they want of the
[18:36] word of god
[18:38] i'm going to be very straight for the
[18:40] next 5 ten minutes
[18:42] and uh you you can listen i'm not
[18:44] expecting too many amens
[18:46] but i've got to say a few things it's a
[18:49] it's the laodicean age which means
[18:51] people's rights
[18:54] people's rights later seeing and that's
[18:56] not the world as much as the church
[18:58] literally was the church world
[19:00] people christian people exercising their
[19:02] rights
[19:03] i have a right to do this i have a right
[19:04] to do that i have a right to wear what i
[19:07] want to wear i have a right to then
[19:08] guess what
[19:09] you do it's a free country you have a
[19:11] right to do
[19:12] it you can claim your rights as an
[19:14] american
[19:15] you can claim your rights as a human
[19:17] being that's what the whole thing
[19:19] teaches us don't override the rights of
[19:21] the people
[19:21] and we're thankful for that in our
[19:23] country that we have a right to worship
[19:25] god the way that we want to worship can
[19:27] you say amen
[19:28] we're thankful for that our laws are set
[19:30] up that way but when you come to serving
[19:32] the lord then we realize
[19:33] if you start exercising your own rights
[19:36] as an american
[19:37] it doesn't fit when the holy spirit's
[19:39] trying to take you to a deeper life
[19:42] you're trying to try a political freedom
[19:44] that you have
[19:45] to the word of god and it just doesn't
[19:47] go together
[19:48] because he will love you when you come
[19:50] into his atmosphere he will
[19:52] love you and move you and and just brood
[19:54] over you
[19:55] and love you to a place of a complete
[19:58] trust and a complete surrender
[20:00] it's a different it's a different
[20:02] atmosphere it's a different thing
[20:05] and so then god sends us a message that
[20:09] calls for this surrender in so many at
[20:11] so many levels
[20:13] our sisters in what they wear our
[20:16] brothers
[20:17] and how they rule their homes our
[20:19] marriages
[20:20] our families our what we believe what we
[20:23] don't believe
[20:24] the message came right in the middle of
[20:26] people's rights
[20:30] it's almost like god has a sense of
[20:32] humor i'm going to send a message
[20:34] right in the middle of the spirit in the
[20:36] church of people's rights and exercising
[20:38] them
[20:39] i'm going to do it the way that i want
[20:41] to do it i have a right as an american
[20:43] to do it
[20:44] and i know the message would say that
[20:46] but i want this and guess what god says
[20:48] go right ahead go right ahead you can
[20:51] choose that you can have it
[20:53] you can watch it you can wear it it's a
[20:55] free country
[20:57] and then the message comes and out of
[20:59] love he just says
[21:00] but this is my choice for what a woman
[21:03] wears
[21:06] so now this is struggle god gave his
[21:08] choice through a prophet
[21:10] god said this is the way this is the
[21:12] definition of modesty
[21:15] and then the world's over here and
[21:17] they've got the church
[21:19] this definition of modesty can you say
[21:22] man
[21:22] and god's not going to come over and say
[21:24] get rid of that you're getting no no
[21:26] that's not the way he works
[21:27] but it is a difference it's just god's
[21:29] choice and he loved the women
[21:31] of god this last generation so much that
[21:33] he was so specific
[21:35] say here's my choice from the for the
[21:37] lovely
[21:38] women of god for the last days right in
[21:40] the middle where a woman
[21:42] exercises her own rights as it were
[21:45] exercises her
[21:46] rights to wear what she wants to choose
[21:48] to have an abortion or not
[21:49] it's all about i choose this even to
[21:52] kill a baby
[21:55] how far can choice go in people's rights
[21:57] in laodicea that's how far it goes
[22:02] we have a right to choose whether we
[22:05] want to have a baby or not
[22:08] but there's a lot of other rights that
[22:09] are being taken away from us
[22:11] isn't that funny you give that woman a
[22:14] right to choose whether to abort that
[22:16] baby or not
[22:17] but you don't have a choice whether you
[22:19] take this medicine or not
[22:24] it's all messed up and it becomes more
[22:27] and more corrupt all the time
[22:29] we got to find our hope and our trust in
[22:32] our walk with the lord
[22:33] and as you sang this morning take me
[22:35] deeper that's got to become a prayer in
[22:37] your life
[22:38] get away from the people's rights and
[22:40] say god what is it that you want from my
[22:42] life
[22:42] can you say man we need christians today
[22:45] we don't need christians that are
[22:47] nominal christians they're just
[22:48] exercising their rights every day we
[22:49] need people to say what does the words
[22:51] what is god's choice for what i do is
[22:54] that okay with everybody
[22:56] and then brother adam he's a bit he's
[22:58] not nervous but he
[23:00] when he says things and i may read a few
[23:02] of them this morning but
[23:03] uh just a small quote you guys don't
[23:05] have it up there this is i'm pulling
[23:07] this out of where he's talking about
[23:08] women's dress he said a woman wearing
[23:10] immoral clothes indecently
[23:11] she is to be judged at the judgment bar
[23:14] as a street prostitute
[23:16] that sounds awful strange and that's
[23:19] what he said
[23:20] that sounds awful strange read choosing
[23:22] of a bride
[23:23] that says i don't know if i should say
[23:25] this or not i don't know
[23:26] but we got to speak truth you know and
[23:28] he's this seems awful
[23:29] why is it strange people's rights
[23:34] but he's bringing if you start studying
[23:35] the word of god he's dead on
[23:41] you don't dress yourself right and you
[23:44] draw a man's lust
[23:46] you're just as guilty as his lust if you
[23:49] intentionally do it to draw lust
[23:52] now you're not responsible for what he
[23:54] does but you're responsible for you and
[23:55] he says
[23:56] you'll be guilty for adultery just like
[23:58] the bible says he's guilty for adultery
[24:00] for lusting after a woman
[24:01] but you presented yourself that way
[24:04] so a woman standing saying i have a
[24:06] right to wear anything i want to wear or
[24:08] not wear anything i want to wear
[24:12] go ahead you can come here to this
[24:15] church and wear things that's not right
[24:18] but you're probably going to hear the
[24:19] truth on it it might be uncomfortable
[24:22] sometimes
[24:23] you're going to lean a certain way and
[24:26] the service will lead away and god will
[24:28] warn you no doubt
[24:29] better stop leaning that way you can
[24:31] paint your toenails
[24:32] different colors and your fingernails
[24:34] different colors than a natural color
[24:35] you can trim and cut your hair and tight
[24:38] skirts and shorter and shorter skirts
[24:40] all the times it seems like
[24:41] tight skirts more and more eyeliner more
[24:44] and more makeup
[24:45] caked on see-through blouses
[24:48] i just want to let you know that's your
[24:51] choice
[24:53] you can come it's your choice but it's
[24:56] not god's choice
[24:58] i love you and also
[25:01] please don't assume that brother paul
[25:03] allows those things just because
[25:05] somebody goes to the church like that
[25:06] i don't i believe that god gave us his
[25:10] choice of what a woman should wear
[25:13] and i trust them men can feed on movies
[25:15] and pornography
[25:17] and excite their lusts come right to
[25:18] church bound by pornography
[25:21] privately looking at things that they
[25:22] shouldn't look at whether it be through
[25:24] the wrong kind of video games or the
[25:25] wrong kind of
[25:26] tv that they're watching and they're
[25:28] exercising they're right i'm going to
[25:29] have this
[25:30] uncensored tv in my home or on my phone
[25:33] you can still be coming to church get
[25:34] under the anointing all these other
[25:36] things
[25:36] you can watch extreme violent videos and
[25:38] play those games and be a gamer
[25:40] instead of choosing the right type of
[25:42] entertainment
[25:44] but you're going to know that's your own
[25:47] choice
[25:49] that's not god's choice for your life
[25:51] just remember that
[25:52] you yeah do you have a right to do it
[25:54] yeah
[25:56] but that's your own choice
[26:01] and a man that lets his wife do these
[26:03] things and stay
[26:04] silent about it you need something
[26:07] deeper in your life
[26:10] you didn't feed on the message enough to
[26:12] know
[26:13] that your wife is exercising her choice
[26:16] to wear what she wants to wear
[26:18] and cut what she wants to cut and not
[26:20] god's choice and you're letting her do
[26:22] it
[26:22] you need a deeper walk with the lord my
[26:24] brother
[26:25] you can come to this church and we have
[26:27] them here but don't ever think that
[26:29] that's what we preach from this pulpit
[26:31] you can come to the church believe the
[26:32] prophet and you will enjoy the anointing
[26:34] that falls
[26:36] but here i want to let you know you can
[26:38] wear earrings you can cut your hair you
[26:40] can wear pants
[26:41] still believe the message there's so
[26:42] many of them now you can pay your tithes
[26:45] to a message church and cut your hair
[26:48] no one's stopping you from doing that
[26:50] you should know
[26:52] that's your choice but it's not god's
[26:54] choice
[27:01] let's bring a positive here just and
[27:03] show
[27:05] the power of redemption that first quote
[27:07] that we have up there
[27:09] amen praise the lord
[27:17] it's not just the dress i talked a
[27:19] couple sundays ago about
[27:23] parents who choose their own leadership
[27:25] to raise their children
[27:26] in the message that's just as bad
[27:29] as someone wearing the wrong thing it's
[27:31] their own choice how to want to raise
[27:32] their kids
[27:34] but the word is god's choice and the
[27:36] message is god's choice
[27:38] amen so many things i talked about
[27:40] preachers in the message
[27:42] and even outside the message but in the
[27:44] message and they abuse their people
[27:46] even with the god's anointing on them to
[27:49] preach
[27:51] but they've made their own choice how to
[27:53] lead the people with a soul-like
[27:55] leadership
[27:57] so just like a girl that chooses their
[27:59] own choice of what to wear
[28:00] that preacher's just as guilty when he
[28:02] chooses under the anointing of the
[28:04] message
[28:05] and under the prophet to choose to lead
[28:07] the people in a
[28:08] either a dictatorship or some type of
[28:10] anger or something like that
[28:12] brother that if you're listening that's
[28:14] your own choice that's not the david of
[28:16] this message that's not the christ of
[28:17] this message
[28:19] but brother brahma says now he give us
[28:20] free moral agency if you guys have that
[28:22] quote
[28:23] in um right here in
[28:26] the breach he's given us free more
[28:28] agency it was given to them just as we
[28:30] so as we so to make a choice now adam
[28:33] and eve in the beginning there was a
[28:34] tree of right and wrong before them
[28:36] and the same tree sets before each and
[28:38] every one of us see god isn't doing for
[28:40] adam or eve
[28:41] you say well it's their fault no now
[28:43] it's is it it's your fault
[28:45] you can't place it on adam now you place
[28:47] it on yourself because right and wrong
[28:49] set before you
[28:50] we're on the same basis as adam and eve
[28:52] but you see when we
[28:53] are redeemed listen close now when we
[28:56] are redeemed
[28:57] we no more want our own choice but we
[28:59] want his choice
[29:01] what a powerful quote what a thing that
[29:04] shows the power of redemption over our
[29:06] lives
[29:06] and you may not be all there yet but if
[29:08] your soul has been redeemed
[29:10] you're growing into the power of
[29:11] redemption now some preachers say
[29:13] at that moment that's it it's done but
[29:15] to me the way that i preach it
[29:17] is that a person can be born again and
[29:19] redeemed and they begin a life of growth
[29:21] in the lord
[29:22] they don't get everything they're not
[29:24] perfect a perfectly matured son
[29:26] right there at the altar i disagree with
[29:28] that respectfully to brothers
[29:30] i say when you get the holy ghost and
[29:32] the conversion
[29:33] and god redeems the soul you begin a
[29:35] life of overcoming
[29:37] you haven't overcome anything yet you
[29:39] just started an altar i've got what i
[29:41] need i've been redeemed in my soul
[29:43] but the power of redemption grows you
[29:46] into a son of god who finally says lord
[29:49] i no longer want my own choice i want
[29:52] your choice lord
[29:54] you know how i know that because of
[29:55] experience i've had people they've got
[29:57] the holy spirit they follow
[29:58] many things are taken from their lives
[30:00] it's a wonderful thing but then i watch
[30:02] them in a struggle
[30:03] of exercising their own will over things
[30:05] do i do this do i do that
[30:06] and so they begin a journey of are they
[30:08] going to listen to god's choice
[30:10] or choose their own choice and if they
[30:12] choose as a christian
[30:13] if they choose more and more of their
[30:15] own choice they'll watch the fruits of
[30:17] it for years
[30:20] grace grace grace watch somebody
[30:23] sometimes after 20 years
[30:26] just go through the ringer they didn't
[30:28] have to but they did
[30:29] and then they rise as i was preaching
[30:31] last sunday they rise out of all of that
[30:34] david rises in their lives and they say
[30:37] lord
[30:38] i surrender and he says those are
[30:41] redeemed
[30:42] they no longer want their own choice
[30:46] but we want his choice now adam and eve
[30:48] wanted their own choice they wanted to
[30:49] they wanted to find out what it was that
[30:50] wisdom
[30:51] so they probed into it and it caused
[30:53] death now when a man has been redeemed
[30:55] he don't care anymore for scholarship
[30:56] he'll carry more for the things of the
[30:58] world can you say amen when a man's
[31:00] redeemed he don't care for the things of
[31:01] the world or scholarship
[31:02] the wisdom of the world he don't want no
[31:04] choice at all christ has been his choice
[31:05] and that's all of it
[31:06] he is redeemed he just no more wants to
[31:09] lead himself he don't want nobody to
[31:10] talk him into where to go or what to do
[31:13] he just waits and finds out the choice
[31:15] of his maker
[31:16] oh can i go back and read that again he
[31:19] just no more wants to lead himself he
[31:21] don't want to lead himself
[31:23] he don't want nobody to talk him into
[31:25] where to go and what to do
[31:26] he just waits and finds out the choice
[31:29] of his maker
[31:30] see then he goes in the name of his
[31:31] maker when the maker tells them to go
[31:34] see but man seeking wisdom wants to find
[31:36] well this parish
[31:37] is pretty good but they pay me more over
[31:39] yonder so i'll go over there
[31:42] notice the example brother branham uses
[31:44] a very natural example this is a
[31:45] preacher
[31:46] and he's considering taking a parish
[31:48] over here and he's weighing this
[31:50] decision
[31:50] based upon just the money
[31:54] and a lot of us do that where is the
[31:56] more money at but i have watched people
[31:58] make choices solely on an
[32:00] increase in funds but no consideration
[32:03] of their family's spiritual life
[32:05] no consideration of where they're going
[32:07] to go to church no consideration how it
[32:09] might affect their spiritual life
[32:11] justice more money and sons of god
[32:13] cannot make decisions
[32:15] just based upon money because if you're
[32:17] in the will of god you may not get a
[32:18] promotion or more money but if you're in
[32:20] the will of god
[32:21] you're the most blessed person on the
[32:22] face of the earth
[32:24] you might live from paycheck to paycheck
[32:27] but if god has given you revelation
[32:29] you're a rich man your family's rich
[32:32] people
[32:33] we must say god what is your choice and
[32:36] he says
[32:36] maybe i can go over to this parish and
[32:39] this parish
[32:40] would pay me more money over here and
[32:42] they weigh all those decisions
[32:44] but you know then he says pay me more i
[32:47] understand i'll go over there
[32:48] see wisdom and when adam's sin be
[32:50] heeding his wife's reasoning instead of
[32:52] the
[32:52] holding to the word that's what made
[32:54] adam sin his wife reasoned with
[32:55] satan and then produced the product adam
[32:58] and adam turn loose the word
[32:59] and sold out never forget that quote in
[33:02] the breach
[33:03] it says redeemed sons and daughters of
[33:04] god no longer want their own choice
[33:07] they want god's choice god help us can
[33:10] you say amen
[33:12] we're all believers i believe here we
[33:14] all believe the message of the hour but
[33:15] that's not what i'm preaching
[33:17] i'm preaching on a daily basis saying
[33:19] god what is your choice for my family
[33:24] the word of god say about it
[33:27] so number one let's get into this real
[33:29] quickly you can give me a little time
[33:31] today
[33:32] so if he says to behold your choice now
[33:35] why don't we get into this now
[33:36] behold your choice number one
[33:40] we know if we're going to behold the
[33:42] choice that israel made let's talk about
[33:43] what they mean
[33:44] they made their choice upon outward
[33:47] appearance can you say man
[33:51] what is seen not what's unseen so if
[33:54] you're back there in first samuel
[33:56] if you go back there again you read very
[33:58] familiar scriptures about that
[34:00] when they were choosing samuel excuse me
[34:04] saul
[34:04] when samuel was choosing and you don't
[34:07] forget now
[34:08] the reason they were looking for a guy
[34:11] they had already been influenced by
[34:14] watching what kings were in the other
[34:15] nations so
[34:16] their choice was influenced by what do
[34:18] the other nations have
[34:20] what what are the other people doing
[34:22] what's the what's the new modern thing
[34:25] how what kind of leader do they have
[34:27] what do they wear
[34:28] how tall are they what do they look like
[34:30] are they good looking
[34:31] are they ugly so i'm going to get on the
[34:34] internet i'm going to google it i'm
[34:35] going to find
[34:36] what are the i we want a choice for a
[34:38] king can you imagine a choice for a king
[34:40] to lead you
[34:40] under jehovah god and you're going to
[34:42] get on google and the internet and find
[34:44] now what's the other nations doing let's
[34:46] get some influence of what
[34:48] they're wearing i got to make a choice
[34:51] when i go to the store
[34:53] of what i'm going to buy to wear let me
[34:55] get on and see what angelina jolie has
[34:57] been waiting lately
[34:59] let me see what all the other people are
[35:00] wearing no
[35:02] no that's what they did we can't make
[35:04] our choices based upon that
[35:08] and so they chose as you turn with me
[35:10] for
[35:11] first samuel chapter 9. first of all
[35:13] verse 20 verse 19 of first samuel eight
[35:17] never let the people refuse to obey this
[35:19] voice of samuel and they say nay but we
[35:21] will have a king over us
[35:22] that we also may be like all the other
[35:25] nations we have looked it up we have
[35:28] researched this we
[35:30] have googled it i've been to all kinds
[35:32] of websites
[35:33] and this is the type of thing that we
[35:35] need we need it this way
[35:36] because all their influence of their
[35:38] choice they have their own choice but it
[35:40] was influenced
[35:42] by all the other nations and that our
[35:45] king may judge us and go before us and
[35:46] fight our vows and samuel heard all the
[35:48] words of the people
[35:49] and he rehearsed them in theirs of the
[35:50] lord and the lord said to samuel
[35:52] hearken unto their can you imagine this
[35:55] statement underline it in your bible
[35:57] god says for the prophet to hearken
[36:02] to their voice look how much god is
[36:05] willing to
[36:06] just okay they want it so bad
[36:09] they've they've fed on things so much
[36:12] hearken
[36:12] they're supposed to be hearkening to
[36:13] god's voice and god says go ahead and
[36:16] hearken to their voice what they want
[36:19] praise the lord
[36:20] and make them a king and samuel said
[36:21] unto the men of israel go ye every man
[36:23] into his house
[36:24] familiar chapter nine verse one and
[36:26] there was a man of benjamin whose name
[36:27] was kish
[36:28] the son of abal the son of zehor zohor
[36:31] the son of bakarath and the son of a
[36:34] fella
[36:34] and benjamin a benjaminite a mighty man
[36:36] of power and he had a son
[36:38] whose name was saul a choice young man
[36:42] and a goodly and there was not among the
[36:45] children of israel a goodlier person
[36:47] than he from his shoulders and upward
[36:51] he was higher than any of the people
[36:54] all of it is about what's
[36:58] visible i wish i could preach this to
[37:02] are you listening choices made
[37:06] only on what's visible
[37:10] we can't look to the scene we must look
[37:12] to the unseen
[37:13] because the things that are seen are
[37:14] temporal
[37:16] but the things that are unseen are
[37:18] eternal
[37:19] but my brother and sister you can apply
[37:21] that scripture on your everyday
[37:22] decisions
[37:24] we can judge things and make choices
[37:26] this is what i see even at trial
[37:28] and we can quickly make choices but say
[37:30] god no
[37:31] lord i need you to lead me in this
[37:34] because see i can make a choice being a
[37:37] current problem
[37:39] and what's visible
[37:43] let me move on here because i'll get to
[37:44] that in a minute a choice young man a
[37:47] goodly
[37:48] young man so basically it can sum up
[37:52] uh saul and their choice for saul he was
[37:55] tall
[37:56] dark and handsome if you research the
[37:59] words there
[38:00] there is no character there there is no
[38:02] heart there there's no
[38:04] there there's not one line about his
[38:06] character
[38:07] there's not one line about what's in his
[38:09] spirit
[38:10] there's not one line anywhere about it
[38:13] now interesting in a minute
[38:15] you're going to find that it looks like
[38:17] similar things in david but i'm going to
[38:19] show you it's not
[38:20] because he mentions outward things as
[38:21] well but in this just remember
[38:23] there's not one ounce of in this choice
[38:26] of any character or anything how it's
[38:29] going to affect them or what's in his
[38:30] spirit there was a lot of stuff in his
[38:33] spirit
[38:35] jealousy was in there envy was in there
[38:39] anger was in there disobedience was in
[38:42] there
[38:43] and none of them could see it but god
[38:45] did
[38:46] because they were saying this guy is
[38:48] basically head and shoulders above the
[38:50] rest
[38:51] when we looked at the whole crowd of
[38:52] thousand people this guy
[38:54] stands head and shoulders above all the
[38:56] rest so he
[38:57] must be the king to lead us just because
[39:00] he's tall
[39:02] dark and handsome and he was when you
[39:04] research it he
[39:06] had dark complexion like all the jews
[39:07] all all the other ones a darker
[39:09] complexion like all the other men
[39:10] in that day and the women that's what
[39:12] they were okay they were they had that
[39:14] dark skin so in that those features
[39:16] he was the same and that's probably why
[39:18] they chose him in his features
[39:20] and his head and shoulders above the
[39:21] rest he was the same as everybody else
[39:23] so he'll be a good king
[39:24] he was the same that's not necessarily a
[39:27] good choice
[39:28] to make he's a blender he's a mixer
[39:30] brother brown says people choose pastors
[39:32] because they're a good mixer they'll let
[39:34] them do this and then
[39:34] they mix with the people they mix with
[39:36] the things of the world no you don't
[39:38] judge it just because he looks like
[39:40] everybody else what
[39:41] is in the heart amen
[39:44] tall dark and handsome and i'm not so
[39:47] sure some
[39:49] single girls don't use the same choosing
[39:51] method
[39:54] method tall
[39:56] dark handsome oil well
[40:03] but does he own a bible
[40:06] does he know what church he belongs to
[40:09] does he treat his mom
[40:14] what's in that boy's heart but he's tall
[40:17] dark and handsome oil well i mean he's
[40:20] got
[40:20] rich incredibly successful and he's got
[40:23] a lot of money and it's
[40:24] it's all outward look at the car that he
[40:26] drives
[40:29] why am i trying to be practical because
[40:30] this is the way many of us
[40:32] make choices nothing unseen
[40:36] you won't know what's unseen same guy is
[40:39] tall dark and handsome beautiful
[40:42] head and shoulders while the rest works
[40:43] out got all the muscles all those other
[40:45] things
[40:46] same guy that's so strong in his muscles
[40:48] may be completely weak
[40:50] in what he watches on the internet
[40:55] and you go into that marriage and he's
[40:56] bound by pornography and you think
[40:58] you're going to have a normal
[40:59] family relations and sex not going to
[41:02] happen
[41:04] it's going to be trouble down the road
[41:06] but you didn't you wouldn't know that
[41:08] until you
[41:09] get to know the fella and watch his life
[41:12] and watch a girl's life can you say amen
[41:17] a lot of you sitting here married the
[41:19] wrong person you married what i'm
[41:20] preaching about a lot of those things
[41:22] young marriage many times and you made
[41:24] mistakes
[41:26] god's grace has redeemed you here this
[41:28] morning
[41:30] can you say man but young people
[41:32] sometimes think well nobody
[41:33] no no there's people who've been there
[41:35] done that got the t-shirt they made the
[41:37] wrong choice
[41:38] they're they're in a divorce today or
[41:39] another what and so it's it's a
[41:42] difficult thing when you realize but
[41:43] when you go back and
[41:44] behold the choice you made you can say i
[41:46] was making choices
[41:47] based upon just feelings and what felt
[41:50] good and what looked good and
[41:51] and all these other things no heart
[41:54] no character
[41:57] so if you turn with me oh did i finish
[42:00] that so he's tall dark and handsome
[42:02] and so over in chapter 12 in verse 5
[42:06] nope that's not it over in chapter 16
[42:12] verse 6 when he goes to choose jesse's
[42:15] sons and it came to pass when there come
[42:17] that he looked on eliab and said
[42:19] it's one of jesse's sons surely the
[42:21] lord's anointed is before him but the
[42:22] lord said unto samuel look not on his
[42:24] countenance
[42:25] or on his height of stature because i
[42:28] have refused him
[42:30] for the lord seeth not as man seeth
[42:36] that's why we need god's choice for the
[42:39] lord
[42:40] seeth not as man seeth
[42:44] for man looketh on the outward
[42:46] appearance but the lord
[42:47] looketh on the heart
[42:50] and i think it's deeper than just he's
[42:52] got a good heart he's tall darker
[42:54] handsome but he's got a good heart
[42:57] i mean i dropped my fork off the table
[42:59] and he come right by right away and he
[43:01] picked the fork up for me and he set it
[43:03] back on the table and
[43:04] just said god bless you he's got such a
[43:08] good heart about him
[43:10] he's one of the greatest christians i've
[43:12] ever seen well how long have you known
[43:14] him well i just met him there but he's
[43:15] just one of the greatest christians
[43:17] because he picked up my fork kind of
[43:19] smiled at me he was so
[43:21] loving i'm not talking about just
[43:24] somebody with a good heart that gives to
[43:25] charity and works hard
[43:28] i'm talking about a heart that today has
[43:31] the holy ghost in that heart
[43:33] has god on the throne of their heart
[43:37] so god says man looks
[43:40] different than what god does for he look
[43:43] at the network appears but the lord
[43:44] looketh on the heart
[43:45] he goes through a few of her son other
[43:46] sons then they set for david verse 12
[43:48] when he sit and brought him in
[43:50] brought david in now he was ready and
[43:53] with all
[43:54] of a beautiful countenance and uh
[43:57] goodly to look to and the lord said
[43:59] arise anoint him for this
[44:01] is he saul was tall dark and handsome
[44:06] but david was short red and fair
[44:12] so he wasn't because he had fair skin he
[44:15] wasn't like
[44:17] all the rest of them the way he looked
[44:18] he was different he was fair-skinned
[44:20] he was short brother brahm describes it
[44:22] even more and this is the part i like
[44:23] in praise of redheads brother bram says
[44:25] he was a red-haired freckled face
[44:27] little stoop shoulder little boy can i
[44:30] say something in praise of redheads
[44:32] i know a lot of mine's gone it's changed
[44:34] to another color but when i was you
[44:36] asked my mom when i was 13 years old i
[44:38] had bright red hair
[44:40] and many times it was very long because
[44:42] my mom actually liked it long
[44:46] thinking about that one she hates when i
[44:48] cut my thing real short she's like
[44:50] you got curls you should show some of
[44:51] those curls and but what i
[44:53] there's a picture in wisconsin when i
[44:55] was like nine years old
[44:57] and i had an afro of red
[45:00] bright hair my mom wanted everybody to
[45:03] see it why because it's rare
[45:05] it's beautiful you know the price that
[45:08] arab kings give for a bright red-headed
[45:10] girl
[45:11] they're talking a lot of oil wells a lot
[45:13] of cows a lot of
[45:14] a lot of things they do they buy them
[45:17] because it's why
[45:18] because it's rare from all the other
[45:19] women of their nation it's rare so you
[45:21] see this
[45:22] arab king and he's got this bright
[45:24] red-haired girl or blond-haired girl
[45:26] but the red is real rare when i see
[45:28] redheads we have any here today
[45:31] anna's not here today is she but boy
[45:33] when i see my compliment wherever
[45:34] they're at say
[45:36] red hair is rare where
[45:39] oh hannah yes hannah
[45:43] he knows i've said it to her beautiful
[45:46] red hair
[45:46] rare i can't believe there's not more
[45:50] guys never mind
[45:53] i'm like telling some of the guys you
[45:55] know that come around you're missing out
[45:57] man
[45:58] what are you doing it's like wake up
[46:01] i mean that too you know what you know
[46:03] what it is about those girls
[46:05] they're not they're gonna they're gonna
[46:06] kill me for this
[46:08] we got some older girls in the assembly
[46:10] they're not old but they're older than
[46:13] the 16 year olds
[46:16] it's not just that they're beautiful
[46:17] girls but their spirit and their love
[46:19] for this word
[46:20] and their consistency and their
[46:22] faithfulness to this word and working
[46:23] for the house of god
[46:26] has been unprecedented what i've seen
[46:28] for years it's we've got some lovely
[46:30] lovely older young people and guys in
[46:32] this assembly
[46:33] but girls like that that held the
[46:35] standard for all these years
[46:37] are to be appreciated praised and
[46:38] thanked can you say man
[46:44] [Applause]
[46:50] and red-haired freckled face so it's
[46:53] redheads are special because they're
[46:55] they're rare they're rare and i
[46:57] shouldn't i guess i've spent enough time
[46:58] on this but
[47:00] the freckles and all that i just david
[47:02] was this way so i mean it's very
[47:08] spiritual
[47:10] more special than the rest of you
[47:11] there's something unique about it
[47:15] i hated my freckles you know that i
[47:17] hated my freckles i used
[47:19] every type of ointment and every type of
[47:21] oil
[47:22] they weren't called essential oils but
[47:24] they were essential to me and i had to
[47:26] buy them to get rid of these
[47:28] freckles it's been 30 40 dad i got to
[47:32] have this
[47:33] and put it all on i got to get rid of
[47:35] these things because i so had
[47:36] such a complex about my freckles i hated
[47:39] them and
[47:40] so i would use these ointments and one
[47:42] of them one day i put it all over my
[47:43] whole body
[47:44] and the next day i had more freckles
[47:49] waste of money dad said you waste my 40
[47:51] bucks and
[47:53] let this go god made you with freckles
[47:55] but i hate freckles i hate freckles
[47:57] so quickly because you've heard this
[47:58] story before first two questions to my
[48:03] rebecca that i was interested in do you
[48:05] have the holy ghost
[48:06] number two what do you think about
[48:08] freckles
[48:11] second question that's in that's not in
[48:13] the message or anything but that was my
[48:15] question
[48:16] and she goes in her southern accent i
[48:18] love
[48:19] freckles i said
[48:22] great let's do it good to go
[48:26] god gave me a girl that loves freckles
[48:29] she loves them
[48:31] she thinks it's handsome she thinks it's
[48:33] beautiful she loves my freckles
[48:35] and it's not only rare to have a
[48:37] red-haired freckled person
[48:38] it's rare to find somebody who likes
[48:40] freckles so i was all over that
[48:46] spending way too much time on praising
[48:50] freckles and red hair
[48:51] hey give me my moment here you know it
[48:53] doesn't get praised enough in this world
[48:56] praise the lord this is what david was
[48:59] brother brown said he was that way
[49:01] short he was strong but he was short
[49:04] and god did not judge them even though
[49:06] you say he says goodly and
[49:08] beautiful countenance and all these
[49:09] other things it looks like it's all
[49:11] outside but they're giving
[49:12] the distinction in saul and the outward
[49:14] appearance this would
[49:16] not be a person that the people would
[49:18] choose this
[49:19] is not your most handsome person on the
[49:21] internet that you would choose to be a
[49:23] king so if you're looking for outside
[49:24] things
[49:25] david wasn't the person but god was
[49:27] looking at that man's heart
[49:30] and because israel wasn't looking at the
[49:32] the inside
[49:33] but the outside god said i'll have to
[49:36] help you
[49:37] i'll have to help you choose somebody
[49:39] and if you young people pray
[49:41] god will help you can you say man choose
[49:44] something that's more character than
[49:46] just the outward looks
[49:47] and just your emotions and your passions
[49:49] i want them i want them i just want to
[49:51] be with them
[49:52] no it has to go deeper if you'll trust
[49:53] the lord if you'll pray
[49:55] then he'll help you choose he'll
[49:58] influence your choice
[49:59] the word will influence your choice but
[50:01] david he was ready
[50:02] he was he was short he was uh
[50:05] he was short red and fair that's what
[50:08] those words mean there
[50:09] he was fair-skinned he was red skinned
[50:12] and he was fair skinned which is very
[50:13] rare in that day
[50:14] because all the people were dark skinned
[50:16] and so this is how
[50:17] god says but he looks at the inside
[50:20] mentioned something's about his
[50:21] countenance
[50:22] his eyes in the in the hebrew his eyes
[50:24] were just set a certain way
[50:26] and that's just deeper than tall dark
[50:29] and handsome
[50:30] you know what's in a person's eyes
[50:32] didn't brother branham
[50:34] look at the way israel's choosing jim
[50:35] brother man says choosing abide
[50:37] the kind of woman that a man would
[50:38] choose the quote choosing a rabbi the
[50:41] kind of man
[50:41] that a woman she would choose will
[50:43] reflect his ambitions
[50:45] and his character do you guys have that
[50:46] quote if a man chooses the wrong woman
[50:48] if it reflects his character and what he
[50:50] ties himself to shows truly what's in
[50:52] him
[50:52] a woman reflects what's in the man when
[50:54] he chooses her for a wife
[50:55] it shows what's down in him no matter
[50:57] what he says outside
[50:59] watch what he marries i go to the office
[51:02] man's office he says he's a christian
[51:04] pinups all over the walls and old boogie
[51:06] woogie music going on i don't care what
[51:08] he says
[51:08] i don't believe his testimony because
[51:10] his spirit is feeding on
[51:12] them things of the world what say if he
[51:14] would marry a chorus girl
[51:16] or what if we marry a sex queen or just
[51:17] a pretty modern raketa
[51:19] it reflects it shows what's in his mind
[51:22] what his future home is going to be
[51:24] because he's took to her to raise he's
[51:27] took her to raise his children by
[51:28] and whatever she is that's the way
[51:30] she'll raise those children
[51:32] so it reflects what's in a man a man
[51:34] that takes a woman like that
[51:35] shows just what he's thinking of the
[51:37] future could you imagine a christian
[51:38] doing a thing as that
[51:39] no sir i could not a true christian will
[51:42] not look for such beauty queens
[51:44] and chorus girls and sex queens he'll
[51:46] look for christian character
[51:48] now you can't have all things there
[51:49] might be a girl that's real pretty
[51:51] and the other girl maybe she her stature
[51:53] looks better than this one
[51:54] and you might have to sacrifice one for
[51:56] the other but if she's not the stature
[51:58] of a lady of a woman
[52:00] and she i don't care whether she's
[52:01] pretty or not you better look at her
[52:03] character
[52:04] whether she's pretty or not pretty now
[52:06] for it is becoming if a christian would
[52:08] choose a wife
[52:09] he ought to choose a genuine born-again
[52:11] woman
[52:12] because of what she regardless
[52:15] regardless
[52:15] of what she looks like it's what she is
[52:18] it's what makes her
[52:19] and then again that reflects his own
[52:22] godly character
[52:23] and reflects what's in his mind and
[52:24] what's going to be in his future his
[52:26] family
[52:26] will be raised by such a woman for the
[52:28] future plans of his home
[52:30] sorry for reading through this quickly
[52:31] but it's a large quote if he marries one
[52:34] of these little modern ricketts
[52:35] sex queens what could he expect what
[52:38] kind of a home could a man expect
[52:40] if he marries a girl that ain't got
[52:41] enough moral about her to stay home
[52:43] and take care of her house and wants to
[52:45] work out in somebody's office
[52:46] what kind of a housekeeper will she be
[52:48] you'll have babysitters and everything
[52:50] else it's true
[52:52] i can go with and then he goes down
[52:54] later he says i'm not much
[52:55] about this modernistic take taste of
[52:57] women working
[52:58] in a lot of cases these days it's re you
[53:00] have to do it out of
[53:02] necessity but he's not not against
[53:04] putting him out there in all the man's
[53:06] position taking
[53:07] positions from men taking jobs from men
[53:11] that the men should have and not the
[53:12] women he's not wasn't for them being in
[53:14] out all the offices and all these other
[53:16] things
[53:17] and he goes a little down down a little
[53:19] later in the quote and says i used to go
[53:20] with a rancher that i work with
[53:21] to buy cattle and i noticed the old
[53:23] fellow always looking right in the face
[53:25] of the heifer before he went bidding
[53:27] then he turned her head and looked back
[53:28] and forth i followed him and watched him
[53:30] and he looked her up and down and she
[53:32] looked all right the stature
[53:33] then he turned and looked her in the
[53:34] face and sometimes he'd shake his head
[53:36] and walk away say jeff
[53:37] i want to ask you something i said jeff
[53:39] i want to ask you something he said say
[53:40] on bill i said
[53:41] why you always look that cow in the face
[53:43] i said she looks all right
[53:44] good heavy cow said i want to tell you
[53:46] boy you got to learn
[53:48] you got a lot to learn and i realized
[53:49] that after he told me said i don't care
[53:51] how
[53:51] she's made up she might be beef and
[53:53] plump to the hoof
[53:55] but if she's got that wild stare in her
[53:57] face
[53:58] don't ever buy her said why so jeff
[54:01] well said the first thing is said she'll
[54:04] never stay put
[54:07] and he said the next thing is she'll
[54:08] never be a mammy to her calf
[54:10] and said they put here her in a pin now
[54:12] the reason she's fat
[54:13] you turn her loose with that wild stare
[54:15] she'll run herself to death and i said
[54:17] you know
[54:18] i kind of learned something i believe
[54:19] that applies to women too
[54:21] the whole congregation there is laughing
[54:22] quite a bit and choosing of a bride
[54:24] at this point they're laughing quite a
[54:26] bit
[54:27] he said i believe that applies to women
[54:29] too right you know he's right in los
[54:31] angeles saying these things
[54:34] you think that's by chance that god had
[54:37] that prophet
[54:38] preach choosing of a bride not only with
[54:42] the bride that god chooses but of a
[54:45] young man who chooses and he does it
[54:46] right in the hub
[54:48] of perversion of hollywood
[54:51] that's god friends i'll do it right
[54:54] there and he says i kind of learned
[54:56] something
[54:58] that wild staring raketa look you better
[55:00] stay away from her boy
[55:02] all that there blew stuff atop her eyes
[55:05] and i didn't i wouldn't want that i
[55:06] don't think that's becoming to a
[55:08] christian
[55:08] i don't care how much the television and
[55:11] paper
[55:12] and magazines and internet i don't care
[55:15] how much it says
[55:16] that it's pretty it's the most horrible
[55:19] looking hideous sight
[55:20] that i ever seen in my life and the
[55:23] prophet says the first time he's seen it
[55:25] in a store or in a restaurant
[55:28] he asked his fellow what is that i never
[55:30] seen that before
[55:31] and he says can i pray for her he says
[55:33] i've been foreign countries i see people
[55:34] with diseases
[55:35] does she have a disease can i pray for
[55:37] that's how it was of a shock it was
[55:39] what in the world is she coloring around
[55:41] her eyes for why
[55:42] she emphasized why is she doing that she
[55:44] looks sickly to do it
[55:46] she does it because the world says it's
[55:49] pretty.
[55:51] but my dear sisters that's
[55:54] your choice but it's not god's choice
[55:58] number two
[56:02] israel number we talk about number one
[56:04] choosing based upon what's seen
[56:07] number two following the crowd the
[56:09] motive for choosing this king
[56:12] is to be like other nations so their
[56:15] choice was heavily influenced by caring
[56:17] with others this is what they do so this
[56:19] is what i want this is what the nations
[56:21] do so this is what i want
[56:23] comparing themselves with other nations
[56:26] and i'll just be short on this part
[56:28] because i've already been preaching
[56:29] basically about it
[56:31] you should never make choices based upon
[56:33] what the crowd is doing
[56:35] what the internet is doing and what even
[56:38] some people that are wearing or doing in
[56:39] the message
[56:40] no no don't compare yourself with
[56:42] anybody else look to the word
[56:44] of god look to the word look to god's
[56:47] choice
[56:48] you might be 13 years old today young
[56:50] girl but i love you and as a gospel
[56:52] minister
[56:53] you are beautiful to god don't let the
[56:56] world and
[56:57] friends and people you see influence you
[57:00] to be something different than the way
[57:03] god has made you
[57:04] you are beautiful in the sight of god
[57:07] just the way he made you
[57:10] and brother ram talks about a woman and
[57:13] putting a little color there sometimes
[57:15] she said i i think that would be all
[57:16] right
[57:17] problem is i don't say that a lot
[57:18] because sisters not sisters but that
[57:21] girls will take it oh he said that then
[57:23] he'd just been cake on the make it it's
[57:24] wrong to kick out in the make it
[57:26] and make yourself look different than
[57:27] the way god made you
[57:29] you won't find that in the older godly
[57:31] sisters here in this is the images of
[57:33] sisters living that
[57:34] they're beautiful to the lord beautiful
[57:35] branch of the lord
[57:37] don't let other friends and the world
[57:41] tell you what's pretty
[57:44] look to god and say god you've already
[57:46] made me beautiful
[57:47] i am fearfully and wonderfully made
[57:50] let me not be intimidated you made me
[57:53] beautiful i know you maybe don't like
[57:55] the way you look most of you don't most
[57:57] guys
[57:58] well guys like the way they look but
[58:00] girls they're intimidated
[58:01] why did i have to have this why did god
[58:03] make this but god made you that way
[58:06] for a purpose god gave me my freckles
[58:09] for a purpose so my wife could enjoy
[58:12] them
[58:14] you say well i'm not very beautiful well
[58:16] your husband your true godly husband
[58:18] is going to think you're gorgeous just
[58:21] the way god made you
[58:22] so he made you that way for god and to
[58:25] be a testimony to god
[58:27] but he made you that no doubt for your
[58:29] husband to enjoy
[58:31] because to him and to god you'll be the
[58:33] prettiest woman
[58:34] in the world
[58:38] it's not in my notes this is all free
[58:40] this is extra
[58:42] don't compare yourself with others i
[58:44] don't know what time it is right now
[58:45] i don't really care
[58:48] ten to one all right ten to one o'clock
[58:51] so
[58:54] they were influenced by the other
[58:55] nations i think you get that
[58:57] they were influenced by other things
[59:01] influence from the crowd they made
[59:03] choices based upon
[59:04] following what all the other nations had
[59:07] i want a king i've got to have them and
[59:09] i want to have them
[59:10] just like the other nations
[59:14] now the last the third thing here is
[59:16] that
[59:17] trials and afflictions influence our
[59:19] choices too
[59:20] so what was number one i forgot i'm
[59:23] going to go ahead and read it
[59:24] choice is based upon outward appearance
[59:26] and what's seen and what's not unseen
[59:28] i'm trying to make this simple for you
[59:29] this morning number two choice is made
[59:32] upon following the crowd
[59:34] and what the rest of the world and rest
[59:36] the rest are doing
[59:37] that's not a good basis to make your
[59:39] choices and number three
[59:42] making choices through your trials and
[59:44] afflictions
[59:46] and things that you're going through be
[59:48] careful
[59:49] the decisions you make during
[59:52] trials because israel did the same thing
[59:56] because the bible says that
[59:58] that the enemy was gathering and there
[1:00:00] was something happening
[1:00:01] and they starting to feel the pressure
[1:00:03] and they thought
[1:00:04] well if we don't get a king we're not
[1:00:07] going to be able to make it through this
[1:00:09] this great thing that's going on this
[1:00:10] enemy coming against us if we don't get
[1:00:12] a king we need a king right now we need
[1:00:13] to do it right now and sometimes in our
[1:00:15] trials
[1:00:16] and the enemy moving in on us
[1:00:19] we will make choices in the midst of
[1:00:21] those trials
[1:00:24] and that's what israel did we got to
[1:00:26] have them now
[1:00:27] and we got to have them like the rest of
[1:00:28] it but it's because they are under
[1:00:29] pressure
[1:00:30] be careful of the decisions you make
[1:00:33] under pressure
[1:00:35] you still need to look to the unseen and
[1:00:38] not the scene can you say amen
[1:00:40] and here in our text we'll go back as we
[1:00:42] bring it to a close this morning
[1:00:44] if you go back in the scriptures up
[1:00:45] there to second corinthians 4
[1:00:48] i want to refer to how he's wording it
[1:00:50] here and i just found this this morning
[1:00:52] and added it in but i thought this was
[1:00:53] great
[1:00:54] i know the scripture says look to the
[1:00:56] things that while we look to the things
[1:00:58] that are
[1:00:59] unseen and not to the things that are
[1:01:01] seen for the things that are
[1:01:03] seen are temporal but the things that
[1:01:06] are unseen
[1:01:07] are eternal second corinthians chapter 4
[1:01:10] starting at
[1:01:11] verse 15. all things for your sakes that
[1:01:15] the abundance grace
[1:01:16] through the thanksgiving of many rebound
[1:01:17] to the glory of god verse 16
[1:01:19] for which cause for which cause
[1:01:22] we faint not if we
[1:01:26] get pressures if the enemy is rushing in
[1:01:28] on us
[1:01:29] listen we don't give up
[1:01:32] faint not means to give up it says we're
[1:01:34] not going to do that we're not going to
[1:01:36] give up we're not gonna
[1:01:37] we we faint not because of the grace of
[1:01:39] god we faint not
[1:01:41] but though our outward man perish
[1:01:44] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:01:47] so now
[1:01:48] the way that you need to look at this
[1:01:51] the way that
[1:01:52] christians need to look is look to the
[1:01:53] unseen and that is when you look at your
[1:01:55] trial
[1:01:56] or the enemy rushing in or the
[1:01:57] afflictions that's come into your life
[1:01:59] when you look at it you have to keep in
[1:02:02] mind the revelation
[1:02:03] that the outward man may perish but the
[1:02:06] inward man is being renewed can you say
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:11] day by day if you
[1:02:14] lose sight of that you'll make the wrong
[1:02:16] choices
[1:02:19] remember i said last sunday prophecy can
[1:02:21] be being fulfilled
[1:02:23] even after jesus was dead there was a
[1:02:24] prophecy over his life
[1:02:26] so you hit a crisis in your life you hit
[1:02:28] a affliction in your life
[1:02:30] and you'll start making choices based
[1:02:32] upon what you see but you got to realize
[1:02:34] the word the inward man is still being
[1:02:36] renewed every day
[1:02:37] if you're in the word if you're getting
[1:02:39] yourself to service if you're staying in
[1:02:41] that
[1:02:41] you think nothing's going on the unseen
[1:02:44] what's happening in the unseen
[1:02:45] the inward man is growing day by day
[1:02:49] and yet you're got this trial you've got
[1:02:51] this thing that we're man is perishing
[1:02:54] not only our minds sometimes we feel
[1:02:56] like it's perishing
[1:02:57] our bodies brother ray and i say this
[1:02:59] because we're always
[1:03:01] moaning with each other about our that
[1:03:04] we're not 20 years old anymore
[1:03:07] the outward man is perishing day by day
[1:03:12] and if you get really down by that oh
[1:03:14] lord the outward manners person
[1:03:16] not just the physical but our emotions
[1:03:19] can be down
[1:03:20] our mental condition can be down the
[1:03:23] pressures of finances the pressures of
[1:03:25] of the economy and we haven't reached
[1:03:27] the end of this i'm telling you friends
[1:03:29] a
[1:03:30] good thing that we got the lord to
[1:03:31] depend on because the
[1:03:33] economy is going to change i'm not a
[1:03:36] prophet but things are going to change
[1:03:38] we haven't seen hard times yet and this
[1:03:41] is a good scripture because we got to
[1:03:43] remember
[1:03:44] the outward man may perish but the
[1:03:47] inward man
[1:03:48] is growing day by day and that's when
[1:03:50] we're looking to the unseen
[1:03:52] the outside the economy crashes all
[1:03:54] that's going on we don't know what
[1:03:56] biden's going to do next or the
[1:03:57] government or whatever we don't know
[1:03:59] what's
[1:03:59] going to take place next and i'm not
[1:04:02] going to get political
[1:04:03] but i can tell you there's more times
[1:04:04] coming that we're going to have to use
[1:04:06] this scripture
[1:04:07] i'm looking today at the unseen and not
[1:04:10] what i see
[1:04:12] and the unseen says that if i'm staying
[1:04:15] in the word
[1:04:16] there's there's something happening put
[1:04:17] that scripture over here there's
[1:04:19] something happening in the inward man
[1:04:20] that i can't see
[1:04:21] but it's happening it's happening
[1:04:25] another the one before that the outward
[1:04:28] man perishes day by day oh this is the
[1:04:30] next one
[1:04:31] for our light affliction oh man i'm
[1:04:33] closing now friends but i love
[1:04:35] how paul calls this our life and trials
[1:04:40] a light affliction you can almost get
[1:04:43] angry at that it's light it don't feel
[1:04:46] light to me
[1:04:48] the things that i bent through were not
[1:04:50] light but in comparison to the exceeding
[1:04:53] internal weight of glory
[1:04:55] it's nothing to god and so he calls it
[1:04:59] a light affliction i challenge you i
[1:05:01] challenge you
[1:05:02] when you go through a heart-heart trial
[1:05:04] to say this is just
[1:05:06] a light affliction this is no big deal
[1:05:10] why because it's and
[1:05:13] here's another funny part for every line
[1:05:16] is
[1:05:16] anointed for our light affliction which
[1:05:19] is but for a moment
[1:05:24] some of us was like it wasn't for a
[1:05:25] moment didn't feel like a moment
[1:05:28] felt like 10 years it was 10 years
[1:05:31] but what is he preaching this is the way
[1:05:34] we need to look at it
[1:05:36] when we're looking to the unseen that
[1:05:38] light affliction that happened five
[1:05:40] years ago
[1:05:41] light affliction and it was just for a
[1:05:43] moment
[1:05:46] it's not being truthful when it looks at
[1:05:48] what really happened
[1:05:49] but it's being truthful in the way god
[1:05:50] looks at it
[1:05:52] it's the light affliction just for a
[1:05:55] moment
[1:05:56] bang it was over but when you weigh it
[1:06:02] it's working for us a far
[1:06:05] more exceeding and eternal way to glory
[1:06:09] and when you look at it that way then
[1:06:12] you can call it a light affliction
[1:06:15] oh praise the lord brother paul you're
[1:06:17] preaching to me today
[1:06:20] i think that preaches to everybody i
[1:06:22] think we can all apply that can you say
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:25] you'll always have afflictions and
[1:06:26] sufferings and and all these other
[1:06:28] things but
[1:06:28] the way we look at it is don't be like
[1:06:31] israel say we've got to have a king
[1:06:32] we've got to have king
[1:06:33] be careful the decisions you make during
[1:06:35] your trial look to the unseen
[1:06:37] something greater is working and all
[1:06:39] this is working to a
[1:06:40] far more eternal weight of glory
[1:06:43] not say we need a king we need to do
[1:06:45] this we need to make this decision we
[1:06:46] need to change this
[1:06:47] be careful in the decisions you make in
[1:06:50] trial
[1:06:50] remember abraham when he got to famine
[1:06:52] went down into guerrilla went down into
[1:06:54] egypt because he got under pressure from
[1:06:56] the economy and he didn't have anything
[1:06:58] to feed his family
[1:06:59] and when he did it he got out of the
[1:07:01] will of god he should have stayed in his
[1:07:03] homeland
[1:07:04] and when he got out of his homeland he
[1:07:06] got in trouble why did he make the
[1:07:07] choice to get out of his home land
[1:07:08] because there was a famine in the land
[1:07:10] he got nervous he wouldn't have anything
[1:07:11] to eat
[1:07:12] do you honestly think you're going to
[1:07:13] starve when you're in the homeland
[1:07:16] not going to happen god's going to take
[1:07:19] care of us
[1:07:21] god's going to supply don't make
[1:07:23] decisions
[1:07:24] too quickly or too hastily brother
[1:07:26] branham says
[1:07:28] especially during the times of
[1:07:30] affliction especially during the times
[1:07:32] of trials
[1:07:33] behold israel your decisions behold your
[1:07:38] king that you chose
[1:07:39] this is the basis you told him chosen
[1:07:42] this is the reason
[1:07:43] under pressure you look into how he
[1:07:46] looks
[1:07:47] there's so many lessons is anybody
[1:07:49] learning anything out of this
[1:07:51] and it goes on and on there's so many
[1:07:53] lessons in this i see myself
[1:07:55] you see yourself is that the choices we
[1:07:58] make
[1:08:00] lord i want if i have to wait a little
[1:08:03] while before i get something
[1:08:05] i want to wait because i want to know
[1:08:07] that it's your
[1:08:08] choice whether it's to marry somebody
[1:08:11] whether it's
[1:08:12] a choice of a car to drive
[1:08:16] could it be that we could take
[1:08:18] everything to the lord in prayer
[1:08:20] and say father you have a choice for
[1:08:24] this
[1:08:25] i look to your word but i need your
[1:08:26] direction what is your choice
[1:08:30] sons of god that are redeemed of god
[1:08:32] have
[1:08:33] come to the end of this thing of a life
[1:08:36] as a christian
[1:08:37] i'm going to do it this way i'm going to
[1:08:38] have it this my past has been
[1:08:41] influenced by somebody forcing me to do
