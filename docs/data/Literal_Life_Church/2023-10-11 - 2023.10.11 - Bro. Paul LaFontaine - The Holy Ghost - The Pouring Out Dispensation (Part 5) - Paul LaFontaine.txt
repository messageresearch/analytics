thankful for that well let me make a few announcements here about the great weekend we got coming uh not to overshadow being in the house of the Lord tonight I think we're going to have a great time here this evening but we have uh tomorrow night's class for the Brothers the courageous Bible study at 7:30 so we're looking forward to all we can come out for that we're looking forward to that and so then this weekend there's a youth meeting here at the church at um I think this starts at 7 and uh so then we want you to remember that and remember tonight when you come out they've got some decorations started for the table for the weekend please don't interrupt those don't let your kids uh get into that and change it so we're getting prepared for the big day for the uh fall fellow Fellowship together starts at noon goes to 4:00 and we got some food we got some sides and different things that you signed up for and hopefully if you haven't done that yet maybe do that so we know what we have coming but this is a nice time now we do have some rain coming and if we have enough people join with us and pray it away that would be the first choice so we ask for your prayers for that because we had outdoor activities and things so just pray something happens we need we need to be inside we'll do some inside activities and such uh but we're looking for the mostly for the fellowship and time together and always the uh Donuts from Bennetts and the apple cider and those things and that's what brother Diggs comes for is the apple cider and such and he's bringing his daughter so we're looking forward to and he'll be two services on Sunday how many's looking forward to that Sunday morning and then Sunday at 5: for the tri- State youth meeting he's like a part of the family around here so we're we're looking forward to having brother Diggs and so remember though invite all your friends I know that the fall Fellowship is was for us the church for Fellowship but at 5: the cockman family which we've never had before uh coming all the way from North Carolina they're bringing the whole crew ex except their dad he's uh doesn't travel long distances like that anymore but they're bringing the whole crew and all the grandkids we're going to have a lot of good music from 5 o'clock all the way till midnight I mean they're coming a long way might as well let them sing but I know you'll enjoy it and they might even sing a little bit in the Sunday morning service as well we'll see if they can do that but looking forward to that it starts at 5: invite all your friends for that concert I think they would enjoy it and then brother Diggs for the two services so that's what's coming up praise the Lord we're looking forward to what the Lord has in mind for us and that special refreshing in the Lord on Sunday praise the Lord I'm going to read in Joel 2 tonight Joel 2 in your bibles if you join me Joel chapter 2 and verse we'll start reading here at uh verse 28 Joel chapter 2 and verse 28 we want to remember in prayer brother Colin I was just asking for a report from him from Israel and most of you are probably Tak keeping up with the news so we know Israel is fighting on almost three fronts now okay that hasn't happened in quite a while as far as it becomes a war uh it's just too similar to the scripture that talks about the Army surrounding Israel I don't know if this the time but boy theyve we fighting on three front fronts now the North and the East and and also then the South and so uh they're very determined that this is going to be a war for a long time so we need to pray for Israel pray for the saints of God there pray for brother Colin pastoring the church there and we just remember them it's atrocities that has been done to Israel never before has it been this barbaric what they've done to the babies and and the children and just different ones uh that they it's just very barbaric so so uh God will I think defend and bring Vengeance for his people and protect his people and be with them but this is a a real rough time for all of the country of Israel so let's just remember them in prayer daily before the Lord I pray trust you would do that Joel chapter 2 and verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show I want you to notice a little bit of the change I want to read the rest to to verse 32 and I'll bring up this this uh change and prophecy that happens at verse 30 and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great great and the terrible day of the Lord how many remember that term before the great and terrible day of the Lord how many remember where that scripture is at Malachi 45 and6 which is speaks of that slot of Elijah coming before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so here it has it too so we know what day we're talking about here now it's in our time because this is a time when the the the the sun's turned to Darkness the moon's turned into blood this is just coming into tribulation before the great and ter terrible day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call you you got to say thank God because in that time he says even at that time whoever will call upon the name of the Lord I'll deliver them praise be to God and he says if there's a Remnant I believe it's talking about about the bride out of all Christianity there will be a bride of g a gentile bride but there will also be 144,000 of Israel can you say Amen so out of all of that if they'll call on the Lord God will bring a Remnant out of all that mess heavenly father bless your word tonight as we teach it and we pray you'll give us the voice and the strength we pray you'll bless our time together in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated now in covering the three main Prophecies of the Holy Ghost from the Old Testament and so we covered one uh in Isaiah we covered one in Ezekiel this past Sunday and then now tonight I'm taking the last main prophecy for the holy ghost coming in Joel 228 um so we we want to understand uh what it what the Holy Ghost is and what we want to understand what it is just a little more tonight how many's come to understand the Holy Ghost just a little bit more tonight if you'll have that desire then I believe God has something for us so we come to understand the Holy Ghost in each of these times we bring it and talk about it in the next in the last few weeks and maybe in the coming weeks we just want to understand it more and so we've in tonight you're going to find a real distinction again in the demonstrations of the Holy Ghost when he comes and the signs of the Holy Ghost and we're going to make a distinction between the demonstrations and the signs uh from the actions of it and what it does according to the word we have to draw a distinction because when his Spirit pours there's a lot of demonstration and there's a lot of act there's a lot of things that happen the gifts of the Spirit and prophecies and different things because he's pouring out his spirit and so and and all that's of God all that's a a wonderful thing but we have to realize there's a distinction and brother brandom gives us and actually talking about the evidence of the Holy Ghost for you he says don't look so much for the demonstrations as an Evidence but look for the action of the Holy Ghost what it does according to the word so he be so if he draws that distinction he never does away from the manifestations of the Holy Ghost the signs of the Holy Ghost the tongues whatever it is he never does away he wouldn't be a true Prophet to do that it's scriptural it happens when his spirit moves uh things happen can you say amen and and this is a ter in the Bible that says I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so a lot of people will be affected by the pouring out of the spirit but I want to draw a distinction when he comes that he has a a distinctive thing to do and that is he don't just want to give a blessing to your flesh he doesn't want to just give a prophecy he's going deeper than that and that is to fill people with the Holy Ghost so he comes for a reason he comes for a purpose but we don't dump out e either thing I'm just going to go ahead and say this I was going to say it at the end is that when he's moving when God is around there's noise most of the time there's noise people don't think I believe that I believe that when God moves there's usually noise and that's why you have the minister say and I think even brother bradam says and ministers quote it all the time he says if you've got a dead religion religion you ought to bury it because anything dead you need to bury and if there's no action to it there's no you know there's no nothing going on you need to bury that religion I believe that with all my heart I believe that God when he's around that there's noise but listen now I believe when there's a new birth and a born again experience taking place I don't believe there's any noise to that because it's at a soul level didn't get as amen many amens to that but now I'm going from the the the teaching of Jesus and what Jesus said when when you're born again he said the the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hears the sound but you can't tell when it came or when it went so is everyone that's born again of the spirit of God so you have both things there's not a noise of what's going on in the soul that's a quiet thing between you and God but when he comes there's always noise on the outside there's always rejoicing and if you get a real CH change you're going to be emotional in some way you may cry but when God's moving on your heart and God's changing your heart and there's stimulation of Revelation strike in your heart you're you're going to be happy about it there's going to be noise can you say amen and some will get loud shouting some will just cry it we're not we're not manipulating what would happen in the side of the emotion but just know when he comes he says Sons and Daughters some will prophesy the young some will have dreams can you say Amen this is what happens when the Holy Spirit comes around but we almost we we must always draw a Distinction on the inward work that's going on and not look to any manifestation on the outside as an evidence that you have it is that okay with everybody that's where we we we the waters start to get muddy and the confusion is that his Spirit pours out and upon All Flesh and we're affected by it and we're enjoying the presence and the blessings of God and he's doing many things but you must make sure that you don't depend on just an emotion you need a change in the heart you need a desire change you need the real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on the soul level can you say Amen so we want all these things we never preach any of them out of the church we never have for 35 years here we know when the spirit moves we know he's moving in this last evening time we want to be available and and I tell you this when he moves you ought to jump in and move with it you ought to respond to it can you say Amen cuz what can he do in that he can do healings he can do all kinds of things but most of all he can save you he can have born a born again experience and change your life so don't be hesitant of the spirit of God moving jump into it step into the water wait out a little bit deeper can you say Amen wet your feet in the water of his love when he moves you better move in that and take advantage of the situation because today there's so much to take us away from the spirit of God and make us cold when he moves even if it's in your Bible study and his presence there you move with it and say I'll raise my hands before the presence of God right now because I feel his presence the two things that we must rightly divide are are are these things between the manifestations of the spirit and so that's what we'll do tonight we'll talk a little bit about that there must be a distinction and the distinction could be said this way I'll continue to talk about a little bit in the middle of the pouring out in the middle of the pouring out of the spirit because he said in the last days how many know that when he says in this prophecy in in in the in when those days come I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh how many know that began in the upper room on the day of Pentecost and how do we know that when they asked Peter what's going on he went right to this scripture and he it doesn't say the last days in Joel 2:28 Peter added that he said in the last days I'll pour out my spirit and I'm going to tell you why in a minute why he said it was the last days but I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh Peter went right to this scripture because this is the word that God was fulfilling right then and so remember I said you always go back to the word what's happening God's moving but God doesn't move outside of his word God does not move us outside of his word being fulfilled so if it's him moving there's a scripture there's a prophecy there's something there that you can go back say this is that what's going on here is right here in the scripture it's never just some mysterious thing it's in the Bible it's in the word and the very reason he's there is to make that word for that day live that's why the Holy Ghost is there you'll never find him uh operating outside of pointing the people back to the word and making that word live that's the evidence is Holy Ghost is there that's the reason he's there and so now I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and in the middle of this pouring out when it starts on the day of Pentecost in the middle of this pouring out he also is building another Masterpiece Bride for seven Church ages he's going to begin to build as I preach Sunday the Masterpiece was Jesus all the Old Testament he's building the Masterpiece and he finally gets back to Jesus Christ which is his Masterpiece which is the restoration of where his Masterpiece Adam had failed he failed God says I'll rebuild it back again and Jesus was the final M or at least we thought was the final Masterpiece but then like Michelangelo struck that that Moses and that statue and said speak God struck Jesus there and they struck that and out of him came a spirit because brother Braham says God was going to build another Masterpiece off of that which is that piece that was taken out of Christ and it was going to be his wife He restored Adam now he's got to restore Eve he had a masterpiece Adam second Adam now he's going to build for seven Church ages a masterpiece bride because the Eve had to be restored too it wasn't just Adam it was Eve it was you it was the people of God and so now he strikes it there's a piece off the Masterpiece and out of that piece at Pentecost he begins to build a masterpiece so let me let's just bring it a bit deeper here you holding on with me he's in the middle of the pouring out of his Spirit he's building another Masterpiece bride and he begins to build it thus the works and the manifestations of his spirit being poured out and the true purpose of his spirit being poured out is a mystery of the second Eve he's pouring out a spirit but what's the purpose of it there's a mystery there's a bride that was within Christ like Eve was within Adam and so now if I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh if God says I'm going to pour my there's a purpose behind it he's going to be begin to build in the mystery of the pouring out of his Spirit he's going to build a second Eve restored and that's the mystery of Christ that's the mystery of this whole thing of the spirit coming into the church and that means that he may pour out his Spirit but his elect from every age are not only going to get a feeling in the Holy Spirit or just a a baptism on their Spirit they're actually going to be that mystery bride and if they're elect they're going to get the Born Again experienced by the word and they will be attached they will be in come back into Oneness with their maker again with Christ again so he's going to build a bride and thus all the manifestations of the spirit being poured out that's that's beautiful when it within itself it's just the pouring out of the spirit I will pour out my spirit listen we're finished without that we ought to say Thank You Lord that you promis to pour out your spirit I tell you I've been blessed because God has poured out his Spirit on me and he continues to do it and sometimes I don't even deserve it but service after service after service day after day I know that God is pouring out his Spirit on me we've been blessed here Saints for 35 years God has blessed us over and over again by pouring out his Spirit Upon Us amen so now this second Eve though is what he's trying to get to so if we don't make that distinction between what God is really doing by the pouring out of the spirit we tend to make the manifestation or the sign the evidence that there's life there or a new birth there in the soul and that is not true when he pours out his spirit it's for a purpose and that's to make the word of that day live and then to live that word for that day to live it out in the people not just through an outside manifestation but to live it out in the people the word for that day is not to stay in the Bible it's to become flesh in the people of God so Joel 2:28 became flesh not in a Bible not in the priest not in the Pharisees his people that by the way didn't have any positions were poor people can you say Amen did not have any prestige in the world and you notice the scripture says I love this he says I'll pour this Spirit upon upon servants and handmaids upon the poor there's no more positions because we make it all positions that you got to go to 10 years of Seminary before God deals with you in this pouring out of the spirit you don't have to have any Seminary he'll pour it out on the handmaids he'll pour it on your sons he'll pour it out on daughters he says young men and young women will have dreams and prophesy he'll pour it out on the young people it's not going to school to a Pharisee school or denominational school for years he said I'm pouring this and it'll happen even on the young people I'll pour out my spirit that's why at 16 years old while I was was sitting in the audience he poured out his spirit and I was filled with the Holy Ghost and I didn't even know my Bible yet I didn't even know anything yet I and I still don't know anything but I didn't know nothing and God still poured his Spirit Within Me glory be to God you ought to be happy tonight that you don't have a reach a certain level in Bible knowledge before God deals with you he said I'll pour out my spirit on your sons on your daughters on handmaids on servants on the unknowns on the people that aren't popular on the prostitutes on the drug addicts can you say Amen I'll pour it on anybody who will receive it all the positions is out the door and the Pharisees had all these positions and levels that you reaped and all the little people they were just lay members and then when you get into the new church nickan comes along and it's conquer the Ley all the Holiness is in the Pulpit pulp with the preach with the preacher and the priest and all all the no they took the Catholic church and all the systems took the Bible away from the people and said you can't interpret that you can't read that we'll read it for you nickan ISM but the Holy Ghost said no no I'll pour it upon All Flesh you don't have to go to Seminary for 10 years study your Bible study the word but you don't have to have a certain level before God starts to deal with you you could be a prostitute sitting there and his spirit is poured out on you somebody say praise the Lord and you ought to raise your hand and say I wasn't deserving but the spirit poured out on me and hopefully it poured inside of you there was a change in your life you didn't deserve that but you didn't have to have a certain Prestige for God to do it he just did it you open your heart boy Lord I feel the presence of the Lord here I'm jumping right in Lord fill me tonight and God says all right I'll fill you fixing to get excited tonight on a Wednesday night I'm fixing to run the aisles he pours out his Spirit upon All Flesh Sons and Daughters will prophesy oh man they'll dream dreams and servants and handma I'll handmaids I'll pour out my spirit slaves can you say Amen that aren't deserving and people that are the lowest estate and that's why uh brother BR says that Peter and Paul and all of them they didn't silver and gold have I know they weren't rich people uh for were no didn't have any money can you say Amen in the song that I wrote for my Dad recently I said my dad's like Peter Silver and Gold Have I None but whatever I have give I to you in the name of the Lord rise up and walk these these preachers he says New Testament preachers didn't have any money he said I'm like that myself don't have any money that's a new testament preacher but God gave him the most valuable thing the spirit of God amen his spirit so we have three main references in the Old Testament concerning the prophecy of this holy ghost coming and we've dealt with the first two hopefully you've got something out of that and enjoyed it but now tonight we're into now I I wanted to say that's the three main references I found some others today that are references with the same wording almost about the spirit coming if you want to write them down right now or I can send them to you there are three or four other references to prophecies that the holy ghost coming numbers 11:29 all the way back there and I might bring this up a little bit later if I have time but Moses was complaining a bit to God because he was handing all the burden of the people all this two million people upon himself and and so God said take 70 of the elders and the B Bible says he distributed his spirit and split his Spirit up upon these seven Elders to help Moses out so then uh his his servant came to Moses and he was a little bit irritated because there was a couple guys that didn't show up at the Tabernacle they didn't come to church that day but because they were part of the 70 God still split some of his spirit and this guy he was say they don't need it they didn't show up they didn't come to church and so they and and this is what Moses said in numbers 11:29 and Moses said unto him envest thou for my sake would God would to God that all of the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his spirit Spirit upon all of them now right there we really have a prophecy of the same thing in joob 2 228 I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh in the Old Testament we see most of that come on the prophet so they can be anointed to speak thus sayeth the Lord but Moses said you know what God's heart is his heart is is that all of his people would be prophets and he would split his Spirit into all people amen he's prophesying because in the day of Pentecost it wasn't going to just be prophets it wasn't just going to be the popular people or the people that are even around Jesus there was 120 a lot of them we don't even know their names and God did what he said said to Moses Moses said he said would to God that all of God's people were prophets and would to God that he could split his Spirit and the Lord would put his Spirit upon them that's numbers 11:29 Proverbs 1:23 says I will pour out my spirit upon you Isaiah 32:15 says until the spirit be poured upon us it's all prophecy about his spirit being poured on poured out and the LA uh Isaiah 44:3 says pour upon thy seed the holy spirit will pour upon thy seed and thy Offspring well I latched on to that I want to put that in a a plaque or something on my wall because I have a promise that he'll pour out his spirit upon my seed and upon my Offspring and I'm holding to that I'm going to pray till all of my Offspring grandchildren all receive that blessing that his Spirit would be poured out upon them rather the riches and inheritance and my will and all that God I'll take that promise pour your spirit upon my Offspring and the last one is Ezekiel 37:14 he says I will pour my spirit upon you so it's I'll WR them again in case you're writing them down to 11 numbers 11:29 Proverbs 1:23 Isaiah 32:15 and Isaiah 443 and Ezekiel 37:14 all are scriptures in the Old Testament that for tell the pouring out of his Spirit coming but I'm dealing with just the main three ones and I'm the three ones that speak specifically about it and they're the main ones that are used and this Joel 228 is the last one here that I will speak about and all of these other ones foretell the dispensation of the pouring out upon All Flesh of the spirit of God now um I see the pouring out of his spirit being not just in the uh Upper Room on the day of Pentecost but I I I might blow your mind tonight but this dispensation that I'm calling out of I will pour out my spirit began at Pentecost but continues throughout the church ages until our day so I'm going to call that the dispensation of the pouring out of the Holy Ghost because he had never fulfilled anything where he poured his Spirit upon All Flesh he had never done that before mostly it was the prophets and then people would get anointed by the Holy Ghost David got anointed by the Holy Ghost they were affected by the spirit but never has he had a place that there's going to begin a time I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so it's a dispensation of about 2,000 years that he he fulfills this dispensation of the Holy Ghost and pouring out of his Spirit or I'm going to call this dispensation and hold on with me now I'm not going to make it uh I don't want to make it complicated but I brother brandom called that dispensation of the Holy Ghost or the dispensation of the Son of God now we think the dispensation of the Son of God is when he was here for uh 33 years on the Earth but the the brother brandom and Jesus himself called that dispensation he came in the office of Son of Man Prophet so he referred to himself even though they say Jesus thou son of D David and so now they would refer to him as son of David but he wasn't coming in that office yet they referred to him as Son of God but he wasn't really fully in that office but he was in most most denominations and people would think well that was his dispensation of Son of God but actually it was more son of man because he was the prophet he was the god prophet he was the the ultimate Prophet there and he was in flesh uh acting out what all the prophets did but now the fullness of it it was son of man and then brother brandham calls the Holy Ghost dispensation the Son of God the Holy Ghost so who it is it's the son Christ and his people because on the day of Pentecost and after that the people looked at the the ones coming out of the upper room and then days after they said the people took note that they had been with Jesus they seen the same Jesus living in them him the same Works how many know Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also so he's continuing the same works of himself now in people that are sborn Jesus wasn't sborn we're sborn what a miracle that God would fill you with his spirit and you would be Jesus to your generation a sborn brother or sister that came to the Lord my that's a miracle that's a great mystery I can see God coming in his fullness in Jesus Christ without sin but take a sin born prostitute or or some type of person that's in the drugs of sin can you say amen and God said I'll take them out of the myy clay I'll wash them as I preach Sunday I'll change their Spirit I'll change their Stony heart and then I'm going to take my spirit and put that within them that's a real real miracle and he says it was a paradox all the paradoxes of God the Miracles the signs he said but the greatest Paradox is when Christ comes in your life you are a paradox tonight said that to a sister at breakfast my wife and I meeting praise the Lord and then last night meeting with a sister that had a tremendous both of them had tremendous testimonies of how the Lord's brought him and I looked at the sister last night I said you know you're a paradox right she said yeah I read that message all the time you are a paradox greater than signs Miracles and wonders you are a paradox it's amazing you're sitting here with a heart to hear the word of God what you've been through you should not be here but you're a paradox glory be to God you're a paradox here tonight you're a miracle that you're sitting here if you're saying amen from your soul that's a paradox that's a miracle I don't care what the devil told you today you just say not today Satan I'm a paradox of God I'm a miracle of God blessed be his name so now now in this dispensation of the Son of God the Holy Ghost it's not when Jesus was here 33 years ago but the prophet referred to he was in the office of son of man when he was here those years and then remember Jesus said there'll be a repeat of the son of man ministry again profit to the Gentiles because if God gave son a man to the Jews then he'd have to give it to the Gentiles so there'll be a repeat a shorter repeat of the son of man Ministry Prophet uh in in the evening time at the LA very last days it'll be son of man again but through 2,000 years of seven Church ages it's Son of God it's the Holy Ghost poured out upon the people but then there's another repeat of the son of man before the Rapture and one place or two places the prophet uses that term the son of man he's son of man he's Son of God in the Holy Ghost dispensation for 2,000 years then he's son of man and then he becomes son of David in the Millennium it's another Office King son of David Son of son of David is the is the is the king that'll Rule and Reign so now he was in the uh the office of son of man and so with this son of man re there's two places that he says this son of man husband and wife son of man husband and wife now we think the the calling of the son of man the the office is just a prophet it is it is God coming in the flesh of a prophet God working through a prophet but when he says husband and wife that's perfect with this masterpiece because if he's finishing the second Adam and making a man he's got to bring the second Eve back again so really the Fulfillment of the son of man Ministry is not just a onean Ministry but husband and wife groom and bride Christ and his bride yes that's the ministry we're under now and matter of fact might as well say it we we we've left the dispensation and moved to another dispensation that's why brother Brown could called it the bride age because once you come out of just a Son of God where it's the pouring out of the spirit and you move into son of man now we're talking God finishing the finishing touches on a word bride a word bride Masterpiece so that she can come in Union be married to him and go in a Rapture in a millennium a honeymoon of a thousand years right how'd you like a honeymoon like that how would you like a honeymoon of a thousand years can't afford it right but that's what he's going to give when he finishes us up it's not just going to be a pouring out of his spirit it's going to be molding a masterpiece bride so he does that under the son of man he finishes it under the son of man and so Jesus referred to himself as the son of man the 2,000 years of seven Church Ages was the Son of God the Holy Ghost and the reason that I know that it is right in the same prophecy he goes right into the end time hold your Bible there and Joel 228 again shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit now stop there now in verse 30 and I will show wonders in the heaven and in the earth Blood Fire and fillers of smoke this is one of the reasons that we know that the dispensation of the pouring out of the spirit was not just in the upper room in the early church but it went for 2,000 years because here we have the days before the tribulation and final battles and where when the heavens and the Earth blood and fire the prophecy switches now to the beginning of the dispensation of the pouring out to the end of the the dispensation of pouring out so it'll be pouring out All Through the Ages until we get to what I call and the Bible calls the evening time if Peter called that day of Pentecost and he re he repeats Joel because they said what's going on he said this is that which was spoken by the prophet zo Joel and he goes in the last days I will pour out well my goodness what is that what year is that 33 ad or whatever is it and Peter's saying it's the last days said that's not the last days we live in the last days but dispensation Peter was right because it's the last 2,000 years in God's time 2,000 years till Noah 2,000 years till Jesus Christ and now he takes a bride in 2,000 years of of the church now right that's 6,000 years thousand years of Peace in the Millennium right that's seven that's completion that's it 2000 2000 and then 2,000 of calling the church pouring out his Spirit to the church now we get to the end of it all which I'll call the evening time and now he's we we know that this time of pouring out of the spirit will last all that all the way up until the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord so I always I've already taught or preached on that and brought that out but I was trying to show from the scripture here tonight that because he brings in the the evening time conditions of getting ready to go into tribulation and the judgments and the great and terrible day of the Lord this dispensation of pouring out his Spirit goes from the day of Pentecost all the way until the evening time all the way through till the lean age amen so now we see then he began to pour out his Spirit on the day of Pentecost and Peter adds the last days so the last days is quite a span of time he will take 2,000 years to build a masterpiece bride of a masterpiece uh that he had at Calvary he'll take a piece of it and look at all the time God takes to build a master priest bride 2,000 years so now let's apply that to you individually how long is it going to take for you but God is determined the sculptor to say I don't care how long it takes I'm going to stay working on this masterpiece and if he does that as a church for 2,000 years then he will do that in your life that's right how long will it take for you well some of you it's taking a while because you're a piece of work like I said Sunday you're a real piece of work but we get impatient we want some just submit yourself to God I'm missing things oh I'm going to miss the Rapture no no no no don't don't have that fear that nervousness just be filled with the spirit just stay submitted to God you won't miss a Rapture if you're filled with the spirit of God staying in tune with the spirit be filled on the soul e even in the body in the spirit just stay filled with the spirit of God Amen he's not going to leave his own spirit in people he's not not going to leave them here under judgment because they've already passed from Death unto life they've already passed the Judgment he couldn't leave them here during Tri ulation cuz they've already got his Spirit you think God's going to destroy this Earth as Israel it begins to mount up and we don't know where we're going with this but you think God would leave his Spirit on the earth and Destroy his spirit in his people with the rest of the earth he has to Rapture his Spirit first so that's how important it is to get you make sure Lord I'm staying be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and clear look up your Redemption is near because and you have to have this fear and I better do this and I got to read my Bible an extra hour because I want to make the Rapture wait a minute wait a minute no the spirit of God will lead you stay filled with the spirit he'll lift his Spirit off of this Earth someday and I'm GNA go with him I want to go with him do you want to go with him when he lifts his Spirit off this Earth You don't want to be here for tribulation you don't want to be here for Armageddon you don't want to be here for this can you say Amen when he lifts his Spirit which he's going to do very soon Lord may I lift with it I need his Spirit to lift up with it and I'd like my family to go with me I like my loved ones that are unsaved to go with me so I'm claiming my unsaved loved ones I want them to go with me we will not leave what did Moses say we're not going to leave a hoof animals everything getting an amen from Sherry on that one praise the Lord all the dog lovers but he said we're not going to leave a foot or a hoof behind us we want to take all of us in you say well not everybody's going to go in well but that's not my job to figure out out I'm claiming all of my family I'm claiming all my all my Offspring can you say amen God deal with them God bring them and if we're close and this is wrapping up in Israel and you're going to turn your heart to the Jews that means the Rapture is close he'll never turn to the Jews until we're out of here in a Rapture if we're that close God begin to work on my loved ones God changed their hearts can you say Amen blessed be his name so this 2,000 years he takes a masterpiece and if he takes that long process with the church he'll take a long process with you be patient God is patient with you be patient with him surrender to him and he will make you a masterpiece unto God he's working on you he's still working on us can you say Amen but we live in the last of the last we live in the evening time Peter pointed in the scripture as as the word was fulfilled for that day Joel 2:28 I'm going to present something not not tonight but I'm going to be easing us into continually using Joel 228 for today Peter used it for the pouring out of the Holy Ghost when it began but we're not using just that scripture for our time now brother Ram says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for today and I I I want to break that down because it's not it's not that we don't understand it but if you're looking at what I'm seeing tonight there'll be other scriptures today that need to be fulfilled so the word he gives for the day the evening time in the evening time it shall be light what's what else do we know that will happen in our day well not Elijah Elijah wasn't going to come in the upper room he was to come at the evening time so that's a scripture we can latch on to and say the word that fell at day in Pentecost won't work today right right he's still pouring out his spirit because it's a dispensation but we've got scriptures to cling to that he's fulfilling today I'll have a church without spot without ringer I'll have a bride Pentecost in the upper room was the birth of the church he poured out his Spirit we're not in the birth of the church Christ isn't going to marry an infant Christ isn't going to marry a baby but after 2,000 years he's going to marry a mature woman who's mature in the word of God that's come the word like him so much that they're one can you say Amen so we're really not we shouldn't only preach that we're going back to Pentecost we're going back to the faith we're going to back to the spirit can you say Amen but when we realize the word that fell on the day of Pentecost won't work today we have another word to be fulfilled and I'm living right in the middle of it right now is that okay with everybody the these statements for first you go w wow wow and it crosses Pentecostal theology because they only want to use the scripture I'll pour out my spirit in the last days and that's what's happening well it is but that's a whole dispensation God has other scriptures to fulfill during the time we live in Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 in the in the days of the son of man when he's revealed acts when it says the restitution of all things Joel 2 in the early verses says I'll restore all the years that the cankerworm the caterpillar so scriptures of restoration justification baptism of justification Sanic baptism of the Holy Ghost so here restore that that scriptures that related and then we get to the end time son of man scriptures we get the bride coming to this masterpiece we get to Revelations 10 1-7 God is fulfilling those words while we speak and you just need to step into the water step into the scripture for your day this is what he's wanting to fulfill in my life the day of church members is over the day of God winking at ignorance is over amen it brings us to the full full word amen I'm having a good time tonight teaching and preaching both so now we see it it's so so now he affects the young the old men the young men the servants the handmaids and we've already covered that that it's not about a position the Pharisees had positions you had a ladder of senority to reach before you could be used of God now he says I pour out my spirit upon the young upon the old upon all the servants God touches someone who has no money or learning slaves servants can you say amen and I'll remind you of numbers the beginning scripture I gave you in numbers when Moses said Lord I can't handle all the pressures of the people I can't I can't bear it myself and God says bring your 70 elders brings them to the Tabernacle he he splits up his Spirit now I want you to notice something here this is Old Testament so we have that happening like the day of Pentecost in the sense that he can split up his Spirit but we know that those 70 elders nor Moses could have his holy ghost in their soul yet so I want you to notice all that God did in the Old Testament By His Holy Spirit by his Holy Ghost and they couldn't get it yet like on the day of Pentecost couldn't get to that level why sin was in their soul the serpent nature was in their soul the same serpent nature you're born with well I was born in the message no no no no no you were born with the serpent nature and you'll battle that your whole life until you find God's answer and the answer is his holy ghost comes on the soul level and changes your desires kills the serpent nature and the new soul that soul is down there that Soul filled with God now can respond properly to the word of God but you see now the elders here it is and Moses say said would to God that all of God's people were prophets would to God that they all be filled but they're all I want you I want you to really notice now God could split his Spirit up on their spirit level and they could all be distributed the spirit of God among 70 how many how many followers did Jesus call to go out and heal the sick and to pray for the sick and cast out Devils anybody remember same number 70 70 under Moses and God split his spirit and then Jesus said I'll call you 70 I'm going to send you out two by two and I'm going to put my spirit I I'm GNA use you with now this is before Pentecost everybody listening you'll cast out Devils you'll heal the sick you'll do many wonderful things all with no holy ghost in the soul I just want to show you there has has to be a distinction between all the Holy Ghost can do on a person's spirit before they get it in their soul they went out casting out Devils God gave them as a spirit to do it come back and rejoice praise God even the devils are so we walk into houses the two of us and the devils are already scared when we get there they don't have the Holy Ghost in their soul but they've got a portion of his Spirit that's given them power that's right all of these things were happen happening before the day of Pentecost so we cannot make a restoration to Pentecost today the evidence only of the manifestations of casting out Devils because they already had that before the day of Pentecost now did they cast out Devils after yes they did and it was it powerful yes it was do we still cast out Devils today the church still does that commission is never you'll cast if if you drink any deadly thing you'll tread on serpents there's power in the church can you say Amen it's there it's even probably more powerful when you get it in your soul my it's probably even more powerful because you know your position you can be positioned I'm a Son of God now I'm connected to God can you say Amen I'm not afraid of any Devils but all of those things happened before the day of Pentecost so Pentecostal power of the Holy Ghost has to be more than just casting out devil and healings please respect me those who are listening those here tonight I'm not belittling healing at all because the Holy Ghost does it every service here the Holy Ghost cast out Devils said well we didn't bring anybody Altar and cast out Devils I was casting them out while I was preaching this past Sunday any true Minister that's bringing this word and you bring spirits on you if you'll yield I'm casting out Devils every service not by Paula Fontaine but by the word coming forth how many raise your hand and say say I had a bad Spirit on me tonight no don't say tonight but when I left God delivered me of that while the preaching of the word how many you said I was healed while the preaching was going forth he sent his word how many say so for me I received the Holy Ghost myself while the word was being preached I didn't need to come to an altar Lord come to an altar great respond to God all that's in place I just want to say all of these works and manifestations happened before for and I like to bring up the point not to belittle what God does he does it God can do it but there are great Miracles that happen outside of our ranks and God does them raising the dead healings and I say God did that and they weren't in the message they weren't around so you can't make that the final Revival of the bride only healings is it okay with everybody it has to be something more and we'll get into where the Holy Ghost is taking us in the evening time what it finishes with and what the bride's Revival really is it won't just be another healing it will be including healing it'll be including the truth of justification including the baptism of the Holy Ghost including the restoration of the gifts I believe in every gift in the church I just won't manipulate to try to make them happen I will not do that I'm going to preach 10 service on until we see the gifts of the Spirit I know to preach the word when people get yielded the gifts will work in their lives but I'm not going to say we're not having any nothing going on here because we haven't seen the gift in tongues in a long time we need to see that I'm not going to manipulate that because today it's deeper than the gifts it's the giver it's the giver can I can you say Amen it's the giver it's Christ who gave the gifts we want him more than anything we want the Masterpiece to be built in our lives we want to come to that mature divine love sons of God come into the manifestation of maturity and adoption all the power you see it's it's power and character the bride's final Revival I might as well spill it out I believe is that maturity coming in a bride she's not a young infant she's not playing with the gifts but she's come to maturity she's got the gifts she's got all the things she's she's filled with the spirit of God can you say amen and the final thing to me will be power in this bride and character in this bride not power without character not power with immaturities but she'll be a mature bride in the word know how to handle the word know how to handle the gifts and if those gifts are messing up we don't mess with them somebody prophesies something and it doesn't come to pass they need to repent of that we want the real thing or we don't want it all we don't want to just play with these things and the mature bride of Christ says I want the power that comes with this in my life every day but I want the character to be molded in me to manifest these things right so you can't go back and just pull Jo Joel 228 and say in the in the evening time it'll be a pouring out of his Spirit again the same and repeating just the same things in the day of Pentecost it'll be that but it'll be even more it's taking us somewhere in this final Capstone I want to talk about where the Holy Ghost would go but I'm I'm have to talk only a certain amount of time because the kids got to go to school we understand that do you understand what we're presenting tonight so now when the church was birthed by the pouring out of the spirit something happened and the Antichrist came in I I believe brother rap was dealing with that in his class on in a couple classes on Sunday morning the Antichrist came in right away within just a few years the Antichrist Spirits begin to work in the church and where the rap's talking about I wish I could get to his class he sent me his notes and it sounds very interesting something happened early on when the spirit was poured out the Antichrist came in and began to push the spirit out push the word out nickan ISM came in and put the put all the Holiness in the pulpit and took it away from the people the Antichrist Spirit limited this pouring out of the spirit we never want to limit the pouring out of the spirit of God we never want to quench the spirit of God that's what that Antichrist Spirit did it preached against it it said we don't want that and we and they changed it all and quenched the spirit and pushed out this moving and pouring out of his Spirit God would have continued it but and this is evident in Jesus words to the denom inational leaders the Pharisees if you're listening and you don't understand that there were denominational leaders in Jesus Day called the Pharisees and Sadducees they were denominations and they were leaders of them and Jesus said to them it's by your traditions and by your Creeds that you're making the word of none effect you're quenching you're ruining what God's trying to do by your dogmas and your Creeds and your Traditions so the word kept be effective the spirit pouring out can't do its work because you bound the People by your Creeds and dogmas and traditions the Holy Spirit ought to have access to every one of your congregations to come in and do whatever he wants to do but you have limited you have squelched it you've some of you churches have preached that the days of Miracles are even passed it only happened with the apostles you brother sister I love you but you do not have a right to say that the days of Miracles are passed cuz they're still happening right here in this church today you don't have a church that believes that in this city you come you come and we'll give testimony after testimony that the days of Miracles are still happening today yes so you don't have a right like the Antichrist Spirit to squelch all that and squelch people saying amen and squelch people the spirit of God moving he's always wanting to be given the freedom to pour out upon the people and your Creeds and dogmas has made the the the no effect to the people so this is so so now we see now this happened if you want to pull up the first quote here's how what here's what happened in this 2,000 years segment of the pouring out of his Spirit here's what happened he said the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years so this is what happened by these denominational Rivers for 2,000 years in this dispensation of the pouring out of the spirit of God something something happened and that is denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years bound the Holy Spirit from moving his promise said I'll pour out my spirit every Church age but it didn't have the fullness to pour out because they restricted it God couldn't pour out he didn't have the freedom to bring the word and have ministers that bring it bring the freedom of the word but look at this found for 2,000 years by by denomination but it is to be loosed in the evening time now we have not the last days but the evening time the last of the last days the Holy Ghost is to be loose in the evening time by the evening time message there's what the message is I said there's what the message is it's not a code to live by it's not a dress code this is what it really is you have this Holy Spirit loose to people's lives you don't have to worry about the dress Cod code can I get an amen the message has become a code the message has become a denomination it's become all these other things but the message itself came to loose the Holy Ghost to the people the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time somebody say praise the Lord so this is what happened and what is to happen at the end time Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time not just an anointing not just a baptism on your flesh not just a pouring out again of his spirit and full restoration of the gifts and things not just that but now to bring it to Christ in human flesh again like it was in Jesus 2,000 years ago God in flesh a further purpose than just the birth of the church but the the maturity and the marriage of Christ and his bride he won't marry a child he will marry a mature woman that is matured in the word it's more than a pouring out but it's a final Masterpiece of the second Eve Christ in the evening time here we have the distinction that I've been preaching about I'm getting ready to close here we have the distinction the last days and the evening time it shall be be light about the evening time here's a distinction notice how he explains the progress the progression excuse me of the end time evening time what will happen is not just the pouring out but to bring it to a Perfection that's never happened in all the seven Church ages even with the Holy Ghost being poured out it never brought it to a Perfect Bride into a Perfection a lot of us because the denominational Creeds comeing but it wasn't meant to come to its fullness and prot and and and the final thing till the end time he sends a prophet to begin that restoration and so now the end time the the evening time just give me about five more minutes and I'm done the evening time the last days in the evening time must be separated because at the evening time he begins and if you'll get your Bible this week and read Joel 2 not 28 Joel 2 Joel 2 and read the from 18 on verse 25 in particular I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the P palmerworm my great Army which I sent among you that's the brid tree that Satan ate away at for 2,000 years and God says here's a prophecy for those 2,000 years whatever he ate whatever Satan ate off the bride tree this masterpiece because she has to be smitten too this bride had this masterpiece had to be smitten too she started out good at Pentecost then nickel ananis come in the church system come in and because this bride had to be smitten but she's been smitten and then God says I will restore so now we're talking the evening time a restoration of the word a restoration of Faith a restoration of the gifts and a restoration but but when all that restoration has come to his completion he's just not wanting to restore us he's taking us back to the second Eve coming to be married to Christ so it's not just a pouring out of his spirit it's more than that he sums it up by saying this the second quote if you would in Masterpiece notice here oh boy I got a bunch here more here and I I can't finish it tonight notice here the life that was in the husk stand up so I that's my signal to close but don't don't lose this quote now notice here the life that was in the husk in the stock and in the tassel he's taken the stages of the wheat and he's taken the stages being this restoration of of Luther's day of Wesley's day life was in Luther's Day Life came through Wesley's day but then they all denominated life came in isusa street but then they denominated the spirit left it right the spirit left it every time you denominate you you restrict the Holy Spirit right so he said the life that was in the star went one went to the other this is how he words it justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made away for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the Zeus Street that's Ben cost restoration of the gifts it's not over it's not done there the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back back to the word again to manifest itself you see why I say it's not just a pouring out of his Spirit there's an end result to the pouring out of his Spirit we pray say God pour your spirit out but what's that going to do to us it's not just to give us a feeling or sensation or bring us into another denomination this time when he pours it out he's going to take it from just a baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Spirit himself coming down into Perfection into the church's lives amen I got so excited about this today and I believe that you should be can you say amen and I'll just close this by saying when he is pouring out his spirit and bringing the right atmosphere no matter where it is see because I know every believer knows when God's present and I said when he's present there's noise I believe that but I have never been afraid of the presence of God I can join in wherever I'm at and if it's the presence of the Lord people get to worshiping and you know might some people might get in the flesh listen I'm going to jump in and Worship the Lord because I know in maturity what he really wants to do I know I mean I I told you a few months ago I was there at that youth camp and dancing myself I haven't danced in a long time but I don't have to dance every service to prove that I got the Holy Ghost but that Spirit came in that poured out on those young people and I was dancing before the Lord and I haven't done that in a long time but I don't use that as an Evidence but I sure enjoyed it and I was rejoicing I can jump in and I can enjoy the presence of the Lord wherever it is because I know in that atmosphere a lot of things can take place when you come this Sunday or any service even tonight even though you're tired but because I always tell people you're tired tired and I respect that but I'm tired too I'm still a little sick actually but we can't use tired as an excuse to stay home but when you come you ought to get over that a little bit and say we really want the spirit of the Lord to come tonight because in that spirit and I'm and when it happens I'm going to jump into it because it'll not only wake you up it'll not only wake you up a little bit but you say what could God do when he pours out his Spirit you should never stop Desiring God God this is a Wednesday night there's only 20 of us here but pour out your spirit I need it Lord I need it I thank you for all I've I got but I need more can you say Amen pour out your spirit upon all of us there'll be many manifestations and and I can worship but I can never use any of those manifestations as an Evidence you want to look to your action in the word of God there'll be a lot of noise but then if if you feel free in the anointing and uh I was born to live in that anointing I'm born to live in that presence I love it but the new birth going on in the inside is something deeper can you say amen I don't want to leave without the spirit of God moving in every service every day of my life but pray that when that Spirit pours out again that he calls his elect to a real baptism in the Soul the greatest thing he can do is secretly change the desires of the inside of you to have life come into you power of life that overcomes in that pouring out the spirit the greatest thing you can pray is that Lord give me the life of that because the life will overcome on Monday it's not just a feeling Sunday it's not a c meeting it's not a healing line it'll overcome the devil on Monday that's the power that you want and so if he comes and moves can he step into the water wait out a little bit deeper wet your feet in the water of his love oh step into the water oh wait out a little bit deeper come join angels singing praises to the Lamb of up just a couple oh step into the that's what you want to do wait out a little bit deeper wet your feet in the water of his love step into the W oh wait out a little bit deeper come join angels singing praises to the Lamb of God so you jump in there you say I feel the spirit pouring out you jump right in say God I'm right in it but I want you to do something deep in my life I want would you lift your hands father God thank you for Thy word tonight Lord I don't have much of a voice left but my soul is rejoicing and praising God thank you for this word thank you for opening up my understanding this afternoon as we looked at it again we see many things opening to us and we're thankful Lord to live in the age that we live in and this evening time prepare us fill us send your spirit Lord I pray this Sunday as We Gather send your Holy Spirit and do Mighty things in our midst change lives and we commit it to you now and what's been said as we
