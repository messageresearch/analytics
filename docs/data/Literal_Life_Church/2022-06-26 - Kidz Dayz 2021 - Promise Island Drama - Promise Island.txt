activities yes okay guys we don't have time for 110 kids okay so everybody put your hands down we're just gonna talk for a second a couple of years ago once upon a time a couple of years ago this is a real story okay everybody close your eyes there was these two little girls and they came to kids days when they came to kids days they loved it so much that they went home and they heard about that we were they were taking an offering for kids days that night okay he wants to say something um you like the pirate the water slide a lot the water slide did you go on the water slide i'm too afraid to go on that i want mama okay all right we'll get some more later okay you guys can see it later everyone put your hands down we're going back to our store close your eyes back to our story of our two little girls and these two little girls liked kids days so much that they went home and they started doing chores and started saving their pennies and their quarters and their dimes and they started bringing it to church and giving it to sister sheeran that's me and they started saying i want to give this money to kids day so we can have another kid's days and so the story goes that just like when jesus in the bible multiplied the loaves and the fishes from that one little boy that the two little girls gave a little bit of money and then god multiplied it and made it possible for us to do kids this kid's days this year isn't that exciting yes very good very good so and those two little girls are here but i won't embarrass them but i would like to show you something that they made for this year for other people to be able to give this is their box that they made for everybody else to be able to give to kids days for next time okay so we're gonna leave this at the church they painted this this is one side of the box it has ships on it ocean and this is my favorite part they did this with paint water paints from their house and then on this side you can see the little girl and this is an island girl with a little hut they made this from stuff they had at their house so they built this box so we're gonna leave this here outside and if anybody wants to give to kids days next year they can give the kids days now kids days takes a lot of work and not only work but it takes a lot of money takes about seven thousand dollars to do kids days every year and it takes about 50 or more people to work hard that's a lot of people to work right so that's the wonderful thing is that god through the whole year this year has provided the people and the funds and we would love to honor one person tonight who has given almost pretty much 90 percent of the funds for kids days this year have come from this one person and so tammy dye i would like you to come on up here [Music] [Applause] and this girl she's gonna be mad at me she don't want me to tell anybody nothing but this is one of my best buds she's my tax lady and uh she believes in kids days she was there to do your craft does everybody recognize her she's been she's been the craft lady at kids days for probably over 10 years right at least at least 10 years and god has blessed her abundantly through her tax business and her husband has a rv say the name of his business toledo mobile rv repair yes repair business and you guys that's how god takes the loaves and fishes and multiplies he use little kids sometimes to multiply things and we love you tammy thank you so much and all the kids give her a cheer [Music] thank you i appreciate it like i said i love kids days very very much sharon got me hooked on it's her fault and because um god's been good to me i believe in giving out to everybody so 10 always go aways goes to god and he gives us back everything so yeah that's the reason why kids stay is needed because god told me take care of this lady so that's what i'm doing take care of you kids give her a hand all right [Applause] so online we have a website i don't know if they're putting it up on the thing but if you go to the literal life website there's a way that you can give two kids days and the future is this i get requests all of the time from churches and schools we've done 10 of these 10 different themes for kids days we have all the songs written all the dramas everything and we want to be able to publish this and give it to have other kids be able to enjoy it around the world so if you have been blessed by kids days then remember that throughout the year and remember to give toward kids days tonight so we are going to start are you guys ready to start yeah [Music] okay guys we're ready to rumble ladies and gentlemen start your engines all right here we go kids days 2021. is beyond the setting of many signs before the stars were formed the great god of all creation envisioned a plan for his people a plan to be prosperous and to enjoy good health a plan to live in a place of harmony and peace a place of promise and so he formed this island and as our island rose from the sea the children of the great god came to settle here and god graciously gifted his people with promises these promises were engraved on stones by our great great great grandfathers to preserve the truth to bring life to the island and to light the way for future generations [Music] we the people of promise to be is we vow to protect them to hold them dear to our hearts [Music] and when the time comes their darkness will cover our bright island but we must remain vigilant for our for when the for when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the great god will rise up a standard against him [Music] and he will provide for us a savior and he also promised [Music] that in our darkest times we can trust in him to be our light we will keep and protect these promises we thank the great god for these promised stones and for giving us this place this home this island welcome to promise island [Music] welcome to promise island welcome to paradise welcome to promised islands come and join us [Music] just give [Music] island come enjoy [Music] welcome to paradise welcome to promise island come enjoy the sun in the blue skies [Music] welcome to promise [Music] [Music] join the sun come and join us [Music] so throughout the years the promised stones were a reminder of god's great love for his people his light shined down on the island and filled the air with laughter and warmth but everything seemed perfect but one dark and stormy night a ship landed on the shores of our island and who was the captain of this ship the dread pirate of the seas jacoby and his band of pirates [Music] they landed on our shores with an evil plan a plan to deceive the people of promise island a plan to steal the promised stones and a plan to take over it's just my island now jacoby and his band of pirates hid the promised stones deep in a cave so that no one could find him he hoped that eventually the people of promise island would forget about the stones and turn to him instead of the great god [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] as time passed the islanders fearful of jacoby and his dark ways they wanted to challenge him but they decided just to leave jacoby in his band of pirates alone and not make any waves some even gave up looking for the promises and a few even started to believe jock these lies but there were a few who were strong and kept the promises alive in their hearts now children is there any questions about today's lesson yes eliana yes oh child that is my favorite story throughout many dark years grandma kailani taught the children every day about the wonderful promises that god had given to the islanders many years before you see little ones even though the promises have been taken from our hands we can learn to hold them in our hearts that way nothing can stand in our way not even the pirates not even pirates you see one of the promises of the great god is that light will be restored to our island and we will be saved from the darkness i'll save the island oh yes i am ready for you to do that why would the pirates want to steal our promises anyways oh why would the promises want to be stolen why would they steal them i'll tell you why because that mean old jacoby he thinks that he can get us to forget the promises and believe his lies he knows that the promises bring hope and light in times of darkness but the beautiful part about this is there are so many promises we can hardly count them all let's try to do that right now okay bring those instruments out and let's play a little music okay here we go one two three they're all in me hitting in my heart to stay promises don't go away no i believe just what he'd say one two three they're all in me he will never leave you nor forsake you that's why he is always there in time of need [Music] we have just begun take them one by one hold them in your hearts and just believe me one two three [Music] they're on me the enemy can steal the peace of god [Music] his mercy is new with every dawn as many as the sand from [Music] one two three one two [Music] here three go all right nope [Music] is [Music] i don't think they'd want any of this food anyway [Music] you need to stop thinking like that talia remember what grandma keilani always said fear not the great god is always with us he will make the sun shine again you will see [Music] you remember that hymn that she used to teach us to ah [Music] though the oceans may roar and the mountains be shaken i know i'm not forsaken you are with me every step that [Music] you are with me [Music] i know i'm not forsaken [Music] [Music] i know your head will guide me you are with me let's get some sleep [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] frustrations [Music] [Music] so as time went on the islanders gradually began to forget about the promises hope of a bright future began to fade with each passing day the island grew more and more dim the dread pirate jacoby spread his lies and fear and the children of the island started to follow the ways of the pirates instead of being kind the way the great god made them they began to dress act and even fight like the pirates they began bullying each other and making fun of the ones who believed the promises they started listening to the music and the songs of jacoby and his band of pirates and slowly forgot the truth of the promises of the great god the sun was slowly fading on prompt island i'm gonna teach you a little song you ready pirates have you ever heard a song that didn't sound amazing if you listen close enough you'll hear the pirates singing the dreaded pirate jacqueline in the sea the dreaded pirate chocobi will throw your promise in the sea have you ever heard a song that didn't sound amazing if you listen close enough you'll hear the pirates sing the dreaded pirate shacklebee will throw your promise in the sea the dreaded pirate jacoby will throw a promise in the sea have you ever heard a song that didn't sound the dreaded [Music] can we get an art ah yes natalya talia my girl i was just about to show you a few new moves on my new sword are you okay she's waiting what are you wearing and what happened to your hair she's fine just don't worry about it we're just chilling out here dude just relax no thank you don't you see how jacoby is influencing you it's the middle of the day and there is so much work that needs to be done we should all be doing our help our part to help restore this island me i need to be working too yes you too you can use your energy and your strength to restore this island and get the promised stones back instead of hanging around here with all these lazy pirates i mean look at this hey who are you calling lazy buffs you see but i'm a pirate i'm a bad guy i i don't know why god would ever need me or or want me to be on his side makoa it's not about who we think we are but what god has called us to be see he doesn't define us by our past but by our future all we have to do is start believing and have faith in the great god promise island can be good once again [Music] you better leave right now makoa this island it's a gift from god [Music] why don't you just look around does this really look like a god-given land to you do you really think there's a hope for a brighter future yes i do what are you so worried about jacoby i'm just having a little talk with your head pirate here there's no harm in that is there no harm no harm at all [Music] he's [Music] please makoa do you remember the island before all this have you heard the teaching of the elders and the promises the great god is for us no one can stand against us even the darkest night can't hide away the light one day the sun will break through that day is coming soon [Music] how would it be if you finally believed in the truth what's going on here don't let him persuade you this island is better the way that it is don't even talk about those promises don't let him persuade you your life is better the way that it is don't even talk about those promises don't let him persuade you [Music] this is good versus evil truth versus lie what you believe only you can decide nah stop trying to take what doesn't belong to you what doesn't belong to me you've taken my land you've taken my friends you're taking my family [Music] and it's got to end i challenge you no i challenge you i don't know what to do [Applause] hmm [Music] the island was bustling with the exciting news of the young lad who was challenging the dreaded jockey but excitement was the last thing mikala was feeling dear god i know that i'm not strong enough to go against such a strong enemy by myself but i also know that in my weakness you have made me strong you always have my back i thank you for your promises and believe that with you all things are possible i am offering myself to you to use for your honor and glory help me restore what has been stolen from your people we are holding on to the promise of a better future god help me restore the light to promise island in your name i pray [Music] my amen [Music] [Music] the big day had finally arrived no one had ever challenged the dreaded jacoby before so the islanders had a feeling that something extraordinary was about to happen [Music] yes before we begin we have a musical musical number by our band of pirates have you ever heard a song that didn't sound amazing you and your band of friends or whatever need to settle down oh here comes michael or jacoby [Music] and what makes you think you're so perfect i am not perfect but i am chosen by god and those promises belong to me thought [Music] we don't have to do this just give me back the promised stones peacefully please foolish boy those promises are lost forever and as far as all of these people go they will answer to me now you see jacoby we don't have to answer to you or your lies any longer even if i perish god will raise up another one to fight and another and another until you are defeated forever well we'll see about that [Music] you can just nice fight boy come on you see people no one defeats the great jacoby and as far as these promised stones go they can go with you what give me back those stones woman not today man we'll see about dead what are you doing this is good versus evil truth versus lie what i believe only i can decide i have believed you for the very last time he was right along those promises have power in them to restore our land not only that but god has given us the power you are just a pirate and that's all you'll ever i refuse i refuse to believe your lies any longer jeopardy the great god he is real yes and he does not define me by my past but by my future [Applause] you have brought nothing he has brought nothing but pain and suffering to this island and it ends right now [Music] yes for i am persuaded that not even death can separate us from the love of god oh your step here has come to an end jacoby yes leave get out [Applause] thanks man what made you want to defend the promises well it was when i think it was when you reminded me of what this island what it used to look like it was something deep inside of me calling me to to fight for what's right i i know that sounds kind of dumb but no when god speaks to you it is never dumb you should always listen would you mind praying with me and asking the great god to come to your life and guide you yes i would love that [Music] wow a pirate's life this is all it's cracked up to be is it folks the byron jacoby promised all kinds of a wonderful great fun time on this island forget the promises forget the rules forget the principles of god's word you don't need that he said it'll be a great fun time to the pirate jacoby and that's actually the very same thing that the devil tries to tell each one of us today the promised islands that we just saw portrayed it's not that very far away from us actually it's the very world that we lived in god created this world a place of peace a place of prosperity where he could grow and develop and serve him but it's not become that today i just grabbed a newspaper this morning tell you what it looks a lot like the promised eye on the jacobi made it this isn't the promised island that god wants us as god has designed us for titus come up here bud each one of you kids you might have grown up in a church might have grown up somewhere else you may have grown up not knowing god you might have grown up knowing god it doesn't matter but what the devil wants to do he wants to convince you you're a pirate you're a sinner you're mine you're one of jacobi's guys you're one of the devil's guys that's what the pirate jackaby that's what the devil is still doing and with each one of you today he wants you to listen to his music he wants you to read his books he wants you to watch his videos on youtube so that you are convinced i'm a pirate that's what he wants you to convince are you a pirate though but you're not a pirate you're dressed like a pirate the devil's got you thinking sometimes you're a pirate but god has something so much better planned for each one of us god wants us to be his child he wants to take off these signs of a pirate why do we have to wear a patch over a pirate we can't see very well with this patch exactly the devil's deceiving us so you can't see well he wants to convince you you're his but take that patch off you don't need it you're not a pirate the promises are yours take this patch off take this off you're not a pirate you're a son of god but and you know what that is what repentance is all about repentance is all about saying no i don't i don't believe what the devil's telling me about who i am i'm not that i'm not a son of the devil i'm a son of god and if the devil's ever whispered that into your ear that it's gone you've gone too far that's hopeless you've served the devil too long he's wrong because the promises are still here god is still a deliverer he is still a savior he is still a healer it doesn't matter what it is there is no other name under heaven where by me we must be saved it's jesus christ and that name is still here today jesus christ and if you've never put your faith if you've never put your faith in jesus christ you'll be believing that you're a pirate in your heart but turn that off close your eyes with me pray that we might believe yes lord i pray that you would forgive me for believing the devil's lies i pray that you would forgive me lord for listening to the wrong things following the wrong influences forgive me lord and i pray o god that your spirit would come and cut that off i might believe that i am your son that you would forgive me of yours of my sins lord give me peace where there's been anger with me calm where there's been bitterness oh lord i pray that you would take all those things of jacobi away and give me your spirit on the inside that is god's plan for your life kids and you know what we're living in the world right now but there's no good news there's no good news in this world but you open god's word and there's many precious promises that tell us by the new world that's coming that's much better than this and i want to live by those promises still today amen amen wow i feel i feel so good i feel i feel clean i feel i feel free i feel like i don't have to go to the pirate ways any longer grandma kelani i feel like i'm walking on clouds but those promises do i get do i get a part of that makoa these belong to you as well the sun started to shine again on promised island and the son of god started shining even brighter in all the hearts of those who invited him to come and live inside the people of cross once again had hope for a very bright future come on out people of promise come out and enjoy the sun come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] so um [Music] forever [Applause] [Music] um [Applause] [Music] we need
