[4:30] you
[4:31] [Music]
[4:34] are now I to PR you heav may I praise
[4:41] you you're the Healer of my
[4:46] heart Hebrews chapter 4 we're reading in
[4:49] verse if you start reading with me at
[4:51] verse 6 seeing therefore it remaineth
[4:53] that some must enter therein and they to
[4:56] whom it was first preached entered in
[5:00] be entered not in because of unbelief so
[5:03] seeing there was a generation that did
[5:05] not enter into the land and enter into
[5:07] rest seeing therefore it remaineth
[5:10] somewhat uh some must there enter
[5:13] therein he says in verse 7 again he
[5:16] limith a certain day saying in David
[5:19] today after so long a time as it is said
[5:22] today if ye will hear his voice Harden
[5:26] not your hearts so you can see here that
[5:29] he's given the Next Generation a chance
[5:32] because as they failed in the past to
[5:34] enter into the full land he says here's
[5:37] another day that I have set for a chance
[5:40] for the new generation and if you'll
[5:42] hear his voice and you won't Harden your
[5:44] heart you have a chance to enter in
[5:47] verse eight for if Jesus which is Joshua
[5:50] there if Joshua had given them rest then
[5:53] would he not afterward have spoken of
[5:55] another day there remaineth therefore a
[5:57] rest to the people of God for he that
[6:00] has entered into his rest he also hath
[6:03] ceased from his own works as God did
[6:06] from his let us labor therefore to enter
[6:10] into that rest lest any man fall after
[6:13] the same example of unbelief there's a
[6:17] small section here of some practical
[6:20] examples um I have not got to in the
[6:23] last few services on Sunday and talking
[6:25] about the new generation talking about
[6:27] what they have to leave from the old
[6:28] generation
[6:30] and there's certain examples in
[6:31] scripture I haven't got to so I had left
[6:33] this and I hope that we can get to some
[6:35] of it and speak a little bit about it uh
[6:37] I have been using some of the places in
[6:39] Scripture that refer to the new
[6:41] generation and to specifically their
[6:43] fathers there's a term in the Bible
[6:46] we've been using and reading from
[6:47] different places and that's called your
[6:49] fathers they say your fathers did this
[6:51] in the wilderness your even Jesus said
[6:54] it your fathers did this in the Wilder
[6:56] your fathers uh had this your fathers
[6:58] did this so when when he refers to the
[7:01] fathers he's looking at past generations
[7:03] and I discovered that it it it covers a
[7:06] a much bigger meaning when he says your
[7:09] fathers it doesn't just mean a certain
[7:12] generation but it can cover a lot of
[7:14] meaning Not only would that apply to our
[7:17] personal fathers and I been dropping a
[7:19] few things in here because To Me the
[7:22] Meaning can be applied to our personal
[7:25] fathers that we receive in life because
[7:27] a lot of times we don't receive well in
[7:30] all cases we don't have perfect fathers
[7:32] and uh some better than others and maybe
[7:35] some worse than others but there's only
[7:37] one perfect heavenly father and we come
[7:40] into a world that has imperfect fathers
[7:42] and so when you refer to that that's the
[7:44] first thing you can talk about it is
[7:46] that that when you go back and look at
[7:48] your father then you can go back and
[7:50] look at what he's done but I I we we
[7:52] learn tonight that we can learn from our
[7:55] father's mistakes how many know that you
[7:58] can learn from your father mistakes this
[8:00] is actually the only victory that you
[8:03] get out of some things sometimes is that
[8:05] you can learn from things if you're if
[8:08] you're defeated for your life if Satan
[8:10] has pronounced doom on you because you
[8:13] didn't have the right domestic life and
[8:15] you didn't have the right father then
[8:17] the devil's going to defeat you the rest
[8:19] of your life but there is a victory for
[8:21] a Believer and that is that we can learn
[8:23] many times and even people of the world
[8:25] can do this even without Christ they can
[8:28] learn what they come from and they can
[8:30] assess the situation and they can take
[8:32] the good and they can dump out the bad
[8:34] and somehow they can have a better life
[8:37] because they just simply say I won't be
[8:39] doomed by the image that I looked at of
[8:41] an imperfect father and so even worldly
[8:44] people can do that but I'm sure there's
[8:46] a much greater victory for a Believer
[8:49] who would recognize that once we make
[8:51] contact with the heavenly father all the
[8:54] things that we're missing the gaps that
[8:56] we're missing the the voids that we
[8:58] missed for
[9:00] by our Earthly father can be filled by
[9:02] our heavenly father how many believe
[9:05] that blessed be his name so but now when
[9:08] he says our fathers it's not just our
[9:09] personal father but it represents when
[9:12] he says it the generations before us it
[9:15] can also take on a meaning of anything
[9:17] that has been an influence on you in
[9:20] your past in your years of Beginnings
[9:23] when he says your fathers it can mean
[9:25] and that's why this is such an important
[9:27] subject because when it refers to your
[9:28] fathers it can mean your history and
[9:31] your Beginnings as a child or your
[9:34] Beginnings as a new Christian these are
[9:37] such formative years your Beginnings are
[9:41] such formative years that if you didn't
[9:43] have the right leadership you didn't
[9:45] have the right mentorship you didn't
[9:47] have the right daddy in your formative
[9:49] years that's a terrible situation
[9:51] sometimes because you're supposed to
[9:53] have the right type of guidance in your
[9:56] very impressionable innocent form of
[9:59] years you're supposed to have the right
[10:01] kind of leadership a lot of times we
[10:03] don't get it and that's why in scripture
[10:06] sometimes it refers to your fathers it's
[10:08] not just physical fathers not just
[10:11] patriarch fathers like like we talked
[10:13] about Sunday uh he'll turn the hearts of
[10:16] the fathers to the children well that's
[10:17] a positive thing about fathers because
[10:19] this Elijah will turn our hearts back to
[10:22] the Pentecostal fathers and the faith of
[10:24] Pentecost so that's a good thing can you
[10:26] say Amen but fathers can represent our
[10:29] past Beginnings anything that represents
[10:32] our influence that was on our lives in
[10:35] our years of of our formative years and
[10:38] let me take it even deeper than that
[10:40] your fathers means your religious
[10:43] background or your past and other words
[10:46] if you had a religious background then
[10:49] when it refers to the fathers then you
[10:50] realize that that had a a a spiritual
[10:53] meaning to you whether good or bad it's
[10:55] your spiritual Beginnings it's your
[10:57] formative years and it means your
[10:59] religious background so how many knows
[11:01] that Paul had to take everything he had
[11:04] learned in the theological schools and
[11:07] he had to basically said I had to forget
[11:08] it all I had to consider it as dung
[11:11] because I couldn't properly receive
[11:13] Christ until I forgot all those things
[11:16] and left all of that that was his
[11:18] religious Beginnings that he had to
[11:20] leave and exit all of that because if he
[11:24] tried to mix it together it was a
[11:26] hindrance to him so these are things to
[11:30] think about because uh there's a lot of
[11:33] people and most people have a religious
[11:35] background of some kind most people have
[11:38] some type of religious upbringing of
[11:40] some kind and sometimes that's not
[11:44] altogether
[11:46] great so when when it refers to the
[11:48] fathers and coming out uh because I want
[11:51] to talk about learning from the mistakes
[11:53] of our fathers we all can relate to this
[11:55] because there's things in the beginning
[11:57] in our formative years maybe even as a
[11:59] new Christian that didn't go quite well
[12:03] and so we will need to overcome we will
[12:05] need to look at that and say Lord I want
[12:08] to learn from the mistakes of my past
[12:11] but I don't want to be bound by those
[12:13] things I don't want to live in defeat
[12:15] because of those things can you say Amen
[12:18] so most places in Scripture it means
[12:20] your fathers they knew God in some way
[12:23] when Jesus referred to the Pharisees
[12:25] your fathers well they knew Jehovah God
[12:27] these weren't unbelieving fathers
[12:30] their fathers were not unbelieving he's
[12:32] not referring to Earthly fathers or
[12:34] worldly fathers that were just outright
[12:36] heathens we know Abraham was a heathen
[12:38] so I guess uh Isaac could say his father
[12:41] was a heathen in his past life and he
[12:44] came to the Lord but a lot of times it
[12:46] says your fathers it's they believe
[12:48] Jehovah God they grew up knowing the
[12:52] law and yet God has to warn them your
[12:56] fathers didn't have it all right
[12:59] right and whatever they did was wrong
[13:02] you're going to have to come out of it
[13:04] we have to be honest to realize when he
[13:06] refers to your fathers when the the new
[13:09] generation in Deuteronomy was looking at
[13:12] the promised land in front of them he
[13:14] referred to their fathers and he says he
[13:16] says I'm not even going to bring your
[13:18] fathers into the land except Joshua and
[13:20] Caleb they're not even going in those
[13:22] old Fighters are not even going to go in
[13:25] but listen you're going to go in and
[13:27] you're going to have to stop circling in
[13:29] the mountain with all their stuff you're
[13:31] going to have to rise to the occasion
[13:33] and move past these fathers in order for
[13:36] you to get to the full
[13:38] impact of the land and you're going to
[13:40] need courage to do
[13:42] it amen so you know there's a call to
[13:47] learn from the examples of the fathers
[13:51] whether human or whether spiritual
[13:53] fathers or whatever it is there's a call
[13:55] to learn from their example and I'm
[13:57] going to read a few scriptures related
[13:58] to that tonight he says look at the
[14:00] example and that you shouldn't follow I
[14:02] read to the scripture he says that we
[14:04] should not follow the same example of
[14:07] unbelief so everything is about example
[14:09] everything is about the example that you
[14:11] got fathers are supposed to be examples
[14:13] but if you had the example that wasn't
[14:15] right then he says you don't want to
[14:17] follow the fall it says lest any man
[14:20] should fall after the same example of
[14:23] unbelief that's the that's the risk of
[14:25] it all is that you would fall too that
[14:27] you would unbelieve too that you would
[14:29] you would not believe that you would
[14:30] miss the mark yourself that you wouldn't
[14:32] get a hold of the high calling in Christ
[14:34] the risk is that you fall after the same
[14:37] example of unbelief God does not want us
[14:41] to do that he's got something better for
[14:43] us he's got something greater for us
[14:45] he's got something better for our
[14:47] families he's got something better for
[14:49] our lives you can't let the past smother
[14:53] over the
[14:55] future praise be to God you can't let it
[14:58] do do that can you say amen and so when
[15:01] God says learn from the examples there's
[15:03] there's a chance that God gives to learn
[15:06] from that and we we we take the good and
[15:10] we purge the bad that's what we do we
[15:12] take the good but we have to purge the
[15:14] bad and make something better out of it
[15:17] you know God's really the author of
[15:19] making lemonade out of lemons he's the
[15:22] one that can do
[15:23] that he can take the worst things he can
[15:27] take a es and make Beauty out of it can
[15:31] you say amen he can take something
[15:34] that's uh defeated and bring Victory out
[15:37] of it can you say Amen Beauty out of it
[15:40] as is Trials turn into testimonies with
[15:43] God can I get an amen he can turn the
[15:46] past into a power the future becomes
[15:49] powerful when there's forgiveness when
[15:51] there's mature understanding and when
[15:53] there's reconciliation of the past he
[15:56] can turn power into your future
[15:59] by the power of forgiveness by the power
[16:02] of a mature understanding you can't keep
[16:04] a childish understanding you can't stay
[16:07] in that mode you must understand what
[16:09] took place you must see this is what
[16:12] happened and bad or good this is what
[16:14] took place but I'm looking at it a
[16:16] mature standpoint can you remember
[16:18] Joseph in the Bible who got a revelation
[16:21] of what happened in his life and he was
[16:23] able to tell his brothers that I have no
[16:25] ill intentions towards you I have no ill
[16:28] fears feelings towards you there's
[16:30] nothing in my heart because I Know What
[16:32] You Did in evil has turned out to my
[16:34] good it's turned out to be the will of
[16:36] God for my life now you're looking from
[16:39] a predestinated point of view now you're
[16:41] looking for a power in your future now
[16:45] you're seeing things from God's
[16:47] perspective but if you stay down here
[16:51] you'll be childish in how you look at it
[16:53] just like everybody else
[16:56] is praise be to God so the future
[16:58] becomes powerful whether it's
[16:59] forgiveness mature understanding and
[17:02] Reconciliation I'm making that point
[17:04] because reconciliation is deeper than
[17:09] forgiveness reconciliation is deeper
[17:11] than forgiveness it's not just
[17:13] forgiveness but if something can be
[17:15] reconciled that's even better God tells
[17:18] us to learn from what is wrong but don't
[17:21] ever let it Doom you to Fair failure can
[17:23] you say Amen I'd like you to turn back
[17:25] to my uh text in Hebrews chapter 3 and
[17:28] we start there it starts here in verse
[17:32] uh 7 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith
[17:35] today if ye will hear his voice Harden
[17:38] not your hearts as in the provocation in
[17:41] the day of Temptation in the wilderness
[17:43] when everybody say your fathers this is
[17:46] the term your fathers tempted me God
[17:48] said they tempted me they proved me and
[17:50] they saw my Works 40 years wherefore I
[17:53] was grieved with that generation and
[17:54] said they do always he in there where
[17:57] did they he at
[17:59] in their heart they were possibly doing
[18:02] everything right A lot of the times by
[18:04] the law but the problem was in their
[18:05] heart they had unbelief in their
[18:08] heart their lips might have been saying
[18:10] the right things but their heart wasn't
[18:12] in it you got to get that together this
[18:15] is the generation that was under Moses
[18:17] now okay they're they're all in as far
[18:20] as the law okay yeah we're on they said
[18:21] we're all in yeah we'll do it but you
[18:23] see there was a problem in the faith of
[18:25] their heart remember he says Harden not
[18:27] your hearts and you'll find this term
[18:29] three times in the text I'm reading now
[18:31] three times he says this is the biggest
[18:34] thing don't Harden your hearts how did
[18:37] their hearts become hard because of
[18:39] their
[18:40] unbelief when you don't fully believe
[18:43] with all your heart you do all the
[18:46] things on the outside maybe but you're
[18:48] not fully in that has a way of wearing
[18:51] on you and you get harder and harder and
[18:54] harder towards the
[18:57] Lord and so when we get harder towards
[18:59] the lord it's even harder to come back
[19:01] to him that's why I talk to people in
[19:02] the world they come from a religious
[19:04] background but their hearts have become
[19:05] hard towards it they don't want to talk
[19:08] about it anymore because something
[19:09] happened in their belief they didn't
[19:11] trust it anymore they didn't believe it
[19:12] anymore the more you disbelieve the more
[19:15] you become Harden your heart this what
[19:18] the Bible's saying Harden not your
[19:20] hearts as they did in the wilderness
[19:21] when your fathers tempted me proved me
[19:23] verse 9 saw my works for 40 years
[19:26] wherefore uh I was grieved with that
[19:29] generation said they do always air in
[19:30] their heart and they have not known my
[19:32] ways I made the point a couple weeks ago
[19:34] here's a big point they knew my works
[19:36] but they didn't know my ways they
[19:39] celebrated my works but they didn't know
[19:41] my character they didn't know who I was
[19:44] they didn't know the reason why I was
[19:46] doing things they didn't understand my
[19:48] heart and if you don't understand God's
[19:50] heart then you're not going to you're
[19:52] going to enjoy the works that he does of
[19:54] course with them when he' do a great
[19:55] work it was great but when he didn't
[19:57] show up quick enough
[19:59] they started to complain so you get used
[20:02] to God showing up quickly and meeting
[20:04] all your needs that's a childish
[20:06] spiritual walk they had always air in
[20:08] their heart they have not known my ways
[20:10] they knew his works but not his ways so
[20:12] I swear in my wrath they shall not enter
[20:13] into my rest that's in your Bible take
[20:16] heed Brethren lest there be any of you
[20:18] an evil heart of unbelief so here's the
[20:20] core of it it's a heart of unbelief
[20:22] they're airing in their heart what is
[20:24] it's a heart of unbelief it's not so
[20:26] much the actions on the outside but it's
[20:28] the heart of UN believe in departing
[20:29] from the Living God but exhort one
[20:31] another daily while it is called today
[20:33] lest any of you be hardened there it is
[20:36] again second time through the
[20:38] deceitfulness of sin which is unbelief
[20:40] for we are made partakers of Christ if
[20:43] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[20:45] steadfast unto the end while it is said
[20:49] today if we will hear his voice Harden
[20:52] not your hearts as in the provocation
[20:56] for some when they had heard did provoke
[20:58] how be it not all that came out of Egypt
[21:00] by Moses but with whom was he grieved
[21:03] for 40 years was it not with them that
[21:05] had sinned whose carcasses fell in the
[21:06] wilderness and to whom swear he that
[21:09] they should not enter into the rest but
[21:11] to them that believe not they didn't get
[21:13] to go into the land because they kept
[21:15] disbelieving so we see that they could
[21:19] not enter in because of
[21:23] unbelief it's pretty important that we
[21:27] trust and we believe with all of our
[21:29] hearts because it's so severe that he
[21:32] actually said you can't go in because
[21:34] you can't get over this unbelief you
[21:37] can't go into the final climax of this
[21:39] which is why he brought him out of Egypt
[21:41] to start with you can't go in that's
[21:43] pretty serious I mean getting in is
[21:46] everything coming into our promis it's
[21:49] everything can you it's why he sends the
[21:51] message and to lose that come short of
[21:54] it and even Moses did because of his
[21:57] temper it's pretty serious cuz that's
[21:59] the most important thing so something
[22:01] happens when there's a lack of believing
[22:03] and trusting in the Heart It produces
[22:05] more hardness I wish I had another
[22:07] sermon to talk about hardness because
[22:10] hardness is uh so much a part it we can
[22:13] becom hard so quickly but why does it
[22:15] come from well it happened because of
[22:17] bad things happening in life not really
[22:19] it's because the trust issue it's
[22:22] trusting it's trusting God it's having
[22:25] faith and having courage to believe his
[22:28] word even when it looks like he's not
[22:30] going to answer we stand there with
[22:32] courage in face of fear and say I
[22:34] believe it with all my heart it's like
[22:36] Abraham saying it's going to happen I'm
[22:38] going to have a child do you feel any
[22:40] different Sarah today and she said
[22:42] Abraham I don't feel any different he
[22:44] said we're going to have it anyhow how
[22:46] about today well she said you asked me
[22:48] yesterday it's another day do you feel
[22:51] any different I don't feel any different
[22:53] praise God we're going to have it anyhow
[22:55] God needs a heart that's all on board
[22:58] can you say amen God needs one that
[23:00] believes his word and Trust his word
[23:03] despite the fear that's ahead of you
[23:05] that's what he needed and when there's a
[23:07] lack of believing and trusting that way
[23:09] when there's a lack of Courage that way
[23:12] then it produces hardness and you become
[23:14] harder and harder and harder and harder
[23:17] and harder and we we we don't want that
[23:20] so don't forget unbelief if you hold on
[23:23] to it makes you more hard all the time
[23:26] believing and having faith and having
[23:29] courage with the voice will bring you
[23:32] into rest now he promised another day in
[23:35] chapter 4 and verse 7 he says this is
[23:38] and this is the the the blessing of the
[23:40] Next
[23:41] Generation again he limith a certain day
[23:44] verse 7 a certain day saying to David
[23:47] today so he actually presents he
[23:50] prophesies of another day to the new
[23:52] generation he sets another day for the
[23:55] new generation that they will have a
[23:57] chance to enter into rest and into the
[24:00] land even though their fathers diff uh
[24:05] didn't
[24:07] Redemption has no limitations to it can
[24:10] you say
[24:11] Amen you can be as low as ever and your
[24:14] fathers could have been low to
[24:17] you but Redemption says I'll give you
[24:20] another I'll give the generation I'll
[24:22] set another day that you have an
[24:24] opportunity to enter into my
[24:26] rest how many say praise the Lord God
[24:29] says I'll I'm going to set another day
[24:32] that they'll have an entrance they can
[24:34] enter into my rest even though the
[24:37] fathers messed up the fathers got it
[24:39] wrong they didn't do it so so he goes on
[24:42] to say here seeing therefore it
[24:43] remaineth verse six that must some must
[24:45] enter therein and they do who they to
[24:47] whom it is first preach entered not in
[24:49] because of unbelief again he limith he
[24:52] set a certain day saying to David today
[24:55] after so long a time as it is said today
[24:58] if ye what is this saying to you I'm
[25:01] gonna give another
[25:03] chance just one more
[25:05] chance today if you hear his voice once
[25:09] again it's the fourth time in there
[25:11] Harden not your
[25:13] hearts was why because that was the
[25:15] problem I'm going to give you a chance
[25:17] again you're going to hear my voice
[25:18] again but when you hear it don't
[25:21] disbelieve and don't let your heart
[25:22] become hard towards
[25:25] it amen for if Jesus Joshua had given
[25:29] them rest then would he have not
[25:30] afterward have spoken of another day
[25:32] there remaineth therefore rest to the
[25:34] people of
[25:36] God Amen for he that has entered into
[25:39] rest he also has ceased from his own
[25:41] works as God did from his let us labor
[25:44] therefore to enter into that rest he's
[25:47] telling the new generation especially
[25:49] now that the Holy Ghost has come which
[25:51] is our rest by the way let us labor
[25:54] therefore our Holy Ghost Promised Land
[25:56] is Our the brother bisco used to say
[25:59] this what is the our land it's not
[26:02] heaven some types are it's about heaven
[26:04] but we need something before Heaven our
[26:08] our our promised land is our life every
[26:11] day in the Holy Ghost and overcoming
[26:15] life every day in the Holy Ghost
[26:18] defeating the enemies of unbelief and
[26:21] then he says this don't fall by the same
[26:24] example learn from their example and you
[26:28] hear this voice so if if you have hear
[26:31] the voice and you have unbelief with it
[26:34] it turns into Hardness of Heart if you
[26:38] hear the voice and you have faith to
[26:40] believe it it turns into you entering
[26:44] into
[26:46] rest it's only two things you got the
[26:49] faith to believe and step out on God's
[26:51] word you enter into that rest not into
[26:54] more Hardness of Heart fathers of this
[26:56] world and in Christianity turn to these
[26:59] things as well because of their lack of
[27:01] full faith in God it has an effect on
