========================================

24 and we greet you on this wednesday night in the name of the lord jesus christ it is such a great privilege to gather together to worship him to feel his presence to feel a breath of fresh air and the book of acts says there should be times of refreshing and i really believe that church is a time for that so we're just glad to be here and glad each of you are here tonight as well we love the lord we love what he's done in our lives we look forward to what he's going to do and each time we hear a portion of the word of god it's special to us and we know that we were this word was meant for a special group of people and that's his people and so when we get into it we realize we may have a connection with it sometimes we read it and we don't understand everything but we're still connected to it and we know god will give us understanding proverbs 24 and verse 30. i went by the field of the slaughter and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down so solemn in his wit by this man who has this vineyard and he's seen it grown over i want you to remember that term it's all grown over with thorns and nettles covered the face thereof and the stone there was broken down and then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction now it's strange that you would look at a man's yard and vineyard and garden and receive instruction but god can speak through anything i received instruction yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth and the and thy want as an armed man may god add his blessings to the word of god you may be seated tonight and i want to speak tonight on a short subject of pulling crab grass don't look at me strange don't laugh at me after a title from last sunday of it's all about the mail that was brother rich's title it's all about the mail it's all about the man i don't know how he got by with that title but he did and what he spoke was truth so don't worry about my pulling crab grass tonight and we are in the season of pulling crab grass you know there are some lessons sometimes that we get by reading by hearing preaching by hearing teaching we not only receive lessons but we receive revelation from the word of god and so there are there are channels that god has given us for us to get lessons from and most of the time it's from reading and hearing and preaching and teaching but then there are some lessons and instruction and even revelation that we get in everyday life and that's everyday life by experience and a lot of that experience is not just going through things ourself but observing the life of others watching the life of others we can receive instruction by watching the life of others and we can we can receive wisdom by looking at the fruit of other people's lives and how they are acting how they are responding and we watch it more than what we'll give up or what more than what we'll admit sometimes that we're very observant of other people's lives and uh often we compare ourselves and the bible says talks about comparing yourselves and evan brother branham mentions also about comparing ourselves and everybody's trying to keep up with the joneses and get what the next person has so in doing that we're always observing we're always looking and those who are on social media are always watching someone else and whether we realize that we learn from that and we take instruction from that and we can be influenced from that and we watch how people act and so we can be watching from sometimes and watch not just a day not just a moment but we can watch for uh many many years from a distance we can watch years unfold in a person's life and then we can see the end result of a person's life and we can observe and see we can watch them for years and then we see the end result of what direction they went and what they did and we can see the fruit of that and sometimes when we look at a life we're impressed sometimes we say we conclude and say you know what if i would like my life to end i would like to end it to end that way um sometimes we are attracted to a life and we say i would like to be more like that there's several mentors in my life that i that i look to and i've looked up to and many of them some of them are even in this church but many of them around the world and i'm glad that god put somebody there because paul said in the bible follow me as i follow christ follow in other words if christ is in that person and you see the fruit of them growing in the fruit of christ then we realize that's a person to follow that's a person to look to and i've said i said i want to be i want i don't want to be like that person i tease preachers sometimes because i'll i'll say them even sometimes when they're younger but when i see something good in them i tell them i want to be just like you when i grow up and uh they kind of chuckle at that because they say the same thing back to me but that's that's something that we look at because we as we get older we look at and we observe things and we see good things and so we're sometimes we're impressed with watching people's lives but sometimes we're disappointed and then we learn from that and watching them and we conclude i don't want to be that way i don't want it to end up that way i don't want to take the same path that that one took i remember uh in the bible there was one of the patriarchs i believe it was isaac or excuse me um jacob and uh uh he he had said when his sons went and uh took the the men of the city and one of them had violated their uh their sister and so they went all the brothers and they went and uh circumcised all the men and and and killed some of them and the daddy didn't know they wouldn't get it when they come back he said you shouldn't have done that and then he prayed he says lord let me not come into that type of anger that's the way he quoted he says lord let me never come into that type of anger so he's saying i've seen what they've done but oh lord i don't want to take that path and sometimes you can look at a life and say i know i don't want to take that path and sometimes you see the path they took and you see the end result and when you see the end result then i know i don't take that path and and a lot of this is learning a lot of this is is growing and i don't want to take that path that didn't work out so well even young people can do that now they can look at people's lives where they ended up and you can learn from that you can get instruction from that and say now if i make the same choices then i could end up the same way so now i have a chance here to make the right choice so my end result isn't that can you say amen and and how many know that a life speaks louder than words life speaks something so when you watch a life you can learn from it we're watching we're watching it and guess what kids don't miss very much kids don't miss very much kids catch a lot more than what we realize i actually believe that what we see has more effect on us than what we are taught i really believe that and that's after i didn't believe that early on as a pastor or a young pastor but i believe it now that it has a great effect upon us what we catch and what we observe and what we see in images you can tell a teenager all day long don't do this don't start that don't get that started don't let that in your life and they many times struggle with it because basically it's an instruction from a parent or a pastor and from the scripture don't do that don't do that and so they struggle with it they're still blind to maybe where it would go if they make that choice until until they would look at the lives who took that path and when they really look at that then that's a greater revelation to realize not only does the word say it not only does my parents say it but somebody who took that path this is where they ended up so it's instructional isn't it it teaches us and watching the lives of people sometimes young people make the choice as they watch a divide in marriage they'll make a choice now i'm going to look at the life of my mom and my dad and unfortunately that's unvery it's the most unfortunate thing for a kid to have to make a choice between mom and dad but they're allowed by the courts to make a choice what do you want to do get to a certain age which one do you want to be with and they'll look at what they feel the security in their hearts and the comfort in their hearts this is something i feel more secure with to go with this is what i'd like my life to be someday and see all these things have an effect on us and we are we are instructed by certain things as we watch lives and uh you know you take a teenager that won't listen take them to a prison sometime let them sit all day in a prison and let them talk to people in the prison and by the way they will talk to you especially a young teen and they'll share their life and they'll share the choices they make and sometimes there's even a a documentary that was mentioned to me by brother mike carter and they actually do that they take kids that are making the wrong choices and they take them to a prison and let them sit down all day with them and then they they let them talk with them they see their lives they see where they're at how tragic it was and see where they're at now and it actually in some cases can sober the kid up and to realize listen this has been something to me i don't want to take this path so uh you know i think these things are are something that jesus said we shall know them by their fruits not by the seed but by the fruits the fruits the seed produced so and the interesting thing about a seed is you can look at this you can't see a seed until you put it in the ground then you can you see it but you can't see it when you put it in the ground so a seed the seed form a lot of that we don't see it's not visible but we see the fruit of a seed so we see the life of a person we see what it produced can you say about and we make choices based upon the fruits and jesus said you shall know them by the fruits a man told me one time here many years ago and as i was laboring and preaching against watching worldly movies and these chick flicks and sometimes things under a category of maybe not a rated r but just a chick flicks and it's a romantic comedy and so i was just really blasting that thing that it can be just as damaging to your spirit and your mind and every time you get on those you're not a very popular preacher because sometimes people give a lot of room in their lives privately to watch these chick flicks and but i was noticing he come up right out to me after the service he says that's exactly the truth and you need to preach on that he says i'm i i and i don't want to describe too many details but he said i can tell you clearly that the start of my wife and i divorcing the start of it and adultery in the marriage the start of it was that we sat countless hours and watched these romantic comedies and watched these these netflix and he said then that's that's where it ended up he said that's the start of an adultery in a marriage so if you could see the devastation you'd make this different choices sometimes can you say amen kind of quiet tonight but i'm going to continue on this is what solomon did here in the text when we read that he got a huge lesson by walking by someone's garden someone's yard solomon walked by a vineyard and he seen the garden not kept up seeing the garden was not kept up so things were falling apart and there was weeds growing and there was nettles growing and there was thorns coming up and so he seen the vineyard and he seen this garden was not thriving it wasn't producing like it should it wasn't beautiful like it should be and he observed it and said he's seen things overgrowing and things coming out and and so and i'm sure that person that owned the house and vineyard they started out they wanted a beautiful every person's want it's a beautiful vineyard a beautiful yard or a beautiful thing but we all realize that if we watch all the if we if we look in all the magazines of the beautiful landscape yards uh it doesn't happen just by a picture can i get an amen out of that tonight at least you know you can look at it all you want to but it takes a lot of work it takes a lot of effort and then once you get it in and it looks beautiful then it takes a lot of work after that to keep it thriving to keep it beautiful can you say ma'am that's why i don't like gardens i don't like to plant all this stuff because there's you know weeds that come up and things and so i in the family get left with weeding and why have a garden when it's going to be all suffocating with weeds and all that and that's just the personal little uh trouble that i have with gardens but you see now uh solomon said it's evident that this person in this so solomon he looked at the garden and he looked at this and it was actually a reflection of the person a bit now that seems a bit critical but it is what it is you know brother burley has been telling me that for two weeks you know it is what it is i love how black people say it it is what it is but paul but but it is your life and you your your home and your life and your finances and things like that it can reflect something that might be lacking in your life and people get defensive when you talk about it but solomon's doing that he's walking by this i'm sure it was a nice person i'm sure they had a great goal to have a vineyard they had a beautiful fruit coming from it grapes and all but it was evident that the person in the house was not willing to put in the time it takes to keep it flourishing and to keep it growing and there was visible outside things that became a reflection of the person in the house because he made that diagnosis he right away called him a sloth he said he's this is a slawful person and he did it by looking at what was taking place outside uh and so so now the visible outside became a reflection of the person in the house and solomon said he's slaughtered and slaughtered means lazy and uh slaughter also means the lack of courage i thought this was interesting an interesting meaning to laziness because we look at laziness a certain way but in the spiritual way laziness is a lack of courage and zeal for the great things god has in store for those who love him can i say it again laziness spiritually is is is kind of the lack of courage or zeal for the great things god has in store for them that love him god has great things in store god has more fruit to bear from your life when jesus in john 15 was speaking about abide in the vine you shall bring forth more fruit and then he goes and said then you'll be pruned and you'll bring even more fruit can you say amen and then he says in other states he said you bring forth much fruit more fruit much fruit and as god keeps pruning us and we keep yielding and he keeps cleaning the garden and all these other things he wants us to bring forth more fruit from this garden that god has given us can you say amen so now i'm reading again the laziness the lack of courage and zeal for the great things god has in store for them that love them how many know that god has great things in store for them that love him we know that can you say man but we we don't want to offer a slackness or a slothfulness or a laziness towards god when we know that there are weeds growing in our garden when we know that there's something that's growing within us and we won't address it we'll let it overgrow everything we can't ignore it can you say amen we have to be willing to say if i want the results that god has promised me then i got to be willing to take these weeds and things in my life and really be serious with them hallelujah solomon said he's lawful he's lazy and then he says the end result will be poverty and an armed robber that's what it means there the end result of that person's life will be poverty in other words they were getting fruit there from their garden but after all the weeds grow up and take away he has no fruit he has nothing to eat and so now he has to go to extreme measures to steal food from someone else an armed robber would go steal food an armed robber if they're not if listen let me say it this way and i'm jumping quickly through things here if they refuse to make their own garden flourish to feed themselves so they'll start stealing from others or bumming off of others or mooching off of others let me say this if if if you don't get the holy spirit yourself then you'll mooch off the holy spirits from somebody else and you can't do that they said give us of your oil we don't have enough for ourselves go and buy and get your own oil amen so now we can't mooch out with somebody else this is your own garden this is your own place to flow this is your own spiritual walk and guess what if everybody falls by the wade side you're not going to want to be depending on them can you say amen if you have to stand alone you want to say lord i'll stand with you and this is my garden and i want my garden to flourish in the name of the lord hallelujah this is mine if i'm only the only one sitting in church on the front row uh which we don't have too many on the front row but lord if i'm the only one i'll be there i'll be worshiping the song leader is going to see me entering in if everybody forsakes this thing i'll be standing because i need the word every day i need to flourish i want to thrive spiritually can you say amen i want to stay in the spirit of revival blessed be his name so this text could be taken many ways it has good lessons in it that i could preach many ways it has good work ethic i could preach on that it it it shows what it leads to leads to poverty i could preach this text and preach about procrastination procrastination i could preach about business i could talk about wealth i could talk about good gardening it's all in there but that's not my subject tonight my subject is pulling crabgrass because i hate crabgrass i hate it and this this lesson tonight that i want to take from this scripture is about thorns and nettles and crabgrass and things that we need to weed out and they're not being weeded out this is a spiritual lesson in laziness spiritual laziness to not root out things that take over a good spirit-filled life be not willing to address what it is that's starting to grow slowly not willing to do it and ignoring it and you can't thrive spiritually that's what this is about tonight so it's about pulling crabgrass and i want to be specific about it so it's about these things my subject is pulling crabgrass because i hate crabgrass crabgrass is trying to be real grass and it's not real grass it doesn't look like rugrats it looks close sometimes but it's not real grass it's crabgrass and it gets right in the middle of real grass and it makes it look bad and this fella in proverbs was not willing to see it and to do something about it and if you don't deal with it it begins to take over it begins to keep growing and the term is grown over everything else grown over and that's that's what you got to look at is that when these things are let go in your life then they grow over the other things grown over they're not meant to be there they're squelching you spiritually they're holding you back and they grow over everything else and it breaks a makes a real bad journey so this thing of addressing our spiritual life and our garden started at the beginning when in genesis 2 15 it says adam and eve he put them in the garden to dress it and to keep it he put them in the garden of eden to dress it so this is part of the original plan of god and i know that was a literal garden of eden but it has a spiritual connotation we preach out of genesis all the time about adam and eve about the first adam the second adam we preach everything so don't leave this part out that god puts a man and woman in a garden to dress it and to keep it and the word keep of course means to guard it so there's a certain guard you put over it from animals getting in or that's why they put a wall up sometimes they that's why they put certain fake animals to scare other animals or scarecrow or whatever but what are you doing you're guarding your garden you're guarding it when you're asleep you're guarding it when you're away because other things could get in and destroy your garden he put them in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it to guard it and but but to dress it uh he said i put them there to to to guard it but to dress a garden means to preserve it to preserve it and to preserve a garden you have to pull things out that don't belong there that's what adam and eve were given as a commission to dress and to guard to preserve to protect this is what they were given and we don't have those things literally today we have a spiritual inheritance we have a spiritual place that god is planting seeds how many knows where the the mind is the womb to the soul the mind is where the seed is planted we want it to drop from the mind to revelation but it starts in the mind and when the mind is all messed up and the mind is too busy and the mind is confused or the mind is filled with pornography or the mind is filled with people that hurt you or the thinking life is filled with all kinds of trash god can't plant that seed properly in you because your mind's all messed up so we're guards over our minds we're preserving our minds because that's the betting ground to plant god's seeds can you say amen so this vessel is a garden of god this vessel is a is this garden that he's given us to to dress and to keep and to guard over and to watch over our minds and to watch over our spirits because god is wanting to bring forth more fruit from our lives so in this man's garden in proverbs it says thorns were there and you know what i'm going to jump to the meetings now thorns speak of defenses thorns speak of defenses brother brandon i'm going to need a a plug-in here my my ipad is going out thorns speak of defenses thorns poke other people thorns say back off isn't that what ellie says sometimes back off get back thorns are defenses that we have the prophet spoke of the desert and everything in the desert becomes thorny and sticky in the desert brother ryan you lived out in arizona everything becomes thorns and sticky and brother might say because it's a lack of water there's a lack of moisture so that's the problem with that but thorns when they come up and it's more thorns than it is fruits more thorns then it speaks of our defenses and that we poke other people and that we don't have fruit coming of our life but we have more more defense systems and mechanisms set up in our life and then when it moves to the word uh nettles it talks of thorns and it speaks of nettles or nettle or nettles when it speaks of that then we realize you probably didn't know what nettles was if you did you're really good but i didn't know that so if you're asking i'm going to tell you tonight it is an herbal plant back in that day it still is today and they actually use some of it for medicinal purposes or whatever but the problem with the nettles plant is that it's got some fine hairs on the leaves and and the stems that if they're touched to the skin they get irritating to the skin that's not meant to be that's not meant to be you're coming in the garden to grab some grapes and you get over it because it's overgrown you get thorns in you and also you get this uh this nettles plant that is if you touch it to your skin it's kind of like poison ivy it becomes irritating to the skin and another meaning to nettles that is that is actually not related to the plant means to irritate or to annoy i was nettled by bertha's tone with me today bertha why do you use bertha because then i'm safe not using everybody's name here there's not too many birthers in the world i was neddled by bertha's tone today he was irritated you were annoyed because because because bertha was being annoying to you i know nobody in your life is annoying to you here tonight but just for the sake of talking about it i was nettled by bertha's tone so it's to irritate to annoy when you're in a place in your life and you've got thorns and nettles and crabgrass and you're crabby you're irritating everybody you're annoying everybody and and so crab grass is actually simmer to similar to that nettles and that's why i use the text because a cr crab crabgrass is a creeping grass i don't even like the name already the meaning a creeping a creeping grass if you're real grass you don't need to creep it's just something devilish about that whole thing creep you have to creep you just grow up as healthy grass but when you're creeping there's already something wrong with you you gotta go it's a creeping grass that can become a serious weed creeps up and i'm right in season here because it's creeping up in your yard as we speak it's going on i got this beautiful yard i've actually conditioned it and fertilized it my goal like i said is have my yard like john garrett someday when i grow up and i put it i do it and with all of that then all of a sudden these little odd strains grass with with legs that are growing out guy says crabgrass is appropriately named as it often grows low to the ground spreading outwards you're supposed to go upward and you're spreading outwards resembling a crab and that's where crabgrass and the legs just to kind of grow out from it and like this nettles it just keeps growing and growing and takes over and it sucks the life from the good things and so uh i don't i won't go on but i'll just say it's got to be pulled up from the roots can you say man it's got to be pulled up from the roots there's no other way to deal with it and if we don't deal with i'm going to be direct if we don't deal with our defenses our thorns our anger our resentment our crabbiness our victim mentality our negativity our complaining our crabbiness if we don't deal with it it will just keep growing in our life and i know this is a simple message to you tonight but it's where the rubber meets the road if you ignore the crab grass in your life it'll take over the good that's in you it'll smother out living in the spirit of god we can't be lazy can you say a man about something in our life that's irritating others and irritating us it should be irritating you and we can't be lazy about that it's going to keep growing and it's time to get it out and to root it out and to say well some people say well that wasn't that wasn't really me i've had a bad week that really wasn't me well if it wasn't really you then get it out of you because it's taken over your garden people said well that i acted out of place but that wasn't really me well if it wasn't you then why did you do it if it's not a part of your garden it's not a part of your plan it's not a part of your vineyard it doesn't fit the word don't be criticizing somebody else look at your own garden say do i have some crabgrass here do i have some nettles here do i have some thorns in my life can you say man that i'm ignoring and it's becoming irritating to my wife or to my husband or to my children praise the lord i'll tell you where this little lesson started i won't be long tonight this little lesson started when i seen some crabgrass in our church landscape out here last week and i said i get mad at it and i get upset and i just said it needs attention now uh and i there was more out there growing than what we could actually see from a distance and maybe that's why we didn't recognize it but so in the heat the extreme heat last week i got down on my hands and knees i used to make fun of people old people especially that got down and i'd watch them all day in their front yard in their gardens and in their landscape down in their hands and knees i laughed at them for years because they're they're they're pulling everyone out pulling everyone out for hours in the heat and i laugh because as a young person you say you know there's other things for that you know i was going to title this message tonight the young use a weed whacker the old pull it out from the roots put that one as the title because it's working better i thought about that when i was out there in that heat i said i thought all those years i've been laughing at those people and i'd be getting the weed whacker and thinking that's that's that's solving the problem and you know why we choose it because it's the easy way we choose the wing whacker because it's a quick and now we got batteries i got the battery we whackers you don't have to string the cord all the way out there it's got a good battery you can go for a long time and you weed whack off the top of the weeds but you're not pulling it out by the root now i'm describing many many christians today including in our message ranks that are willing to come into service and the weed rocket whacker knocks the surface things off and you feel good for a while but nobody hardly is willing to stay with it until god you say god i want you to root this out of my life but when you get older you don't think in the terms of young because you realize all the years i'm whacking that off it's not doing any good i'm gonna have to get down as an old person even not even when your back problems everything else i'm gonna have to lay down there like they're doing and i'm gonna have to grab that and pull it out by the roots it's the only way to solve it i know there's fertilizer and there's pesticides and all that and i use them too but i haven't had a lot of success with them and next summer crabgrass is going to come up again but i'm telling you there's a lesson to be learned and that we grow older even in our spiritual walk that we don't want to just take these these brother branham called him in meetings and in conventions and camp meetings he said we get on these these shallow bubble dances instead of settle down in the real reality of god shallow bubble dances where we feel good and shout for a week but we're right back to our same habits right back to the same things in our life and i'm not against shouting i believe in it praise the lord you did it but my question is is the holy spirit dealing deep enough with you that it's rooting things out of your life i've watched many young people go from dancing and shouting right back to their habit of pornography i've watched many adults go right back from these services right back to their anger right back to their they're treating their wife bad treating their husband bad and if anybody's listening i'll tell you that's just using a weed whacker on your problems it's not getting to the root of it can i get an amen here tonight and i'll be the weed whacker i'll do it but i'm not interested in just weed whacking i'm interested in you find the kernel of the problem saying lord deal with me and root this out of my life praise the lord i could not believe sitting out there in the heat for an hour and a half i couldn't believe how hard it was this was a lesson for me and i'm just telling you how hard it was after that gets rooted down to pull it out i hardly had the strength my it took all of my strength to to pull because it got so big and pull it and then some of the roots grew under the edge of the blacktop and they were worse and they must know that if i grow further under the blacktop nobody can get me out the devilish mind of their own just shaking that thing said how far do you go down there am i going to pull up the entire driveway here just down there and rooted in but guess what no matter how hard it is i would never take the weed whacker to that it's not going to solve it i'm going to stay there and keep jerking on that thing until that whole entire route comes out of there is anybody listen to what i'm preaching here tonight i'm gonna stay with if you need the holy ghost you're gonna stay with it until god gives it to you if you need a deeper walk with god you're gonna stay with it you're gonna keep bringing that prayer before god if you've got habits in your life say god i'm going to stay before your throne until you take this habit away from me lord you don't quit can you say man you don't give up when you've got a garden and you want it to flourish you don't give up you keep working at it may god help us to keep working at it i laid out there for an hour and a half and you know just trying my best and pulling so hard on these things and you know what my thought was you want to know what i was thinking out there you know what came to me as i was jerking on these roots i said i'm out here doing this this is my thought but this is what i i'm doing these crabgrass but this is what i do every sunday in the pulpit so i thought that's what i'm doing every sunday in the pulpit for me for my life and for your life i'm pulling crab grass something's not a god i'm encourage you to pull it out don't deal with the surface things don't deal with just weed whacking it can you say amen and we can spray too poison can go to the roots but nothing is better than the old way can you say amen i rejoice when someone is willing to be honest and submit we have many in this congregation and i like the atmosphere maybe it's because it's the way i lean but i light people who will get real honest and real submissive to say i want to get to the bottom of my issues and why i'm acting the way i'm acting sometimes it ends up i need the holy ghost but sometimes it's not that sometimes that you're ignoring something that satan's using you're giving satan to territory and when we cross into this promised land of the life of the holy ghost no territory belongs to satan at all you got to go take it when they stepped over jordan and they had the whole land before them that new generation and god encouraged him and says i will be with you as i was with moses what a charge that should give to your hearts can you say man to tell joshua as i was with moses i will be with you you go and take it every place to foot your ghost every place your foot will get upon is your ground satan can be ran out of there and then later on in joshua's they conquered many of the lands he joshua when he when he was old he said stand up he says listen tell the rest of the tribe to be israel how long will you be slack concerning the promise there's still so much more land to possess you read your bible that's what it says there's still land to possess how many believe there's still land in your life to possess yeah we're still here there's still land to possess so we've got to be up and going we can't lay back we can't give up we can't get lazy now no it's too late to get lazy we got to take this whole promise and territory that satan is squatting on we got to say i'm going after him i'm kicking him out i'm taking the land i'm taking all of me body soul and spirit memory imagination conscience effect is reason see taste fill smell and hear can you say amen belongs to god i'm going to give it back to god i'm going to take my territory away from satan somebody say praise the lord amen i rejoice when someone says i want to get to bother my issues because i want to know the why i know i do it but i want to know the why why do i do it how is satan connivingly getting to me with this not just a weed whack job at church and the same thing comes back again in your life six months later anybody listen to me tonight a weed whack at church in six months it pops up again and here you are got the same thing i told a man one time coming to my church years ago he doesn't attend here now i watched his life for a few months i watched his marriage and i said you know what your problem is you're an angry man you have unresolved anger from somewhere i don't even know where i don't know if the lord would tell me but you're an angry man and he got angry with me he did he got right in the parking lot he got angry from me saying that i'm just i'm just telling what the lord showed me i've been watching your life and you're making your wife the problem and you're making this the problem you're making the kids a problem and your wife ain't keeping their house clean enough and you're doing this and doing that i'm saying you're an angry man and your anger is bringing all this stuff to the surface and you're angry at everybody else but deep rooted there's a there's a churning anger towards something and he got angry with me and he he never never resolved it never tackled it i really believe there's rooted things sometimes that the holy spirit wants to take can you say amen just before we close let's go over to hebrews chapter 12 because paul brings it up here in the new testament so wonderfully spiritual garden he says here in hebrews chapter 12 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that it says before us looking into jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and escorts us every son whom he receiveth if he endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what sin is he whom shall the father say that jason and not if he's chastening you it shows you're a son but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which have corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather being subjected unto the father of spirit and live for verily for they verily for a few days chasteneth us for their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless catch it here we go now nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby he's talking about your garden bringing forth fruit can you say amen it yieldeth no chastening seems joyous from the present when you're getting rebuked and whipped by the father of spanking from the father i've never seen a kid with a smile on their face taking a whip in i've never seen him do it they're crying they're resisting they're saying no i don't want this spanking and so no he says no chastening for the president seemed to be joyous but grievous nevertheless after what it yieldeth peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereof wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight to pass through your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed here we go now listen here's the garden here's the here's the yielding peaceable fruit by god's correction god rooting things out of our lives notice now he's make straight the path stand up you know in other words he's saying don't be lazy if god's given you correction don't be lazy with it stand up and take your correction then he says verse 14 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no one will see the lord looking diligent lest any man fail of the grace of god so now this subject of follow peace go back to the other one follow peace with all men follow peace with all men that's a daily life that's not just in church that's a daily walk of what people see in your life what you see in your life follow peace with all not crabgrass not crabbiness not uncontrolled anger not ungentleness and treating people wrong fought peace with just your family follow peace with just the selective ones you want to find relationship with and this is a goal in your garden of following peace with all men and holiness without which no man will see the lord the next one says looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god last last any route of bitterness springing up trouble you and not just trouble you thereby many be defiled that's my sermon to you leave it up there you fail of the grace of god you fail to have grace for others you fail to follow peace with all men you fail to receive the god's chastening if you get that long enough a root of bitterness will spring up in your life and trouble you and defile many why because crabgrass spreads spreads to others and someone can't walk in your garden in your vineyard because they're going to get thorns they're going to get defenses they're going to get poison ivy they're going to get nettles they're going to be irritated in their skin all this is happening because it's defiling others it's not just troubling you it's defiling others and if it doesn't trouble you there's something wrong when i get out of sorts it troubles me when something's springing up that's not of god i'm troubled and it should trouble us i'm not talking about everybody else's life and talk about our own life god where did that come from that was not of you that reaction was not polite that wasn't gentle please forgive me help me lord root that out of me what's making me angry i've often said before i learned as a young man to at least get the bottom of what's making me upset a lot of times it's the current person that's in front of you that you think you're upset at but it's something that happened that morning it's something somebody said it's something somebody said four days ago and because words have power over us they said it it was a negative thought they put you down whatever and that thing has stayed with you it's like i was preaching last week about lies lies have a power with them to bind you somebody speaks a lie over your life there's a delusion there's a cloud that comes over you if you believe it and you start you start mulling over that why did they say that and so what i learned early on in my life is to sit down start praying say now wait a minute first of all is what they said is it the truth so i'm exposing satan that's right if that worker if that co-worker said that is it the truth because if it's the truth and you're doing it then you've got to own up but a lot of times it's not you it's a lie that's told on you you're suffering from it so you sit there and say lord this is not true that's between them and god i forgive them i'm going on with you and if i did anything out of place i ask for your blood to cleanse me and forgive me and that's how you go on and so the crab grass has to be dealt with quickly because this brood of bitterness will continually affect others and will trouble you if you're not troubled by it then it's not a good thing i'm going to close now one more quote did i finish with hebrews wait a minute let me make sure i finish okay so lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you and thereby many be defiled yes i was done right there so i'm going to read a quote to you it's an interesting quote because the prophet said probably about 12 to 15 times he said he referred to as the root word for cancer being crab and he'll refer to it here many times he does he refers to the cancer so we're we're aware of what cancer does it spreads like like a crab's legs or also like crab grass it spreads and goes this way and begins to go into your body and begins to grow today we have so many things we're trying to conquer it trying to do it through medicine but i know a god that has completely dissolved cancer completely killed it but i want you to notice what brother bram says here in this quote did you guys get it a lady sat right here in somewhere that was called and it was a sister by the name of bruce and i don't see her this morning but she was she's a very much of a woman to pray and this woman come in and it was last time i was here and there was no prayer cards give or nothing so there wouldn't be nobody no prayer lines so they just holy spirit just called her over the audience and this little miss bruce she she was healed once herself with cancer and she just always got a burden on her heart for somebody else who has cancer and she was just praying and there was a lady from louisville that was dying cancer in her throat and while she was praying the holy spirit goes right to that woman calls her and whatever it did tell her who she was tell her rather who she was and what her trouble was and about her having cancer and she said it would she said said she it said she would be all right and the little lady went home a couple days after that she just started choking to death nearly just her throat swelled up way up she gave a big cough and the cancer jumped right out and she's perfect you see what happened you see the lump itself is a malignancy that's got a life in it see cancer that comes from the that comes from the word the medical term crab which means it's got a lot of legs just stop right there so he's describing the cancer at a deeper level than just what we call it and the doctors call it right he's saying what it really is i remember the prophet talking about seeing things other in the other dimension and what demons look like they look different than what it is in the physical body demons and something physically in somebody but he would describe different things and uh you know he would describe like the depression demon is like a he used the term a cloud over a person i see a cloud over you and that's what it looked like in the other dimension but then that person's suffering with depression and i remember i was in a motel one day and i seen those commercials on depression medicine and they had a person walking around the yard trying to enjoy their children and they got a cloud just following them and they couldn't get away from the cloud and they're selling depression medicine which is fine but i thought wow that's the way brother branham described what it looks like in the other dimension and here now you know 70 years later they tap into it and that's the image they use for depression and then you know uh nelly sanders and how that big demon come out of there that was from when she danced on the dance floor it was a pretty ugly looking thing that come out of her in that in that demonic form they tell me one place the prophet says if you've seen the demon behind that woman that's dressed immodestly you would never look at her again i haven't found that one but there was some reference to it that if you could see if boys could see the demon behind her you'd never look at it again because a whole different picture in the other dimension it's demons cancer is a demon there's a life of that cancer somewhere but i want you to notice what he says what happened you see the lump itself as a malignancy and the medical turn of crab which means it's got a lot of legs and he says this like the crab you get from the seed and it sucks your blood from you and this malignant growth in your throat had it was what that's what it was doing see now i'm dealing this is the statement i want you to catch look at this look at this i'm not dealing with the growth i'm dealing with the life that's in the growth that's our holy spirit and he's still here tonight can you say amen he's not dealing with the growth he's not dealing with the actual visible crab grass or weed can you say man he's going to the root of the problem and the holy spirit did that through his ministry for countless years while god did that through the discernment i can tell you there's a nature of the holy spirit that we learn he never deals with you in a surface manner he's wanting to get to the source of the problem he did it through brother branham he does it today because he said the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you stick around here and the holy spirit's here sometimes it may get a little uncomfortable not because i want to make it that way because we're not interested in just being patted on the back all the time we're saying lord is there something in me that's deeper that needs to be rooted out and that other person may never change themselves that other person may never ask forgiveness that other person may never do what he needs to do but i can go on victory as the holy spirit roots out the things out of my life can you say praise the lord tonight amen can you say praise the lord i love that and this is in 1963 all the way through all that ministry but he's letting it know i'm not dealing with the growth i'm dealing with a life that's in that growth see the life that's in the growth is what we're dealing with see in my name they shall cast out devils the word devil is tormentor like the body and this was the devil through his name we deal with the life of the problem the source of the problem can you say amen and in my name we shall cast out the devil that's the source of it go to the source of it go to the life of it that's why demons would tremble because there's a there's a life there attacking that life of the enemy and the holy spirit would just begin to draw things out not only problems with physical but you know problems emotionally problems mentally problems with nervousness everything but it wasn't just it wasn't the nervousness is what started it what caused it boy the moment the devil starts to see he's gonna get exposed he just starts to run i'm comfortable with that atmosphere because i want my garden to flourish in the lord i want to be a well-watered i want to stay in church so i can say keep the moisture can you say amen i want to stay in my bible because i can start you feed me the right nutrients can you say man you people have those gardens and you're you're a lot better than i am at it i know that but you know and you've got to put certain nutrients in it and you do this and even manure manure my mom's always telling me as a kid to get the manure because that's the best fertilizer i'm going i don't want to get that manure all this knowledge of this fertilizer just do it this way this is what i do as christians that's why we read our bible god i need some nutrients today because i i got a garden here i want to dress it i want to i want to pull the crab grass out speak to me something lord and i want to come to church and raise my hand and get under the moisture of the holy spirit so i can be watered so i don't become dry can you say amen you have a garden in your life sons and daughters of god that was adam and eve's commission to dress and guard it you have a garden in your life and it can be grown over with the wrong things but i'm here to tell you it can flourish as the holy spirit says what the prophet says i'm not here to deal with the visible part i'm here for in his name to cast out whatever is called and to root it up from the root take it from the very root and pull it up you know what guess what i couldn't get it out the other day i couldn't get it out and this it's the grace of god because when we can't discover what it is and we can't pull it out he says step aside if you let me i'll pull the root out for you good thing we don't have to do this gardening on our own but his holy spirit would just navigate our lives say there it is there would you like me to take that from your life how willing are you for me to take that jealousy and that crabbiness how willing are you and when willing says step aside i'll pull it out of you amen we can be close to the lord and that we can be a garden well watered amen let's stand and pray tonight precious jesus i've delivered my heart tonight lord in this simple message but i pray that it would have fruit come forth from my life and from the precious lives of these people they are your sons and daughters you loved them from the beginning lord and you loved them at calvary you loved them when you sent a prophet in the last days you showed your love again by making contact with us and speaking to us for this generation in this time even sometimes the devil tries to tell us well we don't have anything to go on for that this is a new problem in our society lord you have timeless truths and they address every problem with every society your holy ghost is the answer lord it is the answer i pray father that there will be some light come upon the people's lives tonight and they can look at themselves lord and as solomon walked by this person's yard and seen this great lesson and instruction he got from it may as we drop by your house tonight that we received instruction that we looked at things in a different way and seen lord that you said in john 15 you said that if you abide in me and i abide in you then you'll have fruit from your life you have fellowship and whatever you ask that that well i do this this part of being connected with you and being a healthy lord plant growing showing fruits bringing forth much more fruit the lord when we do that we can be a blessing to others lord but we must keep our gardens free of of animals getting in we must keep it free of bitterness we must keep it free of the crab grass and lord i see in this season of this heat it's amazing to me lord that that these type of weeds can thrive in the heat like this they don't need much moisture regular grass it needs moisture because they're a regular healthy plant that way but all these can thrive in just the heat with no moisture nothing it just begins to grow it's amazing to me lord that we don't have to necessarily be taught in crabbiness or bitterness and these things they just grab a hold of our lives and start to take a hold of us and lord we see this this summer in the natural and then we see it in the spiritual as well forgive us father wash us by your word lord may we find that close walk with you i pray through the holy ghost that we could be filled with your spirit and our minds to give our minds that is the womb to the soul the place where the seed is planted may we give our minds completely to you and yield to you father in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen amen thank mind
