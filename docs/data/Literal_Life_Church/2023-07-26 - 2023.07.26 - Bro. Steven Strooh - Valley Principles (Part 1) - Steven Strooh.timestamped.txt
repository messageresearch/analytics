[0:00] says thank you musicians
[0:01] appreciate that very much
[0:05] and let me see if we have
[0:09] a live feed
[0:13] sister Genie's on it let's read the
[0:16] scripture together
[0:18] um oh I'll need my glasses for this
[0:22] that's why I use a computer I can make
[0:24] the font any size
[0:26] they should make baubles that you can
[0:28] just expand the text
[0:31] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 now Faith is
[0:34] the substance of things hoped for the
[0:36] evidence of Things Not Seen
[0:39] for by it the elders obtained a good
[0:42] report through faith we understand that
[0:45] the worlds were framed by the word of
[0:48] God so that things which are seen were
[0:52] not made of things which do appear
[0:55] I lost the law to Eddie's blessing to
[0:58] the word let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:00] Father we commit this time to you Lord
[1:02] we thank you for all the prayers that
[1:04] have gone forth Lord we thank you for
[1:06] the the saints that have gathered both
[1:09] here and online Lord we just know that
[1:12] uh there's a hunger and a thirst Lord
[1:14] for you and because of that because we
[1:17] hunger and thirst we know that there is
[1:20] a righteousness to fill us there is a
[1:23] God who wants to provide for those needs
[1:26] that we have and so Lord we we commit
[1:29] this time to you we pray Lord that you
[1:31] would bless everything that is said and
[1:33] done Lord we ask it all in Jesus name
[1:36] amen you may be seated
[1:40] oh what happened
[1:46] oh
[1:50] let's get it up here
[1:55] how's that was it
[2:03] let's just do it up here
[2:05] um just
[2:07] um it's the it's this one
[2:10] and then choose
[2:13] whichever nope it's the screamer that's
[2:17] it and use a separate display that's
[2:19] perfect
[2:20] um black magic nope
[2:26] oh me uh unplug this and plug it in
[2:29] again
[2:33] usually it just works
[2:37] yeah I've heard
[2:40] folks if you don't mind well uh
[2:43] our expert is doing the expert thing I
[2:46] will just continue
[2:49] um when we get the slides up I would
[2:51] like to read this from the from the
[2:54] Amplified these first three verses and
[2:57] you'll think you'll find that there's
[2:59] some really significant
[3:02] um
[3:02] uh in edit added Insight
[3:07] um from uh from the Amplified I'm not a
[3:10] big fan of new translations I'll be
[3:12] honest
[3:13] um they uh they're a bit hit and miss
[3:17] which isn't something you really want
[3:18] with the word of God
[3:21] you would rather have something that was
[3:23] reliable that you could put your your
[3:25] faith and trust in
[3:26] but what I wanted to say briefly before
[3:29] we get started on this is that
[3:32] faith is a substance
[3:36] and I think a lot of times we think of
[3:41] Faith as something that's nebulous what
[3:45] I mean by that is something that's not
[3:47] tangible something that's not Material
[3:50] it's not perhaps a real
[3:53] but you know the reality of Our Lives is
[3:57] that we're living at the very lowest
[4:00] level of spirituality down here in three
[4:04] dimensions or four dimensions the real
[4:07] uh the real world if I can put it that
[4:11] way is in higher dimensions and so we
[4:15] are are not
[4:17] um looking for something that we can see
[4:20] in this world but there is something we
[4:23] can see in another dimension there's a
[4:26] dimension to Faith that we sometimes
[4:29] miss a little bit and a lot of it is
[4:32] very practical very down to earth and
[4:34] one of the things that I have
[4:38] missed a little bit
[4:40] when well when I say I missed I've been
[4:43] disappointed when I've talked to
[4:46] somebody and they say well
[4:49] um you know I don't need
[4:51] to see or know anything
[4:56] um
[4:57] I just need to believe
[4:59] but you see that's uh that's a little
[5:02] bit of a cop-out I think is to say that
[5:04] faith is something that isn't real
[5:07] it faith is real and and faith is a very
[5:11] very real substance and that's what
[5:14] Paul's saying it's it may not be the
[5:16] substance that we think of it may not be
[5:18] the you know the physical tangible world
[5:20] that we see feel and touch but
[5:23] um I think uh and there's some other
[5:26] um senses in there but that's not what
[5:30] we're talking about here we're talking
[5:32] about uh Faith being the substance of
[5:36] things hoped for the the reality of
[5:39] things that we're expecting so hoping is
[5:43] in the next Dimension let me let me uh
[5:45] spend a few minutes on that while we're
[5:47] working on this you remember there's
[5:49] three things that we know love is the
[5:53] most important but there's Faith and
[5:55] Hope and you know the three Epistles in
[5:59] the New Testament Peter James and John
[6:00] Peter was Faith uh you remember that uh
[6:04] he he uh he was uh and let's see uh if I
[6:09] can remember sir Peter Faith James was
[6:13] um
[6:16] yes Hope and John was was love so you've
[6:20] got those three uh things that we hold
[6:23] to very very precious in our Christian
[6:25] walk faith hope and love and then of
[6:28] course we know the greatest of these is
[6:29] love but that doesn't diminish the other
[6:32] tube in any way shape or form and so
[6:35] faith is one of those fundamental
[6:39] substances and hope if I can admit that
[6:43] means help help let me give give you
[6:45] this picture
[6:46] faith is what we get from the word of
[6:49] God what we get from our experience what
[6:51] we get from other people's experience
[6:54] especially those in the scripture we we
[6:57] look to that for Faith so when brother
[6:59] branham's preaching Faith he's he's
[7:01] turning to examples and saying you know
[7:04] I did this and this happened and God did
[7:06] this and this is where he prayed and God
[7:07] healed this person and and so that
[7:10] builds up Faith because that's based on
[7:12] things that have happened
[7:15] that's important to realize that when it
[7:17] says substance these aren't things that
[7:19] we're making up this isn't make believe
[7:21] this isn't something that is somewhere
[7:23] out there this is stuff that's really
[7:25] happened it's substance and maybe the
[7:28] English word is stuff this is real stuff
[7:32] but it's in a little bit of a different
[7:34] dimension so that's faith
[7:37] now hope is something way off in the
[7:40] future
[7:41] right the the hope of his coming that we
[7:44] we think of Hope as being future tense
[7:46] all right and nothing wrong with that
[7:48] that's absolutely right that's why the
[7:50] scripture has it so what holds those two
[7:53] things together what holds our faith in
[7:55] the past together with our hope in the
[7:57] future it's love
[7:59] so when Jesus said it's the way the
[8:02] truth and the life
[8:04] all right so Jesus is saying the way
[8:08] you live your life the truth with which
[8:11] you live your life right that's all held
[8:14] together by love that's the the life
[8:17] that we live so it doesn't help to have
[8:19] the truth and doesn't help to know the
[8:23] way if you don't have the Life of Christ
[8:25] see it's the way the truth and the life
[8:29] so these things work together in this
[8:31] way and and that's what um kind of sets
[8:34] the the background for my uh topic that
[8:38] we may get to tonight
[8:41] um the the slides are quite important
[8:42] unfortunately for me but um how about if
[8:46] you just take a thumb drive and plug it
[8:48] in and we could always do that
[8:54] yeah
[8:56] okay all right
[8:59] are you guys patient
[9:03] I wanted somebody to say no
[9:08] [Music]
[9:10] all right and I don't even know where
[9:12] I'm going
[9:13] um yeah I know it's here but I don't
[9:17] know which one oh there we go literal
[9:19] life that makes sense all right there it
[9:22] is right there
[9:25] um it is but it's no Wireless
[9:28] so oh oh good fix it Mr Fix It
[9:34] um folk does that does that make sense
[9:37] we're tracking along here so in verse 3
[9:40] when he says through faith now if it
[9:43] wasn't something real
[9:45] how could it be the the path or the or
[9:49] the the the way it's the it he says um
[9:52] through faith we understand that the
[9:55] worlds were formed by the word of God so
[9:58] that things which are seen were made not
[10:01] made by things which do appear so he's
[10:04] saying there are things which are seen
[10:07] all right but seeing how about things
[10:10] that do not appear that's interesting so
[10:12] this is uh definitely that concept of a
[10:15] another dimension uh and um I just
[10:18] wanted to mention this while I'm on the
[10:20] subject of other dimensions uh you know
[10:23] when we talk about coming up higher and
[10:25] and um Faith obviously is something that
[10:28] grows it's a process remember that
[10:30] scripture from Faith to Faith and so we
[10:33] have faith and to every man has given
[10:36] the measure of Faith but then it's a
[10:37] process whereby that faith gets built
[10:40] like a muscle the more we use it the
[10:41] better it gets and and the stronger it
[10:44] gets but when we say higher and we think
[10:47] back to First John I mean John uh John
[10:50] talking in Revelation chapter four verse
[10:52] one it says he heard the voice saying
[10:53] come up here that come up higher you
[10:55] know we uh live in three dimensions and
[10:59] so we think higher is that way
[11:03] you know so if brother Gideon started um
[11:06] levitating right and and he went higher
[11:09] and higher we'd say wow that's really
[11:11] spiritual but maybe it isn't yes
[11:16] but okay sure so
[11:19] um what higher means in scripture is a
[11:22] higher dimension
[11:23] and brother Brenham says that's a faster
[11:25] Dimension it's something that you know
[11:28] we can't see with our natural eye but of
[11:30] course he had many examples and many
[11:32] people have had examples of seeing
[11:34] visions dream things that are happening
[11:35] in another dimension and and I think
[11:38] it's important that we think of faith is
[11:42] the substance of things from Another
[11:45] Dimension from a higher Dimension
[11:47] because we're called to go up higher
[11:50] we're called to be in Heavenly places
[11:52] with Christ Jesus we're called to be
[11:55] come up higher there's an open door
[11:57] there's further Revelation that God
[12:00] wants for us to have and that's exactly
[12:03] what um what higher means in the
[12:06] Scripture it does not mean that we we
[12:09] get up on a platform or we get up on a
[12:11] chair or whatever
[12:13] um brother
[12:14] um Wesley did that one day when we're
[12:16] singing a song he got up on his chair
[12:18] because he wanted to get up higher I
[12:21] think so no so when we talk about faith
[12:24] we're talking about something that comes
[12:26] from another dimension that's actually
[12:29] it comes from another dimension it's
[12:32] revealed in another dimension and our
[12:36] job is to
[12:38] enter into that dimension and how can we
[12:42] do this let you this mind be in you that
[12:44] was also in Christ Jesus that faith
[12:46] comes by hearing hearing by the word of
[12:48] God so the words that I speak to you
[12:50] Jesus said they are spurred in their
[12:52] life so you can see that whenever this
[12:55] topic of faith comes along and when
[12:57] we're trying to build ourselves
[12:59] spiritually we're talking about working
[13:02] at a higher level at a higher plane and
[13:05] that's why the pull of the world is so
[13:08] detrimental to us because it keeps us
[13:10] down
[13:12] literally and figuratively so I want you
[13:16] to think of the catching away of the
[13:18] church for a minute so the catching away
[13:20] of the church that's not
[13:23] flying up into the sky although that's
[13:26] the picture that God used When Jesus
[13:28] ascended into heaven he was caught up in
[13:31] the clouds the clouds not white fluffy
[13:33] clouds the clouds of witnesses all right
[13:36] that they without us should not be made
[13:37] perfect so he was caught up so that was
[13:40] what they saw
[13:42] but what was really happening is Jesus
[13:44] was entering into that other dimension
[13:46] and they were seeing that in a very
[13:50] similar way that you remember Elisha's
[13:52] servant remember when he said there's
[13:54] more for us then before then then be for
[13:56] them and he said open his eyes Lord and
[14:00] you know whenever I sing that song I
[14:02] always think of open my eyes Lord
[14:06] and that doesn't mean so that I can see
[14:09] brother Dana better all right
[14:12] you understand why I wouldn't want to
[14:15] see Brothers
[14:18] I apologize brother then he got broad
[14:20] shoulders so no it's not that it's that
[14:24] I want to see the way Jesus sees I want
[14:28] to open my eyes opened the way he did
[14:31] when he opened that one Blind Man's eyes
[14:34] do you recall that it's a really
[14:36] interesting story where he prayed for
[14:38] him and he said I see men walking like
[14:40] trees now we know from Psalms that trees
[14:44] can represent uh people you know men
[14:47] that we would be like trees planted by
[14:50] rivers of Living Water so trees can
[14:53] represent the spiritual side of a person
[14:57] because remember the the
[15:00] organisms that live the longest on Earth
[15:02] are trees all right those are those huge
[15:06] uh cedar trees and and redwoods and so
[15:09] forth that live for you know thousand
[15:10] years and so forth these are things that
[15:13] represent what we should be doing we
[15:16] should be living for that period of time
[15:19] so when he said I see men walking like
[15:21] trees I think I'm not saying this is
[15:23] exactly right but it's what I think
[15:25] about it is that it's like his eyes were
[15:28] open to the spiritual realm that he saw
[15:31] he saw like you know brother Brennan
[15:33] would describe it as misty out there or
[15:36] he would see I see you over there and
[15:39] doing this and he's not seeing that
[15:41] individual but he's seeing in a
[15:42] spiritual realm and so it seems that's
[15:45] what uh that that man saw he saw in the
[15:48] spiritual realm and Jesus said okay we
[15:50] need to bring your vision down a level
[15:52] or two and uh and now you know he his
[15:55] assat was restored as it would normally
[15:59] um I just want to check with our folk up
[16:02] uh up in the balcony
[16:04] um if I move here does that move it over
[16:07] here or do you have to follow
[16:10] oh wonderful
[16:12] praise God brother Ike and his amazing
[16:16] team
[16:17] so folk um we're gonna get started now
[16:21] 7 43 attempt to start slowing down but
[16:25] um we'll see how far we get uh brother
[16:27] Paul did mention
[16:29] um
[16:29] uh Sunday so we'll see how far we get I
[16:32] won't keep you too long I know it's
[16:34] Wednesday night
[16:36] thank you brother
[16:38] um blame brother Carl
[16:41] so
[16:44] we we're talking about
[16:46] um Valley principles
[16:48] um uh for the service and next service
[16:50] we're talking about principles for for
[16:52] living life in the valley and this
[16:55] particular
[16:57] version or the edition if you like is
[17:01] faithful life in the valley so we're
[17:03] going to spend quite a bit of time on
[17:05] this not talking about faith exactly but
[17:07] talking about What Faith Can Do for us
[17:11] so the question is what is Faith so Paul
[17:14] answers this I'm going to read this in
[17:16] the Amplified now Faith is the Assurance
[17:19] So when you say substance you know we we
[17:23] uh we get a bit stumbled because we
[17:25] think well it's not physical it's not
[17:26] reality but really what that word is is
[17:29] an assurance or a confirmation that we
[17:33] have something a title deed we have we
[17:36] own something something's in our name
[17:38] and we have faith
[17:41] and God has given us that faith and so
[17:44] our our experience with God is based on
[17:49] this Faith oh and it's of the things we
[17:51] hope for so we can't hope for something
[17:54] that doesn't exist
[17:57] does that make sense
[17:58] you know if there's something that
[18:00] doesn't exist
[18:01] um go ahead help me to try and hope for
[18:04] that
[18:05] it would be impossible right because we
[18:08] have nothing in our minds that can do
[18:10] that
[18:11] so we can't hope for something that
[18:13] doesn't exist it has to exist somewhere
[18:17] and then it's being the proof of things
[18:20] we do not see
[18:21] so now that's really interesting so
[18:23] there is evidence of things that we
[18:26] don't see and yet we have evidence for
[18:30] it I think this is I hope we are not
[18:32] spending too much time on this but I
[18:33] just wanted to kind of nail this down
[18:35] that we're not talking about something
[18:38] that isn't real faith is very real and
[18:43] then it says that think proof of things
[18:45] we do not see and the conviction of
[18:48] their reality
[18:50] so it is real it's more real brother
[18:53] Reynolds says than anything that you can
[18:55] see around you that that's the real
[18:58] world that um we're we're living in
[19:01] we're not
[19:03] we're not accustomed to being in touch
[19:06] with that world but every now and then
[19:08] that world will touch us and we we thank
[19:12] God for that whether it's an anointing
[19:14] whether it's a healing whether it's a
[19:15] miracle whether it's just saying the
[19:17] right thing at the right time to the
[19:19] right person all of that is being done
[19:22] because God has dropped his finger down
[19:25] into our world he's brought his world in
[19:30] touchdown in our world so sometimes we
[19:33] can't come up higher but praise God he
[19:35] can come down lower and remember that's
[19:38] what he did he made himself a little
[19:40] lower than the Angels so he came down to
[19:43] our level and that was the song that God
[19:45] brother brother
[19:48] um
[19:49] Josiah up in his chair
[19:53] that we don't want to get down to the
[19:55] devil's level we want to be higher than
[19:57] that but gravity is real
[20:01] now I want to tell you something about
[20:02] gravity so in the same way that gravity
[20:04] is holding me here
[20:06] all right so when I sing I'll Fly Away
[20:09] all right I'm imagining that somehow
[20:12] gravity is going to lose its pull on me
[20:14] but it's not really that
[20:16] it's that gravity is based on mass it's
[20:21] based on having something an object to
[20:24] hold but when I have a new body
[20:27] and I am redeemed that flesh is redeemed
[20:30] and now I have this different state of
[20:33] being now gravity has no hold on me why
[20:37] is that important why was it important
[20:39] that Abraham and Sarah were changed to
[20:40] young people they got new bodies as an
[20:43] illustration that when we get to that
[20:46] level
[20:47] when we're at that point where God has
[20:50] revealed himself to us so much so that
[20:52] we can find that Redemption of the body
[20:55] and gravity no longer has a hold on us
[20:57] guess what also doesn't have a hold on
[21:00] us sin
[21:02] because you remember Sinners that the
[21:04] world right that's where we think of
[21:06] sinners in the world well what has the
[21:08] the world is where gravity is so you see
[21:12] how this is all tied together that we
[21:14] don't want something that we we think is
[21:17] is is not real it has to be real and it
[21:20] has to be as real to us as gravity now
[21:24] it can there's some clever folk here and
[21:26] I don't know if anybody's ever tried to
[21:28] explain what gravity is
[21:31] yeah we we use these words it's very
[21:33] interesting and faith is a little bit
[21:35] like that word gravity we can talk about
[21:38] it we can experience it we can believe
[21:40] it
[21:41] but we have no idea what it is
[21:44] so I was in a in a in a tournament
[21:46] office in South Africa very well-known
[21:49] uh astronomer David block and uh I
[21:52] looked on his bookshelf and he had a
[21:54] book and it was a big black book and it
[21:56] just had one word down the spine gravity
[21:59] it was this thick three inches thick a
[22:02] big eight eight and a half by eleven
[22:04] size book one word down it I said
[22:06] gravity and I said well I said uh
[22:09] Professor I said is that um is that how
[22:12] we understand gravity he goes no he says
[22:15] that's just explaining what gravity does
[22:17] and how it works but we have no idea
[22:20] what it is
[22:21] and that's still true today that was 30
[22:23] years ago it's still true today we don't
[22:25] know what gravity is so when you think
[22:27] of Faith think a little bit of gravity
[22:30] so what's holding us down we don't have
[22:33] any trouble getting up out of our seat
[22:34] you know walking around we don't expect
[22:36] to just go you know and do an Enoch you
[22:40] know and just sort of walk into another
[22:41] dimension we expect to be you know on
[22:44] terra firma and that's uh that's exactly
[22:48] the same approach we should have to
[22:50] Faith it's as real as gravity I trusted
[22:53] I put every day I step on it I walk in
[22:56] that path of gravity every day and and I
[23:00] don't have to make an excuse for it I
[23:02] don't have to say well I don't
[23:03] understand gravity therefore I don't
[23:06] believe in it
[23:07] well if you don't believe in gravity you
[23:10] might fall off a building all right so
[23:12] the conviction of their reality
[23:15] all right is Faith perceiving as real
[23:19] fact what is not revealed to the senses
[23:22] can you see how this is another
[23:23] dimension all right this isn't the topic
[23:26] tonight I just want you to know or maybe
[23:28] it is
[23:30] all right so verse two for by faith that
[23:33] that is trust and holy fervor born of
[23:37] Faith the men of old had Divine
[23:39] testimony born to them and obtained a
[23:42] good report we'll talk a little bit more
[23:44] about the good report and then in verse
[23:46] 5 we didn't read that in the King James
[23:48] because of Faith Enoch was caught up
[23:51] into heaven so that's what made me think
[23:53] of gravity so Enoch's Walking with God
[23:56] he's in that other dimension suddenly
[23:59] gravity
[24:00] has no power over
[24:02] suddenly there's nothing material about
[24:04] him that gravity can hold down and if we
[24:07] have that degree of anointing as we walk
[24:11] and we we start to live by faith and
[24:14] more and more we do it the less the pull
[24:17] of the world can have on us the less
[24:20] effect it can have and the less effect
[24:22] gravity is going to have on us and one
[24:25] day
[24:26] we're gone
[24:28] so he was caught up into heaven so that
[24:30] he did not have a glimpse of death and
[24:33] he was not found because God had
[24:34] translated him
[24:36] for even before he was taken to Heaven
[24:38] he received testimony that he had
[24:41] pleased God
[24:43] so now we're seeing a little bit more
[24:45] about faith so Faith isn't just what can
[24:48] I get from God
[24:50] but it's what can I give to God
[24:53] as I give him my life I give him my all
[24:56] I surrender all as I give to God if as I
[25:00] do the things that that are pleasing to
[25:03] him now we're talking about the kind of
[25:06] faith that Enoch had that he was
[25:09] pleasing to God
[25:11] that his walk and you know we've seen
[25:13] that in brother branham's life right so
[25:15] it's it's that wonderful walk with me a
[25:17] little more you remember that that uh
[25:19] you know that um that uh that time that
[25:22] he had now verse six without faith it is
[25:25] impossible to please him for whoever
[25:28] would come near to God into that other
[25:30] dimension must necessarily oops believe
[25:35] that God exists and that he is the
[25:38] rewarder of those who earnestly and
[25:41] diligently seek Him and now there's
[25:43] another hint in here
[25:49] when we think of the Christian walk
[25:52] um there is a tendency to think
[25:55] that somehow
[25:58] I just have to
[26:00] I hate to say do nothing
[26:03] but that's kind of the way it sounds to
[26:05] me sometimes the way people
[26:07] um talk about it talk about faith is I
[26:09] don't have to do anything
[26:11] God's doing everything so I you know I'm
[26:14] just I'm just along for the ride you
[26:16] know I'm going with the flow and it's
[26:18] absolutely incorrect it's a reward God
[26:22] is a rewarder of those who earnestly and
[26:24] diligently seek him so we do have a part
[26:27] to play in this and what is that part
[26:29] it's the response
[26:32] it's because of what he did for us I
[26:34] just want to clarify this because
[26:36] sometimes this sounds legalistic let me
[26:38] clarify this
[26:39] when you do something because you have
[26:42] to
[26:43] like I need to do these things otherwise
[26:45] I can't get saved all right that's when
[26:48] you have to do something to get saved to
[26:50] get favor with God whatever I've got to
[26:53] do something that's legalism
[26:55] but what's obedience
[26:59] the same Act
[27:01] the same exact thing you ask your child
[27:04] will you do this and
[27:07] grudgingly gets up off the sofa and
[27:10] drags his or her feet down and
[27:14] eventually you know starts to do
[27:18] something like that you ask them to and
[27:20] that's when I use the phrase delayed
[27:23] obedience is disobedience
[27:27] they couldn't get away with that for
[27:28] long so
[27:31] the idea is that when we're asking
[27:35] somebody to do something and God's
[27:36] asking us as Sons and Daughters of God
[27:38] to do something he's expecting us to do
[27:41] it because we love him not because we
[27:45] don't want to get smacked
[27:47] that's the alternative right but it
[27:50] that's not the reason we do things
[27:52] sometimes people talk about getting
[27:54] saved from hell and yes that's a that's
[27:57] a reality yes we we we're born in
[27:59] sin-shaped iniquity we are going to hell
[28:01] unless we find Salvation in Christ but
[28:06] that's not what God's sent his son to
[28:09] Earth for was not to say not to be a
[28:12] fireman not to save us from hell but to
[28:15] bring us into his kingdom to bring us
[28:17] into right standing with him and so
[28:19] faith is actually the means by which we
[28:24] can earnestly and diligently do
[28:27] something that has some significance I
[28:31] want to give you the example of washing
[28:33] clothes so since Kathy's been a little
[28:36] indisposed I have suddenly learned a
[28:39] whole array of new skills
[28:43] um I'm thinking of hiring myself out
[28:46] um
[28:48] but I noticed that if you just take
[28:51] laundry
[28:53] and you rub it very hard together
[28:56] and you look at it it's just as soiled
[28:59] as it was before you started rubbing
[29:02] so works
[29:04] isn't going to clean the laundry
[29:06] you have to put it in a liquid
[29:09] and preferably with a little soap
[29:12] not forgetting sometimes
[29:15] and so when you put that effort into the
[29:19] right environment the clothes come clean
[29:23] so when we take our lives and we dip
[29:26] ourselves in the blood of Jesus and we
[29:28] dip ourselves in the cleansing power of
[29:31] his word and now we rub ourselves now we
[29:36] do something vigorous something that we
[29:39] believe would be pleasing to God now it
[29:42] has an effect on our life so we're we're
[29:45] really off topic but
[29:47] um praise God for that all right so
[29:50] earnestly and diligently so some of this
[29:53] actually comes up later
[29:55] so first of all people of Faith have an
[29:58] optimistic Outlook and and and that's so
[30:01] important because if you're confessing
[30:04] something please make sure that you're
[30:07] not confessing what the devil is saying
[30:10] he doesn't need any help right you know
[30:14] you don't need to to be reminding
[30:16] yourself of what he's telling you that's
[30:19] that's absolutely not necessary he knows
[30:22] what he's saying and all he wants is for
[30:25] you to line up with what he's saying
[30:26] rather than what God's saying so please
[30:29] have an optimistic outlook on life we
[30:32] can be realistic and optimistic I can
[30:34] assure you but it's interesting
[30:38] that people of Faith carry a deep
[30:41] conviction of who God is
[30:44] and who he has declared himself to be
[30:48] deep inside there's something unshakable
[30:51] in a person of faith
[30:53] and there's something else we have an
[30:56] unshakable confidence
[31:00] in the character of God
[31:03] because before we can believe somebody
[31:05] and take them at their word we have to
[31:08] have confidence in their character so if
[31:11] somebody's not trustworthy if somebody
[31:14] said something and not done it if
[31:16] somebody has said things that are just
[31:19] completely untrue whatever the case is
[31:22] we lose trust in what that person says
[31:25] but in God we know the character of God
[31:29] we see it throughout the scripture he is
[31:32] a man of his word
[31:33] and he is the word
[31:36] and he will reveal that character in us
[31:40] so please we also need to be men and
[31:43] women of our word that's something that
[31:46] sometimes has taken a little bit too
[31:48] likely and the other thing about people
[31:51] of faith
[31:52] and I love this
[31:54] they believe what God says regardless of
[31:58] the circumstances they're not looking at
[32:01] the landscape
[32:02] they're looking at the promise
[32:05] they're not looking at the events that
[32:07] are taking place now they're looking at
[32:09] what does God have in store for me
[32:13] and again I can give you another example
[32:15] you remember when the Israelites came to
[32:17] the bitter Waters of Mara
[32:19] and I love this story I tell it every
[32:21] time
[32:23] and they come there now they're
[32:25] complaining everything's terrible you're
[32:26] gonna die out here in the desert Woe Is
[32:30] Us
[32:30] and God tells Moses cut down that tree
[32:32] and throw it into the water and it'll
[32:35] make the water sweet
[32:38] so who knows how long a tree takes to
[32:41] grow in the desert
[32:43] but it had to be many many decades
[32:46] earlier that God had planted a tree
[32:50] that was going to be right in the path
[32:52] of the Israelites when they needed to
[32:57] have a drink of water
[32:58] now we have a tree that is Christ
[33:03] all right he's the Tree of Life
[33:05] and he's been there a long time before
[33:09] our problem
[33:11] and he's already put that solution in
[33:14] place and he's just waiting for the
[33:16] right time to apply that solution into
[33:20] that circumstance in our life that's why
[33:23] we don't look at circumstances because
[33:26] if we're looking at the circumstances
[33:28] and the bitter Waters we're missing what
[33:31] God has planned and how he's going to
[33:34] perform an incredible miracle and he's
[33:37] going to feed millions of people
[33:40] and he had it all planned long before it
[33:44] ever came around so
[33:46] things and this is how this is a valley
[33:49] principle things can look bad at the
[33:51] moment
[33:52] but in the end it comes out well it's
[33:55] because he does all things well
[33:58] so we looked at this that faith is the
[34:00] Assurance the confirmation if you have
[34:03] Assurance if you have this faith if you
[34:05] have the confirmation you have an
[34:07] optimistic Outlook you carry a depth of
[34:10] conviction of who God is and who he says
[34:13] he is and we believe in the character of
[34:16] God we don't look at the circumstances
[34:18] that's what that means the substance of
[34:21] things hoped for it's something real
[34:24] brother and sister now brother Branham
[34:26] says this we're going to quote this a
[34:28] lot uh tonight if Lord willing I see
[34:31] that time has flown
[34:32] people have the wrong idea about trials
[34:34] it's not to bring you down and get you
[34:36] defeated it's designed to reveal to you
[34:40] the capacity for faith that you really
[34:43] have
[34:44] see God doesn't need to know how much
[34:46] faith I have I think he knows
[34:50] but he needs us to know
[34:53] what he's already placed in us what he's
[34:56] growing in us how it's developing in us
[34:59] and I want to tell you it's like a
[35:02] spiritual thermometer
[35:04] so you can apply the thermometer and
[35:07] let's see if the child has a temperature
[35:10] all right and and we need a readout
[35:13] and so trials is the readout that God's
[35:17] using to take the temperature of our
[35:20] faith and it's not for his purpose not
[35:22] for Mom and Dad's purpose in this case
[35:24] it's for the child's purpose so that he
[35:27] or she knows what their temperature is
[35:30] so it's not to bring you down and get
[35:32] you defeated but to reveal to you the
[35:35] capacity for faith that you have right
[35:39] anybody seen this at a at a fair
[35:43] you hit this thing and you try and hit
[35:45] it as hard as you can nobody's seen this
[35:47] I'm the only one Iowa State Fair yeah
[35:50] the the greatest fear
[35:52] um so we brother Branham said you don't
[35:55] know what level of Faith you have until
[35:57] it's tested you may think you have great
[35:59] faith but let it be tested then see how
[36:02] much you really have so this is that
[36:04] that that that that
[36:06] um that ball going up this this thing
[36:08] trying to hit the bell at the top right
[36:10] and that's when we know hmm I need to
[36:15] call upon the Lord because in my
[36:18] weakness he's made strong and so then
[36:22] brother Branham says this
[36:24] he says if it's not really strong then
[36:28] call upon the Lord in the day of trouble
[36:30] and he will deliver you buying I should
[36:32] have put a sound in there and so now the
[36:35] same skinny guy has now been able to
[36:38] whack this hammer down so hard that the
[36:41] thing shoots up and hits the bell and
[36:43] that's what trials are
[36:46] there's nothing evil about a trial I'm
[36:48] going to give you another example of a
[36:49] trial very quickly because we're kind of
[36:51] off the notes anyway
[36:54] if you're leading a troop of students
[36:59] on a mountain climbing Expedition
[37:03] and you're taking them along this path
[37:06] and in the beginning it's just the
[37:07] Foothills things are pretty easy going
[37:09] and then as you get to the steeper
[37:12] rockier more treacherous Parts all right
[37:15] and your coach or your guard
[37:18] is
[37:19] urging you on come on come on you can do
[37:21] it come on and you've got my legs are
[37:23] killing me my back is killing me I can't
[37:25] go on he goes no come on you can do it
[37:27] let's go and he's pushing and pushing
[37:29] you might think at the time that you're
[37:34] being tortured
[37:36] and that this is no fun
[37:38] and that um the Sunnah can turn around
[37:40] and hit back the better and I don't know
[37:43] why I ever signed up for this
[37:46] because this is tough this isn't easy
[37:50] and yet there's a wonderful reward on
[37:52] the end when you get up on that mountain
[37:54] and you look at and it's so beautiful
[37:56] and then you're thanking the coach or
[37:58] your guard and saying oh thank you for
[38:00] pushing me I would not have seen this I
[38:02] would not have I would not have
[38:03] experienced this unless you had pushed
[38:06] me so the way God
[38:09] Works in our lives he doesn't beat us he
[38:13] doesn't give us sickness he doesn't do
[38:15] these things that we sometimes associate
[38:17] with him unfortunately we know that's
[38:19] not true
[38:21] but I want you to know what God can do
[38:24] he can just make the road a little
[38:26] steeper
[38:27] he can take you from the foothills of
[38:29] Trials to the really steep parts of
[38:33] Trials and God has done nothing wrong he
[38:36] hasn't become evil you're not being
[38:39] punished for anything
[38:40] he's just trying to get you to a higher
[38:43] level
[38:45] and mountains are a beautiful example
[38:48] but you remember we started off the
[38:50] higher level is a spiritual level
[38:52] he's trying to teach us what we have
[38:55] within us he wants our faith to grow
[38:58] from Faith to Faith all right so brother
[39:01] Ram says the Christian looks at things
[39:03] they don't see because they walk by
[39:06] faith we believe it because the Bible
[39:08] says so
[39:09] they believe it that's how we believe
[39:11] it's because God said so
[39:14] Faith tested try it it proves out a
[39:18] hundred percent God's under obligation
[39:22] to answer that faith brother and sister
[39:26] I
[39:28] cannot tell you how comforting it is
[39:31] to think that I am entitled
[39:36] not because of anything I've done but
[39:39] because of what he has promised in his
[39:41] word I'm entitled to Every Blessing
[39:45] every promise in the book is mine every
[39:49] chapter every verse every line
[39:52] that is our position that is our heret
[39:56] and heritance and God is a man of his
[39:59] word if we if brother Branham saying
[40:01] he's obligated
[40:03] it seems strange right we think of
[40:06] obligation as as a bad thing but in
[40:09] actual fact when we're talking about God
[40:11] it's really important for us to feel
[40:14] that God is obligated now on Sunday Lord
[40:17] willing
[40:19] I hope you'll all come back
[40:21] um
[40:21] and
[40:23] I'm going to talk about
[40:25] Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat
[40:28] and the prayer that he prayed when
[40:31] everything was against him he was in a
[40:33] valley
[40:34] and we'll read that scripture at the end
[40:37] but I just want you to think about it
[40:39] that he was
[40:42] um he was letting God know that he felt
[40:46] that God was obligated to see them out
[40:50] of this Con this problem that they that
[40:52] they were in
[40:54] and I don't want to take away from uh
[40:56] that because that's it's kind of an
[40:58] exciting story so we'll we'll get to
[40:59] that so faith is built in a relationship
[41:02] we talked about the character of God we
[41:04] talked about having something within us
[41:06] that's faith that has to be built over
[41:09] time through a process and Proverbs 3
[41:12] Verse 6 says in Old our ways acknowledge
[41:14] Him and He Shall direct our paths in
[41:17] other words that faith that we have in
[41:20] him in his character is going to allow
[41:24] us to accept his guidance
[41:27] I hope you hope you can see that in this
[41:29] verse if we acknowledge Him if we
[41:32] recognize him for who he is and what he
[41:34] says he is if we have confidence in him
[41:37] if he's a man of his word if we can
[41:40] trust in the character of God heal
[41:43] direct your paths
[41:46] and of course same thing for as many as
[41:48] a lead of this by the spirit of God they
[41:51] are the sons of God so that concept of
[41:55] being a son or a daughter of God that's
[41:57] a relationship this isn't rules and
[41:59] regulations this is a relationship led
[42:03] by the spirit of God not whipped by the
[42:06] spirit of God when God leads God
[42:09] provides and he's not going to push you
[42:12] down a road and then step back and go
[42:14] hahaha look he fell over
[42:16] not at all that's not the character of
[42:20] God God's character is he will go in
[42:23] front of us he will lead us he'll guide
[42:25] us he'll even carry us but he's going to
[42:28] see us through and that's what we trust
[42:31] him and then it says the steps of a good
[42:33] man are ordered by the Lord and He
[42:36] Delights in his way
[42:38] now I don't know if he is the Lord here
[42:40] that would be the way the language is
[42:42] written that last person spoken of was
[42:44] the Lord so that he Delights it seems to
[42:46] be the Lord it could be either one but
[42:48] in any case that's what a relationship
[42:50] is if the Lord's delighting in us and
[42:53] we're delighting in him now we have the
[42:56] basis of a relationship with God Romans
[42:59] 10 verse 8.
[43:00] the word is neither even in thy mouth
[43:04] and in thy heart and that is the word of
[43:07] faith which we preach Paul said the word
[43:10] of faith which we preach is nigh you
[43:13] even in your mouth and I want to
[43:15] emphasize this I think sister Sharon
[43:17] mentioned this I think Paul said
[43:19] it's our confession
[43:21] it's what we say and I'll tell you
[43:23] what's so important about what you say
[43:26] is when you say something I'm going to
[43:28] take two minutes here hopefully we'll
[43:30] get done with something this evening
[43:32] but I just wanted I want you to
[43:34] understand this concept
[43:37] when you're speaking and saying
[43:40] something
[43:42] you're hearing
[43:43] what you're saying
[43:46] and so your faith comes by hearing and
[43:50] hearing comes by the word of God so if
[43:52] you're saying scripture if you're saying
[43:54] positive things if you're saying how
[43:56] wonderful God is how great God is like
[43:58] Jehoshaphat did if you're doing that
[44:01] you're preaching to yourself and your
[44:04] ears are hearing your confession
[44:07] all right now there's another part to it
[44:09] a little bit of a psychological part
[44:12] if you say something guess what
[44:15] you believe it
[44:18] unless you're doing something really
[44:20] weird or there's two or three of you
[44:23] if you say something you believe it
[44:26] because you can't hold two opposing
[44:29] ideas in your mind at the same time you
[44:32] can't have faith and doubt you can't be
[44:34] sitting and standing at the same time
[44:36] it's impossible so when you're speaking
[44:38] words of Faith words of affirmation
[44:40] words of confidence words of
[44:41] encouragement
[44:43] and those words are coming out of your
[44:45] mouth a you believe it and B you can't
[44:49] have any other thoughts while you're
[44:51] saying that
[44:52] and so that you try it
[44:56] try and say something and think about
[44:58] something else while you're saying it
[44:59] and if you can do that um there's
[45:02] probably some people that you might need
[45:04] to get in touch with
[45:08] so you can't hold two opposing thoughts
[45:10] in your mind at the same time faith and
[45:13] doubt are two sides of the same coin
[45:16] and I'm going to talk about that for a
[45:18] second even though it's not in my notes
[45:21] so
[45:23] what we sometimes don't realize and we
[45:25] will talk about this there's quite a
[45:27] large section in these notes on fear
[45:30] and fear is an interesting thing because
[45:32] fear is faith
[45:35] because you can't have you can't have
[45:38] fear or be scared of something you don't
[45:41] believe
[45:43] so if you stepping into the road and you
[45:46] are scared that that buzz is going to
[45:49] kill you
[45:50] all right it's because you know that if
[45:53] you stand there that bus will kill you
[45:55] all right and so you have a healthy fear
[45:59] we teach our kids don't touch the stove
[46:00] don't do that healthy fear all right and
[46:04] so that's a a a example to us of what
[46:08] faith is now of course the devil can
[46:11] take hold of that fear and use it to his
[46:14] own Advantage because he knows that fear
[46:18] is as powerful as faith and the thing
[46:21] which greatly feared Came Upon him the
[46:25] scripture says about job fear is a
[46:28] powerful force don't let it take hold of
[46:31] your life
[46:33] perfect love casts out fear we do not
[46:36] need to fear any of these things because
[46:40] greater is he that is in us than he that
[46:43] is in the world no weapon formed against
[46:45] me can prosper
[46:47] and we repeat these words we we
[46:50] pronounce these words over our
[46:53] circumstances and and we say that God
[46:56] can deliver and God can heal and God can
[47:00] take away the things that we don't like
[47:03] in our lives because we trust him and we
[47:06] don't have to fear those things the
[47:08] devil wants us to fear it he wants us to
[47:11] fear that when we do something wrong oh
[47:14] my goodness what's going to happen and
[47:16] so forth but the Bible says he's
[47:18] faithful and just to forgive forgive us
[47:20] if we go and confess our sin so what's
[47:23] there to fear absolutely nothing
[47:26] the Romans 1 17 for therein is the
[47:29] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[47:31] to Faith as it is written the just shall
[47:33] live by faith so we always think of that
[47:35] last part because that's what caught
[47:37] Luther's attention but I love that from
[47:40] Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith it's a
[47:44] stepping stone all the way through our
[47:47] lives and what is God doing to take us
[47:49] up a little bit higher with each step
[47:53] a little bit of trial a little bit of
[47:55] struggle a little bit of opposing
[47:57] gravity and going up another step going
[48:00] up another step and even another step
[48:02] and as we're doing that we're building
[48:04] muscle we're building stamina we're
[48:07] building resolve we have resilience
[48:11] because we've gone through those
[48:13] processes and that's how God builds
[48:16] Faith it's he's not just spooning it out
[48:20] as if it was um ice cream
[48:23] he's saying this is something that you
[48:27] develop I've given it to you but now and
[48:30] so what does this mean what does it mean
[48:31] to develop it it means that our lives
[48:34] our human lives our born in sin shaped
[48:36] and iniquity lives are opposed to the
[48:39] things of God so when he is making the
[48:43] road steeper when he's adding a valley
[48:45] experience what he's doing is knocking
[48:48] away some of those restrictions to the
[48:51] word of God that is our natural human uh
[48:55] thoughts a human ideas things that
[48:59] um we will take the easy Road
[49:02] that's the normal course of events
[49:04] that's who we are we're like electricity
[49:06] we'll take the shortest route all right
[49:09] that's who we are but God wants to knock
[49:12] that out of us because he's working us
[49:14] up to a time when there'll be a change
[49:17] in the body
[49:19] and you can see that that's not an
[49:21] overnight thing that's not an
[49:22] instantaneous ending one day it'll be
[49:24] instantaneous to be absent with the Lord
[49:26] is absent from the what he's present
[49:28] with the law eventually in the twinkling
[49:30] of an eye that as we are in this world
[49:33] living in this world we're being led up
[49:36] into Glory from glory to glory from
[49:40] Faith to Faith all right amen so much
[49:44] time
[49:46] so we take people at the word based on
[49:48] what we know about their character so
[49:49] it's in life's valleys that we become
[49:52] most dependent
[49:54] by revelation
[49:57] of the character of God it's a
[50:00] revelation
[50:01] this isn't something you can gen up
[50:03] you can't say oh I'm gonna really
[50:05] struggle and I love the way brother
[50:07] Brenham talked about the Sheep
[50:09] pushing out another
[50:12] bit of wool yeah she remember he said
[50:16] they just grazed and the wool Grows by
[50:18] itself and we graze on the word of God
[50:20] and the wool Grows by itself the faith
[50:23] Grows by itself but we have to be part
[50:27] of that process that was the way God
[50:29] intended it and so faith is something
[50:32] that's cultivated and we'll talk about
[50:34] this another time with the four seeds
[50:36] but faith is something that's cultivated
[50:39] and it it's something that we have to uh
[50:45] we have to tend the garden
[50:47] of Our Lives to allow the faith seeds to
[50:52] grow
[50:53] if we allow the weeds in remember the
[50:55] four the parable of the four four four
[50:59] um
[51:00] four different types of Earth
[51:02] that's
[51:04] that's not a comment on the seed it
[51:08] isn't even a commentary on the sower and
[51:11] by the way if you're a farmer and you
[51:13] watch this guy sowing
[51:15] he'd be fired
[51:17] because that seed that very precious
[51:20] seed is actually food he's taking that
[51:23] food out of the children's mouth
[51:25] and throwing it into the ground and the
[51:29] children are like what is he doing
[51:31] but unless the seed falls into the
[51:33] ground and die it's going to abide alone
[51:36] but if it die it'll bring forth much
[51:39] fruit so the lesson is taught to the
[51:41] children but now this guy's sowing and
[51:45] man he's all over the sidewalk he's all
[51:47] amongst the Thorns he's in the shallow
[51:50] soil and hey Presto 25 of it actually
[51:52] lands in good soil
[51:55] but guess what Jesus never criticized
[51:58] the sower
[51:59] and that gives me so much confidence
[52:04] I'm sowing this evening how might not be
[52:07] doing very well but I'm the sower and
[52:09] God never criticized the soul
[52:12] he only criticized the soil
[52:16] interesting so what we're doing is we're
[52:19] cultivating Faith we're tending the
[52:21] garden
[52:22] of our soul remember the soul is like a
[52:25] watered Garden
[52:26] and so we have to tend that now if we're
[52:30] going to grow some fruit in our lives
[52:33] guess where we have to grow it
[52:35] we have to grow it in the valley
[52:37] and here's what brother Branham said
[52:39] about that everybody wants a Hilltop
[52:41] experience and they never want to take
[52:44] the valley
[52:45] well you know it's all right to be on
[52:46] the Mountaintop that's good but let me
[52:49] tell you your fruits will freeze up
[52:52] there at night
[52:54] and when the cold spell comes you'll
[52:56] lose all your fruit
[53:00] doesn't grow on the mountaintops
[53:03] fruit grows in the valley
[53:05] where does our faith grow it grows in
[53:07] the valley it grows in the difficulties
[53:10] it grows in the trials brother M says
[53:12] when it comes time for cool spell you've
[53:15] got nothing to rest on
[53:17] when the emotion dies down the shots all
[53:19] gone the noises cease then where are you
[53:22] at the Temptation comes along and you
[53:25] can't take it and so we need Valley
[53:28] experiences to build our faith so that
[53:31] when the cool spell comes we can take it
[53:34] and so before you can have confidence in
[53:37] a person's word you have to have
[53:38] confidence in the person or in the
[53:41] character and that's that sermon that
[53:43] brother Branham preached that was uh
[53:45] about that the character of God and so
[53:48] we have to have experience with with God
[53:51] we have to have experience with God to
[53:54] really know him
[53:55] and these experiences are forged in
[53:58] life's valleys and trials
[54:02] Council of you to buy of me gold tried
[54:04] in the fire
[54:06] it's part of God's plan we we don't like
[54:09] it obviously I don't like it
[54:12] going through a little bit now but it is
[54:15] God's way for second Timothy number
[54:18] chapter one verse seven for God has not
[54:21] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[54:24] and of love and of a sound mind why why
[54:27] did I bring up the scripture
[54:29] uh it's because of the sound mind
[54:33] we're often talking about the soul level
[54:36] and and you know for for good reason
[54:39] that's where the word is and we're
[54:41] looking at the flesh side of our lives
[54:44] and and holding that accountable but we
[54:47] sometimes miss the spirit side of Our
[54:49] Lives that's the the mind the mind and
[54:52] the spirit are synonymous in scripture
[54:54] and so he says of a sound mind and if
[54:58] you if you wanted to do a little
[55:00] research on a sound mind you'll you'll
[55:03] find that there's tremendous lessons in
[55:06] that and and we have to acknowledge
[55:10] that God is looking for us to have a
[55:13] sound mind he doesn't want us believing
[55:16] fairy stories he doesn't want us uh
[55:19] taking things for granted and just
[55:21] assuming that that everything's going to
[55:23] be okay that's not the way God operates
[55:25] God has a plan and a purpose and a
[55:28] process and he needs us to go through
[55:30] those three p's plan perspers and
[55:33] process I'll have to write that down
[55:35] afterwards all right and so that's what
[55:38] he has in mind for us and we cannot
[55:42] bypass that you know the the Tabernacle
[55:44] in the wilderness it had one door right
[55:47] and the first thing you saw when you
[55:49] came through that door
[55:50] was in the in the fence right wasn't a
[55:53] door it was a sheet when you came
[55:56] through that entrance the first thing
[55:58] you saw was the altar of sacrifice
[56:00] and that's where we have to go if we
[56:02] want to have fellowship with Christ we
[56:04] have to start at the cross
[56:06] and we have to acknowledge the the
[56:09] sacrifice that Jesus made for us then
[56:12] the next step in sanctification is with
[56:15] water baptism following the word doing
[56:18] what the word says showing that we can
[56:19] obedient to the word not only obedient
[56:22] to the word but to also put the word
[56:25] together correctly because baptism is a
[56:27] big stumbling block people say what
[56:29] about this what about that but you have
[56:31] to rightly divide the word so the next
[56:34] thing that God does he gives us the
[56:36] water test and you should look through
[56:38] scripture and see how many times God put
[56:41] his people to a water test well the
[56:43] obvious one is the Red Sea right then
[56:45] the Jordan and the the bitter Waters of
[56:47] Mara and the book credon and the Jordan
[56:50] and Elijah and Elisha it goes on and on
[56:53] and on and then the woman at the well
[56:55] the water test
[56:57] remember Rebecca all right well you draw
[57:00] from for for me yes and for your camels
[57:02] too whoa
[57:04] this this is some woman
[57:06] all right so this is the water test
[57:11] so God
[57:13] wants us to understand his word be able
[57:17] to put it together have a sound mind
[57:20] that we aren't believing fairy stories
[57:23] we're seeing patterns we're seeing what
[57:26] God's doing and when we look at that
[57:29] altar of sacrifice and then the Brazen
[57:31] labor and then the next thing is the
[57:33] holy of holies now to get from the door
[57:36] the entrance to the holy place and then
[57:39] into the holy of holies it's a straight
[57:42] line
[57:45] but there's a
[57:47] a theologian
[57:49] called Mr serpent
[57:52] and he has his own way of interpreting
[57:55] the word of God
[57:56] and God Illustrated his way of thinking
[58:01] but taking him and turning him into a
[58:03] long tail
[58:06] a t-a-l-e a story right so you told
[58:10] Eva's story I'm going to make you a
[58:12] story you're gonna be a tale
[58:16] and how does a snake move
[58:19] it slithers from side to side so it
[58:23] might make its way through the entrance
[58:25] but then it's going to bypass the
[58:27] sacrificial Altar and then it's going to
[58:29] bypass the baptism and then it's going
[58:31] to want to get into the holy place
[58:34] that's why it was in a straight line
[58:36] because we have to make sure that we're
[58:39] going God's provided way we're not
[58:42] slithering around trying to get around
[58:45] things we're going straight through the
[58:48] way God intended it so we talked about
[58:50] fear let's um spend oh I think we're
[58:54] actually at the India
[58:57] hahaha
[58:59] um can you give me five minutes I think
[59:01] I can I can get to a stopping point so
[59:04] fear is a magnet that attracts negative
[59:07] thoughts
[59:08] think about that
[59:10] it's like attracting the devil to speak
[59:14] to you
[59:16] because you're confessing something that
[59:19] he believes in
[59:22] and so if he recognizes that you're
[59:25] believing what he's selling
[59:28] he's going to be sure to make sure
[59:31] that he sells it to you
[59:33] and he's going to make it look
[59:34] attractive it's going to look really
[59:36] good and it's going to look like it's
[59:38] not going to be a problem
[59:40] because there was something that
[59:42] attracted him in the first place all
[59:44] right
[59:46] and not only does it attract negative
[59:49] thoughts but it paralyzes you and keeps
[59:52] you from obeying so if you know that if
[59:56] I do this I could have this difficulty I
[59:59] could go through this Valley I could
[1:00:01] have some financial problems if I do
[1:00:03] this if I if I do what I'm supposed to
[1:00:06] do I could have problems that fear
[1:00:09] is going to paralyze you from doing the
[1:00:12] things that God wants you to do and
[1:00:13] remember fear is faith
[1:00:16] only believe all things are possible
[1:00:20] good and bad
[1:00:23] it's something to consider so don't let
[1:00:26] your thinking be dominated by doubts
[1:00:29] all right
[1:00:31] so I'm going to read numbers 13 verse 29
[1:00:34] and you guys don't have to look it up
[1:00:36] it's it's pretty straightforward the
[1:00:39] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[1:00:41] South this is the battle that they were
[1:00:44] facing
[1:00:45] the malachites dwell in the land of the
[1:00:47] South the hittats and the jebusites and
[1:00:49] the amorites dwell in the mountains and
[1:00:51] the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by
[1:00:53] the coast of Jordan and the only thing
[1:00:55] we were missing in that list are the
[1:00:56] mosquito bites but those are things that
[1:00:59] we have to deal with these days all
[1:01:01] right especially here in Ohio so here's
[1:01:04] a map shows you where all there I'm not
[1:01:06] going to spend too much time on that
[1:01:08] where all those different tribes were
[1:01:11] located in Israel as best they can
[1:01:14] determine but you know we also have our
[1:01:17] mosquito bites today
[1:01:19] all right
[1:01:20] we have some Arts today by the way
[1:01:23] anybody who knows um AI knows that I
[1:01:27] generated that image this afternoon
[1:01:30] isn't it good
[1:01:32] AI generated image showing a bunch of
[1:01:35] mosquitoes
[1:01:38] so these are the demons that brother
[1:01:40] Branham talks about right that try to
[1:01:43] come against us they're the battle for
[1:01:46] our soul that we're involved in every
[1:01:48] day or the battle for the mind so
[1:01:50] there's unbelievers
[1:01:52] these are the ones who control the media
[1:01:54] the White House and the Senate and then
[1:01:56] there's the atheats all right then
[1:01:59] there's paganuts and there's muslimats
[1:02:01] and these are the only ones who get to
[1:02:02] enjoy any religious freedom you know not
[1:02:05] not for Christians and of course there's
[1:02:07] the marxites who have taken over all the
[1:02:09] public schools so we're also facing Arts
[1:02:12] all right it's not just the the Hebrews
[1:02:14] right we're we've got our enemy as well
[1:02:17] and he's all around us he's in this
[1:02:19] world he's in every part of our lives
[1:02:21] and we have to be on our God Paul
[1:02:23] Brother Paul's been talking about this
[1:02:25] and and uh and encouraging us and and
[1:02:28] coming against those Spirits uh very
[1:02:31] directly and and this is exactly what
[1:02:34] the Old Testament was designed for was
[1:02:36] designed to give us these patterns that
[1:02:38] we can see how we're to face our enemy
[1:02:41] and then of course we've got our own
[1:02:43] Arts finances are low inflation is high
[1:02:46] health is bad my family's in disarray
[1:02:49] perhaps my job requires I work all kinds
[1:02:52] of hours
[1:02:53] but that's not what we should be focused
[1:02:55] on faith isn't in what might be
[1:02:59] or what could be that's what paralyzes
[1:03:02] US what if what if
[1:03:05] your faith is in the one who knows
[1:03:07] exactly how it's going to be
[1:03:10] that's what the substance of faith is
[1:03:14] it's the things the substance of things
[1:03:17] hoped for we know the end of the book we
[1:03:22] know that God has a plan in our lives
[1:03:26] but we've all been to this church there
[1:03:29] was a church there in the Israelite Camp
[1:03:33] the Hebrew Camp Numbers Chapter 13 but
[1:03:36] the men that went up with him the ten
[1:03:39] spies said we be not able to go up
[1:03:42] against the people for they are stronger
[1:03:45] than we
[1:03:46] so this was the first church of we be
[1:03:49] not able
[1:03:52] and that's how faith can be destroyed in
[1:03:56] our lives
[1:03:57] if we start confessing what we think
[1:04:02] rather than What God Says
[1:04:04] then we're setting ourselves up to see
[1:04:08] the Giants keep on reading the sons of
[1:04:11] anak which come of the Giants and we
[1:04:13] were in our own sight how many sermons
[1:04:16] have you heard on that we were in our
[1:04:18] own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were
[1:04:23] so their confession
[1:04:26] about being grasshoppers
[1:04:29] is exactly what they were
[1:04:33] in their own eyes
[1:04:35] and that's why they didn't go in
[1:04:38] how you see yourself is how the enemy
[1:04:42] will see you you're giving him license
[1:04:46] you're giving him an Open Door you're
[1:04:48] giving him a foothold you're that little
[1:04:51] wedge
[1:04:52] that knows the camel's nose Under the
[1:04:55] Tent
[1:04:56] you're just giving him that little bit
[1:04:58] and he is going to take the whole mile
[1:05:02] and so when we look at those 10 spiers
[1:05:06] they weren't chosen because they were
[1:05:07] weak they weren't chosen because they
[1:05:09] were ignorant they weren't chosen
[1:05:10] because they didn't have faith they
[1:05:12] weren't believers they would have chosen
[1:05:15] of their best men
[1:05:17] to go into the land and spy the land
[1:05:20] But the irony of fear
[1:05:23] is that it'll stop
[1:05:26] the next stage in God's process
[1:05:31] and that's where I'm going to have to
[1:05:32] stop tonight
[1:05:33] those who opposed every new move were
[1:05:36] usually leaders in the last move and as
[1:05:40] I close I'm just going to tell you this
[1:05:42] you cannot ever get where you want to go
[1:05:47] until you lose sight of your own Shore
[1:05:51] you'll never discover new lands until
[1:05:54] you lose sight of your own Shore
[1:05:56] you'll never get where you want to go
[1:05:58] until you're willing to let go of what
[1:06:01] you have
[1:06:02] and that's where fear comes in oh I
[1:06:06] don't know if I can do that I don't know
[1:06:08] if I can do that oh that's a risk
[1:06:11] yes that's exactly the trial that's
[1:06:14] exactly the test that God's putting you
[1:06:16] through can you see the character of God
[1:06:20] can you believe the word of God can you
[1:06:24] see his the way he's always dealt with
[1:06:26] you and I don't have time to go into
[1:06:28] that I'd love to but there is a way that
[1:06:31] God deals with each one of us and we
[1:06:33] need to be able to recognize what that
[1:06:36] is sometimes God deals with one person
[1:06:38] in a different way from another so you
[1:06:40] can't take well God did that for that
[1:06:42] person therefore I'll do that no that
[1:06:44] doesn't work you've got to follow the
[1:06:46] path that God has laid down in your life
[1:06:48] because he knows the information he's
[1:06:51] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:06:54] so God bless you all thank you for your
[1:06:56] time this evening sorry you're going to
[1:06:57] little long but we'll pick it up again
[1:07:00] on Sunday Lord will
[1:07:03] foreign
[1:07:12] it's it's a joy to speak on this subject
[1:07:15] especially when you're going through a
[1:07:18] bit of a trial
[1:07:19] because that's the idea right I can say
[1:07:22] things that my ears my ears here and so
[1:07:25] I appreciate that it's a privilege that
[1:07:28] us preachers get to have sometimes but
[1:07:30] it's not just for us we should be his
[1:07:33] word in our mouth is as powerful as his
[1:07:35] word in his mouth
[1:07:38] it is because he's given us that power
[1:07:41] amen the Lord bless you brother Gideon
