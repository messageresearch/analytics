six things doth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him if you never knew this morning what the Lord really hates people can have a lot of versions of What the Lord hates but this is what the Bible says it narrows it down to seven things a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth Wicked imagin ations feet that be Swift in running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among who the Brethren this might be somebody closer than just somebody out in the world this is among the Brethren amen but these are things seven things that God hates but the spirit of every age is trying to come and work in the people and that's why I'm bringing it more to a local level because we see that sometimes firsthand it will try to work among the people it'll try to work in the people and these characteristics that are here that are things that God hates uh I want to get to that in just a minute but I just want to say but uh that the spirit will always try to work among the people on a local level uh no matter how small the congregation no matter how small the Gathering is no matter what they believe if they what whatever they believe if they believe the the message of restoration for the last days or if they believe uh certain uh truths of the Bible it doesn't matter the Gathering whenever there's truth being presented then we know the enemy is trying to work but where's he working he gets among the people to start some type of divide between one another that's his job that's what he's always done to plant the wrong seed he did it in the garden of Eden he told Eve the wrong thing which he planted the wrong seed not even not just physically to Eve but Also spiritually the serpent planted the wrong seed in Eve's mind so this is the work of the enemy to say to to say something that's not completely off the word but just distorted it's distorted can you say amen and and so take something distorted and plant it as a seed sewn in Eve's mind cuz knows if I can get that in there then it'll have fruit come from it someday this is the enemy's work to work amongst the people in the minds of the people and I want to say that part of our discernment as a Christian of all Satan's work throughout the ages we are living the last days so with the revealing of the seven Church ages and the revealing of the Seven Seals which he left until the end time the people of God would be able to look back and have discernment of how the devil worked from day one to try to divide the church we have a discernment of how the Antichrist Spirit Works how it worked then how it worked Through the Ages and we should know how it works here we need discernment and when John talked about the Antichrist Spirit which he spoke more about it he used the term the Antichrist 1 second third John he his theme was number one truth and lies but truth and then his other theme was love because there's only one true genuine response to the Antichrist spirit and by the way it's not debate it's not that we have more Doctrine it's genuine perfect love in response to that Antichrist Spirit CU I guarantee you that Antichrist Spirit talks about love it thinks it knows about love but it does not have the root of love Jesus Christ and so how do we combat an antichrist Spirit Divine love read it in your Bible 1 second third John Brothers love one another it's all about love it's all about truth we know that it's Antichrist spirit it's not dwelling in all truth that's how we discern it so it doesn't take a a rocket science here to figure this out it's in the Bible and part of our discernment is recognizing in every age of what Spirit he worked in what he did but to use that discernment we have to use our discernment of what how Satan works we have to use it now if we know these things we have to use it and apply it now can you say Amen part of our discernment we must know how it works and to properly withstand when it tries to work in you when it tries to influence you and locally in your own church or in your family that's why I want to talk about how Proverbs 6 plays out in the local church I'd like to preach on so what do we got here we got the church ages in Proverbs 6 today we're going to have the local church in Proverbs 6 I'd like to talk about the home in Proverbs 6 you can take these characteristics and how they work this is what God hates in every age and when these things pop up they are not of God a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a false witness speaking lies these are not of God and God actually hates them they're an Abomination to him so if we can see him working anyway anywhere we are to withstand these things God give me a church if they're going to stand strong in anything let them stand and withstand withstand these things when they begin to work Among Us amen may they put these spirits in their place and say you need to stop talking you need to quit bringing an accusation against an elder you need to quit saying those things because I don't know if that's full truth and until I know it's truth we need to stop talking about it you need to stop gossiping oh to have a strong Church to shut down boy we shut down the wrong dress we shut down the short skirts we shut this down and that's fine but how about shutting down the thing that God really hates how about shutting down gossip how about about shutting down a person who devises Wicked imaginations how about shutting down a false witness can I get any amens here this morning if you can't say Amen say ouch or something but I'm going to tell the truth this is the core of what God hates brings me to a couple of foundational points I want to make this morning we in the message got to quit putting the Antichrist Spirit out there it's so easy to do it's such a bad word it's such a bad thing that into Christ spirit and it is bad it started in the early church it's come to fruition today and it's here it's working but we need to stop putting it always oh yes the Antichrist Spirit oh the mother of harlots oh the systems oh it's out there it's out there I'm here to tell you brothers and sisters is that he does not stop at those doors he wants to come and bring an antichrist Spirit Among Us and already has it's all right you don't have to say Amen that loud but we've been around long enough to see that the devil doesn't say just by the name on the church on the door he can sneak through any door can you say Amen so the characteristics are there and we're not immune from it working Among Us I think the Lord has been directly warning us as a church from brother M Brian Naidu in his service I can comment on that but ever since then I just felt this he talked about discernment of where we're at now 400 prophets anointed using quotes against Micah and Micah had to stand by himself and yet the Bible says all 400 of those Jewish prophets were under a a lying spirit so you got 400 to one one Prophet want 400 with a lying Spirit on him the percentages of lying was higher than what than the ministers and Prophets that was being preached 400 to1 and so now we need discernment internally how subtle this would start can you say Amen maybe Proverbs 6 is more revealing of the manner that the Antichrist Spirit starts than what we even realize in the garden how subtle it was to start in the early church it started just as a saying amongst the people then it became a deed it wasn't a Doctrine yet it started as a saying amongst the people people it's what people were talking about then it became a deed can you say Amen then it become a Doctrine and then a Spirit came on them to kill anything that disagreed with it where's that come from I don't come from God in the name of the church they were killing other Christians in the name of Doctrine in the name and that's how far that Antichrist Spirit can go from the white horse rider to the red horse rider to to the the the black horse and now the Pale Horse Rider riding now what's a mixture of them all death can you say Amen so this is not the true church this is the Antichrist spirit and so now I I just want to can can we just hold your finger there in Proverbs 6 I'll come back but can you just look at what I'm saying just as a quick example all the way back in the book of Acts I think it's verse chapter 20 yes how far can we trace the Antichrist Spirit back when the early church started all the way to the book of Acts and so this I'm just pausing on this CU I want everybody to know in case you don't know Antichrist did Spirit didn't start in the middle of the ages it didn't start uh many many years later it didn't start at the end time no we're at the fruition at the end time here's where it started when Paul's getting ready to go Jerusalem he said I go Bound in my spirit because the council the systems were going to be the one that put him to death Rome would put him to death but watch what Paul says just before he's taken a prisoner in the next few chapters watch what he's saying to the brothers that's around him here in Ephesians and the different churches he says verse 27 chapter 20: 27 for I have not shunn to declare unto you all the counsel of God so praise the Lord somebody gave us all the counsel he didn't held back anything verse 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to the flock over the which the Holy Ghost ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in where among you now he's not talking about the council in Rome that's getting ready to to take him out he's talking about wolves I'm prophesying that after I'm gone wolves will enter among you so here's the true prophet of God the Apostle the prophet for the age can you say Amen First Church age messenger but now he says it's after I'm gone right anybody listening pay attention after I'm gone so there'll be a Thrust of this happening to go after the Sheep after my departing wolves will come in among yourselves and uh you know feed the flock these are all instructions because that's how you're going to ward off the enemy is these overseers to feed the flock to feed the church which he has purchased his own blood for I know that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and what does that mean it's not in other words they're not holding back actually who they're going for they're not they're not going to say well I'm just going to bring this spirit and I'm going to try to destroy things no they won't spare the flock it's the flock who they're going for and a lot of times the weaker ones the ones that aren't established the way they should be but he these these wolves these preachers whatever they are are going after the flock God's flock this is happening in Acts chap 20 Acts chapter 2 is the birth of the church the Antichrist spirit is going to already begin to work by people coming up among yourselves also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things that word perverse means distorted things it not necessarily black and white okay that's wrong this is right it's perverting it's distorted it's taking the truth and distorting it like the serpent did to Eve it's a distortion of Truth perverse speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone day and night with tears he had already been warning of this for three years before well that's pretty close to his conversion right after his conversion he's already warning his brothers to say when I'm gone this Antichrist he didn't call an antichrist but this Antichrist Spirit would be in its beginnings and the beginnings if we could have discernment for the beginnings then we can have what we need to withstand can you say Amen because that's what we're supposed to do contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints to earnestly contend for the faith and so we don't know how to contend unless we know this could it be that some of these simple things in Proverbs Chapter 6 could it be that these are the early starts not the doctrine it starts with these little things beginning to work because if you have a lying tongue if you have a false witness if you have a proud look that's the character issues that are lacking there that false Doctrine can get in and I don't think it's FAL doctrine that splits churches I think that's the last result because when someone is very bitter towards somebody else when somebody is uh speaking lies against somebody else when they're doing these things already then they have to have a reason to leave they have to have a reason to split the church so I'm going to find some quotes that endorse what I think I'm going to find some scriptures and we're going to have a battle and so the split ends up looking like it's a doctrinal split but it's not because why things have to do with the heart first can I get an amen bitterness starts in the heart first not Doctrine a lying tongue can you say one who SWS Discord among the Brethren you see it doesn't start with the doctrine first it starts with small things remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempting destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire what is the book of rev why do we have the Book of Revelations the last book of the Bible it exposes the entire scheme of Satan throughout the ages that the people in the end time can look back with discernment and see I see them I see him I see the trail of The Serpent and he wasn't in a bar somewhere he was in the church quoting the word can I get an amen the serpent was quoting the word misquoting it and he's still doing it today and so he goes on to say this Revelation comes out of the Book of Revelations he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do with the Greater Works look at all that that we get through revelation in the last days the true church if he knows that she gets a true revelation of the true church who the true church is and what she is and what she stands for do you know that do you know the true church do you know what she really stands for you should know that because that'll give you discernment to tell the false from the true when she gets a revelation she will be an invincible Army Revelation she can do do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit get this point we are called to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit wherever it's trying to work and we do it by Revelation by Love by humility but we do with discernment and withstanding Satan will be powerless before her how many would like to live every day where Satan's powerless Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot pre Prevail against us but we will prevail over them my second Point here as a foundation these seven things that God hates are so unlike things we would think God hates we would probably attach other things to what God hates an Abomination is a strong word to use for these things and we're talking about somebody who speaks a false witness and devises IM uh uh Wicked imaginations a proud look somebody's got a proud look Abomination that's a strong word how many know Abomination is a strong word it's stronger than just sin it's Abomination is a strong word to use on these things it's discussed it's deeper than discuss it's hatred it's a feeling of hatred in other words God hates these seven things now I know and you know you should know there are other Abominations in the Bible besides these seven there's other Abominations there's about 70 plus Abominations listed there is 667 listed sins and from what I read not all sins rise to the level of an Abomination if God has an Abomination and hates something then he still does well how do we get out of all that only the grace of God through the cross how do we meet it all only through the cross only through his righteousness not your own he knew we could fail at all 667 he knew we didn't have a any chance can you say amen and he went to Calvary he paid the price for our sin he opened the day door for the Holy Ghost he put his Spirit within us can you say Amen there's no way to live this except through the Holy Ghost there's only one person that can live this word and that's him coming and living in you you can't live it but he can live it in you so my point is why did Solomon in Proverbs six only lists six or seven of these as Abominations when we've talked about some other ones and and why did he narrow it down to seven and they are so what we would not choose the world would choose what God hates is smoking and drinking and adultery and murder and then you come into the Christian realm and we would choose Abominations like somebody's wearing the wrong dress or church order or paying your tithes or false doct we would say that's that's a hate God hates that but here's these in Proverbs 6 maybe we tend to choose what we decide what God hates if it's in our hands we would not choose these things that Solomon narrowed it down to seven we probably wouldn't choose these as Abominations but they might be dead on that God hates these as they are the beginning of a lot of sin and they are related to the heart and they are related to hurting unity
