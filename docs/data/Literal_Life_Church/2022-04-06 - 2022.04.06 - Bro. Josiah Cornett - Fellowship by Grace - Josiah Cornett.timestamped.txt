[0:00] can get it all
[0:01] all worked up and ready to go for the
[0:03] the word amen
[0:06] all right i'll take that that means that
[0:07] you're here this at the ephesians 2 and
[0:10] verse 5 is where we're at
[0:12] and
[0:13] the
[0:14] apostle paul writing says even when we
[0:17] were dead in sins
[0:19] he hath quickened us together in christ
[0:22] for by grace are you saved
[0:26] and hath raised us up together and made
[0:28] us sit together in heavenly places in
[0:32] christ jesus
[0:34] and over in 1st john chapter 1
[0:36] and verse 7
[0:38] and as just as you're turning there i'll
[0:40] give you a little bit of background
[0:42] this weekend i had a a wonderful time
[0:45] with uh in fellowship with a brother
[0:47] that came up for the baby shower of
[0:49] laura's and his wife came up and uh we
[0:51] just sat down i was just one of the
[0:53] brothers that in the natural we're
[0:55] probably just about as opposite as a
[0:57] spoon and fork i suppose but we could
[1:00] sit down have hours of conversation just
[1:02] talking about the lord and talking about
[1:04] the word and uh just so much
[1:08] just so much fellowship because we had a
[1:11] basis for self-fellowship and the same
[1:13] spirit and the same thing that we could
[1:15] fellowship around
[1:16] and uh it just impressed upon my heart
[1:18] that i wanted to speak something about
[1:20] fellowship
[1:21] and brother paul came along and preached
[1:24] on grace this sunday and i feel to take
[1:27] the service
[1:28] fellowship by grace you're saved by
[1:30] grace but also there's something beyond
[1:33] just salvation there's a fellowship by
[1:35] grace
[1:37] and so in first john 1 7 we get another
[1:39] taste of that now no longer the
[1:42] epistle of
[1:43] paul but also the epistle of john now so
[1:46] by two witnesses he says
[1:49] but if we walk together in the light as
[1:51] he is in the light we have fellowship
[1:53] one with another and the blood of jesus
[1:56] christ cleanses
[1:58] us from all sin
[2:00] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[2:02] his word as you're seated
[2:05] and
[2:06] just
[2:07] taking that that thought then of
[2:09] fellowship here we
[2:11] we think about here
[2:13] john's talking about here we're we're
[2:15] being quickened together and now we're
[2:17] in heavenly places in christ jesus so by
[2:20] grace are we saved through faith and
[2:22] that not of ourselves it is the gift of
[2:24] god but it goes beyond that that we're
[2:27] now welcomed into fellowship and i i
[2:29] just think maybe to take a little survey
[2:31] down to the old testament to me to kind
[2:33] of catch what fellowship meant to our
[2:35] forefathers and what fellowship means to
[2:37] us today we look at what fellowship was
[2:41] before
[2:42] sin came in and before before the
[2:44] covenant was broken in the garden and
[2:46] before adam and eve made their initial
[2:48] sin
[2:49] we saw that there was perfect fellowship
[2:52] there was perfect fellowship between man
[2:54] and god that god walked in the garden
[2:56] with man
[2:58] and in the cool of the evening god and
[3:00] himself came down and had fellowship
[3:03] with man that the creation and creator
[3:06] was one and that creation was even in
[3:09] fellowship with one another that adam
[3:11] could could divinely orchestrate
[3:13] everything that happened in that garden
[3:15] he could he could call the animals
[3:17] before him and named them one by one and
[3:19] there was just there was no disobedience
[3:22] there was no there was no fear of those
[3:24] animals the creation was in harmony with
[3:26] one another so it's not just fellowship
[3:28] between man and god that had to be
[3:31] restored but fellowship between man and
[3:33] all of creation which was under him and
[3:36] subject to him
[3:37] all that was lost when adam made his sin
[3:41] you look at the the fellowship that eve
[3:42] and adam had together that there was a
[3:45] perfect fellowship between man and woman
[3:48] and how many brothers and sisters could
[3:50] say this evening that we're still trying
[3:51] to get back there
[3:53] we're still not quite there at perfect
[3:55] fellowship
[3:56] thank god for the holy ghost today and
[3:58] thank god that we're both saved and
[3:59] redeemed but there's still something
[4:01] more that we're trying to obtain to
[4:02] we're still on a journey back to eden oh
[4:06] and if you think that marriage is good
[4:08] right now brother sister just imagine
[4:10] how wonderful it's going to be when we
[4:12] have ourselves all the way back to eden
[4:15] all the way back to that original
[4:17] covenant that didn't have any sin in the
[4:19] picture whatsoever
[4:21] so that's what we're going back to is
[4:23] we're we're getting back to this
[4:25] fellowship but what is fellowship by
[4:27] fellowship is not something that we
[4:29] merit something is not it's not
[4:31] something that we earn of god i was just
[4:33] thinking in my car the other day just
[4:35] being real honest with the lord and i
[4:37] was thinking about the the the uh
[4:40] the great paradox of man's free will and
[4:43] and god's sovereignty
[4:45] and i said my god you you predestinated
[4:48] me
[4:48] and and and
[4:50] and and i couldn't do anything
[4:52] that would commend myself to you lord
[4:55] there there's nothing that i could have
[4:56] done that would have
[4:58] to build up my resume to make you want
[5:01] to choose me
[5:03] right and yet i know that it's it's god
[5:05] that draws and and not myself i i didn't
[5:09] go seeking after god he he went and
[5:11] sought after me
[5:13] and i i was just standing i was just
[5:15] sitting there in my car and i was just
[5:17] trying to work it out in my mind and i
[5:18] said lord i i i could never hope to have
[5:22] you choose me but one thing i know
[5:26] i i can't put myself in your mind and
[5:28] understand your choices but one thing i
[5:31] know
[5:32] is that i choose you
[5:35] i just cried out from from the honesty
[5:37] of my heart and
[5:39] i said lord i i choose you lord yes
[5:42] you are my choice above my wife above my
[5:46] children above above all things of life
[5:48] above anything that i could do today if
[5:50] you ask me would you would you like to
[5:52] have fellowship with god right now or
[5:54] watch a movie i would say i want to have
[5:57] fellowship with god now sometimes i go
[6:00] ahead and watch a movie because i don't
[6:02] know how to get into god's presence at
[6:04] that moment or i don't feel i don't feel
[6:06] worthy to get into his presence but if
[6:08] it was just a matter of pushing a button
[6:10] i would always choose push the button of
[6:12] getting into god's presence
[6:14] i know that in my heart of hearts i
[6:17] choose you and i said that to the lord i
[6:19] said i don't know if you would choose me
[6:21] lord in this moment i don't know if you
[6:23] would choose to come down and bless me
[6:25] with your grace and your presence in
[6:27] this moment
[6:28] but i choose you and just like that i
[6:30] felt his presence rush in and he said
[6:33] the very fact that you choose me is
[6:35] showing you evidence that i chose you
[6:38] because you'd never sought me i drew you
[6:41] no man can come unto me except i draw
[6:45] him first so the very fact that you're
[6:47] coming unto me is evidence and there's a
[6:50] token unto you that i drew you that i
[6:53] chose you
[6:55] oh there's a whole world out there that
[6:57] doesn't know anything about the presence
[6:59] of god that doesn't want anything to do
[7:01] with the presence of god but i believe
[7:03] that i'm standing in an audience this
[7:05] evening that says we choose to have the
[7:08] presence of god
[7:10] oh hallelujah that's that's here seeking
[7:13] his presence this asking god lord i i
[7:16] don't know what your choice would be
[7:17] this evening but our choice was to come
[7:19] to church
[7:21] our choice was to worship you
[7:23] our choice was to sit down and hear the
[7:25] word
[7:27] and i believe that god's heart would
[7:29] come back and echo back to each heart
[7:30] this evening and say
[7:32] the very fact that you have that desire
[7:35] is evidence that i'm here amongst you
[7:37] this evening
[7:39] oh don't be don't be fooled by the wiles
[7:41] the enemy god is not far away
[7:45] god is near to those who seek him
[7:48] oh hallelujah he said in the scripture
[7:50] that those who seek me
[7:52] would be found of me
[7:54] and so all through the old testament we
[7:56] have
[7:57] evidence of those who sought after god
[7:59] we
[8:00] look at abel and how god just divinely
[8:04] came in even though his parents had done
[8:06] what they had done and had broken
[8:08] fellowship yet man was right there being
[8:10] drawn back into god's presence
[8:13] it wasn't able seeking after god but it
[8:15] was god divinely giving him a revelation
[8:18] you want back into my presence
[8:20] it has to be by the blood there has to
[8:22] be a basis for our fellowship
[8:25] and it has to be by this blood yes
[8:28] and so abel from the very beginning he
[8:30] had fellowship with god through
[8:31] revelation and by the basis of the shed
[8:35] blood
[8:37] we look at enoch and how that we have
[8:39] this great pattern that we all look to
[8:41] that enoch not walked with god
[8:44] and he was not
[8:46] what a a great end sample for us at the
[8:48] end time that there will be a people
[8:49] that are walking with god and simply
[8:52] they'll be not for god takes them
[8:54] it was one in enoch's time and no doubt
[8:56] they hardly noticed he was gone and
[8:59] it'll be the same thing in our
[9:00] generation i believe
[9:02] but we have this fellowship with god and
[9:04] god's god's story begins to develop with
[9:07] his people but here they are
[9:09] seeking after god but it's a god that's
[9:11] drawing them first and showing them away
[9:13] into his presence
[9:15] you see that when you open up the sto
[9:18] the book of genesis and you read the
[9:19] story of noah that noah wasn't seeking
[9:22] after god that god was seeking after
[9:25] someone to save he said i have to bring
[9:27] judgment i have to change the course of
[9:30] this present world i have to i have to
[9:32] fulfill
[9:33] the the cup of the iniq the cup of their
[9:35] iniquity is full i have to bring forth
[9:38] judgment but i'm seeking someone to save
[9:41] oh hallelujah and he said that he found
[9:44] one man in his family that was righteous
[9:46] in his generation
[9:48] god found the man that man didn't find
[9:50] god he might have been righteous by
[9:52] god's choosing but that man was still
[9:54] not searching after god it was god that
[9:57] came to noah
[9:59] and god
[10:00] gave him grace
[10:02] and noah found grace in the sight of god
[10:05] unto what until the salvation of his
[10:07] family
[10:09] it was by faith but it was also by grace
[10:13] because we cannot have faith without
[10:14] first having god's grace amen
[10:17] so we come after the ant deluvian
[10:19] destruction and man is goes down across
[10:22] his generations and the next lifeline
[10:24] that we pick up is that of abraham
[10:27] and here god seeks out abraham again
[10:30] it's not man coming to god first he was
[10:32] he was bound underneath all these
[10:34] multiplicity of
[10:36] of gods and his father i believe was a
[10:39] craftsman of gods and and made the
[10:42] graven images
[10:43] but god came to abraham i said why don't
[10:46] you come walk with me
[10:48] why don't you come to a land that i've
[10:50] prepared for you
[10:52] why don't you come to the land of my
[10:54] promises
[10:55] leave behind everything you've known
[10:57] leave behind the gods and the prayers
[11:00] and
[11:00] and no doubt they had their philosophies
[11:03] and their theologies that abraham had to
[11:05] leave behind
[11:07] and just come and have fellowship with
[11:09] me
[11:10] and and abraham had to step out on faith
[11:12] because this was this was a god without
[11:14] a name he he didn't have a whole lot of
[11:17] understanding of this god but he knew
[11:19] that somebody was talking to him
[11:21] and he began to step out on faith and we
[11:24] see what god thought of abraham
[11:26] he said of abraham how shall i show how
[11:30] shall i hide these things from abraham
[11:32] when he was looking at the destruction
[11:34] of sodom how shall i hide all that i'm
[11:36] going to be doing from abraham when i
[11:38] know that his those children will be
[11:41] taught and instructed by him
[11:43] that i i can trust abraham with teaching
[11:46] his children and it was just god's grace
[11:48] to to this man of god
[11:51] and we even look at david as we come
[11:53] down the the pipeline of the old
[11:55] testament a man after god's own heart
[11:59] so much so that they said i i want to
[12:01] dwell in the tabernacle of the almighty
[12:04] all the days of my life
[12:06] i always
[12:07] get so struck by david here he is the
[12:10] the the prince of israel if you will the
[12:12] very king of israel but he says i i
[12:14] don't want to be in my throne room
[12:16] i don't want to be i want i don't want
[12:18] to be decked out with all these
[12:20] tapestries i just want to be
[12:22] in the house of my god
[12:24] just let me be a doorman in the house of
[12:26] god let me let me be as we're the
[12:28] greeter at the door or the deacon or i
[12:31] don't even have to be behind the pulpit
[12:32] just just let me find myself in god's
[12:35] presence
[12:37] because although they had a basis of
[12:39] fellowship by a shed blood yet there was
[12:41] something about it that they could not
[12:43] come into a perpetual fellowship with
[12:45] god
[12:46] that's what they were seeking is they
[12:47] were they were seeking after the
[12:49] perpetual presence an abiding presence
[12:52] of jesus christ he said i just i just
[12:54] want to abide there underneath the
[12:56] shadow of the almighty let me find
[12:58] myself underneath the covert of thy
[13:00] wings
[13:01] all the psalms expressed david's desire
[13:04] but yet he did not have what you have
[13:06] this evening that's true he did not have
[13:08] the outpouring of the holy ghost he did
[13:10] not have the abiding presence of god
[13:12] that he was looking for that was for
[13:14] another day he without us was not yet
[13:17] made perfect he was looking unto the
[13:20] coming of christ he was looking unto the
[13:22] day of acts where the holy ghost would
[13:24] be poured out upon god's people but he
[13:27] could not yet be a partaker of that
[13:29] that was for another day
[13:31] but he he could partake as much as he
[13:33] was able that there was there was still
[13:35] a basis of fellowship there was still
[13:37] the shed blood that he could he could go
[13:39] into god's presence because he knew that
[13:41] that priest that was offering sacrifices
[13:44] continually on behalf of the people of
[13:46] israel daily that priest would come oh
[13:49] my and offer the sacrifice every single
[13:53] day and because the priest was offering
[13:55] the sacrifice because the priest kept on
[13:57] doing their due diligence israel could
[14:00] have faith
[14:02] that
[14:03] god was in their midst that they were
[14:06] keeping the tenants of god
[14:07] i i think about how weary some that
[14:10] would be for a pastor to keep on
[14:12] offering the sacrifices on behalf of the
[14:14] people today aren't you so glad brother
[14:16] paul that we're not the priests today
[14:19] that we have that we have a greater high
[14:21] priest amongst us whereas the priests
[14:23] and times past had to enter in daily
[14:26] there was this one man christ jesus they
[14:29] entered in once and paid the price of
[14:31] redemption
[14:33] and so what is the basis of fellowship
[14:35] for us today it's based upon the shed
[14:37] blood of jesus christ
[14:40] and i want to say just as he paid the
[14:42] price once we receive the price once
[14:46] that your redemption is not subject and
[14:49] hanging in the balance from day to day
[14:52] your redemption once received cannot be
[14:55] lost
[14:56] oh what a wonderful security we have in
[14:59] jesus christ
[15:03] the christ came in once and paid for
[15:05] that that we don't have to keep on
[15:07] trying to get our redemption paid for
[15:11] but it's been paid one time
[15:14] think of the power of that blood
[15:17] they were offering sacrifice daily for
[15:19] thousands of years
[15:21] and then jesus christ comes in
[15:23] lays the price on the table and it's
[15:25] settled for all of time
[15:28] all that i'll bring such a security to
[15:30] our hearts this evening
[15:32] so what is our approach now to
[15:35] fellowship
[15:37] whereas in times past david longed for
[15:40] fellowship with god
[15:42] the christian today has a different
[15:44] approach to god
[15:46] we don't keep on going in daily asking
[15:49] for god to save us
[15:50] asking for god to forgive us for our low
[15:54] estate although we do make mistakes we
[15:57] do have sins
[15:58] but the bible says
[16:00] now he says if you have sins
[16:04] just simply
[16:06] confess them to god and he is faithful
[16:09] and just to forgive us our sins
[16:13] what blows me about that scripture what
[16:15] blows my mind
[16:17] is that he would attach
[16:19] god's justice
[16:21] with our forgiveness
[16:26] before there was there was no basis for
[16:29] god to have any
[16:32] any obligations towards us
[16:37] but now
[16:38] because he's paid the price by his own
[16:40] blood
[16:42] he's brought his own self by his own
[16:45] life
[16:46] under obligations to his own people who
[16:48] he has called his own family
[16:51] that he's paid the price
[16:54] and because the price has been paid it's
[16:56] now justice to forgive us of ourselves
[17:03] yes sir it means when satan comes
[17:06] against us and says
[17:07] you don't have any right to salvation
[17:10] you can say
[17:12] by my own merits you're correct
[17:15] but the truth is
[17:17] that jesus christ legally paid for my
[17:20] sins
[17:22] and if this matter goes to court
[17:25] i will win
[17:27] if this matter of my sin ever makes its
[17:30] way to court i'll win it and you'll be
[17:33] the defeated prosecutor maya he jesus
[17:37] christ stands today as my attorney he
[17:40] stands today as my judge but he also
[17:42] stands today as the one who made the
[17:44] propitiation for my sins in the first
[17:47] place saying you don't have a case and
[17:50] it's it's so bad your prosecuting
[17:53] attorney is so bad that it's never going
[17:55] to make itself to the bar
[17:58] did you know that down at the county
[18:00] courthouse the prosecutor has to have
[18:03] has to prove to the court
[18:05] that he has a case before he can even
[18:07] bring it to the judge
[18:09] and if he can't make that preliminary
[18:13] case to the judge to get their approval
[18:16] the judge will just tell them this is
[18:18] not even worth my time
[18:21] i'm throwing it out i'm not even going
[18:23] to have a bailiff bring him in here
[18:25] hurry up and unlock that holding cell
[18:29] and let him out of here there will be no
[18:31] sentence from this banister
[18:35] and paul says that there is no judgment
[18:38] there remaineth therefore no judgment to
[18:41] the people of god
[18:42] they've passed from death and to life
[18:44] and there will be no white throne
[18:47] judgment for god's elect
[18:49] the case has been thrown out already the
[18:52] key has been put in the door of your
[18:54] holding cell this evening and god sets
[18:57] you free god sets you free from
[19:00] depression god sets you free from oh
[19:03] satan says you deserve to be depressed
[19:06] think about all the things you've done
[19:08] think about all you deserve not to have
[19:10] any friends think about the kind of
[19:12] person you are but god comes down and
[19:15] says that case is absolutely wrong i
[19:19] throw it out i pl i paid my blood for
[19:22] him and if he doesn't have any friends
[19:25] on the whole face the earth i'll vouch
[19:27] for him as my friend because i said in
[19:30] my scripture i no longer call him a
[19:32] servant but i call him my friend because
[19:35] he has made himself subject to my
[19:38] commandments and so everything so much
[19:40] that he does whatsoever i tell him
[19:43] oh hallelujah now we're getting down to
[19:46] real fellowship
[19:47] now we're getting down to a real
[19:49] intimate relationship with jesus christ
[19:52] he says my that's my friend over there
[19:56] grace slacked is my friend brandon
[19:58] sinacola is my friend
[20:00] paula fontaine is my friend
[20:05] because i've bought him with my blood
[20:08] and i've made him i've adopted him into
[20:10] my family
[20:12] but now we're we're not just left there
[20:14] friends
[20:15] i mean it would be enough to say i've
[20:17] got a friend in god
[20:19] forget about the old song you've got a
[20:21] friend in me
[20:22] i've got a friend in god
[20:26] that would be enough i could take my
[20:27] seat right now we could rejoice the rest
[20:30] the evening
[20:31] just knowing that we've got a friend in
[20:33] god
[20:35] but you know what since satan's already
[20:37] left the building yeah
[20:39] i saw him running out that door a few
[20:41] minutes ago
[20:42] [Applause]
[20:44] why don't we go ahead and enjoy
[20:45] ourselves a little bit more
[20:47] hardly a time where we get them off our
[20:49] backs but i feel i i feel a little bit
[20:51] of a light atmosphere tonight like like
[20:53] something just lifted
[20:55] how about we talk about the other
[20:57] friends that god's given us
[20:59] because we come back to the scripture
[21:00] here and it says
[21:02] while we were dead in sins we've been
[21:04] quickened
[21:06] all by ourselves with no
[21:08] together with christ
[21:11] that yes by grace we're saved but by
[21:13] grace we're also saved together
[21:17] he's raised us up together and made us
[21:20] sit here
[21:21] and in heaven in heavenly places all by
[21:24] ourselves no with christ oh that'd be
[21:26] enough but
[21:28] together oh hallelujah
[21:31] oh you do have a friend in me
[21:34] you do have a friend and the brother or
[21:36] sister sitting beside you you're the
[21:38] same blood you're the same family you're
[21:41] the same genetics you're the same seed
[21:44] gene of god you're the same heritage
[21:47] you're the same story from the very
[21:49] beginning where were you when the sons
[21:51] of god shouted for joy your story is the
[21:54] same this evening
[21:56] oh hallelujah
[21:58] isn't it true that when we first meet
[22:00] somebody we kind of asked them well
[22:02] where are you from and what do you do
[22:04] and
[22:05] we're trying to find some kind of basis
[22:07] for fellowship with them
[22:09] but when you come and meet a son or
[22:11] daughter of god
[22:13] that basis of fellowship is already
[22:15] there
[22:16] that's not where you're from we know
[22:18] where we come from
[22:20] what do we do we serve the lord
[22:23] what are you going to do with your life
[22:24] i'm going to keep on serving until he
[22:26] comes what are you going to do with your
[22:28] life after that i'm going to sit around
[22:29] the marriage table for three and a half
[22:31] years while the rest of this sound
[22:33] condition falls apart
[22:35] and then i'm going to rule and read with
[22:36] you brother paul for another thousand
[22:38] years
[22:39] i know my story with you
[22:42] we have a commonality
[22:44] we have a common father abraham
[22:47] we know each other's story
[22:50] oh hallelujah we have a basis for
[22:52] fellowship this evening
[22:54] there's god's grace to us
[22:57] there's fellowship by grace
[23:00] not fellowship by video games
[23:02] trying to proctor a relationship
[23:04] virtually
[23:05] not fellowship by the super bowl not
[23:08] fellowship by hobbies and and and
[23:11] and boats and soccer and football those
[23:14] things may be all right some of them
[23:16] can be enjoyed fine
[23:18] but that's not the basis of our
[23:19] fellowship
[23:21] so those are something those are things
[23:22] that we do
[23:24] but all these things will pass away but
[23:26] yet there will remain with one thing
[23:28] when my hobbies on this world are gone
[23:31] get my relationship with you brother
[23:33] sister come on
[23:38] i hope that if the lord would terry our
[23:40] our sons and our daughters would grow up
[23:42] together i see these little ones sitting
[23:44] on the front row
[23:46] and we have a hope that as they come to
[23:48] the lord
[23:49] they'll not just form friendships like
[23:51] at the play group at school or something
[23:54] but there's eternal bonds being made
[23:57] amen
[23:58] and it's a heritage that we're built
[23:59] we're privileged we're graced to build
[24:03] together here
[24:04] what a beautiful thing as a body is
[24:07] we can think about the body corporate
[24:09] and global but what a beautiful thing
[24:11] this body is
[24:13] we can talk about the
[24:14] the story that we have together
[24:17] down through time but what about the
[24:18] story that this church here has together
[24:22] brother brandon and i were talking about
[24:24] it in the back room and just some of the
[24:27] wonderful memories we have in this
[24:29] church some of the older ones i seems
[24:31] like i've always seen brother kenny
[24:33] dancing around while playing his piano
[24:35] and we came back from arizona it was
[24:37] like a homecoming
[24:39] i i remember that it's it's a sacred
[24:41] history that we have together we were
[24:43] talking about the the old times and
[24:46] steve steve johnson leading the the
[24:48] youth meetings and i remember all the
[24:50] young people gathered around on the
[24:52] floor and some of them was sitting there
[24:54] and grace i remember you
[24:56] i remember 12 13 years old
[24:59] as brother stephen was
[25:01] preaching and or just sharing with us
[25:03] tears were rolling down your face i
[25:05] remember that
[25:06] as you responded the word i remember
[25:08] brandon walking out after church
[25:11] going straight to his truck and just
[25:13] sitting there because he wasn't yet at a
[25:15] time in his life where he was enjoying
[25:16] the grace of fellowship
[25:18] but look at god's grace to us now
[25:21] and what a privilege we have to enjoy
[25:23] his ministry and his friendship
[25:26] it's god's grace to us in this
[25:29] little church called literal life
[25:32] brother joe i remember you i was
[25:33] thinking when when i heard that you were
[25:35] coming back to our coming to our church
[25:37] rather i remember you from years ago and
[25:40] how i always had a good time hearing
[25:42] your laugh and how joyous you were in
[25:44] the lord yes and i heard that brother
[25:45] joe was coming i said my we're going to
[25:47] have a good time
[25:48] brother joe is coming to our church to
[25:50] see families come we're going to have a
[25:51] good time
[25:53] and we have brothers like our brother
[25:54] tony and the ones that have come
[25:56] alongside us and
[25:58] what a privilege
[26:00] what i don't know any other word for it
[26:03] besides grace
[26:06] there'd be nothing i could do to commend
[26:08] myself to your favor saints of god
[26:13] i i think of when i was
[26:15] a boy in school they had the
[26:18] the boys create a
[26:20] it was i'd say was a click but it was
[26:22] really more of a cast system you had
[26:24] the kings and the dukes and the lords
[26:26] and then you had the slave
[26:29] and
[26:30] i got nominated for the john
[26:35] wasn't the highest place in the totem
[26:37] pole i i remember you know just not feel
[26:41] like i had a friend in the world
[26:44] and i hear about brother branham talking
[26:46] on the tape so many times how he he felt
[26:48] the same way and my family name may have
[26:50] not been outcasted the city but when he
[26:52] he talks about how he's got friends all
[26:55] over the world now
[26:57] i think
[26:58] me too
[27:00] i can go anywhere
[27:02] and find friends
[27:04] and i'm not talking just shallow
[27:06] friendships
[27:07] we've got a basis for fellowship i may
[27:09] not even know them but you give me a
[27:11] couple hours and and let down let down
[27:14] our hair a little bit enough to walk
[27:16] over each other's complexes and let down
[27:18] our walls and connect with one another's
[27:20] spirits that resides within us oh my
[27:23] we're best friends
[27:26] and i can remember those relationships
[27:28] like it was yesterday just just give me
[27:29] a little contact with them
[27:32] you ever made contact with a believer
[27:35] i mean you ever really make contact with
[27:37] a believer
[27:38] i'm not talking to somebody you knew
[27:40] before but you just come in
[27:42] and there's that connection it's like
[27:44] sparks fly
[27:46] and you can walk away and say that was a
[27:48] real believer they really had the holy
[27:49] ghost there was something i connected
[27:51] with
[27:52] that's god's grace to us that we have
[27:54] that kind of fellowship
[27:56] and i'm just here to preach let's not
[27:58] take that lightly
[28:00] and that as there is an approach to god
[28:04] what is our approach to god it doesn't
[28:07] just end off with
[28:09] you know i i i believe that god saved me
[28:12] and i'm going to accept his one-time
[28:14] redemption and then we walk away
[28:17] no there there's a continual approach to
[28:19] god
[28:20] not for offering sacrifices of blood
[28:23] anymore but offering sacrifice of
[28:25] thanksgiving and worship and fellowship
[28:27] and and and coming boldly before the
[28:30] throne of what of grace
[28:32] no longer a throne of judgment to
[28:34] ourselves because we've passed from
[28:35] death into life but it's now a throne of
[28:38] grace and favor that we enjoy
[28:42] when we approach god we should approach
[28:45] him with confidence in our hearts that i
[28:47] am a born-again believer
[28:49] i am his son i i am his daughter
[28:53] not not by his not by our doing like we
[28:56] talked about but by his doing
[28:59] that i am accepted as the scripture says
[29:01] amongst the beloved
[29:03] that he's accepted me
[29:05] not just that i accepted him
[29:08] but he accepted me in the first place
[29:11] you talk about when when you let that
[29:13] revelation really drop down into your
[29:15] heart
[29:16] that it's no longer about me trying to
[29:18] be a good enough person to be god's
[29:20] friend
[29:22] i remember that i remember trying to be
[29:24] a good enough person to be somebody's
[29:26] friend you know
[29:28] brush myself up make sure everything's
[29:30] straight
[29:31] no wrinkles in my clothes and make sure
[29:32] i was cool enough to be somebody's
[29:34] friend
[29:35] that's not the relationship we have with
[29:36] god
[29:38] and neither should it be the
[29:39] relationship that we have with one
[29:41] another
[29:43] we do not just like we don't approach
[29:45] god through
[29:47] we don't approach his fellowship
[29:49] the way the world approaches fellowship
[29:52] we approach his fellowship first on the
[29:54] basis of blood yes
[29:57] that's good the basis that we are now
[29:59] family yes
[30:01] that that i'm not ju he's not just my
[30:04] god but he's my father
[30:07] that i'm his son that i'm his daughter
[30:09] that that i've i've got i've got his
[30:12] grace shining upon me
[30:15] i was i was telling brandon how the
[30:17] other day
[30:18] a little girl ran up and uh and and
[30:21] smacked my pregnant wife right in the
[30:22] face
[30:24] and uh
[30:25] you think that sounds terrible
[30:27] and what did you do brother josiah well
[30:30] here's the thing is
[30:32] i would have done something terrible i
[30:33] suppose and
[30:34] never seen that girl again but
[30:36] she was my daughter
[30:41] was there still judgment yeah there was
[30:43] still judgment
[30:45] but she's right back there we we smiled
[30:47] at her just the other day and we were
[30:49] playing with her on the floor and our
[30:50] fellowship is beautiful and we love her
[30:52] and and she loves us and and there's
[30:54] happy fellowship once again after that
[30:55] little tall mall
[30:57] what was the difference it was unmerited
[30:59] favor she did not do anything to become
[31:02] my daughter
[31:04] but yet
[31:05] it's still there
[31:07] the difference between what would have
[31:09] happened and what did happen was purely
[31:12] dictated by our relationship
[31:15] that we were kind to one another
[31:18] and that's the confidence that we have
[31:20] towards god
[31:22] so
[31:23] i just want to put it to the church
[31:24] tonight
[31:27] what confidence then do we have towards
[31:29] one another
[31:31] when you approach your brother or sister
[31:33] in christ
[31:34] you say you know
[31:36] this person's just come to church here
[31:38] recently i i'd like to get to know them
[31:41] what is the first thing that comes
[31:42] across our minds
[31:44] let's not make it be about what their
[31:46] hobbies are or you know does do they
[31:49] have the same personality as i do or
[31:51] are we kind of similar in our taste in
[31:53] things
[31:56] you know it's god's let's remember that
[31:58] it's god's grace to us that every single
[32:00] oddball of this church
[32:02] is our brother and sister
[32:05] i'd rather take the oddest one among you
[32:08] and be friends with you than any
[32:10] superstar in the world
[32:14] i'd i'd rather fellowship down here in
[32:16] the ditches with the poor folk than be
[32:19] with the celebrities of the world
[32:22] doesn't matter that it brings me more
[32:23] prestige to be with them doesn't matter
[32:25] they might be more interesting and my
[32:27] maybe more well traveled and and they
[32:29] they know more things about this world
[32:31] they've got more experience just to
[32:32] share
[32:33] i don't care about that
[32:36] all
[32:37] you let me hear about your experience in
[32:39] christ for an afternoon
[32:41] you let me just sit down and hear about
[32:43] your testimony and that beats any kind
[32:46] of story the greatest storyteller
[32:48] celebrity could tell me
[32:50] i just want to have fellowship with
[32:52] god's people
[32:54] i'll tell you what that's that's the
[32:55] greatest friendship that i could have
[32:59] that we we it's not bonded together by
[33:02] hobby or interest but it's bounded
[33:04] together by the basis the word that's
[33:06] what we fellowship around
[33:07] that we can start with that as our
[33:09] center and as we as we rotate around
[33:11] that word together we might find out
[33:13] that we have some other interest and
[33:14] pick that up along the way and say oh
[33:16] you like that too i do too
[33:18] next time next time we want to talk
[33:20] about the lord let's go out to that
[33:21] restaurant to eat since we both like the
[33:23] cane same kind of food
[33:25] next time we next time we get together
[33:27] let's go ahead and get on a boat
[33:28] together but what are you doing on the
[33:29] boat
[33:31] let's and let's not forget our moorings
[33:33] let's not forget what our basis of
[33:35] fellowship is
[33:37] that in all the busyness of life and all
[33:39] the activities that we have together and
[33:40] all the fellowship we have out in the
[33:42] fellowship hall and all the coffee that
[33:44] we can drink and all the donuts we can
[33:46] eat together that we don't forget that
[33:48] it's not the donuts that are the basis
[33:50] of our fellowship
[33:51] because if that happens then you'll go
[33:53] right back to the best people to eat
[33:55] donuts with you'll go right back to the
[33:57] best people to drink your coffee with
[33:59] the people that have the best fellow
[34:01] coffee fellowship and the best donut
[34:04] conversation but that's not what we're
[34:06] here for
[34:07] that's not what draw you that's not what
[34:09] drew me let's not forget what drew us it
[34:12] was god that drew us and there's a
[34:15] deposit of god inside every one of us
[34:18] and my challenge to you this evening is
[34:20] let's go find it
[34:21] let's go find the deposit of god in each
[34:24] one of us
[34:25] and you might see well i i just don't
[34:28] really like being around people you
[34:29] don't understand brother josiah i just
[34:31] like to be around
[34:33] my people
[34:35] and your people might be your friends it
[34:37] might be your family it might be just
[34:40] you
[34:42] but
[34:43] i just i'm just here to remind you
[34:46] just
[34:47] take a pause and look around
[34:50] these are your people
[34:52] [Music]
[34:54] like brother paul says you didn't vote
[34:56] me in and you can't kick me out
[34:59] and what's more besides is you're stuck
[35:01] with me not here in church but for all
[35:03] eternity
[35:05] so how about we just settle down let our
[35:07] hair down for a little bit and get used
[35:09] to each other at literal life
[35:11] sure there's some new faces and i'll be
[35:14] honest tonight i'm kind of intimidated
[35:16] too
[35:17] when i'm
[35:18] when i get knocked off my perch of being
[35:20] you know knowing every single name in
[35:22] the church because i've been going here
[35:24] since i was 12 years old and and new
[35:26] people come along and i can't quite
[35:29] place their names
[35:30] anymore
[35:31] there's two options that i have towards
[35:34] me and there's a carnal side and there's
[35:35] there's a better side the carnal side is
[35:38] this church is getting too big
[35:42] that this is intimidating i'm just going
[35:44] to retreat back to my people
[35:47] or i can say praise god there's another
[35:49] person here there's another bride member
[35:52] of jesus christ they've got another
[35:54] deposit of god they've got another
[35:55] testimony
[35:56] how about i don't wait for it to come
[35:59] out on brother paul and brother kyle's
[36:01] videotape how about i invite them out to
[36:03] coffee myself and say tell me what is
[36:06] your testimony i want to know it i want
[36:08] to hear what god's done for you in life
[36:10] because you know what there's something
[36:11] that that does for me when i hear that
[36:15] oh hallelujah
[36:18] i i wonder if sometimes the reason where
[36:20] we feel so different from one another is
[36:22] because we don't take the time to really
[36:24] cross over and connect with
[36:26] each other's spirits
[36:29] they kind of wave and we kind of wave
[36:31] and they offer a funny smile so we just
[36:34] kind of figure they're kind of funny and
[36:36] we walk on
[36:38] well that's not the way to do it
[36:42] or or or they say something to you and
[36:44] it seems a little bit i don't know a
[36:46] little bit crude and you say well
[36:48] they're just kind of mean people i'll
[36:50] just write them off i i got plenty of
[36:53] people and literally i have to
[36:54] fellowship with i i i don't need to
[36:56] venture out
[37:00] but that's your brother
[37:03] that's your sister there's there's no
[37:04] black sheep in god's family
[37:09] all god's family is washed white by the
[37:11] red of god's blood
[37:14] there's nobody that we disassociate
[37:16] ourselves with in god's family
[37:18] oh now now we're getting down to the
[37:20] rubber meets the rollerblade paul
[37:22] i'll tell you what i'm back here and the
[37:24] lord's the lord's trying my heart as i'm
[37:27] saying these things
[37:29] because there is
[37:31] there is little funny feelings aren't
[37:33] there
[37:34] there are little complexes
[37:37] but how about we just challenge
[37:39] ourselves
[37:40] to get past it all
[37:43] so just kind of
[37:45] let the walls down a little bit and give
[37:47] people a chance try to try to connect to
[37:50] their spirit and invite them over for
[37:51] dinner
[37:54] invite them out for coffee
[37:59] well you say well i i have i'm busy i've
[38:01] got i've got my family and i've got god
[38:06] and i've got my my screen time
[38:11] you know i was just thinking the other
[38:13] week how
[38:14] it's amazing
[38:15] that as technology advances you know
[38:18] here you had back in the 50s you had the
[38:20] washer and you had the dryer that came
[38:22] out in the dishwashing machine
[38:24] and
[38:25] should have freed up everybody's time
[38:27] but
[38:28] then comes along the television
[38:31] tree of knowledge of good and evil every
[38:32] time that man creates a device to free
[38:34] himself up he finds another device to
[38:37] bind himself back down again
[38:39] we come out with computers that make our
[38:42] our our work week so much shorter and we
[38:44] can be so much more productive as a
[38:45] workforce and hardly want to work more
[38:48] than 40 hours a week and after that we
[38:50] start thinking we're overdoing it
[38:53] but along with that advancement comes
[38:55] the phone
[38:57] and we're bound back by our own devices
[38:59] again
[39:03] how about we just
[39:04] set that aside and find some real
[39:06] fellowship
[39:08] not proctored through social media
[39:11] but proctored by the blood of jesus
[39:13] christ
[39:16] and while we're at it why don't we just
[39:18] go ahead and say be honest with the lord
[39:20] and say the reasons why we don't feel
[39:23] like fellowshipping
[39:24] maybe you've got some funny feelings in
[39:26] there somewhere some some complexes from
[39:29] a long time ago
[39:31] you know and in our ranks there's a lot
[39:33] of history
[39:34] whether it's a little church or
[39:36] maybe you came in from one church to
[39:38] literal life and somebody else came in
[39:40] from another church and he said i never
[39:42] thought i'd see you in the same church
[39:45] but here we are
[39:46] i'm just going to say all the things the
[39:47] pastor can't say
[39:50] he he's smiling because he he's got a
[39:52] clear conscience he didn't tell me to
[39:54] say this
[39:57] but isn't it true
[40:01] but how about we just let all the
[40:02] history fall away
[40:04] because you know you know what you know
[40:06] what your history has to do with with
[40:07] eternity
[40:09] you measure all the history and all the
[40:11] preconditions and all you know they did
[40:13] this and
[40:14] their pastor did this all those years
[40:15] ago and their family did this and i
[40:17] always got this kind of impression or
[40:19] this kind of feeling from them and i
[40:20] believe that's the discernment of the
[40:22] lord you really think so
[40:26] and the scale of eternity i think the
[40:27] little dot of your experience to date
[40:30] with people is going to be washed away
[40:32] amen
[40:34] so in my opening i pray prayer i prayed
[40:36] lord let a little bit of eternity come
[40:38] down tonight
[40:40] and that's my prayer this still is lord
[40:43] let a little bit of eternity come into
[40:44] our fellowship
[40:46] let ourselves just enter into eternity
[40:48] and start to to draw down the benefits
[40:51] of eternity
[40:53] i don't have to wait till attorney to
[40:54] have fellowship with your friends
[40:56] i don't have to wait until i have until
[40:59] i've got all the time in the world
[41:01] frankly i've i've got more time than i
[41:03] care to admit
[41:04] and it doesn't always go where i want it
[41:06] to go
[41:08] but what better place to invest it in
[41:10] than back into god's people
[41:14] if you don't know what to do with your
[41:16] time why don't you try picking up that
[41:18] phone
[41:19] and using the old dialing pad
[41:21] remember how to do that
[41:24] i'm not not not this i'm talking with
[41:26] the
[41:27] index finger
[41:31] dialing numbers calling people if you
[41:33] can't meet them for lunch because you're
[41:35] a busy mom how about you you talk to
[41:37] them on the phone
[41:39] talk you know just say hey how are you
[41:41] doing
[41:42] and don't have to you're not committing
[41:43] your whole day to them
[41:45] they they're not gonna they're you can
[41:48] say goodbye when you don't when your
[41:49] kids are crying you can hang up the
[41:52] phone once they're not gonna throw a
[41:53] chain through that phone and keep you
[41:55] there for the rest of the day
[41:57] you can go ahead and call somebody for
[41:58] five minutes and just let them know hey
[42:00] brother brandon i was thinking about you
[42:02] yeah i love those phone calls brother
[42:04] just i was thinking about you praying
[42:05] for you today
[42:07] how you doing
[42:09] hey brother i'm and you can you know
[42:11] what this is this is one on one tonight
[42:13] this is just practical
[42:15] you know when you call them you can say
[42:16] hey i was on the road between here and
[42:19] here and i had five minutes and you just
[42:21] came to mind
[42:22] now they know you only got five minutes
[42:27] so when you say goodbye in five minutes
[42:29] they understand
[42:31] they're not going to be offended
[42:36] i'm just going to let i'm just going to
[42:38] let that one lay
[42:39] but you try it this week you try out
[42:41] somebody
[42:42] try is somebody that you don't normally
[42:44] call you know
[42:45] don't be calling your mama this week and
[42:47] say i did the homework assignment
[42:52] very good you know what i i think if
[42:55] we'll take the word of the lord this
[42:56] evening
[42:57] we'll find a little little life church
[42:59] that
[43:01] is that much more closer right and i'm
[43:03] not saying that i i'm seeing some kind
[43:05] of problems developing i'm just saying
[43:08] i see a church that can keep on growing
[43:09] in love
[43:11] you know literal life church was called
[43:13] it used to be called the lovey-dovey
[43:15] church
[43:17] uh for good reason you walked in the
[43:19] door and if you were a newcomer lord
[43:21] help you
[43:23] you had it was like it was like bees to
[43:26] honey man
[43:29] now
[43:30] when someone walks the door
[43:32] are you one of the bees going to the
[43:33] honey
[43:34] that's good
[43:35] do you do you recognize the honey in
[43:37] that brother's sister whether they're
[43:41] looking like a tired christian or not do
[43:43] you recognize there might be honey
[43:44] somewhere in there
[43:46] or have we gotten so big
[43:49] i told you i was just gonna say
[43:50] everything the pastor wanted to say have
[43:52] we gotten so big
[43:54] that we figure well somebody else to do
[43:56] that
[43:57] brother brandon will get him he's the
[43:59] assistant minister pastor anyhow
[44:01] think about it but tony he's always
[44:03] greeting somebody he'll get him
[44:06] and when they decide to come to our
[44:08] church are you like oh no
[44:10] that's another family i've got to
[44:11] remember the names of
[44:15] or are you checking your family calendar
[44:17] and saying when can we get them over
[44:20] when when can we have fellowship with
[44:21] them
[44:23] because i'll tell you
[44:25] since moving down this way which is the
[44:27] reason why we moved down is to have more
[44:29] fellowship
[44:30] i haven't gotten as much fellowship as
[44:32] i'd like to
[44:33] but the few times we've been able to
[44:34] have families over brother joe you know
[44:37] it's
[44:38] seeing seeing your kids play together
[44:40] sitting around and sharing each other's
[44:42] testimonies and even talking about what
[44:44] you're going through with work and how
[44:46] you're how you're dealing with
[44:48] this life
[44:50] it's such
[44:51] i'll i'll tell you
[44:53] the scripture's so right when it says
[44:55] that the
[44:57] uh the face of a friend maketh his
[44:59] accountants to shine
[45:01] that as iron sharpeneth iron
[45:03] so does
[45:04] does a man sharpeneth his friend that's
[45:06] right
[45:07] we sometimes talk about that you know
[45:08] being you know
[45:11] two sharp people going back at it but
[45:12] that's not what the scripture says it
[45:14] literally means that just by
[45:16] fellowshipping together we're made
[45:17] better
[45:19] i
[45:20] after this weekend with my good friend
[45:22] brother steven cressel i feel like i
[45:24] don't get enough of that
[45:26] and i couldn't get away from it as i was
[45:29] just preparing the service because i
[45:31] figure if
[45:32] if i'm going through something maybe
[45:34] maybe somebody else in church here could
[45:36] also use
[45:37] what the lord's doing with me on
[45:39] i want more fellowship
[45:41] you know what i i don't just think about
[45:43] it for myself
[45:45] i want a projective vision of fellowship
[45:48] to my family
[45:50] that my family doesn't grow up insulated
[45:53] by their own family members by the
[45:55] people that we're close to and that we
[45:58] always fellowship with and we're
[46:00] comfortable with
[46:01] i want them to learn how to have the
[46:03] ministration of fellowship
[46:06] that we can invite people out
[46:09] and be ministered to them
[46:11] be ministered or be ministered by them
[46:14] and be ministered back to them right
[46:16] that that our fellowship makes us better
[46:21] and you don't get that with
[46:22] fellowshipping with the same people
[46:24] every single time
[46:26] it's just how it works
[46:28] and i'm not saying forsake all your your
[46:30] good friends i'm just saying
[46:33] don't forget your other brothers and
[46:34] sisters in christ
[46:38] and i might also say this
[46:40] paul says let there be no ism or schism
[46:42] in the body
[46:44] let there be no division amongst us
[46:47] he said about the uncomely members of
[46:49] the body he says look
[46:51] in the natural we take it and we adorn
[46:54] our uncoming members with that much
[46:55] greater honor
[46:58] you don't see my you don't see my piggly
[47:00] wigglys this evening
[47:02] they're shot and beautiful
[47:04] cowhide
[47:05] because i adorn them with that much more
[47:07] honor
[47:09] if there's somebody that doesn't seem
[47:11] honorable to you
[47:14] maybe that's god saying
[47:16] why don't you just go ahead and adorn
[47:18] them with a little bit of honor
[47:20] take them out to eat and you pay for the
[47:21] meal
[47:24] it don't have to be a big meal it can be
[47:25] coffee
[47:27] that's what i did when i was a college
[47:28] kid and couldn't afford much if i wanted
[47:30] to look like a high roller
[47:33] i took my i took you out to coffee i
[47:35] took my own pasta out to coffee felt
[47:37] pretty good paying for my pastor's
[47:38] coffee
[47:39] didn't have much but i bought his coffee
[47:44] i'm not asking you to over commit
[47:46] i'm just asking you to commit
[47:49] commit to your brothers and sisters
[47:51] and if there's a division commit to
[47:53] bridging that division
[47:55] commit to finding a way over
[47:58] your perceived complexes they have that
[48:01] you think they have towards you because
[48:03] they smile that funny way every time or
[48:06] they said this about
[48:09] i i better be careful i might get too
[48:11] close but
[48:12] they said this or that or you know they
[48:14] said something to hurt your feelings or
[48:17] stomped on your personal taste or
[48:18] something you figure well
[48:20] they knew that i liked that and they
[48:22] said they didn't like that so therefore
[48:24] they don't like me
[48:28] and you can remember that for all of
[48:29] your days
[48:31] that they knew that i liked that
[48:34] and they said they didn't like that
[48:37] so they don't like me
[48:40] this is how these funny feelings develop
[48:42] they always seem so
[48:44] aloof whenever i greet them
[48:47] it might just be that they're taller
[48:49] than you
[48:51] or it might just be that they happen to
[48:54] have a different
[48:56] way they'd like to stand apart from you
[48:58] you like to stand up right here and talk
[49:00] to people and they they stand back here
[49:02] and talk with a proper distance
[49:06] and you're going to let satan come in
[49:11] it sounds silly but sometimes when we
[49:14] really start to analyze why we feel the
[49:15] funny things that we feel about people
[49:18] it comes down to silly things like that
[49:22] i don't know what your silly thing is
[49:23] but i know i still got a lot of them
[49:26] and one thing is that
[49:27] i recognize this evening that my
[49:30] fellowship with you brothers and sisters
[49:32] is god's grace to me
[49:35] and i want to enjoy it
[49:38] amen
[49:40] let's go ahead and have the musicians
[49:41] come if we would
[49:46] i don't know if we have yet we have a
[49:47] song for that one gideon or not grace
[49:49] grace god's grace or
[49:51] you're the song leader we all know that
[49:53] i'm not
[49:58] let's go ahead and stand
[50:03] [Applause]
[50:09] i can only hope that the word has
[50:11] challenged you like it has me this week
[50:15] i can only hope that
[50:17] you desire the same thing for your
[50:19] family that i desire for mine
[50:21] [Music]
[50:23] john said that there there's there's
[50:25] there's no greater joy that i have
[50:28] but to see
[50:30] my children
[50:31] [Music]
[50:33] enjoying the grace of god i
[50:35] i'm paraphrasing the scripture there but
[50:38] i can say about my children there's no
[50:40] greater joy that i could have
[50:42] than to see them raise up in this church
[50:45] to form friendships with this church
[50:47] to form bonds with
[50:49] each young person here
[50:50] [Music]
[50:51] and if i think about that for my own
[50:53] children
[50:55] doesn't it start from the head and go
[50:56] down to the toes
[50:59] if i want my my children to have good
[51:01] godly friends in this church
[51:05] am i engendering those relationships
[51:08] at the top
[51:09] am i just letting the water stay
[51:11] stagnant and say you know what
[51:13] i'm good
[51:14] the people that i know i like their kids
[51:16] and we're just going to kind of stay in
[51:18] our bubble in little life
[51:20] as little life grows and grows we're
[51:22] going to stay in the same bubble
[51:24] as god adds more to the church daily
[51:28] i'm not going to let him add to my
[51:29] bubble
[51:30] because i'm comfortable with my bubble
[51:33] or could it be that maybe as god's
[51:35] adding more and more to the church here
[51:37] at literal life
[51:39] god's willing to add something more to
[51:40] your bubble
[51:42] but maybe some of the people that have
[51:44] been coming through these doors have
[51:46] something to give you
[51:49] and maybe if you would believe it about
[51:51] yourself
[51:52] you have something to give them
[51:54] [Music]
[51:55] and neither is less important than the
[51:57] other
[51:58] for we're called to minister
[52:00] and be ministered to amen
[52:02] let's pray
[52:06] dear lord we just come before you father
[52:09] [Music]
[52:10] lord i'm so grateful
[52:14] [Music]
[52:19] lord i'm so grateful to have friends
[52:20] like i do lord
[52:23] it
[52:24] [Music]
[52:26] it boggles my mind
[52:28] that i could say that i'm the friend of
[52:30] god
[52:31] but to know that your grace doesn't stop
[52:33] there
[52:35] to know that
[52:37] if ever i have a hard time getting into
[52:40] your presence
[52:43] i could just
[52:44] call a friend up on the phone
[52:47] who has the same presence of god
[52:50] resident within them
[52:52] and as we talk about the word within a
[52:54] few minutes
[52:55] i could find myself in your presence
[53:00] together with my friend
[53:02] that we could raise up in the heavenly
[53:03] places together
[53:06] oh my
[53:08] lord i pray that
[53:10] that would be
[53:11] the picture of your church lord that
[53:12] would be the picture of liberal life
[53:15] that as we
[53:16] start this new age together lord where i
[53:19] shouldn't say start it we're in the
[53:20] thick of it
[53:21] these church doors and this new building
[53:23] have been opened lord and many new
[53:25] families have been at the church it
[53:27] seems like daily
[53:29] but lord i pray that would just mean
[53:30] many new friends for each and every one
[53:32] of us
[53:34] that we could connect to more sons than
[53:36] daughters of god
[53:38] lord if there's anyone tonight that
[53:39] would have a complex
[53:42] or some barrier
[53:44] something that would keep them from that
[53:45] lord
[53:46] i pray that they would see tonight that
[53:50] the price of friendship has already been
[53:52] paid for
[53:55] that just as there's no case against
[53:57] them
[53:58] with you
[53:59] there's no case against them
[54:03] as it pertains to them and a brother or
[54:05] sister in this church
[54:07] may they have faith in that lord
[54:10] the same faith that they approach you
[54:12] with
[54:13] a faith built upon relationship by blood
[54:17] may they approach the others in this
[54:19] church
[54:20] that same faith
[54:22] relationship by blood until every
[54:25] complex is torn down
[54:28] until every funny feeling is swept aside
[54:31] for the silliness that it is
[54:34] and the real heart of the believer
[54:36] connects one to another
[54:38] and then may the sparks fly lord
[54:41] i pray that something i've said has
[54:43] engendered the faith of your people one
[54:46] towards another lord
[54:51] because engendering faith one towards
[54:53] another it's a greater faith in you lord
[54:57] that what you've done
[54:58] by your grace
[55:01] is powerful enough to break down every
[55:04] stronghold
[55:05] not just between us and you between us
[55:08] and one another
[55:09] so let it be tonight we pray in jesus
[55:12] christ's name
[55:14] amen
