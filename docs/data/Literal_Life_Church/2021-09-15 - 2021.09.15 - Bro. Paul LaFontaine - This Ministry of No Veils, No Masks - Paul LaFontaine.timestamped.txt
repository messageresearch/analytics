[0:00] be great we spend that together and i
[0:02] can't remember if that's all the
[0:03] announcements but brandon you can alert
[0:04] me later if i missed one of them i
[0:06] believe that's it for this weekend
[0:08] there's a youth meeting at my house
[0:09] friday night and we'll be teaching some
[0:11] more on friday night so remember that at
[0:13] seven to ten
[0:14] seven to ten o'clock we cut it off at
[0:16] ten i always emphasize that cut-off
[0:18] point
[0:19] i don't know why but i do
[0:22] amen i'm going to read tonight from
[0:24] second corinthians chapter four and
[0:26] we're going to study this chapter
[0:28] together this wednesday uh chapter three
[0:30] and chapter four and just break it down
[0:32] a little bit and so we'll just read a
[0:34] couple verses here to jump in second
[0:36] corinthians four and verse one
[0:38] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[0:41] seeing we have this ministry and you
[0:44] would have to look at the chapter four
[0:46] the chapter before
[0:48] to see what type of ministry that paul's
[0:50] talking about because he's been given a
[0:51] specific type of ministry
[0:54] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[0:56] we have
[0:58] as we have received mercy we faint not
[1:00] but have renounced the hidden things of
[1:03] dishonesty
[1:05] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[1:08] the word of god deceitfully but by
[1:11] manifestation of the truth commending
[1:13] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[1:17] the sight of god so that's the nature of
[1:19] the minis this ministry is to renounce
[1:21] the things of dishonesty not walk in
[1:23] craftiness
[1:24] not handling the word deceitfully
[1:27] but by manifestation of truth commending
[1:30] ourselves proving ourselves to every
[1:32] man's conscience and notice in the sight
[1:34] of god there's really nothing hidden in
[1:36] the sight of god so he said that's why
[1:39] i'm open with minister i'm not holding
[1:40] anything back and we expose thing when
[1:43] you talk about renouncing the hidden
[1:45] things of design you're exposing things
[1:47] by truth and you're doing that and
[1:49] you're you're doing that all in the
[1:50] sight of god because you can't hide
[1:52] anything from him this is the type of
[1:53] ministry paul had and then he says but
[1:56] if our gospel be hid it is hid to them
[1:59] that are lost and we'll just stop it
[2:01] right there
[2:02] precious lord we thank you for your
[2:04] grace we thank you for your protection
[2:06] lord
[2:07] around this house that you've given us
[2:10] the storm that came last night lord i
[2:11] was i just stood amazed to see your
[2:14] protection over it lord and we're
[2:15] thankful you're doing so many mighty
[2:17] things lord and i know the enemy is
[2:20] always around trying to attack and
[2:22] strike not just the building but strike
[2:24] our lives and just discourage us lord
[2:27] but we will not be discouraged tonight
[2:29] and we will stand
[2:31] uh and
[2:32] turn up our praise and drown out our
[2:34] doubts and lord jesus you've given us
[2:37] something lord of this eternal life and
[2:39] this holy ghost that something beyond
[2:41] anything the devil can combat against or
[2:44] come against it's greater than anything
[2:46] in this world
[2:47] lord jesus i pray that you'll minister
[2:50] tonight to your congregation and to the
[2:52] people whether they're here online i
[2:54] pray the word would go forth and you
[2:56] help me to set aside lord my own
[2:59] feelings and my own ways lord until you
[3:01] can just get inside each person's heart
[3:04] lord and you guide them and direct them
[3:06] as a great shepherd we love you father
[3:08] forgive us if we've done anything to
[3:10] displease you or grieve you lord just
[3:13] cleanse it by your blood tonight and may
[3:15] we stand before you pure by your blood
[3:17] and worship you and now we worship you
[3:20] as we listen to the word of god we just
[3:21] commit it to you in jesus name we ask it
[3:25] amen
[3:26] praise the lord god bless you may be
[3:27] seated tonight
[3:29] and you remember on sunday when i
[3:31] mentioned the the security person in the
[3:33] airport
[3:34] that
[3:35] told me to pull down
[3:38] my mask so he could see who i was and
[3:41] that was my title of the sermon sunday
[3:43] talk a little bit about that and so i
[3:46] thought it was interesting that it just
[3:48] dawned on me that that's what they do to
[3:50] be able to see who my identity is and
[3:53] who i really am
[3:55] and that the the truth that identity
[3:58] identity is mostly revealed in the face
[4:02] uh in the expression
[4:05] in the conversation
[4:07] and it's looked at in the face that's
[4:09] most of where the identity would be
[4:11] revealed is in the face the expression
[4:13] the conversation being able to look
[4:16] someone
[4:17] in their eye can tell a lot you can tell
[4:20] a lot by looking in someone's eyes you
[4:22] can tell a lot by looking in someone's
[4:24] face and how they talk and their
[4:26] expressions and you can tell negative or
[4:28] positive you can say you can see so much
[4:32] and not only by a person's countenance
[4:34] but also the things that come out of
[4:35] their mouth is a revealing of their
[4:38] identity what they believe what they
[4:40] stand for what they talk about mostly
[4:42] can you say ma'am
[4:44] so this is very and this truth of
[4:47] this truth of identity being revealed in
[4:51] the countenance is the reason i'm going
[4:53] back to it is it's in the scripture it's
[4:55] very much a truth that's tied to
[4:57] scripture
[4:58] not only for our lord jesus christ but
[5:01] for ourselves as well and we will see
[5:03] that tonight as we study the word
[5:04] together that this truth of unmasking
[5:07] and taking the veil off in the chapter
[5:09] you find taking the veil off and
[5:10] unmasking this is what jesus christ
[5:12] wants to do first of all for himself he
[5:15] doesn't want to wear a master hide
[5:17] anything from you he wants to reveal
[5:19] himself to you he wants to you to look
[5:22] into his face spiritually as it were and
[5:25] when we look into his face then we are
[5:27] changed can you say amen
[5:29] but it is not only the lord that is part
[5:31] of this truth of unmasking but it's us
[5:34] as well and we're going to find that out
[5:35] tonight because when we unmask and when
[5:38] we tear all the walls down and when we
[5:40] are open uh and have an open face before
[5:44] the lord then we know that uh something
[5:46] can change in our lives as well so a
[5:49] person and a person who is covering
[5:52] their face is uh usually hiding
[5:54] something be like a robber when he goes
[5:57] and robs the bank they usually wear the
[5:59] the thing around their face because
[6:01] either the security cameras are going to
[6:02] catch them or somebody across the teller
[6:05] will see them and so now they could have
[6:08] all their cl their clothes but they
[6:09] cover their face because they want to
[6:11] cover their identity because they're
[6:13] they're hiding themselves
[6:15] so you know i know this is very simple
[6:17] but i'm just going to be simple tonight
[6:19] that's the principle we have behind this
[6:21] when you talk about a mask and hiding
[6:23] the face it's usually because somebody's
[6:27] hiding something
[6:29] if somebody has a blemish or they had a
[6:31] surgery or something some you know too
[6:33] many pimples sometimes or something
[6:36] sometimes you'll see somebody hiding
[6:38] their face or covering their face and
[6:40] they have a maybe a severe wound on
[6:42] their face and so that's not a bad
[6:44] reason they're covering it but they are
[6:46] trying to hide their blemish they're
[6:47] trying to hide their thing i suppose we
[6:50] can get in the whole subject of makeup
[6:52] right now but we'll just leave that
[6:53] alone
[6:55] how that that is also used to hide
[6:58] things
[6:59] well praise the lord but in the
[7:03] principles of the the lord and
[7:05] principles of spiritual principles we
[7:07] find that god does not want us to to
[7:10] hide anything
[7:11] god doesn't want to hide from us
[7:14] he said to the pharisees one day he says
[7:16] he said i've hid these things from the
[7:18] wise and prudent but revealed the numb
[7:19] to babes such as will learn and so now
[7:22] he desires to reveal himself to his sons
[7:25] and daughters of god he does not want to
[7:27] hide himself from his sons and so when
[7:30] we speak of a mass we speak of hiding
[7:32] something so we just want to settle down
[7:34] tonight and look a little bit about
[7:36] these uh passages here in second
[7:39] readings i try to keep from preaching
[7:41] and just try to talk about them a little
[7:42] bit because i want us to just be able to
[7:44] understand sometimes on a sunday morning
[7:47] not able to step back into the scripture
[7:49] and just break them down each scripture
[7:50] and i'd like to do that but we're
[7:53] understanding through this text how
[7:55] important this is
[7:57] and paul says seeing we have this type
[7:59] of ministry let's just talk about that a
[8:01] minute this type of ministry we have
[8:03] this ministry uh where in this ministry
[8:06] that he had is the same ministry of the
[8:08] last days god's sending a prophet god's
[8:11] speaking through a prophet and when the
[8:14] word of the lord comes in that way we
[8:16] know the bible says that the word is a
[8:18] discerner of the thoughts and the
[8:20] intents of the heart in other words
[8:22] again you can't hide anything he doesn't
[8:24] want you hiding anything
[8:26] and so when this ministry comes it's not
[8:28] time for hiding it's time for being open
[8:32] when this ministry comes it's time for a
[8:34] revealing it's time it's not try time to
[8:37] pretend it's not time to hide can you
[8:39] say amen but it's time to for things to
[8:42] be revealed including about yourself and
[8:44] there's nothing that can be hidden that
[8:46] god doesn't know already but sometimes
[8:49] god needs you to be honest and open
[8:52] and not hide anything from him or maybe
[8:54] even a brother or sister that you can
[8:56] confide in the bible says to confront
[8:58] one another come to one another if you
[9:00] be overtaken in a fault or go to another
[9:03] brother but it says confess our faults
[9:05] one to another why in the world would
[9:06] paul teach us to confess our faults and
[9:09] our weaknesses to one another it's about
[9:12] unmasking
[9:14] it's about not hiding it's about
[9:16] exposing the enemy
[9:18] it's about being accountable to another
[9:20] brother and saying listen i'm going to
[9:21] tell about this because i want you to
[9:23] pray with me about this i'm not going to
[9:24] hide anything and i find when the more
[9:27] people hold stuff and hide it on the
[9:28] inside the devil uses that to keep you
[9:31] bound on the inside it's better to share
[9:34] it with the lord it's better to share
[9:36] with someone you have confidence in
[9:38] because you expose the enemy
[9:42] so you know this type of ministry in the
[9:44] last days is under the message of this
[9:46] last days is the same type and and uh so
[9:49] i want to just bring this back so paul
[9:51] says this ministry what kind of ministry
[9:53] is it
[9:54] a new testament minister will have an
[9:56] open ministry
[9:58] it's not veiled but it's plain
[10:01] it's not just the letter but it's the
[10:03] spirit
[10:04] in the chapter before he says the letter
[10:06] killeth the spirit giveth life what type
[10:08] of ministry in this is this it's not a
[10:10] veiled ministry it's plain it's not a
[10:13] letter but it's the spirit
[10:15] it's not just a religion but actually
[10:18] it's the glory and the power of god in
[10:20] it
[10:22] because it's an open ministry
[10:24] then paul says i preach this way because
[10:27] it's an open ministry i preach this way
[10:29] verse 2 i have renounced the things of
[10:31] dishonesty not walking craftiness can i
[10:34] read it in the amplified but we have
[10:36] renounced the disgraceful things hidden
[10:39] because of shame not walking in trickery
[10:43] or adulterating the word of god but by
[10:46] stating the truth openly and plainly we
[10:50] commend ourselves to every man's
[10:51] conscience in the sight of god so we
[10:54] renounce the disgraceful things that are
[10:56] hidden
[10:57] not walking in trickery or adultery of
[11:00] the of the word of god one place he says
[11:02] we don't use enticing words of man's
[11:04] wisdom but i come to you in the power
[11:07] can you say man
[11:09] so it's it's man's wisdom is try to
[11:11] entice use trickery with words use the
[11:14] bible and be crafty with it to kind of
[11:16] swindle around paul said i don't have to
[11:18] do any of that i'm just preaching it
[11:20] just like it is and i'm not holding
[11:22] anything back
[11:24] in in chapter 3 and verse 12 he says
[11:26] because of this we use great plainness
[11:29] of speech i'm using plainness of speech
[11:31] i'm not using dark sayings or try to
[11:34] hide something but i'm being very open
[11:36] with you this ministry is an open
[11:38] ministry it's not hiding can you say
[11:40] amen and because it's open it also
[11:43] exposes the enemy that's why he doesn't
[11:46] like this ministry
[11:47] the devil's not done any trouble with
[11:49] religion he has trouble with the
[11:51] ministry of the last days because it's
[11:53] too open
[11:55] exposes people too much
[11:57] exposes demons too much
[12:00] praise the lord
[12:02] i believe i got some good things here
[12:04] that'll wake some of you up here
[12:05] eventually tonight
[12:06] can you say amen
[12:08] so we we speak boldly
[12:11] to speak plainness of speech means we
[12:13] we're speaking boldly and openly why
[12:17] it's this ministry it's not hiding
[12:19] anything it's not holding anything back
[12:21] it's not restricting to save face
[12:25] it's not political it's not saying what
[12:27] people want to hear always
[12:30] this that's not this ministry of the
[12:32] last days saying what people want to
[12:34] hear
[12:35] this
[12:36] if you want that you better find another
[12:38] church and find another place find
[12:40] another message because this ministry
[12:41] doesn't fit if it's something that just
[12:44] is conniving to just try to preach a
[12:46] political thing that's politically
[12:48] correct or preach something that the
[12:50] people just want to hear this but they
[12:51] don't want to hear the rest of it
[12:53] that's not this type of ministry this is
[12:55] great plainness of speech can you say
[12:57] amen
[12:58] this exposes the things of dishonesty
[13:01] and you know sometimes when you listen
[13:04] to some radio preachers not all but some
[13:06] tv and radio preachers it's very obvious
[13:10] if you know your bible that many of
[13:12] these preachers on the radio and tv are
[13:14] completely silent on certain passages in
[13:17] that bible
[13:19] never heard him in all their 30 years of
[13:21] ministry ever bring up certain passages
[13:24] in here and that's really sad because
[13:26] it's just as much a part of the bible as
[13:28] the rest of the bible
[13:30] grace they preach on grace a lot but
[13:32] grace is is a part of the bible but
[13:35] god's judgment is just so much a part of
[13:36] the bible
[13:39] didn't get too many amens hear about
[13:40] that
[13:42] god tells a man and woman to dress
[13:45] different that's just as much a part of
[13:47] this bible
[13:49] interesting we never hear that part it's
[13:51] not politically correct
[13:53] to talk about it
[13:55] so you hear so much but you see him
[13:57] silent completely silent on certain
[14:00] subjects of the bible and so
[14:03] they never go there and yet if they were
[14:05] under paul's ministry if they were
[14:07] listening to paul paul was not bound by
[14:10] money
[14:11] paul was not bound by position
[14:14] paul was not bound by feelings can you
[14:16] say amen
[14:18] paul was not bound by the will of man
[14:21] he wasn't bound by anything
[14:24] he preached plainly it preached the word
[14:26] and it was an openness you take a real
[14:28] holy ghost minister under this last
[14:30] day's ministry and he
[14:32] is not limited to any he's not going to
[14:35] limit himself to any passage in this
[14:37] bible can you say amen he speaks it
[14:40] he blows the trumpet a last-days
[14:42] minister that preaches by the holy ghost
[14:45] is blowing the trumpet loud and not
[14:47] holding anything back
[14:49] thank god for preachers the fifo
[14:52] ministry
[14:53] that will not withhold preaching
[14:55] anything in this bible for politics for
[14:59] feelings of the people thank god that
[15:01] you're under ministries that will preach
[15:03] it like it is
[15:06] not hidden things of dishonesty not
[15:08] using the word of god craftily but just
[15:10] preach it the way it is can you say amen
[15:13] and these ministers blow the trumpet
[15:15] loudly and speak it plainly my wife and
[15:17] i have always said about our dear
[15:19] brother tim pruitt has a wonderful
[15:21] ministry we've been blessed by it
[15:23] through the years but i tell you we
[15:25] always leave his sermons and we say many
[15:27] times that when you leave brother tim
[15:29] pruitt's sermon there's never a doubt
[15:32] never a doubt about where he stands
[15:34] and that's a compliment we're given a
[15:36] compliment there's never one ounce of
[15:37] doubt where he stands and and i think
[15:40] that's something that we need more of
[15:42] today is men who be honest
[15:45] praise the lord he stands on the word of
[15:47] god and leave nothing uncovered and it
[15:49] may even hurt just a little bit
[15:51] sometimes but isn't it better being a
[15:53] little bit hurt down here
[15:57] isn't it better being corrected here
[15:59] than to be corrected on judgment day
[16:01] isn't it better to receive a little
[16:03] chastening from the lord here i would
[16:06] rather hear it in a service can you say
[16:08] amen and let my lord use that minister
[16:10] to correct something here even if it
[16:13] takes the very height off of my back
[16:14] spiritually but i'd rather get it here
[16:16] than get it on judgment day
[16:19] praise the lord for god called mister so
[16:21] so we're we're saying you know to some
[16:23] preachers come on just say it say it the
[16:25] way the word says it and as the word
[16:28] advances along there is less and less
[16:31] hiding as the word becomes more and more
[16:33] perfected to us there's less and less
[16:36] hiding in other words it becomes more
[16:38] and more open all the time when he came
[16:41] down with the book of redemption in
[16:43] revelations 10 it was no longer a closed
[16:46] book it was an open book
[16:48] can you say amen that says something of
[16:51] the type of ministry that it will be
[16:53] that things will no longer be closed but
[16:56] it will be open this bible will no
[16:58] longer be closed to us but the veils
[17:00] will be taken off
[17:03] i'm just preaching to you this is the
[17:04] type of ministry that we're under
[17:07] and uh as the word advances it becomes
[17:09] more and more that way now let's go back
[17:11] to chapter three and just work through
[17:13] it just a little bit
[17:14] chapter three says do we begin again to
[17:16] commend ourselves or need we as some
[17:19] others and i just wanted to say um that
[17:23] paul will get into some things here he
[17:25] says do you we begin again to commend
[17:27] ourselves or need we as some others
[17:29] epistles of commendation to you or let
[17:32] letters of commendation from you
[17:34] ye are our epistle written in our hearts
[17:37] known and read of all men
[17:39] for as much as ye are manifestly
[17:41] declared to the epistle of christ
[17:42] ministered by us
[17:44] written not with ink but with the spirit
[17:47] of the living god not in tables of stone
[17:50] but in fleshly tables of the heart
[17:54] so
[17:55] if you go over to chapter 4
[17:58] hold your place there in chapter three
[18:00] but read here at the very end of this
[18:01] subject and i say it's the end but
[18:03] it's it's kind of the climax of where
[18:05] he's going chapter 4 and verse 6 says
[18:08] for god
[18:10] who commanded the light to shine out of
[18:13] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[18:15] give the light of the knowledge
[18:18] of the glory of god
[18:20] in the face
[18:21] of jesus christ
[18:24] what's he talking about in both these
[18:25] chapters
[18:27] us looking into the face of christ
[18:30] openly seeing the face of christ in a
[18:33] minute he'll talk about veils and he
[18:34] takes all the veils away why is he take
[18:36] the veils away so there's like moses
[18:38] there was a veil but with christ he
[18:40] takes all the veils away so when we're
[18:42] looking at this we're looking into the
[18:44] face of christ
[18:45] so now with that in mind that that's the
[18:47] subject it's we're going to be face to
[18:50] face we're going to look into the face
[18:51] of christ that's that's what he's going
[18:53] in now he brings out he says not with
[18:56] written with ink but he says ye are
[18:58] living epistles written and read of all
[19:01] men doesn't that say something about
[19:02] this ministry as well is that we think
[19:05] it all stops with books we think it
[19:07] stops with this bible but that was never
[19:09] the intent to stop with the bible and as
[19:11] long as you read your bible you're okay
[19:13] you should read your bible but actually
[19:15] where this goes where this glory goes is
[19:17] not in the bible but it actually was
[19:20] writ it's written in our hearts and we
[19:22] become written epistles read of all men
[19:27] it's the word made flesh in other words
[19:29] when paul brings the message then then
[19:32] he says in verse 3 for as much as ye are
[19:33] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[19:36] the minister's bias written not with ink
[19:39] but with the spirit of the living god
[19:41] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[19:43] tables of the heart can you imagine the
[19:45] jews trying to understand that who put
[19:47] such weight in the scrolls everything
[19:49] was what was written on the scrolls they
[19:51] were valued they were protected they
[19:53] were brought out in the synagogue every
[19:55] time and read it was very important the
[19:58] ink on the paper and now paul's
[20:00] presenting a ministry but listen that's
[20:02] not the final end is some ink on a
[20:04] paper that's not where this is going
[20:07] this ministry
[20:09] it's going to be written epistles but
[20:10] not with ink on paper there's a more
[20:13] powerful thing than the ink on the paper
[20:15] there's a more powerful thing than a
[20:17] quote in a book
[20:20] and that's when god by the holy spirit
[20:23] begins to write this word
[20:25] in you
[20:28] and that's the same ministry of the
[20:29] message we're under today
[20:34] the lord
[20:36] this is what i was saying about sunday
[20:38] the first and second poll
[20:39] if the first and second poll of jesus
[20:42] ministry and the ministry of the last
[20:44] days was so personal such a personal god
[20:46] touching the hand and healing the sick
[20:49] knowing every need second pole revealing
[20:51] the secrets of the heart such a personal
[20:53] god
[20:55] is the third pole just become mechanical
[20:59] is the same personal god that came down
[21:01] in the first and second poll and got so
[21:03] personal that he actually knew your
[21:05] house number and revealed the very
[21:07] secrets of your heart from many years
[21:08] ago that no man would have known that's
[21:10] why he preached on sunday does the
[21:11] personal god now in the third world
[21:13] become mechanical does it become head
[21:15] knowledge does it become just ink on a
[21:18] page no i say the third part is even
[21:20] deeper than the first and second poll
[21:22] and it's even more personal god than the
[21:24] first and second poll
[21:26] but men
[21:28] we've made it just memorizing quotes we
[21:30] made it just putting quotes together uh
[21:33] uh we made it's more than just putting
[21:35] quotes together it's more than just the
[21:37] quotes that's on the page it's more than
[21:39] just the ink that's been put on so many
[21:42] books and we're helping to send the book
[21:44] still around the world there's a great
[21:45] demand for books but it's only that's
[21:47] only a mechanical device so that someone
[21:50] as they're reading can look into the
[21:52] very face of christ and be changed by
[21:55] the glory of god
[21:58] so we have that as a crutch thank god
[22:00] that we have it god uses it but it is
[22:02] not it is not the final result that we
[22:05] have a bible in our hand
[22:10] it's not just the ink on the page it's
[22:12] not just memorizing quotes it's not
[22:13] putting quotes together it's not just
[22:15] owning the table on your phone
[22:18] it's it's it's on the tables of the
[22:20] heart the bible just said that's the
[22:22] table it's not an app on your phone
[22:25] he wants to write this upon your heart
[22:28] fleshly tables of the heart
[22:31] don't ever settle for i've got this app
[22:34] or i've got this bible or i've got all
[22:36] the books or i've got this the met no
[22:38] don't ever sell that's not where this
[22:40] ministry ends
[22:42] but we are to be written epistles read
[22:44] and of all men can you say amen and this
[22:47] scripture is proof of what he said about
[22:50] the book of redemption that i quoted to
[22:51] you sunday
[22:52] this scripture that says this is not the
[22:55] written ink on the page but this is
[22:57] fleshly tables of a heart not stone and
[23:00] it's written on the heart we are written
[23:02] epistles and the way brother branham
[23:04] says it is he says it this way he says
[23:07] the book of redemption
[23:08] what is it christ
[23:11] is the book
[23:12] and the bride
[23:13] is the words
[23:15] in the book
[23:16] he says he says it a different way but
[23:18] he's saying the same thing as paul
[23:20] what's the book what is this all about
[23:22] it's not books and tapes it's not the
[23:24] ink on the page
[23:26] christ is the book of redemption
[23:29] and the bride is the words in the book
[23:31] that's why we shouldn't make it
[23:32] mechanical that's why we shouldn't make
[23:34] it head knowledge that's why we
[23:36] shouldn't make the message if you just
[23:38] have this and you've got all the quotes
[23:40] together then everything's fine no
[23:42] that's not this ministry it's the the
[23:45] word made flesh
[23:47] it's the face of christ
[23:49] face to face is better than just a book
[23:55] amen
[23:56] if you had a choice to read the book or
[23:58] to meet the author and have them tell
[23:59] you the story which would you do
[24:02] thank you
[24:03] amen
[24:05] you meet the author and then if you meet
[24:08] the author first
[24:10] and then you go read the book and you've
[24:12] got a signed copy in his
[24:15] praise the lord
[24:17] you've got your bible you've got the
[24:19] message you've got these different
[24:20] things but if you meet the author when
[24:23] you go to read the book
[24:25] and it's been signed in blood by the
[24:26] author
[24:28] because you went to a signing at church
[24:31] and he signed his own name on your life
[24:34] now when you go read the book it's like
[24:36] okay i understand this because i met the
[24:39] author
[24:40] i met the man who wrote the book
[24:44] and so i read it naturally
[24:47] while reading it i learned that it was
[24:49] written just for me
[24:52] the bible is the greatest book
[24:55] it's words i highly treasure
[24:58] but the reason that the bible's the
[25:00] greatest book is because i met the
[25:03] author
[25:06] amen
[25:07] i might sing it again because you're
[25:08] almost awake now i met the man who wrote
[25:11] the book and so i read it naturally
[25:13] while reading it i learned that book was
[25:16] written just for me the bible is the
[25:19] greatest book it's words i highly
[25:22] treasure
[25:23] the bible is the greatest book
[25:26] since i met the author
[25:31] this is not a mechanical thing that we
[25:33] come to
[25:34] at the final stage of the third poll
[25:37] in the final ministry that somehow this
[25:39] becomes head knowledge it's a personal
[25:42] god
[25:43] writes it upon the tables of your heart
[25:45] it's a personal relationship with him
[25:47] can you say amen
[25:50] so
[25:51] here's what brother brahma said here
[25:53] about living bibles
[25:55] again he said to them if i do not the
[25:57] works if you guys have that quote up
[25:58] there
[25:59] if i do not the works of my father then
[26:02] believe me not but though you don't
[26:04] believe me
[26:05] believe the works see that's god
[26:07] expressing himself through the flesh he
[26:10] was god made flesh the word living word
[26:12] that's the reason christians i think
[26:14] it's so real tonight that we should live
[26:17] the right kind of life because there's
[26:18] so many people who won't take time to
[26:21] read the bible but they'll read you
[26:25] see you are a written epistle of god a
[26:27] real true born-again christian is the
[26:30] word expressed again because you're
[26:32] written epistles of god read of all men
[26:34] we can say amen to that because it's the
[26:36] same thing in the bible we are written
[26:37] and pressed was read about man look what
[26:39] he says now though
[26:40] what type of person should we be
[26:43] if we know that our lives is an open
[26:47] living bible to the unbeliever to
[26:49] express god in our own life that's a
[26:52] good question first of all we should be
[26:56] open living bibles
[26:58] we'll get into it in a little bit in a
[27:00] minute but if anybody shouldn't be
[27:02] wearing a mask and pretending
[27:04] and being closed and being hidden
[27:07] with their christianity or hidden about
[27:10] things that they're not telling god or
[27:12] not telling one another
[27:13] if anybody should not be being that way
[27:15] it should be christians why because
[27:17] people are watching our lives
[27:20] and i say to you when the book of
[27:22] redemption came down in revelations 10
[27:24] and it was an open book then if he's an
[27:26] open book christ to us then we need to
[27:29] be a life of an open book
[27:33] and brother brahm says that we must live
[27:35] open lives we must be open books if
[27:37] people are watching us he says we should
[27:39] be a living bible to the unbeliever to
[27:41] express god in our own life notice now
[27:43] we see he was the word and the word was
[27:46] made flesh and dwelt among us now we
[27:47] find out that in hebrews you're writing
[27:49] it down hebrews 4 12 the bible said the
[27:51] word of god is sharper than a two-edged
[27:54] sword piercing even to the asunder of
[27:56] morrow and bone and the discerner of the
[27:58] thoughts in the heart the word of god
[28:00] discerns the thoughts that's in your
[28:02] heart therefore god tonight being the
[28:04] word knows exactly what you're even
[28:07] thinking about this very minute
[28:10] so though we try to hide we can't really
[28:13] hide anything
[28:14] so we should live a life that's an open
[28:16] book
[28:18] you see this tonight i want i want my
[28:20] life to be an open book
[28:22] i don't have anything to hide from god
[28:24] and i don't have anything to hide from
[28:26] one another
[28:28] praise the lord the word of god discerns
[28:31] the thoughts and in your heart therefore
[28:33] god tonight being the word knows exactly
[28:35] what you're even thinking about this
[28:37] very minute so
[28:38] should not our thoughts be pure
[28:41] clean
[28:42] holy always thinking the best
[28:48] he's not talking about our actions
[28:50] you talk about an open life you talk
[28:52] about an accountable life
[28:53] he's not talking about just our actions
[28:55] he's talking about our thoughts
[28:58] if this is if god can discern and people
[29:00] are looking this he brings up two things
[29:03] the word can discern it knows what's
[29:04] going on second of all people are
[29:06] watching your life and they're reading
[29:07] your bible
[29:08] if you're a living bible tonight how's
[29:11] your bible reading
[29:13] is it covered over
[29:16] is it covered with a mask is it covered
[29:18] with a veil on top of it is it covered
[29:20] with a private sin
[29:24] how
[29:25] if we knew that nobody in their life
[29:27] would ever read the bible and the only
[29:29] thing they ever read was your bible
[29:32] their whole life the only thing they
[29:33] ever seen was your life how does your
[29:35] bible read
[29:37] tomorrow at work how does your bible
[29:38] read because i'm not talking about here
[29:40] at church i'm talking about how you are
[29:41] tomorrow i'm talking about how you live
[29:43] next week if you're how many raise your
[29:45] hand i'm a living bible i believe i'm
[29:46] the living bible of god i'm the word
[29:48] made flesh how's your bible reading
[29:51] how does it look to the world is it open
[29:53] or is it covered over is your life under
[29:55] a mask and covered over
[29:59] and just some questions he's asking he's
[30:01] also saying your mind your thoughts what
[30:03] you're thinking about never mind what
[30:05] people are saying seeing but look how
[30:07] open this is live your day with positive
[30:10] always thinking the best
[30:13] can you say amen
[30:14] could we live every day always bringing
[30:17] our thoughts under subjection and
[30:19] thinking our best could we live clean
[30:21] and holy and pure thoughts before god
[30:25] you live that way it'll translate into a
[30:27] life
[30:29] people know it can you say amen so i
[30:31] want to be an open bible in my life i
[30:34] want to be an open bible not a closed
[30:35] bible i want somebody to meet me and
[30:38] they start to learn i'm a christian but
[30:40] i'm a very closed person i'm very just
[30:42] very close my heart is closed and i
[30:45] don't know if i'm going to share
[30:46] anything with them because i don't trust
[30:47] them yet no no no my life is an open
[30:50] book
[30:52] and i'll share my testimony and i'll
[30:54] share my weaknesses and i'll share this
[30:56] is the sin that i was in and god
[30:58] delivered me
[31:00] don't think that you're in deep deep sin
[31:04] my life was this way and i'm sharing i
[31:05] don't have anything to hide can you say
[31:07] amen my life has become an open book
[31:11] if you believers of this message believe
[31:13] we're in the hour of the open book of
[31:15] redemption why are you hiding so much in
[31:17] your heart
[31:19] how can you believe the open book of
[31:21] redemption and close your life off to
[31:23] god and other people you have to be an
[31:25] open book too
[31:28] oh praise the lord
[31:30] amen so let's let's continue to keep
[31:33] going here
[31:34] verse four and such trust we have
[31:36] through christ to godward chapter three
[31:39] verse five not that we are sufficient of
[31:41] ourselves to think anything as of
[31:43] ourselves but our sufficiencies of god
[31:45] who also have made us able ministers of
[31:48] the new testament not of the letter but
[31:50] of the spirit for the letter killeth
[31:52] with the spirit give life he's just said
[31:54] we are able ministers of the new
[31:56] testament there's a lot of preachers
[31:58] that are only ministers and they're very
[32:01] able ministers of the old testament
[32:04] they only preach the law
[32:06] they only preach the letter do it and
[32:09] you'll be fine
[32:12] here's the dress code here's what you're
[32:14] supposed to do here's a and you better
[32:16] you should do it and everybody will be
[32:18] watching and if you don't do the right
[32:20] thing you're going to get the elevator
[32:22] look and you won't be comfortable around
[32:24] here just do it and you'll be fine
[32:26] that's a minister an able minister of
[32:28] the old testament
[32:30] but we are not to be ministers of the
[32:32] old testament
[32:33] which means just the letter
[32:35] because why the letter
[32:38] without the spirit of life
[32:40] kills
[32:42] the word in jest letter form without
[32:46] spirit and glory of god kills
[32:51] that's what the bible says
[32:53] that's why i don't want to be a minister
[32:54] of the old testament i want to be a
[32:55] minister of the new testament
[32:57] that has life in it
[32:59] but the letter by itself you say well
[33:00] he's talking about moses law i'm talking
[33:02] about any word and i'm going to go ahead
[33:03] and step out and say it just the letter
[33:06] of the message will kill you
[33:10] if you don't have no holy ghost and no
[33:12] life in you the letter's still killing.
[33:16] and there's many ministers that's
[33:18] preaching the letter the letter of it
[33:21] but they're old testament able ministers
[33:23] they're not ministers of the new
[33:25] testament
[33:26] think about that a minute i'm not i'm an
[33:28] able minister of the new testament going
[33:30] along verse seven but if the
[33:31] ministration of death written and
[33:33] engraven in stones
[33:35] was so glorious so that the children of
[33:36] israel could not step vastly behold the
[33:38] face of moses for the glory of his
[33:40] countenance which glory was to be done
[33:41] away how should not the ministration of
[33:44] the spirit be rather glorious
[33:47] but if the ministration of condemnation
[33:49] be glory much more does the ministration
[33:51] of righteousness exceed in glory did you
[33:54] hear what he just called the minister
[33:56] the old testament did you already call
[33:57] it the ministration
[33:59] of
[34:00] condemnation
[34:03] you imagine a ministry
[34:05] if you just preach the old testament
[34:08] if you just preach the letter you know
[34:10] what kind of ministry that is it's a
[34:11] ministry of condemnation
[34:15] i'm just reading it what it says in the
[34:16] bible he called it the ministration of
[34:19] condemnation but notice if that had
[34:22] glory in moses face
[34:24] how much more when ministers preached
[34:26] the life and glory how much more glory
[34:29] is in this
[34:31] my think about it
[34:33] the ministration of death administration
[34:35] of condemnation and that glory was
[34:37] hovering around and in moses face they
[34:40] had he had to veil his face for even
[34:42] that verse for ten for even that which
[34:44] was made glorious had no glory in it
[34:46] this respect by reason of the glory that
[34:48] excelleth for if that which is done away
[34:50] in other words in verse 10 he's
[34:52] basically saying in verse 10 if you go
[34:53] back he's saying even if that which was
[34:55] made glorious had no glory in this
[34:56] respect by reason of the glory that
[34:58] excellent now we come to this glory it's
[35:00] as if that wasn't any glory at all
[35:02] can you imagine jews listen to him what
[35:04] are you talking about you're putting
[35:06] down moses the prophet
[35:08] but he's saying this glory excelleth
[35:11] that glory if i had to make a choice i'd
[35:13] never go back to moses again
[35:17] oh how the jews must have loved that
[35:18] sermon
[35:21] and he's calling it that saying
[35:24] if you're comparing it
[35:26] that doesn't even have any glory in it
[35:28] compared to this glory for that which is
[35:31] done away was glorious much more that
[35:32] which remaineth this glorious seeing
[35:34] then that we have such hope we use great
[35:36] plainness of speech and not as moses
[35:39] which put a veil over his face that the
[35:40] children of israel could not steadfastly
[35:42] look to the end of that which is
[35:44] abolished
[35:46] so moses had to veil himself because the
[35:48] people couldn't look at him there was so
[35:50] much glory upon his countenance he had
[35:52] to put a veil a mask
[35:54] on on top of it to cover
[35:56] it verse 14 now moses goes into
[36:00] the children of israel
[36:03] today but their minds
[36:05] were blinded for until this day
[36:08] remaineth the same veil and taken away
[36:10] in the reading of the old testament
[36:12] which veil is done away in christ
[36:15] so
[36:16] them staying in their religion
[36:18] and not moving on with the new testament
[36:21] and what christ was bringing after
[36:23] calvary them staying with that they
[36:26] become blinded by that can you say amen
[36:29] and they have a veil
[36:31] upon their heart they have a veil upon
[36:34] their understanding they have a mask
[36:36] that's holding them back
[36:39] and then he says verse 15 but even unto
[36:41] this day when moses is read the veil is
[36:43] upon their heart i mentioned that sunday
[36:46] that even until this day when the
[36:47] prophet is read there's a veil in their
[36:50] heart so right here i want to just say
[36:52] it's not just that god would take the
[36:54] veil off of himself but we have to take
[36:56] all veils off of ourselves
[37:00] because if god takes his off and says
[37:02] the glory is available to you and we
[37:04] hold something and we hide something and
[37:06] we have a veil on
[37:08] then we're limiting ourselves to the
[37:10] glory of god
[37:12] we'll get into it in just a minute
[37:13] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[37:15] lord israel when they turn to the lord
[37:16] the veil shall be taken away so the key
[37:19] in this is the lord of the message the
[37:21] lord of the
[37:22] the the truth the lord of the preaching
[37:24] whatever you want to call it it's not
[37:26] just having the letter but it's that
[37:27] presence of the lord it's the person of
[37:29] the lord how many remember me preaching
[37:31] it sunday it's the person of the message
[37:34] and when they turn to the person that's
[37:35] within this all veils are taken away in
[37:37] this person
[37:39] now the lord is that spirit and where
[37:41] the spirit of the lord is there's
[37:42] liberty but we all with open face
[37:44] beholding as in the glass the glory of
[37:45] the lord are changed in the same image
[37:47] from glory to glory even as by the
[37:50] spirit of the lord so israel had their
[37:52] own veil
[37:54] so if they did so can we have a veil or
[37:56] a mask on even through even though god
[38:00] takes
[38:01] god takes his mask off
[38:04] israel's but what was it it was a
[38:06] religious veil
[38:08] and their religious veil limited them
[38:10] from seeing further truth
[38:12] their religious male it's happening
[38:14] today they're a religious veil of a
[38:17] denomination and a view of the scripture
[38:19] veils and holds the people back from
[38:22] further truth that's even laying in the
[38:24] scripture because they're limited by the
[38:26] veil
[38:27] they can't see it all because they have
[38:29] a mask can you say amen and so they're
[38:32] limited
[38:33] they're limited what is it their former
[38:35] teaching
[38:36] or even a religious spirit
[38:39] can be a mask on someone
[38:42] keeping them from the real thing
[38:44] religious spirit is the worst kind
[38:48] what's a religious spirit it's a pride
[38:50] number one
[38:51] but it's a religious pride
[38:54] that thinks that it's a notch above
[38:56] everybody else sometimes way beyond
[38:58] everybody else but it's also very
[38:59] critical because nobody else ever
[39:01] measures up to where they're at the
[39:02] expectations of everybody else never
[39:04] measures up to where they're at or maybe
[39:06] they're where they want to be they're
[39:07] not really there
[39:09] but they think they are their pride
[39:11] so this is a religious pride to think
[39:14] that we're way up here they didn't need
[39:16] to humble themselves and accept christ
[39:18] they didn't need to do that they had the
[39:20] law they had moses they were religious
[39:22] leaders they had their understanding
[39:24] they studied it all their life they come
[39:25] up through all the different
[39:26] denominations and the pharisees and
[39:29] sadducees and you could be a part of uh
[39:31] three or four different groups back then
[39:32] and you were taught you taught in the
[39:34] bible taught in the taught in the old
[39:36] testament you knew it so well but what
[39:38] happens is that without the spirit it
[39:41] lifts up in pride
[39:43] and a religious pride to the when christ
[39:45] stands in the room they can't humble
[39:47] themselves to just be open
[39:49] and lay down their life before christ
[39:52] when the lord steps in the room
[39:55] they're already a notch better so they
[39:57] don't really need remember what jesus
[39:58] said when the pharisees go in the temple
[40:00] they say great big loud prayers and to
[40:03] be seen of men and
[40:05] all these clothes and everything
[40:07] he said don't be like that when you go
[40:08] in to pray go into your private closet
[40:12] and the god that
[40:15] the god that sees you in private will
[40:17] reward you openly all those things about
[40:19] the phrase don't be a pharisee
[40:21] don't have a religious spirit dominating
[40:23] your have the holy ghost dominating your
[40:24] life
[40:25] leading your life
[40:27] leading it
[40:28] but don't take a religious spirit that
[40:30] i'm better and this is what israel had
[40:33] and it was a mask a religious spirit can
[40:36] be a mask keeping you
[40:38] from the real holy ghost and the real
[40:41] walk of the holy ghost
[40:43] a religious spirit robs people because
[40:45] they never can humble themselves to see
[40:48] that
[40:49] they're human they're weak
[40:51] their religious spirit interprets that
[40:53] i'm past all that
[40:54] i gave my heart to the lord years ago
[40:57] i'm a message believer
[40:59] i'm going in the rapture
[41:01] but if you've got hidden things in your
[41:03] life
[41:05] you better get rid of that religious
[41:07] spirit and get the real holy ghost
[41:11] if you have a religious pious spirit
[41:12] making you look better and degrading and
[41:15] putting others down
[41:16] you can't go any deeper than where
[41:18] you're at right now
[41:20] the next quote that i have
[41:22] i love it because it talks about the
[41:23] first you know there's a word i think
[41:25] that's associated with pharisee that's a
[41:27] mask it's putting on a mask
[41:29] and the way brother brown describes is
[41:30] what does the pharisee mean we don't use
[41:32] that word very often in kentucky what
[41:34] does the pharis word pharisee mean in
[41:36] the greek it means an actor
[41:38] someone who acts
[41:40] oh i hate that
[41:42] somebody acting trying
[41:44] to put on
[41:46] i despise such a thing
[41:49] many times people are trying to act like
[41:51] they the other fella listen you quit
[41:54] trying to act like the next fella and
[41:56] just act out your own convictions and
[41:59] you'll get along better
[42:01] be yourself that's right
[42:07] you see so many little children going to
[42:09] the picture shows
[42:11] come back home and want to act like the
[42:13] actress
[42:14] shame on you in hollywood los angeles i
[42:16] have many services out there and i find
[42:18] out that most of the people that's grown
[42:20] up on that whole environment of the
[42:22] american people to act it's in other
[42:24] words if they lived out there or now
[42:27] it's because it's on all the tvs and all
[42:28] the movies our tendency as a human being
[42:31] is the children to act out what they're
[42:34] watching
[42:35] they are not that but they act it out
[42:38] they are not that
[42:40] but they
[42:41] put on the mask of it in other words
[42:43] they aren't that but they're going to
[42:45] dress just like that sports star
[42:47] they're going to put their hair just
[42:49] like that sports star and then come in
[42:51] the room and tell us this is an original
[42:52] thing that i've always wanted to do
[42:57] just give me about five minutes that i
[42:58] can google it and find exactly where
[43:01] that movie star or sports star has that
[43:02] where you found it
[43:04] and brother ram says i hate when someone
[43:06] pretends and tries to be someone else
[43:09] americans comparing themselves oh let's
[43:11] talk about facebook
[43:15] who the studies now are you reading the
[43:16] studies the last two or three years did
[43:18] you read the one yesterday that put it
[43:21] on teenage girls one out of three
[43:22] teenage girls going through depression
[43:24] and all that bringing it back to
[43:26] facebook and instagram
[43:28] study just yesterday and instagram and
[43:31] facebook don't want to comment about it
[43:33] they don't because they're making so
[43:34] much money and all this other stuff
[43:36] they want to leave it alone but their
[43:38] comment in the article i read it again
[43:39] this afternoon their comment was
[43:42] is that if
[43:43] 40 or 50 years ago
[43:45] we had to take the cigarette companies
[43:47] and nip them in the bud and correct them
[43:49] because they were advertising to our
[43:52] teenagers but they weren't showing the
[43:53] damages to this they said we should be
[43:55] doing the same thing with social media
[43:58] because it's a comparison thing and they
[44:00] go into depression because they can
[44:02] never measure up to everybody else on
[44:04] there
[44:05] so we're not in the days of brother
[44:07] brown talking about hollywood we're
[44:08] talking about every day we're bombarded
[44:11] with images of someone else who looks
[44:13] better has more things is on a better
[44:15] vacation and we're it was just
[44:17] depression depression depression
[44:18] depression depression because we can
[44:20] never be so we strive to be someone else
[44:23] and all the time god's saying why don't
[44:24] you just take all the mask off and just
[44:26] be what i made you
[44:30] be be who i made you
[44:32] be real
[44:34] don't be an actor don't act like a
[44:36] sports star don't dress like a sports
[44:38] star i didn't call you to be a sports
[44:40] star
[44:41] and if i did i want you to be out there
[44:43] being yourself not someone else
[44:45] all the little
[44:46] pretty little hairdos of these
[44:48] football players and basketball players
[44:50] and i'm i'm saying i used to say it just
[44:53] maybe every other few games and say oh
[44:55] doesn't he look like a little cutie
[44:57] now i'm saying it all the time doesn't
[45:00] he look or she look cute
[45:03] isn't that cute everyone has all the
[45:05] emphasis on the hair but what the bad
[45:07] thing is is when christians try to
[45:10] imitate that
[45:12] it's wrong
[45:15] so you see them go on screen and the
[45:17] american people through television
[45:18] through picture shows they have seen so
[45:20] much put on do they become put-ons
[45:22] themselves did you what this is this is
[45:24] going all the way back to the message
[45:25] pride back in the 50s
[45:27] is so much truth to it they've seen so
[45:30] many people put on that they start to
[45:33] put things on
[45:35] it rubs off on them
[45:38] and we get in the we get it in the
[45:39] church we get actors hmm god don't want
[45:42] them far be it from us to be actors
[45:44] that's what a pharisee is an actor be
[45:46] yourself god wants you to be that way i
[45:49] despise seeing someone trying to do
[45:51] something that they cannot do
[45:53] what a disgrace
[45:55] i call this a wannabe
[45:58] he's a wannabe he always wants to be
[45:59] somebody else he wants to be this he
[46:02] wants to be that he wants to be a
[46:03] successful he wants to be a a successful
[46:06] mayor and he wants to be like like this
[46:08] guy and that guy and he reads all the
[46:10] books and it's a wannabe and they live
[46:11] their whole life as a wannabe never
[46:14] laying their lives before and saying god
[46:16] what do you want me to do who do you
[46:18] want me to be and if it's in a factory
[46:21] somewhere taking my lunch to work every
[46:22] day
[46:23] supporting my family brother abraham
[46:25] said god in simplicity said god can get
[46:28] more glory out of that simple life of
[46:31] grabbing his lunch kissing his wife
[46:34] praying with his family and goes to work
[46:36] every day
[46:39] he said god will get more glory out of
[46:41] that life than all the high high
[46:43] seminary preachers
[46:46] because god's hiding himself in
[46:48] simplicity
[46:50] but he says some pretty straight words
[46:51] here when he says i hate and he says god
[46:54] don't want them far be it from us to be
[46:56] actors be yourself god wants you to be
[46:58] that way i despise seeing someone trying
[47:00] to do something they cannot do what a
[47:01] disgrace i've noticed that many times in
[47:04] beautiful voices that god has given to
[47:06] people a talent and then they overtrain
[47:08] it i hate to hear an overtrained voice
[47:11] when they stand up to sing and get some
[47:13] kind of a note until they hold it so
[47:15] long till they get blue in the face
[47:18] just to show the congregation how long
[47:20] they can hang on for dear life
[47:24] you're acting they're putting on a show
[47:27] it's performance
[47:29] and i believe in doing your best and
[47:31] doing the very best of your gift
[47:33] but don't perform to me
[47:35] don't put on a show for me sing in the
[47:38] holy ghost
[47:40] worship god
[47:41] sing your best but when it crosses the
[47:44] line into entertainment and performance
[47:46] it can only head in one wrong direction
[47:49] people of god don't want to be
[47:51] entertained and perform to can you say
[47:52] man
[47:55] and when they come back down after
[47:57] holding on for dear life and when they
[47:58] come back down then people is not
[48:00] praising god
[48:02] their mind is on their note
[48:04] oh boy you know i'm talking about being
[48:07] open and honest
[48:08] in this ministry that's a pretty honest
[48:11] comment not too many people
[48:13] in the music world will say that and be
[48:14] honest about it that sometimes
[48:17] the people are not praising the lord
[48:19] they're praising how well the person's
[48:21] saying
[48:25] the praising how well
[48:27] wow they're being wowed by
[48:30] oh that was so
[48:31] awesome praise the lord
[48:34] i don't know
[48:39] and so this is a good lesson for all of
[48:41] us christians it's a good lesson for
[48:43] musicians
[48:45] we need to have the anointing of god and
[48:47] do our very best
[48:48] to play skillfully on our instrument and
[48:50] sing to the very best of our gifts
[48:53] but we need to be under such an
[48:54] anointing that the people lose that it's
[48:56] the singer
[48:58] and it's all about christ
[49:00] that's a challenge for all you ministers
[49:03] of music and all of you we and i'm not
[49:05] preaching against anybody here tonight
[49:07] because we have good ones and i tell
[49:09] them these we teach them these things we
[49:11] talk about these things and i try to to
[49:13] remind sometimes these because this is
[49:15] where the the prophet directed us is
[49:17] that we don't want to become an actor we
[49:20] don't want to copy what the next person
[49:22] is doing
[49:23] uh in the denominations
[49:28] this would apply to this can you say man
[49:31] we don't want to just say well i want to
[49:33] do that because they did it and i want
[49:35] to do it just like them
[49:37] where's your originality
[49:39] if you're inspired by a song then sing
[49:42] it to the glory of god and sing it your
[49:43] way
[49:47] when they come back down the people's
[49:49] not praising their mind they're they're
[49:51] praising god their minds on that note i
[49:53] love good old-fashioned pentecostal
[49:54] singing that's right where you forget
[49:56] the piano and the organ where you don't
[49:57] have to get some kind of ritualistic put
[50:00] on program where you raise up your hands
[50:02] with the tears running down from your
[50:03] cheeks
[50:04] whether you could sing do remy vasalati
[50:07] do or not
[50:10] and just sing in the spirit
[50:12] from the heart you give praise to god
[50:15] all out of all are all out of the
[50:17] program you have to get out of man's
[50:19] program to get into god's program
[50:22] get out of it oh my deliver me from
[50:24] being an actor can you say amen friends
[50:27] he's saying these open and honest things
[50:29] and it applies to all of our christian
[50:31] walk we don't put on what somebody else
[50:32] is doing we'd be ourselves we take the
[50:35] mask off can you say man god's being
[50:37] real with us we be real with god this is
[50:40] where i'm at even if you're living in
[50:41] sin tonight be honest with god don't put
[50:44] on something that i'm okay person i do
[50:46] good deeds i give to the united way i'm
[50:48] a pretty good person just be real about
[50:50] where you're at
[50:52] and if you're living a life of sin say
[50:53] god this is who i am this is where i'm
[50:55] at take me as i am just as i am without
[50:58] one plea
[51:00] and
[51:01] i just one more comment about the sing
[51:03] in the spirit and get out of men's
[51:05] program and i know that our music
[51:07] leaders here and i know the way brother
[51:09] kenny leads the choir
[51:11] is that we believe that you should play
[51:13] skillfully and do your best
[51:15] in rehearsing and do your very best to
[51:17] do it the best way you can for the lord
[51:20] but when you get up and start singing
[51:22] when it's time to sing it in front of
[51:24] the congregation
[51:25] then you just
[51:27] you still do your best but you just say
[51:29] lord bring the anointing now
[51:31] bring the anointing now and that's the
[51:33] way he teaches them that's the way to
[51:34] teach it because we believe in being our
[51:36] best and being skillful you do that in
[51:38] your job
[51:40] you should
[51:42] you work to become better at it and you
[51:44] be skillful but in a person you do that
[51:46] is a gift brother brahms said that it
[51:48] was a person that drew some art for him
[51:50] and had a nice picture he said i wish i
[51:52] had the money that boy's got a gift i
[51:54] wish i had the money to send him to
[51:55] college and develop that gift a little
[51:57] bit more you should develop your gifts
[51:59] you should become better at your gifts
[52:01] and do it is unto the lord
[52:03] when you come up to worship the lord
[52:05] then it's just all out there and say
[52:07] lord
[52:08] come lord jesus
[52:11] oh and if he wants to get out of the
[52:12] program then let him get out of the
[52:13] program
[52:15] deliver me from being an actor be what
[52:17] you are god will bless you you even
[52:20] see sometimes ministers will do that
[52:22] they will get in the pulpit now i'm
[52:23] getting preached on here they will get

[54:32] come and come to the altar and die to
[54:34] this thing that's hurting other people
[54:36] and doing other things and lashing out
[54:38] and being somebody different being some
[54:40] kind of wild bear when you're out there
[54:43] and then acting like a christian on
[54:45] sunday mornings
[54:46] say god take that thing out of me that's
[54:48] being an actor
[54:49] and when i come to church and i lift my
[54:52] hands
[54:54] it's real
[54:56] it's not putting it on for everybody and
[54:58] putting it on to our children as well
[55:01] because see they see they know
[55:04] they see
[55:06] a mass can be also hiding sin in your
[55:09] life
[55:11] private personal pleasure
[55:13] and all the while you're holding that
[55:15] private personal pleasure that you give
[55:17] yourself permission to do it's a mask
[55:20] and all the while you can't go any
[55:22] deeper in the lord
[55:24] under this ministry it won't work
[55:26] you will feel more condemnation more and
[55:28] more as you come to church if you hide
[55:30] things
[55:31] if you put a mask on
[55:33] the title of my service tonight is this
[55:35] ministry this ministry of no veils
[55:38] no mask
[55:41] and i'm not talking about literal mask
[55:46] praise the lord
[55:48] i'll just give you a piece of advice
[55:50] before we close tonight about uh
[56:18] just ask yourself
[56:21] would i be able to do this thing or look
[56:24] at this
[56:25] in front of anyone in the body of christ
[56:27] right now
[56:31] including the pastor
[56:36] i'm challenging you tonight to take your
[56:38] mask off
[56:40] because
[56:41] in the christian life it's an
[56:42] accountable life to the holy spirit
[56:44] number one in the presence of the lord
[56:46] who's always present by the way
[56:48] there's nothing he don't see
[56:51] and when we're conscious of his presence
[56:53] brother bram says wherever we are he's
[56:55] there
[56:56] we'll live a different life
[56:58] we have the fear of the lord that his
[57:00] presence is near but just ask yourself
[57:02] if that's if that's not strong enough it
[57:04] should be but would i be able to do this
[57:06] or look at this in front of anybody in
[57:08] the body of christ right now including
[57:09] the pastor if not if you can't do that
[57:12] i'd stop doing it
[57:14] as soon as possible i'd stop it tonight
[57:17] because you're only deceiving yourself
[57:19] you're living under a mask
[57:24] you say well what a what about where
[57:25] paul talked about liberties
[57:28] and certain things we have faith to do
[57:30] well he's not talking about sin that's
[57:32] for sure
[57:34] but he said about that you may have
[57:36] something that you that you do and if it
[57:38] would offend a brother he says i
[57:40] wouldn't do that
[57:41] i wouldn't do that to offend another
[57:43] brother in the body of christ you see
[57:44] it's all about the body of christ
[57:45] accountability you don't live life to
[57:47] yourself your life is an open book
[57:51] you have to tell the whole world
[57:52] everything but listen we don't we don't
[57:54] have be a part of the body of christ and
[57:56] then we have a little private sins that
[57:58] we enjoy
[58:00] just doesn't work that way
[58:02] i'm encouraging us friends to take our
[58:04] mass down and live in the glory of the
[58:06] lord let me close this by saying tonight
[58:09] by
[58:09] by verse 18 3 18 but we all with open
[58:13] face beholding as in the glass the glory
[58:15] of the lord are changed into the same
[58:18] glory from the glory to glory even as by
[58:21] the spirit of the lord everything you
[58:22] heard tonight i just want to sum it up
[58:24] by saying when israel turns to the lord
[58:26] the masks are taken away there's going
[58:28] to be liberty because where the spirit
[58:30] of the lord is there's liberty there's
[58:32] freedom
[58:33] and we can safely say also also that the
[58:37] mask limits the glory of god how many
[58:40] can say the veil or the mask limits the
[58:42] glory of god
[58:45] i can't imagine anyone here tonight that
[58:47] would want to limit the glory of god in
[58:49] your life
[58:50] but a veil does it
[58:52] those veils on israel's heart that it
[58:54] limits the glory of god from coming
[58:56] forth so that's why i preach on taking
[58:58] the veils down taking all religious
[59:00] veils down all private veils being open
[59:03] living an open life before him why it's
[59:05] not because i'm trying to get you to
[59:07] line up it's because when you have a
[59:09] veil on when you have a mask on it
[59:11] limits the glory of god
[59:14] and when you pull it down more of the
[59:15] glory of god comes in your life you
[59:17] think you're doing pretty good i'm
[59:19] telling you there's glories of the lord
[59:20] that come upon in your life and your
[59:22] family you haven't even seen yet
[59:26] but you've got to look into the face of
[59:27] the lord and say lord i'm all here and
[59:29] i'm looking in your face
[59:31] and here's another thing that it limits
[59:33] if you limit the glory of god in your
[59:35] life you limit being changed
[59:38] because what does the glory of god do it
[59:40] changes you
[59:43] it changes you
[59:44] it's really the only thing that can
[59:46] truly change you
[59:48] going through 10 steps of perfection by
[59:50] psychology doesn't really change you the
[59:52] real change comes when the glory of god
[59:54] is present he changes you
[59:57] why would anybody want to limit change
[59:59] in their life why would anybody want to
[1:00:00] limit the glory of god why would any
[1:00:02] musician why would any preacher want to
[1:00:05] limit the glory of god by wearing a mask
[1:00:07] i say when we come to church let's come
[1:00:09] fully open before the lord let every
[1:00:11] preacher be open and preach the word let
[1:00:14] him hold nothing back and when we come
[1:00:16] to a service may not one inch of the
[1:00:18] glory of the lord be limited to come in
[1:00:20] this service
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:22] when you go home say god may this home
[1:00:24] that i have may this marriage that i
[1:00:27] have may none of it limit the glory of
[1:00:30] god from coming into my home
[1:00:32] let me be open lord let me honest
[1:00:33] sometimes you look in the very face of
[1:00:35] your wife and your husband
[1:00:38] maybe you're hiding things you look in
[1:00:39] their very face the one that you should
[1:00:41] love the most outside of the lord and
[1:00:44] you you're not you know someone
[1:00:46] sometimes that's lying they're looking
[1:00:47] another way they can't look in the face
[1:00:50] but when you're wanting to really get
[1:00:51] deliverance and really get freedom and
[1:00:53] see the glory of god come down you look
[1:00:55] and say honey i love you with all my
[1:00:57] heart i got this to confess you maybe
[1:00:59] you don't have nothing to confess but
[1:01:00] i'm open i'm not living any private life
[1:01:03] outside of you we are one
[1:01:06] where are some marriages like that
[1:01:09] we look into each other's eyes face to
[1:01:11] face there's nobody else but you nothing
[1:01:13] in this world matters but you
[1:01:16] looking at the lord that way lord
[1:01:17] nothing else matters but you there's no
[1:01:19] hidden secrets there's no closets
[1:01:21] there's no double life being lived here
[1:01:24] everything that i am all that i am i'm
[1:01:26] living for you and i'm standing here
[1:01:27] being honest with you look into my eyes
[1:01:32] and read that i'm being real with you
[1:01:34] and the last thing that i wanted to say
[1:01:36] he said when the glory of the lord is
[1:01:38] there that we are changed
[1:01:42] i love this
[1:01:44] from glory
[1:01:46] to glory
[1:01:47] to glory
[1:01:49] to glory now
[1:01:50] friends i'm a preacher who says that we
[1:01:53] don't just get everything one night at
[1:01:55] an altar and never come to god again
[1:01:59] i believe in a moment's time a person
[1:02:01] can have a conversion by the holy ghost
[1:02:03] but that bible many places reads like
[1:02:05] this
[1:02:06] we're changed and it's not just one
[1:02:08] night at altar we're changed from glory
[1:02:11] to glory to glory i'm telling you
[1:02:13] there's more glory
[1:02:15] there's more glory
[1:02:16] there's more of god for you
[1:02:18] and the more honest we get before the
[1:02:20] lord the more glory and the more change
[1:02:24] the more open we can be
[1:02:26] the more sins we can put underneath the
[1:02:28] blood the more habits that we can say
[1:02:30] god kill that thing that i never do it
[1:02:32] again the more we do that the more we go
[1:02:35] to another glory and another glory this
[1:02:38] is a growth this is a this is a growth
[1:02:40] this is not a one-night event
[1:02:43] and i know preachers preaching it one
[1:02:45] night then that's fine it's it's not a
[1:02:47] problem but there's too many scriptures
[1:02:49] when we're changed we're not just
[1:02:51] changed the first night in the soul we
[1:02:52] are but we got a flesh to deal with we
[1:02:54] got a spirit to deal with and from glory
[1:02:57] to glory to glory to glory by what
[1:03:00] looking in his face say lord i'm here
[1:03:03] i'm here to present myself to you
[1:03:06] i i i i wanna i wanna give everything to
[1:03:10] you i wanna

[1:03:21] something today at church or this

[1:03:28] i'm here presenting myself to you
[1:03:31] you change me how many want to change
[1:03:34] how many want the glory of god
[1:03:36] whether we have to take the mask down
[1:03:37] mask limit the glory of god veils limit
[1:03:40] the glory of god even in the message
[1:03:43] mask to this day a mask or a veil or
[1:03:46] hiding something will limit the glory of
[1:03:49] god in this message you can go to a
[1:03:51] message church your entire life and miss
[1:03:54] the glory of god
[1:03:56] miss the change
