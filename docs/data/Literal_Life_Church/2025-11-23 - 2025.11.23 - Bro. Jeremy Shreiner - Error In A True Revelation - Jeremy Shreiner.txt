[applause] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. We're grateful for the Lord to offer this thanksgiving and spend the day together and worship him. [music] And I don't have the time this morning. Usually I read a little bit of the Thanksgiving story so everybody knows why we have these freedoms and the purpose of our uh founding fathers and and many of the ones that come over to to uh come for religious freedom. [music] And so thankfully today for the most part here at least in this church we can lift our hands and worship the Lord freely and we should be thankful for that. Can you say amen? We don't have restrictions for that. I know [music] that may change someday, but we still have it. We should not take it for granted that we can come and worship according to the dictates of our own heart. And that's what [music] they come over for to get rid of get away from the religious persecution and also the the bondage that was put on by uh basically denominational systems. And that's what it happens many times. I don't think there should be any restrictions on our worship to serve the Lord with all of our hearts. And uh if there is restrictions today that the devil's putting on you, just say, "Lord, remove all of th that slavery and whatever it is that's those restrictions so that I could be a free man and woman in Christ." Praise be to God. So I don't have time to read the Thanksgiving story today to you all. I know how much you enjoy me reading it. So because I don't get to read it, all of my family members, Amanda, all you guys, you're going to hear it at the family gathering this Friday, this Thursday. So you're gonna you you guys are going to hear it. So my my my praise. [snorts] I come before you today and there's just one thing that I want to say. Thank [singing] you, Lord. Thank [music] you, [singing] Lord, for all you've given to me. For all the blessings that I cannot see. Thank you, Lord. [music] Thank you, [singing] Lord.

[singing] Oh, I give you thanks for [music] all you done. [music] I am so blessed. So blessed by rest, [music] oh Lord, I give you thanks. [music] Thank [singing] you Lord for the strength you give to simply carry on [music] through life's toils and test through the worst and best. [music] You never left me alone. You're always right beside me. You hear me when I pray. [music] And since I first [singing] began, you've been my dearest friend. How many can say that this morning? A friend that [music] sticks closer than a brother. Hallelujah. Thanks. Thanks. Oh, [singing] I give you. Let's stand and sing. For all [music] you done. [music] Well, I am so blessed. My soul has found my blessing. Oh Lord, [music] I give you thanks. Second verse. I give you thanks [music] this moment and I will continually for each day [music] I live your praise to him. I'm blessed abundantly. I [music] can't forget that moment in my life. You made such a change. [music] Since the spirit came, I've not been the same. I want to give you all [music] the praise. Thanks. Thanks. I give [music] you thanks for [singing] all you done. [music] I am so blessed. My soul is [music] found. Oh Lord, I give you thanks. [singing] [music] Amen. [applause and music] Father, Praise the Lord. Thank you, Father. Praise the Lord. They say that a thankful and a grateful heart. Not too many people with that have depression. Not too many people with that get angry, overly angry. And it's because you're grateful. You're really thankful for what God has given you. It's easy to look at what's bad and what's wrong in you and the other person. It's a lot harder to look at the blessings that you have and look at the good that God's blessed you with. And you, you people are a blessed people this morning. &gt;&gt; You are blessed above measure. Can you say amen? It's easy to look at all the things and maybe you feel like life has handed you the wrong stuff. But God can give you a new start. God can give you a complete new slate and God can uh redeem. That's what he's in the business of doing is redeeming souls of men. And that we appreciate being under that power this morning of redemption. We're glad to have brother Jeremy with us. We want to invite him right away. Not delay. Uh Friday night he talked to the young people about the enemy trying to make our house a haunted house. this house. And I thought it was interesting because we've been preaching on the temple of God, our temple of the Lord becoming a powerhouse for God and our temple being cleansed. But Satan does not want you to be a temple of God. He wants you to be a haunted house. And he talked about a haunted house is tied to for our house is tied to thoughts that we have to scare us, to haunt us, thoughts from the past. Thoughts that there's something still there. And sometimes it's not even there. But thoughts can haunt us from the past. [music] And God wants us to have our houses clear of that. He certainly doesn't want us to be a haunted house that's haunted by thoughts of the past. [music] He wants us to have thoughts that are of him. And we actually can direct our thinking. The Bible says think on the think on these things. Whatsoever is lovely, whatsoever is pure, whatsoever good report, think on these things. So that tells us we have the power to be able to direct our thoughts instead of Satan taking over our thoughts. That was a summary of Friday night. Thank you. That was a summary of Friday night. You didn't get to hear it, but it was wonderful. And Saturday, uh, last night was so wonderful talking about the difference in an an infirmity and the brokenness and the pain. And God can heal all brokenness in marriages. God can heal all brokenness. [music] And those of us who were there was a great blessing to hear those things. And I know we're introducing for the first time, but I know he'll be a blessing to you, Brother Jeremy, and his gift this morning. So, we want him to come. Let's sing it again. And uh we're glad to be able to enjoy the day together. Enjoy the Lord. And uh you be listening because it's not just men speaking. It's the Lord trying to say something to you. It really is. If you look at it that way, God can really say things to anchor in your heart this morning. The past can be washed away. God can give you a new slate. He's He's in the business of giving us a new start. Thanks. Thanks. I give you [singing] thanks for all you've done. [singing] Oh, I am so [music] blessed you. Oh Lord, I give you [music] thanks. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time now. Oh, thanks. Thanks. I give you [music] thanks for all [singing] you done. Are you blessed? I am [music and singing] so blessed. So blessed. My soul has found rest. [music and singing] Oh Lord, I give you thanks. Amen. [music] Let's pray together. Lord, as we come before you, we're thankful to be in this building together. And Lord, where we know your presence is here. And Father, we know that you you're you're with us wherever we go. But there's nothing like coming together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith [music] where we can bind together. No matter what the battle is or the struggle is, you know what it is. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Whoever is ministering the word, Father. Lord, you know, God, one title, but you can speak to every heart in some way. May our hearts be open to you this morning. We pray, God, I ask that you would just give me strength and wisdom, Father, as we surrender our thoughts to you now. And God, that everything would be done for your glory and your glory alone. [music] We just love you and praise you for it all in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. We're going to sing a song together. I I think that's a common thing here, right? &gt;&gt; So, it's it's good to So, this song that I've been singing, I guess we'll switch mics. Testing this song that we're going to try to sing together. I've loved to sing since I was a child and it's always meant something to me [music] and and I struggle to go places and you like, what what song can you sing? Because we sing them all, right? But this song I couldn't get away from for the last uh week and I asked brother Paul and and &gt;&gt; yes, thank you. I can't even remember my own name this morning, Sister Sharon, to sing with us. So, we practice it a couple times and we'll practice it with you this morning. But I pray that it'll be a blessing to you. Amen. God bless you this morning. As little children, we [music] would dream of Christmas morning of all the gifts [music] and toys we knew we'd find. But we never realized a baby born [singing] one blessed night gave us the greatest gift [music] of our lives. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; We were the reason [singing] that he gave his life. We are [singing] the reason [music] that he suffered and [singing] died to a [music] world that was lost. He gave all he [music] could [singing] give to show us the reason [music] to live. [singing] As the years went by, we learned [singing and music] more about gifts and the giving of [singing] ourselves and what that means. On a dark and cloudy day, [music] a man hung crying [singing] in the rain. All because of [music and singing] love. All because of love. [music] And we are the reason [singing] that he gave his life. We are the reason [music] [singing] that he suffered and died to [music] a world [singing] that was lost. He gave all he [music] could give. She show us [singing] the [music] reason to live. Oh, [singing and music] I finally found a reason for living. [singing] [music] It's in giving every [singing] heart of my heart to you. [music] And in all [singing] that I do, every [music] word that I say, I'll [singing] be giving [music] my all just for him. [singing] [music] We are the reason that he [music] gave life. We are the reason [singing] that he suffered [music] and died to the world that was lost. He gave [singing] all he [music] to show to [music] a world that was [singing] lost. He gave all here [music] again to show us the reason [music] to live. He is my reason [singing] to live. Aren't you thankful for that? Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, [music] God. [applause] Hallelujah. He is our reason. If you came here this morning wondering what your reason is, you know it's him. Thankful for the people next to us, but he is our reason this morning. Amen. If we could, we'll just dive into this this morning. We could stand together. 1 Chronicles chapter 13. Again, it's good to be here this morning and to uh meet you from afar. I I am who I am and I try to stay that way. I try not to be like anybody else and then uh I say, "Thank you, Lord, for that." I hear a lot that my ministry is unique. Sometimes I don't know how to take that, but as long as he's working through it and and he gets the glory for it, then that's what matters. But it's good to be here this morning. my first time ever in Michigan and and uh I just appreciate the kindred spirit that we have with brother Paul and and his wife and now meet meeting each and every one of you. Uh let's read verse 13. 1 Chronicles chapter 13. We begin reading at verse number one says, "And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, if it seemed good unto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites, which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us. For we inquired not at it in the days of Saul, and all the congregation said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. Could we just pray one more time? Lord, as your presence is here, we ask again that you would deal with every heart in a special way. As again, we are surrendered to you now. We love you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats. This is an interesting title and I say don't shut me down yet. Our title this morning is an is called error in a true revelation. Error in a true revelation. And I pray that by the end of this the Lord will have given us encouragement along the way. So our question is as we build this and we take the time to build this this morning and we won't hold you too long is why was the ark lost in the first place? Why was it lost in the first place? And we want to go to 1st Samuel. And I'm going to just go go through these quickly as I can and and uh to try to save time. 1st Samuel chapter 4 verse one. And I'm going to read a few verses here. And it says, "And the word of Samuel came to all Israel." Says, "Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle and pitched besides Ebenezer and the Philistines pitched in Aph. And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines. For they slew of the army in the field about 4,000 men. [clears throat] Interesting thought there. And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies." And I want to start with this question. What had the ark become? What had the ark become? Had the word become something only needed in a crisis. You see, or in a sense, our prayers can turn into what seems like a cosmic vending machine to where God, our prayers only turn into something as in, oh God, I only need you now. We're going to go out. We're going to try to do this, but then let's go fetch the ark. This is what it had become. and and then and and and and then ask and you shall receive mindset. You know what I'm saying? Ask and you shall receive and with lack of revelation of actually what does that mean? Let us just fetch the ark. That great pledge of God's presence and help by whose conduct our ancestors obtain success. That's what this is actually saying. It's like so because it's happened before, right? We know the quote Hebrews 13:8, right? And it's and it's used all the time and we know it's the truth, right? The ark was is the truth. It's the true act presence of God in their midst. But instead of humbling themselves and purging themselves from their sin for which God was displeased with them, they take an easier and cheaper course and put their trust in their ceremonial observances. Right? If we're not careful, Sunday becomes a ceremonial observance. Not doubting, but the very presence of the ark would give them victory. They knew, hey, man, we're we're the message. We've got the word. The word is open. And and we know that with the very word of God in our midst, man, things are going to happen. And and it just became this this, hey, let's just fetch it. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us not to be that way, right? So the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring from then the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubams, and the two sons of Eli, Hoffne, and Phineas were there with the ark of the covenant of God. And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, what did Israel do? Shouted with a great shout, right? So that the earth rang again. Now, why did they do this? Because the ark was in their midst. Because the word was there. So the word was in the camp as before. Then the shout came. Why? Because the word was there. Then we go to the other side of the spectrum to and when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meanth the noise of the great shout in the camp of the Hebrews. I mean remember they had already destroyed a lot of Israelites right and they understood now notice that that's key word they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp. So even the enemy knew the ark is there, right? And the Philistines were afraid because the word was in their midst. For they said, "God is coming." They said, they were testifying, "God is come into the camp." And they said, "Woe unto us, for there hath not been such a thing hereto for. Woe unto us. Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smokeote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the Hey, they had a testimony service. [laughter] They were testifying about what was going on. I mean, we're what's going on here? But then verse 9 comes in and so they they testify of the very things that God had done. But then they come to themselves like, "Hey, hey, be strong. Quit yourselves like men. Be a man. Come on. You're a soldier. You're You're a Philistine. You've already done this. You've already destroyed some of their lives. I'm throwing this in there, but I hope you understand. Oh, you Philistines that you be not servants unto the Hebrews as they have been to you. Quit yourselves like men and fight. And the Philistines fought. And Israel was smitten. And they fled every man into his tent. And there was a very great slaughter for there fell of Israel 30,000. So now we're at 34,000 men that died. 4,000 before the ark was fetched and 30,000 after the ark was in their midst. I I want this to be in my heart. I don't I want this to sink in all of our lives. And the ark of God was then taken and the two sons of Eli Hoffne and Phineas were slain. Let me ask you a question. Why would the church lose with the word of God in their midst? &gt;&gt; Why was it Israel's constant idolatry and sins would lead them to lose the very presence of God? &gt;&gt; Here again lies the information issue. to the issue of thinking themselves as something because they had the ark. &gt;&gt; Right? Listen, if you're we're nothing without God, right? &gt;&gt; But they thought of themselves as something because they shouted when they fetched the ark. So the ark is now in their midst. We have the word. Hey man, we've got the word. The word is open to us and it's in our midst. We know we're the happening church. We're the happening place. and and a shout begins to come up and all of a sudden people start dying &gt;&gt; with the word in the midst. &gt;&gt; This reminds me of Samson. I'll just quote it. Judges 16:20. And he and she said, "The Philistines be upon thee, Samson." And what did he do? And he awoke out of his sleep and said, "I will go out as other times before and shake myself." And he ws not that the Lord was departed from him. I know. Happy Thanksgiving service. We'll get there. As the word was in their midst, signs and wonders so much that even the Philistines were testifying about it. &gt;&gt; Oh, what? Why is the shout this is going on? And and they but they would still lose the ark because of their constant dissatisfaction. constant dissatisfaction. Listen, the Holy Ghost is not here was never meant to make your life comfortable. &gt;&gt; If if if we're only in church to try to make our life comfortable, to make our life feel better, we're in it for the wrong reasons. &gt;&gt; No. If the Holy Ghost is to be a comfort, that means you'd only need comfort for one reason. &gt;&gt; You're going to be going through something. You're going to be going through some trials and tests and sorrows. So, so the the Bible gives us plenty ex examples of why we need the Holy Spirit in our life is because we need that comfort. You see the but I I want to say this. If only a believer would just be a believer. If only Israel would just be Israel, what God had called him to be. And if only we as believers would be what we are supposed to be, to trust and to follow and to be satisfied with his presence and to be satisfied with his word in our midst. if we would only do it without trying to seek for something more outside of the line that God has given us where the prophet said, "Get back in line." Oh, I know I've said this so many times, but it it just strikes me, brother Paul, that that when the prophet cried out, "Get back in line." You know that it doesn't say that she turned around and said, "What do you mean? I I I'm the I'm the I'm the bride. I'm the message." You know, like a, you know, like we act sometimes with God &gt;&gt; when the word's coming forth. Who told you? &gt;&gt; No, she got back in line. She got back in step in step with the word. See, the word do I want to say this. The word will do no good for them. &gt;&gt; It's not meant for them. Thank God for salvation. Hallelujah. But the ark belongs in one place &gt;&gt; to people that will respect it. &gt;&gt; That's right. What did it do? What did the ark do for the Philistines? It caused them disease. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Man, they got rid of it as fast as they could. &gt;&gt; We're done with this &gt;&gt; because it wasn't meant for them. They couldn't handle it. See, you cannot hold to to your traditions and expect the ark to work for you. Their traditions were more important. So, they kicked the word out. &gt;&gt; Hello. Where are we at? What What age are we dealing with here? They kicked the word out. Why? It's not meant for them. It's meant for Come on. I don't want to say you yet. I want you to say it for yourself. But it's not an arrogance. Oh, God help us. So, trying to move through this quickly. The ark was then returned to Israel. Right. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't returned to its rightful place. &gt;&gt; And I like this and I already quoted it, but I want to say it again when brother Brandon mentioned this in the church age book. I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst. Because when we're not sufficiently impressed with it, we're going to always try to seek for more. &gt;&gt; You know what? What happened in the very beginning? Brother Paul, this really this really encourages me. But what what was it that caused the people to ask what how can we get this? The word says they were pricricked in their hearts by what? the word that was being preached, you know, and so and a lot of times we want to skip to the word, skip beyond the word and just get to the emotions of it. But you've got to get through the word first. You've got to get the word. It's got to prick your heart to change you. I want to say this. It wasn't the ark's fault that over 30,000 died. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we cannot say that we've tried it all with the word in our midst while also idolatry is still there. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times you can you can have idols without having idols, &gt;&gt; you know, because you know, we're message believers, right? We don't have idols. &gt;&gt; You know, we were born and raised no idols and then we our own we are our own idol. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes if we're not careful, we we carry that sovereignty far part too far. &gt;&gt; My home is sovereign. &gt;&gt; I'm sovereign. &gt;&gt; That's not in my notes. I should move forward. &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, that's what we do. And we make our own lives an idol, &gt;&gt; right? We want We want to parade how good we are. &gt;&gt; We put our own selves on parade. Isn't that amazing how that works? All right. &gt;&gt; No, we're to clear it all up. &gt;&gt; So, the word should be handled with care and compassion, not in a manner of pride or arrogance. &gt;&gt; The ark was lost after 34,000 total men died in two battles. And again, the ark was never meant to be handled by non-elect and thus was quickly returned and dwelt in uh Kith Jerham, I think, is where it's at. And the ark had now been brought back to Israel, but it was not where it should be. And it seemed to have become nothing more than a relic. &gt;&gt; Just think about that. &gt;&gt; So we see through disobedience Saul was removed and it was now David's leadership. He had come in and now the Bible shows and I want to build up David. The Bible shows David as a man after God's heart. Right? 1st Samuel 13:14. But now the kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart. &gt;&gt; And the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee. So here the Bible says it. David was a man after his own heart. So after this, David being who he was and we're skipping through a lot of things, but he immediately sought after the ark because he knew it should not be where it's at. &gt;&gt; We need it back. He says, "We need the word. We need the ark back." And I'm mixing two different things here. We need the word back, right? We need it back in our midst. It should be at our forefront. It should be in the center of every service. It should be in its belonging it in the places where it belongs. And we're going to go through some quotes here in trying to do God a service without being his will. Says, notice here in our text, notice David, king of Israel, he was the one who got the revelation of bringing the ark of God back to his place. See, uh uh that they never consulted in the days of Saul cuz Saul had backslid. So they never consulted the ark at all, the covenant in the days of Saul because he had backslid and got away from God. So David quickly with inspiration, now notice this. It's a very treacherous text if you don't get it right. Notice David, king of Israel, the king had been freshly anointed the king or elected king. Samuel anointed him by the will of God. I love this. I'm going to drive this point. He was absolutely God's chosen king. No doubt about it. And here he is. And inspiration strikes him. It was revealed to David. He got the revelation. Nobody else had said nothing about it. Let us go and fetch the ark cuz that's the will of God that we have the ark here with us that we consult God by this ark. Very gallant thing. Brother Brandon says, don't you think so? So let's drive this point. Let's look at this. He was called of God, right? He was anointed king, man after God's own heart. We type of Christ in warrior for God, giant slayer, anointed musician, and many other things. What are you saying, brother Jeremy? He was of God. &gt;&gt; But [snorts] remember, brother Bren, I'm continuing here. But him being king and got the revelation, he overstepped his place. &gt;&gt; See, there was a prophet in the land by the name of Nathan. He was the one that was ordained to get the revelation. Said there's anything to be spoke. He said, "The Lord doeth nothing until he reveals it to his servants, the prophet." That's right. &gt;&gt; But you see David being king with the anointing upon him &gt;&gt; says now is that the scripture he's asking this question. I'm asking you. Isn't that scripture? &gt;&gt; He was anointed &gt;&gt; with the anointing upon him. He got a true revelation but it was wrong. &gt;&gt; I want that to be I want that to really sink in. It was a true revelation but it was wrong. &gt;&gt; You see there was a change sweeping through Israel. Right. This is exciting times. We got a new king. We got the guy. And we're going to bring the ark back. And it's time to bring it back. We have the guy to do it. This is the happening place. This is the happening church. We got the preacher. We got the preachers. We got the evangelists. We've got this. It's the happening thing, right? It's moving through the land. This is why we must be careful not to follow just after enthusiasm &gt;&gt; because even feeling led. I get scared sometimes as a pastor when I hear the word I'm feeling led &gt;&gt; because I'm really wondering what kind of lead are you feeling. &gt;&gt; Right. Good point. Whe whether you like it or not, it's a good point. But even feeling led in hearts, many many have been destroyed. &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we have followed the details first. &gt;&gt; Then let the enthusiasm follow it. &gt;&gt; See, just as signs and wonders, what did the Bible are to follow and do not lead the believer. What why did we get to a point where we wanted the signs and wonders to lead us &gt;&gt; when they are to actually follow us? We are to be led by the word of God, right? That's what we are to do. And so, we want that to be in our lives. I'm not against those signs and wonders because I've had them in my own life. I could take your entire day with the things that God has done just for my life and my wife and my family and my church of the things that God has done. But I want to just say this, that's not what holds me. &gt;&gt; It's the word that catches our attention. It's the voice. It's the cry that we hear that said, "There's something about that that's telling me why I shouldn't be in this condition." It's those things that do it. Then after that, then God begins to show himself in wonderful signs and wonders. What if God never did anything like that for you again? Would you still serve him? &gt;&gt; It's a good question to ask &gt;&gt; because a lot of times we want to make a deal with God. &gt;&gt; God, if you'll do this, then I'll do this. Right? We It's like It's like we're striking a deal with God. That's not what the Bible never said. Hey, strike a deal with me. No, trust me. Follow me. &gt;&gt; He said, you got to be willing to take up your cross. I don't know if you know this or not, but the cross is a sign of suffering. &gt;&gt; All right, let's think about this. So, now there's some excitement going on, right? The word is coming back. Here comes the ark. But notice, brother Brandham says who David consulted. Here in the 13th chapter, he said, "But he consulted the captains of thousands and of hundreds back to his congregation." See, said, "Now, don't you think we should do this?" And oh, he said, "But that isn't it." Now, he was trying to do God a service, but he wasn't ordained to do it. See, cuz God had his way. Well, let's read it. Uh 1st Chronicles 13:1 says, "And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, if it seemed good unto you that it be of the Lord our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests, and the Levites, which are in the cities and suburbs, that they may gather them themselves unto us. Oh, here's this. Here's the powerful scripture. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us. That's true. It needs to be in its rightful place. &gt;&gt; For we inquired not add it in the days of Saul and all the congregation said that they would do so. For the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. &gt;&gt; Even in anointing, even in the calling, even in the true revelation, even in inspiration, we can find ourselves in error. This is why we must always stay true to the word of God. &gt;&gt; I will lead you. I will guide you. &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not about that's why that's why brother Paul doesn't come and consult you every service and say, "Hey, what do y'all think we should do every time? How do you want me to preach? Should we do I mean, he might say, "What do y'all want to eat?" That's okay. But when it comes down to it, it's not always going to be the sermon that you think it's going to be &gt;&gt; or any other minister that's here. or the ministries that are in this church. It's not always going to be what what fits our fancy and it shouldn't. Again, it's not about making us feel comfortable. I believe every service should have a challenge of some sort. That doesn't mean that we crack the whip every service and and I I'm not I'm not for those things. I'm for true challenging ministries. That's why that's why your pastor doesn't do that. That's why other true pastors doesn't do that. We want to do what God's will is because we're not here to just create a hype. &gt;&gt; We want the word in our midst, but we want it right. We want a balance to it. We want to care for it. We want to You say, "Care for it?" Yes, we want to care for it. We want to hold it dear to our hearts. It's it's more than just, "Hey, look at me. I've got this and I've done this." No, it's all God. Even when it's not popular, &gt;&gt; and even when you lose friends &gt;&gt; and you lose family, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter. You've got to be willing to forsake all &gt;&gt; and follow Christ. &gt;&gt; And I know it's hard because I'm dealing with humanity. And I know it's hard to not have that friend in your life and to not have that family member. And I've dealt with with my own church who have lost their their mother or their father who has walked away or has cursed them even myself uh uh brother Paul where I I I haven't been able to speak to some of my family for years just because there was so much hatred &gt;&gt; and it just got to a point I just want to be family &gt;&gt; but sometimes you can't &gt;&gt; because the enemy won't let it. So, it's going to test us. Will we be able to make the stand? Let's join David's camp, right? Let's do this. This is where the word is coming back. And the people rejoiced because it was the happening thing. So, here, brother Brandham continues. So, you see David being inspired. Now, you remember I said the anointing and he said the false anointing question. Remember, the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a person and it's still out of the will of God. Man, listen. I I want to say this. This is stirring for me. My grandfather always told me. He said, "Jeremy, just as soon as you think you're somebody, God will come and pull the rug out from underneath you." &gt;&gt; And that's a true story. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to even go further with it. And probably y'all have heard me say this before, too. And this is just me being me. Listen. So, I've always thought, Brother Paul, if if God could use a donkey &gt;&gt; to catch somebody's attention, what does that make me? God will use whatever vessel he will. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you this is I standing here before you that there have been times that I I probably shouldn't have been standing behind here, but it was my time to do so. And I gave my heart to God to do so, but God still use me. And I you know when I always knew something really wasn't right in my life, it was the crash after the sermon. We're always going to come down, &gt;&gt; right? Because we're not always It's the same in the service. &gt;&gt; You ever see somebody, don't look at anybody, but you ever seen, you know, we have a wonderful powerful service and and crying and tears and all kinds of things and it's just wonderful and a great atmosphere and then people walk out after that and they come from that to hear and you don't even want to talk to them. They have the sour look on their face and they're like, I've just been in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're not where you should be. &gt;&gt; I understand we don't live up here, but from here to here, that's not where we should be. And sometimes God allows us to feel the presence just to show you where you really are. &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue here. says now you remember I said that anointing says it uh and still if it's out of the will of God here it proves it right see we have to go through God's way of doing it not our ways God's way of doing it because David being a king anointed anointed with the spirit of God upon him a type of Jesus Christ but that wasn't God's channel when all the congregation it pleased them the Bible said notice captains of thousands of hundreds the priests theologians thought it was wonderful There's your Bible schools and everything else that thought it was wonderful. Even all the people agreed and the priests and all of them agreed that the king's anointing was right. Notice, but God had not promised to reveal his word in its season to them. God his way of revealing his word. Uh uh I'm sorry. God had his way of revealing his word, but not to them. It wasn't through that David. Remember, it was contrary to God. Because if we go this route, if we're not careful, it just becomes simply about our church. &gt;&gt; Our idea. &gt;&gt; Hey, we are the church, right? &gt;&gt; It's a spirit in the land. &gt;&gt; It truly is a spirit in the land. And it's not just a spirit out there. It can be a spirit in our ranks that we are the church. &gt;&gt; We are the camp. We are the one, &gt;&gt; right? And that's not what God intended it to be. And we're not careful. We come back to the Corinthian church ministry. 1 Corinthians 3:3, for ye are yet carnal. Not y'all, but you know. For whereas there is among you envying and strife, I'm sure this doesn't happen, brother Paul. And divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? &gt;&gt; For while one saith, I'm of Paul, and another, I'm of Apollos, are ye not carnal? &gt;&gt; Who then is Paul? &gt;&gt; And who is Apollos? But ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man I have planted, Apollo swattered, but &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; gave the increase. So, it's not about one man. &gt;&gt; I'm going to even say it's not just about uh uh uh William Brandham, but it was God through him. &gt;&gt; That's what caught my attention was the word through the prophet. Listen, it I'm thankful uh uh it wasn't even about my grandfather, though I'm thankful that I come up under that leadership. It was God that led him to speak the word to me. &gt;&gt; So neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that waterth, but God that giveth the increase. Let's skip down to verse 21. Therefore, let no man glory in men. [clears throat] For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Keus or or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours. And ye are &gt;&gt; Christ. Say, I'm Christ. &gt;&gt; Say it like you mean it. I'm Christ. &gt;&gt; And Christ is God. So here we go. In a true and honest zeal for the word because that's what David had. David truly, I believe his heart was right. He wanted the word, the ark back where it belonged. We should have that desire for our homes. We should have that desire for our churches. And I want to say this, it's not just up to the pastor to desire the word in the church, though it is from him. It should be us in a unified body that desires the ark in the midst. Not in the corner, but in the midst. Not only when we want to fetch it when we're in trouble, but in our midst. But here he had a true honest zeal for the word of God and error came and when error came because of his zeal because he went beyond what he was supposed to do. You know the story but I'm going to read it. Let's go to chapter 13 of 1 Chronicles verse 7. says, "And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab and Oza and Ao drove the cart and David and all of Israel played before God and with notice with all their might listen they I can't drive this home so much they were so truly excited. I don't believe brother Paul it was a carnal excitement. I believe they were truly excited because the word was coming back. The ark was coming back. And the Bible tells us that they played with all of their might and with singing and with harps and with sulties and with timberls and with symbols and with trumpets. And when they came unto the threshing floor of of Chiden Oza put forth his hand to hold the ark, another man that desired the right thing. For the oxen stumbled, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Oza, and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark. Therefore, he died before God. &gt;&gt; And again, continuing the quote here, no matter how much your anointing is, you've got to get in God's provided position. David's anointing was all right, he says, but in doing it, he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line. Listen, we and I I I I can't I'm not going to speak for brother Paul or any other minister. We have to be careful ourselves in ministries that we don't become enthused, so enthused that we're caught up with with ideas and and movements and things. Even though we can see mighty miracles happening, &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that I keep my eyes on where God wants me &gt;&gt; and my purpose of my life and my purpose for my church and what God See, God might be dealing with you differently in this area. It's the same word, same arc, but God might be dealing with you differently here and then God is using me in my church, you know, the same way or differently over here. But because it's it it's everybody is so tied together now. And I don't want to say why, but we're tied together now. It's like we all have to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; And if you don't do what I do, you're not in it. &gt;&gt; And because of that, we're enthused and and we step over our bounds. And I'm not saying that they don't have a heart for God. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to dec uh how do you call it? Decchristian them or Christianify, whatever you want to call it. put your own word there. I don't want to do that to them. I don't want to do that to anybody. But I want to say we've got to be careful that we don't follow after the enthusiasm because here what David did being anointed of God, true king, prophet, everything that you could say David was. And now he caused death. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He stepped over the boundary line. And instead of putting the ark in its original position, he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites. It was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites, which is over the heart. &gt;&gt; The word is not in the mind. It's in the heart. &gt;&gt; When we lose our heart, because we're so caught up in enthusiasm and excitement, I'm for that. Listen, I want you to understand in the balance here, you're looking at somebody that loves enthusiasm and loves excitement and loves worship and all of those things. But if I lose my heart because I'm looking for the next big excitement. &gt;&gt; Listen, why did this not affect the Philistines? Because it wasn't given to them. &gt;&gt; They didn't have to obey the word like you do. Right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that because you think about it. They carried it on and no one died in that sense. See, this was not a law given to them. &gt;&gt; This is why we cannot compare other churches, other people, other denominations, other situations because you're held accountable for the word that has been open to you in this hour. &gt;&gt; It's been given to the elect. This is how we should this is him saying this is how you should carry my word. So I cannot look at the religious world and expect it to work the same for us, right? However that church is doing, maybe the the church across the street or the church over here, it however it's working for them, they can come in and the rain falls on the just and the unjust. There's worship. There's excitement. There's all of those things. But God has called us, you and us, you and I, to carry the word over our hearts. God requires his elect lady to love his word enough &gt;&gt; to follow through. &gt;&gt; It's because we are accountable. &gt;&gt; I'm not a guy that says a lot of repeating, but I want you to say this. You can even in your heart. I'm accountable. &gt;&gt; I'm accountable because I want I want you to understand God has confidence in his word in your life. Here we go. Notice notice by doing this he caused the death. Oh this this hurts of a sincere man putting his hand on the ark when he shouldn't have done it. A great sincere man think the anointing and everything was just right but the ark was moving in its wrong way. The Bible uh the oxen the Bible said stumbled not the Levites. The oxen stumbled and the cart was being pitched over. And a sincere man with his heart full of love put his hand upon the ark to hold it back and was stricken dead because no man could touch the ark but a Levite. See how God keeps his word, keeps his channel, keeps his order. Uzziah was smitten with leprosy. Here is David altogether caused the death of a man and a great disaster being anointed with the spirit both of them but out of God's channel. &gt;&gt; So here is where we see the true anointing of David. This is where we see who David was brother Paul. He was an error &gt;&gt; and he caused the death, &gt;&gt; but he did not keep digging a pit &gt;&gt; to try to lift himself up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm king and it is what it is and I'm anointed. No, David was a man of repentance. &gt;&gt; And he went right back to the word. He went right back. What was I supposed to do? Listen, this tr this shows who you really are. When you realize, I am an error. I might need to fix something in my home or I might need to fix something this and and and and sometimes we think of it as big things and becomes overwhelming in our life. And when it becomes overwhelming, we don't do it right. &gt;&gt; It's like that project you've been putting off for so long because it seems overwhelming, but all you got to do is start and it will get done. And sometimes the enemy wants to make the corrections in our lives seem impossible. But go back to the word. Go back to it and it'll correct you and it'll bring you right and it'll should bring us to as believers to repentance. Oh God, I was wrong and and I and and I allowed this in my home and he was a man of repentance and he went right back to the word. And I would believe perhaps brother Paul that he went and spent some time with the prophet &gt;&gt; to get that word in order. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want I want to remind you we should keep listening &gt;&gt; to what the message is saying. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we need to go back. Well, I've listened to that. How many times have we listened to doing God a service, right? And every time we go back, brothers and sisters, we catch something else and we catch something. Brother Paul might be preaching on love a thousand times. And you're like, "You going to preach on love again?" Yeah. Until we start to love. I guarantee you if we can just get it through our thick heads. I don't know if that's a good thing to say here. It's okay in Texas. But if we can just get it that that God wants us to to not just look for the big things, but simply loving one another, showing that love and and believing the word and trusting the word and living the word, not living law, not living legalism, but living the word. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So I believe that he spent time with the prophet. I believe he spent time. What did I do wrong? Where did I go wrong here? Now it's time to bring it back. Verse 15:1. And David made him houses in the city of David and prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched for it a tent. Then David sent none. Here it is. Then David said,"None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites." &gt;&gt; Thank God for a man of God &gt;&gt; that brings correction to his own mistake. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now what he's doing, he's speaking the word. &gt;&gt; For them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God and to minister unto him forever. Now we can see as the word of God was brought in its true form, there was sanctification in the church. God will bring sanctification again through the church. The church will have to go through season and it'll go through times where you will feel like I I I just feel like it's I'm always getting sanctified and I'm I'm always getting this. But it's a season that we go through to try to bring correction in our lives. And because listen, brothers and sisters, I don't want to go all the way to the end and miss it on one little tiny error. &gt;&gt; And I know I can tell you, God's not going to let me in because of who I am if I miss out one part of it. I need to trust his word of God and live it with all of my life. [snorts] Once David went from fear because remember he went into fear and repentance. I like this. He went from fear and repentance and then he went to full worship mode. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on. You can't you can't lay in that past all your life. &gt;&gt; It's time to shake yourself. get back into the word of God and come out of those things and get back to worship, but don't get to worship until you get the word right. &gt;&gt; And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, uh Mikall uh uh Saul's daughter looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart. I mean, here we go again. I mean, we [snorts] can't work. Moving on. Verse 20. Then David returned to bless his household. And Mikuel, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet David and said, "How glorious." Oh, you know, this was not uh you know, this was a little bit of a chastening from someone who didn't know who God was. &gt;&gt; How glorious was the king of Israel today. Can you just hear that? Snarky. who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmmaids and his servants. You were I mean you are a fool, right? As one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncoverth himself. And David said unto me, it was before the Lord who chose me before thy father &gt;&gt; and before all his house to appoint me ruler. See, now he had something to back it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Now he's getting right back to what happened and the word of God. And to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel. Therefore will I play before the Lord. I ain't doing it for you. &gt;&gt; That's why when we sing, we're not singing for you. &gt;&gt; We're singing for the Lord. When we worship, we're not worshiping for you. We're worshiping for the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I will yet pretty this is pretty potent right here. And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight. and of the maid servants which thou has spoken of them shall I be had in honor. Therefore, Mika, the daughter of Saul, had no child until the day of her death. &gt;&gt; Listen, she could not produce life because she criticized the move of God. &gt;&gt; Don't don't if listen, I want to just say this. If we if we find ourselves not producing life, we need to look back and say, "Lord, what have I said? &gt;&gt; What have I done?" &gt;&gt; And move back. Repent of it, right? Go to the place you did. And God will give you that life. But you've got to bring correction. She did not bring forth life because of what she said. &gt;&gt; So, we must be careful that we do not criticize the move of God and the joy that are in the churches. Because there's death on both sides of this thought. &gt;&gt; We got people throwing stones at other people. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. It's always seems to be happening because one person thinks that we we we uh sing too much. We got too much joy. Listen, brother Paul, if they knew what God did for me, they would have the joy that I would have in my heart. Listen, and it's more than just a a toetapping song. This is a change song. This is a life that has been changed by God. If you knew what God did for me, you would understand why I'm here today, right? Oh, I love that. Don't you? You would say the same to me because God, it is God that has brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light. What we need is a full revealing of the love of God. &gt;&gt; Because we were not just called back to the gifts or justification or sanctification. With all that we have in the church, what is it that we need the most? with all of the things that we have. 1 Corinthians 12:31 says, "But covet earnestly the best gifts, and yet show I unto you a more excellent way." I I I I held off a lot of scriptures here for the sake of time. I don't know where we are, but we're getting close. Verse 13 of chapter 13. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of these is charity. &gt;&gt; Notice the prophet of God in our day. Think about this in in a in our days of greatest the greatest moments, the opening of the word, the seals open, the mighty God power of God revealing. And yet see what he says here in standing in the gap. He says, "And these Rickys and Ricettas that have so sassed the word said, "And I've called them Ricky and Ricetta, but God give me to understand I shouldn't do that." &gt;&gt; That's right. because that's many of them are still his children. &gt;&gt; They can't help because they act so much different. And I'm going to skip down now. He says, "And I wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere." Moses lost his feeling of his people &gt;&gt; because they wouldn't listen to him. And now I cannot go with a ministry like that until I feel different in my heart &gt;&gt; about it. No matter if God did tell me something's got to change me. The prophet of God said this, "Something's got to change me because I in my heart, if I go out there feeling the way I do now, I still feel that I ought to have uh that they ought to have heard that message. They ought to have done it. And I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have. Until I get that feeling, there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite." He said he needed a little change. &gt;&gt; Could I say God help us to come to that? &gt;&gt; Help me Lord as a pastor to not lose the feeling of my people. &gt;&gt; Help me as a father &gt;&gt; to not lose the feeling for my own family. We get so so tied in knots and so worn down and tired and we get so and I get it because who's not in life, right? That we could we can lose the feeling for our spouse, for our children because we just we just they just don't understand what I'm going through. And if they would only listen. And here the prophet of God said, "I I can't I can't go out and do that. I need my heart changed." And I want to say this, if he said it, we are not too good to say the same. &gt;&gt; God, we need a change in our heart. I need a change in my heart. I don't want to lose the feeling. I don't want to just go through the motions. I just we've got, you know, we've got to do this and we've got to do this and and and and and then forget the heart of the matter. Continue. He says, "Now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people, I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at." He says, "And if you want to get somewhere with God, never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you. &gt;&gt; Don't let no malice come in. No matter what anybody does, if they're wrong, don't you never build up a complex against that person. &gt;&gt; You be sweet and kind. Remember, God loved you. Oh, &gt;&gt; when you were in sin. &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of God is in you, you love the other person when he's wrong. See, just pray for them and love one another. But what we want to do is we want to we have to prove that they're wrong and that I'm right. But that's not what God's saying. &gt;&gt; Let God do it. Remember, I'm not the savior of my family. He is. I'm not the savior of the church. He is. I'm just a vessel that he will use. &gt;&gt; Above everything, love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us. And it's hard telling what he will do. Usually when a church begins to get in numbers and getting to a little bigger or something like that, they get away from that real thing. And I want to say I feel love here. I feel the heart. And I thank God for that that you feel those things. and and and and and it's been wonderful to minister you because I feel a pull and a desire for the word of God. But I know even in that there's hurting hearts &gt;&gt; and we've seen perhaps error in revelation and it's brought confusion in our minds and it's made us lose trust and it's made us lose confidence. But God is still on his throne and God will not lose one of his. He won't lose you. He won't lose uh uh any one of his. And so I hold to that. But I don't have a confidence in listen I don't have confidence in myself. I have confidence in his calling and in his election for my life. You don't have confidence in yourself but you have confidence in his calling for you. &gt;&gt; There's no power in pride &gt;&gt; because p pride seeks constant recognition &gt;&gt; and if no recognition then we begin to force the issue and there's no godly power in that. [snorts] you stay humble and be that little humble elect lady ministered a sermon years ago lady in waiting and just just the thought of her she he said I'm going to come back for you and let them mock around her let them say what they're going to say around her but you stay that humble little lady you do your things you do your chores you do your life all while listening to the word of God and stay humble and they're going to come and they're going to mock you and they're going to say things and it's going to hurt and it's going to break your heart and there's going to be error all around you, but you stay focused on his words. &gt;&gt; Remove all the error in true revelation. Stay humble. I think it might be good for us sometime perhaps you've listened to it this week but the humility the sermon humility is it was it titled humility I think it was I think it's a really short one but it's a beautiful one all of them are beautiful but there's just something about going back and being reminded God help me to stay humble I want to stay humble let's bow our heads musicians can come Lord Jesus Lord I ask that you'd forgive me, Lord, if I said anything out of the way, but may your presence, Lord, that is here and working in our hearts, Lord. All we want is our heart to be in line with you. Lord, I I don't want to to come to a a place in a position where I'm having to prove anything. Lord, I just want to stay in your word. And God, if I've gotten an error before, if I if I've messed up, Lord, and let me be let me be the bride to come and say, "Lord, I'm sorry. I want to stay in line with you." That's how I can be thankful is because when I keep trying to to prove something, I I lose my thankfulness. I lose thanksgiving. But Lord, when I can just simply come back and know that my heart is open to you and nothing's in the way and everything's open and free, Lord, then you can deal with me. And if there's something in my life, Lord, or in our lives that's wrong, maybe we've lost the feeling of our family. Maybe we've lost the feeling of of a church service. Maybe we've been hurt and broken. Whatever it is, Father, Lord, you're here this morning and you're willing, Lord. You've already given us healing. We We just got to step into it. May we come this morning in your presence and see what you can do, Lord. I'm not looking for as it were mighty miracles Lord and say this this Lord but just the simpleness sometimes of a still small voice in our hearts church I want to just say this as our heads are still bowed can you hear his voice in your heart there's a song in word of God speak I love that song but it says I'm finding myself in the midst of you. Beyond the music, beyond the noise and all that I need is to be with you. &gt;&gt; And in the quiet, &gt;&gt; I hear your voice. Why is that important? Because there's so much noise going on around us. So much noise. And it's trying to grab at our attention. is the the the bills, the debts, the the sicknesses, the the [music] job questions, the the children, the the spouse, all of these things is just grabbing at our attention, and we lose our desire. We lose our enthusiasm. We come to church, we go through the motions, but all he wants you to do right now, can you find yourself in the midst of his word? Would you have an honest heart this morning? We're going to sing this, but I don't want this to just be a song that we sing and oh, it's good. But I want this to be a message. I want you to find yourself before we turn it to brother Paul. I want you to find yourself in his presence and see what he has to say for you. And what is it, Lord? Lord, whatever it is, whatever it is you have for me, I want to I want to do it, Lord. Would can you have that open heart as your heads are are bowed? If you want to say, "Lord, I have something. I have a need. Brother Jeremy doesn't know, but you know, and I want to give it to you this morning. [music] I maybe it's my heart just needs to be refreshed. Maybe I just need that humbleness. God, you're doing what only you can do." And it's that simple. Because not Jeremy, not brother Paul, not brother Rap, not not brother uh Brandon, nobody, but God speaks and he pricks your heart. [music] It's the word that pricks it. Could we stand together and worship now? What? [music] Kiran, brother, can you do B for me? Yeah. I'm finding myself at a loss for [music and singing] words. And the funny thing is it's okay. The [music] last thing I need [singing] is to be heard. Here it is. Bun [music and singing] to hear. Oh, what you would say. [music] Word [singing] of God speak. Would you pour down like [singing] rain? Washing [music] my eyes to see your majesty to be [music] still [singing] and know that you're in this place. Here it is. Please [music] let me stay and rest in your holiness. [singing] Word of God speak. [music] Can you find yourself here now? I'm finding myself Lord in the midst [singing] of you. Beyond the music. Oh yes Lord. be on [music and singing] the noise. And all that I need, [music] oh, [singing] is to be with you. Yes, Lord. And in the quiet, [music] Lord, yes, I hear your voice, [singing] the word of God speak. [music] Would you pour down like [singing] rain, washing my eyes to see [music and singing] your majesty to be [singing] still and know [music] that you're in this [singing] place. Please let me stay [singing] and rest [music] in your home. Sing it again now. The [singing] word of God speak. Would you pour down [singing] like [music] rain? Washing my eyes to see your majesty. To be [music and singing] still and know that you're in this [music] place. Please let me stay [singing] and rest [music] in your holiness. Word of God [music] speak. Hallelujah. When he is in our midst, things change, &gt;&gt; right? Aren't you glad for that change? [music] Please don't don't just leave this place this morning under the normal circumstances. Make sure that God has affected your heart. That's our [music] purpose of being here because we want God to move more than anything else. We want him to move. And I want to turn to brother Paul, but I want to sing one more if that's okay. It's a song that I love to sing and we [music] might sing it differently. That's one thing I've learned about churches. You go to different churches like we don't sing it that way. But uh key of A, I believe, brother, it's my desire. I've always loved this song. [music] It's my desire to live for Jesus. It's my desire to [music and singing] be just like him. Though often I failed him. Though [music and singing] often I failed him and brought him much shame and brought him much shame. It's my desire. It's [singing] my desire to live for him. I'm going to sing the second verse now. It's [music] my desire. It's my desire to help [music] someone today. To [singing] help someone today, [music] someone who [singing] may have failed to see the way, to [music and singing] see the way. For I too was once lost. I too [singing] was [music] once so lost till I found my way to God. Till I found [singing] my way to God. It's my [music] desire. It's my desire [singing] to live for him. [music and singing] more. If you could see, if you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today. [music and singing] Oh, then you would know the reason [music and singing] why I love him. So, do you love [music] him now? &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Now you can take [music] this world, all its wealth [singing] and riches. [music] I don't need earth's fame. It's my desire [singing] to live [singing] for him. Let's sing that chorus one last time as we turn it now. Oh, if you [music] could see where [singing] Jesus brought. Hasn't he brought you from a lot to where I am today? Oh, [singing] then you would know the reason [music] why I love him. So mean it now. Now you [music] can take this world all its wealth [singing] and riches. [music] I don't need to live for him. [singing] If you could see [music] where Jesus brought me from [music] to where I am today, you [music] would know the reason why I love him. [music and singing] soul. You can [music and singing] take this world. Your wealth and riches [music] I don't need. It's free. It's my desire to live in just one chorus. I'm coming [singing] back to the heart of worship and it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. And I'm [music] sorry, Lord, the thing I made and it's all about you. [music] It's [singing] all about you. I'm coming back. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. All about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. And I'm sorry, [singing and music] Lord, for the things I made. All about [singing and music] you. It's all about you, Jesus. God bless you today. I couldn't say enough about the word of God, how it's ministered personally to me this [music] weekend and this morning. Um, I guess I would I stand amazed. I stand in awe of the manner and the discernment that the Lord is speaking to sons that [music] are called to be adopted sons, called to come to maturity. And that never ceases to amaze [music] me how personal and how accurate God wants us to have stuff. And it's not that [music] we make it accurate. It's our heart given to him that he would make it accurate. to hear a service [music] that is so uh discerning to say that you could have true anointing and actually [music] a true revelation that the ark is supposed to come back and yet there be a margin of air in there related to our hearts. It it makes me sober to say Lord let my heart be aligned with this great word that you've given us. Maybe that's why we've had some issues [music] all some issues some major issues the last 60 years since the word has been restored to us is maybe this is getting down to a simple thing what Jesus said we don't want to be that people who honors him with our lips but our heart is far from him and for him to come and speak this way and just the manner he's been showing us [music] of our our temples and you know, um, moving us from just being anointed beyond just an anointing, a temporal anointing. And there's nothing wrong in ano with an anointing, but moving us as sons and daughters beyond just an anointing to a heart that's actually holding that ark inside with respect and with reverence and with obedience. Maybe that's what we've been missing. And I don't know about you, but the word is [music] ministering to me in such levels that he never has before. And I I just lay my life before him. I want more love. I want more. I want more of his power, but I want the things within me that let his power manifest [music] on its own the way that he wants to manifest it. So, we appreciate deeply the word of God, Brother Jeremy, this morning. We appreciate, you know, God can take a man like this through 20, 30 years. He grew up in the message. God can take a man through a whole lifetime and maybe years of ministry and trials on his own to bring one sermon like this &gt;&gt; and we all get the benefit of it. God can mold things in a man that long to bring it this [music] way. And so we ought to say, "Thank you, Lord." That's the way he does things to bring it just this way. That's our God. That's our God. [applause] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. just um as we I want to sing a song before we go because when we got to the end of this, David got it right and he danced before the Lord and uh was criticized for that. We ought to be careful when we criticize when somebody gets really free and they get sanctified and they really repent. You see, it's not just saying I'm sorry. It's showing fruits of repentance, fruits of your life being sanctified. That means you've really repented. If you repent and you go back to the same things, that's not repentance. you don't have repentance. But when it's really repentance, God's sanctifying your lives. And then then the real joy comes. Then the real enthusiasm comes. And when David got it right, he danced. And I want to sing that in a minor. It's in a minor. Whatever you got there in a minor chord. When the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart, I will sing like David sang. I will dance like David danced. When you exit today, when you dismiss, please go out this door so we don't crowd where the food's being prepared. go out these [music] doors and go around the building for our potluck today. If you would do that. And then one other announcement would [music] you would you please wash your own crockotss today so we can keep all those lids and everything together. Please wash your own crockpot. Don't [music] leave it for someone else to do. We'd certainly appreciate that. And uh I think that is it. Enjoy the fellowship today. Enjoy your time together. And uh we have been blessed this morning to hear the true pure word of God. and and I love him so much. I love the Lord what he's done. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord, that you've been a father to me. [music] You're a father to sons and daughters. I sat at the edge of my [music] seat today, Lord, shutting everything else out. Who's here? Who's not here? There's even troubles sometimes that [music] burdens on my heart as a pastor. But Lord, I just shut it out all out and I sit at your feet like Mary did, Lord. And and Martha rebuked [music] her and said, "You need to be do working. You need to be serving." And Jesus, you said [music] Mary chose the better part just to sit and listen to the master. I thank you Lord this morning to sit at your feet. Teach me, mold me, make me Lord. And then Lord, after you've fashioned us the way you want us, [music] then the true joy and true true fellowship and true love and true enthusiasm, true enthusiasm, [music] it comes, Father, because this is not a dead religion. [music] This is a resurrected savior. We thank you, Father, in Jesus name. Everybody said, "Amen." Praise the Lord. I love him so you got that song up. When the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart, I will dance like David. [music and singing] When the spirit of [music and singing] the Lord comes upon my heart, I will dance like David. [music] I will dance. [music] I will dance. [singing] I will dance like David. [music] Oh, I will dance. Yes, I [music] will dance. I will dance like David. Couple more verses before you go. When the [music and singing] spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart, I will pray like David [music] prayed. When the spirit of the Lord comes upon [music and singing] my Oh, I will like David [music] pray. Sing it now. Oh, I will. I will pray. I will pray. [music] [singing] Yes, I will pray. [music] I will pray. I will pray. [music] Just a tambourine. Just a tambourine. Sing it now. When the spirit of the Lord [singing and music] comes upon my heart, I will sing. Like David [singing and music] said, play that tambourine song. The spirit of the Lord [singing] comes upon my heart. I will like David. [singing] sing. Oh, I will sing. [music] I will sing. I will sing. Like, [music] yes, I will sing. I will sing. [music] I will see. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. [music] Bless. I will dance. I will [music] dance. I will dance. I will dance. [music] I will dance. [music] Yes, I will dance. I will dance. [music] [applause] [music] Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. Blessed be his name. You know the way brother Brandham was said it is when David was [music] dancing and that wife was criticizing him. He said, "You think that's something? Look at this." And he went in and did another dance in the Lord. When you're unashamed, you're unashamed. Can you say amen? You don't care what about about what people think. I know what God's doing in my heart. Only I know. Praise the Lord. And I'm going to dance before the Lord. God bless you as you're dismissed this morning. if we can do anything to help you. The greatest way that [music] you can be helped is if you'll listen to what's being said over the pulpit. God's answering a lot of questions. God's dealing with a lot of things because he knows your hearts. He knows your lives. Amen. But if we can do anything else to help [music] you, we would certainly be glad to do that. God bless you. Shake one another's hands as you go today and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh enjoy the fellowship together uh in this Thanksgiving time. Enjoy your families. We won't have a service here Wednesday night with our families this week. [music] So, we'll cancel our service Wednesday night. We'll be back here Sunday at 10:30 for Sunday school. When the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart, I will dance like David. When the prayer comes upon my heart, [music] I will dance like David. Oh, I [music] will dance. I will dance. I [music] will &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
