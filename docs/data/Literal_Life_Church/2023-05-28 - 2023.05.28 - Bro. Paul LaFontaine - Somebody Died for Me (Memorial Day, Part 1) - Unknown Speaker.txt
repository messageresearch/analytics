TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Corinthians 15 and verse 1 is where we want to read and we'll just allow the Lord to take over this morning and do whatever he wants in this service God bless you I hope I didn't miss any of the announcements I always go home and feel like I have guilt that I forgot somebody or something so if I forgot you this morning God bless you God doesn't forget amen God doesn't forget First Corinthians 15 and verse 1. moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved so the gospel that he preached brings salvation that's how they were saved if the gospel is not preached people can't be saved but when the gospel is preached the good news then people are saved by which also you're saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain and what that means is that if you really believed it not superficially not just in your head but from your heart if you really believe this then you are saved and also you are you you should keep it in your memory the things that I've preached to you how many know it's important to keep the word of God in your memory and keep that's why we come to church to bring things into remembrance uh tomorrow is Memorial Day and there's a certain time we give to remember what's been done I want to talk a little bit about that this morning what Memorial Day means not just for this country but also for Christians God has memorials for us and God wants us to remember what he's done for us amen and keep the word of God in our memory keep reminding us of the word of God but verse 3 says for I delivered for I delivered unto you the first first of all that which I also received and what he means there is that this is the most important thing this is top priority uh for I delivered unto you first of all before anything before anything I preached first of all that which also I received in other words what God gave me I gave you how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures the first thing that Paul said I brought to you and the most important thing is somebody died for you and if we skip to the other parts and miss this part we're missing something essential to the Christian walk can you say Amen my title this morning is somebody died for you somebody died for you I'm going to read that verse again I delivered unto you the priority first of all before all things that which I received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures can we pray together Lord Jesus thank you Lord for this opportunity for to the people of God to gather together and Lord we pray that your anointing would fall upon our lips this morning Father we stand as a man but Lord we stand as a minister of the gospel and Lord the things that we handle Lord must be handled with Clean Hands the things that we handle in your word must be handled right Lord and if we put our own agenda to it our own motive to it it's wrong father if I have just my own thing that I want to push that's wrong but Lord Jesus when you can take a vessel over and give the gift back to your church then many lives can be affected for the kingdom there'll be salvations there'll be holy ghost fillings there'll be people healed and Lord God we see it happening overseas and we see it here last Sunday as you over and over again Lord people's Faith raised to the place to believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and there isn't a cancer there isn't death there isn't somebody being paralyzed there's nothing Lord that would stand in the way of a Believer just simply believing if God did it again if God did it in the past he can do it again and Lord that's the faith we want in your word this morning for these signs shall follow them that believe this word we place it in your hands we pray you will affect everyone that's in the service this morning and those that are listening as we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask him and everybody said amen amen praise the Lord thank you Lane for that big amen I'll need those later give me some more of those God bless you may be seated I appreciate the faith last Sunday as brother Matt was bringing and showing those cancer patients completely delivered and showing the pictures of it and just Rose your faith I was very proud of the congregation how that we didn't have to force any kind of prayer line but Faith dropped in your heart to believe that all things are possible I would like to hear those testimonies back if you have them this week if God has delivered you or brought you anything that came from that I'd certainly like to hear it because I like to testify of it and give the devil a black eye God is doing some wonderful things but just the faith that came in the people uh people believe in for any little thing or any big thing it didn't matter when God raises our faith that way all things are possible praise the Lord as as I just like to speak a little bit this morning on someone died for me and I want to we realize that tomorrow is a holiday uh Memorial Day and that was set up since 1971 our country set it up as a national holiday and I would say that I guess like with most holidays over time the new generation especially begins to lose the purpose and the meaning of the holidays it happens almost with every good holiday that we're really not celebrating the true thing of what it meant years ago the new generation tends to lose the being connected with the meaning of it so some of my sermon this morning will be just letting everyone know what Memorial Day means and what it uh what it what it was started for and there was another holiday that went on from years before that but then they changed it and so since 1971 uh there's a there's a meeting behind this holiday tomorrow and quite often we get together for our hot dogs and hamburgers and if that's happening of course I'm there I'm not going to miss it but through all of our you know any holiday can lose its purpose Christmas has certainly lost its purpose and its meaning can you say Amen July 4th and and you can just say all of the all most of the holidays and and I hate that Thanksgiving kind of gets lost in the shuffle of turkey and different things because we miss the meaning of it and what the purpose was and why it was set for a memorial can you say Amen we we tend to We tend to uh lose the meaning of something and and there's when we take something and turn it into something else it loses its immediate meaning and it loses loses a feeling to it uh there's a natural disconnect in the new generation from the meaning and even the power of something because sometimes something can have a meaning to it and An Origin to it but sometimes when we are connected to the meaning of it it has a power with it to affect our lives today when we're connected with something the way it started especially God's word and when he did something in the past when we connect let me just bring this when you connect with the Lord Jesus Christ and his word truly connect in your heart and with what he did at Calvary when you connect with that it has an effect on your life today it has a power that goes with it and so uh we we tend to become disconnected and there's a saying that I use that comes from Rush Limbaugh he applied it to the the Democrats but I will not do that this morning because I think it's a great statement he attached to the Democrats but I attach it to Christianity Today and to many other things he said that it becomes symbolism over substance and he was saying that some people it becomes something becomes a symbol something in history just becomes a symbol and we celebrate the symbol and we celebrate some distant thing that took place but we miss the substance of what It produced we miss the substance that what it really means to us how many can safely say in Christianity that that the church as a whole loses the power of the Cross can you say Amen but they're celebrating the cross they're singing about the cross but you can lose the power of the Cross and what it does in our lives people talk about Jesus Christ at Christmas they talk about his birth oh yes he was born God came to Earth but there ought to be a revelation behind that affects our lives that today I'm living because of what happened in the past I'm living in the power of what took place in the past I'm living in the meaning of it can you say it means something to me because he's done something through the work of the cross two thousand years ago I'm feeling the effects of that can you say man and if that doesn't happen then we become symbolism over substance we don't have the substance of what it means we don't have the reality of the Holy Ghost and what this Bible is to produce as the Holy Ghost and that's a tragedy because then it becomes religion and religion isn't working anymore I'll say that for the world I'll say it for our own ranks religion isn't working anymore matter of fact it never did really work but people are discovering that even when they have the religion of this and the movement of the message it's not enough it has to be a personal relationship with Christ and the power God hates a powerless religion did you know that God hates a powerless religion God hates symbolism over substance God hates that is resurrection and his crucifixion and the power of what he brought he hates that it becomes just a symbol in people's lives God hates a powerless Church that God loves to see his power manifested in lives on an everyday basis symbolism over substance some things have a a powerful impression and affect our lives and when we really understand the meaning of it we've become connected with the results of it and it's like Christ dying to take our sin away that statement as is read in the scripture he said how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures there was an effect Christ died for us somebody died for us but what's the effect to take our sin to take our sin if we lose the meaning of that then we're caught with our sin and the soul that sinneth it shall die so what the Bible says if you're not delivered from your sin the soul that sinneth it will die there's no future to that it ends someday but the effect of Christ someone dying for us has a a residual effect and even up until last week and the week before watching lives transformed we're seeing that the blood the the one who died for us we're still seeing the effect in people's lives in young people being changed just a few weeks ago a young person breaking down before their parents and saying I need God I need to be baptized it doesn't have to be in church but we're still seeing the effects of the blood of Jesus Christ somebody died for us but what good is it to talk about it if we don't have our sins released from us [Applause] what good is the message of the hour unless we see the powerful effect of Jesus Christ coming from the message of the hour and that's not just a feeling that's not just an emotion that's not just dancing in the spirit it's the power to live a life it's the power to overcome demons it's the power to overcome habits it's the power to overcome pornography it's the power I'm talking about Calvary somebody died for us and in that is the power to overcome can you say Amen the power to overcome fornication the power to overcome adultery the power to overcome any demon Spirit Satan bring the best of your spirits to us and the power of Calvary can deliver that person from it [Applause] Memorial Day is a day to I didn't know if you the young people knew it they probably do but I'm reminding us of that day Memorial Day is is to remember ones who have died in military service throughout history and they died for a reason thank God they died for a reason and that is they died to preserve our Liberty they died to preserve our unity in our country to preserve the Liberties that we enjoy you see the new generations we tend to let our liberties become common someone will get 16 17 years old and they'll be given a a car and and they can go and come and drive places and so but see there are some countries or some places we can come to church today still in Liberty I don't know how much longer those Liberties will be left but I can tell you as long as I've got it before they shut these doors I want to be here every time the doors are open because that's a liberty that I'm enjoying and there's many countries that don't have that Liberty they can't worship the way they want to worship but in our country there's been millions of lives that have been given somebody died that you could come in your car this morning and nobody told you what to do nobody told you to come to church or not go to church nobody dictated you pretty much live in those Liberties I can go to the store I can go here I can go do I do I'll say something about covet though I will say something kovid was a a the first step towards moving toward is a communist control that comes over our lives that you're going to do this you're not going to do that and all in the name of covet for the safety of all mankind you better have the discernment to know where that was going because that was the first set to me to engage in in the minds of the people that for the safety of all we all need to join in with this and you need to do this matter of fact you have to do this oh that's not popular there's not many amens to that and I can't even hear him on the streaming I can't even hear the amens that's not very popular but I'm going to tell you something there is scripture that shows that there's a control that you can't buy or sell unless you bought into that image into the beast that's coming and it's closer than you think but the people's minds have to be prepared for it so controlling but listen today you didn't have anybody tell you not to come to church young people you didn't have told me about you couldn't drive your car to church you have Liberties here and I want to tell you you have them because there's been hundreds of thousands of lives that have died so you could have Liberty this morning and that's what Memorial Day is about tomorrow it's the memorial not of one's uh not of ones that have served in the military that's Veterans Day this is one who have died to preserve our Liberty to keep us safe from tyrants to keep us safe from terrorists so we can live in a free country people have died for that and when many of them signed up for it signed up for the military service to go fight in wars and they signed up knowing that they may die for it that's bravery to sign up to realize I can lose my life over this but if they did it for the right intentions not to just become some He-Man but they did it for the right intentions they did it because I'm willing when I sign off on this I'm willing to give my life I may not come back home but I'm doing it for my country and I'm doing it for the future preservation of Liberty and so that other ones could live I'll die so they can live who's that sound like to you our Lord and savior I'll go to this cross so they can live in Victory I'll go and take this death so that they can live every day in the power God doesn't want us to die for him he wants us to live for him in the power of the Holy Ghost is that okay with everybody so I want us to think about this a minute and how special that is how special it is when because we lose the feeling it was I want you to and this might be very basic to somebody maybe you were looking for something deeper this morning but I want you to think about how special it is when someone dies so that you can enjoy something in the future that we are living in certain Liberties still today different than other countries lives were taken lives were uh blood was shed can you say Amen blood was shed young people blood a lot of blood was shed for your Liberties tomorrow it's Memorial Day for the blood that was shed and people gave their lives so that you can enjoy your day of hot dogs and hamburgers and volleyball with nobody stepping in and taking say you can't do this people gave their lives for that they shed blood for that their lives were ended lives that could have come home and enjoyed their freedoms but they didn't come home they died and you still have your life there's something about that that it should never become common to us I said it should never become common to us that somebody died so I could live that part should never become common to us the power of a life-giving affecting the future I forgot to read this on Mother's Day or if I read it right now and you say he did read that on Mother's Day then you know I'm having trouble with remembering things but I think I forgot this I think I forgot you see I don't have Alzheimer's I have Alzheimer's I remember half of it I thought this was an amazing Story related to our subject today years ago a young mother was making her way across the Hills of South Wales carrying her tiny baby in her arms when she was overtaken by a blizzard a blinding blizzard she never reached her destination when the blizzard had subsided her body was found by Searchers beneath a mound of snow but they discovered that before her death she had taken off all of her outer clothing and wrapped it around her baby when they unwrapped the child to their great surprise and joy they found he was alive and well she had mounded her body over his and given her life for her child proving the depths of her mother love years later that child David Lloyd George grown to manhood became Prime Minister of Great Britain and without a doubt one of England's greatest Statesmen hour of the future On A Life That's laid down for someone else that was a case of a mother but then there's hundreds of lives can you say Amen that we're willing to say I know I'm going to die over this there's another story that I like I've told it here before this story always moves me to tears it's it's amazing there was a little boy and he was brought into the doctor's office and said his older sister he's only about seven years old his older sister had a rare blood disease and she's about 11 or 12 something like that and so they they realize if they took some of the boy's blood then and had a transfusion it would help her and so they brought him in the office and they explained to this young boy that he was that and asked him would you they explained the sister situation and he was already crying a little bit you know he didn't want to lose and his sister and so they said but we can do something here if you give your blood for your sister she can live and so he just stopped and he thought and then his eyes swelled up again with tears and he thought about it just about 30 seconds and he was just crying and he says I'll do it I'll do it and so when they got them on the the two uh beds next to each other to begin this blood transfusion they begin to do it and you could actually see it and this just restore the life of this girl after a few minutes the little boy said to the doctors and to his parents he said and he said and when do I die because he had understood it to be that for her to live he would have to give his blood and at that moment in the office he thought about it he said I'd rather have my sister live I'd rather give my life as a seven-year-old boy so she can go on being happy so she can go on and live she doesn't have to die but I will he made that decision and he said when do I die that honey no we didn't mean for you to die you're you're helping her with your blood but see my I moved in my heart because a young boy was willing to do that for his sister there's something about that in the love of God and Beyond a little boy the love of God is here this morning can you say Amen there's nobody could go to a cross like that unless he had you in mind that you could live in Victory that you can live over habits could you live in the Holy Ghost yes you can can you say Amen there isn't anything that you can't overcome because somebody made a decision because of that Victory I'll go to the cross for them I'll die for them and with him it wasn't just a blood transfusion it was a death and it was a blood transfusion in that the spirit in that blood could come back on them on the day of Pentecost you have the Holy Ghost today it's because he died at the cross split his blood cell by Spirit into his body you say well I'm just a young person you ought to think about that come on now you ought to think about it so I got my life ahead of me and I got this and I I'm looking at this on my phone and I and I got all this and got all my hormones going all this stuff you ought to look at what somebody died for you so that you don't have to have a you have to be a statistic or some young person that's caught up in a spirit of lust your whole life you don't have to live that way you can be filled with the Holy Spirit I said you can be filled with this Holy Spirit as a young man as a young woman and live a holy life unto God because of the cross why do you want to be like the rest of the world why do you want to come with them why do you want to to repeat their comments that you read on the end why do you want to be that everybody's that Christ has called you to be something different in this world mothers and fathers Christ has called you a different family in this world parents of children God's calling you a different home than the rest of this world may you feel the call of Christ this morning something different for your life because what somebody died for you can you raise your hand and say God I thank you somebody died for me I thank you Lord you died for me I don't ever want to lose the feeling somebody died for me it's personal can you say Amen I was looking at last night how many lives total were lost just for our country so that can preserve our freedoms and I have a little visual of it we know that the Civil War was the most lives lost but they counted up and this one lady in this article just this weekend put this together and she was pulling up the lives over the years of all the wars that our country has fought it's amazing how many lives it looks like close to a million the different Wars the Revolutionary War 4 400 War of 1812 Indian Wars Mexican now friends let's not lose the feeling listen this is almost a Million Lives that have been lost over history to preserve the unity and to preserve a country so that you can live all these years in Liberty let's not lose the feeling of it I thank God for these Million Lives they could have gone living like you they could have life raise their grandchild children and grandchildren left and inherit all these other things but they laid down their lives overseas or in our own land and all this and so you know here is something as they go on almost the the Persian Gulf War the global war on terror and and so these are the lives that have been lost these are amazing and I study a little bit the Civil War this is an amazing War to me uh to have almost on our own ground almost a half a million lives lost and to to us in our carnal mind that just seems stupid it seems crazy that we had to have that type of bloody battle and that many of our young men uh and older men got destroyed but you know what that battle it had to be fought there was a lot of tensions in our country can you say Amen there was a lot of things that were wrong in our country and they could have been corrected of course and they they tried different ways to correct it but this tension began to grow it was an internal war and and and and and and and they begin to fight over the things but the problems with our country was not not uh outside problems but it was internal problems with man's heart uh there was problems to break the unity of her these problems would cause the unity in our nation that we would split up into two Nations or many nations or States would become their own so now we had problems but the problems were in our heart racism Prejudice slavery bigotry um uh uh elitism we had problems but I wanna I want you to realize this morning and I know you know this these are problems of the heart these are not things that you can legislate in government to change how arrogant of our government to try to think I've got the new answer every presidential candidate will rise I've got the answer to the problems of our nation without addressing the word of God without going to God you don't have the problems you don't have it solved for these problems and I like what brother Matt said this weekend you think our votes are the thing that puts a man into it we we appreciate the votes and and I vote praise the Lord but it's not by the word of God it's not just our vote that puts a man in it's whether God wants that man in or not God is the ultimate control over it if that offends you then listen now uh I have some more things that can offend you why why do I have to be the one that offends all the time I want to be the nice guy the rest of my life but the anointing of the Holy Ghost says otherwise tell the truth it's God that puts man and brings them down into governments but the arrogance of government say I'm going to fix these problems and back then I want I it's always amazed me about the Civil War and I studied a bit and so many lives at such a deadly bloody battle and the deadliest battle was Gettysburg seven thousand at Gettysburg in that battle and when you watch some of the documentaries and the movies related to Civil War when you watch those things the only thing I conclude is these are real men these you know I think I'm a man these are real men these guys what they did uh to fight and and then losing their lives and just what they went through I went on a civil war tour one time over to Gettysburg those places uh I always conclude these were real men it's hard to find men like this today but they was where real men who fought this way and my point is always that I get out of this is that the document was signed in 1776 which actually would have should have addressed the issue of prejudice in our country it should have addressed it because that document said all men are created equal and you realize you have some of the founding fathers there that still were slave owners we still had slavery and so we have the so now we have a document that should have solved the problem are you listening we have a document that should have solved the problem of prejudice on our country but guess what just having a document doesn't necessarily solve the problems of the heart that's a very important point because all of us even with the word of God just because you have a Bible in your home or in your hand or in your shelf at home doesn't mean your heart problems are solved there's a power in the gospel that changes you can you say Amen there's only the power of the Holy Ghost that changes the heart it's not just that you read your Bible because God gave is the is our victory in the word yes did he write it in here yes is it in the I'm glad it's in the document but there has to be something more than a document 1776 all men are that should have problem they should have laid off slavery down that should solve the division in our country all the other problems as well whether it be racism whatever that the document should have solved it but it didn't and as I studied the Civil War you realize that 87 years later 87 years later is when we have a another thing signed and we we have come through two or three years of a bloody war over this subject the unity of our country the the racism the slavery and so that tension but where's the tension it's in man's heart it took a bloody war to bring it to a head and to solve the problem now we're in another day where the problems of men's Hearts still not solved we don't have slavery in our country but we have a lot of other problems in men's hearts we have violence on the rise can you say Amen we have homes we have a perverted spirit in this world that if you brothers and you sisters are not careful to keep yourself clean a perverted spirit will take your might and your spirit you'll take on a devil's spirit why because our world is perverted and is filled with perverted people Hollywood stars are the worst perverted people ever they're just dirty they're just perverted that's why they make perverted movies because we live in a perverted Spirit you can't solve that with a document War bloody war 87 years later the Emancipation Proclamation and to bring the issue to the Forefront and finally deal with it I'm just going to stop here and say that I use this scenario when I open with my marriage pre-marriage counseling there's a lot of people don't believe in that don't do it but if a couple would come to me and say we would like to talk with you then I'm all there to try to help them brother Brandon the other ministers to have to help them through this most important decision of their lives that they would besides receiving Christ the second most important decision I don't I don't think it should be made shallow or flippantly I think that they should have some counsel in it and I'm prepared not to get all the amens just now but I believe that all along and I've watched most of the marriages that I put together and signed off on to officiate because I don't give away daughters the Dad gives away a daughter but I officiate and if I officiate I'd like to be a little bit involved to ask them a few questions to see where their heart is to see if they're ready and it's not like I'm a big Downer to kill the romance and the love that they're feeling for one another I'm not out to get them but I'm just want to go through a little bit of talking sometimes it's it's two sessions sometimes it's a whole year sessions I'm always thankful for couples willing to do it not be afraid of it because if you're if this is the will of God you shouldn't have anything to hide from one another your heart should be laid out that's the most important decision I want to know and if anybody steps into oh no we're going to do this ourself that's wrong I can show you scripturally that's wrong but I go through this thing and this one thing that I have and it goes through a process but this is what I bring up first before to to have them get confidence is that the Civil War I talk about the Civil War in premarital counseling it's very interesting but I bring this point up they had a document okay they had a document but the document did not solve the problems with the heart so you can approach your marriage that way that if there's unresolved issues of your heart you can ignore them you can go with it uh you probably shouldn't with a 60 divorce rate in our country pushing 70 you probably shouldn't do that but it's up to you I'm not going to force you to do it thank God for some who come and do it but it's just uh it's like it's like that that they have the document but I tell them that the heart issue wasn't solved and so now if time would have been taken early on you see now it turned into a bloody war to solve the issue and you can do it that way there's some marriages that survive because they work it all out while they're married and work it out with the Lord and I say praise God when I pray for that I pray for that I'm not pronouncing doom on anybody my own children's marriages anybody I want it to work and there's a lot of things you can't learn before the marriage that you will only learn in marriage I realize that because I've been there done that and got the T-shirt there's things you don't know when you get married okay but but if there's things that you can explore with a trusted man and a trusted couple that you can explore that's unresolved issues in your heart or red flags why not try to deal with those things that's my argument with it why not try to work through it a little bit why not try if there's unresolved if there's pain in the heart you see because these days there's a lot of unresolved pain in the heart there's there's narcissistic men in this world I'm finding it's a spirit a narcissist and in women too a manipulating a man a manipulator he's self-focused he's all about himself and the Holy Ghost has not delivered him from that yet you take a narcissist a man or a woman you put him in a marriage like that it's going to be an explosion it's gonna be rough so and that's one of hundreds of heart issues and so I'm I'm learned through the years to talk about those heart issues from my experience and also from reading books and reading what the scripture says there can be things that's unresolved and I'm sorry I don't go with the theory that says that just says if they got the Holy Ghost they don't need to talk to anybody the Holy Ghost is all they need I'm sorry I've been a pastor way too long they may even have the Holy Ghost but I know people with the Holy Ghost have unresolved heart issues and if you don't know that you haven't you're not you're not thinking deeply I say to them isn't it amazing that 87 years later a bloody war of a half a million lives problems come to the Forefront and then they deal with them so you can do that you can do that but I want to let you know a document a marriage license and a ceremony is not going to solve heart problems and if they're not ready I just like to I take them through you know first two or three chapters of learning do they understand in the scripture what marriage is do you do they understand give and take do they understand what Christian marriage is so they fill out things they answer questions because we assume oh they just understand what a Christian marriage is a lot of times they don't they understand marriage they read it on the internet Pinterest has taught them what marriage is I can't wait let's do it but they don't know under the Bible what a Christian marriage is so I can't assume that they do so take them through that there's a chapter there on important scripturally to have the both parents blessings on the marriage we go through that scripturally then we come into the heart matters and do we deal with things that kind of draw out things unresolved things from their childhood or anything in their heart and if it's unresolved that can become a factor because if this person has a pain that's not been healed by the Lord then this mate will get in the marriage and start stepping on that pain and this person reacts and gets mad or they close in their shell and they're going man I just married this person two years ago they've they've closed off for me they're like a wall I can't get through them there's no Oneness anymore it's because probably you're stepping on her pain every day you or she's stepping on some pain that's unresolved and so we we work through that we work through a chapter on purity because I believe in purity and if you don't think you need to talk about that before marriage you need to talk about it before marriage with all these young guys and young girls and show them scripturally the blessing of going the pure way keeping your hands off of one another until the wedding day Purity and then if you think it's not important to talk about purity after marriage you're crazy because the same Devils that we're working on you as a young person the same Devils that work on you in your marriage they have to know from scripture what Purity is the value of it that I want it because it's God's blessing and go through some other chapters on different things and different things and come to the end and and then I give my summary of what I feel like are going to be some challenges see exposing the devil and these things is half the battle the devil hates it here it is out in the open it hurts it's painful and a lot of times I become the bad guy because I'm bringing them up I'm willing to be the bad guy if you'll talk about it I'll talk about it but all these things went oh this I didn't know this I didn't want to know that about you you see there's a thing in the marriage wall call it says if anybody has any impediment if the two of you have any impediment no of any impediment to disclose it now and it's the congregation anybody let him say so now forever hold his peace I've never heard you may say anything these days probably people should not got something here back in the old English wedding stop he's been married before well that's that's an impediment nobody knew that she's been married before um so the old English wedding is where that wedding ceremony comes from and actually in the Old English church the pastor would get up when the two said they wanted to get married Pastor would get up to the congregation two or three months before and announce they're interested they want to get married two or three months before does anybody know of any impediment or anything in their lives that we don't know about it was to the whole congregation they better disclose it not just at the ceremony it was way before and there was an accountability to the whole congregation wow that's strange well maybe the Holy Ghost is in the congregation and you trust that right thank you Lane I'm not hearing those amens like you were saying that what do you draw in there what are you doing I'm not hearing you amens I need them right now this is the time I need your amens thank you thank you hope he's still saying that when he's 18 years old falls in love so um anyway uh so what was I talking about yeah maybe the Holy Ghost is in the church and you you should trust that you can't trust Pinterest you can't trust Google you can't trust the movie stars and maybe you can trust that something the people some of those people have the Holy Ghost and they're out to help you not to hurt you maybe that Pastor has the Holy Ghost maybe he's called to say something that would help so they announced it to everybody and then they announced it at the wedding and then so impediment back then would have been something like they had had relations with somebody before or they were married before and they were hiding it you see they were hiding it but if somebody knew there's no need to hide that this is important that's how important the marriage decision ceremony was back then today it's it's it's finished there it's such a looseness today and I said to some of the I I've said to some of the couples this is it's just you're going to be married this week do you understand what you're going to stay in the marriage vow do you understand it if you don't understand anything else do you understand what you're going to say before God in that congregation if you understand that by Revelation I think your marriage will be okay but if you don't understand it it's just a day you get lost in the fluff of it and you say those vows and you don't mean them or you don't know what they mean it's a commitment for life in sickness and in health for richer for poor fat skinny oh that's that's not in there is it you're going to live out those vows you better know what they mean so the point is is that heart changes are important and heart things can be there and a lot of times I suggest to this because they're not ready they think they're ready but let's ask the Lord if they're ready they decide they're ready okay they're not ready if they're 17 18 19 years old they're not ready and that's for my own kids too Gabi if you're listening you may be sick but you're getting preached on this morning it goes for my own children to you're 17 18 19 years old for the most part let me qualify that for the most part you're not ready but the only thing ready is your hormones and that's why you want it so bad that's the only thing ready is your hormones but takes more of a marriage more to a marriage then your hormones being ready usually they're not ready financially they're not ready emotionally they're not ready in a lot of ways in those ages they mature at age 21 there's a big jump in maturity that's scientifically now in the brain they take a big step they say they choose different sometimes two different choose different mates if they're over 21 than what they would if they're 17 18 because you just mature in your mind 25 once again so you know I'm marrying people you can come to me about 30 years old about the top of that is that a good deal just kidding the document doesn't mean that the heart problems are solved can you say man took a lot of time on that because I felt led of the Lord to do it because a bloody war was fought and lives were given and a destruction almost of our country almost come to complete destruction to try to fight battles over heart things documents don't solve the problems just like the Bible doesn't solve it message books does not guarantee solving heart problems you can have every one of them you can have the app on your phone and you better be into it listening to it with a sincere heart and connecting with the Christ that's in it because if it's just a book or it's just an app on your phone it doesn't guarantee solving your heart problems blood has to be shed sometimes life has to be given to bring results we want something real from God how many would raise your hand this morning if you still love me I'm going to raise your hand say I want something real for me I want something real for my children I want something real from almighty God I don't want to be disconnected from the meaning of Calvary somebody gave their life for me and I want to live in in appreciation see that's what it is is that when young people tomorrow don't appreciate the lives that we're given there's no detached from it then they don't appreciate they're not grateful for the lives that we're given we need to be grateful can you say man we need to stay in constant appreciation and gratefulness for somebody who died for us can you say Amen my brothers and sisters God bless you amen we want something real interesting thing that she the lady Megan Krieger said in this article talking about the the lives that were lost she said not long ago most Americans were likely to know an active military service a service member many of our young people many Americans knew somebody but today because of the factors like political cost of launching a military draft and the increasing Automation and Outsourcing of military-related tasks fewer Americans have a personal connection to some in the armed Armed Force during World War to about 12 percent of the total U.S population were part of the Armed Forces according to the Census Bureau and Department of Defense and while fewer service ministers while fewer service members enlisted during the Vietnam era the conflicts draft cut across American society explains Gala through a medical a medical person uh over the Department of Veterans Affairs she talked she talks with veterans primarily those who fought most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq and explores ways to use narrative as a tool for mental health care even though there's so much talk about the opposition and difficult experiences that Vietnam veterans had come coming home with protests there was still a sense that people were very close to someone who had served or knew somebody who had served she said today out of a nation of nearly 329 million people 1.3 million Americans are in active duty military and another 800 000 serve in the reserves according to the Department of Defense that small figure influences the way the general public thinks about the cost of the conflict see disconnected from the cost disconnected that somebody gave their life for me more and more the new generation when they become disconnected from that they don't have an appreciation and a gratefulness for the Liberties they have disconnected that small figure influence is the way the general public thinks about the cost of the conflict in our society we've seen the real ship she said now now less than one percent of our population has served the experience of going to war and coming home we don't have we don't have as much awareness of it we have a disconnect in our society about what's going on who has served and what they experienced I thought that was very interesting to show the lack of connect to somebody died for me so that I could enjoy this there's a detachment there was a there's many moms who had their kid go away to war and never come back home their their son dies their son never come home and she's that mom being related to that son that's her son and he never came back home from war she's going to feel that she's going to feel that personally she's going to do a lot of crying she's got to do a lot of weeping if she's like most of them they are prouder of their country and they're proud that their son has served but you don't get around the fact of the feeling of being hurt being completely oh my son is gone my son gave his life and you don't think they think sometimes all these boys and young men walking around enjoying their cars and enjoying their Liberties and her son died so they could enjoy them feels it can you say Amen and and so but they're saying in the start of that people feel it less and less because they don't have a family member who went and didn't come back and they don't have a they don't know anybody a very small person knows somebody that served and died when they know somebody it's kind of like my friend he he died over there they forget somebody died for them they don't know someone who died for them if you have someone step in front of you and take a bullet young man what if you're standing there maybe downtown New York like I was this week a little nervous about New York wasn't bad but when you hear the things coming out of the news a little nervous and somebody can step out with a gun and what if you were standing there somebody steps out with a gun and they point it right at you and your your buddy that's sitting next to you today your buddy seen what was going to happen and jumped out and took the bullet for you and died and you had to go to the funeral of that friend I would say that you were feeling what your friend did for you and I would say that it would affect you so much emotionally you would cry even as a man you would cry and realize my buddy took the bullet for me and now I'm going to live my life in appreciation I'd say at that funeral you're going to be telling the story of your friend and you're going to be living your life in honor in honor and appreciation for what he did for you because you wouldn't be breathing unless he took that bullet for you I want to tell you young poor people this morning and every person under the sound of my voice there's a man Jesus Christ who took the bullet for you two thousand years ago he took the bullet for you you deserve to die in your sin you deserve to pay for your sins those little sins are big sins that you do that should come on you and you should die for that but I'm here to tell you somebody took the bullet for you and the very least that you could do you should give them all the least you could do is come to an altar and say I give my life back I'll be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'll be filled with the Holy Spirit and the rest of my life belongs to Jesus Christ because he took the bullet for me he took my sins blessed be the name of the Lord I just feel moved by the Lord this morning and I feel grateful and there's some more here somebody died for you no matter what you think of Paul LaFontaine or this church or your neighbor said Ninja why is that important I would say if you had the reality of this hit you then it would make you love others not according to the flesh hatred would be purged in our hearts when we know what this man has done for us our minds as brother Matt talked about the carnal mind is enmity against God and that means everybody's mind including mine left by itself it's it's a it's a it's an enemy of the leadership of God constantly whether it's lust or whether it's you know everything above everybody else it's carnality and it's an enemy of God and if all of us have that if all of us have that there has to be something stronger come from this man that died for us that would be powerful enough to purge us and have a power to overcome and be transformed by the renewing of our minds does that really count today what you think about other churches and what you think about situations how important is that it's way down here compared to what God has done for you and how he wants you to live I'd say when this Revelation strikes you I'd say there's an overwhelming love for everybody including me I say there's no way overwhelming love in it for all of us and for me to love everybody including you including all of you I don't have a right to be selective somebody died for me so I can live for him today I got a bunch more here but I feel the Holy Spirit saying we should pray now do you mind standing I was listening to a sermon on Pardon last night 1963 and the story that he he told in that sermon was foreign man in the Civil War a service man was supposed to be on duty and he got a little bit afraid I think of the guns shooting and so he just ran away and they caught him and they said you're guilty of deserting your post of Duty so you're going before the firing squad and a friend ran and found Abraham Lincoln and begged him to stop the carriage and they stopped and he says I have a friend he was supposed to be in the line of duty he got sidetracked let me tell you friends how many of you get sidetracked from your line of duty sometimes just about six of us all right he got sidetracked from where he was supposed to be and he's going from before the firing spot in that day you deserved it because you don't leave your post to duty please it's my friend he got on a Sneezy beg to say please they're putting him before the fire Squad please do something for him and Abraham Lincoln said it started to tear up took something wrote out he says I pardon this man what's his name I pardon him I give him a pardon you know he took him back to the jail here he's in shackles he's changed he's getting ready to go before the firing squad and he gives out with Abraham's own signature on it remember I said a document doesn't really mean anything unless it's received unless you realize the significance of it he could have got happy he said oh that's neat I got a thing with Abraham Lincoln's signature on and he could have said he could have been real happy and he could but instead he turned against it he said listen I don't believe that that's not real so he went before the firing squad and he got shot they took it to the court to make sure that the military was acting right and what they did not just killing just a a man like this and so they kept hashing over it and they'd concluded that a pardon even though this is a real pardon it's not good unless it's accepted as a pardon by the person and brother Bram says in that message he says a pardon is not just pardon he says it's a release a pardon is a complete freedom and a release from bondage if that man would have said I accept this as real they would have taken his shackles off he wouldn't have died in the firing squad and he would have without shouting and rejoicing I'm free I'm free because somebody wrote my pardon that's what he could have got out of the pardon but he didn't get that out of the pardon because he didn't see the meaning of the pardon he didn't see the significance of it that's what our Lord has done for us and a pardon is not just a piece of paper it's not just what the Lord said two thousand years ago when he said it is finished it's not just it's the reality of it it's your release it's your Victory can you say man his life that he died in is your Victory your deliverance accepted this morning take it raise your hands with me somebody died for me I accept that somebody pardoned me somebody's released me somebody's giving me victory in my life but I didn't even deserve it raise your hand and say I am free because somebody died for me Lord I want to remember what you did Lord I want to remember that you died not just for all all those but you died for me Lord and for my sins and for my mistakes and for what I've been through and all of my trials and all of my uh things Lord that I've done to displease you you died for that Lord I appreciate it this morning and I'm having my own Memorial Day my own Memorial Day to thank you Father for taking your life for me that I could live in Victory today Lord Jesus I pray that you'll move upon every heart that's open to you this morning because Lord if our hearts are blocked that they're closed if they're locked up Lord you can't bring the meaning of this but Lord I pray every heart would open to you you have deliverance and victory a pardon isn't just a pardon but it's a release from all of our habits it's a release from sin God give it to each one this morning everyone that's listening under the sound of our voice may they have their own memorial day today Father and say somebody died for me somebody died for me and I'm thankful Lord for your grace and your mercy and your love in my life and I make mistakes Lord I bring them to Calvary I've hurt so many people Lord I've heard different ones by the way I've said things I don't want to do that father forgive me of it Lord may they forgive me Lord there's one priority Above All Things Christ died for my sins Christ died for my sins thank you Lord thank you for your grace how many raise your hands said Thank You Lord I'm Grateful I'm appreciative on this Memorial Day somebody died for me thank you Father glorious Grace praise the Lord you know
