[0:01] I'm having a bit of a technical
[0:04] difficulty here
[0:07] let's see
[0:08] [Music]
[0:09] I couldn't see that but I can't see that
[0:21] is
[0:24] [Music]
[0:26] some people can do this and talk at the
[0:29] same time and I'm not one of them I
[0:32] think we're good here
[0:36] very good
[0:38] God bless you maybe we can open our
[0:40] Bibles to the Book of Revelation chapter
[0:42] 3 as we're getting settled in here
[0:46] it's uh good to be back and we were gone
[0:50] for
[0:51] six weeks over the summer and it's been
[0:54] good be it was good to visit family away
[0:57] but it's always good to be back and uh
[1:00] and you're on the home church and then
[1:03] back with the uh back with the church
[1:05] ages appreciate everybody's uh making us
[1:08] feel welcome back here at home
[1:11] uh we'll just start off
[1:13] Revelation chapter through the message
[1:15] to the church in Sardis and um verse one
[1:21] unto the angel of the church in Sardis
[1:23] right these things Seth he that hath the
[1:26] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[1:29] I Know Thy Works he says that though has
[1:32] to name that though livest and are dead
[1:35] Be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:37] which remain that are ready to die for I
[1:40] have not found thy works perfect before
[1:42] God
[1:44] remember therefore how thou Hast
[1:46] received and heard and hold fast and
[1:48] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[1:51] I will come on be as a thief and thou
[1:53] shalt not know what hour I will come
[1:55] upon thee
[1:56] thou asked a few names even in Sardis
[1:58] which have not defiled their garments
[2:00] and they shall walk with me in white for
[2:03] they are worthy
[2:05] he that overcometh the same shall be
[2:07] clothed in the white raiment and thy
[2:09] will not blot out his name out of The
[2:11] Book of Life thou will confess his name
[2:13] before my father before his angels
[2:17] let him hear what the spirit saith under
[2:20] the churches
[2:21] and this evening when they do a little
[2:23] bit of review from what we talked about
[2:25] in the beginning of June because that
[2:27] was a really long time ago and then one
[2:30] of the focus this evening perhaps on
[2:31] this phrase from verse 5 about he that
[2:35] overcometh I will not blot out his name
[2:37] out of The Book of Life we'll talk about
[2:40] uh The Book of Life and election Lord
[2:43] willing let's just pray though Heavenly
[2:45] Father we thank you for your goodness
[2:47] and your grace thank you for bringing us
[2:48] here this evening thank you for bringing
[2:50] us here this evening safely Lord we we
[2:53] want to acknowledge your hand in our
[2:55] lives father I just pray that you would
[2:57] bless the service this evening father
[2:59] both here and folks who might be
[3:01] streaming at home Lord just pray that
[3:03] you would
[3:04] help us to be better grounded in your
[3:07] word and a strong Foundation the Lord
[3:09] and Jesus Christ and we pray
[3:11] amen you may be seated
[3:15] so last time we talked about
[3:18] um how a lot of theologians and church
[3:21] historians look back at the Reformation
[3:24] of the 19th century and they call it the
[3:26] Glorious reformation and there were
[3:28] certainly uh some some glorious parts to
[3:30] it take it took a strong uh a strong
[3:34] anointing to be able to stand up against
[3:36] the Catholic system but
[3:40] um it's interesting is
[3:41] um when when the Holy Spirit is
[3:43] describing in Revelation chapter 3 that
[3:47] historical time period that is called
[3:48] The Glorious Reformation today there's a
[3:51] lot of criticism of it it's talking
[3:54] about they had to have just a few names
[3:56] among you um there's there's uh um you
[3:59] have a name that you live but are dead
[4:01] you're living your own name you're not
[4:02] living my name
[4:04] and there's there's a lot of criticism
[4:06] there and um the point that we kind of
[4:10] Drew from that is when we mistake the
[4:13] beginning of God's work for his
[4:15] completed work we might risk missing
[4:18] God's ultimate goal because we can look
[4:20] back and see the Reformation was
[4:23] certainly the time when the a standard
[4:26] was being raised against this uh this
[4:29] cycle of the Antichrist Spirit as it
[4:31] goes through the uh in the in the
[4:34] Ephesian age the Antichrist Spirit
[4:37] begins working in the church and
[4:38] gradually things get worse and Smyrna
[4:41] and pergamist and by attire and this
[4:44] evil is taking over the church as this
[4:46] Antichrist spirit is taking hold it took
[4:49] a lot to to counter that and God is
[4:52] really starting this restoration work
[4:54] he's just starting the work there and
[4:58] the sardisian church age
[5:01] but you can see it's just starting
[5:03] reversing the process of evil taking
[5:06] root in the church it's just starting
[5:08] this this work but when we go back and
[5:11] see oh this is what God has done here in
[5:14] in the sardisian age through Martin
[5:16] Luther and the Reformation this is what
[5:18] we're going to stay at
[5:20] that's the beginning point but we can't
[5:22] just hold over that we have to continue
[5:24] listening hearing what the spirits
[5:26] happen to the church is because it's in
[5:28] the process of that restoration you
[5:30] don't stop with just the L or the I you
[5:33] want to be made completely alive and
[5:36] that was kind of the uh that was the
[5:37] error with the Elders of Israel when
[5:40] they held strictly Only onto Moses that
[5:43] was where God started with the children
[5:45] of Israel but the purpose was to do a
[5:47] complete uh work and then where they
[5:50] would be filled with the fullness of God
[5:52] but they held just with the starting
[5:54] point and they weren't willing to
[5:55] continue on
[5:57] and that's the same thing that you can
[5:59] see happening with the reformation and
[6:02] the and the church ages following God's
[6:04] doing something and then they stop but
[6:06] God wants to continue and we don't want
[6:07] to just stop at the beginning the
[6:09] beginning is good but that's not
[6:11] everything
[6:12] those brother Brandon looks at this um
[6:15] the sardisian church age he sees there's
[6:17] such want and disregard for the Lord and
[6:20] his word that the that the con that the
[6:23] age in which Revelation 3 just rings
[6:25] with condemnation he says it wasn't the
[6:27] Glorious era that carnal-minded
[6:29] Protestant historians have tried to make
[6:32] it and even we listened to a voice from
[6:35] within the time period by Jana Amos
[6:38] khumanius and he said in short
[6:40] Christendom has become a labyrinth and
[6:42] he's writing at the end of the uh uh I
[6:46] think at the beginning of the seventh at
[6:48] the beginning of the 17th century 100
[6:49] years after the 95 Theses are posted
[6:52] he's saying the faith has been split
[6:54] into a thousand little parts and you
[6:57] made a heretic if there's just one of
[6:59] them you don't accept
[7:00] what can help the only one thing needful
[7:03] is to return to Christ he's
[7:04] acknowledging that there are a lot of
[7:05] people who are living their own name but
[7:08] like Revelation says you have a name
[7:10] that you're living but you're dead he
[7:12] said we need to go back to Christ and
[7:14] make him the leader and and follow him
[7:16] exclusively
[7:18] so brother Branham says in the church
[7:20] age book the sardisian age was an
[7:22] unfulfilled age it was just the start of
[7:25] getting back and it starts a great thing
[7:27] you can't get anywhere if you don't
[7:28] start
[7:29] but you don't get to the destination if
[7:31] you don't keep on going
[7:33] so whether Brandon talks about how yes
[7:36] it started with the doctrine of
[7:37] justification which meant salvation is
[7:39] all of God Luther preached the
[7:41] sovereignty of God in the election
[7:43] but it was all wonderfully good but
[7:46] um it's still like God's telling Luther
[7:47] you're going to start things but your
[7:50] age will see it still unfulfilled I'm
[7:52] leaving that until later so the lesson
[7:54] that we have to take there is we have to
[7:56] continue hearing with the spirits Athens
[7:58] of the churches continue following God
[8:00] as he reveals himself like Jesus told
[8:02] his disciples if you continue in my word
[8:06] then are you my disciples indeed it's
[8:08] not just sitting there for the first
[8:09] lesson and getting your sticker that yes
[8:11] I made it to the first day of school
[8:12] first day of school is great but you
[8:14] have to continue in his word and then
[8:17] you'll know the truth and the truth
[8:19] shall make you free
[8:21] so that was a in a nutshell what we
[8:24] talked about in uh in June but this
[8:26] evening I want to look about look at
[8:28] this the The Book of Life and the role
[8:31] of election in it because it's coming up
[8:34] here in Revelation 3 5 a that he had
[8:37] overcometh I won't blot out his name
[8:40] out of the book of life and brother
[8:43] Brandon commented even the possibility
[8:45] of a name being removed from the records
[8:47] of God deserves more than a casual study
[8:51] and he says a lot of people have drawn
[8:52] wrong conclusions they think that God
[8:55] placed the names people born again in
[8:57] the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of
[8:59] their rebirth
[9:00] and he says this is a 100 opposite to
[9:03] what the word actually teaches and he
[9:06] says at the start of our study he says
[9:08] there's not one scripture that teaches
[9:10] that God is presently compiling a record
[9:12] of names
[9:14] and I can remember when I was in
[9:16] elementary I in junior high I I took
[9:19] piano lessons because I think I was
[9:21] fulfilling my mother's unfulfilled
[9:24] dreams I think she wanted to be a
[9:25] Pianist so
[9:27] um her son's got to fulfill some of that
[9:29] and I thank you mother because it did
[9:30] fulfill some self-discipline but I've
[9:33] been told I didn't get the music gift my
[9:35] brother did so we just get so discipline
[9:37] takes you so far I remember one evening
[9:39] I was just kind of playing in the piano
[9:40] this uh I only played these like one
[9:43] three five chords and there was this
[9:45] song There was a new name written down
[9:46] in glory it was just a fun song to play
[9:48] in this head nice nice beat I really
[9:50] enjoyed it and I was and then somebody
[9:52] made the comments you know rap there's
[9:54] not any new names written down in glory
[9:56] it's like oh man you took my song away
[9:59] from that I was really enjoying playing
[10:00] the song but um you think about it
[10:04] um when we talk about a new name being
[10:06] written down in glory and yes we're told
[10:08] Jesus says Rejoice at your names are
[10:11] written in heaven so we can Rejoice
[10:13] their names written in heaven but we
[10:15] don't Rejoice their name is just now
[10:17] written in heaven because if it's just
[10:19] now written in heaven it's because of
[10:21] something we did
[10:23] because as soon as I come up to the
[10:25] altar or this happened to me oh now my
[10:27] name's finally written in heaven because
[10:29] I did something right
[10:31] and yes we have to respond there's that
[10:34] but we can't respond unless God pulls
[10:37] first
[10:38] and without that first pull we get
[10:40] nowhere so we Rejoice our names written
[10:42] in heaven but when we say our name is
[10:44] there's a new name written down in glory
[10:46] it implies I just did something to get
[10:49] my name there and that's not accurate
[10:52] now when we think about
[10:55] um the idea of election here
[10:58] because that's going to be a part of our
[11:00] our subject this evening because
[11:03] um yeah
[11:05] um election as to the idea of
[11:08] choosing somebody's in somebody's out
[11:10] and we can get this idea of this phys Ed
[11:13] lineup
[11:14] how many remember going into gym class
[11:17] and everybody standing at the end line
[11:19] and two team leaders are there I think
[11:21] you're on this side you're on that side
[11:23] you're on this side you're on that side
[11:24] and you're dying a thousand deaths every
[11:28] time that your name's not called because
[11:30] it's a test when if you're lack of
[11:33] athletic ability your lack of popularity
[11:35] your lack of whatever and you think this
[11:38] the smacks of what they're like if this
[11:40] is what elections like
[11:41] that's terrible because that's not how
[11:44] God should be
[11:47] um but that's not what elections like
[11:50] that's not how how names get put on the
[11:53] book because oh you're better you're not
[11:56] so good we'll save you to later election
[11:58] isn't a matter of either God saying oh I
[12:02] pick you I don't pick you I don't pick
[12:04] you the devil can have you it's not that
[12:05] and it's not the matter of us the first
[12:08] day of school we don't know people we're
[12:09] going to sign up to be on this guy's
[12:11] team and we just happen to pick the
[12:13] right person it's not that brother
[12:15] Branham says that it doesn't have to do
[12:18] with um and simply involving ourselves
[12:22] with a certain group of people in order
[12:24] to receive eternal life it doesn't have
[12:25] to do that that's not what it implies
[12:27] we'll talk more about this at the end
[12:29] election isn't a matter of somebody
[12:32] making a choice here or there you're in
[12:34] you're out it has to do with identity
[12:38] and that's what we're going to come come
[12:40] down to
[12:41] we're going to talk for a few minutes
[12:42] about the idea of a new name being
[12:46] written down in glory and this isn't to
[12:47] take away any favorite song or anything
[12:49] like that but it just so that we can be
[12:52] uh founded on yeah why is a name written
[12:56] in heaven it's not because of something
[12:57] we did it might be because something
[12:59] we've recognized
[13:01] but it's not something we did light
[13:03] strikes oh that's who I am I didn't know
[13:06] that has its identity not performance
[13:10] John 15 16 says you haven't chosen me
[13:13] but I've chosen you
[13:16] and when did this Choice take place it's
[13:19] not after you showed how fast you could
[13:22] run 100 meter dash how well you could
[13:25] sing how well you could didn't have
[13:26] anything to do with that
[13:28] God committed his love toward us and
[13:30] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[13:34] died for us well we were absolutely
[13:36] unable to commend ourselves to God for
[13:39] anything
[13:40] God chose us then he chose us yeah at
[13:44] our worst we can say that's what's being
[13:46] implied here at Romans 5 8.
[13:48] when did this Choice take place
[13:51] according Ephesians chapter 1 according
[13:54] as he hath chosen Us in him
[13:57] when before the foundation of the world
[14:01] that we should be holy Without Blame
[14:03] before him and love predestinate us unto
[14:05] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[14:08] to himself according to the good
[14:10] pleasure of
[14:11] his will
[14:13] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[14:17] where he made it accepted in the Beloved
[14:20] when before we've done anything
[14:23] it took place already there
[14:26] and Romans chapter 9 explains this
[14:30] principle of election really really well
[14:32] Paul is speaking about Jacob and Esau
[14:35] they said the children weren't even born
[14:38] yet
[14:39] they hadn't done any good or evil that
[14:42] the purpose of God according to election
[14:44] might stand
[14:46] it wasn't because of anything either one
[14:48] of them either one of those boys had
[14:49] done it was just God's
[14:52] Choice it was God there was a seed of
[14:55] God and one of them there wasn't in the
[14:57] other one and that's just how it was it
[15:00] wasn't because of a work that any one of
[15:02] them had had done it wasn't because
[15:03] Jacob was better brother Branham goes
[15:05] out of his way to say Esau was actually
[15:07] the better guy he took care of his dad
[15:09] better it would have been a wiser better
[15:11] choice but that's just how that's where
[15:14] the seed was sown
[15:16] and Jacob and in Revelation 17 8 whose
[15:19] names were written in the Book of Life
[15:21] when from the foundation of the world
[15:24] and this just to me this can give me
[15:28] rest and it's not because I did a
[15:30] particular thing to get my name in the
[15:32] book this evening no it's just God did
[15:35] the work
[15:36] um established it before the foundation
[15:38] of the world and at some point the light
[15:40] strikes I realized oh that's who I am
[15:43] brother Branham tells the test of the
[15:45] the story about the eagle got caught in
[15:48] the chicken's nest and it wasn't because
[15:50] the eagle did anything in particular
[15:52] it's just what it was
[15:55] so the elect when when Mama Eagle calls
[15:57] out it's not that she's rejecting the
[15:59] chickens
[16:01] it's not because the because the
[16:03] chickens are bad Eagles it's just
[16:04] because they're they're they're they're
[16:06] they're the chickens they can't respond
[16:07] there's nothing in them to respond when
[16:10] that uh when when that little Eagle
[16:12] hears mother is called all that that is
[16:14] something he'd never heard before and
[16:15] there was something to answer back
[16:17] because that's what he was he didn't do
[16:19] anything to make himself that that's
[16:21] just what he was
[16:24] so when we look at the uh when we look
[16:27] at the Book of Life
[16:28] um it's uh you really can't get out of
[16:31] uh talking about categories and um we'll
[16:36] talk uh talk a little bit uh brother
[16:38] Brandon refers to a couple things
[16:40] and different ways of categorizing look
[16:42] at that in a minute when we consider the
[16:45] Book of Life we're confronted though
[16:46] with the true with the fact that truth
[16:48] is exclusive
[16:50] when the trial when when the court case
[16:53] comes up and the defendants there is
[16:54] being arraigned he's being tried and
[16:56] finally the the verdict comes down it's
[16:59] going to be guilty or innocent it's
[17:01] going to be one or the other it's not
[17:03] going to be somewhere in the middle
[17:04] there's only two possible
[17:07] um two possible categories for the
[17:09] defendant these either be innocent or
[17:10] guilty name in this case in the Book of
[17:13] Life or or out of The Book of Life
[17:17] so
[17:18] um we'll talk this evening more about
[17:20] the categories names in and names out
[17:22] we'll keep it at those those and those
[17:25] two basic categories later we'll look at
[17:27] names in The Book of Life and who and
[17:29] who receives
[17:31] um eternal life will go further in there
[17:33] but tonight we just look at names not in
[17:35] the book
[17:36] and names in the book brother Brandon
[17:39] says on page 296 of the church age book
[17:41] will show by scripture one that there
[17:44] are multitudes who are not even born
[17:46] again
[17:47] who will go into
[17:49] eternal life
[17:50] does that sound strange but it's true
[17:52] they will talk about that in another
[17:54] service we'll also show there's a group
[17:56] of people whose names have it in place
[17:58] on the record before the foundation of
[17:59] the world cannot under any circumstances
[18:02] have those names removed we'll talk
[18:04] about that some this evening
[18:07] and then they'll also show that another
[18:08] group whose names were on that record
[18:10] before the foundation of the world but
[18:12] they will have their names removed we'll
[18:14] talk about that another time so we'll
[18:16] talk about category two and then this
[18:18] fourth category of achievement ads on
[18:19] page 316 he says fourth and finally
[18:22] are those names who have never been
[18:26] or will ever be written on the books
[18:30] never there there is no record of them
[18:33] at all and we can we can see that there
[18:36] are some individuals there is absolutely
[18:38] no record of them at all on the Book of
[18:40] Life never has been never will be
[18:43] and Revelation 13 8 talks about that
[18:48] there are those who dwell upon the Earth
[18:50] the Lord worshiping the Beast whose
[18:52] names are not written in the Book of
[18:55] Life of the Lamb so we're going to talk
[18:58] up just for a few minutes looking at how
[18:59] the scripture does best it's not that we
[19:02] want somebody not to have the name on
[19:04] the book that's it that have anything to
[19:06] do with our desire we're just looking at
[19:07] that's what the Bible says it doesn't
[19:09] mean to do with what I want and now
[19:11] you're not on the book of life you're
[19:12] you're a serpency no we we're just
[19:14] looking what the Bible says and then
[19:16] we'll go we'll go from there it's not
[19:18] for us to uh to pick and choose what
[19:20] truth is it's just this is what the
[19:21] Bible says and to accept it
[19:24] first Peter 2 talks about unto you
[19:27] therefore which believe he's precious
[19:30] but unto them which be disobedient
[19:33] the stone which the builders rejected
[19:35] the stone which the builders disallowed
[19:36] the same is made the head of the corner
[19:38] so there are people who are disobedient
[19:40] they reject Christ but he's still going
[19:42] to be made the head of the corner but to
[19:43] them he'll be a stone of stumbling Iraq
[19:45] of offense even to them would stumble up
[19:48] the word being disobedient where and to
[19:50] also
[19:52] they were appointed
[19:54] the scripture is going to talk about
[19:55] some in first Thessalonians 5 9 God hath
[19:59] not appointed us to wrath but others are
[20:02] appointed to wrath their their names not
[20:06] in the book of life not appointed uh to
[20:08] Glory they're appointed to uh to wrath
[20:10] and to judgment
[20:12] and that that can be hard it's easy to
[20:15] uh that's a hard saying of the disciples
[20:17] uh people told Jesus that's a hard
[20:19] saying who can hear it but it's what the
[20:22] Bible says we'll talk more about that
[20:25] and uh Romans 9 Paul writes has the
[20:29] Potter power over the clay he does he
[20:31] can make one lump to honor another
[20:33] vessel to dishonor he has that he has
[20:37] that right and what if God willing to
[20:39] show his wrath and to make his power
[20:41] known endured with much long-suffering
[20:43] the vessels of Wrath fitted to
[20:45] destruction there are he said there are
[20:47] some who are fitted to destruction
[20:49] that's that's just what they're here for
[20:53] there's there's nothing that they're not
[20:56] called to anything
[20:57] higher than that and that is a hard
[20:59] saying but Paul answers this and there
[21:02] can be charges of Injustice to God why
[21:04] can you do that God how can you do that
[21:06] to point somebody to wrath and Paul says
[21:09] yeah the Potter has power over the clay
[21:11] God is he's he's Sovereign and
[21:16] um it can be hard for us to accept that
[21:18] but God can have a purpose for something
[21:21] that we can't understand
[21:23] and if that if that's true then it can
[21:26] also be declared to be good in some way
[21:28] that we might not be able to understand
[21:30] it but God is sovereign
[21:33] now thinking about it more
[21:35] um
[21:36] it can be difficult to accept that some
[21:40] are actually appointed to distraction in
[21:42] your record of life at all
[21:44] yet there is a fact in the Bible that
[21:47] there are two seed lines stretching out
[21:51] through time
[21:53] which can also explain why God keeps
[21:55] track of his children
[21:58] in the book of life but he doesn't keep
[22:00] track of
[22:01] somebody else's children in the book of
[22:03] life is like
[22:04] they've got a lot of families might have
[22:06] a genealogist I know one of our fellow
[22:08] teachers at school is a genealogist she
[22:11] knows where her family came from all the
[22:12] way back and I said but Mrs Bish do you
[22:15] know where my family came from am I in
[22:16] your family genealogy said no no
[22:19] I'm not going to say to her that's so
[22:21] hateful you're you're not you're not
[22:23] keeping me in your book of life I mean
[22:25] that's that that's not right but she
[22:27] keeps track of her her children
[22:29] she can check her for her family she's
[22:30] not going to keep track of my family I
[22:33] accept that and it's the same way
[22:35] there's a there is a life on Earth that
[22:38] came about in Rebellion against God that
[22:40] God's not keeping track of those kids
[22:42] the way he's keeping track of his kids
[22:46] and Matthew 13 38 says the field is the
[22:49] world the good seed are the children of
[22:51] the Kingdom there are children of the
[22:53] Kingdom that God's going to keep very
[22:54] good track of
[22:56] but there are also tears and they're the
[22:58] children of the wicked one
[23:00] and there's a book of life for God's
[23:02] children he keeps track of that he's
[23:04] going to make sure they're
[23:05] they uh they're they're they're
[23:06] appointed to life Everlasting but the
[23:09] others he's not going to keep track of
[23:10] him because they came about outside of
[23:13] his outside of his perfect will
[23:17] and that's that almost makes sense he
[23:21] keeps track of his own children
[23:24] First John 3 10.
[23:26] in this that there are children of God
[23:28] and that's the children of God are
[23:30] manifest and also the children of the
[23:32] devil
[23:33] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[23:36] of God neither he that loveth not his
[23:38] brother so you again see these these two
[23:41] groups these these these two families
[23:43] and there's a book of life where God
[23:44] keeps a record of of of of of of his
[23:47] children
[23:48] but he doesn't keep a record doesn't
[23:49] keep the he doesn't keep track of who
[23:51] all the devil's kids are
[23:53] um there's not a book he doesn't have a
[23:54] book of life for that because that's not
[23:56] those aren't his kids you could say
[24:00] um Ephesians 5 speaks about a little
[24:02] differently he talked God Paul speaks
[24:04] about children of Disobedience let no
[24:05] man deceive You by vain words for
[24:08] because of these things cometh the wrath
[24:09] of God upon the children of Disobedience
[24:11] so God keeps track of his children
[24:13] exclusively and people who might be and
[24:16] anything has to do with God's children
[24:17] he keeps track of him and make sure
[24:19] there's a there's a reward for them
[24:21] but he doesn't keep track of things that
[24:24] don't have to do with people with with
[24:25] his children
[24:29] and again that might seem like man God
[24:31] is really I thought God was gracious
[24:34] God is still gracious even though
[24:36] there's not a book set aside where he
[24:39] keeps track of those who aren't his
[24:40] children because
[24:42] even the children of disobedience
[24:45] it can enjoy and do enjoy the grace of
[24:48] God in this life it's not like that all
[24:51] those uh that all the serpents running
[24:54] around God is making it rain every day
[24:56] and you're throwing he's throwing
[24:58] lightning putting thunderstorms that's
[25:00] what the Greek gods did that's what the
[25:02] pagan gods did but the the true God
[25:04] doesn't do that
[25:06] he's not he's not trying to execute
[25:07] Vengeance because of what what uh what
[25:10] happened in the garden I'm going to make
[25:11] sure every one of those Devil's kids are
[25:13] going to get have a terrible day every
[25:15] single day of the week he doesn't do
[25:17] that he actually he makes the son rides
[25:20] on the evil and the good
[25:22] he sends right on the just and the
[25:24] unjust so even even people who might not
[25:26] have their name in The Book of Life God
[25:29] still shows grace and mercy to them even
[25:31] to the extent that in Psalm 73 asaph
[25:34] gets jealous because he says I was
[25:37] envious at the foolish when I saw the
[25:39] prosperity of the wicked why didn't I
[25:42] win the lottery some unbeliever won the
[25:44] laundry how can that be and they've got
[25:47] the BMW I've got the night I've got this
[25:49] another car
[25:50] why is that people can actually have a
[25:53] good life depending on the decisions
[25:55] they make I mean they can make bad
[25:56] decisions but you know what unbelievers
[25:58] can also make wise decisions and they
[26:01] can enjoy the grace of God in this life
[26:03] so even though somebody's name might not
[26:04] be on the book of life doesn't mean that
[26:07] God's not being gracious to them
[26:09] there might not be anything in them to
[26:11] respond to God but they might still live
[26:14] a life according to many of God's
[26:15] principles and enjoy the grace of God in
[26:20] this life so there's a lot more grace
[26:23] out there I mean the grace of God is
[26:25] it's abundant Beyond but we can fathom
[26:29] so even in this life the children of
[26:32] Disobedience do enjoy the grace of God I
[26:35] mean think about our kids I mean they
[26:37] can be disobedient sometimes but they
[26:39] might still enjoy free Wi-Fi at home
[26:42] free food all these things and they can
[26:44] be disobedient kids but we're the grace
[26:47] and love of parents is abundant even for
[26:49] our kids who are disobedient
[26:51] and that's just the love of God
[26:55] and even in judgment
[26:57] we can say that God is a righteous judge
[27:00] he doesn't spend
[27:02] um the time time here on Earth
[27:06] executing vengeance upon the children of
[27:09] Disobedience he's not doing he's not
[27:11] sending Thunderbolts every single day
[27:12] and even at the end when they're when
[27:14] there's coming of judgments he's not
[27:16] sending them to Eternity where they're
[27:18] being tortured that's not the point of
[27:21] Hell the point of hell is just to
[27:23] destroy that which isn't uh according to
[27:26] God's perfect plan and hell wasn't uh
[27:29] hell was created for the devil and his
[27:31] demons it wasn't created for the humans
[27:34] here on Earth who might have followed
[27:35] that they they'll they they they will
[27:37] they will be destroyed in hell but it
[27:39] wasn't it wasn't for that purpose
[27:41] and hell is going to be a finite time
[27:44] the scriptures here on this here on the
[27:46] notes
[27:47] um the enemies of the Cross of Christ
[27:49] Philippians 3 19 says whose end is
[27:52] destruction not Everlasting torture with
[27:55] bamboo sticks being stuck at their
[27:56] fingernails and all kinds of this going
[27:59] on for Infinity
[28:01] um Matthew 10 28 says we should fear Him
[28:04] who's able to destroy both soul and body
[28:07] and Hell the point is Annihilation and
[28:10] not just Everlasting pain
[28:13] and Luke 12 talks about punishment will
[28:16] be proportionate
[28:18] um somebody who there's a servant who
[28:20] knew his Lord's will
[28:22] but didn't prepare himself to do it and
[28:24] didn't do a quarter into his Lord's will
[28:26] he will be beaten with many stripes
[28:28] because he knew better
[28:31] but there'll be another servant who
[28:32] didn't know his Lord's will
[28:34] but did commit things against those
[28:37] Lords but he didn't know it and he'll be
[28:39] beaten with few stripes
[28:40] so God is still a righteous and just
[28:45] even in judgment
[28:48] the one to go back to the idea how we're
[28:52] back to that lineup at uh and class and
[28:55] I was kind of going through this last
[28:57] night with my wife just kind of making
[28:59] sure things were clear and she had the
[29:01] audacity said man that tall kid in the
[29:03] middle of those goggles he looks like
[29:04] you
[29:07] thank you sweetheart thank you
[29:09] sweetheart but fortunately God's
[29:12] election isn't like this the election
[29:14] isn't a matter of either God or us
[29:16] picking and choosing because my wife
[29:18] probably wouldn't have picked me if I'd
[29:20] look no sure her love is uh her love is
[29:23] great
[29:24] but election isn't a matter of picking
[29:26] and choosing that we associate it with
[29:28] that
[29:29] it's a matter of identity
[29:32] and this is from the message of Jehovah
[29:34] Jireh brother Branham speaks about
[29:36] Abraham or Abraham in the Bible
[29:37] represents the election Isaac
[29:40] justification Jacob Grace Joseph
[29:42] perfection
[29:44] and he says but on this election God
[29:47] chose Abraham
[29:49] not because he was an educated man
[29:52] not because he was a smart man but
[29:55] because God saw something in Abraham
[29:58] before the foundation of the world
[30:01] and later on in his ministry brother
[30:03] Bramwell talks about will show why God
[30:05] saw that there God put it there his seed
[30:09] was sown there but here he's saying God
[30:11] saw something in them before the
[30:13] foundation of the world since that's the
[30:15] reason that you're a Christian tonight
[30:17] because God saw something in you before
[30:20] the foundation of the world and put your
[30:23] name on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[30:25] the world was ever formed
[30:27] and he says the biggest fault I can find
[30:30] with any of the churches and especially
[30:32] and especially the real church that's
[30:34] born again
[30:36] as they don't know who they are
[30:39] so here it's not based upon what we're
[30:41] doing or choosing or gotcha it's based
[30:44] upon who we are election is a matter of
[30:47] identity and identity is based upon
[30:50] seed who's your dad
[30:52] and he says they don't know who they are
[30:54] you don't realize what their privilege
[30:55] God's given you you're looking for
[30:57] something way off on some kind of a
[30:59] millennium but the devil's pulled one
[31:01] over on you now we are the sons of God
[31:05] election's a question of identity
[31:09] and I've heard about people who can take
[31:11] these uh DNA tests and you'll see where
[31:15] your family came from everything and
[31:16] depending on the test you you had I've
[31:18] never taken one but you can find all
[31:20] kinds of family you didn't realize you
[31:22] had and so people will start making
[31:25] phone calls and meet up with these
[31:27] long-lost brothers and you hear the
[31:29] stories of wow we enjoy the same kind of
[31:32] food like the same kinds of books it's
[31:34] like we're family
[31:36] and
[31:37] why is that the case is because of who
[31:40] they are it's not because they're all of
[31:41] a sudden copying each other and and and
[31:43] and and Performing like each other that
[31:45] they'd say oh we're so alike no it's
[31:47] because it's in their DNA that that
[31:50] that's who they are and it's kind of
[31:52] like how it is in this book of life that
[31:56] I mean God's God's God's DNA is all over
[32:00] the world and he's there to bring the
[32:01] help them help to his children to
[32:03] realize hey I'm your dad
[32:06] that's what it's all about to say Ah
[32:08] that's who I really am I thought I was
[32:10] in I thought I was part of a different
[32:11] family and I always try I never felt
[32:13] comfortable in that family before but
[32:15] now I know who my real dad is and now it
[32:17] solves everything I I understand things
[32:19] so much better because I know who my
[32:20] real dad is
[32:22] that's election is a matter of who you
[32:25] are identity
[32:28] and the the sermon communion brother
[32:30] Baptist now we want to go back and think
[32:33] Paul is referring to an Old Testament
[32:35] character in The Book of Genesis we take
[32:37] the life of Abraham from the 12th
[32:39] chapter of Genesis Genesis God giving
[32:41] Abraham the promise and through Abraham
[32:43] would come the righteous see and Abraham
[32:45] believed by many to be a Jew he wasn't
[32:47] Abram was a gentile a Chaldean from the
[32:49] city of Earth and he became God's
[32:52] servant not because he was different
[32:54] from anyone else
[32:56] but because of the election of God it
[33:00] wasn't because Abram was super educated
[33:02] super respectful is just because of the
[33:04] election of God there was there was
[33:07] something in him
[33:08] there wasn't any in any of his human
[33:10] characteristics there was a a seed of
[33:13] God that was in him that he didn't
[33:15] deserve it was just there and we don't
[33:17] deserve any of it it's it's it's it's
[33:19] not of him who Wills or runs it's God
[33:22] who shows Mercy
[33:25] and brother Brandon extends that
[33:27] principle to us Paul does this Paul Paul
[33:30] does it he said we are the children of
[33:32] Abram the same way that God dealt with
[33:34] Abraham or children of Abram God deals
[33:36] with us the same way we're not saved
[33:39] because we're a good person so we can't
[33:40] say I'll go ahead and come to the Lord
[33:42] once I once I've overcome certain things
[33:45] in my life or I'll get baptized once
[33:47] I've overcome this or that and yeah I
[33:49] can feel the pull of God but
[33:51] I'll respond to it once I'm good enough
[33:53] for it I don't want to disappoint God
[33:55] loves us when we're Sinners he's drawing
[33:59] on this sin we come as we are not as we
[34:02] want to be we come as we are and God
[34:05] make sure we leave different than we
[34:07] were he transformed us into his
[34:10] creatures and something and and some
[34:12] things will just change immediately
[34:14] other things might take time
[34:17] some things just be right away just like
[34:19] a meat cleaver one day I was struggling
[34:22] with this the next day it was gone but
[34:24] there can be other things that just kind
[34:25] of hang on there you just kind of have
[34:27] to battle and battle and battle and in
[34:30] the Old Testament when um the children
[34:32] of Israel go into the promised land God
[34:35] tells Moses I'm not going to drive
[34:37] everybody out from you right away
[34:39] because then you won't have the strength
[34:42] to keep the land yourself there's going
[34:44] to be something that will be a
[34:45] consistent there'll be a battle you're
[34:46] going to have to continue driving these
[34:48] Giants out driving the Giants out
[34:49] driving the Giants out that's how it was
[34:51] with the Israelites possessing their
[34:53] Promised Land what's our Promised Land
[34:56] it's this vessel it's a we want to make
[34:59] this our flesh be conformed to God's
[35:03] will the soul God's life and the Soul
[35:06] should be controlling our our carnal
[35:09] spirit and when that happens then the
[35:11] flesh can is is falling as objection as
[35:14] well but when the soul takes the day off
[35:16] goes on vacation that carnal spirit is
[35:18] going to take the lead he's going to
[35:19] lead our flesh all kinds of different
[35:20] ways but we gotta in the the inner man's
[35:23] gonna have hey we're going to do
[35:24] something different we're going to
[35:25] please God we're going to possess the
[35:27] land that's how it takes but it's some
[35:30] things will change right away some
[35:31] things won't that doesn't mean God
[35:33] didn't work with you it just means just
[35:35] like the children of Israel God's
[35:37] leaving some Giants for you to grow up
[35:39] gain more muscles and battle later on in
[35:42] your life and they'll give you the
[35:43] strength to to to defeat those just like
[35:45] he helped you defeat the other ones
[35:49] let's see here and then the message
[35:51] Abraham's Grace Covenant
[35:54] it says remember the promise is
[35:56] altogether Grace and no law mixed in it
[36:01] at all
[36:03] there's no ifs at all if you do this
[36:07] I'll do that that's how we often deal
[36:09] with one another honey if you wash the
[36:13] dishes I'll do this for you
[36:16] that's how we deal a lot of times but
[36:17] that's not how God deals it was an
[36:20] unconditional Covenant that God made
[36:22] with Abraham not any ifs or absolutely
[36:24] God's choosing of Abram it's not what
[36:26] you've done what your desires are it
[36:29] wasn't Abraham's desire
[36:31] he was a heathen God just came out of
[36:34] the blue and full on his heart
[36:36] it wasn't because he was searching after
[36:38] God first you know what we can't see God
[36:41] coming out of heaven and certain to pull
[36:44] on us
[36:45] but if we feel a desire for God it can
[36:48] only be because God pulled on our hearts
[36:51] first there's no other way around
[36:52] because that's not a natural desire God
[36:56] starts it
[36:57] and that we can respond to it
[36:59] wasn't Abraham's desire he was a heathen
[37:04] he come down from the Tower of Babel and
[37:06] the Valley of the Shiner and the lady of
[37:07] the Chaldeans the city of her he was
[37:09] just an ordinary man nothing Abraham did
[37:12] not even his desires but God by grace
[37:16] and election chose Abraham and that's
[37:18] the way he chose you it's nothing he did
[37:20] to get her name written down in glory
[37:22] this evening it's what he did before the
[37:25] foundation of the world before he'd ever
[37:27] done anything good or bad that's how God
[37:29] dealt with Abraham and also to Abraham's
[37:32] seed
[37:34] then the quote continues on the bottom
[37:37] of page five
[37:40] he says do you think you've become a
[37:41] minister or Christian because people
[37:43] talk good about you join the church or
[37:45] stay in society you're just fooling
[37:47] yourself that's all you're a miserable
[37:49] person when it comes to Christianity
[37:51] that's what the prophet Isaiah says all
[37:54] of our righteousnesses
[37:56] are as filthy rags the best effort that
[38:00] we can put forth to please God
[38:03] I did this in the Sunday School a long
[38:05] time ago like the week before Sunday
[38:07] school class I took a rag and I dug a
[38:10] hole in the backyard and I put that rag
[38:12] in the dirt
[38:14] and then next week I come back I on
[38:16] Sunday morning I dig the dig the rag out
[38:18] and I says this
[38:20] are our this is the best we are on a
[38:22] good day and I use this rag to clean
[38:25] this dish I'm just going to make it
[38:28] worse that's how our righteousness is to
[38:30] God we uh it's not because we're a
[38:34] miserable person when it comes to
[38:36] Christianity God chooses by election
[38:41] and we can rest in that it's not because
[38:44] of when we came to the altar at a
[38:46] certain time that we're finally God said
[38:48] yeah you finally did it I'm going to
[38:49] give it to you now we do have to respond
[38:52] when God's and God's calling there is a
[38:54] response my wife is sharing the example
[38:56] that she heard one time it's kind of
[38:58] like when someone is out testifying they
[39:00] might have a a board on the front that
[39:02] they're wearing
[39:03] and says whosoever will let them come
[39:06] and that's that's what's being projected
[39:07] out
[39:08] but on the other side of the board is
[39:11] whom I knew before the foundation of the
[39:13] world
[39:14] there's one side both sides are true but
[39:17] if we just sit back and say huh if I'm
[39:19] Pro destinated I don't do any Mission
[39:21] work because if they're predestinian
[39:23] they'll come anyway no we have to preach
[39:25] whosoever we'll let him come because
[39:26] that's true God's atonement is powerful
[39:29] effective for anybody who comes
[39:31] and then we rest I rest not in in how
[39:35] good I can preach how good I can spread
[39:37] seed because that sower who spread this
[39:39] he was a terrible sower
[39:41] but he's just resting that this seed if
[39:43] it gets to the right spot it's going to
[39:44] bring something forth not because of
[39:46] what I do almost in spite of what I do
[39:49] but I'm doing it and God's going to
[39:51] bring forth increase because there's
[39:52] there's principles that are going to be
[39:54] working and I can just rest in that
[40:01] so it goes back again to
[40:04] um identity so that sower Goes Forth to
[40:07] so he when he uh when he goes and
[40:11] Associates uh plants his garden
[40:13] plant in the garden doesn't start in the
[40:16] month of March
[40:18] it starts months before
[40:21] when uh when sister I was over at the
[40:23] semicolas two weeks ago and saw sister
[40:25] Tiffany's flower garden
[40:27] like it just stretches goes and goes and
[40:30] goes and she doesn't just go out one day
[40:32] I'm going to plant this year
[40:34] no she's me I want I want this in my
[40:37] garden I want this in my garden I want
[40:38] this in my garden and she's Gathering
[40:40] these seeds she's already got a vision
[40:42] she's seeing the result before the seeds
[40:46] ever even planted and that's how it is
[40:48] with God when brother Brahm speaks about
[40:50] how
[40:51] they uh they're in God's mind for the
[40:54] foundation of the world he's already
[40:55] thinking of his children
[40:58] and God's thoughts he says they're
[41:01] literal we can't fathom that
[41:03] he's already thinking of it and and
[41:05] there's already a life there it's kind
[41:08] of like the best I can think about it is
[41:10] when like when Elise was expecting job
[41:13] and or Lynn or Sophie and you're sitting
[41:16] there on the couch together the house is
[41:17] quiet and and you can feel the baby move
[41:20] around the tummy you can already in your
[41:22] mind you can already hear that pitter
[41:24] patter feet running through the hallways
[41:26] you're already the child's not born yet
[41:29] but for you you already loved each other
[41:31] but the child is in anything you're
[41:33] already and that's how that's how it is
[41:35] a sower Goes Forth to sew you're already
[41:37] God already knows these these seed he
[41:40] already knows his children sister
[41:41] Tiffany loves these flowers for they
[41:43] ever hit the ground
[41:45] and
[41:47] so she goes forth to sew and
[41:50] she's she's chosen these
[41:53] she's elected these to be in her garden
[41:56] however an enemy comes long afterward
[42:00] and so is something else
[42:02] no Mr Tiffany didn't make a list of all
[42:06] the weeds that would be coming up in the
[42:07] garden because that wasn't part of her
[42:09] her plan they those were in her thoughts
[42:11] that wasn't what she was sowing election
[42:13] is yeah it doesn't she's not going along
[42:16] and saying yeah I'm going to this corn
[42:18] I'm going to say it's a corn because all
[42:20] these attributes it's a beautiful
[42:21] beautiful kernels and uh everything is
[42:25] great I'm going to say this is a good
[42:26] corn and this dandelion here this is a
[42:28] bad corn because no it's it's not
[42:29] because of the performance of the plant
[42:31] because of what the plant is
[42:34] and that's where the election goes back
[42:36] to what that seed is it's a corn plant
[42:39] not because of how good it grew but
[42:40] because of the seed that it was that's
[42:43] the only way it can be
[42:44] so election isn't a matter of either God
[42:47] or us picking and choosing it's a matter
[42:50] of identity what that seed is it's not
[42:53] that that corn plant could be a bad corn
[42:55] plant but it's still a corn plant
[42:58] and you can be a because I'm a terrible
[43:00] Christian
[43:02] but if you're following God you're still
[43:04] a Christian and that's the most
[43:06] important thing you can say I I fell
[43:08] today but I a Christian Falls forward
[43:10] because Lord forgive me I'm sorry God
[43:13] then you could get right back up and
[43:15] you're still a Christian you don't all
[43:16] of a sudden become become a dandelion
[43:18] you're still that wheat plant because
[43:20] that's the seed that's there
[43:22] and that doesn't change
[43:25] and the brother Brandon says now then
[43:27] we're coming to a conclusion and I can
[43:28] say the same thing we're getting ready
[43:30] to come to a conclusion here as the
[43:32] Eternal logos God was manifest in the
[43:35] Sun
[43:36] so the thoughts of God and the beginning
[43:38] before Before Time began and the
[43:40] foundation of the world God's alone with
[43:43] his thoughts
[43:44] and then Proverbs chapter 8 which
[43:47] describes the spirit of wisdom and and
[43:50] and it talks you were I was there before
[43:53] the world was for anything was brought
[43:54] forth I said as being the logos there
[43:57] and they talked about and then we were
[43:59] God delighted me as as a father and a
[44:02] child God was there and that logos
[44:05] hasn't become flesh as the son but that
[44:07] God's still rejoicing it as in his
[44:10] thought as though we're already there
[44:12] just like the parents sitting on the
[44:13] couch dreaming of the pitter-patter of
[44:16] the feet going through the house and
[44:18] didn't realize that might be Peter pader
[44:19] at two o'clock at night like it was last
[44:21] night in our house which wasn't as
[44:23] enjoyable but it doesn't change the fact
[44:25] that I love my daughter even though she
[44:26] woke us up that's how it is with with
[44:28] God as well
[44:30] but that logos was manifest over time in
[44:33] the Sun and that's how it is with us as
[44:36] well we were in God's thoughts at the
[44:38] beginning and gradually in time that
[44:42] thought comes to a place where it starts
[44:44] taking on flesh
[44:46] and our great grandfather or grandfather
[44:48] then finally Our Father then finally we
[44:51] come to Earth and there's something in
[44:54] that little baby that's going to bring
[44:56] forth later because there's a thought of
[44:59] God there
[45:00] not because the baby was so good and
[45:02] slept well off of the night that God
[45:04] says that's going to be a good boy and
[45:06] put my thought in him and deposit it
[45:08] that's not at all it was there already
[45:10] before the beginning
[45:13] so even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[45:16] and our turn we became the many membered
[45:19] spoken word seed manifest in flesh and
[45:22] those Eternal thoughts now manifest In
[45:25] the Flesh are the sons of God even as we
[45:28] are so called we did not become
[45:31] by the rebirth we were seed and
[45:35] therefore were reborn for only the elect
[45:37] can be reborn that corn seed that
[45:41] planted there in the garden it doesn't
[45:43] become corn supernaturally because it's
[45:46] done so well
[45:48] it can only become corn because it what
[45:50] it's always been
[45:52] and that's what was willed I I plant
[45:55] that there it's going to come forth and
[45:57] that is my will of my desire that is
[46:00] what election is that's what it is it's
[46:02] what it's going to become
[46:03] because we were seed is the reason we
[46:06] could be quickened and non-seed there's
[46:10] nothing to Quicken
[46:12] but again in the non God didn't sow
[46:14] those
[46:16] and they will still enjoy the Sun the
[46:19] rain good things in this life
[46:22] so they'll still enjoy the grace of God
[46:25] but again when it comes time for Harvest
[46:27] the dandelion is going to be pulled out
[46:29] they'll have a different uh a different
[46:32] uh future and then the seed's going to
[46:34] be harvested and put in taken home and
[46:37] eating it'll be it'll be it'll be a
[46:38] different future
[46:39] but it's not because the dandelion was a
[46:42] bad dance it was a good dandelion just
[46:44] wasn't a corn seed
[46:45] and they and and it's the identity that
[46:48] established the different destinations
[46:51] for them
[46:53] and brother Branham says again later he
[46:55] says be careful here and see this it's
[46:58] not the person that comes predestinated
[47:01] eternally from God
[47:02] it's the word or seed so it's not again
[47:05] it's not this this lineup in gym class
[47:07] whether Tom it's a great volleyball
[47:10] player I want him on my team that's true
[47:12] that's true but that's not how God
[47:13] chooses God chooses some terrible
[47:16] volleyball players if you've seen people
[47:17] at Camp they could be God's children be
[47:19] terrible volleyball players but God
[47:20] doesn't choose baseball performance he
[47:23] chooses based upon the seed that's in
[47:25] them so again this is the wrong picture
[47:27] it gives us an entirely wrong picture of
[47:30] the grace of God and what the election
[47:31] is election
[47:34] is this
[47:35] this is the thought that God has for his
[47:38] garden before the foundation of the
[47:40] world
[47:42] we it's the word it's the seed not the
[47:44] personal attributes the personality the
[47:46] characteristics that's more or less
[47:48] irritating or more or less Pleasant to
[47:50] be around that has nothing to do with
[47:53] God's election
[47:54] Believers can be very irritating and
[47:56] annoying they can be very pleasant has
[47:58] nothing to do with those personality
[47:59] traits it's what's within them brother
[48:02] Branham talks about um this uh and think
[48:05] in the message things are to be talks
[48:07] about God's a Ganda variety there can be
[48:10] he loves big mountains he loves Hills he
[48:12] loves this kind of flower he loves this
[48:14] and that variety and he created us in a
[48:17] variety he talks about
[48:18] Peter and Paul they're both
[48:21] predestinated seat of God and they could
[48:24] Clash
[48:25] that the the people rub you the wrong
[48:28] way has nothing to do with whether or
[48:31] not there's a seed of God in you there's
[48:33] just we're creating a variety and
[48:34] sometimes God puts that variety together
[48:36] like he often does in marriages to bring
[48:40] out
[48:40] um different things in us but um we can
[48:44] just relax it it's it's the seed in us
[48:48] it's not the personality traits anything
[48:50] that makes a seed so we Rejoice
[48:53] because our names are written in heaven
[48:56] not because of anything we did or didn't
[48:58] do it just
[49:00] this is the soil that happened to have
[49:03] God's word sown in it and
[49:06] it's made my heart be good ground and
[49:09] yeah the devil is going to try to get
[49:11] weeds as close as possible and Lord how
[49:14] we be sensitive when the when the weeder
[49:16] comes along on a Sunday or a Wednesday
[49:19] and starts pulling on these different
[49:21] weeds that has to be done too because
[49:23] the good soil has to be maintained it's
[49:27] a good soil is not uh that's a lot of
[49:30] work I remember when we moved to uh to
[49:32] to Ohio I mean and and and the
[49:35] Netherlands it's rich soil I mean you
[49:38] just it's just it was really easy when
[49:41] my wife started getting the gar trying
[49:43] to plant things around their house and
[49:45] Lima it was all clay and she broke a
[49:48] couple Spades just trying to to get the
[49:52] dirt
[49:53] dug up and just out this is it was
[49:55] different kind of dirt but it takes time
[49:57] to start putting fertilizer and they're
[49:59] putting the nutrients in there that's
[50:01] like with our hearts
[50:02] I'm going to put the nutrients of God's
[50:05] spirit in there the nutrients of this
[50:06] word in there more water in there and we
[50:09] can see hey there could be times when we
[50:10] let our hearts get hard and yeah there
[50:12] might be a good seed in there we want to
[50:14] make it as easy as possible for that
[50:15] seed to take root and bring forth
[50:19] so here in the um here in the sardisian
[50:22] church age
[50:25] Christ speaks about the Overcomer can
[50:28] Rejoice because their names are written
[50:30] in heaven he had overcometh his name
[50:32] will not be blotted out from the book of
[50:34] life and it's because of election that
[50:38] that is the case an election is anything
[50:40] that we've done it's what God
[50:42] established before the foundation of the
[50:45] world
[50:46] and Lord willing
[50:47] um next time we'll take a look more at
[50:50] names that are in the book of life that
[50:53] perhaps have gotten removed at some
[50:56] point and we'll see why that could be
[50:59] the case because the Bible talks about
[51:00] that
[51:01] and I uh
[51:03] um I think of the quote of that William
[51:06] Booth has he said as you looked forward
[51:08] in the 20th century the greatest
[51:10] challenge will be Christianity without
[51:12] Christ
[51:13] talk about forgiveness about repentance
[51:16] and all these things and you when you
[51:19] when you see that
[51:20] that he had he was spot on and not
[51:24] everybody that names the name of Christ
[51:27] might actually have his name they might
[51:30] be in their own name but but still
[51:32] calling that uh his name and then you
[51:34] can see yeah there does have to be uh
[51:37] um a weeding a categorizing and we're
[51:40] not the ones who do that God does that
[51:41] but Lord willing we'll take a look at
[51:43] that
[51:44] next time and we can pray
[51:47] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[51:49] goodness and your grace to us Lord
[51:52] father I thank you that we can rest and
[51:56] uh and your calling Lord that uh and and
[52:00] your predestination Lord and that you
[52:03] who started the work will complete the
[52:04] work of God that we can rest in the work
[52:06] that you did Lord are just so
[52:08] encouraging seeing that it's nothing
[52:10] that Abraham did that's all of what you
[52:13] did in Him Father Lord I pray that you
[52:16] would help us to give ourselves over to
[52:18] you and and Lord just to just to
[52:21] acknowledge your your work and our lives
[52:23] and and surrender and respond father I
[52:26] pray that you'd help us to care for the
[52:28] soil and our hearts of God that no other
[52:30] seed try to take root in there Lord
[52:32] father I just pray that we would uh
[52:34] would bring forth good fruit o God and
[52:38] much fruit Lord then take some fruiting
[52:40] sometimes prunist that we might bring
[52:42] forth more and much food oh God Lord we
[52:46] love you I pray that you would establish
[52:48] us
[52:49] um and found us in your word father have
[52:52] your way in us oh God name of the Lord
[52:54] Jesus Christ
[52:55] hey
