And likewise ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yay, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility. For God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. So, if you're looking for a channel, if you're looking for an inlet, if you're looking for the the basics, the basics of how to move the heart of God and him to move toward you or to move towards your need, it's the first thing they give and that is that he resists the proud. But when there's true humility shown, then you're going in his direction. And when you're going in his direction, he starts coming in your direction. You see how this works then? And there's so that shows us there's certain things, there's certain attitudes, there's certain things that we if we hold on to that, it's it's not going to draw the heart of God. And so we have to be very um mindful of these things. So I love these scriptures because humble yourselves there therefore verse six, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God. How many believe he's a mighty a mighty God? Yeah. And he's able to step in with his mighty hand. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time. All this is about your it's it's about you coming towards him and then him coming toward you. Casting all your care upon him for he carth for you. To be honest with you, as a pastor, I've been on a little bit of a inward journey. It's been an inward journey for me, just me and God. And uh for my own deeper discovery of myself and my life in Christ. Uh and you know, whenever you find more uh of your life in Christ and more of yourself and how the enemy and your weaknesses and study those things, how the enemy uses, whenever you go on that journey, it's real I was in the chiropractor office today and they always do unique things in there and I walk in just to get my back adjusted and the nurse said, "We're we're taking we're saying, "What's the first thought come that come to you this morning? What's a good point to encourage everybody in the office today?" So, what what's your thought today? And we're going to type it in and they'll probably put it on the walls and everything. And so, let me think for a minute. And so I thought I said you I said the journey of the heart is a dangerous one and uh a scary one but it's always worth it. That's what I said and everybody was quiet in the whole office, you know, they're trying to ponder this deep thought from a pastor, you know, but it's the first thing to come to my mind, you know, but I can say personally that I'm I'm kind of on that journey now. And I don't know why we wait so long. Some of us wait too long to do it, but you can be a Christian for years, but you just desire to go deeper. and you just desire that if there's any hindrances and things in my life that I'm holding on to, not talking about sin as such, but things that's in the heart that's unresolved or complexes, whatever they I'm just on a real uh close journey with the Lord with that. And I don't know how long that'll be, but all I know is when we do that, it's more freedom. We can be ourselves more in Christ. And uh and and then I always study these things too so that I can be more equipped as a pastor and a counselor to have more equipped with more discernment to be able to help others because I want to be more effective in helping other people. And so it is it has been and so here's what it was been on my heart and that is this comes from a sermon brother Brand preached. He cares. Do you care? He cares. Do you care? And so, um, I want to just take my time and go slow. That doesn't mean tonight I'll take my time, but I don't know how many more series I'll get into in this, but I just want to just break ground on it tonight a little bit. See, see, maybe if you can join me, and you're welcome, of course, to listen to that sermon and uh, just take it in while we study a little bit. But there's something in here. And when you have a title and a sermon that's called He Cares, Do You Care? I would say that that uh at face value, this seems like a general sermon concerning the heart of God that cares. And it is. And and uh even the title, even the title would draw us all in to maybe want to listen to it or to do that because we're interested in a God who cares. How many is interested in a God who cares? Most of us have been Christians for a long time. So we already basically know that maybe even a surface level, we know God cares. We know there he's a God who cares. But uh and and and that's a wonderful thing. It's and it's it's so you know uh he cares. Do you care? It it's it's something that reminds us that God I like to be reminded that God cares and at a certain level just knowing that he cares can bring comfort to us when we go through a pain and we go through different things in life. Just knowing that he cares. But I just wanted to say tonight, it does not say in this title that just that he cares, but it says he cares. Do you care? That's right. And so there's a little bit more to it than just standing back and saying he cares and I know God cares, but there's another element to it and actually brings us into it. He cares, but do you care? And it I can't help but just think that there's a certain uh uh supernatural thing that begins to work here when you have both sides working. When you have God who cares and is ready and willing to take every situation that he already knows about every pain, every situation, every loss, every sin, everything, every mistake that you made, he's aware of all of it. And he cares for all those things. He cares for for what it is that you're going through tonight. He cares for what you've been through when you were a little child. He has a care. He has an understanding of that. He knows it. And he cares for your heart in that. So there's no question of that. But this title takes it deeper because there's another side to it. He cares. Do you care? It it makes me think that you could have a caring God who cares, but if you have someone who didn't show the fruits that they cared, then it's not going to work. So the complete there's a complete picture and when we say that he just he cares it's not complete without our side being engaged. There's another element to our side that comes in and with our our without our side being engaged then it's not a complete picture. Is I is he still a caring god when men don't care? Is he still a caring god when men don't care? The answer is yes. It doesn't change his caring. He's still a caring God even when men turn their back on him. Even when men backslide, even men win. That didn't take away from the caring God. He's still a caring God. Even when men don't care. Yes. But see, limitations are put on the results when the other side is saying the with words or with actions, I don't care. And I want to emphasize that because people can say with their words that they care about God, about him helping them, but their actions may speak something different. So I want to emphasize that if we're saying with if we're saying with our mouth that we believe God cares and I care that he cares, but we have to show it with our actions. If our actions say I don't care because people can say with their actions, I don't really care. Uh words can say a lot. Uh but Jesus said there are people who honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me. How many remember Jesus saying that? So I don't want to be that way. And there's a quote I want to bring in this series that he said we must get our subconscious is all saying it. But because maybe you're past, there's a bunch of hesitation in your subconscious and it's not really believing. There's a little bit of unbelief. There's lies there. There's scares there. You're afraid to believe because you don't trust completely. So if you've got a subconscious that's not on board, but you got a conscience saying yes, yes, yes. Brother Bram says if we could get believers with their subconscience and conscience lined up with really believing, something's going to happen. And so we have to be a deep people to say Lord if there be any unbelief in me. Wasn't there a man in the Bible says God I believe but help thou my unbelief. You could say well I thought you believed. What about what are you saying about unbelief? He's saying that if there's any unbelief in me Lord help that. Care for that because I can confess what Lord I'm saying. I believe but help my unbelief. Help the areas that are weak. Help anything that the devil is using there to hold me back. My past, my upbringing, my legalistic background, oh God, help me not to let that hold me back from you. The devil can use a lot of stuff to hold people back in their hearts. And yet, they're on board at church. They know this is right. I believe the message. I've been raised this way. But listen, we got to go deeper than that. Amen. So you can never get to the full completion of a God who cares if you got your li as Jesus said your lips honor me your heart is far from me that ain't going to work we want the full completion so there are both sides uh these what happens is both sides are caring for the situation and I say situation there's a need there's a there's a healing that's needed there's a there's something there's a financial need that's needed and so automatically we know God cares right God cares is about to need. But you see now when it works where there's a supernatural connection with both sides caring for the situation. And when that is there, both sides are coming. The potential is there for a supernatural God to step in and not only say that he cares, but actually step into the situation and do something about it. That's what we want to see. That's what we're hungry for. We're hungry for apostolic times to move us again. move among us again. What is that? That's a supernatural God that's actually been released among us. There's nothing holding him up from doing this supernatural work. We need it. Can you say amen? And it's not like I'm going to work it up by the music or work it out by something. No, no, no. We need our faith anchored. We need our hearts anchored. We need to be stable. Can you say amen? In an age of emotional instability, we need to know our place in the word and stand there and say, "I believe this with all my heart. I believe God's going to do this." And so when there's a there's a there's a connection of these two parts that really care, then something supernatural can come in, a point a a meeting point where where a caring God can meet with a heart that cares for help. A heart that that then and when that happens, there's a heart that really cares for help. I'm willing to do what I need to do because I need help. And then you got a caring God when then that meets and we see it all this situation the need is affected by a supernatural God. Some sermons which I believe this he cares do you care is a key and you remember God is wanting to hand the keys of the kingdom to his people because not everybody has the keys. Not everybody has the keys to this church. Not everybody has the keys to my office. Not every, you see, so it's just a select few. And Jesus, you say, well, my goodness, whosoever will will come. Yeah, that's right. He welcomes everyone, but not everybody will receive it. And so he says, it's given unto you to know though the mysteries. Then when he comes to the kingdom covenant, the kingdom comes by the filling of the Holy Ghost. What's the first thing it do? He said, Peter, I've given you the keys to the kingdom. So, it's not just that you have the kingdom in you by the Holy Ghost, but God wants you to give to give you the keys. And when you have the keys, it unlocks more of the kingdom to you. See, you I got a key now. I'll stick it in there. I could have called this the principle. He cares you. I don't want to. The principle is used too much. The principle it's gets too. But when you talk about the key, that's to the children of God. He gives us the keys and you get a little key. It unlock unlocks faith to you. It unlocks more to you, more of where your position is in Christ. And I feel that some sermons are the keys to unlock. And and so this service definitely is because it's the keys to the kingdoms in the hands of the people. This sermon, I believe this service uh of he cares, you hear is not only encouraging, but a key to something for here that we want to look at. He cares. Do you care? So, let's go back to our scriptural base. All right, it's uh I just want to comment on that, not pass it too quickly. 1 Peter chapter 5. As I said, I'm taking this real slow. Chapter 5. 1 Peter chapter 5. And we read verse 5. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. All of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility. This is one of these scriptures here that rarely gets preached on. And I'm going to say too, I don't see a lot of this in the true body of Christ. Still, what don't you see, brother Paul? All of you submit yourself one to another. There's some other scriptures I don't hear preach very much and don't see. Confess your faults one to another in the fear of God. It'll affect your faith when you're praying for the sick. Confess your faults for another to one another. And the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. So it's not just your effectual fervent. What makes it more effectual? Confessing our faults. And I rarely see it in the body of Christ. I rarely see that kind of honesty. One brother said there's just not trust. You know, somebody might go tell somebody or whatever. So, so it it it just doesn't happen. There's some other ones. There's some other scriptures that we don't uh you know, see sometimes. Uh I think there's one back there in Peter or John that says, "If there any come among you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God's speed. For he that bidth him God's speed is a partaker of his evil deeds deeds." just somebody's bringing apostasy that's contrary to what the doctrine that's been brought. Don't even receive them in your home and don't wish them God speed. Don't say God bless you and it's all quiet. These are in your Bible, too. But you don't hear that type of thing preached. And yet, we must be missing a benefit because we need those protections in place. Sometimes there's a s there's one place that says to withdraw yourself from a brother who walks disorderly. goes on to say later, don't treat him like an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. But it actually says to withdraw yourself from a brother who's acting that way for a time. We don't want to hear these things, but you see that they are things that are part of the body of Christ. And this is a scripture I think that we submitting ourselves one to another. I'm going to read it in the amplified verse 5. Likewise, you younger men of lesser rank and experience, be subject to your elders. Seek their counsel. Another thing I don't see very much is the younger seeking the counsel of the elder. But the Bible says to do it. Be subject to your elders. Seek the counsel. And all of you clothe yourself with humility towards one another. Tie on the servants's apron. That's what the Bible says. This is submitting ourselves one to another. It says, "Tie yourself onto your servant's apron." In other words, you find the right thing, you trust, cling on to that. A lot of people in the body of Christ and in this message miss opportunities for the nine spiritual gifts, word of wisdom, these different things. They miss it because they will not uh submit themselves to it, give themselves fellowship to it. So God could speak something through somebody. Oh, I just caught a key there from a member of the body of Christ. I've caught something. They spoke it, brother. You didn't know it, but God spoke through that. Help me cuz I now I know what to go do. We're missing a lot of what God has supplied in the body of Christ because we live too much to an island to ourselves and there's a lot of lack of trust out there and that's why people don't trust anymore. But we cannot start having a lack of trust in what God provides for us. That's Satan's work is to cause us to lack of trust in something that we really need. We can't be an island in the body of Christ. And I'm not forcing you to be friends, but I I'm saying don't miss out on the opportunity of not just the preaching, but what the body provides. Cuz where's Christ today? He's not in the message books. He's not in our Bibles. He's in his people. Christ is in his people. Say, "But they look too flawed and there's too many mistakes and I've got too many mistakes." No, I'm not talking about your mistakes. I'm not talking I'm talking about where Christ is. He's in his people. Don't underestimate when he says, "Submit yourself one to another. Tie onto the servants's apron. For God is opposed to the proud, the disdainful, the presumptuous, and he defeats them, but he gives grace unto the humble." And then the next scripture, he says, verse six, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time." So when we realize what the Lord is saying, I want to get back to this. Now, humility will humility will put you forward to God. Pride will put you backwards away from God. Humility says that I really care to get help. Cuz I'm coming broken. I'm coming humbly. Uh even when it comes down to just people admitting that they made mistakes, they can't do it. Can't do it to one another. Sometimes they can't do it to God. I feel so defeated. I can't even go to God with this. But God wants you to come to him. He's welcomed you to come in humility. Well, he don't want to hear what I've got to hear. Listen, he's heard it all. And he actually knows what you did before you even come to him. So, he wants you to humbly come back to him and say, "I need help. I don't want to go to some other source for help. I want to come to you, Lord. I've done this. I've done that." Or maybe it's not something you've done. Maybe I'm in dire need. I'm fighting for my life here and I'm coming humbly before you. I have no other source. But we've got to come humbly. And this is probably a foundational thing is this grace. He says humility will put you forward to God for grace to come to you. All of us want grace to come to us. We want Mr. Grace. We need grace. We need his help. Humble yourselves and that brings you towards him to lift you up. And we say he'll exalt you in due time. Well, it doesn't mean necessarily a position, but he'll lift you up. How many want God to lift you up when you're down in the mud? You want God to lift you up. God, I need help. You know, you you guys all know the the story of the man who was drowning and and he says, "God, help me. God, help me." And this guy comes by with a helicopter and then another guy comes by with a boat and he keeps turning him down cuz he says, "I asked God to help me." And they drown because three times God sends the helicopter, God sends the boat, God sends another person to help him, and he turns I asked God to help me. Listen, humble yourself to the way God is going to help you. Can I get an amen? We don't make an idol out of God and we don't say, "God, I want you to answer and I want you to answer this way." We don't do that. We humbly say, "I need help. However, you can help me, Lord." It's the right entrance. It's the right way to approach God. That's gets rid of pride because pride he won't respond to. But humility puts you in a position he'll lift you up and he'll come towards you. And then at the end of it, he says, and I just want to get that just before we get to the end, may exalt you in due time. There's a process. So now we're coming to to him showing we care, showing, Lord, teach me. Lord, purge me. Lord, I've got a lot of baggage from my past. Lord, I need you to purge me. I need you to clean me. I got I need you to heal me. My heart is so damaged by my past. I need you to heal me. And when you come humbly, he'll do it, but he'll do it in his time. It does not mean that God cares and is caring is endorsing sin. It does not mean that he helps hide things that you're hiding. He doesn't care. Say, "Well, God cares and he helps you hide things that you're hiding." That's not a God who cares. You understand? And so it does not mean that he helps hide things with you. It does not mean that he coddles your feelings or your lack of faith. God cares, but it he doesn't show he cares by just coddling your feelings or coddling your gossip or joining in with your gossip or coddling your lack of faith. He doesn't coddle demon spirits. He doesn't coddle just your feelings because this is the way I'm feeling. It must be the truth. So God, do you care about my feelings? Well, God cares that you have about your feelings, but he doesn't care to coddle your feelings. He will care with understanding, with affection, but he he will care with truth. Always truth. And you should say, "Thank you, Lord, that you'll be truthful." He'll speak the truth in love to you even if it hurts. Because the way he cares, this way we need to care for one another. The way God cares is through affection and understanding and discernment and truth. He will show that he cares not just by standing back and saying the words, "I care for you as a God." God doesn't come all the way back distant from your life and just, you know, fold his arms and say, "I just want to let you all know I care. I really care." That may be how some people do it, but that's not the way God cares. And this is my one of my biggest points tonight. God shows he cares when he steps in and does something about it. He doesn't just say, "I care." but he wants to step into your situation and show his supernatural way to show that he cares for watching our service today.
