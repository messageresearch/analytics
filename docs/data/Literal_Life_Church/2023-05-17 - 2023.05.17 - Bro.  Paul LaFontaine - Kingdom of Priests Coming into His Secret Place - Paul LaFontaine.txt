TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to Exodus 19 in the Bible if you could we welcome our visitors tonight God bless you good to have you with us and hope to meet you after the service and God is good all the time and we're glad to be with you this Wednesday night to study the word together and to feel that his presence is here it's so much easier to preach when we've invited him and made him feel welcome and we're just happy to be in his house tonight and we have our special meetings this weekend remember on Saturday night at six o'clock we'll be here with brother Jason excuse me brother Matt Watkins his son Matt Watkins from South Carolina will be with us Saturday night Sunday morning and then five o'clock for the Tri-State Sunday night so remember our meetings and then the weekend after that Memorial Day weekend we're announcing the meetings over at Brother Sam Browning's Friday Saturday and Sunday and we'd like to participate in some of those I'd like you to do it if you can as well brother Nathan Brian will be speaking over there so those are Friday Saturday and Sunday as well and Memorial Day weekend but this weekend it's Saturday night at here at six o'clock here at the church and I know you enjoy the word we let the pastors know in the area today and so we have some people coming out to fellowship with us for the meetings and they've been announcing it so we're excited about that Exodus 19 and verse 3 if you would here and Moses went up unto God the prophet of God went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel so now God is telling the prophet to go tell the people something and this is what he told the people you have seen God saying you've seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if he will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant I just want you to stop and recognize now what God is saying he just gave his whole history with the children of Israel he said what have I done he says I you've seen what I did to the Egyptians I took care of your enemy phase one and then and then I bore You On Eagle's Wings now in this Wilderness journey I bore You On Eagle's Wings phase two and then he says I brought you unto myself which is a revelation of the mystery of why God did all that and that is to bring you to himself to bring you to himself aren't you glad that that's the purpose God's bringing you to himself he'll use miracles to do it he'll destroy your enemy in the Red Sea to do it he'll do whatever needs to be done but the purpose is to bring you to himself because he wants relationship with you now therefore if you will obey my voice if you follow my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest plural a kingdom of priests a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel Heavenly Father we thank you for your glory just sweeping through the building tonight and Lord we just we can't worship you enough Lord when the people lift their Praise You inhabit those Praises God has been a joy father to express ourselves in this way and that song saying lift our head if you're faithful to us Lord God in the loss of time we can lift our head to you and know that redemption's drawing nigh Lord I pray you anoint us tonight with your word anoint us with your spirit Lord that we could say those words that encourage everyone in their Christian walk and their Journey relationship with you Lord may we lay guide every doubt every fear Lord every depression anything that would hinder us I pray we'd lay it aside tonight Lord and just look and behold your face we commit the service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody said amen God bless you may be seated I'm directed by the Lord back to this small portion of text that I read last Wednesday night in Exodus 19 and I believe that it's there's more in here that I'd like to preach on a little bit and that it shows and unveils to me the final purpose of God through many of the mighty acts that God did you got to realize with the children of Israel he did some mighty acts some mighty things that he hadn't hadn't done for four or five hundred years and then God visits his people God sends a prophet and then God begins to display himself in such a powerful and a mighty way I don't think until this day God displayed him out himself to that many people two million is what come out of Egypt and I don't think God displayed himself until today to in that way of Mighty acts like he did to the children of Israel it was awesome it was amazing the things that God did you couldn't deny that God had not come down and visited his people and he opened the Red Sea and he brought water out of the rock for them and he brought bread and he just did so many marvelous things and then he destroyed as he said the Egyptians for them the enemy and so there was so many mighty things done but I believe these scriptures just a few scriptures we read right in the middle of all that there's a there's a revealing of God's purpose you see because when God does something Mighty or many things Mighty like that it's to grab our attention but whatever he's doing he has a final purpose to it God is a god of purpose God doesn't do anything just to fill time God doesn't do anything just to just to show off God doesn't do anything just that you can continue to watch his mighty acts he always has a final purpose to it and and so this is what I believe these scriptures reveal you're seeing the fight there's always a final purpose and you're seeing the the purpose and and let me just say it this way seeing God's purpose is very very very important and matter of fact it's probably the most important out of your experience with God is seeing his purpose of why he's doing it as a matter of fact you could watch God in your whole life and not catch his purpose and what a shame that would be because God has an achievement he has something he's trying to do even in the hour we live in he has an achievement something that he wants to accomplish something he wants to get done can you say man I've always aligned myself since 16 years old with God's achievement for this hour I said Lord whatever it is you're trying to achieve it's not about my career it's not about my achievement it's not about my vision my goals although you have goals I think it's good but you must align your achievements and your goals and your career and your college choice or whatever it is a young person you should align your dreams and your goals and your achievements with what God's achievement is for this hour young couple that you you've been married you've got a young family you should pray and say God what can we do for the kingdom of God how can we align our careers and our jobs and our paycheck every week with God's purpose for this hour because there's nothing everything else is empty you know why would you want to put all your money into something and then it just doesn't mean anything someday the only meaning only one life will soon be passed only What's Done For Christ will last my mom here used to sing that song Only One Life till soon it will pass only What's Done For Christ is going to last only one chance to do his will so give to Jesus all your days it's the only life that pays when we recall we only have but one life how many rations are going to say we only have we only get one we only get in the on this Earth anyway now we know we have eternity but on this Earth we only have one chance boy I want to do it right don't you we only have one chance we better do it right and we better not wait till opportunities to come we better say Lord you've given me this paycheck and maybe it's a big paycheck or maybe it's little it doesn't matter doesn't matter are you saying Lord what can I do for the kingdom of God what can my family do for the kingdom of God if you don't have that then you're not catching God's purpose and so God has a purpose for everything he has a vision and seeing that vision is so important if we don't see it what happens when we don't see God's purpose if we don't see God's in purpose and what he's doing then we might get hung up on all the details in between it might get hung up on people get hung up on the details people get hung up on God people get hung up on God's law people get hung up on God's principles people get hung up on what God tells them to do and say oh why is God asking me to do that I don't understand and so they might get hung up on the details and why is it they lack seeing God's purpose in all of it because there's a purpose there's an in purpose there's a there's a reason why God says everything he says there's a there's a final end to it can you say amen and what would it be if you didn't understand the end can you say amen and you're trying to figure out why he's saying this now but you don't understand his purpose God has a purpose in it and so you're always praying saying God give me a vision show me a vision show me what your purpose is for this hour and show you show me what my purpose is because if we don't catch that then we might get snagged we might get hung up on the details and or people might get hung up on depending too much on watching Miracles the Bible speaks of sign Seekers the the the the the the uh there's a certain group of people in the New Testament they were followed the signs they were saying Jews are somewhat that way they seek signs we would become just sign Seekers of God if we're not catching his purpose the sign is not his final purpose and so we can't just be sign Seekers but we must be purpose Seekers saying Lord what's your purpose what happens when we don't get his purpose and we don't get the vision it's because we because we maybe don't want to see it or we're not crying for it God show me your purpose and why you sent this message show me your purpose and why you said this in this hour what's the final result of everything God I want to know what your purpose is if we don't we get hung up on the details and we become a sign seeker and by that we stop short uh like I was saying on Sunday about the farmer the husbandmen who here he is he he has faith in the seed that's been planted in the ground that it says he has long be patient unto the coming of the Lord he has long patience for it until he received the former and latter raid why does he have patience because he's got a faith and a confidence in the seed that's been planted it's the right seed it's the good seed and the good seed has been planted not by him but by the son of man and when you have a confidence in what's been planted then God for a farmer he knows if that's good conditions and it's a good seed and there's going to be the right sunshine and the the right Reign which by the way is all up to God you realize the farmer is completely dependent on God for his crop he may take his tracker and tractor and tear up the you know and break up the fallow ground and then they may have uh things today tractors to plant the seed and all that but you see it's got to be good seed but once it's planted in the ground then he stands back and he's he has to have faith in the seed and then he's completely dependent on the sun and the rain can you say amen and God provides that so when we know that God's in our life then we step back and say God I know this will be right if you're in it can you say Amen and and and so the farmer he has faith in the seed but I want to I don't want to preach that sermon again but he has faith in the scene and who planted it and the vision a farmer can see if if the conditions are right he has a vision of what's going to come out of that ground he sees a full crop coming up there's a purpose in planting the seed and because he sees that purpose it's easy for him to be patient and wait for God to do it amen he has patience he waits on the full purpose to be fulfilled so millions of people even Christians have struggles over history because they did not see the purpose of God millions of people even Christians throughout history 2 000 years of church history even in the Old Testament there's been people that struggled there's been people that have that has fears they they haggle over things they they struggle within themselves sometimes you can't see it outside but they struggle within themselves and many times it's because they don't see the purpose of God they don't see and they get hung up on trying to understand him in their own mind we can't understand God in our own mind his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his life is higher than our life can you say Amen his purpose is greater than our purpose and people get up hung up trying to understand them in their own mind why is God asking me to do this why does God ask us to wear this why well this is strange and it's because it's strange to them because they don't see the purpose the long-range result of God in his mind and what he's trying to accomplish correction of God correction from God is mostly resisted do you realize that God's correction is mostly resisted in people but it's because they don't understand the purpose in the correction I think Paul mentions it where he says our fathers in the flesh corrected us and spanked us and you know disciplined us for their own Prophet for their own benefit but he says our father chastens us his sons not for his own benefit but it's for our benefit so God's chastening God's correction has a purpose it has an intent behind it aren't you glad can you say Amen but most people resist the correction of God because why they don't see the purpose of God behind it they just see they're being corrected they only see the moment you did wrong I'm correcting you for it but God has a much bigger purpose in correction when he comes and corrects you God has a vision God has a correction for your life and that correction is to bring something good history has these people struggling many times and I believe that I believe God has Grace for people who struggle especially when we realize that the scripture speaks about God holding back his full mystery till the end time Daniel started to see some things by vision this will be a little bit teaching preaching tonight so it's preaching Daniel had a thing and but then he was told seal this up Jeremiah had something there in a scroll he said seal it up and then even when you get to the the end time as far as John on the Isle of Patmos he began to see and and and watch what the watch what was being uttered in the Mysteries under the Seven Seals and and he was about to write and he said no seal it up it's not time for it yet so there's a certain holding back that God does to the full mystery because he has a time for it and that's why there's a scripture that says God for many years winked at ignorance because the full purpose and mystery of God wasn't unveiled to the end time Revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished not back in Jesus day not back in Daniel's day it was there was certain parts held back but there would be a time that God fully pours out his purpose his mystery can you say Amen so that's why I think he has Grace there was a time that God winked at ignorance but now there's a time he doesn't because when he fully lets his purpose know that's when that's the time for us to latch onto it and say God you show me what your full purpose is from Genesis to Revelation you've opened up your uh what you've done even what happened in heaven before Earth was here before the fall came in the garden you opened up all the way back what happened in heaven when Lucifer fell you've unveiled his schemes then you opened up what happened in the garden that it wasn't an apple that it was sin in the garden can you say Amen that there was two seeds that come from the Garden of Eden you've opened all that up today and through Genesis to Revelations at the last days he says I'm going to do this and my purpose is to show my my in purpose and my mystery to the people he held it back so that's why I say there's some Grace for people who struggle through the years and struggle God I don't understand why you're saying that God I understand why'd you ask us to wear that God I don't understand this and and I believe it's because people do not know the full purpose and mystery that was held until the end time he even says it this way by lack of this Revelation is the reason we have so much Division and denomination Among Us so in other words if the full purpose of God was known you wouldn't have division amongst the people of God by lack of this revelation of the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed and by lack of this Revelation is the reason why we have so many divisions Among Us that's the way he said it by lack of this Revelation is the reason that we have trouble and then besides God prayer God's purpose let me just move along now then we we we're seeing our own purpose as well but let's just say this you can't see your purpose without seeing God's purpose you can't understand why you're here on Earth unless you understand what God's purpose is it's linked together can you say Amen why would somebody want to say I'm going to figure out what my purpose is in life but I don't believe there's a God didn't work that way matter of fact you're in trouble if you ignore God in a lot of ways you're going to be in trouble you can't go without God you can't go without his his Revelation and his his personal relationship with you you can't approach marriage or finances or life or death without God so when you're trying to find your purpose then you can't see your purpose without seeing God's actually God's ultimate purpose and achievement can never be separate from you personally now that's a strong statement but I can confidently make it is that God God's ultimate purpose and achievement that he wants to achieve can never be separate from you personally the elect of God because his achievement is related to you his final achievement is related to you you say God I'm not a part of this you just go ahead and fulfill your final word no no his final achievement is to express himself through his people so your purpose is interlinked with his purpose this mystery is comes back to us Paul said Christ The Mystery of God revealing as Paul said Christ in you the hope of glory you can't separate God's purpose from it being related personally to you and I don't mean a group because you can't say well God's purpose is a Revival around the world God's purpose finally is God being revealed personally to you if no one else if the theologians don't understand it God doesn't care if the theologians don't understand it he doesn't care systems don't understand it the final Revelation the final the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you personally to Haley personally personally sister personally to brother Tom it's personal it's not a group it's not a church can you say Amen the final purpose of God is revealed to you personally so you can't say I'm going to find my purpose in life without finding God's purpose because you are God's purpose oh we should be shouting over that you are God's purpose you are God's final achievement he went to Calvary for you man so it it's this there's something here that's uh interesting another Minister quoted this the other day he would speak in another place and I just listened to a little bit of it and he quoted this out of why Christ speak he says God has a God God has got a purpose of you being here this is the uh 1963 why Christ speak God has got a purpose of you being here see if you could only get to that place where you find your purpose how much trouble you'd save God in yourself oh my now I'm going to stop right here and preach for an hour you're going to tell me that that's the problem and you would save God a lot of trouble and save yourself a lot of trouble in life if we just if you could just find your purpose in God so Trouble Comes when we don't find our purpose if you don't have it tonight say God this is my priority tonight God show me my purpose while I'm on Earth show me why I'm here Lord show me I'm a son and daughter of God and what not just what I'm supposed to do show me who I'm supposed to be then you'll show you what to do in the kingdom of God but but look at that if you can only find that place of your purpose how much trouble you'd save God in yourself too if you just find your place what kind of trouble have you caused because you weren't in your position you weren't in your place what kind of trouble have you brought to God well I haven't brought any trouble I doubt it you've probably brought quite a bit of trouble to God and you probably got try to get quite a bit of trouble to your life and maybe your finances or whatever else because you don't know your you don't know your purpose yet I know a young man or a young woman sometimes can cause a lot of trouble because they don't know who they are yet they have an identity crisis so now they're trying to be a basketball star and then the next week they're trying to be this and they're trying to be that and parents can't figure it out because they have an identity crisis they haven't found out who they are in Christ yet come on now say Amen you know that's true they have an identity crisis and so they haven't found their purpose in life and they can cause a lot of people a lot of trouble matter of fact some of them end up in prison because they're still trying to find themselves still still trying to get a purpose in life they go from thing to thing and and they're a mess they cause God a lot of trouble they cause themselves a lot of trouble but it's not just people that go to prison all of us can be that way when we don't find our purpose and that's why the purpose of God is essential the purpose the mystery of God what is the mystery of my life what is the mystery of God I must personally find that or else I'll struggle even with the scriptures sometimes the purpose of God is revealed you see I can go down to Ephesians chapter one you know what I don't think I'll leave it out Ephesians chapter one just to confirm how important that God's purpose is how many believe that God has a purpose let's not let that become common to us to us God has his acts he has his miracles he has so many things that he has done and will do can you say Amen our faith applied to the word will heal cancer our faith and applied to the word will open up the blinded eyes I said that on Sunday but it's not just what God can do it's what's his purpose because performing Miracles is not his final purpose so it's important that we find the purpose of God and here in Ephesians 1 it speaks about it just so you know uh picking it up here in verse 3 blessed be the god of our father Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Heavenly places is the believer's position standing in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him when that night at the altar no he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of our will of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather now we're in our day we're in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together and want all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to what according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of our will of the government's will he's working everything according oh I like this type of counseling this type of counseling he's working his purpose according to in work of all things after the counsel of his own will what does his will say and he's going to work that and bring his purpose to pass and we're a part of that purpose by predestination how many can raise your hands Thank God I'm a part of his purpose that we should be to the praise of his glory so I want to let you know this is a priority when he's speaking to the Ephesians the purpose of God is priority for believers it's not just the miracles of god it's not just the signs of God it's it's not just heaven in the future but it's what God is showing you in a mystery for your lives right now can you say Amen I had a nice my wife and I had a nice lunch with sister Claire today nice fellowship and I was listening to a song on the way over and asked I figured she'd knew it she did know it it's an older bluegrass gospel song and it says everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die I thought man that's the good lyric everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die oh no I don't want to die but everybody wants to go to heaven and they don't want to die physically they're scared of dying because they're not ready to die and people don't want to die to themselves people don't want to die to their own will yet they want to go to heaven but remember Jesus died in the garden before he died on the cross and he died to his own will he had a will can you say amen and he said not my will but thine be done people want to go to heaven but they don't want to die and you can't go to heaven without dying to yourself your mentality your former religious training Paul said I had to consider all my former religious training as dung in order to receive Christ you die to yourself you die to your habits you die to your sin you die for your sinful habits and you die to your former religious training you say God I'm starting from fresh I want to learn of you because I want your purpose from my life somebody say praise the Lord so the purpose of God in Exodus 19 is revealed to the Jews listen now I want you to catch these points the purpose of God in the scriptures that I read is revealed to the Jews before all the Commandments after all the Miracles had been done through the Wilderness and before the laws came right in the middle God gives a few uh a few things he says to the Jews through the prophet that is his purpose revealed and it's a simple hidden purpose of all the Miracles purpose of the law coming is to bring you to myself I'm going to bring these things up because it's revealed right here it's to bring you to myself that's Oneness God says I want to bring you to myself think about all the Commandments and I'm going to talk about how many they are here in just a minute if you don't know think about all the Miracles he did before this before Exodus 19. think about all the Commandments coming down the road in the next few the next 20 chapters is Commandments so you get all these Miracles and you get all these Commandments and right in between just four verses God says to the people but but here here's what it is I did these things and I will do these things that I could bring you to myself that I could be one with you and we know he couldn't fully fulfill that until Jesus went to Calvary you realize that but when he went to Calvary and took care of our sin we could truly become one with Christ how many want to be one with them and so the mystery is that it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's Oneness it's you in Christ becoming one and you may see the Miracles you may see the you may believe and love all the law of God and the word of God instead of the word of God but what's it all for what's the purpose that I could bring you unto myself and Oneness that you could follow my voice and Obey it all along the way and if you do that I will fulfill my purpose in you and he mentions this last thing that he shall be unto me a kingdom of priest I know I won't get to all of this tonight but this opens up a whole nother Revelation I want you to be a kingdom of priests you say well what's that mean it means a lot because remember God God didn't say here my purpose is I want you all to keep watching me do miracles my purpose here is that I'm getting ready to bring you about 20 chapters of laws and I need you to just obey all my laws that's not the full purpose my purpose here is to build a kingdom of priests and that means a couple of things that means that I will bring you into relationship with me a priest has access to God complete access to the inner Chambers and secret of God wait a minute wait a minute we're we're the children of Israel we're two million of us here and we're a group we do this as a group and God says but that's not my purpose I want a whole Kingdom of priests which means every one of you individually brother Josiah sister Hannah brother Kenny he starts to point out names and say I'm going to make you a kingdom a priest that means every one of you individually has access to me has access to my mystery the coming day that I won't have to speak through a prophet anymore I'll start it that way but my final mystery isn't to send a prophet my final purpose is not sending a prophet I use that I will always use that but that's not the final purpose the purpose is I don't want a kingdom of prophets I want a kingdom of people that have access to God the priest is the one that had had uh what do they call that today when you have access so you have a clearance the priests are the ones the only ones that the high priest the only one had clearance into the inner chamber they had it and he's saying I want everybody to have clearance I want a whole Kingdom of ones that have clearance they don't have to go through anybody they have clearance they can go in the inner Veil themselves they can see my secrets I'll tell them my secrets I'll whisper my secrets to them and then they will come in and go out because that's what the priest did and the second part of her priesthood is what's so wonderful they have access to God they can come in the inner Veil but the main part of a priest is he's a mediator between God and humans a priest is a mediator between God and humans and they will go between and they'll go catch the mystery of God and then they'll come back and they'll be able to bring God to the people can you say Amen they'll they'll be able to pray for people and it won't just be the preachers praying for people it won't be the big evangelist everyone will be a priest unto God and have access to God and when they lay hands on the sick they'll recover somebody say praise the Lord you don't have to wait for the pastor to pray for you you don't have to wait for the evangelists for the next convention you don't have to wait you are a priest unto God you have access to God you can lay hands on the sick I think of that little room in the vision that little room I was pointing this way because there was a big tent there was a big following but in the vision he says then I'll meet you in there and it was individuals going through that room nobody knew what happened until they come out the other side and they were healed the lame were healed they come out with healing on the other side you enter that little room privately secret that little place the Bible speaks of it everywhere there's an outer Court to the Tabernacle there's an inner court but then there's the holy of holies that only the high priest could come in can you say Amen we are our three-part Temple outer Court inner court and then our souls can you say Amen where God comes in the soul I believe Believers need to live from the soul not their flesh but live from the soul Jesus said when you pray he says don't pray openly like that go to your father in secret in a closet it's all speaking of the Bride coming into that secret place and she's the only one that has clearance to do it think about it friends think about it I want a whole Kingdom of not prophets not laborers not workers not chair stackers not just chair stackers not laborers I want a kingdom of priest and he don't give age groups I'd like some 14 15 year old that come to their place in position and they can get access to God at 14 years old there's no age on it baptized we got a baptism coming this a young girl that we've been praying for in this assembly and and I've been praying for all the young people that they'd be baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and it's going to happen it's going to happen those who don't have the Holy Ghost is going to receive it it's going to be baptized this Sunday by the grace of God praise the Lord amen so so you see now that it's a mediator and so we want to take some time on that at another time my my subject tonight is the purpose behind and so I want to look at this the Miracles was not the final purpose the laws were not the final purpose but sandwiched in between this is what he will do if we will follow his voice remember that voice came through his prophet in that day that voice come through his Prophet what he wanted to say to the people came through the prophet and so if that that history repeats itself I was saying something Sunday that if you don't believe that the that the Bible can repeat itself and God can do the same thing again just like a Miracles there's a lot of denominations that say God did that in the book of Acts but he can't do that again you don't have a right to say that whatever God did in the Bible he can do it tonight whatever God did in the Bible he can do tonight whatever it is and you don't have a right to say that he can't but it's not just Miracles they can do tonight but God can repeat what he did in past history by sending a prophet and then that Prophet brings the word and then that people get a hold of the word and God begins to build from there he's done the same thing in the end time he prophesied Elijah Malachi 45 and zinc he said it would happen again I'll speak through my Elijah in the end time and that'll bring the people back to the original faith God doesn't change his pattern and history will repeat itself Jesus said history will repeat itself he says in the days in the coming of the son of man he was the son of man but he says there'll be another repeat to the Gentiles of the son of man Ministry past Bible times it's still Bible times but past the Book of John because I even talked to somebody the other day it's like when it comes up to the Book of John the revelations that's it I only believe what's in here well there's prophecies in here that go beyond John being on the hour Pappas that God will repeat himself again God will restore in the end time so don't put limitations on God history repeats itself God can repeat himself and we shouldn't put limitations on him so now I've got to get to this if you're looking at this setting in Acts 19 Acts 19 we come through countless Mighty displays of the supernatural God but that didn't make each of them one by seeing the supernatural did not make them priests unto God didn't bring him to the purpose yet they weren't there yet I mean he's gonna he's showed me many miracles he's going to give them a big law with details in it and then the purpose will be is that Moses will fade out and they're going to come into their promised land and they'll step up on their own feet by faith and say I've got a piece of land here I'm going to fight the Devils until I get it it's my land that's the purpose can you say Amen what's my land what's my place in Christ the promised land does not represent heaven when we get there someday as much as it represents our life in the Holy Ghost that's what the problem is so now you just begin your journey when you get the Holy Ghost because now Satan I'm here Satan wake up because I'm awake wake up and smell the coffee Satan I'm here I've recognized my position I got faith I don't care about the Giants I don't care about the big walled cities I don't care I'm not a grasshopper I'm a giant I'm bigger than that giant I found my place and I'm gonna go take my land and Caleb Caleb even was an old man he says I'm old I've been in this thing from the beginning but I'm not going until I take my Mountain I'm getting my Mountain because God gave it to me every person no matter what age if you're 78 years old or 15 years old I'll be saying God hasn't land for me and I'm going to stand up and take it God has a life of the Holy Ghost for me so many young people say oh I'll get that later I want to have one of soul my Wild Oats don't sow any Wild Oats get a hold of Christ now look what you can do for the Kingdom right now take my land right now I'm gonna I'm not going to give the devil 10 years of my life to just wreak havoc in me I'm getting hold of this thing right now right now I'm going to be a David at 14 15 years old I'm gonna stand for things I'm gonna get filled with the spirit I'm an 18 year old girl I'm gonna be filled with the spirit of God and find his purpose for my life and by the way the purpose isn't just finding a husband you know I know a lot of 18 year olds think that's the deal and it is important and it is and God will do that but the first thing you need to say what is God's purpose for my life what can I do for his kingdom right now praise the Lord somebody praise the Lord somebody amen so now it wasn't it wasn't the Miracles that made them priests after this God gives the law so now we got the Miracles now let's talk about this law because this is amazing today to realize after God gives this purpose in four verses there's about 20 chapters packed full of details 613 laws 613 detailed laws details for his people how to live and they they trickled down to really they it was Ten Commandments but then it broke into ten was only it was only 10 of the 613. the first 10 was only 10 of the 630 so it wasn't just 10 but it was the details after the Ten Commandments broke into a total of 613 laws covered covering everything that the people would know how to live that the people would know how to be covered that the people would know how to be protected uh and from uh from it I tell you friends I don't have time to understand it was so detailed from what day to work on what day not to work on to sexual perversion to pornography well I don't remember him mentioning pornography in the Ten Commandments yeah two of them address pornography must have been pretty important that he addressed the lust of women in pornography you think the Ten Commandments are not relevant today he dedicated two of them to this don't covet your neighbor's wife which is some other woman besides your own wife and don't commit adultery it covers everything to the protection of genders to keep the genders the same and to keep them dressing different so that we would know which one is which the law covered it it and how did God know that they were going to be tested and all these how do because God knows everything and he loved the people enough to put his laws out there to say you're going to be tested they're going to question your gender they're going to question who you are and so I want you to be distinctly male and female like I made you and I want you to dress different like I made you it's going to address what day to work on it's going to address the Fabrics it's going to address that a woman that that uh that even kids that are disobedient to their parents could possibly be stoned you see now now we get into some sticky areas it's like uh I don't know about a God Like That Stone a woman that's found in adultery to stoner it gets quiet it's the same God you worship tonight that wrote those laws hello the same God you lifted your hands to is the same God that wrote all those laws 613 laws did anybody feel overwhelmed it's like oh boy that's a lot yeah it is a lot and if you're looking at it wrong you're going to say that's a lot brother Paul 16 no the the ten you know the 10 was one thing and I can just barely squeeze out those now we're talking 613 laws uh I feel like what James said and look at the pressure James said in James chapter 2 verse 8 he said if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scriptures the Royal law this comes from the Old Testament thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself he do well but if you have respect or persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he's guilty of the whole thing great I got 613 laws here to deal with and James says reminding me that I could do the whole thing and fail in one it's as if I failed in all of them that's exactly right because God wants you to fail in yourself but why do you give so many things there's two ways they go look at it one God sure makes things impossible he hates me I know he hates me 613 God sure makes things totally impossible for anybody to do right you can look at it that way it's like one kid said years ago back of the old church years ago over there on Brown Street looked at me and said every time I turn around here there's another rule that you make up brother Paul you're just making them up as you go along rebellious young teenager still not serving the lord today because if you take that mentality towards the word of God and towards instruction into boundaries there's no end to that can you say Amen you will always view God is that he hates me because he's just coming up with more rules all the time every time I turn around here there's another rule he's coming back though I believe it you can look at it that way or you could look at it like this that God cares and knows about every detail of my life you can look at it that way that God cares and that he would give his people details about every little area of her life that should tell us he knows about every area of our life he knows what will be tempted in before and no temptation is come to man that's been common to man that with every Temptation he will make a way of Escape because he knows what it is in other words he knows what you're going to experience so God puts his word out there ahead of time so that you and you discovered it I didn't know this was going to happen I don't know I didn't know this was going to happen well God knew it was going to happen and he put it in his word and he loved you and gave every detail to warn you so it's all in how you look at it can you say Amen now man tries to remove it all uh they try to remove all these Commandments even some denominational systems we're not going to go with the law anymore the old testament's no good and brother Stephen's Drew had a wonderful message that you can't dump out New Testament or Old Testament because they they hold everything together they're a revelation to Jesus Christ the whole thing can you say Amen but there is a lot of systems and people that dump out say I just want the Jesus of Grace that starts in gen it starts in Matthew and I want the Jesus of Grace and they dump out the the Old Testament they dump out the law they try to they try to remove even the Ten Commandments today you know it's like there was a uh there was a sign on the church that says special this week observe any eight of the Ten Commandments many denominational systems have ditched all the Old Testament it's only Grace now Jesus why do they do this here's the reason why you say well they just want to live the some just want to live there but why do they want it because it's so confusing and it's too overwhelming to live on their own it's too much and and you know what the biggest reasons they don't see the mystery and purpose of God and that's what I said at the beginning of this message not seeing God's final purpose in all of it will cause you to be confused about why he said it you must catch the mystery of God the purpose of God can you say Amen that's why I said well I read last Wednesday night why do you hunger why do you thirst church it's the father trying to get this hidden secret to you it's everything it's everything but you'll let so many things get out you let your job you let precious cares of life but their father's trying to get something to you because once you catch that once that happens game over for the devil I said game over for the devil game over for him using depression listen how far do we want to go with the world today they released it 17 percent of Americans now are being treated for clinical depression 70 it's real it's just bursted even since covet so now I'm not here to to put that down I'm just saying that we have to have something greater and deeper because we want to continue to be a part of that statistic that's the way the world goes that's the way that's the only Direction because there's no hope but we have a hope in Jesus Christ we have an anchor in Jesus Christ we have a balm in Gilead can you say amen I don't want to be a part of that and sometimes I've had depression and been apart but I'm not a part of a statistic that keeps growing that's a pretty big number 17 of Americans and it continues to grow I don't want to be a part of that I want to find my balm in Gilead I want to take my depression to the Lord praise the Lord so why do they do this they don't see the mystery of God the purpose of God the mystery of Christ if they did if if they've seen the mystery of Christ and that's why it's so important to all of its friends if they've seen the mystery of Christ they'd never eliminate the word of God look at what Jesus said you say well we'll get rid of the Old Testament we'll just destroy it no no Jesus said I come not to destroy the law so why are you destroying it when Jesus said you don't destroy it I don't come to destroy the law it all has significance and meaning and types I came to fulfill it see the power of the mystery of Christ coming to your life and you connecting with it comes into a different level than just living do's and don'ts it's a different level than just the law and God is the god of laws and if I can just abide by the laws and do my best hopefully I'll make it and Jesus said I didn't come to destroy them but I came to fulfill it I'm bringing the power of the Holy Ghost to fulfill this in you that you become a kingdom a priest so I got a little part here that I probably will end on here tonight we'll pick this up again but I just thought if you feel overwhelmed by 613 laws all right because we're to live this you know we're to live this and uh I just thought I would help you a little bit tonight because we know that we narrow it down from 613 to 10 Commandments first 10 are part of the 613 so we can narrow it down to 10. then Jesus himself says in Matthew 22 35 Matthew 22 35 I'm assuming this is my water from Sunday and then nobody else drank out of it like the church cleaners or somebody Look what Jesus said in about the laws Matthew 22 35 then one of them which was a lawyer oh boy red flags up already one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him so a lawyer is going to ask Jesus A Question Master which is the great commandment in the law so you got 613 Narrows down to 10. and he's tempting Jesus saying which is the greatest of all the Commandments the Commandment of the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this the this is the first and great commandment and by the way that's not technically in the tin that's just something else God said but he's pulling the mystery out of it saying there's a mystery that if you love if you love the Lord God like I said from the beginning when even when he started when the people coming out of Egypt love the Lord thy God with all your heart soul mind and strength he's making that a Commandment that it's actually he's going to draw out too now neither of them are in the ten commandments so I'm just trying to make you feel better if you're feeling the pressure of 613 Jesus himself here says now I'm going to bring it down to two aren't you just feeling relieved already I was sweating there here's here it is thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so Jesus took it all and he nariled it down to two and guess what he's he's definitely got he's definitely bringing the mystery because if somebody by the Holy Ghost lived these two out you're going to live the rest of it as well if you have the reality of loving God that way with all your heart so mind and strength I'm sold out Lock Stock and Barrel I'm filled with the spirit of God and I'm loving with the Divine love of my neighbor no matter what he does to me all the other Commandments how could you commit adultery on your wife if you love God that way [Music] there's no way you could do it how could you kill somebody How Can you steal from somebody you're not going to do any of that because why you you love your neighbor as yourself [Applause] so we come from 6 13 down to 10 and down to two now guess what it gets better if you're still nervous on these two Commandments he says hang all of the law and the prophets on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets I love that I love it I love it because see if you only read the Old Testament and went from Exodus 19 and read the next 20 chapters of the details of the law you're going to be saying you should be saying there's a reason God says this I want to catch the meaning and the type and all that but if you don't look at that what you're going to be saying I will never be able to do all this this is confusing to me this gets muddy God why are you asking us to do all this but you got to have the mystery the purpose now Christ starts to break the fulfilling of the law he says love him with all your heart soul mind and strength and he says on all these two Commandments hang all of the law on the prophets I love that I love that but when Paul goes to sharing and Paul if you're visiting online tonight or on the broadcast you're watching later on or your visitor here tonight Paul is the first one in the Bible can I have about 10 more minutes thank you that was enough for me Paul was the first one in the Bible who uses the term the mystery of Christ okay we know who Christ was in the four gospels he came and lived 33 years he did Miracles and he said what he said and we know that the four gospels there's some denominations they don't want the Old Testament and some of them don't even want the New Testament they just want the four gospels that's all they want and sometimes only the red letters because that's what Jesus spoke they said no there's a lot more that Jesus spoke in the Bible than the red letters but Paul begins to break this thing called the mystery of Christ so it's not just that you know Jesus that walked on the shores of Galilee 2000 years ago that's not enough there's a mystery that's in Christ there's something hidden kind of like there was a mystery in Adam before Eve was brought out of Adam Eve was the mystery within Adam that nobody could see and just like Christ there was a mystery in Christ that nobody could see Paul's going to break something deeper than just talking as a matter of fact Paul was not even there like the rest of the disciples that's why they kind of didn't like him and we're hesitant of them because we're the twelve that was with them we fished with them we ate with them we we fed the five thousand with them we've seen him we were chosen by him Paul he never seen Jesus physically but he's seen Jesus in a pillar of Fire in a light that come over him so there's nobody can say he didn't see Jesus he just seen Jesus in another form they said where has it in him he hasn't and so but here's the way the prophet said it he said Paul had something that the disciples didn't even have yes he was going to be given to preach the mystery of Christ not just Christ of the 33 and a half years there's something deeper and then John on the alpapness he writes the revelation of Christ which is somebody corrected me a few weeks ago I said the revelations of Christ it's not called the revelations of Christ it's called the revelation of Christ so it's all one Revelation it's one revealing of Christ even all the symbols and Revelations is to reveal one person Christ but uh and thank you for that correction whoever did that that's exactly right but Paul's Paul John on our promise he calls it not Jesus Christ I'm not going to talk John was with Jesus he could have talked about those days with Jesus but he's going to preach he's going to bring the by Vision the revelation of Christ the Revelation so you have the mystery of Christ you have the revelation of Christ and that's what you start to get into in the New Testament as Paul starts to break this and most the Jews rejected it said no this is it we've so the Christian the Christian Jews who came to Christ knew him only by the Flesh and knew his what he did and went to Calgary which is all fine but Paul's going to break something even deeper than that what came out of Calvary what came out of the Resurrection what's the power that came out of that what's what's it bringing us to can you say Amen what's the purpose of God what's the purpose of calvary and so here he begins introduces and while he's bringing that mystery of Christ to help us all see what how many laws we have to live he introduces one law and that's the law of the spirit of life the law of the spirit of life that the answer is being filled with the Holy Ghost and living this thing by one law That's the Law of the spirit and what Jesus said was right I'm not knocking it that we love the Lord with all heart soul mind and strength but you see a person can try to do that without the law of the spirit the Holy Ghost in him he could be a passionate I'm going to do this thing I'm going to love God with my heart out I'm going to become a missionary and I'm going to give my life to missionary work and just do it passionately and and God will have rewards for that I'm not going to knock a guy like that but listen now you could do all that and you can love your neighbor as yourself without the spirit of life and so now he's narrowing it down there's a law of the spirit of life he narrows it down to one and once we have that mystery of Christ Living in US it comes down to living that from the depths of our soul and when we're living from that law of Life all of the expression of everything that he wanted to express as a kingdom of priests comes out of that law of life that's living in you the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you can you say Amen you have crossed into the secret of living it's kind of like the priests are given clearance and acceptance in the inner Veil you've crossed into that secret by the Holy Ghost into the secret of living into that Kingdom you are invited on the inside track into the inner Veil Galatians 5 14 says for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but Romans 8 2 says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus that's the other law he's talking about the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death what a law that's the law that I want to live by that's the law that I want living in me because it's so powerful he says it makes us free from the law of sin and death you realize that all the laws had to be created because of our sin do you realize that every one of the Ten Commandments is in a direct answer from God to the sin that was living already within us that because of sin we have the potential to commit adultery because of sin we have the potential to see oh I would never do that well it's in you to do it the serpent nature you're born with there's a law working in you to sin even if you are encouraged to do it you're going to eventually do it and every 10 of the all every one of the laws but if you take the Ten Commandments every one of us to address something that's going to come out of us and to keep it in check not coming into the rest of the Sabbath we're going to violate that we're going to run away from it all of them are to address something of Sinners but this law says this law says the law of the spirit of Life hath made me free from the law of sin and death oh Lord let me live by this law let me let this law live in me can you say Amen only the priest can come in the Intervale the secret place only the priest can be given access to the mystery of God by the holy ghost ever and and to come out and listen a priest with access to the mystery of God by the Holy Ghost will never come out hating the law of God you can never come out of that presence of the Lord and that experience and have the spirit of the law of life you can never come out of hating the word or hating God can someone who has the chance to know the author of a book personally ever hate the book that they wrote not likely they get to live with them they like to be with them they get to know his nature and then when they go to the re read the book they understand why he wrote it that way because they've been around him for months or years most of the time they'll never turn against that author because why they're not going to just read a book and not understand they personally have been given access to the author of the book you can never have a priest of God with the Holy Ghost in that inner secret place with Christ in relationship with him come out of that it'll never happen that they'll hate God or hate this word that's why he says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is saying Amen to every word of God you'll never have the Holy Ghost resisting it it's like oh I'm doing that no not the Holy Ghost because that's the author that wrote it it'll always respond with a amen God completes his purpose for this brother's life and when that purpose is complete in his life and he catches that mystery he can never come out of it playing the victim anymore no he'll say what was meant for evil God meant for good he can never come out of an abuse victim the rest of his life of victim mentality said I've been abused my whole life I'm continually being abused not when you come into this mystery there's no way he's going to say like Joseph what was meant for evil for my brothers was intender for good God's good good purpose was meant for that in that secret place God shows you all things work together to the good can you say Amen to those who this is the only result that comes out of catching the mystery of God all things work together for the good to them that love God and that are called according to his purpose he's caught the purpose he's got the mystery you can never get an abuse victim that continues I'm continuing no it's over it's done it's finished because they've seen their place in Christ called us to his purpose not just a miracle not just the law and Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ something secret something in there that he's wanting to speak to you and we get to the end time where he says time no longer no more delay I'm going to reveal it to you you can never have and we'll go on with this a little bit when I get another Wednesday night of what this Kingdom of priest is but I'm so stirred in my heart to realize that's the purpose is to get us that a people that we have access to God and that we are the mediator between human 's and God there's you know when you have a lawyer that's a mediator it's parties that are disagreeing and at audits with one another so you call a mediator and you mediate so it doesn't have to go to court he sits with you and said let's let's try to come up with something so this goes back to the word priest because you have access to to the presence of God you have access to him you bring the word out of there and now someone who's in hatred towards God someone who resents God say no no you're seeing it wrong and I'm going to try to bring reconciliation and bring them back to God because how how more perfect you've been on both sides you've been in the world you've been bitter you may be been abused but that's not all you are you've been in the presence of God you're you're a high priest unto God you're a priest unto God and so now when you go back and forth you've got something to say like me laying hands on that that lady the other day and praying and God stepping in like that way he did I just I just want this working in my life friends I want this third pole working in my life Simplicity can you say Amen I'm going to close with so much more to say we'll pick it up again but God's called us as purposes to call us not to see another miracle not to push for that not even to live by a law if you're living this message by law if this message is a law to you you haven't caught the mystery of Christ yet and you can never leave it you can never leave it if you've caught the mystery of Christ within it this message is a revealing of Jesus Christ can you say Amen and I'm I want to be an influence of one of those guys I walked into Costco the other day and there was a young boy that was a little boy in my church and I've been talking to him there in Costco me and my wife and I don't think he's serving the lord and all that but um I was just trying to get in uh and I didn't have my card and so the manager his manager he's a manager his manager stopped me said well who's this and he said hey you can let him in he said this was my pastor when I was a little boy said you got in he says this is a man of God you can let him in now he hasn't been to church he hasn't been around but he has respect and guess what I'm glad that he has that impression that this was a man whatever happened and I know the family but that's I'm not talking about that something is still in that boy's heart to have enough respect to say this is a man of God praise the Lord that's what we want to leave them accepting or whatever they do that's between them and God that's not up to me but I want to leave an impression in this world don't you want to leave an impression in this world I'm not just another statistic I'm a priest of God I have access to God when I pray for you I believe something's going to happen not because of me because I got the Holy Ghost when I pray for you when I pray for your cancer we're going to bring that to the church I'm going to pray for you right now I'm going to lay hands on you right now I know you're in a divorce case another day but listen I'm going to believe something good is going to happen God's going to turn things around because why we have access to our Lord we have access to his presence let's stop letting the devil belittle us into something that we're not some false today let's stand who we are in Jesus Christ God give me that mystery of who I am a kingdom of priests Who I Am Lord who I am let's stand and sing it I don't think we've done that course for a long time I can see now who I am a part of his mystery a part of his mystery see it's not just you see the mystery you are part of his mystery praise the Lord Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now who I am praise the Lord has it been good to be in the house of the Lord tonight I've had a good time in the Lord and you just pray now say God plant this word in My Heart Lord mold me into what I need to be let me see who I am in Jesus Christ the word of God Who I Am Lord who I am [Music] I can see now who I am oh a part of my sin part of his word [Music] uh verse one raised at about two keys oh glorious Victory a little faster he set me free and he made my heart sing it now his merry throw my life is no longer mine I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live to praise His name [Applause] Lord who I am [Music] I can see now who I am oh I'm a part of my savior I'm a part of his word amen of who I one more verse tonight before we go on Calvary to God to redeem his loss right the king of kings became my savior this is God's great mystery of Love expressed to me that Christ stand out might be made why amen or who I am [Applause] [Music] amen will I can see now just who I am [Music] all of my savior I'm a part of his word it's a revelation of Who I Am Lord show your people father our identity in the word of God I can't see now who I who I am well I'm a part of my savior well I'm a part of this word yes it's a revelation it's predestination it's predestination of who I [Music] amen hallelujah thank you Lord for showing us Lord holding up that mystery and then bursting it forth in time he's done so many wonderful things that's why are you glad tonight that I nariled it down to just one law it's the spirit of life it's the Holy Ghost that's why you go to camps and different things and if the right atmosphere is created you know what the emphasis is for the young people receive the holy ghost in your life receive it's it's everything can you say Amen we can be taught we can train and we believe in that here we do teaching and training but listen you need the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it can't be a groups can't be your parents you got to know him personally if you don't have that say Lord show yourself to me that I can have a personal relationship when that happens all hell can break loose even parents can leave someday but it won't come nigh to you because you're anchored and living by one law That's the Law of the spirit of life amen we'll close in prayer God bless you if you need prayer for any need I believe God meets many needs while the word is being preached God answers many questions while the word is being preached but if you have a need tonight you want to bring before the Lord you just come forward and God
