So, but I trust him that he that started the work will finish it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we are closer to that than the beginning tonight. Thank you. Uh it's a pleasure to to be here tonight. It's always a pleasure to be at church. &gt;&gt; You know, it's an honor to always uh reverence the name of Jesus, to worship him, and to praise him. And tonight is it is really uh my heart rejoices when I go to church. I don't know about you guys, but I think you are because you're here. I mean, what else is a day better to do than come to church? &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, this is the best place to be on Wednesdays. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or on Sundays. Amen. It's a pleasure to be here tonight. Like I said, it's an honor and I don't need introductions. This is my home away from home. So, they told me if you decide to run away from Tucson, you can come over here. My daughters is ready. They've been ready for me to run away, but I haven't. So, it is always a I rejoice coming this way and having fellowship with one another. So, I don't want to take too much time. Let us uh let us pray. Father, surely indeed it's a pleasure to be here tonight and our heart rejoices, Father, as we come together in one mind, in one accord to just praise you and worship you for who you are and what you are, Father, for the things that you have done for us. Father, you your goodness, your loving kindness, your care, your protection. Father, uh uh your blessings. Father, I don't know what we can do, what would we do without you, Father, because tonight I need you, Lord. We need you. And we want you to speak to our hearts tonight, Father. You know what we each one of us have need, Father. And I know you have a portion prepared for each one of us tonight. So we want to father sit at your feet tonight. Come by the throne of grace and not with fear but with confidence that you are going to supply whatever we have need tonight. Father teach us father your word. Father and we will surrender to you. Father bless the church. Bless the pastor. Father the deacons and trustees. It's so this call even down to those actually in the church. Father at work for one another. Father, we ask you a special blessing. &gt;&gt; Father, we ask you tonight that you can make yourself more real to us tonight &gt;&gt; than before. Father, because that is what we want. We want to serve you. We want to love you. And that is how hard this are tonight that you come and take your rightful place in our heart and throw yourself there father that is your rightful place. &gt;&gt; So we give it to you in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Before we sit there let's read uh Matthew 8 chapter 8 verse 5-10. Try to hide this toolbar. Come on. Hide. Okay. So, are you there now? Amen. Oh, yeah. You You got it. And when Jesus was entered into Capernium, there came unto him a centurion bish him and saying, Lord, my servant lies some sick of the policy grievously tormented. And Jesus said unto him, I will come and I heal him. Wow. No hesitations, huh? &gt;&gt; We should respondse that way when people come to us and said, I want you to pray for my family. I want you. He said sure come. So he says for I am a man under authority. I'm sorry. The centurion answer and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof. So what did he ask him? He said you know if he feels that way sometime but that is a man humbling himself because he knew the Jewish customs. So he said, "For I am under uh under my roof, but speak the word only." And that's what we want tonight. We want the word. &gt;&gt; That's why we come &gt;&gt; because the word is is our life. &gt;&gt; It is more than life to us. &gt;&gt; Says, "And my servant shall be healed, for I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this man, "Go." And he goes, "And another one, come." And he comes, and my servant, and to my servant, "Do this." And he do it. When Jesus heard heard it, he marvel and said to them that follow, "Burely, I said unto you, I have not found so great faith, not not in Israel." So I'm not going to speak about faith. I'm glad that brother, your pastor, took care of that, you know, Sunday. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just piggy back on his sermon. And I didn't know that until, you know, I have my sermon already ready by Saturday, last Saturday. So, uh, this house God work, God synchronizes thing. &gt;&gt; It's not man's, but God can, Holy Spirit can work in this church same way he can work in our church. and we'll synchronize. He synchronized everything that we have need. So I'm glad that a sermon that we heard about faith is needed tonight as well. So you can be seated. Thank you. I want to concentrate on the subtopic maybe authority. Have authority. The centriion says, "I know about authority. I have it." See, he was in a position of responsibility, a position that was given to him and he had authority. They gave him authority to do that kind of a job. See, just like brother Brandon said about the policeman, he has no he cannot stop the traffic. He has no power to do anything, but he has authority of the city to put him in that position &gt;&gt; and he knows that. So he don't doubt it. &gt;&gt; When he stopped somebody, they better stop. &gt;&gt; So speaking the word, he says, "Speak the word only." So in Luke 4:36, we're going to do like a Bible study. I like Wednesday because Wednesday is uh more &gt;&gt; small and cozy and &gt;&gt; we don't have to hear me screaming and yelling. So I promise I will not preach. Let's have a Bible study and well I promise that but I want to be able to. Okay. And they were amazed in Luke 4:36. Jesus he was speaking again among themselves saying what a word is this. See I guess you and I will know what's the difference between the word of God and the word that is not God. Because the word of God will be always vindicated. &gt;&gt; My word will not be vindicated, but his word will never fail. And whatever it goes out to to do, it will do. It will not come back in vain. &gt;&gt; See, and that's the difference between my word of a man and his word. &gt;&gt; He cannot fail. It cannot lie. &gt;&gt; It says, "What word is this? For we with authority and power he commanded the unclean spirits and they come out &gt;&gt; power and and and authority. &gt;&gt; So in Luke 9:1 says then he called his 12 disciples together and gave them power and authority. So he didn't stay with Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want you to pay attention. See, he said he gave power and authority over the devil and all the diseases to cure. &gt;&gt; And I looked about authority. Authority. The word is exosia I think is a pronounce it right. To delegate power. So Jesus had delegated power. Rights and all the rights that come with that power. &gt;&gt; Yes. and all the privilege to exercise divine power. power in the Greek is damus dunamis and that is the word that come if I I'm not pronouncing it right in Greek but that is a word that the word dynamite come from &gt;&gt; because dynamite has power &gt;&gt; believe me don't try it at home it has power &gt;&gt; don't try to prove it so the ability to carry out what the authority permits So not only in authority but that word goes out in power. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Empower. So you know sometimes you graduate from college you know and they give you diploma. What the diploma says with all the authorities and privilege and responsibility we bestow and blah blah blah. So you have invested &gt;&gt; you know to go and delegate you to have this power and go and do &gt;&gt; what they have taught you to do &gt;&gt; or what you study the same thing you know we we progress. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are here and we come to church and we and we mature you know until we come to the perfection the maturity. So as we progress you get more power. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can delegated more power and when you graduate one of these days, well, you will have full power because that's where we want to go. And the full power is the spoken word. &gt;&gt; But we start slowly just like going to school training. Church is a training place. &gt;&gt; But the last the the the goal is so you come to perfect maturity. So you will be bested you know and have the authority and the power &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; to speak the word of God. &gt;&gt; I mean if not that then how can we carry out what Jesus says &gt;&gt; you will do the same work greater work unless we are vested &gt;&gt; and have the authority and the responsibilities that's come with it too. So in John 14:12, verily, verily I said unto you, that he that believe on me, &gt;&gt; the works that I do shall he do also, &gt;&gt; and greater work than this shall he do because I go to the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he didn't left it with the with the uh disciples. See, &gt;&gt; now it comes forward is on us as well. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we believe says Matthew 21:21 says, "Jesus answered and said unto them, verily I said unto you, if you have faith and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say unto this mountain be removed, and be thou cast in the city, it shall be done." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So what I'm saying is the power has come down to the disciple but instead in the day of Pentecost that power is available today to us as well because while we believe &gt;&gt; however here in Proverbs 8:21 says death and life are on the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; Wow dynamite. &gt;&gt; That's right. uh and they that love shall eat the fruit therefore. So we know that brother Brown told us power without character is what? &gt;&gt; Evil wicked. So the responsibility is that at the same time that you are being given power you have to have character that goes along with the power. &gt;&gt; Without power we cannot handle &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's &gt;&gt; true. So there's a responsibility that goes with this. So the whole journey is to learn is to have the character of God. We are shaped and formed to his character. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; For the only reason that we can handle his word. &gt;&gt; Without his character, we cannot handle. We make a mess &gt;&gt; is what it is. So Matthew 21:22 says, "And all things whosoever you you ask in prayer, see believe &gt;&gt; and you believe you shall receive." So I want to bring this one because not only when when we appreciate or when we are you know pray for somebody else but if for also when you pray pray could be could be a vocal voice or sometime we put request unspoken request it doesn't matter spoken voice the thing is that prayer falls in the same category &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to pray for Lazarus when he went to the tomb uh he didn't make a lengthy prayer. Actually, he didn't even kneel or put his hands together. He stood there like he was talking to to God. He was I mean that's what prayer is all about. &gt;&gt; So don't put aside prayer because prayer has the same power. &gt;&gt; I mean it had the same results. So he stood there said, "Father, I know you always hear me, &gt;&gt; but for their sake and that was it, &gt;&gt; man." &gt;&gt; So all I'm saying is that you had to handle prayer just with the same uh uh way that you will handle a a prayer to somebody that is sick. Because when you are praying is something that comes out of your heart. show desire something or you have a burden for something. So it works the same way. You have to have uh the same uh what we call power and you should also as uh we begin in the beginning you have to have authority when will you pray. &gt;&gt; So prayer don't take it lightly. &gt;&gt; It requires the same authority and the same power. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, so that and I want to use this later on. It it's going to come out back again. So, Luke 11 and4 says, "And he said unto them, when you pray, see, our father which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in heaven, so as in he." So they as the they as the the the disciple asked Jesus teach us that they seen his prayer being you know come to pass they wanted to have that kind of a &gt;&gt; you know way in fact when he sent them out they tried to pray for somebody that uh a boy or something that have policy or something like that and they pray they pray and Jesus came and you know they said but they your disciple pray but they haven't been able to &gt;&gt; nothing has happen. So, and then Jesus was said some some some spirit will not come out without fasting. Okay? We have to do a little bit more. &gt;&gt; But the point is that that's why the disciples said, "But teach us how to pray cuz we trying to do it and nothing happens." So he says when you pray, this is what you do. You know, first address your father, honor your father, and then later on that will be done. As in heaven, so as in earth. Few things I want to point right quick. The kingdom of God is in you and me. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the kingdom of God is in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So we don't have to be looking too far, &gt;&gt; right? This is not something power that's going to come sh some from the sky &gt;&gt; or something is going to strike you. &gt;&gt; It is right within you sir. &gt;&gt; First thing that Jesus said you don't have to be looking too far is it's right there. &gt;&gt; Second he says and it will be done as in heaven so as in earth. So the next thing he's saying, you know, the will of God in heaven, it has to be voice has to have a voice in earth. &gt;&gt; See, that's what he says. The will that is in heaven is the word of God because the will is God's word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that will that is for her being spoken in heaven, it has to be voiced &gt;&gt; in earth. &gt;&gt; Somebody has to voice it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then we have to first know that the kingdom of God is in us. And also we need to understand that when we speak what has already been spoken &gt;&gt; and revealed through a prophet through the Bible, not something different but speaking his word because his word will never fail us. See, &gt;&gt; God cannot fail. So those two things for right now. So Matthew 6 also I remember and I didn't write it there but Matthew 6 talks about a little bit of more prayer a little more extensively or further more. So, and he started talking about people that pray, you know, the hypocrites. They pray, you know, and sometimes they pray also repetition prayers and sometimes they uh elaborated eloquent prayers, you know, and Matthew said, you know, that's not the way to pray, &gt;&gt; right? You know, so he was kind of a getting in the in in in people that they wanted attention sometime. Oh, look at how he pray how good it is. But see, that's not the way Jesus said tell the disciples said you pray and the kingdom of heaven is in your heart. &gt;&gt; Nobody had to know what you pray for when you pray. The Bible said, "Ask, knock, seek, and it shall be done unto you." Right. &gt;&gt; So that's why sometimes we have to pray so God to lead us. You know when we want to pray for someone we need to pray God I got a burden. &gt;&gt; See because if you try to do pray for somebody just because you are concerned it might get worse. We don't need a I know we concerned. Oh well, if that brother can continue doing that, he's going to go further than he wants to go. I'm I'm just concerned that okay, but that is not a reason to play a concern. It's good to be concerned, but what I'm saying is when you get to be concerned, get down in your knee first and pray and get hold to God and God might not even send you. My God might have somebody else to do that work. That's why we have to be careful not go on with a concern because thing can get worse. So we pray. Now if God wants to send you and he speak to you then you go then when you speak to the brother or when you or the sister and you start praying the sister's going to know that God sent you because you're going to be saying things that only God knows that is in that sister or brother heart. See, anyway, to speak the word with authority and power. See, we're not talking with a scare tactics. So, a lot of people like to do that, but trying to scare us to believe or but if you don't do this, you you're going to die. They we don't use the scare tactics. &gt;&gt; No, but we got power. But it's not to scare anybody, right? So in Luke 11:1 says again the the the prayer, "Our Father, which are in heaven, here I'm going to start getting into my subject, authority." There's three things that you need before you have authority. Well, at least two things. You need to know your place. And second, you need to know your position. &gt;&gt; When you know your place and your position, then authority will come. &gt;&gt; Listen what it says over here. Our Father, which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. As in heaven, so in earth. Now my father, we are in heaven. Where is heaven? Where in heaven? Where? I'm going to put to you that we talking about heaven in places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going with this. And then the kingdom of God like I said is in your heart. Okay? And the will of God is his word. Right? So let us start from there. heavenly places. Now, Ephesians 3 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God of Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in where? In heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Okay. So, our five that are in heaven, where in heaven? In heavenly places. That's the place that I'm going to show you that we got to be. Now, Hebrew 11:6, but now they desire a better country. This is Paul talking about Abraham. A better country. See that is in heavenly and heavenly. See the place not only wasn't any any place in Canaan land. It was a heavenly place. So he's Abraham looking for a city &gt;&gt; in a heavenly place. &gt;&gt; Okay. Where God is not ashamed to be called their gods. See for he had he had we go keep this word in mind. Prepare for them a city. See Abraham was looking for a heavenly resident but not in in the earth. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was looking for a place, a resident in a city that was not, you know, made by mans or flesh. It was by God. &gt;&gt; And you and I, that's why we are in this pilgrimage in this sojouring just like Abraham looking for that place. I'm not looking for resident here. I like to get out of here. That's what I like. But because my resident is not here, it's in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That is our walk. So I want you to keep this in mind. The place that we're talking about is heavenly places, a heavenly resident. And we got here Acts 7 uh five talking about Abraham and he gave him no inheritance. So that mean he never saw never possess it. He says, "But he went looking for it and he never stopped looking for her even though because he couldn't find it, but he knew his face knew and believed that there was a this kind of a city somewhere, not in earth, but in heaven." Now, not so much as he sets foot on this on the land. Yet, he was promised that he would give it to him for possession, but he never possess it. at least not him in the flesh. And did and he se after him when as yet he had no he didn't even had a child yet and now he promised you know a city a heavenly place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we know that's the land that the Jewish possessed, you know, the Exodus, they went to the to the land that God, you know, offered them. That was the rich land. Uh that the Bible says if milk and honey, you know, fluid with milk and honey and everything, the promised land, that was their possession. Now, let me make a little comment here. Just because God give you something, that don't mean that you have to to just sit down and wait for it. &gt;&gt; Because in order for them to possess the land, they have to fight. &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to sit over here and then the the day of the rapture, you don't now come into my going to have to fight until the end &gt;&gt; for the change of a body because Satan is going to be there all the way. &gt;&gt; You and I have to fight. We have any inheritance but we had not possessed it &gt;&gt; just like they did. They had not possessed it yet. Abraham didn't even saw it &gt;&gt; but he fought for it. &gt;&gt; So you and I also God paid for Jesus came and for his blood he paid for that and we have a deed. We have a deed &gt;&gt; and we can claim it but we we don't have no possession of it yet. But we are going to learn the taste. We are going to possess it. &gt;&gt; The same thing with the Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; So I walk to that city. You know, just like Abraham, he says, "For he looked for a city." Hebrew 11:10, "He looked for a city that which has a foundation." See whose builder and maker was God. See, and we know that this foundation, our foundation, the foundation we're talking about here is the rock. See, because it's the rock of revelation. And that's where the foundations always start with a heavy stable, you know, rock. &gt;&gt; And we standing in that rock of revelation. That is our foundation. &gt;&gt; And God is building, building, building. And we are being built in that revelation because we get a revelation from revelation for revelation from glory to glory to glory to glory. Brother Brandon said the thing that we need the most is more revelation. You want to seek something, seek more revelation because that is God word being uh ministered to you and then reflect it &gt;&gt; cuz you know stay just in in the mind goes to the heart. So looking for a city has a foundation. Remember what uh Jesus said you know he will build his church right and in the rock of what revelation his church his body so that is the foundation see and that's revelation and we standing on that rock of revelation Moses stood on that rock amen and we standing on the same rock of revelation ession 2 Peter 2:46 to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowing indeed of men but chosen of God and precious talking about Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ was the rejected stone actually Jesus Christ was the cornerstone &gt;&gt; and he became the capstone &gt;&gt; of the building you know the two most important that this in the house is the foundation &gt;&gt; has to be stable not in sinking sand. &gt;&gt; But the second thing more important is the roof. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the roof is what crystallize, you know, brings everything together. Without a roof, walls can fall. But the roof is what brings it all together, right? &gt;&gt; And that's the same like Jesus. He's the foundation and he's also the capstone that keeps the body stable solid in one piece. &gt;&gt; So this allowing the five says ye also are lively stones. We are lively stones are built all up on the spiritual house. Now I'm going here because Abraham was looking for for a city in the heavenly places, right? Now we talking here that God is building a house. Okay, we live stone a body. You and I, we are live stones. &gt;&gt; I should change my last name to to living stone. You know, Eli living stone. Look, I am a lively stone. Anyway, I built up a an spiritual house. So the same way it is a earthly house, this is an earthly house. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I do have an spiritual house. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew that and he was looking for that house &gt;&gt; because this bad this is not going to make it. This is condemned. This is going to be dissolved. But it doesn't matter when I leave this house, I got another &gt;&gt; house. But that is a spiritual house. &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham was looking for. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh okay. So he says are built upon a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God in Jesus Christ. Therefore also it is contained in the scriptures. Behold I lay in Zion. You all know you know that Zion is the bride. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Did you know that? Amen. Agree disagree. And you know where siren is at right in Jerusalem at there the middle east the chief corner stone elect precious and he that believe in him shall not be confounded. &gt;&gt; I lay in Zion a cornerstone &gt;&gt; and we know who is the cornerstone already been laid &gt;&gt; and people trample and you know over that you know elect and precious. Now James 14:2 says now he as we're trying to you know shape this this this this subject in my father house are many mansions if we were not I would have not told you I go to prepare remember I told you remember the word what he told Abraham I'm going to prepare the same word a city a place a heavenly places. Now this is the same word prepare. He says I will leave you but I'm going to go and prepare a place. He told it for you. Okay. Now keep all this together. He says as we're not so I will not tell you. I'm going to prepare a place for you. So we're talking about the place, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You need to be in that place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're not only speaking the word from earthly speaking. This is your house. But you have another house. &gt;&gt; But when we speak, we speak words that come already spoken in heaven &gt;&gt; through you. Right? I want to show you that there's more than one you. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, you went bananas now. &gt;&gt; Tell me something. Do you have a representation in heaven? We bypass the theophony. Do you have a representation in heaven that look just like you? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I I'm getting ahead of my my knee. But brother B says when the since we're open, okay, and you heard a voice and you believe, he says, you heard from where? You heard from your &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. No, you heard from where? &gt;&gt; What? That's you in a spirit form. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now there's two of you, &gt;&gt; a flesh one &gt;&gt; and a spiritual one. &gt;&gt; So when we speak from heaven, we speak what? The spiritual one &gt;&gt; because that's the word that was a part of God. In fact, that was a uh a gene of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We were in his mind. &gt;&gt; Words spoken. &gt;&gt; That is the theophony. a celestial body that God now here you go that he went to prepare for you. So where he's at you will be. &gt;&gt; Now remember he says he says I'm going to prepare you a place so you will be where I am. And we are in Christ Jesus in where? In heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem is some people believe that this is when the rapture happened. and that's where I'm going to go. No, that is already in place waiting for you and me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep that in mind. A minute now. In my house is many mansion. So people trying to put this in the future, but this is happening right now. I heard from my theophony. You think that was just for that purpose only to bring me in? I'm still hearing from my theophony. I think we we we have come to well let me continue. So that is the place that you have a representation even you you are in earth. Let's continue now position that's a place and the position in 1 Corinthians 15:40 they are also celestial bodies and they're also what terrestrial bodies but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrest of the terrestrial the human body the f the weak body is another see it's is a human being, you know, like me, but we have a celestial body someplace else, too. I don't know, brother. I'm trying to figure out where you're going with this. Just just listen to me. Let me get done with this. So, so we have a representation. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we have a celestial body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. And that is in is in a position already in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Okay. Now I know this is different from what you have heard but that's me different and me lie. Okay. Philippians 3:21 who shall change our bow bodies. This is talking about this bound body that that is may be fashioned like onto a glorious body. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; This body will be changed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To a glorious body. &gt;&gt; Yes. But what I'm telling you that body is already there at least the spiritual body the the the the the celestial body has an interest in that part that is here &gt;&gt; because remember when the rapture happens some are going to come to look for bodies because they cannot function they they are together Adam when God created Adam from the dirt you know and then he took the the spirit spirit that he created and put it in that body. Now he became one, right? He became like God, a small messiah, &gt;&gt; right? In earth, but he was a combination of the spiritual that God created first into a house that was a terrestrial house. Okay? So keep that in mind as we go. according to the working whereby is able to even subdue all things unto himself. Galatians 5:16 says this I said then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Okay. Talking about we need to agree with what has been said in heaven already. See we need to agree with the word. Okay. And you are a gene of God. You are a word expressed. But your theophony, we bypass our theophony. &gt;&gt; So where is your theophony sitting at right now? In heavenly places. &gt;&gt; I'm going to prepare your place. And this is the other part of the that theophony bypass. Now Christ did not bypass his theophony. &gt;&gt; Yes. He God created a body and put that spirit in him. See Matthew 18:19. I guess you kind of quiet on that one. Jesus Christ did not bypasses the offony. He came in the body. That's why he came not sexually. He came what? God created the cell, the sperm and the blood and put on the on the egg and put it into a body. See, &gt;&gt; he didn't came like you and me. &gt;&gt; Again, I said unto you, Matthew 18:19, I said unto you that if two of you shall agree in earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall done for it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; So we had to agree with the word. Yes, &gt;&gt; you need two. If two of you can agree today on the Russia, it will happen. Brother says that. So, but to agree the other half to agree with that the other half that is in celestial places in Christ Jesus, we know that the rapture nobody knows the time and the day. So to agree on the rapture today, it's not going to happen. But brother B just was making a a statement saying if two can agree if you can agree with the word of God that been spoken in heaven. Okay. John 17 I don't want to confuse you. It get clear at the end. These words spoke Jesus and lift up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come. Glorify thy son. Thy son also may glorify thee. And the glorify and the glory which how gave me I have gave I given them that they may be one even as we are one. Father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am. &gt;&gt; So where he at? &gt;&gt; He said I will go to prepare a place for you. So you will be where I am. So where he's at? &gt;&gt; Don't put him too far. See &gt;&gt; right? when you pray where he's at is in heavenly places and we are in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want you to to be aware what's the thing is here when when when we decide to move forward. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know with the word of God there had to be certain agreement. &gt;&gt; Okay. It says and gives me says father will I also whom they have given me whatever I am that they may be behold my glory which thou has given me for thou love me before the foundation of the world. So he said the same glory that I have with you before the foundation of the world. You know you and I we had the same glory before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; because we were created you know celestial bodies first spirit body see Adam if you wouldn't fall we would have came just like Jesus but because the fall causes the separation that we come a different way see the way we should have came was a spoken word you know I winner said, "Honey, see because she was the helmmaid. Honey, uh, we need to bring the next one." The next one, I guess it should be, uh, either not Kane. Kane wouldn't come out on that way, but Abel would have come out. We need to bring the next one and the next one and the next one. So, the job of of uh, it was to agree when two can agree takes two. So Adam said, "Let's be the next one." And she says, "I agree." &gt;&gt; And it happens, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the same thing with the church in Christ. He's our husband. &gt;&gt; And the husband says in heaven, the word of God, he's the word. &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing that you got to do is agree with our husband. And when two can agree, &gt;&gt; it happens. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; So sometime we talk we think it's just two of us and it's good we me and brother can agree but when you can agree with the word that been spoken &gt;&gt; the husband is your word &gt;&gt; it says and if you can believe you can have what you have said. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; So as we go it gets a little bit more clear. says, "So now we know the place heavenly places. We know the position and the position that I was talking about here is that let me see if I missed my uh scripture in 1 Corinthians 15:40." Would you go kind of back because I kind of got ahead of myself. It says they are also celestial bodies and body terrestrial and by the glory. I read this one. So yes. Okay. So what Paul was talking about is again we got bodies but we also got celestial bodies. However they uh position I don't know where the scripture went. Let me see. Okay. Okay. Just give me a minute. So anyway, let me give it to you this way. So the place and the position. Now there are various different kind of glories according to to the Bible. I was to see if I wrote it or disappear or not. So I don't know what happened but anyway there's there's different kinds of glory according to the Bible and what he's saying is there there's different between you know positions in heaven. Okay? Because you you had to be in your place and your position. Now brother brother brother uh Paul is a pastor. Well he's not just a pastor here. That is his position in heaven because brother Brandon will be a prophet in heaven just like it's here. See those those don't change because from heaven it says he came and gave gift to man. &gt;&gt; So the same position you have here you will hold in heaven. Amen. So therefore when we talking about different uh glory glorious body and different station of glorification it's mean that you have different uh gift and different talents and just because you go to heaven that don't mean you don't play in the piano. Whatever you have been gifted here that will be also carried to the next you know place that we are going to. So, brother Branaman will be you know prophet and he's going to present all of us of this generation mira and all who will be in the side and he's going to present and he's going to say you know I'm going to be judged yes just like just like Paul was judged by no problem because I'm preaching what he's preaching you know all these things so so the thing is that you when we change you know not only The bodies will change but our position still the same. &gt;&gt; Brother will be a prophet. You will be a pastor. You will be a minister of music. You probably belong. You're going to belong to the choir helica choir in heaven. Satan is not going to have that one anymore. But you guys that like to sing. You got your place is all I'm saying. So that mean saying that this is what I'm trying to tell you. Do not coveret somebody else place &gt;&gt; because whatever place you got here that's the place in heaven &gt;&gt; and God hasn't changed that. He gave you a place and he gave you a position to be. So what I'm saying is let me said this kind of uh not criticizing anything but brother Brown says a pastor cannot tell a prophet what to do and evangelist cannot tell a pastor what to do and so go down and a teacher and a minister why because that's how God set it up. Now saying that I like to say this now when an evangelist seek a position of a pastor that won't work. &gt;&gt; I know some people do it and not Christian is not criticizing &gt;&gt; because you crossing you're crossing positions &gt;&gt; that was not your position. I cannot be a pastor and I will not be a pastor. That was not my calling. So I tell brother Dog when I started with him I just said you don't have to worry about me. I don't want your position. In fact I don't want it at all because I know how it is. I've been working with pastors. It it is a hard position and I'm not made condition for that to be that kind of a person. I don't have the heart of a pastor even though I minister the word. I can teach. I can do evangelistic but I could not never take a position. So what I'm saying is when we trying to cover somebody's cell position and I've seen evangelists doing pastoral work, it hasn't worked too good. &gt;&gt; I travel a lot and I know so what I'm saying you have a place and a position here and you will have the same place and position there to to be. God will not change your positions. So when you know your position and you know the place then you can have authority &gt;&gt; because out of your place you cannot have authority. What happened to Satan? They changed what their state. That mean they had a position in heaven &gt;&gt; but they wanted to be he wanted to be like God. He wanted another position &gt;&gt; that cannot work. &gt;&gt; Never work. Yes sir. So the same thing with with uh with certain people that like uh okay but I like to be a deacon. Well, if God called you to be a deacon and you meet the requirements, sure that's why the Bible says you know the gift your gift will seek his place. We seek you seek the place that you belong. Yes. &gt;&gt; And we need to respect and that's one of the thing we need to respect position and the way you respect position is the way God respect position. You know if I say something that you disagree what brother uh Paul is preaching forget about what I just told you just pray for me. Just take what he tells you. &gt;&gt; I cannot teach no higher. Ran says I cannot teach no higher than my pastor. You cannot live no higher than my than your pastor. That's why brother said why? Because that is the gift and you lower than that gift. That mean that he's more special than you. But you cannot go higher than that gift. &gt;&gt; Because if you do and that's the problem we have in our church sometimes that we have I don't know we have for for time now but people think they know more than the pastor. &gt;&gt; So you're trying to seek something. You don't know what they you're doing. See because God had anointed that person had had given that person that office the tool that he needs. See and you might have another gift evangelist but that's different that what God has done with the pastor. So sometimes what happen is people leave because they think they know more than the pastor. God has called that pastor for that office, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's responsible and he has authority, you know, and he's the higher and the pastor is the hard thing in in the church is the pastor. Okay, I know everything is run by the Holy Ghost. I'm not dismissing that part. We all, you know, do that. So anyway, John 17. So talking about different kind of glories. So authority that can come now brother I read this this expression here now you know your place now you know your position this is your uh why says authority so Ephesians 6 says over here put on the whole armor of God and I know brother Paul used this scripture I was wondering if he want to go further but he didn't go too far that was good that you may be able to stand against the bows of the devil. Amen. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual weakness, wickedness in high places, in heavenly places. That is where Satan is squatting right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And now and and then we to he's going to come down and we're going to go up to our rifle place because when Adam fell Satan squatted in his place he's in heavenly places. See so that is what I'm talking about the place heavenly places. He says for us again we preach our wickedness in high places and that's heavenly places. Amen. So here's what I'm trying to you know coming down almost today now what I'm saying is that the reason that we need to know a place and opposition to have the authority to speak the word you know so if we don't know that then it's going to be hard because according to here we are fighting an enemy I've been in wars and it's good to know the enemy and to see the enemy and to defend yourself but you are fighting an enemy that you cannot see, you cannot hear. &gt;&gt; How can you fight that? &gt;&gt; So in your flesh, you cannot fight. &gt;&gt; So where are you going to fight? &gt;&gt; Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because this war is against principalities of the air. But who is in the air? Are you in the air? No. Who is at in the air in heavenly places? &gt;&gt; Because that's where he's at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, your other theophony is there, &gt;&gt; but who is dictating how the fight is going to go? &gt;&gt; Your words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that Jesus could have called 10,000 angels, right? He could have spoke and asked for help, but he didn't. Now, brother man says that you speak, right? And when you speak, you know, then the the heavens, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; will move. But they're waiting for the heavens will not move until you speak. This is the thing about this. &gt;&gt; God will not, you know, or anything will happen until we said the word. &gt;&gt; The word that is already been said in heaven has to be speak in the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's what he's saying over here in heavenly presence in Christ. So the fight that we are fighting you know is difficult because we cannot see the enemy. We cannot defend ourself or something that we cannot see and we cannot hurt something that we cannot see prevented from coming. So we cannot be defenses and we cannot be offensive. You know, like that's what you got in in in in football, defense and the offense. And the defense is to protect you from getting, you know, injured. And to offense, the offense is to go after the enemy to &gt;&gt; But you and I cannot do that in the flesh because we cannot see. &gt;&gt; We cannot see the target. So when we do it in our knees, &gt;&gt; we command from our knees in our place that is heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And from there is where the fight remember when David when uh uh Daniel prayed and it took 21 days for the messenger the angel to come to assist him. And what did he said? I have a little bit of trouble. I had to fight the king of this, the king of that. They would not let him. They wanted to block the blessing &gt;&gt; because the fight was not here. The fight was there. &gt;&gt; And your fight is not in the flesh. That's what the Bible said. This is not a fleshy fight. &gt;&gt; This fight is a spiritual fight. &gt;&gt; It is not your brother. It's not your sister. It's not your wife. It is not. It is not. It is a spirit that you are fighting. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you cannot see that spirit, how you going to fight it? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; In your knees, &gt;&gt; you need to speak &gt;&gt; the word that was spoken and command that and they will move. See, when Jesus went to see the uh the man that was possessed, Dion with a thousand spirit, you know, not until Jesus there and spoke to him and spoke to those spirits so coming, they knew it was trouble. No, but Jesus did not do something radical and beat him and get out. No, the sooner they saw him, they said, &gt;&gt; "What do you got to do with us?" Now, &gt;&gt; see, that's what the five stars &gt;&gt; when you face those spirits in your knee. Let me let me say something here. When something does anything to you, Christian or not Christian at school, at work, anywhere you go, brother says that is not your brother. That is not that person. That is what &gt;&gt; the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this is a spirit that is driving the people. &gt;&gt; It is not the people, the spirit. So therefore, you don't need to fight the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we don't fight flesh. We fight spiritual battle. &gt;&gt; So what you got to do to love that person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To pray for that person &gt;&gt; so that spirit will live. Because this is not a fleshy fight. But you have you must agree with heavenly places, the will of God, the word of God. It says, okay, for we ren against flesh and blood, but against princip. That's why sometimes what brother Paul was talking about uh Sarah, you don't need to get upset if she didn't have the faith yet because that don't come from her, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She cannot make her have faith. &gt;&gt; She don't even understand what's going on. &gt;&gt; So we cannot have we have to be toler tolerate be be patient &gt;&gt; pray. So that wrong start moving around there &gt;&gt; and then it will do the rest &gt;&gt; but that's why we don't engage &gt;&gt; physically &gt;&gt; you know like somebody told me and it's been said it says you don't catch flies with vinegar you want to catch fly you put honey &gt;&gt; so you be sweet you be kind &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter what they had done to you &gt;&gt; because the only way you're going to change that person is from heavenly realms, &gt;&gt; not from fleshy &gt;&gt; real. So Peter says, "Wherefore I was trying to look at the time and this computer never change the time. I still got two sometimes." So I guess I got a lot of time. I got 6:30 over here. 8:30. Okay. I thought I had two hours. Second Peter 1:10 says, "Wherefore, rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if you do so, you shall never fall. Know your place, know your position, &gt;&gt; and you will never fall &gt;&gt; because you're going to be guided from heavenly places." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I believe we have a headquarters. It's called heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That's where all our commands come from. See, I don't believe in flesh headquarters, but I believe in heavenly places. That's our headquarters. &gt;&gt; That's where the Holy Spirit is our connection. I don't know if I get there. I don't to heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Because Jesus said, "I will send you the comfort. He will teach you. He will show you. He will bring you things that he hears and see from heavenly places. &gt;&gt; It's our connection to our heart. I'm not saying that you're going to hear your theophony talking to you. But I said you heard from your theophony. See that day that you decided to give your life to the Lord when you heard this message. &gt;&gt; But it's the Holy Ghost is the connection. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To heavenly places because Jesus when he died in in Calvary and he resurrected, brother B says in in that day Easter, he went up and he punched a hole as it go and made a way to heavenly places have been closed since the beginning of the fall. Nobody could get it. Heaven was shut until Jesus came and made a hole and made a way a door to heavenly places in that Jesus. But at the meantime, the heavens has been shut and Satan have been having a power throughout all the centuries but no more no longer. See, let me finish up. Wherefore the right give allegiance to make your calling and relationships see and now that we're living in this dangerous times you know like uh uh apostasy you know people are just renegade leaving the message you know make sure that that that that we know what we believe and where we stand and we're south place in in in this message in heavenly places. No, it says over here John 1:4, let me go quickly. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the comforter which is in is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said to you. So he is the one. He is our connection to heavenly places. You and I cannot ascend. Yeah. We cannot go up but he can come down. See now one more thing his presence because even though the word is in heaven we can feel his presence. &gt;&gt; Now John 3:13 and no man has ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven. Wow. This is not a uh one of those trying to figure it out. The one that ascended to heaven, he came down from heaven and he is in heaven. Okay, I'm confused now. Well, no man has known the mysteries of the kingdom of God to that to that point. Nobody knew that because nobody has gone there and come back and tell us about it. So nobody knew and nobody knew the place. See, but Jesus said, "I tell you where I'm going and you will be there with me." &gt;&gt; But see, all that happened in this time. So no man has known since then, the place and the position. It's only revealed by the divine will of God in our life through this message. Now John 14 10:11. Believe thou not that I am in the father and defines in me. The word that I speak unto you, I speak not all myself, but the father that dwells in me. He does the work. Okay. So where is the father? You know, did did he see visions like brother Brandon? Did did he heard things? You know, did God send messengers to him to see? says is it's not me doing the work. My father that is in heaven, right? Heavenly Father, he said at the beginning in the prayer that is in heaven, what I see him doing in that realm, you know, it shows me what I need to do and it don't it's no different for us. You want to find the will of God, find out what he already has spoken and his wife is doing in heaven, in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. See believe believe that I am in the father and the father is in me also believe me for my very work. So then the holy ghost is god in us Jesus in us right it's the office of god in us you are not in heavenly places but he is in heavenly places. You cannot contain god just in in you. God is in you. God is in you. You and God is everywhere. You cannot box them in in just one place. you you are restricted, but he's not. &gt;&gt; John 5:19 said, "Then answer Jesus and said unto them, verily verily I said unto you, the son cannot do nothing of himself, but what he sees of the father, for what things soever he does, they also to the sonlike wife." So he saw the father. When did he see the father doing it? Well, he was in contact with the father all the time. The father was in him, the spirit of God leading him and guiding him. First Corinthians 2:9, but it is written, I had not seen nor heard, neither have entered into the haram the things which God has prepared. He he goes the word prepared again. Nobody knew of that place. That place did not existed after the resurrection. you know a place in heaven for them that love him. So we know our place our place is not in this earthmen. &gt;&gt; Our place is in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then later on we come to earth and we have our rightful place but right now our place is in Jesus Christ and what he says up there what he says in heavenly places I speak in this flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it says uh God was manifested and we are his attributes. He manifest himself through us now and the Holy Ghost reveals these things and bring all these things to our life to our understanding. It's no longer a secret. Brother man says after the seven were open he says and I'm I'm finishing. I got one more thing to read. He said that uh Jesus and let's see let's see which way I want to go with this. Well, let me finish this and I go with that in the middle. Now, this is what he says in the mighty conqueror. Let me finish because if not I stay a little longer. Well, I had no more war. Well, and we will have no more wars then when he comes. No more sickness, no more trouble. Notice it says when he uh he had died there so little spoke of his ascension. It is one of the of the greatest days when he ascended up cause all over the earth since the day of the garden of Eden. The sin was committed. All heaven was shut off from mankind. when he when he had no access to God to heavenly places. I'm glad that he stayed that way. He said &gt;&gt; heavens the atmosphere was shut up. So a little bit here heavenly places is not in earth. Heavenly places is in the place a little higher than us in the atmosphere. Now let me tell you when God created Adam, he gave him dominion over the earth and everything else. He was not commanding from the earth at the time. He was a spirit made before he got God gave him a body because there was nobody to till the ground. But in the meantime, he gave him power and dominion over everything. But he was in heavenly places. He was in the spiritual. It was the theophony. He was not the body yet. So in that realm is what I'm talking about that is heavenly places. Adam was commanding everything from that realm when the Bible said that he fell. He didn't fell from the ground. Lord, you cannot go no lower than the floor. But he fell from heavenly places, &gt;&gt; you know, from that realm. He fell down to a Lord &gt;&gt; now because even though after God put him in flesh, he was still commanding from heavenly places, &gt;&gt; right? So I'm not saying that Adam was here and then he had another one that once God took him and put him in a body. Now it was a different story. Now you have the spirit in a body. And that's what going to happen to us one of these days. The rapture will change our body. And then those that are already die and pastor, they will come to get bodies. God will make them a body that they supposed to have to begin with, not this corrupted, the real perfect body. And God will take that spirit and we go into that body. &gt;&gt; And then you become already changed completely with a glorified body that you supposed to have to be with. &gt;&gt; So right now, that's why they're waiting. They're waiting for to to come back and pick up a perfect body. See, God made the body of Adam and he will do the same thing with you in that day. He will make your body. Now, you and I that we still live and remain. We will be changed. This body will drop and you get another body. &gt;&gt; That was the body that he from the very beginning he designed for you to have. That this one, this is Satan designing. So it says he was commanding from heavenly places. See all heaven was shut off from mankind. Satan is the prince of the power of the earth. Now see this is where heavenly places are in a different realm not here. Now this is the place where we battle. They chose to battle and they chose the ground to battle and that was you and me. Satan chose the mind and God chose the the heart. But you are only a ground that they decided to meet. So you had no choice. The only choice you have is to decide who one is going to win. That's all. &gt;&gt; Because they already made the choice. And it's hard to be a battleground because you can do nothing. It's been chosen. I didn't volunteer. You know, I didn't set that day. I was that day I met the off. Oh, I want to go to earth. I want to go through all that and I want to sin and I want to be weak and uh-uh me. I didn't volunteer for that. But the Bible said that God, you know, since uh Paul says in Romans chapter 8, he says that he put us in this in these uh bodies. Satan is the prince of the power. While he was falling from heaven, Lucifer, no man could see into into glory. No man can see into glory. No man could understand because the power was just above. So here again I'm saying you cannot fight in the flesh realm &gt;&gt; but you can fight above because you have a representation above. &gt;&gt; See that's why I say it's not fleshify. That's what we fight a battle in our knees. Okay. He says he had died and rose again and no no one has ascended up but he that came down first. When he was in heaven, he was the logos then went out of God in the beginning and he came down from earth and he was not be made an angel and he be made an angel. He became down on earth took the form of a bondsman not an angel not come down in great Jehovah glory but he came down in the men's to redeem man to die for men to die for man he never died as God he died as a man &gt;&gt; see because God cannot die his spirit this his body his flesh died the sin of man was upon the sin of man and He had to be to become a man in order to pay the penalty. What did he do? The Bible said he was made a little lower than angels in order for debt that he might take away and abolish sins and take away sickness from word. Now when he came down from the highest logos from God, he came down through angels and came down and was made man and he said I am not even a man. I am a worm and no man. For he was despised and rejected. He was he uh he was he had come down the logos from heaven when he went back to took with him. He took with him. Then the high priest being a high priest anointed with the torch light of his own blood. When he went down there over their power here that accused wouldn't let God and my fellowship is being broke. See that is is broken. He broke all that in the garden of Eden. See done the thing the domain of this earth which Satan it belongs to the devil. But when he come the anointed high priest you know we'll take care of that and he did. So in order so we can close. Uh I hope I didn't confuse you more that you were already confused. No, you're not the confused people and I'm not confused. All I'm saying is this that we need to understand that we have a place and a position in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, even though our flesh is here, we have a position and a place. &gt;&gt; And when we realize who we are and what we are and what is waiting and what God has made for God, then you will have authority and you will have power over the spirit. And the fight is not against your brother, your sister. The fight is against principalities, Satan, spirits in heavenly places. How do you fight? You fight in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Walk in the spirit &gt;&gt; and not in the flesh." &gt;&gt; Everything that we have to do, we do it in the spirit. And if the spirit has to agree with that spirit &gt;&gt; that's why sometimes uh uh we have so much trouble sometimes in the agreement sometime we agree with each other but we need to agree with the word of God and in heaven &gt;&gt; whatever he has said when you pray you know you talk to God and you ask and you have a desire But you must wait until you get an answer because uh it won't come out right because if we do whatever we want to do when we pray thinking that okay well I talked to God he never I never heard anything that mean I guess he's all right to do it because I didn't heard he didn't say no that's what I used to do with my mom and dad I asked dad but he never said no so I get it's okay that's not how things work in the in this realm so so when we pray. We wait for an answer from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when that answer come, you know it is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, shall we stand then? Sorry, it's a little broken, but I hope that the Holy Spirit will will help you understand that we are not alone. You know who has the best interest vested in you tonight? You theophony. You know that theophony wants you to make it because if you don't make it, he will have a make. He will make it. He needs the other half is in you. So no wonder when you accepted this message, you heard from where? Oh, glory to God finally. Now we are coming together. Finally, we can get things going and let's get things done. I've been waiting for that body. I was worried the other day that you was going to get killed. I went to Vietnam. I almost got killed a few times. But I could not die yet because I couldn't didn't know this truth. And that the offen helps me because he knew if he if I get lost, he had no body to go into. We need he needs a part that we have and we need that part. &gt;&gt; So tonight I want you to know that it is just more than you in flesh that there is a spiritual realm. That's &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that is around us &gt;&gt; that is active and it's positive and it's moving. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not fighting a fight on your own. Don't get worried. Don't get tired. There's a whole heaven that is backing you up &gt;&gt; if you realize where your place is at and your position is at and how these things are moving. Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you once again for this opportunity that we had to to address this congregation. Father, I just ask that I know with my broken English and my broken message, Father, but I know that your spirit will will put things together, Father, in the way that you intended uh to be, Father. You because that's how you are. That's that's the way you are, Father. We we are we are weak. Uh sometimes we we we got fears and uh sometimes we we we don't think we can do it. But and I'm glad because we can and we got fears and we weak. But I'm glad that when we are weak, you're strong and you lead us and you guide us. Uh and you are the one that give us the strength to to move on. You give us the word to speak. Father, all you want us is to rely on you to to surrender our life to you to yield and you will do the rest. Father, Father, thank you for this opportunity uh in this side of of heaven in this in time, Father. And I hope that I I I could be a little bit of service. uh uh I'm more interested in helping a little bit uh in any kind of way and and and I'm just praying and hoping that that uh we had done that tonight father that we had learned a little bit more father of your nature your ways father your word and how you operate father we we uh uh again uh pray for this church this congregation father we ask you to to keep our pastor Pastor Lord uh give him strength, give him health, continue give him uh what he needs to continue the word that you had said before him father and those that are supporting him father again father we ask you to to keep him to cover them to protect them from the evil one father so we can continue father the word that you had uh uh gave us father to to finish in this end time father because if we are sick uh we cannot do That's impossible. Lord, we always require the strength and the help, but we wanted just to do your work, your service, Father. And we thank you tonight, Father, for those that that made the effort to come. But we also ask you to bless those that are listening, Father. And we ask you that uh you protect them from the evil one as as we depart from each other and take us home. Father, sound safe. Father, we love you and we thank you. And we tell you that we love you, Father. And we thank you for everything you have done for us that this you continue doing. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask you all these things. Amen. And amenus. Thank you. Praise the Lord. Have you appreciated the teaching tonight? scripture after scripture after scripture laying in such a wonderful truth tonight. I would like to elaborate on it, but we have lack of time. But uh I'll tell you that he laid in some pretty solid scriptures about what it means to be standing in the authority to speak the word in authority. It's not a human thing, but we're drawing from a position in heavenly places. And I'll tell you, I sure enjoyed each scripture confirming that tonight and enjoyed the word of God. I told my uh daughter-in-law today who's just close. She's great with child and uh she was eating a sandwich at lunch there today or this afternoon and I said, you know, go ahead and eat more cuz you're you're eating for two. You know that. And you got to do that. And and uh I enjoyed that. When my wife was pregnant, I kind of joined in with that even though I didn't wasn't having the baby. But there's something about that you have another life within you and you have to feed the other life as well. And that's when you have the Holy Ghost. You have a connection with your theophony. Can you say amen? And that's feeding you. And you, as you feed on the true word of God, you're feeding that. And that is what gives us strength and power and position to be able to have power over the enemy. That policeman stands there with a badge. He has no power of his own. But there is a headquarters that would back up that policeman. If he stands with his hand up, he's got the authority. And there's a headquarters somewhere. And we have a headquarters in the other dimension that's going to back up God's word when we speak it. And I tell you, I enjoyed that tonight. I appreciate it so much that our prayer would have authority. How many desires your prayer to have authority? It's not just saying prayers. It's not just praying, but God, when we go, we stand flatfooted in our position, and we know that our prayer has a meaning before God. Praise the Lord. I want to say before we close tonight, how much I appreciate my lovely wife. I she's not there and I was going to say something nice. I don't know what happened. It is our 32nd anniversary today and it was this evening. It was on a Friday night in Johnson City, Tennessee. Brother Donnie Reagan and the whole congregation. It was Ken and Bess were there. You got there a little late but uh but they made it and uh it was on tonight and so 32 years ago. So God has blessed us these 32 years. We love and appreciate uh my I know you all do. I love uh what she means to me and I'm the man I am because of God and because of my wife and I love her tonight. I don't know where she went but uh I honor her tonight in our uh marriage this many years. We appreciate it. Heavenly Father, thank you Lord for the word. Thank you Lord that you have enriched our lives with it and Lord teaching stabilizes the church. Sometimes Lord, we receive all these scriptures and they just go over and over in our hearts and our minds and we realize Lord, you lay these revelations and what we always believe and say amen to. But Lord, teaching solidifies why we believe what we believe. And we're thankful for the word. Bless and give strength to brother Eli, Lord, tonight for giving us the word. Bless us now in these next few days until we meet together again on Sunday, Lord, for the Sunday school and for the regular service. May you send your Holy Spirit to the ministry and also Lord those who are receiving. We thank you tonight. We give you all the glory and we ask it in Jesus name. Everybody said amen. I'm pressing on the upward way as we go tonight. You're welcome to stay in worship, but you have to be dismissed. I know many of you have work and school. God bless you tonight and may you express your gratitude to the Lord for the word that's been brought tonight. Amen. I'm pressing on. God bless you all. The upward way. New heights I'm gaining every day. Still praying as Amen. I'm onward. Lord, plant my feet on high. your ground. Amen. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on him. Let's save land, a higher plane that I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. My heart has no desire to say where doubts arise and fears dismay. Though some may dwell where these abound, my prayer, my name is high your ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table land. a higher place that I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Oh, hey.
