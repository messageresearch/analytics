[7:01] Jesus for
[7:03] my I speak the Holy
[7:07] Name
[7:15] Jesus second Kings chapter 4 is where we
[7:18] want to read 2 Kings chapter 4 now there
[7:21] cried a certain woman of the wives of
[7:24] the sons of the prophets unto Elisha
[7:26] saying thy servant my husband is dead
[7:29] and th th knowest that thy servant did
[7:31] fear the lord and the Creditor is come
[7:33] to take unto him my two sons to be Bond
[7:36] men so it was very rough times down the
[7:39] road from when Elijah pronounced
[7:41] judgment on the whole generation the
[7:43] whole nation and so there this this
[7:46] godly woman is living under the Shadow
[7:49] and the the gloominess and the debt and
[7:51] all that's happening and now they want
[7:53] to take her sons take her family under
[7:55] the debt creditors are coming she
[7:58] appeals to Elisha not Elijah Elisha and
[8:00] Elisha said unto her what shall I do for
[8:02] thee tell me what hast thou in thy house
[8:05] and she said thy handmade hath not
[8:07] anything in the house save a pot of
[8:11] oil I don't have anything but a little
[8:14] pot of oil and then he said go borrow
[8:17] the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors
[8:20] even empty vessels borrow not a few and
[8:24] when thou when thou art come in Thou
[8:26] shalt shut the door upon thee and upon
[8:29] the thy
[8:30] sons and shall pour out into all those
[8:33] vessels and thou shalt set aside that
[8:35] which is full so this is not a public
[8:38] show the third poll is not a public show
[8:40] shut yourself in your house with your
[8:43] sons and start pouring that oil into
[8:46] these vessels she went from him and shut
[8:49] the door upon her and upon her sons who
[8:51] brought the vessels to her and she
[8:52] poured out and it came to pass when the
[8:54] vessels were full that she said unto her
[8:57] son bring me yet a vessel and he said
[8:59] there is not a vessel more and the oil
[9:04] stayed glory be to God and the oil
[9:09] stayed and then she came and told the
[9:12] man of God and he said go sell the oil
[9:15] pay thy debt and live thou and thy
[9:18] Children of the rest last time we talked
[9:21] about this we read in Matthew 25 the
[9:25] mystery under the seventh seal which the
[9:27] seventh seal is the coming of the Lord
[9:30] so in Matthew 25 we have three Parables
[9:32] that are related to the seventh seal or
[9:35] the coming of the Lord and that Parable
[9:37] spoke about the first Parable spoke
[9:39] about was about the oil that was
[9:42] essential to finish the journey it's
[9:45] about five wise virgins five foolish
[9:47] virgins and the only difference in the
[9:49] two there wasn't hardly there wasn't
[9:51] hardly any difference in those two
[9:53] groups Gathering they were virgins uh
[9:56] they were Sanctified they loved the Lord
[9:58] they took the journey in the message to
[10:00] go meet the bridegroom they were all in
[10:02] the same group but the only difference
[10:03] is one had oil in their lamps the other
[10:05] didn't have oil in their lamps and so we
[10:08] were speaking about this oil that is
[10:10] needed at the end time the last thing
[10:13] that they needed for the last leg of the
[10:16] journey was oil the only thing the main
[10:19] thing and so if that's a theme right now
[10:23] in the last days for our lives then we
[10:25] should be saying Lord there's one thing
[10:27] most important in me in my family's life
[10:30] do we have the oil and do we have enough
[10:33] of the Holy Spirit to finish the
[10:36] journey that's that should be dominating
[10:39] our minds more than any business
[10:41] adventure more than any family problem
[10:44] more than any sickness Lord do I have
[10:47] the oil and so now the foolish virgins
[10:50] they discovered that they didn't have it
[10:52] the last minute they discovered they had
[10:54] everything and they loved the Lord and
[10:57] they had all this but they discovered
[10:58] they didn't have the oil they came in
[11:01] the message to pursue the bridegroom
[11:03] they heard the midnight cry because when
[11:06] it says midnight how many know when it
[11:08] says midnight that's at the darkest time
[11:11] so it was at the darkest hour when the
[11:13] world had become dark when it become
[11:15] full of perversion and everything that
[11:18] it was at that time the Midnight Cry the
[11:20] final cry went out rise up it's time to
[11:23] meet the bridegroom and take the last
[11:26] the last step of the journey to meet the
[11:30] bridegroom and so they were virgins they
[11:32] were Sanctified they they re they
[11:35] rejoiced in all this cry they they
[11:38] actually woke up to the cry it wasn't
[11:40] just the wise virgins that woke up they
[11:42] woke up too they all woke up I heard the
[11:45] cry I heard the Midnight Cry they all
[11:48] were trimmed their lamps all were the
[11:50] same as far as trim they were pure good
[11:52] people Sanctified vessels of
[11:56] God but lacking the oil oil to take the
[12:00] final leg of the
[12:03] journey and that's pretty serious I
[12:05] can't preach it any more serious than
[12:07] what the parable gives it it's for our
[12:09] time it's for right now and so now if
[12:11] that's the essential thing there
[12:13] shouldn't be any other more essential
[12:15] thing in our lives except Lord every
[12:18] teenager ought to be saying I can't get
[12:19] in on my parents coattail every teenager
[12:22] should be go to God and say that's what
[12:24] the parable said my God warned me that
[12:26] the only thing lacking was the oil I
[12:28] better make sure God I'm seeking the
[12:30] Holy Ghost for myself if my dad don't
[12:34] have it my mom don't have it it doesn't
[12:36] matter I've got to seek this for myself
[12:38] it's more important than anything in
[12:39] life if Jesus said it was important and
[12:42] that's the parable we're living in right
[12:44] now and you're interested in the coming
[12:46] of the Lord and you're interested in
[12:48] meeting the bridegroom if you're
[12:49] interested in that then you have to have
[12:52] the
[12:53] oil you have to have the Holy Spirit you
[12:56] have to know that you have the Holy
[12:58] Spirit in your your life not just that
[13:00] you love God but there's an
[13:01] identification of the depth of your soul
[13:03] that I believe this word of this hour
[13:06] and I'm following it as best I can with
[13:08] all of my
[13:09] heart my goodness so important I want to
[13:12] remind just now some some things of the
[13:14] final summary I gave of Matthew 25 last
[13:17] Sunday and then we'll go into to to some
[13:19] things today it is foolish here's my
[13:21] summary of Matthew 25 it's foolish to
[13:23] pursue Christ the bridegroom without the
[13:26] oil first it's needed and I want to say
[13:28] this lastly about Matthew 25 it's about
[13:32] having what's needed to finish this
[13:35] journey we find here in the text of
[13:38] Second Kings chapter 4 that it is it's
[13:41] another witness in the Old Testament of
[13:44] the last days essential thing because
[13:47] anytime you read scriptures about Elijah
[13:49] or Elisha you're talking about our day
[13:52] because how many would say in Malachi 4
[13:54] it says he'll send Elijah the prophet
[13:56] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[13:57] Lord amen and I we believe he has sent
[14:00] that that Ministry is done it's over
[14:03] he's fulfilled that scripture Malachi
[14:05] fulfill if you're listening on the
[14:06] broadcast or any other way come and talk
[14:08] to me because there's been a lot of
[14:10] Prophecy fulfilled that people don't
[14:11] know it's been fulfilled it's been
[14:13] fulfilled already and we're living in
[14:14] the time of that right now and so now
[14:17] because we're in the days of when Elijah
[14:20] was fulfilled when we go in the Old
[14:22] Testament and read about Elijah and
[14:23] Elisha we're right in our time the types
[14:26] and shadows apply to us and we can say
[14:28] I'm living right here and so when we
[14:31] come to Elisha he says to Elijah what do
[14:34] you want Elijah says what do you want
[14:35] Elisha says that a double portion of
[14:38] your spirit would fall on
[14:40] me
[14:43] hallelujah oh my what a request he said
[14:47] if that's what you ask for that's what
[14:49] I'm going to give you you know you have
[14:51] to ask for
[14:53] things God doesn't just hand it to you
[14:56] so now Elijah goes off the scene and
[14:58] Elisha she bride it's not the masculine
[15:02] part it's the feminine part now
[15:04] everything we read about Elisha now is
[15:07] typing I wanted to say first of all
[15:09] there's so many types in this that I
[15:11] don't have enough time today to preach
[15:13] on all the types another thing is I like
[15:15] to keep my jacket on so I look proper
[15:17] and good but it's too hot today so I'm
[15:20] taking my jacket off which means that
[15:22] I'll probably preach even
[15:25] harder there's so many types about
[15:27] Elijah and Elisha
[15:29] concerning this day I don't have time
[15:30] but I want to bring out one first of all
[15:32] and that is Elisha and Elijah both had
[15:35] meetings with widows with women and they
[15:39] were widows and they were living in a
[15:40] dark time both of them and they had a
[15:42] need during the dark time that's a type
[15:44] of the Bride because we live in the
[15:46] darkest times we live in a time of debt
[15:49] spiritually can you say Amen we're in in
[15:52] debt the world's inbt spiritually we're
[15:53] in a time that they want to take our
[15:55] children how many raise your hand they
[15:56] want to take our children so all all
[15:58] these scenarios are here and both these
[16:00] women had some Elijah came to one Elisha
[16:02] came to another one and it's interesting
[16:04] how they dealt with them they they lived
[16:06] in famine they lived in debt they lived
[16:08] in depressing times they lived in a time
[16:10] of loss they were barely getting by but
[16:13] then the scripture says in chapter four
[16:15] I read to you but in the middle of that
[16:17] there cried a woman under those
[16:20] conditions a woman cried now wasn't
[16:22] there other people crying during that
[16:24] time wasn't there other women crying I'd
[16:27] say there was I'd say because of the
[16:28] depressing times and the debt and all
[16:31] the the depression there was probably
[16:32] other woman that had tears and and
[16:34] that's fine God knows about that too but
[16:37] yet God this this one these women got
[16:40] God's attention their cry got God's
[16:44] attention and so now that's a wonderful
[16:47] thing thing to recognize that they both
[16:48] went to Widow women and that was to
[16:50] their that was their Ministry because
[16:51] Elijah he had a dispensational Ministry
[16:54] he spoke to the whole nation he brought
[16:56] a curse on Jezebel he brought a curse on
[16:58] Ahab and the whole house of ABAB which
[17:00] was a Jehovah Gyra believing King he was
[17:03] the king of of Israel but he married the
[17:05] wrong woman and so now Elijah came to
[17:08] put a curse on all that thing and
[17:09] stopped up the Heavens there was no rain
[17:11] there was famine in the land all the
[17:14] conditions a lot of the oh boy let me
[17:16] say it a lot of the conditions we're in
[17:18] right now is because Elijah came in this
[17:20] hour and he spoke the word and our
[17:22] nation and our world rejected Elijah and
[17:25] that's why we're in the conditions that
[17:27] we're in so remember that can you say am
[17:30] man it's because Elijah has come that we
[17:32] live in these
[17:34] conditions but the bride has to live in
[17:36] it until the Rapture time the brides
[17:38] living in these conditions and so there
[17:40] was others crying but this one got their
[17:41] attention and they went to these women
[17:43] so now I want you to notice something
[17:45] else there was a change in leadership
[17:47] from it was the same message but it was
[17:50] a a bit of change in leadership from
[17:52] Elijah to Elisha Elijah was bold Elijah
[17:55] called fire down from heaven he spoke to
[17:58] the entire dispensation Elijah he
[18:00] rebuked the whole generation his
[18:02] indictment was to the whole religious
[18:04] system he spoke boldly to Jezebel but
[18:07] Elisha Elisha he didn't do all that he
[18:10] didn't speak judgment to the whole uh
[18:12] generation and dispensation he didn't
[18:15] have to Elijah had already done it it's
[18:17] not to the whole generation but Elijah's
[18:20] Ministry was more to the personal
[18:25] effect it wasn't to the nation it was
[18:27] more to the
[18:30] person it was to non it was to this
[18:33] widow woman it was dealing personally
[18:36] anytime he got involved with preachers
[18:37] it didn't go so well remember when he
[18:39] first was first finished there they were
[18:42] looking for Elijah they said we're we're
[18:44] going to go find Elijah would you come
[18:45] with us he said you know Elijah's gone
[18:47] on in The Chariot they're trying to
[18:48] bring Elijah back Elijah spoke to the
[18:51] whole He indicted the entire religious
[18:54] system not the people but he indicted
[18:57] the entire religious system for
[18:59] crucifying the Son of God aresh
[19:02] again but Elisha when he came he didn't
[19:05] do that it was more of a personal level
[19:08] to meet the god meeting the personal
[19:10] needs personal Revival not a national
[19:13] Revival a personal healing to
[19:15] individuals a personal restoration to
[19:19] individuals Elijah he pronounced
[19:20] Judgment of the whole system Jezebel he
[19:22] wasn't afraid of Jezebel he was B just
[19:24] telling it like it is and but but Elisha
[19:28] his manner was more to the personal
[19:30] thing and I just want to say once again
[19:32] about judgment the bride is the true
[19:34] bride is no longer under the judgments
[19:36] of
[19:37] God she has the Holy Ghost she's past
[19:39] judgment so why do you keep bringing
[19:42] judgment on the bride she's past
[19:46] judgment praise the
[19:48] Lord you say what about when Elisha
[19:52] called two she Bears Out of the Woods
[19:54] because he got offended at his complex
[19:56] about his bald head one of the things
[19:59] preachers needs well two or three things
[20:01] PE preachers have to grow out of
[20:03] personally in their walk with God
[20:04] they've got to grow out of their
[20:06] complexes right because sometimes they
[20:09] preach their complexes and not the word
[20:11] of God and that
[20:14] day if you think that he was that's the
[20:16] day that Elisha was acting like Elijah a
[20:18] little bit because he's GNA call the she
[20:20] Bears out and kill those kids but it
[20:23] looked like Elijah he's getting out of
[20:24] Step his ministry wasn't Elijah to
[20:27] pronounce judgment like that it was
[20:28] Elisha and so he acted out of place he
[20:31] made a
[20:34] mistake did I say that un
[20:38] National he made a
[20:40] mistake and he preached his own
[20:44] complex should we go through the Bible
[20:46] and talk about Moses the great prophet
[20:48] who made a mistake and one day struck
[20:51] the rock twice because of his
[20:54] frustration with the people and his
[20:56] temper got up to the people so bad he
[20:59] was supposed to strike it once and
[21:00] struck it twice made a mistake God said
[21:03] your temper that thing you're not even
[21:06] going in the promised
[21:09] land it's in your Bible everybody hold
[21:11] your Bible it's it's it's in
[21:16] there God's true Prophet
[21:19] definitely but he made a mistake there
[21:21] he got in the
[21:22] flesh and so Elisha that's the one time
[21:25] I don't know why I'm elaborating on this
[21:27] is not in my notes but i' like to say
[21:29] that he called them out he shouldn't
[21:30] have done that because once again it's
[21:31] this whole thing is that the
[21:33] administration or the leadership had
[21:35] changed under Elisha even though the
[21:36] spirit was a double portion the
[21:38] administration of it changed a bit
[21:40] because it was not to speak to the
[21:41] nation there was not to be a national
[21:43] Revival that was that day he called fire
[21:46] down and then Israel they all they come
[21:47] around that he did Elijah was to do that
[21:50] can you say Amen around the country
[21:52] almost in every major city in this
[21:54] nation Elijah spoke
[21:56] amen now now Elisha he ministers and he
[22:00] ministers personally it's not a national
[22:03] Revival and so now one of the things
[22:07] that Elisha does
[22:09] clearly is when someone has a
[22:13] need he always asks for them to do
[22:15] something
[22:17] first before he meets the need now
[22:20] Elijah had the power if somebody was out
[22:22] of money or somebody had Elijah he just
[22:24] say okay it's yours that's it it's yours
[22:26] but somehow with elij Elisha he's asking
[22:30] for them to do something that's right
[22:32] and then they get their
[22:35] Miracle non was struck with Leprosy and
[22:38] he comes send he didn't even go himself
[22:40] he said you you go and tell non he needs
[22:43] to dip seven times in the dirtiest River
[22:46] in all of Israel Jordan he needs to go
[22:50] dip seven times and then he'll receive
[22:51] my healing now this is a great man and
[22:54] he's and he doesn't even come himself my
[22:56] dad used to say that the servant knocked
[22:58] on the door and non came to the door and
[23:00] it servant he said I asked for Elisha to
[23:03] come he said Elijah said he's not coming
[23:05] he just sent me his
[23:08] servant well I want to see the man I
[23:11] want to see the pastor
[23:14] himself good thing he didn't have that
[23:17] attitude but he says um he said if you
[23:21] go down and dip seven times in Jordan
[23:25] you'll be healed that's right just at
[23:28] that moment is a test of your
[23:31] faith but it's God asking you to do
[23:34] something dirty not dirty in the sense
[23:36] of sinful but doing something that's not
[23:39] convenient not easy so go dip seven
[23:43] times okay all right I'll go do it and
[23:47] maybe he was grumbling the whole time I
[23:49] wanted to see Elijah I wanted to see the
[23:51] guy and he goes down this is the
[23:53] muddiest river in in all of Israel the
[23:55] Jordan why couldn't he pick this how
[23:57] could he why oh why do I have to do
[24:00] this he dipped finish the story he went
[24:04] ahead and dipped seven times and when he
[24:06] come out he was healed of his leprosy so
[24:08] this Prophet was asking you to do
[24:10] something
[24:11] first a personal contact with God
[24:15] through Elisha but he's asking for you
[24:17] to do something first and he did that
[24:19] with this woman he says woman what do
[24:21] you have need of what can I do for you
[24:23] she says they're going to take my sons
[24:25] we're in debt you know my husband's gone
[24:27] a widow he served you with the fear of
[24:29] God he loved the message of the hour
[24:31] he's gone we're under the pressure of
[24:33] this famine and they're going to take my
[24:35] children I have nothing he said you have
[24:37] nothing she said I have nothing do you
[24:39] have anything well I've got a pot of oil
[24:41] left now when Elijah dealt with the
[24:43] widow woman she had a little a little
[24:45] meal and she had a little bit of oil and
[24:47] he says I want you to take that and make
[24:49] a cake she said well I'm making the cake
