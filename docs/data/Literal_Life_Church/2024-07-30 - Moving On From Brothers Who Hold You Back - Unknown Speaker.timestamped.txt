[5:22] oh you
[5:25] [Music]
[5:51] Deuteronomy chapter 2 and verse 2 and
[5:54] the Lord spake unto me saying ye have
[5:56] com compassed this mountain long enough
[5:59] turn turn you
[6:01] northward and command thou the people
[6:04] saying ye are to pass through the coast
[6:07] of your brethren the children of Esau
[6:10] it's interesting that he calls the
[6:11] children of Esau your brethren but if
[6:14] you look back they are related to the
[6:16] children of Esau your brother and the
[6:19] children of Esau which dwell in seir and
[6:21] they shall be afraid of you take ye good
[6:24] heed unto yourselves therefore meddle
[6:26] not with them meddle not with these
[6:28] brothers for I will not give you of
[6:30] their land no not so much as a foot
[6:33] breath because I have given Mount seir
[6:37] unto Esau for a possession I want to
[6:40] skip to verse eight and when ye passed
[6:43] by our Brethren the children of Esau
[6:45] which dwelt in sear through the way of
[6:47] the plain from elth and from Eon gabbar
[6:51] we turned and passed by the way of the
[6:53] Wilderness of Moab and the Lord said
[6:55] unto me distress not the moabites
[6:58] neither contend with them in battle for
[7:00] I will not give thee of their land for a
[7:03] possession because I have given our unto
[7:06] the children of lot for a
[7:09] possession verse 14 and they spake in
[7:12] which we came from Cades Baria until we
[7:14] were come over the brook of zared was 38
[7:18] years until all the generation of the
[7:20] men of War were wasted out from the
[7:22] among of among the host as the Lord
[7:24] swear unto them for indeed the hand of
[7:26] the Lord was against them to destroy
[7:28] them with among the among the hosts
[7:30] until they were consumed and then I want
[7:33] to just read one more verse in 19 if you
[7:36] will and when thou comest nigh over
[7:39] against the children of Ammon distress
[7:42] them not nor meddle with them for I will
[7:46] not give thee of the land of the
[7:47] children of Ammon any possession because
[7:50] I have given it unto the children of lot
[7:53] for their possession I'd like to speak a
[7:56] little bit this morning on moving on
[7:59] from from brothers who hold you back
[8:02] this is a quite a powerful section of
[8:06] scripture here that I really can't get
[8:07] away from from a little while I I think
[8:09] it's a powerful word from the Lord in
[8:12] the scripture that instructs the people
[8:15] to turn northward to their true
[8:18] inheritance this is what it looked like
[8:20] when the children of Israel came out of
[8:23] Egypt now here is uh Egypt over here and
[8:27] this is where they're under bondage to
[8:28] pharaoh living in the land of Goan right
[8:31] here and then God sends a prophet and
[8:33] calls them out of Egypt supernaturally
[8:36] sending signs and wonders and miracles
[8:38] to the prophet to show that he was alive
[8:41] and I'm going to bring my people out and
[8:42] the purpose wasn't just to show Miracles
[8:44] the purpose was I'm going to bring my
[8:47] people out of bondage so God come down
[8:49] he said said to Moses I am come down to
[8:52] deliver my people and I'm sending you
[8:54] Moses the prophet which is God's pattern
[8:56] throughout Generations when they get
[8:57] under bondage God says I'm going to come
[9:00] down and I'm going to do something and
[9:02] Moses I'm sending you notice God's
[9:04] pattern God's come down but he's sending
[9:06] a prophet to do it and so he's never
[9:08] changed that pattern so now when they're
[9:10] here they they come out of Egypt and
[9:12] they cross the Red Sea here if you read
[9:14] in Sunday school if you were listening
[9:16] in Sunday school these are all stories
[9:18] that you heard they come out of Egypt
[9:20] they come here uh God drowns Pharaoh's
[9:22] Army in this was a great Victory on the
[9:24] other side of right here they're
[9:25] shouting and rejoicing and then for some
[9:27] reason they head south even even though
[9:29] the land God has given him is up here
[9:32] and you know Gaza because of what's in
[9:34] the news now but here's the land of
[9:35] Israel and God promised this part of
[9:38] real estate to Israel as their promised
[9:40] land that he promised to Abraham and
[9:43] it's taken all these years to make this
[9:44] journey but here if you look and these
[9:46] are simple little things that you can
[9:48] everybody can catch they only had just a
[9:51] few days journey to go from Egypt or
[9:53] from here straight up to their land why
[9:55] in the world did they head south for all
[9:59] all of these these two years Mount Si is
[10:02] where God gave them the word The Ten
[10:04] Commandments then they come back up this
[10:06] way and then as I've been preaching they
[10:08] Circle this mountain the sear mountains
[10:11] they Circle this mountain for 38 of the
[10:14] 40 years only three days journey to get
[10:17] to their uh destination and they Circle
[10:21] this mountain for 30 years I just read
[10:22] it in the Bible 38 years you circled
[10:25] this mountain until finally finally God
[10:28] says he's had enough they've probably
[10:31] had enough and he says I'm tired of you
[10:33] circling this mountain it's time to turn
[10:37] northward in our walk with the Lord and
[10:40] how God is leading the bride I can
[10:42] clearly say there Comes A Time When God
[10:45] Says in your life it's time to quit
[10:47] wandering around mountains it's time to
[10:49] quit wandering around the same things
[10:52] it's time to get out of the cycles that
[10:54] Satan has put you in and when he says
[10:57] it's time to move on to your full
[10:58] inheritance it's it's time to move
[11:01] on and he may be speaking that to you
[11:03] today how many how many years you can be
[11:05] in bondage you can be also not in
[11:07] bondage but the Wilderness wandering
[11:09] around in the wilderness and this is a
[11:10] real mystery why they came all the way
[11:13] down here but I'm going to give a few
[11:14] things in a few minutes that I'll remind
[11:16] you of the reasons why they wandered
[11:18] that long and didn't go northward but
[11:20] he's telling them to go northward
[11:21] because they're going to Cross Jordan
[11:23] and when they Cross Jordan then they'll
[11:25] take their land and fight for their land
[11:27] and take it back just want to make one
[11:29] point out of the scripture this morning
[11:31] while they're here and while they head
[11:32] up through this area there are what God
[11:35] calls Brothers brothers and he doesn't
[11:39] want the people to go through these
[11:41] brothers he calls them brothers if God
[11:43] calls them brothers we have to call them
[11:45] brothers but he wants to make a point
[11:48] the brothers or the family or the maybe
[11:51] back in their history they're tied to
[11:52] Abraham is Esau all these guys were tied
[11:56] here Abraham someway uh Jacob and so
[11:58] Jacob Esau uh ishmail all these people
[12:02] of the of the lineage that come from
[12:04] those people they're related but God
[12:07] makes the point I do not want you to to
[12:10] meddle with these brothers because if
[12:13] you meddle with them you'll stay put
[12:15] with those brothers and it'll keep you
[12:18] from moving on to the land that I give
[12:20] you here's the point he said I have
[12:22] given them this land but I have not
[12:25] given you this land I've given you
[12:28] something
[12:30] better that's not belittling what they
[12:33] have but you're not called to stay there
[12:35] and meddle with these Brethren you're
[12:37] called to something higher let me as a
[12:39] gospel Minister this morning to say to
[12:41] anyone that's here anyone listening on
[12:43] the broadcast I believe because you're
[12:46] listening this morning I believe I can
[12:47] safely say God has called you to
[12:50] something higher than what you're living
[12:53] now God has called you to something
[12:56] higher and you cannot remain circling a
[12:59] mountain in your life when God is
[13:01] calling you to something higher can you
[13:04] say
[13:04] amen and so as looking at the mat 38
[13:08] years wandering and actually cing
[13:10] circling around and around the mountain
[13:12] stuck in the same place God got weary of
[13:15] it and he said I've called you to
[13:16] something higher and that called to
[13:18] something higher is in harmony with the
[13:20] New Testament when Paul said to forget
[13:24] those things which are behind and press
[13:27] toward the mark of the a high calling in
[13:31] Christ
[13:32] Jesus so it's in the New Testament too
[13:34] that God finally says hey get past your
[13:38] past forget your past I love the subject
[13:41] of the past I love to preach about it
[13:44] because I I I have realized through the
[13:46] years and especially pastoring and also
[13:48] in my own life getting past those things
[13:51] behind you is people don't realize all
[13:53] the things that can include your past
[13:56] there's a lot it's not just your past
[13:57] sins of being in the world and adultery
[14:00] and whatever else you did in the world
[14:03] uh then you became a Christian but it's
[14:04] not just your past sins that you get
[14:07] past but there's many things that are
[14:09] related to your past that can keep you
[14:13] from moving on to a higher calling I
[14:16] don't want anybody this morning to stay
[14:18] where you're at but God has called you
[14:20] to a higher calling and one of the ways
[14:22] you get to that is to forget your
[14:25] past you say well what if I'm not
[14:27] forgiven yet bring it to the cross of
[14:29] Christ can I get an amen what if the
[14:32] devil's still beating me up bring it to
[14:34] the Cross of Christ he said if we're if
[14:37] we repent of our sins he's faithful and
[14:40] just to forgive us of our sins to wash
[14:42] away our past whatever you've done you
[14:45] you've killed somebody the the worst
[14:47] things bring it to the Lord he says I
[14:50] will bring forgiveness from the flood of
[14:51] Calvary you'll be washed and completely
[14:54] clean can you say Amen can I get an amen
[14:56] this morning this is the gospel can you
[14:59] say this is the good news that you don't
[15:01] have to carry your guilt of sin you can
[15:04] bring it to him and he'll wash it all
[15:06] away that's the Simplicity of the Gospel
[15:08] of Jesus Christ to know that you have
[15:12] been
[15:13] forgiven lot of times with people though
[15:16] in their past they've been forgiven they
[15:17] said I accept God's forgiveness but
[15:19] Satan still tries to use it and there's
[15:21] other past things past not just past
[15:24] sins past former teaching about
[15:27] God you've been wrong about God well I
[15:30] went to that Sunday School in that
[15:32] denomination all those years you may
[15:34] have been taught a little bit wrong
[15:36] about God so if that's your P you say
[15:39] well who in the Bible did that the
[15:41] Apostle Paul the prophet Paul he learned
[15:45] in all the highest teachers of the land
[15:48] he learned all about Jehovah God and
[15:50] when he come to that Pillar of Fire and
[15:52] the reality of God he said I had to
[15:55] forget not my past sins not just my sins
[15:59] had to forget all of my former
[16:01] learning about God and consider it dung
[16:06] in order to receive
[16:07] Christ so that's a past that's not you
[16:10] know drinking and adultery and all these
[16:13] things that's a past of learning God the
[16:16] wrong way
[16:18] on and say I've got to die to that past
[16:22] Lord show me the right way amen it's a
[16:25] higher calling can you say Amen there's
[16:27] some other things of the past I I can
[16:29] mention past influences of other people
[16:32] past hurts and pains from people I know
[16:35] nobody's ever had past hurts and pains
[16:37] from people I have I know none of you
[16:40] have I'm being sarcastic none of past
[16:44] hurts and pain somebody's done me wrong
[16:46] someone did something dastardly to me 20
[16:48] years ago I'll never forgive that person
[16:50] well you may be bound the rest of your
[16:52] life because forgiveness is the only
[16:54] thing to be
[16:56] released to be released of that past
[16:59] sins past hurts and pain past Church
[17:02] situations that damaged
[17:04] you should be getting a bigger amen than
[17:08] that there are past Church situations
[17:10] that we don't like to talk about but
[17:12] they're hurtful situations and people
[17:15] don't get past those things true but in
[17:19] order to move to the higher calling you
[17:21] got to get past that every history of
[17:23] the church has good bad and ugly in
[17:25] Israel's history they had Miracles they
[17:28] had signs the water turned to blood they
[17:30] had a sign in the heaven of the pillar
[17:32] of fire they had a cloud by day a pillar
[17:34] of fire at night they had wonders done
[17:36] by Moses they had the uh water come out
[17:39] of the rock they had healings and our
[17:41] history has had the same thing don't
[17:43] tell me that God hasn't done
[17:45] Supernatural healings in this
[17:47] congregation from this testimony from
[17:50] last testimony all the way back till we
[17:52] had a young girl that got cancer she was
[17:54] 8 years old and God supernaturally
[17:57] healed her of that cancer and she still
[17:59] alive
[18:00] today we've got a history of God doing
[18:03] Mighty
[18:04] things come along and say there's been
[18:06] nothing happening in the bride till now
[18:08] I defy that God has been doing Mighty
[18:11] things through the years I don't know
[18:13] where you've been but he's been doing
[18:15] and our history is full of all kinds of
[18:18] good things healings that defy the
[18:21] doctor's word yeah anybody with me this
[18:24] morning we've had healings recently of
[18:26] cancer that defy the doctor's word defy
[18:30] the pronouncement of a doctor that defy
[18:33] a sentence of death we've got
[18:35] testimonies that God stepped
[18:39] in our history has
[18:42] good but it has bad and ugly too and
[18:46] Israel in their history had
[18:48] fighting bickering fussing but I just
[18:52] want to be honest one of the things
[18:54] people are appreciating about the
[18:55] testimonies is the honesty the
[18:57] transparency how many to raise your hand
[18:59] no sense in hiding anything tell it like
[19:01] it is this is what I'm going through and
[19:04] I know think you you think I'm a super
[19:06] duper human being but I'm not a super
[19:09] duper human being I'm a a flesh man but
[19:12] I got a super god that's living in me
[19:15] somebody say Amen I've got a super duper
[19:17] God living in me with a super
[19:20] sign but I by myself am not a super
[19:22] human being I'm capable of anything of
[19:25] this world I'm capable of killing
[19:27] someone without God I'm nothing yeah but
[19:31] because of God because he's real he can
[19:34] take worthlessness he can take ashes and
[19:37] make Beauty out of Ashes can somebody
[19:40] say amen God can take the most
[19:43] impossible
[19:45] situation Glory I serve a god like that
[19:48] this morning glory people think it's the
[19:50] people and they're expecting Perfection
[19:52] out of the people it's not the perfect
[19:54] people it's the perfect God in living in
[19:56] the people
[19:59] you get the Holy Ghost you'll be perfect
[20:00] that's wrong teaching if you get the
[20:02] Holy Ghost you receive the power to be
[20:05] able to overcome but you'll never be
[20:07] perfect in these bodies oh can I say it
[20:10] you'll never reach perfect perfection in
[20:12] these bodies because these bodies are
[20:15] not born again can you say Amen but in
[20:18] the Holy Ghost you have a power within
[20:21] you to bring this body under
[20:24] subjection
[20:26] Glory it's not a sinless perfect in this
[20:29] body but there is a body that I'm going
[20:31] to that's
[20:34] sinless and this is all just practice
[20:37] this is getting it's just like yielding
[20:39] to the Lord until finally this body gets
[20:43] so fed up with being under subjection to
[20:46] God that just this body falls off and I
[20:51] step into another dimension of a perfect
[20:53] body a perfect body that never had a
[20:56] wrong thought a perfect body that that
[20:58] never gets sick a perfect body that
[21:01] never gets depressed I'm telling you
[21:03] friends that's your destination this
[21:04] morning you will receive a perfect body
[21:07] but it's not
[21:08] here Israel had that history but God
[21:12] finally
[21:13] says it's time to move forward
[21:19] Glory it's time to move forward that's
[21:22] right all the Miracles didn't say that
[21:24] you're in your land yet that's right
[21:27] that's not the proof that you're in your
[21:28] land yet because we're still having
[21:30] Miracles that doesn't prove you're in
[21:32] your land yet Pentecost had that we've
[21:36] had that for years you can have all the
[21:38] Miracles and still not be in your land
[21:40] fully yet how many raise your hand I
[21:42] want to be in that land God's called me
[21:44] to I don't want to be stuck with
[21:45] brothers that's keeping me as I want to
[21:46] be in that land if he called me to a
[21:48] higher calling how many raise your I
[21:49] want to be in that higher calling I want
[21:51] to press into that higher calling it's
[21:53] about our journey the Lord with us and
[21:55] so this is a journey can you see that
[21:57] yeah it's a Journey like Israel had a
[21:59] journey and with a journey you have a
[22:01] destination if you start out on a trip
[22:03] you know you have a destination and you
[22:06] can see many good sites along the way
[22:09] but if you're headed somewhere you're
[22:11] not fully satisfied until you get to the
[22:14] destination can you say amen amen uh you
[22:17] can take a trip across America you can
[22:18] see a lot of pretty sites along the way
[22:20] but what's the destination in this
[22:22] journey of serving the lord you can see
[22:24] many good things but you can see some
[22:26] bad things too you can come through
[22:28] Construction
[22:29] you can come through things that would
[22:30] delay you you have to go around a detour
[22:32] I hate detours you have to go around but
[22:34] the journey is the journey go what's it
[22:36] about it's not about the construction
[22:38] it's not about the delays it's about the
[22:41] destination it's not if you're under a
[22:43] trial for 3 years that's not what God's
[22:45] looking at it's about the destination
[22:48] it's about the victory at the
[22:50] end glory be to God I might get excited
[22:54] this
[22:55] morning you're not already excited
[22:59] hallelujah it's about the destination
[23:01] you know when you go on a journey you
[23:02] can have car
[23:06] trouble you're headed somewhere and you
[23:08] know I'm an impatient person it's like I
[23:10] want to get there I want to get to
[23:12] especially if I'm going to the mountains
[23:13] and God's calling me back those Smoky
[23:15] Mountains I want to get there I want to
[23:17] get there it's like 7 hours and I want
[23:21] to get there and then you can have but
[23:22] in a journey you can have car
[23:24] trouble you can have a flat tire
[23:28] anybody listening this
[23:30] morning with a trip you get The Good the
[23:32] Bad and the
[23:34] Ugly you you you can get on the wrong
[23:38] road none of you have ever done this
[23:40] either you get on the wrong road the GPS
[23:43] leads you the wrong way yeah I thought
[23:45] it was perfect I can tell you it's not
[23:49] perfect you know you have this argument
[23:51] in the car too is that the husbands get
[23:54] real arrogant they know more than Siri
[23:58] they no more than this woman that's
[24:00] talking to you and so you have this
[24:02] little argument going on because the
[24:03] husband feels like she's not right I'm
[24:06] right and he gets proved wrong when
[24:08] you're off in the desert somewhere and
[24:11] papa thought he had it
[24:14] right and the wife she just so nice and
[24:17] sweet I told you
[24:21] so I told you to listen to her well
[24:23] listen I've listened to her and the
[24:25] reason I don't trust her who is this
[24:28] woman
[24:29] anyway how did she come into my life I
[24:31] was doing fine without
[24:34] her I don't trust it we we were headed
[24:37] through Kentucky and we said there's
[24:39] this be beautiful national park there
[24:41] and we said we put it in the GPS we had
[24:43] MMA and Papa and everybody kids were
[24:45] small we took in there took it took back
[24:47] and they had the direction they had
[24:49] their address of the park but somehow
[24:50] that GPS took us through the some of the
[24:53] most primitive parts of Kentucky I'm
[24:55] telling you these people were way back
[24:57] woods they weren't even driving cars
[24:59] they were driving four-wheelers
[25:01] everywhere I didn't see any cars they
[25:03] just kept getting this GPS kept
[25:04] following and going and then it takes us
[25:07] down this little country road I'm seeing
[25:09] cows I'm seeing Barns and as we kept
[25:13] going down this the road gets more
[25:15] narrow and more narrow then we turn up
[25:17] here we turn up here and Papa's in the
[25:19] back car and he's he calls and he says I
[25:22] don't think this is
[25:26] it let's turn around no oh we're going
[25:29] forward keep going then it gets it goes
[25:32] smaller we can barely fit on this little
[25:34] path and then it stops in front of this
[25:37] house and there's a little path going up
[25:39] on a mountain now I know the the park is
[25:41] somewhat on the mountain problem is the
[25:43] GPS took us to the other side of the
[25:46] mountain instead of the right side where
[25:47] the entrance is so I could have got to
[25:49] the park but there's this like hiking
[25:51] path and the GPS says to go left and
[25:54] take your cars up the hiking
[25:56] path and then that's when we humbled
[25:59] oursel and said we better not do that
[26:02] you can have a GPS mislead you on a
[26:05] journey you can have people mislead you
[26:09] and you can get uh you can get detoured
[26:12] detoured from where you're supposed to
[26:14] go in the Lord by intentional
[26:18] people by people maybe
[26:22] unintentional listen if you're following
[26:25] the Lord there's only one GPS you need
[26:27] to be following
[26:30] Glory not somebody's version of the
[26:32] message but the true message of God can
[26:35] I get an amen you need need you don't
[26:37] need to follow man except God speaks
[26:40] through that man and whatever is he
[26:41] speaking from the Lord you follow that
[26:43] because we Paul said follow me as I
[26:45] follow Christ so there are men that we
[26:47] follow but it better be the Lord it
[26:48] better be his word that's the only true
[26:51] GPS in your life to get you to the
[26:54] destination and if you don't know where
[26:56] you are you can't really decide where
[26:58] you're going you have to figure out
[26:59] where you are first well I'm a sinner
[27:02] today I'm I hav an accepting Christ at
[27:04] all I don't feel like I need it maybe
[27:06] that's where you are but if you find out
[27:07] where you are and you cry out to God and
[27:09] say this is where I'm I at I realized
[27:11] today one simple thing I don't know that
[27:13] preacher he's strange he's loud he's
[27:16] yelling he's got weird glasses I don't
[27:18] know him from Sam but you know what
[27:21] today I I I establish in my heart I need
[27:24] the Lord
[27:28] and start
[27:30] there at least you know where you're
[27:31] going to start from because a GPS has to
[27:34] know where you're at first to take you
[27:36] to the destination I can't
[27:39] wait to get to the
[27:41] destination that God has called me to
[27:44] get to spiritually naturally spiritually
[27:48] to reach the High Calling Are We There
[27:50] Yet Daddy and if I'm not there yet God
[27:53] take me there and physically this
[27:55] Rapture this body change we're called to
[27:58] go to that Rapture we're called to go to
[28:00] heaven that is our
[28:03] destination Daddy are we there yet we're
[28:06] not there yet but we're getting close
