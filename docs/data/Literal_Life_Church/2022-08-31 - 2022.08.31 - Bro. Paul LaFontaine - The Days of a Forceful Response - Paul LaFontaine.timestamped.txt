[0:00] trust that the lord's blessing you
[0:01] you're following him along the way and
[0:04] we appreciate what he's done this week
[0:06] received a testimony i was trying to get
[0:08] it on my phone there but
[0:10] wonderful testimony yesterday
[0:12] and hopefully i can just read through
[0:14] some of it maybe sunday but god is doing
[0:16] some mighty things and even in some of
[0:18] the services we're talking about
[0:20] deliverance from
[0:22] certain
[0:23] particular things and sexual temptation
[0:25] and things like that and you know the
[0:28] devil is angry you know the devil's
[0:30] upset but when we talk about it
[0:32] according to the word of god and god's
[0:34] spirit is there there's going to be
[0:35] deliverance for those who are yielding
[0:38] to it and those who are listening with
[0:40] open heart those who are confessing amen
[0:43] we appreciate what he's doing
[0:45] matthew chapter 11 and verse 11
[0:48] and then we'll go to luke 16 16.
[0:51] matthew 11 and verse 11. sure nice to
[0:54] see a nice turnout here tonight god
[0:55] bless you all those are listening online
[0:57] all over wherever our saints are god
[0:59] bless you each one at home there tonight
[1:03] verily i say unto you among them that
[1:05] are born of women there hath not risen a
[1:08] greater than john the baptist
[1:10] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:13] kingdom of heaven
[1:15] is greater than he what a amazing
[1:18] scripture tonight to realize that when
[1:20] we take someone like john the baptist
[1:22] who had the spirit of elijah on him and
[1:24] such a powerful ministry to introduce
[1:26] the messiah coming the first time
[1:28] then we realized that he ends this verse
[1:31] by saying there's not risen greater than
[1:33] john the baptist
[1:35] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:37] kingdom of heaven is greater than john
[1:39] the baptist
[1:40] so this we look at things in levels and
[1:43] certain positions and they the world
[1:45] teaches us we're in certain high
[1:47] positions low positions but in the
[1:49] kingdom of god the least the least one
[1:51] among in the kingdom of at least one
[1:53] that we would feel as the least and has
[1:55] no popularity has no position
[1:58] has every bit of the power of god
[2:00] available to them
[2:02] can you say amen and that's why you can
[2:04] see the least in the kingdom is greater
[2:06] than he
[2:07] god certainly puts his prophets in a
[2:09] place in a special place to speak
[2:11] through them but the prophets are not a
[2:13] special place where they get all of the
[2:15] power of god from calvary every believer
[2:18] gets that
[2:19] from the greatest to the least can you
[2:21] say man
[2:22] this is a scripture i wanted to uh
[2:24] preach a little bit on tonight and from
[2:26] the days of john the baptist until now
[2:30] the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence
[2:32] i quoted this a couple weeks ago can't
[2:34] remember all that i was preaching on but
[2:36] i know i was talking about the
[2:37] dimensions
[2:38] and how that the dimensions of demons
[2:40] the dimensions of the demon demonic
[2:43] forces increase more and i quoted this
[2:46] scripture and i have a few things to say
[2:48] tonight just relation to this scripture
[2:51] because the bible pinpoints the time of
[2:54] elijah who john the master had the
[2:56] spirit of elijah since he came and began
[2:58] speaking from that time the kingdom of
[3:01] heaven suffereth violence from the
[3:03] demonic realm so something triggers all
[3:07] that demonic realm and i was talking
[3:08] about uh you know just the dimension of
[3:11] health spilling over into our dimension
[3:13] and those things and this this gives the
[3:16] trigger for it where it becomes worse
[3:18] and that is when john the baptist came
[3:20] and began to speak with the spirit of
[3:22] elijah
[3:23] the kingdom of heaven suffered a violent
[3:26] attack from the demonic realm which
[3:29] should hold that thought tonight
[3:32] and then here i wanted to add this one
[3:34] in luke 16 and verse 16. if you wouldn't
[3:36] mind
[3:37] luke 16 16.
[3:43] it says here the law and the prophets
[3:45] were until john
[3:47] since that time the kingdom of heaven
[3:51] is preached and every man
[3:54] presseth into it
[3:57] so here's another pinpointing time to
[4:00] from the prophet john with the spirit of
[4:01] elijah and when you hit that point
[4:04] because of the increase in the demonic
[4:06] realm from that point of elijah speaking
[4:08] then we realize that
[4:10] i'll just word it the way they say it
[4:12] here the king he says it here the
[4:14] kingdom of god is preached
[4:16] and every man does what if you want to
[4:19] get a hold of it you got to press into
[4:21] it
[4:24] every man press it into it amen heavenly
[4:26] father bless us tonight in the word of
[4:28] god it's nice to see those who have come
[4:30] and gathered and those are gathering
[4:32] in their homes lord from far distances
[4:35] lord we just pray that they would be
[4:36] praying and lord their hearts will be
[4:38] opened to the word of god tonight
[4:41] we want to thank you for the testimonies
[4:43] of what's coming in lord from the camp
[4:46] and lord just powerful things lord and
[4:48] change has taken place and even this
[4:50] week hearing the great testimonies
[4:53] and lord we know that the world will not
[4:55] hear these things but nevertheless
[4:57] though these testimonies the scripture
[4:59] says they overcame by the word of god by
[5:02] the testimony lord when they proclaim
[5:04] that then we realize satan's kingdom is
[5:06] is damaged father because we know your
[5:08] power is getting through to the people
[5:11] we pray you'll bless tonight bless our
[5:12] hearts take our tiredness away lord as
[5:15] we give focus on the word of god tonight
[5:17] we pray in jesus name amen god bless you
[5:20] may be seated tonight
[5:22] i want to finish that scripture in
[5:23] matthew i'll finish the rest of it it
[5:25] says from the days of john the baptist
[5:27] until now the kingdom of heaven
[5:30] suffereth violence and i didn't finish
[5:32] it and the violent take it by force so i
[5:36] want to look at that a little bit
[5:37] tonight and i think it's interesting to
[5:40] realize that this is referring to john
[5:42] the baptist as being uh uh when he spoke
[5:45] his word for the for the messiah to come
[5:48] there was a turning point in the the
[5:50] pressures and a turning point in the
[5:52] demonic realm
[5:54] to begin coming against the kingdom of
[5:56] god more than it was before elijah spoke
[6:00] and i want to just emphasize that to you
[6:02] the the scripture pinpoints a time that
[6:04] when elijah speaks something and he and
[6:07] that word goes into the land that that
[6:10] from that point there is a there's an
[6:13] anger there's a there's a stirring up of
[6:15] the demonic realm there's a change that
[6:18] the demonic realm was always there and
[6:20] it's always come against the word of god
[6:21] it's always thwarted the people god
[6:23] trying to hinder the people of god but
[6:25] there's something increased
[6:27] after elijah's word goes out into the
[6:30] land
[6:31] and so there's something
[6:33] very
[6:34] significant something very special
[6:37] about elijah's word how many can raise
[6:39] your hand and say tonight i know we're
[6:41] living in the same time because elijah's
[6:43] word has went into the land
[6:45] so this is very important to us now
[6:47] because we realize through the bible god
[6:49] trusted that word trusted that spirit so
[6:53] much that it would deliver his word that
[6:54] god used it five times god is going to
[6:57] use it one more time he's used it for
[6:59] three times before used it in the end
[7:01] time and now he uses it you're going to
[7:02] use it to the jews and it's because
[7:04] there's something very special there's
[7:06] something about elijah's word that has
[7:09] power in it that when it goes forth once
[7:12] that word is spoken and it is sent out
[7:15] then it's in the land and one of the
[7:17] things that devil don't like about it as
[7:19] he's watched this pattern of elijah when
[7:21] he speaks something god's word doesn't
[7:23] return void and elijah's word had such a
[7:25] power of god behind it that satan has
[7:28] learned
[7:29] once elijah says it and it's in the land
[7:33] elijah can even die but the word is
[7:36] there and the word will not return void
[7:39] in other words elijah can die but the
[7:42] word is going to accomplish everything
[7:44] that elijah said and now we have a
[7:46] history to watch because every time that
[7:48] spirit was on a man everything that it
[7:51] said ended up coming to pass
[7:54] so there's something about it and maybe
[7:56] that's why the demonic realm gets so
[7:59] tense and increases its pressure against
[8:02] the people of god it's not just because
[8:05] of you
[8:06] satan
[8:07] doesn't satan doesn't come against you
[8:09] because he doesn't like your personality
[8:11] or your looks or some personal thing or
[8:14] it has nothing to do with that it's the
[8:17] word that you received you are becoming
[8:19] that word and satan knows if that word
[8:22] is in the land and you're becoming that
[8:24] word he's learned through history
[8:26] there's not anything he can do to stop
[8:28] it he still tries for some reason
[8:32] i don't know the devil's really a dummy
[8:34] isn't he
[8:35] he hasn't learned his lesson after all
[8:37] these years
[8:38] he's really stupid he he just he hasn't
[8:41] learned his life he keeps coming against
[8:43] the the people of god who surrender to
[8:46] the word that's spoken that word becomes
[8:48] power in their life because brother
[8:50] brahma says we become the word as we let
[8:53] the word go through us
[8:55] can you say praise the lord how many
[8:57] want to become the word tonight
[8:59] the bride becomes the word as she lets
[9:02] the word go through them she receives it
[9:05] and she becomes it not by some standard
[9:08] that she has to do herself or not by
[9:10] whipping herself into shape she's just
[9:11] letting the word go through her and that
[9:14] word is so powerful that you become the
[9:16] word as you feed on the word as you let
[9:19] the word go through you and you have a
[9:21] choice in that you could stay away from
[9:23] the word you can stay away from church
[9:25] you can stay away from elijah's message
[9:27] you you got your choice but the people
[9:29] on the face of the earth who are letting
[9:31] that word go through them and trying
[9:33] that's why brother brown says at least
[9:35] you're trying you have to try some
[9:37] people don't try but people are saying i
[9:39] may have mistakes i may stumble and fall
[9:42] but this word is important to me i'm
[9:44] going to keep listening to it i'm going
[9:46] to be obeying it can you say man and
[9:48] when god corrects me i'm going to do
[9:50] everything to go back even when i fall
[9:52] i'm going to go back to him again
[9:54] there's something about when we try and
[9:57] keep trying
[9:59] and let this word go through us
[10:01] then we become the word i want to become
[10:03] the word
[10:05] and it's just simply when we let the
[10:06] word go through us now elijah's word was
[10:09] so powerful that when it's in the land
[10:11] it affected the whole land his word went
[10:13] out elijah could go off the scene and
[10:15] it's still his word is still laying
[10:17] there ready to be fulfilled
[10:19] now if you go back in your bibles to the
[10:21] days of elijah when elijah spoke
[10:23] something the first elijah
[10:25] when he spoke something he said
[10:27] it's not even
[10:29] not even dew will fall there's no rain
[10:31] until i call for it
[10:33] okay now he might have spoken that in a
[10:36] little hut beside a tree
[10:38] i'd have to go back and read to remind
[10:40] myself where he spoke it
[10:42] he might have spoken at just a few
[10:43] people
[10:44] but it affected the entire land
[10:48] this one man who's elijah he's a nobody
[10:51] elijah is a tishbite tishbite who's a
[10:52] dish bite never heard of this guy
[10:55] where did he come from
[10:57] but guess what
[10:58] his word was so powerful it stopped rain
[11:01] in the whole land
[11:03] you can't mess with god's word you can't
[11:04] mess with god's messengers
[11:06] and when he spoke that
[11:08] rain
[11:09] no rain all of a sudden everything
[11:10] stopped up a famine in the entire land
[11:12] people wonder sometimes what's going on
[11:15] in our world and so they read
[11:16] commentators they read the book of
[11:18] revelations they're reading this i'm
[11:20] trying to figure out prophecy i'm trying
[11:22] to figure out what's going on i can tell
[11:24] you safely tonight there's a lot going
[11:26] on in the world because elijah's word is
[11:29] already in the land and it's being
[11:30] fulfilled
[11:31] what he spoke in the last days 50 60
[11:34] years ago is an echo of his word for
[11:37] this last generation and a lot of the
[11:39] thing the famine for the hearing of the
[11:41] word a lot of the the tear down of
[11:44] america a lot of the the things we've
[11:45] been talking about sunday about the
[11:47] homosexual spirit and america falling
[11:50] away from truth and all these other
[11:51] things it's all it began to unravel when
[11:54] god gave mercy through his prophet and
[11:56] when there's when they reject his mercy
[11:58] then judgment follows we're living in an
[12:01] atmosphere and a lot of the trouble has
[12:04] come because elijah's word is in the
[12:08] land
[12:09] somebody say praise the lord
[12:11] you can look in the news all you want to
[12:13] but i can tell you everything's
[12:14] happening according to the word of god
[12:17] affected everybody
[12:19] and
[12:20] the no rain affected everybody and then
[12:22] elijah called for rain again and then he
[12:24] had the showdown boy i could go into
[12:25] elijah's life but i just want to make
[12:27] one point
[12:28] when he began to speak it affected
[12:31] everybody and guess what it made the
[12:33] jezebels mad
[12:37] i don't know what kind of woman she was
[12:39] before but when elijah spoke is when she
[12:42] become angry
[12:45] and the demons increased i don't know
[12:47] she might have been a nice person i
[12:48] don't know before that but it was
[12:50] elijah's word that triggered this
[12:53] vicious anger i'm gonna kill the man i'm
[12:55] going after him
[12:57] and actually elijah he just kind of went
[12:59] and hid a bit you know and uh but but
[13:02] that's what triggered is this anger
[13:03] that's coming up
[13:05] what's why why would the world council
[13:07] of churches and the union begin to start
[13:10] and begin to form a union of churches in
[13:12] christianity against the bride of jesus
[13:15] christ
[13:16] it's the jezebel spirit
[13:19] it becomes angry at the word
[13:22] of elijah
[13:23] is anybody with me here tonight
[13:26] there's a jezebel spirit it's in the
[13:28] book of revelations and it increases in
[13:30] anger i'm going to come against i'm
[13:31] going to kill this message i'm gonna
[13:33] destroy the influence of this message
[13:35] i'm gonna come against it what is it
[13:36] it's all satan and his demons who can't
[13:39] stand the word of elijah and he's coming
[13:41] against it if you believe it you're a
[13:43] target if you believe this message
[13:45] you're a target of the
[13:46] enemy you say well i don't i'm not
[13:48] living where i should be completely but
[13:50] i believe with all my heart i believe
[13:51] god's going to deliver me i believe i'm
[13:53] going to be a full matured adopted son
[13:55] of god i'm going to keep seeking the
[13:57] holy ghost i'm going to keep seeking him
[13:59] when you
[14:00] confess that you become satan's greatest
[14:03] target not because of you but because
[14:06] the word of elijah and the word of god
[14:08] you've taken it into your bosom i'm
[14:10] resting in his word
[14:12] you become a target
[14:15] a lot uh jezebel gets mad and so there's
[14:18] an increase in anger there's an increase
[14:19] in demons i've been talking about just
[14:21] the increase of uh homosexuality the
[14:24] increase in the last 50 years
[14:26] everything's increased anger has
[14:28] increased in the political world anger
[14:30] is increased in the person in the car
[14:31] next to you
[14:32] road rage has increased
[14:35] people giving you the finger
[14:37] people pulling out guns and shooting
[14:38] somebody because they went in front of
[14:41] them with their car
[14:42] chasing people anger has increased
[14:46] it's because the word of elijah is in
[14:48] the land now
[14:49] and judgment is in the land
[14:52] and demons increase
[14:54] their violent attack against the kingdom
[14:58] how many believe that we're in the
[14:59] kingdom tonight
[15:02] we're in the kingdom of god we believe
[15:04] the kingdom of god
[15:05] i don't care what you feel about
[15:06] yourself
[15:08] we believe the kingdom we're in the
[15:09] kingdom
[15:10] and there's a violent an increased
[15:13] violent attack
[15:15] against the kingdom of god and the
[15:16] people because jesus said he said don't
[15:19] look for it somewhere else the kingdom
[15:20] of god is within you
[15:22] where's the kingdom it's not out here in
[15:23] the air it's in the people i'm preaching
[15:25] to you tonight his kingdom is within you
[15:28] and there's a violent attack against you
[15:30] because you hold the kingdom there's a
[15:32] when when john the baptist spoke he said
[15:34] elijah spoke as soon as that happened
[15:37] there was a triggering of all the
[15:39] demonic realm and since then it's
[15:41] increased look at where we're at now 50
[15:43] 60 years past elijah speaking again in
[15:45] this generation and look how the demonic
[15:48] realm has increased plaguing people's
[15:50] minds placing not just sicknesses
[15:52] plaguing mind sickness of the mind why
[15:55] is it it's the enemy increasing his
[15:58] demonic forces against the elect
[16:02] now speaking the truth friends can you
[16:03] say amen
[16:05] but one of the reasons it increases is
[16:07] because elijah
[16:09] in his word once it goes in the land
[16:11] he knows
[16:12] he can't stop
[16:14] elijah's word from coming to pass
[16:17] and he knows
[16:19] it's going to come to pass
[16:21] you know why i think you know we got a
[16:23] scripture here that says
[16:25] since since the days of john the baptist
[16:27] until now the kingdom of heaven suffered
[16:29] violence
[16:30] i believe when you've had elijah's word
[16:32] in the land and you've had the people of
[16:35] god it's kind of like elijah and elisha
[16:37] because elisha was a type of the bride
[16:40] he said a double let a double portion of
[16:42] thy spirit come on me that's the type of
[16:43] the bride
[16:45] so when elijah comes then he goes off
[16:46] the scene god didn't go off the scene a
[16:48] double portion comes on the bride of
[16:50] jesus christ so you tell me is satan
[16:53] going to decrease when it comes in the
[16:54] bride no it's actually going to increase
[16:57] more because now we have this word not
[16:59] coming from one man in his voice in his
[17:01] mouth and a tape or a book
[17:04] now we have it for 50 60 years now the
[17:07] bride feeding on it and where's it going
[17:10] not in their head but in their soul
[17:14] no wonder the devil is fighting us so
[17:17] much
[17:19] no wonder the demonic realm has
[17:21] increased against your family
[17:24] now he's not just dealing with one man
[17:26] he's dealing with a mini-membered bride
[17:30] who for 50 years now is letting this
[17:32] word that has power in it go through
[17:34] them
[17:37] oh the devil don't like what i'm
[17:38] preaching tonight
[17:40] you think it's going to decrease when
[17:41] the bride gets it no now he's got i
[17:44] always like to say this you know he had
[17:46] 120 that come out of the upper room and
[17:49] uh
[17:50] satan was going you know what am i going
[17:51] to do with these because
[17:53] i had one to deal with in jesus
[17:55] and now i got 120 to deal with
[17:58] and then thousands of souls were saved
[18:00] and and this was multiplying by the hour
[18:03] and satan's going i had one to deal with
[18:04] i thought i put him in the ground he
[18:06] must be alive because the same spirit's
[18:08] in these people
[18:09] it's because when you plant that seed in
[18:11] the ground a crop is going to come up it
[18:13] was just a few days instead of one jesus
[18:15] to deal with
[18:17] instead of one jesus to deal with he had
[18:19] 120 jesus to deal with
[18:22] and within days he had thousands of
[18:24] jesus to deal with they took note they
[18:26] had been with jesus the world says these
[18:28] people they're like jesus we're going to
[18:30] start calling them christians which
[18:32] means partisans of christ followers of
[18:35] christ but it wasn't just they were
[18:36] followers of christ they could see the
[18:38] same works
[18:40] the same raising the dead
[18:42] the same walking in the shadow peter
[18:44] come in they come in the shadow of peter
[18:46] and someone come back out as a leper
[18:49] miracles took place where's jesus at now
[18:51] satan's having to deal with all kinds of
[18:54] i believe that demonic forces increase
[18:56] in a violent way against the kingdom
[18:58] when this bride gets a hold of the word
[19:03] powerful the
[19:04] power of elijah's word but the power of
[19:07] it being in a mini-member bride and
[19:10] satan doesn't like it because he's never
[19:12] been able to stop it
[19:14] i got an interesting scripture here
[19:16] second kings you can just
[19:18] second kings 10 and verse 8
[19:20] and this after the days of the original
[19:23] elijah this is way after
[19:25] gone on now and he how many knows elijah
[19:28] spoke he spoke doom for the house of
[19:31] ahab
[19:32] all right he spoke doom for the house
[19:34] ahab and they pronounced judgment they
[19:36] tried every way ahab and his sons
[19:39] lived
[19:41] for a
[19:42] certain amount of time
[19:43] even going way past elijah's ministry
[19:46] okay
[19:47] but guess what elijah spoke his word
[19:49] that's right
[19:50] okay so there's this war going to take
[19:52] place and this king asked certain was to
[19:54] do things come come down the line to
[19:56] verse 7 and said all the 70 of ahab's
[19:59] sons were killed
[20:01] and they're going what's what's going on
[20:03] and one fellow pipes up and says there's
[20:05] came a messenger totem saying they have
[20:07] brought the heads of the king's sons
[20:08] ahab's sons and he said lay them in two
[20:11] heaps at the entering of the gate until
[20:12] morning next verse and it came to pass
[20:14] in the morning that he went out and
[20:16] stood and said to all the people ye be
[20:18] righteous behold i conspired against my
[20:20] master and slew him but who
[20:23] who slew these seventy of ahab's son who
[20:27] did this i did so they who do this know
[20:30] now that there shall fall unto the earth
[20:33] nothing
[20:34] of the word of the lord which the lord
[20:36] spake concerning the house of ahab for
[20:38] the lord hath done that which he spake
[20:41] by his servant
[20:43] elijah
[20:45] even this guy says
[20:47] now i know why it happened because not
[20:49] one word of elijah will fall
[20:53] you might have to wait 50 years to see
[20:55] it fulfilled
[20:57] but not one word of elijah will fail
[21:01] and he had to acknowledge it he had to
[21:03] say why is this happening i killed one
[21:05] and now all of a sudden all these how
[21:07] did these get killed oh it's the word of
[21:09] elijah go back and read the spoken word
[21:11] book
[21:13] that's right
[21:14] go back and read the spoken word book
[21:15] elijah pronounced judgment on the whole
[21:17] house of ahab now we know why they're
[21:20] killed because not one word of elijah
[21:22] will fall short
[21:24] it'll happen
[21:26] it's happening now
[21:28] we're living in a world that elijah's
[21:30] word is being fulfilled can you say man
[21:32] god so trusted it god so used it and so
[21:35] let's just take a couple minutes and
[21:37] ponder this now
[21:40] let's ponder this
[21:42] this triggering point
[21:45] of as soon as elijah as soon as john the
[21:47] baptist
[21:49] as soon as his ministry went forth from
[21:51] that time
[21:53] from that time the kingdom of heaven
[21:55] suffereth violence
[21:57] and the violent take it by force i'm
[21:59] hoping just bring you a short message
[22:00] tonight
[22:01] and call this
[22:03] the days
[22:04] of a forceful response
[22:08] now i've mentioned a few things
[22:10] the last few sundays and and i humbly
[22:13] say them i don't say them to make
[22:15] anything better than anybody else but a
[22:18] lot of times people don't talk
[22:20] about convictions and principles when it
[22:22] comes to sexual temptation and we've
[22:24] been talking about those things a lot of
[22:26] people don't talk about them
[22:28] but i've tried to make the point that
[22:31] when you're living here in satan's eden
[22:35] and you're living in the manifestation
[22:37] of sodom and gomorrh the complete
[22:39] manifestation of it
[22:41] and you're raising children or you're a
[22:43] young person okay just think about it
[22:46] now if you know it's in the last
[22:49] thrust of satan with demonic power of
[22:52] sexual temptation nakedness
[22:55] homosexuality
[22:57] pornography all these things easily
[22:59] available then how should we be
[23:01] responding to that kind of onslaught of
[23:04] the enemy
[23:06] i tell you it'll take more than just
[23:08] laying back and saying i'm the bride of
[23:11] jesus christ praise god i go to church
[23:13] on sunday morning glory be to god i'm
[23:15] just going to live my life no
[23:17] i think if satan's kingdom increases a
[23:19] violent against us
[23:21] that's the days of a forceful response
[23:23] back from the people of god
[23:26] and that's what i said that's why i've
[23:29] said that people criticize a bit
[23:31] sometimes that we're too strict our
[23:33] church is too strict about courtship
[23:34] about dating we got all these guidelines
[23:36] and oh every time i turn around there's
[23:38] another rule i just ask you a question i
[23:40] don't want to become a legalist but how
[23:41] legal how how strong can you be to speak
[23:44] about these things to give our young
[23:46] people some boundaries
[23:48] why would we have loose boundaries in a
[23:50] day that's increased in sex such lustful
[23:53] sexual uh perversion can you say amen
[23:56] why am i being criticized for being too
[23:58] strict can we be too strict
[24:00] that's right and you'd have to say amen
[24:02] to that but can we be
[24:04] can we be to the place that we gotta
[24:07] we shut our mouths and just let them do
[24:09] and let them all work it out i'm sorry
[24:11] my friend i love them too much in this
[24:13] age and i know demons too much i'm gonna
[24:15] give them the word of god and practical
[24:18] things to live by so they can overcome
[24:20] in this age now if i was back in
[24:23] luther's day if i wasn't in the full
[24:25] manifestation of sodom and gomorrah then
[24:27] i may not preach on those things i might
[24:29] not give specific boundaries as far as a
[24:31] guy and girl and dating all that i may
[24:33] not talk about it but in this age under
[24:36] these modern conditions we got to talk
[24:38] about it according to the word of god
[24:40] because when the kingdom of heaven is
[24:42] suffering a violent attack
[24:45] the violent take it by force
[24:49] i got to get the kingdom
[24:51] i got to get a hold of it i got to give
[24:53] it to the young people
[24:55] and and as he said since that time the
[24:58] kingdom of heaven has preached and and
[25:00] those people press into it what's the
[25:02] other scripture
[25:04] he said the law and prophets were until
[25:06] and since that time the kingdom of
[25:07] heaven has preached and every man must
[25:10] press
[25:11] into it
[25:12] you're not going to get it by just a
[25:14] lazy
[25:15] you know lackadaisical kind of
[25:17] yeah okay i heard that before yeah
[25:19] no every man has to press into the
[25:21] kingdom of god
[25:23] it's a forceful response to the enemy
[25:26] it's it's satan it's it's a confession
[25:28] it's a forceful confession back he's
[25:30] talking to your mind and talking to your
[25:32] heart and beating you down there has to
[25:33] be a response to that devil speaking to
[25:35] you there has to be a forceful
[25:37] responsibility well i i just feel weak
[25:39] and i'll let the preachers do that i
[25:40] need to you know i'll tell you you can
[25:42] get enough strength that if you're not
[25:44] around a camp meeting you're not around
[25:46] a prayer line you don't have to wait
[25:48] till next year to the prayer line you
[25:50] get enough faith in your heart you can
[25:52] start confessing satan satan get out of
[25:54] here
[26:00] that's the kind of body of christ we
[26:02] need
[26:03] that every day
[26:04] we're given a forceful response
[26:07] an aggressive response
[26:10] to this enemy
[26:11] not a lazy response a four you know and
[26:15] there there's situations that come up
[26:17] sometimes
[26:18] that uh make us that should
[26:20] make us angry
[26:22] with the holy uh indignation towards the
[26:25] enemy
[26:26] not towards one another
[26:28] but towards the devil
[26:32] you know uh they press us into it right
[26:35] after the night that brother brandon
[26:37] preached in the morning the token
[26:39] he preached that night in desperation
[26:42] and i believe they're linked together
[26:46] here's the token here's the holy ghost
[26:49] the kingdom of god comes to us the token
[26:52] returns in the evening time how many god
[26:54] god brought the token in the evening
[26:55] time token was applied in the evening
[26:57] time
[26:59] creeds and dogmas had taken the spirit
[27:00] away from us but now in the time he's
[27:02] restored the spirit that the people can
[27:04] get the true holy ghost again but he
[27:07] preaches desperation because jacob when
[27:09] he had to get ahold of the he had to get
[27:10] a hold of something he had to wrestle
[27:12] with the angel
[27:14] you say oh lord the holy ghost is here
[27:16] just give it to me give it to me it's
[27:18] pressing into it by faith it's saying
[27:20] lord this was for me i want it i'll die
[27:23] my bones will be here until i get the
[27:24] real thing
[27:26] it needs an aggressive response to this
[27:28] enemy
[27:30] how many believe the enemy is aggressive
[27:32] he's relentless towards you
[27:34] he doesn't care about you
[27:36] he wants to take your family he wants to
[27:38] take your finances he wants to take
[27:40] everything precious to you and when he
[27:42] gets that aggressive it's time for us to
[27:44] be aggressive like i was this past week
[27:46] when the devil was trying to do
[27:48] something in my family and i said
[27:50] you can cry and i cried and i prayed but
[27:53] after a while you get angry at the devil
[27:55] and what he's doing and you start
[27:57] standing flat-footed and say no this is
[28:00] my family in the name of the lord jesus
[28:02] christ i claim
[28:03] satan you're not taking them
[28:06] this is the days of a forceful response
[28:10] it requires a forceful response
[28:13] not a lazy well i'm a believer and i've
[28:16] been to all the conventions no we got to
[28:18] stand in faith against this enemy
[28:20] he's relentless he's got a violent
[28:22] attack against this message and against
[28:24] us
[28:25] and so we have to hate to say it be a
[28:27] little bit violent back
[28:30] it's what the word said
[28:32] didn't he say it and the violent take
[28:35] the kingdom by force
[28:39] hallelujah
[28:41] a heart that's desperate will get the
[28:43] holy ghost can you say amen it's
[28:44] desperation like jacob said i'm not
[28:47] letting go of you angel i'm not letting
[28:50] go
[28:51] until you give me the blessing
[28:55] he wasn't sitting there saying
[28:57] i i'll see you in church next sunday see
[28:59] if we can get hopefully something will
[29:01] happen to me
[29:02] now he said i i got you in my tent
[29:05] tonight
[29:06] and he grabbed the hold of his thigh and
[29:08] he he wrestled with them and he said and
[29:10] the angel is trying to get out of there
[29:12] and he said no i'm not letting you go
[29:14] angel gets a bit irritated and he
[29:16] i said i'm he said i'm not gonna let you
[29:19] go i'm gripping onto this
[29:22] it was a battle it was a fight
[29:24] i'm holding on i'll tell you friends
[29:27] today when the presence of the lord
[29:28] comes in your home or comes in the
[29:30] church or comes in your car you ought to
[29:33] just pull over and say god i'm going to
[29:35] enjoy this presence we don't feel it
[29:37] that often i'm going to get a hold of it
[29:39] while i can get a hold of it
[29:42] the spirit of the lord is lifting from
[29:43] this earth and i'll tell you when we
[29:45] feel it and when it's doing things we
[29:47] ought to jump right in and say satan
[29:49] you're defeated in jesus name
[29:52] enjoy the presence of god take a hold of
[29:54] the presence of god
[29:56] say lord i'm glad to be in here tonight
[29:58] i'm glad to be feeling your presence
[30:01] god is good can you say amen
[30:04] praise the lord hallelujah
[30:07] hallelujah
[30:08] so now
[30:10] other things can be let me just move
[30:12] along here so that you know when we see
[30:15] these promises of god
[30:17] i just got mad at what the devil was
[30:19] doing
[30:20] i hated what the devil was doing and i
[30:22] cried out for god for a miracle for a
[30:24] defeat of satan
[30:26] and i tell you it's wonderful when he
[30:27] comes on the scene
[30:29] and he does it that's right
[30:31] but we have to
[30:32] it's sometimes
[30:34] sometimes we don't get fed up enough
[30:38] with the enemy
[30:40] and when we're not fed up with him we
[30:42] don't rise with a forceful response and
[30:45] he just walks over you every day
[30:48] because we're not fed up with them we're
[30:50] not angry enough about it
[30:52] don't get angry at people
[30:54] don't get angry at one another don't get
[30:55] angry at your husband
[30:57] get angry at the devil
[31:00] i give you permission
[31:02] you know us preachers we preach be nice
[31:04] to people be kind
[31:06] bring your anger to the lord don't let
[31:08] the sun go down on your wrath don't get
[31:11] angry and all and anger is bad except
[31:14] for i'm giving permission tonight
[31:17] get angry at the devil all you want to
[31:22] because some of you need to be angry at
[31:23] the devil
[31:26] you're not mad enough you're not angry
[31:28] enough
[31:31] so he's walking all over you sometimes
[31:33] because you're not mad enough at him
[31:36] trying to take your family time to take
[31:37] your marriage
[31:38] trying to take your joy
[31:40] you don't get mad enough about it
[31:43] you get angry about it can you say amen
[31:46] i be
[31:47] the times that we live in friends
[31:50] i wonder if we should stay mad at our
[31:52] enemy
[31:54] we preach against anger stay sweet stay
[31:56] loving
[31:57] but i wonder if that crosses over and
[31:59] how we treat our enemy who keeps robbing
[32:01] us and taking us things from us we get
[32:04] too lovey-dovey and accept things for
[32:06] life just i just accept it that we
[32:08] really things that we don't have to
[32:10] really accept can you say amen
[32:13] some problems we do as we spoke on
[32:15] sunday some problems we do and we we
[32:17] thank god for his grace but there are
[32:19] other things that we just say no i'm not
[32:21] going to let the devil walk all over me
[32:24] push him back
[32:25] get back
[32:28] stay back
[32:30] trying to get my granddaughter's
[32:31] attention because that's what she always
[32:33] says stay back
[32:35] ellie stay back
[32:38] stay back that's what we tell the devil
[32:40] stay back
[32:42] don't tell your parents that
[32:46] stay back
[32:47] devil stay back
[32:49] satan stay back
[32:51] bad thought comes to your mind stay back
[32:54] i'm a child of god
[32:56] you don't belong in my mind you don't
[32:58] belong in my heart you don't belong in
[33:00] my house you don't belong in my car can
[33:02] you say man nobody gave you permission
[33:04] to come around stay back
[33:08] stay back
[33:10] now i got her attention
[33:13] praise the lord you love the lord
[33:15] tonight
[33:17] and sometimes we just don't get fed up
[33:19] enough with the devil you know
[33:21] and uh we get angry at others people get
[33:24] angry at other people
[33:26] pretty easy
[33:28] but they're not angry at the devil
[33:31] people get easily angry at other people
[33:34] anger at their spouse
[33:36] there was a couple that that were
[33:38] working with financial counseling many
[33:40] years ago
[33:41] and the financial counselor showed them
[33:43] all the stuff they needed to do to get
[33:45] out of debt i think it was the dave
[33:46] ramsey program that he put him on it's a
[33:48] great program to get out of debt we
[33:50] might run some of those videos here
[33:52] maybe again this winter on another night
[33:54] those who want to look at it it's a it's
[33:56] a good thing and it has scriptural
[33:58] principles to it to help you get out of
[33:59] debt
[34:01] and uh so they were instructed but at
[34:02] the end of the counseling
[34:04] he he said this thing he says now the
[34:07] instruction was you'll never get out of
[34:09] this even with all the instructions
[34:10] you'll never get out of this unless you
[34:14] get mad at your debt
[34:19] unless you're really angry about being
[34:21] in the ditch and being in the hole that
[34:23] you're in financially
[34:25] you'll never get out
[34:27] you have to be fed up with yourself you
[34:29] have to be fed up with the condition you
[34:31] have to be fed up because debt is a load
[34:33] on you that's terrible debt is a bad
[34:35] thing but to get out it's more than just
[34:38] just taking a seminar it's more than
[34:40] psychology you have to be mad at the
[34:43] condition you're in and this counselor
[34:46] every time they met together he would
[34:48] say are you still angry
[34:51] are you still mad
[34:53] because if they lost their madness and
[34:55] their anger against the condition they
[34:57] were in they would never get out
[35:00] so part of his counseling i've never
[35:02] done this but it's i love it
[35:04] and i think i'll incorporate it in all
[35:05] my counseling and they come in the
[35:07] office are you i'm just gonna all right
[35:09] first of all are you angry at the devil
[35:11] that's beating you up
[35:13] are you angry what the devil's doing in
[35:15] your life and in your family's life
[35:17] because if you're not angry and you
[35:18] don't have the grit and the faith to get
[35:21] out you may not get out
[35:23] we've got the word it has power we got
[35:25] the support from the body of christ
[35:27] we've got the principles we've got the
[35:28] boundaries we've got we've got materials
[35:30] we've got scriptures we can hand it all
[35:33] to you but there has to be a faith to
[35:35] say i don't want to stay where i'm at i
[35:38] want to get victory over the enemy
[35:42] and i heard brother timothy preach that
[35:43] the last service i love it when they end
[35:45] the camp because it's not just getting a
[35:47] victory at camp it's what you're going
[35:48] to do to get victories at home can you
[35:50] say man it's about the victories every
[35:53] day and you have to be mad at the enemy
[35:55] when he's trying to take you over you
[35:58] have to be angry at your debt as he told
[36:00] the counselor told him but you have to
[36:02] be get angry in it can you say amen you
[36:04] have to get upset
[36:06] and i wonder if god desires us to just
[36:08] quit living on surges just surges of
[36:11] confidence every now and then and live
[36:14] in confidence all the time
[36:17] live standing against the enemy all the
[36:20] time god help us to grow that we stand
[36:22] every monday morning every tuesday
[36:24] morning i'm standing angry against the
[36:26] enemy and i'm standing with the word of
[36:28] god today i don't take vacations from
[36:31] this
[36:34] as i told you in a few services satan's
[36:36] not taking vacations from badgering you
[36:40] you don't take vacation the demonic
[36:42] realm doesn't it's actually it's alive
[36:45] more at night
[36:48] the prophet taught us that
[36:50] uh creatures of the night come out at
[36:52] night demons come out at night that's
[36:54] why depression gets worse at night
[36:57] it becomes dark so that lets us know
[37:00] the demonic realm
[37:02] does not
[37:04] go to sleep because it gets tired
[37:07] we do
[37:08] but the demonic round doesn't take a
[37:10] vacation doesn't take a rest it actually
[37:12] increases at night
[37:15] you better put on some good music
[37:19] you better pray you better not forget
[37:21] family altar with your family
[37:24] what if the devil comes with all those
[37:25] bad dreams and everything inflicting
[37:26] your children and all that what do you
[37:27] do you apply the token to the home say
[37:29] we're gonna pray together even if it's a
[37:31] prayer you got two year olds five year
[37:32] olds whatever the tensions man you can't
[37:34] read the whole seal book all night no

[37:37] gathering together here and the devil's
[37:39] gonna know and god's gonna know that
[37:41] we're binding together because
[37:43] whatsoever we bind on earth is bound in
[37:46] heaven
[37:47] everybody remember the commission to the
[37:49] church
[37:50] he said to the church
[37:52] whatever you bind on earth will be bind
[37:54] in heaven
[37:55] satan i bind any spirit that would try
[37:57] to bring my children bad dreams i bind
[37:59] any spirit that's trying to bring a bad
[38:01] spirit in my home he stops at the door
[38:03] here i apply the blood of jesus christ
[38:05] over this whole household tonight
[38:08] you see what i'm saying it's not a lazy
[38:10] response it's a forceful response i mean
[38:13] business with this devil if he's going
[38:15] to violently attack this kingdom i'm
[38:17] going to violently respond to him
[38:22] say well it's just not my nature to be
[38:24] that bold and everything i'm quieter
[38:26] nature
[38:27] it's all right i'm not i'm not trying to
[38:29] change your nature i'm just saying you
[38:31] have the same nature of god that i have
[38:37] and brother ram says faith
[38:39] has
[38:40] hairs on its chest
[38:44] so if you've got faith it has hairs on
[38:46] its chest it's bold your faith and god
[38:49] needs to be bold and that's not because
[38:51] you're a shy personality no no it's bold
[38:53] to say the quietest
[38:56] mouse christian
[38:58] can get hairs on its chest and faith
[39:01] and say satan depart in jesus name
[39:05] amen
[39:08] you see what we wait for everybody else
[39:10] to do it for us
[39:11] we wait to come to be prayed for which
[39:13] is fine we wait for the next camp
[39:14] meeting
[39:16] but in this hour you're going to have to
[39:18] be bold to reach in force for your
[39:21] victories
[39:22] sometimes when you're by yourself
[39:25] hallelujah praise the lord
[39:31] i remember when
[39:32] my daughter amariah stopped breathing
[39:34] she was only a few weeks old
[39:38] and i was upstairs because my wife was
[39:41] she was sick in the hospital salmonella
[39:43] and mri got salmonella
[39:45] she's only just a few weeks old and
[39:47] she's just she they brought her to the
[39:49] emergency room she was downstairs that
[39:50] flower right here she was downstairs at
[39:52] flower hospital
[39:53] and mri was in the emergency room
[39:56] laying there just just a preemie just a
[39:58] small little thing laying on that table
[40:00] and uh my mother-in-law had come in to
[40:02] help take care of her while becca was in
[40:04] the hospital i was upstairs seeing so i
[40:06] just slipped off upstairs i actually
[40:08] went in the bathroom upstairs and i just
[40:10] began to cry out to god because i felt
[40:12] that very spot that brother branham was
[40:14] in that i could lose both of them
[40:17] because my wife was was dying and then
[40:19] now it struck my she wasn't even strong
[40:21] enough to
[40:22] to come against us as little as she was
[40:24] this disease in her body and i just
[40:26] cried i said lord if you take him then i
[40:29] pray you'll give me the strength that
[40:30] you gave your prophet to lose his baby
[40:32] and lose his wife all the same time
[40:35] and i just cried out to god
[40:37] and then i went in to see my wife but my
[40:39] mother-in-law's testimony is that she
[40:41] watched and mariah stopped breathing
[40:43] there on the table she just stopped
[40:44] taking breaths
[40:46] and she rose up and she says satan i
[40:48] rebuke you in jesus name
[40:53] watch tamari take
[40:55] took a big breath like that
[40:59] [Applause]
[41:01] sometimes you get mad
[41:03] it's not a problem with that
[41:05] rise to the occasion
[41:08] the amari is here tonight by the grace
[41:10] of god serving the lord
[41:12] amen god's spirit of life
[41:14] [Applause]
[41:15] god spared her life for a purpose and
[41:17] you see but you see mama mama got a
[41:20] little upset at the devil at that point
[41:23] just a tad
[41:27] glory be to god i love him so much
[41:30] our god is real friends
[41:32] our god is real but we need a forceful
[41:34] response to the enemy sometimes
[41:36] a forceful response to the enemy and
[41:39] what he's doing
[41:40] amen so now from the time that john
[41:43] began to speak the word went into the
[41:45] land let me just skip some of this and
[41:47] bring it to a close
[41:49] praise the lord i just want to say that
[41:52] i believe
[41:53] that it was easier
[41:56] to get the full ceiling of the holy
[41:57] ghost back in many years before this
[42:00] age why is it harder today because
[42:03] there's so many distractions to it
[42:06] and people won't be desperate enough for
[42:08] it there's so many replacements
[42:11] for the holy ghost
[42:13] so many distractions to the young people
[42:16] so they have to press in to get it
[42:18] they have to be serious to get it can
[42:20] you say amen now god as some minister
[42:23] said god's not just standing back
[42:25] holding things back and teasing you or
[42:27] playing with it no god's more willing
[42:29] for you to have it
[42:31] than you are even desiring it
[42:33] so it's not god doing i'm talking about
[42:35] the age that we live in the spirits that
[42:37] everything is against you pressing on to
[42:40] more of god that he wants to keep you
[42:42] from doing that if you need the holy
[42:44] ghost if you need more joy if you need
[42:46] more love in your life if you need what
[42:48] calvary bought you're not going to get
[42:50] it easy can you say amen as i've said
[42:52] before my love of god comes easy in
[42:55] other words it's natural god put this
[42:56] love in me but if i want to stay in
[42:58] revival that's not easy in the time we
[43:00] live in because we live in a lukewarm
[43:02] age and because we live in lukewarmness
[43:05] it's always trying to take us over and
[43:07] so we fight against the lukewarmness
[43:09] my love comes natural for god but my
[43:12] revival i got to fight for it every day
[43:14] no i'm staying in revival
[43:18] get out of here satan i'm putting on
[43:20] some good holy ghost music in this house
[43:22] putting on some good holy ghost music in
[43:24] this car and when you get now for you're
[43:26] going to have some of the best holy
[43:27] ghost field music you had in a long time
[43:30] i'm enjoying listening to it and getting
[43:32] all the corrections made i can't wait to
[43:33] get it out because i'll tell you there's
[43:34] some anointed music that you're going to
[43:36] enjoy in your homes and your cars
[43:38] and your earbuds or whatever
[43:42] praise the lord your beats
[43:47] gideon wants some new beats for his
[43:49] birthday
[43:50] so i'm going to buy him a can of beets
[43:52] that's what i'm going to do
[43:53] that's the only beats i know of
[43:57] yeah
[43:58] i'd rather pass those out than the
[44:00] headphones any day
[44:02] i believe it's
[44:04] it's it's it was easier to get the full
[44:06] ceiling of the holy ghost many years ago
[44:08] today you got to really press in to get
[44:10] something from god you got to press in
[44:12] with prayer that's why we're praying
[44:13] every morning 7 30 every thursday
[44:15] morning together we're praying we're
[44:17] gathering in our homes anybody wants to
[44:19] come to church we're gathering because
[44:21] you have to what we're fighting against
[44:23] is not just a casual thing it's a
[44:25] violent attack
[44:27] so we're going to say satan we stand the
[44:29] blood of jesus christ stands against you
[44:32] we stand with it
[44:34] praise the lord the same it was easier
[44:36] luther's day see you could be burned at
[44:39] the stake back in those days this but
[44:41] the same relentless devil
[44:43] today that would burn the believers at
[44:45] the stake that was a pressure that was a
[44:47] pressure they went under but the same
[44:49] relentless devil has become high tech
[44:52] he would rather get you to stay home and
[44:54] just watch tv shows or something now
[44:57] luther never had to preach about that it
[44:58] was elijah this hour that says you stay
[45:00] home wednesday night and watch i love
[45:02] lucy luther never had to say that
[45:06] it's this age of lukewarmness it says
[45:08] we would choose to do something like
[45:10] that rather than listen the word of god
[45:12] so elijah had to say it why because
[45:14] we're in an all-out attack against the
[45:17] lukewarm spirit when the prophet of
[45:19] malachi 4 released to us the full
[45:21] restored word in the last days the
[45:23] kingdom begins suffering violent demons
[45:25] thus it would no longer be easy to get
[45:27] things from god that are truly ours we
[45:30] would have to press in to get it can you
[45:32] say amen
[45:34] and as i close this tonight i want to
[45:35] read a quote
[45:36] you guys don't have it up there but i'm
[45:38] going to read it there's one man in the
[45:39] bible that we can use in his example and
[45:42] you know who he is
[45:43] shamgar he got mad he lived in the time
[45:46] of judges and that was in the day after
[45:49] the great leader joshua came and then
[45:51] the days of judges and
[45:53] they had a huge revival under joshua
[45:56] and so then
[45:57] as time went on the people get a begin
[46:00] to get
[46:01] lacks the people in the days of judges
[46:03] they they begin to the revival spirits
[46:05] begin to go away and so then when they
[46:08] were not standing like they should the
[46:11] enemy started to come in and take things
[46:13] away take their fields take their crops
[46:16] take all their goods sometimes take
[46:18] their wives take their children and it
[46:20] wasn't like joshua's day when they were
[46:22] rushing towards the enemy now they got
[46:24] lacks a days ago now they they kind of
[46:26] lost the spirit of revival and they quit
[46:27] fighting back and when you quit fighting
[46:29] back satan just takes all he can take
[46:32] and in the days of judges that's what it
[46:34] says and remember all the judges all the
[46:37] judges if you read all of them deborah
[46:38] there was even a woman they weren't a
[46:40] prophet they were people that rised up
[46:43] uh samson and shamgar and and and
[46:46] deborah and these different ones it
[46:47] wasn't prophets or great people it was
[46:50] just believers actually the days of
[46:51] judges there was a few believers that
[46:53] got tired of the enemy
[46:56] and they rose up in the streak of god
[46:58] sometimes by themselves and said i'm
[47:01] tired of this
[47:03] the type of the bride
[47:05] because we won't have a national revival
[47:08] but we'll have individual revivals when
[47:10] somebody rises up in that sick bed or
[47:12] that little sick baby in that bedroom
[47:14] some mother rises up and says satan i
[47:16] rebuke you in the name of the lord jesus
[47:18] christ you're not going to take my child
[47:22] he said i think of old sham guard during
[47:24] the time of the judges over here in
[47:26] israel why he was over there and every
[47:28] man done right in his own eyes that's
[47:29] what it says about the days of judges
[47:31] that's how they got away from god
[47:32] everybody done what was right in their
[47:34] own eyes they got away from the prophet
[47:36] got away from joshua and every man did
[47:38] what was right in his own eyes i tell
[47:40] you what you do that we're in trouble
[47:42] and the philistines would come up and
[47:43] take all they had and go back with it
[47:45] israel would raise their crops and put
[47:47] it in the barn the philistines would
[47:49] walk right up and that's just like the
[47:51] devil to rob you of everything some of
[47:53] you pastors get your little church built
[47:56] up just about you where you think it's
[47:58] right and some old devil will come in
[48:00] there and say why there's no such thing
[48:02] there as the old holy ghost religion i
[48:04] don't even believe in that such that
[48:06] such a thing brother what i mean what i
[48:09] mean to tell you if you don't believe in
[48:11] getting angry then let your righteous
[48:13] ignition rise up that's right call black
[48:17] black and white white
[48:23] i see old shamgar standing there
[48:26] and he
[48:27] not very much was wrote about him in the
[48:29] bible but what was road is enough he was
[48:31] standing out there had his barns all
[48:33] fixed up and everything was going fine
[48:35] and he was standing there looking and
[48:37] thought well now maybe every year them
[48:39] philistines has come maybe they won't
[48:41] come this year and i see my family is
[48:43] all starving and they look so poor and
[48:46] thin
[48:47] and while he was standing there he heard
[48:48] a noise he raised up the window of his
[48:50] house and he looked down the road and
[48:52] here come those 600 armed philistines
[48:55] again they've been coming every year
[48:56] stealing the crop everything out of
[48:58] their barn doing all this stuff tramping
[49:00] down their land and here they come again
[49:02] he looks out the window here they come
[49:03] me he said here they are
[49:05] at trump he said with their spears and
[49:07] army the big old heavy feet there with
[49:10] armor on trump trump trump trump trained
[49:13] men warriors from birth spears in their
[49:15] hand swords hanging on their sides 600
[49:18] coming up shangar you had a nice crop
[49:22] this year
[49:24] we're glad you worked for us here they
[49:26] come up like that that's the way the
[49:28] devil does take everything you've got if
[49:30] you can that's him and shamgar looked at
[49:32] him and thought oh here it goes again he
[49:35] stood there and he thought well look
[49:37] down at this his poor little old wife
[49:39] little sunken face maybe in his little
[49:42] children they were hungry their little
[49:44] sleeves were ragged their clothes were
[49:46] gone his poor wife was starved to death
[49:49] what will the winter be this winter
[49:51] without their crop what's got the winter
[49:53] going to be like every year the devil
[49:55] came and stole it from them
[49:58] now year after year they've come and
[49:59] here they come again we've just about
[50:01] starved last year now they'll take what
[50:04] i've got now what will we do just what
[50:06] the gleanings i have out here in the
[50:08] field he stood there and he thought here
[50:10] here he come closer and closer trump
[50:12] trump here's the enemy coming
[50:15] closer
[50:16] closer
[50:18] closer the philistines coming and after
[50:20] a while
[50:22] see you don't believe in getting angry
[50:24] then let the righteous ignition rise
[50:28] and he began to feel it coming up on him
[50:36] shamgar began to feel it coming up on
[50:38] him and he said here
[50:41] i'm a jew
[50:43] i'm circumcised
[50:45] i've got a right
[50:47] for this long this land belongs
[50:50] to us
[50:53] and i tell you
[50:54] he wasn't a warrior he couldn't wait
[50:57] till he learned how to fight
[50:59] he was a farmer he wasn't a fighter but
[51:01] he knowed that the promise of god was
[51:04] with him and he was circumcised and if
[51:06] every man here tonight would realize
[51:09] that the things that the divine health
[51:11] and everything else god gave it to you
[51:14] at calvary every born-again man is
[51:16] circumcised by the holy ghost you have a
[51:18] right to every redemptive blessing let
[51:21] not the devil rob you from it anymore
[51:25] set grit to rise up that's that grit
[51:27] that just arrives that force rises and
[51:30] now wait a minute satan amen
[51:33] wait a minute
[51:36] i'm a circumcised holy ghost-filled
[51:38] believer
[51:39] and everything calvary bought for me
[51:41] belongs to me
[51:46] you're not going to rob me of any of it
[51:48] your brothers you think of changar's
[51:50] position
[51:51] and you think of you you receive inspira
[51:54] i pray you'll receive inspiration
[51:55] because it's the fathers and the heads
[51:57] of the homes and the men that really
[51:59] catch need to catch this more than any
[52:01] of them today
[52:02] you think of the inspiration that rising
[52:04] up the anger in shamgar that little
[52:06] farmer who didn't know how to go against
[52:08] 600 philistines
[52:11] but he did he grabbed an ox gold
[52:14] shamgar
[52:15] didn't have any sword he didn't know
[52:17] nothing about how to use one he didn't
[52:20] have a shield
[52:21] but if he'd had a shield he wouldn't
[52:23] have known how to use it but he reached
[52:24] up and he got an ox gold that's an old
[52:26] stick that's got a brass lump on the end
[52:29] of it they beat the ox through the coral
[52:31] with it and he jumped out of that window
[52:33] out there in the middle of that road
[52:35] against 600 armed philistines and killed
[52:40] every one of them
[52:41] hallelujah
[52:46] [Applause]
[52:50] that's my brother can you say man
[52:52] that's my brother shamgar
[52:54] and the sham guards need to rise up
[52:56] tonight
[52:57] and say that's devil that's enough
[53:00] jumped out of that window grabbed an
[53:01] oscar because that's the only thing he
[53:03] knew grabbed an ox goat that he used he
[53:05] he knew it for the cows all the cows and
[53:08] guided him the way but he grabbed that
[53:10] thing because that hard end on it
[53:12] jumped out in the street and killed six
[53:13] six
[53:14] a farmer
[53:17] because god could see his anger
[53:20] god could see his confession
[53:22] you think
[53:23] is this supernatural this is
[53:24] supernatural
[53:26] god put the supernatural in an ox code
[53:28] god put the supernatural in a man that
[53:29] was a farmer to go up against 600 men
[53:32] that had
[53:33] swords and shields
[53:35] trained
[53:36] servants my god is a mighty god
