[0:00] kind of what roles from one scripture to
[0:02] another so you're welcome to follow
[0:04] along in your bibles i
[0:06] i have been given a strict time frame
[0:08] sister julie so not to worry
[0:13] and
[0:14] you know i'm taking off my watch i see
[0:16] that i'm 15 minutes behind schedule here
[0:18] brother paul's want you to notice that
[0:20] um so
[0:22] little boy asked his mom what does it
[0:24] mean when the preacher takes off his
[0:25] watch and does that and she said
[0:27] absolutely nothing
[0:29] so
[0:30] at least if
[0:31] if i see something
[0:33] that's going to make me concerned it's
[0:35] when people are holding their watch up
[0:37] to the ear to hear if it's still ticking
[0:39] because things seem to be going slowly
[0:42] so i'll take that as a queue so uh we
[0:45] really appreciate uh being here this
[0:48] morning what i'm going to be doing is a
[0:50] little bit difficult um
[0:53] in uh less than four or five hours which
[0:56] is the parameters that i was given
[0:58] so
[1:02] so what i'm what i've done is i've
[1:04] broken it up quite extensively
[1:08] so the first part is going to be this
[1:10] keystone we're going to talk about the
[1:12] keystone um the next and we're going to
[1:15] talk about the arc today as well um
[1:18] we're going to start with that picture
[1:20] and then we get into the keystone
[1:22] but i'm also going to introduce you to
[1:24] the dna
[1:27] pattern that god laid out in in the dna
[1:30] now you know that that
[1:32] was really in the 1970s that they really
[1:35] made a good uh
[1:37] francis crick made a you know
[1:41] created the picture of the dna that you
[1:44] know the two strands that intertwine
[1:47] what i didn't realize is that there was
[1:50] a a gospel story
[1:52] in that dna structure very very critical
[1:55] uh to our understanding of scripture
[1:57] actually and then as you'll see as we
[2:00] just introduced that topic this morning
[2:02] but what i'd like to do with brother
[2:04] paul's permission and if you guys can
[2:06] stand it
[2:07] i notice a lot of people aren't here
[2:09] today because they heard it was coming
[2:12] so
[2:13] if if we can stand it out i might be
[2:15] able to come back and do the second part
[2:18] of this which will actually be about the
[2:21] dna and how that um how that
[2:24] is a natural picture of something we see
[2:27] in scripture so uh with that uh being
[2:30] said let's get started
[2:32] so
[2:32] in hebrews nine uh there's uh
[2:35] paul talks about the blood of bulls and
[2:37] goats and then in verse 14 he says how
[2:40] much more shall the blood of christ who
[2:43] through the eternal spirit offered
[2:44] himself without spot to god purge your
[2:47] conscience from dead works to serve the
[2:49] living god so if we take out that little
[2:51] explanation in the middle how much more
[2:53] shall the blood of christ purge your
[2:55] conscience from dead works to serve the
[2:58] living god
[3:00] so
[3:01] purging your conscience this is a a this
[3:05] is a scripture for all ages but is it
[3:07] more so for today the anxieties and the
[3:10] pressures and the the guilt and
[3:12] everything that is is laid on people
[3:15] today i mean if you don't wear a mask
[3:17] you're guilty of something you know i'm
[3:20] not saying that you shouldn't wear a
[3:21] mask or you should that's not the point
[3:22] the point is we're we're constantly
[3:25] being challenged by the by the woke
[3:28] people in the world about some other
[3:30] issue you know it's it's you don't even
[3:33] know that you're doing something and
[3:34] you're offending somebody and it's
[3:35] because you're made to feel guilty about
[3:38] so many things right and and everybody's
[3:41] virtue signaling everybody wants to be
[3:43] more virtuous than the other person in
[3:45] the culture and so this scripture
[3:48] is going into the base of belief and uh
[3:52] and sin and uh the fact that
[3:56] peter remember in the epistle he says
[3:58] that baptism even so does baptism save
[4:00] us not from the putting away of the
[4:02] filth of the flesh but of the answer of
[4:03] a good conscience toward god so you can
[4:06] see that this is obvious that there's
[4:08] that we have conscience paul said that
[4:10] even the even the sinners do by nature
[4:12] the things of god in other words our
[4:14] conscience so the blood of christ
[4:18] is central to this theme in other words
[4:21] you can't get anywhere if you don't go
[4:23] through the blood right so we have to
[4:25] have that purging of our conscience
[4:29] then in verse 15 he goes on and he says
[4:31] for this cause
[4:34] and this is so direct
[4:35] for this cause he is the mediator of the
[4:39] new testament that by means of death for
[4:42] the redemption of the transgressions
[4:43] that were under the first testament
[4:45] anytime you see the first testament or
[4:47] the old testament will be in red
[4:49] anytime you see the new testament will
[4:51] be in blue so you can keep that cue
[4:53] going so
[4:55] the redemption of the transgressions
[4:56] that were under the first testament they
[4:58] are called that they which are called
[5:01] might receive the promise of eternal
[5:04] inheritance so he ties the blood the
[5:07] good conscience the mediator between the
[5:10] new and the old testament for those who
[5:12] are the called who then are eligible for
[5:15] this promise of eternal inheritance so
[5:18] you can see that paul's tying this all
[5:20] together and the important thing that i
[5:23] want you to take away from today's
[5:25] service is
[5:26] the old and the new testament in order
[5:29] to fully
[5:31] commune with god you have to be able to
[5:34] commune through the old and the new
[5:36] testament you you have to see how they
[5:38] come together so when teachers start
[5:41] talking about this type or that shadow
[5:43] or this principle from the old testament
[5:46] it's not just
[5:48] interesting
[5:49] it's critical to our ability to commune
[5:53] with god because he's communing with us
[5:55] through his word his spirit on his word
[5:57] is the way god talks to us so if we
[5:59] can't bring all the
[6:02] the the the word of god together make it
[6:06] fit
[6:07] we can't really commune with god so um
[6:10] if somebody says to me why was jesus
[6:13] baptized
[6:14] and and i say well it's because there
[6:17] was a there was a commandment in the old
[6:19] not a commandment there was a principle
[6:21] in the old testament that required that
[6:24] the high priest is washed
[6:26] and that the blood was put on his ear
[6:28] his thumb and his toe and that he would
[6:30] be anointed with oil all right and by
[6:33] the prophet
[6:34] so when jesus went to get baptized and
[6:36] john snow i need to be baptized of you
[6:39] and jesus says no it becomes us to
[6:41] fulfill all righteousness
[6:43] righteousness to a jew is the law
[6:45] and so
[6:47] john does the sort of heal to the you
[6:50] know foreign uh response of course and
[6:53] he baptizes jesus without further
[6:55] argument because he knew is that
[6:57] leviticus 8 has the story of when moses
[7:01] prepared aaron to be the high priest and
[7:04] he baptized he washed him he
[7:07] took
[7:08] the anointing oil and poured it on him
[7:10] he took the blood from the sacrifice put
[7:12] it on his ear his thumb and his toe and
[7:14] that absolutely represented what
[7:15] happened to jesus he was baptized and
[7:18] then of course he was the holy spirit
[7:20] came down his anointing and then at
[7:21] calvary uh the crown of thorns with
[7:24] blood on his ear his hands and his feet
[7:26] were nailed and so that
[7:29] requirement for a high priest was
[7:31] fulfilled so when the scripture says
[7:34] that he's the mediator of the new
[7:37] testament that by his death redemption
[7:39] sins under the first testament the old
[7:41] testament they which are the called
[7:43] might receive the promise of eternal so
[7:45] jesus didn't come
[7:47] and set up a new system
[7:50] that didn't bear any resemblance to the
[7:52] past on the contrary he was absolutely
[7:55] following the pattern that was laid out
[7:58] in the altar and if he hadn't he
[7:59] wouldn't be the mediator he wouldn't be
[8:01] the crowd now i i'll get to this word
[8:04] mediator
[8:05] so a mediator is one who intervenes
[8:08] between two
[8:10] either in order to make or restore peace
[8:13] or for ratifying a covenant and we'll
[8:16] see a scripture in a minute that speaks
[8:18] to this a mediator is a medium of
[8:20] communication an arbitrator so when we
[8:23] look to christ when we look to the one
[8:26] who's the mediator between the old and
[8:29] the new testament that ability for us to
[8:32] see how that measures together is a
[8:35] medium of communication it's a way for
[8:38] us to have the word speak to us in a
[8:41] very special way
[8:43] right so
[8:45] galatians chapter 3 verse 24 says
[8:47] wherefore the law
[8:49] was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
[8:51] christ that we might be justified by
[8:53] faith what is a school master in this
[8:55] context it's a tutor but especially it's
[8:58] a guardian and a guide for boys
[9:03] so in other words as we're growing in
[9:05] maturity in the word it's helpful for us
[9:09] to have a tutor
[9:11] and who's the tutor well ultimately it's
[9:14] the holy spirit but it's the holy spirit
[9:16] through the old testament that's
[9:18] bringing us to when i've done bible
[9:20] studies
[9:21] in revelation and which i've done for
[9:23] years and years
[9:24] sometimes that's how long it took uh
[9:26] just for a couple of chapters um just so
[9:29] you know in four hours you know it's a
[9:30] bit of a constraint
[9:32] so
[9:33] when when i did that what i found was
[9:36] that so many people had no background
[9:39] if i wanted to talk about joseph as a
[9:41] type or moses as a type or elijah and
[9:43] elisha
[9:45] they didn't know those stories they
[9:47] didn't go to sunday school and so i saw
[9:50] um sister elizabeth this morning with
[9:52] the
[9:54] barbel story arthur maxwell's bible
[9:56] story series and i highly recommend that
[9:58] if you're looking for back thank you
[10:00] she's holding it up
[10:02] so um i highly recommend that it's what
[10:05] i grew up on as a child
[10:07] my my folks bought one of those every
[10:09] every month and it was just it was just
[10:12] so wonderful uh to get that foundation
[10:15] and
[10:16] that's what people need they need that
[10:18] foundation in the old testament because
[10:19] that's the school master to bring us to
[10:22] christ
[10:24] all right
[10:25] so
[10:29] and obviously that's as you're learning
[10:32] the scripture as you mature
[10:35] all right now you're no longer needing
[10:38] as much of that old testament
[10:41] understanding what you need now is the
[10:44] mediator to bring those two things
[10:46] together to be in the new testament but
[10:49] with that background with that and now
[10:51] you can stand on your own feet so paul
[10:53] talks about the milk of the word versus
[10:55] the meat of the word so you can see how
[10:57] this is tying together now in galatians
[11:00] chapter 3 verse 17 and this i say that
[11:02] the covenant that was confirmed before
[11:05] of god in christ so christ confirmed the
[11:08] covenant that was made to abraham
[11:11] about a promised son that was christ
[11:13] christ confirmed the covenant and even
[11:17] though there was
[11:18] 430 years from abraham until
[11:22] isaac was born
[11:23] because remember they went through the
[11:25] the the
[11:27] period of captivity if you like in egypt
[11:31] with the law which was 430 years after
[11:34] remember the law came during their
[11:36] travels to the promised land cannot disa
[11:38] null that it should make the promise of
[11:41] effect
[11:42] so john chapter 6 63 says the words that
[11:46] are speaking to you they are spirit and
[11:48] they are life
[11:49] you see that was jesus ministry at least
[11:53] um in his three and a half year ministry
[11:55] ultimately it was to die on calvary but
[11:58] in that three and a half years that
[12:00] wasn't you know kind of just a allow you
[12:03] know between baptism and death that was
[12:06] a very important time when jesus was
[12:09] actually bringing
[12:10] those old testament principles to life
[12:13] he was actually he says the words that i
[12:16] speak to you they are spirit and life in
[12:19] other words i'm going to put life into
[12:22] that old doctrine that you heard i'm
[12:24] gonna make it make sense to you and you
[12:26] remember when the disciples were on the
[12:28] road to mass and they and they they he
[12:30] stopped and he opened the scriptures
[12:33] and he went through all the scriptures
[12:36] concerning who he was
[12:38] that made all the difference up until
[12:40] that point the disciples with all due
[12:43] respect and maybe the sermon won't make
[12:46] it to heaven but uh
[12:48] they didn't know what was going on
[12:52] they were a little bit clueless
[12:54] all right and their expectations were
[12:56] all over the board from you know judas
[12:59] who wanted a insurrection to peter who
[13:01] wanted to cut off people's ears and he
[13:03] was going to be a soldier i mean they
[13:05] were all over the board right and jesus
[13:08] had to rebuke them and but once the holy
[13:10] spirit came but it's all different right
[13:13] now they're able to
[13:16] understand what it is that jesus really
[13:19] came to do and so that's what jesus was
[13:22] setting the scene for and saying that
[13:25] the words that i speak unto you they are
[13:27] spirit and they are life and just uh
[13:30] just so you understand this word life is
[13:32] that word zoe so you hear brother
[13:35] branham talk about zoe life the that's
[13:37] the literal life of god right so literal
[13:41] life tabernacle i thought it's a good
[13:42] place to put that in brother paul and so
[13:45] zoe is that kind of life and it's not
[13:49] just any life it's this supernatural
[13:53] life
[13:54] so in the natural we also have
[13:58] uh something that illustrates life the
[14:00] that's the that's the program of life or
[14:03] the language of life and that's the dna
[14:06] it controls every living cell when we
[14:09] allow the bible to control our lives
[14:11] then the word of god is the language of
[14:13] eternal life so you can see how
[14:16] important it is because you notice
[14:18] there's two strands in in the dna you
[14:22] have to have the old and the new
[14:23] testament and you have to have what's in
[14:26] between so
[14:28] this this will be what we get into next
[14:30] time why are there four gospels
[14:32] they all tell the same story of jesus
[14:35] but each one gives a slightly different
[14:37] viewpoint but all pertain to eternal
[14:40] life in christ i i'm reading that and
[14:43] it's on the screen but i want you to to
[14:45] think about telling the same story so
[14:48] brother branham says unless you can see
[14:50] jesus in every page of the bible you
[14:51] miss him and go back to it again but
[14:53] it's because it's all telling the same
[14:55] story and i'll give you an illustration
[14:56] of that as we rush through here 15
[14:58] minutes in by the way for those that are
[15:00] watching
[15:01] so the um
[15:04] the illustration
[15:06] that
[15:07] kind of makes the best sense to me
[15:10] um is that we're
[15:12] we're always
[15:14] um
[15:14] [Music]
[15:16] aware of the fact that there is a seed
[15:19] gene these are words that are common to
[15:21] us but when you understand that dna
[15:25] is the building is the is the program
[15:28] that actually creates the body
[15:32] does it make sense every seed is given
[15:34] its own body if i can put it this way
[15:37] every dna will create its own body
[15:40] all right and we are that body
[15:43] so what's the program of life where does
[15:46] this eternal life come from well it
[15:48] doesn't just magically appear it comes
[15:51] from the fact that we're attributes of
[15:53] god we were the dna of god and if i can
[15:56] put it just quickly in this way we'll
[15:59] get more into this but god has human
[16:03] attributes as well as divine attributes
[16:07] all right and but it's all part of god
[16:09] so when we look at ourselves in the
[16:12] context of being part of god we that dna
[16:17] that is made making his body was in god
[16:20] to begin with it's part of god so the
[16:23] human expression of the divine life was
[16:27] part of god's plan from the beginning
[16:29] adam and evil the prime example
[16:31] all right expressing his life all right
[16:35] in a human form that didn't come out of
[16:38] nowhere now god's not part animal
[16:41] but god is part human if i can put it
[16:44] that way or
[16:45] rather humans are part god
[16:50] quite a quite a thought isn't it but
[16:52] that um that the dna helps us to
[16:55] understand that and you say well what
[16:57] did brother branham say about dna
[16:59] well
[17:00] i don't know if this quote is about dna
[17:03] or not i like to think it is
[17:06] i don't know what else it could be
[17:08] but brother branham says in perseverance
[17:10] in 1963 he says two little strings the
[17:14] new and the old testament holding jesus
[17:17] between them
[17:18] [Music]
[17:20] and that's not dna i don't know what it
[17:22] is i'm open to suggestions but that
[17:25] strikes me as being
[17:27] something that brother branham saw
[17:30] in in a in a macroscopic level that
[17:33] wasn't discovered yet
[17:34] that i know of
[17:36] so if if it was discovered then then he
[17:39] was led to read about that discovery but
[17:41] as far as i know it was the 1970s so
[17:44] let's uh let's look at this um in terms
[17:46] of the four ministries of christ the the
[17:49] uh four gospels uh so let the left hand
[17:51] uh curly bit be the
[17:53] uh the red bit be the old testament and
[17:55] the right hand curly bit that's the
[17:57] that's the new testament so that's
[18:00] setting the scene for next time so if
[18:03] you're curious about that please come
[18:04] back
[18:06] and tell your friends
[18:09] so the ministry of jesus this is where i
[18:11] was my title the link between the
[18:13] testaments the link between the
[18:15] testament is jesus and his ministry
[18:17] obviously comes between the new and the
[18:19] old testament so he is that link that
[18:23] ties the old and the new testament
[18:25] together and and paul says in ephesians
[18:28] chapter 2 verse 16 that he might
[18:31] reconcile remember he's the mediator
[18:32] he's between the two the two pieces
[18:35] right just like the dna just like the
[18:37] old and the new testament that he might
[18:39] reconcile both and to god in one body by
[18:43] the cross so remember he was talking
[18:46] about jew and
[18:47] and gentile in the middle wall of
[18:49] petition and so forth so for the jews it
[18:51] was the old testament now they have the
[18:53] new testament church but the cross of
[18:55] calvary jesus holds that together and
[18:58] that's why it's in the middle that's why
[19:00] there's four gospels we'll
[19:02] talk about that later and paul just
[19:05] makes us super clear to the corinthians
[19:07] he says for i've determined not to know
[19:09] anything among you save jesus christ and
[19:12] him crucified because that's the
[19:14] starting point that's where the old and
[19:17] the new testament come together where
[19:19] everything in the old testament now
[19:21] starts to make sense so brother branham
[19:23] says this in 1965 in december 1965
[19:26] obviously a famous uh
[19:29] service in in the rapture jesus was the
[19:32] keystone between the old and the new
[19:34] testament because he had to first die
[19:36] and then be raptured he died came to
[19:38] life walked around here with us and then
[19:40] was raptured up because he was the key
[19:43] stone that tied the two together
[19:47] so let's look at an old testament
[19:49] example so i've talked about it but now
[19:51] i want to actually show you how this
[19:53] works
[19:54] so
[19:55] i was so pleased because
[19:58] when you have
[20:00] 178 slides on a subject and you're only
[20:03] allowed to use 30 or something you you
[20:06] begin to wonder if you've got the right
[20:07] ones because you know i'm going you're
[20:09] going to go back to the crooks house
[20:11] after this with a pool
[20:13] you know i wanted to make sure at least
[20:15] i got some supper i wasn't sent to bid
[20:17] without any supper so
[20:19] i had to make some adjustments
[20:21] all right
[20:22] so
[20:25] so
[20:26] sister julie was at the family camp in
[20:28] 19
[20:29] 2001 where i preached a one hour sermon
[20:34] in three hours
[20:36] and the food went cold and it was a
[20:39] nightmare for the folk in the kitchen
[20:41] and sister julie has a long memory so
[20:46] so i i i'm under orders
[20:49] so this is the uh the what's called the
[20:51] ark of the testament or the ark of the
[20:53] covenant let's read about it exodus
[20:55] chapter 25 verse 22 and there i will
[20:58] meet you
[20:59] and i'll commune with thee remember i
[21:02] said we have to have the old and the new
[21:03] testament talking to each other
[21:05] understandably linked so that we can
[21:08] talk to god that god can talk to us
[21:11] our communion with god is in both
[21:14] testaments why do we have two ears
[21:18] all right old testament new testament
[21:21] so you can see and then let this mind be
[21:23] in you that was also in christ so we
[21:26] have to be able to take that old
[21:28] testament and and unite it seamlessly
[21:32] with the new testament just by the way
[21:35] paul
[21:36] what was paul's job in the natural
[21:40] what did paul do other than preach
[21:43] tent maker
[21:45] what's a tent maker good at
[21:48] sewing panels of canvas together
[21:51] all right and if a tent is gonna leak
[21:54] where is it gonna leak
[21:55] it's gonna leak at the seams
[21:57] if the seams aren't done correctly
[22:00] it's going to leak through those
[22:01] loopholes right in the where the two
[22:04] seams come together so for paul to be an
[22:07] excellent tent maker meant he was very
[22:09] good at sewing two pieces of fabric
[22:11] together so they didn't leak
[22:14] and we don't want our knowledge of the
[22:17] old testament and the new testament to
[22:19] leak
[22:20] all right we need it to be tightly held
[22:22] together properly properly positioned so
[22:25] that it can perform its function and
[22:28] that's what the two
[22:30] uh parts communing together it why it's
[22:33] so important and he says that he will
[22:35] commune with thee from above the mercy
[22:38] seat from between the two cherubims
[22:40] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[22:42] so he's going to commune with us from
[22:45] between the two cherubim
[22:48] okay so hold that thought
[22:51] so
[22:53] in hebrews chapter 9 paul's saying this
[22:56] and after the second veil going through
[22:59] into the holy of holies the ark of the
[23:02] covenant which was a figure for the time
[23:05] then present
[23:07] it was representing something else
[23:10] it wasn't just about
[23:12] the ark and the tablets of stone and
[23:15] aaron's rod that budded it was more than
[23:17] that the showbread it was more than that
[23:21] it was a symbol of something that was
[23:23] coming it was it was a figure for that
[23:27] time
[23:28] so why don't we have an ark up here
[23:30] brother paul i mean isn't this supposed
[23:32] to be like the holy of holies well we do
[23:35] have it
[23:36] it's called our bible
[23:38] it's the old and the new testament
[23:41] and you can't fly with one wing
[23:44] you fly with one ring you go around in
[23:46] circles
[23:48] that's what happens to a lot of people
[23:51] when they when they emphasize one
[23:53] testament over the other they're a bit
[23:55] lopsided and they go around in circles
[23:58] so we need to have a balance in the word
[24:00] and that's because we understand because
[24:02] as school master prepared us properly to
[24:05] understand the new testament now we can
[24:07] put forth our wings as eagles
[24:11] and run and not be weary
[24:14] amen
[24:15] all right sorry so exodus chapter 25
[24:18] verse 20 and 21 and the cherubim shall
[24:21] stretch forth their wings on high
[24:23] covering the mercy seat with their wings
[24:25] and their faces shall look one to
[24:27] another toward the mercy seat shall the
[24:29] faces of the cherubim be so i was saying
[24:33] i was felt confident to go down this
[24:35] road this morning when i went into
[24:37] brother paul's uh office and he has a
[24:39] actual model of the ark and it's and
[24:42] it's a very good model they're not all
[24:44] so good but if you look at that picture
[24:46] it's very similar to the ark that
[24:49] brother paul has
[24:50] on his uh in his office so it's
[24:53] wonderful but the point that i'm going
[24:55] to bring you to today that's important
[24:58] is that their faces shall look one to
[25:00] another
[25:02] so brother branham says
[25:04] put down in between the arch of the
[25:07] wings of these cherubim was a
[25:09] supernatural light hanging in there
[25:11] which was the halo of god that lit the
[25:14] whole room so where was christ
[25:18] in
[25:19] the in the holy place
[25:21] just a a pillar of fire just you know we
[25:24] sometimes see the pictures in the books
[25:25] you know the tall pillar of fire coming
[25:28] out of the top of the of the of the um
[25:30] sister loretta it's lovely to see you i
[25:32] didn't see you over there god bless you
[25:34] mo you see um brother branham had an
[25:37] angel you know that was with him all the
[25:39] time and so i'm really glad when kathy
[25:41] comes because then i've got my angel
[25:42] with me so thank you very much but so
[25:46] but kathy's shining so brightly i didn't
[25:48] see sister loretta so lovely to see you
[25:50] sister loretta
[25:52] so
[25:54] it's not necessarily that big pillar of
[25:56] fire that we see in the pictures where
[25:58] brother branham calls that halo the
[26:00] pillar of fire
[26:02] and it's between the wings of the
[26:04] cherubim it's on it's in the space in
[26:07] between the two cherubim that's
[26:11] important
[26:12] so let's uh picture ourselves walking
[26:14] into the holy of holies it's a bit dimly
[26:18] lit until obviously the spirit of god
[26:20] comes in and brother random says between
[26:23] the arch of the wings of this chairman
[26:24] was a supernatural light
[26:26] could it be the same supernatural light
[26:28] that we see in the photograph that's the
[26:30] way i've represented it who knows
[26:33] so
[26:34] obviously this whole
[26:36] um
[26:38] box
[26:39] is the ark and then between the wings is
[26:42] the mercy seat that we just read about
[26:46] and then you have the two cherub on
[26:48] either side cherubim it's funny i don't
[26:51] understand the plural brother rap maybe
[26:53] you you understand that so cherub is
[26:56] singular cherubim is plural but in the
[26:58] bible they're always called cherubims
[27:01] so i'm confused so anyway i just think
[27:03] they're cherubs i don't know if that's
[27:05] right or maybe they are actually
[27:07] cherubim and then of course one can be
[27:10] representing the old testament the other
[27:12] one can be representing the new
[27:14] testament and what's in between is
[27:17] christ
[27:18] and it's in the form of the four gospels
[27:20] that come between the old and the new
[27:23] can you see that picture all right so
[27:26] let's look at this idea that their faces
[27:29] shall look one to another
[27:32] all right
[27:33] what does that mean
[27:35] they're seeing eye to eye
[27:38] all right they're looking at each other
[27:40] and if you want to
[27:42] put it this way you can say they're in
[27:44] agreement
[27:46] you know if you say i see eye to eye
[27:48] with this brother it means we're in
[27:50] agreement
[27:51] so that old and the new testament were
[27:53] never
[27:54] supposed to be opposing forces they were
[27:57] never supposed to be oh that's the old
[27:59] testament this is the new testament
[28:03] you understand they're in a complete
[28:05] agreement if you don't see that
[28:07] agreement you've missed something
[28:10] because you haven't been to the school
[28:12] master
[28:13] you haven't had the training and the
[28:15] teaching that you need to understand how
[28:17] the old testament and the new testament
[28:20] comes together i told you about those
[28:21] revelation bible studies that i did the
[28:24] first three chapters of revelation and
[28:26] two years every tuesday night for about
[28:28] two hours okay just so you know four
[28:31] hours is is quite a stretch for me all
[28:34] right to fit everything in four hours um
[28:36] so you know two hours on a wednesday or
[28:39] tuesday night was also hard
[28:41] but the thing that i was so blessed
[28:45] by is the pentecostal couple that
[28:47] started coming uh they uh he said to me
[28:51] he said after eight or nine months of
[28:53] these bible studies he said i've learned
[28:55] more in these eight months then i've
[28:57] learned eight years in my church
[29:01] because we were tying the old and the
[29:03] new testament together and i will tell
[29:05] you it's very satisfying
[29:07] it's very satisfying because
[29:09] in our heart of hearts we know they
[29:11] should be in agreement we know they
[29:13] should be talking to each other and we
[29:15] know that our means of communication is
[29:18] through their agreement
[29:20] we're able to come to christ because
[29:22] these two
[29:23] testaments are in agreement okay amen so
[29:27] the old testament example of the two
[29:29] cherubims see
[29:31] above the ark represents the new and the
[29:33] old testament that agree with each other
[29:35] as the old testament is the shadow or
[29:37] outline of the new testament
[29:39] there's a key right there
[29:41] all right so thinking of old testament
[29:44] faith old testament faith now we're at
[29:46] half an hour okay old testament faith is
[29:50] the physical restricted promised land
[29:53] that was given to abraham by god that
[29:56] was their promised land
[29:58] what is our promised land we'll get to
[30:01] that
[30:03] when they were called on to fight for
[30:05] every foot on which every step of which
[30:08] every
[30:10] uh what is the scripture every step on
[30:12] which your foot shall tread something
[30:14] sorry but for every step that they took
[30:16] they had to fight for that ground though
[30:19] it was promised to them they had to take
[30:21] it
[30:21] they that god wasn't just going to
[30:23] deliver to them on a platter they had to
[30:25] fight for it and they fought as humans
[30:27] they fought with natural swords now of
[30:29] course can god supernaturally do
[30:31] something he did it many times for them
[30:33] but nevertheless the overall principle
[30:35] was they were fighting for every inch of
[30:37] ground that they were taking and
[30:41] they
[30:42] hated those who killed them so if
[30:45] somebody killed some one of them they
[30:46] went and retaliated and wiped out a
[30:48] whole village because that was the way
[30:51] it worked back then
[30:53] and
[30:54] if you were to be blessed in the old
[30:56] testament like job or abraham you were
[30:59] blessed in natural material things
[31:02] remember job when he came through his
[31:04] trials he got double what he had lost
[31:07] all right god the bible says he was
[31:09] restored double what he had lost and
[31:12] that was the sign that he had come
[31:14] through the the trial with flying colors
[31:17] because in the physical realm he got
[31:19] twice as many you say well uh-huh
[31:21] brother stephen i know that story
[31:24] he got the same number of children back
[31:26] he didn't get twice as many children but
[31:28] remember the other children
[31:31] job was making sacrifice for them they
[31:32] were already
[31:34] in heaven so he did get double because
[31:37] he now had twice as many children
[31:39] because they were already in heaven
[31:41] right so it still works okay so that's
[31:44] the material world of the old testament
[31:48] now let's look at it in terms of the new
[31:50] testament
[31:52] the promise is the holy spirit
[31:55] that's what our promises we're going we
[31:58] are promised the holy spirit and to you
[32:00] and to your children all those that are
[32:02] afar off
[32:04] and our land is to live by every word
[32:06] that's written in the bible the member
[32:09] of israel
[32:10] that was promised
[32:12] was boarded on all four sides by water
[32:15] from the river euphrates to the north to
[32:17] the river of egypt which is wadi
[32:19] al-irish to the south and of course the
[32:22] jordan uh to the uh let's see the east
[32:26] and the mediterranean to the west
[32:28] and so that was the natural boundaries
[32:31] of the promised land uh that was that
[32:33] was promised to to abraham and what are
[32:36] our boundaries it's still the word all
[32:38] right but what happens when the word
[32:40] drives up that's when those
[32:46] 100 million are contributing the number
[32:48] 200 million demons
[32:50] are released from their river euphrates
[32:52] it's when the word dries up that's when
[32:54] those demons are released
[32:56] okay so that's a just
[32:59] a thought to be to be thinking about so
[33:01] the word is our promised land and of
[33:03] course now we're saved as individuals
[33:05] not as a nation and it's by grace
[33:08] not by the law so that god can guide us
[33:11] and use us for his will rather than
[33:14] having us pursue our own will so in the
[33:16] old testament
[33:17] they were given the ability to pursue it
[33:20] in their own will they were given the
[33:22] power they were given the knowledge they
[33:23] were given the instruction to take the
[33:25] land
[33:26] all right but we have to relinquish our
[33:29] will and yield our will to god which
[33:32] jesus illustrated and mary illustrated
[33:35] not you know be it unto me according to
[33:37] that will and jesus said not my will be
[33:39] done but that and so now we're seeing
[33:41] jesus as the mediator between the old
[33:44] and the new testament showing us the
[33:46] change in the transition from the old to
[33:49] the new and this is just one example so
[33:52] the physical realm is no longer the main
[33:55] aim
[33:56] all right our main aim is to get ready
[33:58] for the coming of the lord all right
[34:01] and we have no natural enemies that we
[34:04] need to be concerned about because we
[34:06] fight against sin and error we don't
[34:08] fight against human beings
[34:10] if you're targeting a human being you're
[34:13] missing the mark that's not the target
[34:15] what i have done in the past when
[34:17] somebody's really in my face and being
[34:20] rude and aggressive i look to the right
[34:22] of him just to his shoulder
[34:25] and i can and i say in my mind i can see
[34:27] you
[34:29] i see who you are
[34:31] i know i know you
[34:33] i've dealt with you before and i'm not
[34:35] looking at the poor individual he's
[34:37] being used by satan at that time i'm
[34:39] looking over his shoulder the one that's
[34:41] whispering in his ear and i tell you
[34:43] what that helps you have a lot of
[34:45] sympathy for the individual that's
[34:48] that's speaking to you because you know
[34:50] he's in a lot worse shape than you are
[34:53] until you let him hop onto your shoulder
[34:58] which unfortunately we do because again
[35:02] if your spirit comes in agreement with
[35:04] that spirit
[35:06] there's a there's a it jumps over so you
[35:09] always have to keep yourself aware of
[35:12] where the battle is it's not against
[35:14] flesh and blood it's against powers and
[35:16] principalities
[35:18] right
[35:19] and our sword we don't go around cutting
[35:22] off people's ears our sword is the word
[35:24] of god so you can see how the
[35:27] understanding of the old testament
[35:29] informs our understanding of the new
[35:31] testament so jesus said to to pray for
[35:34] those who who who despitefully use you
[35:37] and say all men are of evil against you
[35:39] falsely for my name's sake and how many
[35:42] of us have experienced that in the
[35:43] church world
[35:44] when it says for my name's sake i often
[35:47] question if anybody's in the in the in
[35:49] the church world is being persecuted
[35:51] because they don't even know the name
[35:53] and so they can't be persecuted for his
[35:56] namesake because they don't know the
[35:57] name all right but it's it's our
[36:00] reaction to that to pray for them that
[36:03] uh despise you and evil evilly use you
[36:05] right so we love those who hate or even
[36:09] kill us because whether we win or lose
[36:11] in the physical world
[36:13] is not of first importance in our lives
[36:16] so when somebody says something
[36:18] offensive or does something or hurtful
[36:19] or whatever that's not the battle
[36:22] that's your natural man reacting
[36:25] naturally but that's not the battle the
[36:27] battle is against
[36:29] spiritual powers and wickedness and high
[36:32] places right that's the battle that's
[36:36] brother paul talked about that right the
[36:38] the battle that's in our mind in our
[36:40] thoughts that's where we need to be
[36:42] aggressive that's where we need to be
[36:44] confronting our enemy not your poor
[36:47] fellow citizens on earth
[36:50] in the new testament the most important
[36:53] thing is not to gain wealth
[36:55] it's not to have lots of sheep
[36:57] it's not to have a a big fancy chariot
[37:00] all right it's to get saved
[37:03] then we've got to live holy
[37:05] and receive the baptism of the holy
[37:06] spirit you'll know that as justification
[37:09] sanctification baptism of the holy
[37:11] spirit but let me warn you against
[37:13] jargon
[37:14] those words mean a lot to us i mean
[37:16] we've been grown up with that brother
[37:18] rap did a a whole series called decoding
[37:22] and it's to take some of the terminology
[37:25] and break it down and i've took a lesson
[37:27] from that brother rep and so we can just
[37:30] say get saved
[37:31] and everybody knows what we're talking
[37:33] about up to a point and live holy
[37:35] everybody understands that and then
[37:37] receive the bachelors of the holy spirit
[37:39] the problem is without an understanding
[37:41] of the old testament they don't even
[37:43] know what holiness means
[37:45] they don't understand the concept
[37:48] in fact brother paul was telling me some
[37:49] well-known people actually are sarcastic
[37:53] about the standard that message people
[37:56] have all right because they they see
[37:58] that as um as some kind of fabrication
[38:02] some kind of artificial put on and and
[38:04] no doubt they've experienced that right
[38:06] where you know the catholic uh priests
[38:09] when they when they have to come out and
[38:11] do the transubstantiation and take the
[38:14] the bread and the and the wine and turn
[38:16] it into the literal body of christ
[38:18] that's a scary thing you remember the
[38:20] martin luther movie remember how he was
[38:22] shaking at the altar thinking that you
[38:24] know this him as a sinner was going to
[38:27] have to perform this this task but what
[38:30] he was told and what priests are told is
[38:32] that when they put on those vestments
[38:35] it doesn't matter how drunk they are it
[38:37] doesn't matter how
[38:39] immoral they've been living when they
[38:41] put on those vestments they've put on
[38:43] holiness
[38:44] and now they can come to that altar
[38:47] boldly
[38:48] so think about it in terms of your own
[38:50] life
[38:51] when those people are sarcastic it's
[38:53] because they've seen the hypocrisy of
[38:56] putting on the outside but not living it
[38:58] from the inside all right and they it's
[39:01] like putting on a vestment
[39:03] it's like i've put on my clothes so now
[39:06] i look right but that doesn't mean you
[39:08] are right
[39:10] all right the oil comes from the inside
[39:12] out and so it's very important that we
[39:15] don't fall into that trap of thinking
[39:18] that we're putting on our vestments now
[39:20] it's okay
[39:22] i heard that yeah sometimes in the
[39:24] church world even if they have some kind
[39:26] of a dress standard at church it's only
[39:29] for church
[39:30] so as long as you do this in church
[39:32] you're okay but outside of church you
[39:34] can wear anything
[39:36] that's exactly the same thing coming
[39:38] into church and putting on the vestment
[39:41] all right doesn't make you holy
[39:44] and what is the reason for being saved
[39:47] living holy
[39:49] and receiving the baptism of the holy
[39:51] spirit
[39:53] that's the beginning not the end
[39:56] that's how we start
[39:59] the real
[40:01] purpose of god going to all the trouble
[40:04] of bringing up the stinky vessel out of
[40:06] the mud and cleaning it up and filling
[40:08] it up is to put it into service
[40:11] we're to be positioned according to the
[40:14] giftings and the and the the talents
[40:17] that god has given us so let's go back
[40:19] to genesis chapter one
[40:22] the first thing that happened was there
[40:24] was light the darkness that was around
[40:26] the earth was dispelled and light struck
[40:29] the earth
[40:30] all right that's getting saved then the
[40:33] second thing that happened was the
[40:34] waters separated from the waters and the
[40:36] waters from the dry land
[40:38] so separation was the characteristic of
[40:40] the second day living holy separating
[40:44] from the old things and then on the
[40:46] third day
[40:47] life came into the seed that's the
[40:49] baptism of the holy spirit forgive me
[40:51] for all of you have heard this all
[40:52] before but the fourth day is what i want
[40:55] to concentrate on
[40:57] the fourth day is when the sun and the
[40:59] moon and the stars were positioned for a
[41:02] purpose sun move over there you're going
[41:05] to rule the day moon you're going to
[41:07] rule the night stars you're going to be
[41:08] for signs and for seasons and for days
[41:10] and years
[41:12] so when the sun is gone
[41:15] the moon and the stars are all we have
[41:18] to guide us
[41:20] the sinner's bible
[41:22] remember we're the sinner's bible that's
[41:25] like the stars in heaven so when you
[41:27] look up in the night sky and you see
[41:29] orion you see the pleiades you you see
[41:33] the big bear you see these
[41:34] constellations you go oh that's that
[41:37] direction oh that's that direction how
[41:39] do we get our direction from the stars
[41:43] you see that so those
[41:46] those things were created in verse 1 in
[41:48] the in the beginning god created the
[41:50] heavens and the earth the earth was
[41:52] without form and void and darkness was
[41:53] on the face of the deep
[41:55] so that
[41:57] positioning of the sun moon and stars
[42:00] came on the fourth day they weren't
[42:02] created on the fourth day he said he
[42:05] made them on the fourth day and he made
[42:07] them for a purpose
[42:09] that's our adoption
[42:11] and so you can see how important this is
[42:14] that we understand even from genesis 1
[42:17] to understand salvation
[42:20] okay so what are we doing here in the
[42:22] new testament what's our goal in the old
[42:24] testament was to get to the promised
[42:26] land it was to have as many children as
[42:28] possible and and
[42:30] your seed shall be as the as the sand of
[42:32] the sea and the stars of heaven that was
[42:35] their mission
[42:36] all right
[42:37] our mission is that we're in training
[42:40] for raining
[42:41] we're gonna reign with him
[42:44] and this whole experience here brother
[42:47] brandon said anything we take with us is
[42:48] our character is training so i want to
[42:51] just encourage everybody we've all made
[42:54] mistakes we've all gone through
[42:55] difficult times we've all had
[42:57] backslidden moments years months
[43:00] lifetimes
[43:01] and yet
[43:03] it's all
[43:05] training it's all god building us up
[43:08] into his image those stones that built
[43:12] up the the tabernacle those were not
[43:14] perfect stones they weren't shaped with
[43:17] precision
[43:19] absolutely square if you look at any of
[43:22] the buildings of that time they're all
[43:24] misshapen stones
[43:26] that actually fit together very very
[43:28] well supernaturally if you like but not
[43:32] all the same
[43:33] so there's something about unity that i
[43:36] always like to mention because unity is
[43:38] a big subject we always want to have
[43:40] unity we don't want to have uh you know
[43:42] dissension within our ranks but remember
[43:45] unity is not uniformity
[43:48] uniformity is what you see when you look
[43:51] at a monastery and you see all those
[43:53] nuns coming out looking exactly the same
[43:55] that's uniformity we are not interested
[43:58] in uniformity we're all different made
[44:00] for a different purpose for a different
[44:03] time for in in a different place
[44:06] and we have different shapes and i can
[44:08] tell you that if you're rubbing
[44:10] shoulders with somebody and it's not
[44:12] quite comfortable
[44:14] it's because they've got pieces that are
[44:16] sticking out in the wrong places
[44:18] and you might have pieces that are
[44:19] sticking out in the wrong places for
[44:21] them but it's all part of god's economy
[44:24] it's all part of god's plan and it's
[44:27] training us
[44:29] for reigning so when we have to judge
[44:31] when we have to make decisions uh for
[44:34] the kingdom of god especially in the
[44:36] millennium obviously as the natural part
[44:38] of that we're accustomed to these things
[44:42] we understand them so never be concerned
[44:45] about the training period
[44:48] when you fall down and you and and
[44:51] something breaks if you weren't falling
[44:54] down and something was breaking you
[44:56] wouldn't be being trained think about
[44:58] any time you're learning something or
[45:00] training there's always this period
[45:01] where i don't know if i'm ever going to
[45:03] get this
[45:05] it's exactly the same in the kingdom of
[45:07] god and of course it's actually a lot
[45:09] harder because the lessons are so much
[45:12] more
[45:14] serious
[45:15] so somebody said to me but god doesn't
[45:17] tempt us
[45:20] so i want you to picture somebody being
[45:22] trained
[45:24] to climb a hill to climb a mountain
[45:27] and i see brother john there and sister
[45:29] laura lovely to see you and the girl
[45:31] nice to nice to see the family
[45:34] but
[45:35] brother john knows this from from
[45:37] military training i also went through
[45:39] some but they put you through some
[45:41] rugged
[45:42] circumstances
[45:43] and that's not because they're trying to
[45:45] hurt you they're trying to make sure you
[45:47] won't get hurt
[45:49] at some stage so if you're training to
[45:50] be a mountain climber they're putting
[45:52] you on steeper and steeper and steeper
[45:55] slopes and driving you up there to build
[45:58] the stamina to build the muscles to get
[46:00] used to the climate all of those things
[46:02] so that when you get to actually climb
[46:04] the mountain you're prepared for it
[46:07] you've been trained for it it's hard
[46:09] going through the training but if it
[46:10] wasn't for that training it would be
[46:12] much harder so when when god puts us
[46:15] through a training exercise an obstacle
[46:18] course if you like he's not trying to
[46:20] hurt us
[46:21] he's trying to build us up and the
[46:23] ministry when you sometimes feel like
[46:26] you know the ministry is a bit harsh
[46:28] remember the the purpose of the ministry
[46:30] is the edification or the building up of
[46:33] the body and how's that done it's done
[46:35] by training
[46:37] it's done by exercising by going through
[46:39] those steps over and over until they
[46:41] become automatic until they become
[46:43] natural and so that's what you're going
[46:46] through brother and sister and if just
[46:48] think about it i'm going to rule and
[46:50] reign with him one day and what i'm
[46:53] doing now is going to be what i'm going
[46:55] to take with me into eternity
[46:57] all right so christianity is the only
[46:59] religion in the world that follows the
[47:00] blueprint of a previous religion this is
[47:02] tying the old and the new testament
[47:04] together right so
[47:06] there's an importance to this because
[47:08] it's the only religion in the world that
[47:09] does that there's no other religion that
[47:11] has an old testament there's no old
[47:13] bhagavad-gita it doesn't exist right
[47:16] there's only the bhagavad-gita you
[47:18] understand so buddhism is buddhism right
[47:21] there's no like pre-buddhism it's
[47:23] buddhism and so this is very important
[47:26] that we understand when we talk about
[47:28] judeo-christian
[47:30] we are the only ones who have that term
[47:32] the old and the new judeo-christian all
[47:35] right
[47:36] so the new testament is the fulfillment
[47:39] of the old testament but here's the
[47:41] point gosh
[47:42] it's already 45 minutes okay god only
[47:46] speaks to us when we make the new
[47:49] testament and the old testament agree
[47:51] with each other
[47:52] that's the message from the ark
[47:55] that's how god speaks to us so we all
[47:57] want god to speak to us right we want
[47:59] him to speak to us from his word
[48:02] but if you only have
[48:04] half the signal
[48:07] you're only catching every second word
[48:10] that's hardly a way to have a
[48:11] conversation you need the sentence to be
[48:14] complete you need the whole word of god
[48:17] not just a portion of it do you mind if
[48:19] i take off my jacket brother paul
[48:22] this is for the second
[48:24] three hours
[48:26] uh okay
[48:28] so exodus chapter 25 verse 22 just to
[48:30] remind you what it says i'll meet you
[48:32] then i'll
[48:33] with you from
[48:35] above the mercy seat from between the
[48:38] two cherubims so the word speaks to us
[48:41] when we make the new and the old
[48:42] testament agree with each other and
[48:45] that's why jesus came between the two
[48:47] testaments in the four gospels because
[48:50] it's telling us the story of his life
[48:53] the ministry of jesus which is what's
[48:56] tying the two pieces together because if
[48:59] you just had the old testament that
[49:01] would be one picture if you just had the
[49:02] new testament that would be another
[49:04] picture but when you put it together
[49:06] then the picture is complete
[49:09] so at kaddish brother brennan preaches
[49:11] this in 1956 at kaddish bonier
[49:14] all the old testament and all of its
[49:16] characters and characteristics was only
[49:19] a foreshadow of the keystone
[49:21] the new testament that joined the law
[49:23] and this dispensation together joined
[49:25] the law and this new testament
[49:28] dispensation together so brother
[49:29] branham's saying there's a keystone
[49:32] between the two
[49:33] how many of you know what a keystone
[49:35] looks like
[49:36] keystone's the white bit in between
[49:39] and does it look familiar that shape if
[49:41] you turned it upside down
[49:44] it's a pyramidal shape
[49:46] right and that's what we understand in
[49:49] our uh understanding of of uh
[50:29] some of these buildings don't have any
[50:31] mortar they just put the blocks together
[50:33] put the keystone in they have a frame
[50:36] like a scaffold that holds up both
[50:38] arches then they put the keystone in and
[50:40] they pull the scaffolding away and it
[50:43] just stays there actually the forces
[50:45] actually hold it together pulling it
[50:47] down actually holds it together
[50:50] so when brother branham uses the term
[50:52] keystone
[50:54] that's no accident that's an absolute
[50:57] picture because christ bore the weight
[51:01] of all of our sin
[51:02] at the cross on
[51:04] on golgotha he is that keystone between
[51:07] the old and the new testament
[51:10] all right praise god for that ephesians
[51:13] chapter 2 verse 22 in whom you are also
[51:16] bolded together for inhabitation of god
[51:19] through the spirit so here we have the
[51:21] old testament foundation of the prophets
[51:25] and in the new testament first
[51:26] corinthians chapter 3 verse 10 according
[51:28] to the grace of god which is given unto
[51:30] me as a wise master builder
[52:04] the new testament together to be in the
[52:07] same position relative to the keystone
[52:10] according to the grace of god which is
[52:11] given unto me as a wise master builder i
[52:14] have laid the foundation and another
[52:17] builds on
[52:18] so in other words paul's the messenger
[52:20] he's saying this is what it should look
[52:22] like he's he's leonardo da vinci with
[52:25] his sketches all right and he's saying
[52:27] this is how i think it's going to work
[52:29] and then the ministers that come along
[52:31] later they're
[52:32] following the pattern that paul laid
[52:35] down
[52:36] to bring us to christ
[52:38] amen
[52:40] is this making sense right all right
[52:43] praise god so from a human viewpoint
[52:46] each of us
[52:47] is a member of the christian church and
[52:49] the church really starts with the book
[52:51] of acts which is the acts of the holy
[52:52] spirit in the church so there's a
[52:55] building process that we understand from
[52:58] the book of acts but in the book of acts
[53:01] we finally see the disciples getting it
[53:04] they go okay
[53:06] now we know so silver and gold have our
[53:08] none such as i have a give it unto thee
[53:12] and and i just want to see jesus smiling
[53:14] somewhere in heaven that's my boy
[53:17] you got it
[53:18] [Music]
[53:19] you were listening in class how many of
[53:22] us don't feel like that when somebody
[53:24] gets something that we've taught i can
[53:26] just see jesus oh man
[53:28] did you see that gus
[53:32] he got it so during the ministry of
[53:34] jesus
[53:35] the disciples followed
[53:38] but they followed blindly they had
[53:41] i want
[53:42] i'm going to have to talk to them one
[53:43] day i don't want to say anything bad but
[53:45] they just didn't get it
[53:48] by the way if you ever talk about any
[53:49] minor prophets you know the major
[53:51] prophets
[53:52] you know daniel and jeremiah and then
[53:55] you've got all those minor prophets that
[53:56] we don't know anything about habakkuk
[53:58] and jose
[54:00] just remember
[54:01] if you get to heaven please don't call
[54:03] amos aman a prophet
[54:05] i think you might
[54:07] get an
[54:08] earful a theological term that's
[54:13] there's nothing minor about any of those
[54:16] prophets believe me the only reason
[54:18] they're called mine is because their
[54:19] books are a little bit thinner and also
[54:21] that reminds me if you haven't read
[54:24] habakkuk in any time just remember you
[54:27] are going to be asked by habakkuk did
[54:30] you read my book
[54:32] you don't want to be caught
[54:34] no no habakkuk were you even in the
[54:36] bible
[54:39] so we we we you know we there's a reason
[54:42] that we we read all those smaller
[54:44] smaller prophets right so
[54:47] the old testament
[54:48] um was the schoolmaster the the
[54:51] disciples knew the old testament but
[54:53] they hadn't yet come to grips with the
[54:56] keystone they hadn't quite seen how the
[54:59] ministry of jesus works but
[55:01] during those four gospels obviously
[55:04] jesus knew what he was doing and they
[55:06] were to become the heart of the gospel
[55:10] or at the heart of the bible and that's
[55:13] where the ministry of jesus really
[55:15] speaks to us is when we can position
[55:18] that
[55:18] instruction precisely
[55:21] taking from the old testament seeing it
[55:24] into the new testament as a keystone
[55:26] going this is how it all fits together
[55:29] and we have that
[55:31] knowledge in spades because of the
[55:34] message we know things that other people
[55:36] have never heard of
[55:38] i mentioned earlier that
[55:40] why was jesus baptized
[55:43] brother rap noses from old days
[55:46] ask any any christian anytime anywhere
[55:49] any minister why was jesus baptized
[55:53] i have never once in 45 50 years more
[55:57] than that 50 years ever had anybody say
[56:01] because of leviticus 8
[56:03] because moses had to wash aaron for him
[56:05] to be the high priest not once
[56:08] even though it's so plain
[56:09] it's as plain as the nose on your face
[56:12] if you have the understanding
[56:14] if it's been opened to you if you know
[56:16] it's important to bring the old and the
[56:18] new testament together
[56:20] then it makes sense but otherwise
[56:24] they're flying on one wing
[56:26] so
[56:27] in this
[56:28] keystone we know that it's in the
[56:31] supreme position the whole thing doesn't
[56:33] work without that one stone it's the
[56:36] absolute position everything has to come
[56:38] to that position and only his life
[56:42] could support and bring together
[57:09] but there's only one keystone and that
[57:11] without that keystone they all fall down
[57:15] nice experiment for sunday school class
[57:17] by the way get some blocks put them
[57:18] together hold them up put the keystone
[57:20] in it and watch it sit
[57:23] it's
[57:24] going to be quite interesting all right
[57:26] back to kadesh barnea the christian
[57:28] dispensation lasted three years and six
[57:30] months the law lasted for several
[57:32] hundred years and then the christian
[57:34] dispensation is what bridged or
[57:37] keystoned the new and the old testament
[57:39] together do you think brother branham
[57:40] had this picture absolutely i believe
[57:43] this wasn't this is what he was saying
[57:45] so the old testament looks forward to
[57:47] jesus the new testament looks back to
[57:50] his ministry on earth and so we've heard
[57:53] this before the old testament informs
[57:55] the new testament the new testament
[57:57] fulfills the old testament
[58:00] so jesus said think not that i'm come to
[58:03] destroy the law of the prophets i'm not
[58:05] come to destroy but to fulfill you talk
[58:07] to many people that are flying on the
[58:09] new testament wing this is the problem
[58:13] all right is they think that jesus came
[58:15] to do away with the law
[58:17] and he didn't he came to fulfill the law
[58:19] and there's an exact scripture that says
[58:21] that by the way when you know
[58:23] you have to kind of you know cross that
[58:25] one out in your bible for verily i say
[58:27] unto you till heaven and earth pass not
[58:29] one jot or one tittle shall and no wise
[58:31] pass from the law till all be fulfilled
[58:34] to the law isaiah 8 verse 20 one of my
[58:36] favorite verses to the law and to the
[58:38] testimony if they speak not according to
[58:41] this word it is because there is no
[58:43] light in them what is light light is
[58:45] understanding light is also christ light
[58:48] is also the holy spirit light is also
[58:50] the sun all these things point to one
[58:53] thing is that we need to be illuminated
[58:56] we need to have understanding of the law
[59:00] and the testimony on the one hand and
[59:02] then the understanding of christ on the
[59:05] other hand
[59:07] so by the way
[59:08] when i leave and somebody tells me that
[59:11] they found the service very refreshing
[59:13] that's not a compliment
[59:16] because it means they felt like a new
[59:17] man when they woke up
[59:19] so that's the
[59:23] so please nobody say you found it
[59:25] refreshing okay
[59:28] so matthew chapter 5 verse 17 18 20
[59:31] we'll go through these quickly for i
[59:32] sent you that except your righteousness
[59:34] shall exceed the righteousness of the
[59:36] scribes and pharisees shall in no wise
[59:38] enter in the kingdom of heaven hands up
[59:40] all of those who think they're more
[59:41] righteous than those pharisees
[59:44] oh there's one no
[59:48] no he was just moving his arm sorry so
[59:51] here's the thing
[59:52] those people live by the law
[59:55] they had to be squeaky clean
[59:59] every eye was on them
[1:00:01] you're a pharisee
[1:00:03] they had a huge position in the
[1:00:05] community think of a rabbi today but
[1:00:07] these people were ten times rabbis all
[1:00:10] right you know the difference between
[1:00:11] pharisees and sadducees
[1:00:14] the pharisees were far eye seas because
[1:00:17] they believed in the resurrection
[1:00:19] the sadducees were the sad you sees
[1:00:22] because they didn't believe in the
[1:00:23] resurrection so that's how you can tell
[1:00:25] the difference between the two so these
[1:00:28] scribes and pharisees were extremely
[1:00:31] righteous in the law
[1:00:33] how can we possibly exceed his right
[1:00:37] their righteousness
[1:00:39] it's because we're no longer putting on
[1:00:41] the vestment we're no longer putting on
[1:00:44] the cloak of respectability
[1:00:47] it's coming from the inside out it's
[1:00:49] coming from a changed heart it's coming
[1:00:52] from a soul that's been reborn it's
[1:00:54] coming from the inside of the inside and
[1:00:57] our nature has changed because the
[1:00:59] nature of our nature has changed
[1:01:03] so the this the nature of the flesh is
[1:01:06] the spirit the nature of the spirit is
[1:01:08] the soul so when you change the soul
[1:01:10] that works its way out into your life
[1:01:13] into the way you think and that in turn
[1:01:15] changes your behavior all right so
[1:01:18] that's how we can exceed the
[1:01:19] righteousness of the pharisees the lord
[1:01:21] is well pleased for his righteousness
[1:01:23] sake he will magnify the law and make it
[1:01:26] honorable what is this word honorable
[1:01:29] it's uh it means to make glorious
[1:01:33] so when the bible says that god is going
[1:01:35] to have a glorious church without spot
[1:01:38] and without blemish ultimately righteous
[1:01:41] it's because
[1:01:42] we have the righteousness of god in
[1:01:45] christ
[1:01:47] in christ it's as if we've never sinned
[1:01:52] conviction will bring you back under the
[1:01:54] umbrella of god's protection under the
[1:01:57] umbrella of his blood so when you sin
[1:01:59] you step out prick figuratively speaking
[1:02:02] from that umbrella the holy spirit
[1:02:04] convicts you you go oh sorry i repent
[1:02:07] and you back under the blood
[1:02:10] watson
[1:02:11] i don't see any sin
[1:02:13] so satan is trying to accuse us watson
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:17] think
[1:02:18] what we have
[1:02:20] i'm closing
[1:02:21] one hour brother paul on the dot
[1:02:26] think of what we have
[1:02:29] in the message
[1:02:30] this ability to commune with god through
[1:02:33] the old and the new testament like they
[1:02:36] did in the figure
[1:02:38] in the ark of the testament the ark of
[1:02:40] the covenant where these two testaments
[1:02:43] agreed with each other and christ is in
[1:02:46] the midst of that so our ability to have
[1:02:49] communion with him is built on our
[1:02:51] knowledge of the old and the new
[1:02:53] testament not just the knowledge of it
[1:02:55] but the
[1:02:56] understanding of it we can make it live
[1:03:00] in our lives and we have that to give
[1:03:04] freely have we received
[1:03:06] freely give
[1:03:08] so as we close i want to remind you of
[1:03:10] this scripture
[1:03:11] brother branham said and now also i come
[1:03:13] to these
[1:03:14] i come to throw my net in with these
[1:03:16] brethren that's how i feel come to throw
[1:03:19] my net in with you brethren
[1:03:22] now you know each one of us are
[1:03:24] fishermen
[1:03:26] he didn't exclude anybody
[1:03:28] each one of us is fishermen
[1:03:31] isn't that isn't that a beautiful way to
[1:03:33] think of it we're all fishermen and
[1:03:36] believe me the bible called us to be
[1:03:38] fishermen
[1:03:39] called us to be fishes of men not
[1:03:41] keepers of the aquarium
[1:03:46] so we have a lot of in reach
[1:03:48] but we do need outreach
[1:03:51] and it's always been something that i've
[1:03:53] been very passionate about is that we
[1:03:55] need to take what we know and freely
[1:03:58] share it when you charge a battery
[1:04:01] do you charge up the battery you go and
[1:04:02] buy a battery you charge it up you put
[1:04:05] it in the closet i've got a charged up
[1:04:07] battery
[1:04:08] no you charge up the battery so that you
[1:04:11] can use it for some purpose to to
[1:04:13] illuminate somebody's life to give
[1:04:16] something out of yourself that's why you
[1:04:19] got charged up
[1:04:20] you didn't get charged up to just sit
[1:04:22] there and vibrate with holiness
[1:04:24] okay it's because you have to give that
[1:04:28] out if you don't give it out you're just
[1:04:29] going to tremble and shake all day
[1:04:31] because it's got to go somewhere
[1:04:34] oh i love that song don francisco i
[1:04:36] gotta tell somebody do you hear you
[1:04:38] remember that the way that it's it
[1:04:40] there's so much angst in it i've got to
[1:04:42] tell somebody i've got to tell somebody
[1:04:45] i've got to tell somebody what jesus did
[1:04:47] for me
[1:04:49] that should be every one of us doing
[1:04:52] that and so as i finished god bless you
[1:04:55] thank you for having me and just want to
[1:04:57] finish with this quote and just then
[1:05:00] remember the
[1:05:01] the three pulls
[1:05:02] and just then the one behind me said now
[1:05:04] i'll teach you to fish how to catch
[1:05:07] those
[1:05:08] that's still the gospel today
[1:05:12] we're still fishing for that special
[1:05:15] anointed seed of god that's out there
[1:05:18] and guess what when you start tying the
[1:05:20] old and the new testament together it's
[1:05:22] going to register something in their
[1:05:24] heart because that dna was in them from
[1:05:27] the foundation of before the foundation
[1:05:29] of the world and so when you start
[1:05:31] knitting those together they're going to
[1:05:33] go that there's something here this is
[1:05:35] something that i need this is something
[1:05:37] that resonates with me
[1:05:39] and we never know when that's going to
[1:05:41] happen
[1:05:42] so we preach as if everybody can receive
[1:05:44] it but when we receive it we know it was
[1:05:46] the anointed seed it was the gene seed
[1:05:49] of god that receives it so we receive it
[1:05:52] with predestination but we preach it as
[1:05:54] if everybody could be saved
[1:05:57] so god bless you thank you for having me
[1:05:59] and brother paul i'll just hand over to
[1:06:01] you we can just say your prayers we do
[1:06:03] some musicians you can come let's just
[1:06:05] stand to uh
[1:06:08] just to acknowledge him
[1:06:10] again heavenly father
[1:06:12] i just pray you'll take these words lord
[1:06:15] and speak to each heart
[1:06:17] according to their need as they have
[1:06:19] desires and and needs and even questions
[1:06:22] and and things that concern them lord i
[1:06:25] just pray that just on the day of
[1:06:27] pentecost you took and every man heard
[1:06:28] them in their own tongue that every
[1:06:31] person in here lord hear exactly what it
[1:06:34] is that you would have had them to hear
[1:06:36] and may that linger with them and may
[1:06:38] they meditate on your word day and night
[1:06:40] lord and may they be able to commune
[1:06:42] with you because of the the fantastic
[1:06:45] understanding that we've been given in
[1:06:47] this age to bring these two testaments
[1:06:50] together in christ so god bless each and
[1:06:52] every one lord i pray you would richly
[1:06:55] bless them bless their families lord
[1:06:58] bless their work bless every aspect of
[1:07:00] their lives i ask it all in jesus name
[1:07:05] amen amen
[1:07:18] hallelujah
[1:07:20] brother bram says teaching
[1:07:23] stabilizes teaching positions the church
[1:07:26] and um
[1:07:28] i really thoroughly enjoyed this this
[1:07:30] morning and these are one of those
[1:07:32] things that you guys can go ahead and
[1:07:34] put it on the
[1:07:35] archive or wherever else you put it and
[1:07:37] post it
[1:07:38] because this is when you have to go back
[1:07:40] and listen
[1:07:41] and let it sink in teaching us a lot of
[1:07:43] time that way
[1:07:45] but i really enjoyed it
[1:07:47] we have a modern church world that is
[1:07:49] basically written off
[1:07:50] the old testament
[1:07:53] you get into discussions about modesty
[1:07:55] and all those other things
[1:07:57] the only way they can do justify what
[1:07:59] they're doing is to write off the old
[1:08:01] testament
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:04] but when you see this and you see our
[1:08:06] prophet bring the two together and why
[1:08:09] he had to keep referring to never
[1:08:11] never dishonored never devalued never
[1:08:14] put up but grabbing that old testament
[1:08:16] as a prophet and bringing it together
[1:08:18] with what god has given us new covenant
[1:08:20] that's exactly god said why he sent his
[1:08:22] prophet and i think it was just
[1:08:24] wonderful when you have a church world
[1:08:26] that's writing it off then you see god
[1:08:27] blessing us to be able to tie it
[1:08:29] together like that and it's good for
[1:08:31] witnessing too because you're you're
[1:08:32] sharing with somebody you know i've done
[1:08:35] that in witnessing where you reach back
[1:08:37] in something that we just know that
[1:08:38] happened in a shadow in the old
[1:08:39] testament i reach back there and then i
[1:08:42] use a scripture new testament i reach
[1:08:43] back there for a shadow and i i say gee
[1:08:46] and they go wow you see jesus and that
[1:08:48] you see jesus and joseph and you explain
[1:08:50] it to him and it all comes together
[1:08:52] that's the way we have to witness that's
[1:08:53] we have to talk to him talk about it
[1:08:56] and the mind of god
[1:08:58] is just as much in those scriptures back
[1:09:01] there
[1:09:02] than
[1:09:03] in the new testament
[1:09:05] and so that's why we pray say god
[1:09:08] it's a revelation to catch your mind
[1:09:10] of what's laying back there can you say
[1:09:12] amen that's why brother uh steve and i
[1:09:14] enjoy
[1:09:15] i've been lately in my life enjoying the
[1:09:17] minor prophet so i won't be calling
[1:09:19] those guys minor
[1:09:21] because now that i grow in the lord i'm
[1:09:23] enjoying those even more
[1:09:25] because there's nuggets in there you
[1:09:26] just have to wait and pray about them
[1:09:28] brother steve has we've known him
[1:09:30] stephen is many years now and a
[1:09:33] wonderful teacher out there in des
[1:09:34] moines
[1:09:35] and we're glad to have them probably i
[1:09:37] haven't announced it yet we're glad to
[1:09:39] have them as part of our congregation
[1:09:41] can you say amen
[1:09:43] praise the lord thank you
