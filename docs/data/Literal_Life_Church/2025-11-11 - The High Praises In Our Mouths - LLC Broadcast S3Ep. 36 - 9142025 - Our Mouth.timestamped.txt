[3:57] Joshua chapter 6
[4:00] and verse 10. I'm just going to pull
[4:02] out. I won't read the whole chapter of
[4:04] course, but Joshua chapter 6 and verse
[4:08] 10. And Joshua had commanded the people,
[4:11] saying, "Ye shall not shout, nor make
[4:14] any noise with your voice, neither shall
[4:18] any word proceed out of your mouth until
[4:21] the day I bid you shout. Then shall ye
[4:25] shout." Uh, if you know your Bible,
[4:27] we're in the setting of the of Jericho.
[4:31] And, um, I'll just add in this chapter 6
[4:34] and verse one. Now Jericho was
[4:36] straightly shut up because of the
[4:38] children of Israel. None went out and
[4:39] none came in. So they had already
[4:40] surrounded the city. And the Lord said
[4:42] unto Joshua, "See, I have given into
[4:46] thine hand Jericho and the king thereof
[4:48] and the mighty men of valor." God had
[4:50] already said, "I have already given you
[4:52] Jericho." Now, shouldn't that charge the
[4:55] saints of God to know he's already given
[4:57] it to us?
[4:59] &gt;&gt; So if he's already given it to them,
[5:02] then let's go do it. Let's go do it. But
[5:04] now God tests the people because he's
[5:06] going to do the battle plan his own way,
[5:10] not our way, not their way, but he's
[5:12] going to do the battle plan. And we have
[5:14] to be submissive and obedient to the
[5:16] battle plan. And the battle plan was
[5:19] stranged because said he said in verse
[5:21] 10, he said, "You shall not shout nor
[5:24] make any noise with your voice, neither
[5:26] shall any word proceed out of your mouth
[5:28] until the day I bid you shout. Then
[5:30] shall you shout." And for six days they
[5:32] had to shut their mouths until God said
[5:35] to shout.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 16.
[5:40] And it came to pass at the seventh time
[5:42] when the priests blew the trumpets,
[5:43] Joshua said unto the people, shout for
[5:46] the Lord hath given you the city.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Verse 20. So the people shouted when the
[5:54] priests blew with the trumpets. And it
[5:56] came to pass when the people heard the
[5:58] sound of the trumpet, and the people
[6:00] shouted with a great shout that the wall
[6:03] fell down flat, so that the people went
[6:06] up into the city, every man straight
[6:09] before him, and they took the city. I
[6:12] love to read about victories
[6:14] &gt;&gt; in the word of God. Believers are all
[6:17] about victories.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; I know the devil likes to make your life
[6:20] a life of defeat, but if you're a
[6:22] believer, it's a life of victories.
[6:25] Praise the Lord. Let's read in Psalms
[6:27] 149 if you would. Verse 6. Let the high
[6:30] praises of God be in their mouth and the
[6:35] two-edged sword in their hand. Worship
[6:38] in this has seemed to reach its highest
[6:41] form. And when worship has reached is
[6:44] how many know that worship is not just
[6:46] singing in church but it's our life. And
[6:50] worship reaches its highest form. I
[6:53] believe in this Psalms 149 because it
[6:56] speaks of a people. In fact, I would say
[6:59] that it's prophetic because it speaks of
[7:02] a people with a sword in their hand and
[7:05] the high praises of God upon their lips.
[7:09] And this high praises is the only place
[7:11] it's mentioned in scripture, the high
[7:14] praises of God. And that grabbed my
[7:16] attention because it's if it's mentioned
[7:18] in one place, then we realize it must
[7:20] have some meaning to it. Praise is
[7:22] mentioned many places, but this was a
[7:25] people with the high praises of God upon
[7:28] their lips. And it is also a people that
[7:32] have the sword in their hand. And all of
[7:34] us believers should be familiar with
[7:36] that because we are the people that have
[7:39] received the sword back into our hand.
[7:41] It struck the prophet's hand and it also
[7:44] has struck the hand of the people that
[7:46] we have the word. The sword put blank
[7:48] put back in our hands. But it's not just
[7:50] that we have the word. It's not just
[7:52] that we have the restored word, but we
[7:54] have the high praises of God upon our
[7:57] lips and or or I should say we should
[8:00] have the high praises of God upon our
[8:03] lips. So when I looked up this high
[8:06] praises uh we realized that the first
[8:09] meaning of it it means to be very
[8:12] exuberant. It means be to be very
[8:14] joyful. It means to be very excited. It
[8:18] means to be constantly bragging on God.
[8:21] praising God, not only in church, but
[8:23] you're always praising God. You're
[8:25] always bragging on the Lord. You're
[8:26] always telling about the good things
[8:28] that he's done, and you're you're not
[8:30] afraid to talk about it to somebody in
[8:31] the store or your boss or anybody else.
[8:34] If you get the opportunity, it's an
[8:36] exuberant excitement to praise and put
[8:39] on these lips, glory to Almighty God.
[8:42] That's the high praises of God. And it
[8:44] isn't just on Sunday. It isn't just
[8:46] every year at the camp meeting, but it
[8:48] should be every day of our lives. What
[8:51] comes out of our mouth is thanksgiving
[8:53] and praise for what the Lord has done.
[8:56] It is not lukewarm praise or passive
[8:59] praise. It's not laidback, well, I'm too
[9:02] tired to do it, but it actually the high
[9:04] praises of God. It actually embodies
[9:07] itself in a body so much that you see
[9:10] the expressions of clapping your hands
[9:13] and shouting and rejoicing and saying
[9:16] amen. But I'm a shy person. But this
[9:19] high praise kind of overrides that
[9:21] shyness and says I'm feeling this. I'm
[9:24] there's tears coming down my life. God
[9:27] God has redeemed me. God has saved me.
[9:29] Can you say amen? God has done something
[9:32] for me. Can you say amen? Praise the
[9:34] Lord. Uh I I I was looking at the slides
[9:37] coming across and there's one slide
[9:39] there from one of the preachers that
[9:40] says, "Soon as a man is cleansed from
[9:43] sin, he is clothed with praise." Soon as
[9:47] a man is cleansed from sin and he's
[9:49] really been cleansed, he becomes clothed
[9:52] with high praises.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's not lazy. I believe
[9:56] it's not something that's lukewarm or
[9:59] it's when you feel like it. I believe
[10:01] it's something that becomes high praises
[10:03] and it is unashamed. It is an unashamed
[10:07] expression in your song, in your hands,
[10:11] in your body. It may even make you dance
[10:14] every once in a while. And I'll tell
[10:15] you, if it made David dance before
[10:18] Calvary, and it made David's cup
[10:20] overflowing, overwhelmed before Calvary,
[10:24] now after Calvary, it our cup should be
[10:27] running over.
[10:29] Hallelujah.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Our cup should be not not just full but
[10:32] running over. I thought about that the
[10:34] other day. I thought, you know what, in
[10:36] our lives, do we live a life I've got a
[10:38] cup, a coffee cup that says, "My cup
[10:41] runth over." I use it every morning, but
[10:43] I was looking at the other day, how many
[10:45] believers can say like David before
[10:48] Calvary, he was already saved, my cup is
[10:51] running over.
[10:54] I'll tell you friends, God has done
[10:56] mighty things. And this unashamed
[10:58] expression should be in your song. It
[11:00] should be in your hands. It should be in
[11:01] your body. Sometimes even affects our
[11:03] feet. It lets it all out for the Lord
[11:06] and has no fear to bring a vocal
[11:10] celebration upon its lips.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; And that all happens because something
[11:16] is causing it's not because I'm uh
[11:18] forcing it this morning or I'm working
[11:20] it up.
[11:22] That happens because the revelation of
[11:24] Christ has struck your heart. And when
[11:26] revelation strikes your heart,
[11:28] stimulation is on its way. But then I
[11:31] was drawn to the other meaning of high
[11:32] praise. And that's beyond just church.
[11:35] Uh uh while music is often part of high
[11:39] praise, and it is music is a part of it.
[11:42] Worship is a part of it. Our expression
[11:43] at church and at home in music. While
[11:47] music is often a part of high praise,
[11:49] it's not limited to it. In other words,
[11:51] it's not limited to being in church.
[11:53] High praises of God on your lips is not
[11:55] limited to being in church. If this is
[11:57] the only time you sing is in church, uh,
[12:00] shame on you. Our high praises belong to
[12:03] him wherever we're at, whenever we feel
[12:05] to give praises to God. If this is the
[12:08] only time you read your Bible, then
[12:10] shame on you this morning. Because this
[12:12] is not a Sunday morning religion. This
[12:14] is every day that we bring the high
[12:16] praises to God. If this is the only
[12:18] place you ever sing a song, you say,
[12:20] "Brother Paul, I don't have a gift to
[12:22] sing." God never made qualifications.
[12:24] You know what the qualification is to
[12:25] bring praise? That's if you're
[12:27] breathing.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Let everything that hath breath.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Check your neighbor breathe on them.
[12:36] Wait, wait a minute. Don't do that.
[12:38] Check check your pulse. If you're
[12:41] breathing, you have no excuse. That is
[12:44] the only qualification that makes you a
[12:46] worshipper.
[12:48] Let everything that have breath praise
[12:50] the Lord.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just a little different. You
[12:54] know, I'm just a little different. Yeah,
[12:55] you are different. Get the high praises
[12:57] of God on your lips.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the writer says
[13:03] here, high praise can be expressed
[13:05] through various forms of worship and
[13:07] even in daily life through actions of
[13:11] obedience and love. So it's the high
[13:14] praises of God is not just something
[13:16] upon our lips as far as songs and
[13:18] worship, but it's our life. It's our
[13:21] daily life. It's our actions of
[13:23] obedience and love. Do you know we
[13:25] worship when we're obedient to the word
[13:27] of God? Do you know we worship it and
[13:29] express our spel back to him by what we
[13:32] what we say every day and not just what
[13:35] we say at church? Do you know that our
[13:37] obedience and our love for God and for
[13:40] other people expresses worship?
[13:44] So it raises the level of our worship
[13:47] not just in church but every day. It
[13:50] raises the quality. Here we go now. And
[13:53] I told you to put your seat belt on. It
[13:55] raises the quality when you say high
[13:58] praises. It raises the quality of what's
[14:01] coming out of your mouth every
[14:04] &gt;&gt; day. Amen.
[14:09] Because if you're
[14:11] a a morbid complainer,
[14:15] you heard a morbid obesity,
[14:18] morbid complainer, then you haven't
[14:21] found the high praises of God.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; And if you think this is just uh this
[14:28] high praises is just singing in church
[14:30] or shouting or speaking in tongues, no.
[14:32] high praises on our mouth means letting
[14:35] our mouth be used of God for the right
[14:38] things.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; And shutting them from saying the wrong
[14:42] things.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; I'm here to make it clear. The high
[14:46] praises of God is letting your mouth be
[14:49] used of the Lord to speak the right
[14:52] things, to speak edification, to speak
[14:55] things that build up instead of tear
[14:57] down, to speak. It raises the quality of
[15:00] what's coming out of your mouth every
[15:02] day and it shuts its mouth from all the
[15:05] rest of it. While I was ministering on
[15:07] the sword and the hand and the pie
[15:09] praise on the tongue, I mentioned some
[15:11] places where the worship was not
[15:14] striking it just right with God. I went
[15:16] from from Cain worship all the way
[15:19] through and mentioned some places where
[15:21] the people were worshiping. They were
[15:23] sincere. Sometimes they were very
[15:25] sincere. uh sometimes uh uh that they
[15:28] weren't sincere, but there were elements
[15:30] missing in the worship. And when the
[15:32] elements were missing in in Cain, he was
[15:34] missing blood. He was missing a
[15:35] revelation. He was missing sacrifice.
[15:38] And we think that we're oh, it's
[15:39] worship. It's sincere. It's to God. So
[15:41] we God just accepts it. Not always
[15:43] because God would like to strike just
[15:45] the right type of worshippers,
[15:47] especially at the end time who worship
[15:50] him in spirit and in truth.
[15:53] Jesus said to the woman at the well,
[15:55] "There'll come a day, there's an hour
[15:56] coming when the true worshippers will
[15:58] worship him in spirit and in truth." It
[16:00] won't be missing the spirit and it won't
[16:03] be missing the word. At the end time,
[16:05] they'll have it both together. And I
[16:07] want to be one of those true
[16:08] worshippers. Can you say amen? If you
[16:10] want to know who I am, I'm not Paula
[16:12] Fontaine that has a gift to sing. I'm
[16:14] not Paula Fontaine has a gift to preach.
[16:16] You know who I am? I'm one of those true
[16:18] worshippers at the end time. And whether
[16:20] I could sing or preach, I want to be one
[16:22] of those true worshippers.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to see it in my life. I don't
[16:26] want you to see it at church. I want my
[16:28] grandchildren to see what I'm excited
[16:30] about in life. And it's not about
[16:32] things. It's about bringing worship in
[16:34] my life to this God. That's what I want
[16:36] them to see. I'm not all these other
[16:38] things. I'm a true worshipper of God.
[16:41] How many want to be a true worshshiper
[16:42] of God?
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Half of you. Well, praise the Lord.
[16:46] Maybe we can keep preaching and you
[16:48] desire to be what Jesus said. I want to
[16:51] be one of those true worshippers that he
[16:52] prophesied about
[16:54] &gt;&gt; to worship him in spirit and truth. So
[16:57] sometimes the worship didn't strike
[16:59] right to just bring pleasure to God
[17:02] because there were elements missing. But
[17:04] then I mentioned a a couple times where
[17:07] it struck just right. I brought up the
[17:09] temple and somehow all the elements were
[17:12] there and it struck just right to bring
[17:14] pleasure to God. And you know what
[17:16] happened? All the instruments were in
[17:18] order. All the worshippers were in
[17:19] order. All the dedication, the
[17:21] consecration, everything was in
[17:23] perfectly in order. And there was such a
[17:25] heart in the people just to step back
[17:27] and just worship their God. And it
[17:29] struck just the right thing to the glory
[17:32] filled the temple and the preacher
[17:34] couldn't even preach. It struck just the
[17:36] right worship. But I didn't get to
[17:38] Jericho
[17:40] because in Jericho
[17:42] something struck just right.
[17:46] Because this
[17:48] this city that God had given him was
[17:50] walled with walls that were so thick
[17:52] that they could have chariot races
[17:54] around it. That's a pretty thick wall.
[17:57] And it was impossible to overcome
[17:59] something like this. And the power in
[18:02] this army on the seventh day when they
[18:06] shouted on the seventh day when they
[18:09] shouted the walls shook and the walls
[18:13] crumbled and they walked right in and
[18:16] took the enemy.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; But the mystery
[18:22] of the power
[18:24] was not just in the shout.
[18:30] The mystery of power is not just in
[18:32] noise.
[18:37] I know that's pushed a lot in some of
[18:39] our ranks,
[18:41] but you're if you're pushing just noise
[18:44] and you're working it up and you're
[18:46] working up the shout,
[18:49] missing the other elements,
[18:52] &gt;&gt; then you're missing the mystery
[18:55] &gt;&gt; of what the third pole will do.
[18:59] I mean that very respectfully. But
[19:01] listen, don't miss the scriptural
[19:02] patterns. Because for six days, there
[19:07] was six days of absolute silence.
[19:11] Something happened where God was pleased
[19:13] and the right thing came together. The
[19:16] right shout came together. Catch this
[19:19] now. The re the ratio is six days of
[19:23] silence to one moment of shouting.
[19:25] Silence makes people nervous that they
[19:27] got to we got to say something. You ever
[19:29] have somebody that in a conversation in
[19:31] the you have the what is it the 30
[19:34] secondond law the law in the
[19:36] conversation and somebody's just got to
[19:38] say something and then they usually say
[19:39] something stupid
[19:42] because they can't handle the silence.
[19:45] Somebody's telling me about someone a
[19:46] few weeks ago. It's like they just got
[19:48] to say something, you know, well, we
[19:49] should do this, we should do that. just,
[19:51] you know, it's okay if nobody has
[19:55] something to say. It's okay if nobody
[19:58] has something to say.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; But you've been in that kind
[20:02] and they just blurt something out. And
[20:04] sometimes, you know, it doesn't even
[20:06] have time. They just think it and it
[20:09] quickly goes and spills right out their
[20:12] mouth. They didn't let their heart
[20:13] ponder it. They didn't use any
[20:15] discernment of the Holy Ghost. They
[20:17] thought it and it spilled right out and
[20:19] they said it. I can't believe you just
[20:21] said that.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Six days. The ratio is six days of
[20:27] silence to one moment of shouting.
[20:30] It sure seems like some groups got a
[20:33] real imbalance in the ratios,
[20:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[20:38] &gt;&gt; The ratio is way the other way. And
[20:42] actually eliminating the obedience in
[20:45] being silent silent for six days. That's
[20:48] not even in the scenario.
[20:51] And to believe that the victory
[20:54] came only because of the shout
[20:58] to believe that the victory came only
[21:00] because of the shout is not sound
[21:02] doctrine.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; The obedience of seven days of God's
[21:08] people to follow God's orders, that's
[21:12] what gave power for the shout.
[21:16] [Applause]
[21:17] The silence for the first six days was a
[21:21] test of faith and obedience.
[21:24] Maybe this is why God did it because he
[21:26] had already given him the city. Most of
[21:28] us would be saying, "Glory be to God.
[21:31] Let's have a shout. Let the horns blast.
[21:33] Let the rams horns blast. Let's get the
[21:36] ark going. Let's go get it." Maybe he
[21:39] was testing their obedience. No, we're
[21:41] not going to get it for seven days and
[21:43] for six days in your tents and
[21:45] everywhere. Everybody does not utter one
[21:48] word.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; You know, listen friends, I don't know
[21:53] how that was accomplished. I do not know
[21:55] how it happened. If they were human
[21:57] beings like you are and I am. I do not
[22:00] know except for this incredible respect
[22:04] for Joshua, who's the type of the Holy
[22:06] Ghost, and respect for God and respect
[22:09] for his strategy for victory.
[22:14] And enough people saying if that's what
[22:17] God said that's the strategy for battle
[22:20] and victory that's what we're doing. And
[22:22] for six days I don't know how they did
[22:24] it. They were human beings.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Human beings can't shut their mouth.
[22:28] They give themselves permission to say
[22:30] whatever they want to say whenever they
[22:31] want to say it. Human beings are like
[22:33] little twoyear-olds who say whatever
[22:35] they want to say whenever they want to
[22:37] say it.
[22:40] But if we're going into adoption, we're
[22:42] saying, "Lord, get control of this
[22:43] tongue."
[22:46] &gt;&gt; That only edification would come out of
[22:48] it.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; And not just in church, but on an
[22:51] everyday basis. It was a test ensuring
[22:54] that the people did not voice any doubts
[22:57] about the effectiveness of God's
[22:58] strategy. That's what one Christian
[23:00] writer said. That's not my own words,
[23:01] but I like it. He was God was ensuring
[23:04] that the people did not voice any doubts
[23:06] about the effectiveness of God's
[23:09] strategy. No unbelief, no doubts, no
[23:11] question. Why? Why do we have to do it
[23:13] that way? Well, that's the craziest
[23:14] things. God always gives God's already
[23:16] given us the the city. Uh you know, uh
[23:19] what's the test? The test is whether we
[23:21] can hold our tongue from complaining and
[23:24] giving our own opinion to God's orders.
[23:27] Why can't we take the city now, Joshua?
[23:30] God said Jericho is is ours. Let's go.
[23:33] Why am I holding this trumpet and I
[23:35] can't use it? You better use your
[23:36] trumpet when God says to use it.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; And you better use it for God.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; And you better use it in harmony with
[23:43] the Holy Ghost anointing. You better use
[23:45] your gift in the will in the channel of
[23:48] the word of God or it'll get out of the
[23:50] word of God and you think it's worship
[23:52] and beneficial. But you better keep your
[23:54] gift in the channel of holiness, in the
[23:56] channel of God, and the way he wants to
[23:58] use your gift. Can't get enough amens
[24:01] this morning. I believe this is the
[24:02] truth. Come on, Joshua. Let's go take
[24:04] it. You know, Joshua, I think it's the
[24:06] devil on the preachers holding the
[24:08] people back from shouting.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; It's the devil speaking in your ear,
[24:14] saying not to get up and shout right
[24:15] now. Don't quench the spirit, Joshua.
[24:18] Now's the time to shout. No, it's not
[24:20] time right now. It's time to wait till
[24:22] God brings us in a certain place. And
[24:25] you never have to legislate the shout.
[24:27] God will say, "Now let out a shout and
[24:30] the walls of Jericho will come down."
[24:32] The shout of the people brought the
[24:34] walls of Jericho down. We're going to
[24:36] raise the roof off this place. We're
[24:39] going to shout the walls of Jericho
[24:40] down. Well, I wonder if there's really
[24:42] any power there or if any walls are
[24:46] really coming down
[24:47] &gt;&gt; in people's lives. And I wonder how many
[24:49] gossips are in that group. How many
[24:52] complainers are amongst the heavy
[24:54] shoutters? How many proud people? How
[24:57] many boasters are in the same crowd of
[24:58] shoutters? I'm not against it. I've been
[25:01] amongst them. I've danced. You've seen
[25:03] me dance, worship the Lord. But if
[25:05] you're only emphasizing the shout and
[25:07] say that's the power. I wonder sometimes
[25:09] if there's not really walls of Jericho
[25:11] coming down in people's lives and it's
[25:14] got gossip and complainers and proud and
[25:16] boasters.
[25:18] They can't control their tongue from the
[25:19] corruption and things they talk about
[25:21] all week for six days. But oh on Sunday
[25:24] they sure shouted, "But what came out of
[25:26] your mouth the rest of the week?" God's
[25:27] calling for the high praises to be in
[25:29] our mouth.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Another level of praise, another level
[25:33] of communication. John Wesley is widely
[25:36] cited for his sermon the cure of evil
[25:38] speaking in which he defines the sin of
[25:42] evil speaking. It's a sin and offers a
[25:44] method for dealing with it. The most
[25:45] famous antidote, however, comes from a
[25:47] conversation where he responded to a
[25:49] woman boasting about her talent for
[25:52] speaking her mind. The famous antidote,
[25:54] a woman approached Wesley and stated she
[25:56] prided herself on speaking her mind,
[25:59] calling it her talent. And Wesley's
[26:01] famous reply was, "Well, ma'am, the Lord
[26:03] wouldn't mind if you buried that
[26:05] talent." Let's move to the next
[26:06] messenger, Martin Luther said this after
[26:09] John Wesley. Martin Luther said, "It is
[26:11] common pocious plague. It is a common
[26:14] penious plague that everyone would
[26:16] rather hear evil than good about their
[26:18] neighbors. Even though we ourselves are
[26:20] evil, we cannot tolerate it when anyone
[26:23] speaks evil of us. Instead, we want to
[26:26] hear the whole world say golden things
[26:29] of us. Yet we cannot bear it when
[26:32] someone says the best things about
[26:34] others.
[26:36] Those who are not content just to know
[26:39] but rush ahead and judge are called
[26:42] backbiters.
[26:45] Learning a bit of gossip about someone
[26:47] else, they spread it into every corner,
[26:50] relishing and delighting in the chance
[26:52] to stir up someone else's dirt like pigs
[26:56] that roll in the manure and root around
[26:58] in it with their snouts.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Now, you think I'm a hard preacher.
[27:03] Maybe you should have lived in the days
[27:04] of Luther.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; And he'll tell you what your gossip is.
[27:08] He'll tell you the stuff that comes out
[27:10] of your mouth and tell you that it's
[27:12] evil speaking.
[27:14] Paul called it in the Bible corrupt
[27:16] communication.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Negative communication.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; It's not edifiing. It's not building up.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; It's corrupt things coming out of your
[27:25] mouth. I'm going to issue a challenge as
[27:27] I close this service because I don't
[27:28] like the fact that we, you know, just
[27:31] come and hear a sermon. And I know the
[27:32] Holy Spirit has to do his work. Starting
[27:35] tomorrow, I'm going to challenge this
[27:36] congregation. A whole month of not one
[27:40] negative thing coming out of our mouth.
[27:42] I'm challenging because I think this is
[27:44] going to change more than what you
[27:46] realize.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; I think this is going to create
[27:49] atmospheres that you've never dreamed
[27:50] you'd see in domestic life, in family
[27:53] life, in whatever it is. It's going to
[27:56] change it. Your negative hasn't changed
[27:58] things,
[27:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[27:59] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; You're still the same. In some ways,
[28:00] you're still the same way you were. So,
[28:02] your negative confession hasn't changed,
[28:04] but you watch the power on your tongue
[28:05] of life
[28:07] &gt;&gt; and you watch it change things.
