Under My Feet

Lyrics:
Verse 1
You might not recognize me now
Those chains that once surrounded me, I lay them on the ground
You can't keep digging up my past
You may have had a laugh or two, but you won't get the last
You might not recognize me now

Chorus
And maybe I was blind, but now I see
Maybe I was bound, but now I'm free
Maybe you need reminding you're under my feet
And maybe you're a lie that I don't need
Maybe you should listen when I speak
Maybe you need reminding you're under my feet

Verse 2
If you want scars, I'll show you scars
All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark
If I were you, I'd be afraid
'Cause everything you meant for guilt
The cross has met with grace

Written by Zach Williams
