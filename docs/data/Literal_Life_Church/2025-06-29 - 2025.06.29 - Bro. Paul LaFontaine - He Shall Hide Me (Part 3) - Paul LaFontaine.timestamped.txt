[27:39] [Music]
[27:49] [Music]
[27:59] When we come together with our licks of
[28:03] fire,
[28:04] two or three gathered or more,
[28:09] all in your name, in one accord, you're
[28:14] gracious to meet us here, Lord.
[28:19] And then as I leave, I take you with me.
[28:24] I know what awaits past those doors.
[28:29] And I'll not take your presence for
[28:32] granted
[28:34] anymore.
[28:39] It's not just about the feeling,
[28:43] but I love to feel you.
[28:49] So many souls are seeking.
[28:53] They lack what matters most.
[28:58] Your mercy and grace has followed my
[29:02] days. I'm blessed just to be near you,
[29:05] Lord.
[29:08] And I'll not take your presence for
[29:10] granted
[29:13] anymore.
[29:14] [Music]
[29:18] Without a strong power to run to the
[29:21] hide. In my own strength, I'd fall prey
[29:27] to darkness and harm, fear over faith.
[29:32] But in you, I know I am safe.
[29:37] I can't imagine. I don't want to know
[29:41] what a life without you would afford.
[29:46] And I'll not take your presence for
[29:49] granted
[29:51] anymore.
[29:56] It's not just about a feeling,
[30:00] but I love to feel you close.
[30:06] So many souls are seeking.
[30:10] They lack what matters most.
[30:15] Your mercy and grace has followed my
[30:19] days. I'm blessed just to be near you,
[30:22] Lord.
[30:24] And I'll not take your presence for
[30:27] granted
[30:29] anymore.
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] On the wings of the morning, to the
[30:37] depths of the sea.
[30:39] Wherever I go, you are with me. Should I
[30:44] rise to the heavens, make my bed down in
[30:48] hell, still you are there,
[30:52] still with me. You dwell.
[30:58] It's not just about a feeling,
[31:03] but Lord, I love to feel you close.
[31:08] So many souls are seeking.
[31:13] They learn what matters most.
[31:18] Your mercy and grace has followed my
[31:21] days. I'm blessed just to be near you,
[31:25] Lord.
[31:27] And I'll not take your presence for
[31:30] granted.
[31:32] No, I'll not take your presence
[31:35] for granted. No, I'll not take your
[31:38] presence for granted
[31:42] [Music]
[31:44] anymore.
[31:46] [Music]
[31:55] Hallelujah.
[32:00] [Music]
[32:03] What a tremendous
[32:06] approach that Sherry and Wesley and
[32:09] Ashley has given us this morning to have
[32:12] that mindset why we come to church and
[32:16] that we don't take it for granted, his
[32:18] presence for granted. Can you say amen?
[32:20] I think that's the first brand new song
[32:22] and we're the first to hear it.
[32:26] Thank you, Sher. I appreciate it.
[32:27] Wonderful song. Praise the Lord. God
[32:29] bless you all this morning in Christian
[32:31] love. This is I'm reading this morning
[32:33] from Psalm 71. And we'll read the
[32:37] blessed word together. In thee, oh Lord,
[32:40] do I put my trust. Let me never be put
[32:44] to confusion. You know, when we're
[32:45] trusting the Lord completely, then we
[32:48] won't live in confusion. How many know
[32:50] the Bible says God is not the author of
[32:53] confusion? If you're confused, it comes
[32:56] from the enemy's side. It comes from the
[32:58] devil. God's not the author of
[33:00] confusion. And so when we put our trust
[33:02] in him, he said, "Let me never be put to
[33:05] confusion. Deliver me in thy
[33:08] righteousness, and cause me to escape.
[33:12] Incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
[33:15] Be thou my strong habitation wherein to
[33:19] I may continually. Everybody say
[33:22] continually.
[33:24] Continually resort. We'll talk about
[33:26] that in a minute. But David said,
[33:28] "You're my habitation. You're that place
[33:31] that I want to go to. You're the place I
[33:33] want to default to, and I don't want to
[33:35] just go there every uh few months when I
[33:37] need it. I want to continually resort to
[33:41] this habitation. I want to continually
[33:43] to default into this secret place.
[33:46] That's the way we want to live
[33:48] continually. May I continually resort,
[33:50] thou hast given commandment to save me,
[33:53] for thou art my rock and my fortress.
[33:58] Can you imagine? God has given a
[34:01] commandment to save you from whatever
[34:03] you need to be saved from. It's not you
[34:05] go saving yourself. It's not you run
[34:07] into something you don't get no help.
[34:09] He's already got a commandment. He's got
[34:11] a word over your life. He's got a
[34:13] covenant over your life. And God's
[34:15] covenants cannot be broken that he makes
[34:17] himself. You remember the covenant he
[34:19] made with Abraham. He says, "I will do
[34:21] this. I will do this. I will do this."
[34:22] First one he made with man. It was like
[34:24] a deal. If I do this, will you do this,
[34:27] Adam? If I do this, and man always
[34:28] fails. When he come to Abraham and says,
[34:30] "I'm going to bless you. I'm going to
[34:32] give you a land. I'm going to do this."
[34:34] And that's the covenant. It's not it's
[34:36] not contingent upon your mistakes. God
[34:40] will hold his covenant over you your
[34:42] whole life and God will fulfill his
[34:45] covenant. God has a commandment over
[34:48] your life to save you. And if we have
[34:51] that assurance, then we ought to just
[34:53] rest in that rock and that fortress that
[34:55] he has given us. Can you say amen? Lord,
[34:58] bless your word today. Father, these
[35:00] souls are have been purchased at the
[35:02] great price at Calvary. They're not my
[35:05] people. They're your people, Lord. And
[35:07] so you know them and you know what to
[35:09] do, Father, to be able to give them the
[35:11] word that's in season to be able to
[35:13] bless their lives. We pray, Father, that
[35:15] you meet us today and you fill this
[35:18] house with your glory in Jesus name.
[35:20] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated,
[35:23] friends.
[35:24] We're going to pick up where we left off
[35:26] in talking a little bit about he shall
[35:28] hide me. He shall hide me. And this will
[35:31] be part three. And we want to talk a
[35:32] little bit about these different
[35:34] scriptures. And we David is the one in
[35:37] the Bible we said that wrote so much
[35:39] about this mystery of a hiding place in
[35:42] Christ. Even though he didn't fully have
[35:44] access to it in mystery, he began to
[35:47] write about it. He began to know about
[35:48] it. And and uh the reason that he wrote
[35:51] about it is some of the reason he wrote
[35:52] about it is God allowed experiences
[35:55] in David's life to teach him that there
[35:58] is really at the end of the day there's
[36:00] really only one place to run into where
[36:03] we are safe. And David was allowed to go
[36:07] through many experiences in his story
[36:10] that taught them. He he learned a lot,
[36:12] but he really learned and that's why
[36:14] David kept referring to a rock, a
[36:17] fortress, a hiding place, a secret
[36:20] place, a secret place of his tabernacle.
[36:23] That's just some of the terms he used.
[36:24] And he mentioned those terms more than
[36:26] anybody in the Bible because God allowed
[36:29] him to go through experiences that he
[36:31] learned. There is a place to go to.
[36:34] There is a place of safety. There is a
[36:37] place that is a default place that today
[36:40] especially friends we need to know that
[36:43] every time something comes up in life
[36:45] there's one place that we run to it's
[36:48] not something of the world but we run it
[36:50] back into this place with Christ
[36:53] and so but there was a lot of things
[36:56] that taught David that run to that place
[36:58] but the fact is we learn too in our
[37:00] lives and we learn by seeing all the
[37:03] places that we run to. One of the things
[37:05] I'd like to us to learn and and to
[37:07] ponder in this is that we begin to see
[37:10] in our life especially as we go down the
[37:12] road the places that we develop that we
[37:14] run into uh that we escape into that we
[37:18] go into we run and we learn all those
[37:21] places fail us all those places are not
[37:24] assur assuring all those places aren't
[37:26] the protection that God gives and so
[37:29] then a lot of times it really funny on
[37:31] Friday night we had a really nice
[37:32] conversation with the young people nice
[37:34] youth meeting here at the church and our
[37:37] subject was tattoos. And we only have
[37:40] one scripture to go on, but I wanted the
[37:41] young people to not only know that there
[37:44] is a scripture that God proclaims it's
[37:46] wrong to do your body that way, but also
[37:48] not just that lesson, but are you
[37:50] willing to take one scripture in the
[37:52] Bible that speaks the mind of Christ
[37:54] about it? Are you willing to take that
[37:56] one scripture and say, "If God says it
[37:58] and it's important to him, I'll take
[38:00] that one scripture. It's good enough for
[38:02] me." There's a lot of people today who
[38:03] say that's Old Testament or you know
[38:06] that I need 10 scriptures in order to
[38:08] believe it. Uh I think we should value
[38:10] what God says. Can you say amen that
[38:13] there's a meaning to it and there's a
[38:14] purpose and incidentally in that case we
[38:16] realize it is significant today.
[38:19] Sometimes God says something and then
[38:21] the prophet reaches here in this modern
[38:23] age and he reaches back and grabs a
[38:25] scripture and brings it forward. Why?
[38:27] Because we need it in this society. We
[38:30] need it in this culture and something
[38:32] that looks irrelevant to the world and
[38:34] sometimes to denominations they've wrote
[38:36] it off becomes significant for our
[38:39] lives. Why? Because God knows exactly
[38:42] what we need in the time we leave live
[38:44] in. And so, you know, we run to places
[38:47] that fail sometimes. And we were talking
[38:49] about how uh people, you know, they they
[38:52] do that all the reasons. And the young
[38:54] people were so great at bringing up all
[38:56] the reasons if we've asked people, if we
[38:58] haven't asked, what's the purpose in
[38:59] this? Why do you want to do your body
[39:01] this way? And the reason I talked about
[39:03] it, I'm seeing more and more of this all
[39:05] the time. I've never seen so many people
[39:07] putting on more tattoos. And it's kind
[39:09] of like men are craving something to be
[39:11] approved, to be accepted. They look on
[39:14] the internet, say to be uh to get that
[39:16] satisfaction of being accepted, then I'm
[39:18] going to do this. and that it didn't
[39:20] bring the satisfaction because now they
[39:22] got to go get another tattoo. Now they
[39:24] got to do something else that makes them
[39:26] weird. I was telling the young people
[39:27] about a man in the restaurant the other
[39:29] day that I see they had three horns
[39:31] sticking out of his chin. And uh I said,
[39:33] "All right, you know, I don't know
[39:35] what's happening there." Uh but I can
[39:37] tell you the young people helped me and
[39:39] I believe I helped them to be able to
[39:41] understand the meaning behind this. I
[39:43] would never criticize somebody like
[39:44] that. I have to preach the gospel. I
[39:46] have to remind them of the word. But
[39:48] there's definitely something wrong and
[39:50] they're tapping into another dimension
[39:53] that's not the dimension of God that's
[39:55] leading them to this will bring you
[39:58] satisfaction. And guess what? Every
[40:00] time, even in the things that we choose
[40:03] to run to, it fails.
[40:07] And that's a good thing because every
[40:10] time we learn, there's only one place
[40:12] that we can come and get true
[40:14] satisfaction. That's right. And when
[40:16] we're running from something, then we
[40:18] want to choose the place that that's
[40:20] really safe, that's really protected.
[40:23] There there are two things that I want
[40:24] to probe at this morning a little bit is
[40:26] that we all run from things. We are all
[40:29] prone to run from things. We all tend to
[40:33] in our human nature to run from stuff.
[40:37] But then we all choose things to run to
[40:40] something that we run to. So, how many
[40:42] would all agree that's the way we are in
[40:44] our human nature? When trouble come,
[40:47] when people treat us wrong, we have a
[40:50] nature about us that we mostly will run.
[40:52] They have a thing called fight or
[40:54] flight. We either fight for ourselves or
[40:57] we'll run away. A lot of times we run
[40:59] away. We don't want the the the
[41:01] confrontation. We don't want to do that,
[41:02] but we run. We run in our nature and we
[41:05] all run to something that we think
[41:08] probably will be our escape. David says
[41:11] here in Psalm 71, "Lord, I want you to
[41:14] be my ultimate escape. I want you to
[41:18] become my escape. I want you to be the
[41:20] one that I run to."
[41:24] Is he the one you run to when you want
[41:28] to go hide?
[41:32] I love when Brother Homer was preaching
[41:34] Sunday morning. You know, I love when
[41:35] people get old and they just say things
[41:37] cuz they don't care anymore. And he
[41:39] watched Saturday night. Brother Diggs
[41:40] running all over this place. Matter of
[41:42] fact, this platform and everything
[41:44] actually when we were designing it, it
[41:46] was with Brother Diggs in mind and it's
[41:49] still not enough room for him. But
[41:50] brother Homer, you know, he's just
[41:51] saying that guy runs. He says, "I'm just
[41:53] letting you know." I just loved how he
[41:54] said it. He says, "I ain't going to be
[41:56] running like that like brother Diggs."
[41:58] And he says, "If you do see me running,"
[42:00] he said, "I'm running from something
[42:02] from somebody." That's what he said. I
[42:04] thought that was funny. He said, "Unless
[42:05] something is chasing me, I'm not going
[42:07] to be running from that." But we run
[42:09] from and we avoid a lot of things in
[42:11] life. And even Christians sometimes are
[42:14] running from something. They're avoiding
[42:16] talking about something. They're
[42:18] avoiding things. And they'll go for
[42:19] years running from something. And and
[42:21] then we have to bring up the prophet
[42:24] Jonah. Here's uh one thing that he said
[42:26] about Jonah. Brother Bram said about
[42:28] Jonah. And and notice that he some he
[42:30] noticed something he was running from.
[42:32] And that was and I want you to notice
[42:34] what it was. Jonah, he was not a back,
[42:37] he was not backslid as we would think he
[42:39] was, but he was running from the
[42:41] responsibility and the presence of the
[42:43] Lord. I want you to remember that he was
[42:45] running from the presence of the Lord.
[42:49] And brother Brandon preached that
[42:50] running from the presence of the Lord.
[42:52] And then you remember he says Jonah is a
[42:55] type of us all. So don't be so critical
[42:57] of Jonah because we know he's a type of
[43:00] us all. He's a He reflects how we are
[43:03] sometimes and we tend to run. I'm going
[43:06] to read what he says here in the quote,
[43:07] but I want you to remember what did he
[43:09] run from? It's interesting. Brother
[43:11] Brandham called it the presence of the
[43:12] Lord. He received a commission, a
[43:14] calling. Go tell the Ninevites and get
[43:16] them to repent and preach the the
[43:18] message to them. But what was he running
[43:20] from? The presence of the Lord. When you
[43:22] run from the responsibility of what the
[43:24] word is being presented to you even
[43:26] today, then it's not you're running from
[43:28] Paul Fontaine. It's not that you're
[43:30] running from some religion, but you're
[43:32] running from the presence of the Lord
[43:34] because in the word is the presence of
[43:36] the Lord. And as Sher Song said, we
[43:39] never want to take it for granted. Can
[43:41] you say amen? We don't want to do that
[43:42] anymore because we could be a Jonah
[43:45] that's running from the presence of the
[43:46] Lord. In the presence of the Lord is
[43:49] where we need to be and where we need to
[43:51] live. And Jonah, you know, think about,
[43:53] you know, I try to be nice to him, but
[43:55] and I've said before that I need to
[43:57] apologize to him because some of the
[43:59] sermons I've been pretty critical. Jon
[44:01] Jonah only has four chapters on his
[44:03] life, but sure has provided a lot of
[44:06] sermons for me in that short four
[44:08] chapters. I'll tell you, there's a lot
[44:10] of sermons it's provided.
[44:12] Praise the Lord. Some of you have
[44:14] provided a lot of sermons as well.
[44:19] Amen. I just leave it there. You know,
[44:22] my family provides me sermons as well,
[44:24] but I'll just leave that there. But
[44:25] brother Bram said, Jonah here was called
[44:27] on this as this one of the minor
[44:29] prophets of the Bible to go down into
[44:31] this city. And here we find an example
[44:33] of us all. Every one of us, we we always
[44:36] are running for something. Every one of
[44:38] us, we run from trouble. We run from
[44:41] responsibilities. We're all prone to do
[44:44] that. Now, he's talking about our human
[44:46] nature. And if we let our human nature
[44:49] rule, we tend to run from things. We run
[44:53] from trouble. He says uh we we uh we run
[44:58] uh how does he say here? We're we're all
[44:59] prone we run from responsibilities.
[45:01] We're all prone to do that. We are more
[45:03] prone to run than we are to stand and
[45:05] face it out. And we find ourselves
[45:07] running. Sometimes we uh find ourselves
[45:10] prone to run from work. We don't want
[45:12] to. We don't want to work. Some people
[45:14] just think they can make a living
[45:15] without working. But I think Solomon it
[45:18] was said that we could find the answer
[45:20] in watching the ant. You know a little
[45:22] ant they tell me if that ant doesn't
[45:23] work and lay in that ant doesn't eat
[45:25] that winter either. So so everybody has
[45:27] to work. We got so many things that we
[45:30] have to do. So much responsibility that
[45:32] we have to face. Everybody has got to
[45:34] face a certain responsibility. And when
[45:38] you come to choose your wife to get
[45:40] married or choose your husband you've
[45:42] got to take a responsibility. And then
[45:44] you must remember maybe you build a
[45:47] home. It's a nice pretty home. And then
[45:49] remember as a married woman you got to
[45:52] think of the responsibility of raising
[45:53] children. Can I get an amen this
[45:55] morning? You're going to get married.
[45:57] You're going to have children. Well, you
[45:58] take the responsibility of those ch
[46:00] children. Becomes a priority. And you
[46:02] can't run from that. A lot of people run
[46:04] from it. They'll send it to somebody
[46:06] else to take care of it. Whatever it is.
[46:08] But you see, the responsibility falls
[46:10] back on the parents to be able to raise
[46:12] the child, but also raise them in the
[46:14] admonition of the Lord. It's a
[46:17] responsibility God gives us. It's not a
[46:19] bondage. It's a responsibility God's
[46:22] given us. And actually, you should look
[46:24] at it this way. You can affect the
[46:25] future by training your kids in the
[46:27] Lord. That even with your failures, you
[46:30] can point them to the word of God and
[46:32] the next generation can be better than
[46:34] this one. That's that's pretty powerful.
[46:38] He said, ' Maybe you build a home. It's
[46:39] a nice pretty home. And then remember,
[46:41] as a married woman, you got to think of
[46:42] the responsibility of raising children.
[46:44] You got to think of them pretty slick
[46:46] walls is going to have little dirty
[46:48] handprints all over them.
[46:51] I got a couple grandkids living with me,
[46:53] so I could say amen to that. Then you
[46:55] got the responsibility of educating your
[46:57] children. You got the responsibility of
[46:58] clothing and feeding. Everything is a
[47:00] responsibility. And it's so easy when
[47:03] the responsibilities face us to sherk
[47:05] from them. And we find out that marriage
[47:08] is a responsibility in all manners. Even
[47:11] many times, this is hard to say, but
[47:14] it's God when they're, excuse me, this
[47:16] is hard to say, but that ministers many
[47:18] times sherk a responsibility for
[47:21] standing for the true word of God when
[47:24] they're confronted with it. They'll
[47:26] sherk their responsibility. When the
[47:28] truth of the word of God is brought face
[47:30] to face with we human beings, we are
[47:32] prone to sherk back until the last
[47:34] resort. But to face up the
[47:35] responsibility. Sometime it takes
[47:37] sometimes it takes the very height off
[47:39] of us to do that. And a and as a father
[47:42] to face the responsibility to give your
[47:45] children a whipping them little fellas,
[47:47] you don't want to do that. But as a
[47:49] father or mother, you've got to face the
[47:51] responsibility of raising that child
[47:53] because the Bible said, "Spare the rod
[47:55] and you'll or you'll spoil your son."
[47:59] And that still stands good in the sight
[48:01] of every psychologist there is in the
[48:03] world. That still remains God's truth.
[48:07] I I ought to hear amens out of everybody
[48:10] who believes the Bible right now. It's
[48:12] still the truth. Raise them in the
[48:13] admonition of the Lord. And if you spare
[48:16] the rod, you'll spoil the child.
[48:19] Praise the Lord. Well, my some of you
[48:21] still ain't going to say amen to that.
[48:23] That's all right. And so, it still
[48:25] stands good in the sight of every
[48:26] psychologist in the world. That still
[48:28] remains God's truth. If there has been
[48:30] more of that practice, we wouldn't have
[48:32] so much juvenile delinquency and stuff
[48:33] and the rot that we got in the world
[48:35] today. But the old golden rule of the
[48:37] home has been broken long time ago and
[48:39] they let the kids do whatever they want
[48:40] to. But even as I said, ministers,
[48:42] they'll come face to face with truth and
[48:45] then walk away from it. They're just
[48:47] there seems to be this that something
[48:49] that they don't want to face up to it.
[48:51] Many times I've had people come and say,
[48:52] "I know that's right, Brother Brandham,
[48:54] but if I did that, they would kick me
[48:56] out of my church. What of it? If you
[49:00] don't, you're going to be kicked out
[49:02] anyhow there. So, you got to be kicked
[49:05] out of something. Uh, I think he's
[49:07] referring to heaven. Kicked out up
[49:09] there. So, you got to be kicked out
[49:11] somewhere. So, you might as well face up
[49:13] to it instead of what? Running from it.
[49:18] So, he's addressing the problem in human
[49:20] nature
[49:22] to run from something, to run from
[49:25] responsibility. But when the word comes
[49:28] with with the word comes a
[49:30] responsibility
[49:32] and that's one thing we never want to
[49:34] run from.
[49:37] We are prone he says we are bent towards
[49:40] running from things. It's human nature.
[49:44] But then it it's it's you know if we're
[49:46] going to run sometimes it's it's what we
[49:49] run to that counts. It's what we run to.
[49:52] Sometimes we run into something else
[49:55] that's not Christ and then it turns out
[49:58] worse. How many has ever experienced
[50:00] that you run to something thinking
[50:02] that's the answer and you find out it
[50:04] everything turns out worse than what it
[50:06] was at the beginning because you ran to
[50:08] the wrong thing.
[50:12] Why does it turn out we didn't run to
[50:14] Christ but why did it turn out we ran to
[50:16] the wrong thing? We escape, but we
[50:19] escape into the wrong thing or things.
[50:22] If we run, we should run into something
[50:25] that God has provided. I trust you're
[50:28] listening to me this morning because we
[50:30] live in Leodysia. We live in the closing
[50:33] seconds of time. And I have never seen
[50:35] so many things offered to us, even
[50:39] believers, that are escapes, that are
[50:41] things to run into. There are things to
[50:43] relieve our nerves. There are things
[50:45] that we got away because the trouble is
[50:47] too much. I know there's some out there
[50:49] they're turn they'll turn to drinking to
[50:51] relieve their nerves. They'll turn to
[50:53] smoking to relieve their nerves.
[50:54] Christians, they they don't want to do
[50:56] that. They want to put that aside. But
[50:58] even Christians that don't smoke or
[51:00] drink, you better be aware of all of
[51:03] Satan's devices that we're running to
[51:06] something where we should be running to
[51:08] that secret place.
[51:11] I could take another sermon on all the
[51:13] things that we run to. I can name them.
[51:15] All the things that we run to that are
[51:17] our satisfaction. And many times we run
[51:20] because we're having trouble. Someone
[51:22] doesn't like us. Something happened.
[51:23] Some people are still running from their
[51:25] past. They're still running from it.
[51:27] They're not facing it. They're not bring
[51:28] it to the Lord. They're not finding
[51:30] deliverance over it. They're still
[51:32] running from their past.
[51:38] So, we tend to run to the wrong thing.
[51:41] We escape but we escape into the wrong
[51:43] thing or things. And if we run, then we
[51:46] should run into something God has
[51:49] provided a place of strength that the
[51:52] next time if we run into Christ's place
[51:55] of strength in that secret place that
[51:57] that habitation of a a a rock in in a
[52:01] weary land, a place of strength that the
[52:04] next we should run into a place of
[52:06] strength from the Lord so that the next
[52:09] time we face things, we face it better.
[52:14] Amen.
[52:16] This is what David found. This is what
[52:18] he learned. People
[52:21] will treat you a certain way. You will
[52:23] have ups and downs in life. And when
[52:26] that happens, it creates emotional
[52:30] instability. You don't feel stable. You
[52:32] don't feel you feel the ground is
[52:34] shaking a little bit. You feel uh not
[52:37] not physically, but your emotions are
[52:39] are instable because we are emotional
[52:42] people. God knew that. God understood
[52:46] that we are an emotional people and so
[52:48] Satan abuses that to like life will
[52:51] happen. Satan will do things. But even
[52:54] life itself and the way people treat you
[52:57] and the way things people say about you
[52:59] and the unrealistic expectations of
[53:02] people all can create emotional
[53:05] instability in our lives. And when we
[53:08] begin to run from that instability to
[53:10] something else instead of Christ, then
[53:12] we find we can find we we we can realize
[53:15] even more emotional instability and it
[53:18] doesn't get any better. But we should
[53:20] run into a quiet place with him because
[53:24] we know that that is going to bring
[53:27] stability emotionally. Couple years ago,
[53:30] I preached on where we find emotional
[53:32] stability. And I read the scriptures to
[53:34] show that there's a place
[53:37] there's a place that I'm preaching that
[53:39] you can run to
[53:42] stabilize things
[53:44] to make things more consistent to just
[53:47] to to to rest. The Christian life is
[53:50] based solidly upon rest.
[53:54] Rest in what God does. rest in the word
[53:57] that he said from the beginning. He he
[53:59] said, brother uh Stephen said it uh
[54:01] Wednesday night is that even God rested
[54:03] from his own works. He spoke it. Once
[54:05] the word was spoken, he had such
[54:07] confidence in what was spoken. He rested
[54:09] the seventh day. All the works were
[54:11] finished before before the foundation of
[54:13] the world. But when he spoke it, it was
[54:14] really settled. He could rest completely
[54:17] in his own word. And now we can rest in
[54:20] God's word and find a place of rest when
[54:24] ships are tossed. When our life is
[54:26] tossed, when people have persecuted you
[54:29] and spoken wrong things against you,
[54:32] when you have done wrong things to other
[54:34] people, you can feel unsettled about it.
[54:36] But there's a place of repentance and
[54:38] there's a place of rest that brings
[54:40] emotional stability.
[54:45] A secret quiet place. The seventh seal
[54:48] is symbolized by silence.
[54:51] And when he opened the seventh seal,
[54:54] there was silence in heavens for about
[54:56] the space of a half hour. The seventh
[54:59] seal is symbolized by silence. And in
[55:02] that silence, the mysteries are
[55:04] revealed.
[55:06] In that silence, all the mysteries are
[55:08] revealed. In that silence, God whispers
[55:12] his secrets to the bride. In this place,
[55:15] in this silence, in this seventh seal of
[55:17] the coming of the Lord, it's a place
[55:19] that the bride has spoken to secrets
[55:22] from her groom, Christ. And it's not to
[55:25] everybody else. It's for the bride
[55:27] herself. The way the prophet said,
[55:28] that's what God Christ is doing to the
[55:30] church right now. He is letting her know
[55:33] the secrets. When the word was open 1963
[55:37] until today, the seventh seal was open
[55:40] to us. The word is open to bring us to a
[55:42] rapture. But what opened to us? A place,
[55:45] a place where the secrets are whispered
[55:48] to his bride. And when we're in there
[55:51] and he whispers those secret, it's
[55:53] stability. It's peace. I'm going in a
[55:56] rapture. I don't know if it's to today
[55:58] or 10 years from now, but I know I'm
[56:00] going cuz he has spoken my peace into my
[56:03] life by the word. He spoke peace to the
[56:06] bride. He spoke stability. I've said it
[56:09] before. Husbands can create stability in
[56:12] their family or they can create
[56:13] instability by their doubts, by their
[56:16] fears, by their inconsistency. You don't
[56:18] have the family in church once a month,
[56:20] whatever it is. And the whole family
[56:22] feels unstable because daddy is not
[56:24] creating stability. Our great daddy, our
[56:27] great Christ, our husband, when he went
[56:29] to Calvary, he created the greatest
[56:32] stability for the bride ever before.
[56:35] that we rest not in our own works, but
[56:37] we rest in a finished work of Calvary.
[56:40] He's already done it. He's already paid
[56:44] the price.
[56:46] Tell the devil, "It's as good as done.
[56:48] I'm not looking at my mistakes today.
[56:50] I'm bringing them under the blood. But
[56:51] as far as where I'm going, I know where
[56:54] I came from and I know where I'm going."
[56:56] Didn't Jesus say that? Didn't he say, "I
[57:00] come from God. I go to God. I know where
[57:02] I come from and so I know where I'm
[57:04] going. If Jesus had that revelation, the
[57:07] bride has that revelation. I've been
[57:09] told where I came from and knowing where
[57:11] I come from, I know where I'm going.
[57:15] It creates stability. Our groom Jesus
[57:18] Christ creates stability and peace,
[57:22] consistency.
[57:23] The Christian life is based upon rest in
[57:27] that secret place. The work's already
[57:29] done.
[57:31] And there isn't any turbulence
[57:34] in this life no matter what happens.
[57:37] I've preached to people here for 36
[57:39] years and I never seen such things hits
[57:41] their life that you go oh no you one
[57:47] thing you say they don't they didn't
[57:48] deserve that. It seemed like somebody
[57:50] else deserved that. Some rotten person,
[57:52] you know, that that's lived. Here's a
[57:54] faithful Christian to the Lord and
[57:57] something strikes their life or those
[58:00] that family, those kids' life they never
[58:02] expected.
[58:04] We're living in that hour. And that's
[58:07] why I create keep preaching. Are you
[58:10] listening? There's a place that you can
[58:12] run to.
[58:14] I can't change situations.
[58:17] I can't change what's happened to you,
[58:20] but I can point you to a secret place.
[58:24] I can point you to a place that has
[58:26] rapturing faith. This was amazing. Smith
[58:28] Smith Wigglesworth, a great preacher. He
[58:31] said, "It is in the secret place." Smith
[58:35] Wigglesworth said, "It is in the secret
[58:37] place where God begins to unfold his
[58:41] mysteries to your spirit. It is in the
[58:44] secret place where you get to discover.
[58:48] These are wonderful words. It is in the
[58:50] secret place where you get to discover
[58:52] who you are in Christ. People will
[58:54] wonder where you get your boldness, your
[58:56] understanding, your peace of your heart.
[58:59] The secret place is the place where you
[59:01] get to study the word, meditate on the
[59:04] word, pray it through into your spirit
[59:06] man. It is a place of honor. It is a
[59:09] place of glory, a place where things are
[59:11] created. Can you say amen? What a place.
[59:16] A place where things are created and
[59:18] called forth. Many of us today have
[59:20] forsaken the secret place and are busy
[59:23] chasing after the shadow,
[59:27] leaving the real substance behind. We
[59:29] need to get back to the secret place and
[59:31] build ourselves in the most holy faith
[59:35] through the word and prayers.
[59:38] Let Smith Wigglesworth
[59:41] correct us and set us on the right
[59:42] course. We get so busy we'll choose
[59:45] something shallow or choose a shadow.
[59:48] Listen, you don't have to choose a
[59:50] shadow. You can choose the realities of
[59:52] God.
[59:56] With David, what he learned is he
[59:58] didn't, you know, David, he didn't run
[1:00:00] from the enemy. He didn't run from
[1:00:01] Goliath. He ran towards Goliath. So, we
[1:00:04] were talking about when David, it was uh
[1:00:07] He it what David was running from many
[1:00:10] times is not the enemy, but it was
[1:00:12] running in the first case with from a
[1:00:15] backsliden believer that turned against
[1:00:18] him.
[1:00:20] A man in authority, a man who was God's
[1:00:22] anointed, a man who was in the king of
[1:00:26] Israel. It was him who turned against
[1:00:29] David. There's not too many things that
[1:00:31] cut to the core of hurtful situation.
[1:00:35] than someone within the body of Christ
[1:00:37] or some preacher that says the kind of
[1:00:39] words to be a Saul to you and to hurt
[1:00:42] you and actually to try to kill your
[1:00:44] influence as Saul tried to kill David.
[1:00:46] And all this time David's learning, I
[1:00:49] need a place to run to. I need to get
[1:00:50] away with it because I can't really come
[1:00:52] against God's anointed. And so he was in
[1:00:54] there playing music and anointed in
[1:00:56] music actually relieved Saul of his evil
[1:00:59] spirits that had got actually from the
[1:01:01] Lord because he had been rebellious. God
[1:01:03] sent that. He allowed evil spirits to
[1:01:05] come to him. Then they bring in David.
[1:01:07] He plays anointed music. It refreshes
[1:01:09] him. He gets re relieved temporarily.
[1:01:12] But in those moments, he comes around
[1:01:14] the corner throwing javelins. Throwing
[1:01:17] javelins at the new anointed. The the
[1:01:19] David David didn't do anything wrong,
[1:01:22] but he's throwing javelins. And it's
[1:01:23] coming from somebody within the body of
[1:01:26] Christ.
[1:01:28] I'm calling it that to bring it up to
[1:01:30] date. It's coming from God's anointed
[1:01:32] king before. It's coming from a
[1:01:35] preacher.
[1:01:38] Do I have your ear this morning?
[1:01:41] These things are more trying sometimes
[1:01:45] than receiving persecution from the
[1:01:47] world.
[1:01:50] When I receive the criticism of lies
[1:01:53] that are told about me, it hurts more
[1:01:55] when it comes within our own ranks. It
[1:01:57] I'm just being honest with you. It
[1:01:59] hurts. I don't understand some of it. I
[1:02:02] thought Brother Bram says elect was not
[1:02:04] supposed to persecute elect. True. I'll
[1:02:06] never put them out of the kingdom. But
[1:02:08] that's what he said. Elect does not
[1:02:10] persecute elect. And yet a Saul rises up
[1:02:14] and he rebelss against God. Takes a
[1:02:16] wrong spirit. You know what he turns his
[1:02:18] javelin towards? He turns it to some
[1:02:20] somebody God is beginning to work with
[1:02:23] and anoint and be refreshed until the
[1:02:26] Goliath. And Saul gets jealous of that.
[1:02:29] And instead of saying, "I submit. I'm
[1:02:31] going to come to your church and I'm
[1:02:33] going to say David is the God's man and
[1:02:36] I'm going to submit myself to it." He
[1:02:37] turns his javelin and starts throwing
[1:02:40] pot shots at David. True. That's what
[1:02:44] David dealt with. Could speak a lot more
[1:02:46] about it, but a man who wanted to kill
[1:02:48] him and kill his influence. It was an
[1:02:50] internal pressure that affected David
[1:02:52] most. Not the Goliaths of life. Listen
[1:02:55] now. God gives us strength many times to
[1:02:58] defeat the Goliath of life. You should
[1:03:00] never be afraid of a Goliath. Can you
[1:03:02] say amen? God has called you against the
[1:03:04] Goliath of life. I tell young people,
[1:03:07] listen now. David was on the back side
[1:03:09] of the desert and he was training when
[1:03:11] there was a bear, when there was a lion,
[1:03:13] and he took him. He was gaining
[1:03:15] testimonies cuz someday he didn't know
[1:03:17] he was going to meet a Goliath.
[1:03:19] God was teaching that man as he was
[1:03:21] young as he teaches young young people
[1:03:24] how to get a hold of God. How to get in
[1:03:26] the presence of God, how to get into my
[1:03:28] Bible. What are you doing young people?
[1:03:30] Are you in your phone all day? Get into
[1:03:32] their Bible. Get into the word of God.
[1:03:35] Why you got time? Because if you get
[1:03:37] married, your time's cut in half.
[1:03:41] With each kid, the pie's cut even more.
[1:03:44] You don't have time hardly at all to
[1:03:47] have those moments to be alone with God.
[1:03:49] And when you were single, you got them
[1:03:50] all. Don't waste those moments with God.
[1:03:53] And David spent time with God. He
[1:03:55] learned about the anointing. He learned
[1:03:57] how to sing under the anointing. He
[1:03:59] learned how to drive away evil spirits.
[1:04:01] You don't think God's doing something in
[1:04:03] your life right now, young people, and
[1:04:04] the trials you're going through. He's
[1:04:06] training you. How do I get in the
[1:04:08] spirit? How do I learn how to defeat the
[1:04:10] enemy? How do I kill this lion? He's
[1:04:13] preparing you for the Goliaths that are
[1:04:16] coming in your life.
[1:04:19] Praise be to God. He's preparing you for
[1:04:21] the Goliaths. And God gives the
[1:04:24] strength. But there's nothing ever more
[1:04:26] so confusing. Seems like not a Goliath,
[1:04:30] but fighting being falsely accused,
[1:04:32] fighting jealousy from others, cruelty
[1:04:35] from others, unfair conclusions about
[1:04:38] oursel. It was a a bitter, unsatisfied
[1:04:42] king. It's bitter, unsatisfied people
[1:04:46] that was the challenge. It's bitter
[1:04:48] people in their life. They've always
[1:04:50] been bitter and they haven't overcome
[1:04:51] it. It's those bitter people that'll
[1:04:53] take shots at you. And you know what it
[1:04:55] is? They want to make you bitter, too.
[1:05:01] And David said, "Lord, help me. Hide me.
[1:05:04] Let me run from this spirit because I
[1:05:07] may not be perfect, but I don't want to
[1:05:09] become a Saul.
[1:05:12] Can I get an amen this morning? God,
[1:05:14] help me in my character. I don't want to
[1:05:17] become a Saul. David had his mistakes.
[1:05:20] David was young. David wasn't perfect by
[1:05:23] any means, but he fought against
[1:05:26] becoming. He ran from I don't want to
[1:05:28] hang around that because I don't want to
[1:05:30] become a Saul.
[1:05:32] In the message, we have Sauls.
[1:05:35] In the message ranks, we have David's.
[1:05:37] We have Saul's. We have two different
[1:05:39] types of leadership. I trust you'll
[1:05:41] choose the Davids in your life because
[1:05:43] the under the leadership of David's, you
[1:05:45] will come into the character for a
[1:05:47] kingdom age. Can you say amen? If you're
[1:05:49] under the ministry of a Saul who has
[1:05:51] become bitter, you'll become that
[1:05:53] yourself.
[1:05:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:06:03] David wanted to run. I read the
[1:06:04] scriptures to you if you guys want to
[1:06:05] put them up in the back there. The
[1:06:07] scriptures what David had wanted to be
[1:06:08] delivered from. Psalm 64:2, "Hide me
[1:06:11] from the secret counsel of the wicked,
[1:06:14] from the insurrection of workers of
[1:06:15] iniquity." In the amplified, it says,
[1:06:17] "Hide me from the secret counsel and
[1:06:19] conspiracy of the ungodly, from the
[1:06:21] scheming of those who do wrong." These
[1:06:23] are the things David asked, "Hide me
[1:06:25] from that." Psalms 31:15, "Deld deliver
[1:06:27] me from the hand of mine enemies and
[1:06:29] from them that persecute me." Psalms
[1:06:31] 43:1, "Oh, deliver me from the deceitful
[1:06:34] and unjust man," which means dishonest
[1:06:37] people who tell lies. Psalms 51:14,
[1:06:41] "Deliver me from blood guiltiness." What
[1:06:43] does that mean? It means guilt. In other
[1:06:45] words, deliver me from guilt. Uh David
[1:06:48] had guilt from the sin that he did. Can
[1:06:50] you say amen? David had guilt. And so if
[1:06:53] you put guilt on yourself or the devil
[1:06:56] puts guilt on you or other people in
[1:06:59] your life become professionals at laying
[1:07:03] guilt trips on you.
[1:07:05] I don't know. Maybe I need to slow down
[1:07:07] here. I I I listen.
[1:07:10] We're not supposed to live under any
[1:07:11] guilt.
[1:07:13] Calvar's delivered us from guilt. Can I
[1:07:16] get an amen? You bring it underneath the
[1:07:19] blood of God. But one thing the devil
[1:07:21] does is when something's underneath the
[1:07:22] blood of God, Satan still uses
[1:07:25] condemnation and guilt to keep a
[1:07:27] Christian defeated. Once you put it
[1:07:29] under the blood, you believe it's under
[1:07:31] the blood. It's in the sea of
[1:07:32] forgetfulness, and I will not allow a
[1:07:35] residual guilt and condemnation to hang
[1:07:38] over my life. Satan, you won't do it.
[1:07:41] That's one of the things David needed
[1:07:43] deliverance from. He said, "Deliver me
[1:07:45] from blood guiltiness." He experienced
[1:07:47] what guilt was and he asked God to
[1:07:49] deliver him. Psalms 59:1, deliver me
[1:07:52] from my enemies. Oh my God, defend me
[1:07:54] from them that rise up against me.
[1:07:56] Psalms 59:2, deliver me from the workers
[1:08:00] of iniquity and save me from bloody men.
[1:08:03] Psalms 119:134, deliver me from the
[1:08:06] oppression of man. Isn't that amazing
[1:08:08] that men other men can bring oppression?
[1:08:14] I wonder if a lot of our depression is
[1:08:16] comparing ourselves with others and
[1:08:18] other people are being allowed in our
[1:08:20] lives to make us depressed.
[1:08:25] If you struggle with depression, it
[1:08:26] might be guilt in your own life. I don't
[1:08:28] know what it is, but many times it's
[1:08:30] comparing yourself. I'm I'm a failure.
[1:08:33] I'm not doing as well as them. And it's
[1:08:35] comparisons. And David says, "Deliver me
[1:08:38] from this oppression of other men.
[1:08:40] Deliver me with comparing myself on
[1:08:43] social media with other men and other
[1:08:45] teenagers. Deliver me because what it
[1:08:47] does is it makes me oppressed. It makes
[1:08:49] me under a spirit of depression. You're
[1:08:52] not called to be under depression.
[1:08:56] Deliver me from the oppression of man,
[1:08:58] so will I keep thy precepts. Psalms
[1:09:01] 142:6, "Deliver me from my persecutors,
[1:09:04] for they are stronger than I." I don't
[1:09:07] believe in any of these scriptures. So
[1:09:09] when he says deliver me that he's saying
[1:09:11] I'm never going to have somebody
[1:09:12] persecute me again. What he's saying is
[1:09:14] God put me in that secret place that I'm
[1:09:17] not affected by the persecutors.
[1:09:24] Deliver me from my persecution. What's
[1:09:26] that mean? I never want to have anybody
[1:09:28] persecute me ever again. Lord, please.
[1:09:31] The Listen now. You in this you on you
[1:09:33] on this earth. You in this life and you
[1:09:36] want you're praying God. I never want to
[1:09:38] be persecuted again. I never want
[1:09:39] anybody to say anything bad about me
[1:09:41] again. I don't think that's what David's
[1:09:43] saying. That's not realistic.
[1:09:46] He's saying, "Deliver me from it.
[1:09:48] Deliver me from being affected by it.
[1:09:51] Put me in the secret place that I'm
[1:09:53] insulated,
[1:09:55] not isolated, but insulated from this
[1:09:58] stuff affecting my spirit." Can you give
[1:10:01] me an amen this morning? Deliverance.
[1:10:03] Sometimes deliverance. And we know for
[1:10:05] for God can deliver and deliver shared
[1:10:09] from cancer the tumor's gone. It's a
[1:10:11] physical deliverance. But in our spirit,
[1:10:13] in our emotions can sometimes we realize
[1:10:15] God taking something away. We say,
[1:10:17] "Well, God, take that away. Take that
[1:10:19] person out of my life." And sometimes it
[1:10:21] is good to distance yourself. But you'll
[1:10:23] never get out of trials and people
[1:10:25] acting like they do. You're always going
[1:10:28] to have a Saul around somewhere. So,
[1:10:30] it's not that Saul goes away, but it's
[1:10:33] Lord, I'm going to run into your secret
[1:10:35] place, and that's how I'll be delivered
[1:10:38] from it affecting me.
[1:10:40] Such a place of confidence. Such a place
[1:10:43] of peace. Such a I will not allow these
[1:10:46] emotions to go up and down by what
[1:10:48] people have said about me. Deliver me
[1:10:51] from my persecutors, for they are
[1:10:53] stronger than I. Psalms 144:11, "Rid me
[1:10:57] and deliver me from the hand of strange
[1:10:59] children whose mouth speaketh vanity and
[1:11:02] their right hand is the hand of
[1:11:04] falsehood, lies being told." Most of it,
[1:11:08] as I said last time I spoke on this,
[1:11:10] most of this is people. Some of it is
[1:11:12] his own guilt, but most of it, deliver
[1:11:14] me, and he says, "Deliver me my spirit
[1:11:17] to a secret place that my spirit will
[1:11:19] not be affected by these." David was
[1:11:22] interested in his spirit and his
[1:11:24] emotions being in a protected place all
[1:11:30] the time. Thank you. Let me say it
[1:11:33] again. David was interested in his
[1:11:36] spirit and his emotions and his soul
[1:11:40] being in a protected place all the time.
[1:11:48] When David repented after his great sin,
[1:11:51] you know what his great sin was?
[1:11:52] Adultery with Basheba. When he come back
[1:11:55] and and God said, "You're the man." And
[1:11:57] he come to full repentance. He's
[1:11:59] bringing that thing. And when he
[1:12:01] repented, you know, purge me with
[1:12:03] hissup.
[1:12:05] Let build the walls of Jerusalem. This
[1:12:06] is all in Psalms 51. And his his
[1:12:08] repentance. It wasn't just a God, I'm
[1:12:10] sorry for doing that. No, it's a full
[1:12:13] convicting repentance. purge me with
[1:12:15] hissup. God build the walls of Jerusalem
[1:12:18] and protections around my life. I would
[1:12:20] never commit adultery like that again.
[1:12:22] God so deliver me. I'd never look at
[1:12:25] that pornography again. Can I get an
[1:12:27] amen? People keep resorting back to
[1:12:30] stuff. What you need to go is to a
[1:12:32] deeper sincerity and a deeper heart that
[1:12:34] says, "God, I'm waiting on you to deal
[1:12:36] with this thing with your holy fire
[1:12:40] and that it is finished. However long it
[1:12:42] takes, I'm staying here with the altar
[1:12:44] in my heart until you see this to an
[1:12:46] end.
[1:12:48] I'll listen to every word. I'll listen
[1:12:50] to every help I can get. I'll garner all
[1:12:52] I can. But at the end of the day, Lord
[1:12:53] Jesus, you're going to have to step in
[1:12:56] and purge this. And when he repented, it
[1:12:59] was a repentance that says, "Build the
[1:13:00] walls of Jerusalem that the enemy will
[1:13:03] never come into my tower again."
[1:13:06] But one of the things he said in his
[1:13:08] repentance too, he said, "Lord, restore
[1:13:12] unto me the joy of my salvation." And
[1:13:16] it's been said, I think our prophet said
[1:13:18] it, he didn't say, "Restore my
[1:13:20] salvation." He didn't lose his
[1:13:22] salvation. He lost the joy of it.
[1:13:25] Can I get an amen? He didn't say, "I
[1:13:28] lost my" No, he didn't lose his
[1:13:30] salvation. He lost the joy of it. He's
[1:13:32] saying, "I don't want to live in these
[1:13:34] mlly grubs and under guilt. I'm asking
[1:13:36] you and repent. I've repented. I've
[1:13:38] brought it before you. Purge me with
[1:13:40] hissup. Cleanse me. Cleanse my heart, oh
[1:13:43] God. Oh God, cleanse my heart. But Lord,
[1:13:46] do something extra for me if you would."
[1:13:48] And that's restore to me the joy of my
[1:13:50] salvation. Bring me out of this cloud of
[1:13:52] guilt. Let me be happy again.
[1:13:57] Amen. Why is he praying that way?
[1:13:59] because he's not just praying that God
[1:14:01] would forgive him in his soul, but God
[1:14:04] would restore his emotions and his
[1:14:07] spirit. Yes, I love David in the Bible.
[1:14:11] I I relate my life, my life more to him
[1:14:15] than any other man. And I love his
[1:14:17] honesty. I love his truthfulness.
[1:14:21] You read the book of
[1:14:23] the book of Psalms and you read his
[1:14:26] life. He doesn't hold anything back.
[1:14:28] He's He's a worshshiper.
[1:14:32] He lifts his hands and worships and
[1:14:34] praises and shouts and dances if he has
[1:14:36] to. Even in hard times, he's a
[1:14:38] worshshiper.
[1:14:40] He's not going to let what's that song
[1:14:42] say? I never lost my
[1:14:45] I never lost my worship. I never lost my
[1:14:48] praise. I lost a lot of things, but I'm
[1:14:50] never going to lose my praise. David
[1:14:52] never lost his praise. The devil can
[1:14:55] steal a lot, but he's not going to steal
[1:14:56] my praise. And in the worst times, he
[1:14:59] praised the Lord. Anyhow,
[1:15:01] praise the Lord.
[1:15:03] I lost a lot of things, but I never lost
[1:15:05] that. And David was a worshshiper. But
[1:15:07] he was honest along with the worship,
[1:15:09] along with the praise. He was honest
[1:15:11] about the what the enemy was doing to
[1:15:13] his spirit. He was honest. I need to run
[1:15:15] somewhere. I need a safe place. I need a
[1:15:18] place that he would protect me from
[1:15:20] being affected by what people are
[1:15:22] saying, what people by the javelins
[1:15:24] being thrown at me. I need to live in
[1:15:26] that secret place. Psalms 27, our
[1:15:29] rapture scripture says that I could
[1:15:31] dwell in the house of the Lord. One
[1:15:32] thing have I desired to dwell in that
[1:15:34] house of the Lord every day of my life.
[1:15:37] Every day of my life. Can I get an amen?
[1:15:38] Every day of my life. Not just at camp
[1:15:41] meeting every year. Brother Ram says we
[1:15:43] got camp meeting people that go from
[1:15:45] camp to camp and they get built up then
[1:15:47] they go down built up. We don't want to
[1:15:49] be camp meeting people every day. We
[1:15:51] want to stay built up and live in that
[1:15:52] secret place. Amen.
[1:15:56] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He was
[1:15:58] honest
[1:16:00] and that's why I love it so much. But he
[1:16:02] restore unto me not the my salvation
[1:16:04] with the joy but and then he says renew
[1:16:07] a right spirit within me. That's what he
[1:16:10] said in his repentance. Renew a right
[1:16:11] spirit. Don't let my spirit stay under
[1:16:15] Satan's guilt.
[1:16:18] Don't let me let people
[1:16:21] defeat me and go into depression for
[1:16:25] weeks and I'm on the couch with my three
[1:16:29] gallons of ice cream
[1:16:32] vegging because somebody's done it again
[1:16:35] and you just plunge to the depths. Lord
[1:16:37] Jesus, put me in a place that my spirit
[1:16:41] is not affected,
[1:16:43] but I'm in constant fellowship with you.
[1:16:46] And it doesn't matter what goes on in
[1:16:48] this world outside. I'm living within
[1:16:51] the inner veil.
[1:16:55] Praise the Lord. David was interested in
[1:16:58] his spirit and his emotions be in a
[1:17:00] protected place. You can't change things
[1:17:03] in life. You can't change people. But we
[1:17:06] can run into his presence and stay
[1:17:07] refreshed in our soul and in our spirit
[1:17:10] facing another day with love for
[1:17:13] everyone. I would want somebody to sing
[1:17:15] that song. There is a quiet place
[1:17:18] free from the rapid pace of the world
[1:17:21] and the last lyrics says to face a new
[1:17:25] day coming out of that place face a new
[1:17:27] day with love for all mankind that's the
[1:17:30] result that you get is a greater divine
[1:17:33] love for people instead of hatred
[1:17:36] instead of being afraid instead of them
[1:17:39] affecting you and making you depressed
[1:17:42] you walk out of that inner court with
[1:17:44] more love of God, even if they have a
[1:17:47] tattoo,
[1:17:49] I don't condemn those people. I pray for
[1:17:52] them.
[1:17:57] Says in our text, be my strong
[1:17:59] habitation where I continually resort.
[1:18:01] Well, the first meaning to resort is a
[1:18:03] place that is a popular destination for
[1:18:06] vacations or recreation or which is
[1:18:08] frequented for a particular purpose. So
[1:18:10] that's resort. Us Americans are familiar
[1:18:13] with that word term for resort. We go to
[1:18:15] resorts sometimes and uh we're we're
[1:18:17] familiar with that term. And I just want
[1:18:19] to make a note about Jonah again. Uh
[1:18:21] when he went he was supposed to go to
[1:18:24] Nineveh. He went to Tarsus. I was kind
[1:18:26] of wondering if that was a why did he go
[1:18:28] to Tarsus? Well, one reason is it's one
[1:18:30] of the farthest points that he could be
[1:18:32] away from Nineveh.
[1:18:34] And it reminds me of our lives when
[1:18:37] we're running from the presence of the
[1:18:38] Lord or running from what we need to
[1:18:40] face. We position ourselves just as far
[1:18:44] away as we can from the body of Christ,
[1:18:47] from the presence of the Lord, from
[1:18:49] preachers who are preaching us truth,
[1:18:51] whether we like it or not.
[1:18:54] When we run, we position ourselves quite
[1:18:57] a ways away.
[1:19:00] It says about Tarsus, it was a far away
[1:19:03] and exotic place for the ancient
[1:19:05] Israelites. At least they thought it was
[1:19:07] exotic. It was out the Mediterranean.
[1:19:09] And uh
[1:19:12] Kirstston, is your mom and dad back yet
[1:19:14] from the Med Mediterranean cruise?
[1:19:15] They're not, man. They going to stay
[1:19:17] there for life or
[1:19:19] five more days. Okay. You were there
[1:19:21] too, weren't you? Wow. Nice. Nice
[1:19:24] cruise. Hopefully I can go someday. But
[1:19:26] when you're in Israel and you're looking
[1:19:28] over at this Mediterranean area, it was
[1:19:30] a bit to Israelites who had never been
[1:19:32] there, they heard about it. It was an
[1:19:34] exotic place. And Jonah's thinking,
[1:19:36] first of all, I'm not going to the
[1:19:38] Nvites. I don't like them. I don't think
[1:19:41] they'll repent. I don't even want them
[1:19:43] to repent.
[1:19:46] Talk about an attitude.
[1:19:49] They're Gentiles.
[1:19:51] I'm a Jew
[1:19:55] and I don't even have a care for it. And
[1:19:58] that's interesting that God gave him the
[1:20:00] commission to go to the Ninevites. God
[1:20:03] can send us where we don't want to go
[1:20:06] to test our character.
[1:20:08] This guy, he chose the farthest point.
[1:20:12] It's that the location of Tarsus was the
[1:20:14] farthest point imaginable from Jonah's
[1:20:17] homeland. He chose the farthest
[1:20:20] location.
[1:20:22] Boy, I think of situations after 30
[1:20:25] years of people choosing as far away
[1:20:29] from the message as they can choose.
[1:20:37] You're running from something.
[1:20:41] But you didn't run from yourself. When
[1:20:43] you move there, you took yourself with
[1:20:45] you.
[1:20:46] Oh, come on now. I I know some of you
[1:20:48] don't like me, but I'm going to say it.
[1:20:50] People think that a move is going to
[1:20:52] solve their problems.
[1:20:54] People think that moving somewhere
[1:20:56] geographically all their problems will
[1:20:57] go away, and then they discover, no,
[1:20:59] they're all still here.
[1:21:02] Because why? The the baggage that you
[1:21:04] need to unload for a trip is the baggage
[1:21:08] within you. But I'm a message believer.
[1:21:10] I've loved the prophet. I loved him for
[1:21:12] years. I'm not talking about a love for
[1:21:14] the prophet or a love for Jesus Christ.
[1:21:15] I'm talking about the baggage that's
[1:21:17] within you.
[1:21:21] You take it with you. And Jonah even
[1:21:23] took it with him to Tarsus. It says the
[1:21:26] contrast between Nineveh and Tarsus was
[1:21:28] vast. Nineveh was located east of the
[1:21:30] Tigress River in a modern-day Iraq. It
[1:21:33] was more than 500 miles east of Jonah's
[1:21:36] hometown.
[1:21:37] So that's Nineveh. It was only 500 miles
[1:21:40] east. So if you're here, uh where am I
[1:21:43] at here? I'm in Okay, I'm in Petersburg,
[1:21:46] Michigan. So that's west and this is
[1:21:49] east. So now if he were to go to Na, it
[1:21:51] was only Nineveh was only 500 miles
[1:21:53] away. So Tarsus stood west 2500 miles
[1:21:59] from Israel in the opposite direction of
[1:22:02] Nineveh
[1:22:04] and Jonah paid his fair on that cruise.
[1:22:10] The farthest way he could get from the
[1:22:12] responsibility of coming to an altar say
[1:22:15] I surrender.
[1:22:17] Let me tell you something. If you are a
[1:22:20] son of God, I don't care what you've
[1:22:21] done. I don't care where you've been. I
[1:22:23] don't care how many years of trash
[1:22:25] that's been in your life. You may think
[1:22:27] you're a good person, but at the end of
[1:22:28] the day, our righteousness as filthy
[1:22:30] rags, but if you're a son and daughter
[1:22:33] of God, you'll either come hard or you
[1:22:35] come easy. But all the father hath given
[1:22:38] me in my hand, they're going to come.
[1:22:40] You can run 2500 miles away. And what
[1:22:43] Jonah found, I guess it was this way,
[1:22:46] 2500 miles. And what Jonah found is when
[1:22:48] he was in the boat, God was in the boat.
[1:22:50] God was on the cruise with him. When he
[1:22:52] was in the fish, God was in the fish.
[1:22:55] Why? Because he was a son of God. You
[1:22:58] can't go 5,000 miles away. God's got
[1:23:01] your number. He's going to draw you
[1:23:03] back. He's going to get a hold of you.
[1:23:06] He's got a fish. Can you say amen? He's
[1:23:08] got a boat and guys are going to kick
[1:23:09] you out of the boat and you're going,
[1:23:11] "What's wrong? My career's not working
[1:23:12] here." Because you're running from God.
[1:23:14] You're running from something.
[1:23:18] Is anybody getting things out of this
[1:23:20] this morning? We are prone to run, but
[1:23:23] God's got our number. He'll find where
[1:23:25] we're at.
[1:23:27] And Jonah chose, I never knew this
[1:23:29] before till I studied it last night,
[1:23:31] 2500 miles west, the furthest city that
[1:23:37] he had heard is kind of exotic, could be
[1:23:39] a vacation area,
[1:23:42] could have a pool.
[1:23:46] He chose the furthest. It was the most
[1:23:48] remote destination available to Jonah.
[1:23:51] Jonah was trying to put as much distance
[1:23:54] as he could between himself and the
[1:23:58] Ninevites.
[1:24:01] Praise the Lord. Like I said about
[1:24:04] Jonah, he sure gives us a lot of
[1:24:06] sermons, but Bram says he's a type of us
[1:24:09] all.
[1:24:11] The other meaning to resort is, listen
[1:24:13] to this. Now, this is what I really want
[1:24:15] to get to. Even though I had a lot of
[1:24:16] fun with the first meaning to resort.
[1:24:20] Here's another meaning to resort. The
[1:24:22] action of turning to or adopting a
[1:24:26] strategy,
[1:24:29] especially a disagreeable or undesirable
[1:24:31] one, so as to resolve a difficult
[1:24:35] situation.
[1:24:38] So resort means is that you adopt a
[1:24:41] strategy or a place or a course of
[1:24:44] action. You found the answer what you
[1:24:47] need to do and all of it is to try to
[1:24:49] resolve a difficult situation. You're
[1:24:51] resolving it your own way
[1:24:55] like Jonah tried to do. I it's the
[1:24:57] action of turning to adopting a strategy
[1:25:00] of course of action especially a
[1:25:02] disagreeable or undesirable one as to
[1:25:04] resolve a difficult situation. I think
[1:25:06] that's amazing. I think in our human
[1:25:08] nature, we do that. We turn to the wrong
[1:25:11] thing. We choose our escapes to a
[1:25:13] difficult situation or we choose our
[1:25:16] escapes from our past. We run from our
[1:25:18] past. But David said, "Let your
[1:25:20] habitation be my continual resort."
[1:25:29] Lord, let your habitation of the rock
[1:25:33] and the the rock and the and the strong
[1:25:35] place and the secret place, let me
[1:25:37] continually continually resort to there.
[1:25:41] It's my default place that I go to.
[1:25:46] I go to prayer. I go to quiet with the
[1:25:49] Lord. I commune with the Lord. I talk
[1:25:51] with him. He talks to me. This secret
[1:25:54] place isn't a geographical place. It's
[1:25:56] not even just at this church. In the
[1:25:58] secret of his dwelling place, we go
[1:26:00] there to run from. If we're going to
[1:26:03] run, this is where we run. The world,
[1:26:05] you see, the world, they're the ones to
[1:26:08] resort to everything other than the
[1:26:10] Lord. Why do you want to be that way?
[1:26:12] The world in their trouble, when they
[1:26:14] run, they run to every other answer than
[1:26:17] the Lord. That should not be true with
[1:26:20] us. Can you say amen?
[1:26:23] That should not be true with believers.
[1:26:25] We We shouldn't run to the same things
[1:26:27] they do. We shouldn't spend countless
[1:26:31] hours
[1:26:33] swinging up and down in our phone
[1:26:36] because we're emotionally unstable.
[1:26:38] That's what they do. We shouldn't spend
[1:26:41] countless hours and veging on movies and
[1:26:44] everything else. Most of them not even
[1:26:46] appropriate for a Christian to watch.
[1:26:49] But it's an escape.
[1:26:51] It calms my nerves, does it?
[1:26:58] When we're choosing, even Jesus said, he
[1:27:02] said, "If I love only my the people that
[1:27:05] I like and my friends, aren't we like
[1:27:07] the publicans?
[1:27:09] They love and invite the people over
[1:27:11] that they just want to invite and ignore
[1:27:13] the other ones." He said, "Aren't we
[1:27:15] just acting like we're not supposed to
[1:27:17] act like the world? We're not like the
[1:27:18] world." So in this way, we shouldn't be
[1:27:20] choosing our default things that we run
[1:27:22] from trouble. We run from things. We
[1:27:25] shouldn't be choosing the same things.
[1:27:27] And if you're 25, 30, 35 years old and
[1:27:30] you've been choosing that for years, I'm
[1:27:32] here as a gospel minister to say, "I
[1:27:34] love you." But you can keep choosing it
[1:27:36] until you're 60. You can go back into
[1:27:38] that thing you think is relieving your
[1:27:40] nerves, but I think it's time to look at
[1:27:42] where you're running to.
[1:27:44] Well, I'm a believer. I'm in this
[1:27:46] message. I I look and and I talk
[1:27:48] spiritual things and all that. No, no,
[1:27:49] no, no, no. You yourself keep running to
[1:27:52] something that might be weakening you
[1:27:54] and that. But you see, our default place
[1:27:56] needs to be the Lord.
[1:28:00] I'm not against a decent movie. You know
[1:28:02] that. I teach that as a pastor. But the
[1:28:04] problem in our generation, it becomes
[1:28:06] the escape.
[1:28:09] Oh, I watch only good stuff. Well, if
[1:28:10] you're watching 50 hours a week,
[1:28:12] something's wrong.
[1:28:14] That's true. Maybe even 10 hours a week,
[1:28:16] maybe 5 hours a week. Something's
[1:28:18] definitely off in your life.
[1:28:23] There's a there's a Christian uh man
[1:28:25] named CJ Williams, and I'm going to wrap
[1:28:28] it up with this.
[1:28:31] I tell you, there's been such a I I
[1:28:34] don't know if everybody's tired, but
[1:28:37] I I should have asked for that sign from
[1:28:39] Brother Diggs that says, "Amen." I've
[1:28:41] never resorted to that in my whole life.
[1:28:46] But pastors learn after many years,
[1:28:51] if you're listening, if you're taking it
[1:28:53] in,
[1:28:55] I've had people that are allowed to say
[1:28:56] ameners, but they didn't get it.
[1:29:02] Hopefully, some of you are getting it
[1:29:03] this morning. I don't want this to be a
[1:29:05] just a sermon. I laid at this altar last
[1:29:07] night. I said, "Oh, God, we don't need
[1:29:09] any more sermons. We need the glory of
[1:29:11] God to come down into the temples. We
[1:29:13] need people's lives changed." I stayed
[1:29:16] here an hour and prayed. I said, "God,
[1:29:18] change me if you have to. Whatever needs
[1:29:19] to be done, this is a late hour.
[1:29:21] People's lives. We don't need to waste
[1:29:23] time." What's it what's the name of your
[1:29:25] song, Sister Sherry? That ministered to
[1:29:27] us as well. We never want to let it
[1:29:30] become common to us. His presence and
[1:29:32] what he's speaking to you, right? Our
[1:29:34] Lord Jesus, I believe, is speaking right
[1:29:36] now.
[1:29:40] Don't make me the enemy. I'm just the
[1:29:43] messenger.
[1:29:46] CJ Williams has really narrowed this
[1:29:48] down that a way that I like to three
[1:29:51] things. He summarized this well. Three
[1:29:53] things. And he made the point. He said
[1:29:56] unbelievers and the world when they run
[1:29:59] into this these type of three types of
[1:30:01] trouble, he said they run a certain way.
[1:30:03] But we Christians, we're to run and flee
[1:30:06] to Christ.
[1:30:09] But the pro the trouble is the same. And
[1:30:11] he narrows it down to three basic
[1:30:14] things. He said, "Here are three things
[1:30:15] that unbelievers want to get away from
[1:30:17] it all. And they they'll get vacations
[1:30:19] and they all these other things and and
[1:30:21] they want to run from it all into their
[1:30:23] alcohol, into this, into social media.
[1:30:25] They're they're running from what? Three
[1:30:27] things here." But the things that we
[1:30:29] should these are things that should move
[1:30:31] us to flee to Christ and find our hiding
[1:30:34] place in him. That's how we should react
[1:30:36] to this. And the first thing is worry.
[1:30:40] The first trouble is worry.
[1:30:45] This includes all of the whatifs. Now, I
[1:30:48] want you to listen closely because I'm
[1:30:50] closing, but don't miss these parts.
[1:30:52] This includes all the whatifs that we
[1:30:55] entertain all the time. What if
[1:30:58] the bad possibilities we play out in our
[1:31:02] minds and all the variables of life that
[1:31:06] we cannot control
[1:31:09] fear is a powerful force of the enemy.
[1:31:13] Fear of the future. Fear of things that
[1:31:15] haven't even happened yet. And guess
[1:31:16] what? Probably 95% of them don't ever
[1:31:19] happen. But you played it out in your
[1:31:21] mind as if it was going to happen. I got
[1:31:24] some of your number. I got my number
[1:31:26] this morning. I hope you're going to
[1:31:27] say, "Amen." Listen, Satan uses worry
[1:31:30] and fear of things that's never even
[1:31:33] happened yet.
[1:31:35] It's the devil
[1:31:37] and the world has it. And this is how
[1:31:40] they react. I thought I would I've only
[1:31:43] got these up. Don't tell anybody in the
[1:31:45] message I'm using these emojis,
[1:31:48] but I know I got the children's
[1:31:50] attention. I got the teenagers
[1:31:51] attention. I got all your attention
[1:31:52] through this. This relates
[1:31:57] worry isn't it? He says this is all the
[1:31:59] whatifs that we entertain, the bad
[1:32:00] possibilities we play out our minds and
[1:32:02] all the variables of life that we cannot
[1:32:04] control. If you feel overcome by worry,
[1:32:08] hide yourself in the Lord.
[1:32:12] He said hide yourself in the Lord. Be
[1:32:15] still in his presence. Find comfort in
[1:32:18] the truth of his word and recognize that
[1:32:21] your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[1:32:27] Where are we running to? We're running
[1:32:29] to that secret place with what our
[1:32:31] worry. We don't react like this. I
[1:32:35] should have had a happy emoji.
[1:32:37] I tried to find one with a roof over it
[1:32:39] because you're in that pavilion with God
[1:32:41] with a happy content face.
[1:32:44] This how the world reacts. That's not
[1:32:45] how we should react. The next thing, I
[1:32:48] hope you're writing these down in your
[1:32:49] mind or in your notes. Three things.
[1:32:51] Worry. The next thing is conflict.
[1:32:56] If you are at odds with someone and you
[1:32:59] find yourself angry and fed up, I know
[1:33:02] none of you people in literal live
[1:33:04] church every has felt this way about
[1:33:07] someone. So, just try to act like you
[1:33:11] understand this.
[1:33:13] If you are at odds with someone and you
[1:33:15] find yourself angry and fed up, you
[1:33:18] don't need to stew over the situation
[1:33:20] and plot your next move.
[1:33:23] You need the guidance of the Lord and
[1:33:25] the spiritual composure to re-engage the
[1:33:28] problem with the grace and love that
[1:33:32] comes from the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:36] Before you go back to that person, first
[1:33:39] go hide yourself in the Lord.
[1:33:44] Because if you don't run and hide
[1:33:45] yourself in the Lord, you're putting on
[1:33:48] the boxing gloves.
[1:33:54] I need Brother Diggs here.
[1:33:58] We get mad at conflict in life and we
[1:34:00] put the boxing gloves on. Take the
[1:34:02] gloves off.
[1:34:06] Take the gloves off.
[1:34:08] You say, "Well, I did, but you sure got
[1:34:10] a sharp tongue speaking against people."
[1:34:14] So, you got the boxing glove still on.
[1:34:16] You're just using your tongue to do it.
[1:34:19] You're sending something back. They sent
[1:34:21] missiles and you sent missiles back on
[1:34:23] social media.
[1:34:28] Oh Lord, I pray you'd deliver me from
[1:34:31] this position someday and let somebody
[1:34:33] else do it because it's not fun to tell
[1:34:36] it like it is. It's not fun.
[1:34:39] But you put on your boxing gloves when
[1:34:42] conflict comes the world I watched it in
[1:34:45] the in the store the other day. There's
[1:34:47] no Holy Ghost there. There's not even
[1:34:49] any courtesy for people. Someone crosses
[1:34:52] them and there's a conflict, they
[1:34:53] they're ready to go at it.
[1:34:56] It escalates pretty quickly.
[1:35:00] If you're at odds with someone, you find
[1:35:02] yourself angry and fed up. You don't
[1:35:05] need to stew over the situation. Plot
[1:35:06] your next move. You need the guidance of
[1:35:08] the Lord and the spiritual composure to
[1:35:09] re-engage the problem with grace and
[1:35:11] love that comes from the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:13] Before you go back to that person, first
[1:35:15] go hide yourself in the Lord. You got to
[1:35:18] address a situation. You better hide
[1:35:20] yourself in the Lord. And brother
[1:35:22] Brandham says before you go talk to the
[1:35:24] people about God, talk to God about the
[1:35:28] people.
[1:35:32] The last one is weariness.
[1:35:37] What do we have as an emoji for
[1:35:39] weariness? Do you have that one?
[1:35:44] This may be another pandemic around us.
[1:35:49] People are busy and people are too busy
[1:35:54] which makes them weary in body, weary in
[1:35:57] spirit, weary in emotion, on edge,
[1:36:02] burning their candle at both end, on
[1:36:05] edge, ready to bite back. You'll find
[1:36:08] this under the messages five times
[1:36:10] preach letting off the pressure. And
[1:36:12] brother Bram in the 1960s
[1:36:16] is identifying a problem in our society.
[1:36:19] People are under so much pressure. They
[1:36:22] boil over and they start reacting. And
[1:36:25] he said this pressure makes unbelievers
[1:36:28] act this way, can make believers act
[1:36:30] this way. No one is exempt from it
[1:36:32] because why? The pressure don't change.
[1:36:34] The pressure is there. But what changes
[1:36:36] is how we deal with the pressure.
[1:36:39] And he's in that letting off the
[1:36:41] pressure. And he's saying talking about
[1:36:43] running today. There was cities of
[1:36:45] refuge that when the hounds of hell were
[1:36:48] running after, they could run into the
[1:36:50] city of refuge.
[1:36:52] Run to a place to let off the pressure.
[1:36:54] He's once again he's pointing to that
[1:36:55] place. This may be another pandemic.
[1:36:57] People are busy, too busy, and too tired
[1:37:00] from being too busy.
[1:37:02] We need to do better at focusing on what
[1:37:05] is really truly important. But the fact
[1:37:08] is that if you seek to be faithful and
[1:37:10] diligent in your calling, you will have
[1:37:12] a busy life. God designed it that way,
[1:37:15] but also gave us himself as a hiding
[1:37:18] place. If you ever find yourself feeling
[1:37:21] just plain tired,
[1:37:25] hide yourself in Christ.
[1:37:31] This might be as just as basic as you
[1:37:33] can get this morning.
[1:37:37] But these are three main things he's
[1:37:39] narrowed it down to. And everyone, the
[1:37:42] answer is that hiding place in Christ.
[1:37:46] Go there first. You know what you're
[1:37:49] going to find? He's going to relieve the
[1:37:51] worry.
[1:37:53] He's going to relieve the conflict. He's
[1:37:56] going to relieve the weariness
[1:37:58] in your spirit. Can you say amen? Where
[1:38:01] do we run?
[1:38:03] Where do you run to? Where do you resort
[1:38:05] to?
[1:38:08] Is it the rock? Is it the fortress?
[1:38:11] Is it the secret place of his
[1:38:13] tabernacle?
[1:38:15] Are we hiding oursel in him?
[1:38:19] Brother Bram says, "And the man who
[1:38:20] lives in the presence of God under the
[1:38:23] veil lives in the shikana glory. I don't
[1:38:27] care if the storms are raging, whether
[1:38:29] the clouds or the moon don't shine or
[1:38:31] the stars don't shine, whether the
[1:38:34] candlesticks goes out, that doesn't
[1:38:36] matter. He's living in the shakana
[1:38:38] glory,
[1:38:39] the glory of God under the power of the
[1:38:42] Holy Ghost. Later he says he had not a
[1:38:45] worry in the world. Everything was taken
[1:38:48] care of. God was over him, listening to
[1:38:50] him praise and answering his prayer. Not
[1:38:54] only that, but he's living right in the
[1:38:55] presence of the king. God in the shikana
[1:38:58] glory. Every time anything would start
[1:39:00] up like that. It couldn't get to him. He
[1:39:03] wouldn't listen to it. He couldn't. The
[1:39:05] wines of the world was on the outside.
[1:39:08] If you ever come into Christ, my friend,
[1:39:10] ever to into a place where the world is
[1:39:13] dead, where the whole whether your
[1:39:15] children are this, whether your mother
[1:39:17] is this way, your daddy said this,
[1:39:19] whether your pastor said that, whether
[1:39:21] the doctor said this or that, you don't
[1:39:24] even hear it. You live only in the
[1:39:26] shakana glory.
[1:39:30] Walking and living in the presence of
[1:39:32] the king. Every day is sweet in your
[1:39:34] soul. My all is well. All is well.
[1:39:37] others. Nothing can harm you. Oh, what a
[1:39:41] place.
[1:39:43] Later he says, "Let my neighbors gossip.
[1:39:46] Let me this, that, or the other be
[1:39:48] gone." I go to church for one thing.
[1:39:50] That's to stay in your presence. Isn't
[1:39:53] it amazing? The song this morning is
[1:39:55] right in line with this.
[1:39:58] I'm not going to take his presence for
[1:40:00] granted. I go to church. He says,
[1:40:03] I go to church for one thing. That's to
[1:40:05] stay in your presence. I am moved in
[1:40:07] there, Lord. I never desire to leave
[1:40:10] again. I'll trust your word, what you
[1:40:12] say. There is where I want to be. Drop
[1:40:15] the veils around me, Lord, that I could
[1:40:17] only see Jesus alone and live and walk
[1:40:20] and die in him. Oh God, hide me in that
[1:40:24] place.
[1:40:26] Hide me over in that place where all the
[1:40:29] veils will drop and I'll see nothing but
[1:40:31] Jesus himself. I don't want to hear I
[1:40:34] don't want to hear the fantastics of the
[1:40:37] world.
[1:40:39] Can you imagine somebody saying that to
[1:40:42] the Lord in his prayer? I don't even
[1:40:44] want to hear the fantastics of the
[1:40:47] world. What's big to the world? I don't
[1:40:50] care anymore.
[1:40:53] Numb my ears. May my ears deaf. Put me
[1:40:56] in such a place that I don't even want
[1:40:57] to hear that anymore.
[1:41:04] I don't want to hear the fantastics of
[1:41:06] the world. I don't care whether they got
[1:41:08] atomic bombs, whether they got a jet
[1:41:10] plane, whether the new Chevrolets look
[1:41:13] better than the Buicks. Isn't it
[1:41:15] amazing? Or what year are we in here?
[1:41:17] 1956. And isn't it amazing? He's saying
[1:41:20] the stuff that attracts Americans and
[1:41:23] worries Americans and attracts
[1:41:26] Americans. Is it the Buick or the Ford?
[1:41:29] If I asked for a vote, would we be had a
[1:41:31] bunch of Ford hands here even today?
[1:41:34] If I asked between Ohio State and
[1:41:35] Michigan, I'm not going to do that right
[1:41:37] now. But, you know, we we have all of
[1:41:40] our stuff.
[1:41:42] And he's pegging it back in 1956. And
[1:41:46] it's worse today. This is the stuff that
[1:41:49] we let our minds be on all the time. And
[1:41:52] he's saying, "When I'm in that place, I
[1:41:54] don't care about the fantastics of the
[1:41:56] world."
[1:41:57] Somebody told me the other day, we need
[1:42:00] to stop listening to the news.
[1:42:03] Now, I don't mind keeping up, but if you
[1:42:05] stay on there all the time, I'm not
[1:42:08] making a new rule here.
[1:42:10] I can't find this in black and white.
[1:42:13] Don't listen to the news in the Bible.
[1:42:17] I'm talking to people who want to live
[1:42:19] in that secret place. So, they make a
[1:42:21] decision. If I listen to that all the
[1:42:24] time, my heart's gripped with fear.
[1:42:27] He said, "I don't want to hear about the
[1:42:28] atomic bombs." And we're there again.
[1:42:32] You know, there was a retired couple,
[1:42:33] and this a true story I read last night.
[1:42:35] There was a retired couple
[1:42:38] many years ago. Can't remember the year
[1:42:40] now, but they they started to get
[1:42:42] fearful at the end of their life of the
[1:42:44] atomic bombs and the wars. So they did
[1:42:47] their research
[1:42:50] and they were going to find all the
[1:42:53] habited places in the whole world and
[1:42:56] find the best place they could be in the
[1:42:58] case of an atomic. They did all their
[1:43:00] research, sold their home, f found the
[1:43:04] the um Falcon Islands was the place to
[1:43:07] go
[1:43:11] and sold everything and their church.
[1:43:14] They went to a church and they went and
[1:43:17] moved there. And that's right when the
[1:43:20] Argentina went to war with somebody and
[1:43:22] the main place of the war was on those
[1:43:24] islands after they moved there and there
[1:43:27] was a threat of nuclear there.
[1:43:32] We can come up with all the plans we
[1:43:33] want. And guess what I was thinking
[1:43:36] about? Because they wrote a letter
[1:43:38] back postcard from before it happened to
[1:43:42] the pastor say, "God bless you. We
[1:43:43] enjoyed all your years of ministry.
[1:43:45] We've retired down here because we feel
[1:43:47] this is a safer place. God bless you.
[1:43:49] Maybe you can come and visit sometime.
[1:43:51] Thank you for all your years of
[1:43:52] preaching. You know what I thought of?
[1:43:54] They ran away and their safe place was
[1:43:57] preached to them every Sunday.
[1:44:00] Amen. And they sold all their stuff to
[1:44:02] move somewhere they thought was going to
[1:44:03] be safe. And I'm preaching to you and
[1:44:06] the gospel ministers are preaching to
[1:44:08] you a place that's safe from nuclear
[1:44:10] war.
[1:44:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:19] Whether his new Chevrolets look better
[1:44:21] than the Buicks, it doesn't matter. The
[1:44:23] thing of it is I'm walking and living
[1:44:26] with Christ daily. And I've died to self
[1:44:29] and the veils are dropped around and I
[1:44:31] am in he in he and he in me. Let the
[1:44:35] storms rage. My anchor holds within the
[1:44:39] veil. Can't tell you why I have a lot of
[1:44:42] storms on these seas of of this day. But
[1:44:45] thankful for an anchor that holds
[1:44:48] steadfast within the veil. When she's
[1:44:51] rocking and looks like every move would
[1:44:53] send her to the bottom, yet my anchor is
[1:44:55] in the veil. I've anchored in the veil.
[1:44:57] I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of
[1:45:00] life I'll brave. I've anchored in Jesus.

[1:45:26] to a secret place in Jesus Christ. And
[1:45:29] in that place, we can sing. I've
[1:45:32] anchored
[1:45:33] in Jesus.
[1:45:35] The storms of life I'll break. I've
[1:45:39] anchored in Jesus.

[1:45:47] Jesus for he has power to say. I've

[1:47:21] I want you to be this morning, all of
[1:47:22] us.
[1:47:24] Who keeps my soul from evil and gives me
[1:47:29] blessed peace.
[1:47:31] His voice has still the one and their
[1:47:36] toes.

[1:47:43] find for always when I need he's at amen
[1:47:51] where I make in Jesus the storms of life

[1:48:23] anchor.
[1:48:25] He drives away my sorrows and shields me
[1:48:29] from. Hallelujah. By faith, I'm looking
[1:48:33] upward beyond life's trouble. See, and

[1:49:13] John Wesley said one time, he says, "I
[1:49:16] go alone
[1:49:18] to a quiet place and pray
[1:49:21] to the Lord by myself." And he says,
[1:49:24] "God sets me on fire.
[1:49:27] I catch on fire." He says, "Then I come
[1:49:29] out of that place and everybody comes
[1:49:32] and watches me burn.
[1:49:34] for the Lord. That's what we get out of
[1:49:37] that. And that's where that song came
[1:49:38] from. I've been touched by a fire, so
[1:49:43] let the world come and watch me burn.
[1:49:46] That's where it came from.
[1:49:49] Shout it from the rooftop. Shout it to
[1:49:54] everyone.
[1:49:56] I've been touched by a fire. I've been
[1:49:59] touched by your fire. So let the world
[1:50:03] come and watch me burn.
[1:50:08] Shout it from the rooftop. Shout it to
[1:50:12] everyone.
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:18] I don't know what the first verse is. So
[1:50:19] give me the first verse and before we
[1:50:21] pray, we're dismissed.
[1:50:25] A little bit higher.
[1:50:27] Jesus blinded all my darkness.
[1:50:31] You sparked my heart within.
[1:50:34] His grace and mercy let a passion
[1:50:38] consume my sin.
[1:50:41] Now like a city on a hill.
[1:50:45] I'll shine through the night.
[1:50:48] I am a lamp made for his glory.
[1:50:52] I will not hide.
[1:50:55] Amen. Oh,
[1:50:58] I've been touched by fire to let the
[1:51:02] world.
[1:51:06] Oh, shout.
[1:51:10] Shouting to everyone who
[1:51:15] this love will never be extinguished.
[1:51:20] Live and wild and free.
[1:51:22] I'm taken by his power. His
[1:51:27] spirit in me. His spirit. Oh, his spirit
[1:51:32] in me. Oh, I've been touched by the fire
[1:51:38] to let the world.

[1:51:59] of glory.
[1:52:01] Praise be to God. God bless you. Let's
[1:52:03] pray together. If you have a need, just
[1:52:06] lift your hand and you want to come
[1:52:08] forward. We'll be glad to lay hands on
[1:52:10] you. My heart is to be in this secret
[1:52:13] place.
[1:52:15] My heart is to live there all the time.
[1:52:19] I trust that's your desire this morning.
[1:52:21] Think about, pray about the things that
[1:52:24] have been said today as we just live in
[1:52:27] the closing seconds of time. This is the
[1:52:30] place in Christ that he's called us to
[1:52:32] live from. Thank you, Lord. Heavenly
[1:52:35] Father,
[1:52:37] we close this service, Lord. We put what
[1:52:40] has been said in your hands. If it's
[1:52:43] your word, it can't return void. It'll
[1:52:46] bring forth fruit.
[1:52:48] It'll whisper secrets just to a bride.
[1:52:51] Not the flirters,
[1:52:53] not just the people are flirting with
[1:52:56] the Lord Jesus, but your wife, the
[1:52:58] bride,
[1:53:00] you're whispering secrets to her.
[1:53:03] Lord, if that's the case, and we've
[1:53:05] heard some of those things today, and
[1:53:06] you're drawing us away as the Song of
[1:53:09] Solomon, it says there, "Come away, my
[1:53:11] love. Come away." You're drawing us.
[1:53:13] you're calling us because the bride is
[1:53:16] your loved one. Lord, your the bride is
[1:53:19] your wife, your the one that you've
[1:53:22] called, the one you've chosen to be your
[1:53:25] little elect lady. And Lord, when
[1:53:27] Solomon said, "Come away, my love," we
[1:53:29] hear that voice. Come away from the
[1:53:31] busyiness. Come away from the trouble.
[1:53:35] come away from your past and be alone
[1:53:39] with me so that you could receive the
[1:53:42] strength that you need to face the
[1:53:45] coming days. Grant it for Father we pray
[1:53:48] and let
[1:53:51] all things Lord that are in our lives
[1:53:54] that we can't figure out. I have many of
[1:53:56] them now Lord I I do not understand some
[1:54:00] things. We put them
[1:54:03] in your hands today. We cast all of our
[1:54:06] cares and burdens on you. We cast our
[1:54:10] worries on you. Not going to try to
[1:54:14] figure it out. Lord, we're going to live
[1:54:16] in a place by your grace that we be
[1:54:20] stabilized.
[1:54:22] We only have one answer to every
[1:54:25] situation and that's divine love. Grant
[1:54:29] it my Lord. May you continue to minister
[1:54:32] to your precious people. We pray in
[1:54:35] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:54:38] all. Let's shake hands with one another
[1:54:40] in Christian love. Feel such a good
[1:54:42] presence of the Lord here. Do hardly
[1:54:44] want to leave. Hardly want to leave.
[1:54:48] There is a quiet place. There is a
[1:54:50] secret place.
[1:54:54] Blessed be his name. God bless you all.
[1:55:00] I've been touched by your fire. So let
[1:55:04] the world come and watch me burn.
