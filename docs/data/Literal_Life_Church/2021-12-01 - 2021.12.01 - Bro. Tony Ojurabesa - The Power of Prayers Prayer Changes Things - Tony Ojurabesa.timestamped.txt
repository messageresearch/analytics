[7:17] the elders of the church
[7:19] and let them pray over him
[7:23] anoint him with oil

[7:29] sick

[7:34] not only that
[7:35] and if he are committing sins
[7:37] they shall be forgiving him
[7:40] i love that i don't hear somebody
[7:42] and letting the sick oil
[7:44] enforce the blood of jesus christ
[7:48] not only to heal the sick
[7:50] but to enforce forgiveness of sin

[8:28] the earth for the space of three years
[8:30] and six months
[8:32] and he prayed again
[8:33] and the heaven gave rain
[8:35] and the earth brought forth her fruit
[8:38] my
[8:39] what prayer can do tonight
[8:42] are you with me something on somebody
[8:47] the power of prayer prayer changes
[8:49] things
[8:51] we found out prayer is an integral part
[8:53] of a christian life
[8:55] they're inseparable
[8:57] someone said in nigeria some years ago
[8:59] brother josiah he said
[9:01] a prayerless
[9:02] prayerless christian
[9:04] is a powerless christian
[9:06] you don't pray as a christian you know
[9:07] no you don't got no power
[9:09] amen
[9:10] and brother ken in the book of proverbs
[9:12] 24 10
[9:14] 24 verse 10 says
[9:16] if thou faint in a day of adversity
[9:19] thy strength is small
[9:22] if you're weak in prayer when the enemy
[9:24] attacks you you're going to pour the
[9:26] center
[9:27] it means somebody
[9:29] and children of god
[9:30] we cannot faint now
[9:32] in this hour that we believe in him
[9:34] and these troubles hour that we're
[9:36] living in the world today
[9:37] since the past two years
[9:39] our has changed
[9:42] is that true that's this has changed
[9:45] and it should not be the same anymore
[9:46] never
[9:48] now they are talking about
[9:50] uh micro or
[9:52] omega omicron
[9:54] variant
[9:57] god have much upon us so why wouldn't we
[10:00] play with pray then
[10:02] being not he did not but the devil
[10:04] harassing people of god
[10:07] when we finally in the beginning of
[10:08] creation when i was still in eternal
[10:10] relationship with god
[10:13] there was no need for him to pray
[10:15] bro ken he has no need to pray in the
[10:17] beginning
[10:18] why
[10:19] dada was a little god
[10:21] on earth
[10:24] amen
[10:26] he didn't have to pray
[10:28] i would not need to pray today as god's
[10:31] people is over the fall of genesis 3.
[10:35] amen and the reason why we pray today
[10:38] is to have our faith
[10:41] when you have a problem in your life and
[10:43] they will try to bother your mind
[10:45] and someone reminds you that i already
[10:46] pray about it
[10:48] that comes your knives down that's gonna
[10:49] be okay
[10:50] so we pray today to help our faith amen
[10:54] but very soon we don't we're not gonna
[10:55] need to pray anymore i mean somebody
[10:58] after our full restoration back to eden
[11:01] remember baron told us in their message
[11:03] christ beast of god revealed
[11:05] that christ is written this day god is
[11:07] doing this in the last day of messenger
[11:09] prophet ministry
[11:11] for three things three reasons
[11:13] one to reveal who god is
[11:16] to know who god is
[11:18] hallelujah somebody
[11:20] because now we know god is not jesus is
[11:22] not they don't tell person personal
[11:24] trinity anymore
[11:26] jesus almighty god
[11:28] he is the earth to see of god
[11:31] hallelujah somebody
[11:33] and suddenly
[11:34] he was revealed to have preeminence in
[11:36] his bride
[11:38] hallelujah somebody
[11:40] and thirdly
[11:41] to restore the kingdom back to eden
[11:44] where adam fell from
[11:45] all right
[11:47] and when christ was here on earth
[11:49] san francis and john the baptist
[11:51] followers quoted jesus
[11:53] why is disciples are not fasting
[11:57] would you know fast and go prayers
[12:00] if you have any issues in your life any
[12:01] problem in your life
[12:03] and you're having a problem delivering
[12:05] for victory
[12:06] just go faster with it it will happen
[12:08] you see the result right right right
[12:10] right quick
[12:12] fasting always
[12:13] prayer amen
[12:15] and you just told the disciples the
[12:17] accusers
[12:18] how can they mourn
[12:20] or fast
[12:21] when i'm still here with them
[12:24] but once i'm taken from them
[12:26] no one will need to teach them a
[12:27] reminder of the
[12:28] fast
[12:30] list of the marks mark chapter 2 mark 2
[12:34] verse 18 mark 218
[12:37] example of john and of the pharisees
[12:39] used to fast
[12:41] and they come and say unto him why do
[12:43] disciples of john and of the pharisees
[12:45] fast but the disciples passed not
[12:48] and that was look rabbi
[12:50] we fast all the time
[12:52] but your stuff are taking taking it easy
[12:56] and you just say not to them can the
[12:57] children of the bride chamber fast while
[13:00] the blood may still with them
[13:02] you know
[13:03] after i'm with them they don't need to
[13:04] fast or pray amen
[13:07] like the word that like that were
[13:08] children of i lied about when they said
[13:11] of the brass chamber
[13:13] amen
[13:15] and we are the chin of the blood chamber
[13:16] today remember
[13:18] about the pyramid
[13:20] in the pyramid i don't know a person
[13:22] will take care of that maybe sometimes
[13:24] to show us in their pyramid
[13:27] there is a
[13:28] stair which you've got
[13:30] gallery grand gallery
[13:33] which originally have seven steps
[13:35] that that have seven churches
[13:37] and it leads to the king's chamber
[13:39] hallelujah if you have studied before
[13:42] and at the end of that
[13:44] seventh step
[13:45] that's where we are today we are at the
[13:48] end of the seventh church age
[13:50] which they call a secret chamber in that
[13:53] pyramid
[13:54] we are right now in the supreme chamber
[13:57] in the little spot out of ladies are
[13:59] called the bride's age
[14:01] amen is it is a place of preparation to
[14:04] meet the king
[14:05] amen somebody and that's why we are
[14:07] today
[14:08] we are shot in a guard
[14:10] in the second place
[14:12] or somebody
[14:13] we are willing to be taken into the
[14:15] inner place
[14:17] hallelujah to meet our our king a
[14:19] husband very soon
[14:21] but those staff don't know how to pray
[14:23] with the jessie
[14:25] but they're in palestine i don't have to
[14:27] pray because the master is there with
[14:28] them they didn't prayers
[14:31] let's finish reading this in verse 20 of
[14:32] that marked mark second chapter
[14:35] the lord said but the days will come
[14:37] when the bridegroom shall be taken away
[14:39] from them
[14:40] and then shall they fast in those days
[14:45] you cannot be in god's presence presence
[14:47] 24 7 i need prayers you don't need it
[14:49] he means somebody
[14:51] like they were
[14:53] and you know we found out that after the
[14:55] law was taken from them they don't have
[14:57] to talk to pray
[14:59] they will quickly prepare a place in
[15:01] enough state and john marks after prayer
[15:03] meetings
[15:04] right
[15:05] they're praying they are praying and
[15:07] fasting every day
[15:09] and they're in that prayer mode on the
[15:10] illegals came down day of pentecost
[15:13] amen remember one crowd was even alive
[15:15] they don't pray
[15:16] they don't pray did they pray no
[15:18] but okay
[15:20] they don't know how to pray but the
[15:22] bible say jesus pray all the time
[15:24] we've seen the bible i heard that the
[15:26] lord would take them to the mountain and
[15:27] so you stay here you see that
[15:30] got a question stay here and you know go
[15:32] for that and lead them pray
[15:34] amen somebody
[15:36] i'll pray
[15:38] and after it's done he said oh come on
[15:39] let's go
[15:40] they don't they don't have they don't
[15:42] know how to pray
[15:43] one day they felt bad about they said
[15:45] lord please teach us how to pray
[15:48] and lord said when you pray you say our
[15:51] father
[15:52] which are in heaven hallelujah then and
[15:54] they taught them about we know this
[15:55] story
[15:56] amen
[15:58] praise the lord
[16:02] neither did adam need to pray in the
[16:03] beginning
[16:04] because it was god
[16:06] he didn't know the fasts in the garden
[16:08] of eden
[16:10] he wasn't fellowshipped with god
[16:12] he was eternal
[16:13] himself knew adam knew all things
[16:16] he was god over the earth
[16:18] so what need for prayers for other he
[16:20] doesn't need it none
[16:23] the bible told us that adam had dominion
[16:25] right at the beginning
[16:27] he was god over the whole earth
[16:30] why the almighty god was god about the
[16:32] whole universe
[16:34] and adam and eve and unicorns speak
[16:36] things to their existence
[16:38] they could create things with just their
[16:40] words
[16:42] hallelujah somebody adam has so much
[16:44] dominion so much that after god created
[16:46] all the animals
[16:48] he brought them to adam to name them
[16:50] why is that a bible
[16:53] and god said adam what do you call this
[16:54] he said you be called lion what about
[16:57] this you are leopard what about you you
[16:59] eagle what are you you dove
[17:02] and that's the name of this column today
[17:05] that's what i call dominion amen
[17:07] somebody
[17:08] come to genesis 2 genesis 2 verse 9 19.
[17:12] genesis verse 19 to 20.
[17:15] and under the ground the lord god formed
[17:17] every beast of the field
[17:19] and every fall of the air
[17:21] and brought them onto adam to see what
[17:23] he will call them
[17:25] and whatever adam called every living
[17:27] creature that was the name thereof
[17:30] now that's what i call doing dominion
[17:33] that's authority
[17:35] amen that's why he didn't
[17:37] pray
[17:39] it has an eternal dominion kingship over
[17:42] the earth amen
[17:45] i kind of love how the holy ghost
[17:47] describes adamic dominion in the bible
[17:49] we turn to some some chapter eight
[17:52] psalms eight verse five which paul
[17:54] quoted in hebrews 1 verse 10 to 14.
[17:57] psalm 8 verse 4 let's see how the bible
[18:00] describes adam's dominion i want to
[18:02] refer to that then feminine is very
[18:04] close
[18:05] say what is men that are mindful of him
[18:09] and the son of man that thou vist him
[18:12] but that has made him a little lower
[18:14] than the angels
[18:16] and that's crowning with glory and honor
[18:19] that we don't have dominion
[18:21] for the worst of their hands
[18:24] does put all things under his feet
[18:28] all sheep
[18:29] and oxen
[18:30] air and the beast of the field
[18:33] they follow the air
[18:35] and the fish of the sea
[18:37] and whatever passes passes through the
[18:39] paths of the seas
[18:41] oh lord our lord
[18:43] how excellent is the name
[18:46] in all the earth
[18:48] now tell me how can a man need prayer in
[18:50] this glorious
[18:52] supernatural condition
[18:53] he doesn't need it adam don't need to
[18:55] pray
[18:57] he doesn't need to no no he knows all
[18:59] things
[19:00] he lacked nothing amen
[19:02] he was king over the earth
[19:04] but after then came the fall of in
[19:06] genesis 3 which you all know the story
[19:07] oh they fell through the last of the
[19:09] serpent
[19:10] a man lost his dominion and kingdom
[19:12] through disobedience to god's word
[19:15] and he was killed of the garden of eden
[19:18] and i i'm glad tonight
[19:21] that is not the end of the story amen
[19:24] somebody aren't you glad tonight
[19:26] for god promised to redeem them back
[19:30] which he achieved by the blood on
[19:32] calvary eli
[19:33] amen
[19:35] and the goodness of our own association
[19:37] back to identities because

[20:19] or churches
[20:20] see from jesus christ who is the
[20:22] faithful witness and the first begotten
[20:24] of the dead and the prince of the kings

[20:28] unto him that loved us and watched us
[20:30] from our sins in his own blood
[20:32] and made us kings
[20:35] and priests
[20:36] unto god and his father
[20:39] to him be glory
[20:41] and dominion
[20:42] forever and ever amen
[20:46] also revelation chapter 5 verse 6 to 10
[20:48] it also says
[20:49] and i behave like lord in the midst of
[20:51] the throne and of the four beasts
[20:53] and the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[20:56] as they have been slain having seven
[20:58] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[21:01] spirits of god
[21:02] sent from forth into the all to all the
[21:04] earth
[21:05] and he came unto the book under the
[21:07] right hand of him that sat upon the
[21:09] throne
[21:10] which is the book of redemption which is
[21:12] the bible the bible
[21:14] is the bible also he means somebody
[21:17] physically open revelation 10 verse 1.
[21:20] and when you're taking the book the four
[21:22] beasts and the four
[21:23] four
[21:24] and twenty elders fell down before the
[21:26] lamb
[21:27] having every one of them harp and golden
[21:29] vials full of order
[21:31] which are the prayers of the saints
[21:34] and they sang a new song saying
[21:36] thou art worthy to take the book
[21:40] and to open the seals thereof
[21:42] for that was slain and as redeemer
[21:44] redeemed us to god
[21:47] by thy blood
[21:48] out of every kindred and tongue and
[21:51] people and nation
[21:52] and has made us unto god our king
[21:56] our god kings and priests
[21:59] and we shall reign on the earth
[22:02] he means somebody
[22:04] and he found out that the the oppressor
[22:06] said this is why these elders are were
[22:08] just because because
[22:10] no one was found worried on art and have
[22:12] to open the
[22:13] to take the book
[22:15] until the lamb stepped out of the throne
[22:17] and checked the book
[22:18] and
[22:19] said
[22:20] john wept the bible says that also he
[22:23] wept
[22:24] because if nobody take the book you'll
[22:26] everyone is finished amen
[22:29] hallelujah somebody
[22:31] so we found out that after the fall of
[22:33] man
[22:34] the first
[22:36] one to start praying calling upon the
[22:38] name of the lord was said
[22:40] bible says so
[22:43] whom god gave adam to replace abel
[22:45] whom cain slew
[22:47] turn to genesis with me genesis chapter
[22:49] 4
[22:49] verse 25
[22:52] yes genesis 4 25 another knew his wife
[22:55] again and she based on and called his
[22:57] name seth
[22:59] for god said she
[23:01] had appointed me an an another seed
[23:04] instead of abel whom can sleep
[23:07] and to say to him also there was one son
[23:10] that called his name inus
[23:12] then began meant to call
[23:16] upon the name of the lord for the first
[23:17] time ever
[23:19] see certainly was something was wrong
[23:20] style rebecca he knew daddy and mommy
[23:23] messed up
[23:25] i knew i need god's help i can't bear
[23:27] this button alone
[23:28] and that should be
[23:29] a believer's attitude
[23:31] you're saying that i must tell jesus
[23:34] i must tell jesus i cannot bear
[23:37] my
[23:38] burdens alone
[23:40] hallelujah
[23:42] that's right attitude believers
[23:44] because there is power in prayers
[23:47] back to our test this tonight we read in
[23:49] a text today david saying in some
[23:51] psalm 116 i love the lord because he had
[23:54] heard my voice
[23:56] and my supplications
[23:58] because he had a clan his ear unto me
[24:02] therefore will like call upon him
[24:04] as long as i live
[24:06] and also in the book of james also we
[24:08] read
[24:09] jesus 5
[24:10] verse 14 said is any man among you
[24:13] afflicted
[24:14] let him pray
[24:16] is any merry let me sing swarms
[24:18] send a sing among you let me call for
[24:21] the elders of the church
[24:22] and let them pray over him
[24:25] and anoint him with oil in the name of
[24:27] the lord
[24:28] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[24:30] sick
[24:31] and lord shall raise him up raise them
[24:33] up
[24:34] and we are committed since
[24:36] they shall be forgiving him
[24:38] i want to notice something of god
[24:42] that all does not heal
[24:44] you because the blood that heals you
[24:48] that blood is just a bumper to somebody
[24:51] that's a process it's a bumper between
[24:54] the one praying for you
[24:56] and the and the sickness
[24:58] because when you pray for the sick and
[25:00] you don't have faith
[25:01] it's going to come upon you but when i
[25:03] say as long as i know we have that all
[25:05] sister rebecca
[25:06] and that that will go back to hell where
[25:08] i come from
[25:10] so that all is a bumper
[25:12] even somebody
[25:14] that all does not hear
[25:16] what the blood of christ heals
[25:18] amen somebody
[25:20] thank you lord jesus
[25:23] the healing
[25:25] is an atonement
[25:27] he cried down on the cross it was double
[25:29] atonement brother brian brian
[25:31] this double atonement
[25:33] amen
[25:34] christ died for our saints sister
[25:37] sashiron he is all there for
[25:40] our sicknesses that's the bible isaiah
[25:43] 53 assassination 3 verse 4
[25:46] as if it was proceeds
[25:48] surely
[25:49] absolutely
[25:51] he had borne our griefs
[25:53] and created our
[25:54] sorrows yeah we did esteem him stricken
[25:57] speaking of god and afflicted
[26:00] but
[26:01] he was wounded for our transgressions
[26:04] he was bruised for our iniquities
[26:06] this church targeting our peace was upon
[26:09] him
[26:10] and with his stress we are healed
[26:14] hallelujah somebody
[26:17] see
[26:18] wonderful our transgression and with his
[26:20] strength were healed
[26:21] double atomized
[26:23] through the blood they met somebody
[26:25] that blood was shed
[26:27] that's isaiah looking at calvary in the
[26:29] future
[26:30] it was the prophet then promised then
[26:32] but after that after the blood was
[26:34] shaped like a lie
[26:36] many years after peter looked back to
[26:39] calvary
[26:41] he said by whose stripes you are healed
[26:44] now is past tense it's history
[26:48] you are healed already accept your
[26:49] healing somebody tonight amen somebody
[26:54] the power of prayers
[26:56] prayer changes things
[26:59] i just try to close on this thought to
[27:00] that tonight
[27:02] i really noticed today that people don't
[27:03] pray like they do in the past in this
[27:06] message
[27:07] pastor paul
[27:08] and first in the message we used to pray
[27:10] a lot
[27:11] is that not that pastor
[27:13] now we're kind of relaxed
[27:16] we everything comfortable around us
[27:19] when we are broke we have our credit
[27:20] cards
[27:22] we are sick we have our insurance to run
[27:24] to
[27:25] yet does not heal you he heals you
[27:29] hallelujah somebody
[27:30] he's the healer
[27:32] and he's here with us tonight
[27:34] if you assist now i challenge your faith
[27:36] to be healed
[27:37] you my lord will heal you
[27:39] amen somebody
[27:40] people are so soft
[27:42] they don't pray anymore they don't see
[27:44] any reason for it
[27:46] that's so sad we need to stop we're
[27:47] going to change to change from that
[27:49] and that's the answer this age last age
[27:52] let's look one minute
[27:54] blind and wretched are making and don't
[27:56] even know it
[27:58] what is that connection to be
[28:00] let's turn to revelation 3 verse 14 also
[28:03] where the holy ghost identify the spirit
[28:06] of this lucom age
[28:09] revelation 3 14 announcer unto the angel
[28:11] of the church of louisiana's right
[28:14] they sincerely even amen
[28:16] the fatal and true witnesses
[28:19] the beginning of the creation of god
[28:23] i know that works no i know you are
[28:27] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[28:32] i would that that was called a heart
[28:36] so then because that are lukewarm
[28:38] neither cold not hot you know why they
[28:41] are not cold or hot
[28:43] because they are sticking on the church
[28:46] the second bible
[28:48] but they're not off the power in christ
[28:50] they don't play anymore
[28:52] you know that some people don't even
[28:53] read the bible anymore
[28:55] they're going to turn to the bible
[28:57] they only draw something for all the
[28:58] pastor preached all the time
[29:00] shouldn't be like that
[29:02] no so it shouldn't be like that
[29:05] we feed on god's word
[29:07] as believers
[29:08] the bible the lord said men shall not
[29:11] only vibrate alone by every word
[29:14] alleluia somebody
[29:15] you cannot depend on what the preacher
[29:17] only preaches you must feed or need
[29:18] yourself new house
[29:23] verse 16 so then just give me a few more
[29:25] minutes okay sir
[29:27] so so versus said so then because that
[29:30] at lukewarm and neither corner hall
[29:33] i will spill the out of my mouth now i
[29:36] will throw you out of my presence
[29:38] 17
[29:39] because thou said i am rich
[29:42] and increased with goods
[29:43] having known nothing
[29:45] and knowing us doubt not that thou art
[29:47] wretched
[29:48] and miserable and poor
[29:51] and blind
[29:52] and naked
[29:55] a council need to buy of me gold tried
[29:57] in the fire that there must be rich and
[30:00] white remain that there must be clothes
[30:02] and that the shame of their nakedness
[30:04] do not appear and anoint their eyes with
[30:07] eye serve
[30:09] that thou may see
[30:11] as soon as i love i rebuke and chasten
[30:15] be zealous therefore and repent
[30:18] behold i stand at the door and
[30:20] knock but the brown said that door is
[30:23] not though of the church that were
[30:24] taught in the organizations

[30:37] and open the door i will come into him
[30:40] and will sup with him and heal with me
[30:44] i'll leave somebody tonight
[30:46] the devil is giving us so much today on
[30:48] our place
[30:49] plates
[30:51] to hinder our from praying as we should
[30:53] as believers
[30:55] yet the bible says
[30:58] to pray without ceasing
[31:00] now
[31:01] do not stop praying
[31:03] 1st thessalonians chapter 5 verse 17
[31:05] says so and in 42 verse 8 it says i will
[31:09] therefore that men pray everywhere
[31:12] and women women also
[31:15] lifting up holy hands
[31:16] without doubt thing and
[31:18] without wrath i'm doubting
[31:20] jeremiah verse 11 and 12 says
[31:24] if i know the thoughts that i think
[31:25] toward you
[31:26] say the lord
[31:28] the thoughts of peace
[31:30] and not of evil
[31:32] to give you an expected end
[31:35] then shall you call upon me
[31:38] and you shall go and pray unto me
[31:41] i will i will hacking unto you
[31:44] amen somebody tonight
[31:46] my brother's my sister tonight

[31:53] god still answers prayers

[32:00] and it is elias was a man
[32:03] subject to life passions that as we are
[32:05] sister jean and he prayed honestly
[32:09] that might not rain and rain not on the
[32:11] earth by the space of three years and
[32:13] six months
[32:15] a man like us
[32:17] and he prayed again
[32:18] and the heaven gave rain
[32:20] and the earth brought forth her fruit
[32:23] and guess what we are having the same
[32:24] god of elijah today

[32:30] forever
[32:32] he does not chamber the
[32:33] kenny

[33:46] committing suicide
[33:48] but she did not give up
[33:51] what what what rather she choose the

[39:49] they were not here
[39:51] and what is the iniquity of god what's
[39:53] iniquity but the grant said iniquities
[39:55] know the writing and refuse to do it
[39:58] and sin is unbelieving the god's god's
[39:59] word
[40:00] amen
[40:02] it means somebody
[40:04] yet our lord still answers prayers
[40:06] for prayer changes things
[40:08] in the message of perfect faith but the
[40:10] brahman said name and that message
[40:11] prophet faith faith august 25 93
[40:15] say if you're if you're a christian you
[40:17] have right to any redemptive blessings
[40:20] that jesus died for you for
[40:22] it's all yours it's already already paid
[40:24] for
[40:26] you just have to believe it
[40:28] not imagine it
[40:29] but believe it
[40:31] another is yours
[40:33] and you can possess it
[40:35] oh
[40:36] that is the concrete faith amen somebody
[40:40] hallelujah somebody
[40:42] listen god does not answer your prayer
[40:45] on your own merits
[40:46] on how good you are or holy unrighteous
[40:48] you are no
[40:50] god answers prayer because he is
[40:51] faithful to his word
[40:53] in the message fellowship by redemption
[40:55] uh april 3rd 1955 brother brown said
[40:58] look god has never promised to meet any
[41:00] man upon his merits
[41:02] upon how good he is
[41:04] or how good she is
[41:06] he has never promised to meet them there
[41:09] there's there's no full relationship
[41:11] with god upon your own marriage
[41:14] the only place there is fellowship is
[41:15] under the shed blood hallelujah somebody
[41:18] i can have
[41:19] some jubilee dance now i can have them
[41:21] down some dance i feel like dancing now
[41:24] hallelujah
[41:25] because i ain't no good people of god
[41:27] i'm no good
[41:28] i'm a sinner saved by grace
[41:30] i'm not worthy people of god but he is
[41:32] worthy tonight
[41:35] he means somebody
[41:37] you know
[41:38] i i know you probably heard my testimony
[41:39] last time
[41:41] that i suffered stroke twice
[41:44] remember i told you here in the other
[41:45] church
[41:46] has struck swift twice
[41:50] my mother was still sideways sister
[41:52] becky
[41:53] my
[41:54] son was paralyzed
[41:56] in texas when i was working in the oil
[41:58] field
[41:59] my son last in florida he was here not
[42:01] long ago
[42:02] said that it's over for daddy
[42:04] you know you know i preach again
[42:07] what am i doing tonight
[42:10] there was a lie of somebody
[42:12] he is a loser
[42:14] hallelujah
[42:16] because our gossip answers pray at
[42:18] somebody
[42:19] and after god healing healing pastor
[42:21] apostle paul
[42:22] do you know how many sons have sent to
[42:24] the kingdom
[42:25] in nigeria i went to a convention i
[42:27] baptized 50 souls in one service one
[42:30] salmon what 50 people baptized in
[42:32] christ's name
[42:34] i went to colombia
[42:36] south america and when you suffer for
[42:38] god
[42:40] why because god answers prayers people
[42:42] of god
[42:43] you can't stop if you're a child of god
[42:44] you believe god no devil can stop you
[42:48] just learn to wait on him
[42:52] for god's sake answer prayers amen
[42:56] i'm going to read this quote in closing
[42:59] if you don't mind here quickly is that
[43:01] okay pastor
[43:03] thank you sir in the messy expectation
[43:05] um
[43:06] uh february 1761 but abram says was
[43:09] talking about i said
[43:11] what man cause great god calls foolish
[43:15] and well man calls foolish god calls
[43:17] grace
[43:19] so what we've got to do is get back into
[43:22] the program of god
[43:23] and find out after all what god wants us
[43:27] to do
[43:28] and the only way i know to do it is
[43:30] prayer
[43:31] amen prayer is the key
[43:34] that is the answer
[43:36] prayer changes things
[43:39] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[43:42] was ever put in the control of human
[43:44] beings
[43:45] there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen
[43:47] bomb or as powerful as prayer
[43:50] prayer will change the mind of god
[43:53] did you know that
[43:54] he did this one time
[43:56] you know
[43:57] what i'm going to close pastor i'm sorry

[46:50] anyway he didn't send him anywhere no
[46:53] from his background being a muslim he
