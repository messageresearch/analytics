========================================

Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] Oh, the trials of this world were getting stronger. [Music] The pool I felt was more than I could bear. And I was on the verge of giving over. The strength within myself just wasn't there. But something keeps holding me. Every day I see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials, guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. Satan laid before me his temptation of his desire to steal away all my faith. [Music] But I felt within my soul a revelation. It was the strength I had to have to keep me in this race. Something keeps holding me. [Applause] Every day I see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials, guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. That's how I know my redeemer lives. Yes, I know my redeemer lives. Let all creation testify and let the light within me cry. I know my redeemer lives. Yes, he lives to take away my pain. [Music] Yes, he lives forever. I'll proclaim that the payment for my sin was a precious life he gave. Now he's alive. This isn't a secret. Yes, I know my redeemer lives. [Music] I know my redeemer lives. Let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. I know my redeemer lives. Let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. I know Jesus keeps holding me. Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 11, if you read with me. For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. Now I wonder why he had to say that this commandment and this word that's come from God from heaven to his people, it's not far from you. Why would he have to say that? because people begin to feel like it's a far off. It's unreachable. How many has ever felt like that I just feel like I'm a I'm a loner and this is the things that's being preached is it's unreachable to me. God seem How many's ever felt like God is just so far away from me. &gt;&gt; And so this word that he said he's given. He said, I I want to let you know that it's not hidden. It's not hidden and neither is it far off. Goes on to say, it is not in heaven. It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say, "Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it?" You don't have to do that. Who's going to go up to heaven and bring it down? Because that had already happened here when God sent his word through Moses and brought the word to the people. Then he says, "Neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say, who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it." So the theme is is that don't let the devil tell you that it's so far away from you. God has brought it close and it's closer to you than you think. &gt;&gt; In other words, my theme today, God does not want these things to be distant from you. He wants to bring it personal to you. &gt;&gt; How close is it? Verse 14, but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth. and in thy heart. &gt;&gt; That's pretty close. &gt;&gt; And if it's not there today, then he's letting you know that's where he wants us to be. He wants the word to be in your mouth and in your heart. It's neither in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it. I have one more scripture in the New Testament in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord. This also speaks of a pretty close relationship. It's not distance. It's open face. It's face to face. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We all with open face beholding is in the glass. The glory of the Lord. What happens? Are changed into the same image from glory to glory. Notice it doesn't say a one-time event or being changed one night at an altar, but we are constantly changed &gt;&gt; as we're looking in his face. We're constantly changed from glory to glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. I believe in change. I believe we can keep changing and it's by staying with our face in the face of Jesus Christ. People think that they're more connected today because of social media. &gt;&gt; They think that I'm more connected with people than I ever have been in my life because of social media. I want to let you know that's not completely a true connection. &gt;&gt; That's not a face-toface connection. And actually, culture trains us to be that way that we start to believe that that's a connection. And people con are convinced that they're more connected than they've ever been with social media, but we're not really connected. We're actually less connected than we've ever been. Relationships are suffering and relationships are going ary because we think that we're connected because we're on our phone connected with the whole world, but you're not really connected. &gt;&gt; It's really deceiving us into thinking that we're connected when we're when we're by ourselves. we're we're by ourselves with our phone and that we we're deceived into thinking that we're we're connected that way. Uh and and it's it's it's that somehow that we're connected to the cyber world. So, we're connected and none of it is face to face. So, that that can teach us that because we are at church, uh sometimes we feel like we're personally corrected connected to Christ. Just because we're at church doesn't mean we're connected. This morning, &gt;&gt; I might say some things that offend you, but just give me a chance here and just think about it because I like to talk about what's really real. There could be a possibility that you could be in church but not be connected. &gt;&gt; The culture has kind of made us that way to where we we have a slot and we do something, it's got to be pretty quick. I have a hard time preaching for an hour, an hour and a half because we're we have we're in a generation of ADD, attention and deficit disorder. We've been taught to have everything quick and so we've got it done. We've got a certain time for church. We got to get going. And so it's difficult. We see now we're being taught to be that way. We're being cultured into that way. &gt;&gt; And as I've said before, it doesn't work with the Bible or the scripture because the Bible says, "Be still and know that I'm God." Be still and know God. How many want to know God this morning? You're going to have to learn how to be still to take some time and listen to his voice. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength." Anybody want to have new strength this morning? Well, it doesn't come quick. We have to wait upon the Lord. So, all this culture that we get is completely contrary with connecting with this Christ. &gt;&gt; I think I would tell the truth about it because we all fall under this uh cultural wave that we're in. So, we just because we're in church doesn't mean we're connected. Because we have a Bible app on our phone does not mean we're connected. That you're connected with your friends from camp on your phone doesn't mean you're connected. Does not mean you're connected with Christ. and and and we we went from, you know, I was thinking last night, we've gone from deep face-to-face conversations, spiritual conversation, you know, when we didn't have our phones before and didn't have all this, we went from deep face-to-face conversations. We then we went to texting and then we moved to FaceTime. What is that FaceTime? It's not really FaceTime. We moved to FaceTime. Then we moved to chats. just chats. And everybody everybody notice how we're moving now from something that's lengthy and a meaningful deep conversation. I only have time for just a chat. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Go ahead and be quiet if you want to. &gt;&gt; Culture is moving us into this. &gt;&gt; And that wasn't enough. You know what's next? Snapchat. Not just a chat, but it has to be a Snapchat. It has to be quicker because I don't have time. I just want to have a flash of picture. Show me what you're doing. I'll show you what I'm doing. I'm on to the next thing. &gt;&gt; Snapchat. In this world, there's an attack on time for relationships because relationships take time. &gt;&gt; Let's start with our relationship with the Lord. Relationships take time and we're being robbed of our time for things that really don't matter. But what's what's suffering? Relationship. Our relationship with the Lord is s we're not connecting with the Lord like we should. &gt;&gt; We're not connecting with our children like we should. We're not connecting with our families. We don't have to do it. And and and it comes, as I said, to to a Snapchat. These these these names that they give stuff really say something sometimes and we don't pick up on it, but it's it's really saying where we're going. We have to be discerning Christians. We can't just swallow all this like the rest of the world does &gt;&gt; because their relationships are hurting. We have the Lord to call on for relationships, but their relationships are really the highest divorce rate we ever had. People had all kinds of abuse, all kinds of things. There's no connection whatsoever. Fathers to children and marriages and all these other things. And you're going to tell me that that doesn't have uh that doesn't have a association with it. that somehow it's teaching us that the relationship I don't have the time to put into it. I'm on to the next thing. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me it's not related. It is related. And we need to be discerning Christians. Can you say amen? In this world, there's an attack on time for relationship. And the same people who are incredibly connected to the whole world on their phone are the same ones sometimes saying they've never been more lonely. Oh, tell the truth, brother Paul. &gt;&gt; The same ones that say they're more connected than they've ever been are experiencing loneliness and some of them depression. &gt;&gt; Now, how can you be connected with everybody around the world and have that? Well, some other reasons for depressions come, but I can tell you sometimes they scientifically is associated with social media more depressed people than we've ever had. &gt;&gt; But they say they're connected. &gt;&gt; It's because it's not a true connection. &gt;&gt; And I wonder if all of this makes us very shallow people instead of the deep people we should be. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can guarantee you Christ is not wanting a Snapchat chat relationship with you. &gt;&gt; Every now and then a quick prayer. Hey bro, help me out. I'm in need of help in this situation. God does not want a Snapchat response from you. &gt;&gt; God's wanting relationship with you. &gt;&gt; God's wanting time with you. Can you say amen? Lal Harris sang a song years ago and I've I've always been moved by the lyric. He said in the verse, "There he was just waiting in our old familiar place, an empty spot beside him where once I used to wait to be filled with strength and wisdom for the battles of the day. I would have passed him by again if I didn't hear him say." And the chorus goes, "I miss my time with you. those moments together. I need to be with you each day. And it hurts me when you say you're too busy busy trying to serve me. That's right. &gt;&gt; Busy trying to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; But how can you serve me? The Lord says, when your spirit's empty, there's a longing in my heart, wanting more than just part of you. It's true. God says, I miss my time with you. Second verse says, "What will I have to offer?" How can I truly care? My efforts have no meaning when your presence isn't there. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But you'll provide the power. If I take time to pray, I'll stay right here beside you. And you'll never have to say, "I miss my time with you." &gt;&gt; Those moments together, I need to be with you each day. And it hurts me when you say, "You're too busy." busy trying to serve me. My heart is longing for more than just a part of you. It's true. God says, "I miss my time with you." &gt;&gt; I just wish I could continue on in this because this is where we're at. &gt;&gt; God has called us to the deepest relationship. You know, I referred to a term called the third pole. If you don't understand that on the broadcast or here today when I return when I referred to the third pole of Jesus ministry which is repeated again in the last days God had different levels and Jesus had different levels of a his ministry. Number one was a first part and it was healing. We are a three-part being and so the first pole dealt with physically. In other words, we're a body, we're a spirit, we're a soul. The second part was our spirit and that was the second pole. That was discernment. Jesus healed the sick and then he discerned the thoughts and the intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; But there was a third part. It's the deepest place that Christ could go. That third pole, that third area, it takes us deeper into a personal, you know what the third pole is? It's a personal It's a personal relationship with him. It's a personal experience with the supernatural God. &gt;&gt; And it's not just a one time at the altar event. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a constant change from glory to glory &gt;&gt; as we're close to him face to face. How many this morning want a face to face relationship with Christ? How many would like to exit some of these things that we're so bought into that's making us everything has to be quick and and puff potatoes and quick this and fast food and going in and out. We've got to realize, listen, this is doing damage to the way we look at God and the way we look at relationships. How many wants a FaceTime relationship with God? A real FaceTime &gt;&gt; and not a Snapchat. I don't want to have just a Snapchat every morning with my Lord. I want to take my Bible. I want to look to the word. I say, "Lord, this is more important than anything else in my life." You may not have time in the morning with your job, but there has to be time that you not only spend with him, but you have time to communicate with him. And he has time to communicate with you every day through the day. &gt;&gt; David said, "Blessed be the name of the Lord who daily loadeth us with his benefits." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Give us this day our daily bread." Let me communicate with him daily. Can you say amen? Because the glory of God is wanting to change you personally. the transition to this third pole or this third deeper part of Jesus ministry. And if you if you don't understand that the same God can change his ministry to a deeper way of dealing with us, then you need to know your scripture better. Because some people, in fact, most people in Christianity only know Jesus at certain levels. Jesus as the healer, Jesus as compassion, Jesus as the discerner of hearts, but we need all of Christ revealed to us. &gt;&gt; And so we we have to look at this because he's he's dealing deeper with his people today than he's ever dealt with. He uses ordinary people that we would not expect. In that transition from Moses to Joshua, the ministry changed. And when it changed from the prophet to Joshua taking the people in the promised land, then we the first battle in Jericho that God used two men, no names, didn't know who they were. Two men to go in spy out Jericho. And while they're in there, there's a harlot Rahab that that notice now the two men, we don't even know if they had been with Moses. They probably hadn't. So they hadn't been around the prophet. They were just around Joshua. And this Rahab, she didn't even know Moses and who he was. Never even heard Moses. And yet faith dropped in a harlot's heart to speak the word. &gt;&gt; Now, how does she deserve to get this third pole of speaking the word? How does she because friends, that's the third pole. It's the spoken word upon the lips. That's why I read the scripture. The word is not far away. It's nigh thee in thy mouth. When you have the spoken word on the lips of the people, then you have the third Paul. &gt;&gt; Then you have Christ and what he's wanting to do. &gt;&gt; It's upon the lips of the people. It's the spoken word on your lips. And now Rahab, she didn't deserve this. She hadn't gone through any. She hadn't even been to the altar. She hadn't done nothing. But somehow in the grace of God something drops in her heart and she becomes used to speak I want this. I want this &gt;&gt; and so they spoke said here she said I want this and I want it for my family. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; She hadn't earned anything yet. &gt;&gt; She hadn't earned credibility with the body of Christ yet. She didn't know Moses. Never heard Moses. And yet under this, catch it now. We know the glory of God was upon Moses' face when he brought the word. &gt;&gt; But now the glory of God comes in the heart of a harlot &gt;&gt; and she speaks the word. &gt;&gt; What's my point today? The glory of God is not just to stay in the word, but the glory is to become personal to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just the ministry changing. It's us changing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How much more personal can you get? There's Moses message. It was the message of God. There's a great army under Joshua believing it. They're ready to go into the promised land. And that's where God is working, right? That's where he's working. He's working in the big army. The message ranks. It's working in the army. He's working under Joshua. That's where God's working. He's He only worked under Moses. Some people tell us he only worked under Moses and now he's working under Joshua. It's a great army ready to go into the promised land. No, it wasn't that. He grabbed a harlot and moved upon her heart. And the word came and Jericho was fitted for destruction. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she lived inside Jericho as a harlot. And here it's fitted with destruction. And here too, no names. The word came on her lips. With no training, she's going off the witness of two no-name brothers. This glory is to come and be naive in thy mouth. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? This glory is not to stay in books and tapes. It's not to stay on an app on your phone. &gt;&gt; This glory is to come upon our hearts, &gt;&gt; our lips, &gt;&gt; to speak this word again. &gt;&gt; It's a thought. It's the thought of God. And it stays a thought until you speak it. &gt;&gt; And then it begins to materialize. &gt;&gt; Work that way. Before the beginning, God in his thoughts, when he spoke the thought, as soon as he spoke something, this whole earth begin to materialize. Well, if the word is the same, it's the same with us today. Say, "What in the world are you preaching?" I'm preaching Mark 11:23. If you say to this mountain, "Be thou removed." Can I have some faith this morning? This is not unscriptural. This is the deeper move God's taking you to. We're here in this life for more than just a job and more than just, you know, just going through the motions. No, we're here to have a personal relationship with him that he can use the spoken word of God upon our lips. What are you going to point your kids to in this world? There's nothing to point to. Point them to this word. Teach it back in Deuteronomy 23 where he says, "Teach this to your children. Put it on the doorpost of your house. Let it be heard in your home. put it in front of them all the time because that's the only thing that's going to last in this life. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen out of the families? We have an absolute. We have a word from the Lord. And that absolute is the only stable thing. You young couples, there's nothing else stable in this world. Bring that word into your home. Teach it to your family. Let them see it lived out every day. And you go to messing with it. and you're messing with their minds and you're messing with your lives for the future. But the promise is if you'll get a hold of this with your heart and you say, "Lord, whatever your word says to do, we're going to apply that to our home." You will get a blessing in your life and your children will be blessed when you're gone someday. &gt;&gt; How's God how's God going to do with that? Cuz you some of you sitting here don't have your children. You don't worry about how God's going to do it. You grab a hold of this. I'm going to put this image and this word in front of my kids. I'm going to bring the glory of God in my home. They're going to see it. &gt;&gt; And don't let it be just dos and don'ts where it's a drudgery. You know, how can kids have a passion for the Christ that you're trying to show them when you have no passion for him yourself? It's a drudgery to come to church. It's a drudgery. You're not in the message at all. How can they be impressed with that? Let them see this is not dos and don'ts. This is the passion of Jesus Christ. This is a lifestyle for me. And then if they go astray, then you got the promise God will bring them back someday &gt;&gt; cuz you put the right image in front of them. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; We're not perfect parents. There's no perfect parent in here. The only perfect parent is our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But because we're looking at a perfect parent and we keep our eyes on him, our mistakes, God will override those things &gt;&gt; if we'll put this word in front of our families. You see, this isn't a one time at the altar one time deal. &gt;&gt; We're changed from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; What needs to change? Well, you go in and you got a habit of smoking. God comes out. You couldn't get over it. you took all the pills or you did everything. You got the patch and all of a sudden Christ comes in and just he just delivers you from those filthy cigarettes. &gt;&gt; Delivers you from an adulterous lifestyle. Delivers you from habits of cursing. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Takes the Lord. Some of you are bad cursors. &gt;&gt; Nobody's saying amen. You're I Some of you very professional cussers. But Christ comes in your life and that thing is is laid down. &gt;&gt; So he does a lot of the big stuff, but he's not done with you &gt;&gt; because as I preach over and over again, &gt;&gt; there's deeply hidden heart issues laying there sometimes. &gt;&gt; Jealousies, bitterness, past wrongs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Values that are not God values. They're worldly values. And it's all laying there for some reason. And God's not finished with us yet. His glory has to come in and keep changing us, &gt;&gt; changing us from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; For watching our service today, if you would like more information, please contact us by visiting our website, literalife.urch.
