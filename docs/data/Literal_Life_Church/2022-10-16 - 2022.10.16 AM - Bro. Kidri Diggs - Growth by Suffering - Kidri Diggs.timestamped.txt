[2:55] that we'll just continue to be molded to
[2:57] this this one body one mind one Spirit
[3:00] Lord that the Bible speaks of Lord Lord
[3:03] we just ask father that in this moment
[3:06] the Holy Ghost will have total
[3:07] preeminence
[3:08] in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we
[3:10] pray the Church Say Amen
[3:12] amen praise the Lord if you have your
[3:15] Bibles let's turn to um
[3:18] let's go to Job chapter one first
[3:23] Job chapter one
[3:32] then we're gonna go to Saint John
[3:33] chapter 15.
[3:38] Job chapter 1
[3:40] verse
[3:43] let's start at verse
[3:45] um
[3:46] six
[3:52] you have to say man
[3:54] the Bible says now there was a day when
[3:57] the sons of God came to present
[3:59] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[4:01] came also among them
[4:03] and the Lord said unto Satan once come
[4:06] as thou then Satan answered
[4:09] the Lord and said from going to and fro
[4:13] in the Earth
[4:14] and from walking up and down in it
[4:19] sounds like he's very desperate
[4:23] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[4:26] Duff job fear God for naught
[4:30] let me back up verse verse 8. and the
[4:33] Lord said unto Satan has thou considered
[4:35] my servant job that there is none like
[4:38] him in the earth a perfect and upright
[4:41] man
[4:42] one that feareth God and obscures Evil
[4:46] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[4:49] Duff job fear God for not has thou
[4:53] has not Thou made and hedge about him
[4:57] in about his house and about all that he
[5:01] had on every side thou has blessed the
[5:04] work of his hands and his substance is
[5:07] increased in the land now this is Satan
[5:10] testifying back to God what he sees over
[5:13] job's life
[5:15] so no matter what you might think of
[5:16] yourself the devil knows who you are
[5:19] and he knows whether the hand of God is
[5:21] upon your life the question is do you
[5:24] know it
[5:25] verse 11 he says put forth thine hand
[5:28] now and touch all that he hath and he
[5:31] will curse thee to thy face and the Lord
[5:34] said unto Satan behold all that he hath
[5:38] is in thy power only upon himself put
[5:41] not forth thy hand so Satan went forth
[5:45] from the presence of the Lord
[5:48] Saint John chapter 15.
[5:56] and we're going to start at verse 1.
[6:04] Saint John 15 and 1 the Bible says
[6:08] I am the True Vine and my father is the
[6:11] husband man every branch in me that
[6:13] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[6:17] every branch that beareth fruit he
[6:19] purges it that it may bring forth more
[6:23] fruit now ye are clean through my word
[6:26] which I have spoken unto you
[6:29] amen may the Lord bless you the reading
[6:31] of his word you can have your seats
[6:36] and if I can I want to I want to quote
[6:39] another scripture
[6:40] in Hebrews chapter 5. Hebrews chapter 5
[6:44] you know in verse 8.
[6:47] the Bible says though he were yet a son
[6:50] yet he learned obedience by the things
[6:52] which he suffered and being made perfect
[6:56] he became the author of Eternal
[6:58] salvation unto all that obeyed him
[7:03] now we look in the scripture this this
[7:05] right here is talking about the Lord
[7:06] Jesus
[7:07] and it says yet he learned obedience by
[7:10] the things he suffered
[7:13] and today by the grace of God I want to
[7:15] I want to I want to um change the way we
[7:18] look at suffering
[7:20] you know because I think uh we always
[7:23] look at suffering as pain and suffering
[7:26] as something that we don't want to go
[7:29] through but suffering is a part of our
[7:31] growth
[7:32] amen and if I could use that for a
[7:35] subject amen growth by suffering
[7:39] you know all spiritual growth by
[7:41] suffering and you know church when we
[7:44] when we when we seek of growth and we we
[7:46] think of birth pains and all the things
[7:48] that the prophet has laid forward
[7:50] you know that there are tests and there
[7:53] are trials that we must go through
[7:57] you know in our good days our bad days
[7:59] there is something that God is doing for
[8:02] us as believers
[8:04] and you know when I when I look at the
[8:06] Book of Job And I think about what job
[8:08] went through first things first
[8:11] every trial Hallelujah doesn't mean that
[8:14] you've done something wrong
[8:17] Hallelujah sometimes you're going
[8:19] through something simply because it's a
[8:22] growth process
[8:24] amen you take you take a little baby and
[8:26] you know as that baby begins to grow and
[8:29] you know that that child its bones begin
[8:32] to get stronger and different things
[8:34] that baby will develop something inside
[8:37] of him that makes him wants to do more
[8:40] whether whether you like it or not that
[8:42] baby will start to use his strength to
[8:45] pull up on chairs use the strength to
[8:47] pull up on tables and you have to start
[8:50] cleaning out areas so that child will
[8:52] get a hold of it but that child
[8:54] Hallelujah is built to grow
[8:57] whether you like it or not there's
[9:00] something in it that's going to make it
[9:02] grow Hallelujah and even in a growing
[9:05] process that child will get hurt that
[9:08] child will get bumps and bruises and you
[9:10] know what you can't baby it all the time
[9:13] sometimes you have to let it fall
[9:16] because it's the falling that helps us
[9:18] grow Hallelujah and you know sometimes
[9:21] God he has to allow us to fall into
[9:24] things it's not Hallelujah for our
[9:26] detriment but it's for our benefit
[9:29] because the Bible comes back and it says
[9:32] count it all joy when you fall
[9:36] into Davis Temptations Hallelujah so
[9:40] Church falling Hallelujah now I'm not
[9:42] talking about falling into sin but I'm
[9:44] saying in your journey Hallelujah there
[9:47] will be bumps and bruises but these are
[9:49] things God has put in our pathway
[9:52] now all of us everybody in this room
[9:54] have to learn how to walk
[9:57] and none of us just stood up one day and
[9:59] said hey I'm gonna walk
[10:01] no it was a process hallelujah amen when
[10:05] you realize Hallelujah that you had
[10:07] enough strength and there was somebody
[10:10] whether it was a mom or a daddy there
[10:12] was somebody in your life encouraging
[10:14] you to walk
[10:16] Hallelujah and normally that person
[10:18] stood before you Hallelujah you're not
[10:21] even knowing that you got the strength
[10:23] to walk as far as you could walk but
[10:25] that person in your life said come on
[10:27] baby
[10:30] Hallelujah
[10:33] normally
[10:35] well I ain't gonna say that
[10:38] I was outfit I was gonna boost up the
[10:40] dance for a second you know how a dad is
[10:42] a dad Hallelujah mom is always with that
[10:45] child and you know sometimes the child
[10:47] will sneak and walk without Mama even
[10:49] recognizing it because she's so busy
[10:52] she's doing everything and you know
[10:54] she's in a role she's cooking she's
[10:56] cleaning and before you know it she
[10:58] looks around and that child standing up
[10:59] smiling at her
[11:01] and she's wondering when did you learn
[11:04] to stand up on your own Hallelujah in
[11:06] church just like us hallelujah there
[11:08] will come times they'll come certain
[11:10] situations Hallelujah whether you
[11:12] realize it or not but you're standing up
[11:14] on your own
[11:16] God had already put that in you amen and
[11:19] you know you take the dad he comes home
[11:21] from work and one day that child is
[11:23] standing here and Dad just can't believe
[11:25] it he's so overwhelmed he's like come
[11:28] and son come in my baby girl and he
[11:31] begins to encourage that child and that
[11:33] child takes a step
[11:36] what is it doing it's taking a step
[11:38] towards that encouragement though it may
[11:41] fall
[11:44] Hallelujah that town may fall but it's
[11:47] the encouragement that gets that child
[11:49] back up and take another step only to
[11:52] fall again
[11:55] Hallelujah
[11:57] but God in his great grace and his great
[11:59] Mercy Hallelujah he's already knowing
[12:02] we're going to fall but he says a word
[12:04] we got the week day after day to
[12:06] encourage us to keep walking
[12:09] and every step is bringing us closer to
[12:12] the one who's encouraging us
[12:15] Hallelujah
[12:17] ain't no church as I think about growth
[12:20] and the process of growth and how it
[12:23] hurts you know and as that child
[12:25] Hallelujah whether you believe it or not
[12:28] some children they get used to falling
[12:34] so it begins a place in a life where it
[12:36] doesn't even bother them when they fall
[12:39] it's just a part of the journey
[12:41] holy so they're not afraid to take a
[12:44] step and believe because there's
[12:47] something inside of them that says get
[12:49] back up again
[12:50] that's what the scripture says the
[12:52] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[12:54] by God hallelujah what makes them
[12:56] righteous they get back up
[12:58] holy the Bible says a wicked man he'll
[13:02] dwell it right there where he's at and
[13:04] continue in that Mischief but those are
[13:06] the Righteous gets back up
[13:09] gets back up another day to walk towards
[13:11] God they don't stay in their sins
[13:13] Hallelujah and this is a time this is an
[13:17] hour of the overcomer
[13:19] Hallelujah Church we're going to fight
[13:22] battles and we're going to go through
[13:23] things that listen to me good we're
[13:25] going to go through things we have no
[13:27] explanation for
[13:31] you have no reason
[13:33] you don't even know why you're going
[13:35] through it
[13:46] but that's God's way
[13:48] Hallelujah God he puts us on a Proving
[13:52] Ground
[13:53] to show the devil that they're going to
[13:56] keep serving me no matter what
[13:58] Hallelujah because whether you realize a
[14:00] lot some things some trials some
[14:03] sufferings are no more than just a bet
[14:05] between God and the devil
[14:10] amen somebody
[14:12] it's just a bet
[14:14] and I don't know about y'all there's a
[14:16] lot of bets in my life
[14:17] hallelujah amen there's a big old table
[14:20] hallelujah amen and my table's not a
[14:23] crap table
[14:24] honey there's purpose in this thing
[14:27] Hallelujah there's something God is
[14:29] doing Hallelujah and in the casino of
[14:32] brother diggs's life Hallelujah the
[14:34] spiritual Casino amen sister Rebecca
[14:37] every table is ringed
[14:41] Hallelujah
[14:42] every game every table every
[14:45] everything is ringed Hallelujah that I
[14:48] will come out on The Winning Side
[14:51] Hallelujah so Satan is blessing his best
[14:54] but God has already rigged every table
[14:56] God has already rigged every card God
[15:00] has already rigged every dice
[15:04] Hallelujah that I that us that we will
[15:08] win my dice when the dice begin to roll
[15:12] in my life I know some of y'all think
[15:13] this brother here preaching about dice
[15:16] notice I said spiritual Casino
[15:20] hallelujah amen will not promote let's
[15:24] say this real good brother Paul we're
[15:25] not promoting the lottery
[15:28] we're not promoting gambling Hallelujah
[15:31] but life is a Gamble
[15:34] Hallelujah and I don't know about you
[15:36] guys but I got all my chips I got all my
[15:39] dice all my cards on the Lord Jesus
[15:42] Christ
[15:44] and my table is so rigged Hallelujah
[15:47] when Satan is rolling a dice Hallelujah
[15:50] thinking that I'm going to fall or I'm
[15:52] going to give up my dice they always
[15:55] fall on seven
[15:58] oh never on six because they're weighted
[16:02] Hallelujah they're reading Hallelujah
[16:04] somebody might look like six it might
[16:07] look like a day of judgment but they
[16:09] always follow completion
[16:10] [Music]
[16:11] because God is always doing something
[16:14] amen so let's stop looking at the things
[16:17] we're going through as something wrong
[16:22] when all God is doing is
[16:25] perfecting us
[16:28] amen
[16:30] see when I
[16:31] I read the scripture
[16:33] right here in Saint John
[16:36] he says every branch
[16:38] in me that bearth not fruit he taketh
[16:41] away
[16:43] how many people are in church
[16:45] and they are
[16:47] considered to be Christians but they're
[16:50] just here
[16:53] some of you may just be here today
[16:57] but if we're pulling something I want
[16:59] you to pull with me
[17:01] I don't want you to be in here just
[17:03] relying off my strength
[17:05] because what if something happens to me
[17:06] then who are you
[17:09] what if something happens to that person
[17:10] you're relying so much on then what do
[17:14] you have
[17:15] you may rely on Gideon for to lead you
[17:18] into worship what if Gideon can't sing
[17:20] one morning Are You Gonna Worship
[17:22] you might not rely on brother Kenny and
[17:24] Boaz and the different ones that are
[17:26] creating the music Hallelujah do you
[17:28] have music within you if there's no
[17:30] music
[17:32] who are you without anybody else
[17:36] Hallelujah are you a fruit that needed
[17:38] to be taken away are you a fruit that's
[17:41] are you a bridge that's bearing fruit
[17:43] Hallelujah he says if you don't bear any
[17:47] fruit he taketh it away
[17:49] put it down get it out of the way it's
[17:52] holding us up
[17:53] and the last thing we need in this hour
[17:55] is people in the church that are holding
[17:58] us up but these what do you mean
[18:00] Hallelujah you hear it over and over
[18:02] again what your life should be and you
[18:05] don't apply the word
[18:08] we go back to our little our little
[18:11] habits we go back to the little things
[18:13] that we like when God is constantly
[18:15] trying to purge us
[18:20] amen listen
[18:23] he says in every branch that bearth
[18:25] fruit he purges it that it may bring
[18:29] forth more fruit
[18:31] and that's what we want to deal with
[18:32] today hallelujah amen spiritual growth
[18:36] by suffering Hallelujah now he says even
[18:38] when you're bringing for a fruit can I
[18:40] get a man Hallelujah we are the caliber
[18:44] of people amen who believe this truth
[18:46] believe this message and we're doing
[18:48] everything Hallelujah to try to see the
[18:51] manifestation and fulfillment that God
[18:53] calls us to be in this day
[18:56] Hallelujah so then we fulfill the
[18:58] scripture by those who are bringing
[19:01] forth fruit he says even when you bring
[19:04] it for fruit he'll Purge you uh oh
[19:07] he's going to take you through something
[19:09] even though you pay your
[19:11] tithesia even though you're faithful in
[19:14] whatever Ministry God has given you even
[19:16] though you come to church like you're
[19:18] supposed to even though you
[19:23] guess what even though you got the Holy
[19:25] Ghost
[19:27] he's gonna Purge you that you breathe
[19:30] forth what more fruit
[19:33] that does not have a stagnantic church
[19:35] but he has a church that's growing
[19:37] Hallelujah growing what from glory to
[19:40] glory
[19:43] and if you're not growing Hallelujah why
[19:46] are you here
[19:50] if you're not growing
[19:52] you're subject to be cut down
[19:56] that's according to the scripture
[20:00] but notice those who are being purged
[20:02] are the ones who are already doing
[20:05] something for God
[20:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[20:11] and I'm not necessarily talking about
[20:13] physical works
[20:16] but what does suffering do
[20:19] it brings forth character
[20:22] you like how I spoke that character
[20:26] God is in the business of producing
[20:28] spiritual character
[20:31] and how do you get character through
[20:34] suffering
[20:40] suffering will show who you really are
[20:44] what kind of suffering suffering that
[20:47] you have no answer for
[20:51] that's why the prophet was anointed to
[20:53] preach messages like be certain of God
[20:56] amen because he says what do you do when
[20:59] you're praying and praying and praying
[21:01] and God doesn't answer
[21:04] can you still serve him
[21:07] can you still come to church and lift
[21:09] Your Hands In Worship
[21:10] can you still live a clean life holy can
[21:14] you still be a life of sacrifice can you
[21:17] still walk in with a smile as if you was
[21:19] on the Mountaintop
[21:22] and you know the sad part about the
[21:24] church we as Believers we know and one
[21:26] and others are going through things
[21:28] because people's attitude change when
[21:30] they go through a trial
[21:34] tell who's on your side amen when you're
[21:37] preaching and everything is good stay in
[21:39] here oh Pastor preach oh we love you so
[21:42] much
[21:44] and as soon as you start to go through a
[21:47] trial like oh my God
[21:50] I'm just not being fed
[21:55] oh my God the people in the church oh my
[21:59] God it's just too cold
[22:01] oh my God gas prices are too high
[22:05] any kind of excuse Hallelujah Hallelujah
[22:09] to give up Hallelujah any kind of excuse
[22:13] Hallelujah and this is the Clincher any
[22:15] kind of excuse to just relax and be
[22:17] normal
[22:21] we're not here to be normal
[22:26] Hallelujah and I'll be the last one to
[22:29] say that I'm normal
[22:32] Hallelujah when God created me
[22:35] Hallelujah he not only broke the mold
[22:38] but he crushed it stomped on it and did
[22:40] everything else to it and threw it
[22:42] underway
[22:43] there'll be a never another one like
[22:45] this one Hallelujah
[22:47] because only you can fulfill God's plan
[22:50] Hallelujah that he has for you
[22:54] but when we look at pruning and we look
[22:56] at the purging of the Saints Hallelujah
[22:59] sometimes there's no explanation it's
[23:02] just God rolling the dice
[23:04] hallelujah look the devil says hey Scott
[23:08] look the devil came to church that
[23:10] morning
[23:16] oh my
[23:17] God let me give you a direct quote
[23:20] he said
[23:21] God needs somebody to use
[23:25] he said the devil also needs somebody to
[23:30] use
[23:31] and the only thing I don't stop or
[23:33] hinder the supernatural in here this
[23:36] morning or the supernatural in your life
[23:39] is if you cater yourself to the devil
[23:45] he needs your mind
[23:48] he needs your body
[23:50] he needs you to fulfill his plan
[23:55] and think about it people even realize
[23:57] that you have power over the enemy Hull
[24:00] and just as like you can yield yourself
[24:02] to God and things will happen why do we
[24:05] see more of the reality of it when we
[24:07] yield ourselves to the devil
[24:11] so you can come and say oh
[24:13] this time of year throats get a little
[24:15] scratchy
[24:17] and we wake up ain't nothing happening
[24:19] it's just a little cold
[24:25] my throat feels a little raspy
[24:28] don't worry it's coming
[24:30] it's coming because you're creating an
[24:33] Avenue for it
[24:34] why can't we create avenues for God to
[24:37] move just that simple in my life
[24:39] Lord I will be out of debt Hallelujah
[24:43] Lord I will be healed today not tomorrow
[24:46] but today because your word says by your
[24:50] stripes I'm already healed I don't have
[24:52] to do anything I would have to work for
[24:54] it all I have to do is believe
[24:56] somebody needs to create an Avenue for
[24:59] God to move this morning
[25:04] Hallelujah but we create avenues for
[25:06] Satan to move in our lives all the time
[25:09] and we'll start by giving him leeway
[25:12] brother I will say well you know the
[25:14] greatest battle of fault is in the mind
[25:17] so you accept being fought in your mind
[25:19] by evil spirits
[25:23] remember
[25:24] he said the greatest battle ever fought
[25:26] is in the mind
[25:28] but there's a key word in there battle
[25:32] hallelujah it's a battle that means your
[25:36] mind doesn't just belong to the devil
[25:40] it's a battle God wants your mind just
[25:43] as much as the devil does
[25:46] so why did I give your thoughts to him
[25:50] Hallelujah
[25:51] but look
[25:54] Satan comes to church that morning
[25:56] and he says you know what
[25:58] the sons of God are going before the
[26:00] Lord and I'm going to
[26:01] will leave me out
[26:03] but God
[26:05] always sees the devil in your life
[26:10] Satan never surprises God
[26:14] there's nothing you can go through Gabby
[26:17] there's nothing you can go through
[26:18] whether where God will say oh
[26:21] Satan you got me on that one
[26:25] no
[26:26] he'll never catch God by surprise
[26:29] you say everybody I fell into sin and
[26:31] then God goes oh oh my God what am I
[26:34] going to do no
[26:36] for you to fall God had to allow it
[26:41] Hallelujah for you to go through
[26:43] anything God has to First signed off on
[26:47] it and agreement
[26:49] hallelujah it's just a test
[26:54] it's just a trial God's ruling the dice
[26:57] but sometimes it looks so wicked
[27:03] even I just got to be the devil what
[27:06] huh oh we're gonna look at it listen
[27:10] Satan comes to church
[27:12] and I hope we're Satan free this morning
[27:16] I hope the only Spirit you're carrying
[27:19] this morning is the spirit of God
[27:21] if there's any other kind of aggravation
[27:23] in your life there's Deliverance this
[27:25] morning
[27:26] Hallelujah one of the greatest things we
[27:29] need in a church is Spirit of obedience
[27:33] because we'll hear the word and we'll
[27:36] not be obedient
[27:38] let's just be obedient let's be the type
[27:43] of who we are Mary Mary says be it unto
[27:45] me according to Thy Word
[27:48] she said yes she had her own way of
[27:51] thinking she was like how are these
[27:52] things how's it going to happen and the
[27:54] angel of tore and say Mary don't worry
[27:56] about it the Holy Ghost will overshadow
[27:58] you
[28:00] why don't you let the Holy Ghost
[28:01] overshadow you this morning and God will
[28:04] take care of it
[28:06] don't try to do it on your own human
[28:08] ability because then you're subject to
[28:10] failure Hallelujah just wait on God
[28:15] but look
[28:18] Satan come to church and God says what's
[28:20] coming down Satan he's like hey
[28:23] I'm just walking to and from
[28:25] I'm going here I'm going there and then
[28:27] this is the Clinton he said to
[28:30] throughout the Earth
[28:33] he ain't just bothering literal life
[28:36] he's bothering Jesus Christ Tabernacle
[28:38] Holly all the other churches in this
[28:40] area he's the same devil he needs
[28:43] somebody he needs a School
[28:46] Hallelujah he needs somebody to work
[28:49] through Hallelujah and listen Church
[28:52] Hallelujah this is one thing you got
[28:54] that you got to realize Harley in order
[28:56] for you to do if your own you must first
[28:59] reject truth
[29:03] because God built us that way God built
[29:07] us with a connection of truth hallelujah
[29:10] and for order for us to do wrong we must
[29:12] First cast down the truth
[29:16] Hallelujah because Adam who we all come
[29:19] from was created how in the image of God
[29:22] so he always had to deal with truth
[29:25] before he did anything wrong
[29:29] and now Satan he says I'm going to and
[29:32] fro and all these things
[29:33] Hallelujah put me put me Job chapter one
[29:36] up
[29:38] put me on the street Harley
[29:40] Joe chapter one
[29:45] give me verse verse uh verse 7.
[29:50] and the Lord said that the same wisdom
[29:52] cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord
[29:54] and said from going to and fro in the
[29:57] earth and from walking up and down in it
[30:01] you know there's a scripture that says
[30:03] when your house is clean
[30:06] swept garnished when it's fit to be
[30:09] filled if you don't feel it the devil
[30:12] will come back
[30:16] Hallelujah
[30:18] that's his opportunity
[30:20] but if the house is filled that means
[30:22] there's no vacancies
[30:25] so we want our house our spiritual house
[30:28] our mind our spirit our soul to be
[30:31] filled with the things of God what do we
[30:34] want we want character
[30:37] honey next verse listen
[30:40] he said and the Lord said unto Satan has
[30:43] thou considered now God wants to give
[30:46] the devil something to think about
[30:50] oh hallelujah oh hey has not considered
[30:54] my servant job God is pointing the devil
[30:57] in the direction he wants him to go in
[31:03] your life
[31:05] maybe he says sometimes have you
[31:07] considered job
[31:09] have you considered in or or sister Joe
[31:16] have you considered Solomon
[31:19] and on and on and on you put your name
[31:21] in it notice
[31:23] the devil didn't just jump on job no God
[31:26] pointed him
[31:29] and what I want you to catch job wasn't
[31:32] ready for this
[31:35] he had no time to prepare
[31:38] he had no time to fast and pray the
[31:41] battle was just coming
[31:43] Hallelujah God was rolling the dice
[31:46] but remember the table is rigged
[31:50] Hallelujah but amen and just this just
[31:53] stirs me up Hallelujah but
[31:56] before he allows the battle to go God is
[32:00] going to testify over the life of his
[32:02] servant first
[32:06] have you considered my servant job and
[32:08] listen to God's testimony there is none
[32:11] like him in all the Earth
[32:15] think about that before you go through
[32:18] anything God has already testifying over
[32:21] your life
[32:22] God is already telling the devil that
[32:25] there's nothing like this person in all
[32:27] the Earth no matter what you take them
[32:29] through there's not like him there's
[32:32] none like her
[32:37] nah I know we all kind of different
[32:41] but if I could hear God saying
[32:45] about me and there's none like me in all
[32:49] the Earth
[32:50] you think I could just be in church like
[32:52] this
[33:02] God has said
[33:04] let's make it real clear the voice of
[33:08] Eternity
[33:11] God has put us out in the heavens
[33:14] the moon heard this the sun heard this
[33:17] all of creation heard this holy
[33:20] everything in my future heard this
[33:23] everything in my path heard this
[33:25] everything in my present
[33:28] heard the voice of God
[33:34] heard God ring out that there's none
[33:36] like him in all the Earth
[33:38] but then he didn't stop he didn't stop
[33:40] at the very end he put adjectives on my
[33:43] life
[33:44] he said that he's perfect
[33:55] I got to take a little praise break
[33:56] right quick y'all forgive me Messiah is
[34:00] the king of kings Messiah is the Lord of
[34:04] Lord Messiah is the king of King
[34:10] Messiah is
[34:21] Messiah is the king of King everybody
[34:24] now Messiah is Lord of lords
[34:28] first think about it honey
[34:30] it excites me to know
[34:33] that no matter how I look at myself
[34:36] God already sees me perfect
[34:43] and that's before I even go through the
[34:45] trial
[34:52] That Word Perfect
[34:54] in the Greek it means complete
[34:59] I'm lacking nothing
[35:02] I'm completing him you're complete
[35:04] Hallelujah
[35:06] it also means amen one who lacks nothing
[35:09] in physical strength Beauty Etc it also
[35:12] means sound Hallelujah that the devil
[35:15] can't get my mouth because I'm sound
[35:16] honey it also means wholesome amen
[35:20] oh
[35:21] God is testifying telling the devil the
[35:24] one of them to let you try Hallelujah
[35:26] he's sound he's complete he's wholesome
[35:30] [Music]
[35:33] Hallelujah
[35:35] oh
[35:36] Gloria God
[35:39] listen he says
[35:42] quite sort of a person complete morally
[35:46] innocent
[35:47] um
[35:50] so before I go through something no
[35:51] matter what it looks like to you in
[35:53] God's eyes I'm already morally innocent
[35:57] God doesn't even see my fault
[36:01] because he started with the testimonies
[36:03] that I'm complete
[36:05] Hallelujah this test this trial is just
[36:09] proving who I am
[36:12] proving who you are
[36:14] Hallelujah
[36:16] oh my
[36:18] listen it also means one who is morally
[36:21] and ethically pure
[36:26] so you may think that there's things I
[36:28] have to get rid of but God is saying no
[36:29] Hallelujah they're morally and ethically
[36:32] pure
[36:34] this trial is just going to purge
[36:36] everything else out of them earlier so
[36:38] that testimony can be a reality
[36:41] oh
[36:42] Hey look job didn't do anything wrong
[36:49] But Here Comes these end-time message
[36:51] believers
[36:53] jump
[36:54] you you must have had you've got to have
[36:57] done something to be going through this
[37:00] you must have did something no proof
[37:05] why do we let our minds wander off into
[37:08] places Hallelujah
[37:10] when we have no explanation for it
[37:15] I told y'all one of the greatest
[37:17] Ministries I've ever seen I've ever been
[37:19] a part of
[37:21] Hallelujah
[37:22] and I believe brother Branham had he had
[37:24] this locked in
[37:25] but it came from Jesus
[37:27] in the best Ministry I know of
[37:29] Hallelujah if you want to call this the
[37:31] eighth Angel the eighth Messengers or
[37:33] whatever you want to call it amen this
[37:35] is this is the greatest Ministry upon
[37:37] the Earth right now Hallelujah and all
[37:39] of you can be a part of it amen you
[37:41] don't even have to look it up on the
[37:43] internet I'm gonna give it to you for
[37:44] free today
[37:46] you'd rather look wait for some great
[37:48] preacher to come or somebody of renown
[37:50] that went up the mountain with brother
[37:52] Branham and all these different things
[37:53] no I'm gonna give it to you free the
[37:55] greatest Ministry that I've ever been a
[37:57] part of is called The Chateau Mount
[37:59] Ministry
[38:11] Sometimes the best thing to do
[38:14] is just to keep this thing close
[38:18] just let it take its course
[38:21] don't add nothing to it
[38:24] don't try to figure it out
[38:26] just sit back and pray
[38:29] just sit back and say you know the
[38:31] problem is a lot of times we speak on
[38:33] other people because we really don't
[38:34] believe that they believe us
[38:40] I told you
[38:48] and the worst kind of person to be
[38:51] oh
[38:57] the worst kind of person to be
[38:59] besides a gossiper is the person that
[39:03] the gossiper always calls
[39:11] because you have become a spiritual
[39:13] trash can
[39:16] but the gospel Hollywood can always
[39:18] count on you to vent
[39:21] can always count on you to upload their
[39:24] trash
[39:25] and you sit right there and listen to it
[39:27] all and just take it all in and just be
[39:30] like oh my God
[39:33] oh my Lord
[39:35] we really need to pray
[39:38] know what you ought to do as soon as
[39:40] they cause I ain't got time for that
[39:41] today
[39:43] I ain't got time today
[39:45] or just the best way to shut it down is
[39:47] be like maybe it's something God is
[39:50] doing in their life
[39:54] and who's going to argue with that I
[39:56] don't believe God I don't believe God
[40:00] made one Prophet walked around naked and
[40:04] that was a sign to the people
[40:06] he made another Prophet lay on his side
[40:08] as a sign for the people earlier
[40:11] God allowed one one woman to go into
[40:13] prostitution just so she could get to
[40:16] the place where she could meet the right
[40:18] man marry this man and the seed in the
[40:20] lineage of Jesus Christ and come through
[40:22] it who's gonna tell God what's ethically
[40:25] right
[40:26] Holly who's gonna tell God what looks
[40:29] right and what looks wrong
[40:32] all these virtuous women over here God
[40:35] say no I'm gonna use that prostitute
[40:40] Hallelujah
[40:43] but she had to go through something to
[40:44] get there
[40:46] but you know what she was she was
[40:48] complete
[40:49] she was sound she was wholesome she was
[40:52] even though she was a prostitute in
[40:54] God's eyes she was morally and ethically
[40:57] pure
[40:59] oh wow oh
[41:03] I know some of you may be analyzing what
[41:05] I'm saying like but that doesn't make
[41:07] any sense
[41:08] God doesn't make sense
[41:09] [Music]
[41:13] he's not in the business of making sense
[41:15] he's in the business of making sons and
[41:17] daughters
[41:19] Hallelujah
[41:21] and it may look like I shouldn't be a
[41:23] son hungry it don't look like it's
[41:25] sensible but it is
[41:28] you may not look like it's sensible to
[41:30] be a daughter of God but you are
[41:33] Hallelujah
[41:36] not only did he say
[41:38] everybody all right
[41:40] he says that you're give me pull the
[41:42] verse back up there he says he says he's
[41:45] perfect Hallelujah
[41:47] in an upright man
[41:52] meaning that this trial ain't gonna make
[41:54] him fall
[41:56] upright the word upright
[41:58] it means correct
[42:00] [Music]
[42:02] it means proper
[42:04] uprighteous righteous Hallelujah that
[42:07] which is upright and he's saying to
[42:09] Satan no matter what he'll do or go
[42:12] through in this trial I'm looking at him
[42:14] to be righteous
[42:18] but it's this trial that's going to
[42:21] bring out the best of job Hallelujah
[42:23] but God does he says if you're not
[42:26] bringing for a fruit he'll Purge you
[42:28] that you bring forth more fruit
[42:30] now if we could just see the type of
[42:33] purging
[42:34] purging is like pruning a tree
[42:37] if you know what pruning is hallelujah
[42:39] look that tree has already been growing
[42:42] for years
[42:43] so it has a testimony amen he has a
[42:47] testimony to be able to produce but now
[42:49] God wants more out of it
[42:51] honey and you know how long if you ask
[42:55] the question how long does an apple tree
[42:57] produce apples
[43:01] it's your year of the year
[43:04] it really shouldn't never stop
[43:08] and the only reason why I stopped
[43:10] because something internally is going on
[43:15] look that apple tree will produce as
[43:18] long as Hallelujah the branches have
[43:20] light and water
[43:22] it'll produce as long as the is
[43:25] experiencing the right temperature the
[43:28] proper Seasons that apple tree is
[43:30] supposed to produce apples
[43:32] but let's say it's 50 years later and
[43:34] there's no more apples that means that
[43:36] there's something wrong on the inside
[43:39] Hallelujah because it's still an apple
[43:42] tree
[43:43] let's look at it like this 50 years
[43:45] later Hallelujah you just got an apple
[43:48] off that tree earlier if you plant those
[43:51] seeds in that Apple you'll still get
[43:53] what in apple tree
[43:55] so there's nothing wrong with the host
[43:57] tree Hallelujah there's something on the
[44:00] inside going on
[44:05] so why does God Purge us
[44:07] he purged us to bring forth more fruit
[44:10] now listen
[44:12] what he says right here about job
[44:14] he says the Lord wasn't Hallelujah
[44:18] rebuking job
[44:20] he said God was purging job
[44:24] he said I'm gonna read it for you he
[44:25] says now if you ever notice how that
[44:29] when a disaster struck job's home listen
[44:31] it looked like a disaster
[44:35] and a lot of times when we go through
[44:37] things it looks like a disaster
[44:39] it looks like a tragedy Hood but how do
[44:42] you know God God uses tragedy to bring
[44:45] forth Glory
[44:47] he used something called the death of
[44:49] the Cross Hallelujah
[44:51] forever
[44:53] he used some
[44:55] it looked like a tragedy how God got
[44:57] whipped he got talked about he basically
[44:59] got murdered
[45:01] but he used that tragedy to set us free
[45:10] listen
[45:12] he said Jose hold his children were all
[45:14] killed and everything and all job had
[45:17] was destroyed God was a rebuking job he
[45:21] was only purging job amen I like that
[45:25] word Purge
[45:27] So In This Moment
[45:29] God used this trial for job's benefit
[45:35] and The Purge is a type to prune
[45:38] Hallelujah and you look at a church we
[45:40] think about the word pruning what's the
[45:42] purpose of pruning
[45:44] you take a normal tree Hallelujah that's
[45:46] been producing fruit year after year and
[45:49] then all of a sudden it's not producing
[45:51] anymore
[45:53] and I'm sure brother Paul has
[45:55] experienced Us in different pastors
[45:57] where you have people in the church and
[45:59] then all of a sudden they start to feel
[46:01] something wrong
[46:03] they're not eating from his hand anymore
[46:07] as a Shepherd that's when you know your
[46:09] sheep is sick
[46:11] because they've been eating out of your
[46:13] hand all this time and now all of a
[46:15] sudden they're not hungry
[46:18] same food we don't have any different
[46:21] amen I I have a I have a pet
[46:24] holy am I my my bully which is a mix of
[46:27] American Bulldog and a pit bull
[46:29] that's a bully
[46:31] I like the name
[46:34] but if I changed her food
[46:37] just off the smell of it she won't eat
[46:40] it
[46:41] and the only way she'll eat it is if I
[46:44] don't put anything before
[46:49] then it makes her adapt her taste
[46:53] to eat was presented before her
[46:55] Hallelujah
[46:56] and sometimes it feels like the ministry
[46:58] is giving you different food now
[47:00] Hallelujah he's just giving you
[47:02] something Hallelujah that you haven't
[47:04] tasted yet
[47:06] and sometimes that may come as a little
[47:08] family rebuke Hallelujah he may come
[47:11] that Holy a moral rebuke what he's
[47:14] trying to get you to do earlier to eat
[47:16] from this place and from that plate but
[47:18] all of it will make you better
[47:22] indeed she'll get to the place
[47:24] Hallelujah she'll drink the water
[47:26] because you can't change water
[47:31] but when it comes to the food that's
[47:34] the Holly
[47:35] and one thing I've come to realize as a
[47:39] Believer or somebody who sits under sits
[47:42] under a Ministry holy you have to ask
[47:44] yourself the question when the word
[47:46] comes forth and maybe it's rebuking or
[47:48] it comes through a passage rebuking ask
[47:50] yourself is this man really trying to
[47:52] hurt me
[47:55] information
[47:58] let's take the example from job
[48:03] say hey
[48:04] the Lord God giveth
[48:06] and the Lord God take it away
[48:09] blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:12] see in the midst of his pruning the
[48:14] midst of his
[48:17] he still give God glory even though he
[48:20] had no explanation
[48:24] pruning
[48:25] pruning can remove any portion that have
[48:30] a disease
[48:32] that's why the tree is pruned
[48:34] that's why Hallelujah we can't have
[48:37] every service that produces a
[48:39] Mountaintop
[48:40] sometimes the word has to get right down
[48:43] in there to where your defeat is
[48:46] get right down in there grind on that
[48:49] thing Dig It All Out Hallelujah and
[48:51] don't take it from you easy snatch it
[48:54] from you
[48:57] so you can feel that Deliverance
[48:59] Hallelujah sometimes the ministry has to
[49:02] come right down into the areas that you
[49:04] have Secret in your protecting
[49:08] things that you don't want to get rid of
[49:10] but that tree has to be proved
[49:15] notice
[49:16] the pruning doesn't happen Hallelujah to
[49:19] an illegitimate tree
[49:21] it happens to a tree that's already been
[49:23] producing
[49:27] I want you to look at this right Church
[49:28] Hallelujah rebukes come from those who
[49:32] have already been producing
[49:37] that's God's way
[49:39] and we think oh my God why am I going to
[49:42] listen why is this happening God's just
[49:45] trying to get you to grow
[49:47] he's just trying to get more fruit out
[49:49] of you because he knows that there's
[49:50] more in there
[49:52] so what that pruning does that pruning
[49:55] begins to get to that sickness
[49:57] Hallelujah get to that thing that's
[49:59] stopping the tree hurling and you could
[50:01] be Hallelujah feeling like you're in the
[50:03] will of God then all of a sudden a trial
[50:07] because there's something in you that
[50:09] God knows only this child can bring out
[50:14] listen he did it all through the course
[50:16] of the Bible amen are you with me church
[50:18] and he even did it in our prophets
[50:21] Ministry this man this oh oh this man
[50:26] seeing visions Hallelujah daily holy
[50:29] praying for people healing lies amen his
[50:32] life was just it was just so remarkable
[50:34] he's doing all these things Hallelujah
[50:36] but you know he had to go through a
[50:38] trial why because he had a lying spirit
[50:41] inside of him
[50:47] not my prophet he said it not me
[50:50] it's on tape
[50:52] he's on streaming
[50:57] listen
[50:58] all of a sudden
[51:00] the IRS comes up with this big old tax
[51:02] bill
[51:05] this man is going around the world doing
[51:06] the work of God he wasn't committing sin
[51:10] Harley he's doing look he's doing the
[51:12] right thing with the money
[51:14] he even had a record to show that he put
[51:16] all the money back into the ministry
[51:18] none of it for his own self and now he's
[51:21] under all his pressure from the IRS you
[51:24] know why I love this story because God
[51:27] tells me I can also deliver your IRS
[51:29] problems
[51:33] Hallelujah
[51:34] come on somebody
[51:36] I know some of us getting those those
[51:38] letters in the mail
[51:43] oh are y'all too spiritual
[51:44] hahaha
[51:47] but listen Church in this moment of his
[51:48] life where he's going around the world
[51:50] he's praying for people he's doing
[51:51] everything he wasn't committing sin all
[51:54] of a sudden he goes to a trial with the
[51:56] IRS and this thing is so intense what
[51:59] made it intense he had no explanation
[52:04] but now God is trying to
[52:07] get the prophet to grow
[52:10] but the hidden thing about God God knew
[52:13] that this trial was going to bring out
[52:15] something that was lying way down in
[52:17] there
[52:19] even with the Holy Ghost
[52:23] he was going to bring out something that
[52:25] you wouldn't think a prophet was able to
[52:27] do
[52:28] a man filled with the Holy Spirit a man
[52:31] being used by God a man traveling around
[52:34] the world a man looked upon the bee
[52:36] righteous
[52:39] Hallelujah and now because of trial with
[52:42] no explanation what is God doing he's
[52:44] shaking the tree
[52:46] he's pruning the tree Hallelujah if some
[52:48] of your trees are being this morning why
[52:50] is he shaking the tree because he can
[52:52] see the fruit
[52:57] Hallelujah and now he's shaking the tree
[52:59] honey in the prophet holy you know he
[53:01] had all these different lines that
[53:03] people could call the tax collector
[53:05] could call on every line
[53:08] there was no Escape
[53:12] every time you turn around
[53:15] [Music]
[53:21] in this one particular day
[53:23] he felt like he was under so much
[53:25] pressure
[53:26] immedi picks up the phone
[53:29] and she says
[53:31] bill
[53:34] is that IRS tax man again
[53:42] y'all know what else it don't even get
[53:44] that far because we got a call ID
[53:52] and I even I even heard something from
[53:54] my kids that you can block people
[53:56] foreign
[53:59] be careful don't get blocked
[54:04] I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a
[54:05] key if your child goes out
[54:08] and you didn't bless them with a phone
[54:09] you gave them a phone
[54:11] they go out and you trying to call him
[54:14] and it goes straight to voicemail that's
[54:16] something funny
[54:20] because normally it doesn't go straight
[54:21] to voicemail
[54:23] if it goes straight to voicemail either
[54:25] you're on do not disturb
[54:28] or you're blocked
[54:30] and some of them are so smart they put
[54:32] you on airplane mode
[54:35] that way your call can't come through
[54:38] and you get straight voicemail
[54:41] and I hope there's no Annabelle in here
[54:43] hi this is Annabelle and I can't get
[54:46] your call at this moment but if you
[54:48] leave a message I'll call you back
[54:51] that drives me crazy
[54:54] if I'm paying the bill and you can't
[54:56] answer my phone calls something wrong
[55:02] we're gonna have to check that that
[55:04] Network when you get back
[55:08] but anyway let me leave that off
[55:11] y'all know I'm good at telling young
[55:12] people secrets
[55:14] I'm such a tattletale
[55:19] but Church
[55:21] now that Prophet gets the phone call
[55:23] Hallelujah and immedi says it's that tax
[55:26] collector and he hears it he knows it he
[55:30] says tell him I'm not in here
[55:34] what was that that was a lie
[55:39] and God knew that that was that lying
[55:43] Spirit was still inside of him even
[55:45] though he was in the will of God
[55:48] even though he was a prophet even though
[55:51] he had the Holy Ghost even though he had
[55:53] healing lies and people getting healed
[55:54] there still was an element Hallelujah
[55:57] that God couldn't use inside of them and
[55:59] that tree had to be pruned Hallelujah
[56:01] and what brought it out it was the child
[56:06] Hallelujah
[56:09] but what I want you to catch about this
[56:11] one Hallelujah the prophet goes out and
[56:13] he goes into doing what he'd normally do
[56:15] but now God is looking at it different
[56:18] he goes to pray for somebody and God
[56:20] said get your hands off them you just
[56:22] told a lie
[56:26] he goes back
[56:30] even before he got there he says my wife
[56:32] is more moral than I am and not in those
[56:35] exact words but he was saying his wife
[56:38] said to him not bill was that just quite
[56:40] right
[56:42] uh she recognized it was a lot
[56:45] so you knew he had to recognize it was a
[56:47] lie
[56:48] but then he steps out Hallelujah goes
[56:51] Outdoors or whatever and feel like and
[56:53] you're after the phone was hung up back
[56:54] then the phones are very big so when you
[56:56] hang them up they go ding
[56:59] so he probably could hear that hung up
[57:00] the phone came back in and she was like
[57:02] Bill you know that wasn't right he was
[57:04] he said I told you I was outside he said
[57:06] yeah but you was in here when the call
[57:07] came
[57:09] often we do that
[57:13] we try to play religious games with God
[57:16] well I I
[57:18] I I didn't lie I just didn't speak the
[57:21] truth
[57:24] I ain't the smartest person in the world
[57:25] but if you didn't speak the truth that
[57:27] sounded like a lot of me
[57:31] now God deals with the prophet
[57:33] Hallelujah and from that point
[57:35] Hallelujah he has to go back
[57:38] see just how you know your footsteps are
[57:40] ordered by God that there's something
[57:42] inside that there's Seed Life inside
[57:45] because he didn't just wallow in that
[57:47] line and say oh well God forgive me no
[57:50] he said okay I'm gonna go back and make
[57:52] it right God he went back to the man and
[57:54] say sir when you called I told a liar
[57:56] was in the house and the man says to him
[57:58] he says I've always had respect for you
[58:00] he said but now I have even more respect
[58:03] what did that man see that man saw
[58:05] character
[58:06] [Music]
[58:09] suffering brings forth character
[58:12] even though Hallelujah the just of the
[58:15] whole thing God wanted to get the lion
[58:16] Spirit out
[58:18] in church from that point Hallelujah
[58:21] we've never ever heard another quote
[58:23] another taint Hallelujah about him
[58:25] telling a lie
[58:31] same thing with Abraham
[58:33] not just about that's just my sister
[58:36] you know it was your wife
[58:39] but God wanted to deal with that lying
[58:41] spirit
[58:42] so he let him come under some pressure
[58:44] that he couldn't explain but he spoke
[58:46] that into his life be careful what you
[58:48] speak he spoke that child into his life
[58:51] and then the trial comes and now he's
[58:53] looking like oh what am I going to do
[58:54] God knew about it before the foundation
[58:56] of the world
[58:58] in our church Holy Bible that comes and
[59:01] takes his wife and all these things and
[59:03] then God steps in Hallelujah
[59:05] God steps in to show that I'm on your
[59:07] side even though in your failures
[59:10] he's pruning the tree
[59:13] Hallelujah there's some things that'll
[59:15] happen in your life only for a testimony
[59:25] you say why
[59:28] did I just so you can
[59:31] have some friends of mine in Edmonton
[59:35] Christian Tesa
[59:39] so he said her friends and some of the
[59:41] saints were at one of the other Saints
[59:43] house I think it's all sisters they were
[59:45] around the pool with the kids just
[59:47] having a good Fellowship
[59:49] eating and enjoying themselves
[59:51] and they got a little son I think
[59:53] comrade is three somewhere like that
[59:55] three or two
[59:56] you know he talking walking the average
[59:58] two-year-old
[1:00:00] you know a three-year-old how old he is
[1:00:03] and he uh they was around the pool you
[1:00:05] know everybody having a good time
[1:00:07] there was one person that's supposed to
[1:00:09] be watching the kids you know they was
[1:00:10] doing pretty good watching the kids and
[1:00:12] all these different things
[1:00:13] and you know mothers were very
[1:00:15] protective so he had the little balloons
[1:00:17] on his arm the balloons on his on his
[1:00:19] legs or whatever I think he just had him
[1:00:21] on his arms this time
[1:00:22] you know what
[1:00:24] the little things that make him float
[1:00:27] somehow
[1:00:28] comrade takes his off
[1:00:32] what's that a boy being a boy
[1:00:36] and he takes them off
[1:00:39] and he jumps in the pool
[1:00:42] but nobody sees him jump in the pool
[1:00:45] nobody hears them jump in the pool
[1:00:47] all the saints all the sisters are
[1:00:49] standing there talking having a good
[1:00:51] time fellowshipping and comrades in the
[1:00:53] pool drowning
[1:00:55] nobody knows it then one sister she gets
[1:00:58] up just sporadically had to do something
[1:01:00] and actually got up
[1:01:02] when she turned her head she saw
[1:01:04] something red in the pool
[1:01:06] so it caught her attention and it was
[1:01:08] the color of comrade shorts
[1:01:11] so she went to investigate and saw him
[1:01:13] land there at the bottom of the pool
[1:01:15] basically dead
[1:01:18] and she grabs him they picks him up and
[1:01:21] you can imagine the scene Church
[1:01:23] you can imagine a scene that like oh my
[1:01:25] God his mother's standing there crying
[1:01:27] and just just Delirious you know and and
[1:01:30] and somebody begins to do CPR you know
[1:01:35] resuscitation I said begins to bring him
[1:01:39] back or whatever and they got a little
[1:01:41] bit of his heart back breathing and then
[1:01:43] the the rescue people come and they get
[1:01:45] him and take him to the hospital
[1:01:47] now you know when you die
[1:01:51] for so long it affects your brain
[1:01:55] and too much of the water intake will
[1:01:57] affect your lungs
[1:01:59] and as a two or three-year-old I want
[1:02:02] you to keep this in mind his brain knows
[1:02:05] his lungs were fully developed
[1:02:09] so there's more of a chance that
[1:02:11] something would happen to him in that
[1:02:12] stage than a grown-up
[1:02:15] in church he gets they take them to the
[1:02:17] hospital the hospital revives him
[1:02:19] Hallelujah
[1:02:21] they revise them his breath comes back
[1:02:24] amen everything about comrade comes back
[1:02:27] when he's in the hospital and now he's
[1:02:29] in the hospital he's like where am I
[1:02:31] what's up
[1:02:32] with my mama with my daddy
[1:02:36] Hallelujah
[1:02:37] with my mama with my daddy so they're
[1:02:39] running all these tests going through
[1:02:41] all the stuff that's like who are you
[1:02:42] what are your name all these things he
[1:02:44] answers every question
[1:02:45] Hallelujah
[1:02:47] Oh my he answers every question with no
[1:02:50] reservation to the point where he says
[1:02:52] take me to my mama take me to my daddy
[1:02:55] Hallelujah he's basically telling the
[1:02:57] doctors there's nothing wrong with me
[1:02:59] I'm just a testimony
[1:03:05] Hallelujah
[1:03:07] okay and now he comes they showed me the
[1:03:10] video of him coming out of the emergency
[1:03:12] room and he's just running and just
[1:03:14] having such a good time
[1:03:17] like nothing never happened
[1:03:21] and they begin to ask him they ask him
[1:03:23] questions say do you remember what
[1:03:24] happened he said yeah I was under the
[1:03:25] water
[1:03:27] he said well what were you thinking he
[1:03:28] said I would think he's talking to his
[1:03:29] mom he said to her he said he says he
[1:03:32] said what were you thinking he said I
[1:03:33] was thinking why watch you saving me
[1:03:37] and you know that just broke her heart
[1:03:39] as a mother
[1:03:41] Hallelujah
[1:03:44] so in me trying to encourage you I began
[1:03:47] to tell her things like this
[1:03:50] sometimes things happen out of your
[1:03:51] control
[1:03:52] just so you can have a testimony of
[1:03:55] God's grace
[1:03:57] so you have a testimony of God's power
[1:04:01] church and what they were really
[1:04:02] concerned about how there's some of you
[1:04:05] in here right now that are being
[1:04:08] affected by things you went through in
[1:04:10] your childhood
[1:04:11] oh
[1:04:12] Horrors and and giving things you
[1:04:15] experience that you're still carrying to
[1:04:17] this day
[1:04:18] things that happen to you you can be
[1:04:20] delivered
[1:04:22] and that was the greatest fear with
[1:04:24] comrade they were thinking that now he's
[1:04:27] going to be afraid to be around water or
[1:04:30] do anything about swimming as soon as he
[1:04:32] got home he asked Chris hey Dad can we
[1:04:34] go swimming
[1:04:39] Hallelujah
[1:04:41] what was the church it was the glory of
[1:04:44] God over his life
[1:04:47] there's no fear when it comes to the
[1:04:49] swimming pool there's no fear when it
[1:04:51] comes to anything that has to deal with
[1:04:52] water what was all that for just to give
[1:04:55] his mother a testimony
[1:05:00] and sometimes you'll go through things
[1:05:02] simply because God wants you to trust
[1:05:04] him more
[1:05:06] look church this happened God's grace
[1:05:08] this happened when all the saints their
[1:05:11] backs were turned even when your back is
[1:05:13] turning you don't know how the devil is
[1:05:15] going to come God is still your
[1:05:17] protector
[1:05:22] Hallelujah
[1:05:24] so when you think about pruning the tree
[1:05:28] there's something called a three-step
[1:05:30] method
[1:05:32] concerning the pruning a tree
[1:05:35] a lot of times
[1:05:36] now we're going to talk about church for
[1:05:38] a minute
[1:05:40] we'll get right down it's just like
[1:05:42] the way someone you look at the ministry
[1:05:47] sometimes when it comes to dealing with
[1:05:49] things in the church
[1:05:50] you may say well why is he approaching
[1:05:53] it that way
[1:05:54] why is it what we all can see the
[1:05:57] problem
[1:05:58] why don't he just rebuke them
[1:06:02] I'll tell you why
[1:06:04] because it's the ministry of a pastor
[1:06:07] and he's not telling me to speak on any
[1:06:09] of this I just feel led this morning
[1:06:11] Hallelujah but you know what Harley
[1:06:13] because we're dealing with proof and
[1:06:15] we're dealing with spiritual growth
[1:06:16] earlier and one thing you have to
[1:06:17] realize about a pastor Holly his whole
[1:06:20] job is to see you make it to heaven
[1:06:24] Hallelujah I'm glad I don't have that
[1:06:26] job
[1:06:29] I don't have that burden Hallelujah amen
[1:06:32] although I want to see you make it to
[1:06:34] Heaven my job is a little bit more fun
[1:06:37] than his
[1:06:39] because my job Hallelujah is to attack
[1:06:42] the demons that's Hanging On To You
[1:06:44] Hallelujah so I get to come in your life
[1:06:46] like Rambo Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam
[1:06:51] shooting at everything that's hating on
[1:06:53] you Hallelujah
[1:06:55] and you know sometimes I might meet the
[1:06:57] Target and hit you oh
[1:07:05] and all I say is your legs shouldn't
[1:07:06] have been in the way
[1:07:09] you shouldn't be that close to the devil
[1:07:12] ain't my problem my job is to deal with
[1:07:14] the devil that close is your fault
[1:07:18] Hallelujah
[1:07:21] I've been in church Hallelujah my sword
[1:07:23] is so sharp and I'm cutting
[1:07:26] and people don't even realize I'm
[1:07:27] cutting them till they raise their hand
[1:07:28] and their hand fall off
[1:07:33] you got me brother Diggs
[1:07:37] but Church you look
[1:07:39] that Ministry Hallelujah is to get you
[1:07:42] to a place
[1:07:43] amen well you can grow and keep going
[1:07:45] and growing keep going sometimes things
[1:07:48] will happen Hallelujah that you don't
[1:07:50] quite understand
[1:07:52] and you take that gift you take that you
[1:07:54] take that Ministry hallelujah it's it's
[1:07:56] it's direct and sometimes it's indirect
[1:08:01] and the reason why it's indirect
[1:08:03] sometimes because it's dealing with more
[1:08:05] than just one person
[1:08:10] and sometimes one person can do
[1:08:12] something in church and everybody got to
[1:08:14] get it
[1:08:17] because that's just the ministry
[1:08:20] and you you you you you may look at it
[1:08:22] like why is he picking on me no he's
[1:08:24] just pruning a tree
[1:08:27] because he sees the fruit he wants the
[1:08:28] fruit in your life Hallelujah and he
[1:08:30] wants God to just continue to cultivate
[1:08:33] the tree
[1:08:34] but what you may see Hallelujah is not
[1:08:37] cultivating you may feel like why me
[1:08:41] ask yourself the question why not you
[1:08:45] don't you want to be in the image of God
[1:08:47] Hallelujah in church even me as an
[1:08:50] evangelist I had to understand I'm not a
[1:08:53] pastor
[1:08:55] cause I've been sitting in church
[1:08:57] among my sisters and brothers my local
[1:08:59] church and things are going on and I'm
[1:09:01] like man if I was the pastor
[1:09:06] oh God have mercy on them
[1:09:12] I'll tell you a testimony
[1:09:15] church when I was a song leader
[1:09:18] I used to be a brother come in and he
[1:09:20] just messed up the whole service
[1:09:22] by singing his specials
[1:09:27] and we're good people now we're good
[1:09:28] people now but back then Sherry
[1:09:30] oh
[1:09:32] he come in he I have a special
[1:09:36] and I'm like okay
[1:09:42] and get in and different ones brother
[1:09:45] Kenny y'all know what I'm speaking on
[1:09:48] just because you have a special that
[1:09:50] don't mean it's special
[1:09:56] sometimes it's just you wanting to stand
[1:09:58] among the people so you can hear this
[1:10:03] because you wanted a little praise
[1:10:05] that's not the way to go about it
[1:10:08] you know the pastor because he's that
[1:10:11] kind of man he'll let you have your
[1:10:12] special by no way he's going to come
[1:10:14] into his sister you can't sing
[1:10:17] brother you can't see
[1:10:20] we want to be edified this morning
[1:10:25] and I know y'all think he has a horrible
[1:10:27] things that's a little too hard the
[1:10:28] Bible says Make a Joyful Noise
[1:10:30] yeah what makes it joyful the way we
[1:10:33] receive it
[1:10:39] I'm not telling you the seniors not the
[1:10:41] senior special but I'm telling I'm
[1:10:42] questioning your motives
[1:10:46] Hallelujah and his brother was put in
[1:10:48] his requested
[1:10:51] mess up everything
[1:10:53] and then we got to come back and get the
[1:10:55] service back together we got the same
[1:10:57] songs and different stuff and just get
[1:10:58] her back going you know because my job
[1:11:00] is to make it right for the preacher
[1:11:02] where he would come out and feel free
[1:11:04] where he could just preach not to where
[1:11:06] he has to frown and beat on the people
[1:11:08] to get the atmosphere right
[1:11:11] right so you think about that it's your
[1:11:13] special hindering of service or is it
[1:11:15] making better
[1:11:18] you know
[1:11:20] somebody just hit me with a stone
[1:11:26] Paul they picking up bricks in here Paul
[1:11:29] oh my God
[1:11:32] but remember I'm an evangelist
[1:11:36] I'm not connected to your feelings he is
[1:11:40] Hallelujah
[1:11:42] and you know church he get em we have to
[1:11:45] get it back right
[1:11:46] so I got to a point as the song leader
[1:11:49] I'm like he
[1:11:50] ain't no more
[1:11:52] and you think brother Diggs you wrong
[1:11:54] and I was
[1:11:56] but in that moment I didn't care
[1:12:00] because I'm looking at my duty my job to
[1:12:03] get the atmosphere right
[1:12:05] honey so we battled like two Rams
[1:12:09] he'd come and say I got a special and I
[1:12:10] say I don't care
[1:12:14] he put his best give his special to the
[1:12:16] deacons I read it Fold It Up LED on the
[1:12:19] side
[1:12:21] because in my mind I'm thinking no
[1:12:23] you're not gonna mess up the service
[1:12:25] today
[1:12:27] we went on like that for months
[1:12:30] months just battling to the place to
[1:12:32] where he knew I wasn't going to receive
[1:12:34] his request so he got smart everybody
[1:12:36] believe it or not everybody in the
[1:12:38] church is watching us
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:42] you think your battle is just between
[1:12:43] you and that person no it's affecting
[1:12:45] the whole church
[1:12:49] to the point the way I'm leading songs
[1:12:52] and he says okay if the deacons ain't
[1:12:54] gonna give it to him because you know I
[1:12:55] had a dick is in my pocket
[1:13:00] the deacons was on my side
[1:13:03] oh we fight real dirty we don't fight
[1:13:05] fair
[1:13:09] so I already got them one hey when he
[1:13:11] give you a question don't you bring that
[1:13:13] up here to me
[1:13:15] y'all see what I see
[1:13:16] in our church everybody all right
[1:13:19] now Church hallelujah what he decides to
[1:13:22] do he says okay if that's how you're
[1:13:23] gonna do it I'm gonna put you on blast
[1:13:25] in front of the whole church
[1:13:27] so what he does is write his requests
[1:13:28] out while the song service is going on
[1:13:30] Gideon he gets up
[1:13:37] lays it on the pulpit
[1:13:39] while I'm conducting everybody knows
[1:13:41] it's a song request
[1:13:43] and they're looking at me like what you
[1:13:44] gonna do now
[1:13:47] the same thing I always get I don't care
[1:13:50] if y'all looking at me
[1:13:54] right there on the side
[1:14:02] I'm coming somewhere
[1:14:07] and I'm going through this major trial
[1:14:09] this major battle with my brother
[1:14:11] and then one day
[1:14:13] the man of God comes one of the brothers
[1:14:15] in the church comes and he preached on a
[1:14:17] message
[1:14:18] and the title of his message was
[1:14:21] you just never believe it
[1:14:22] the title of his message was complexes
[1:14:27] and from that Ministry from that word I
[1:14:30] realized I had a complex
[1:14:32] and I was trying to take care of
[1:14:34] something that I wasn't supposed to be
[1:14:36] trying to take care of
[1:14:37] and God just comes to me and says hey
[1:14:39] look at the pastor look what he's doing
[1:14:42] if he's not rebuking it why are you
[1:14:44] rebuking it
[1:14:49] sometimes hold your peace just sit back
[1:14:51] and just let the pastor
[1:14:55] in the long run whether it works out
[1:14:58] good or whether it works out bad he's
[1:15:00] the only one gonna get the licks
[1:15:06] you just stay quiet well I shouldn't say
[1:15:08] him I say her also because you fail to
[1:15:11] realize hallelujah amen now now I'm in
[1:15:13] here now so I'm just going to deal with
[1:15:15] it Hallelujah I feel Hallelujah that you
[1:15:17] need to recognize a lot of times these
[1:15:19] get to her before I get to him
[1:15:22] and she'll begin to carry those burdens
[1:15:25] Hallelujah so she can protect him don't
[1:15:28] do her like that
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:36] we're supposed to be helpers of one
[1:15:38] another
[1:15:39] if you got a problem take it to the Lord
[1:15:42] in prayer
[1:15:44] don't use one another for an outlet to
[1:15:47] express yourself
[1:15:49] but now Church the word comes and God
[1:15:52] shows me I got a complex and I'm like oh
[1:15:54] my God so you know what I did from that
[1:15:55] point I said Lord if the pastor ain't
[1:15:57] dealing with it I ain't gonna do nothing
[1:15:58] so I just started singing I started kept
[1:16:01] going he get in there mess up everything
[1:16:03] again I said okay let's go
[1:16:06] but I stopped trying to handle it myself
[1:16:08] and then one day he got up there like he
[1:16:09] was the Beatles
[1:16:14] my pastor came
[1:16:16] he said look
[1:16:18] I don't want you playing like that in
[1:16:20] here anymore
[1:16:21] he says better yet I don't even want you
[1:16:23] playing with other people are playing
[1:16:24] only time I want you playing is when you
[1:16:26] sing it
[1:16:27] and from that day to this day we never
[1:16:30] had to deal with it again
[1:16:34] why because God dealt with it through
[1:16:36] the correct Channel
[1:16:38] and a lot of times when you're being
[1:16:40] pruned there's a channel that God works
[1:16:42] through Hallelujah it might not look
[1:16:44] right Hallelujah it might not feel right
[1:16:46] but God is getting the sickness out of
[1:16:48] the tree
[1:16:51] I got to close
[1:16:56] but what pruning does
[1:16:58] it takes care of fungi and other types
[1:17:00] of decaying and that's stopping it from
[1:17:02] spreading to healthier branches that's
[1:17:05] what pruning does
[1:17:07] so a lot of times the pastor comes and
[1:17:09] he deals with certain things what is he
[1:17:11] doing he's stopping the spreading of
[1:17:13] diseases
[1:17:17] so the tree can continue to bring forth
[1:17:20] fruit Hallelujah he said branches can
[1:17:22] also it says removing these branches can
[1:17:26] also expose the other branches tomorrow
[1:17:28] sunlight
[1:17:31] so in the pruning process sometimes when
[1:17:33] God deals with things that are very
[1:17:35] direct what is he doing he's making sure
[1:17:38] everybody is getting the light they
[1:17:40] deserve
[1:17:44] you might say why is he going on that
[1:17:45] channel because somebody is still under
[1:17:47] the shade
[1:17:49] somebody needs a direct hit
[1:17:53] so God will use the ministry to come in
[1:17:55] to prune the tree he's not killing he's
[1:17:57] making it more healthy
[1:18:05] it's so many different Avenues
[1:18:08] of pruning we could go down but for the
[1:18:10] sake of time I'm gonna cut it off amen
[1:18:13] he said which also helps to reduce the
[1:18:17] increases of diseases
[1:18:20] it encourages fruit publishing
[1:18:24] so you ask yourself where you are right
[1:18:26] now
[1:18:28] if your tree is not being pruned
[1:18:31] and you've been saved 20 30 plus years
[1:18:34] and there's no pruning going on God
[1:18:37] really want to cut you off
[1:18:40] foreign
[1:18:42] because you're not helping the tree
[1:18:48] and we have people come in and ride off
[1:18:50] the anointing
[1:18:51] right off the anointing of a good church
[1:18:53] right of the anointing of a good worship
[1:18:56] service right off the anointing of good
[1:18:58] preaching and never put anything back
[1:19:01] into it
[1:19:03] Hallelujah
[1:19:05] think about it think about this
[1:19:07] before I close
[1:19:09] if brother Paul
[1:19:10] would take a month off
[1:19:13] take a month off don't contact nobody
[1:19:15] don't call nobody anything could this
[1:19:17] church run sufficiently
[1:19:21] it should be able to
[1:19:24] that's that's that's the real running of
[1:19:27] God why because it's not a man running
[1:19:29] the church it's God running it
[1:19:31] if your pastor can be absent and you can
[1:19:34] take everything to God hallelujah and
[1:19:36] everything runs smoothly hard what does
[1:19:38] that mean that means even when he was
[1:19:40] here you were still taking everything to
[1:19:42] God
[1:19:46] foreign
[1:19:47] Hallelujah
[1:19:49] not to say that his position is not
[1:19:52] important but when you see him you
[1:19:54] should see God
[1:19:56] that's what made David's Mighty Men
[1:19:59] Mighty Hallelujah they was just as
[1:20:01] mighty as David was they were giant
[1:20:03] Killers why did they surrender under
[1:20:05] David because they saw God in David's
[1:20:08] life
[1:20:09] you had one man jumped out in the pit of
[1:20:11] the story they killing Lions you had
[1:20:14] another one kill so many men his head
[1:20:16] was shaken afterwards why would that man
[1:20:18] surrender to David
[1:20:19] he was just as mighty he could have had
[1:20:22] his own work
[1:20:23] he could have had his own private
[1:20:25] testimony but he saw God and David
[1:20:31] and that's where we are Church
[1:20:35] spiritual growth
[1:20:39] it normally comes the way of a trial
[1:20:42] and I got some different quotes but for
[1:20:44] the sake of time I'ma stop
[1:20:47] listen to Prophet God said God could
[1:20:48] with job he said God could have just
[1:20:50] stopped the whole thing
[1:20:53] he said but why didn't he'd much rather
[1:20:56] put you in a trial
[1:20:58] and then come visit you in the trial
[1:21:05] now I don't know about y'all but that
[1:21:06] excites me
[1:21:08] because I'm going through some trials
[1:21:10] Hallelujah
[1:21:11] and it lets me know that God has
[1:21:13] promised to show
[1:21:16] in the midst of my lack in the midst of
[1:21:18] my suffering God shows up Hallelujah
[1:21:20] just so he could show me his attributes
[1:21:23] to show me he's a provider Hallelujah
[1:21:27] show me he's a Healer show me show me
[1:21:29] he's a deliverer it's my trial that
[1:21:31] brings those things out
[1:21:39] so I hope we look at things different
[1:21:42] this morning
[1:21:43] and in my closing just to give you a
[1:21:45] scope of it
[1:21:46] improving there's something called a
[1:21:48] three-cut method
[1:21:51] where the tree is cut three different
[1:21:52] times
[1:21:54] just to deal with one branch being cut
[1:21:56] off
[1:21:57] the first cut
[1:21:59] holy you would think let's cut it to the
[1:22:02] base brother Kenny and just deal with
[1:22:04] the whole thing
[1:22:05] you can't just cut it from the base
[1:22:07] because the weight of the branch it
[1:22:09] ripped the tree when it's going down
[1:22:11] didn't be parts of the tree exposed that
[1:22:14] has to heal
[1:22:18] that's why a pastor doesn't just go
[1:22:20] right at the problem sometimes
[1:22:22] because they know he goes right through
[1:22:24] them chomping Hallelujah other people
[1:22:26] are going to get hurt
[1:22:28] that shouldn't even have to go through
[1:22:30] it
[1:22:31] so what that three cup method does it
[1:22:34] goes so many inches out to where the
[1:22:36] branch is
[1:22:37] and it cuts underneath
[1:22:40] where nobody can see the cut
[1:22:44] that's what I love about a true God
[1:22:45] called Ministry
[1:22:47] the word will come and cut you in ways
[1:22:49] that nobody else knows about
[1:22:51] a pastor come and deal with situations
[1:22:53] that nobody else knows about
[1:22:56] Hallelujah now you have to be spiritual
[1:22:58] enough to understand that it's for your
[1:23:00] good
[1:23:01] Hallelujah he comes in and cut the tree
[1:23:05] Hallelujah and he cut it up underneath
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:09] you don't cut it all the way up
[1:23:13] and did a second cut
[1:23:15] you come out on top now
[1:23:17] a little bit beyond that cut
[1:23:24] and you cut straight through and asked
[1:23:27] the trip the branch falls
[1:23:29] what stops it from ripping all the way
[1:23:31] at the base that little cut that nobody
[1:23:34] else sees
[1:23:36] and sometimes it's the way God deals
[1:23:38] with us in private that keeps us afloat
[1:23:42] sometimes it's the way that the ministry
[1:23:44] deals with us in private Hallelujah it
[1:23:46] stops us from ripping unnecessarily
[1:23:49] and then once all of that is done the
[1:23:52] branch is off then he goes to the base
[1:23:54] of the tree
[1:23:56] and cuss the whole thing off of it
[1:23:59] there's no pressure
[1:24:02] there's no unmerited weight
[1:24:05] Hallelujah there's nothing to stop it
[1:24:07] from being a smooth cut
[1:24:10] and that cut is so smooth it heals so
[1:24:14] easily to where it looks like there was
[1:24:16] never even a branch there
[1:24:21] what we want God to do
[1:24:23] we don't want to be coming to church
[1:24:25] like see look where God cut me look
[1:24:30] no we wanted to be so smooth
[1:24:33] that you don't even realize I went
[1:24:34] through this trial
[1:24:37] Hallelujah
[1:24:39] I got an analogy I'll use all the time
[1:24:41] about people who want you to know
[1:24:44] they're going through something
[1:24:47] it's like a broke down washing machine
[1:24:52] the unbalanced washing machine
[1:24:54] sisters you know when you first buy that
[1:24:56] washing machine
[1:24:58] when the floor and everything is level
[1:25:00] you can't even hear it moving
[1:25:06] even the fast cycle
[1:25:09] seems like it's humming
[1:25:12] I know some of you Brothers lost because
[1:25:14] you're gonna help your wives wash
[1:25:15] clothes
[1:25:18] and you know that washing machine when
[1:25:20] everything is balanced it's just haunted
[1:25:27] and realize what makes the clothes clean
[1:25:30] dirt coming against dirt
[1:25:35] it's the dirty clothes washing each
[1:25:37] other
[1:25:39] with the solution inside
[1:25:41] the solution is strong enough to break
[1:25:43] it free but the clothes have to touch
[1:25:44] each other
[1:25:47] and we got the word we got the anointing
[1:25:50] Hollywood what we need we need to work
[1:25:51] cohesively as a unit
[1:25:54] in church Hallelujah but those people
[1:25:56] who want everybody to know what they're
[1:25:58] going through like an unbalanced washing
[1:26:00] machine
[1:26:02] at first you could be on this part of
[1:26:04] the house can't hear nothing everything
[1:26:12] but when that thing gets some balance
[1:26:16] can't nobody sleep at night
[1:26:19] husbands be like honey why are you
[1:26:21] washing clothes at night
[1:26:24] that thing is so loud it's the same
[1:26:26] washing machine just the floors are
[1:26:27] unbalanced now
[1:26:29] it's just something tilting wrong
[1:26:31] and now it's
[1:26:37] do you have to get any hit pause
[1:26:41] maybe move the clothes around no it
[1:26:42] ain't the clothes it's the unbalance
[1:26:45] and that's why some people are when they
[1:26:47] come to church they're unbalanced
[1:26:48] washing machine
[1:26:50] we're seeing how great God is
[1:26:56] did you hear what we're singing How
[1:26:58] Great Is Our God
[1:27:00] and you your own folded
[1:27:03] and I was telling the brothers the other
[1:27:05] day I'm closing one of my favorites
[1:27:07] right now is Reckless Love
[1:27:10] and I know you're spiritual ones you
[1:27:12] can't get that because you're thinking
[1:27:13] God love is not Reckless but it is
[1:27:18] because God's love is so reckless even

[1:27:22] and grab you
[1:27:24] Hallelujah his love is so reckless the
[1:27:27] Hebrew boys just for standing for truth
[1:27:29] went to fire God says I'm coming in the
[1:27:32] fire with you his love is so reckless
[1:27:35] Hallelujah Daniel say God I got to pray
[1:27:37] Hallelujah they got to stop me from
[1:27:39] praying but I got to pray and God said
[1:27:41] don't worry about it my love will be
[1:27:43] there Hallelujah and this love goes into
[1:27:46] the lion's den Hollywood crystallize his

[1:28:19] but now it's about changing lives
[1:28:23] holy
[1:28:24] because it's a scripture that puts me in
[1:28:26] the mind
[1:28:27] he says God is going to reap in places
[1:28:30] he had and so on
[1:28:33] Hallelujah
[1:28:34] think about that God is going to reap in
[1:28:37] places he hasn't sown
[1:28:39] so how is he going to reap if he hadn't
[1:28:42] sown he's relying on us
[1:28:46] he's relying on us to do the soy
[1:28:50] Hallelujah
[1:28:54] Church let's go beyond
[1:28:57] just good services
[1:29:00] and let God Clean us up let God touch
[1:29:02] those areas of your life if you're in a
[1:29:04] trial right now I want you to know God
[1:29:06] is with you
[1:29:07] he wants you he wants you to recognize
[1:29:09] it
[1:29:10] he wants you to understand that his hand
[1:29:13] is upon you
