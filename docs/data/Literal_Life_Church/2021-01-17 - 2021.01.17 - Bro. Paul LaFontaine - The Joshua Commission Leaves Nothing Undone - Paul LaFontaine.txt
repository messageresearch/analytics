TRANSCRIPT
========================================
together and starting at verse 15. joshua 11 and verse 15. we have coming into a new facility and there's many there's many more announcements but we're going to just give them to you slowly if we read them all it would just be announcements and not preaching but we have a lot of things we want to integrate and just different things but we'll just take them little by little joshua chapter 11 and verse 15. amen everybody have it as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all the lord commanded moses i want you to notice the the biblical no no man can ever get out of the biblical pattern for god to contact and come to his people the lord commands the prophet the prophet commanded joshua joshua commanded the people can you say amen and joshua the joshua commission is to carry out what has been commanded so you'll never get around that biblical pattern that's the way he's done it today that's the way he's done it in every day and that's what he does the way he did it back here in the time of joshua and moses so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel in the valley of the same even from the mount haleck that goes up to sarah even into belgaud in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew them joshua made war a long time with all those kings when i read that i say lord i feel like i've been warned a long time when is the end of this war there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel saved the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all the other they took into battle for it was of the lord to harden the hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses and i'll read again from my text today in verse 15 as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses all of it was important none of it should be left undone praise the lord father we thank you lord for the word today we pray lord as we have brought our praise and worship and our appreciation to you the lord you'll give us something today from your eternal throne god something in our hearts that would give us a burning desire to serve you better lord jesus we love you today we want to express that love and lord we know that you express your love by speaking and giving us revelation and lord you loved us before the foundation of the world you loved us with an elective love and god that just makes us reach back to love you even more we pray father that you will burn the lord the the fires of god from the word in our hearts today i'm going to stand here and ask you lord burn out any starchiness that's in us burn out anything lord that's cold and if something's bothering us we pray father we just lay it aside because we know lord that if there's an answer that we need the answer is not in this world the answer is not in worry the answer is in you and so we may we give our hearts to you and may you break through in the spirit we prayed today and lord i'm just thinking about my father how i wish i'd have had him lord in that office this morning is this wednesday is the time of his passing last year i miss him lord but i know he's taken his reward on the other side i wish he was here to see the congregation worshiping this morning i i wish he was here to enjoy these abundant blessings that you have given us lord we pray that we would finish our course all of us as my dad did lord and finish his race as it were and be faithful to the message of the hour grant it father we pray and i just pray you encourage your people and use us once again to do that in the name of the lord jesus christ amen bless you may be seated thank you jesus joshua chapter 11 if you read the rest of the chapter beginning of the first verse all the way through if you'll read it sometime when you're home joshua 11 speaks of actually more kings that join forces against the children of israel we preached a few months ago about the kings the five kings that had joined forces against them now as time goes on we see more kings join forces joshua destroyed them and took over but now we see more kings joining forces in that and the battle intensifies in the book of joshua the battle intensifies but you'll see when you read it that the chapter 11 finishes in a complete victory i like to preach about victories i don't always like to preach about the battle but i like to preach about the victories and that's what took place it began with kings rising against them and that's the way sometimes our life sometimes at the beginning of a week of a week that's there's forces joining against us but i believe that we have the victory and i believe at the end of it in the chapter of our life i believe god gets the victory and that's the way it should be verse 15 has been just holding my attention here actually the last month or so as you just read it and i've been looking at one verse it's just been so inspiring to me and i'm going to read it again it's been just amazing to watch it and just keep reading it over and over again and maybe some of the stuff you already know but it just was a real inspiration to me many things in just the one verse and we see in verse 15 a real i guess i could call it a trickle-down effect from the lord to the prophet to the to joshua and then joshua commanding his people and joshua not only spoke it but joshua fulfilled it the bible says in joshua did joshua did moses the lord spoke it moses the prophet spoke it but joshua did it and that's a real transition if somebody is under the message that's come from god can you say man this is not something that we just quote the message is not something that we just quote can you say amen the message just is not something that we're apparent and just keep repeating and hope for results just because we're saying it but the joshua commission is that we're doing and fulfilling what the word said to do can i get an amen this morning and so now that there's a trickle down effect and i won't call it trickling down but i'll call it the authority of the word passed down because god brings the authority and the command that's what command means it means an order it means an authority the lord brings that and he gives it to his prophet and when he gives it to his prophet then of course joshua not necessarily a prophet but the the leader of the army it was turned over to him to carry out and how many know as we've been preaching this uh off and on the last year how many know what the joshua commission is the joshua commission is to take and go take the land that was the original purpose of the message coming through moses it wasn't just to have signs and miracles and wonders but it's to go take the land that was the order that was to command it and and if and if joshua didn't go do that then the message wasn't fulfilled yet if joshua didn't go out and take the people over jordan and take all of the inheritance that god promised the message wasn't done the message wasn't fulfilled no matter how much they sat around and quoted moses it would do no good because they weren't fulfilling the command the order can you say amen so the authority of the word passed down the lord commanded and given order and moses commanded joshua and joshua commanded the people we hear that in in joshua joshua commanded the people the command is to do something it's not to watch something a command is to do something a command is an order a command is an authority a command is to fulfill it and complete it um can you say amen so uh moses spoke things the prophet spoke things and the prophet did things moses did things but moses commanded things as well and what moses did was different than what he commanded moses did miracles moses was used to open the red sea moses brought the plagues in egypt he spoke them moses did many mighty wonders to prove to the people that god was real and god was in their midst and god was ready to take them out there was many things that moses did but there was things that moses commanded and that wasn't fulfilled into the joshua commission came and we've been trying to preach in this that we're no longer under the moses commission we're under the joshua commission anybody who's still living back in the moses commission is missing where we're at now it's a different season if it's it's a different time can you say man we are under spiritually speaking this joshua commission joshua did not represent heaven joshua will represent the battle to take everything that was yours in jesus christ can you say amen that's why the the seven seals were taken off the book in the last days and the book is the jesus christ is the book and the bride is the words in the book can you say amen that that's what the truth is is that he gave took the seals off your inheritance and revealing it to you in this hour so you could do what so you could take your inheritance everything that's mine i want to take what's mine every spiritual every part of a spiritual life living in jesus christ i'm taking it back from the enemy praise the lord i'm going to preach today whether i get a lot of amens or not praise the lord but you know you know you helped the preacher preach right so god opened the red sea but that wasn't the command of the order god did mighty miracles but that wasn't the order did you know that that wasn't the order the ephesians for the church is god's order bringing them into their inheritance and into the promised land many of these things you know but i'm just giving a foundation here now notice the words joshua did moses spoke but joshua did what god said the people under the joshua commission carried out what moses spoke under the holy ghost which is joshua was a type of the holy ghost let me say it again the people under the joshua commission carried out what moses spoke under the holy ghost the joshua commission is more than just speaking something or repeating something it's more than the prophet speaking the joshua commission remember this why this series came up one of the reasons why this series came up to me a few a couple years ago now was someone had quoted uh here in the message and said that the the only thing the joshua commissioned was for joshua to point the people to moses and i thought about wait a minute that's not scriptural all the fivefold ministry needs to do is keep pointing back to moses no that's not true what we're pointing the people to is what moses said not to moses not the prophet what did he say and what did it mean to my life and how am i supposed to be fulfilling it so that's the joshua commission and that's where we're at today any spirit that tries to take you back under the moses commission it's not taking you forward it's taking you backwards praise the lord so that some of these things you know because we've preached on them but the joshua commission is more than just quoting moses the joshua commission is more than just quoting my i i think it's so funny that my my wife says something in the early days when she was a little girl she was in a certain church and and uh you know that's before we have these uh ipads and the quotes and all the technology and everything and uh you know i can preach without it i don't really need all of it but you know before we had all that ministers will come to the pope but she remembers that as a little girl you know this brother had this pastor had an altar and he had all the red volume books of brother branham all the quotes and he had to bring them all and she remembers stacks of books being on the altar and that's basically all he did is just get up and read this one and lay this one aside and get over here and read this one read it and that was the service no wonder she didn't get the holy ghost unto that takes an atmosphere to bring the holy ghost can you say amen a new birth in jesus christ takes an atmosphere hello so it's not good enough just to quote the bible it's not good enough just to quote the message but we got to be praying for an atmosphere that our children can be born again by the word of god and we know it takes atmosphere to do it now if these things are a little strange to you this morning maybe you've never heard this before i just say give me a chance because i think i got something here this morning that will help you god's transition is to speak to his prophet but then when he's done with his prophet those words continue on this bible is full of words of of prophets can you say amen we're living of what we say i'm living my bible in my bible it's mostly the word of prophets can you say amen and so but we're not glorifying the prophet we are saying what did the prophet say that i'm to be living the life of jesus christ lord help me this morning praise the lord so it's to carry out what he commands it's not just to quote it there's a difference in an order spoken or given and an order being carried out so this let me just quickly now move this trickle down uh and and for those who are new this morning who don't who don't know us okay we are under the influence of the word of a prophet that jesus said would come in the last days and restore all things jesus himself said elijah will come and restore all things and not the personality not the person of him but the person of the word jesus christ spoken by jesus christ in joshua's day moses was no longer around when joshua came moses my servant is dead but now that joshua continued what he said and to fulfill what he said the emphasis was not on moses but on the holy ghost and joshua leading the people it was on the fulfillment of what was spoke by a prophet even jesus himself was a prophet he was the ultimate prophet can you say amen and my desire in my life is to fulfill what he said about me whatever the word said about me i want to do it i want and i don't want to leave anything undone i don't want to pick and choose what i want out of it through joshua moses could ride this trail again excuse me through joshua moses could ride this trail again and he was by the authority of the message by the word of the message that was in joshua and the people could write on and carry out the commission in that type because there's no you can't make the type fit any other thing the type is that moses was not there but what moses spoke was being carried out can you say amen last point i want to make in this foundation is that this joshua commission was a battle it was not a picnic the joshua commission of the message of christ of the last days is a battle don't make it anything else can i get an amen it was battles but it was victories as well it was a victory to get something that belongs to you and to take all of it not half of it not a quarter of it but to take all of it to leave nothing undone the joshua commission is not to sit around and just listen to moses the joshua commission is a battle to take what belongs to you i asked you today are you under this joshua commission are you under just moses or are you under the joshua holy ghost to lead you and to say what is mine as a christian what is my inheritance what has christ given me can you say amen lord i want to leave nothing undone i want it all i want it all now what's funny about people is they'll get that way when they got a literal inheritance when they hear their grandpa left them inheritance they get very greedy sometimes and i won't take more than what's mine i won't fight over what's not well some people do that they fight they want more than what's theirs but that whatever is mine in the inheritance and they go to the court they go in the conference room and the lawyer reads it and they're finding out what belongs to me people are so adamant about it but the bible promised to give the book back to the people that you have an inheritance that adam lost in the garden it went back to the hands of the original owner that adam held the title deed to this earth he was a minor son of god on earth i'm just backtracking so we understand what i'm preaching this morning is that okay adam lost the title deed and ownership to this earth that belonged to him went back to the hands of the original owner but revelations 5 says he begins to bring that inheritance back to his people and hand it back into the people's hands why could he because of calvary because of that cross now the ways made for you to take your inheritance back people get so adamant i want what's mine i want every dime if i get a thousand dollars i want every dime of that thousand dollars i want it why don't we be that way when it comes to your spiritual life is anybody listening to me this morning why people don't get up and fight the enemy to say satan i won't let you take away from me what is all of mine in jesus christ he gave it to me he purchased me at calvary he gave me an inheritance why don't we get at him and just just like a literal inheritance to say i'm sorry i'm not greedy it belongs to me and i want all of it in jesus christ everything that i'm supposed to be living every victory i'm supposed to come to if i'm to every gift i'm supposed to manifest whatever it is that's in christ i want it this morning somebody say praise the lord let's give the lord a hand i want it i want all of it [Applause] and i'm not going to leave anything undone praise the lord it's a battle so i just want to say anybody in the message who makes the joshua commission something different than a battle is a deception josh the joshua commission is not a land of intellectual knowledge can you say amen the joshua commission is not an easy predestinated floating into the rapture there's no scriptures in joshua that talk about just easily floating into the inheritance it's all battle it's all bloody battle it's a fight every day so the whoever in the message or anywhere else is preaching christianity and a message believer's life to be some easy we just float along we're predestinated casarasura until the rapture we just lay around and wait for us to be raptured that's not the joshua commission the john which of joshua is an everyday fight until we get out of here and it's a deception to make it just some intellectual convention where we quote the prophet no a believer it's a rugged every day serving the lord saying devil you will not take what's mine and most of it is a mind battle all the time every day believers fight a mind battle the same one that jesus christ fought when he was here the same devil that came to jesus himself and made him question whether he was the son of god if you were a son of god if thou be and he said satan get thee behind me and he quoted the word back to him we fight the same enemy all the time this thing's a battle not a picnic it'll be a battle till we get out of here and if anybody's noticed i don't know if you notice the battle gets more intense every week the battles the devil our enemy is getting more intense and he's fighting this congregation every week fighting to split fighting this fighting that you know we don't have to worry about all this happening in the government i wouldn't worry about it it's not worth it but you better watch the enemy trying to take you and take what belongs to you to destroy unity in the body to detach you away from the word you better be on your toes because that battle intensifies every week we have a real enemy and we have a battle and we're not a battle just to lose we're here to win can you say man i don't like trump's attitude about always winning he's a sore loser but i'll tell you we could take a little bit of his win attitude about the devil and say i when i go to battle with the devil i'm going to win he causes me always to triumph in jesus christ i will always try up because i have the holy ghost somebody say praise the lord so this is a battle it's not a you know just a sunday school story here we're in a battle every day and the joshua commission it's war john i wish we had seen that song this means war this means war because this is a war all the time and the joshua commission is to go fight for the land the land of the lot not the land of intellectual giants the land of all the promises of god of who you are and who you will be that's your land that's your land what did joshua the people do with the promise more than talk about it more than have meetings and dazzle in a convention with quotes more than try to interpret what the prophet said here in joshua is no idolizing and deifying moses i know i'm saying some straight things this morning but anytime in the bible they deified a prophet god was against it the joshua commission is not to deify and to idolize any prophet moses or any prophet you can't find that in the book of joshua so don't do it jesus christ is the hero around here it's not paul lafontaine it's not william branham it's not any prophet of the bible it's what christ did through those prophets and what he spoke through those prophets he is the one glorified in this place today and if he does anything in your life he's glorified as well in your life true believers today are not still debating over things they're fighting for things i think some of these could go on your refrigerator this week these are pretty good quotes lord gave me true believers today are not still debating over the interpretation of the message they're fighting for the spiritual life that's in it we're fighting for the spiritual life of it it belongs to us so now i want to transition to this other thought in verse 15 it said josh so did joshua he left nothing undone so let me take a few minutes and i want to get to this part that really speaks to me wouldn't you love to have a warrior that leaves nothing undone that's what israel had he was determined he was going to leave anything out he wasn't going to let some devil stay in this little part of the land because it was harder to to root them out he had the mentality just like a few chapters ago there was those five kings and they caught the five kings and they destroyed all the the nations but he said put the five kings in a cave and put a rock in front of it and i'll deal with them later he didn't just say let the five kings go put him away i'll deal with that later because he's he's going to every crevice everything everything has to be destroyed that's taking their land away from him he puts them inside brings them out later makes those five kings a spectacle puts his foot on the on the neck of one of them and lets all the heads of israel say give them faith to realize this is what you can do to your enemy this is what you can do to satan he's not stomping on you all week but you're putting on your foot on the head of the enemy and that image just stuck in their mind and he said i can do it he said this is how i can live and he gave them faith for the next battle things over your head this week things over your head are under his feet praise the lord so he left nothing undone he what that says to us this morning the joshua commission never leaves something out or leaves something undone or makes something unimportant it's embracing all of this word and fighting for all of it joshua may have been the first one who maybe said uh the devil's in the details he might have been the first one who said that because that's the way he approached this battle and this inheritance and this word from the prophet he said the devil's in the details because if we let him let a little detail pass if we leave something undone and unaddressed the devil would be in the details the devil is going to start to work in that so we can't leave anything undone joshua didn't leave anything undone literally in this case when you say the devils and the details literally the devils are in the devil is in the details in your life literally the devil and so in this case the enemy was in little places and he had to be rooted out they couldn't leave something unfinished and if you leave something unfinished in your life and justify it or put it off it'll come back to haunt you someday as a believer you'll have to deal with it someday can you say that i'm going to get practical here because that's my ministry my ministry is not to say stay up here somewhere but i'm going to get right down where we live is that okay with everybody that's the way i try to do so now if you leave something unfinished under this joshua commission he left nothing undone if you leave something unfinished it'll come back to haunt you someday we must take the word for all of our lives and what it is and so we're grateful for a warrior joshua how and how he handled the message the way joshua handled the message of moses he says we must take it all and we must leave nothing undone we must cover all the bases we must be interested that if it was important enough for the prophet to say that it's important enough for us to do if it was important enough for god to speak it through the prophet then it's important for us to do can you say amen the message of christ in the wrong hands can get mishandled and we suffer for that when it gets mishandled it leaves parts undone it leaves parts out joshua said it's all so important can you say that this bible this is not a buffet where we just come and pick and choose what parts we want systems of denomination tend to pick out what they want and leave out what they want and i think we should leave it alone and believe all of it you may not be living all of it but you say i want to live all of it but one thing we don't want to do is leave certain parts out can you say man we don't want to leave little parts out we want to we don't want to leave parts undone this is not a buffet and the message itself is not a buffet where we pick and choose what we want out of it it isn't that we pick what parts we want to emphasize and ignore other ones sometimes in the message we have picked out certain parts and emphasized certain parts and we've de-emphasized other parts of it and in doing that sometimes we can leave important parts out i'm talking about the history now of our years moses took what god commanded and joshua said we're not going to leave anything undone if we have received a message then we should have the the heart to say hey it's all important to us let's not leave anything undone amen and so it must it you know it's like a wedding you know there's so many important parts to a wedding has anybody ever heard a minister get nervous and forget certain things he was supposed to say like important parts anybody that's happened it's happened he's it forgot certain things that had to take place and should have been said and because i've been in that place so many times of reading from that book and then you missed something that was really important and it's really bad when you do if you feel bad about it and i remember a few years ago it was quite a few years ago 15 years ago i was asked to do a wedding in africa tanzania and this couple had always wanted me to do their wedding they had read some of my articles and different things and so they did so well i couldn't i couldn't go the date that they set so i said you know i can't come now they said when can you come he said well we can i can make it next year for the convention and come over for that part you know what they said we'll wait i said you will that's sure different some of the american kids that can't wait for nothing boom i can't get all everything in quick enough and decisions have already been made they said we'll wait for a year to you can perform the wedding and uh so i went over and got there and i talked to him a little bit before the wedding and so i said what do you guys want you know and and so they said we'd like you to do some of the things the americans do in their wedding and we'd like the kiss we don't do the kiss here they said we'd like the kiss i said all right i'll write it down you do the kiss you know so we did it got it all set and everything so i got into that wedding and we did the whole thing and i got towards the end of that thing and when i pronounced the man and wife the place erupted into this how you do it michael i don't know and it so scared me and took me by surprise that i forgot the kiss the one thing that they had asked for the important part completely forgot you can imagine how bad i felt i just pulled myself together and i said okay say a prayer get rid of this thing i don't know what's going on here so i wouldn't found him at the reception i was so apologetic i said i cannot believe i forgot that the most important part well not really but to them it was important you know kiss is important you know in a marriage don't forget the kisses all right all you old people you don't want to admit that but it's don't forget the important things special to the wife can you say amen easy for young couples not to forget but you leave after a while you leave and this is a quote brother branham says quite often he says we look for the big things and we leave the little things undone sure enough i got there i said i remember finish my story i said i am so sorry i just reached over they were up front at the reception i'm sorry i forgot the kiss i'm so sorry oh it's okay brother it's okay it's fine we have our whole marriage to kiss we'll be fine but i could tell they were a little disappointed because that's the one thing they'd asked for was the kiss and i forgot it in the ceremony and i've had other ceremonies where i've forgotten it feels terrible you can't forget important parts you might have other things but there's important parts like man and wife that's probably don't forget that one i remember there was a wedding in pennsylvania a few years ago and i was standing there the father was with the daughter i might as well give myself away here internationally and i was just nervous and i said who giveth this man to be married to this woman and the father's kind of stumbling around well that's not how really it happened it's happening and i quickly just i i mean the woman to be married to this and i just basically forgot what i was supposed to say and it's right there in front of me and you know you have to be there in my position it's rough don't forget the important parts and i said in this couple i'm so sorry they said we'll it's it's fine it's all right brother we're glad you come and done the wedding and we have lots of time for kissing i said praise the lord i felt better about it actually but you can't leave the in a marriage you can't leave brother abraham says it several times he says we put emphasis on the big things and we leave the lesser things we leave them to the side and i believe that's what we do sometimes in the message is we put emphasis on certain things but we leave some of the important things out you guys have those scriptures of the pharisees here's a group that did the same thing jesus said you have those two scriptures uh there somewhere of the pharisees i thought this was interesting to point out because when when god sends something and sends a message even through jesus christ when he sends through the prophets and all these other things i'm skipping ahead here in my notes but if you guys have those scriptures do you have those matthew 23 23 will unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of men and anise and coming and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone the next scripture says the same thing but in just i want to add it because it's just a little bit different way you guys have the next one luke 11 42 but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe meant and rule in all manner of herbs and passover judgment and the love of god these are ye have done and not to leave the other undone so it should be noted that religious spirits and no matter what age you live in under any message tend to take the message and emphasize certain things and leave other things out that's some pretty important things they've left out the love of god you see that never take place in our message it's happened so i've watched since a kid emphasis put on clothing is clothing a part of what we talk about in the bible yes of course i've seen emphasis on clothing i've seen emphasis on a woman's position not the man so much but the woman let's get her in order let's get her in order and everything else will fall in place and if a guy is saying that it sounds like he needs to get in order come on people you know what i'm saying is true emphasis on getting her emphasis on marriage and divorce and what her position is and what she should do and emphasis on this and we pull out parts of it and we put all the quotes and scriptures together but we tend to when we're being what we're doing is we're emphasizing certain things like the tithe or church order don't you come in church don't do this in church and we through the years so many years we took what we wanted to out of it and emphasize certain things and just preach that and think if i can just preach these outward things and get it all together then everything will be okay but you're forgetting very important things that children need a new birth can you say man our children need a birth just like you got one and it isn't just a carnal intellectual atmosphere that brings a new birth it's an atmosphere of the holy ghost that brings new birth the word being preached in an atmosphere of the holy ghost if our kids don't get the holy ghost then they're not going to be able to survive in the day that we live in you don't leave the holy ghost out you don't leave the moving of the spirit out the moving of the spirit oh that was that was nothing that's not important well my prophet said it is important that the spirit have freedom to move and to change our lives by that word it's always important who made it not important who has bewitched you and said certain things if you dress this way if you act this way if you've got your dress just this way then you'll make it just fine that's a deception clothing doesn't get you into heaven what you wear doesn't get you into heaven but as i said i guess i'll say it clothing's important because the bible makes it important don't dump it all out it's important to the bible it's important to the prophet as things were said but what i'm talking about today is people that take certain things and emphasize and the moving of the spirit and the things that the prophet talks about let me just surprise you look at this quote in invisible union of the bride of jesus christ can i take a few more minutes this morning look at this says he says and if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got to mother something it's her nature and just put your seatbelt on now with this quote but to bear a child for her husband and raise it to the service of the lord that's entirely out of her line she should oh she'd be disgraced if she did by her sin-loving society of this 1965 type of women this was said in 1965 a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngins around her they dumped that out years ago and yet that was the birth of the church now i know that we're not in the birth of the church dispensationally and i know that we're in the adoption time i understand all that but individually every person has to start somewhere in a new birth and let me remind you every birth is a mess they haven't found how to clean that up yet there's water there's blood the spirit of life comes in the baby it's a mess whether you're a millionaire woman or whether you're a poor woman a birth is a mess now how do you take away the mess in a birth and say we've got a new this is a new thing no you don't take it a birth is a myth someone cries out to god someone a lot of times is crying someone is saying i need god and i don't care about the world anymore and i don't care about everything i'm not going to try to figure this out anymore i just lay down at your altar lord take me do something in me god rips that old nature of the world out of them puts his own nature in there by a new birth you don't you tell me that person's not going to get excited the birth is a mess that's right and don't ever let intellectual giants take away that principle that the birth is someone dying out and you they may slobber they i've seen them at the altar and there's when there's no kleenex available and there's slobber and there's makeup running and it is a mess they look ugly but to god they look beautiful and i just challenge you you're not going to get to heaven because you just come and just just agree with everything you need a new birth by jesus christ every one of you say well i grew up in this and i accepted this accepting is different than a new birth that your nature has changed i love you that's why i'd say that it says the true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming shout and tongue speaking acts two through eight young is around her yeah you see she yeah she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah wouldn't hurt to hear a few of them this morning why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of the churches while they throw her out right quick why are you letting such stuff as that go on in your church screaming hallelujah stringing amen that might be odd to you this morning but listen i like the people to preach with me if you're excited about the word you should show it amen means so be it it means i agree it means so be it hey brother paul what you're preaching so be it in my life amen hallelujah praise our god i said it to you last sunday bring your praise there's things you bring to church not just your kleenex and not just your billfold but bring your praise some of you didn't do it this morning but i encourage you when you come to church come to have church somebody say praise the lord there's probably some of you never come back again but anyway i'm gonna continue but she won't she don't want none of them screaming hauling blabbering acts 2 38 that's in the bible that's how it happened they were drunk the people said that when they come out of the room they were drunk birthed by the spirit and the word for that day birthed by the word for that day they come out of there and they said it's it's this certain hour of the day it's not night and the party animals they look like they're coming out of that upper room drunk well they're not drunk peter said as you're thinking they're drunk on a promise being fulfilled by the word of god and they come out of there staggering down those stairs gloria said praise our god hallelujah what he said in joel 2 28 joe said when he said it's happening right now to me his word is being fulfilled they staggered and they began to say praise our god and tell what he was doing and god did a supernatural thing all the nations heard them in their own language they weren't speaking another language they were just glorifying god but all the nations heard what they were saying in their own language i'm not trying to work up something this morning i'm pointing you the book of acts birth can you say amen we're getting away from a genuine birth we don't have a right to eliminate the important things in the scripture we don't have a right to just uh gloss this over and make it so pretty and everybody's so starchy we don't have a right to do that i say let the holy spirit do what he wants to do what if it gets out of order well god if he's there will put it back in order the prophet said i'd rather have some wildfire than no fire at all how many remembers that quote you i ask you would you rather have a wildfire or no fire at all when you need a fire i say i'd rather have wildfire and god have to put it in order than to not have any fire at all nothing worse than going to church with no fire god send your fire of your holy ghost can you say man miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she won't don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only that's the only kind that the word can bring forth hello those screaming shouting acts 2 youngins is the only kind the word can bring forth don't try to change the book of acts that's the birth of the church and that's the birth of an individual i'm not trying to work up something this morning i'm not trying to work up emotion if it's real you don't have to work up emotion whatever it is if the spirit of god overtakes you in a new birth you're going to express it some way it's not a mechanical i'm giving an example of that's the only kind the word can bring forth born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joining creed going bobbed hair painted face there's no such a thing as that in all of it you don't find that in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god streaming hollering shouting praising god praise the lord you don't want to kill the spirit we don't want to let put away the important things can you say man i might have to find a place to end this so we've seen emphasis on drafts we've seen emphasis on pastors authority in the message we've seen emphasis on predestination we've seen emphasis on paying your tithes church order you can have all that but leave other things undone can i get an agreement today you can have all the outside looking right you can clean up a pig on the outside but there's still a pig by nature the nature's got to change you clean up a pig you make them smell good you put them on the front row you polish at least to say amen you force him to do everything and you take the leash off and he will run for the first mud hole he can find right back to the world because you haven't changed this nature but you change the nature by jesus christ he's not going to desire the things of the world anymore it's truth isn't it you can have all this and leave the other things done and when i started when i started to feed on the message for the first time when i was 16 years old and i started to feed on the message of christ there was a i realized there's a lot more in there than what i realized it wasn't just doctrine it wasn't just clothes but my position was revealed in the book of life he is the book she's the words in the book this wasn't a new religion when i read the message when i fed on the message of jesus christ this wasn't a new religion people have made it a religion but it never was a religion to me this is not a religion this is my land of inheritance that christ purchased for me and i'm ready when i when i fed on the word i said lord i'm ready to fight for everything that's mine i'm ready to go to battle i'm ready to go to war because i realize the devil squatting on a bunch of things that are in my life that really belongs to christ belongs to me and so i'm ready to fight i'm ready to go to war i'm ready to take back what's mine i've seen a spiritual life in the people of the bible i've seen a spiritual life they come to can you say amen so so many more examples i can give of things getting off track like the pharisees so many more examples let me find a place if i can to end this here this morning there's so much i could finish next sunday but just let me read a couple things and then we'll be we'll be done i pray there's a stirring in your heart whatever you think of me that's besides the point i pray there's a stirring in your heart to look to the word of god say lord have i become too starchy is this just a religion to me and a lot of times people in the message make it a religion to us parents make it a religion sometimes parents make it something that is just do's and don'ts how about we forgive them how about we not live in the past anymore how about we start enjoying our future walk with the lord how about we let the past and the past and look at this thing ourselves and say just because somebody left something undone doesn't mean i can't take it and take all of it and say i'm not going to leave any of it undone and by the help of the lord i'm going to emphasize the right things can you say amen i i want i want it all can you say amen and like jesus said to the pharisees you should have done this nothing don't leave the other things undone don't leave anything undone but you know i could talk a lot more about that love of god when he says to the pharisees you have admitted the love of god that's a pretty big charge that you're standing there paying your tithes of mint and all the other things they pay tithes on and they're going into the temple and they're praying and they're jesus said you're you're praying um to be seen of men it's all outward you pray long prayers you know what jesus said about the pharisees they're still alive today it's all a show pride that comes in the message that i'm better than the rest of the world i'm better than anybody else an outward pride and jesus just said don't leave other things undone but he said but he said you've admitted mercy and love that's pretty important stuff so could it be that you could take the very message of god and omit mercy omit the love of god and he says you ought to not let that undone and they they they did it they they were doing all this stuff outwardly in they were lacking things important things what man can take a true message and twist it all up it's happened in the past it's happened today but i'm asking you to say to the lord lord is there any way i can forget all of my history everything i read in the bible says you can start fresh his mercies are new every morning and if my dad did something wrong or my mom or the preacher that i was under who hurt me or whatever it is i'm able to take that this morning and say lord can i do what paul said in the bible forget those things which are behind and take another look a fresh look at this message of christ and say lord it must have been pretty important you sent it to us from your throne somebody's got a cloud over it and i'm hesitant of it is there any way you can just take my heart this morning you don't have to do anything you don't have to do anything this morning but just say lord give me a fresh start you see that i know i know well enough of this i'm gonna have to do this and i'm gonna have to do that and i'm gonna do that in order for us for me to even be accepted who told you that if you really seen calvary the way you should see it he accepted the sacrifice for your sin he accepted all believers at calvary you've already been accepted in the beloved so when you come through a surrender of a new birth that's and you say that power of calvary come in me and change my nature that's all god needs from there god takes over but i'm going to do this i'm going to do this yeah because somebody taught you that you have to do all this to be accepted you've got it wrong you've got it wrong the power of the cross comes in you and he starts to do those things it's a little quiet in here but i'm telling the truth telling the truth you know why it's hard for us to solve that because there's so many things the messages showed us that is the christian life to live and we got to do this we got to do that i know i know and we're blessed with it i don't i don't have a fear of that i just but i know one thing i can't live at all without this holy ghost and if he said it and he gave me the holy ghost then he must have a way for me to live it by the fire of the holy ghost every day he must it's like lord this is you this is you you bought me you purchased me you paid for my price of my sin at calvary and now you fill me with your spirit it's all you but i'm gonna surrender to all you i'm surrendering is that okay with everybody there's something i want to end on because years ago i did a study on truth and i called it the elements of truth because i began to discover discover in the bible and in the message that truth was mentioned with something else many times it wasn't standing alone by itself and we know how important truth is truth is believing the truth is everything it's so important jesus says you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free right so there's power and truth but then sometimes you see somebody who who they're still bound by things for years and say they have the truth well obviously there's something there's an element missing to truth because they're saying i believe truth i believe truth and they're still bound and jesus said the truth will set you free so there must be a power that goes with truth and elements true truth and when i begin to look in the bible i've seen sometimes it was mentioned truth mercy truth and mercy truth and mercy truth and mercy and then i seen truth and love truth and love just like jesus said you're omitting the love of god truth and love true love so i'm only saying that to say this you can say that you have truth but if it's without the love of god you don't have all the elements to it we believers we believe all truth has been revealed well let me see it in your attitude let me see it in your fire let me see it in your life let me see it in your marriage let me see it in your humility let me see it in your family come on now i'm a believer of all truth in the last days let me see the other elements that go with it let me see the deliverance let me see the power i'm not looking for perfection but let me see all that goes with truth if you're a believer of truth so when i begin to look i'm skipping through this i begin to look i found that truth is a person you say well i knew that maybe you knew that maybe you didn't know truth is not just the bible or written words truth is a person jesus christ i trust that he's here this morning jesus said i am the way the truth and the life truth is deeper than doctrine it's a being in the garden before the bible was written the tree of life was a person tree of knowledge of good and evil was a person she didn't know it was a tree oh was it something something spoke can you say amen through the serpent and pointed them to the wrong tree to eat off the tree of knowledge well there's something speaking there's somebody giving knowledge there when through the preaching of the word and the gospel personal revelation illuminates the soul of a person that if it's the true revelation of christ his presence has made contact with this person it's not a mechanical seminary of learning things of the bible i was saying it wednesday night what would jesus do what would jesus do and people are copying trying to be like jesus well that's not the full truth we're to have jesus living in us not trying to copy jesus he lives in us there'll be changes to that life because they've met the person because mr truth has moved in and is moving that person to walk in all truth didn't he say when the holy ghost comes it'll lead you and guide you into all truth christ is truth he's the embodiment of complete truth so if you have partial truth you don't have all of him yet all of him that you need anyway and might say that that because it's a person and not just a book then i believe because it's a person that this relationship is a love affair with the lord of someone you can unite with in spirit like marriage you can't unite with a book you unite with a person as much as i enjoyed the letters romantic letters from my wife after a while the letters weren't good enough i wanted the person is that is that a good illustration it's a person message is not a bunch of books and tapes the truth is not just that bible that's what we read and it helps us but it becomes a person to us that lives in us and i didn't want just all the letters i had the letters for uh letters and phone calls for all of about four months i guess i was one of those americans who rushed through my marriage just rebuked all the young people and i'm the one who did it too yep went out on our first going out date or whatever it was in may engaged by september married by december what a poor example i was i was 27 remember you know as i was ready to get married but i know one thing that after a while letters are okay phone calls are okay reading the word at church is okay but there's something deeper than that this is a relationship the message is a person it's christ it's not some man who brought a bunch of things no no it's much deeper than that the message is a person amen i think i'll just end right there as we just stand if you would the message and the bible all these truths is not i don't know what you've been taught even if you were grew up in our own ranks or if you grew up in denomination whatever it is it's fine i respect anyone here this morning in your upbringing more likely if you're here this morning god's dealt with you in your life somewhere god has dealt with you and if you have a hunger this morning i just would be careful that all your former teaching doesn't damage the view of jesus christ and what it should be to you okay you can have a fresh start and you can say i want it to be i want truth to be more than just words on a bible i want truth to be more than quotes and what my parents tried to get me to do i want it to be a relationship with this person because truth is a person and he's here this morning and he loves you he loved you before the foundation of the world he elected you i believe that with all my heart he just needs a response to say lord i surrender i surrender to all that truth so that i can come into relationship with you would you bow your heads and say i want that relationship but i want it with you i want that relationship maybe you don't raise your hand if you don't meet him maybe you're not there this morning but i pray down the road you'd get such a hunger i just want a relationship with the lord i want a deeper relationship with him and everything the prophet said in all the scriptures all culminates coming back to eden again in a relationship with him and if you've lost that if you've lost that relationship and it's become do's and don'ts or if it becomes something else to you i'm asking you to bring it back again and say i forg i forget the past i forget all that's been presented to me that may not be right and i start fresh it's just me and god today it's me in christ lord i know you spoke to my heart today it's just being you now may i leave this building lord beginning a relationship with you you just reach that hand up again say that's really at the end of the day brother paul that's what i want that's what i want i want to grow in a relationship with him the living word the person of jesus christ heavenly father precious lord who's gracious enough to speak through all the prophets of the bible to speak to us today because you loved us lord may the love of god be expressed through my preaching so much lord that somebody would fall in love with him today say lord forgive me lord may they cry out if they need that real birth lord real being born again it's not legislated lord it just takes a surrender to you draw them to yourself lord as they weep this morning as they lift their hands draw them unto you lord i pray change that nature change that life change all their desires bless them lord every hand that was raised whatever need they have where they're at in the name of the lord jesus christ who's present with us now do your work in their lives lord do your work just now by your holy spirit in the coming days may there be such a presence that goes with them they just couldn't get away from it they know that you're near loving them back to you granted father in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ i surrender [Music] all [Music] it's not a sign it's a surrender i surrender i surrender all
