========================================

with me to second Samuel chapter 13. we'll read a couple places in the scripture we greet you in the name of the Lord nice to have Miriam's parents with us from Quebec brother and sister petite it's been a while since we've seen them so it's nice to have them in Surprise this morning pleasant surprise and those who are back from vacations brother rap sister Elizabeth and all of you God bless you my family we treat you as our family and so it's good to have the family back together praise the Lord God is good amen praise the Lord remember your missions giving is going to a lot of places no matter small or great what you give remember as brother Jim leads that we just pray that you God will multiply it we can help in the needs seeing six churches and Laos there is such a blessing and to see the translations going on there to that language God is prospering it and making it go very well so we're very happy for that praise the Lord in second Samuel chapter 13 we'll pick this up again from Wednesday night and we'll just continue with a few things here in points I'd like to make this young men and women renewing their strength and that's what we'll speak on here this morning we just pick it up we don't have time to read the entire chapter you know the incident and the story here so we'll just pick it up here maybe in verse 11. and when she had brought them unto him and to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister and she said nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in Israel do not thou this Folly and I whether shall I cause whether shall I cause my shame to go and as for thee Thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel now therefore I pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee how be it he will not heark he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her and then Ammon hated her exceedingly so that he hated wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and animals said unto her arise and be gone I want to add another scripture this morning that I didn't expect but it's a familiar scripture in the New Testament about strength Ephesians chapter 6 and I could almost just quote it and many of you know it by by heart talking about the armor of the Lord and how many knows that we need to keep on the whole armor of the Lord in the times we live in it is a time to keep on the whole armor of the Lord and Paul says it here at the end of the Ephesians chapter where he goes into the depths of a Christian life then he ends it by saying verse 10 the psalm of saying finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that she may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Gert about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always prayer is a part of your armor too praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there into with all perseverance and supplication for all the Saints verse 10 says finally be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might praise the Lord may God bless the reading of his word God bless you may be seated so this past Wednesday night I went into a subject um here and I dealt with five points out of this second Samuel chapter 13 that I feel like were valid things that we can learn from not only all of us but also the young people of this generation and as you know I'm uh this I mentioned Wednesday night I'm doing something that I really enjoy doing and I was asked to do a youth camp this week this next weekend for the young people at brother Mike Wall's Church they have about a hundred young people gathering in Virginia and then finishing it out in Washington DC on Sunday so I'm always excited I always considered a huge privilege when I get the chance to speak to Youth and we continue that vision and that that burden here and continually if your young people attend here they're going to con receive a continual teaching on the word of God and principles of his word and boundaries setting them in the right direction Satan's certainly doing his job to teach our young people today and to get and he's Relentless about it and so to counter that thank hopefully we have something stronger than what Satan says it's the word of God but we must teach that to them and then they must receive it in order for it to do its work so we're very excited about being able to go and do that brother Stevens true will be ministering this Wednesday and Sunday and he's told me his subject and I think it's going to be very timely for the church here talking about being in the valley If he if he doesn't go that direction then I was wrong God changed his Direction but I think it'll be a very timely Series this Wednesday next Sunday with brother Stevens true here praise the Lord but we are excited about being able to share this and I wanted to share some things that are relevant out of these points to the congregation and whoever else may be listening and this story in second Samuel 13 is a tragic story if you read it it's it's not a good thing that it ends on but we find that there's some points of I want to switch it now because there's some points in strength that we can learn from in responses and everybody can learn from these responses from Tamar God bless Tamar I look forward to being with her someday shaking her hand as a sister and to watch her strength that she had here the only reason that she was violated is because she found herself alone and didn't not have any protection around her to stop what was going on but as far as her principles and her strength and what she said here we can learn from it greatly not only the young people but also many of us who need strength in the Holy Ghost and so uh when you have a woman responding with strength like this in the worst possible forceful atmosphere then we can learn from it can you say Matt as a matter of fact we could safely say that these things are a type of the Bride because she's going to need strength at the end time to live in the middle of Satan's Eden in the weakness of this age I mentioned Wednesday night that Jesus referred to the age as a a wicked and adulterous generation and then brother Brown says it's a weak and adulterous generation and I believe that's the generation we live in it's marked by weakness weak in the mind weaken the spirit weaken convictions weakness but also adulteress and I think those things are tied together because you have if you have open doors to perverted sexual Spirits it's because it's a weak conviction it's a weak mind it has no principles to stand against the adulterous spirit so the spirits enter in when you open the door by the weakness of the mind can I get an amen this morning a weak and adulterous generation goes together and soon as you open the doors you open the doors if you don't use the word as your boundaries and the word is your protection then you open the doors to your life to your family and to your church to sexual perversion and that goes for Christians too were not exempt because we're a message Church demons are still the same matter of fact their guns are trained on Believers more than anybody his guns are trained on young believers that are hearing this message more than anybody in the world he's got the world but it's our young people that he wants it's our children that he wants and I know if anybody noticed about the Antichrist spirit that brother Danny was speaking on last weekend but there was Satan just ahead of inherit Satan just ahead of the birth of Christ because he wanted to get their children when Moses was coming on the scene if I could get him at a child level if I could kill Moses before he comes if I could kill the prophet it's at a birth level that he's trying to get our children he was trying to that that Beast was trying to get a hold of the Christ child before he was born but guess what he didn't get a hold of him Christ was born power was born can you say Amen but his desire is to get them at a young level and so today is no exception I had a good conversation with my sister yesterday and she's let you know about the state that she's in and she's a woman of confession she's a movement of faith and uh we're standing together with her to believe for a complete healing for my sister but it had about an hour with her talking she shared with me some of the things that that God had just impressed upon her to share with all the people serving in the um uh uh the the uh homes excuse me the kids days this year and telling all the 60 or 70 that were involved to catch the vision of this this is not a fly-by-night thing but to prepare our hearts and some of the things she said in that was to realize that we realized Satan's pattern is to be relentless and intentional to go for our children in the schools today and everywhere he Satan has an agenda he he's he's blatant about it he's not hidden about it anymore he's going for the kids can you say Amen so why why is it that we have to back off and not teaching our children and being intentional to teach them the boundaries of God's word can I get an amen you parents have a responsibility to be aggressive to be intentional not to force it down them but to be forceful towards another demon that's trying to take your kids so we're intentional to train them we're intentional to train to to teach them and also to be prepared the Sunday School teachers everyone to be prepared and pray up say this is an important thing I can tell you I don't just get up here and just in the hour that we live in I better not get up here and just through a sermon together can I get an amen that's not the way it goes here we're in different times I can't just throw a sermon together and make a few copies on the Xerox and get up here and repeat something no no no no I have to pray I have to labor for we're fighting way too many demons for that when I stand here it's not just a sermon saying God demonstrate yourself with the power that the people would receive something stronger than what the world is offering you ought to pray for me I have a lot of prayer warriors but I need more of them today because you don't prepare this isn't just public speaking this isn't just a speech but I'm feeling the burden of demon power and I believe that we're in a time that we need all believers and parents to stand up to the plate a little bit and recognize how serious this is preacher so I appreciate her input and and so when you have a forceful and that's why this story fits because amnon would be a type of the mind and the brain and the spirit of Satan taking a kid over so much that it becomes not a respectful thing but a forceful thing and when you have a woman the bride living in Satan's Eden it's a forceful thing let me say this this new generation needs its own Revival in the word of God this new generation needs a Revival and the true Holy Ghost it's the it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost every young person needs their own baptism in the spirit of God this is this is the time for strength and this is the strength of this age to have the true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost not a sensation not an emotion not some fly-by-night thing but the real Spirit of Christ in their lives they need that strength because the Holy Ghost is what makes the word live can I get some amens this morning it's the Holy Ghost that'll make this Bible live can you say Amen it puts the convictions and principles to live by inaction against the devil you can have the convictions and principles but the Holy Ghost makes them live and puts them into action against the forcefulness of the devil it comes off of the book it's not just a Bible but the Bible now becomes alive and it puts it into action In the Heat of the Moment we need strength in not only our youth but also everyone in here we need Strength In the Heat of the Moment In the Heat of the private moment everybody can be strong here everybody can look like Christians here every every young person can raise their hand and I appreciate that but that's not what we need strength for that's not what will give you strength we need Strength In the Heat of the Moment We need strength when the devil's forcing us we need strength to answer back to Satan's lies Hallelujah and so the Bible gives us those things but the strength of the Holy Ghost behind is what makes it live and so I want to remind something else brother Danny said is that Christ he reminded us of Christ overcoming the Devil by the written word so I want to say that without it without a gift without using his power he could have used the power against the devil he could have used a gift against the devil but in that moment to show every weak Christian that the written word will work anytime anywhere any place if it's quoted black to the enemy that in itself has a power to it and that's the strength that we need our strength is not intellectually mentally trying to figure out how to overcome this oh my I'm In the Heat of the Moment how do I mentally get out of this our strength is in the Lord our strength is in the word our strength is in the convictions of the word of God it's not in you our strength is in the Lord be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen so now and so even the Old Testament people didn't have the Holy Ghost they only had it on their Spirit but even Old Testament people like Tamar here could respond to Temptation could respond to bad situations uh Joseph is a is an example and my son Gideon was preaching on the prosperity and what true Prosperity is I really enjoyed it because he went into Joseph which is a type of Christ and he showed how God could Prosper a man God could bring true Prosperity even when he was in the worst situations prison can be some of the worst situations I don't know if you've been to prison or not but if you've seen as Gideon said videos and different things it's terrible situations to be in that but in the worst possible surroundings Joseph Prosper prospered by God why because he was a man of conviction he was a man of principle he's a he's a man who didn't bend he's a man that was strong can you say Amen he was strong in those situations and you know the situation that fits in with today is that we have a pontifer's wife he began to work then when he come out of prison excuse me before that he began to work in the uh he was in prison he came out and then he was accused by a pumped over his wife or his boss's wife because she was coming on to him she was a a married woman number one she was a no doubt a highly sensual woman and she the Bible says she set her eyes on Joseph this young man maybe 18 19 years old and here he is and he's growing and he's got a body just like our body and he's growing and he's a his hormones and emotions and all that too he's just a young man and she's coming on to him and the Bible says she pressed him daily she had come daily and offer herself to them let me tell you something there is nothing they nothing to get that man out of that situation with a highly passionate sexual woman who was experienced and all that and to come on to that young man like that there was nothing to get him out of it except the fear of God that he had before God he's Young she's off herself hey but there's nothing to get out except the principles of the word and I like how he answered he said how could I do this sin I want everybody listening right now how could I do this sin against my God was so real to him and he was so sensitive to the presence of God that he didn't said say oh I might get in trouble or I he didn't have a wife so he wouldn't Ascend against his wife but it wasn't about the wife or this or that losing his job anything like that it was that how could I do this because he lived in a way that God sees everything and I don't live this because I'm trying to be a strong man to this pontiver's wife I lived this before God he is the one that I answer to he is here all the time I got a lot of teaching this morning to finish on this subject and it's one of those Services I'll be prepared to not get many amens because but I'm going to stand here and do it anyway because the devil needs it and some of us need it got to let the devil know where we stand that's right amen and you people that say he's preaching on me I didn't know you were going to be here how can you say that I didn't know you're somebody you're here other times you're not I never know when you're going to be here I don't know I'm not a prophet I don't know so I study what God gives me and I've heard that for years and I get intimidated about it he's preaching on me and usually I say I say no if I have to address things I address the whole congregation and I address many different issues it's just not one person if I'm directing at one person that would be a little disrespectful so that's the answer I always get but then I realized wait a minute I don't even know when they're going to be there thank you Lane 's here a lot though so uh let me just move on because I got a lot a lot of hair in my Fork here but listen let me say it again the new generation needs strength to be strong in the Lord because now it's a force it's a it's a mind manipulation Satan is intentional things he does as planned can you say amount how many know that we're under the influence of AI artificial intelligence if anybody's ever looked at that a little bit we're under it and it's in the news quite a bit because it's becoming they say it's a good thing on this side it's really good because we're more productive when we learn what the people are thinking and all this stuff but then there's this other bad side that they're starting to write about this thing could take over this thing could control well it already has the power of AI is already over our lives and has grown Way Beyond any of us realize artificial intelligence it's a control it's a power but run through computers and in an article by Brookings called how AI is transforming the world they summarize AI by saying AI is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information how we analyze data and how we use the resulting insights to improve decision making boy does that ever sound subtle it's going to re-change everything around so that we can improve the thinking process that we can improve the decision-making process that's serious and he says it's a transformation of every Walk Of Our Lives as a Christian I would be very very concerned about that it's already happening we're already underneath it it's a force so when I say Force when I say amnon Force this girl there's a force in this world there's a force it's not just a subtle thing that you've got to go get it anymore it's a force it's a control over our thinking the wisdom of this world sounds very good but we're not living by the wisdom of the world the Bible says if you read your Bible in First Corinthians 1 the wisdom of this world is actually contrary to the wisdom of God and actually it'll never be what the wisdom of God is can you say Amen we're not here to live by the wisdom of this world even though it sounds good but God's got a wisdom for us God's got a revelation for us a greater than Solomon is here now with the wisdom of God to teach us praise the Lord so now we don't want to be under that we want to have the Holy Spirit in our lives and we don't want something that's controlling us to transform every walk of our life we should be aware that that is going on and that effort is being made praise the Lord so now here's the story we're going to just remind you of the story and then we're going to get to five other points here from it in a teaching that show us the strength that this young girl Tamar tried to resist this force and so uh amnon is laying around and he's become what he says in love with this girl and Wednesday night we dealt with that he didn't know true love because after he says he loves her then everything every action that he did every action he expressed did not show genuine love and so we realize that means somebody can call something love but it's not love you remember brother I'm talking about the purity of the pure love of God flowing from his Fountain he's pure love but as the devil takes it and and perverts it it keeps getting down and filio love and then then it comes down to a rare perverted love but they're still calling it love uh a man who uh is with a man he says he loves the man so love is being used by all different terms today perversion well I did it because I love them so that's a perversion of genuine love and Amna and here he is he's sitting around and then he has a friend uh here whose name was Jonah dab and we we brought that out Wednesday night so if you want to listen to it you can we'll put it up but you see now he's laying around in his friend just to catch the story here his friend comes in and see his sees his friend amnon laying there and he said hey bro you know what's going on you've been doing this for about 10 days and you've been laying on the couch here and what's the matter with you you look like you're sitting here I am sick I am sick I've got I've got love for this girl and I'm I'm just sick about it I'm just you know and so he's sitting there and uh his friend says you've been laying there for 10 days in your bedroom uh you know playing Call of Duty the whole time Ops 2 and that's all you've been doing he said I know I'm a mess and this but this is what I'm doing I love this girl I'm sick I've got to have her I've got to have her I'm in love with her and and maybe in his earbuds he's got uh I'm in love with your body uh by Ed Sheeran one of the number one songs a few years ago blatantly says I'm in love with the shape of you my heart is coming along but really I'm in love with the shape of you I'm in love with your body that's probably what was in amnon's earbuds as he was on his video games I tell you you take a combination of all this stuff opening up the doors and the the the places for demons and uh you're going to turn into something I'm gonna tell it like it is you're going to turn into something you listen to country music you listen to the music of this world you do it privately and you feed on and you bring all this combination of stuff you're gonna get the results of an adulterous fornicating spirit because that's what it's done for six thousand years can you say Amen how how is it not going to get a different result so what we need is not just parents pointing their kids the right way and not just pastors preaching it and youth leaders teaching it every Friday night we don't just need that we need young people that are strong in the Holy Spirit in their life so they can combat these things they can recognize what would it be if young people would rise and streak today and say Dad and Mom listen I don't want to have my computer in the bedroom I want it out so it can be seen it's not the parents asking for it what would it be if we had young people coming to their parents saying that listen I don't trust the devil I don't trust myself I want to be strong in the Lord I don't want to have this Dad and Mom I want you to have on my phone I want you to have access to everything I'm looking at see parents have to do that sometimes I've heard parents have to do that but when you see what if we have the strength of young people saying themselves I want you to see everything I'm looking at hallelujah praise the Lord what if we had young people recognize the spirits behind country music what if they on their own come to an altar and really repented with results and say I walk up from here God's changed my life I believe he's changed my life and they go home and they kick out themselves perversion of the world out of their lives that's the strength I'm preaching about and guess what it's going to happen maybe not with everybody but I'm preaching because he's called he's calling young people to that in this stage so he's so love sick and he's doing all this and notice what happens He suggests his friend suggests if you do this and you do this and you do that you can set it up where you're alone together because really she had sets boundaries in her life he says my problem is I can't get to her I can't do what I want to her the mind and the spirits that he was feeding on eventually because you all know the long-standing principle that we've learned about lust lust is never satisfied you're only satisfied were you content in Jesus Christ but lust is never satisfied so lust once it comes to one level it's ready for the next level this I've been feeding on this six months but this isn't good enough now I got to take this less is never satisfied so he had come to the place it wasn't good enough just to look at anything or look at her from a distance I want to get to her I want to do something to her but I can't get to her because she's got boundaries around her and she's crying says oh he's telling his friend I don't know what to do bro I'm all messed up I'm sick and what do I do hey I got this you know I got this you do this you do this that she'll be in she'll bring you some cakes and you can set it up where you'll be alone time for a drink this is when you this is when you say praise the Lord Brother Paul keep preaching so with within just a little while once she's got her in that place he can do whatever he wants to alone with her so when he began to force her her responses were the right responses you know if anybody's ever noticed before but her responses were the responses of a Godly girl a strong girl remember Wednesday night I read the scriptures that we not only need strong young men I run right unto you young men because you are strong and you know how to overcome the enemy but then in Proverbs 31 we find strength in a Proverbs 31 Woman her arm is strength her clothing is strength she reeks of strength not that she's bodybuilding in the workout room she reeks of strength in the Lord don't mess with her devil don't mess with this woman that's what we need we needed a married woman we needed in single women we need the strength of Holy Ghost and married man we need the strength of the Holy Ghost and in single men can you say Amen we need to teach it as their young men how to handle it we need this is that we need the strength of the lord it's summarized God give us your strength out of your word out of the Holy Spirit make us strong can you say Amen how many raise your hand and say make me strong God make me strong in the word to be strong in the Lord let me put my armor on in this hour praise the Lord so here's how it happens so when he began before her first thing and that's my first point her first thing that she said he was the first she said nay which in modern terms means no now I know that sounds very uh simple but it's just got a lot of depth to it because young people don't know how to say no even our secular schools 30 years ago sent out the campaign for drugs just say no I don't know how well it's worked I don't know why we have a campaign to say no to drugs and not say no to a bunch of other stuff pre-marital sex pornography it's funny how they just put it out for drugs that's damaging to them drugs well there's a lot of other things damaging to them so they just kind of missed it there just say no when a spirit tells you I don't think I'm a boy anymore I'm a girl you don't hear the campaigns for that but I'm just going to teach you a simple lesson this morning it's not profound it's not revelatory it's not going to blow your minds where you get back in the park and say to your wife it was so huge and revelatory that I didn't even understand all of it but I'm good because no I'm just going to teach the first point and says we learn we need to learn and young people need to learn the power of saying no girls and young guys need to learn the power of just saying a small word with two letters no amdon no and he keeps going and she says what part of no didn't you understand the Inn or the o you young people have heard your parents say that it's one of our classic statements what part of no didn't you understand the N or the O there's only two letters in it it's real simple no young people need to learn the power it's because they have no strength if they can't say no and stick with or no it's because they have no strength but strengthen young men and young women is the the strength to say no giving in is weakness can I get an amen giving in is weakness strength is saying no and sticking with the no and the only reason this did not work for Tamar is because she was alone with him there was no protection and I I I regret that this has happened and and it's but it's a lesson for us to learn it's in the Bible we God didn't say leave that chapter out it's too graphic God left it in for our teaching for our learning these things are real young people these things are real and the only reason her strength to say no didn't work is because this man had come to such a place he didn't care for her he didn't love her he didn't care he didn't respect her no he didn't respect the family he didn't respect anything and he overrode it because they were alone sometimes we have this happen and and so it's just no so number uh Point number six from picking up from Wednesday night young people you must learn as a young person the power of saying no to someone doing or saying and wrong inappropriate things and then distance yourself from them when you do that that is strength can I get an amen that's when you're becoming strong let me read it again you must learn as a young person the power saying no to someone doing or saying inappropriate things and the reason I say saying is because it's not just doing something inappropriate probably 95 of our issues today is not doing something as much as saying something inappropriate in a text or in some type of communication saying something inappropriate that nobody else is watching so you need to learn how to say no say that's inappropriate don't ever say that again or I'll never communicate with you again that's strength but just to let it go on that's weakness and we want to be strong right and so even if it's saying inappropriate things then then I think going the extra mile if they stop if they don't stop doing that you distance yourself from them that is strength in the Lord and the scriptures I have to go with it I can do this here is submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you resist the devil and he will flee from you draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded don't be double-minded don't live in a double world don't say act like you're obeying to your parents but you're not obeying it all on your own no it's it's purify your hearts and don't be double-minded your principles your character the things you stand for are good when you're in public and they're good when you're in private they're good when somebody's saying inappropriate comments they're good anytime and they stay the same praise the Lord so this is the story I came to pass everything that Master's wife Master Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph so she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his master his wife behold my master what if not what is with me in this house and he has committed all this hath to my hand there is none greater in this house than I neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee because Thou Art his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God and it came to pass that she spoke to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her she did it she wooed him day by day not monthly not weekly day by day can you imagine the pressure that but he hearken not day by day Church alive with her or to be with her strength strengthen the Lord young person that's strength Joseph was put in that the Bible for a reason as a type of Christ came to pass about that time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by His Garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out I preached a sermon years ago on he got him out and I started preaching and I said if we could just live by those three words he got him out and I preached the whole sermon saying if we could live by three words not realizing that it's four words and not three and my precious brother-in-law Hank van wyke reminds me of that sermon the last 35 years because Henry has all of my bloopers I don't know what my mind's going but he's got all of my bloopers for 35 years right there if you need to hear it he can tell it it comes right up he's got them all he said Paul he said I looked over and you were preaching he got him out just live by those three words and there were people counting on their fingers you know for some of you it's okay to laugh you know Jesus had a sense of humor but he got him out is four words that we should live by he didn't try to witness to her I think God's put me here for a reason you know God prospered me and I'm like at the right hand of Potiphar's hands out he's put me in charge of everything in his kingdom and I think God's put me here for a reason to witness to this his wife program says you're on the Devil's Ground I can go to the pool hall and maybe I can be a witness no no you're on the Devil's Ground you don't go on the Devil's Ground he comes on our ground maybe I can you know maybe I can do something here and you know he's a man that's why I tell young men in young men's me he's he's a man with passions you know he stayed single he hasn't been with a woman yet so he's got his passions he got all this and all he's had to overcome personally himself now he's got a woman offering himself to them and you know his response how can I do this sin against my God number one number two he got him out and that's what I'm saying this is real simple today okay I got some simple principles saying no and he got him out what do you do when something's going on it's making you nervous you get out what do you do if something pops up on your screen or your phone you get out you erase it you get out of that room praise the Lord Bram says that then when he was there in his exaltation and before his excitation his temptation remember Joseph was put into prison because he was innocent the Roman because you know the story that once he said no and ran from her he grabbed his she grabbed His Garment and then she accused him later that he did something the Israelite General by the name of potiphar Padre went and went away on a trip he had a pretty wife and his wife had Joseph come into the house to do something and try to get Joseph to do something wrong and he was loyal to God I tell you they always you women I've hollered at you now I'm going to take up for you a minute see the woman is the weaker vessel I know there can't be a bad man before there's a bad woman but men knows that men knows that you are a son of God and take advantage of a woman shame on you no matter what she does she's a weaker vessel and you know that brother but I'm just lean in there just a little bit saying hey when push comes to shove boy you should have been strong enough to stop it because why because that's Joseph in the Bible I mean you're not going to change that situation unless there was some strong conviction in Joseph's heart for his God and when you don't have that then anything can happen she's a weaker vessel and you know that so you're the strong one in other places says you're the strong one you're supposed to be the stronger one so I'll get to another quote here in just a minute if she goes out acting unladylike take her by the hand and talk to her like a sister you're a Son of God don't do them evil things look at Joseph he was an example to you so he's saying hey wait a minute the guy's saying she's acting unladylike take her by the hand and talk to her like a sister you're a Son of God don't do them evil things look at Joseph he was an example to you going back go back to the next one I don't know if you guys can do that there so I'm going to my next Point here that's number six you must learn as a young person to the power of saying no to someone doing or saying wrong all right so now next she says to him uh Tamar says to him this is not what we do as Believers in Israel this is not even heard of I'll read I'll read it in her words so you understand For No Such Thing ought to be done in Israel right there Tamar is our identifying herself with the message that they believe God bless her in front of this boy alone she is identifying herself with the entire message she said we don't do these things around here in Israel the Heathen does this the world does this but she's saying in strength we don't do it this way buster this is not how the message teaches this is not how brother Paul has taught us this is not how the ministers this is not how my Daddy has taught me but never mind Daddy and the pastor this is not what we believe she is fully identified with the distinction that I am a part of the children of Israel that believe these Ten Commandments we stand on the Ten Commandments we stand on what we believe and in this Heat of the Moment I'm telling you this boy what I don't know what you're doing but this is not what we do as Believers this is not our conviction at all and you know it amnon way to go Tamar you go girl she told them and this is the world's way amnon this is not our way boy straighten up man up act like a man let me go let me go this is not the way we do things let's do it right so number seven you should never you should never be afraid girl or guy you should never be afraid to speak what we believe in this message to anyone at any time under any kind of pressure that is strength praise the Lord I ought to have every Daddy saying amen and supporting this not because it's Paula Fontaine but because it's the word of God it's the message it's what we believe you attend a message Church you ought to be able to say Amen in your heart at the very least to what we believe in this message you do your kids a better service to stand and make a strong stand for what you believe we believe this message should never be afraid to speak young person younger or young guy never be afraid to speak what we believe in this message to anyone at any time under any kind of pressure this is strength oh my God I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me I think you should not be ashamed strength is not being ashamed of what we believe in this message weakness is to be ashamed of it oh keep my soul deliver me let me not be ashamed for I put my trust in thee they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied oh let not the oppressed return to shame let the poor in needy praise thy name then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy Commandments in other words if I respect your Commandments in the Heat of the Moment then I don't have to ever be ashamed I can stand for this at any moment and stand strong even if I'm laughed at even if I've made fun of don't be ashamed can you say I would speak of the testimonies also before Kings and I will not be ashamed we shouldn't back down if we're before King we should proclaim the message in front of anybody can I get an amen this morning it doesn't matter if it's a king in public if it's the mayor of the city or if it's in a private moment or it's a text from a boy or from a girl that's an inappropriate comment we should not be ashamed and say this is what we believe and when I see a young person do that and they respond in strength to what this message says they might even not fully understand all the revelation of it but they're sending that message back when I hear about it I praise that young person God bless you young girl God bless you young man because the fact is is that God honors those who honor him God honors those who honor himself God prospers those spiritually that honor the message of the hour why because the message is what God has sent to this generation and whosoever shall be ashamed of me I'll be ashamed of him but whosoever is not ashamed of me and stands for the truth and that day I won't be ashamed of them God's on your side God has your back I'll stand with these young people from laodicea because they stood for me oh praise the Lord your Four Kings I won't be ashamed let my heart be sound in thy statues that I be not ashamed how many oh let's have young people that are sound in his statues sound in their thinking brother Bram says here concerning this point I say God give us boldness in men that will stand for truth regardless of what comes or goes that's what we need the gospel is not something for a gospel is for man God called men you never judge a man by how big his hands is or how wide his shoulders is I hear them say oh isn't he a man I've seen men that weighed 200 pounds and didn't have an ounce of men man in them that's right you don't measure a man by his size that's Brute you measure him by his character the next point is she said to him boy this is folly this is stupidity this is what her responses was don't do this folly eminent this is stupidity that's what Folly is this is foolish that's what Folly is this is rashness boy this is stupidity this is folly this is not the way to handle me as a girl where are you getting these ideas from this is a filing this is foolishness what kind of foolish mind are you Hamden you're the King's son act like it childish this is folly this is foolish you're acting childish and perverted grow up man up act like a king son if that's what you are God give us curls with strength like this and so that point goes to this strength is calling something for what it really is not justifying it don't be afraid to call something what it really is and she's calling it what it is this is not just an attraction to one another this is not love this is folly this is foolishness this is rashness for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips he that speaketh truth showeth forth righteousness but a false witness deceit but have I but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftedness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the fear of God in the sight of God what a tremendous scripture to say I want to live a life and I have renounced renounced the hidden things of dishonesty live life in the open Live Life honestly live life truthfully and never be afraid to call black black and white white never be afraid when something's wrong to call it wrong they're afraid to speak the truth right I don't care 1956. I don't care if it hurts the pastor or who it hurts it's God's Eternal Word and we're responsible for it the preaching of it we must tell the truth I don't care how bad it hurts can you imagine that that means that sometimes when you travel to tell the truth it hurts it's hard if it hurts the pastor whatever it is you got to tell the truth you got to be open can you say Amen but you know they spoke to the wrong man when he spoke to Micah you look at Micah in the Bible he was strong he followed after what the Prophet Elijah said he stood with it and he said they spoke to the wrong man when they spoke to Micah they tried to influence him oh no he wasn't one of these compromisers with his wing set to see if he'd get a good offering or not oh no no he was a man of God praise the Lord you love him God give us men who will stand for the truth regardless of who's setting close or who it is you guys I think the battery's out on the clock in the back s who are all in trouble give us men who will stand for the truth regardless who's setting closer who it is let the chips fall where they want to and lay the gospel to the healing line that's right call black black and white swipe now this isn't a quote just for older people this isn't a quote just for people to say oh that's my parents this is the quote for everybody call black black and white white and if the truth hurts go ahead and tell the truth because in the long run you'd be better to tell the truth than to to than to hide it can you say Amen young person you'd be better this quote is for you too let the kids fall where they want to lay the gospel of the healing call black black and white white can you say man rights right wrong's wrong if you're not right then get right it will straighten you up make you look different act different live different be different the Holy Ghost is good for you it will straighten you out next point now her next statement is and I wither shall I cause my shame to go I want to make this statement the choices we make today young person the choices we make today create the future That We're Dreaming of that's a man named Kapil totter wall and I think it's a good quote the choices we make today create the future That We're Dreaming of because every young person has a dream every young person has something and if it's based on the word of God without a vision the people perish every young man and young woman needs a vision based upon the word of God I got a vision for my life I got a vision for the kind of young man that I want to marry I got a scriptural vision for the kind of girl that I want you're going to approach a girl and you don't have that Vision in your heart yet based upon the way to the the word of God really you're gambling with your future we're not supposed to gamble either as Christians you're gambling with your future choices we make create the future That We're Dreaming of now she shows she is a girl who can look to the Future consequences of this action Tamar shows she's a girl who's looking at the future he was not looking at the future he was looking for the moment whether shall I cause my shame to go means that she was saying amnon if we do this how am I ever going to get rid of my shame she's a girl who's thinking about the future we need young people that think about the future not just for their careers but their testimony what will this do to my testimony and guess what you have control of your testimony you have a choice in your testimony and if you want a testimony amongst the congregation that builds respect because every young teenager loves to have the respect of parents and the people that I like you want the congregation to be able to say that's a that's a good young man they have their struggles but they're good they're they're trying and so you want that respect from the congregation you choose your testimony amongst the congregation you choose it and so he was blinded by his lust he didn't care about the future he lives for the one moment of pleasure and guess what then he ditches her she looks to the Future and knows the shame that will follow her life and his and she says that to him I may never lose the shame for this moment and I'd only like to correct her on that thing she she believes because there's no atonement of Calvary there she actually is saying something real I don't think I'll ever be able to get rid of my shame the rest of my life if I do this act wow but I just want to correct her just a little bit after Calvary after Calvary there's cleansing of sin somebody ought to be shouting Hallelujah after Calvary there's cleansing of sin and God can not only wash the sin away God can wash the guilt away God can wash the shame away God can restore God can make you a daughter son of God God can make you strong yes you do have hope to marry the right man because he can wash if you truly repent and have found that forgiveness in God he can wash it all away and you don't have to live the rest of your life with shame I may never lose a shame for this moment she says and guess what you will be looked at as one of the fools she said what do I do with my shame and as for thee thou shall be as one of the fools in Israel you won't be ever looked at the same buddy you will never be looked at the same you'll be looked at like a fool in Israel possibly for the rest of your life she has a long range vision for what this act will do she don't want a life of Shame and guilt she understood a long the long range consequences of sin we need young people that are strong around this world that know the consequences of sin because if you know what the consequences are then you'll have stronger convictions to say I don't live for today in the moment I don't live in the Heat of the Moment my testimony is not just now but it's for the rest of my life and I want to be strong that I'm protecting that the rest of my life God give us young people that understand long-range consequences of sin number nine point from this you should never act just in the moment but instead always have your future life and testimony in mind that is strength be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap God's not going to be mocked God has his principles God has his word and if you if you violate those things you sow the wrong Seas but God won't be mocked because he gave you his word before God is Not mock what sore man soweth for he that saw through the flesh shall reap the flesh corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life I know nobody will tell me the time so I have to look it up myself here oh that's not showing it can't get it thank you says I'll go another 15 minutes because I got one clap all right it sounds good these artists a bunch of artists went to Rome to study art these are young people all of them would go to out of the nighttime most of them and get a big drunk boys and girls lay out together just some of the modern the way modern Americans do but one young man they noticed that young man he didn't carry on like that he lived clean at night time he come home and went to bed he lived like a gentleman should and one day the old caretaker said I like to take a walk with you son he said all right they started up the hill walking together towards the setting of the Sun and he said Young fella you came over with that bunch of Americans didn't you and he said yes sir I did I said I want to ask you something he said all right he said why is it that you don't go out and drink and Carry On and lay out with the girls and things all through the night and come in the next morning the way they do he stopped put his arm around the old man he said you see the way that Sun is setting under it West he said yes sir I do he said beyond the setting of that sun there's a certain state in the New England states and said in that certain state is a certain city and in that certain city is a certain house and in that certain house is a girl and that girl I vowed before I come here to be true to her that when I return we're going to be married she made a vow to me a promise therefore sir all of my attention is attracted as far as it comes to women towards that girl at that place long range vision and he said I live today for tomorrow to come what a testimony God give us strong young people strong parents strong people in the Holy Ghost that In the Heat of the Moment they're thinking about their testimony you know you're an example of the rest of the church you're responsible to the rest of the body of Christ don't take communion don't children anybody else don't take communion unless you understand the soberness of it because if you take it unworthily and you're living in sin Paul says people could get me getting sick in the congregation and people could die because your irreverence and dishonor for the body of Christ how many knows that's Bible now I am not a prophet I can't attach things to tell who it is but you need the soberness to know if you privately sin and you take communion you could give someone a disease you could bring sickness in this body and we're going to hold on the atonement for the people who are sick the people have cancer we're going to keep trying but if I can work on this other end said don't take communion unless you've got everything under the blood and you're living a life that's going towards the Lord and not away from him things would be better if you would do that I live today for tomorrow to come what a testimony I live long-range visits and everybody can use this quote today can you say Amen all of us can live this quote I'm living today for the future what a Christian can say why don't you smoke why don't you have a little fun why don't you do this like the rest of them doing oh you can say Beyond a certain star there's a certain city and in this certain city is a certain person hallelujah oh I live for him for he died for me and someday he's coming and I live for that life that is to come that's why I live a holy life it's not legalism it's not anything like that anything these people that are detracting the message and teaching our young people that this is legalism no not when you get the Holy Ghost this is not legalism I live holy and Sanctified to my Lord not for today but I live because I want to see my Lord someday I want to go to a millennium with him and I know my acts and my Holiness won't get me in he's already purchased that but I out of respect back to the Lord what's the word say I want to live it I want to wear it because I don't live for today I don't live to be buff and you know just a a sexual type of attraction to some women or something like that I don't live for that that's today and you'll die with that but I live today for the future praise the Lord I'm enjoying this whoops all right the next point don't forget when he said I made a promise to girl over there I made a promise to her but I teach young men and young women you don't you may not have made a promise yet an engagement but you if you grow enough in the Lord you say I know God knows who my mate is somewhere so even though you don't know their name yet you can live today to protect yourself for the future and you can pray say God prepare that young man for me prepare them give them the Holy Ghost fill them with your spirit let them know how to get a hold of their Bible Lord and let them introduce let them be rooted down where he knows where he belongs he knows where he goes to church and he's in relationship with you pray for him now but I don't know his name game pray for him anyway God knows his name he doesn't he knows my name God knows your name and he knows your guy's name and guys pray for that girl say God prepare that girl fill her with the Holy Ghost take him through things Lord that are just driving closer to you see he is the lord it's wonderful so here's the last thing she says I got some of you are happy it's the last thing I pray that the last effort she gives and strength to stop this amnon speak to the king what a statement of strength stop this speak to the king and he will not withhold me from thee she's saying boy do this right go through the right channels build respect not disrespect and dishonor speak to the king she's pointing this loser she and her strength is pointing this loser to the authority in both of their lives she is actually making a last-ditch effort to stop him from doing this she's giving in an Open Door actually he's a loser she's actually giving him an open door to have her the right way I tell you I'm gonna shake this girl's hand he lost his life she went on God doesn't let these things go by God knows the future and I just got to believe he went and continued to bless her life he got killed she's actually making a last-ditch effort as I'm making a last-ditch effort to close this service she made a last-ditch effort to stop him give him an open door to actually have her if he would just do it the right way now if and she now she if now she can't get out of the room but she's making an effort to point him and and this was a smart Godly girl she would never give she would never give that kid or any other boy an opportunity in her life but what I mean by that is that if she got out of that room she would never open the door again for another boy to create a situation like this why because she has a value for herself she says hey if you're going to do this do it the right way man up go through the authorities in our life if you're a man then you won't have a problem working with all the authorities that's in my life I'm going to say this to everybody just now you will never be blessed by going around the authorities the delegated authorities that's placed on on planet Earth the Bible talks Of Us talks about us obeying the authorities of the land unless they tell us to do something off the word of God God works with his delegated authorities you'll never be blessed if you go around that she says if you're a man then you won't have any problem going to the king with authorities in my life speak to the king let that be a theme for all this as I'm trying to end this now let that be a theme for all of our Lives all of the influences that come our way all the force all the pressure everything goes to the authority of the word of the king and through the filter of God's word may we live lives that everything goes through the filter of God's word this word is an authority can you say Amen let us live life to everything nothing gets done unless it's brought through the filter of God's word and if it doesn't make it through the filter of God's word it's not going to be in my life but there are delegated authorities in a person's life they're delegated authorities a pastor as one parents are one the Bible's strong about these things you can never be blessed when you go around those authorities both parents mom and dad of the boy mom and dad of the girl that's what we had in the situations with Isaac and different ones in the Bible as we've taught these things for years to realize that when God looked upon it when they went about the proper ways to go about it then you can expect God's blessing come from it so the last Point number 10 is it takes a strong guy or a girl to resolve by always going through the god-ordained channels of authority in their lives you can never go wrong by doing it it is weakness to go around all of that and my sermon to you is young people young men and young women of strength in this age and I'm trying to point out I'm trying to move you away from what's strong it's not physically it's strong in your spiritual life it's strong responses to Temptation it's strong responses to the wrong boy I wish I could say the wrong boy or the wrong girl is out there in working in Starbucks with you Starbucks box Starbucks I wish I could say that's your temptation but just because everybody attends a church doesn't mean they're feeding on the right things so you might have a boy or a girl I'm not talking about any situation here I'm talking about 35 years of pastoring I was I was doing a youth meeting my wife and I had a few things every Friday night at our house you know why I did it to give them a place to go teaching them all these years and some 30 years ago had a young girl a young boy coming to my youth beings come about six months to a year listening to every possible thing being taught to them and I find out about five years later they were doing the wrong things with one another meeting together you know and that's heartbreaking nobody knows about that I'm not going to tell you who it is but it was heartbreaking to me to realize that someone within the church could disrespect those boundaries that much this is real it's a bit sober but I just want to say we're not playing Church this has nothing to do with Paul LaFontaine what you think of him this is me pointing you to what God has given us to prosper and stabilize and protect our young people that's what this is about and the quicker that parents and young people get on track then you will you will have a you will have a strength against the weakness of this hour the weak thinking the weak mind the wisdom of this world there's so much stuff that goes on oh just let them do that and do that it's the wisdom of this world now wait a minute wait a minute I've never stopped being a parent to my kids and they don't even like it sometimes but I'm still Daddy so if they live in my home they're going to be under the guidance of my home but did I even tell them when they're married already I give my opinion even when it's not welcome because I haven't lost my position as Daddy now they can get mad they can kick and scream they cannot talk to me for six months whatever you want to do but I'm still the dad in your life and I'm going to politely just suggest I never undermine their mates I talk to them together I never unwind that they're married to somebody so I talked to both of them I said you know hey I'm daddy so I'm going to continue to be Daddy I'm going to give some input to your lives oh boy here he goes again but I don't lose my office as being a protective father when they get to a certain age who said that that's a blessing God put and there's no age limit when it says honor thy father and mother mother honor thy father and mutter I said something Wednesday night what did I say I said the wrong word or something what did it Tic Tac yeah don't get on Tic Tac I don't know what Tick Tock is but stay away from Tic Tacs it's evil so I'm still their daddy and the thing is honor thy father and mother there was no age limit on that did anybody help me out the wisdom of the world puts all this stuff no there was no way it's honor thy father that your days may be long a bunch of other promises that go with it it's just it's God's principle honor obey your father and mother and when a wife gets married she's under The Obedience of her husband she's under the headshot I understand all that I understand it but there should be a respect level from both of them that we never come to this place that we're we're free we're out of this you don't want to be out of that all the things God places in your life a pastor whatever it is you may go through Seasons you can't stand me that's okay I love you anyway you go away for five years and come back and we're still here you're going to find me preaching the same way because God's word don't change you have to get over not liking me because I had to get over not like in you takes a strong guy girl to resolve by always going through God's ordained channels of authority in their lives it is weakness to go around all of that and the scripture proclaims some things a wise man is strong here a man of knowledge increaseth strength for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counselors there is what everybody say it the multitude of counselors go through the god-given authorities you got safety ignore them you got uh you got um unprotected uh alive you you don't have safety you have fear you have scared you have you're not protected it's it's it's not safe anymore but in the multitude of God's authorities there's safety wisdom is too high for a fool he openeth not his mouth in the gate he that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person the thought of foolishness is sin and the scorner is an abomination of men if thou faint in the day of adversity adversity which means the Heat of the Moment pressure Temptation if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small it's because you don't have strength that you faint In the Heat of the Moment and that's why he says a wise man is strong a man of knowledge will increase his strength I say Amen honor thy father and thy mother as the Lord that God had commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee in the land with the Lord thy God giveth obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch over your souls as there's no age limit on this this is a principle can you say Amen obey them that means somebody has a rule over you if you're 80 years old somebody has to rule over you godly people have rule over you obey them that had rule overly and submit yourselves for they watch over yours as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom respects 1961 I'm trying to wrap up the fear of God is the being in wisdom now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you are giving him respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear the people of this city unless I should do something that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian listen this is life in the open this is an accountable life this is I don't do anything on my own in my own home privately anything I represent the body of Christ and I want I have a fear of God that I don't want to do anything privately that would affect my testimony to the rest of this world and to the congregation you're not an island young person you're not to yourself you don't say I do my own thing Christians don't do their own thing we're accountable to the Holy Ghost into his body we are part of his body now you can go live a life that's not accountable to that but if God's got your number you're going to come back to it because you didn't see it as love but this is his love that he's given you in protection someday you're coming back you'll come harder you come easy but you're going to come back I'm going to raise your hand and says of those in the congregation I've come back I came back I had to learn this lesson the hard way raise your hand I had to learn this lesson the hard way young people look at look at this I had to learn this principle the hard way but how many keep your hand raised say God's grace brought me back God's grace forgave me look at that look at that jumpers God forgave them and brought them back but they had to go the hard way to learn the lesson you don't have to do that you can follow it now you can have the fear of the Lord I fear the people I fear the city I fear the God's servants unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian every day that I live in the grocery stores and wherever I'm at you are manifesting the testimony of Jesus see you've got before you can have respects you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respects God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respects last one it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife a man for the vows here is untep until death do us part that's how we should keep it and when you take and you take that vow before God that only death will separate you and think we and I think we should a man in his right mind that's planning a future that he should choose that wife very careful be careful what you're doing and a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's doing and especially in these days a man should think and pray so that's why I say do we have less teaching about it do we talk about it less no we should talk about it more parents should talk about it more with their kids preachers to preach on it more a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife not wish to bring a prayer across the parking lot first time you've seen her she's gorgeous and I'm going for it right now and you just whisper a quick Wing in a prayer God help me as I approach this sister it's not what he's talking about it's thinking it's praying it's taken some time you could ask the question Lord am I ready for the responsibility of leading a Christian home am I ready to be a Godly wife because sex will not be the answer to a union in marriage everybody has sex the world has sex all the time sorry parents for being so blunt but the devil's blunt you can have all of that you can go and have all every night you can go have all of it but there's no respect there's no commitment there's no honor none of it so that is not guaranteed a marriage it's all the other stuff woman choosing a husband accepting a choice so others should be real careful what she's doing especially in these days a man should think and pray before you choose his wife and I think today what's got so many divorce cases now that we lead the world in American divorce cases we leave the rest of the world there's more divorces than anywhere else this nation is supposed to be and thought of as a Christian Nation what a reproach our divorce courts I think the reason it is is because that men has got away from God and women has got away from God and we find that if a man prayed and prayed woman prayed over the matter not just look at a pretty set of eyes or big strong shoulders such as that or some other worldly affection but would look first to God and say God is this your plan and just before we got married I know what I had to ask her parents for her she said you'll have to ask Mother and Daddy and I thought oh I'm in for it again I said how about just asking your daddy you remember brother REM said he's in his life he said he didn't want to ask both of them but it was both of them man up you got to go with us daddy and mommy she's she's going through the channels and he was Larry so he made a deal you go to Mom tell him I'll go to Dad it's a little bit of the scare in young men to not man up and say oh boy I'm scared to do it don't ever be afraid of that if you're man enough to take on the girl you're man enough to go through God's authorities I was going to ask her daddy I was sitting there so nervous and that's that's the last of it praise the Lord God you can stand as I say these last things and hopefully our hearts are sober to the teaching of the word today hopefully there's a heart of repentance and those who need to go before the Lord maybe come to the altar this morning and speak to him about it speak to him about it in your seat but I want to say that God is calling a generation of young men and young women to strength in a week an adulterous generation he's calling young people to raise up and be strong he's calling for Purity in the middle of perversion he's calling for accountability in the middle of private sin he's calling for us to be truthful and have truth in the middle of lies he's calling for us to stand for the message in the middle of compromises of the message God is calling young men and young women to renew their strength to mount up with wings as an eagle to run and not be weary to walk and not faint that's the scripture Wednesday we read in Isaiah all of us have a place that we can renew our strength he said even the young man are getting fate and getting weary but the same promise for the adults as for the young says but they that wait upon the Lord young person do you know how to wait on the Lord I'm only 15. let me get off my back do you know how to weigh down the Lord because if you learn how to wait before the Lord and pursue the Lord you tap into the strength I'll get to that later brother no no right now in this service I'm taking to you 14 year olds 15 years 17 year olds 13 year olds right now do you know how to wait in the Lord because the Bible says if they will wait on the Lord I'll renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they so run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint there's a strength in the word of the Lord for this generation you feel free to come and pray if you want to come and pray his strength is perfect when our strength is gone he'll carry us when we can carry all raised in his power the weak [Music] become strong his strength is [Music] strength is [Music] strength is heard when our Hallelujah he'll carry us when we can carry on foreign [Applause] [Music] Just Close Your Eyes this morning and ask you to come to the altar of God if you need repentance older ones young ones no matter who it is I invite you to this altar to repent today his only repentance would be the door to come out of anything that's hidden or come out of something that's dishonorable to God only true genuine laying it before the Lord can he come with his Holiness and Purge out that which is wrong I invite you to that this morning I invite you to speak to the Lord only true repentance is the answer out I'm going to pray for you this morning you pray for me I'll pray for you that these things would become real to us that we see a generation raising up in the middle of Satan's Eden that would be strong in principles strong in convictions strong when we are weak strong to to let God invade our private lives that God invade our our phones and let God invade what we're feeding on let him be the Lord Of Our Lives let him be the Lord of what we're looking at taking it to the filter of God's word everything through the filter of God's word everything through God's Authority I pray you'll do that this morning I know it's a sobering message but I speak from my heart there has to be true genuine repentance before God I'm wrong Lord you're right God forgive me help me the father in my life to be a dedicated believer towards you and filled with the spirit if you don't have the Holy Spirit this morning call out to him say God I need it with all my heart I need the strength of the holy spirit in my life guiding my life giving me those strong responses like Tamar had that day oh God I go to you now and intercede in supplication for these people and those that are listening online Lord I pray for their souls that are spirits their hearts that you would purge them Lord of any kind of sneakiness or any kind of or going around today we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty we renounce the mind that would try to be taken by Satan that Lord we could give our hearts and lives and Minds to you holy that Lord it would be holy unto you father a response back to you Lord that says we're serious we're not playing church but we're serious about our walk with you every day that we represent Jesus Christ that we represent this message and I want to send the best message to this world that we believe it with all our hearts and my actions always match what I Proclaim if I Proclaim it in church then my actions match what I Proclaim my God help me today and I know Lord I'll be battled by demons Lord for saying these things I know Satan's not happy but God give me strength in the Lord I pray for your strength is perfect father we pray that people of God would open their hearts to you father that you'd break down the barriers the walls the the the insensitivity to you Lord break it down I don't know how but Lord love the people into your way I pray in Jesus name forgive me if I've said anything Lord offense them to your spirit I fear you I fear the people I fear how I present it Lord I respect it father come Lord Jesus I pray in your precious Name
