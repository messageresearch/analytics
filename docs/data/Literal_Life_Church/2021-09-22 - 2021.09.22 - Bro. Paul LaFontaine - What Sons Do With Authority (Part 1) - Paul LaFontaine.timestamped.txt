[0:00] other tonight and uh we're gonna start
[0:01] at verse 51
[0:05] and i think that
[0:07] yes
[0:10] yeah this is the one all right luke 9 or
[0:12] verse 51. everybody have it i think
[0:15] everybody has it before i have it
[0:17] and it came to pass when the time was
[0:19] come that he should be received up he
[0:21] steadfastly set his face to go to
[0:23] jerusalem and sent messengers before his
[0:26] face
[0:27] and they went and entered into a village
[0:29] of samaritans to make ready for him
[0:32] and they did not receive him because his
[0:34] face was as though he would go to
[0:36] jerusalem and when his disciples james
[0:39] and john saw this
[0:41] they said lord wilt thou that we command
[0:43] fire
[0:44] to come down from heaven and just
[0:46] consume them even as elias did
[0:50] but he turned and rebuked to james and
[0:52] john and said you know not what manner
[0:54] of spirits you are of for the son of man
[0:57] is not come to destroy men's life
[1:00] but to save them
[1:02] and they went into another village amen
[1:04] may god bless the reading of his word
[1:06] tonight god bless you may be seated i
[1:08] want to speak a little bit tonight on
[1:09] what sons do
[1:11] with authority
[1:13] and
[1:15] clearly these guys here these these
[1:17] brothers will call them but they're
[1:19] certainly
[1:20] not fully acting right here james and
[1:22] john
[1:23] clearly these guys are
[1:25] not ready
[1:26] to handle
[1:27] the authority of god
[1:30] and
[1:31] and yet they're with jesus they're
[1:33] disciples of jesus they're around the
[1:35] message they're around the son of man
[1:38] they've been around him for several
[1:39] years now
[1:40] but they are clearly and they are sons
[1:43] can you say amen they're sons of god
[1:45] have all the potential sons of god have
[1:48] all the access to all that they will be
[1:51] become but in this incident they prove
[1:54] that they're clearly not ready to handle
[1:56] the authority of god the right way
[2:00] but they are sons can you say man
[2:03] and the positive thing that i can say
[2:06] tonight is that we can go ahead and read
[2:09] at the end of our bible we can read the
[2:11] book of james and we can read the book
[2:13] of john
[2:14] they actually must god must have really
[2:16] worked on them because they were allowed
[2:18] to write a book that's in the bible can
[2:20] you say man so that's that's the thing
[2:23] of sons you know it's just like we we
[2:25] have our struggles and god has to teach
[2:27] us and child train us and we're not
[2:30] ready for certain things and we go
[2:32] through all kinds of stuff but the
[2:34] positive thing is we can look ahead now
[2:36] and we can read in our bibles
[2:38] men who acted that way but they wrote
[2:41] some wonderful things in the book of
[2:42] james and incidentally this guy that
[2:45] wanted to call fire down from heaven and
[2:47] consume the whole thing like elijah john
[2:50] if you read the book of john he's all
[2:52] about brothers let us love one another
[2:56] something happened to john
[2:58] some change took place in john
[3:01] some the immaturity that john had god
[3:04] dealt with the immaturity and he was
[3:06] able to write
[3:07] better than anybody in the scripture
[3:09] about the love of god
[3:11] so i want to speak tonight just a little
[3:13] bit on what sons will do with
[3:15] authorities what sons do with authority
[3:17] and there have been several days in
[3:19] study
[3:20] uh
[3:21] for the men's meeting
[3:22] and uh we're speaking in this uh
[3:25] speaking in the setting of the men's
[3:26] meeting is a privilege it's i feel
[3:28] honored to do it in some ways i don't
[3:30] want to do it i'd rather go listen to
[3:31] the good things of god but in speaking
[3:33] for it it's a real privilege we have
[3:35] just hundreds of men there that come and
[3:38] you can speak on the subjects uh related
[3:40] to men and what's been in our hearts is
[3:43] authority the subject of authority and
[3:46] there are many elements to authority
[3:48] but tonight i just thought i'd taken a
[3:50] segment of it that we'll speak on this
[3:52] weekend a little bit just a little
[3:54] portion of it but there are many things
[3:56] to talk about in relation to authority
[3:59] the bible's full of it our subjection to
[4:01] authority our subjection to god's
[4:03] headship our obedience to delegated
[4:06] authority because god delegates his
[4:08] authority his authority to certain men
[4:10] and so when you subject yourself and uh
[4:13] be obedient to god's men you're not
[4:16] being obedient to the man it's not about
[4:18] the man but god's authority in the man
[4:21] and you know about that and then there's
[4:22] a whole thing we'll talk a little bit
[4:24] about tonight that that is the authority
[4:26] that we have brother graham says the
[4:28] church doesn't realize the authority but
[4:30] god has given the church the authority
[4:32] all the way from pentecost can you say
[4:34] amen and you shall receive power after
[4:37] which the holy ghost has come upon you
[4:39] and so he gave
[4:40] peter the keys to the kingdom
[4:43] so god is handing it and all of this
[4:45] handing of authority to sons we know
[4:48] that it climaxes at the end time because
[4:50] we find the final move of god in this
[4:54] last day
[4:55] is actually to give back to sons
[4:58] all of the inheritance and all of the
[5:00] position that they fell from in the
[5:03] garden of eden
[5:05] this last climatic uh portion of the
[5:08] word that we're in we've had a lot of
[5:10] good days we've had pentecost we have
[5:13] seven church ages we've had a move of
[5:15] god we've had healing signs wonders we
[5:18] have we still have that happening but
[5:20] the final climatic time that god is
[5:22] doing is to hand back the full
[5:25] inheritance to you as sons and daughters
[5:28] of god the book of redemption held our
[5:30] inheritance he took the seals off it he
[5:33] threw it down to earth to his prophet
[5:35] that was on earth he spoke it but that
[5:37] wasn't the last thing he did he spoke it
[5:40] so the sons of god could take that book
[5:43] back again
[5:45] that's the hour you live in
[5:47] this is the time that we live in can you
[5:49] say amen he's putting his life and his
[5:52] authority back in his sons and daughters
[5:55] again it's pretty exciting
[5:58] i said it's pretty exciting
[6:00] the work that's going on every day in
[6:02] your lives it's pretty exciting the work
[6:04] that's going on you always look at the
[6:06] other guy said man it seems like they're
[6:08] all excited and things are going good
[6:09] for them it's pretty exciting the work
[6:11] that's going on in your life
[6:13] and you may go through stubborn times
[6:15] but if your son you're going to come out
[6:17] of that and the overall work that's
[6:19] going on is god's giving you back your
[6:21] authority god's given you back your
[6:24] inheritance that you lost in the garden
[6:27] pretty exciting work that's going on
[6:28] every time we gather together have
[6:30] church
[6:32] it's pretty exciting what's happening on
[6:33] wednesday nights like this
[6:35] it's pretty exciting you think this is a
[6:37] regular service this is not a regular
[6:39] there is no regular services when god's
[6:42] handing back his inheritance to his
[6:44] people
[6:45] you as sons you as daughters
[6:47] there is no boring service there is no
[6:50] in between filler services
[6:53] every time we meet every time we open
[6:55] the bible every time we get in the
[6:57] message every time we commune with him
[7:00] god is handing his book of redemption
[7:02] back to the people
[7:05] it's pretty exciting i don't know what
[7:07] you feel about yourself tonight but it
[7:08] doesn't matter how you feel about
[7:10] yourself it's what the word said about
[7:12] you
[7:14] if you still this see this thing is just
[7:17] a little movement that just follows the
[7:19] teachings of william branham
[7:21] you need your eyes open
[7:24] because that's that's
[7:26] that's not what this is
[7:29] a little movement that follows the
[7:30] teachings of william branham that's not
[7:32] whether you need your eyes open you need
[7:34] to know he's bringing sons to glory
[7:38] he's giving back authority
[7:41] he broke off the seals he handed the pro
[7:44] handed him to the prophet on earth a
[7:45] book in order to give the book back to
[7:48] his sons in the end time and that's
[7:50] exactly what he's doing and when he
[7:52] gives that back it's the same as christ
[7:54] was when he said i put my life and i put
[7:57] my authority he said it in john chapter
[7:59] 5 i put my life all my life is in my son
[8:03] and then the next is and all of my
[8:05] authority is in my son
[8:08] and he didn't just do it with jesus
[8:10] christ
[8:11] jesus christ was the firstborn of men
[8:13] among many brethren
[8:16] he didn't just give the authority but to
[8:18] jesus christ but he gives it back to all
[8:20] of his sons
[8:23] it climax at the end where he brings it
[8:25] so so as
[8:27] as he proclaims and the prophet comes to
[8:30] this in christ the mystery especially
[8:32] that message he begins to proclaim in
[8:34] christ the mystery that the headship is
[8:37] coming down and when you talk about
[8:38] headship you talk about authority you
[8:40] talk about the head and we know we've
[8:42] had heads we've had corporations we have
[8:44] had denominational heads we've had all
[8:46] kinds of man's type of headship and
[8:48] authority that rules but in this this is
[8:51] the hit this is the true head this is
[8:53] christ's the head descending and coming
[8:56] to his body and that's what's happening
[8:58] with the seals revealed is christ the
[9:00] mystery of god revealed he
[9:03] the head comes down to unite with the
[9:06] body
[9:08] if the threefold purpose of god that he
[9:10] would reveal himself to man number one
[9:13] and i only go back to qualify these
[9:15] things because there's some new ones who
[9:16] don't know this in christ the mystery
[9:19] god had a threefold purpose
[9:21] in all of the bible you see this is the
[9:23] entire purpose of god all of the all of
[9:26] the parables all of the stories in the
[9:28] old testament that you heard in sunday
[9:30] school all of the bible speaks of a
[9:32] threefold purpose of god that he would
[9:34] reveal himself to man number one that he
[9:36] would get the preeminence in his people
[9:39] number two and then he would take them
[9:41] back to eden again as sons and daughters
[9:43] adam and eve back again
[9:46] the book of the book of redemption it's
[9:48] a it's a work of redemption so you know
[9:51] to have the preeminence that's the thing
[9:53] and so sons
[9:55] are glad
[9:57] to come under this true headship
[9:59] sons are glad to do it now that's when
[10:01] you have good leadership and good
[10:03] authority
[10:04] is when
[10:05] people are glad to come underneath it
[10:10] when you have the wrong type of
[10:11] authority people are hesitant even
[10:13] though they're forced to come underneath
[10:15] it
[10:16] there's nothing better than have a
[10:18] compliant child
[10:20] and i know some of you haven't had them
[10:22] all mine were perfect but none some of
[10:24] yours had problems
[10:26] all mine were perfectly compliant
[10:29] and everybody's laughing
[10:32] but
[10:33] you know there's a scripture in proverbs
[10:35] it's wonderful it talks about the
[10:37] the vision and he says
[10:40] when a father corrects his son happy is
[10:42] he and he's it's like i'm reading him
[10:44] going where does that come from when he
[10:47] corrects the son happy is he that's the
[10:48] response you get but when when things
[10:51] are right and there's a reverence for
[10:53] the right kind of leadership and
[10:54] authority then there's a response that's
[10:57] a correct subjection
[11:00] because it's not forced and so you can
[11:02] see how important so now when this
[11:03] headship comes of christ we have no
[11:06] problem seeing that this is the who true
[11:08] headship we've been looking for so the
[11:10] sons of god are happy the daughters of
[11:12] god are happy to come under that true
[11:14] headship and to blend with that but it's
[11:16] not a headship like the world where it's
[11:19] just the subjects you're just subjects
[11:22] and you're nothing more you just obey
[11:24] and the authority has
[11:26] his thumb on you that's not the
[11:28] authority of god
[11:30] that you're detached as a subject
[11:33] and you're under the authority of the
[11:35] land a dictatorship
[11:37] and you just subject yourself and you
[11:39] have no part in it that's not the
[11:41] authority of god this headship comes and
[11:45] becomes one with the body can you say
[11:48] amen and so becomes one that every bit
[11:51] of the life and authority
[11:53] comes down and is in the subjects can
[11:56] you say a man the same authority comes
[11:59] and make causes us to have authority to
[12:03] rule and reign
[12:05] so
[12:06] uh this is not in the quotes i sent you
[12:08] guys but this is quickly what he says in
[12:10] christ the mystery now you might have it
[12:12] there then we are united under one
[12:14] vindicated headship
[12:16] that is christ the word
[12:19] not under any church then our headship
[12:22] now notice i just i just pulled
[12:25] something out because i can't read all
[12:26] the quotes i want to we are united under
[12:29] one vindicated headship and that is
[12:31] christ the word 1963 after the seals are
[12:34] preached our are full the word has come
[12:36] christ has come and we're coming under
[12:39] no we're not on any any church listen to
[12:42] this now then our headship is a kingdom
[12:46] that's the first thing that i read and
[12:48] said this is not like the authority and
[12:50] headship of the world our headship is a
[12:53] kingdom
[12:55] the kingdom of god is within you
[12:59] said the bible jesus the kingdom we are
[13:02] not a denomination not even
[13:04] denominational churches that have a
[13:06] headship in christianity reflect the
[13:10] true headship that god intended
[13:12] if you're a denominational here tonight
[13:14] i'm not speaking against you i'm telling
[13:16] you the entire denominational headship
[13:19] system that started with the mother
[13:21] church and continues today is completely
[13:24] contrary to the word of god and true
[13:26] headship
[13:27] our headship is christ the word
[13:31] and we find then an organized religion
[13:33] and organized systems build a headship
[13:36] well we see we are not a denomination we
[13:39] belong to a kingdom
[13:41] and the kingdom is the word of god made
[13:44] spirit and life in our own life
[13:50] he's talking about headship he's talking
[13:51] about authority he's talking about the
[13:53] head coming down and he's saying it's a
[13:55] kingdom and he says you know what it
[13:57] does the spirit and life of the king
[14:00] come into the queen and this kingdom
[14:02] lives out in your own life
[14:06] what kind of headship is this what kind
[14:07] of authority is this that we're under
[14:09] what kind of umbrella and by the way
[14:11] being under his authority is the
[14:13] greatest protection for you and your
[14:14] family you can have can i get an amen
[14:18] this authority is the greatest
[14:19] protection and safety place that you can
[14:22] have for you and your family it is an
[14:24] umbrella of the ultimate protection in
[14:27] this hour
[14:28] god's authority is not a dictatorship
[14:32] it's a protection
[14:34] but it's also a kingdom
[14:36] that the word of god made spirit and
[14:38] life in our own life bringing to pass
[14:40] every promise in the day as it did in
[14:42] the day when the word and god was one
[14:43] he's pointing back to jesus the word
[14:45] becoming one with god they were one i
[14:48] and my father are one as it did in the
[14:50] day when they become one this is the
[14:52] same thing that happens under this
[14:53] headship the body
[14:55] unites with the head coming down and
[14:57] they become one and now it feeds into
[15:00] that body sons and daughters
[15:02] every bit of life and every bit of
[15:04] authority that god has begins to flow
[15:06] through the queen
[15:10] we have his authority tonight
[15:14] you hold his authority
[15:18] sometimes we don't recognize what we
[15:19] have
[15:21] so in in um
[15:23] in my studying this now
[15:26] i have found
[15:28] i found many things but i found
[15:29] something i wanted to bring up tonight
[15:33] god
[15:35] puts this
[15:37] in his sons
[15:39] when they don't even have the maturity
[15:41] yet
[15:43] to use it right
[15:47] that's amazing thing to me because
[15:49] things don't normally work that way
[15:52] god doesn't say he don't wait and say
[15:54] when you're perfect
[15:56] when you're fully matured
[15:58] then i'll pour my life and my authority
[16:01] into you
[16:02] but it didn't happen that way with jesus
[16:05] and it doesn't happen that way with sons
[16:07] of god i'm one that believes that we
[16:09] receive the spirit of adoption and that
[16:12] spirit takes us to full mature adoption
[16:15] you won't hear that from all the
[16:16] ministers but that's just the way i
[16:18] believe it because the whole subject of
[16:19] adoption means growth to maturity can
[16:22] you say amen
[16:23] and so you receive the spirit of
[16:25] adoption you have all the potentials
[16:28] through the holy ghost to become a fully
[16:31] matured son
[16:32] raptured can you say amen but at the
[16:35] moment of birth you have the potential
[16:37] of it but you're not that yet
[16:40] so now comes this child training
[16:42] might take five years
[16:44] might take two years
[16:48] some of us went on to be with the lord
[16:50] some of the people went on to be the
[16:51] lord they got their victory in divine
[16:53] love a lot sooner and we thought god
[16:55] took them god that's it you won the
[16:56] victory in divine love he took them
[17:00] for the rest of us we're not done yet
[17:02] we're still here
[17:04] that means you still need some work on
[17:06] you
[17:08] you're still here
[17:10] so it's best you just come to the altar
[17:12] and say lord here i am
[17:14] finish your work in me
[17:17] because i want to get out of here
[17:19] amen
[17:20] so
[17:21] he don't say when you are perfect then
[17:23] you i will put this into you now no he
[17:26] says
[17:27] john says now are we the sons of god
[17:31] and it does not appear what we shall be
[17:33] but when he shall appear we shall appear
[17:36] with him in glory
[17:38] so
[17:40] these things that that's why we're able
[17:42] to see this great thing
[17:44] this headship come to us
[17:46] but also
[17:48] as we see this great thing has come to
[17:50] us and i'm naming you know in the 60s
[17:53] 1963 i'm naming years because
[17:56] we see the unfolding of spiritual
[17:58] prophecy the prophecy in revelations how
[18:00] it all transpired how he would look open
[18:03] the lamb's book of life
[18:05] through the vessel that he would begin
[18:06] to do it and just these different things
[18:08] that's all history now and that points
[18:11] to revelations 10 1 the mighty angel
[18:14] coming down our great head christ
[18:16] descending the word the lion whatever
[18:19] you want to call it he's now come down
[18:21] to become one with his people the
[18:23] capstone uniting with the rest of the
[18:25] body
[18:27] and all this begins to happen this great
[18:29] thing comes to us
[18:31] but also we watch in the years since
[18:33] it's come great immaturity in using his
[18:37] authority
[18:39] the wrong way
[18:41] can i get an amen
[18:44] here it comes to us
[18:45] and we've had to observe not only in our
[18:47] own lives but in preachers lives and
[18:50] many different facets within our ranks
[18:53] great immaturity in handling this word
[18:59] great immaturity in handling the
[19:01] authority of this word
[19:04] and people
[19:06] using the sword on one another
[19:09] instead of the devil
[19:12] and people like james and john who says
[19:14] we've got the authority
[19:16] let's call fire down from heaven and
[19:19] burn them all up
[19:22] well there's a real christ-like spirit
[19:24] on you boy
[19:27] i'm being sarcastic because jesus
[19:28] themselves are boys boys
[19:30] you don't even know what kind of spirit
[19:32] you have on your way now
[19:34] it's
[19:35] terrible
[19:37] let the authority come down and just
[19:39] burn them all out like elijah let's have
[19:41] the authority of elijah and that's it's
[19:43] all sons but immature not ready to use
[19:47] the authority of god
[19:49] everybody with me
[19:52] so we watch years now and i can be
[19:54] honest tonight just my home church but
[19:57] we watch years of this immaturity
[19:59] but you see then that
[20:01] that even jesus even jesus who was the
[20:05] perfect son of god when he was in this
[20:07] days of the flesh the bible says
[20:10] jesus learned
[20:12] obedience
[20:14] by the things he suffered
[20:16] so even jesus himself with the full
[20:20] authority and life of god
[20:22] had to go through a process
[20:25] of learning if jesus the perfect son of
[20:29] god
[20:30] had to go through a maturing or a
[20:32] learning process then certainly we do
[20:35] here tonight
[20:38] in order to not have it's not about
[20:40] having authority in order to use the
[20:42] authority in the channel that god wants
[20:45] it used
[20:47] in order to use it the right way can you
[20:49] say amen
[20:50] and uh brother branham referred to it
[20:52] this way and you don't have this quote
[20:54] up there but brother brown referred to
[20:55] he says could you imagine
[20:58] this
[20:59] building here being energized tonight
[21:01] for light by electricity
[21:05] so this is so this we have power in here
[21:07] tonight
[21:08] and uh we have a power source
[21:11] that brings in
[21:13] but the power source
[21:15] has been made that it can get to these
[21:17] lights and bring light
[21:19] now that was a process can you say man
[21:22] that took a process and so brother brown
[21:25] comments and i just want to use it the
[21:26] way he says it
[21:27] electricity is an unseen force you can't
[21:31] see the power behind it you can't see
[21:33] the authority behind it
[21:35] when it's harnessed and brought on
[21:38] he said i like this when benjamin
[21:40] franklin first found it he screamed and
[21:43] said i've got it i've got it
[21:46] but brother bram says but he didn't know
[21:48] what he had
[21:53] praise the lord
[21:54] and
[21:55] and i'm bringing this to show you
[21:57] god can bring his authority to his
[21:59] people and they're they're they're
[22:01] shouting saying we've got it we've got
[22:03] it i wonder how many message conventions
[22:05] through the years where people have
[22:07] shouted we've got it we've got it we've
[22:09] got it but they don't really know what
[22:11] they have yet and they certainly don't
[22:13] know what channel to put it in
[22:15] for god to use it effectively
[22:19] i mean it's not a thing wrong with
[22:20] shouting and rejoicing what god has
[22:22] given us and the authority that we have
[22:25] it's kind of like i was talking to this
[22:26] with my boys last night it's kind of
[22:28] like when brother brown says don't live
[22:31] don't shout any higher don't jump any
[22:33] higher than the way you live
[22:35] shout all you want to dance all you want
[22:37] to get excited stimulated by the word of
[22:40] god but if you're not living the life
[22:43] it doesn't matter how high you shout
[22:45] doesn't matter how high you dance and he
[22:47] says you pentecostals he said he said i
[22:50] love it he says i have nothing against
[22:51] it but he says you see him to take all
[22:54] of this and you just blow the steam out
[22:56] in one service you just blow it all out
[22:58] but he said if you could ever harness
[23:00] that and get that power of the holy
[23:02] ghost channeled into a sanctified life
[23:05] channeled into a life every day so that
[23:07] you may shout on sunday but on monday
[23:10] you know how to take the sword to the
[23:12] enemy
[23:14] that's the problem we have with a great
[23:16] emotional workup is that people don't
[23:18] know how to go against the enemy when
[23:19] they're on temptation on monday morning
[23:23] so he says benjamin franklin he says
[23:26] screamed and said i've got it i've got
[23:28] it but he didn't know what he had he had
[23:30] something but he didn't know what he had
[23:32] but along came edison
[23:34] and edison took it and put it to work
[23:38] notice that transition i don't even know
[23:40] the history i didn't have time to read
[23:41] it today but i'm intrigued i'll read it
[23:43] i'll get my book out and read you know
[23:45] how did this transpire i don't know how
[23:47] many years it was past one saying i've
[23:49] got something here i've got it i got it
[23:51] i don't really know what i have i don't
[23:53] have it harnessed yet but another one
[23:55] comes along and he harnesses it
[23:58] he puts it in a certain channel
[24:02] man did it ever become effective because
[24:04] all of us
[24:05] live on it the last week when we lost
[24:07] ours for 12 or 15 hours boy this boy
[24:11] felt not
[24:12] this boy felt it not having power for my
[24:14] refrigerators and
[24:16] uh boy i tell you we depend on it a lot
[24:20] right
[24:21] it's because somebody some somebody
[24:24] harnessed the power or else the power
[24:26] would just been there
[24:28] but somebody harnessed it so we can flip
[24:30] a switch on
[24:31] actually do it from our phones now
[24:33] my wife can control the temperature at
[24:35] our rental property on her phone
[24:38] so so somebody's harnessed this power
[24:42] it's a natural type of the spiritual you
[24:44] can't just say i've got the holy ghost
[24:47] let me see it how it's channeled in your
[24:49] life against the enemy
[24:52] let me see it how it makes you love your
[24:54] brother let me see how it continues to
[24:56] sanctify your life can i get an amen
[24:58] tonight you can't just say i got it i
[25:00] got it i got it and shout and sing sing
[25:02] i've got it
[25:04] i've got it there's something about the
[25:06] power of the holy ghost and i've got it
[25:08] i can't explain it but i've got it
[25:11] that's great praise the lord but what
[25:13] you've got you've got to take harness
[25:16] and channel it into an overcoming life
[25:21] praise be to god amen can you say amen
[25:25] so
[25:26] we have something god the headship comes
[25:29] down
[25:30] but
[25:33] you can have it but it's not channel
[25:35] right it's not harness
[25:37] and if it's not harnessed right it's
[25:38] misused
[25:40] as james and john had authority but had
[25:43] not learned
[25:44] what to use the authority for
[25:47] they personally were not harnessed yet
[25:51] that's what we find when
[25:54] brother branham preached the message
[25:55] paul a prisoner
[25:57] how many remember that message
[25:59] you know there are some messages of
[26:01] brother branham that are not doctrinal
[26:03] messages
[26:06] there's some that are doctrinal there's
[26:08] some that are
[26:09] revealing of truth
[26:11] especially after the seals opened there
[26:13] was a bursting forth of restored truth
[26:15] and truths that we had lost and truth
[26:17] some ways we didn't even know that we're
[26:19] laying in the bible and it just bursts
[26:21] and so he goes there christ the mystery
[26:23] god revealed anointed ones at the end
[26:25] time we didn't know we didn't know that
[26:27] the scripture proclaimed that the rain
[26:29] falls on the just and then just and that
[26:31] someone could be anointed by the genuine
[26:33] holy ghost and be a false vessel
[26:37] so god had to reveal these things and he
[26:39] goes and he's into satan's eden and he's
[26:42] in the god of this evil age these are
[26:44] doctrinal biblical things that the bride
[26:47] the sons of god needed to know can you
[26:50] say amen but not all the messages after
[26:52] the seals are doctrinal sermons
[26:55] some of them i believe
[26:57] are teaching sons the channel that we
[27:01] put our lives in
[27:02] to see this authority work in our lives
[27:04] and paul a prisoner is one of them
[27:06] because that's when he used the word
[27:08] harnessed paul was a prisoner and paul
[27:10] was harnessed to what
[27:12] the will of god in other words it was
[27:15] about god's will and it was it was about
[27:18] denying paul denying his own will and
[27:22] all paul denying the will of other men
[27:26] and that we didn't know it but we become
[27:29] free in jesus christ
[27:31] but to use the authority of god
[27:33] and all this message has given us
[27:36] we
[27:37] become prisoners
[27:40] to our own will
[27:42] prisoners to the will of other people
[27:44] prisoners harnessed
[27:46] bound in chains of love he said that's
[27:48] right
[27:49] i said god
[27:51] i am i'm given my life and you become
[27:54] that's why he said that electricity
[27:55] electricity becomes harnessed
[27:57] the vessels of god become harnessed they
[27:59] become into a channel they become
[28:02] and you don't need to look any further
[28:04] than jesus christ himself in john
[28:06] chapter 5 when it says jesus christ
[28:08] after he said he put the life and the
[28:10] authority into jesus i have put it in my
[28:12] son then we find can i read it a minute
[28:15] can i i'm i'm
[28:17] i don't want to just quote it
[28:20] john chapter 5.
[28:23] look at this
[28:25] verse 25. verily realize saying to you
[28:28] the hour is coming
[28:33] and now is when the dead shall hear the
[28:34] voice of the son of god and they shall
[28:35] hear his voice for as the father hath
[28:38] life in himself so hath he given to his
[28:40] son to have life in himself and hath
[28:42] given him authority to execute judgment
[28:44] also because he is the son of man marvel
[28:47] nodded this
[28:48] for the hour is coming in the which that
[28:50] all that are in the grave shall hear his
[28:51] voice and shall come forth and they that
[28:54] have done good unto the resurrection of
[28:55] the life and they have done evil under
[28:57] the resurrection of damnation verse 30.
[28:59] this is what jesus is talking now here's
[29:01] now here's the vessel that
[29:03] god said i've put my life in him and
[29:05] i've put all my authority in him and
[29:07] here's what the vessel says
[29:10] i can of my own self
[29:13] do nothing
[29:19] as i hear
[29:21] i judge and my judgment is just in other
[29:24] words i don't issue a discernment or a
[29:26] judgment call on my own
[29:28] i'm listening for the voice of the
[29:30] father to make judgment calls
[29:33] my decisions are so rooted in this voice
[29:37] and this father behind me is that i
[29:39] don't want to act i do nothing except
[29:42] the father show with me
[29:46] you know what you see there
[29:47] humility
[29:50] so now we see a vessel of character
[29:53] that matches
[29:54] this power that he's going to receive
[29:56] anybody listening tonight i won't be
[29:58] long so give me enough amen's here we'll
[30:00] wrap it up
[30:01] we have a character that matches the
[30:04] authority that he's going to hold
[30:06] and that character says i can do nothing
[30:08] of myself nothing as i hear i judge and
[30:10] my judgment is just because because i
[30:13] seek not my own will but the will of the
[30:16] father which sent me that's the vessel
[30:20] that god needs to exercise the authority
[30:24] of god
[30:26] he says the same thing over in
[30:29] in
[30:30] i believe it's hebrews where he says he
[30:32] says think it not god
[30:35] he thought it not robbery
[30:37] let this mind be in you philippians let
[30:39] this mind be in you which was also in
[30:41] christ jesus
[30:43] let this mind be in you
[30:47] who thought it not robbery jesus
[30:50] to be equal with god
[30:55] he it didn't he he had confidence in his
[30:58] position that he thought it not robbery
[31:00] to be equal with god he knew god had
[31:03] poured all of his life and authority
[31:05] into his vessel but here it is here's
[31:07] the balance now he said he thought it
[31:10] not robbery to be equal with god and yet
[31:13] made himself of no reputation
[31:16] humbling himself even unto the death of
[31:19] the cross
[31:21] if you do not have that mixture
[31:26] then you can't use the authority of god
[31:29] like god
[31:30] wants you to use it
[31:41] so paul a prisoner is not a doctrinal
[31:43] message like many others
[31:45] humble thyself
[31:47] he cares do you care
[31:49] i don't see him as doctrinal sermons i
[31:51] see it as a lot of those things as
[31:54] teaching sons
[31:55] the channel god in simplicity is the
[31:58] channel to come into the seals
[32:01] there's only one channel and there's one
[32:03] attitude in frame of mind and that's
[32:05] humility you say don't try to figure all
[32:07] this out with your head don't try to
[32:08] make something out of these seven seals
[32:10] come into it through the channel of
[32:12] humility and simplicity and don't be
[32:14] looking for something big look for god
[32:17] being hidden in simplicity
[32:20] that's the channel you got to come
[32:21] through and people you know ministers
[32:24] skipped over skipped over god in
[32:26] simplicity and jumped right to what was
[32:29] being revealed and if you do you miss
[32:31] the humility that you need to realize
[32:33] god we reveal himself in simplicity
[32:37] every time
[32:40] amen
[32:43] they skipped over it there's some things
[32:44] that you skip over like brother
[32:46] uh ben said sunday i was really
[32:48] convicted
[32:50] he read the quote
[32:52] he said worry has no virtue he said
[32:55] skip worry
[32:56] and go right to faith
[32:58] boy i got something from the lord on
[33:00] that i didn't know that i could just
[33:02] skip that part skip the worry
[33:05] and jump right to the faith
[33:07] so i'm going to try to live that better
[33:09] here's the worry that's the direction i
[33:11] go down most of the time but just skip
[33:14] the worry
[33:16] brilliant
[33:18] i can just skip it
[33:21] skip days of losing sleep skip days of
[33:24] worrying about something you can't get
[33:26] you can't get to the bottom of it just
[33:27] skip worry
[33:29] and go right to the faith
[33:33] amen
[33:34] oh that wasn't in my sermon but i sure
[33:36] had a good time saying it again
[33:40] so
[33:42] we got this these services and this
[33:45] message
[33:46] with glorious restored truths and
[33:48] especially after the seals those truths
[33:51] are teaching sons and opening their eyes
[33:53] so that they won't be deceived it's
[33:55] wonderful but other messages are
[33:57] teaching sons christ the mystery of god
[33:59] revealed christ is him christ coming
[34:01] back to the church and paul a prisoner
[34:04] is how he harnessed sons to his will
[34:06] to use the authority the right way the
[34:08] next quote i want to get to and i'm
[34:09] moving along here the original seed
[34:11] spoken words original seed and he's said
[34:14] at that part where he says pick up your
[34:15] pen and write this what god gives them
[34:17] they the bride will love him love his
[34:19] and will have his potentials
[34:22] you have that one sis
[34:23] they will love him and they will have
[34:25] his potentials for he is their head and
[34:28] they are his subject
[34:30] subject to his head the headship of
[34:32] christ was his notice what harmony jesus
[34:36] never did anything until he seen the
[34:38] father the father showed him first
[34:40] harmony between god and christ see john
[34:42] 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her
[34:45] his word of life he shows her and she
[34:49] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[34:52] can harm her not even death for if the
[34:55] seed be planted the water will raise up
[34:57] again amen then i got a great big
[34:59] hallelujah on his notes pick up the pen
[35:01] and write i wrote down hallelujah here's
[35:03] the secret
[35:05] the word
[35:06] is in the bride
[35:08] and
[35:09] the mind of christ
[35:11] to know
[35:13] what he wants done
[35:15] with the word
[35:18] some of you missed that i might read it
[35:19] again
[35:20] here's the secret the word
[35:23] is in the bride how many believe that
[35:24] part
[35:26] and
[35:27] the mind of christ to know what he wants
[35:31] done with the word
[35:33] and she does it in his name
[35:36] she has thus saith the lord it's not
[35:38] that she says thus saith the lord or
[35:40] that she
[35:42] she speaks thus saith the lord and
[35:44] that's fine
[35:45] but it's it's not something you say as
[35:48] much as you have
[35:52] and i'm just going to say that about
[35:54] authority too and you brothers see
[35:56] authority plays out in your homes plays
[35:58] out in your marriages it plays out with
[36:00] your children every day we deal with
[36:02] authority
[36:03] do you know that
[36:05] every day authority is playing out in
[36:07] our lives but when you're looking at
[36:08] god's authority
[36:10] listen now
[36:12] uh
[36:16] she know he knows she knows what he
[36:17] wants done
[36:18] authority
[36:22] is not something brothers you have to
[36:24] defend
[36:27] it's something you have
[36:31] and i'm taking that from where he says
[36:33] she has thus saith the lord it's not
[36:35] that she
[36:36] boldly proclaims thus saith the lord or
[36:39] she speaks thus the lord or she knows
[36:41] all the quotes of thus saith the lord or
[36:43] she re-speaks it go ahead and re-speak
[36:45] it that's fine but it's not something
[36:47] you speak as much as something
[36:49] she has
[36:52] and it's the same with the authority of
[36:53] god
[36:54] it's not something that you have to
[36:56] defend it's not something you have to
[36:58] explain
[37:00] you either have it or you don't have it
[37:02] and if you have it you don't have to
[37:04] defend it
[37:08] the the the uh the uh pharisees and
[37:10] sadducees came to jesus and said
[37:14] by what authority do you do these things
[37:17] who can so it's
[37:19] here now it's the religious people
[37:22] that question
[37:24] the authority of the message
[37:28] the son of man
[37:31] well the other incident is where when
[37:32] they came and heard him speak they said
[37:35] this is different
[37:36] because when he speaks he speaks like
[37:40] one who has authority
[37:43] once again he has it he didn't get in
[37:45] there and say now i've got the authority
[37:47] of god friends and i'm getting ready to
[37:49] preach the word but just know i've got
[37:50] the other he never had to say that they
[37:52] sensed it
[37:54] glory be to god they knew it
[37:57] he speaks different than the pharisees
[37:59] and sadducees and guess what he was
[38:01] reading from the same scrolls he was
[38:04] reading from the same bible
[38:06] and somehow they sense he's different
[38:08] than the pharisees they're lacking
[38:10] something when he speaks it is there's
[38:13] an authority behind it and i don't
[38:15] believe it is how he was speaking into
[38:16] there he was speaking it bold
[38:18] isaiah said boy he speaks with such
[38:21] authority no no that's not it he has
[38:23] authority
[38:24] there's something they sent so when he
[38:26] was asked you know what jesus did when
[38:27] he was questioning it was the religious
[38:29] leaders that questioned his authority
[38:30] which it always is because they don't
[38:32] understand god's authority they don't
[38:34] understand god that god giving it to
[38:36] this simple man in front of them he
[38:37] didn't come through the religions he
[38:39] didn't come through teaching and yet
[38:41] where did you get your authority why do
[38:43] you have it where did it come from
[38:45] and jesus said
[38:47] well i get it from no he didn't answer
[38:49] the question
[38:50] he said i'll tell you if you'll answer
[38:52] my question
[38:55] and just stop i'm only you've heard that
[38:57] preach some i'm just making a point
[38:59] jesus did not ever have to explain
[39:03] his authority
[39:05] husbands
[39:12] mothers over children
[39:16] pastors
[39:20] and trouble comes in the church and
[39:22] they're scrounging for all the quotes to
[39:24] endorse the pastor's authority
[39:28] and take a series on it
[39:30] the pastor has full and complete
[39:32] authority of the church bless god
[39:36] and yet jesus here
[39:39] he don't have to answer where his
[39:41] authority comes from
[39:42] he has it and if you have it you've got
[39:44] the goods
[39:46] god will back you up
[39:48] oh somebody should be shouting amen
[39:53] so we asked him
[39:54] i forget the question it was about
[39:57] was john's baptism of god was it of men
[39:59] so he just caught them all and said no
[40:01] if we say this
[40:03] they're trying to reason with it and
[40:04] they take a few we said we can't answer
[40:06] that he said well i can't answer your
[40:08] question notice he had the answer to the
[40:11] devil's question
[40:13] brother brandt says the bride has the
[40:14] answer to the devil's question in christ
[40:16] the mystery
[40:17] but we don't necessarily have to say it
[40:19] but we have the answer to the devil's
[40:21] question
[40:22] we have it
[40:24] we may not always say it
[40:26] but we have it
[40:28] who gave this bride this authority who
[40:31] who who are you as a group of people who
[40:34] gave you such this
[40:37] i'll just have to let you watch and
[40:39] observe
[40:41] we'll see how all this ends up
[40:44] but i don't have to defend something
[40:46] that i didn't give myself
[40:49] god gave it to me
[40:51] it will defend itself can i say pray can
[40:53] you say praise the lord
[40:56] she has thus saith the lord if you guys
[40:58] bring it up on finishing she has thus
[40:59] saith the lord then it is germanized so
[41:02] the holy spirit waters it until it's
[41:03] grown and serves its purpose they do
[41:05] only his will amen i believe that no one
[41:08] can persuade them different they have
[41:10] thus saith the lord or they keep still
[41:16] praise the lord
[41:22] praise the lord
[41:24] let's um
[41:26] i think we'll just wrap it up and finish
[41:27] this next wednesday night anybody got
[41:29] time next wednesday night can you come
[41:31] out
[41:32] all right let's let's pick this up next
[41:34] wednesday night and and do that i don't
[41:36] if i get into the next section here
[41:37] it'll be
[41:38] quite a bit but i i want to take time on
[41:42] the amazing thing to me
[41:44] is to see all the authority that was
[41:46] placed in this prophet of the last days
[41:49] okay he has it he has life he has
[41:52] authority his ministry's going around
[41:54] the world and yet when i read it i find
[41:57] incident after incident where he as a
[42:00] son is personally being corrected how he
[42:03] handles the authority of god happened
[42:05] back in
[42:06] 1946-47 and he made a a judgment call
[42:09] one night to do the healing line a
[42:11] certain way
[42:12] and the angel didn't talk to him i think
[42:14] for six months and he found out it's
[42:16] because the angel said
[42:18] i'm behind i'm behind the ministry but i
[42:20] didn't tell you to do the healing line
[42:22] that way.
[42:25] and then incident after incident and
[42:27] even up to 63 when he says and
[42:29] humble thyself
[42:31] he says you know i
[42:32] i feel like i just need a little change
[42:34] in my life i just i'm going to go to
[42:36] prayer this is after the seals he's got
[42:38] all this authority he's done all these
[42:40] things in his position and yet and yet
[42:43] it's what i'm trying to get as a man
[42:45] he has to grow
[42:47] into the maturity
[42:49] of a son and daughter son of god
[42:52] and the work that he's doing is to take
[42:54] now the life and authority that you have
[42:55] within got the holy ghost tonight you
[42:57] have his life and authority within you
[43:00] but to take sons personally and deal
[43:02] with them i remember when i preached
[43:04] about jonah
[43:07] you know what that was all about
[43:08] god taken all of his attention off of
[43:10] nineveh and focusing on one son to get
[43:13] him straightened out
[43:16] god
[43:17] will leave all these things to focus on
[43:21] sons and daughters on a daily basis
[43:25] to get you where you need to be because
[43:27] you got a lot within you
[43:30] you got a lot within your saints
[43:34] so that's where we want to go and i hope
[43:37] i can share some of my personal
[43:39] testimony too
[43:40] because when i think of brother random's
[43:41] life then i think of my own life you
[43:43] probably think of your own in my journey
[43:45] here i'm still here i'm so i'm still
[43:47] believing this i'm still going on
[43:50] and i'm not perfect by any means but
[43:51] i'll tell you what i'm only perfect by
[43:53] the blood of jesus christ
[43:54] but as a man i can give testimonies
[43:58] of god correcting things in my life god
[44:00] correcting attitudes god correcting
[44:03] impatience god correct i said it last
[44:05] sunday god correcting my worrying too
[44:08] much
[44:09] and he's going to keep working on me and
[44:10] keep working on me because why i already
[44:13] have his authority in me
[44:15] but at this very moment if i don't have
[44:17] the character i can misuse his authority
[44:23] so let's end by saying this
[44:26] if esther is a type of the bride
[44:29] she rose didn't the brother speak on
[44:31] esther sunday night i think he did
[44:33] she rose to this place of authority next
[44:35] to the king he said what do you want up
[44:38] to the half of my kingdom
[44:40] the bride rises to this place she's got
[44:42] full
[44:43] authority the question is what did she
[44:45] do with that authority
[44:49] it's not a question that you have
[44:50] authority what do you do with it what
[44:52] did you do with it
[44:54] you know what esther did with it the
[44:56] first thing she did
[44:57] real quick and i'm closing
[45:01] she said
[45:02] why don't you and haman come over for a
[45:04] banquet to my house
[45:07] comes over she gets a little nervous so
[45:10] she's a human
[45:12] but she's holding this authority
[45:14] she has it
[45:17] invites him a second time but i think
[45:19] invites him third time i can't remember
[45:20] just now but finally she gets the
[45:22] courage with the authority of god
[45:25] to expose her enemy in the presence of
[45:29] the king
[45:35] hallelujah
[45:37] that's what you should use this
[45:38] authority to do
[45:42] don't use it on somebody else
[45:45] don't try to call fire down from heaven
[45:47] at the person who said something bad
[45:49] on facebook about you
[45:53] i want you to use it for the right thing
[45:56] and she used it
[45:58] to expose she used her authority to
[46:01] invite him in the present and to expose
[46:02] her enemy you have an enemy
[46:04] expose him
[46:07] you're bound by something privately
[46:09] expose it in the presence of the king
[46:11] why don't you use your authority and
[46:14] your sword
[46:16] against
[46:17] what's defeating you personally in your
[46:19] life and take that sword and drive it to
[46:22] the heart of that enemy
[46:23] once you use authority for that
[46:26] and the second thing is the bible says
[46:28] it this way
[46:30] she wrote
[46:32] with all authority esther wrote with all
[46:36] authority and what did she write
[46:38] she wrote the redemption and the
[46:40] deliverance of all the jews
[46:45] use your authority to save somebody else
[46:48] and redeem somebody else
[46:51] and that's why jesus said
[46:53] james and john you're totally of the
[46:55] wrong spirit right now you don't even
[46:57] understand the authority of god you're
[46:59] totally out of order this is completely
[47:01] wrong
[47:02] i the son of man didn't come with this
[47:05] power and authority to destroy men's
[47:07] lives
[47:09] but to save men's lives
[47:11] there's a good thing to use your
[47:12] authority in you got it
[47:15] use it
[47:17] use it to help somebody
[47:19] speak words of life to help somebody
[47:23] there's more in you in potentials
[47:27] than what you realize tonight
[47:30] god has deposited
[47:32] more in you than i can ever preach and
[47:35] get clear to you god has deposited his
[47:38] life and authority in you
[47:40] it's not coming it's in you now
[47:44] how will you use it what will you do
[47:47] with it
[47:49] i say help us lord praise the lord is
[47:53] that good tonight is that good is that
[47:54] good with everybody amen
[47:56] let's stand together what a wonderful
[47:59] wonderful thing god has brought us in
[48:01] the word of god and showed us that we
[48:03] have this life what will we do with it
[48:05] we have this power of electricity when
[48:07] are we going to harness it and bring it
[48:09] into the right thing to do something
[48:11] good with it
[48:12] praise the lord amen he's good
[48:16] impress us lord as we
[48:18] come to this
[48:19] tonight this great truth that you have
[48:21] presented to us
[48:23] lord we pray that you would help us to
[48:26] offer up humble hearts to you
[48:28] help us to find that character that says
[48:30] not my own will but thine be done
[48:33] help us to walk with you every day in
[48:35] fellowship
[48:36] lord i wanted to get into adam and where
[48:39] he fell and he exercised authority over
[48:42] control over the elements and the
[48:45] animals and he named the animals and
[48:48] lord he's exercising all this authority
[48:50] and yet the prophet said
[48:53] but the place that he fell in
[48:56] was to take that and use that power
[48:59] for himself and over his own situation
[49:01] with the serpent
[49:04] he had all authority and yet somehow he
[49:06] backed off from using it
[49:08] in a personal way for his personal his
[49:10] wife got out of order his wife got out
[49:13] of her got out of a place and fell to
[49:15] the serpent's reasoning and he fell with
[49:18] it and all this stuff began to happen
[49:20] and
[49:21] satan was messing with
[49:23] adam's promise that he'll multiply and
[49:25] replenish the earth
[49:27] misinterpreting and all those things he
[49:29] should have stood there with the same
[49:30] authority that he spoke to the winds
[49:33] and spoke to that personal situation
