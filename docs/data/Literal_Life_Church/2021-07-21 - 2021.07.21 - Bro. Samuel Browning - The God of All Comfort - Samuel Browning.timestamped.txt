[0:00] let's go to second corinthians
[0:03] i want to just bring greetings from
[0:06] church and family and
[0:20] and second corinthians and i want to
[0:24] begin at verse
[0:25] in chapter one and verse three
[0:36] paul writing here blessed be god
[0:39] even the father of our lord jesus christ
[0:42] the father of mercies
[0:44] and the god of all comfort
[0:47] who comforteth us in all our tribulation
[0:51] that we may be able to comfort them
[0:55] which are in any trouble by the comfort
[0:59] wherewith we ourselves are
[1:02] comforted of god for as the sufferings
[1:06] of christ
[1:06] abound in us so our consolation
[1:10] also aboundeth by christ
[1:14] and whether we be afflicted it's for
[1:16] your consolation and salvation
[1:19] which is effectual in the enduring of
[1:22] the same
[1:23] sufferings which we also suffer or
[1:26] whether
[1:26] we be comforted it is for your
[1:29] consolation
[1:30] and salvation and our hope of you is
[1:33] steadfast
[1:34] knowing that as you are partakers of the
[1:37] sufferings
[1:38] so shall you be also of the consolation
[1:42] amen i'd just like to just take a little
[1:45] thought here just for a few moments and
[1:47] just speak on
[1:48] the god of all comfort amen may god
[1:51] bless you bless the reading of the word
[1:52] as you're being seated
[1:55] i wonder if we could if we just go to
[1:58] saint john chapter 14 as well i want to
[2:01] i want to pull from there
[2:02] just to read this for a background here
[2:05] just a moment
[2:07] in saint john 14 verse 12 and i don't
[2:10] know if the brothers are putting it up
[2:12] there or not and it's okay
[2:13] not to add pressure on you uh but
[2:16] i just want to refer to that i know
[2:19] sometimes on the midweek services it
[2:20] allows us to kind of move a little bit
[2:22] with those
[2:23] verses up there verily verily i say unto
[2:26] you he that believeth on me the works
[2:28] that i do shall he do also
[2:30] and greater works than these shall he do
[2:33] because i go unto my father
[2:35] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[2:37] that will i do
[2:38] that the father may be glorified in the
[2:41] son
[2:42] and if ye shall ask anything in my name
[2:45] i will do it if you love me keep my
[2:49] commandments
[2:50] and i will pray the father and he shall
[2:52] give you another
[2:54] comforter that he may abide with you
[2:56] forever
[2:57] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[3:00] cannot receive
[3:02] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[3:04] him
[3:05] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[3:08] and shall be in you i will not leave you
[3:12] comfortless i will come to you
[3:17] yet a little while the world seeth me no
[3:19] more but ye see me
[3:20] because i live ye shall live also and at
[3:23] that day
[3:24] ye shall know that i am in my father and
[3:27] ye and me and i in you
[3:29] and he that hath my commandments and
[3:31] keepeth them he it is that loveth me
[3:33] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[3:35] my father
[3:37] i will love him and will manifest myself
[3:40] to him so when we
[3:43] look here as paul is bringing this here
[3:47] in second corinthians
[3:49] and he's dealing with the god of all
[3:50] comfort
[3:52] we recognize there's a lot of comfort
[3:55] and from a lot of different
[3:56] areas we can receive comfort from
[3:59] sometimes
[4:00] the things that comfort that a person
[4:03] can receive is not really
[4:05] comfort because it doesn't it doesn't
[4:08] point them in the right direction
[4:10] it's not really it's not really of a
[4:13] true comfort it'd be like if you know
[4:15] somebody's going in the wrong or they're
[4:16] headed down the wrong way
[4:18] and instead of just really you know
[4:21] being able to mention something to them
[4:22] to encourage them in the right direction
[4:24] maybe of their focus
[4:26] instead just to go along with it not to
[4:28] upset the apple cart that's not really
[4:30] a comfort but this comfort that that
[4:33] paul is dealing with here
[4:35] it's a comfort that is it is made known
[4:38] as paul would deal with this
[4:40] who comforteth us in all our tribulation
[4:43] and we know that in the christian
[4:45] journey in our life you know there's
[4:47] many times when you start out in your
[4:49] walk with god and
[4:51] my goodness from when your life is
[4:52] surrendered to the lord and my it just
[4:54] seems like you know here you are just
[4:56] skipping on the clouds and everything is
[4:58] just going you know just going so
[5:00] smoothly but then there's tests and
[5:02] there's
[5:03] trials and and all of those things are
[5:05] are
[5:06] are pronounced that they would come our
[5:08] way
[5:09] jesus said in john 16 33 be of good
[5:12] cheer
[5:13] for i've overcome the world and he said
[5:15] in this world
[5:16] you're going to have tribulation paul
[5:19] even went to the churches in the book of
[5:21] acts
[5:22] and admonished them you're going to have
[5:24] persecution
[5:25] you're going to have tribulation you see
[5:27] one of the greatest tactics of the enemy
[5:30] is to get us isolated and make us think
[5:33] things are going on in our life
[5:35] that are out of the ordinary it's out of
[5:37] the normal
[5:38] there's just something wrong with you
[5:40] but remember that's always the enemy's
[5:42] tactic
[5:43] the bible tells us paul would lead us
[5:45] back and say
[5:46] there's in samples of how that there's
[5:49] always been
[5:50] tests and trials you know being in god's
[5:53] will does not mean that we're exempt
[5:55] from testing and trying
[5:56] but being in the will of god actually
[5:59] invites the testing and trying because
[6:01] it's testing
[6:02] and trying that proves it's god's will
[6:06] not man's will because god's will is not
[6:09] something that we can pry into or
[6:12] get into but god's will is what's
[6:14] sovereignly revealed to your eyes
[6:17] it's like when you're praying about you
[6:19] know a job or a situation you know
[6:21] in your home and you're asking for the
[6:23] will of god you might be praying and
[6:25] praying and you're thinking
[6:27] my i just don't seem like i'm getting
[6:28] any answer what should i do at that time
[6:31] just be patient because there's a
[6:33] testing
[6:34] and a trying going on remember god
[6:37] his ear is open to your prayer
[6:40] and god knows exactly what you have need
[6:43] of
[6:43] he's not forgotten he's not away on a
[6:46] vacation
[6:47] he knows exactly what your need is and
[6:50] sometimes god will allow a situation to
[6:53] go on
[6:53] that you're praying about maybe you've
[6:55] set the prayer request here
[6:57] that the song leader could say no need
[6:58] to write i've got it remembered up here
[7:00] you always write the same one
[7:02] every service but it doesn't matter the
[7:05] length of time
[7:06] god is still god he cares
[7:10] he's mindful of our needs and so
[7:13] you know as we come into that because
[7:15] satan's objective is always to try to
[7:18] get things in a place to where our
[7:20] spirits get all
[7:21] anxious and we get into a place to where
[7:24] we're tore up and we really can't
[7:26] receive from god what we really want to
[7:28] receive let me just say this and you
[7:30] know this as believers
[7:31] god is not obligated just on sundays
[7:34] to come and reveal his will he's not
[7:37] obligated just on wednesdays to come and
[7:39] reveal his will
[7:40] there are things that as the word is
[7:42] being ministered right
[7:44] here and you're taking that word in it
[7:46] can be a word that you've received from
[7:48] god and here you are
[7:50] maybe right in the middle of target
[7:52] doing your shopping and it drops from
[7:54] here
[7:55] to there and you realize oh my this
[7:58] is the will of god this is what god's
[8:01] desire was you see
[8:03] god was mindful even though it dropped
[8:05] on thursday morning
[8:06] but god here always knew about it it may
[8:09] have been spoken on sunday morning but
[8:12] it finally dropped it's god letting you
[8:14] know
[8:15] i've got this under control i'm watching
[8:17] over every situation
[8:20] so testing trials as they come our way
[8:22] persecutions
[8:24] adversity comes our way and and satan
[8:27] is always at it to try to bring
[8:30] a place to where to isolate us to make
[8:32] us think that
[8:33] well this is just happening to you
[8:35] because of you or or this is going on
[8:38] but we recognize that peter would even
[8:40] stand there and
[8:41] and these were necessary things to put
[8:44] the believer in mind of you know
[8:46] it's something about it when you get
[8:47] around somebody else
[8:49] and you start hearing different
[8:50] testimonies let me just step back a
[8:52] minute
[8:53] there's times where you know even as
[8:55] i've heard it from other veterans and
[8:56] things like that
[8:57] of ministers and you begin to hear
[8:59] things that they've gone through
[9:01] and things that they have have dealt
[9:03] with and went through and then you begin
[9:05] to realize
[9:06] wow you would never even see it or know
[9:08] it but then you
[9:09] recognize there's things that they've
[9:11] went through there's things here and
[9:13] there and you know what that does
[9:14] it just further edifies that you're not
[9:17] the only one
[9:20] because see when peter would write he
[9:22] would say think
[9:23] not that that fiery trial is
[9:26] is some strange thing that has happened
[9:29] to you
[9:30] because our thoughts many times can get
[9:32] in the way
[9:33] our thoughts themselves it can be an
[9:36] effect of our
[9:37] attitude or it will affect our attitude
[9:39] on how we're looking at things
[9:41] but remember the test and trial peter
[9:44] would write it this way
[9:45] it is come to try our faith
[9:48] it's not trying our flesh it's not
[9:51] trying our spirit
[9:52] because there's no test or trial
[9:55] that that or our flesh or our spirit can
[9:58] prevail over a test or trial
[10:00] it's got to take something deeper than
[10:03] our flesh
[10:04] to prevail even when we're standing
[10:06] there and we don't have the answers
[10:08] we don't know what's coming next but
[10:10] there's a faith on the inside
[10:12] it's not a faith that's given by man
[10:15] it's the faith of the son of god
[10:17] who loved me and gave himself for me
[10:20] it's the faith of the living god
[10:22] who would stand there in our lives the
[10:24] same god who spoke his word and step
[10:27] back and believe it
[10:28] is the same god that resides inside the
[10:31] heart of the believer
[10:33] and we are comforting in these things as
[10:36] peter said
[10:37] that that thinking not some strange
[10:39] thing
[10:40] because the trial the test it's what has
[10:42] come to prove
[10:43] us you see the faith is the real
[10:47] it's the real gold of almighty god
[10:50] and that the trial the test it comes to
[10:53] prove
[10:53] what is really there sometimes even in
[10:55] the midst of it is we're looking at it
[10:58] if we could see the real victory within
[11:00] it it's that which
[11:01] is standing in the midst and how that
[11:03] there's an anchor that's there
[11:05] that when you don't know what's going on
[11:07] you don't even know the outcome
[11:09] you don't even know the next step to
[11:11] take but you're standing there saying
[11:14] god that brought me this far
[11:17] he will make a way and he'll take me the
[11:20] rest of the way
[11:21] how's it going to be i don't know but
[11:23] back how he brought me from where i was
[11:25] i don't know how that took place but i
[11:27] know it happened
[11:28] and so the where i'm standing now is not
[11:31] man-made ground it is ground that has
[11:34] sacredly been given to me
[11:37] by god himself i'm not here by an
[11:40] accident
[11:40] i'm not here by a hamper stance i'm here
[11:43] by the forenation and the plan
[11:46] of almighty god you say what are you
[11:49] doing we're drawing
[11:50] comfort in these times
[11:53] and this is where paul was writing that
[11:56] this this
[11:56] this this tribulation if you if we look
[11:59] in the scriptures once again
[12:00] who comforteth us in all our
[12:04] tribulation that we may be able to
[12:07] comfort them
[12:08] which are in any trouble by the comfort
[12:10] wherewith we ourselves
[12:12] are comforted of god for as the
[12:15] sufferings of christ
[12:16] abound in us so our consolation also
[12:20] aboundeth by christ so the trials the
[12:24] tests and
[12:25] those things that comes our way the
[12:27] adversity is
[12:28] opportunities for god to manifest
[12:31] his consolation and his comfort to you
[12:34] and i
[12:35] you you see you and i many times as a
[12:38] father or as a husband or
[12:40] a parent there's times that things that
[12:42] you know our children can go through
[12:44] they can experience and here they are
[12:46] they're experiencing it you're not
[12:47] approaching it from book learning
[12:49] you're looking at it and saying god how
[12:51] do i minister to this need right now
[12:53] how do i speak to this need right here
[12:55] because there's a need for comfort in
[12:58] that situation
[12:59] there's a need for consolation so that
[13:01] they can move on
[13:02] in the right direction and this is where
[13:05] we have to say lord
[13:06] help me guide me in the midst of this
[13:08] time you know what that's just like noah
[13:10] was
[13:11] noah was noah had to look to god
[13:14] in every step of the way but noah had a
[13:17] direct word from god
[13:18] when things got tough when things got
[13:21] hard when adversity came his way
[13:23] he had a direct word from god that he
[13:26] could depend on
[13:27] and he could go to you say what are you
[13:30] saying brother samuel
[13:31] i'm saying that in every situation that
[13:34] you and i go through
[13:35] there's a place that we can come back to
[13:38] it's a place where we can abide
[13:40] that god himself has brought a comfort
[13:43] in our lives we at one time were dead in
[13:47] sin and trespasses
[13:48] but he has quickened us from death unto
[13:51] life
[13:52] we haven't brought ourselves here you
[13:54] see the battles that we face
[13:56] we're not going off of of new things we
[13:59] are
[13:59] facing every battle like moses faced it
[14:02] from the sacred sands of god's grace
[14:05] where we have met
[14:06] god and that's a comfort remember moses
[14:08] ran one time
[14:10] but after moses was there in the
[14:12] presence of god that time
[14:14] when he went down into egypt the next
[14:16] time as he went down in there
[14:18] when the situations didn't turn out
[14:20] exactly like he thought it was going to
[14:22] be
[14:22] but it didn't cause him to run he had a
[14:25] comfort
[14:26] from god who god said i will surely
[14:30] be with you you see there's something
[14:33] that you and i have
[14:35] that's it's so much greater than even
[14:38] what abraham had and
[14:40] and what moses had and all of the old
[14:42] testament saints
[14:44] and we can look at their lives and think
[14:46] my goodness
[14:47] what heroes of faith and they were
[14:49] heroes of faith
[14:50] there's god's will was revealed to them
[14:53] but remember
[14:54] they did not have the privilege like you
[14:56] and i have
[14:57] to actually come to a place to have
[15:00] a new birth to actually be changed to be
[15:04] transformed in our life to receive a
[15:06] comfort that
[15:07] it surpasses every every other comfort
[15:10] they didn't have that but they were a
[15:13] type and a pressing to that place
[15:16] to that comfort that you and i have the
[15:18] privilege
[15:19] and the opportunity to abide in tonight
[15:22] you see that that comfort where you know
[15:24] brother graham could tell us they could
[15:26] look back to this one
[15:27] and see how this one took the word and
[15:30] this one took the word
[15:31] there were examples they could look at
[15:33] just like there's examples that you and
[15:35] i
[15:35] can look at there's examples all across
[15:38] this room here tonight there's examples
[15:40] here tonight that though
[15:42] you or i may not be able to see or to
[15:44] look down in somebody's life
[15:46] we don't have to do that but just to
[15:48] know that you're sitting here tonight
[15:50] you've had to press your way through to
[15:53] be here tonight
[15:55] there might be some of you sitting here
[15:57] tonight that there has been news that
[15:59] you've received
[16:00] this day or other days and it might be
[16:03] devastating news
[16:05] it might be news that would so break
[16:07] your spirit and seem like your will
[16:10] but there is something greater inside of
[16:12] you
[16:13] that's pressing you on because you could
[16:15] say if i can
[16:16] just make it to the house of god i've
[16:19] i've
[16:20] got a hope that god's gonna speak to my
[16:23] heart
[16:24] god's got something for me he's not left
[16:27] me alone he knows exactly where i'm
[16:30] at hallelujah
[16:34] this is god him walking right among us
[16:37] knowing the very needs of our life and
[16:39] paul is writing this
[16:41] that this this tribulation that we're
[16:43] experiencing
[16:44] that with that tribulation comes the
[16:47] comfort
[16:48] of almighty god god takes
[16:52] what what the the world or i would say
[16:55] what satan looks at let me bring this
[16:58] and remember he cannot bring anything
[17:00] your way unless he first gets permission
[17:03] he's not doing this on his own god does
[17:06] not you know
[17:06] tests and trials that come our way
[17:08] remember brother branham lays it out
[17:10] very clearly and we see in the scripture
[17:12] that tests and trials they are
[17:13] predestinated from the hand of almighty
[17:16] god
[17:17] there are things that you and i
[17:18] experience and there might be things i
[17:20] experienced
[17:21] that might be different from you brother
[17:23] there might be things that you could
[17:24] look at in my tester trial and say
[17:26] ah why don't brother samuel just just
[17:27] come on press on through that
[17:29] and yet there's times where you feel
[17:31] like in your tester trial
[17:32] my i don't feel like i can press on
[17:34] through this but you see god knows
[17:36] it's our molding our makeup our shaping
[17:39] that's taking place in our life
[17:41] character and you know this character
[17:44] is not a gift the holy ghost is the gift
[17:48] of god
[17:49] it's the act of god you can't earn it
[17:51] you can't merit it
[17:53] the holy ghost is the sovereign grace of
[17:56] god
[17:56] that comes to your life to lead you to a
[17:59] place of surrender
[18:00] that he might step in and finish a work
[18:03] within your life to where you're no
[18:05] longer your own but now
[18:07] you belong to him and the word that was
[18:10] out here
[18:11] is now dwelling inside of your life in a
[18:14] real comfort
[18:15] and that holy spirit in our life is the
[18:17] gift
[18:18] of almighty god but character is not a
[18:20] gift
[18:21] [Music]
[18:22] character is a victory
[18:27] it's things that it's things that
[18:29] remember at the very character
[18:31] of our lives is molded by the life
[18:34] that's within us
[18:36] you see the preaching that's why it
[18:38] doesn't matter you know
[18:39] what what text your pastor would take
[18:42] when he stands here
[18:43] he can stand here and take a text on
[18:44] marriage and divorce and the holy spirit
[18:47] will bring new birth in the congregation
[18:48] because
[18:49] the spirit of god comes to the word it's
[18:52] the spirit
[18:53] of truth and it's reconciling us unto
[18:56] himself
[18:57] and so when we're looking here into the
[18:59] word how the holy spirit
[19:01] he will come right down and he'll he'll
[19:03] minister ever so personally to our lives
[19:06] and there's molding and shaping that
[19:08] goes on in our lives
[19:10] but the character molding if we had if
[19:13] we had the opportunity
[19:14] there's a lot of things brother kenny
[19:15] we'd have said i'll bypass that one
[19:18] but you see this isn't an extra value
[19:20] menu
[19:21] where you pick i'll take the 99 cents
[19:23] version i'll take this we can't do that
[19:27] you know there's tests and trials
[19:28] there's things that you might look at in
[19:30] your life and say
[19:30] well you know why did i make this
[19:32] decision we understand
[19:34] not every decision even from a
[19:36] predestinated son and daughter
[19:38] of god we cannot claim that every
[19:39] decision oh it was completely influenced
[19:42] by god
[19:42] sad to say there's been some decisions
[19:45] that we have to man up and say
[19:47] that was not god that was me
[19:50] but god can teach us in those situations
[19:53] he can bring comfort to our lives
[19:55] to let us see you got off track here but
[19:58] i never left you
[19:59] i said i'll never leave you i never
[20:01] forsake you what is it
[20:03] it's comfort then if we can allow the
[20:05] holy spirit in the midst
[20:06] of tests and trials and things that's
[20:09] going on in our life
[20:10] even to come and to teach us in those
[20:12] times
[20:13] he will let us know i've been right here
[20:16] the whole time i'm not the one who went
[20:18] away you did but i never took my eye off
[20:21] of you
[20:24] glory be to god that's real comfort
[20:28] amen even when you know you feel like as
[20:30] a young person you feel i feel like i'm
[20:32] all alone
[20:33] but you know what you're not alone
[20:36] you're not alone you stand for him
[20:38] he stands for you there's opportunities
[20:41] that you have
[20:42] to stand for the lord tests and trials
[20:45] will come your way
[20:46] things that will come to really to
[20:48] really test you see what the enemy's
[20:50] doing
[20:50] he's not coming against your flesh and
[20:52] your spirit he's testing to see
[20:55] where is that word at in your life
[20:58] if that word is only there in your mind
[21:01] quickly you'll deviate from it when
[21:02] pressure comes
[21:04] but you see don't don't look around and
[21:06] say well i never had anything in the
[21:07] beginning
[21:08] but take that as as an evidence to say
[21:11] i need to go deeper
[21:15] you see we we're not ignorant of satan's
[21:18] devices
[21:18] he likes to try to bring things and say
[21:21] well you know there was another nothing
[21:22] ever to it let me tell you something
[21:24] every one of your experiences from
[21:26] justification to sanctification
[21:28] to the baptism of the holy ghost is
[21:31] predestinated
[21:32] experiences by the hand of almighty god
[21:36] you say what is it brother samuel it's
[21:37] talking about just
[21:39] taking a hunger for the things of god
[21:42] that lord the comfort i've received
[21:44] in justification i want to be further
[21:46] comforted
[21:47] with a cleansed life lord and further
[21:50] comforted where the comforter himself
[21:52] the word becomes preeminent in my
[21:55] life i want the god of comfort in my
[21:59] life i want the depth
[22:00] of the holy spirit in my life that when
[22:03] tests
[22:03] and trials and situations come when
[22:06] friends go a certain way
[22:07] when others depart this way there's
[22:09] something there's an anchor in your life
[22:12] and there's a place you can draw
[22:14] strength from brother you're
[22:16] tapped into a network it's got a
[22:18] powerhouse
[22:19] of joy and glory i'm talking about the
[22:22] holy ghost tonight
[22:24] it's the real comfort of almighty god
[22:26] that's given to you and i
[22:28] because sometimes there's things that
[22:30] come our way there's adversities there's
[22:32] all types of
[22:33] situations and things that that we can
[22:35] face we're not exempt from those things
[22:37] and i know we know this
[22:38] but it just you know from what's burning
[22:40] in my heart to just bring that and to
[22:42] encourage in that way
[22:43] we're not exempt from those things you
[22:46] know even when you think of how
[22:47] daniel daniel made a stand as a young
[22:50] person i'm just going to go with it
[22:51] he made a stand as a young person he was
[22:54] not going to be a partaker
[22:56] of the king's meat he said i'm not going
[22:59] to be a partaker from his table
[23:01] i'm not going to do it and because he
[23:03] made that stand
[23:05] the devil made him prove it so what
[23:08] happened the stand that he took
[23:10] now invited grounds for that stand
[23:14] to be proven on so when god does
[23:16] something in your life
[23:18] it can be something right in the service
[23:20] of be setting sin
[23:21] or something is cut away don't walk out
[23:23] of the doors and expect
[23:24] well there's not going to be any
[23:25] temptation there's going to be proving
[23:28] crowns
[23:29] but god will invite and say come on
[23:31] devil
[23:32] there's been a real work that's taken
[23:34] here there's proving grounds
[23:36] right here in their lives
[23:40] amen because you know the source the
[23:43] source of strength
[23:44] is in him paul writing this you know
[23:48] of this of this comfort and you know a
[23:51] lot of times
[23:53] we you know we we like comfort but this
[23:56] comfort as paul would write of it
[23:58] it's the same word that jesus is
[24:00] referring to
[24:01] i believe it's the word paracletos which
[24:03] is one
[24:04] who is called to the aid of one
[24:07] one who comes to give strength you see
[24:11] you and i we can't we can't do this on
[24:13] our own
[24:15] we can't live it on our own there's no
[24:17] way
[24:18] as we look around this room here tonight
[24:20] we're looking at lives
[24:22] that are not living this on their own
[24:25] amen it won't work by our intellect it
[24:28] won't work in that way
[24:30] it takes a living experience with the
[24:33] living god
[24:34] to where when situations arise that you
[24:36] don't know the answer to
[24:38] you don't know which way to take you
[24:40] don't know the direction let me just say
[24:42] this to you you already know this as a
[24:43] church
[24:44] but marriage you can't get marriage out
[24:46] of a book
[24:47] you can't get even children and children
[24:49] raising out of a book there's things out
[24:51] there sure that you know that you can
[24:53] read but i can tell you right now
[24:54] it takes a time of waiting on god
[24:57] because listen
[24:58] when god brought samson on the earth
[25:00] before he ever did it
[25:01] the angel of the lord came to his mama
[25:05] and let her know there's a purpose for
[25:07] this young man
[25:08] let me just say that that's why you're
[25:10] not here by a chance tonight
[25:12] god has a purpose for your life
[25:16] are you with me god has a purpose for
[25:18] your life
[25:19] he has a purpose that that even as you
[25:22] came here
[25:22] there's a reason and there's a reason
[25:25] why as young people
[25:26] that satan is after you he's after you
[25:29] but why your strength
[25:30] your stamina your life he would like to
[25:33] try to wreck your life
[25:34] and try to twist it up to where you
[25:36] can't even look up but he underestimates
[25:39] the power
[25:40] of god upon a seed of almighty god
[25:43] brother there's something about it you
[25:45] can be all tore up but you get in the
[25:47] presence of almighty god
[25:49] there's something about the light of the
[25:51] s-o-n that begins to move
[25:53] across that seed it'll bring comfort
[25:56] it'll bring courage
[25:57] where you looked at yourself i can't go
[25:59] there i cannot confess that
[26:01] i cannot but there's a comfort because
[26:04] the holy spirit
[26:05] is not a condemning spirit he brings
[26:08] conviction
[26:09] with the comforting of his presence
[26:13] he wants to draw us he wants
[26:15] relationship he don't want
[26:17] distance
[26:20] you see when he convicts you maybe
[26:23] because of what's on your phone or
[26:24] whatever more that's conviction
[26:27] it's not to shame you it's not
[26:29] condemnation
[26:30] it's conviction satan
[26:33] is the one i've just got to go with this
[26:36] satan is the one
[26:37] who will inspire it to be done and then
[26:40] turn around
[26:41] and hang condemnation over your head but
[26:44] god he'll stand right there and say i
[26:47] know about it that's why i've had my
[26:49] servants just strike on it
[26:51] and hit at it because i have loved you
[26:54] i care about you let me tell you
[26:57] something
[26:57] there is not a filthy enough demon
[27:01] to keep god away from his child
[27:08] that that young man the prodigal was
[27:10] down in the pig pen he was covered with
[27:12] mud
[27:13] but he probably would not even let him
[27:14] in this congregation tonight
[27:17] unless we gave him a bath and perfumed
[27:19] him up real good
[27:20] but the age of the lord went there
[27:23] and spoke to his heart because you see
[27:26] brother braham tells us there was a
[27:27] mother and a father who were down and
[27:30] having prayer
[27:31] in their living room you see that mother
[27:33] and father was taking comfort
[27:35] from the word they had received an
[27:37] experience
[27:38] and they know i couldn't bring myself to
[27:41] this
[27:42] i'm not the one who did this i didn't
[27:44] change my life
[27:45] but it's god who changed my life and
[27:48] this is how a mother and father would
[27:50] pray
[27:50] lord you're the one to change their
[27:53] lives
[27:54] you're the one to bring that change and
[27:55] the angel of the lord
[27:57] went and dealt with his life i tell you
[28:00] there's promises we have
[28:02] as parents you might say my child is so
[28:04] far gone this way
[28:05] but they can't outrun god amen david
[28:09] said surely goodness and mercy
[28:11] shall follow me that means chase after
[28:14] me
[28:14] all the days of my life amen i shall
[28:18] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[28:20] it doesn't matter where they're at you
[28:22] can just stop right now and say lord
[28:24] i send the holy spirit out after him
[28:26] lord
[28:27] maybe it's a wife maybe it's a husband
[28:29] lord i send the holy spirit out
[28:31] why you've got a comfort of his word
[28:34] and his word is your comfort and you
[28:36] know that
[28:37] god cannot fail
[28:41] oh my what a comfort that we have
[28:45] amen in the lord and you find this
[28:49] consolation
[28:50] that that we have received from god it's
[28:53] a strength
[28:54] that keeps us it keeps us day after day
[28:58] year after year you know it's something
[29:02] that's
[29:02] that's that's very deep in our life it's
[29:04] something that's
[29:05] that's greater than than even our
[29:10] resolve i remember as a young person i
[29:13] had a lot of resolve
[29:14] i went to i went to a youth camp i gave
[29:17] my life to the lord i had a lot of
[29:19] resolve
[29:19] i wanted to serve god i didn't want to
[29:21] go back out around the things of the
[29:22] world
[29:25] that resolve was good but i needed to go
[29:27] deeper
[29:28] what is it just keep walking in the same
[29:31] one who's touched your life remember
[29:33] the holy ghost is not is not a
[29:37] thought but the holy ghost is the person
[29:39] the same god
[29:40] who's dealt with your life what do i do
[29:43] keep
[29:43] walking and keep seeking after him
[29:46] how long do i seek after him seek until
[29:49] you're
[29:50] satisfied amen where you you have that
[29:54] satisfaction
[29:55] it's no longer me
[29:58] my life has been changed and transformed
[30:02] by his life that's a comfort in our
[30:05] lives
[30:06] you see brother branham would put it
[30:08] like this in the message of living dying
[30:11] buried rising and coming and he's saying
[30:14] i'm so glad to know that he can be found
[30:18] amongst the brokenhearted
[30:22] in our sorrows he's not one that would
[30:25] leave us
[30:28] jesus don't leave you when times get
[30:30] tough
[30:32] that's when he he takes an opportunity
[30:35] remember he'll manifest one of his
[30:38] seven compound redemptive names
[30:41] every situation is an opportunity for
[30:44] god to manifest himself
[30:46] the sickness that has come your way the
[30:48] doctor's report
[30:49] it's not by chance it's an opportunity
[30:52] for jehovah rafa to reveal
[30:56] his love and his care to you what do i
[30:58] do take the
[30:59] comfort of the word that's in your heart
[31:02] where he
[31:02] said i'm the lord that healeth all light
[31:04] diseases
[31:06] by his stripes i am healed he never said
[31:09] sickness wouldn't come but he said when
[31:11] it does come i
[31:12] will take it away
[31:17] it's a comfort notice he says he stands
[31:19] by us
[31:20] when all has failed and the last hopes
[31:23] of earthly reaching
[31:25] has come to its end he is still god
[31:28] and he loves us he was he was the
[31:31] expression
[31:32] of god oh he says i believe that he
[31:35] longs for his people
[31:37] to be so anointed i want you just to
[31:39] listen this
[31:40] i believe he longs for his people to be
[31:43] so anointed
[31:44] with his spirit that we could go to
[31:47] each other in trials and in troubles
[31:52] and give the expression of his
[31:55] sympathy as it pours from our
[31:58] hearts that's been born of his spirit
[32:01] to reflect in the church the love
[32:05] of the living god so as he was an
[32:08] expression
[32:09] to you and i get into where where we had
[32:13] the word
[32:14] there was no doubt you know they could
[32:16] look at the word they had experiences
[32:18] with god
[32:19] lord god had said and god would keep his
[32:21] word but here came the day where the
[32:23] word itself
[32:24] was no longer just a letter but thou the
[32:27] word
[32:28] had become flesh and that word that had
[32:30] become flesh that had expressed himself
[32:33] to david to gideon to daniel to abraham
[32:36] to moses to noah
[32:37] that same god now had come down in a
[32:40] form
[32:41] under the anointing of redemption to
[32:43] express
[32:44] that he is the god who's been right
[32:46] there the whole time
[32:47] as a matter of fact when they were down
[32:49] in egypt in bondage
[32:50] he was right there he was right there
[32:54] the whole time
[32:55] looking on remember he heard their
[32:57] groanings
[32:58] he earned their sufferings but something
[33:01] changed what changed their prayers
[33:07] their prayers started changing and that
[33:11] drew god on the scene god began to deal
[33:14] with his servant out here
[33:16] and god also dealing down there with his
[33:19] people
[33:19] their prayers within the situation
[33:22] change you know
[33:23] it's one thing you know to experience a
[33:25] little difficulty and then
[33:27] it gets all smoothed out and you forget
[33:29] about it we've seen that happen in this
[33:31] nation as well
[33:32] i mean everybody got religious after 9
[33:34] 11. i mean people got reliant all kinds
[33:36] of
[33:37] religious things you let some kind of
[33:39] catastrophe happen
[33:40] but after a period of time it all
[33:42] subsides
[33:43] why religion doesn't work
[33:47] religion is only a covering but you see
[33:50] god doesn't come to cover he comes to
[33:54] deal with the root and the source
[33:57] of the problem that we might be
[34:00] comforted
[34:00] when situations arise we've got a
[34:03] consolation
[34:04] that he said i'll never leave you nor
[34:07] forsake you
[34:09] amen what a comfort that we have in him
[34:12] paul experienced the sufferings many
[34:14] times
[34:15] paul would you know look at it and take
[34:17] the sufferings
[34:18] and what was taking place and paul would
[34:20] say we're bearing about in our body
[34:23] the dying of the lord jesus
[34:26] why that the life might be made manifest
[34:30] so there's a need for the molding the
[34:33] shaping
[34:34] that goes on in our life i know these
[34:36] things these are these are very
[34:38] uh common places that we've tread upon
[34:40] but i'm thankful every once in a while
[34:42] that god
[34:42] reminds us of this you know what god's
[34:44] letting us know you're not alone
[34:46] what you're dealing with or what you're
[34:48] going through or what you are coming to
[34:50] because
[34:51] this is how it is with trials you're
[34:53] either in one
[34:54] out of one coming to one that's that's
[34:56] certain ground right there
[34:58] but in the midst of the time we're being
[35:00] molded
[35:01] and shaped it's intestine trials
[35:05] where the frailty of our humanity shows
[35:07] up
[35:09] i mean there's nobody in here signing up
[35:10] for a test or trial tonight
[35:12] you know lord it's been an awful long
[35:14] time something's wrong
[35:16] because brother brown tells us and how
[35:18] can i overcome when the testing is
[35:20] taking place
[35:21] that's one sure evidence that god
[35:25] is with us you want evidence that god's
[35:29] with you
[35:30] look at the tests or trials that's
[35:31] coming your way you say brother samuel
[35:33] what what will i do with that well i
[35:35] would just go into the scripture
[35:37] and i would conduct myself with joy joy
[35:39] doesn't necessarily mean bubble dancing
[35:42] joy is a condition in your soul that
[35:45] while all of this out here
[35:46] can be fading away things crumbling but
[35:49] you've got to settle peace
[35:51] that i know that i know that i know i
[35:53] know in whom i have believed and i
[35:55] am persuaded that he is able to keep
[35:59] that
[35:59] which i've committed to him against that
[36:01] day that's a comfort to you and i
[36:05] because when god makes it on his will
[36:07] like he did to noah
[36:08] no one was going to be tested on it
[36:12] god's not afraid for his word to be
[36:14] tested
[36:16] he's not afraid as a matter of fact it's
[36:17] an opportunity to show
[36:20] that this is not humanity
[36:23] that's standing it's deity inside of
[36:26] humanity
[36:28] think of how this you know you and i we
[36:30] had something that was of great
[36:32] value or very precious you wouldn't put
[36:34] it in a fragile pot
[36:37] would you do that you wouldn't put it in
[36:38] something fragile would you
[36:40] you'd want to make sure man it's
[36:41] something that if i drop it
[36:43] like your phone or if you got a phone or
[36:45] whatever you have you know i don't want
[36:46] to crack that screen so you don't want
[36:48] to make sure man i want the best
[36:49] otterbox there is i want to otterbox a
[36:51] sledgehammer and everything else can
[36:52] protect it and and you know monster
[36:54] trucks can run over it
[36:55] isn't that right and they got these
[36:57] cases now life lock life proof and
[36:59] and everything else you know think about
[37:01] it god
[37:02] chose to place his life the
[37:06] excellency of his power inside
[37:10] of earthen vessels you would think
[37:13] there surely would be another place
[37:16] that you could display the excellency of
[37:19] his power but if it was a great
[37:21] glorious vessel if the vessel had all
[37:23] kinds of strength and this vessel can't
[37:25] break and
[37:26] this vessel's not weak and this and that
[37:28] then the excellency of the glory
[37:30] can never be actually manifest
[37:33] but god chose to display
[37:37] his deity his life the excellency of his
[37:40] power
[37:41] brother henry inside of our frail
[37:43] vessels
[37:45] at times if there's times of no doubt
[37:48] you're saying you know what
[37:49] i i just feel so weak or maybe you get
[37:51] discouraged
[37:52] there is none of us exempt from being
[37:54] discouraged sometimes discouragement can
[37:57] hit
[37:57] you can see things this way or see
[37:59] things this way you say brother samuel
[38:00] what must i do
[38:01] don't deal dwell on that thought very
[38:03] long because it'll continue to bring you
[38:05] right down
[38:06] what must i dwell on dwell on the god
[38:08] who has brought you to where you are
[38:11] knowing that the same god he never led
[38:13] you here by coincidence
[38:14] it's not a happenstance he didn't make a
[38:16] mistake we have followed
[38:18] his leading what are we doing drawing
[38:21] comfort
[38:22] from him he knows exactly
[38:26] where each of us are at now to think of
[38:28] this in our lives that expression that
[38:31] has come to us
[38:33] that that same expression now might be
[38:36] in our lives
[38:37] to one another now let me just try to
[38:42] move this down a little bit here you see
[38:46] brother brown let me read it one more
[38:47] time he longs for his people
[38:49] to be so anointed with his spirit
[38:52] that we could go to each other in trials
[38:55] and in troubles
[38:56] and amazing brother bram never said i
[38:58] wanted i want that we could be so
[39:00] god longs for people to be so anointed
[39:01] with his spirit that they go out here
[39:03] and walk on lake michigan
[39:05] we'd all sign up for that i mean lord
[39:07] that's no problem
[39:08] but here the prophet places it that we
[39:11] could be so anointed with his spirit to
[39:14] go
[39:15] to others that are in a test or in a
[39:18] trial
[39:19] brother samuel that ain't very spiritual
[39:20] really
[39:22] who was the one in need we were and he
[39:25] came down
[39:26] to you and i we weren't worthy of how he
[39:30] came to us
[39:32] and there's many times as he's come to
[39:34] us
[39:35] and we haven't been worthy can i just
[39:37] preach for a minute
[39:38] we haven't listened to a certain quote
[39:40] of tapes that week
[39:41] we haven't maybe read you know of this
[39:43] chapter this chapter in my if you're
[39:45] like
[39:45] man you know i'm worthy for him could
[39:47] come tonight or i'm worthy for him to
[39:49] come
[39:49] but he shows up at times that you don't
[39:52] feel worthy
[39:53] why does he do that he's showing you and
[39:56] i it's
[39:57] not about you
[40:01] you are my work oh what does that do it
[40:03] draws
[40:04] comfort brings comfort to our lives
[40:08] that we could be so anointed with his
[40:10] spirit
[40:11] to be able to go to one another to be to
[40:13] be that sensitive to
[40:15] i could be that sensitive to say you
[40:16] know what we're getting i don't know but
[40:18] let me just tell you something
[40:19] god loves you he's mindful of your need
[40:23] to just be that sensitive now
[40:26] when we talk about being anointed of his
[40:28] spirit it isn't walking over to brother
[40:30] guinea and say
[40:31] hey what's going on oh this ah
[40:34] you get over it
[40:38] that ain't being anointed with his
[40:39] spirit
[40:41] anointed with his spirit is where what
[40:43] you've received
[40:44] see what's happening paul said where
[40:46] we've been comforted
[40:48] what's he saying i'm only a conduit can
[40:51] i preach for just a minute
[40:53] you see paul in the midst of his tests
[40:55] and trials you see a test or trial
[40:57] situation could come your way and you
[40:59] could become bitter
[41:01] and if you become bitter it's like it
[41:03] stalls right there
[41:04] the comfort you're not receiving the
[41:06] comfort the word even as it's coming
[41:08] it's precious it's pure it's sweet
[41:12] david said it's pure that's honey but
[41:14] yet there's a bitterness that's inside
[41:16] of you
[41:17] that for the test or trial or where
[41:19] you're sitting and you're not receiving
[41:21] the real satisfaction and the joy it
[41:23] isn't that the word has changed
[41:25] it's to say god this condition that's in
[41:28] my life
[41:28] where the acidity in my life has changed
[41:31] lord
[41:32] i need a refilling of the holy spirit
[41:35] i need a neutralizer of the acids in my
[41:38] body
[41:39] so i can enjoy the word of the lord
[41:42] the way that i need to lord
[41:46] because you're anointed
[41:49] to be a conduit that the comfort of god
[41:52] can flow through
[41:55] brother paul is a pastor here and
[41:56] there's supporting ministry and deacon
[41:58] but let me tell you something
[41:59] every one of you are called to this he
[42:01] said brother sam i'm just a young man
[42:04] you're a young man that's called to it
[42:06] there's other young men there's other
[42:07] young people that's in the church
[42:09] and there's things that you could have
[42:10] experienced that you know there's
[42:12] certain encouragements
[42:13] that's needed what must i do say lord
[42:15] let me be so anointed of the holy spirit
[42:18] that i could go to them and say hey i'm
[42:20] praying for you
[42:21] or just be a buddy right there that just
[42:23] can put your shoulder right next to him
[42:25] what is it
[42:26] it's the comfort of almighty god that's
[42:29] moving
[42:30] through your life because you and i both
[42:33] know
[42:33] you've been around people sometimes that
[42:35] and look when i say people
[42:36] they didn't like boy brother simon
[42:38] you're exempt no
[42:40] it's not that any of us are exempt but
[42:42] the thing that we you and i we
[42:43] experience certain things
[42:45] where there's things sometimes where
[42:46] you've asked people hey how's things
[42:47] going and you wish you hadn't asked
[42:51] because you're already going through
[42:52] things you wish you hadn't asked
[42:55] i mean you didn't say this is not a
[42:57] dumping yard we were just trying to
[43:00] you understand what i'm saying but you
[43:02] also realize you know what
[43:03] it's easy it's easy for somebody to get
[43:07] down
[43:07] it's easy for discouragement it's easy
[43:10] for things
[43:10] and bitterness it's not hard for those
[43:12] things to set in but
[43:14] there is a neutralizing to it if you can
[43:17] just
[43:17] open to the lord and be honest with god
[43:19] say lord you know what
[43:21] i don't understand this of what's taking
[43:22] place i don't understand what's going on
[43:25] but if you can just say lord will you
[43:27] show me lord
[43:29] and lord will you just direct me i put
[43:31] my trust in you
[43:32] forgive me for the wrong attitude i've
[43:34] had you see start right there
[43:35] repentance forgive me for the wrong
[43:37] attitude lord i've been looking at this
[43:39] as though
[43:40] you were against me or or this happened
[43:42] or the church is against me or
[43:44] brother paul's against me or the
[43:45] deacon's against me but lord
[43:47] i'm looking at this the wrong way i'm
[43:49] asking you to forgive me lord
[43:51] i'm going to trust you
[43:55] because let me tell you something every
[43:57] trial and every test that comes our way
[44:00] you know brother brown tells us he says
[44:02] he says we ask
[44:03] god for the best he says and he gives us
[44:06] the best
[44:08] he gives us the best he could test and
[44:10] trials
[44:12] he said that's better than peace he said
[44:14] because
[44:15] the test and trials is a molding and a
[44:17] shaping
[44:18] and our peace and all of that comes just
[44:21] beyond the river
[44:22] this is all the proving grounds right
[44:24] now this is the testing grounds right
[44:26] now
[44:27] god's got to have young people that'll
[44:29] stand in the midst of this hour
[44:31] where the spirit of god is dwelling in
[44:33] them that god can say in this generation
[44:36] when there's young people that'll rise
[44:37] up and say you don't know how bad
[44:39] everything is
[44:40] you don't know how great and how hard
[44:41] the pressures were in college
[44:43] but god's got to have young men and
[44:45] young women that can stand there and say
[44:48] it's true the pressures were great the
[44:50] temptations and everything was there
[44:52] but i'm here as a witness that god
[44:55] is greater than every situation
[44:59] god's got to have witnesses there
[45:01] sometimes you wonder why the classes
[45:03] you're in
[45:04] you're wondering why the professors you
[45:06] come in contact with or the teachers or
[45:08] you wonder why different ones
[45:10] that you're around it's there as a
[45:12] proving ground
[45:13] and that your life might be a lie you
[45:15] might say brother samuel they've never
[45:17] asked me they've never come here to
[45:19] church they've never sought anything out
[45:21] but there's a light that is within you
[45:23] that's bearing witness
[45:25] in this hour they may not be able to put
[45:27] their finger on
[45:28] your life or where what this is or what
[45:30] that is but there's something about it
[45:32] your life they know that's different
[45:37] and that's what god does in a life he
[45:39] puts a difference
[45:43] it's a real comfort in our life
[45:46] my goodness where does time go
[45:50] jesus said you know he spoke of us
[45:52] having love
[45:53] one for another
[45:56] you know you can live in a time where
[45:59] dismissal prayer is given
[46:00] and it's like a people could actually
[46:02] make the olympic trials
[46:03] as fast they get to their cars
[46:08] clock them hey you passed the trials
[46:11] you're on the team
[46:13] we're busy yeah right busy
[46:16] and this and that let me say this this
[46:19] is where
[46:21] this is where you get strength
[46:24] if there's people brother alex said i
[46:25] want to be around i want to be around
[46:27] believers
[46:29] if there's a place i want to be
[46:32] when i when i'm weak
[46:36] i'm going to be here i may not be
[46:39] dancing in the house that serves but i
[46:40] want to be here
[46:42] because i know where the bible said
[46:43] where two or three are gathered together
[46:44] in my name i will be in their midst also
[46:48] i know god comes here he comes by way of
[46:50] his word i know
[46:51] that the man of god that god places
[46:53] right here in this assembly and wherever
[46:56] you go to church at
[46:57] but god directs and he speaks
[46:59] specifically
[47:00] to your life there's a lot of things
[47:03] you're blessed by
[47:04] my i'm blessed by this blessed by that
[47:06] but there's a certain sounding to that
[47:08] trumpet
[47:08] it's dialed right into your life
[47:12] what is that that's god's working
[47:14] brother paul can't do that
[47:15] that's god that's done that that's god's
[47:18] order you see what god's desire is
[47:20] that you would know the will of god you
[47:22] know where you belong
[47:23] and it wouldn't matter who comes along
[47:25] it won't matter what comes your way
[47:27] you know hey you know what this is where
[47:29] god's will is for me
[47:30] i'm dialed right in because the spirit
[47:33] of god
[47:34] is speaking directly to my life i'm glad
[47:37] for that aren't you
[47:38] i'm glad so we're not wondering am i
[47:40] here where i am i have my there i
[47:41] understand sometimes that there might be
[47:43] this some move here and through there we
[47:45] understand that and i know that you
[47:46] understand that as well but i appreciate
[47:49] how god
[47:50] is so specific to our lives how that he
[47:53] cares so greatly what is that it's the
[47:55] comfort
[47:56] of the holy spirit because god's desire
[47:59] is that we would mature
[48:01] we grow and you can't grow if you're
[48:03] always wondering
[48:05] the only way you grow is where it's a
[48:07] settlement said you know what
[48:09] i know this is where i belong
[48:12] i'm in christ that's the first place to
[48:14] be
[48:15] because you can't mature until you're
[48:16] first born again
[48:19] that's that's the real comforter you can
[48:21] hear the word being preached but when it
[48:23] becomes inside of you
[48:25] that's when it becomes the comforter to
[48:27] you personally
[48:28] that no matter where you go you could be
[48:30] standing in the midst of the fire
[48:32] he's right there
[48:36] when they stood before the king and the
[48:38] king said what's your decision
[48:41] they said look we've prayed but we
[48:42] didn't pray whether or not we should
[48:44] bow we just had a little time of prayer
[48:47] just to
[48:48] we were just you know building up just
[48:50] just just talking to the lord
[48:51] thanking him for all of his goodness for
[48:54] all these days down here thanking him
[48:55] for providing for us
[48:57] down here in babylon what do you mean i
[48:58] sent that down no no god provided for us
[49:01] we're just giving thanks to god and so
[49:04] do you mean you didn't pray about
[49:05] whether or not
[49:06] to battle the image or go in the fire no
[49:09] no we weren't praying about that because
[49:10] there's no
[49:11] that that as far as we're concerned
[49:13] there's no choice in that
[49:16] our choice has been made a long time ago
[49:19] you see we've been redeemed we don't
[49:20] want our own choice
[49:23] it's a resolve that's in our life so
[49:25] they were just taking a time
[49:27] of prayer before they walked into the
[49:30] fiery furnace what was it it was comfort
[49:33] prayer is a time of comfort
[49:38] sometimes i understand you go go down
[49:42] through this
[49:43] congregation you say brother samuel shu
[49:46] there's times
[49:47] i mean in my prayer clause or this or
[49:50] that i just don't
[49:51] i don't know it's just not seem like
[49:53] it's times it's been a little hard to
[49:55] press through
[49:57] yeah what do i do well maybe get out and
[50:00] go for a drive
[50:02] go for a drive and just stop by the
[50:05] just start praying and start talking to
[50:07] him i'm not saying you have to do that
[50:09] you can stay right there in that car as
[50:10] well but i'm saying there's something
[50:12] about it with you that you desire to
[50:14] have fellowship with him
[50:16] and there's something about it that his
[50:19] presence
[50:20] it means everything to you when you're
[50:22] going through something
[50:24] his presence means everything that's why
[50:27] when moses could
[50:28] come back to this place he comes back
[50:30] here with all the people
[50:32] and god visits him and god lets him know
[50:36] my presence will go with you
[50:40] my angel i have sent he will keep you in
[50:43] the way
[50:43] and he will bring you unto the place
[50:46] that i have prepared for you
[50:49] what did moses do he rested in that
[50:52] promise he rested
[50:54] in the word of the lord you it was
[50:56] something that was per
[50:58] personal to him yes let me can i read
[51:01] just one more thing to you
[51:04] may have to give me a minute to find it
[51:05] but let me just let me just read it here
[51:09] you think of how that brother branham
[51:12] you know you would remember how he would
[51:13] talk about
[51:14] we're talking about being so anointed
[51:16] with the spirit of god where we're able
[51:18] to
[51:18] to be sensitive and as i said this is a
[51:21] time that we're
[51:22] it's not just now that we're in brother
[51:24] branham would deal with it in the age
[51:25] where he was that too where people were
[51:27] so busy and things and i also believe
[51:29] there's a lot of things prophetically
[51:30] that was seen but
[51:32] there's so much that when things
[51:35] themselves sometimes
[51:36] seem to be presented to us anymore that
[51:38] this is going to make life easier
[51:39] what it actually means is we're going to
[51:42] take more of your time
[51:45] you know what i mean we're bringing
[51:46] robots into work oh go go good
[51:48] that means i'm going to do five men's
[51:50] jobs
[51:51] everything becomes what's supposed to be
[51:53] easier becomes
[51:55] more pressure and more and everything
[51:57] around us
[51:58] and we have to fight through that
[51:59] pressure you have to fight through that
[52:02] pressure unless think of it as young
[52:03] people
[52:04] going to college and different ones
[52:06] college and trade schools
[52:07] hey there's things that that you that
[52:10] you have to do that when i went through
[52:12] college bachelors and masters i never
[52:15] had to do probably sister rebecca either
[52:16] we
[52:17] hey listen when we took a test it was in
[52:19] class
[52:20] it wasn't we're going to take every
[52:22] class day up and you'll take the test on
[52:24] sunday night
[52:26] online you know what i mean so
[52:29] everything is
[52:29] it's your time i mean used to be we can
[52:31] have certain times and
[52:32] have certain things here and there and
[52:34] there's pressure that comes our way
[52:37] brother simon what do i do draw comfort
[52:41] draw comfort that god knows exactly
[52:43] where you're at
[52:44] in the time of your life
[52:47] and i know some of you've heard me say
[52:49] this before and your pastor no doubt has
[52:50] said it many times
[52:51] it's not quantity it's quality
[52:57] you can give you could have a large
[52:59] quantity
[53:01] and it'd be no quality in it it's
[53:04] quality
[53:07] and sometimes in our life that's where
[53:09] it comes down to
[53:10] and every time it's quality but
[53:12] sometimes we have less time than others
[53:15] so don't let the enemy beat you up if oh
[53:17] i've got this all stacked up and
[53:18] i'm not able to listen to a message it
[53:20] might be a message that's taken you a
[53:21] month to get through
[53:22] but you're gleaning you're gleaning
[53:25] what are you doing drawing comfort
[53:28] you're drawing comfort
[53:29] through the midst of it so don't allow
[53:31] the enemy to beat you up about that way
[53:33] you've not done this and you
[53:34] no draw comfort
[53:37] i mean you could take two words in there
[53:39] in the scriptures jesus stood before
[53:41] lazarus jesus weapon you can whip the
[53:42] devil with it
[53:45] god became flesh amen
[53:48] god became me
[53:51] so i remember brother brahm talks about
[53:54] that that woman
[53:56] she saw that where brother brown was
[53:58] talking about compassion being in the
[54:00] body and you know
[54:01] you know there's a difference in in
[54:03] words they have the word uh
[54:05] empathy and sympathy sympathy is
[54:09] have been there been there empathy is
[54:13] i haven't been there but i feel for you
[54:18] and some of you probably have changed
[54:20] doctors because
[54:21] there's no empathy or sympathy everybody
[54:24] a
[54:25] bedside manner you know i remember honey
[54:27] if you're watching tonight forgive me
[54:31] i mean i remember you know what and this
[54:33] i guess this is the difference between
[54:34] man and woman you know
[54:36] for me i will go to the doctor okay come
[54:38] on let's go let's get it on you know
[54:41] let's go forward you know i was happy
[54:43] anyhow let me go on
[54:45] the you know you just want to move
[54:46] things on and i remember the one doctor
[54:48] that i had when we
[54:49] first got married well naturally my wife
[54:51] started going to that doctor
[54:52] and my wife had said honey she said i
[54:54] don't know he says
[54:55] she says i just don't care for that
[54:57] doctor
[54:58] it just seems like they just everything
[55:00] is just so
[55:02] you know no bedside manner and of course
[55:04] me you know
[55:06] i said would did you expect them to roll
[55:08] out the red carpet
[55:13] i didn't i didn't say it meaningfully
[55:15] you know so let's just sweeten it up a
[55:17] little bit you know
[55:18] but i you know brother kenny i didn't
[55:19] think like that to me it's just okay
[55:21] let's go i got things i want i want to
[55:22] move on you know
[55:23] but you begin to realize that with
[55:25] nurses josh isn't in here now
[55:27] but you got nurses that you know empathy
[55:30] and sympathy if you have somebody that
[55:31] comes in kind of gruff
[55:34] yeah i don't want them drawing blood
[55:35] from me
[55:37] give me the one who cares a little bit
[55:39] about i don't want to look like swiss
[55:41] cheese when i get out of here
[55:43] apparently we didn't get it that time
[55:45] i'll tell you what boy something wrong
[55:46] with your arm i think no
[55:48] you want somebody who cares you want
[55:50] somebody who takes a little bit of time
[55:51] and shows some
[55:52] empathy maybe they've never had that
[55:54] situation or something that's happened
[55:55] to them
[55:56] that's how it is among a body of
[55:58] believers
[55:59] as a local body of believers you know
[56:02] you say brother sam we're part of a
[56:03] worldwide
[56:04] we are we are brothers and sisters in
[56:07] christ
[56:08] but right here in this local fellowship
[56:10] this is where you hear prayer requests
[56:12] this is where you see the needs this is
[56:15] where you see one another
[56:16] this is where god puts a burden on your
[56:18] heart for somebody else
[56:20] god has assembled it that way that the
[56:23] members
[56:24] might have the same care one for another
[56:27] and have the same
[56:28] compassion
[56:34] it's like sometimes you have people that
[56:36] come by at a funeral and they'll say you
[56:37] get over it
[56:39] why didn't you just go on why did you
[56:41] even come through the line did it go on
[56:43] i mean people sometimes people that
[56:45] sometimes
[56:47] if you're one of those people forgive me
[56:49] but say god help me
[56:52] i mean you don't we don't know how one
[56:54] another's you don't know how somebody's
[56:55] feeling
[56:57] you don't know but the thing the
[56:58] greatest thing we can say is you know
[57:00] what
[57:00] i'm praying for you brother sister i'm
[57:03] praying for you you don't have we don't
[57:04] even have to know
[57:05] oh tell me all your troubles no i'm
[57:07] praying for you
[57:09] i'm praying for you send them a text
[57:11] praying for you
[57:13] i'm praying for you and when you receive
[57:14] the text don't don't let the enemy put
[57:16] it on your shoulder they must think i'm
[57:18] a backslider they must say
[57:19] no reject that devil god is ministering
[57:23] the care
[57:24] he's got others right here that are that
[57:27] are sensitive
[57:28] they may not have even seen you they're
[57:29] setting up three rows here
[57:31] and you're sitting back there but the
[57:33] spirit of god
[57:34] is mindful in the local body of
[57:38] jesus christ and he'll lay that upon our
[57:42] heart
[57:43] he'll move you hear out brother i'm
[57:44] talking about how if god would do that
[57:47] in a situation where brother random gets
[57:49] isolated in prayer
[57:50] would not come out for that meeting and
[57:52] he hears he hears somebody speaking in
[57:54] an unknown tongue in german language
[57:57] come to find
[57:58] out it was the spirit of god interceding
[58:01] for a sister who had got into an
[58:03] accident
[58:04] and god spared her life it's the spirit
[58:07] of god
[58:08] that moves through us to intercede on
[58:11] the behalf
[58:12] for one another there's experiences
[58:15] there's places where we've
[58:16] walked that it's true we've walked that
[58:19] way but just remember
[58:21] the test and the trial everything that's
[58:23] come your way
[58:24] it's not that tester trial was not just
[58:26] for you that was a testimony
[58:28] that can be shared to the glory of god
[58:31] because there could be somebody else
[58:33] in the assembly that's going through
[58:35] something and the enemy's trying to
[58:36] isolate them and here you give up
[58:38] and you stand up and give that testimony
[58:41] and the enemies told you
[58:42] oh there's nothing to it that ain't that
[58:44] much of a testimony
[58:45] but it means something to you and you
[58:47] watch as you give that testimony it'll
[58:50] poke
[58:51] holes in the enemy's artillery
[58:57] there's a compassion that goes out
[59:00] remember he talked about that woman i'm
[59:03] coming down
[59:04] i'm coming down that woman he talked
[59:07] about that baby
[59:09] remember brother having said how that
[59:11] that one woman she got up
[59:13] she kept feeling to pray for that baby
[59:16] and she finally went and she prayed for
[59:18] that baby
[59:20] and you remember when she came to the
[59:21] platform the spirit of god
[59:23] declared it your baby was already healed
[59:25] out here
[59:26] brother brown made the statement he said
[59:28] that mother because
[59:29] it was a mother she would have more
[59:33] compassion than i could have ever had
[59:37] it wasn't that brother none of us would
[59:38] call into question that brother branham
[59:40] had compassion
[59:41] but you see how god will use things this
[59:43] was a mother
[59:44] same thing god will use a father god
[59:46] will use a young person
[59:47] maybe i should say you know an older
[59:49] young person because brother kenny i'm
[59:51] still young
[59:51] 45 still consider myself young god will
[59:53] use us right brother paul
[59:55] we're still young so you can still do
[59:57] that to encourage
[59:58] to know those pathways there's a
[1:00:00] compassion that goes out
[1:00:03] let me close with this and it comforts
[1:00:06] us
[1:00:07] this is from bro this is brother neville
[1:00:09] he's praying i love this prayer this is
[1:00:10] in
[1:00:11] five definite identifications of the
[1:00:13] true church i mean
[1:00:15] my what what a title and what how
[1:00:17] brother neville prays here
[1:00:19] brother neville says father the great
[1:00:22] problems and the trials of tomorrow
[1:00:24] will seem as nothing as we're able to
[1:00:27] hold by hand and walk through with thee
[1:00:29] brother bram says truly lord the devil
[1:00:32] says we pray lord that thou would give
[1:00:34] us
[1:00:34] a deep seated compassion
[1:00:38] one for the other knowing that while one
[1:00:42] is in the deepness of trial and the
[1:00:45] hardness of testing that we too
[1:00:48] one of these days shall go through like
[1:00:50] circumstances
[1:00:51] god give us the spirit of jesus in us
[1:00:55] till we feel for each other enough
[1:00:59] until there will be unity between us
[1:01:02] and until we can serve thee together
[1:01:07] that's powerful it's the comfort of god
[1:01:10] you see
[1:01:10] paul as we read in our text here
[1:01:14] paul received comfort from god paul
[1:01:16] received comfort
[1:01:18] that even when they were in the midst of
[1:01:20] tests and trials
[1:01:22] titus coming to them and say hey paul
[1:01:27] the church is down there they're
[1:01:29] thriving
[1:01:31] he was in the midst of a test
[1:01:34] of a trial persecutions everything was
[1:01:38] all around him
[1:01:38] but here titus could come and say hey
[1:01:42] the church over there in thessalonica
[1:01:44] paul they're standing steadfast
[1:01:47] that was a comfort to him
[1:01:50] it's strengthening you you see what i'm
[1:01:52] saying he was he received
[1:01:54] sometimes there's things that we
[1:01:56] sometimes deal with having problems
[1:01:58] receiving god's sending us comfort
[1:02:02] god ministering things to us what should
[1:02:05] i do receive it

[1:02:26] you're the point of contact you're the
[1:02:28] you're the place where there can be a
[1:02:30] deep seated compassion

[1:02:37] house of god
[1:02:38] in the bride of jesus christ it is in
[1:02:41] the word of god and that's where comfort

[1:05:22] to where that word
[1:05:25] it becomes a living anchor in their life
[1:05:29] lord
[1:05:30] where it's not their strength any longer

[1:07:08] and help us to see that that's your
[1:07:11] humanity

[1:07:33] like you did to the hebrew children
[1:07:37] you never stopped the fire but you met
[1:07:40] him
[1:07:42] right there in the fire
[1:07:45] lord when i think about how your prophet
[1:07:48] said they went in there
[1:07:50] with bands on their wrist
[1:07:54] they couldn't raise their hands
[1:07:57] but when they got there in the midst of
[1:07:59] that fire what a paradox
[1:08:01] the fire did not burn their clothes
[1:08:05] they didn't even have the smell of smoke
[1:08:07] but the fire loosened
[1:08:10] the bands that was around their life
[1:08:14] lord jesus
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] i can't explain it but i i know it to be
[1:08:20] the truth i believe it
[1:08:22] i know it lord i know there's other
[1:08:23] witnesses right here with me as well
[1:08:26] how that lord through the midst of tests
[1:08:27] and trials
[1:08:29] it's lord you take lord of that fiery
[1:08:31] trial
[1:08:33] lord god it releases the bands
[1:08:38] from our lives
[1:08:41] lord jesus i pray right here tonight
[1:08:45] may the lord god
[1:08:48] just move to every heart right now
[1:08:51] i don't know what the need is the lord
[1:08:53] maybe it's lord with parents
[1:08:55] father mother maybe it's lord of
[1:08:57] marriage
[1:08:58] maybe lord it's a troubled soul maybe
[1:09:01] it's lord god
[1:09:02] financial situation i don't know
[1:09:06] but lord it's all met in you
[1:09:10] and i pray father right now that lord
[1:09:12] god where bitterness has wanted to
[1:09:14] collect
[1:09:16] where things lord god where the enemy
[1:09:19] has wanted to isolate it
[1:09:21] cause them to think that this is just
[1:09:23] happening to you
[1:09:24] you don't really belong to god look at
[1:09:26] these situations look at these things
[1:09:28] taking place around in your life
[1:09:31] and then lord as they begin to listen to
[1:09:33] it then things can begin to mount with
[1:09:35] the complex
[1:09:36] they begin to look at things differently
[1:09:38] and they're not able to receive things
[1:09:39] lord
[1:09:40] that they ought to receive
[1:09:43] coming from you
[1:09:46] satan i want you to know you're exposed
[1:09:48] tonight
[1:09:51] you're exposed for all of your lives
[1:09:55] what you've tried to hold over the head
[1:10:01] you're exposed in the name of the lord
[1:10:04] jesus christ
[1:10:06] we rebuke you
[1:10:09] take your hands off your thoughts every
[1:10:11] bit of your lies that you've told
[1:10:15] in the name of jesus christ we dismiss
[1:10:17] you from this place
[1:10:21] lord i pray right now may lord that same
[1:10:24] presence of the comforter may the lord
[1:10:27] god just invite you just to minister
[1:10:29] healing to their life
[1:10:30] lord you walking lord god
[1:10:33] as your prophet would describe it right
[1:10:35] there in the midst of the seven golden
[1:10:36] candle sticks

[1:10:39] know i know i know
[1:10:42] i know that poverty i know that
[1:10:43] tribulation i know
[1:10:46] and lord god it would as your prophet

[1:10:56] the person where they would think why
[1:10:59] doesn't he step in and stem the tide

[1:11:27] i think of lord how your prophet told us
[1:11:29] and souls in prison now
[1:11:30] he said jesus prayed to dodge the cross
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:35] lord jesus our flesh and our spirit does

[1:11:40] but the inner man the inner man is the
[1:11:43] one lord his truth
