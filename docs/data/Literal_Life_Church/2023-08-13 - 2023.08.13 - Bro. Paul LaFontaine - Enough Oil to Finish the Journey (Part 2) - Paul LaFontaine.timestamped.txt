[0:00] Kings if we go back in the Old Testament
[0:01] and I just want to continue our subject
[0:04] from last Sunday a little bit and we
[0:07] were preaching on enough oil to finish
[0:09] the journey enough oil to finish the
[0:11] journey this would be part two of that
[0:13] this morning Second Kings and because so
[0:16] many families are down at the camp I'm
[0:19] going to need extra amens this morning
[0:21] from all of those that are here
[0:24] in order to preach amen remember amen
[0:27] means succumb to the devil
[0:30] II Kings chapter four is where we want
[0:32] to read second Kings chapter four
[0:35] amen do you love the word of God
[0:38] amen and then I'm going to read before I
[0:40] forget I'm going to read this text and
[0:42] then we had an urgent prayer request
[0:43] from our brother Matthew Paulson just
[0:46] came in just a little while ago to a
[0:48] text and we want to remember him in
[0:50] prayer forgot to get it into the prayer
[0:51] requests so I'll read that and they're
[0:53] probably listening in this morning from
[0:55] South Carolina so we just want to read
[0:57] that I'm going to go ahead and read that
[0:58] before I read the text Brother Paulson
[1:00] says please remember our daughter
[1:02] Jessica in your prayers this morning she
[1:05] has been suffering from chronic lyme
[1:07] chronic lyme disease Rocky Mountain
[1:09] spotted fever and Bartonella she is
[1:12] having left side weakness slurred speech
[1:15] excruciating pain in her neck and head
[1:17] she said it feels like knives
[1:19] they also found more lesions in her
[1:22] brain she has been to ER two times
[1:24] within a week they have ran tests giving
[1:26] her medicine and nothing has helped she
[1:28] has seen several Specialists and is
[1:30] scheduled to see a neurologist tomorrow
[1:32] morning we know God can completely heal
[1:34] her please pray for us thank you brother
[1:36] sister Paulson they they listen in here
[1:39] from South Carolina and brother Paulson
[1:42] will definitely take Jessica to prayer
[1:44] this morning while we're opening the
[1:45] service and we pray God's healing for
[1:48] her we don't know why these things are
[1:49] happening but we pray it's so that God's
[1:52] glory can be revealed amen and I don't
[1:55] know if brother they mentioned sister
[1:57] Elizabeth's testimony but there was a
[1:59] positive report from Sister Elizabeth
[2:01] Murphy this morning that her uh the the
[2:05] in her bone marrow it's shrinking the
[2:07] cancer is shrinking a bit she's got a
[2:10] really good report this last week before
[2:12] she headed to Florida so they're very
[2:14] excited they're going to keep believing
[2:16] and holding up the word of God for her
[2:18] cancer we do not fear cancer here we do
[2:21] not fear any disease Lyme disease
[2:24] whatever it is there's nothing too big
[2:26] for our Lord so we stand by the banner
[2:28] of the blood of Jesus Christ for all
[2:30] these needs amen let's let's just read
[2:33] this morning second Kings chapter four
[2:35] now there cried a certain woman of the
[2:38] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[2:40] Elisha saying thy servant my husband is
[2:43] dead and thou knowest that thy servant
[2:45] did fear the lord and the Creditor is
[2:48] come to take unto him my two sons to be
[2:51] Bond men so it was very rough times down
[2:54] the road from when Elijah pronounced
[2:56] judgment on the whole generation the
[2:58] whole nation and so there this this
[3:01] godly woman is living under the Shadow
[3:03] and the gloominess and the debt and all
[3:06] that's happening and now they want to
[3:08] take her sons take her family under the
[3:10] debt creditors are coming she appeals to
[3:13] Elisha not Elijah Elisha and Elisha said
[3:16] unto her what shall I do for thee tell
[3:18] me what hast thou and thy house and she
[3:20] said thy handmaid hath not anything in
[3:23] the house save a pot of oil
[3:27] I don't have anything but a little pot
[3:29] of oil
[3:30] and then he said go borrow the vessels
[3:33] abroad of all thy neighbors even empty
[3:36] vessels borrow not a few and without
[3:39] when thou art come in Thou shalt shut
[3:42] the door upon thee and upon thy Sons
[3:45] and shall pour out into all those
[3:48] vessels and thou shalt set aside that
[3:50] which is full so this is not a public
[3:53] show the third poll is not a public show
[3:55] shut yourself in your house with your
[3:58] sons and start pouring that oil into
[4:01] these vessels she went from him and shut
[4:03] the door upon her and upon her sons who
[4:05] brought the vessels to her and she
[4:07] poured out and it came to pass when the
[4:09] vessels were full that she said unto her
[4:12] son bring me yet a vessel and he said
[4:13] there is not a vessel more and the oil
[4:16] stayed
[4:19] glory be to God and the oil stayed
[4:25] and then she came and told the man of
[4:27] God and he said go sell the oil pay thy
[4:31] debt and live thou and thy Children of
[4:34] the rest praise be to God Heavenly
[4:36] Father we pray you'll bless and anoint
[4:38] the word this morning every soul that's
[4:40] listening today is important to you
[4:43] every life wherever they may be is
[4:45] important to your economy and Lord God I
[4:48] pray that you would anoint us today to
[4:50] get out of the way and your anointing
[4:52] would come through and the word would
[4:54] come through and Lord that you would
[4:55] break every stronghold of the enemy Lord
[4:58] that you would break down barriers today
[5:00] Lord we have this urgent request father
[5:02] from our brother Polson for Jessica
[5:04] we're going to as a congregation lift
[5:06] her up Lord into your presence this
[5:09] morning under your care the great
[5:12] physician now is here the sympathizing
[5:15] Jesus Lord I pray that you would honor a
[5:18] father's faith and our faith this
[5:20] morning and Jessica's faith we don't
[5:23] know what's going on but I pray father
[5:24] you'd get to the bottom of it Lord and
[5:27] that you would heal her that you would
[5:29] restore her that you take away not only
[5:31] the symptoms but the cause of this we
[5:33] curse it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:35] Christ that you bring glory to yourself
[5:37] Lord and we commit it now to you leaving
[5:39] it in your hands completely we pray
[5:42] you'll bless the service bless the
[5:44] service down at the camp today bless all
[5:47] those are gathering Lord May our young
[5:48] people be filled with the Holy Ghost May
[5:51] our young people be filled with the Holy
[5:53] Ghost Lord not some type of emotion but
[5:56] Lord the real genuine filling of the
[5:58] Holy Ghost I pray and then Lord if
[6:01] someone gets emotional Lord we're
[6:03] thankful for that too we praise God
[6:05] because we know Lord when there's a
[6:07] change in a life then we know Lord we're
[6:09] bound to get emotional we're cry we'll
[6:12] express ourselves to you we'll Worship
[6:14] You Lord because we know that you're
[6:16] doing something in our lives we pray
[6:18] you'll bless the word and bless our time
[6:20] together today every visitor that's here
[6:22] we just place in your hands in Jesus
[6:25] name we ask it amen amen God bless you
[6:28] once you shake your hands again with
[6:29] your neighbor there before you're seated
[6:31] and God bless you each one now we just
[6:34] want to uh continue on with our subject
[6:38] here this morning
[6:39] and uh last time we last time we talked
[6:43] about this we read in Matthew 25 the
[6:47] mystery under the seventh seal which the
[6:49] seventh seal is the coming of the Lord
[6:51] so in Matthew 25 we have three Parables
[6:54] that are related to the seventh seal or
[6:56] the coming of the Lord and that Parable
[6:59] spoke about the first Parable spoke
[7:01] about was about the oil that was
[7:04] essential to finish the journey it's
[7:07] about five wise virgins five foolish
[7:09] virgins and the only difference in the
[7:11] two there wasn't hardly there wasn't
[7:13] hardly any difference in those two
[7:15] groups Gathering they were virgins they
[7:18] were Sanctified they loved the Lord they
[7:20] took the journey and the message to go
[7:22] meet the bridegroom they were all in the
[7:23] same group but the only difference is
[7:25] one had oil in their laps the other
[7:27] didn't have oil in their laps and so we
[7:29] were speaking about this oil that is
[7:32] needed at the end time the last thing
[7:35] that they needed for the last leg of the
[7:38] journey was oil the only thing the main
[7:41] thing and so if that's a theme right now
[7:44] in the last days for our lives then we
[7:47] should be saying Lord there's one thing
[7:49] most important in me in my family's life
[7:52] do we have the oil and do we have enough
[7:55] of the Holy Spirit to finish the journey
[7:58] that's that should be dominating our
[8:01] minds more than any business adventure
[8:03] more than any family problem more than
[8:06] any sickness Lord do I have the oil
[8:10] and he made it the most prominent thing
[8:12] in the parable of the seventh seal and
[8:14] the coming of the Lord and so it became
[8:16] essential uh what I'm basically
[8:18] preaching is essential oil
[8:24] this is this the real essential oil
[8:27] that I'm preaching about and so now the
[8:31] foolish virgins they discovered that
[8:33] they didn't have it the last minute they
[8:35] discovered they had everything and they
[8:37] loved the Lord and they had all this but
[8:39] they discovered they didn't have the oil
[8:41] they came in the message to pursue the
[8:44] bridegroom they heard the midnight cry
[8:47] because when it says midnight how many
[8:49] know what it says midnight that's at the
[8:51] darkest time so it was at the darkest
[8:54] hour when the world had become dark when
[8:56] it had become full of perversion in
[8:58] everything that it was at that time the
[9:01] Midnight Cry the final cry went out rise
[9:04] up it's time to meet the bridegroom and
[9:06] take the last the last step of the
[9:09] journey to meet the bridegroom
[9:12] and so they were virgins they were
[9:14] Sanctified they they
[9:16] rejoiced in all this cry they they
[9:19] actually woke up to the cry it wasn't
[9:22] just the wise virgins that woke up they
[9:24] woke up too they all woke up I heard the
[9:26] cry I heard the Midnight Cry and they
[9:29] all were trimmed their lamps all were
[9:31] the same as far as tripping they were
[9:33] pure good people the prophet mentions
[9:35] they were pure good people Sanctified
[9:38] vessels of God
[9:40] but lacking the oil to take the final
[9:44] leg of the journey
[9:47] and that's pretty serious I can't preach
[9:49] it any more serious than what the
[9:51] parable gives it it's for our time it's
[9:53] for right now and so now if that's the
[9:55] essential thing there shouldn't be any
[9:57] other more essential thing in our lives
[10:00] except Lord every teenager ought to be
[10:02] saying I can't get in on my parents
[10:04] coattail every teenager should be going
[10:06] to God and say that's what the parable
[10:08] said my God warned me that the only
[10:11] thing lacking was the oil I better make
[10:12] sure God I'm seeking the Holy Ghost
[10:15] for myself
[10:17] if my dad don't have it my mom don't
[10:19] have it it doesn't matter I've got to
[10:21] seek this for myself it's more important
[10:23] than anything in life
[10:24] how many would say Amen to that
[10:26] if Jesus said it was important and
[10:29] that's the parable we're living in right
[10:30] now and you're interested in the coming
[10:32] of the Lord and you're interested in
[10:34] meeting the bridegroom if you're
[10:36] interested in that then you have to have
[10:38] the oil
[10:40] you have to have the Holy Spirit you
[10:42] have to know that you have the Holy
[10:45] Spirit in your life not just that you
[10:46] love God but there's an identification
[10:48] of the depth of your soul that I believe
[10:51] this word of this hour and I'm following
[10:53] it as best I can with all of my heart
[10:56] my goodness so important I want to
[10:59] remind just now some things of the final
[11:01] summary I gave of Matthew 25 last Sunday
[11:04] and then we'll go into to some things
[11:06] today it is foolish here's my summary of
[11:08] Matthew 25. it's foolish to pursue
[11:10] Christ the bridegroom without the oil
[11:13] first
[11:14] that's actually what they did they began
[11:16] the journey without the oil discovered
[11:18] they didn't have it
[11:19] you have nothing but trouble along the
[11:21] way if you try to pursue the bridegroom
[11:23] without the oil
[11:25] be nothing but trouble
[11:28] so like I said last Sunday I just want
[11:30] to encourage you I want to challenge you
[11:32] rebuke you whatever the Lord would use
[11:35] me to do to say you have to take this
[11:37] before God yourself but I won't sit by
[11:40] and just Pat people on the shoulder and
[11:42] say you're okay you're okay when I don't
[11:44] want to deceive Anybody Everybody
[11:46] personally on their own level needs to
[11:49] go to God and say Lord do I have this if
[11:51] I'm lacking it if I do have it I need
[11:54] more of it can I get an amen
[11:57] and maybe in the next few weeks I'll
[11:58] talk about what the Holy Ghost is what
[12:00] it is not so we have a greater
[12:02] understanding because the Holy Ghost is
[12:04] one of the most debated confused
[12:07] subjects Even in our own ranks it's so
[12:10] confused sometimes and I can tell you
[12:12] God did not do that God is not the
[12:14] author of confusion God has told us
[12:16] straight in the word and straight in the
[12:18] message so there'll be no confusion it's
[12:20] the devil that takes young hearts and
[12:22] old hearts and confuses them about the
[12:24] very thing that they need the essential
[12:27] oil and Satan confuses people about it
[12:30] and so maybe we'll go into that we'll
[12:32] see how the Lord leads but today I want
[12:34] to remind you number one it is foolish
[12:36] to pursue Christ the bridegroom without
[12:38] the oil first it's gambling with your
[12:41] life to think that trimming your lap
[12:43] every now and then
[12:45] is enough
[12:47] isn't that what the parable says they
[12:50] were trimming their lap I'm going to
[12:52] church I'm being in the message I'm in a
[12:55] message church and it is is gambling
[12:57] with your life to think that trimming my
[12:59] lap every now and then in church or
[13:01] being stirred to wake up by the Midnight
[13:03] Cry is enough it was not enough
[13:06] it is not enough to depend on others
[13:08] it's not enough today to only open your
[13:11] Bible just at church it's not enough to
[13:13] overcome this Midnight Hour of Darkness
[13:15] with just being a good boy it's more
[13:18] than being a good boy it's more than
[13:19] being a good girl it's not enough to
[13:21] wear the right clothes it's not enough
[13:23] just to attend a message Church you have
[13:26] to have the whole true Holy Spirit the
[13:29] oil in your life
[13:31] excuse me for being so straight but you
[13:34] can't get any more straight than what
[13:35] the parable preaches to you some were
[13:38] lacking oil and they discovered it and
[13:40] they said oh can and then they tried to
[13:42] depend on and take from oil from the
[13:44] other ones and they said wait a minute
[13:45] wait a minute and I feel like I have to
[13:47] say that to people sometimes because
[13:49] people can be so needy and they're
[13:51] claiming something what's their what
[13:53] they're cleaning to clinging to
[13:54] sometimes is their own lack of the Holy
[13:56] Ghost themselves and they see the
[13:58] strength in you but you see now I'm
[14:00] saying I I've got enough just for myself
[14:03] to finish the journey
[14:05] that's what they said the wiser we only
[14:07] have enough for ourselves to finish this
[14:09] journey go to them that buy and sell go
[14:12] get it yourself
[14:15] come through the same thing do the same
[14:17] thing it's sell out to yourself to get
[14:21] what's needed and I want to say this
[14:23] lastly about Matthew 25 it's about
[14:26] having what's needed to finish this
[14:29] journey
[14:32] it's not that you started this journey
[14:34] in the message
[14:37] it's about
[14:38] how you end
[14:41] can I get any help this morning it's not
[14:44] that you start praise the Lord that you
[14:45] started praise the Lord that you believe
[14:47] praise the Lord that you set on a
[14:49] journey to see the bridegroom praise the
[14:52] Lord you started but for my all the
[14:54] Bible things Bible scriptures that I
[14:56] read and I'm going to read some to you
[14:57] this morning it's not about just that
[14:59] you started it's how you end it's how
[15:02] the the journey ends can you say amen
[15:04] and how tragic it would be that you
[15:06] started the journey but now you're kind
[15:08] of doubting and you're kind of phasing
[15:10] out no no this is not the time to phase
[15:12] out this is not the time to stop praying
[15:15] it's the time to pray more
[15:18] this is not the time to become more
[15:21] worldly and Dabble and more worldly
[15:22] things it's the time to become more
[15:24] sanctified
[15:26] wouldn't you say Amen the last hour the
[15:29] last leg of the trip the last run of the
[15:32] race it's not the time to be Dilly
[15:34] dallying around it's time to run with
[15:36] all of our hearts it's trying to go
[15:38] forward can you say Amen
[15:41] it's not the time to get Lexa days ago
[15:42] it's not the time to get loose it's not
[15:44] the time to look for things you can get
[15:46] by with is that the time I think of
[15:49] Jesus when he was in the garden his last
[15:51] hours there it got so dark and his
[15:53] disciples he took him in to pray they
[15:55] fell asleep in the garden
[15:57] they all fell asleep because why did
[15:59] they fall asleep they didn't recognize
[16:01] the hour that they were in this is it
[16:03] this is a wrap up and it's not a time to
[16:06] sleep it's time to pray Brothers I need
[16:09] your prayers but they couldn't do it
[16:11] because they didn't recognize the hour
[16:12] anybody who recognizes this hour right
[16:14] now the final seconds we're not three
[16:17] minutes before midnight we're just a few
[16:19] seconds before midnight and anybody who
[16:21] catches that Revelation is not praying
[16:24] less they're praying more they're not
[16:26] they're not they're not pulling away and
[16:28] getting more bitter they're saying Lord
[16:30] Heal My bitterness take me closer to you
[16:34] anybody who recognizes where we're at
[16:36] right now there's going to be changes in
[16:38] their life
[16:39] the oil is the most essential thing
[16:42] and I want to live and I want to be
[16:44] filled with it and so you know that's
[16:46] the thing is the is the final stage of
[16:48] the journey the final leg this is not a
[16:50] time to be dabbling and playing around
[16:52] and playing church it's not the time for
[16:54] it and when Jesus was in that Garden
[16:55] that's what I was finishing Jesus was
[16:57] sitting there he come and woke him up he
[16:59] said go ahead and take your rest now but
[17:01] he said this hour the Bible says that
[17:04] Jesus he prayed he come and found the
[17:07] sleeping he prayed again and the Bible
[17:09] says he prayed more earnestly than he'd
[17:12] ever prayed
[17:14] in Jesus Final hours
[17:17] it was not this attitude this is all
[17:19] wrapped up anyway it's just about over
[17:23] I'm predestinated to do this
[17:26] oh how many predestinated people that
[17:29] think they're so predestinated and we
[17:30] heard it Wednesday night from Brother
[17:32] rap I love to say Amen to the truths of
[17:34] predestination I believe God knew me
[17:36] before the foundation of the world but
[17:38] that doesn't justify laziness that
[17:40] actually should build Faith to say I'm
[17:42] one of them and I'm going to finish this
[17:44] journey well I'm going to finish this
[17:46] journey filled with the Holy Ghost
[17:48] it's not the things that I'm predestined
[17:50] Jesus said well this whole thing's
[17:51] predestinated anyway I'm supposed to go
[17:53] to the crossing and so he just lays back
[17:55] and he said you know what you guys are
[17:56] sleeping make some room for me I'm going
[17:58] to lay down and take a nap too the Bible
[18:00] says he prayed more interesting he
[18:02] didn't pray less he prayed more he
[18:04] entered in more anybody hearing what I'm
[18:06] saying this morning
[18:08] and so in the darkest hour the final leg
[18:11] of the journey that's not the time to
[18:13] play around can you say amen that's not
[18:16] the time to be doing something less
[18:17] that's not the time to be moving along
[18:20] in the social media with the direction
[18:22] that the defectors are going and the
[18:25] people who left the message and keep in
[18:27] your eye man look what they're getting
[18:28] to do now look at oh look what they get
[18:30] to wear now this is not the time to be
[18:32] looking at them
[18:34] if they keep going they're fitted for
[18:36] Destruction are you called to that no
[18:38] you're not called to that it's not a
[18:40] time to loosen up and say God I need
[18:42] more of you
[18:43] somebody say Amen this it's not a time
[18:46] to be just just say oh they say we're
[18:49] here we're going to finish it up let's
[18:51] finish well let's finish the last leg
[18:53] well let's run with patience or race
[18:56] success before us
[18:59] it's about finishing well it's not that
[19:01] you had enough to start it's about you
[19:04] had enough oil to start it's about you
[19:06] have enough to end it's about finishing
[19:08] it's not that you started I'll come back
[19:10] to that in just a minute with all the
[19:12] scriptures that talked about talk about
[19:13] God's interested how we finish not just
[19:16] that we start with the Lord
[19:17] we find here in the text of Second Kings
[19:20] chapter four that it is it's another
[19:23] witness in the Old Testament of the last
[19:26] days essential thing because anytime you
[19:29] read scriptures about Elijah or Elisha
[19:32] you're talking about our day because how
[19:34] many would say in Malachi 4 it says
[19:36] he'll send Elijah the prophet before the
[19:38] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[19:40] and I we believe he has sent that that
[19:43] Ministry is done it's over he's
[19:45] fulfilled that scripture Malachi fulfill
[19:47] if you're listening on the broadcast or
[19:49] any other way come and talk to me
[19:50] because there's been a lot of Prophecy
[19:52] fulfilled that people don't know it's
[19:53] been fulfilled it's been fulfilled
[19:55] already and we're living in the time of
[19:57] that right now and so now because we're
[20:00] in the days of when Elijah was fulfilled
[20:02] when we go in the Old Testament and read
[20:04] about Elijah and Elisha we're right in
[20:06] our time the types and shadows apply to
[20:09] us and we can say I'm living right here
[20:11] well in this chapter it's not Elijah
[20:13] because he went up in a chariot and he
[20:16] passed the ministry on to Elijah because
[20:18] Elijah asked for it he said I'm praying
[20:20] what's your prayer what do you want of
[20:22] all things how do you write what do you
[20:24] want above all things she's poor she
[20:26] could have asked for anything all the
[20:28] money in the world and God would have
[20:29] given it to her sister how do you write
[20:31] in that example but she said of all
[20:33] things I want the salvation of my two
[20:36] sons and she got it can you say Amen
[20:40] she got it
[20:42] got it and so when we come to Elisha he
[20:44] says to Elijah what do you want Elijah
[20:46] says what do you want Elijah says
[20:48] that a double portion of your spirit
[20:51] would fall on me
[20:53] Hallelujah
[20:56] oh my what a request
[20:59] that's what you asked for that's what
[21:01] I'm going to give you you know you have
[21:03] to ask for things
[21:05] God doesn't just hand it to you
[21:08] so when he comes about you ask whatever
[21:10] you come to Hattie wrightboy you you
[21:12] better think that through and from the
[21:13] depths of the soul the Lord knew what
[21:15] she was going to ask for something came
[21:17] ask for the right thing Elisha said you
[21:19] know what I want a double portion of the
[21:20] spirit so now Elijah goes off the scene
[21:22] and Elisha she bride it's not the
[21:27] masculine part it's the feminine part
[21:28] now everything we read about Elisha now
[21:32] is typing I wanted to say first of all
[21:34] there's so many types in this that I
[21:36] don't have enough time today to preach
[21:38] on all the types another thing is I like
[21:41] to keep my jacket on so I look proper
[21:43] and good but it's too hot today so I'm
[21:45] taking my jacket off which means that
[21:48] I'll probably preach even harder
[21:52] Hallelujah
[21:54] so now uh and by the way I just wanted
[21:57] to mention that if you ever notice now
[21:59] when I go over like this my tie stays
[22:02] straight it doesn't fall down there's a
[22:04] reason for that and she doesn't want me
[22:06] to embarrass her but sister strew
[22:09] sitting in the back to embarrass her
[22:11] even more
[22:12] sister's true and my wife and probably
[22:14] many other women get frustrated when
[22:16] preachers ties go all out of sorts
[22:18] they're going everywhere and so sister's
[22:21] true she thought on this for probably 20
[22:23] years I imagine and she said I've got to
[22:26] develop something for this problem in
[22:28] Preachers so I'm going to reveal the
[22:30] secret over National Television
[22:34] sisters Drew sewed together something
[22:36] here that you put your tie and it comes
[22:38] under the buttons it's an amazing
[22:40] invention
[22:43] I asked if she had the copyright on it
[22:45] yet
[22:46] I'll do it and I'll make the royalties
[22:48] off of it
[22:49] it holds the tie in while preachers are
[22:53] jumping all over
[22:57] it's um it's an amazing it invention
[23:01] it's incredible such
[23:03] talented people in this church
[23:09] she has a lot of other talents besides
[23:11] that but this is a good one
[23:14] and and you know just quickly somebody
[23:16] laid a bunch of neckties out on the
[23:20] table to give away to everybody last
[23:22] Sunday that's just a bunch of neckties I
[23:24] want to say thank you for that
[23:26] appreciate that
[23:28] somebody paid their tithes
[23:33] and they didn't do it secretly they laid
[23:35] it out on the table
[23:37] so God bless you for that and here you
[23:39] Brothers need tithes you can have some
[23:41] of my ties
[23:47] there's so many types about Elijah and
[23:49] Elisha concerning this day I don't have
[23:52] time but I want to bring out one first
[23:53] of all and that is Elisha and Elijah
[23:56] both
[23:57] had meetings with widows with women
[24:00] and they were widows and they were
[24:02] living in a dark time both of them and
[24:04] they had a need during the dark time
[24:06] that's a type of the Bride because we
[24:07] live in the darkest times we live in a
[24:10] time of debt spiritually can you say
[24:12] Amen we're in in debt the world's in
[24:14] debt spiritually we're in a time that
[24:16] they want to take our children how many
[24:17] raise your hand they want to take our
[24:19] children
[24:19] so all these scenarios are here and both
[24:21] these women had some Elijah came to one
[24:24] Elisha came to another one and it's
[24:25] interesting how they dealt with them
[24:27] they let they lived in famine they lived
[24:29] in debt they lived in depressing times
[24:31] they lived in a time of loss they were
[24:33] barely getting by but then the scripture
[24:36] says in chapter four I read you but in
[24:38] the middle of that there cried a woman
[24:40] under those conditions a woman cried now
[24:43] wasn't there other people crying during
[24:46] that time wasn't there other women
[24:47] crying I'd say there was I'd say because
[24:50] of the depressing times and the debt and
[24:52] all the the depression there was
[24:54] probably other women that had tears and
[24:56] and that's fine God knows about that too
[24:58] but yet God this this one these women
[25:02] got God's attention their cry got God's
[25:05] attention
[25:07] and so now that's a wonderful thing to
[25:09] recognize that they both went to Widow
[25:11] women and that was to their that was
[25:13] their mystery because Elijah he had a
[25:14] dispensational Ministry he spoke to the
[25:17] whole nation he brought a curse on
[25:18] Jezebel he brought a curse on Ahab and
[25:21] the whole house which was a Jehovah
[25:23] Jireh believing King he was the king of
[25:25] Israel but he married the wrong woman
[25:28] and so now Elijah came to put a curse on
[25:30] all that thing and he stopped up the
[25:32] Heavens there was no rain there was
[25:34] famine in the land all the conditions a
[25:36] lot of the oh boy let me say it a lot of
[25:39] the conditions we're in right now is
[25:41] because Elijah came in this hour and he
[25:43] spoke the word and our nation and our
[25:45] world rejected Elijah and that's why
[25:48] we're in the conditions that we're in
[25:50] so remember that can you say Amen it's
[25:52] because Elijah has come that we live in
[25:55] these conditions
[25:57] but the bride has to live in it until
[25:58] the Rapture time the bride's living in
[26:00] these conditions and so there was others
[26:02] crying but this one got their attention
[26:04] and they went to these women so now I
[26:06] want you to notice something else there
[26:07] was a change in leadership from it was
[26:10] the same message but it was a bit of
[26:13] change in leadership from Elijah to
[26:14] Elijah because we know that Elijah had a
[26:17] double portion of the spirit of the
[26:18] Prophet but the change in the manner the
[26:20] pro the prophet said Elijah was bold
[26:23] Elijah called fire down from heaven he
[26:26] spoke to the entire dispensation Elijah
[26:28] he rebuked the whole generation his
[26:31] indictment was to the whole religious
[26:32] system he spoke boldly to Jezebel but
[26:35] Elisha Elisha he didn't do all that he
[26:39] didn't speak judgment to the whole uh
[26:40] generation and dispensation he didn't
[26:43] have to Elijah had already done it it's
[26:46] not to the whole generation but Elijah's
[26:49] Ministry was more to the personal effect
[26:54] it wasn't to the nation it was more to
[26:57] the person
[26:59] it was to Naaman it was to this widow
[27:02] woman it was dealing personally and
[27:04] anytime he got involved with preachers
[27:05] it didn't go so well remember when he
[27:07] first was first finished there they were
[27:10] looking for Elijah they said we're gonna
[27:12] we're gonna go find Elijah would you
[27:13] come with us he said you know Elijah's
[27:15] gone on The Chariot they're trying to
[27:17] bring Elijah back
[27:19] they're trying to act like Elijah's
[27:21] still here
[27:23] they're trying to say brother Brown's
[27:25] going to speak for us tonight
[27:27] and I'm going he is
[27:30] he's not here
[27:31] he did his ministry he's gone under his
[27:33] reward and you're saying to the young
[27:35] people brother Branham will be our
[27:37] speaker tonight there's something not
[27:38] right about that
[27:40] now I believe in the voice I believe he
[27:42] brought us back to the word I believe
[27:44] and listen to the voice but to say he's
[27:46] here he's not here he's gone unto his
[27:48] reward
[27:50] and there's a change in administration
[27:52] from the hymn to the she from Elijah to
[27:55] Elisha and I'm telling you Elijah spoke
[27:58] to the whole He indicted the entire
[28:01] religious system not the people but he
[28:04] indicted the entire religious system for
[28:07] crucifying the Son of God afresh again
[28:11] but Elisha when he came he didn't do
[28:13] that
[28:14] it was more of a personal level to meet
[28:16] the god meaning the personal needs
[28:18] personal Revival not a national Revival
[28:21] a personal healing to individuals a
[28:24] personal restoration to individuals not
[28:27] judgment now I want to say to you that
[28:30] God is still a god of judgment
[28:32] and God may put us back in line when
[28:34] we're out of line but for the most part
[28:37] we're not here now to pronounce judgment
[28:39] like Elijah did anytime a pastor or
[28:42] Minister today tries to be the prophet
[28:44] and pronounce judgment on everything
[28:46] he's out of his office
[28:52] Elijah's already done that
[28:55] anytime a pastor tries to take it into
[28:57] his own hands to pronounce judgment
[28:59] especially individually to somebody he
[29:01] can give discernment he can give counsel
[29:03] but when he takes it his hand pronounced
[29:05] judgment over the whole thing he's taken
[29:07] the office of a prophet and you're not a
[29:09] prophet you're a pastor
[29:11] that's why you hurt people can I get an
[29:13] amen from somebody stay in your office
[29:16] they listen so much to the prophet that
[29:18] they think okay this is the way I'm
[29:19] going to do it with my own congregation
[29:20] not always you're not a prophet you're a
[29:22] pastor
[29:24] the manner has changed the leadership
[29:25] has changed don't try to be a prophet to
[29:28] the people God's already a sinner
[29:29] Prophet but try to be a pastor to the
[29:31] people and let me just say this we need
[29:33] more truly God called Pastors in this
[29:36] message
[29:38] we don't need somebody to try to be a
[29:40] prophet to us we didn't we don't need
[29:42] this great teacher to expound upon and
[29:44] bring us all the answers we need
[29:46] teachers but not one with all the
[29:48] answers can you say man God's pointing
[29:50] us back to the word he's given us a
[29:52] message that's the only message we have
[29:53] to preach and now we be in our calling
[29:56] to minister to the people as God given
[29:58] us thank God he called me to be a pastor
[30:00] 35 years ago I don't know why he did I
[30:02] still ask the Lord why have you done
[30:04] this why did you choose me to do this
[30:05] but I can't get away from it it's my
[30:07] burden it's my calling and I'm going to
[30:09] keep doing it until the rapture
[30:14] Elijah pronounced Judgment of the whole
[30:16] system Jezebel he wasn't afraid of jezel
[30:18] he was Bo just telling it like it is
[30:21] and but but Elisha his manner was more
[30:24] to the personal thing and I just want to
[30:27] say once again about judgment the bride
[30:29] is the true bride is no longer under the
[30:30] judgments of God
[30:33] she has the Holy Ghost she's past
[30:34] judgment so why do you keep bringing
[30:37] judgment on the bride she's past
[30:39] judgment
[30:42] praise the Lord
[30:44] you say what about when Elisha called
[30:47] two she Bears Out of the Woods because
[30:49] he got offended at his complex about his
[30:51] bald head
[30:54] oh I got another sermon
[30:56] one of the things preachers needs to do
[30:59] two or three things preachers have to
[31:01] grow out of personally in their walk
[31:03] with God they've got to grow out of
[31:04] their complexes
[31:07] because sometimes they preach their
[31:08] complexes and not the word of God
[31:11] in that day
[31:13] if you think that he was that's the day
[31:15] that Elisha was acting like Elijah a
[31:17] little bit because he's going to call
[31:19] the sea Bears out and kill those kids
[31:21] and brother Brown said he that was not
[31:23] the holy spirit that was him acting in
[31:26] his own way
[31:27] but it looked like Elijah he's getting
[31:29] out of Step his ministry wasn't Elijah
[31:31] to pronounce judgment like that it was
[31:33] Elisha and so he acted out of place he
[31:36] made a mistake
[31:40] did I say that on National
[31:43] he made a mistake
[31:46] and he preached his own complex
[31:49] should we go through the Bible and talk
[31:51] about Moses the great prophet who made a
[31:54] mistake
[31:55] and one day struck the rock twice
[31:57] because of his frustration with the
[31:59] people and his temper got up to the
[32:02] people so bad he was supposed to strike
[32:04] at once and struck it twice made a
[32:06] mistake God said the Earth temper that
[32:09] thing
[32:10] you're not even going in the Promised
[32:11] Land
[32:14] it's in your Bible everybody hold your
[32:16] Bible it's it's in there
[32:21] God's true Prophet definitely
[32:24] but he made a mistake there he got in
[32:26] the flesh
[32:27] and so Elisha that's the one time I
[32:30] don't know why I'm elaborating on this
[32:31] it's not in my notes but I like to say
[32:33] that he called them out he shouldn't
[32:34] have done that because once again it's
[32:36] this whole thing is that the
[32:37] administration or the leadership had
[32:39] changed under Elijah even though the
[32:41] spirit was the double portion the
[32:43] administration of it changed a bit
[32:44] because it was not to speak to the
[32:46] nation there was not to be a national
[32:48] Revival that was that day he called fire
[32:50] down and then Israel they all they come
[32:52] around that he did Elijah was to do that
[32:54] can you say man around the country
[32:56] almost in every major city in this
[32:58] nation Elijah spoke
[33:02] now Elisha he ministers and he ministers
[33:05] personally it's not a national Revival
[33:08] and so now one of the things that Elisha
[33:12] does clearly is when someone has a need
[33:18] he always asks for them to do something
[33:20] first
[33:22] before he meets the need now Elijah had
[33:25] the power if somebody was out of money
[33:27] or somebody Elijah he'd just say okay
[33:29] it's yours that's it it's yours but
[33:31] somehow with Elias Elisha he's asking
[33:34] for them to do something
[33:36] and then they get their miracle
[33:40] Naaman was struck with Leprosy and he
[33:42] comes sinned he didn't even go himself
[33:44] he said you you go and tell Naaman he
[33:47] needs to dip seven times in the dirtiest
[33:50] River in all of Israel Jordan he needs
[33:54] to go dip seven times and then he'll
[33:56] receive my healing now this is a great
[33:57] man and he's and he doesn't even come
[34:00] himself my dad used to say that the
[34:02] servant knocked on the door and Naaman
[34:04] came to the door and it servant he said
[34:06] I asked for Elisha to come he said
[34:08] Elijah said he's not coming he just sent
[34:10] me his servant
[34:13] well I want to see the man I want to see
[34:17] the pastor himself
[34:19] good thing he didn't have that attitude
[34:22] but he says um
[34:24] he said if you go down and dip seven
[34:27] times in Jordan
[34:29] you'll be healed
[34:32] just at that moment is a test of your
[34:34] faith
[34:37] but it's God asking you to do something
[34:39] dirty not dirty in the sense of sinful
[34:42] but doing something that's not
[34:43] convenient not easy sometimes for some
[34:46] people they can't even come to the altar
[34:48] there's been people coming to this
[34:49] church I've never seen them at the altar
[34:50] I've never seen him repented except for
[34:52] healing for their body they never come
[34:54] to repent they don't have to repent
[34:56] now you don't have to come to the altar
[34:58] but sometimes God asks us to do
[35:00] something
[35:02] not to embarrass us but to show that
[35:04] we're real and we're going to be honest
[35:06] I need to repent
[35:10] not enough repentance last Sunday we're
[35:12] so glad to see a few in the altar
[35:14] repenting because God had made a call
[35:16] last Sunday for repentance I rejoice in
[35:18] those who came but I'll tell you I'm I'm
[35:20] praying for a lot but whether it's in
[35:22] your seat or here it's a call to
[35:24] repentance in this hour what's being
[35:26] preached it's a call for your life to
[35:28] repent before God
[35:31] so go and dip seven times okay all right
[35:35] I'll go do it and maybe he was grumbling
[35:37] the whole time I wanted to see Elijah I
[35:39] wanted to see the guy and he goes down
[35:41] this is the muddiest river in in all of
[35:44] Israel the Jordan why couldn't he pick
[35:46] this how could he why why do I have to
[35:48] do this why do I have to wear this
[35:54] why did the prophet say to do it this
[35:55] way
[35:57] why was he so specific about
[36:00] shorts
[36:06] pretty quiet in here
[36:09] I'll just say to you
[36:11] you're better off in life
[36:13] to not mess with God's absolutes
[36:18] if he laid an absolute in there there's
[36:20] a reason for it it's not a Hell or
[36:23] Heaven issue but it's put there for a
[36:25] reason
[36:28] okie dokie
[36:30] praise the Lord everybody
[36:34] he finished the story he went ahead and
[36:37] dipped seven times and when he come out
[36:39] he was healed of his leprosy so this
[36:41] Prophet was asking you to do something
[36:43] first
[36:45] a personal contact with God through
[36:48] Elisha but he's asking for you to do
[36:50] something first and he did that with
[36:52] this woman he says woman what do you
[36:53] have need of what can I do for you she
[36:56] says they're going to take my sons we're
[36:58] in debt you know my husband's gone I'm a
[37:00] widow he served you with the fear of God
[37:02] he loved the message of the hour he's
[37:04] gone we're under the pressure of this
[37:06] famine and they're going to take my
[37:07] children I have nothing he said you have
[37:10] nothing she said I have nothing do you
[37:12] have anything well I've got a pot of oil
[37:14] left now when Elijah dealt with the
[37:15] widow woman she had a little a little
[37:17] meal and she had a little bit of oil and
[37:20] he says I want you to take that and make
[37:22] a cake she said well I'm making the cake
[37:24] it's my last cake for me and my son to
[37:26] die we're gonna that's it we're finished
[37:28] go and make the cake take what oil you
[37:31] have put it together make a cake and
[37:33] bring the cake to me so I can eat
[37:38] God knows how to test you
[37:43] in What You Won't Give Up
[37:47] but she
[37:48] did it and she got a miracle and this
[37:51] woman said all right he said go get all
[37:54] the vessels
[37:55] empty them all make sure there's nothing
[37:57] in the vessels empty out the vessels and
[37:59] and and then you start bringing this
[38:02] together and the sun sun started to do
[38:04] it behind closed doors in a secret place
[38:07] with God and they filled every vessel up
[38:10] every empty vessel vessel was filled
[38:13] with the oil can you say praise the lord
[38:16] it's a type of our day
[38:18] bring your empty vessel to God
[38:20] empty out of yourself
[38:23] empty out of your knowledge and your
[38:26] past bitterness and your past
[38:28] experiences empty out of your religious
[38:30] Pride
[38:31] empty out of all of it and say God fill
[38:34] it now with your oil
[38:40] she had a pot of oil that's all
[38:42] and this is the way the prophet said and
[38:45] I'll finish up this part and then we'll
[38:46] move along
[38:47] she had a pot of oil that's all you have
[38:49] to give what you got how many believe
[38:51] you have to give what you've got
[38:53] see I believe I got a little bit of God
[38:54] in Me here give it to God because you
[38:57] need more can you say Amen I'm going to
[38:58] say I need more of his oil
[39:00] to make it through this present Darkness
[39:02] to make it to the last leg of the
[39:04] journey I need more I don't need more
[39:06] religion I don't need more of smearing
[39:08] on the message I need more of this oil
[39:10] and you have to ask God for it this is
[39:13] what I have I give it to you fill me
[39:15] with more of it can I have that quote uh
[39:18] here
[39:19] it's in perfect strength perfect
[39:21] weakness he comments on this widow woman
[39:23] can I have that one or do I have to push
[39:26] this
[39:27] okay one one this this lady had just a
[39:30] vessel with a little oil in it and she
[39:31] had nothing her two sons was going to be
[39:33] sold for bondsmen she had nothing else
[39:35] she could do with this little vessel of
[39:37] oil wasn't very much she was at the end
[39:40] Elijah said to her said what have you
[39:42] got in your house said just a little oil
[39:44] in a vessel said go to your neighbors
[39:46] borrow plenty of them there look getting
[39:48] ready before it even happens huh get
[39:51] ready David heard that sound in the
[39:53] mulberry bush Elijah saw a cloud just
[39:55] the size of a hand said I hear the sound
[39:57] of abundance of rain if God can only get
[40:00] some empty vessels that's right he said
[40:02] fill the house full of them amen see
[40:04] what God wants God's got to have empty
[40:07] vessels listen we've got to we've got so
[40:09] much Doctrine so much ecclesiastical
[40:12] nonsense until we're down at the end of
[40:14] the barrel there's only one thing left
[40:16] turn to God in his word and if you'll do
[40:18] that get some empty vessels
[40:21] take out all the methodists out of them
[40:23] all the Pentecost out of them all the
[40:25] Baptists out of them and just let them
[40:26] be vessels and set them up in the house
[40:28] and then take from this vessel and begin
[40:30] to pour just begin to pour she had
[40:33] enough to take care of her and her kids
[40:35] and everything else and pay off all of
[40:38] her debts why why just what little she
[40:40] had consecrated it to God and following
[40:44] the word of this Prophet she came out
[40:46] right
[40:48] somebody say praise the Lord
[40:50] she came out right
[40:52] praise the Lord now let me go back to
[40:55] this theme of finishing you know God is
[40:58] looking for ones who can finish the race
[41:01] not just starters
[41:05] it's not that you begun believing this
[41:07] message of Christ a lot of people begin
[41:09] how many knows that 2 million come out
[41:11] of Egypt
[41:14] under a prophet's message how many know
[41:16] that
[41:18] there's a lot of people that began the
[41:20] journey with a prophet out of Egypt
[41:24] through the Wilderness there was a great
[41:27] host that did that there was a lot of
[41:29] starters
[41:30] but very few finishers it's that you
[41:33] it's not that you begin but it's that
[41:35] you that's how you end is that you end
[41:38] the same way Jesus said if you continue
[41:40] in my word then are you my disciples
[41:43] indeed
[41:46] God is a completer
[41:49] how many knows that God is a completer
[41:52] God is not wanting to start something in
[41:55] you he wants to finish something in you
[41:58] he that hath begun a good work in you
[42:00] will be faithful to complete a work in
[42:03] you
[42:04] and so if we're at the completion we
[42:06] should be saying God you're the
[42:08] completer how do you want to complete my
[42:11] life
[42:12] is it just to make a lot of money no no
[42:14] God how do you want to complete my life
[42:16] I look some of the older people in our
[42:18] church and the older people through the
[42:19] generations and I always refer to them
[42:21] being the older people even though I'm
[42:23] 50 something years old they're still the
[42:25] older people but I look at some some
[42:26] pillars in this house of God and pillars
[42:30] around the country that are in our
[42:31] mentors and I see where this message can
[42:33] take somebody in their old age their
[42:36] lost of the bitterness they've lost
[42:37] these things they become prayer warriors
[42:39] that's what them and their wife do
[42:41] they're enjoying life they're enjoying
[42:43] their grandchildren but they're filled
[42:44] with the spirit and they're praying and
[42:46] taking needs I couldn't survive without
[42:48] some of them praying for me they're
[42:50] doing it and I say Lord that's where
[42:52] that's that's where this message is
[42:54] taken to me me not more worldliness not
[42:57] wondering who I am but I know who I am
[43:00] it's stability it's a pillar in the
[43:02] house of God
[43:04] and that's what you have to ask where am
[43:06] I going how will I end up in this
[43:08] Christian walk because there's a lot of
[43:10] people ending up
[43:12] forsaking it
[43:14] walking away at this last minute of the
[43:18] journey
[43:19] no we're not supposed to jump off the
[43:22] sidelines out of this race the last
[43:24] minute no we're supposed to finish the
[43:27] race
[43:27] [Music]
[43:30] I look at her say God that's right when
[43:33] I was a young preacher I went to a
[43:35] Minister's meeting
[43:36] and they had a couple Brothers there
[43:37] from Africa
[43:39] which have so much less of conveniences
[43:41] than me they live very meagerly those
[43:43] Brothers they don't have nothing
[43:46] but yet they have the wealth
[43:48] a lot of them some of them speak English
[43:50] some another language but I came and
[43:52] listened to them to speak and
[43:54] I'm being honest with you that as a
[43:56] young man I was affected not just at the
[43:58] depth and the wealth of what they preach
[44:00] I thought my
[44:02] you don't hear this from even some
[44:04] American ministers this just has such a
[44:06] purity to it in such a depth to it in
[44:09] such a but it wasn't just that it was
[44:11] just the maturity of where this message
[44:14] had taken their lives the balance in
[44:17] their life the maturity you couldn't
[44:19] sense any any uh questionable where they
[44:22] stood you knew where they stood and it
[44:25] wasn't bold or arrogant it was just
[44:27] balanced character of Christ and I said
[44:29] as a young preacher I said if that's
[44:31] where this message is taking us I'm
[44:33] ready to go
[44:36] it's not taken us to more childhood and
[44:39] juvenile attitudes and just doubting in
[44:42] things of the world still trying to
[44:43] figure out who we are it's taken us to
[44:45] maturity and adoption how many would say
[44:47] this message has taken us to adoption
[44:50] not teeter-totter and whether we know
[44:52] what we believe in but it's take us to
[44:53] strengthen the word confidence in the
[44:56] word
[44:57] and this generation marks gray hair
[45:01] they mock the old stay young forever
[45:04] ever seen a 60 year old
[45:06] and his wife on Harley
[45:10] it's funny
[45:13] it's like
[45:14] be careful when you're on that thing
[45:17] what are you doing where did you get
[45:19] that what are you trying to be here
[45:20] you're 60 years old maybe 70. I don't
[45:24] know but what are what image are you
[45:26] trying to live out you are not 21 years
[45:28] old anymore sup the news flash
[45:34] because why we're in a generation that
[45:37] older people and just that sin
[45:40] seniority and the wisdom and growing and
[45:44] learning things
[45:45] is mocked
[45:47] and the Bible's the opposite way
[45:49] we should be glad to have those
[45:51] gray-headed people around
[45:53] we should be glad to have those
[45:54] bald-headed
[45:56] people around
[45:58] it's not just their bald head or their
[46:00] gray hair it's if they've grown in the
[46:02] word got an amen on the bald heads there
[46:05] that they've grown to such a maturity
[46:07] and stability we can we can lean on that
[46:09] and say and I've said it before young
[46:11] couples are raising young kids they
[46:13] never go ask the older ones who've
[46:14] already raised 10 kids
[46:17] we don't have to ask for advice I know
[46:19] how to do it already what a shame it's
[46:20] because this generation the odor are
[46:22] mocked and they're the ones that's been
[46:24] there done that got the t-shirt and
[46:25] they're never asked for advice hardly at
[46:27] all if they do that when they reach 35
[46:29] years old say Dada need your advice or
[46:32] something they come in and you're okay
[46:34] you're 35 and now you're starting to ask
[46:36] for advice
[46:38] because they knew everything they knew
[46:40] everything you knew everything but the
[46:42] hard knocks that we go through we might
[46:44] know something to help you
[46:51] praise the Lord
[46:54] God is a completer
[46:57] he that has begun a good work in you
[46:59] will be faithful to complete it a lot of
[47:02] people start the race but who will
[47:04] finish it
[47:06] can you say Amen
[47:08] we're in a race to win can you say Amen
[47:12] I looked up the word endure and to the
[47:13] end because I knew I felt like I
[47:15] remember it had been the Bible several
[47:16] times it was endure until the end and it
[47:19] says in First Corinthians 1 7 I'm going
[47:21] to go through these quickly so you may
[47:22] not be able to keep up up there but go
[47:24] ahead and give it a try
[47:26] Rebecca First Corinthians 1 7 so that
[47:30] you come behind in no gift waiting for
[47:32] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[47:34] shall also confirm you until the end
[47:37] that you may be blameless in the day of
[47:40] our Lord Jesus Christ he shall confirm
[47:42] you unto the end Hebrews 3 6 Hebrews 3 6
[47:46] but Christ as a son over his own house
[47:48] whose house are we If We Hold Fast the
[47:51] confidence and the rejoicing of Our Hope
[47:54] firm unto the end say that with me unto
[47:58] the end hold firm unto the end Hebrews 3
[48:02] 14.
[48:05] for we are partake made partakers of
[48:07] Christ if we're partakers of Christ if
[48:11] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[48:14] steadfast until the end
[48:18] Hebrews 6 6 11 Hebrews 6 11 and we
[48:22] desire that every one of you to show the
[48:25] same diligence for to the full Assurance
[48:28] of Hope unto the end and the last one in
[48:31] this section is Revelations 2 26
[48:33] Revelations 2 26 and he that overcometh
[48:37] and keepeth my Works unto the end to him
[48:40] will I give power over the Nations
[48:43] God is a completer God is looking at
[48:47] those who want to complete and finish
[48:49] this race until the end but there's a
[48:52] lot of things that's discouraging us to
[48:54] jump ship
[48:57] but it's not that you started it's how
[48:59] you're finishing
[49:01] oh you don't know the stress you don't
[49:03] know my kids you don't know all that
[49:04] I've been through you don't know all the
[49:05] message situations yeah I know some of
[49:08] it I don't really want to know all of it
[49:10] all I know is there's a washing in the
[49:12] water of the word that you can wash your
[49:15] past away and start fresh today and say
[49:18] Lord how do I want to end this race and
[49:21] all this bitterness or do I want to let
[49:23] it go
[49:25] Let It Go
[49:26] and in this race running this race
[49:30] with fervor being filled with the spirit
[49:33] let my kids see me filled with the
[49:36] spirit let my kids see me in that secret
[49:38] place with Christ let my kids maybe even
[49:40] call me fanatical but let them see he
[49:43] was a man filled with the spirit
[49:46] he didn't get it all into all the games
[49:48] and everything as much as I did but I
[49:50] can tell you he was a man of prayer he
[49:52] was a man in the spirit he was a man
[49:54] that could laugh at wholesome jokes he's
[49:56] a man that could have fun but he was a
[49:58] man that was on his knees and filled
[50:00] with the spirit of God
[50:02] somebody say praise the Lord
[50:04] there's some other ones here in Matthew
[50:06] 24 10 if you'd like to turn there
[50:08] Matthew 24 10. I want to read all of
[50:11] these or two of them in Jesus prophecy
[50:14] and I'm ending here real soon I I'm
[50:17] going to do that Matthew 24 10 because I
[50:20] believe that you're getting the subject
[50:21] here this morning anybody being blessed
[50:24] a little bit to help you Matthew 24 I'm
[50:27] trying to preserve my voice a little bit
[50:28] I'm recording a new uh CD and working on
[50:32] it tonight and every time I scream and
[50:34] preach there's not much left
[50:38] and I think I've already done that it's
[50:39] too late Matthew 24 look at this pick
[50:43] this up
[50:44] in verse how about
[50:46] yeah verse 10. this is the end time now
[50:48] and then many shall be offended and
[50:51] shall betray one another and shall hate
[50:53] one another Well boy that sure sounds
[50:55] like today
[50:57] a day of betrayal
[51:00] and many false prophets shall rise and
[51:04] shall deceive many so notice the
[51:06] pressure of the last times pressure
[51:08] people betraying you the pressure of
[51:11] being many being offended easily
[51:13] offended the pressure of betraying one
[51:16] of the pressure of actually hating one
[51:17] other people hating one another that's
[51:19] not just in the world too by the way
[51:22] I've experienced it within the church
[51:24] that's a pressure that's a Darkness can
[51:27] you say Amen it's an internal Darkness
[51:29] sometimes it's there and then it says
[51:32] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[51:34] deceive many now let me just say
[51:36] something about false prophets you know
[51:38] what they are
[51:39] you can have false prophets till God
[51:43] sends a true one
[51:50] you can't have a counterfeit dollar
[51:52] until you have a real dollar
[51:56] so there would be no false prophets
[51:58] unless there was a true one to work off
[52:01] of
[52:03] so we should say I see the false
[52:05] prophets but that says there's a real
[52:08] one I got to find the real one and
[52:09] follow him
[52:11] it's real simple and another thing about
[52:12] false prophets another thing false
[52:14] prophets are known for saying things
[52:17] opposite of the true prophet
[52:20] that's sent from God there's a true
[52:22] Prophecy from God and they become
[52:24] counterfeits to it and a lot of times
[52:25] they're known because they're going to
[52:27] say what's opposite the true prophet of
[52:28] God what he said they're going to say
[52:29] the opposite and in many cases the false
[52:32] prophet is speaking against what the
[52:35] true Prophet has said false prophet
[52:38] Spirits are speaking against the true
[52:40] prophet and what he said that's a
[52:42] pattern in the Bible look it up God
[52:44] sends a true Prophet then the false one
[52:46] comes along and he's saying something
[52:48] opposite of what the true Prophet is
[52:50] saying that's how we know it's a false
[52:51] prophet
[52:52] and then verse 12 notice now you got the
[52:55] pressure of betrayal the pressure of the
[52:57] love going cold the pressure of false
[53:00] prophets the pressure of people hating
[53:02] one another many false prophets verse 12
[53:04] and because iniquity shall abound the
[53:06] love of many shall wax cold that's what
[53:09] we deal with in this generation
[53:11] but he that shall endure until the end
[53:15] the same shall be saved
[53:19] Hallelujah you know what that tells me
[53:21] somebody's going to endure all this
[53:24] somebody's going to endure false
[53:26] prophets somebody's going to endure
[53:28] being betrayed
[53:30] he's looking to those that will endure
[53:33] all of this
[53:35] because he that shall endure to the end
[53:37] not somebody who gives up and says I
[53:40] can't take it no more this betrayal in
[53:43] the message word I I'm finished
[53:46] he's looking for those but he that shall
[53:48] endure to the end
[53:50] through all of this
[53:52] shall be saved Mark 13 and verse 11.
[53:57] notice the conditions now notice we
[53:59] endure these conditions
[54:01] how many just say Amen to this he has
[54:04] the oil for us to make it all the way
[54:07] until the end
[54:08] this oil will cause us to endure to the
[54:11] end
[54:12] some more conditions is Mark 13 11 when
[54:14] it says but when they shall lead you and
[54:16] deliver you up take no thought before
[54:17] what ye shall speak neither do you
[54:19] premeditate what you're going to speak
[54:20] but whatsoever he shall be shall be
[54:23] given to you in that hour that speake
[54:25] for it is not ye that speak but the Holy
[54:28] Ghost praise be to God I don't have to
[54:32] if I'm brought before I'm being
[54:33] questioned and challenged or something I
[54:35] got the Holy Ghost within me and you
[54:37] don't pretend I need to prepare for six
[54:39] months and be prepared for this not if
[54:41] you have the Holy Ghost Inside don't
[54:43] pre-mediment take under what you're
[54:44] going to say he said you depend on the
[54:46] Lord and in that hour when you need it
[54:48] the Holy Ghost will speak through you
[54:49] that tells me the Holy Ghost is going to
[54:51] speak to the bride can I get an amen the
[54:55] Holy Ghost is going to speak through you
[54:56] and you may not have all the knowledge
[54:58] of every quote in this message but if
[55:00] you've got the oil it'll speak through
[55:02] you
[55:04] when you need it in that hour
[55:07] praise the Lord now the brother now the
[55:10] brother shall betray the brother to
[55:12] death
[55:13] and the father shall betray the son
[55:16] and the children shall rise up against
[55:19] their parents that's all pressures
[55:24] in our time
[55:28] so I need the grace of the Lord
[55:31] because sometimes children can come into
[55:33] the spirit of the age
[55:35] disobedient to parents it's the spirit
[55:37] of the age
[55:39] the terror against the very ones that
[55:41] love them
[55:43] turn against the very Pastor that loves
[55:44] them
[55:46] they'll rise up against their parents
[55:48] and shall cause them to be put to death
[55:49] verse 13 and ye shall be hated of all
[55:52] men for my name's sake but he is
[55:55] everybody prepared as we get closer to
[55:57] the final stage of this journey to be
[55:59] hated
[56:01] of all men because of the name of Jesus
[56:04] Christ are you prepared for that
[56:06] and you should be honest I don't know if
[56:08] I'm up to that I don't have enough oil
[56:10] for that it's time to pray for more oil
[56:12] because there's more pressures coming
[56:14] you'll be hated you'll be hated for this
[56:17] message why are you linking Christ with
[56:19] the message because Christ sent the
[56:20] message
[56:22] the message revealed Christ the Christ
[56:24] of the ages has been revealed through
[56:25] this message it's the person of Jesus
[56:27] Christ that's why I said a few Sundays
[56:29] ago this message isn't just a set of
[56:31] books and tapes it's the revealing of
[56:33] Jesus Christ in the last age
[56:35] and so when we name the name of Christ
[56:37] in this way in the word for this hour we
[56:40] will be hated of men for his namesake
[56:43] but he that shall endure until the end
[56:48] shall
[56:49] be saved
[56:53] [Applause]
[56:58] I love all those scriptures that say he
[57:00] that shall endure to the end I see my
[57:03] name in there
[57:05] somehow with all my mistakes and all my
[57:08] blunders and all that people don't like
[57:09] me or whatever
[57:12] I see my name Lord I want to be that one
[57:17] I don't care how much betrayal I don't
[57:19] come here how much there's all kinds of
[57:20] politics I just want to endure to the
[57:24] end
[57:25] and I want to finish well

[57:30] the other dimension and hear only just a

[1:00:19] let me empty out and fill me back up
[1:00:21] with your oil

[1:01:52] those doubts I've been enjoying a sermon
[1:01:54] by Charles Spurgeon I just I just love
[1:01:57] some of his sermons and I might take a
[1:01:59] sermon on it off of his sermon I don't
[1:02:01] know if that's permissible or not to
[1:02:02] preach on Charles spurgeon's sermon but
[1:02:05] he he does a incredible job of Brother
[1:02:08] Steve of dissecting uh talking about
[1:02:11] Abraham brushing all the he brought this
[1:02:14] worship this sacrifice did it like God
[1:02:16] he's waiting for the fire to come down
[1:02:17] but he's got to keep all the fouls off
[1:02:19] of the sacrifice
[1:02:21] and Spurgeon goes into this whole thing
[1:02:23] of Us coming to church and us trying to
[1:02:26] worship God and all the fouls are coming
[1:02:28] and if we don't swish them away or blow
[1:02:31] them away we're going to be cheated out
[1:02:33] of worship
[1:02:36] and he goes into detail of all the
[1:02:38] thoughts business thoughts what some of
[1:02:41] you been thinking this morning you can't
[1:02:42] keep away from your phone right now

[1:02:59] calls a evil lustful thoughts come to
[1:03:01] you while you're at church hey come to
[1:03:03] you to rob you the fouls are coming
[1:03:05] around in your thought life

[1:03:42] exercise
[1:03:47] you all jumped in this race
[1:03:50] towards the bridegroom you all jumped in
[1:03:53] or maybe you're barely and I don't know
[1:03:55] why get to the very end and just
[1:03:59] somebody said this message isn't true
[1:04:03] somebody said this
[1:04:05] we're on the last leg of the journey
[1:04:08] and we didn't join the race to lose we
[1:04:10] joined it to win to finish the last leg

[1:04:33] this morning
[1:04:34] because I'm here to tell you as a gospel
[1:04:36] Minister we are on the closing seconds
[1:04:37] of time
[1:04:38] this thing is just about over
[1:04:41] I heard a message preachers say that 20
[1:04:43] years ago well we're a lot closer now
[1:04:48] than when that preacher said that
[1:04:50] we're like seconds a lot of seconds
[1:04:52] closer so all the more reason to jump in
[1:04:56] this race and if you're in it to say I'm
[1:04:58] in it to win it
[1:05:00] I said I'm in it to win it
[1:05:05] it's a song Sherry
[1:05:08] who can run home and write it but we
[1:05:09] compete you know I'm writing that first
[1:05:11] before she I'm in it to win it
[1:05:14] and you reach the last leg what a shame
[1:05:16] you just give out see I've seen too much
[1:05:19] I've done too much I just no we're
[1:05:22] almost there
[1:05:25] this is not the time to compromise
[1:05:28] good give me fill me with your oil Lord
[1:05:30] to make the last leg of the trip and you
[1:05:33] feel him he just feels you whoo glory be
[1:05:35] to God
[1:05:38] Murray
[1:05:42] I want to finish the trip I made it to
[1:05:45] win it I want to finish the race
[1:05:48] with courage and with strength and the
[1:05:50] one thing I'll need to finish it and
[1:05:52] that's the Holy Ghost let's stand and
[1:05:54] Worship the Lord together oh we want to
[1:05:57] finish this race
[1:05:58] Hallelujah is it in is it in a time
[1:06:01] right now to seek more oil can you say
[1:06:04] man isn't it time we should be praying
[1:06:06] more instead of less
[1:06:08] isn't this the last second to draw
[1:06:10] closer instead of further apart
[1:06:12] isn't it isn't it the time to draw close
[1:06:14] together in congregation instead of
[1:06:16] split off isn't it time to be more
[1:06:18] faithful to services and not less
[1:06:20] isn't it time to come and be repenting
[1:06:22] more than less repenting isn't it time
[1:06:24] to be more in the word than other things
[1:06:27] maybe it's a Time For Less movies more
[1:06:30] of God
[1:06:31] isn't a time to be more on fire for God
[1:06:33] than lovers of Pleasures more than
[1:06:35] lovers of God is it time to be more
[1:06:37] Sanctified instead of pushing the
[1:06:39] envelope and the edge of what we should
[1:06:41] wear or do isn't it a time to seeking
[1:06:43] more spiritual fellowship and
[1:06:45] relationship than shallow relationships
[1:06:47] and shallow Fellowship isn't it a time
[1:06:50] that we stop hanging around friends all
[1:06:51] the time that are the wrong friends but
[1:06:54] hang around with friends of like
[1:06:55] Precious faith
[1:06:58] I'd say if there's any time this is the
[1:07:00] time to do that

[1:07:05] the last leg of the race and we're going
