TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen luke chapter 7 and i'd like to speak to you invitation accepted today amen and one of the pharisees desired him that would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in this city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at mead in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment hallelujah now we know we're in a special place now you're in a moment you're in a moment and stood at his feet and behind him weeping began to wash his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisees which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he knew if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner now you know you're standing in a special spot and if you can only be aware that the angel of the lord is among us and i would like to you to invite him to your pew now i want you to invite him you create an atmosphere because he's accepted your invitation and he's come to worship with you let's pray lord jesus we dedicate ourself and i say this very reverently but i

since i spoke back to back lord i ask you to bring me strength just now help me to be able to speak to this audience bless them this in day christ's name we ask amen and amen god bless you god bless you you can be seated if it would be okay i'd like to continue the moment just for a moment we have a special guest with us today with her parents her mother stood in a prayer line desiring a child she hadn't been able to have one and it was a special night when i prayed i saw the child and so it wasn't a what if i just knew then her dad would come and preach for us just a bit later and he was pre he was preaching and he said one day i hope to be a granddaddy and i just spoke out and i said you're going to be a granddad and i wasn't just saying it by human inspiration because i saw the vision and i said and he'll send me a picture of that baby well he sent me the ultrasound picture of the baby but today we have the baby with us i know it's already been dedicated but i would like to dedicate it today [Applause] now you see i as when i begin to all of this begin to come together this morning jesus was brought to a temple to be dedicated you are looking at a vision fulfilled not a wish but the visions fulfilled amen zach god bless you guys thank you for being here i know your dad will forgive you for not coming to listen to him this morning but you see this baby had to be here amen isn't she beautiful amen could we just pray almighty god lord the creator of heavens and earth in god's great photo album this baby was there and today hopes visions are now made manifest and lord jesus i ask you that you would bless this baby and its parents father today as we've dedicated this temple we now dedicate this child may you watch over its life and be with it as lays in the bed may the angel of god stand guard lord for i'm reminded that brother branham said that when they placed moses in that crocodile-infested water he called for gabriel to stand on that little basket and said when that crocodile sticks up his nose you just take your foot and push him right back down and when it gets into the whirlpools of life lo you help him through that now dear god i ask you that you'd bless this child may there be a special anointing that would come upon you lord bless these parents dear god today and lord we thank you for it in jesus christ's name amen isn't that beautiful [Applause] i love you god bless you you're the one who did all the work hallelujah we were in north carolina i hope i've got a few minutes we were in north carolina at brother joe green's camp meeting your father preached there many times and and i had spoke that evening and and uh as i had preached you know and i i felt a resistant spirit in the building and i actually asked them to stop resisting it was two preachers and i actually asked them to stop resisting that you know because one person can hinder a service and after a bit i just told them i said i'm gonna call your name if you don't quit resisting so it eased up and i was able to preach and i said you know if god can't operate out here he'll operate behind the curtain i didn't know what i was saying but as i finished up that evening and a couple of people came for prayer sister charnock from south africa came and she's gone to be with the lord now because of an accident but she had sugar diabetes and diabetic and god healed her there then we just stepped behind the curtain as i was standing behind the curtain there and walking to the guys that were going to take care of me and and as i was walking there something turned me in you know that something's the lord and there's a young lady named caitlyn said in there and she was desiring a child and the lord just told her a little something very secretive in her life and then her husband nathaniel greene and they stood together and i said god will give you a child do you know it was exactly one year to the day that god gave them that child his name is charlie [Applause] there was a sequence of events that took place and and uh another one was prayed for and another young man had fought the call of the lord for 17 years and from that point he's he has preached several sermons and doing extremely well his wife his home has just completely changed brother guido von de brunt you know brother quito brother guido was from belgium an incredible friend of mine and he was in his 60s and he had come to that meeting and and he had came down he was standing in the back he wanted to shake my hand and so uh i just i just i just turned to guido and told him that something that was going on in his life and and it was a lie and i told him that now that's a lie that they've told on you guido and then in a moment i just said ditto there's a train coming for you don't you be afraid to get on that train and the lord took him home in just a couple of months and just in a very peaceful way and there was a friend of mine that was standing there brother joe green's brother-in-law he's he was a he was a wonderful man he was one of the good old boy club he'd sat in church for decades married to brother joe's sister grew up he had been up under brother henry green you know to come to church is one thing but to really know god is another and he had said in a pew for decades and and he was standing there and he was this kind of friend to me i one time i was there and i was speaking immediate and it was hunting season he said i've never let nobody hunt in my stand not even my own voice but i would like for you to go sit in my stand for a couple of hours well i found that very special and so i i was able to do that but that day as he saw all of those events take place he made this statement i can serve a god like that when he had seen god in action he said i can serve a god like that i wrap terry up in my arms and i begin to pray it don't take a year to change a man's life but i began to pray and terry became a real christian sister betty would say this said i walked into the building with one terry and i walked out of the building with another terry terry didn't know that he was had cancer in his body in a month he would find out that he had cancer and it was eating he was eating through his chest wall and terry i would stand and preach his funeral in just a few months you see god was in preparation like this building terry was to set at the table but he needed to meet god and before he would even know that he had cancer he would meet the lord jesus that could give him a new body you see that was a tremendous healing that took place that he could go to meet the lord and know that everything was all right amen god bless you i hope you didn't mind me sharing a couple of those things with you this morning brother branham would tell us in many sermons take us to this story so i would like for you not to finish before i do i won't be long but brother i'm had such a way to be able to watch god operate in a vision you see he can look back into the garden of eden and see what took place the reason the prophet could stand there and do those things is because he was seeing god in action polaroid or rca or any of those movie producers were not the first videographers of the world god's been taking videos since the beginning and just like with moses moses was able to look back in the garden of eden and and watch even watch even abraham and watch noah and listen once you've seen something you become a witness of it so brother branham is allowed to not just read scripture but he's allowed to look into it now he could look backwards and see them but he could look forwards and see you did you catch that it's incredible to be in the in the book he could look backwards and see abraham sitting at a tent and sarah was in the house but he could look forward and see you brother brandon said the pharisee he would have been one of the richest ones and he desired god can even use a pharisee he desired that he would have jesus to come to his house he desired that he would bring him there now his desire and his thought process was that he would bring him there to make fun of him but he didn't realize god had a plan and god would even take his plan and even a wrong desire because god had a seed and god is really interested in the seed that seed is eternal so he would send a courier a man to go find jesus brother branham said that he looked all day and he went up in the hills and the valleys and he went all over the place and he finally found jesus and he was on the top of a hill and he had been speaking for quite a while and he was just speaking to the people and maybe some miracles were taking place and he was speaking to the children no doubt god had such a way an atmosphere to people just enjoyed sitting all day just listening to his voice there was something about his voice that they were drawn to there was something about his atmosphere whenever jesus is there everything seems right it just seems right when jesus is there no matter if you're a christian or you're a sinner the atmosphere of jesus changes the atmosphere to where that god knows how to take care of our lives jesus was just conducting business on the hill this man no doubt comes and brother adam so eloquently puts it that he begin to tell the disciples that i i got to get to jesus to because i have an invitation for him to come and those disciples see the meeting that's going on and what all is happening here no doubt thousands of people are gathered because and there's healings taking place homes being changed lives being touched the eloquent words that are coming forward and your master a pharisee that that jesus hates is inviting him for supper well he won't come he won't come no he won't be even found in that house no doubt peter told him said go away go away just go away but i've i've got a job to do i got to get to him this man is so enamored about his master being such a great man and wealthy man and having such a great house and going to have the dignitaries of the all the city there when he gets in the presence of jesus doesn't take advantage because no doubt he is now has an opportunity that thousands of those people would love to have to stand right in front of jesus and have a moment how many people have come and had a moment with jesus how many people are setting pews like you're sitting in today and had an opportunity with a moment and missed their opportunity because they had an agenda maybe they came to criticize maybe they came to to make fun maybe they come to to do different things and they're right in front of emmanuel and have a moment to where he turns his attention to them and they're more enthused with their job let me just say the biggest house in this world is not worth missing god the best job in this city is not worth missing god relationships with uh the most beautiful woman or the most beautiful man or handsome man or the wealthiest man or prestigious man is not worth missing god for don't squander the opportunity and he tells him of his master he tells him that he would like to have you to come and eat with him and he would like to entertain you would you come much to the disagreement of his disciples i'd love to come i'd love to come to your house brother baby said he always comes where he's invited the invitation is very important the reason a lot of people don't get much out of church is because they personally haven't invited him are you with me are you with me now you must invite him because he'll come it's just like your home he wants to be the king of your home he'll take care of your finances he'll take care of your relationships he'll take care of your children he'll take care of the behind the scenes stuff but you got to make him first place in your life and listen he's not god he's not your lord unless you make him your lord it takes total surrender to god surrender of ambition surrender of will surrender of choices surrender of attitude it takes everything to surrender to god i'd love to come tell him i'll be there can you imagine the chatter of disciples because they can't see past what they see they can't think past what they think one morning i woke up and i felt that special presence in the room and i was being told many different things by doctors so i just stood up in the in my bedroom and i stood there and i just i just worshiped in the presence of the lord and these words came to me look past what you see think past what you think and the next morning i immediately went to looking at the unseen hallelujah god was reminding me look past your health issues look past what's being said to you think past what you're being the thoughts that are coming let me just remind you today sometimes you've got to look past the difficulties of life you've got to think past the thoughts that satan drops in your mind the negative thoughts the unbelief that comes get past those barriers jesus makes his way that way you know this story very well he makes his way in that direction the pharisee would have named simon would have the best of the best he's going to have the dignitary of the dignitaries there he's going to have the uppity ups of the community there brother branham said that the poor people couldn't get in but they would stand and look to see who was there and they would smell the aroma of the food that was there to be served and there may be some nuggets that they could get a little bit later on but they were there to see what they could see and and smell that aroma now they would love to be in but they wasn't invited the disciples wasn't invited but jesus was invited like brother branham said if i'd have been a foot worse flunky i'd have been watching for jesus to come it was the lowest position in the city but to be able to wash his feet to make him welcome at the house if i'd have been able to be there he said i'd have been looking over the shoulders of people watching for jesus to come over the hill i'd have been watching for him to come i'd have been in great expectation knowing that jesus had been invited no doubt he had to wash the mayor's feet or no doubt he had to wash the dignitary's feet but i don't wanted to wash jesus's feet [Applause] but because of the influence and instruction they had been told don't welcome him don't welcome him don't wash him don't don't don't anoint him with any perfume don't welcome him as a matter of fact turn your back when he comes in now let me just ask you you've been at places like that and you've felt rejected before you know when people are but for you and i this is not our world this is not where i'm a citizen of i love america just like just like our prophet loved america but she's rotten you know i'm identified with her glory i'm identified with her shame but she's rotten i've been asked over the last few months to be a actually got a letter while i was here they want me to be an advisor to a senator uh in his close circle i'm not interested in the job i feel honored to be asked that but i'm not interested in the job i want no part of that i want no part of that world are you with me it's just because somebody there's a man we know him well there's a man that has a thirst for reality are you with me thank god there's still some people that that want reality i think sometimes people are walking to a room like different around dignitaries or special people they put on a little deal they're not themselves they kind of put on a little deal they're you know they act different because so and so is in the room jesus is really not interested in so-and-so you know sometimes we think attorneys are so great doctors are so great it's just a job it's just a profession it's just what it is if i got an attorney here this morning i'm sorry jesus had a disdain for them to be honest with you so don't get mad at me i've got lawyers in my church too but you know you're not impressed with that i think sometimes we become impressed with the wrong thing i was flying into nashville one time and there was a girl that had set beside me on the on the airplane she was balled up in a knot and went to sleep and we flew to nashville it was evening flight and i flew into nashville and there was roses on two different ways and a red carpet rolled out for her i walked down the same red carpet like i [Applause] just and she was winning the emmys or whatever it was that in country music she was winning all the grammys that particular night and one won seven different awards that night connie helped me with the name i don't know anyway don't matter the local pastor picked me up and he said i that was really for you [Applause] jesus walks in he kind of surveys the room he walks in his feet still stink his robe has not changed he walks in and he he knows i got to be here this ain't a place where i'm welcome but i got to be here and he walks over and takes the place and he sets down now i want to just i want to remind you now he is the most important person in the room and i want to say this to you today he's the most important person in this room now they were all about their deals their businesses their their talking their doctrines and he was sitting there just watching he was not waiting for one of them you see in just a few feet away there was a girl that had a very trapped chained lifestyle and he was the door he was her way out and something moved on the inside of her if they won't make him welcome i will if they won't make him welcome i will and she runs home brother branham said and she goes up in her closet and she gets her little sock out and it's everything that she owns god don't want to hack he wants it all are you with me now he wants all of our lives and so she goes and gets it and she goes to the local store and she goes and says i must have an alabaster box incredible meanings of that alabaster box and this man that's behind the counter brother brandon brings it out so you don't have to buy the best remember how he talks to her when brother brown talks he says he says you don't have to spend that much money but i want the best i want the best you see she wasn't going to squander her opportunity with him she takes that box now i want to just say this to you as she carries that box in all of her sin stains she carries that box like it's the greatest thing that's ever been held in her possession because it was and she carries this box and she begins to make her way and she finds herself at his feet now let me just say no doubt that that she thought in the back of her mind what if he don't accept me what if he turns me away but she falls at his feet and let me just say this to you so many people don't want emotion in this day they've not met jesus so many people want to make this message something that it's not this will never fit the world's standards we'll never become a bunch of dignified who's who we're the pride of jesus christ so take your starchy shirt and burn it take your self-real gospel and throw it away let yourself be so broken that you can find yourself at his feet come on church humble yourself because let me just say this to you without god you're just dust without god you're forgotten i want to remind you maybe this is going out into the airways and this don't pertain to anybody you say well i can do this without god let me just say the next generation is the only one that holds your memory and after another generation you're just forgotten in the dust and your body goes back to the dust you'll be judged in that body and i don't care if you own the whole city let me just say this to you without jesus in your life you're lost and you're on your way to hell but it don't have to be that way it don't have to be that way this woman had a lot of scars this woman had a lot of complexes but she was willing to overlook herself for long enough to get into the presence of jesus christ and this man had an atmosphere that was so powerful to it broke her into tears so much so that she could wash his feet feet that had manual feet that had dust that was god speaking to you to sing that song today those men those men said if he knew who she was no doubt simon said to that his neighbor that was standing beside him they call him a prophet outside maybe even the messiah but if he knew who she was if he knew who she was let me just say he did know who she was he did know who she was and she was the reason he accepted the invitation [Applause] are you with me now take this in this is more than 2 000 years ago that's why this invitation was accepted that's why this room he chose to come and dwell in this room the city around you may not accept him and may make a lot of fun of what's going on here but jesus come to this room because he knew you were coming glory hallelujah she began to worship him she ignored everything that they were saying she began to worship him he was accepting her worship hallelujah oh sin stains was being washed all of her life her past she would never be the same ever again in her life or if you can have one of those services in your life i'm not talking about 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago god wants more he wants more of your worship oh it's just for the kids now he's still looking for gray-headed people [Applause] simon i have somewhat to say to you now it's him and jesus now for the great king of the house simon's now in a spot he's invited jesus to embarrass him and now he's about to be embarrassed and he begins to tell him almost a riddle who would be the most thankful a man that was forgiven little or one that was forgiven much and jesus asked it to him in a way that demanded an answer you see your life will demand an answer when god comes you're there you're either going to go one way or the other way are you with me now you remember the days of noah there was people that gathered on the outside of the ark and no doubt they believed for a while or associated for a while but then they began to make fun and ridicule but they didn't move off just in case but they didn't realize it wasn't noah's message it was god's message i want you to understand this isn't brother paul's message even brother branham's message this is god's message it's the message of the lamb he's going to have a bride he's here with purpose and this dedication is with purpose and this woman comes into the room to dedicate her life to god and bring her best offering that she could give to him she had no more that she could give and she gives herself to him jesus does something that that pharisee doesn't believe in that pharisee requires a literal lamb he requires a literal turtle dove he requires the the becoming under the laws of that pharisee system but jesus forgives her and remember forgiveness is justification it's as though you never did it in the first place others may look at her as steal as a harlot but when god looks at her it's like she's a virgin and her life will never be the same are you with me get past yourself i don't care what you've done in your life the lord jesus the blood of jesus christ can wash away the most horrible degradated sin that there is and you can rise not to continue to walk that way but you can walk in a newness of life and then there's no there for no condemnation hallelujah you don't have to beat yourself over the back and pull up those dry bones let me just tell you just tell the devil they're forgiven they're in the sea of forgetfulness and god that's rich in mercy god himself can't find those sins no more [Applause] from rahab to tamar all the way through the scriptures even to this woman at his feet he can look past all of her sins hallelujah hallelujah who was the most important in the room a prophet would bring it so eloquently that through the ages jesus went to the churches and they put him out i'm coming to an end now he goes because they invite him then they won't keep his word so he has to leave i'm going to go maybe above my own authority now but if this is okay but this pulpit and these pews we want him to come we won't put him out we won't put him out we'll do our best to make him comfortable whatever he wants we'll do our very best to give him everything that we've got to give him herself and what greater to do than give oh brother ron but those lafontaines are just a bunch of singers and all they want to do is sing well wonder who made them that way i told you it's going above my authority right there wonder who put that in there i wonder why he built them that way because he wanted it that way i've said this about brother paul if i could sing like him i wouldn't preach he asked me this morning is that a compliment or not a compliment but if you heard me sing you would know why that i say that the way that i say that i don't think it's fair that god gave him all of that i get a thought i get an inspiration lord i don't know where g is or a but god places in the body that which he needs now maybe you can't sing but you can worship in a different way and maybe it's just lifting your hands or clapping your hands or or raising them before god and your voice if they built a bird to be able to sing before god we had a bear come to my house this morning according to my video at home all my cameras around my house we had about a 400 pound bear visit my house i did not invite him he ate my cat food this morning i didn't invite him but he's going to go and somewhere and wallow and worship the lord in a certain way and if god could build the animals to worship the lord and the trees and all the pauline that's out there to worship the lord he built you as a special instrument [Applause] what does psalms say everything that hacked breath you have an excuse not to worship god if you're dead but the that's the only excuse so when you come before him it's our opportunity and responsibility [Applause] people don't understand even an amen is important even an amen is important because the amen is it brings it on the other man said if i i had a dog and he said i if i was hunting and there was an old skunk said he hated skunks and he would go into a thicket i'd just rub him and i'd tell him and he said that's kind of way it is with preaching and you're sitting there and the worst devil i know stinker i know is the the devil himself and when you say amen you see we're not washing his feet literally but we've come and worshiped him never find ourself coming to his room and not making him welcome i don't care what our circumstances is and i understand sickness i understand turmoil and a family i understand all of that but when we come to his house that ought to be in our house as well there ought to be a lot of time in your life to where you stop and you make him welcome because church starts at home and then he comes here i was sitting one day with a man in a group of people and i just looked over at him and i didn't know him very well i just knew who he was the brother too i didn't hardly know his name god just dropped something in my heart while we were all just kind of talking i just spoke to him put my hand on his knee and i said why don't you just let that little habit in your life go and he said this was his response it's not bothering anybody it's not hurting anyone i'm still with the dedication thought now and i looked at him and i said sure about that i said when you when your children grow up when they watch you with that little habit in your life whenever you try to instruct them they're going to say daddy and when they get old enough you'll not be able to do anything with them and they'll leave and go every which away i sat there a moment and i said after your children are gone your wife is going to look at you and say you never was an overcomer sat in church all these years and and i'm talking about decades and your wife's gonna look at you and go you couldn't overcome and she's gonna leave with another man that'll never happen brother ron i've got the luxury of about 25 years later children's gone wife is gone but you know what what's the constant through it all that little habit you say well that'll not hurt anybody that'll not hurt nobody you see god stopped me and made me tell this story because you're sitting here this morning let me just say that little habit will get between you and god listen and you can put the name on it because you don't need your name called out it's already been called out jesus is looking at his feet and saying let that little habit go in your life let it go give me all your life just let it go just let it go listen let this moment you don't need a prayer line let this moment this moment i'm talking about right now say lord i i'll give that to you and i'll not do that no more you see the jesus that's in the room just looked up at simon and this is your opportunity to let it go because this is more than a service this is a dedication of a temple this is the dedication of your temple i don't know how it is at your house but when we're going to have company over that house gets a scrubbing my wife points out things that i haven't seen there's weeds going down the driveway that i drive past i don't drive past nothing no more but they won't let me drive that's probably a good thing i don't i don't see those weeds they need to be cut before company comes things need to be placed and clean before company comes before jesus comes he's allowing you time to get it cleansed he's allowing you time to get it washed he's allowing your time to get your mind right your spirit right your attitude right are you with me now he's allowing you time to get it right because he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and he knows everything already about you but he's pulling his spirit to you to worry that you've got a moment aren't you glad that god gives you a moment a special moment i'm going to finish now if he was in brother branham's meetings and you were sitting in the hundreds and hundreds of people and all of a sudden he called your name that would be better than having the president of the united states to want to have you to come to the oval office i've stood in the oval office it's a small room a lot of illusion but it's a small room but i'd much rather be where jesus is at and he begins to just take a moment with you and he just begins to spend a few seconds now you'll spend the rest of your life thinking about this moment i've made eye contact with this entire audience but now it's with you sometimes jesus just so cares about our life until he wants a moment with you billions of people on the earth and he wants a moment with you it's pretty incredible isn't it what's your name joe god thought so much before the foundation the world he would invite you to this room dignitaries all over this city but he would invite you to this room because he wanted to have fellowship with you it's pretty incredible in it incredible the god that said let there be and he he watches over the entire entire universes they say there's 70 universes and he watches over all of that and he's so special he wants to be with joe today it's pretty phenomenal and a lot of people would like to be joe yeah because jesus cares about every situation in your life you see i don't know you but jesus sure does i'm glad he took time to come to my house i realize this isn't a shouting sermon and it may have not been eloquently put but jesus walked into this house this morning and he orchestrated the whole events and joe didn't know that his name was going to be called in the service but you see god watches over joe like he did that baby before it was ever born are you with me are you with me can i just share one more thing with you i feel like i'm taking too much time and maybe i am i was in louisiana and i had preached a meeting you know i'm the only one to tell my story so is it okay if i tell my story and so was in the meeting and in the prayer line i i just kept hearing this voice wait for jessica wait for jessica and so i waited i i prayed and we prayed for hundreds of people and then sister jessica walks up jessica martin she walks up and the lord spoke to her i see your son and you're here for your son and her son was away from god and i'm telling this for a reason and your son's away from god god's going to bring him home that boy was way out in the world but god who's rich in mercy watched over that evening and that boy is now a real christian dedicated for god married what about your loved ones what about your loved ones once won't you claim them to sit on that pew right there they take me back to the room brother aaron oglesby takes me to the room aaron's about a six foot five boy many of you probably know him and i just turned to him and i said aaron you'll never be the same kind of like gideon last night you'll never be the same god's called you to preach the gospel of jesus christ and aaron just throws his arms back and back against the wall and just collapses against the wall i sat down on the bed and i said i see a baby i see a little boy andrew was attending to me and he said not me daddy not me my daughter couldn't have a child then doctors had told her since she was a teenage girl she'd never have a child because she was born with a deficiency and her and it was a certain way that her womb was ma and she could never carry a child but god looks past the impossibilities [Applause] hallelujah i saw the vision of that little boy and in that vision god gave me his name and i held that very close to my heart her husband had a wreck and it crushed his pelvis to which that i was there when the doctors told him said i if you was probably ever wanting a child you'll probably never have a child now it's totally impossible because all of that's been crushed i still held on to the vision there's my daughter it was impossible for her to have a child my son-in-law it's impossible for him to have a child but god had already showed me the vision he was going to they were going to have that child hallelujah hallelujah god rich in mercy i i talked to that little baby this morning hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah it means wonderful one day we'll stand there young we'll
