[0:00] together and starting at verse 15.
[0:03] joshua 11 and verse 15.
[0:10] we have coming into a new facility and
[0:13] there's many
[0:14] there's many more announcements but
[0:16] we're going to just give them to you
[0:17] slowly
[0:18] if we read them all it would just be
[0:20] announcements and not preaching
[0:22] but we have a lot of things we want to
[0:24] integrate and just different things but
[0:25] we'll just take them little by little
[0:27] joshua chapter 11 and verse 15.
[0:30] amen everybody have it as the lord
[0:34] commanded moses his servant
[0:37] so did moses command joshua
[0:40] and so did joshua he left
[0:43] nothing undone of all the lord commanded
[0:47] moses i want you to notice the the
[0:51] biblical no no man can ever get out of
[0:55] the biblical pattern for god to contact
[0:58] and come to his people
[0:59] the lord commands the prophet the
[1:02] prophet commanded joshua
[1:04] joshua commanded the people can you say
[1:06] amen
[1:07] and joshua the joshua commission is to
[1:10] carry out
[1:11] what has been commanded so you'll never
[1:14] get around that biblical pattern that's
[1:16] the way he's done it today
[1:17] that's the way he's done it in every day
[1:19] and that's what he does the way he did
[1:20] it back here in the time of joshua and
[1:22] moses
[1:23] so joshua took all that land the hills
[1:26] and all the south country and all the
[1:27] land of goshen
[1:28] and the valley and the plain and the
[1:30] mountain of israel in the valley of the
[1:32] same
[1:32] even from the mount haleck that goes up
[1:35] to sarah even into
[1:36] belgaud in the valley of lebanon under
[1:39] mount hermon and
[1:40] all their kings he took and smote them
[1:42] and slew them
[1:43] joshua made war a long time with all
[1:46] those kings when i read that i say lord
[1:49] i feel like i've been warned a long time
[1:51] when is the end of this war
[1:54] there was not a city that made peace
[1:56] with the children of israel saved the
[1:57] hivites the
[1:58] inhabitants of gibeon all the other they
[2:00] took into battle
[2:01] for it was of the lord to harden the
[2:03] hearts that they should come against
[2:05] israel in battle that he might destroy
[2:07] them utterly
[2:08] and that they might have no favor
[2:11] but that he might destroy them as
[2:15] the lord commanded moses and i'll read
[2:18] again from my text today in verse 15
[2:20] as the lord commanded moses his servant
[2:23] so did moses command joshua
[2:26] and so did so did joshua he left
[2:29] nothing undone of all
[2:32] that the lord commanded moses
[2:36] all of it was important
[2:39] none of it should be left undone
[2:44] praise the lord father we thank you lord
[2:46] for the word today
[2:47] we pray lord as we have brought our
[2:50] praise
[2:51] and worship and our appreciation to you
[2:53] the lord you'll give us something today
[2:55] from your eternal throne
[2:56] god something in our hearts that would
[2:58] give us a burning desire to serve you
[3:00] better
[3:01] lord jesus we love you today we want to
[3:03] express that love
[3:04] and lord we know that you express your
[3:06] love by speaking and giving us
[3:08] revelation
[3:09] and lord you loved us before the
[3:10] foundation of the world you loved us
[3:13] with an elective love
[3:14] and god that just makes us reach back to
[3:16] love you even more
[3:18] we pray father that you will burn
[3:21] the lord the the fires of god from the
[3:23] word in our hearts today
[3:25] i'm going to stand here and ask you lord
[3:27] burn out any starchiness that's in us
[3:29] burn out anything lord that's cold and
[3:31] if something's bothering us
[3:33] we pray father we just lay it aside
[3:35] because we know lord that if there's an
[3:37] answer that we need
[3:38] the answer is not in this world the
[3:41] answer is not
[3:42] in worry the answer is in you
[3:46] and so we may we give our hearts to you
[3:48] and may you break through in the spirit
[3:49] we prayed today
[3:50] and lord i'm just thinking about my
[3:53] father
[3:54] how i wish i'd have had him lord in that
[3:56] office this morning is this wednesday is
[3:58] the time of his passing last year
[4:01] i miss him lord but i know he's taken
[4:04] his reward on the other side
[4:05] i wish he was here to see the
[4:07] congregation worshiping this morning i
[4:09] i wish he was here to enjoy these
[4:12] abundant blessings that you have given
[4:14] us lord we pray that we would finish
[4:17] our course all of us as my dad did lord
[4:20] and finish his race as it were
[4:22] and be faithful to the message of the
[4:25] hour
[4:26] grant it father we pray and i just pray
[4:28] you encourage your people and use us
[4:30] once again to do that
[4:31] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[4:34] amen
[4:35] bless you may be seated
[4:43] thank you jesus
[4:48] joshua chapter 11 if you read the rest
[4:52] of the chapter beginning of the first
[4:53] verse all the way through if you'll read
[4:55] it sometime when you're home
[4:58] joshua 11 speaks of actually more kings
[5:01] that join
[5:02] forces against the children of israel we
[5:05] preached a few months ago about the
[5:07] kings the five kings that had joined
[5:08] forces against them
[5:10] now as time goes on we see more kings
[5:13] join forces joshua destroyed them and
[5:16] took over
[5:16] but now we see more kings joining forces
[5:19] in that
[5:20] and the battle intensifies in the book
[5:22] of joshua the battle intensifies
[5:24] but you'll see when you read it that the
[5:27] chapter 11 finishes
[5:29] in a complete victory i like to preach
[5:32] about victories
[5:34] i don't always like to preach about the
[5:35] battle but i like to preach about the
[5:37] victories and that's what took place it
[5:40] began with kings rising against them and
[5:42] that's the way
[5:43] sometimes our life sometimes at the
[5:45] beginning of a week
[5:47] of a week that's there's forces joining
[5:49] against us
[5:50] but i believe that we have the victory
[5:52] and i believe at the end of it
[5:53] in the chapter of our life i believe god
[5:56] gets the victory and that's the way it
[5:57] should be
[5:59] verse 15 has been just holding my
[6:02] attention here
[6:02] actually the last month or so as you
[6:04] just read it
[6:06] and i've been looking at one verse it's
[6:07] just been so inspiring to me and i'm
[6:09] going to read it again
[6:11] it's been just amazing to watch it and
[6:13] just keep reading it
[6:14] over and over again and maybe some of
[6:17] the stuff you already know
[6:19] but it just was a real inspiration to me
[6:21] many things in just the one verse
[6:23] and we see in verse 15 a real i guess i
[6:26] could call it a trickle-down effect
[6:29] from the lord to the prophet to the
[6:32] to joshua and then joshua commanding his
[6:35] people and
[6:36] joshua not only spoke it but joshua
[6:38] fulfilled it
[6:39] the bible says in joshua did joshua did
[6:43] moses the lord spoke it moses the
[6:46] prophet
[6:47] spoke it but joshua did it
[6:50] and that's a real transition if somebody
[6:52] is under the message
[6:53] that's come from god can you say man
[6:56] this is not something that we just quote
[7:00] the message is not something that we
[7:02] just quote can you say amen
[7:04] the message just is not something that
[7:06] we're apparent and just keep repeating
[7:08] and hope for results just because we're
[7:10] saying it but the joshua commission
[7:13] is that we're doing and fulfilling what
[7:16] the word said to do
[7:17] can i get an amen this morning and so
[7:20] now that
[7:21] there's a trickle down effect and i
[7:22] won't call it trickling down but
[7:24] i'll call it the authority of the word
[7:27] passed down because god brings the
[7:29] authority
[7:30] and the command that's what command
[7:31] means it means an order it means an
[7:33] authority
[7:34] the lord brings that and he gives it to
[7:36] his prophet and when he gives it to his
[7:38] prophet then of course
[7:39] joshua not necessarily a prophet but the
[7:42] the leader of the army
[7:44] it was turned over to him to carry out
[7:46] and how many know as we've been
[7:47] preaching this
[7:48] uh off and on the last year how many
[7:50] know what the joshua commission is
[7:52] the joshua commission is to take and go
[7:54] take the land
[7:55] that was the original purpose of the
[7:57] message coming through moses
[7:59] it wasn't just to have signs and
[8:01] miracles and wonders
[8:02] but it's to go take the land that was
[8:04] the order that was to command it
[8:06] and and if and if joshua didn't go do
[8:09] that
[8:09] then the message wasn't fulfilled yet if
[8:12] joshua didn't go out and take the people
[8:15] over jordan and take
[8:16] all of the inheritance that god promised
[8:18] the message wasn't done
[8:19] the message wasn't fulfilled no matter
[8:22] how much they sat around and quoted
[8:24] moses
[8:24] it would do no good because they weren't
[8:26] fulfilling the command
[8:29] the order can you say amen
[8:32] so the authority of the word passed down
[8:35] the lord commanded and given order and
[8:37] moses commanded joshua
[8:39] and joshua commanded the people we hear
[8:41] that in in joshua
[8:43] joshua commanded the people the command
[8:45] is to do something
[8:46] it's not to watch something a command is
[8:48] to do something
[8:50] a command is an order a command is an
[8:52] authority
[8:53] a command is to fulfill it and complete
[8:55] it
[8:57] um can you say amen so
[9:00] uh moses spoke things
[9:05] the prophet spoke things and the prophet
[9:08] did things moses did things
[9:10] but moses commanded things as well and
[9:13] what moses
[9:14] did was different than what he commanded
[9:17] moses did miracles moses was used to
[9:20] open the red sea
[9:21] moses brought the plagues in egypt he
[9:23] spoke them
[9:24] moses did many mighty wonders to prove
[9:27] to the people that god
[9:29] was real and god was in their midst and
[9:31] god was ready to take them out
[9:33] there was many things that moses did but
[9:35] there was things that moses commanded
[9:37] and that wasn't fulfilled into the
[9:39] joshua commission came
[9:41] and we've been trying to preach in this
[9:42] that we're no longer under the moses
[9:44] commission
[9:45] we're under the joshua commission
[9:48] anybody who's still living back in the
[9:49] moses commission is missing where we're
[9:51] at now
[9:52] it's a different season if it's it's a
[9:54] different time can you say man
[9:56] we are under spiritually speaking this
[9:58] joshua commission
[9:59] joshua did not represent heaven joshua
[10:02] will represent the battle
[10:03] to take everything that was yours in
[10:06] jesus christ can you say amen
[10:08] that's why the the seven seals were
[10:10] taken off the book in the last days
[10:12] and the book is the jesus christ is the
[10:15] book
[10:15] and the bride is the words in the book
[10:17] can you say amen
[10:18] that that's what the truth is is that he
[10:20] gave took the seals off
[10:22] your inheritance and revealing it to you
[10:24] in this hour
[10:25] so you could do what so you could take
[10:27] your inheritance
[10:28] everything that's mine i want to take
[10:30] what's mine every spiritual
[10:32] every part of a spiritual life living in
[10:34] jesus christ
[10:35] i'm taking it back from the enemy
[10:39] praise the lord i'm going to preach
[10:41] today whether i get a lot of amens or
[10:43] not
[10:44] praise the lord but you know you know
[10:46] you helped the preacher preach right
[10:49] so god opened the red sea but that
[10:51] wasn't the command of the order
[10:53] god did mighty miracles but that wasn't
[10:55] the order did you know that that wasn't
[10:56] the order
[10:57] the ephesians for the church is god's
[10:59] order
[11:00] bringing them into their inheritance and
[11:02] into the promised land many of these
[11:04] things you know
[11:04] but i'm just giving a foundation here
[11:06] now notice the words
[11:08] joshua did moses spoke but joshua did
[11:11] what god said the people under the
[11:13] joshua commission
[11:15] carried out what moses spoke under the
[11:18] holy ghost which is
[11:19] joshua was a type of the holy ghost let
[11:21] me say it again the people
[11:23] under the joshua commission carried out
[11:26] what moses spoke under the holy ghost
[11:31] the joshua commission is more than just
[11:34] speaking something or repeating
[11:35] something
[11:36] it's more than the prophet speaking the
[11:39] joshua commission remember this
[11:40] why this series came up one of the
[11:42] reasons why this series came up to me a
[11:44] few
[11:45] a couple years ago now was someone had
[11:47] quoted uh here in the message and said
[11:49] that the the only thing the joshua
[11:51] commissioned was for joshua to point the
[11:53] people to moses
[11:55] and i thought about wait a minute that's
[11:57] not scriptural
[11:58] all the fivefold ministry needs to do is
[12:01] keep pointing back to moses
[12:02] no that's not true what we're pointing
[12:04] the people to
[12:06] is what moses said not to moses
[12:09] not the prophet what did he say and what
[12:11] did it mean to my life
[12:12] and how am i supposed to be fulfilling
[12:14] it
[12:16] so that's the joshua commission and
[12:18] that's where we're at today
[12:20] any spirit that tries to take you back
[12:22] under the moses commission
[12:23] it's not taking you forward it's taking
[12:25] you backwards
[12:27] praise the lord so that some of these
[12:30] things you know because we've preached
[12:31] on them but
[12:32] the joshua commission is more than just
[12:34] quoting moses
[12:40] the joshua commission is more than just
[12:42] quoting my i
[12:43] i think it's so funny that my my wife
[12:45] says something
[12:46] in the early days when she was a little
[12:48] girl she was in a certain church and
[12:50] and uh you know that's before we have
[12:52] these uh ipads and
[12:54] the quotes and all the technology and
[12:55] everything and uh
[12:58] you know i can preach without it i don't
[13:00] really need all of it
[13:01] but you know before we had all that
[13:03] ministers will come to the pope but she
[13:04] remembers that as a little girl
[13:06] you know this brother had this pastor
[13:08] had an altar
[13:09] and he had all the red volume books of
[13:11] brother branham all the quotes and he
[13:12] had to bring them all
[13:13] and she remembers stacks of books being
[13:15] on the altar
[13:16] and that's basically all he did is just
[13:18] get up and read this one and lay
[13:20] this one aside and get over here and
[13:22] read this one read it and that was the
[13:23] service
[13:24] no wonder she didn't get the holy ghost
[13:26] unto that
[13:29] takes an atmosphere to bring the holy
[13:31] ghost can you say amen
[13:33] a new birth in jesus christ takes an
[13:35] atmosphere
[13:37] hello so it's not good enough just to
[13:39] quote the bible
[13:40] it's not good enough just to quote the
[13:42] message but we got to be praying for an
[13:44] atmosphere that our children can be
[13:46] born again by the word of god
[13:49] and we know it takes atmosphere to do it
[13:51] now if these things are a little strange
[13:53] to you this morning maybe you've never
[13:54] heard this before
[13:55] i just say give me a chance because i
[13:57] think i got something here this morning
[13:58] that will help you
[14:00] god's transition is to speak to his
[14:02] prophet but then when he's done with his
[14:04] prophet
[14:04] those words continue on this bible is
[14:07] full of words of
[14:08] of prophets can you say amen we're
[14:11] living of what we say i'm living my
[14:12] bible
[14:12] in my bible it's mostly the word of
[14:14] prophets can you say amen
[14:16] and so but we're not glorifying the
[14:18] prophet
[14:19] we are saying what did the prophet say
[14:21] that i'm to be living
[14:23] the life of jesus christ
[14:27] lord help me this morning praise the
[14:29] lord so it's to carry out what he
[14:30] commands it's not just to quote it
[14:32] there's a difference in an order spoken
[14:34] or given and an order being carried out
[14:36] so this let me just quickly now move
[14:39] this trickle down
[14:40] uh and and for those who are new this
[14:42] morning who don't who don't know us
[14:44] okay we are under the influence of the
[14:47] word of a prophet
[14:48] that jesus said would come in the last
[14:50] days and restore all things
[14:51] jesus himself said elijah will come and
[14:54] restore all things
[14:56] and not the personality not the person
[15:00] of him but the person of the word jesus
[15:02] christ
[15:03] spoken by jesus christ in joshua's day
[15:06] moses was no longer around when joshua
[15:08] came moses my servant is dead
[15:10] but now that joshua continued what he
[15:12] said and to fulfill what he said
[15:14] the emphasis was not on moses but on the
[15:17] holy ghost and joshua leading the people
[15:19] it was on the fulfillment of what was
[15:21] spoke by a prophet
[15:23] even jesus himself was a prophet he was
[15:25] the ultimate prophet can you say amen
[15:28] and my desire in my life is to fulfill
[15:32] what he said about me
[15:36] whatever the word said about me i want
[15:39] to do it
[15:40] i want and i don't want to leave
[15:41] anything undone
[15:43] i don't want to pick and choose what i
[15:45] want out of it
[15:48] through joshua moses could ride this
[15:50] trail again
[15:52] excuse me through joshua moses could
[15:55] ride this trail again
[15:56] and he was by the authority of the
[15:58] message by the word of the message that
[16:00] was in joshua
[16:01] and the people could write on and carry
[16:03] out the commission
[16:04] in that type because there's no you
[16:05] can't make the type fit any other thing
[16:07] the type is that moses
[16:09] was not there but what moses spoke was
[16:11] being
[16:12] carried out can you say amen last point
[16:14] i want to make in this foundation is
[16:16] that
[16:17] this joshua commission was a battle
[16:20] it was not a picnic
[16:23] the joshua commission of the message of
[16:26] christ of the last days
[16:28] is a battle don't make it anything else
[16:32] can i get an amen it was
[16:36] battles but it was victories as well
[16:39] it was a victory to get something that
[16:41] belongs to you
[16:42] and to take all of it not half of it not
[16:44] a quarter of it
[16:45] but to take all of it to leave nothing
[16:47] undone the joshua commission is not to
[16:50] sit around and just listen to moses
[16:51] the joshua commission is a battle to
[16:54] take what belongs to you
[16:55] i asked you today are you under this
[16:57] joshua commission
[16:59] are you under just moses or are you
[17:00] under the joshua holy ghost to lead you
[17:03] and to say what is mine as a christian
[17:06] what is my inheritance what has christ
[17:08] given me can you say amen
[17:10] lord i want to leave nothing undone i
[17:12] want it all
[17:14] i want it all now what's funny about
[17:17] people is they'll get that way when they
[17:18] got a literal inheritance
[17:19] when they hear their grandpa left them
[17:21] inheritance they get very greedy
[17:23] sometimes
[17:24] and i won't take more than what's mine i
[17:26] won't fight over what's not well some
[17:28] people do that they fight they want more
[17:29] than what's theirs
[17:30] but that whatever is mine in the
[17:32] inheritance
[17:33] and they go to the court they go in the
[17:34] conference room and the lawyer reads it
[17:36] and they're finding out what belongs to
[17:39] me people are so adamant about it
[17:41] but the bible promised to give the book
[17:44] back to the people that you have an
[17:45] inheritance
[17:46] that adam lost in the garden it went
[17:48] back to the hands of the original owner
[17:50] that adam held the title deed to this
[17:52] earth he was a minor son of god on earth
[17:56] i'm just backtracking so we understand
[17:58] what i'm preaching this morning
[18:00] is that okay adam lost the title deed
[18:03] and ownership to this earth that
[18:04] belonged to him
[18:05] went back to the hands of the original
[18:06] owner but revelations 5 says
[18:08] he begins to bring that inheritance back
[18:11] to his people
[18:12] and hand it back into the people's hands
[18:15] why could he because of calvary
[18:17] because of that cross now the ways made
[18:20] for you to take your inheritance back
[18:22] people get so adamant
[18:24] i want what's mine i want every dime if
[18:26] i get a thousand dollars i want every
[18:28] dime of that thousand dollars
[18:30] i want it why don't we be that way when
[18:32] it comes to your spiritual life
[18:35] is anybody listening to me this morning
[18:37] why
[18:38] people don't get up and fight the enemy
[18:42] to say satan i won't let you take away
[18:45] from me
[18:45] what is all of mine in jesus christ he
[18:48] gave it to me
[18:49] he purchased me at calvary he gave me an
[18:51] inheritance
[18:52] why don't we get at him and just just
[18:54] like a literal inheritance to say
[18:56] i'm sorry i'm not greedy it belongs to
[18:58] me and i want all of it in jesus christ
[19:01] everything that i'm supposed to be
[19:02] living every victory i'm supposed to
[19:04] come to
[19:05] if i'm to every gift i'm supposed to
[19:07] manifest whatever it is that's in christ
[19:09] i want it this morning somebody say
[19:12] praise the lord let's give the lord a
[19:14] hand
[19:15] i want it i want all of it
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:19] and i'm not going to leave anything
[19:20] undone
[19:22] praise the lord it's a battle so i just
[19:25] want to say
[19:26] anybody in the message who makes the
[19:28] joshua commission something different
[19:30] than a battle is a deception
[19:34] josh the joshua commission is not a land
[19:37] of
[19:38] intellectual knowledge
[19:41] can you say amen the joshua commission
[19:44] is not an easy predestinated floating
[19:46] into the rapture
[19:48] there's no scriptures in joshua
[19:52] that talk about just easily floating
[19:55] into
[19:55] the inheritance it's
[19:58] all battle it's all bloody battle it's a
[20:02] fight every day
[20:04] so the whoever in the message or
[20:06] anywhere else is preaching
[20:07] christianity and a message believer's
[20:09] life to be some
[20:10] easy we just float along we're
[20:12] predestinated casarasura
[20:14] until the rapture we just lay around and
[20:16] wait for us to be raptured
[20:18] that's not the joshua commission the
[20:20] john which of joshua is an everyday
[20:22] fight until we get out of here
[20:26] and it's a deception to make it just
[20:28] some intellectual convention
[20:30] where we quote the prophet no a believer
[20:32] it's a rugged every day
[20:34] serving the lord saying devil you will
[20:36] not take what's mine
[20:38] and most of it is a mind battle all the
[20:41] time
[20:42] every day believers fight a mind battle
[20:45] the same one that jesus christ fought
[20:47] when he was here the same devil that
[20:49] came to jesus himself
[20:51] and made him question whether he was the
[20:53] son of god
[20:54] if you were a son of god if thou be and
[20:57] he said satan get thee behind me
[20:59] and he quoted the word back to him we
[21:02] fight the same enemy all the time
[21:06] this thing's a battle not a picnic
[21:09] it'll be a battle till we get out of
[21:11] here and if anybody's noticed i don't
[21:13] know if you notice
[21:14] the battle gets more intense every week
[21:18] the battles the devil our enemy is
[21:21] getting more intense and he's fighting
[21:22] this congregation every week
[21:24] fighting to split fighting this fighting
[21:26] that you know we don't have to worry
[21:28] about all this happening in the
[21:29] government
[21:30] i wouldn't worry about it it's not worth
[21:32] it
[21:34] but you better watch the enemy trying to
[21:36] take you
[21:37] and take what belongs to you to destroy
[21:40] unity in the body
[21:42] to detach you away from the word you
[21:45] better be on your toes
[21:46] because that battle intensifies every
[21:48] week we have a real enemy
[21:50] and we have a battle and we're not a
[21:51] battle just to lose we're here to win
[21:54] can you say man i don't like trump's
[21:56] attitude about always winning he's a
[21:58] sore loser but i'll tell you we could
[22:00] take a little bit of his win attitude
[22:02] about the devil and say i when i go to
[22:04] battle with the devil i'm going to win
[22:07] he causes me always to triumph in jesus
[22:09] christ
[22:10] i will always try up because i have the
[22:13] holy ghost
[22:15] somebody say praise the lord so this is
[22:18] a battle it's not a
[22:19] you know just a sunday school story here
[22:21] we're in a battle every day
[22:23] and the joshua commission it's war john
[22:26] i wish we had seen that song
[22:27] this means war this means war because
[22:29] this is a war all the time
[22:31] and the joshua commission is to go fight
[22:33] for the land the land
[22:35] of the lot not the land of intellectual
[22:37] giants the land of
[22:38] all the promises of god of who you are
[22:42] and who you will be that's your land
[22:46] that's your land what did joshua the
[22:49] people do with the promise
[22:51] more than talk about it more than have
[22:54] meetings and dazzle
[22:55] in a convention with quotes more than
[22:58] try to interpret what the prophet said
[23:01] here in joshua is no idolizing and
[23:03] deifying moses
[23:05] i know i'm saying some straight things
[23:06] this morning but anytime in the bible
[23:08] they deified a prophet god was against
[23:10] it
[23:12] the joshua commission is not to deify
[23:14] and to idolize
[23:16] any prophet moses or any prophet you
[23:19] can't find that in the book of joshua
[23:22] so don't do it jesus christ
[23:25] is the hero around here it's not paul
[23:28] lafontaine it's not william branham
[23:30] it's not any prophet of the bible it's
[23:33] what christ
[23:34] did through those prophets and what he
[23:36] spoke through those prophets
[23:38] he is the one glorified in this place
[23:42] today
[23:44] and if he does anything in your life
[23:46] he's glorified as well in your life true
[23:48] believers today
[23:50] are not still debating over things
[23:52] they're fighting for things
[23:58] i think some of these could go on your
[23:59] refrigerator this week these are pretty
[24:01] good quotes
[24:02] lord gave me true believers today are
[24:04] not still debating over
[24:06] the interpretation of the message
[24:07] they're fighting for the spiritual life
[24:10] that's in it we're fighting for the
[24:13] spiritual life of it it belongs to us
[24:17] so now i want to transition to this
[24:19] other thought in
[24:20] verse 15 it said josh so did joshua
[24:24] he left nothing undone so let me take
[24:27] a few minutes and i want to get to this
[24:29] part that really speaks to me
[24:33] wouldn't you love to have a warrior that
[24:34] leaves nothing undone
[24:36] that's what israel had he was determined
[24:39] he was going to leave anything out he
[24:41] wasn't going to let
[24:43] some devil stay in this little part of
[24:44] the land because it was harder to to
[24:46] root them out
[24:48] he had the mentality just like a few
[24:50] chapters ago
[24:52] there was those five kings and they
[24:53] caught the five kings
[24:55] and they destroyed all the the nations
[24:59] but
[24:59] he said put the five kings in a cave and
[25:01] put a rock in front of it and i'll deal
[25:03] with them later
[25:04] he didn't just say let the five kings go
[25:06] put him away i'll deal with that later
[25:07] because he's he's going to every crevice
[25:08] everything
[25:09] everything has to be destroyed that's
[25:11] taking their land away from him he puts
[25:13] them inside brings them out later
[25:14] makes those five kings a spectacle puts
[25:17] his foot on the
[25:18] on the neck of one of them and lets all
[25:20] the heads of israel say
[25:22] give them faith to realize this is what
[25:25] you can do to your enemy
[25:27] this is what you can do to satan he's
[25:29] not stomping on you all week
[25:31] but you're putting on your foot on the
[25:33] head of the enemy
[25:36] and that image just stuck in their mind
[25:39] and he said i can do it he said this is
[25:42] how i can live
[25:43] and he gave them faith for the next
[25:44] battle
[25:46] things over your head this week
[25:50] things over your head are under his feet
[26:01] praise the lord so he left nothing
[26:03] undone
[26:04] he what that says to us this morning
[26:08] the joshua commission never leaves
[26:11] something out
[26:12] or leaves something undone or makes
[26:14] something unimportant
[26:15] it's embracing all of this word and
[26:18] fighting for all of it
[26:22] joshua may have been the first one who
[26:24] maybe said
[26:26] uh the devil's in the details he might
[26:29] have been the first one who said that
[26:32] because that's the way he approached
[26:34] this battle and this inheritance and
[26:35] this word from the prophet
[26:37] he said the devil's in the details
[26:38] because if we let him
[26:41] let a little detail pass if we leave
[26:43] something undone and unaddressed
[26:45] the devil would be in the details the
[26:47] devil is going to start to work in that
[26:50] so we can't leave anything undone joshua
[26:53] didn't leave
[26:54] anything undone literally in this case
[26:56] when you say the devils and the details
[26:58] literally the devils are in
[26:59] the devil is in the details in your life
[27:02] literally the devil
[27:04] and so in this case the enemy was in
[27:06] little places and he had to be rooted
[27:07] out
[27:08] they couldn't leave something unfinished
[27:09] and if you leave something unfinished in
[27:12] your life
[27:13] and justify it or put it off it'll come
[27:15] back to haunt you someday
[27:18] as a believer you'll have to deal with
[27:20] it someday
[27:21] can you say that i'm going to get
[27:23] practical here because that's my
[27:24] ministry
[27:25] my ministry is not to say stay up here
[27:27] somewhere but i'm going to get right
[27:28] down where we live is that okay with
[27:30] everybody
[27:30] that's the way i try to do so now if you
[27:32] leave something unfinished
[27:34] under this joshua commission he left
[27:36] nothing undone if you leave something
[27:38] unfinished it'll come back to haunt you
[27:40] someday
[27:41] we must take the word for all of our
[27:43] lives and what it is and so we're
[27:44] grateful for a warrior joshua how
[27:47] and how he handled the message the way
[27:49] joshua handled the message of moses
[27:51] he says we must take it all and we must
[27:54] leave nothing
[27:55] undone we must cover all the bases we
[27:57] must be
[27:58] interested that if it was important
[28:00] enough for the prophet
[28:02] to say that it's important enough for us
[28:04] to do
[28:07] if it was important enough for god to
[28:09] speak it through the prophet
[28:10] then it's important for us to do can you
[28:13] say amen
[28:14] the message of christ in the wrong hands
[28:17] can get mishandled
[28:19] and we suffer for that when it gets
[28:20] mishandled it leaves parts undone
[28:23] it leaves parts out joshua said it's all
[28:26] so important can you say that
[28:32] this bible
[28:36] this is not a buffet
[28:41] where we just come and pick and choose
[28:42] what parts we want
[28:45] systems of denomination tend to pick
[28:48] out what they want and leave out what
[28:50] they want
[28:51] and i think we should leave it alone and
[28:54] believe all of it
[28:56] you may not be living all of it but you
[28:58] say i want to live all of it
[29:00] but one thing we don't want to do is
[29:02] leave certain parts out can you say man
[29:04] we don't want to leave little parts out
[29:06] we want to we don't want to leave parts
[29:07] undone this is not a buffet and the
[29:10] message itself is not a buffet
[29:13] where we pick and choose what we want
[29:16] out of it
[29:17] it isn't that we pick what parts we want
[29:19] to emphasize
[29:21] and ignore other ones sometimes in the
[29:24] message
[29:25] we have picked out certain parts and
[29:27] emphasized certain parts
[29:29] and we've de-emphasized other parts of
[29:32] it
[29:33] and in doing that sometimes we can leave
[29:37] important parts out
[29:41] i'm talking about the history now of our
[29:43] years
[29:44] moses took what god commanded and joshua
[29:47] said we're
[29:48] not going to leave anything undone if we
[29:49] have received a message
[29:51] then we should have the the heart to say
[29:53] hey
[29:54] it's all important to us let's not leave
[29:58] anything undone
[30:00] amen and so
[30:03] it must it you know it's like a wedding
[30:07] you know there's so many important parts
[30:08] to a wedding has anybody ever heard a
[30:10] minister
[30:11] get nervous and forget certain things he
[30:14] was supposed to say
[30:15] like important parts anybody that's
[30:18] happened
[30:19] it's happened he's it forgot certain
[30:21] things that had to take place and should
[30:23] have been said
[30:24] and because i've been in that place so
[30:26] many times of
[30:27] reading from that book and then you
[30:29] missed something that was really
[30:30] important
[30:31] and it's really bad when you do if you
[30:34] feel bad about it and i remember
[30:37] a few years ago it was quite a few years
[30:39] ago 15 years ago i was asked to do a
[30:40] wedding in africa tanzania
[30:42] and this couple had always wanted me to
[30:44] do their wedding
[30:46] they had read some of my articles and
[30:47] different things and so they did so well
[30:49] i couldn't i couldn't go the date that
[30:52] they set
[30:54] so i said you know i can't come now they
[30:56] said when can you come he said well we
[30:57] can
[30:57] i can make it next year for the
[30:59] convention and come over for that part
[31:01] you know what they said we'll wait
[31:08] i said you will that's sure different
[31:12] some of the american
[31:14] kids that can't wait for nothing
[31:18] boom i can't get all everything in quick
[31:21] enough and decisions have already been
[31:22] made
[31:23] they said we'll wait for a year to you
[31:25] can perform the wedding
[31:27] and uh so i went over and got there and
[31:30] i talked to him a little bit before the
[31:31] wedding and
[31:32] so i said what do you guys want you know
[31:34] and and so
[31:36] they said we'd like you to do some of
[31:37] the things the americans do in their
[31:38] wedding
[31:39] and we'd like the kiss we don't do the
[31:40] kiss here they said we'd like the kiss
[31:43] i said all right i'll write it down you
[31:45] do the kiss you know so we did it got it
[31:47] all set and everything so i got into
[31:48] that wedding and we did the whole thing
[31:50] and i got towards the end of that thing
[31:53] and when i
[31:54] pronounced the man and wife the place
[31:56] erupted
[31:57] into this
[32:00] how you do it michael i don't know
[32:06] and it so scared me
[32:09] and took me by surprise
[32:12] that i forgot the kiss
[32:16] the one thing that they had asked for
[32:18] the important part
[32:20] completely forgot you can imagine how
[32:22] bad i felt i just pulled myself together
[32:25] and i said okay
[32:25] say a prayer get rid of this thing i
[32:27] don't know what's going on here
[32:29] so i wouldn't found him at the reception
[32:31] i was so apologetic i said i cannot
[32:32] believe i forgot that the most important
[32:35] part
[32:36] well not really but to them it was
[32:37] important you know
[32:39] kiss is important you know in a marriage
[32:43] don't forget the kisses
[32:48] all right all you old people you don't
[32:51] want to admit that but it's
[32:52] don't forget the important things
[32:54] special to the wife can you say amen
[32:58] easy for young couples not to forget but
[33:00] you leave after a while you leave and
[33:02] this is a quote brother branham says
[33:04] quite often he says
[33:05] we look for the big things and we leave
[33:07] the little things undone sure enough i
[33:10] got there i said
[33:11] i remember finish my story i said i am
[33:13] so sorry i just reached over
[33:15] they were up front at the reception i'm
[33:17] sorry i forgot the kiss
[33:19] i'm so sorry oh it's okay brother it's
[33:22] okay
[33:22] it's fine we have our whole marriage to
[33:24] kiss
[33:29] we'll be fine but i could tell they were
[33:31] a little disappointed because that's the
[33:33] one thing they'd asked for was the kiss
[33:34] and i forgot it in the ceremony
[33:36] and i've had other ceremonies where i've
[33:37] forgotten it feels terrible
[33:39] you can't forget important parts you
[33:41] might have other things but there's
[33:42] important parts like
[33:43] man and wife that's probably don't
[33:45] forget that one i remember there was a
[33:47] wedding in pennsylvania a few
[33:48] years ago and i was standing there the
[33:50] father was with the daughter i might as
[33:52] well give myself away here
[33:54] internationally and i was just
[33:57] nervous and i said who giveth this man
[34:00] to be married to this woman
[34:06] and the father's kind of stumbling
[34:08] around
[34:10] well that's not how really it happened
[34:12] it's happening
[34:15] and i quickly just i i mean the woman to
[34:18] be married to this and i just basically
[34:20] forgot what i was supposed to say and
[34:21] it's right there in front of me and
[34:23] you know you have to be there in my
[34:25] position it's rough don't forget the
[34:26] important parts and i said in this
[34:28] couple
[34:28] i'm so sorry they said we'll it's it's
[34:30] fine it's all right brother we're glad
[34:32] you come and done the wedding
[34:33] and we have lots of time for kissing i
[34:35] said praise the lord i felt better about
[34:36] it actually
[34:37] but you can't leave the in a marriage
[34:39] you can't leave brother abraham says it
[34:41] several times he says
[34:42] we put emphasis on the big things
[34:46] and we leave the lesser things we leave
[34:48] them to the side
[34:50] and i believe that's what we do
[34:51] sometimes in the message
[34:53] is we put emphasis on certain things
[34:57] but we leave some of the important
[34:58] things out
[35:00] you guys have those scriptures of the
[35:01] pharisees here's a group that did the
[35:03] same thing jesus said
[35:04] you have those two scriptures uh there
[35:06] somewhere of the pharisees
[35:09] i thought this was interesting to point
[35:11] out because when when god sends
[35:12] something
[35:13] and sends a message even through jesus
[35:15] christ
[35:16] when he sends through the prophets and
[35:18] all these other things
[35:20] i'm skipping ahead here in my notes but
[35:22] if you guys have those scriptures do you
[35:23] have those
[35:24] matthew 23 23
[35:28] will unto you scribes and pharisees
[35:29] hypocrites for you pay tithe of men and
[35:32] anise and coming and have omitted the
[35:35] weightier matters of the law
[35:37] judgment mercy faith these ought ye to
[35:40] have done
[35:41] and not to leave the other undone the
[35:43] next scripture says the same thing
[35:45] but in just i want to add it because
[35:47] it's just a little bit different way you
[35:48] guys have the next one
[35:50] luke 11 42 but
[35:53] woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe
[35:56] meant
[35:56] and rule in all manner of herbs and
[35:58] passover judgment
[36:00] and the love of god
[36:04] these are ye have done and not to leave
[36:07] the
[36:08] other undone
[36:11] so it should be noted that religious
[36:13] spirits and no matter what age you live
[36:16] in
[36:17] under any message tend to take the
[36:20] message
[36:22] and emphasize certain things and leave
[36:25] other things
[36:26] out that's some pretty important things
[36:28] they've left out
[36:29] the love of god
[36:32] you see that never take place in our
[36:34] message it's happened
[36:37] so i've watched since a kid emphasis put
[36:40] on
[36:41] clothing
[36:45] is clothing a part of what we talk about
[36:47] in the bible
[36:48] yes of course i've seen emphasis on
[36:51] clothing
[36:53] i've seen emphasis on a woman's position
[36:56] not the man so much but the woman let's
[36:59] get her in order
[37:03] let's get her in order and everything
[37:05] else will fall in place
[37:08] and if a guy is saying that it sounds
[37:10] like he needs to get in order
[37:14] come on people you know what i'm saying
[37:15] is true
[37:18] emphasis on getting her emphasis on
[37:20] marriage and divorce and what her
[37:21] position
[37:22] is and what she should do and emphasis
[37:24] on this and we pull out parts of it
[37:26] and we put all the quotes and scriptures
[37:28] together but we tend to
[37:29] when we're being what we're doing is
[37:31] we're emphasizing certain things like
[37:33] the tithe
[37:33] or church order don't you come in church
[37:36] don't do this in church
[37:37] and we through the years so many years
[37:39] we took what we wanted to out of it and
[37:42] emphasize certain things
[37:43] and just preach that and think if i can
[37:45] just preach these outward things
[37:47] and get it all together then everything
[37:49] will be okay
[37:50] but you're forgetting very important
[37:52] things
[37:54] that children need a new birth
[37:57] can you say man our children need a
[37:59] birth just like you got one
[38:02] and it isn't just a carnal intellectual
[38:04] atmosphere that brings a new birth
[38:06] it's an atmosphere of the holy ghost
[38:08] that brings new birth
[38:09] the word being preached in an atmosphere
[38:11] of the holy ghost if our kids don't get
[38:13] the holy ghost then they're not going to
[38:14] be able to survive
[38:15] in the day that we live in you don't
[38:18] leave the holy ghost out
[38:20] you don't leave the moving of the spirit
[38:22] out the moving of the spirit oh that was
[38:24] that was nothing that's
[38:24] not important well my prophet said it is
[38:27] important
[38:29] that the spirit have freedom to move and
[38:31] to change our lives
[38:32] by that word it's always important
[38:37] who made it not important who has
[38:39] bewitched you
[38:40] and said certain things if you dress
[38:42] this way if you act this way
[38:44] if you've got your dress just this way
[38:46] then you'll make it just fine
[38:49] that's a deception clothing doesn't get
[38:52] you into heaven
[38:53] what you wear doesn't get you into
[38:55] heaven but
[38:57] as i said i guess i'll say it
[39:01] clothing's important because the bible
[39:02] makes it important
[39:04] don't dump it all out it's important to
[39:07] the bible it's important to the prophet
[39:09] as things were said
[39:10] but what i'm talking about today is
[39:13] people
[39:14] that take certain things and emphasize
[39:16] and the moving of the spirit and the
[39:19] things that the prophet talks about
[39:20] let me just surprise you look at this
[39:22] quote in invisible union of the bride of
[39:24] jesus christ
[39:25] can i take a few more minutes this
[39:26] morning
[39:28] look at this says he says and if a woman
[39:31] won't have a baby for her husband
[39:34] she'll take a dog or a cat or something
[39:36] she's got to mother something it's her
[39:37] nature
[39:38] and just put your seatbelt on now with
[39:40] this quote but to bear a child for her
[39:43] husband and raise it to the service of
[39:44] the lord that's entirely out of her line
[39:46] she should oh she'd be disgraced if she
[39:49] did
[39:50] by her sin-loving society of this 1965
[39:53] type of women this was said in 1965
[39:55] a true picture of the modern church
[39:57] today neither does the modern church
[39:59] want any of these here screaming
[40:01] shouting
[40:01] tongue speaking acts 238 youngins around
[40:04] her
[40:06] they dumped that out years ago and yet
[40:09] that was the birth of the church
[40:12] now i know that we're not in the birth
[40:14] of the church
[40:16] dispensationally and i know that we're
[40:17] in the adoption time
[40:19] i understand all that but individually
[40:22] every person has to start somewhere
[40:26] in a new birth and let me remind you
[40:28] every birth
[40:29] is a mess they haven't found how to
[40:33] clean that up yet
[40:35] there's water there's blood the spirit
[40:37] of life comes in the baby
[40:38] it's a mess whether you're a millionaire
[40:41] woman or whether you're a poor woman
[40:43] a birth is a mess now how do you take
[40:46] away the mess in a birth and say
[40:48] we've got a new this is a new thing no
[40:50] you don't take it a birth is a myth
[40:52] someone cries out to god someone a lot
[40:54] of times is crying
[40:55] someone is saying i need god and i don't
[40:58] care about the world anymore and i don't
[40:59] care about everything i'm not going to
[41:01] try to figure this out anymore
[41:02] i just lay down at your altar lord take
[41:04] me do something in me
[41:06] god rips that old nature of the world
[41:09] out of them puts his own nature in there
[41:11] by a new birth
[41:12] you don't you tell me that person's not
[41:14] going to get excited
[41:15] the birth is a mess
[41:21] that's right and don't ever
[41:24] let intellectual giants take away that
[41:27] principle
[41:28] that the birth is someone dying out and
[41:30] you they may slobber they
[41:31] i've seen them at the altar and there's
[41:33] when there's no kleenex available
[41:35] and there's slobber and there's makeup
[41:37] running and
[41:38] it is a mess they look ugly
[41:42] but to god they look beautiful
[41:46] and i just challenge you you're not
[41:49] going to get to heaven because you just
[41:50] come and just
[41:51] just agree with everything you need a
[41:53] new birth
[41:55] by jesus christ every one of you
[41:58] say well i grew up in this and i
[41:59] accepted this accepting is different
[42:02] than
[42:02] a new birth that your nature has changed
[42:06] i love you that's why i'd say that
[42:09] it says the true picture of the modern
[42:11] church today neither does the modern
[42:12] church want any of these here screaming
[42:14] shout and tongue speaking
[42:15] acts two through eight young is around
[42:17] her yeah you see she
[42:18] yeah she don't want any of them whooping
[42:20] and crying and screaming
[42:22] amen hallelujah wouldn't hurt to hear a
[42:25] few of them this morning
[42:27] why such a child would immediately put
[42:30] her out of her denomination they had one
[42:31] like that in one of the churches
[42:33] while they throw her out right quick why
[42:35] are you letting such stuff as that go on
[42:37] in your church
[42:38] screaming hallelujah stringing amen that
[42:40] might be odd to you this morning
[42:42] but listen i like the people to preach
[42:43] with me if you're excited about the word
[42:45] you should show it amen means so be it
[42:49] it means i agree it means so be it hey
[42:51] brother paul what you're preaching so be
[42:52] it in my life
[42:53] amen hallelujah praise our god
[42:57] i said it to you last sunday bring your
[42:59] praise there's things you bring to
[43:00] church
[43:02] not just your kleenex and not just your
[43:03] billfold but bring your praise
[43:06] some of you didn't do it this morning
[43:08] but i encourage you when you come to
[43:10] church
[43:10] come to have church somebody say praise
[43:13] the lord
[43:18] there's probably some of you never come
[43:20] back again but anyway i'm gonna continue
[43:22] but she won't she don't want none of
[43:24] them screaming hauling blabbering
[43:26] acts 2 38 that's in the bible that's how
[43:28] it happened
[43:29] they were drunk the people said that
[43:31] when they come out of the room they were
[43:32] drunk
[43:34] birthed by the spirit and the word for
[43:35] that day birthed by the word for that
[43:37] day
[43:38] they come out of there and they said
[43:40] it's it's this certain hour of the day
[43:41] it's not night and the party animals
[43:43] they look like they're coming out of
[43:44] that upper room drunk well they're not
[43:46] drunk peter said
[43:47] as you're thinking they're drunk on a
[43:50] promise being fulfilled by the word of
[43:52] god
[43:53] and they come out of there staggering
[43:55] down those stairs
[43:57] gloria said praise our god hallelujah
[44:00] what he said in joel 2 28 joe said when
[44:03] he said
[44:03] it's happening right now to me his word
[44:06] is being fulfilled
[44:07] they staggered and they began to say
[44:09] praise our god and tell what he was
[44:11] doing
[44:11] and god did a supernatural thing all the
[44:13] nations heard them in their own language
[44:15] they weren't speaking another language
[44:17] they were just glorifying god
[44:19] but all the nations heard what they were
[44:21] saying in their own language
[44:25] i'm not trying to work up something this
[44:26] morning i'm pointing you the book of
[44:28] acts birth can you say amen
[44:30] we're getting away from a genuine birth
[44:34] we don't have a right to eliminate the
[44:36] important things in the scripture
[44:39] we don't have a right to just uh gloss
[44:42] this over and make it so
[44:44] pretty and everybody's so starchy we
[44:47] don't have a right to do that
[44:48] i say let the holy spirit do what he
[44:50] wants to do
[44:52] what if it gets out of order well god if
[44:55] he's there will put it back in order
[44:59] the prophet said i'd rather have some
[45:00] wildfire than no
[45:02] fire at all how many remembers that
[45:04] quote
[45:06] you i ask you would you rather have a
[45:08] wildfire or no fire at all
[45:10] when you need a fire i say i'd rather
[45:13] have wildfire
[45:15] and god have to put it in order than to
[45:17] not have any fire at all
[45:19] nothing worse than going to church with
[45:20] no fire god send your fire of your holy
[45:23] ghost can you say man
[45:25] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[45:26] are it would certainly embarrass her it
[45:28] would ruin her and her educated
[45:30] ethical scientific society church that
[45:32] she belonged to here
[45:34] they would throw her out at the next
[45:36] council she can't have it so she won't
[45:39] don't want to be pregnant with the word
[45:41] because that's the only
[45:43] that's the only kind that the word can
[45:45] bring forth
[45:46] hello those screaming shouting acts 2
[45:50] youngins is the only kind the word can
[45:53] bring
[45:53] forth don't try to change the book of
[45:56] acts
[45:57] that's the birth of the church and
[45:59] that's the birth of an individual
[46:01] i'm not trying to work up something this
[46:03] morning i'm not trying to work up
[46:04] emotion
[46:05] if it's real you don't have to work up
[46:06] emotion
[46:09] whatever it is if the spirit of god
[46:11] overtakes you in a new birth
[46:13] you're going to express it some way
[46:16] it's not a mechanical i'm giving an
[46:18] example
[46:20] of that's the only kind the word can
[46:22] bring forth born of the spirit of god
[46:24] it has the spirit of god in it no
[46:26] intellectual church joining creed going
[46:27] bobbed hair painted face there's no such
[46:29] a thing as that
[46:30] in all of it you don't find that in the
[46:32] word of god you find an old-fashioned
[46:34] sanctified holy ghost-filled child born
[46:37] of the spirit of god
[46:38] streaming hollering shouting praising
[46:41] god
[46:43] praise the lord
[46:46] you don't want to kill the spirit we
[46:48] don't want to let put away the important
[46:50] things can you say man
[46:52] i might have to find a place to end this
[46:57] so we've seen emphasis on drafts we've
[46:59] seen emphasis on
[47:01] pastors authority in the message we've
[47:04] seen emphasis on predestination
[47:06] we've seen emphasis on paying your
[47:08] tithes church order
[47:10] you can have all that but leave other
[47:13] things undone
[47:14] can i get an agreement today you can
[47:16] have all the outside
[47:18] looking right you can clean up a pig on
[47:22] the outside
[47:23] but there's still a pig by nature
[47:28] the nature's got to change you clean up
[47:31] a pig
[47:33] you make them smell good you put them on
[47:35] the front row
[47:37] you polish at least to say amen you
[47:39] force him to do everything
[47:42] and you take the leash off and he will
[47:45] run for the first
[47:46] mud hole he can find right back to the
[47:49] world
[47:50] because you haven't changed this nature
[47:52] but you change the nature by jesus
[47:54] christ
[47:56] he's not going to desire the things of
[47:57] the world anymore
[48:00] it's truth isn't it
[48:03] you can have all this and leave the
[48:05] other things done and when i started
[48:09] when i started to feed on the message
[48:10] for the first time when i was 16 years
[48:12] old and i started to feed on
[48:13] the message of christ there was a i
[48:15] realized there's a lot more in there
[48:16] than
[48:16] what i realized it wasn't just doctrine
[48:18] it wasn't just clothes
[48:20] but my position was revealed in the book
[48:23] of life
[48:25] he is the book she's the words in the
[48:26] book this wasn't a new religion
[48:28] when i read the message when i fed on
[48:30] the message of jesus christ
[48:32] this wasn't a new religion people have
[48:35] made it a religion
[48:36] but it never was a religion to me
[48:42] this is not a religion this is my land
[48:45] of inheritance that christ purchased for
[48:47] me
[48:48] and i'm ready when i when i fed on the
[48:51] word
[48:51] i said lord i'm ready to fight
[48:54] for everything that's mine
[48:58] i'm ready to go to battle i'm ready to
[49:00] go to war
[49:02] because i realize the devil squatting on
[49:04] a bunch of things that are in my life
[49:06] that
[49:06] really belongs to christ belongs to me
[49:09] and so i'm ready to fight
[49:10] i'm ready to go to war i'm ready to take
[49:12] back what's mine
[49:15] i've seen a spiritual life in the people
[49:17] of the bible i've seen a spiritual life
[49:19] they come to
[49:20] can you say amen
[49:23] so so many more examples i can give of
[49:25] things getting off track like the
[49:27] pharisees
[49:27] so many more examples let me find a
[49:30] place if i can to end this here this
[49:32] morning
[49:35] there's so much i could finish next
[49:37] sunday but just let me read a couple
[49:39] things and then we'll be
[49:40] we'll be done i pray there's a stirring
[49:43] in your heart
[49:45] whatever you think of me that's besides
[49:47] the point
[49:48] i pray there's a stirring in your heart
[49:49] to look to the word of god
[49:52] say lord have i become too starchy is
[49:54] this just a religion to me
[49:57] and a lot of times people in the message
[49:59] make it a religion to us
[50:01] parents make it a religion sometimes
[50:04] parents make it something that is just
[50:07] do's and don'ts
[50:09] how about we forgive them
[50:13] how about we not live in the past
[50:15] anymore
[50:17] how about we start enjoying our future
[50:19] walk with the lord
[50:22] how about we let the past and the past
[50:24] and look at this thing ourselves
[50:26] and say just because somebody left
[50:28] something undone
[50:31] doesn't mean i can't take it and take
[50:33] all of it
[50:34] and say i'm not going to leave any of it
[50:36] undone
[50:38] and by the help of the lord i'm going to
[50:39] emphasize the right things
[50:42] can you say amen i i want i want it all
[50:45] can you say amen
[50:47] and like jesus said to the pharisees you
[50:49] should have done this nothing
[50:50] don't leave the other things undone
[50:52] don't leave anything undone but
[50:54] you know i could talk a lot more about
[50:55] that love of god when he says to the
[50:57] pharisees
[50:57] you have admitted the love of god that's
[50:59] a pretty big charge
[51:01] that you're standing there paying your
[51:03] tithes of mint and all the other things
[51:05] they pay tithes on
[51:06] and they're going into the temple and
[51:07] they're praying and they're jesus said
[51:09] you're
[51:10] you're praying um to be seen of men
[51:14] it's all outward you pray long prayers
[51:17] you know what jesus said about the
[51:18] pharisees they're still alive today
[51:20] it's all a show pride that comes in the
[51:23] message that i'm better than the rest of
[51:25] the world i'm
[51:25] better than anybody else an outward
[51:27] pride and jesus just said
[51:30] don't leave other things undone but he
[51:31] said but he said you've admitted
[51:33] mercy and love that's pretty important
[51:36] stuff
[51:37] so could it be that you could take the
[51:39] very message of god
[51:40] and omit mercy omit the love of god
[51:45] and he says you ought to not let that
[51:47] undone
[51:49] and they they they did it they they were
[51:52] doing all this stuff
[51:54] outwardly in they were lacking things
[51:59] important things what man can take
[52:03] a true message and twist it all up
[52:07] it's happened in the past it's happened
[52:10] today
[52:12] but i'm asking you to say to the lord
[52:17] lord is there any way i can forget all
[52:20] of my history
[52:28] everything i read in the bible says you
[52:29] can start fresh
[52:33] his mercies are new every morning
[52:37] and if my dad did something wrong or my
[52:39] mom or the preacher that i was under who
[52:41] hurt me or
[52:42] whatever it is i'm able to take that
[52:43] this morning and say lord
[52:46] can i do what paul said in the bible
[52:47] forget those things which are behind
[52:51] and take another look a fresh look at
[52:53] this message
[52:55] of christ and say lord it must have been
[52:59] pretty important you sent it to us from
[53:01] your throne
[53:03] somebody's got a cloud over it and i'm
[53:06] hesitant of it
[53:07] is there any way you can just take my
[53:09] heart this morning you don't have to do
[53:11] anything you don't have to do anything
[53:13] this morning but just say lord give me a
[53:15] fresh start
[53:18] you see that i know i know well enough
[53:21] of this i'm gonna have to do this and
[53:22] i'm gonna have to do that and i'm gonna
[53:23] do that
[53:24] in order for us for me to even be
[53:26] accepted who told you that
[53:29] if you really seen calvary
[53:34] the way you should see it
[53:37] he accepted the sacrifice for your sin
[53:43] he accepted all believers at calvary
[53:49] you've already been accepted in the
[53:50] beloved
[53:53] so when you come through a surrender of
[53:55] a new birth
[53:57] that's and you say that power of calvary
[53:59] come in me and change my nature
[54:01] that's all god needs from there god
[54:04] takes over
[54:06] but i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[54:07] this yeah because somebody taught you
[54:09] that you have to do all this to be
[54:10] accepted
[54:11] you've got it wrong you've got it wrong
[54:13] the power of the cross comes in you
[54:15] and he starts to do those things
[54:18] it's a little quiet in here but i'm
[54:20] telling the truth
[54:22] telling the truth you know why it's hard
[54:23] for us to solve that because there's so
[54:25] many things the messages showed us
[54:27] that is the christian life to live and
[54:29] we got to do this we got to do that
[54:31] i know i know and we're blessed with it
[54:32] i don't i don't have a fear of that i
[54:34] just
[54:34] but i know one thing i can't live at all
[54:36] without this holy ghost
[54:40] and if he said it and he gave me the
[54:43] holy ghost then he must have a way
[54:45] for me to live it by the fire of the
[54:47] holy ghost every day
[54:49] he must it's like lord this is you this
[54:51] is you
[54:52] you bought me you purchased me you paid
[54:54] for my
[54:55] price of my sin at calvary and now you
[54:57] fill me with your spirit
[54:58] it's all you but i'm gonna surrender to
[55:01] all you
[55:03] i'm surrendering is that okay with
[55:05] everybody
[55:07] there's something i want to end on
[55:08] because years ago i did a study on
[55:10] truth and
[55:13] i called it the elements of truth
[55:17] because i began to discover discover in
[55:18] the bible
[55:20] and in the message that truth was
[55:22] mentioned
[55:24] with something else many times it wasn't
[55:25] standing alone by itself
[55:27] and we know how important truth is truth
[55:29] is believing the truth is everything
[55:31] it's so important
[55:31] jesus says you shall know the truth and
[55:33] the truth will set you free
[55:35] right so there's power and truth but
[55:38] then sometimes you see somebody who
[55:40] who they're still bound by things for
[55:42] years
[55:44] and say they have the truth well
[55:45] obviously there's something there's an
[55:46] element missing to
[55:48] truth because they're saying i believe
[55:50] truth i believe truth and they're still
[55:51] bound
[55:53] and jesus said the truth will set you
[55:54] free so there must be
[55:56] a power that goes with truth and
[55:58] elements true truth and when i begin to
[55:59] look in the bible
[56:00] i've seen sometimes it was mentioned
[56:02] truth mercy truth and mercy
[56:04] truth and mercy truth and mercy and then
[56:07] i seen truth and love
[56:09] truth and love just like jesus said
[56:10] you're omitting the love of god
[56:12] truth and love true love so i'm only
[56:14] saying that to say this you
[56:16] can say that you have truth but if it's
[56:18] without the love of god
[56:19] you don't have all the elements to it
[56:23] we believers we believe all truth has
[56:25] been revealed
[56:26] well let me see it in your attitude let
[56:28] me see it in your fire
[56:30] let me see it in your life let me see it
[56:32] in your marriage
[56:33] let me see it in your humility let me
[56:36] see it in your family
[56:38] come on now i'm a believer of all truth
[56:42] in the last days
[56:43] let me see the other elements that go
[56:45] with it
[56:47] let me see the deliverance let me see
[56:50] the power
[56:51] i'm not looking for perfection but let
[56:53] me see all that goes with truth
[56:56] if you're a believer of truth so when i
[56:59] begin to look i'm skipping through this
[57:01] i begin to look i found
[57:04] that truth is a person
[57:10] you say well i knew that maybe you knew
[57:12] that maybe you didn't know
[57:13] truth is not just the bible or written
[57:15] words truth is a person
[57:18] jesus christ i trust that he's here this
[57:20] morning
[57:22] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[57:24] the life truth is deeper than doctrine
[57:28] it's a being in the garden before the
[57:32] bible was written the tree of life was a
[57:33] person
[57:34] tree of knowledge of good and evil was a
[57:35] person she didn't know it was a tree
[57:38] oh was it something something spoke can
[57:41] you say amen
[57:43] through the serpent and pointed them to
[57:45] the wrong tree to eat off the tree of
[57:46] knowledge well
[57:47] there's something speaking there's
[57:48] somebody giving knowledge there
[57:52] when through the preaching of the word
[57:53] and the gospel personal revelation
[57:55] illuminates the soul of a person that if
[57:56] it's the true revelation of christ
[57:58] his presence has made contact with this
[58:00] person it's not a mechanical
[58:02] seminary of learning things of the bible
[58:04] i was saying it wednesday night what
[58:05] would jesus do what would jesus do and
[58:07] people are copying trying to be like
[58:09] jesus
[58:09] well that's not the full truth we're to
[58:12] have jesus living in us
[58:14] not trying to copy jesus he lives in us
[58:19] there'll be changes to that life because
[58:21] they've met the person
[58:22] because mr truth has moved in and is
[58:24] moving that person to walk in all truth
[58:27] didn't he say when the holy ghost comes
[58:28] it'll lead you and guide you
[58:30] into all truth christ is truth
[58:34] he's the embodiment of complete truth so
[58:36] if you have partial truth you don't have
[58:38] all of him yet
[58:40] all of him that you need anyway and
[58:42] might say that that because it's a
[58:44] person and not just a book
[58:46] then i believe because it's a person
[58:48] that this relationship is a love affair
[58:50] with the lord of someone you can unite
[58:53] with in
[58:54] spirit like marriage you can't unite
[58:56] with a book
[58:57] you unite with a person as much as i
[59:00] enjoyed the letters
[59:01] romantic letters from my wife after a
[59:04] while
[59:05] the letters weren't good enough i wanted
[59:09] the person
[59:12] is that is that a good illustration it's
[59:15] a person
[59:16] message is not a bunch of books and
[59:18] tapes
[59:19] the truth is not just that bible that's
[59:22] what we read and it helps us
[59:23] but it becomes a person to us that lives
[59:26] in us
[59:27] and i didn't want just all the letters i
[59:28] had the letters for
[59:30] uh letters and phone calls for
[59:34] all of about four months i guess i was
[59:37] one of those americans who rushed
[59:38] through my marriage
[59:41] just rebuked all the young people and
[59:42] i'm the one who did it too
[59:47] yep went out on our first
[59:50] going out date or whatever it was in
[59:54] may engaged by september
[59:58] married by december what a poor example
[1:00:00] i was
[1:00:02] i was 27 remember you know as i was
[1:00:05] ready to get married
[1:00:07] but i know one thing that after a while
[1:00:09] letters are okay
[1:00:11] phone calls are okay
[1:00:15] reading the word at church is okay but
[1:00:18] there's something deeper than that
[1:00:20] this is a relationship the message is a
[1:00:24] person it's christ
[1:00:26] it's not some man who brought a bunch of
[1:00:28] things no no it's much deeper than that
[1:00:30] the message is a person
[1:00:34] amen i think i'll just end right there
[1:00:36] as we just stand if you would the
[1:00:38] message
[1:00:39] and the bible all these truths
[1:00:42] is not i don't know what you've been
[1:00:45] taught
[1:00:46] even if you were grew up in our own
[1:00:47] ranks or if you grew up in denomination
[1:00:49] whatever it is
[1:00:50] it's fine i respect anyone here this
[1:00:52] morning in your upbringing
[1:00:54] more likely if you're here this morning
[1:00:55] god's dealt with you in your life
[1:00:56] somewhere
[1:00:59] god has dealt with you and if you have a
[1:01:01] hunger this morning
[1:01:03] i just would be careful that all your
[1:01:04] former teaching doesn't damage the view
[1:01:07] of jesus christ
[1:01:08] and what it should be to you okay you
[1:01:10] can have a fresh start
[1:01:12] and you can say i want it to be i want
[1:01:14] truth to be more than just words on a
[1:01:15] bible i want truth to be more than
[1:01:17] quotes
[1:01:18] and what my parents tried to get me to
[1:01:20] do i want it to be
[1:01:22] a relationship with this person because
[1:01:24] truth
[1:01:25] is a person and he's here this morning
[1:01:29] and he loves you he loved you before the
[1:01:31] foundation of the world
[1:01:32] he elected you i believe that with all
[1:01:34] my heart he just needs a response to say
[1:01:37] lord i
[1:01:38] surrender i surrender
[1:01:41] to all that truth so that i can come
[1:01:43] into
[1:01:44] relationship with you would you bow your
[1:01:46] heads and say i want that relationship
[1:01:49] but i want it with you i want that
[1:01:51] relationship
[1:01:53] maybe you don't raise your hand if you
[1:01:55] don't meet him maybe you're not there
[1:01:56] this morning
[1:01:57] but i pray down the road you'd get such
[1:01:59] a hunger i just want a relationship with
[1:02:01] the lord
[1:02:02] i want a deeper relationship with him
[1:02:05] and everything the prophet said in all
[1:02:07] the scriptures
[1:02:08] all culminates coming back to eden again
[1:02:11] in a relationship with him
[1:02:14] and if you've lost that if you've lost
[1:02:16] that relationship and it's become
[1:02:18] do's and don'ts or if it becomes
[1:02:20] something else to you
[1:02:22] i'm asking you to bring it back again
[1:02:24] and say
[1:02:25] i forg i forget the past i forget all
[1:02:28] that's been presented to me that may not
[1:02:30] be right
[1:02:31] and i start fresh it's just me and god
[1:02:33] today it's me in christ
[1:02:36] lord i know you spoke to my heart today
[1:02:38] it's just being you now
[1:02:40] may i leave this building lord beginning
[1:02:43] a relationship with you
[1:02:47] you just reach that hand up again say
[1:02:49] that's really at the end of the day
[1:02:51] brother paul that's what i want that's
[1:02:53] what i want
[1:02:55] i want to grow in a relationship with
[1:02:57] him the living word
[1:02:59] the person of jesus christ
[1:03:06] heavenly father
[1:03:09] precious lord
[1:03:12] who's gracious enough to speak through
[1:03:15] all the prophets of the bible
[1:03:17] to speak to us today because you loved
[1:03:21] us lord
[1:03:25] may the love of god be expressed through
[1:03:27] my preaching
[1:03:28] so much lord that somebody would fall in
[1:03:32] love with him today
[1:03:36] say lord forgive me
[1:03:40] lord may they cry out if they need that
