[27:39] potentially what the Lord could do to
[27:40] have a a camp here and also a place to
[27:43] house and have the retreats and thinking
[27:46] about the future generation. And it was
[27:47] such such a good time, such good input
[27:50] and uh a lot of creative ideas there and
[27:53] and I don't know if we can do all of
[27:55] them, but it sure was fun talking about
[27:56] it anyway. And uh I think sometimes God
[27:59] can drop something on somebody's heart
[28:01] and you don't think of that and say,
[28:02] "Well, we'll just put that there before
[28:04] the Lord and see if that can be done as
[28:06] well." And I certainly enjoyed it. God
[28:08] bless you all for your input and those
[28:09] that came. And um we just know the Lord,
[28:12] we're ready to go now in the rapture,
[28:14] but we have to, brother Bram said, we
[28:16] have to plant our potatoes
[28:18] for if we're going to be hundred years
[28:19] from now. And we're, oh Lord, let us not
[28:22] be another hundred years from now. But
[28:23] we have to be have wisdom to plant for
[28:26] the next generation when we're gone. We
[28:28] have to have a multi-generational vision
[28:30] that what can we do to make sure the
[28:32] word carries on being planted in the
[28:35] hearts of these children for the future
[28:37] when we're gone. So we have to have
[28:39] that. Brother Bram says live like he's
[28:41] coming right now and plan like he's
[28:43] coming 100 years from now. So we want to
[28:44] have that kind of balance. So Proverbs
[28:47] 14:12 one scripture tonight if we could
[28:50] read it together and then we'll just
[28:52] have you seated. Proverbs chapter 14
[28:56] and we'll just use just this one
[28:58] reference tonight for our subject.
[29:02] Proverbs 14 and verse 12. There is a way
[29:07] that seemth right unto a man. That means
[29:12] that um it's it can be very convincing
[29:16] that this looks like the way, this looks
[29:19] like the path. It's not something that's
[29:21] a no-brainer that you can tell that
[29:23] ain't the path. This is there is a way
[29:26] that seemth right unto a man, but the
[29:30] end thereof are the ways of death. So
[29:33] that's the ones we need the discernment
[29:35] to see what something that looks like
[29:37] the way. Um and it it it's not really
[29:40] actually the ends of it. And there's
[29:43] some things that we know after 6,000
[29:45] years we can see the fruit of them. We
[29:47] can see if someone would choose that
[29:49] direction. We've we we've got all the
[29:51] data is in. So somebody who would choose
[29:54] that particular thing, we could see
[29:56] because we already have a history of it
[29:58] and we can see where it leads. And
[30:00] that's why we can have the upper edge on
[30:02] the enemy to see the history and say,
[30:05] "Well, I know where that's going to
[30:06] lead, so I don't want to go down that
[30:08] path." That being said, tonight there's
[30:11] a way that seemth right, and that's only
[30:13] a counterfeit to the real way. And
[30:16] that's Jesus saying, "I am the way, the
[30:18] truth, and the life. He has the way for
[30:20] us." God bless you as you're seated
[30:22] tonight. May the Lord add his blessings
[30:23] to the word.
[30:26] So this evening as uh we study together
[30:29] the word, we want to take this next
[30:31] section of he cares, do you care? And
[30:35] those who those of you are not on board
[30:37] yet know know what we're doing here. if
[30:39] you took that sermon and you could
[30:41] listen to it. I think it's probably a
[30:43] couple hours so it's a longer one but uh
[30:45] we have been studying a little bit out
[30:46] of it and taking into different things
[30:48] and there's several reasons why I'm
[30:50] studying it deeply. I find it to be a
[30:52] wonderful uh deposit of God to sons and
[30:56] daughters of God this age. I find it to
[30:58] be a wonderful service. I think I said
[31:00] at the beginning that it's not a
[31:02] doctrinal sermon as such. Um, it's not
[31:05] necessarily a faith-building sermon
[31:07] because there's all different uh
[31:09] messages that came from uh the
[31:11] messenger, but I find certain uh sermons
[31:14] to be instructional
[31:16] uh to sons and daughters of God. In
[31:18] other words, it's things to teach us how
[31:21] to find the channel to God, how to find
[31:23] the way, how to get into a a channel of
[31:26] discernment that we could really get
[31:28] victories in our lives and not be blind
[31:30] to those things, but to actually find
[31:32] the channel. So, I find it to be that
[31:34] type of sermon. I hate to call it a
[31:36] sermon because I don't think what we've
[31:37] been given in the last days is just
[31:40] sermons. I think they're announcements.
[31:41] I think they're uh they're proclamations
[31:45] and they're great um instructional
[31:47] things for sons and daughters of God to
[31:49] bring us into the final lap for the last
[31:51] days. So we want to take this next
[31:54] section and and we want as as in this
[31:56] series we've been studying uh and
[31:58] exploring the the depth of finding that
[32:00] channel finding that channel that God
[32:03] steps that God can step in with his
[32:05] heart who cares. He cares. Do you care
[32:08] that God could step in a God who cares
[32:10] and step in uh and move in a
[32:13] supernatural way? Finding the channel
[32:15] that God could step in and move in a
[32:17] supernatural way. We want to find that
[32:19] channel. We want to do that. And one of
[32:21] the ways we've been bringing it is that
[32:22] he cares. Do you care? And brother
[32:24] Brandham says when we show that we care,
[32:27] that we really care, then we find that
[32:30] that God's moved by that and he steps in
[32:32] and he shows he cares. It's not just he
[32:35] says that he cares, but he actually
[32:36] steps in and does something about it.
[32:38] But it he's really teaching us that he
[32:41] he doesn't really move in uh to someone
[32:45] who's who's not really serious, not
[32:47] really sincere. uh they say they want
[32:50] help but they don't they don't show the
[32:51] results of really wanting help and
[32:53] turning towards God. So he cares do you
[32:56] care is an announcement that he show he
[32:58] he will care uh when we show that we
[33:00] care. And we learn that there is a we're
[33:03] going to learn tonight and we've learned
[33:04] through this that there's a provided way
[33:07] for God to supernaturally move into
[33:09] situations to bring there's a way that
[33:11] God wants to bring true deliverance to
[33:14] someone who needs deliverance. There's a
[33:16] way to freedom. And I mean real freedom.
[33:18] There's a way that we get there. There's
[33:21] a way to powerful Christian living. How
[33:23] many believe that there's a way to
[33:24] living a powerful Christian life? There
[33:27] there's a way to true love in a
[33:29] marriage. There's a way to divine true
[33:32] love in a marriage. There's a way to get
[33:33] there. Aren't you glad that there's he
[33:36] says there's victory, but he also
[33:37] provides the way to get to victory.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; And so there's a way to freedom. There's
[33:41] a way for deliverance. There's a way to
[33:43] live a powerful Christian life. There's
[33:45] a way to true love in a marriage, true
[33:48] divine love in a church, in the family.
[33:51] There's a way to get there. And it's a
[33:54] lot less complicated than what we think.
[33:56] Sometimes God's way and path to get
[33:58] there is a lot less complicated than
[34:01] what we think. I never said it was easy
[34:04] because it is difficult, but it's it's
[34:07] less complicated than what we make it.
[34:09] God's way has been made complicated by
[34:12] the devil. But God's way is really not
[34:15] complicated. It's the simplest way.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; It's man that makes it complicated. And
[34:21] so, but I didn't say it was easy because
[34:23] it's hard. And really, it's hard to find
[34:25] God's way sometimes. It's hard because
[34:27] we don't want to fully confess. We're
[34:30] scared. Things have made us scared.
[34:32] Scared of God's way. Scared of
[34:34] confessing. Scared of repenting. If I
[34:36] confess that, what's it going to do to
[34:38] my family? what's going to happen. So,
[34:39] we have all these fears from the devil
[34:41] to keep us from confessing and
[34:43] repenting. And so, we're that's why it's
[34:45] hard to find God's way of deliverance is
[34:48] because we're scared. We We don't want
[34:50] to come the full way of confession and
[34:52] repentance. And so, we back off and
[34:55] we're scared of what it might do. But
[34:57] Jesus said, "Come to me. My yoke is
[35:00] easy. My burden is light."
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, it is a burden and
[35:06] it is a yoke. But I can guarantee you
[35:08] God's way and his burden is he says it's
[35:12] light. My yoke, my burden is light. My
[35:14] yoke is easy. It's a lot easier than
[35:17] going the world's way.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; My yoke is easy. My burden is light. And
[35:23] compared to the world and all of the
[35:25] world's offers for help, to help you, to
[35:27] relieve you, compared to the world,
[35:30] God's way, his yoke is easy and his
[35:32] burden is light. And nothing will ever
[35:34] be as light and as simple and as
[35:37] uncomplicated as taking the Lord's way.
[35:41] And the only reason it becomes scary or
[35:44] complicated is maybe your past history
[35:47] that's made it complicated. And a lot of
[35:49] times religion will do that. A past
[35:52] background of just religion or too much
[35:54] legalism actually will make it difficult
[35:58] to trust God's way because it's been
[36:00] tainted. God's way is still easy. God's
[36:03] way is still light. His burden is still
[36:05] light. It's still the easiest path to
[36:07] deliverance.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; But but sometimes our past can make us
[36:12] afraid of trusting God's path, trusting
[36:15] God's way and that narrow way because
[36:18] how many knows it's a narrow way? Broad
[36:20] is the way that leads to destruction,
[36:22] but narrow is the way that needs leads
[36:23] to life. And so it is a narrow way, but
[36:27] it's also a scary way because of how the
[36:30] devil has scared us away from it. and
[36:32] and made it. But but when we begin to
[36:35] seek uh and apply his way uh and we go
[36:39] down that path, when we find that
[36:41] channel, nothing is impossible with God.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; How many want to find the channel that
[36:47] nothing's impossible?
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Nothing's impossible.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; And there's a way to get into that
[36:52] channel that all of a sudden now we're
[36:55] into the realms of of possibilities with
[36:57] God that are impossible with man,
[36:59] impossible with you. But there's a
[37:01] channel and I believe believers have
[37:03] access to that channel more than anybody
[37:06] else.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; God honors faith. But listen, this thing
[37:09] was purchased at Calvary for believers
[37:11] to latch on to and say, "I have a
[37:13] channel I can get into to the
[37:15] supernatural God, to the uh the God of
[37:17] the impossibilities." And when you catch
[37:20] that channel, it it doesn't take
[37:22] theology. It doesn't take KNOWING ALL
[37:24] THE QUOTES. YOU JUST FIND THAT CHANNEL
[37:26] in that way. And all of a sudden you see
[37:28] my this here he is the supernatural God
[37:31] has showed up
[37:32] &gt;&gt; and he's changed the situation.
[37:36] But the truth is is that we turn to
[37:38] other ways. And this is brother Ram's
[37:41] theme now as he comes into this section
[37:42] of the message. We tend to run around
[37:45] God's way. We tend to find other ways.
[37:47] Mankind does that. And we try other ways
[37:50] uh that are given by Satan to get
[37:52] answers to things. And um we've come to
[37:56] a section of the sermon where brother
[37:58] Bram speaks very plain about two main
[38:01] sources of dependence
[38:04] uh from human beings. And that is he
[38:06] really begins to go into science and
[38:08] education.
[38:10] Why is it important for him to just take
[38:12] and almost dismantle a trust in science
[38:16] and a trust in education? Why is it
[38:18] important for him to do that? Because
[38:20] science and education becomes two of the
[38:23] most powerful sources since the very
[38:26] garden of Eden. Two powerful sources in
[38:29] since the beginning of time presenting
[38:32] themselves science and education
[38:34] presenting themselves through the enemy
[38:36] as an alternative to the supernatural
[38:39] God.
[38:41] There's many things that Satan has, many
[38:42] traps, many temptations. There's many
[38:45] surface uh symptoms and uh things of the
[38:49] world and and addictions and things that
[38:52] he has and that's all surface things.
[38:54] But one of the things he uses that's
[38:56] been used throughout time and in the
[38:57] very beginning is to draw a person into
[39:00] science and education. Why is it
[39:02] important for the prophet talk about
[39:04] this? Because it's it's two of the
[39:05] things that Satan has presented as
[39:08] making themselves ultimately. At first
[39:10] it doesn't look like it. At first,
[39:13] science uh looks like that man has
[39:15] figured something out. At first,
[39:17] education seems good. And you remember,
[39:20] I want to balance this tonight by saying
[39:22] because I'm going to read what he said
[39:23] about education. He pretty much
[39:24] dismantles it. But other places, Brother
[39:26] Bram says in lean not to thine
[39:29] understanding. He says, "Now education
[39:31] is a good thing." He he brother never uh
[39:34] defended or supported ignorance. He our
[39:37] children should be going to school and
[39:39] they should learn things in life. And he
[39:41] said if you get and lean not to thine
[39:43] own understanding. He said it's I'm not
[39:45] against that. He said it would. But
[39:47] here's what he said. He said you go and
[39:48] get a degree. You get a trade. He said
[39:51] it'll make things better for you in
[39:53] life. No doubt. But it has nothing to do
[39:56] with eternal life.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; And so what's he saying? Don't ever use
[40:01] education. Don't ever use that as an
[40:05] alternative, SOME TYPE OF PATH
[40:06] [screaming]
[40:07] PATH TO ETERNAL LIFE or to THE
[40:09] SUPERNATURAL GOD. IT'LL NEVER LEAD you
[40:11] there.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Education can't do that. And look how
[40:14] the churches now throughout history has
[40:17] latched on to education and think they
[40:20] COULD EDUCATE SOMEBODY INTO THE KINGDOM
[40:22] OF GOD. THAT'S THE TRAP. YOU CAN'T
[40:24] EDUCATE A PERSON INTO THE kingdom of
[40:27] God. It has to be a new birth. They have
[40:29] to be born again. They have to receive a
[40:32] revelation.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; And so you see how the enemy can take
[40:35] education, something that can be good,
[40:38] but then he can turn it over as an
[40:40] alternative
[40:42] &gt;&gt; for the supernatural God, as an
[40:44] alternative to the way towards God. And
[40:46] it's not the way towards God. Education
[40:48] is not the way towards God. So these are
[40:51] two powerful sources when they are
[40:53] present themselves. They don't start
[40:55] that way. Education and science are very
[40:57] appealing and that's why we uh not only
[41:01] are drawn by it but also we we use it.
[41:04] We are using some science, some
[41:06] medicines and we are becoming educated.
[41:09] We we should do that. But there's two
[41:11] sides to that. There's two sides to
[41:14] this. There's a real good side and then
[41:16] there's a real real bad side to it to
[41:20] both of them. And that's why the tree of
[41:22] knowledge is called the tree of
[41:23] knowledge of good and evil.
[41:26] That's why it's so deceptive
[41:28] &gt;&gt; because it has a real good side to it. I
[41:31] mean, we are I wouldn't say we're eating
[41:34] off the tree, but we're using things
[41:37] that come off the tree of knowledge of
[41:38] good and evil. You probably cooked on a
[41:40] nice stove tonight. You didn't uh build
[41:44] a fire in back of your house and unless
[41:47] you're, you know, grizzly atoms or
[41:49] something and you wanted to do it the
[41:50] natural way or in camping or whatever,
[41:52] that's fine. You had things. Most of you
[41:54] didn't walk to church tonight like some
[41:56] of our brothers in Nigeria. Uh you drove
[41:58] a nice car and and so I could accuse all
[42:01] of you of basically using a lot of stuff
[42:04] off the tree of knowledge of Geneva. So
[42:05] don't go out here saying I don't eat
[42:07] from that. I don't do that. I don't do
[42:09] any of those things. And let me just see
[42:11] you in the summer when it's real hot and
[42:13] you can go without your air
[42:15] conditioning.
[42:18] Yeah. Exactly.
[42:20] So we you know this we we have these
[42:23] things and medicine and science and and
[42:26] all the the new things that we've got
[42:28] and it continues to increase every day.
[42:31] I think you know you buy something you
[42:33] buy a laptop and it's out within just
[42:35] you know a few days it's out of date. So
[42:38] um so so now we see that it has two
[42:40] sides to it. You understand that? Uh but
[42:43] after 6,000 years, we get to see the
[42:46] fruit. And this is where brother
[42:47] Brennham's going to go because we can't
[42:49] have any trust in education and science
[42:52] as a way to the supernatural God because
[42:54] we've had 6,000 years to see the fruit
[42:57] that comes from it.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm applying this
[43:01] scripture. There is a way that seemth
[43:03] right unto man,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; but the end is death.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Bern's going to say in a
[43:09] minute. I'm going to read it to you. He
[43:11] says, "This science and education we've
[43:13] discovered, the only way it leads to is
[43:16] death."
[43:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; You see, so along the way, there's
[43:19] things that we use from it, but after
[43:20] 6,000 years, we get to see the fruit of
[43:23] the those things and what's following it
[43:26] and the fruit of following a dependence
[43:28] on science and education. There's so
[43:30] much that goes with it. Education,
[43:31] there's so much pride that goes with it
[43:33] till a man rises in his education and he
[43:36] knows it all. And now he knows more than
[43:38] God. But man choosing this way is easy
[43:42] to choose because it has some results to
[43:44] it. It has good things to it. It can
[43:46] move you into higher position. Sometimes
[43:48] it actually the mind and the body and
[43:50] the soul has needs. It has thirst. It
[43:54] needs help. The mind, the body and the
[43:56] soul, especially since the fall in the
[43:58] garden of Eden, it needs help. We need
[44:00] help. Can you say amen? So all of us,
[44:03] our body, our minds, our spirits, our
[44:05] emotions, it becomes in need. in our
[44:08] soul becomes in need and we have thirst
[44:11] so we need help and this the reason that
[44:13] I this is the reason I've read once
[44:15] again there's a way that seemth right
[44:17] unto a man in other words it's a bit
[44:19] more appealing it's science and
[44:22] education are a bit more appealing than
[44:24] saying you know you know what you need
[44:26] you need to you need to smoke more
[44:27] cigarettes we're not really going to
[44:29] hear that but something like education
[44:33] and science and we've proven this this
[44:36] will help you and we've proven if you go
[44:38] this path you can become knowledgeable.
[44:40] It's more appealing than just saying I
[44:42] know what you need. You need to smoke
[44:44] more cigarettes. Parents are saying why
[44:46] is brother Paul saying that in front of
[44:47] my kids.
[44:49] That's the answer for your problems. You
[44:51] need to drink more pop. That's the
[44:52] answer of your you need to eat more
[44:54] chicken like Chick-fil-A says.
[44:57] Maybe if you go out wind surfing it
[44:59] would clear all your troubled mind
[45:02] for the rest of your life. You know,
[45:05] people are probably uh most cases
[45:09] shouldn't be dumb enough to swallow
[45:10] things like that. But when you when you
[45:12] talk about the serpent, they're standing
[45:14] there and saying to Eve, saying, "You'll
[45:17] get a knowledge from this."
[45:20] And that knowledge will make you as
[45:22] gods.
[45:25] That's appealing to the human being. You
[45:28] see, that's appealing because it's been
[45:30] said. He didn't say, "Eve, let's go
[45:32] party and let's go into all the bars and
[45:34] let's just No, no, no. He's there. He's
[45:37] quoting the word. He's misinterpreting
[45:39] the word. And then he says that this is
[45:41] this is this is something that will
[45:44] bring you knowledge that you will become
[45:47] as a god yourself."
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, human beings, this is that's a
[45:52] trap for them
[45:53] &gt;&gt; because they want to be better than the
[45:55] next person. They want to have that kind
[45:57] of knowledge. This I'm going to be in
[45:59] the no here. And if I'm in the know,
[46:01] there's not a lot of things I can do.
[46:03] That's the trap of education because why
[46:05] is it a trap? Because right there, he's
[46:08] selling her on taking the knowledge
[46:11] instead of the revelation of God and
[46:13] staying in the channel of fellowship
[46:15] with God.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And it's Satan doing it. It's the
[46:17] serpent anointed by Satan to do it. And
[46:19] there, this whole thing's happening
[46:21] right in the Garden of Eden. And and so
[46:23] it becomes appealing because it it's a
[46:25] way that seemth right. It seems so
[46:27] convincing. It is more drawing to a
[46:30] person that said this this they're going
[46:32] to say this really seems right. I've
[46:34] pondered this. I've thought about this.
[46:36] This seems like the way that I would get
[46:39] the answers to my problems. And so but
[46:41] you see the end of thereof is the ways
[46:45] of death.
[46:48] It's worded that there is a way singular
[46:52] that seemth right unto man. But the end
[46:55] is the ways plural of death. So
[46:59] something singular from Satan that
[47:02] seemth right now all of a sudden splits
[47:04] into a a plural thing of it goes to many
[47:08] ways of death.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Many ways of death. There's it's not a
[47:12] physical death. Many times it's a dying
[47:14] in the soul in the spirit. It's dying to
[47:17] believing that there's hope for me. Uh
[47:19] the Bible says a woman who lives in
[47:21] pleasure is dead while she liveth. Not
[47:23] physically, but she's actually walking
[47:25] around, but because she's bought into
[47:27] the pleasure idea and the world's view
[47:29] of pleasure, she's actually dead
[47:31] spiritually, but she's still walking
[47:33] around.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; There's a series that's been out years,
[47:38] and I see the name of it called The
[47:39] Walking Dead. How perfectly is that
[47:43] naming people who are walking on the
[47:45] face of the earth right now?
[47:48] The walking dead. She that live in
[47:51] pleasure is dead while she's living.
[47:52] They're physically walking around, but
[47:54] they're the walking dead because they're
[47:55] spiritually dead. And not only they're
[47:58] spiritually dead in their soul, but also
[48:01] in their spirit, they have given up.
[48:03] There there's no hope. They've given
[48:05] into the addiction that there there's
[48:06] there's no hope in their heart that
[48:08] there's any channel THAT THEY CAN COME
[48:10] OUT of this. And so they've given up.
[48:11] And so they've chosen a way that has le
[48:14] led to death in their life. They're
[48:17] still physically alive, BUT THERE'S NO
[48:19] LIFE IN THEM.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THERE'S
[48:22] NOTHING TO RISE ABOVE IT. THEY HAVE
[48:24] GIVEN UP BECAUSE THEY CHOSE THAT WAY.
[48:27] And that way leads to death.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Couldn't find the way. couldn't find
[48:32] God's channel to change whatever they
[48:35] wanted to be changed. So I put as the
[48:38] base of our scripture uh to these things
[48:41] that the prophet warns us about in
[48:43] science and education. There's a way
[48:45] that seemth right. It's so close. It
[48:47] sounds right. And uh if you just look at
[48:50] verse 15 of the text, it says the simple
[48:53] believeth and I'm in Proverbs uh 14 just
[48:56] two script three scriptures down. And it
[48:58] says in 15, the simple believeth every
[49:00] word, but the prudent man lookth well to
[49:03] his going. And that word simple means
[49:06] the foolish one, the one who doesn't
[49:08] think it through. And what does he do?
[49:10] He believes everything that comes along.
[49:13] He buys into it. Doctor says this
[49:16] science, he's more educated than I am.
[49:19] And so now the foolish believes every
[49:21] word. We as Christians can't believe
[49:24] everything everybody says on the
[49:26] internet.
[49:27] in the medical field,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; but we we fall to it because you say
[49:34] we're we're in a position they're more
[49:36] educated than me. But you see, friends,
[49:39] and and and you see what I'm saying
[49:40] tonight. I'm not be I would respect a
[49:42] man that knows what I'd rather him I'd
[49:45] rather an experienced man do an
[49:46] operation on me than one who wasn't
[49:48] experienced, one who's just done one of
[49:50] them, you know? So, I understand
[49:51] respecting what they know. But our
[49:54] problem is is that we can't back off and
[49:57] all of a sudden we accept everything
[49:59] that they say because we feel
[50:01] intimidated. They have more knowledge
[50:03] than us. Don't forget you're a believer.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET YOU KNOW THE GREAT
[50:08] PHYSICIAN.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET THAT GOD'S KNOWLEDGE IS
[50:11] GREATER THAN THEIR KNOWLEDGE. DON'T
[50:13] FORGET THAT THERE'S A CHANNEL THAT YOU
[50:15] COULD FIND THE SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT
[50:18] WOULD TRUMP EVERYTHING THAT DOCTOR WOULD
[50:20] SAY.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. Don't be intimidated
[50:25] by that educational system and that
[50:27] science when it comes and says
[50:29] everything in science says you're a dead
[50:32] man, you're a dead woman.
[50:34] Say, man, I Okay, I mean, you're the
[50:37] guys, you know better, but there's a God
[50:39] who knows more than them.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." WE KNOW
[50:43] A GOD THAT'S A SUPERNATURAL GOD, and he
[50:45] knows all things. His ways,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Sister Isabelle, his ways are higher
[50:52] &gt;&gt; than our ways.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; His thoughts are higher than mine.
[50:55] They're higher than the doctors. Can I
[50:56] get AN AMEN TONIGHT? HIS WAYS, HIS
[50:59] THOUGHTS ARE HIGHER THAN THE DOCTORS.
[51:01] HIGHER THAN THE MOST EDUCATED MAN WITH
[51:03] THE HIGHEST IQ. IF THIS THING WOULD HAVE
[51:06] BEEN BASED UPON OUR IQ LEVEL, WE'D HAVE
[51:08] ALL BEEN FINISHED.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; brother. You're saying, "Brother Paul,
[51:12] speak for yourself." Listen, we were to
[51:14] all if it was BASED UPON IQ, WE'D ALL WE
[51:17] WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A CHANCE IN the
[51:18] kingdom of God. IT WAS BASED UPON MONEY,
[51:21] all of us would have been out.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Based upon good looks, you all would
[51:25] have been out. And me included.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Good thing it wasn't based upon good
[51:30] looks. Good thing it wasn't based upon
[51:32] how much knowledge or IQ we had. But a
[51:35] simple heart, predestinated seed, a
[51:38] response to the word of God, and a
[51:40] humble little Hatty, right, who had no
[51:43] money whatsoever, somehow tapped into
[51:47] pleasing God. She come into a channel.
[51:50] She had no education. She had no money.
[51:52] Her IQ wasn't that high, but she was
[51:55] ABLE TO PACK PACK JUST CHECK INTO THE
[51:58] VERY TH RIGHT TO THE VERY THRONE WHERE
[52:01] GOD COMES DOWN IN THAT ROOM.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; God asked no questions about her money
[52:07] or her education. NOTHING. THAT'S MY
[52:10] DAUGHTER AND SHE SAID THE RIGHT WORD AND
[52:12] I'M COMING DOWN TO GIVE HER ANYTHING she
[52:14] asked for.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; This thing ain't based upon education or
[52:19] science.
[52:21] It's based upon a heart that's really
[52:24] ready to be humble.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I lay everything before you, my Lord,
[52:29] and I'm ready to receive what you have
[52:32] for me. Hallelujah.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; The prud the prudent man lookth well to
[52:36] his going. It says, "The simple
[52:38] believeth every word, but the prudent
[52:40] man lookth well to his going." And so,
[52:42] he's using discernment. Eve didn't do
[52:44] that. Eve believed what she heard. She
[52:48] didn't She didn't even check it with the
[52:49] word. She didn't check it with her
[52:50] husband and so she was being foolish
[52:54] there. She didn't do it. And these two
[52:56] things of science and education are
[52:58] traced back to the Garden of Eden. We
[53:00] call it knowledge back there. The first
[53:02] one, knowledge. You'll become as gods.
[53:04] That's appealing to the human being to
[53:06] be lifted up in knowledge to know more
[53:08] to be as a god to to
[53:11] be as a god with our knowledge to be
[53:13] better than the next person. Then that
[53:15] comes in religion. that comes in the
[53:17] pride of of Christianity. It's crept
[53:20] into the message that because of all of
[53:22] our knowledge of all the message now it
[53:25] grows in pride. I'm one that believes
[53:27] the scripture says that knowledge puffth
[53:29] up but a revelation brings more
[53:31] humility.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; I said knowledge has one end. It puffs
[53:35] up. You get more knowledge of the
[53:37] message and all the mysteries.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; It ends in pride. You get a revelation.
[53:43] It makes you more humble. I don't know
[53:45] anything except God gives it to me.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Pride exalts itself above the knowledge
[53:53] of God. That's what happens. And so when
[53:56] he told Eve, you'll be not you'll have
[53:59] the knowledge. You'll be as God's
[54:00] knowing knowing good and evil. You'll be
[54:03] in that position. Then it exalts itself
[54:07] eventually above the knowledge of God.
[54:10] And then later, Cain develops things to
[54:13] answer man's suffering, conveniences,
[54:16] new inventions. He began to build
[54:19] cities. He began to build things. He
[54:21] began to come up with new inventions.
[54:23] We're using a lot of not those things,
[54:25] but it's advanced now for 6,000 years.
[54:28] Cain was the one who developed all that.
[54:31] And all of it was and and even when they
[54:33] come to the Tower of Babel some 2,000
[54:35] years later, the knowledge that they had
[54:38] grown into and the science that they had
[54:41] grown into that they come to a thought
[54:43] that said, "I'm never going to see this
[54:45] earth destroyed again by a flood so we
[54:48] can build something so high into the
[54:50] heavens
[54:52] &gt;&gt; that we would be able to escape
[54:55] the judgment again
[54:58] and provide our own escape from it.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; That's how arrogant men can get.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; I don't need to take God's escape from
[55:07] judgment.
[55:09] I'll build my own.
[55:12] And even God said, you know what? This
[55:14] type of knowledge, I really don't have
[55:17] anything to stop it except to confound
[55:20] their language that they can't
[55:21] understand one another. There was
[55:23] nothing that could be done. Talk about
[55:26] knowledge reaching a level of arrogance,
[55:29] but also power.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; We're going to build this tower so we
[55:35] can when the judgments come, we can run
[55:36] up there. When it looks like the
[55:38] judgment has come, we can run up there.
[55:40] And if God doesn't, we can run back
[55:42] down. And we're creating this ourselves.
[55:44] We're doing this ourselves. Now, I can
[55:47] I'm talking about 4,000 years ago, but
[55:50] don't underestimate our minds of how we
[55:53] create our own ways. to get out of
[55:56] things.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; You listening? Don't underestimate your
[56:02] own knowledge that you find your own way
[56:04] to get out of something instead of
[56:06] seeking God's way.
[56:10] Praise the Lord.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; So, science and education are always
[56:13] learning more. And brother Bram's going
[56:16] to say here in a few minutes and I'll
[56:17] end with all the quotes because I've
[56:18] been preaching here. But science and
[56:20] education are always [cough] they're
[56:23] [clears throat] always learning more,
[56:24] but they're also always correcting
[56:26] themselves.
[56:28] God doesn't do that. First time he
[56:30] answers, it's the right answer.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; But that's a How can you trust science
[56:35] when they were were telling us years
[56:37] ago, don't dare eat that because you're
[56:39] going to get cancer from that. And now
[56:41] just 20 years later said, "You better
[56:43] eat that. That's good for you."
[56:45] &gt;&gt; That's the problem with science.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Can't trust it
[56:50] &gt;&gt; because it's always changing and it's
[56:52] it's always correcting itself.
[56:55] But not God. He knew and has always
[56:57] known. God has always known what the
[57:01] needs of man are. God always knows the
[57:05] way that he can deliver man. and he
[57:08] never changes his way to get to that.
[57:11] His ways are timeless because they're
[57:14] for the human being to find freedom.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Now, here's some quotes from over 30
[57:19] paragraphs in there. I don't have time
[57:21] to read all those tonight. That's how
[57:23] many that's how much section is
[57:24] dedicated to um really taking a stab at
[57:28] science and education.
[57:31] And I just pulled out a few of them and
[57:33] you'll just catch the main thing. So now
[57:36] if a man follows this for his answer, it
[57:38] ends in death. Remember that scripture I
[57:40] gave as a base tonight. It takes a while
[57:43] with science and education. But it will
[57:46] always want to eventually want to be the
[57:50] full replacement for God's provided way.
[57:54] Don't forget, hold on with those. Always
[57:57] remember that science and education, as
[58:00] good as it is, as as the good things it
[58:03] brings, and if you get an education,
[58:05] that's great. But always remember that
[58:08] will it will eventually want to replace
[58:12] God's provided way in your life.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; It's going to come to that.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; It's going to come to that. Our
[58:19] educational system, that's why we have a
[58:22] a nation full of communism.
[58:25] Brother Bram said in 1954 we're we're
[58:27] ate up with communism but it's increased
[58:29] more and how to increase the educational
[58:32] system. It's been taught and communism
[58:35] is a godless culture.
[58:38] So it's taught godlessness to the place
[58:40] that say I defy God. I defy how God's
[58:43] made me. God said I was a man. I'm going
[58:46] to say I'm a woman. It's a defiance of
[58:48] God. It's a defiance of God's creation.
[58:52] and it's been taught in the schools. And
[58:54] so I hate to I hate to send kids to
[58:58] colleges and things like that. I just
[59:01] say parents just be very choosy with
[59:03] your young person where they choose to
[59:07] go because this stuff is just perverted
[59:09] with little seeds of thought that plant
[59:13] against a supernatural God,
[59:17] against the ways of God, against the
[59:18] principles of God. It's so subtle and I
[59:22] just that's all I'll say about it. But
[59:24] in some ways I I wish I would have even
[59:26] did something different. Um but it just
[59:31] it [clears throat] just it's not to be
[59:32] trusted.
[59:34] It's not to be trusted. It is godless
[59:37] and it eventually plant so many things
[59:40] in the mind. So brother Bram says here
[59:41] look now let us look what science and
[59:43] education has brought us to. And that's
[59:45] the very thing that man accepted instead
[59:47] of the word of God as scientific
[59:49] approval. And science has always have to
[59:51] take back what they said. That's the
[59:53] problem. You can't trust it. Science
[59:55] always has to take back what they said.
[59:57] Some of them are backtracking in the
[59:59] last few days about the big push for
[1:00:02] global warming that they push so much
[1:00:04] and it's, you know, it's going to be
[1:00:06] over. I think they said 2005 Al Gore
[1:00:10] said if we continue at this pace in 10
[1:00:12] years it everything will be completely
[1:00:15] gone. Well, we're you know 20 years past
[1:00:18] that and we're still here. So that's not
[1:00:21] the only reason although there's some
[1:00:22] truth to man destroying the earth
[1:00:24] himself. It's that man tries to to
[1:00:27] interpret that himself when it's going
[1:00:29] to be. So man does destroy himself.
[1:00:31] There's a truth to that. But you see now
[1:00:34] people are having to take back what they
[1:00:36] said because science is not perfect.
[1:00:39] I like the science that keeps coming
[1:00:42] back and showing that our God lives. Can
[1:00:46] you say amen?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; But in most cases it's not going to do
[1:00:49] that. Now what is brother Brandon says
[1:00:51] now what has science brought to us? You
[1:00:54] may be shocked just for a moment.
[1:00:55] Science has brought to us sickness,
[1:00:58] death, and diseases. Now you're only
[1:01:00] been taught one. You've only been taught
[1:01:02] one side of the picture, but there's two
[1:01:04] sides to it. And that's what basically
[1:01:06] what why he's saying this to education
[1:01:09] and science. There's two sides to it.
[1:01:13] And we've only been presented the one
[1:01:15] side, the good side. There's two sides.
[1:01:17] You say, "Science has invented this,
[1:01:19] that, and the other." Well, we're going
[1:01:20] to grant you that privilege. But let's
[1:01:22] look at the other side. Science has
[1:01:24] brought us sickness. Science has brought
[1:01:26] us diseases, death. Look, scientific
[1:01:28] hybriding has brought death to the
[1:01:30] generation of foods and things. It's got
[1:01:32] the people so soft and so until the man
[1:01:35] and woman are made up of a bunch of muck
[1:01:38] and there's no structure in it. It's
[1:01:40] become a bunch of soft jellyfish. They
[1:01:43] can't live without an air conditioner.
[1:01:45] They they perish. They can't play a
[1:01:47] baseball game. If one of them gets
[1:01:48] tapped somewhere, it kills them in the
[1:01:50] boxing rings and what more? And it's so
[1:01:53] soft till men and women, well, it's
[1:01:55] perverting them. who's using food. He
[1:01:57] goes on later in the quotes, they're
[1:01:59] injecting what they're injecting into
[1:02:01] our cattle. Um they're they're spraying
[1:02:04] on the farm fields. They're spraying
[1:02:06] what he called DDT. And uh I the reason
[1:02:10] they have DDT is because you can't
[1:02:12] pronounce the full word. Uh but I looked
[1:02:16] it up and that was developed at the
[1:02:17] first of the modern synthetic
[1:02:19] insecticides in the 1940s. It was
[1:02:22] initially used with great effect to
[1:02:24] combat malaria and typhus and other
[1:02:27] insectborn human diseases among both
[1:02:30] military and civilian populations. But
[1:02:33] DDT commonly known as is commonly known
[1:02:37] is a colorless, tasteless and almost
[1:02:41] odorless crystalline chemical compound
[1:02:45] only originally developed as an
[1:02:47] insecticide. It became inf
[1:02:50] uh it became famous or infamous for its
[1:02:53] environmental impacts. DDT affects the
[1:02:56] nervous system. So now they're saying
[1:02:58] what brother Bram said here is that
[1:03:00] basically when this come out it's going
[1:03:02] to be a good thing. It's supposed to
[1:03:04] spray this on the plants and this is
[1:03:06] going to help get rid of certain
[1:03:08] diseases. But I I thought it was
[1:03:10] interesting that this particular uh
[1:03:12] thing they talked about is it just
[1:03:14] reminded me of the devil's ways. It's
[1:03:16] colorless. It's tasteless,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; odorless. Isn't that the enemy?
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That you can't detect the damage that
[1:03:25] it's going to do. You can't smell it.
[1:03:27] Young person, I hope you're listening.
[1:03:29] Can't smell it. It's colorless. You
[1:03:31] can't detect it. And yet, it's a
[1:03:34] destructive thing to the human body. And
[1:03:37] they begin to put that in the fields.
[1:03:39] Listen, I remember when did we here in
[1:03:41] Toledo couldn't use our water for about
[1:03:43] a week
[1:03:45] and couldn't even shower with it and you
[1:03:47] know so and then all the water went out
[1:03:49] couldn't get water in the city and you
[1:03:51] know what they said that the farm fields
[1:03:53] draining off into Lake Erie and
[1:03:55] different places and because all the
[1:03:57] pesticides and so that affected the
[1:03:59] water so I'm going wow you know you
[1:04:02] think you got pure water and even the
[1:04:04] farm fields well I'm already getting
[1:04:06] that from the vegetables and everything
[1:04:07] else so they put all this stuff in and
[1:04:10] brother Brandham comments on the cattle,
[1:04:12] comments in the spring. He's way ahead
[1:04:14] of his time because all this stuff
[1:04:16] starts to happen and it actually is
[1:04:19] killing the people. Uh people have he
[1:04:22] says DDT affects the nervous system.
[1:04:25] Here we are this age. People who have
[1:04:27] accidentally swallow large amounts of
[1:04:29] DDT become excitable and have tremors
[1:04:31] and seizures. These these effects went
[1:04:34] away after the exposure stopped. No
[1:04:36] effects were seen in people who took
[1:04:37] small daily doses of DDT by capsule for
[1:04:40] 18 months. I'm going to say that's a lie
[1:04:43] because that's probably worse over time
[1:04:45] to take small capsules daily uh of uh
[1:04:49] you know strick nine or whatever. It's
[1:04:51] it's it's bad for you. It's it kills. He
[1:04:55] speaks brother Brandon speaks and and
[1:04:56] I'm just not reading all the quotes but
[1:04:59] you read it. He speaks about our eggs.
[1:05:01] He speaks about the effect on our milk.
[1:05:04] uh he he the run the the the the farmers
[1:05:06] what they're spraying on.
[1:05:09] [clears throat] So
[1:05:10] and then he goes on to say look it's
[1:05:12] caused the genes the next one it's
[1:05:15] caused the genes between the man and the
[1:05:16] woman to weaken the physical weakness of
[1:05:18] the human being through the genes and
[1:05:20] the increase of children is
[1:05:22] around 30%. Mongolian is on the great
[1:05:24] climb and these weak weakness and what
[1:05:26] he's mentioning here. We have a bunch of
[1:05:28] other things that's come from all this
[1:05:30] stuff,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; you know, just a lot of other problems
[1:05:33] and diseases and these weakness of
[1:05:35] interbreeding of the foods that we are
[1:05:37] eating for life is weakening the body
[1:05:39] which causes cancer, mental troubles and
[1:05:43] all kinds of diseases is setting in upon
[1:05:46] the human body because it's weakness.
[1:05:48] scientific destroying themselves,
[1:05:52] getting away from God's plan.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That's why he's warning us on it because
[1:05:58] on a spiritual level, science and
[1:06:00] education can destroy the soul, but on a
[1:06:03] natural level, this is destroying our
[1:06:05] bodies. How many years we've been
[1:06:06] feeding on this stuff?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You see, so science, we think, oh, this
[1:06:11] is great. We got everything new and this
[1:06:12] is going to help and everything, but in
[1:06:14] the long run, sometimes it doesn't help.
[1:06:16] And then he ends it by saying, 'But
[1:06:17] notice what's that doing? We're getting
[1:06:19] away from God's plan. Notice what's
[1:06:21] that's doing. Science has brought death,
[1:06:23] sickness, and destruction. Goes on to
[1:06:26] say later in the message, so you see
[1:06:29] when God constructed a man in the first
[1:06:31] place, he was immune from any disease.
[1:06:33] That's right.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; You see, but unbelief and science,
[1:06:39] science and education was the first
[1:06:42] thing that took man away from God. And
[1:06:44] it's still taking him.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Not just your body, but your
[1:06:51] but your soul to believe.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Believe in science and go. It's going to
[1:06:56] take you away from the channel of
[1:06:58] believing God properly. Isn't this
[1:07:00] wonderful? Then he goes on about
[1:07:02] education a little bit. I won't read all
[1:07:03] these but he says when he talks about
[1:07:05] education lean not to your own
[1:07:07] understanding
[1:07:09] he's not against education we he said
[1:07:11] those things but it leads to a godless
[1:07:13] culture and he goes on to say here in uh
[1:07:15] paragraph 111 now we realize that it was
[1:07:18] that that it was it was uh that it was
[1:07:20] reason common reasonings that started
[1:07:23] the ball rolling of sin at the first
[1:07:24] place it was reasoning what reasoning is
[1:07:27] against the word of God he's talking
[1:07:28] about Eve when God told Adam and Eve the
[1:07:30] day you eat there of that day you die
[1:07:32] That's settled. That's all of it. And he
[1:07:34] fortified them against the enemy behind
[1:07:36] his word. But when Eve, listening to
[1:07:39] Satan's reasonings, you see, culture,
[1:07:42] understanding, education, advancement.
[1:07:46] Thank God for a prophet who warns us
[1:07:49] about these things. Why? Because we
[1:07:52] think, well, I'm a believer, you know,
[1:07:53] I'm not against advancement. Bettering
[1:07:56] things, making it better, making it more
[1:07:58] professional. But you see now we have to
[1:08:01] always be aware that in that can be a
[1:08:04] trap.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; It's okay. You don't have to say amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; In that building something and using the
[1:08:11] world's means to do it and or building
[1:08:14] into a greater business and and using
[1:08:16] the world's knowledge to do that. Be
[1:08:19] careful because it always leads you away
[1:08:21] from the kernels of real things.
[1:08:24] Relationship with God, the channel with
[1:08:26] God. every time it will want to lead
[1:08:29] away from it'll lead you to symbolism
[1:08:32] over substance
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; then now your your belief in God becomes
[1:08:37] a symbol
[1:08:39] but there's no substance to it there's
[1:08:40] no relationship with God
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; amen so culture understanding education
[1:08:47] advancement she stepped out behind there
[1:08:48] listened to Satan's reasoning and did
[1:08:50] the thing that God said don't do it goes
[1:08:52] on to say we got two churches at this at
[1:08:55] hand this morning one of them is the
[1:08:57] church of Pentecost,
[1:08:59] excuse me, that was organized at
[1:09:01] Pentecost by the Holy Spirit. The second
[1:09:03] is the church of the Roman Catholic
[1:09:05] which was organized in Naia Rome. I
[1:09:07] think brother Rap was on this a couple
[1:09:08] weeks ago. One of them is spiritual
[1:09:10] birth. The other one is an intellectual
[1:09:13] membership. So I want you to catch that
[1:09:14] now. Now he's bringing the educational
[1:09:17] thing. When Satan brings it into
[1:09:20] Christianity or brings it into the
[1:09:22] church, he create he he he makes another
[1:09:25] church based upon intellectual
[1:09:28] conception of God
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; instead of instead of and he's going to
[1:09:34] say it this way next. One is based on
[1:09:37] spiritual discernment.
[1:09:40] The other one is based on educational
[1:09:43] and intellectual conception.
[1:09:47] So there's only two churches. Now we're
[1:09:50] talking not the world. Now we're talking
[1:09:52] about within Christianity,
[1:09:54] there's two churches. One's based upon
[1:09:57] intellect and education of God. And the
[1:10:00] other one is based upon discernment,
[1:10:02] spiritual discernment of God. Praise the
[1:10:05] Lord. That's why education can so lead
[1:10:08] us astray when we're trying to get to
[1:10:10] God through the way of education. Now, I
[1:10:12] believe in training. I believe in
[1:10:14] teaching. I believe the Holy Ghost is a
[1:10:16] teacher. I believe God puts teachers in
[1:10:19] the church to teach us. I believe the
[1:10:21] mind is the womb to the soul.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; So I believe God can start bringing
[1:10:26] things and planting seeds in your mind.
[1:10:28] Then he drops it in your heart by
[1:10:29] revelation. So I don't believe we should
[1:10:31] just say, "Well, I'm just waiting on a
[1:10:33] revelation. I don't have to read my
[1:10:34] Bible or be in the message." And I don't
[1:10:36] think you should do that. I think you
[1:10:37] should gain the knowledge of God. But we
[1:10:40] should never depend on the knowledge
[1:10:42] that we have of God
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; to get us into the rapture, to get us
[1:10:48] into a supernatural God to bring help in
[1:10:50] our lives. It's got to be something
[1:10:52] deeper.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; So I want to be that true church that
[1:10:55] lives by the discernment by the spirit
[1:10:57] of God
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; and not an intellectual conception. You
[1:11:01] need to ask yourself this question. Is
[1:11:03] this message, is this Christ just an
[1:11:06] intellectual conception? Because that's
[1:11:07] just knowledge and education. You need
[1:11:11] something deeper. Young people, you need
[1:11:12] something deeper. You might have a a
[1:11:14] message conscience.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; You grew up in the message and so you
[1:11:18] have a message conscience. It's been
[1:11:20] formed by the message. Praise God. But
[1:11:23] go up against the devil one time in
[1:11:24] temptation. See if that's enough.
[1:11:28] It's got to be deeper than that.
[1:11:31] Education about Christ is not enough to
[1:11:35] go against demons.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Shouting and praising the Lord at camp
[1:11:40] is not enough to go up against demons.
[1:11:43] An emotional speaking in tongues is not
[1:11:46] enough to go up against the devil.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It takes a temple that's filled with the
[1:11:51] Holy Ghost.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It takes your soul filled with the Holy
[1:11:55] Ghost. It takes more than psychology.
[1:11:59] You can't bring a person through
[1:12:01] psychology into the realities of a
[1:12:04] supernatural God. You can't bring them
[1:12:07] through psychology. You can have it
[1:12:09] where it diagnoses the problem and helps
[1:12:11] you diagnose the problem. But God, the
[1:12:14] great psychologist. Oh boy, I'm going to
[1:12:16] get in trouble now. God the greatest.
[1:12:19] How many believe he's a great physician?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Well, he's the great psychologist, too.
[1:12:23] He knows human behavior better than
[1:12:25] anybody. And when you tap into the great
[1:12:27] psychologist, he can diagnose your life,
[1:12:30] your past, and your case better than
[1:12:32] anyone will do it.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You get into that channel, God just
[1:12:35] reveals it. And now you see what the
[1:12:37] problem is. You see what the answer is
[1:12:39] in is you see that God cares. You care
[1:12:42] to get deliverance. And as I said at the
[1:12:44] beginning of this series, you bring
[1:12:46] those two things together and someone's
[1:12:48] in between trying to put out his hand
[1:12:49] helping you and pray with you. But you
[1:12:51] bring a person who cares about
[1:12:53] deliverance and the God who cares,
[1:12:55] something connects. Something is going
[1:12:58] to happen
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; that's going to be a real change.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; It's not up here. Say, "I think I got
[1:13:03] it. I think I'm okay." No, you're going
[1:13:05] to know that God has stepped in.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; One is based upon spiritual discernment.
[1:13:13] The other one is based upon educational
[1:13:14] and intellectual conceptions. That's
[1:13:16] where he deals with the education. Most
[1:13:18] of what he talks about in education is
[1:13:20] that coming into the church where we're
[1:13:22] going to educate somebody into it. No,
[1:13:24] you don't do that. We train, we teach
[1:13:26] our children, we train, we plant the
[1:13:28] seeds. I'm I'm for all that. But
[1:13:30] ultimately, they have to get into the
[1:13:32] channel of a new birth, finding the new
[1:13:34] birth. And also, they have to yield
[1:13:36] their vessel. They have to really find
[1:13:38] the true God by spiritual discernment.
[1:13:41] So, science and education, I'm I'm
[1:13:44] wrapping it up here now. Science and
[1:13:46] education
[1:13:47] are both ways that seem right.
[1:13:52] They seem right, but the end is death.
[1:13:55] And brother Random takes over 30
[1:13:57] paragraphs to show us, don't you dare
[1:14:00] use as your dependence for answers on
[1:14:04] science and education, whether it's for
[1:14:06] the body. And I want to say again, I I
[1:14:10] believe as brother Brandon balanced it
[1:14:12] out said, you know, thank God for these
[1:14:13] medicines. Thanks God for the the
[1:14:15] doctors who help people. Thank God for
[1:14:17] Christian doctors who point to the
[1:14:19] dependence being on God. If you can find
[1:14:21] one, that's even greater. I thank God
[1:14:23] for it. But I will never You see the
[1:14:25] problem with depending on it holy is
[1:14:28] it's like the Leoian generation
[1:14:31] where it says I'm rich and increase with
[1:14:35] goods. This is the church now. I have
[1:14:37] need of nothing.
[1:14:39] And he said you're miserable, poor,
[1:14:41] blind, and naked. So you're in a state
[1:14:43] but you think in your richness and you
[1:14:45] know everything and I have here this is
[1:14:47] the trap I have need of nothing. What
[1:14:49] that means is is that Leodysa takes the
[1:14:53] people of God and removes
[1:14:56] all of their need to pray.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I'm good. I'm laidback. I'm a Christian.
[1:15:06] I I I got my doctors. I got my medicine.
[1:15:09] I've got this long-term disease that the
[1:15:12] doctors told me I'm going to have it for
[1:15:14] life and I've got the medicine to help
[1:15:15] me for the rest of my life. I'm good. I
[1:15:19] don't have to pray. I need a new
[1:15:20] vehicle. I don't have to pray. Uh Ford
[1:15:23] will give it to me on time. The layaway
[1:15:26] plan, you know, you pay for it till they
[1:15:28] lay you away.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And so Leo, see, it just it's got all
[1:15:34] these convenient. It removes all of your
[1:15:35] need to go to God for anything. Right?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; You don't need to pray because you just
[1:15:39] run and you get this, you get the
[1:15:41] medicine. I'm saying there's nothing
[1:15:43] wrong with things helping us. But when
[1:15:45] we're falling into the trap of we don't
[1:15:46] go to God first, we're falling into the
[1:15:49] trap that Brother Brandham is warning us
[1:15:50] of.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; We're not depending on a supernatural
[1:15:53] God
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; to call him on the scene.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now I want to read this.
[1:16:01] Now that we've talked about the the
[1:16:03] science and education, look what he says
[1:16:04] here. this and I've probably quoted this
[1:16:06] over and over again. God's provided way
[1:16:11] is [clears throat] repentance,
[1:16:13] confession,
[1:16:14] and showing a results, bringing forth
[1:16:17] fruit, meet for repentance, showing
[1:16:19] sincerity. That pretty well sums it up.
[1:16:22] And I wanted to say that with science,
[1:16:24] education, or any other thing in this
[1:16:26] world, if any of that
[1:16:29] takes away from this way
[1:16:32] to get to God, that's your enemy.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz this is the channel. And I'm telling
[1:16:40] you, this is the channel. You can go to
[1:16:41] all the counselors in the world and if
[1:16:43] you don't have these elements, then
[1:16:46] you're not showing you care that you
[1:16:47] really want help because it's in these
[1:16:50] true sincere elements. If those are
[1:16:53] there and they're working sincerely, God
[1:16:56] works with these elements and he opens
[1:16:58] up a way for freedom and deliverance.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Science and education will begin to
[1:17:04] belittle that and say, "No, you don't
[1:17:07] need to do that. You don't need to
[1:17:08] confess. You don't need to repent.
[1:17:10] Where'd you hear that from? We've got
[1:17:12] the way here. We've got the medicine.
[1:17:14] We've got we've got a program you can go
[1:17:16] through. You see, and I'm not against
[1:17:19] something helps somebody. Once again, I
[1:17:21] love the quote that brother Jack Duff
[1:17:22] found. He said, "God is for anything
[1:17:24] that helps human beings." In other
[1:17:26] words, anything that helps the human
[1:17:28] race, we thank God for it.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Why would you want to condemn that?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's not the That's not the trap of
[1:17:35] it. is that that we condemn everything
[1:17:37] that's no no it's it's that if we choose
[1:17:40] that as the al that Satan makes it the
[1:17:43] alternative to this path here
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; and when your education gets you so
[1:17:49] prideful that you can't repent anymore.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; You can't find the way
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; when your science gets you to the place
[1:17:56] that you don't want to confess and you
[1:17:58] don't want and you're hiding and this
[1:18:00] next Wednesday we'll never get into it
[1:18:02] again. I thought I was done with the
[1:18:03] series. I'm not done yet because we've
[1:18:05] got to explore what all those things
[1:18:06] mean.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And the reason is Satan fights against
[1:18:10] these so much is Satan likes to hide.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; When Adam and Eve fell,
[1:18:17] they sewed fig leaves together to hide
[1:18:19] their nakedness. And brother Bram says
[1:18:22] that our our our covering is our
[1:18:25] religion. So it's covering in a certain
[1:18:27] thing, but it's not God's way of
[1:18:29] covering. And the reason they cover
[1:18:31] themselves is to hide because they
[1:18:33] didn't want to come out. And and our
[1:18:36] tendency is to hide. So when of our
[1:18:37] tendency is to hide, we don't like
[1:18:40] anything like this. Satan's going to get
[1:18:42] us to hide it. We're too scared to
[1:18:44] confess it. Is that understandable?
[1:18:47] Everything that Satan develops is going
[1:18:49] to be eventually working against these
[1:18:50] things. And if somebody who needs God
[1:18:53] more and wants to come out of religion
[1:18:55] and wants to come out of their
[1:18:57] upbringing, the message that was wrong,
[1:18:58] they want to come out of anything that
[1:19:00] from a a smoking habit to a porn habit
[1:19:03] to whatever it is to just outright uh uh
[1:19:08] maybe a person's a maniac in a prison.
[1:19:11] Okay, there's a way out.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; There's a way. God says there's a way
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; and it's not through psychology.
[1:19:21] When you start to get sincerely into
[1:19:23] these channels and God knows you care,
[1:19:26] God starts to work in these things.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Because he cares. Do you care?
[1:19:36] Anytime anything takes these elements
[1:19:38] away, it will never work. Science and
[1:19:40] education try to eliminate these things.
[1:19:43] You don't need to do that.
[1:19:46] [clears throat] When you do,
[1:19:48] you deceive man away from the channel of
[1:19:50] true help
[1:19:53] of the true channel of the true way. You
[1:19:55] say, "Well, Jesus said, "I'm the way,
[1:19:56] the truth, and the life." Yeah, he is.
[1:19:58] He is the answer. How many believe Jesus
[1:20:00] is the answer? I've always said it this
[1:20:02] way is that Jesus not only has the
[1:20:06] answer, he is the answer.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; That's a big difference because we're
[1:20:10] always looking, Lord, help. Lord, give
[1:20:12] me an answer. Lord, give me an answer.
[1:20:13] But you see, he is the answer. When you
[1:20:16] embrace him and you turn your life over
[1:20:18] to him to repentance and confession,
[1:20:20] everything's on the table. God, I'm all
[1:20:22] yours. I don't know how this is going to
[1:20:23] go. Remember the woman that had to
[1:20:24] confess to her husband what she had done
[1:20:26] and her husband had to confess. SHE
[1:20:28] SAID, "DON'T SAY THAT. DON'T OH, PLEASE
[1:20:29] DON'T SAY THAT. UH IT'LL END
[1:20:31] EVERYTHING." AND and brother Bram says,
[1:20:33] "BUT YEAH, YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO END
[1:20:34] ANYWAY. It's going to be over anyway."
[1:20:37] SHE WAS SCARED TO COME INTO that
[1:20:38] confession. Right?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; But you see on the other side is such a
[1:20:42] victory.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And when whoever it is, they come into
[1:20:48] this one simple place. God begins to
[1:20:52] show his power and begins to work and he
[1:20:55] steps in. He says, "I see there's a
[1:20:57] depth of sincerity.
[1:21:00] This isn't a mental exercise. This isn't
[1:21:02] a mental counseling exercise.
[1:21:05] They've dropped to a deeper depth of
[1:21:07] sincerity and repentance and confession.
[1:21:10] They're not afraid anymore to trust God.
[1:21:14] Friends, I've seen it whether it's here
[1:21:16] at an altar, just seen it if we had
[1:21:19] praying for young people last week at
[1:21:21] the camp and the differences in people
[1:21:23] would come and they just I guess I can
[1:21:26] speak because I don't know I didn't know
[1:21:28] most of their names. They come and for
[1:21:30] you about hour and a half they had them
[1:21:33] coming up to the ministers and everyone
[1:21:35] just just con and and when you see that
[1:21:37] young boy and he actually falls in
[1:21:41] weeping because he's bound by
[1:21:43] pornography and he falls to his knees
[1:21:46] and he says I'm telling it's the first
[1:21:48] time I've said it to any I'm tell just
[1:21:50] to you two brothers to pray with me but
[1:21:52] I'm ready tonight to lay this completely
[1:21:55] down.
[1:21:57] I'm telling you friends, I don't know.
[1:22:00] It looks like sincerity to me, but God
[1:22:01] knows. And if that heart is ready,
[1:22:04] something supernaturally
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; steps in
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and it can be done. It can be over.
[1:22:13] I serve a mighty God.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I serve a supernatural God.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I say I serve a God that showed me the
[1:22:19] way to a supernatural God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And we're not limited tonight. We're not
[1:22:25] intimidated by people that are smarter
[1:22:27] than us. We're not intimidated by the
[1:22:29] educational system and the the mega
[1:22:32] churches and they seem more successful.
[1:22:34] I don't care about any of that. I want
[1:22:36] to find that channel for lives to be
[1:22:38] changed, my life to be changed.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God tonight. I believe
[1:22:44] we agree. Hallelujah. Well, this was
[1:22:47] this was enjoyable tonight. I enjoyed
[1:22:49] being here at church. Can you say amen?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and give our Lord
[1:22:53] praise. Let's give him a hand tonight.
[1:22:55] God is good.
[1:22:59] Hallelujah. What a mighty God we serve.
[1:23:03] Come on, singing it. Oh, what a mighty
[1:23:06] God we serve. Yeah. Angels bow before
[1:23:12] him. Heaven and earth adore. Well, what
[1:23:16] a mighty God we serve. I want to hear
[1:23:19] you singing now. Yeah. What a mighty
[1:23:22] God, sir.
[1:23:25] Yeah. What a mighty God we serve.
[1:23:30] Oh, angels bow [music] before him.
[1:23:33] Heaven and earth adore. Oh, what a
[1:23:37] mighty [music and singing] God we serve.
[1:23:41] Jesus is the God [music and singing] we
[1:23:44] serve.
[1:23:46] Jesus is the God we serve. Amen.
[1:23:51] Yeah. Angels [singing and music] bow
[1:23:53] before him. Heaven and earth adore. Oh,
[1:23:57] Jesus is the [music and singing] God.
[1:23:59] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Oh,
[1:24:02] what a mighty [music] God we serve. What
[1:24:05] a mighty God. What a mighty God we
[1:24:10] serve.
[1:24:12] Angels [music] bow before him. Heaven
[1:24:15] and earth adore him. What a mighty
[1:24:18] [music]
[1:24:19] God we serve.
[1:24:23] Jesus is the God we serve.
[1:24:28] Jesus [music] is the God we serve.
[1:24:33] Angels for him. Heaven and earth adore
[1:24:37] him. What a mighty [music and singing]
[1:24:39] God. One more time. What a mighty God.
[1:24:43] What a mighty God [music and singing] we
[1:24:45] serve.
[1:24:48] What a mighty God we serve. Amen.
[1:24:53] Angels bow before him. [music]
[1:24:55] Heaven and earth adore. Oh, what a
[1:24:58] [singing] mighty God we serve. [music]
[1:25:02] Praise God. I'm a member of [singing]
[1:25:05] the blood. Wash back. I've been washed
[1:25:08] in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[1:25:14] I [music] was bound by chains of sin
[1:25:16] till one day the master came and he made
[1:25:20] me a member of it. Aren't you glad
[1:25:22] tonight to be a member of that band?
[1:25:25] Praise God. I'm [singing] a member
[1:25:27] [music] of the blood wash. I've been
[1:25:30] washed in the soul cleansing blood of
[1:25:34] the lamb.
[1:25:36] I was bound by chains of sin till one
[1:25:39] day [music] the master came.
[1:25:42] Maybe a member of
[1:25:45] man.
[1:25:47] We're a band of [music] Christian
[1:25:49] soldiers fighting Satan [singing] every
[1:25:52] day. We're standing up for Jesus [music]
[1:25:55] while we're kneeling down to pray. If
[1:25:58] his precious blood has cleansed you and
[1:26:01] washed away your sin, that makes you a
[1:26:04] member of the blood wash. [music]
[1:26:09] Oh, praise God. I'm a member.
[1:26:13] Hallelujah. I've been washed [music] in
[1:26:15] the soul with the blood [singing] of the
[1:26:18] lamb.
[1:26:20] Well, I was [music] bound by chain of
[1:26:22] sin. Till one day the master came,
[1:26:26] made me a member of the blood wash band.
[1:26:30] Just before we go, God's children are
[1:26:33] advancing, marching till we [music]
[1:26:35] reach the door. For the battle's almost
[1:26:38] over, we'll soon be going home. I can
[1:26:42] hear the sounds [music] of angels as the
[1:26:45] saints go marching [singing] in. Sing
[1:26:47] praises to the captain of the bloody
[1:26:50] [music] waters man.
[1:26:53] Praise God. [singing]
[1:26:54] I'm a member of the blood [music]
[1:26:57] washed Mary. I am washed in the soy
[1:27:01] blood [singing] of the lamb.
[1:27:04] I was bound by [music] Jesus sill. One
[1:27:07] day the master came to make me a member
[1:27:12] of the blood [music] washing man.
[1:27:16] Everybody said amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:20] It's real. Our God is real. Praise.
[1:27:23] Welcome home on Sister Jane. God bless
[1:27:25] you. You come in and Bo and Miriam take
[1:27:28] off to Mexico. So, amen. It's good to
[1:27:31] have all of you here tonight. If we
[1:27:33] think about these things [music] in our
[1:27:34] everyday life,
[1:27:37] let's learn to drop to the real level of
[1:27:41] sincerity and prayer when something
[1:27:43] comes up
[1:27:45] and and things come up. If things are
[1:27:48] not coming up in your life, please come
[1:27:49] and tell me what you're doing because
[1:27:51] things come up. But we have to learn
[1:27:54] this thing of entering into this real
[1:27:56] depth of sincerity to show to show the
[1:27:58] Lord. I don't want this to just be a
[1:28:01] surface response to [music] this. I
[1:28:03] don't want it to be
[1:28:05] a quick prayer over dinner.
[1:28:08] God is great. God is good. Let us thank
[1:28:10] him for this foot.
[1:28:13] But we enter in and God knows that
[1:28:15] listen, we have a channel here we can
[1:28:17] get in for this need. This baby's got a
[1:28:19] fever.
[1:28:22] This this marriage in our family is is
[1:28:26] troubled.
[1:28:28] God, it's affecting my heart.
[1:28:31] Lord, I'm going before you as a son and
[1:28:34] daughter of God. You're the high priest
[1:28:35] of [music] our confection. Is that what
[1:28:38] he said? He's the high priest of our
[1:28:39] kids. So he brother Bram says he acts
[1:28:41] upon our confession
[1:28:44] and if we're dropping into the sincerity
[1:28:46] we're take is saying Lord this is I want
[1:28:49] to find that channel Lord where you
[1:28:51] [music] take over.
[1:28:54] We we can't be insincere with it. We
[1:28:56] have to
[1:28:57] we have to say, Lord, I I I want to show
[1:28:59] you. I I I believe that you're able to
[1:29:02] do this. And I'm sincerely asking for
[1:29:04] you to do it. And I I if there's
[1:29:07] anything in my life, remove it, Lord.
[1:29:08] Just take it from my but I'm coming in
[1:29:11] faith now. And I believe with all my
[1:29:13] heart you're able. Let's not just let
[1:29:15] the preachers do it. Let's not just say,
[1:29:17] "I need to get to the preacher." Let's
[1:29:19] every young person here tonight,
[1:29:22] every person, no matter how long you've
[1:29:23] been serving the Lord, even if it's just
[1:29:24] been a short time, recognize that this
[1:29:27] is something Hadley Wright and probably
[1:29:29] never didn't think she was worthy of it.
[1:29:32] This is something for me. This is a
[1:29:34] channel that he's purchased that I can
[1:29:36] get into when the preacher is not
[1:29:38] around. I can pray
[1:29:41] and that prayer can get through and and
[1:29:44] bombard heaven. Praise the Lord. God
[1:29:46] bless y'all tonight. You're dismissed in
[1:29:48] Jesus [music] name. Amen. Isabelle, why
[1:29:51] don't you play us something nice nice as
[1:29:53] we go? Your ways are higher than mine.
[1:29:56] Can you play that one? Your ways are
[1:29:59] higher than mine. I'll sing it and then
[1:30:02] she can pick it up. Your ways [singing]
[1:30:06] are higher than mine.
[1:30:11] I want mountains to move.
[1:30:15] You [singing] want me to climb.
[1:30:19] I'm going to trust your work,
[1:30:24] your will, [singing]
[1:30:25] and your time.
[1:30:33] Your ways [singing] are higher than
[1:30:36] mine.
[1:30:41] Your ways are higher than mine.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; I want [music] mountains, too. Yes,
[1:30:50] Lord. Want me to climb.
[1:30:55] So, I'm going to trust your word, your
[1:31:00] will, and [singing and music] your time.
[1:31:05] Cuz your ways [singing] are higher.
[1:31:09] Just before you go, let her play it one
[1:31:11] time. Minister to us, Isabelle.
[1:31:23] Amen. [singing] Amen.
[1:31:25] Help us Lord to follow you.
[1:31:29] Help us Lord
[1:31:34] in [singing] your time. [music]
[1:31:44] are higher than
[1:31:48] God bless you tonight. You're dismissed.
[1:31:50] Your ways are higher than mine.
[1:31:53] [singing]
[1:31:57] I want mountains to move.
[1:32:01] You want [singing] me [music] to climb.
[1:32:04] So I'm going to trust your word, your
[1:32:10] will, and your time.
[1:32:19] Your ways are [singing and music] higher
[1:32:22] than mine.
[1:32:25] Oh, [singing and music] your ways are
[1:32:28] higher than mine.
[1:32:31] Thank you, Lord. I want mountains to
[1:32:35] move.
[1:32:37] You want me to climb.
[1:32:41] I'm going to [music] trust your word,
[1:32:45] your will, and your time.
[1:32:54] Yeah.
[1:32:55] Your ways are higher than mine.
[1:33:03] Your ways [music and singing] are high.
[1:33:11] You [music]
[1:33:14] want me [singing] to climb?
[1:33:19] Trust [music] your [singing]
[1:33:24] time.
[1:33:32] Your ways are high. Can we have the
[1:33:35] first verse?
[1:33:39] It's [singing] not what I prayed for.
[1:33:43] It's not what I wanted. [singing]
[1:33:46] It's not something [music] I understand.
[1:33:54] My circumstances
[1:33:57] seem so confused.
[1:34:00] I'm placing it on your hand.
[1:34:04] [singing and music]
[1:34:07] Because your ways are higher than mine.
[1:34:15] I want [music] mountains [singing] to
[1:34:17] move.
[1:34:19] You want me to climb.
[1:34:23] I'm going [music and singing] to trust
[1:34:25] your word, your will, and your time.
[1:34:37] Your waves [singing] are high
[1:34:40] enough.
[1:34:46] [music]
[1:34:48] I will look [singing]
[1:34:52] at how you best.
[1:34:55] You should be singing this.
[1:34:58] Oh, you see from heaven. [singing]
[1:35:03] Oh, it's the hard time that keep my face
[1:35:08] ready and strong.
[1:35:14] Your ways [singing] are higher
[1:35:17] than mine.
[1:35:20] I want mountains to move.
[1:35:25] want me to cry. [singing and music]
[1:35:28] I'm going to trust your
[1:35:33] your will and your [singing] time.
[1:35:42] Oh, you're
[1:35:46] in my
[1:35:50] Tell me [singing] what do you do?
[1:35:55] when you've done all you can
[1:35:59] and it seems like it's never [singing]
[1:36:03] enough.
[1:36:06] And what do [music] you [singing] say
[1:36:10] when your friends turn away?
[1:36:14] You're [singing] all alone. [music]
[1:36:21] Tell [music] me, what do you give
[1:36:25] when you've given your all
[1:36:29] and it seems like you can't make it
[1:36:34] through.
[1:36:35] Well, you just stand.
[1:36:40] When there's nothing left to [music] do,
[1:36:43] you just stand.
[1:36:47] Watch the Lord see through.
[1:36:52] After you've done [music and singing]
[1:36:54] all you did,
[1:36:58] you just stay. [music]
[1:37:02] I got to go up higher. Quite quite a
[1:37:03] bit.
[1:37:06] Tell me, how do you handle
[1:37:10] guilt [music] of your past? Tell me, how
[1:37:15] do you [singing] deal [music] with the
[1:37:17] shame?
[1:37:20] And how can [music and singing] you
[1:37:22] smile
[1:37:24] while your heart has been broken
[1:37:27] filled with pain? [singing]
[1:37:33] [music] Tell me, what do you give
[1:37:38] when you give your all? [music]
[1:37:42] Seems like you can't make [singing] it
[1:37:46] through.
[1:37:49] Just stay.
[1:37:52] When there's nothing left to [music] do,
[1:37:55] you [singing]
[1:37:56] just stand.
[1:37:59] Watch the Lord see you
[1:38:01] [music and singing] through. Yes. After
[1:38:05] you've done all you [singing] can,
[1:38:10] you just stand.
[1:38:20] Amen.
[1:38:22] One more verse. Tell me, [singing] what
[1:38:25] do you do
[1:38:28] when you've done all you can?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Seems like it's never enough.
[1:38:38] And what do [music and singing]
[1:38:40] you say
[1:38:42] when your friends turn away and you're
[1:38:45] [singing] all alone?
[1:38:48] All alone.
[1:38:51] [music]
[1:38:51] Tell me, what do you give
[1:38:56] when you're giving your all?
[1:38:59] It seems like you can't [music] make it
[1:39:03] through.
[1:39:06] You just stand.
[1:39:09] When there's nothing left to do, [music]
[1:39:12] you just stand.
[1:39:16] Watch the Lord see you through.
[1:39:21] After you've [singing and music] done
[1:39:23] all you can. After
[1:39:28] after you've done all you can.
[1:39:33] Oh, after you've [music] done [singing]
[1:39:37] all you can. Oh,
[1:39:41] after [music] you've done all you can.
[1:39:49] After you've [music and singing] done
[1:39:51] all you can, what do you do? You just
[1:39:56] stand.
[1:40:05] Amen.
[1:40:07] Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] Hallelujah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:41:13] [music]
[1:41:26] [music]
