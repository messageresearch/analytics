========================================

be great we spend that together and i can't remember if that's all the announcements but brandon you can alert me later if i missed one of them i believe that's it for this weekend there's a youth meeting at my house friday night and we'll be teaching some more on friday night so remember that at seven to ten seven to ten o'clock we cut it off at ten i always emphasize that cut-off point i don't know why but i do amen i'm going to read tonight from second corinthians chapter four and we're going to study this chapter together this wednesday uh chapter three and chapter four and just break it down a little bit and so we'll just read a couple verses here to jump in second corinthians four and verse one therefore seeing we have this ministry seeing we have this ministry and you would have to look at the chapter four the chapter before to see what type of ministry that paul's talking about because he's been given a specific type of ministry therefore seeing we have this ministry we have as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god so that's the nature of the minis this ministry is to renounce the things of dishonesty not walk in craftiness not handling the word deceitfully but by manifestation of truth commending ourselves proving ourselves to every man's conscience and notice in the sight of god there's really nothing hidden in the sight of god so he said that's why i'm open with minister i'm not holding anything back and we expose thing when you talk about renouncing the hidden things of design you're exposing things by truth and you're doing that and you're you're doing that all in the sight of god because you can't hide anything from him this is the type of ministry paul had and then he says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and we'll just stop it right there precious lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your protection lord around this house that you've given us the storm that came last night lord i was i just stood amazed to see your protection over it lord and we're thankful you're doing so many mighty things lord and i know the enemy is always around trying to attack and strike not just the building but strike our lives and just discourage us lord but we will not be discouraged tonight and we will stand uh and turn up our praise and drown out our doubts and lord jesus you've given us something lord of this eternal life and this holy ghost that something beyond anything the devil can combat against or come against it's greater than anything in this world lord jesus i pray that you'll minister tonight to your congregation and to the people whether they're here online i pray the word would go forth and you help me to set aside lord my own feelings and my own ways lord until you can just get inside each person's heart lord and you guide them and direct them as a great shepherd we love you father forgive us if we've done anything to displease you or grieve you lord just cleanse it by your blood tonight and may we stand before you pure by your blood and worship you and now we worship you as we listen to the word of god we just commit it to you in jesus name we ask it amen praise the lord god bless you may be seated tonight and you remember on sunday when i mentioned the the security person in the airport that told me to pull down my mask so he could see who i was and that was my title of the sermon sunday talk a little bit about that and so i thought it was interesting that it just dawned on me that that's what they do to be able to see who my identity is and who i really am and that the the truth that identity identity is mostly revealed in the face uh in the expression in the conversation and it's looked at in the face that's most of where the identity would be revealed is in the face the expression the conversation being able to look someone in their eye can tell a lot you can tell a lot by looking in someone's eyes you can tell a lot by looking in someone's face and how they talk and their expressions and you can tell negative or positive you can say you can see so much and not only by a person's countenance but also the things that come out of their mouth is a revealing of their identity what they believe what they stand for what they talk about mostly can you say ma'am so this is very and this truth of this truth of identity being revealed in the countenance is the reason i'm going back to it is it's in the scripture it's very much a truth that's tied to scripture not only for our lord jesus christ but for ourselves as well and we will see that tonight as we study the word together that this truth of unmasking and taking the veil off in the chapter you find taking the veil off and unmasking this is what jesus christ wants to do first of all for himself he doesn't want to wear a master hide anything from you he wants to reveal himself to you he wants to you to look into his face spiritually as it were and when we look into his face then we are changed can you say amen but it is not only the lord that is part of this truth of unmasking but it's us as well and we're going to find that out tonight because when we unmask and when we tear all the walls down and when we are open uh and have an open face before the lord then we know that uh something can change in our lives as well so a person and a person who is covering their face is uh usually hiding something be like a robber when he goes and robs the bank they usually wear the the thing around their face because either the security cameras are going to catch them or somebody across the teller will see them and so now they could have all their cl their clothes but they cover their face because they want to cover their identity because they're they're hiding themselves so you know i know this is very simple but i'm just going to be simple tonight that's the principle we have behind this when you talk about a mask and hiding the face it's usually because somebody's hiding something if somebody has a blemish or they had a surgery or something some you know too many pimples sometimes or something sometimes you'll see somebody hiding their face or covering their face and they have a maybe a severe wound on their face and so that's not a bad reason they're covering it but they are trying to hide their blemish they're trying to hide their thing i suppose we can get in the whole subject of makeup right now but we'll just leave that alone how that that is also used to hide things well praise the lord but in the principles of the the lord and principles of spiritual principles we find that god does not want us to to hide anything god doesn't want to hide from us he said to the pharisees one day he says he said i've hid these things from the wise and prudent but revealed the numb to babes such as will learn and so now he desires to reveal himself to his sons and daughters of god he does not want to hide himself from his sons and so when we speak of a mass we speak of hiding something so we just want to settle down tonight and look a little bit about these uh passages here in second readings i try to keep from preaching and just try to talk about them a little bit because i want us to just be able to understand sometimes on a sunday morning not able to step back into the scripture and just break them down each scripture and i'd like to do that but we're understanding through this text how important this is and paul says seeing we have this type of ministry let's just talk about that a minute this type of ministry we have this ministry uh where in this ministry that he had is the same ministry of the last days god's sending a prophet god's speaking through a prophet and when the word of the lord comes in that way we know the bible says that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart in other words again you can't hide anything he doesn't want you hiding anything and so when this ministry comes it's not time for hiding it's time for being open when this ministry comes it's time for a revealing it's time it's not try time to pretend it's not time to hide can you say amen but it's time to for things to be revealed including about yourself and there's nothing that can be hidden that god doesn't know already but sometimes god needs you to be honest and open and not hide anything from him or maybe even a brother or sister that you can confide in the bible says to confront one another come to one another if you be overtaken in a fault or go to another brother but it says confess our faults one to another why in the world would paul teach us to confess our faults and our weaknesses to one another it's about unmasking it's about not hiding it's about exposing the enemy it's about being accountable to another brother and saying listen i'm going to tell about this because i want you to pray with me about this i'm not going to hide anything and i find when the more people hold stuff and hide it on the inside the devil uses that to keep you bound on the inside it's better to share it with the lord it's better to share with someone you have confidence in because you expose the enemy so you know this type of ministry in the last days is under the message of this last days is the same type and and uh so i want to just bring this back so paul says this ministry what kind of ministry is it a new testament minister will have an open ministry it's not veiled but it's plain it's not just the letter but it's the spirit in the chapter before he says the letter killeth the spirit giveth life what type of ministry in this is this it's not a veiled ministry it's plain it's not a letter but it's the spirit it's not just a religion but actually it's the glory and the power of god in it because it's an open ministry then paul says i preach this way because it's an open ministry i preach this way verse 2 i have renounced the things of dishonesty not walking craftiness can i read it in the amplified but we have renounced the disgraceful things hidden because of shame not walking in trickery or adulterating the word of god but by stating the truth openly and plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god so we renounce the disgraceful things that are hidden not walking in trickery or adultery of the of the word of god one place he says we don't use enticing words of man's wisdom but i come to you in the power can you say man so it's it's man's wisdom is try to entice use trickery with words use the bible and be crafty with it to kind of swindle around paul said i don't have to do any of that i'm just preaching it just like it is and i'm not holding anything back in in chapter 3 and verse 12 he says because of this we use great plainness of speech i'm using plainness of speech i'm not using dark sayings or try to hide something but i'm being very open with you this ministry is an open ministry it's not hiding can you say amen and because it's open it also exposes the enemy that's why he doesn't like this ministry the devil's not done any trouble with religion he has trouble with the ministry of the last days because it's too open exposes people too much exposes demons too much praise the lord i believe i got some good things here that'll wake some of you up here eventually tonight can you say amen so we we speak boldly to speak plainness of speech means we we're speaking boldly and openly why it's this ministry it's not hiding anything it's not holding anything back it's not restricting to save face it's not political it's not saying what people want to hear always this that's not this ministry of the last days saying what people want to hear this if you want that you better find another church and find another place find another message because this ministry doesn't fit if it's something that just is conniving to just try to preach a political thing that's politically correct or preach something that the people just want to hear this but they don't want to hear the rest of it that's not this type of ministry this is great plainness of speech can you say amen this exposes the things of dishonesty and you know sometimes when you listen to some radio preachers not all but some tv and radio preachers it's very obvious if you know your bible that many of these preachers on the radio and tv are completely silent on certain passages in that bible never heard him in all their 30 years of ministry ever bring up certain passages in here and that's really sad because it's just as much a part of the bible as the rest of the bible grace they preach on grace a lot but grace is is a part of the bible but god's judgment is just so much a part of the bible didn't get too many amens hear about that god tells a man and woman to dress different that's just as much a part of this bible interesting we never hear that part it's not politically correct to talk about it so you hear so much but you see him silent completely silent on certain subjects of the bible and so they never go there and yet if they were under paul's ministry if they were listening to paul paul was not bound by money paul was not bound by position paul was not bound by feelings can you say amen paul was not bound by the will of man he wasn't bound by anything he preached plainly it preached the word and it was an openness you take a real holy ghost minister under this last day's ministry and he is not limited to any he's not going to limit himself to any passage in this bible can you say amen he speaks it he blows the trumpet a last-days minister that preaches by the holy ghost is blowing the trumpet loud and not holding anything back thank god for preachers the fifo ministry that will not withhold preaching anything in this bible for politics for feelings of the people thank god that you're under ministries that will preach it like it is not hidden things of dishonesty not using the word of god craftily but just preach it the way it is can you say amen and these ministers blow the trumpet loudly and speak it plainly my wife and i have always said about our dear brother tim pruitt has a wonderful ministry we've been blessed by it through the years but i tell you we always leave his sermons and we say many times that when you leave brother tim pruitt's sermon there's never a doubt never a doubt about where he stands and that's a compliment we're given a compliment there's never one ounce of doubt where he stands and and i think that's something that we need more of today is men who be honest praise the lord he stands on the word of god and leave nothing uncovered and it may even hurt just a little bit sometimes but isn't it better being a little bit hurt down here isn't it better being corrected here than to be corrected on judgment day isn't it better to receive a little chastening from the lord here i would rather hear it in a service can you say amen and let my lord use that minister to correct something here even if it takes the very height off of my back spiritually but i'd rather get it here than get it on judgment day praise the lord for god called mister so so we're we're saying you know to some preachers come on just say it say it the way the word says it and as the word advances along there is less and less hiding as the word becomes more and more perfected to us there's less and less hiding in other words it becomes more and more open all the time when he came down with the book of redemption in revelations 10 it was no longer a closed book it was an open book can you say amen that says something of the type of ministry that it will be that things will no longer be closed but it will be open this bible will no longer be closed to us but the veils will be taken off i'm just preaching to you this is the type of ministry that we're under and uh as the word advances it becomes more and more that way now let's go back to chapter three and just work through it just a little bit chapter three says do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others and i just wanted to say um that paul will get into some things here he says do you we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or let letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so if you go over to chapter 4 hold your place there in chapter three but read here at the very end of this subject and i say it's the end but it's it's kind of the climax of where he's going chapter 4 and verse 6 says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ what's he talking about in both these chapters us looking into the face of christ openly seeing the face of christ in a minute he'll talk about veils and he takes all the veils away why is he take the veils away so there's like moses there was a veil but with christ he takes all the veils away so when we're looking at this we're looking into the face of christ so now with that in mind that that's the subject it's we're going to be face to face we're going to look into the face of christ that's that's what he's going in now he brings out he says not with written with ink but he says ye are living epistles written and read of all men doesn't that say something about this ministry as well is that we think it all stops with books we think it stops with this bible but that was never the intent to stop with the bible and as long as you read your bible you're okay you should read your bible but actually where this goes where this glory goes is not in the bible but it actually was writ it's written in our hearts and we become written epistles read of all men it's the word made flesh in other words when paul brings the message then then he says in verse 3 for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of the minister's bias written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart can you imagine the jews trying to understand that who put such weight in the scrolls everything was what was written on the scrolls they were valued they were protected they were brought out in the synagogue every time and read it was very important the ink on the paper and now paul's presenting a ministry but listen that's not the final end is some ink on a paper that's not where this is going this ministry it's going to be written epistles but not with ink on paper there's a more powerful thing than the ink on the paper there's a more powerful thing than a quote in a book and that's when god by the holy spirit begins to write this word in you and that's the same ministry of the message we're under today the lord this is what i was saying about sunday the first and second poll if the first and second poll of jesus ministry and the ministry of the last days was so personal such a personal god touching the hand and healing the sick knowing every need second pole revealing the secrets of the heart such a personal god is the third pole just become mechanical is the same personal god that came down in the first and second poll and got so personal that he actually knew your house number and revealed the very secrets of your heart from many years ago that no man would have known that's why he preached on sunday does the personal god now in the third world become mechanical does it become head knowledge does it become just ink on a page no i say the third part is even deeper than the first and second poll and it's even more personal god than the first and second poll but men we've made it just memorizing quotes we made it just putting quotes together uh uh we made it's more than just putting quotes together it's more than just the quotes that's on the page it's more than just the ink that's been put on so many books and we're helping to send the book still around the world there's a great demand for books but it's only that's only a mechanical device so that someone as they're reading can look into the very face of christ and be changed by the glory of god so we have that as a crutch thank god that we have it god uses it but it is not it is not the final result that we have a bible in our hand it's not just the ink on the page it's not just memorizing quotes it's not putting quotes together it's not just owning the table on your phone it's it's it's on the tables of the heart the bible just said that's the table it's not an app on your phone he wants to write this upon your heart fleshly tables of the heart don't ever settle for i've got this app or i've got this bible or i've got all the books or i've got this the met no don't ever sell that's not where this ministry ends but we are to be written epistles read and of all men can you say amen and this scripture is proof of what he said about the book of redemption that i quoted to you sunday this scripture that says this is not the written ink on the page but this is fleshly tables of a heart not stone and it's written on the heart we are written epistles and the way brother branham says it is he says it this way he says the book of redemption what is it christ is the book and the bride is the words in the book he says he says it a different way but he's saying the same thing as paul what's the book what is this all about it's not books and tapes it's not the ink on the page christ is the book of redemption and the bride is the words in the book that's why we shouldn't make it mechanical that's why we shouldn't make it head knowledge that's why we shouldn't make the message if you just have this and you've got all the quotes together then everything's fine no that's not this ministry it's the the word made flesh it's the face of christ face to face is better than just a book amen if you had a choice to read the book or to meet the author and have them tell you the story which would you do thank you amen you meet the author and then if you meet the author first and then you go read the book and you've got a signed copy in his praise the lord you've got your bible you've got the message you've got these different things but if you meet the author when you go to read the book and it's been signed in blood by the author because you went to a signing at church and he signed his own name on your life now when you go read the book it's like okay i understand this because i met the author i met the man who wrote the book and so i read it naturally while reading it i learned that it was written just for me the bible is the greatest book it's words i highly treasure but the reason that the bible's the greatest book is because i met the author amen i might sing it again because you're almost awake now i met the man who wrote the book and so i read it naturally while reading it i learned that book was written just for me the bible is the greatest book it's words i highly treasure the bible is the greatest book since i met the author this is not a mechanical thing that we come to at the final stage of the third poll in the final ministry that somehow this becomes head knowledge it's a personal god writes it upon the tables of your heart it's a personal relationship with him can you say amen so here's what brother brahma said here about living bibles again he said to them if i do not the works if you guys have that quote up there if i do not the works of my father then believe me not but though you don't believe me believe the works see that's god expressing himself through the flesh he was god made flesh the word living word that's the reason christians i think it's so real tonight that we should live the right kind of life because there's so many people who won't take time to read the bible but they'll read you see you are a written epistle of god a real true born-again christian is the word expressed again because you're written epistles of god read of all men we can say amen to that because it's the same thing in the bible we are written and pressed was read about man look what he says now though what type of person should we be if we know that our lives is an open living bible to the unbeliever to express god in our own life that's a good question first of all we should be open living bibles we'll get into it in a little bit in a minute but if anybody shouldn't be wearing a mask and pretending and being closed and being hidden with their christianity or hidden about things that they're not telling god or not telling one another if anybody should not be being that way it should be christians why because people are watching our lives and i say to you when the book of redemption came down in revelations 10 and it was an open book then if he's an open book christ to us then we need to be a life of an open book and brother brahm says that we must live open lives we must be open books if people are watching us he says we should be a living bible to the unbeliever to express god in our own life notice now we see he was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now we find out that in hebrews you're writing it down hebrews 4 12 the bible said the word of god is sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the asunder of morrow and bone and the discerner of the thoughts in the heart the word of god discerns the thoughts that's in your heart therefore god tonight being the word knows exactly what you're even thinking about this very minute so though we try to hide we can't really hide anything so we should live a life that's an open book you see this tonight i want i want my life to be an open book i don't have anything to hide from god and i don't have anything to hide from one another praise the lord the word of god discerns the thoughts and in your heart therefore god tonight being the word knows exactly what you're even thinking about this very minute so should not our thoughts be pure clean holy always thinking the best he's not talking about our actions you talk about an open life you talk about an accountable life he's not talking about just our actions he's talking about our thoughts if this is if god can discern and people are looking this he brings up two things the word can discern it knows what's going on second of all people are watching your life and they're reading your bible if you're a living bible tonight how's your bible reading is it covered over is it covered with a mask is it covered with a veil on top of it is it covered with a private sin how if we knew that nobody in their life would ever read the bible and the only thing they ever read was your bible their whole life the only thing they ever seen was your life how does your bible read tomorrow at work how does your bible read because i'm not talking about here at church i'm talking about how you are tomorrow i'm talking about how you live next week if you're how many raise your hand i'm a living bible i believe i'm the living bible of god i'm the word made flesh how's your bible reading how does it look to the world is it open or is it covered over is your life under a mask and covered over and just some questions he's asking he's also saying your mind your thoughts what you're thinking about never mind what people are saying seeing but look how open this is live your day with positive always thinking the best can you say amen could we live every day always bringing our thoughts under subjection and thinking our best could we live clean and holy and pure thoughts before god you live that way it'll translate into a life people know it can you say amen so i want to be an open bible in my life i want to be an open bible not a closed bible i want somebody to meet me and they start to learn i'm a christian but i'm a very closed person i'm very just very close my heart is closed and i don't know if i'm going to share anything with them because i don't trust them yet no no no my life is an open book and i'll share my testimony and i'll share my weaknesses and i'll share this is the sin that i was in and god delivered me don't think that you're in deep deep sin my life was this way and i'm sharing i don't have anything to hide can you say amen my life has become an open book if you believers of this message believe we're in the hour of the open book of redemption why are you hiding so much in your heart how can you believe the open book of redemption and close your life off to god and other people you have to be an open book too oh praise the lord amen so let's let's continue to keep going here verse four and such trust we have through christ to godward chapter three verse five not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiencies of god who also have made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth with the spirit give life he's just said we are able ministers of the new testament there's a lot of preachers that are only ministers and they're very able ministers of the old testament they only preach the law they only preach the letter do it and you'll be fine here's the dress code here's what you're supposed to do here's a and you better you should do it and everybody will be watching and if you don't do the right thing you're going to get the elevator look and you won't be comfortable around here just do it and you'll be fine that's a minister an able minister of the old testament but we are not to be ministers of the old testament which means just the letter because why the letter without the spirit of life kills the word in jest letter form without spirit and glory of god kills that's what the bible says that's why i don't want to be a minister of the old testament i want to be a minister of the new testament that has life in it but the letter by itself you say well he's talking about moses law i'm talking about any word and i'm going to go ahead and step out and say it just the letter of the message will kill you if you don't have no holy ghost and no life in you the letter's still killing. and there's many ministers that's preaching the letter the letter of it but they're old testament able ministers they're not ministers of the new testament think about that a minute i'm not i'm an able minister of the new testament going along verse seven but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was so glorious so that the children of israel could not step vastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how should not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious but if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory did you hear what he just called the minister the old testament did you already call it the ministration of condemnation you imagine a ministry if you just preach the old testament if you just preach the letter you know what kind of ministry that is it's a ministry of condemnation i'm just reading it what it says in the bible he called it the ministration of condemnation but notice if that had glory in moses face how much more when ministers preached the life and glory how much more glory is in this my think about it the ministration of death administration of condemnation and that glory was hovering around and in moses face they had he had to veil his face for even that verse for ten for even that which was made glorious had no glory in it this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away in other words in verse 10 he's basically saying in verse 10 if you go back he's saying even if that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excellent now we come to this glory it's as if that wasn't any glory at all can you imagine jews listen to him what are you talking about you're putting down moses the prophet but he's saying this glory excelleth that glory if i had to make a choice i'd never go back to moses again oh how the jews must have loved that sermon and he's calling it that saying if you're comparing it that doesn't even have any glory in it compared to this glory for that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth this glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished so moses had to veil himself because the people couldn't look at him there was so much glory upon his countenance he had to put a veil a mask on on top of it to cover it verse 14 now moses goes into the children of israel today but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil and taken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ so them staying in their religion and not moving on with the new testament and what christ was bringing after calvary them staying with that they become blinded by that can you say amen and they have a veil upon their heart they have a veil upon their understanding they have a mask that's holding them back and then he says verse 15 but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart i mentioned that sunday that even until this day when the prophet is read there's a veil in their heart so right here i want to just say it's not just that god would take the veil off of himself but we have to take all veils off of ourselves because if god takes his off and says the glory is available to you and we hold something and we hide something and we have a veil on then we're limiting ourselves to the glory of god we'll get into it in just a minute nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord israel when they turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away so the key in this is the lord of the message the lord of the the the truth the lord of the preaching whatever you want to call it it's not just having the letter but it's that presence of the lord it's the person of the lord how many remember me preaching it sunday it's the person of the message and when they turn to the person that's within this all veils are taken away in this person now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the lord are changed in the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so israel had their own veil so if they did so can we have a veil or a mask on even through even though god takes god takes his mask off israel's but what was it it was a religious veil and their religious veil limited them from seeing further truth their religious male it's happening today they're a religious veil of a denomination and a view of the scripture veils and holds the people back from further truth that's even laying in the scripture because they're limited by the veil they can't see it all because they have a mask can you say amen and so they're limited they're limited what is it their former teaching or even a religious spirit can be a mask on someone keeping them from the real thing religious spirit is the worst kind what's a religious spirit it's a pride number one but it's a religious pride that thinks that it's a notch above everybody else sometimes way beyond everybody else but it's also very critical because nobody else ever measures up to where they're at the expectations of everybody else never measures up to where they're at or maybe they're where they want to be they're not really there but they think they are their pride so this is a religious pride to think that we're way up here they didn't need to humble themselves and accept christ they didn't need to do that they had the law they had moses they were religious leaders they had their understanding they studied it all their life they come up through all the different denominations and the pharisees and sadducees and you could be a part of uh three or four different groups back then and you were taught you taught in the bible taught in the taught in the old testament you knew it so well but what happens is that without the spirit it lifts up in pride and a religious pride to the when christ stands in the room they can't humble themselves to just be open and lay down their life before christ when the lord steps in the room they're already a notch better so they don't really need remember what jesus said when the pharisees go in the temple they say great big loud prayers and to be seen of men and all these clothes and everything he said don't be like that when you go in to pray go into your private closet and the god that the god that sees you in private will reward you openly all those things about the phrase don't be a pharisee don't have a religious spirit dominating your have the holy ghost dominating your life leading your life leading it but don't take a religious spirit that i'm better and this is what israel had and it was a mask a religious spirit can be a mask keeping you from the real holy ghost and the real walk of the holy ghost a religious spirit robs people because they never can humble themselves to see that they're human they're weak their religious spirit interprets that i'm past all that i gave my heart to the lord years ago i'm a message believer i'm going in the rapture but if you've got hidden things in your life you better get rid of that religious spirit and get the real holy ghost if you have a religious pious spirit making you look better and degrading and putting others down you can't go any deeper than where you're at right now the next quote that i have i love it because it talks about the first you know there's a word i think that's associated with pharisee that's a mask it's putting on a mask and the way brother brown describes is what does the pharisee mean we don't use that word very often in kentucky what does the pharis word pharisee mean in the greek it means an actor someone who acts oh i hate that somebody acting trying to put on i despise such a thing many times people are trying to act like they the other fella listen you quit trying to act like the next fella and just act out your own convictions and you'll get along better be yourself that's right you see so many little children going to the picture shows come back home and want to act like the actress shame on you in hollywood los angeles i have many services out there and i find out that most of the people that's grown up on that whole environment of the american people to act it's in other words if they lived out there or now it's because it's on all the tvs and all the movies our tendency as a human being is the children to act out what they're watching they are not that but they act it out they are not that but they put on the mask of it in other words they aren't that but they're going to dress just like that sports star they're going to put their hair just like that sports star and then come in the room and tell us this is an original thing that i've always wanted to do just give me about five minutes that i can google it and find exactly where that movie star or sports star has that where you found it and brother ram says i hate when someone pretends and tries to be someone else americans comparing themselves oh let's talk about facebook who the studies now are you reading the studies the last two or three years did you read the one yesterday that put it on teenage girls one out of three teenage girls going through depression and all that bringing it back to facebook and instagram study just yesterday and instagram and facebook don't want to comment about it they don't because they're making so much money and all this other stuff they want to leave it alone but their comment in the article i read it again this afternoon their comment was is that if 40 or 50 years ago we had to take the cigarette companies and nip them in the bud and correct them because they were advertising to our teenagers but they weren't showing the damages to this they said we should be doing the same thing with social media because it's a comparison thing and they go into depression because they can never measure up to everybody else on there so we're not in the days of brother brown talking about hollywood we're talking about every day we're bombarded with images of someone else who looks better has more things is on a better vacation and we're it was just depression depression depression depression depression because we can never be so we strive to be someone else and all the time god's saying why don't you just take all the mask off and just be what i made you be be who i made you be real don't be an actor don't act like a sports star don't dress like a sports star i didn't call you to be a sports star and if i did i want you to be out there being yourself not someone else all the little pretty little hairdos of these football players and basketball players and i'm i'm saying i used to say it just maybe every other few games and say oh doesn't he look like a little cutie now i'm saying it all the time doesn't he look or she look cute isn't that cute everyone has all the emphasis on the hair but what the bad thing is is when christians try to imitate that it's wrong so you see them go on screen and the american people through television through picture shows they have seen so much put on do they become put-ons themselves did you what this is this is going all the way back to the message pride back in the 50s is so much truth to it they've seen so many people put on that they start to put things on it rubs off on them and we get in the we get it in the church we get actors hmm god don't want them far be it from us to be actors that's what a pharisee is an actor be yourself god wants you to be that way i despise seeing someone trying to do something that they cannot do what a disgrace i call this a wannabe he's a wannabe he always wants to be somebody else he wants to be this he wants to be that he wants to be a successful he wants to be a a successful mayor and he wants to be like like this guy and that guy and he reads all the books and it's a wannabe and they live their whole life as a wannabe never laying their lives before and saying god what do you want me to do who do you want me to be and if it's in a factory somewhere taking my lunch to work every day supporting my family brother abraham said god in simplicity said god can get more glory out of that simple life of grabbing his lunch kissing his wife praying with his family and goes to work every day he said god will get more glory out of that life than all the high high seminary preachers because god's hiding himself in simplicity but he says some pretty straight words here when he says i hate and he says god don't want them far be it from us to be actors be yourself god wants you to be that way i despise seeing someone trying to do something they cannot do what a disgrace i've noticed that many times in beautiful voices that god has given to people a talent and then they overtrain it i hate to hear an overtrained voice when they stand up to sing and get some kind of a note until they hold it so long till they get blue in the face just to show the congregation how long they can hang on for dear life you're acting they're putting on a show it's performance and i believe in doing your best and doing the very best of your gift but don't perform to me don't put on a show for me sing in the holy ghost worship god sing your best but when it crosses the line into entertainment and performance it can only head in one wrong direction people of god don't want to be entertained and perform to can you say man and when they come back down after holding on for dear life and when they come back down then people is not praising god their mind is on their note oh boy you know i'm talking about being open and honest in this ministry that's a pretty honest comment not too many people in the music world will say that and be honest about it that sometimes the people are not praising the lord they're praising how well the person's saying the praising how well wow they're being wowed by oh that was so awesome praise the lord i don't know and so this is a good lesson for all of us christians it's a good lesson for musicians we need to have the anointing of god and do our very best to play skillfully on our instrument and sing to the very best of our gifts but we need to be under such an anointing that the people lose that it's the singer and it's all about christ that's a challenge for all you ministers of music and all of you we and i'm not preaching against anybody here tonight because we have good ones and i tell them these we teach them these things we talk about these things and i try to to remind sometimes these because this is where the the prophet directed us is that we don't want to become an actor we don't want to copy what the next person is doing uh in the denominations this would apply to this can you say man we don't want to just say well i want to do that because they did it and i want to do it just like them where's your originality if you're inspired by a song then sing it to the glory of god and sing it your way when they come back down the people's not praising their mind they're they're praising god their minds on that note i love good old-fashioned pentecostal singing that's right where you forget the piano and the organ where you don't have to get some kind of ritualistic put on program where you raise up your hands with the tears running down from your cheeks whether you could sing do remy vasalati do or not and just sing in the spirit from the heart you give praise to god all out of all are all out of the program you have to get out of man's program to get into god's program get out of it oh my deliver me from being an actor can you say amen friends he's saying these open and honest things and it applies to all of our christian walk we don't put on what somebody else is doing we'd be ourselves we take the mask off can you say man god's being real with us we be real with god this is where i'm at even if you're living in sin tonight be honest with god don't put on something that i'm okay person i do good deeds i give to the united way i'm a pretty good person just be real about where you're at and if you're living a life of sin say god this is who i am this is where i'm at take me as i am just as i am without one plea and i just one more comment about the sing in the spirit and get out of men's program and i know that our music leaders here and i know the way brother kenny leads the choir is that we believe that you should play skillfully and do your best in rehearsing and do your very best to do it the best way you can for the lord but when you get up and start singing when it's time to sing it in front of the congregation then you just you still do your best but you just say lord bring the anointing now bring the anointing now and that's the way he teaches them that's the way to teach it because we believe in being our best and being skillful you do that in your job you should you work to become better at it and you be skillful but in a person you do that is a gift brother brahms said that it was a person that drew some art for him and had a nice picture he said i wish i had the money that boy's got a gift i wish i had the money to send him to college and develop that gift a little bit more you should develop your gifts you should become better at your gifts and do it is unto the lord when you come up to worship the lord then it's just all out there and say lord come lord jesus oh and if he wants to get out of the program then let him get out of the program deliver me from being an actor be what you are god will bless you you even see sometimes ministers will do that they will get in the pulpit now i'm getting preached on here they will get in the pulpit and make their voice real big i have now received my degree like it runs shivers over you i feel sorry for them people don't appreciate that just be yourself people will appreciate you more don't you believe that just be old plain sassafras hickory smoked ham sorghum molasses it'll do you good you won't put on but a pharisee oh i hate that word an actor some sisters do the same thing got a lot of acting about them oh they'll cut their husband's nose off john why do you do it that way just as snappy as they can be oh my phew god delivered me from ever calling on you if that's the kind of spirit you have but let someone talk on the telephone oh how do you do i'm so glad that you called actors just two minutes ago you were saying john why did you do that someone calls us how do you do i'm so glad you call actors shame on you house angels road devils putting on just be yourself all the time that's the best way to be don't you believe it sure you know how to take that then excuse me you know how we know how to take you then not actors not pharisees go to church on sunday and know how pious you are and on monday morning nobody could get along with you you pharisee what good does it do you to go to church about 60 years or 70 years ago here and i could preach that today just the same people coming in here even this church raising their hand praising the lord everything's fine on monday tuesday you wouldn't want to live with them you wouldn't want to be around them brother brown calls you a pharisee that's pretending you need to be real you need to hit an altar somewhere that's what you need my brother my sister you needed an altar and say lord take all that pretend putting on out of me don't let me come to church unless i come and come to the altar and die to this thing that's hurting other people and doing other things and lashing out and being somebody different being some kind of wild bear when you're out there and then acting like a christian on sunday mornings say god take that thing out of me that's being an actor and when i come to church and i lift my hands it's real it's not putting it on for everybody and putting it on to our children as well because see they see they know they see a mass can be also hiding sin in your life private personal pleasure and all the while you're holding that private personal pleasure that you give yourself permission to do it's a mask and all the while you can't go any deeper in the lord under this ministry it won't work you will feel more condemnation more and more as you come to church if you hide things if you put a mask on the title of my service tonight is this ministry this ministry of no veils no mask and i'm not talking about literal mask praise the lord i'll just give you a piece of advice before we close tonight about uh just ask yourself would i be able to do this thing or look at this in front of anyone in the body of christ right now including the pastor i'm challenging you tonight to take your mask off because in the christian life it's an accountable life to the holy spirit number one in the presence of the lord who's always present by the way there's nothing he don't see and when we're conscious of his presence brother bram says wherever we are he's there we'll live a different life we have the fear of the lord that his presence is near but just ask yourself if that's if that's not strong enough it should be but would i be able to do this or look at this in front of anybody in the body of christ right now including the pastor if not if you can't do that i'd stop doing it as soon as possible i'd stop it tonight because you're only deceiving yourself you're living under a mask you say well what a what about where paul talked about liberties and certain things we have faith to do well he's not talking about sin that's for sure but he said about that you may have something that you that you do and if it would offend a brother he says i wouldn't do that i wouldn't do that to offend another brother in the body of christ you see it's all about the body of christ accountability you don't live life to yourself your life is an open book you have to tell the whole world everything but listen we don't we don't have be a part of the body of christ and then we have a little private sins that we enjoy just doesn't work that way i'm encouraging us friends to take our mass down and live in the glory of the lord let me close this by saying tonight by by verse 18 3 18 but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same glory from the glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord everything you heard tonight i just want to sum it up by saying when israel turns to the lord the masks are taken away there's going to be liberty because where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty there's freedom and we can safely say also also that the mask limits the glory of god how many can say the veil or the mask limits the glory of god i can't imagine anyone here tonight that would want to limit the glory of god in your life but a veil does it those veils on israel's heart that it limits the glory of god from coming forth so that's why i preach on taking the veils down taking all religious veils down all private veils being open living an open life before him why it's not because i'm trying to get you to line up it's because when you have a veil on when you have a mask on it limits the glory of god and when you pull it down more of the glory of god comes in your life you think you're doing pretty good i'm telling you there's glories of the lord that come upon in your life and your family you haven't even seen yet but you've got to look into the face of the lord and say lord i'm all here and i'm looking in your face and here's another thing that it limits if you limit the glory of god in your life you limit being changed because what does the glory of god do it changes you it changes you it's really the only thing that can truly change you going through 10 steps of perfection by psychology doesn't really change you the real change comes when the glory of god is present he changes you why would anybody want to limit change in their life why would anybody want to limit the glory of god why would any musician why would any preacher want to limit the glory of god by wearing a mask i say when we come to church let's come fully open before the lord let every preacher be open and preach the word let him hold nothing back and when we come to a service may not one inch of the glory of the lord be limited to come in this service [Music] when you go home say god may this home that i have may this marriage that i have may none of it limit the glory of god from coming into my home let me be open lord let me honest sometimes you look in the very face of your wife and your husband maybe you're hiding things you look in their very face the one that you should love the most outside of the lord and you you're not you know someone sometimes that's lying they're looking another way they can't look in the face but when you're wanting to really get deliverance and really get freedom and see the glory of god come down you look and say honey i love you with all my heart i got this to confess you maybe you don't have nothing to confess but i'm open i'm not living any private life outside of you we are one where are some marriages like that we look into each other's eyes face to face there's nobody else but you nothing in this world matters but you looking at the lord that way lord nothing else matters but you there's no hidden secrets there's no closets there's no double life being lived here everything that i am all that i am i'm living for you and i'm standing here being honest with you look into my eyes and read that i'm being real with you and the last thing that i wanted to say he said when the glory of the lord is there that we are changed i love this from glory to glory to glory to glory now friends i'm a preacher who says that we don't just get everything one night at an altar and never come to god again i believe in a moment's time a person can have a conversion by the holy ghost but that bible many places reads like this we're changed and it's not just one night at altar we're changed from glory to glory to glory i'm telling you there's more glory there's more glory there's more of god for you and the more honest we get before the lord the more glory and the more change the more open we can be the more sins we can put underneath the blood the more habits that we can say god kill that thing that i never do it again the more we do that the more we go to another glory and another glory this is a growth this is a this is a growth this is not a one-night event and i know preachers preaching it one night then that's fine it's it's not a problem but there's too many scriptures when we're changed we're not just changed the first night in the soul we are but we got a flesh to deal with we got a spirit to deal with and from glory to glory to glory to glory by what looking in his face say lord i'm here i'm here to present myself to you i i i i wanna i wanna give everything to you i wanna i'm not hiding anything lord i'm gonna keep looking at your face when i open my bible in the morning or at night or whenever i'm looking in your face god change me by it let me get something today at church or this wednesday night that changes me to another glory don't let it be a waste of time but lord i'm here presenting myself to you you change me how many want to change how many want the glory of god whether we have to take the mask down mask limit the glory of god veils limit the glory of god even in the message mask to this day a mask or a veil or hiding something will limit the glory of god in this message you can go to a message church your entire life and miss the glory of god miss the change but we're transformed by the renewing of the mind day by day we're changed from glory to glory to glory when we say i am here lord to present myself to you and i know there's nothing more that i can do will you wash me and dress me in your righteousness until you're finally through i'll still come and present myself to you it's in the system somewhere i sang i wrote it 20 years ago it's probably when sister shannon was coming to our church 25 years ago i am here lord to present myself to you let's stand together [Music] and i know there's nothing more that i can do will you wash me and dress me in your chestness until [Music] i am here to present myself to you and i know there's nothing more that i can do [Music] will you wash me and dress me in your righteousness [Music] myself [Music] here i am again empty deep within sitting at the table of [Music] the hunger pains i feel bring me for another oh i am here lord to present myself to you can we just raise our hands just say lord i'm here and i know there's nothing more that i can will do wash me and dress me in your eyes till you're finally through [Music] one more time [Music] to present myself [Music] and i know there's nothing more that i can do [Music] [Music] change
