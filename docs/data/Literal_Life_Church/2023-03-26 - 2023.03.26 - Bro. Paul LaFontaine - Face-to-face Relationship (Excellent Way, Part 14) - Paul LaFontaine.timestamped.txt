[0:00] together
[0:03] and today I'm going to do my best to
[0:05] finish up this long series here on the
[0:07] more excellent way
[0:09] and I want to talk a little bit about
[0:10] moving into a face-to-face relationship
[0:13] with the lord it's the last part of
[0:15] First Corinthians 13 and if I don't get
[0:17] it finished tonight maybe I'll finish it
[0:18] Wednesday night but I'd like to wrap
[0:20] this series up on Divine love and one of
[0:24] the reasons I want to because there's
[0:25] just a host of things the Lord has
[0:27] impressed on my heart for the coming
[0:28] weeks as far as my part in preaching and
[0:33] so there's so many things he's opening
[0:35] up and I think you're going to be going
[0:38] to bring you great joy to see what the
[0:39] Lord's dropping in our hearts for the
[0:41] congregation so we want to get to those
[0:42] things so hopefully we can wrap some of
[0:44] these things up and conclude and give a
[0:46] climax to talking about Divine love I
[0:49] trust this has been a blessing to you to
[0:51] be able to look at this I think they
[0:52] have them on the YouTube channel and so
[0:54] you can listen to them again and also as
[0:56] I promised I'll be giving you a little
[0:58] handout of the notes and and the quotes
[1:01] and the scriptures that we've used
[1:03] throughout the whole series the
[1:04] PowerPoint that we used and so I'm a
[1:06] little slow at doing that stuff I'm
[1:07] technically challenged so I have my
[1:10] secretary and different ones get that
[1:11] done and hopefully in the next few weeks
[1:13] get that out to you because I did
[1:14] promise that to you first Corinthians 13
[1:16] at the end
[1:17] First Corinthians 13 at the very end and
[1:20] we're going to as I said try to conclude
[1:21] and wrap this subject up and it's very
[1:24] important what he says here at the end
[1:25] of first Corinthians 13 and last service
[1:28] we were dealing with verse 11 when I was
[1:31] a child so let's just step back into
[1:33] verse 9 and we'll catch the theme again
[1:36] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:39] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:41] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:44] done away it's a very very important
[1:47] thing so we we and he's talking about
[1:50] knowing god we know God with partial
[1:52] revelation
[1:54] we see him with partial Revelation and
[1:56] we prophesy with partial Revelation but
[1:59] when that which is perfect is come then
[2:02] that which is in part shall be done away
[2:04] and what he means by that that one day
[2:06] which I believe we're in that time uh we
[2:09] will come to a time that's not seeing
[2:11] Christ in a partial Revelation but a
[2:13] perfect revelation
[2:15] and that's prophesied for the end time
[2:17] this is Paul's prophecy hid when that
[2:19] which is perfect has come so aren't you
[2:21] happy this morning that you live in the
[2:23] time that we will see a perfect vision
[2:25] of Christ not just the partial
[2:27] revelation
[2:28] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[2:31] understood as a child I thought as a
[2:33] child but when I became a man I put away
[2:35] childish things for now we see through a
[2:39] glass Darkly and this is the scriptures
[2:41] I'll get to today for now we see through
[2:43] a glass Darkly but then face to face now
[2:48] I know in part in portion in in a
[2:51] partial Vision now I see a partial
[2:54] Vision but then but then shall I know
[2:57] even as also I am known we want to
[3:01] preach on these things today because
[3:02] what a great Revelation to see and to be
[3:05] known by him but not only will he we we
[3:09] are known by him but we will know him in
[3:12] his fullness he will know us and our
[3:14] fullness and we will know him in his
[3:16] fullness because it's a face-to-face
[3:18] relationship
[3:19] and now abided faith hope charity Divine
[3:24] love these three but the greatest of
[3:27] these is divine love amen father bless
[3:30] your word today and bless those Souls
[3:32] that have come today those that are
[3:33] listening online and we pray father you
[3:36] bless our time together bless the uh the
[3:38] the Bride As she meets around the world
[3:40] Lord under the five-fold ministry today
[3:43] wherever they may be feed your people
[3:45] Lord You're always faithful you stored
[3:47] up food for us Lord so that those who
[3:50] would come and are hungry gathered
[3:52] around the fresh carcass of God's word
[3:54] you'd have food for them in this hour to
[3:57] sustain us to give us strength to be
[3:59] help us to be able to make it through
[4:00] whatever trial we would come up Lord
[4:02] make it through this Dark World you put
[4:05] the things in place to feed us Lord and
[4:07] I prayed I'd be a vessel to give that to
[4:09] the people today we're looking to you we
[4:12] are confident Lord that you have done
[4:14] Mighty things and you will do great and
[4:16] mighty things in our hearts today we
[4:18] commit the service to you in in Jesus
[4:20] name amen God bless you may be seated we
[4:23] appreciate the meetings last weekend I
[4:26] can't uh I can't say too it's just
[4:29] incredible what the Lord spoke to us if
[4:30] you want to listen those are on the line
[4:32] as well many of you were here we had
[4:34] wonderful meetings with brother Craig
[4:35] Brewer I want to say thank you to the
[4:37] staff and all the sisters and helpers
[4:38] that helped Sister Miriam and all those
[4:40] in the kitchen you did a superb job
[4:42] thank you so much God rewards you for
[4:45] laboring it all went very smooth I asked
[4:47] Miriam and Boaz and it went just so
[4:48] smooth with all the help and all the
[4:50] millions of cookies that came in for the
[4:52] meetings I'm still eating some of those
[4:55] but we we thank you sisters you did a
[4:58] wonderful job helping us out and we know
[5:01] we were able to be a blessing to those
[5:02] visitors who came in for the special
[5:03] meetings we're we appreciate that so
[5:05] much tonight at five we'll be here for a
[5:08] hymns and classic sing-along and we've
[5:10] invited the community and different ones
[5:12] who want to come we're going to be
[5:13] singing some hymns Gideon will be
[5:14] leading in some worship and some other
[5:16] songs as well so we invite you to come
[5:18] out tonight at five o'clock we'll be
[5:19] doing
[5:20] so we want to just try to wrap up the
[5:23] last few verses of First Corinthians 13
[5:25] and if you're a Christian I'm sure
[5:27] you've studied the scripture and looked
[5:29] at these things we've enjoyed looking
[5:31] through the whole chapter as it has
[5:32] called it a bit of a window outside of
[5:35] the correction that Paul was given to
[5:36] the Corinthian Church who had leaned
[5:38] towards emotionalism and leaned towards
[5:40] prophecies and made such an emphasis on
[5:42] those things that Paul Wright in the
[5:45] middle of all of his correction to put
[5:46] the gifts in order and all that right in
[5:48] the middle of it he has this little
[5:49] window into the more excellent way he
[5:51] says he says that all these gifts covet
[5:54] the best gifts they're wonderful they're
[5:56] of God but yet I show unto you a more
[5:58] excellent way and then he breaks into
[6:00] what that more excellent way is and ends
[6:02] the chapter with the prophecy saying
[6:04] that we'll actually come to a more
[6:06] perfect way at the end time and when we
[6:09] see him in that way face to face we will
[6:11] the bride will come into this victory in
[6:13] Divine love how many believe that this
[6:15] morning so because it's a prophecy for
[6:18] our day then it becomes a very
[6:21] significant thing for us to look at and
[6:23] to realize and it would just like to
[6:25] talk about this face-to-face moving into
[6:28] a face-to-face relationship with Christ
[6:30] and I'll just say that it's really the
[6:32] only entrance into this excellent way
[6:34] how many would raise your hand and say I
[6:36] if God said I could live in this victory
[6:38] in Divine love and live in this more
[6:40] excellent way I mean raise your hands I
[6:42] want to live there every day
[6:43] and so Paul shows us the entrance to
[6:46] this more excellent way is a
[6:48] face-to-face relationship with Christ
[6:50] not a partial and when he uses the term
[6:53] we see through a glass Darkly it's a
[6:56] symbol it's a it's a word picture to
[6:58] show us uh it could be a mirror it could
[7:00] be uh looking through a window that's
[7:02] clouded uh if I had an example this
[7:04] morning I have a window and so it's
[7:06] nothing worse than trying to look
[7:07] through a Windows see something clearly
[7:08] and it's it's clouded with something
[7:10] something sprayed on it and so you have
[7:12] a partial vision of who's behind the
[7:14] window you can see it's Jesus you can
[7:16] see a works of Jesus you can see
[7:19] someone's back there but you never can
[7:21] sear it perfectly clearly and he says
[7:24] throughout Seven Ages we've seen through
[7:26] a glass Darkly Christ has done things
[7:29] he's manifested his power we know it's
[7:31] Christ behind there but we we or
[7:33] prophecies is seeing him in part we're
[7:36] living at a level of seeing him in part
[7:38] but there's a a more powerful
[7:40] relationship coming to the church at the
[7:42] end time that we don't see him through a
[7:44] glass Darkly but we see him face to face
[7:47] and that changes everything can you say
[7:49] Amen
[7:50] and so um we've talked in First
[7:52] Corinthians 13 I don't have to rehearse
[7:54] this too much but we we've talked about
[7:55] this more excellent way of divine love
[7:57] and he wraps it up with growing out of
[7:59] our childhood spiritually childishness
[8:02] spiritually is depending too much on
[8:04] temporal manifestations of God that's
[8:07] why he says when I was a child I spake
[8:09] as a child I I did things I thought as a
[8:11] child but when I became a man I put away
[8:13] childish things in other words
[8:15] spiritually speaking you can't stay a
[8:17] child spiritually and a child
[8:20] spiritually would put his his emphasis
[8:22] too much on temporal things prophecies
[8:26] they'll fail these other tongues they
[8:28] shall cease and so don't put all the
[8:31] emphasis on that because you see that's
[8:33] temporal but Divine love is eternal
[8:37] so if we had all that but we missed
[8:40] Divine love we're missed an important
[8:41] the most important thing and so this is
[8:44] great mature teaching to the church and
[8:47] uh so we're not growing uh in Victory in
[8:50] Divine love if we're living on temporal
[8:52] manifestations of God or depending too
[8:54] much on manifestations of God that are
[8:56] temporal we're not growing in Divine
[8:58] love and and people can do that all of
[9:01] us can do that so also spiritual
[9:03] childness is getting puffed up with the
[9:06] gifts with the sacrifices he said though
[9:08] I give to the poor and have not love I
[9:11] am nothing so it's giving to the poor
[9:13] though I understand all Mysteries and
[9:15] have not love it is nothing though I can
[9:18] prophesy though I can have faith to
[9:20] remove mountains he's basically covering
[9:23] all the manifestations of the true
[9:24] church
[9:26] and yet he says if I had that and didn't
[9:28] have this it would mean nothing
[9:31] it's a pretty powerful statement
[9:32] so we got to make sure that our emphasis
[9:35] and what we reach towards is something
[9:37] to grow into mature of the maturity of
[9:40] divine love and not depending and I'll
[9:42] say this again the tendency and
[9:44] childishness is to get puffed up with
[9:46] the gift I've got my gift I've got one
[9:49] of the nine spiritual gifts or
[9:50] sacrifices you make you get puffed up
[9:52] with it or or not growing into the
[9:55] humility of this Divine love someone's
[9:57] growing more in Pride than they are
[9:59] humility there's something wrong with a
[10:01] Christian who's growing more in Pride
[10:03] with the message than growing in
[10:05] humility because if he's meeting Christ
[10:07] face to face he's coming into more
[10:09] humility
[10:10] and now we watch it not only outside but
[10:13] in our own ranks as someone someone's
[10:15] gift gets lifted up whether it's
[10:16] preaching or prophecy or someone gets
[10:19] lifted up to or something and they
[10:20] personally get lifted up this is my gift
[10:22] this is what I do and they get lifted up
[10:25] in Pride and lose their humility there's
[10:27] something wrong with that because that
[10:28] becomes child it stays childish they're
[10:31] depending on their gift when I leave
[10:33] this platform this morning I go back to
[10:35] my life in Christ I go back to
[10:37] surrendering in private just like I do
[10:39] in public my gift can work this morning
[10:41] if anybody has a gift singing or
[10:43] preaching or whatever gift it is your
[10:45] gift will work if you yield yourself but
[10:48] I gotta live the Sanctified life when I
[10:50] leave this Pulpit I can preach and you
[10:52] can enjoy it and compliments he like the
[10:54] anointing was upon me and the Lord comes
[10:56] on and that's wonderful but I could live
[10:58] in Pride off of I must be okay because
[11:01] my gift went well and people are
[11:03] praising me
[11:05] but everything that I see in scripture
[11:07] me showing the character of Christ is
[11:10] that anybody who is extremely gifted
[11:12] including prophets whenever they were
[11:15] pushed by the people to lift themselves
[11:16] up they always dispelled it and said no
[11:19] don't do that they stayed humble with
[11:21] their gift they wanted to make
[11:22] themselves not popular when the people
[11:24] were trying to make them popular
[11:26] everything I see there's no popular
[11:28] people there's no Superstars there's no
[11:31] Divas in the kingdom of God can I get an
[11:33] amen this morning
[11:35] everyone all the way through Joseph got
[11:38] lifted up to the throne Daniel got
[11:40] lifted up to the throne but every time
[11:42] it starts to people start to praise they
[11:43] said don't praise me praise the god
[11:46] who's using me
[11:48] that's what we need to see in musicians
[11:50] and singers and big preachers we need to
[11:53] see one key element more humility of
[11:55] Christ and then the Bible says Jesus he
[11:59] says he says let this mind be in you
[12:02] which was also in Christ Jesus who
[12:04] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[12:06] God but yet made himself of no
[12:10] reputation
[12:12] he intentionally
[12:15] made himself of no reputation how many
[12:17] members of the places in the Bible where
[12:18] he did a miracle and told the person
[12:20] don't go tell nobody about this
[12:23] how many preachers do you have like that
[12:27] something great happens and they lay
[12:28] hands under somebody and they want the
[12:31] whole world to hear it well Jesus wasn't
[12:32] that way for a long time it's not my
[12:34] time yet don't tell anybody what
[12:36] happened
[12:38] that's humility
[12:39] he wasn't promoting and putting out his
[12:43] ministry he was actually trying to
[12:45] decrease it
[12:48] and not too many amens on that but
[12:50] that's the that's the character in
[12:51] Scripture
[12:53] and we should look for that in preachers
[12:54] in singers in anybody who's who's who's
[12:58] raising because sometimes a gift will
[13:00] raise and be greatly used but we better
[13:03] be seeing the character of humility
[13:04] coming out of it
[13:07] and then there's a tendency to have a
[13:08] religious spirit instead of the real
[13:10] spirit and get lifted up in Pride the
[13:12] gift instead of the character of The
[13:14] Giver is emphasized shouting is what he
[13:18] does and ignoring who he is in other
[13:21] words shouting over what God does and
[13:24] ignoring who Jesus is is a great
[13:27] immaturity
[13:29] is this okay with everybody
[13:32] so when the the scripture says here in
[13:34] First Corinthians we prophesy in part in
[13:37] part of course it means partial
[13:38] Revelation partial vision of Jesus and
[13:42] and Paul says God will move us to a
[13:45] perfect Revelation not a partial
[13:46] Revelation but a perfect Revelation from
[13:49] the part to the perfect to Perfection
[13:51] and the opening of the seals at the end
[13:54] time I believe is very much a part if
[13:56] not a significant part of this
[13:58] Perfection that we come to that opening
[14:00] of the seals in 1963 as a part of coming
[14:04] into that Perfection and coming into
[14:07] that more excellent way it's not the
[14:09] it's not the whole thing and and so so
[14:12] you don't think I'm being disrespectful
[14:13] I just want to explain this I believe it
[14:15] was Benjamin Franklin uh the prophet
[14:17] said that he invented and he found
[14:19] electricity he found there was another
[14:22] source there that they couldn't be seen
[14:23] before so he finds it and he said I got
[14:26] it I got it I got it I got it and
[14:28] brother says but he didn't really know
[14:29] what he had but he had something
[14:33] I got it I got it I got it yeah this is
[14:35] great but he didn't know what he had
[14:37] until later on uh another one comes
[14:40] Thomas Edison comes around and he
[14:42] harnesses what he discovered he
[14:45] harnesses it to make it work
[14:47] I tell you we need a church on the rise
[14:49] can you say man that not just makes the
[14:52] seals and the opening of the word just
[14:54] Doctrine but how to live it every day
[14:56] how to make it work in faith can you say
[14:58] Amen
[15:00] for years this feel I feel like there's
[15:02] so many conventions as we got it we got
[15:04] it we're the bride we got it but you've
[15:06] got to find a heart you've got to
[15:07] harness that into an everyday life
[15:12] praise the Lord you may have something
[15:14] and you know what I'll tell you when you
[15:15] have the perfect word come to you you do
[15:18] have something
[15:19] but it doesn't mean the Perfection has
[15:21] come to you yet
[15:23] personally
[15:25] see he's not just he's not just bringing
[15:27] a perfect word which he has but he's
[15:29] bringing his people to Perfection and
[15:31] maturity and remember when Jesus said be
[15:33] therefore perfect it didn't mean
[15:34] Flawless or or something like that in
[15:38] the flesh it meant growth to maturity
[15:41] that's what he meant I said be perfect
[15:42] as your father's and it's growth to
[15:44] maturity if we're not growing in the
[15:46] word and in the vision we see of Christ
[15:48] then that we're not going anywhere and
[15:50] so that's what he wants to take his
[15:51] people to perfection
[15:53] I got it I got it I got it but he didn't
[15:56] know what he had we need to know what we
[15:58] have but not just praise and worship and
[16:00] Shout over what we have and that maybe
[16:02] we're better than everybody else get rid
[16:04] of all that I've I've got something I
[16:06] said but let the Holy Spirit take what
[16:08] you got and bring you to a perfection in
[16:11] it
[16:11] is that okay with everybody
[16:14] so what what we are what we are called
[16:16] to in this present time what are we
[16:18] called to living in
[16:20] understand
[16:22] Vine love as our motive for everything
[16:26] that we do
[16:28] living in a more perfect understanding
[16:31] of him is what Paul's saying living in a
[16:34] more perfect understanding of him
[16:36] with Divine love is the motive for
[16:38] everything that we do every gift
[16:40] everything that we do every every
[16:42] reaction to people we've been preaching
[16:43] this everything that comes in life every
[16:45] trial if we're in that realm of divine
[16:48] love then our reaction is divine love
[16:50] and that's because we have a perfect
[16:52] understanding or we're growing into a
[16:54] perfect understanding of who Christ is
[16:56] we're wanting that to work through our
[16:58] lives if we and listen now if we don't
[17:02] have distinctions from the rest of
[17:04] churches in in our character then we are
[17:07] really like the rest
[17:14] and sometimes we can put down the other
[17:16] churches and I don't think that's right
[17:18] either
[17:21] say well we're different we're better
[17:23] we're you know we have we're better than
[17:25] denominations we're better than these
[17:27] other churches well let's see the
[17:29] character of Christ
[17:31] because the distinctions isn't that you
[17:33] have a building or that you have good
[17:34] music or that you have good preachers
[17:36] the distinction the distinction there
[17:38] has to be a further distinction is
[17:40] Christ himself living in the people
[17:45] Jesus said something interesting in
[17:46] Matthew 5 he said for if we love them if
[17:50] ye love them that love you what reward
[17:53] have ye do not even the publicans the
[17:56] same
[17:58] so he's saying that you know if you have
[18:00] the same characteristics of only loving
[18:03] those that you want to love and you're
[18:05] selective in your love then you're
[18:06] really not any different than the rest
[18:08] of people
[18:09] Jesus is teaching it I'm not
[18:11] and then he says and if you salute or
[18:14] greet your brethren only what do you eat
[18:17] more than others the publicans do the
[18:20] same they have their Clique they have
[18:22] their Clan and they greet one another
[18:23] and kind of ditch everybody else we're
[18:25] the elite group and he says if you're
[18:27] doing that amongst yourself as Brethren
[18:29] you're really not much different in
[18:31] character than what they are
[18:35] praise the Lord
[18:36] I'm always safe when I'm teaching what
[18:38] Jesus said
[18:40] can you say man because you if you're a
[18:42] Believer you have to say amen and Jesus
[18:44] said you better watch it because you'll
[18:46] get amongst yourself and then you become
[18:48] partial you become selective you become
[18:50] I got my own group here and so now your
[18:53] love becomes selective to your only your
[18:55] friends can you say Amen
[18:57] I used to say it this way you invite
[18:59] so-and-so your real friend over and you
[19:01] serve them steak and the other people
[19:03] you're a little leery of but maybe
[19:04] you'll have them over and you have them
[19:05] over hot dogs
[19:11] your attitude towards them is showing up
[19:13] and we don't have to a right to be
[19:15] respecter of persons like that
[19:17] the worst looking sinner the worst
[19:19] looking person the person that's Bound
[19:21] by all kinds of things I have to catch
[19:23] myself all the time because I have the
[19:25] Holy Spirit of God the same Holy Spirit
[19:26] the prophet had same one the Lord had
[19:28] when we look at this world it's falling
[19:30] apart every day in the news we're seeing
[19:32] this gender thing raised to the top of
[19:34] the news it's infiltrating our company
[19:36] our country and our children can you say
[19:39] Amen I'm greatly concerned and it puts a
[19:41] a something when I see this Spirit of
[19:44] homosexuality in the spirit of mixing
[19:46] genders it just turns my stomach there's
[19:49] something in there that Grieves my heart
[19:50] and I'm glad it Grieves can you say man
[19:53] but in my attitude I have to be careful
[19:55] that I don't put that person in a
[19:57] category with all those tattoos on and
[19:59] all those things on because you know
[20:01] have they had a chance to hear the
[20:02] gospel yet
[20:04] have they have the chances that you have
[20:06] which we've become spoiled with it
[20:08] living in the presence of God our young
[20:10] people become spoiled they take it for
[20:11] granted that the presence of the Lord is
[20:13] here
[20:15] but don't you dare criticize that person
[20:17] in your heart when you don't know if
[20:18] they've heard the gospel can you say
[20:20] Amen we don't have a right to be
[20:22] selective with the love of God or with
[20:24] the message that we have we have to give
[20:27] it to everybody can you say that
[20:30] we can't come into this if you salute
[20:32] your brother not only why do you're not
[20:34] doing anything any different than the
[20:36] others do not even the publicans and
[20:38] then his next script next thing he says
[20:40] is be therefore perfect even as your
[20:43] father which is in heaven is perfect
[20:45] it's the next scripture
[20:47] so he's talking about partiality he's
[20:50] talking about you you religious people
[20:53] are are kind of really the same and
[20:55] that's why I'm talking about
[20:56] distinctions we think we're we make
[20:58] ourselves so different but why are we
[21:00] different are we different because we
[21:02] dress different that's not the whole
[21:04] picture
[21:07] are we different because uh you know
[21:10] because of uh uh believing the prophet
[21:13] well you know now that's not all of our
[21:15] distinction
[21:17] so Jesus is trying to if you're in
[21:19] character acting like them and that
[21:21] that's the way the publicans function
[21:23] and really that's the way being there
[21:25] for perfect even is your father which is
[21:27] in heaven is perfect in other words
[21:28] we're moving out of that that selective
[21:31] love we're moving out of that partiality
[21:33] we're moving out of that that thing that
[21:36] is a respecter of persons if that's
[21:39] working amongst the kingdom of God and
[21:41] the people of God then it's not the
[21:42] maturity of divine love yet
[21:46] what do ye more than others how are you
[21:48] different than denominations when we say
[21:50] we have the only way when we say we have
[21:53] the only way now there's no other way
[21:54] through than through our way how are we
[21:56] any different than a denomination
[22:00] the word is the way the word is the only
[22:03] way
[22:04] but when we get selected to say you only
[22:06] have to come through our group it's not
[22:08] because of our group or our movement
[22:10] it's because the word can you say it the
[22:12] word is the only Christ is the only way
[22:15] don't forget that but when we say you
[22:17] have to come through our church doors or
[22:19] through our Doctrine to be saved how are
[22:22] we any different than the denominations
[22:29] when we have competition amongst
[22:31] ministers how are we any different than
[22:33] anyone else
[22:34] and talking about amongst the ministers
[22:36] who has the premium ministry that's what
[22:38] I heard recently is that there's a
[22:40] discussion about who the premium
[22:42] Ministry is in the message
[22:46] and I'm not leaving all Minister I'm
[22:48] just saying that some of the that's some
[22:49] of the terms that are used
[22:51] who has the greatest gift who's the next
[22:53] up and coming gift
[22:55] who's the next up and coming Church
[22:58] I am so weary of all this
[23:01] and you know why I am because I'm
[23:02] looking into the face of Christ and I
[23:04] don't see any of that there I don't see
[23:06] any of it there it's too denominational
[23:09] competition and and who's this and who's
[23:13] that and who's the next up-and-coming
[23:14] Church Jesus is saying when we do all
[23:17] this just as the rest of them then
[23:19] there's no distinction thus there's not
[23:21] moving into the fathers we're not moving
[23:22] into the father's Perfection what we
[23:25] wear or what we teach or the sign on the
[23:28] door or the fellowship that we have if
[23:31] that's the only distinctions that sets
[23:33] us apart something's wrong
[23:38] those are all part of it but when that
[23:41] becomes the distinction of what makes us
[23:43] different
[23:44] Jesus said by this shall all men know
[23:48] that you are my disciples
[23:51] by your love one for another
[23:53] he made the distinction
[23:55] not by what we wear
[23:59] not by we have a different teaching okay
[24:02] not by that but the distinction will
[24:05] come to down to the word of God and
[24:07] divine love the word preached untainted
[24:10] the word preached unveiled to the people
[24:13] how many enjoyed last weekend to just
[24:15] hear the message preach untainted pure
[24:17] can you say Amen no agendas to it I so
[24:20] appreciate that about brother Craig it
[24:21] was just so wonderful and we're we're
[24:23] blessed we ought to say Thank You Lord
[24:25] that I can enjoy that thank you Lord
[24:27] that I can enjoy preaching like that and
[24:29] so what we wear or what we teach or the
[24:32] sign on the door is not our distinction
[24:35] Satan's no respecter of the sign on the
[24:38] church
[24:40] God is no respecter of the sign on the
[24:43] church
[24:45] so it's love for one another that's the
[24:47] difference we would tend to praise the
[24:49] gifts and the success based on other
[24:51] things and when you do it becomes about
[24:54] you or your church then it's no longer
[24:57] about him it's about your church and
[24:59] it's about you
[25:01] when that is present no matter what
[25:03] church or preacher
[25:05] says it including me
[25:08] when that is presented that way our
[25:11] vision of Christ is becoming impaired
[25:15] it's still Limited
[25:17] it's seen through a glass Darkly
[25:21] a glass Darkly when we have God doing
[25:24] things through the seven Church ages and
[25:26] these pulses we see through a glass
[25:28] Darkly now showing gifts showing wisdom
[25:30] showing the supernatural praise God all
[25:32] the manifestations of God for seven
[25:34] Church ages but he says still we're
[25:36] still seeing Christ through a glass
[25:38] Darkly even though all these
[25:39] manifestations of God has happened and
[25:42] are still happening I praise God for it
[25:44] but we're still only seeing him through
[25:46] a glass Darkly seeing him through a
[25:48] cloudy glass at its very best and then
[25:50] because we can't completely see him we
[25:53] start to get off track to other things
[25:55] other than him be ye Perfect by the holy
[25:59] ghost moving into you that's what that
[26:02] means that growth to Perfection be ye
[26:05] perfect means by the Holy Ghost we move
[26:08] into something deeper than uh the
[26:11] denominational Creeds has to offer
[26:17] we are different brother Paul we have
[26:19] the seals we have the Mysteries
[26:21] but what if all the fruits that comes
[26:25] from it still has divisions of
[26:27] denomination
[26:28] have we reached the Perfection yet
[26:33] we have not moved to Perfection just
[26:35] because God has given us a perfect word
[26:41] we have not moved to Perfection just
[26:44] because God has blessed us with the
[26:47] perfect word
[26:51] but we have the right thing to look at
[26:56] we have the right Vision to look at we
[26:59] have the right vision of Christ to look
[27:01] at so that it can change us and that we
[27:04] can move into more Divine love can you
[27:06] say Amen we haven't reached Perfection
[27:08] because we have God has given us the
[27:10] perfect word by Divine Vindication he
[27:13] has given us that and I'm going to read
[27:14] that quote to you in a minute if I get
[27:15] to it we have that that perfect
[27:18] interpretation by Divine Vindication
[27:20] we're blessed with that but you see now
[27:22] just because we have that doesn't mean
[27:24] that we have moved to Perfection but we
[27:27] have praise God this morning we have the
[27:30] right thing to be looking at it if you
[27:32] look at the right thing and look at this
[27:34] vision of Christ
[27:36] God will change you from glory to glory
[27:43] we see through a glass Darkly and it's
[27:46] that means it's an imperfect view of
[27:49] Christ but when he starts removing the
[27:51] Veil uncovering The Book of Revelation
[27:53] means unveiling Revelation means
[27:55] unveiling he begins cleaning the glass
[27:57] whatever you want to call it when it's
[27:59] it's not just that we become greater
[28:02] intellectually when God does that than
[28:04] the rest of the churches when he starts
[28:06] unveiling it's to bring something deeper
[28:08] in our lives Christ The Mystery of God
[28:11] revealed Christ in you the hope of glory
[28:15] and so when he unveils it's not just to
[28:19] make us smarter than everybody else it's
[28:21] not to give us more Pride but it's to
[28:23] bring more of the mystery of Christ in
[28:25] your own life manifested every day
[28:27] that's what he sends it for so you can
[28:29] see Christ clearly and when you see
[28:32] Christ clearly in Perfection then God
[28:34] can transform you in your life
[28:37] say well what's my problem brother Paul
[28:38] you're probably looking at other things
[28:40] more than you're looking into the word
[28:44] foreign
[28:46] and I say that as a as a conviction to
[28:48] my own life we are so busy we are so
[28:50] distracted we have so many
[28:52] responsibilities how much time is spent
[28:54] looking in the word of God because
[28:55] that's how we see this picture the word
[28:57] the message can you say Amen we see
[28:59] another portion of Christ how much are
[29:01] we given to do that because that's the
[29:03] thing Satan makes us Overlook it Satan
[29:06] makes it he puts uh he he taints the
[29:08] message he makes people afraid of the
[29:10] message and he does that for a reason
[29:11] because the power is looking into that
[29:14] character of Christ through the word and
[29:16] we catch something
[29:18] Satan does not want that to happen
[29:21] you become a Powerhouse for the kingdom
[29:23] of God
[29:24] so we might be looking at the wrong
[29:26] thing can I have an amen this morning
[29:28] it might be looking too much instead of
[29:31] into the message and into your Bible
[29:32] amen but when when he starts unveiling
[29:36] and uncovering it's more than just to
[29:38] make us a greater intellectual
[29:40] Church than the other churches then I
[29:42] will know him as he knows me this is the
[29:44] final thought in that Paul ends and I'm
[29:47] trying to make it a final thought too
[29:48] this is what he ends on is that I when I
[29:51] see him face to face then I will know
[29:54] him as he knows me
[29:57] I'm gonna elaborate on that in a minute
[29:59] this is the final thought Paul brings in
[30:01] this a full knowing a full knowing of
[30:06] Christ and Christ fully knowing you now
[30:10] that's a given that he knows us
[30:13] there's two main revelations in a
[30:16] Christian Life that a Christian that a
[30:17] Believer needs and uh these things are
[30:20] Beyond any gift or Beyond any knowledge
[30:22] Beyond physical healing by the atonement
[30:25] of Jesus Christ this is deeper and first
[30:28] of all we need a revelation that he
[30:30] knows us
[30:34] he knows me
[30:36] He Knows My Name
[30:38] I have a maker he knows he knows my
[30:42] every thought you say well why are you
[30:44] saying this because there are people
[30:46] that even intend church and they don't
[30:47] realize God knows you inside and out
[30:52] let me say it this way God does not have
[30:54] a partial revelation of you
[30:59] he doesn't see you through a glass
[31:02] Darkly even though there are some people
[31:05] that would like God to be looking at
[31:07] them through a glass Darkly because they
[31:09] can hide some things
[31:11] but God does not see you in your life
[31:15] and your past he doesn't see you through
[31:18] a glass Darkly he knows you 100
[31:21] completely
[31:24] he knows what you've done and then the
[31:26] power of forgiveness that God forgive me
[31:28] I put that under your blood then he
[31:29] forgets that he can't remember it
[31:31] anymore boy that's the love of God
[31:34] praise God that's the love of God and
[31:38] when I talk about him knowing you then
[31:40] transfer it over us knowing him because
[31:42] when we have a face to face like he has
[31:45] a face and sees your whole life the love
[31:47] of God kicks in it must because he says
[31:50] if you'll repent and bring that Pastor
[31:52] under the blood I can't see that anymore
[31:55] that pass over can you say Amen talk
[31:57] about a complete picture of you
[32:01] he doesn't see you through a glass
[32:02] Darkly he sees you
[32:04] face to face he sees everything that you
[32:07] are
[32:08] amen
[32:10] so that's the first part in a Christian
[32:12] is coming to and you would like to be
[32:14] able to say that all of the Believers
[32:17] and everybody everybody sees how much
[32:19] God knows them but a lot of people think
[32:22] they still have a private life
[32:25] that they're hiding from God they're
[32:27] even in the message and they have a
[32:29] little secret thing that they do
[32:32] it's not healthy it's wearing out
[32:34] spiritually and but they're going to
[32:36] hold on to that because that's my little
[32:38] private world
[32:40] all the time thinking when nobody at the
[32:42] church sees it the pastor I'm really
[32:44] glad he don't see it
[32:46] and then you buy into this thing that
[32:48] God doesn't see it guess what
[32:52] I hate to be the messenger of bad news
[32:55] God sees everything
[32:58] he's seen what you looked at last night
[33:00] on your phone
[33:02] every detail he's an infinite God he
[33:05] knows all things from the end of the
[33:08] beginning he knows he sees it
[33:13] why does this need to be a revelation
[33:15] before the revelation of seeing Christ
[33:17] clearly because you need to know that
[33:19] God knows you and there's nothing that
[33:20] you can hide from God this morning in
[33:22] church and it gets a little bit more
[33:24] exposing when you're in church because
[33:25] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[33:27] and intents of the heart I'm preaching
[33:29] with that word this morning and that
[33:30] Holy Ghost is upon me and it could I
[33:33] don't know you but it could say anything
[33:34] right now that exactly pegs exactly what
[33:37] you're doing
[33:38] there was a mom that come to me and says
[33:40] thank you for two or three weeks ago so
[33:42] that when you talk to the young people
[33:43] and just give them a little warning
[33:45] about what they're looking at she said
[33:46] thank you she said because God dealt
[33:48] with me the Wednesday before of the same
[33:50] thing and her and her husband just the
[33:52] same thing and I said that's just the
[33:54] whole Holy Spirit not just speaking
[33:55] through the preachers but he's speaking
[33:56] through the mothers the fathers if we're
[33:59] in tune with him he's going to drop
[34:00] things in our hearts can you say Amen
[34:02] the word is a discerner he's not going
[34:05] to let things just happen under the
[34:06] current he's going to expose it when you
[34:08] come to church and I don't know if I
[34:09] like this going to church because it's
[34:11] too exposing yes because he's here and
[34:13] he knows you
[34:15] Paula Fontaine doesn't know you unless
[34:17] you share something but he knows every
[34:19] detail of your life this morning
[34:21] and yet and yet he has unlimited love
[34:25] for you
[34:28] he loves he knows you here's the song
[34:31] Gloria Gaither wrote the one who knows
[34:33] you the most loves you the most
[34:35] the one who knows me the most loves me
[34:39] the most
[34:40] that's a revelation
[34:42] knows everything and his love will never
[34:44] give up his love will never stop for you
[34:47] it doesn't give out can you say man it's
[34:49] not like us it's partial Revelation you
[34:52] know what I've dealt with this person 20
[34:54] years they're still doing that
[34:56] I'm finished
[34:59] that's not the words of Christ
[35:00] not for a son of God not for a daughter
[35:03] of God
[35:04] you're bucking up and Rebellion all
[35:07] those years and you keep trying to
[35:08] question things and you'll never ever
[35:11] get away from the love of God you'll
[35:14] never get away from it
[35:18] you see when I talk about these things
[35:19] and how he looks at us
[35:21] I pray you're transferred over now that
[35:23] when we're really looking clearly at his
[35:26] face
[35:28] it should bring this Divine love
[35:31] that we look at we won't look at God or
[35:34] one another with a partial revelation
[35:38] but with the full picture
[35:40] that's what happened with the woman
[35:42] they'd found in adultery they threw her
[35:43] down using the law and say okay we found
[35:45] her this is it and then Jesus says let
[35:47] him that's without sin cast the first
[35:49] stone what's he doing the love of God is
[35:51] actually expanding their Vision because
[35:53] all they see is through a glass Darkly
[35:56] but Jesus is looking at the whole
[35:58] picture
[35:59] okay and that's why he can offer
[36:01] something else because he's looking at a
[36:04] predestinated daughter of God he's
[36:05] looking at the potential of what she can
[36:08] be because why he 100 there's no partial
[36:11] revelation of that woman down the ground
[36:13] they're ready to Stone God doesn't see a
[36:15] partial Revelation or they see a partial
[36:17] Revelation and they're judging her based
[36:19] upon her acts and they caught her in the
[36:22] act but you cannot have the Divine love
[36:25] of God and judged by a partial
[36:27] revelation of anybody else you must say
[36:29] God help me to understand and see the
[36:33] whole picture
[36:34] and let your love motivate me
[36:39] so we this Revelation which I may only
[36:42] get time on this this morning is the
[36:43] Revelation that God knows everything
[36:46] about you
[36:48] your ins and outs your ups and downs
[36:50] your life your story your your past your
[36:54] present your personality talking about
[36:57] this with the brothers a little bit on
[36:58] Thursday nights you know Satan God knows
[37:01] you completely he knows how you take he
[37:03] knows your bench he knows your
[37:04] weaknesses but Satan has studied you
[37:07] and how you tick how to tempt you
[37:11] so both of these have the had long
[37:14] studies in you
[37:16] and I tell the brothers but you won't
[37:18] take the time
[37:19] to study it as much as Satan does
[37:22] you won't figure out you
[37:24] and your weaknesses and how Satan can
[37:26] get you
[37:28] how your mind works
[37:31] praise the Lord
[37:33] so he knows you this morning and he
[37:35] knows everything about you and he you
[37:37] can't hide that from him you think
[37:39] you're hiding it on your phone you think
[37:41] you're hiding it in private you think
[37:43] you're hiding on your computer but I'm
[37:44] here to tell you you're not hiding
[37:46] anything from him
[37:48] he sees every detail of your life that's
[37:52] why he probably said he's grieved
[37:53] sometimes even with a brother sister
[37:55] with the Holy Ghost he just gets grieved
[37:58] from the season he's his love is never
[38:00] going to end but his spirit is grieved
[38:04] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[38:06] you're sealed until the day of your
[38:08] Redemption
[38:09] Paul teaching that shows us that we as
[38:11] Holy Ghost Christians can grieve the
[38:14] Holy Spirit doesn't mean he doesn't love
[38:15] us doesn't mean he's giving up on us but
[38:17] he just he just just he's grieved by
[38:20] what you're looking at
[38:23] the reason you do it the reason I
[38:25] anybody would do it is because you feel
[38:27] like there's certain places rooms
[38:30] quietness dirty little secrets there's
[38:34] certain things that are not under the
[38:36] visibility of God and that such a lie
[38:40] he sees it all and he's and he he's
[38:44] already has a plan and a word in place
[38:47] for your life
[38:49] you're going to keep going down that
[38:50] road
[38:51] you're my son
[38:53] I have a plan already for you
[38:56] and you can buck up against it you can
[38:58] resist it but if you're a son you'll
[39:01] come hard
[39:01] you come easy I've said this for Years
[39:03] brother Mark probably back in my church
[39:05] years ago remember if you're a son
[39:07] daughter God you either come hard or you
[39:09] come easy but you're coming because all
[39:11] the father hath given me will come
[39:14] what does that Force
[39:16] demanding No Love
[39:19] unconditional love that's what it is
[39:24] so he knows every detail of your life
[39:26] maybe that'll help somebody live
[39:28] different this week in their privacy
[39:32] can't hide it from God he knows you
[39:33] inside and out and yet yet when he looks
[39:36] at our lives and sees our weaknesses and
[39:38] sees our mistakes
[39:40] he would give up except for he sees the
[39:43] whole thing which means he seemed a
[39:45] predestinated seed of God
[39:48] oh if we could all look at one another
[39:50] that way
[39:52] if we could all have that kind of divine
[39:55] looking
[39:57] but he sees and I'm so glad he's seen me
[39:59] that way beauty is in the eyes of
[40:01] beholder
[40:04] and he sees me for who I really am
[40:08] and so his love now looks at me and
[40:11] there's not anything I can hide
[40:13] let me finish that this part with this
[40:16] and we become very aware of it when God
[40:20] used a prophet with a prophetic gift
[40:23] to to discern secrets in people's hearts
[40:27] visibly the word can do it
[40:30] but with the prophet it's more vocal on
[40:32] the platform through the prayer lines
[40:34] and all of a sudden everybody realized
[40:36] oh you say well I wish those days can
[40:37] come back he's here to still hear the
[40:39] Holy Spirit but if you'd have been in
[40:41] brother bradham's meetings then you
[40:43] gotta you got a real taste of being in
[40:46] an atmosphere where at any moment God
[40:48] could show that profit of vision and
[40:50] show you in a doctor's office 10 years
[40:53] ago and describe it perfectly with the
[40:55] sign on the door and what the doctor
[40:57] said to you
[40:59] he knows all things
[41:01] or he could tell you what you looked at
[41:03] or what you've seen last night and being
[41:06] in that present everybody realizes we're
[41:08] not in the presence of Paul LaFontaine
[41:10] we're not in the presence of William
[41:11] Branham
[41:14] there's no man William Branham even that
[41:16] could do that on his own
[41:19] God worked him to show us the bride this
[41:22] revelation God knows your house number
[41:24] God knows your life God know which who
[41:27] knows what you did last night God knows
[41:29] what you did two weeks ago God knows
[41:31] you're text what you tell God knows it
[41:33] all and we got this jolting said oh God
[41:36] I can't hide anything from you I'm an
[41:38] open book I'm laid bare before you Lord
[41:42] and and it should bring a surrender to
[41:44] say if somebody knows me that well and
[41:47] still loves me then I'm going to give my
[41:49] life to someone like that
[41:52] is this okay with everybody
[41:54] so the Revelation that he knows us he
[41:57] knows us and yet he loves us yet there's
[42:00] something reaching out in his heart to
[42:02] to look at us with the whole picture of
[42:04] a predestinated son and daughter of God
[42:06] and so now there's the two knowings that
[42:09] in a Christian Life is number one and
[42:12] when the son of man was
[42:14] manifested this day showing he showed us
[42:17] he knows everything about us knows our
[42:19] house number knows where we live He
[42:21] Knows My Name he knows my every thought
[42:24] I have a maker can you say amen he knows
[42:27] my name he knows my heart he knows my
[42:30] every thought
[42:31] praise the lord it's not just a song
[42:33] friends it's a revelation
[42:35] he knows what you went through this week
[42:37] he knows the test from the doctor sister
[42:40] Angie I guess the tests come back clear
[42:42] right for what she had a scare there
[42:45] what those tests would be and they're
[42:46] completely clear
[42:49] Hallelujah
[42:53] we rejoice in the Lord and we we're not
[42:55] afraid young people you listen I'm not
[42:58] afraid of a God who knows everything
[43:00] about me
[43:03] because why because I know his love will
[43:06] get me out of my habits and all out of
[43:08] my addictions and out of my and give me
[43:11] the Holy Ghost give me what I need his
[43:13] love will draw me into what I need I can
[43:15] trust a God Like That
[43:17] used to be scared and hide it and
[43:19] everything else no I'm not afraid to let
[43:21] him come and just Peg Me perfectly this
[43:23] morning
[43:24] let him speak exactly what I'm doing and
[43:27] sometimes he does it through the body of
[43:28] Christ because his gifts work in the
[43:30] body is to keep the church clean you
[43:31] have somebody come to you say I just in
[43:33] humbly humble brother sister say I just
[43:35] want to share some of you I had a dream
[43:36] I had this and not all dreams are true
[43:38] but I'm just sharing we should be open
[43:40] to people doing that because in the body
[43:41] of Christ he'll keep the church clean
[43:43] I've seen this something happen in your
[43:45] life is this true you better own up to
[43:46] it
[43:49] sometimes it's not through someone
[43:51] sometimes something just gets exposed
[43:52] and it's embarrassing but you know what
[43:54] in the long run
[43:57] he knows us and he loves us anyway
[44:02] you know it's nothing if others know us
[44:05] except it's embarrassing sometimes
[44:07] but when he knows us and he unveils us
[44:10] the word is a discerner
[44:14] praise the lord well that's I think I I
[44:16] think I
[44:17] covered that
[44:19] but then the second thing is the most
[44:20] important
[44:21] and that's we see him clearly
[44:25] we know him clearly without a dark glass
[44:30] we see him face to face
[44:33] not just the gifts that he does not just
[44:36] the knowledge of him not just that he
[44:39] can perform Miracles not just the signs
[44:42] of God it's all him but I'm not talking
[44:45] about just that this morning not just
[44:47] the gifts and the knowledge him but the
[44:49] person of him and all that he is and
[44:52] we're coming to a perfect clarity of
[44:55] ourselves and of him
[45:01] this face to face that Paul mentions
[45:03] this face to face in First Corinthians
[45:06] this prophecy that the church will move
[45:08] from a glass Darkly Through the Ages to
[45:11] at the end time coming face to face with
[45:14] Jesus Christ
[45:15] we we think quickly uh when we think of
[45:19] face to face
[45:20] we would interpret that right away as
[45:23] being physically seeing Jesus face to
[45:25] face
[45:26] right
[45:27] and it's okay I mean it says when we see
[45:30] him face to face then we'll be known uh
[45:33] we will know him as he knows us and we
[45:35] look at that as being the day when we
[45:37] physically see the physical Jesus 2000
[45:40] years ago that lived on the earth for uh
[45:42] 33 and a half years
[45:43] when we see him someday so they put it
[45:45] off to the Future when I see his
[45:47] physical characteristics face to face
[45:50] someday
[45:51] uh then I'll be known and then I'll come
[45:54] to this excellent way then I'll come to
[45:56] Divine love but he's prophesying and so
[45:58] it must not mean face to face physically
[46:00] and I want to illustrate this just a
[46:02] little bit from even the children the
[46:03] youngest child can understand if you're
[46:06] a stranger to me this morning to me and
[46:08] I walk up to you and it's the first time
[46:10] you met me Dana pretend that's the first
[46:12] time you met me all right Dan and
[46:14] actually Dana knows me I should choose
[46:16] somebody else because you know me too
[46:17] well
[46:18] to be in the church this many years
[46:21] um anyway pretend you're a stranger
[46:25] if it's the first time that we met and I
[46:28] come in front of Dana like this and
[46:31] we're seeing each other face to face he
[46:34] sees my physical characteristics but if
[46:36] he's a stranger he doesn't know me at
[46:38] all
[46:41] yes
[46:43] he doesn't know me
[46:45] he only knows my career so face to face
[46:48] must mean more than just a physical face
[46:51] to face with Jesus
[46:53] you see so he doesn't know me at all he
[46:56] doesn't know uh what I do he doesn't
[46:58] know some of my uh enjoyments some of my
[47:02] hobbies I don't have that many he
[47:04] doesn't know my friends and I don't have
[47:06] many of those either
[47:08] you know he doesn't know a clue about me
[47:10] how I I'm this way and that way and I
[47:13] like this certainly because we're all
[47:14] different different people like
[47:15] different things you you don't you even
[47:18] you know this you don't know that I like
[47:19] peanut M M's did you know that okay so
[47:22] that's part of me that's part of who I
[47:24] am I like being MNS I I eat a lot less
[47:28] of them today than I ate when I was a
[47:30] teenager but every once in a while at
[47:31] the airport I grab them
[47:33] don't tell my wife but
[47:37] I like pnms and it takes about 50
[47:39] seconds to suck on one to get to the
[47:41] peanut
[47:48] how many say you raise your hand said I
[47:50] didn't know that about you brother Paul
[47:51] and I'm your pastor see but that's part
[47:54] of my life it's part of me and if I can
[47:57] get around it they will always be a part
[47:59] of my life Pete and Eminem's not the
[48:02] regular M M's there's nothing to those
[48:03] the peanut ones
[48:05] but you didn't know that and so now
[48:07] there's there's a ton to know about me
[48:10] so if I'm around Dana he doesn't know
[48:12] any of that he doesn't know so he really
[48:14] doesn't know me even though he's looking
[48:15] at me face to face and so then as I if
[48:18] he stays here for a half hour he sees
[48:20] the way I move my arms and the way I my
[48:23] my dumb little jokes that I tell and you
[48:26] know corny jokes and then he sees the
[48:28] way I do this and and you know he didn't
[48:30] know I was a preacher so now he sees me
[48:31] preaching so there's one thing about
[48:33] he's a minister and then he moves his
[48:35] hands this way and he yells and then he
[48:37] gets quieted and so then as he watches
[48:39] me he gets some of the characteristics
[48:41] from my body of who I am okay so that's
[48:44] a little bit more learning you see that
[48:46] that says a little bit about his
[48:48] personality you know and and then he'd
[48:50] get come home with me and say he gets a
[48:52] little angry at this sometimes and he
[48:53] and you just start to learn how come
[48:56] your face turned that way brother Paul
[48:58] I've never seen that of course you've
[48:59] never seen him how come your face turned
[49:01] that way well it's something that really
[49:02] irritated me and so my face changes
[49:07] I know none of you ever do that that's
[49:08] just me
[49:10] that's just me but you know as he
[49:12] watches me he can do that but you guess
[49:14] guess what there's deeper levels of me
[49:17] that he still hasn't seen
[49:19] right he doesn't really know me yet
[49:22] because he seems how I've you know moved
[49:25] my arms around and you know he doesn't
[49:27] really know me yet because because he
[49:30] doesn't know my heart
[49:34] and he doesn't know my thoughts
[49:40] so he doesn't really know me because he
[49:42] might know me now physically and see all
[49:43] that I do in my personality I told him
[49:45] about my peanuts all things but he
[49:47] doesn't know my thoughts he doesn't know
[49:48] my heart and so it would take quite a
[49:51] while for him to listen to me and to
[49:54] hear me because I'm gonna there's gonna
[49:57] be a place that I'm gonna reveal my
[49:59] heart and my my thoughts and that's from
[50:02] my words
[50:05] and the more that I talk
[50:07] the more something gets trans gets
[50:10] transmitted from my mind and my thoughts
[50:13] and from my heart that's going to come
[50:15] through my words
[50:16] and that's why Jesus said my words that
[50:20] I speak unto you they are spirit and
[50:22] they are life
[50:24] how important is the word of God it's so
[50:28] important that you feed on the word of
[50:29] God and you hear the voice of God and
[50:31] hear him talk because he Reveals His
[50:34] heart and his mind through his word
[50:38] this message revealed the heart and the
[50:41] thoughts of God can you say Amen it
[50:43] brought us back to Bible Faith the Bible
[50:45] reels reveals the mystery of God
[50:47] revealed throughout the ages that Bible
[50:49] he said if you don't find Christ in
[50:51] every scripture go back and read it
[50:52] again it's not a story it's not just
[50:54] history can you say man but it's
[50:56] revealing the very thoughts of God and
[50:58] when a prophet comes and reminds us of
[51:00] that Bible and brings us back it's not
[51:02] just some two-bit preacher that's
[51:04] preaching a sermon through prophets he
[51:07] and he brings the very this is what
[51:10] brother man called it in Christ the
[51:11] mystery he reaches back into the back
[51:14] part of God's mind
[51:17] somebody say praise the Lord
[51:19] we're talking the back part of God's
[51:22] thoughts
[51:23] revealed through this message
[51:28] why do you have to say so much to the
[51:30] women about how they dress
[51:34] because
[51:36] do you want to know the thoughts of God
[51:37] how to dress
[51:40] or do you want the Kardashians
[51:48] so anybody's interested in the thoughts
[51:50] of God and the back part of his mind and
[51:52] what he thought of you before the
[51:54] foundation and all of this would have to
[51:56] say I'm gonna have to quit listening to
[51:58] those voices
[51:59] and feed on the word of God because
[52:01] through that it's not a duty just to
[52:03] read my Bible I know I had a sister tell
[52:05] me I know I need to read my Bible I know
[52:07] I need to come to church I know I need
[52:09] to do those things and I might as well
[52:10] to ask but but is it where's where's the
[52:12] I want to
[52:14] whereas I want to because you don't if
[52:16] if you don't see what it is I need to go
[52:19] to church I have to go to church but and
[52:21] I that's that's why I said yeah I come
[52:24] because of who's there not because of
[52:26] the building
[52:28] who's there
[52:30] so
[52:33] this is the way that this face to face
[52:36] with Christ is knowing him in a way the
[52:39] bride the people of God have never known
[52:41] him before but it's revealing his
[52:43] thoughts his heart and I can't preach
[52:46] this as as well as brother Craig did
[52:48] last Sunday morning the heart of God the
[52:51] heart of God and the commission to the
[52:52] church you can't run the commission of
[52:55] God
[52:56] cast out Devils all that you can't write
[52:58] it unless you've caught the heart of God
[53:00] the love of God
[53:02] amen
[53:04] and God through the beginning so opening
[53:06] up the Seven Seals and the Book of
[53:09] redemption broke open to this this
[53:12] perfect interpretation of the Lord what
[53:14] did he break open to us God is sharing
[53:17] his heart with the bride of Christ God
[53:19] is sharing his mind God is sharing his
[53:21] thoughts of you before the foundation of
[53:23] the world you can't hide anything from
[53:24] him and he is not hiding anything
[53:27] anymore from you
[53:31] this is what it means by face to face
[53:36] the thing is Dan as he learns this more
[53:38] about me
[53:39] through the years he's proved
[53:41] he still loves me
[53:44] don't you
[53:45] okay
[53:49] so I know he has the love of Christ
[53:50] because as he begins to learn anything
[53:52] maybe he doesn't understand why did he
[53:53] do this why did you make this decision
[53:55] that's fine you know you're going to
[53:56] have that come in your mind but because
[53:58] he knows my heart and he's watched over
[54:00] the years my motives and my con my just
[54:03] that part of Christ in me that's my full
[54:06] motive for preaching and everything he's
[54:09] a trustee in this church he's watched me
[54:10] for 25 20. whatever almost 30 years with
[54:14] us here and he's watched me so he looks
[54:17] at me deeper
[54:19] my motives and things than just the
[54:21] outside mistakes
[54:24] that's the love of Christ and Dana
[54:26] it's not a partial thing but it's
[54:28] becoming clearer clearer what the
[54:30] picture of Christ is and so now when we
[54:32] look about and I'm going to try to find
[54:34] a place to end this and pick it up maybe
[54:35] Wednesday night now we look at this face
[54:38] how many want to look into the face of
[54:40] Christ
[54:41] just three of us all right
[54:46] it's a good question
[54:48] how many want to look into the very face
[54:50] of Christ
[54:52] and then the extra promise is that as we
[54:54] keep our eyes fixed on his word which
[54:57] reveals the right face of Christ and his
[54:59] thoughts and his heart as we look into
[55:01] it we are transformed and we are changed
[55:04] from glory to glory to glory
[55:07] it's an extra benefit because you're not
[55:08] just looking to say I see more of Christ
[55:10] it's changing you
[55:12] it's changing you so now it's not
[55:15] speaking physically it is speaking and
[55:17] friends I let me say something about
[55:19] seeing Jesus physically nobody really
[55:21] knows what he looks like completely
[55:24] physically but I'll know him I believe
[55:27] when I get there
[55:29] and that face to face I'm going to love
[55:31] that too
[55:33] you know why because he is only one
[55:36] person and this person that has guided
[55:38] me that has leaded me that's convicted
[55:40] me to an altar when I'm wrong that has
[55:42] loved me that has shown me so many
[55:44] Revelations this person that's been with
[55:46] me and in me all these years I know his
[55:48] characteristics I know all those things
[55:50] and it's going to be a joy to meet the
[55:53] person physically can you say Amen
[55:56] it will be worth it all when we see
[55:58] Jesus
[56:00] life's trials will seem so small when I
[56:03] meet the friend and my brother and I
[56:05] will Embrace him because he's not just
[56:07] my king he's my savior he's not just my
[56:09] savior he's my Lord he has become my
[56:12] teacher my counselor I his word I love
[56:15] his word I love everything about him
[56:16] there's no resistance to anything he
[56:19] says anymore and like I'm saying that
[56:20] honestly I have such trust in this word
[56:23] that's been revealed through the message
[56:25] in the Bible I trust Christ if he said
[56:27] it I'm embracing it I'll Trust it even
[56:29] when I don't understand it
[56:32] because I love him I love his word
[56:34] people say do you love me I love the oh
[56:36] they love the Lord but do they love his
[56:37] word because he can't be separated from
[56:39] her I love every part of it but you see
[56:41] now when I meet him someday I will have
[56:43] a joy in that too because I'll meet the
[56:45] one that has been so close to me
[56:47] invisible
[56:48] I'll get to meet him
[56:50] but people preached us as to face to
[56:52] face it's like there's some people who
[56:54] want to see that someday but they don't
[56:57] want his word
[56:59] they don't want who he is
[57:01] they don't want him to talk
[57:05] you're not going to go your whole life
[57:07] and say shh don't talk don't talk I
[57:09] don't want to hear that this doesn't
[57:10] have a voice of God Jesus don't talk
[57:12] Jesus I want Jesus when I get in trouble
[57:14] but I don't want him to talk to me
[57:16] what you don't really want to know him
[57:19] then
[57:20] it's my granddaughter you know we're all
[57:22] in the living room talking and she's got
[57:23] this thing we're all talking with
[57:24] another but we're not talking to her so
[57:26] she said she comes out stop talking
[57:30] stop talking stop talking everybody stop
[57:32] talking and then we all stop and then
[57:34] she really don't have nothing to say she
[57:36] just wants everybody to quit talking
[57:37] because the attention is not on her
[57:41] stop talking stop talking so we'll
[57:43] respected and then what do you want to
[57:46] say
[57:47] she just likes everybody looking at her
[57:49] I guess
[57:50] some people are that way with Jesus they
[57:52] don't want him to talk
[57:55] they wanted Jesus they want a modern
[57:56] Jesus they want a Jesus of their own
[57:58] imagination don't tell me the church
[57:59] hasn't come up with their new Jesus he's
[58:02] the Jesus of rock and roll that's in
[58:03] tattoos and everything up in the
[58:05] platform because that's the Jesus people
[58:06] want
[58:07] never preach against sin they've created
[58:10] their own Jesus of their own imagination
[58:12] I want the Jesus of the Bible because I
[58:15] know he truly loves me
[58:17] but you know they create their own thing
[58:20] and I I want to hug him and that day I
[58:23] can't wait to hug Jesus
[58:24] you know and Jesus said there will be
[58:27] ones that do many wonderful miracles in
[58:29] my name casting out devils
[58:31] but he said I never knew them
[58:35] they didn't know me
[58:37] so when they get there say but we've
[58:39] cast out devils in your name let me give
[58:41] you a hug you know let's have a hug
[58:45] bring it in Jesus
[58:51] group hug with all the saints
[58:54] but you didn't want to hear them talk
[58:56] when you're on Earth you resisted his
[58:58] word you resisted his invitation to give
[59:00] a full surrender to God
[59:02] if they want a hug at the end Judas
[59:04] wanted to kiss him
[59:07] it's called the Betrayal kiss
[59:09] I've experienced some of that when
[59:11] people are so cordial so friendly but
[59:13] they're betraying you they're betraying
[59:15] this word
[59:16] and he said hug up give you a big hug
[59:18] you know and but it's it's a Jesus was
[59:21] kissed and he knew all along Jesus what
[59:22] he was doing
[59:24] he physically wanted it because he felt
[59:26] guilty already he physically wanted to
[59:28] get around Jesus and give him one last
[59:30] kiss and just show a little Brotherhood
[59:32] there and just sold him for 30 pieces of
[59:34] silver
[59:36] you don't know him if you just know him
[59:39] physically or want to know him
[59:40] physically we know him by a face-to-face
[59:42] relationship through this word
[59:45] and then when you start to know him you
[59:47] say I want him
[59:50] I want to know him
[59:52] I want him to reveal my life
[59:55] I want him to reveal himself to me I
[59:57] want to know more of him can you say
[1:00:00] Amen
[1:00:01] I'm not afraid of him I want to know him
[1:00:04] more can you say Amen
[1:00:21] God does not have a glass dark vision of
[1:00:23] me a glass Darkly of me he sees it all
[1:00:28] we cannot stay with a partial vision of
[1:00:30] Christ or others
[1:00:32] when our looking is limited or partial
[1:00:35] of him partial revelation
[1:00:37] if it's a partial revelation of him it's
[1:00:39] a partial love
[1:00:40] if our vision is limited of him or we
[1:00:43] have partial Revelation even of the word
[1:00:45] it will limit how much love this works
[1:00:47] in US Paul ties it together I didn't
[1:00:49] Paul ties it together a face-to-face
[1:00:51] knowing him brings this excellent way in
[1:00:54] this Divine love out in US it breaks
[1:00:57] open the way for it we cannot ignore a
[1:00:59] face-to-face relationship with Christ
[1:01:02] the word
[1:01:03] and come to this Divine love and I know
[1:01:06] I've asked this before I want it more
[1:01:08] than anything else in my life I want to
[1:01:10] be functioning every day by Divine love
[1:01:12] I want a victory in Divine love that's
[1:01:14] the climax of this message friends
[1:01:16] that's the revival can you say man that
[1:01:19] is the Revival of the final Revival for
[1:01:21] the bride a partial revelation will make
[1:01:24] you partial to people
[1:01:26] First Timothy 5 19 says against an elder
[1:01:29] receive not an accusation but before two
[1:01:31] or three Witnesses
[1:01:35] First Timothy 5 20 them that sick sin
[1:01:38] rebuked before All That Others May fear
[1:01:40] I charged thee before God and the Lord
[1:01:42] Jesus Christ and the elect angels that
[1:01:44] thou observe these things without
[1:01:45] preferring one another
[1:01:46] before preferring one another doing
[1:01:49] nothing by partiality James 2 and verse
[1:01:52] 2 he brings it up again I'm just using
[1:01:53] two scriptures that talk about we don't
[1:01:55] do anything with partiality we can't
[1:01:57] have partiality amongst us we can't do
[1:02:00] that God doesn't look at us that way we
[1:02:01] can't look at one another that way James
[1:02:03] two and two my brethren have not the
[1:02:05] Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord
[1:02:07] of Glory with respect of persons
[1:02:10] for if they're coming to your assembly a
[1:02:11] man with a gold ring a good new apparel
[1:02:13] and they're coming also a poor man and
[1:02:15] vowel raiment and ye have respect to him
[1:02:17] that we're at the gay clothing and say
[1:02:18] to them hey sit down sit down sit down
[1:02:21] here in a good place and say to the poor
[1:02:23] stand now here sit under my footstool
[1:02:25] are you not then partial in yourselves
[1:02:28] and are become judges of evil thoughts
[1:02:30] this partiality of Love selective love
[1:02:34] is not to be in the kingdom of God Among
[1:02:37] Us
[1:02:40] and one thing that dissolves it from our
[1:02:42] hearts
[1:02:43] it's to see Jesus and to know him
[1:02:46] face to face
[1:02:49] I want a relationship of face-to-face
[1:02:51] some of you teenagers at a place it's
[1:02:52] not about Mom and Dad anymore it's you
[1:02:54] deciding I want to face I'm not afraid
[1:02:56] of a face-to-face relationship with
[1:02:58] Jesus Christ I'm going to get in the
[1:03:00] word I want to see him and then it needs
[1:03:02] to change I can't change things I can't
[1:03:04] seem to do this I can't seem to get over
[1:03:06] this habit and the brother Ram said that
[1:03:07] he says you try to quit smoking you go
[1:03:09] credit drinking you try to quit these
[1:03:11] habits he said just get in Christ and
[1:03:13] it's all gone
[1:03:15] how can you make it make it that simple
[1:03:17] they need to come through a 10-step
[1:03:18] program
[1:03:21] that's what the world says
[1:03:23] but I'm preaching to you if they're
[1:03:24] really seeing Christ face to face
[1:03:27] that habit just washes away
[1:03:30] maybe not quickly but some with quickly
[1:03:32] but I'll tell you you stay in his face
[1:03:34] and behold him there's no way you can
[1:03:36] hang on to that it just goes because why
[1:03:38] you're enjoying more your walk with the
[1:03:40] Lord and your fellowship with him than
