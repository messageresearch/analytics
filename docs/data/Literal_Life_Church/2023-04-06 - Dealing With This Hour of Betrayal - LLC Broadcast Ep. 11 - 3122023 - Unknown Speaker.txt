in Jesus name Matthew 24 chapter 24 and verse 3. and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so there's three questions there and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many so one of the signs of the end time is deception and deception that is so close it looks like the real thing it looks like an anointed one Christ is means the anointed one and so one of the signs of the end time is real real bad deception deception that so closely looks like the real thing here's some more signs of verse six ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet we've seen wars and rumors of wars since World War one all the way through for many years now the last hundred years or more we've seen a lot of wars and it's interesting Jesus says here be not see that you be not troubled we really shouldn't be troubled over that it's supposed to come especially when we know we're safe within the arms of Christ and living in the Rock can you say Amen we have a safe haven from the rumors of wars and the wars that actually may be closing in us on us even more he said don't be troubled about that verse 7 said for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and in many places diverse places I want you to notice us these signs of the end time first mentioned here are external pressures there are things that happen you see in the news sometimes we're affected by a war sometimes we see those things but especially here in America and different places we haven't been directly affected we've had earthquakes and diver places we've had pestilences but still kind of not completely affected like a lot of people are but that's all external pressures that's external signs but watch as it turns over here if you would to verse eight Watch what it does now all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake I want you to notice now it turns from an external pressure to a very personal pressure that you're going to be hated it's going to be a pressure personally towards you now you're going to be persecuted for his namesake so now it's one thing to look out and read the news and see and hear oh the signs of the end time and it's external it's another thing when it turns internal becomes personal and it goes deeper it says they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you you should be hated to All Nations for my namesake watch how much closer I get and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many so now it's moving closer in my subject again tonight of betrayal it'll be an hour it'll be a time of betrayal it says many shall betray one another many are going to be offended and many will hate none so it's a time of offense it's a time of betrayal it's a time of just outright hatred of one another and those are signs of the end time if we see that intensifying we're close to the end but tonight I don't want to talk about we see these things happening and intensifies War it's not so much they're happening we know they're happening and the hatred becomes no more intense it's not about that it's about how do we respond to it how do we respond to it and many false prophets shall rise and shall receive many look at this verse 12 and because iniquity iniquity is knowing to do good and not doing it iniquity sins shall abound it'll increase it'll get more because of that the love of many shall wax cold signs of the end time betrayal it's one thing to talk about wars signs are betrayal signs are people being offended signs are false prophets signs are deception signs are being hated and signs are the love of many will grow cold how many has ever got the cold shoulder how many ever got worse than the cold shoulder just people cold there's no heart in it anymore it's just coldness towards one another this is the atmosphere this is a sign that we're just about finished here just about finished here I want to read the last verse I'm going to read in verse 13 but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved so if it says that somebody is going to endure if we read verse 13 again Saints we see that he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved so enduring to the end is really the key enduring to the end is really the key um how many wants to endure to the end so that's the key phrase from Jesus here is that he that endureth to the end shall be saved saved from what saved from these save from these atmospheres save from the hatred save from the offense saved from the spirit of betrayal saved from the deceptive prophets we ought to be saved from all that and he that endureth till the end shall be saved so enduring is the key the question is how do we endure to the end and what will we have working in us to cause us to make it to the end I'm asking that question tonight what is it that we will have with us because if God says there's going to be some that endures to the end then there's got to be something that he places within us that we would have the grace to endure all of these times if we want to endure to the end then is what is it well that we will have in us that would cause us to make it all the way to the end and to endure can you say Amen so that's the that's the key tonight is to look at what we have to have within us to be able to endure these things many are Fallen by the wayside many are dropping off track many are giving up can you say man many are under the pressures are they're just throwing in the towel and so there's many have fallen by the wayside we never write them off we pray that God will bring them back but there's many that's doing that and a lot of it is because of the pressures the scares the fears but I can tell you not just the pressures of wars and rumors of wars and men's Hearts failing for fear but these pressures are added in here too the pressure of being betrayed the pressure of people being offended the pressure of being hated and people hating one another the families hating one another the pressure of iniquity abounding and the love of many growing cold that also is a pressure and that's mostly a pressure to our spirit to our emotions not our soul can you say man our soul should be anchored in the Haven of Rest but our spirit can be affected by these different things and as I said last Wednesday night betrayal is one of the top things a human Spirit has a hard time getting over is somebody betraying you it's difficult for the human Spirit to be able to handle so in in last week we were in the closing hours of Jesus life and I called it Jesus our Jesus hour betrayal in the last week of his life this week I want to entitle this dealing with this hour of betrayal because just like Jesus had an intense hour of betrayal now the bride is having an intense hour of betrayal as well and so how did Jesus go through that how did he endure how did he come through so we we talked uh and I'll just mention it again about Christ because I was ministered to greatly last week to see the the the days and the hours and the steps and my biggest thing that ministered to me the biggest thing that ministered to me is I was looking at how did Jesus get through being forsaken by every Everybody how did he get through standing on his own what was the motivating thing we know God was in him can you say Amen we understand that but I'm going to point out something tonight that was an expression out of him that that kept coming up showing me that this is how we endure until the end this is how you endure betrayal the human Spirit can't endure this type of betrayal but God has his grace that we can endure betrayal and we can actually live above it and we can overcome it can you say amen and we could actually be Christians who love one another again even though love has failed us we think and we people have failed us and the confidence has failed but God can bring us such a strength with his Divine love that we can love like we've never ever been hurt before that's a well I'm preaching way up here above our heads tonight a night that we can love and give our hearts like we've never been hurt before like we've never been betrayed before and the next guy the next guy that comes along we're given all of our love of Christ to them and we're not putting them in a category that they're going to betray me too that's not actually not fair that's not fair to do that and so Jesus didn't do that for sure and so the next guy doesn't get the blunt of our hurt from our past betrayals and our heard from our past offenses they don't get the blood of it because we've decided to freely give the love of God and love as if you've never been hurt before and to give it even when we're we have the risk all the time of being hurt again I can't preach to your life that you're not going to get hurt by somebody tomorrow that somebody's not going to post something against you tomorrow that a friend is not going to turn I can't guarantee you that a friend is not going to turn against you tomorrow life is like that but I can preach to you a holy ghost and a love in the Holy Ghost that can live above it and live higher than it and that can love anyway and to live and be a better friend than what they're being to you praise the Lord so now I preached the intensity of the hour that Jesus went through it was truly above all human endurance what Jesus went through not only the cross and Calvary but the Betrayal uh if if we were going through that and none of us went through it like Christ it would actually cut to the very core of the human Spirit to feel the depth of friends forsaking him like they did it would cut to the core of our human Spirit to have to feel what Jesus felt and how much betrayal that it was and how much losing his friends his closest people to him walked away and I'll tell you it cuts to the core of Who We Are because God's made us a relational being God has made you a relational being that's why you can go off and say I'm sick and tired of people I'm going up to the Smoky Mountains which I wouldn't mind doing by the way going up to the Smokies I'm gonna get a cabin up there I never want to see people again but I'm going I'm getting ready to and and so you can go that but you know what you're doing you're denying the CR the creation God has made you because God has created even human beings he's created us relational people and the first time he said it he said that when he was going to bring Eve to Adam he says it's not good for man to be alone he made this a relational being it's not good for man it doesn't doesn't mean God's just going to give you a wife that's not no our relationships let me say this let me say this some guys think and some girls think that's the ultimate relationship and if I get that I don't need anybody else no God made you for all kinds of relationships and you can't have if you if you can't have a healthy relationship with others through your your single years if you have trouble with all your other relationship there's no guarantee your relationship with your wife or husband will be right can I say that tonight why because if you haven't practiced and you haven't learned to be the right type of friend in relation you're not going to apply that to your wife oh no I'll do it I love her I love him it's going to be fine I can ditch everybody else no no God is teaching you to have the right relationship with everybody and it's only through the Oneness of Christ it's only him that teaches us about relationship he come up with this idea he created us can you say amen and he's the first one who said it's not good for man to be alone he never created us to be on our own individuals with nobody else but he created us for a relationship with him and he created us for a relationship with others and guess what he created us through the Holy Ghost he created us for good relationships good friendships solid relationships how many would raise your hands say I'd like to have more of that only in the Holy Ghost who is the author of destroying relationships who is the author of betrayal and offense and breaking promises and breaking relations who's the author of divorce it's not God and so if he had the true thing then we know God can not only give us the Holy Ghost for Oneness with God and one another but he can teach us what true relationship is and really today we have to be taught because we come a lot of us from such broken homes and broken churches and broken relationships and some of us didn't even get the right image of what a husband and wife was some of us didn't even get a right image of what brothers and sisters are and right relationships between siblings some have seen a twisted View and even if you had a decent home if you fell on Hollywood too much you really got a Twist of view of relationships can you say mine because it taught the wrong type of relationship it taught disrespect to parents it talked disrespect between a husband and wife it teaches it and so now you got all that messed up in your mind you have to be by the Holy Ghost you say well man that's it I don't need anything else and now that I gotta know you have to be re-taught by the Holy Ghost doesn't the Bible says the holy ghost that teacheth things the Holy Ghost is a teacher well if we already know everything when we got the Holy Ghost then we don't need Holy Ghost teacher does anybody know that Pericles the holy ghost in the Greek is Pericles one who goes alongside to help as a tutor so if we're we needed a tutor then we must be the student who doesn't know everything already oh I'm starting to preach now put down my notes and go with this the Holy Ghost is the teacher that will lead you and guide you into all truth it's not a one-night event but once you have the teacher inside you then as a student you say okay I'm submissive now for you to train me and if it takes 30 years for me to graduate I'm staying in the tutors class and I'm going to be taught and I'm going to submit to this tutor can you say Amen but one of the things this Holy Ghost teacher has to teach people and re-teach them is about relationship what it means to be a husband and wife and be in Oneness what it means for a family to dwell together in unity what it means for brothers and sisters to be in a church and come to Oneness in a friendship not just friendship but brothers and sisters what it means to really come to close relationships we have to be retaught because most of us didn't come from stable types of backgrounds if you did praise the Lord but all of us could take some more teaching relationships 101. we're not going to get that from some University the Holy Ghost through the word is gonna if we'll be the student and if you be humble enough to say as a student you know what I need help because my wife and I aren't as close as we could be my friendships have all gone awry so it seems like I've come to the place I don't even have any friendships left well maybe you should look at yourself first it's Jesus you know it I've got to move on with him but and talk about just a little bit but I want to move on to our our betrayal don't forget being betrayed may be the worst pain in our spirit we'd ever experience betrayal means to someone to break trust with us to let us down to break one's promise to be disloyal to us to deceive now you've either had that happen to you but you probably had both you've done the same thing to other people disloyal deceives someone to break up a promise to somebody to let somebody down we're human beings and we fall under that we do that to other people that's why we should have Grace for other people because we've done it to other people ourselves and so across the board you say I my human Frailty has not been a good friend to somebody I have not been a good friend so you have Grace if they're not being a good friend to you or something like that has happened then you realize my I've had the same thing I I've done the same thing and so we all need God we need more of God we need more of his transforming power in our lives we need to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and be taught by the Holy Ghost so I can become a better friend a better brother in Christ a better brother to my sisters and my siblings a better son to my father a better son to my mother a better daughter to my family even a a a a an unsaved mom there can be levels of respect and Oneness and trust me God that can actually speak through that unsaved mom you don't work around God's principles can you say amen God gave those parents Authority in your life now if they ask you to do something to do that's off the word that's another story but God will respect you you as you respect your unsaved parents God will work through them God if they're unsafe God can God spoke through a donkey God can work through unsaved people listen let me tell you the bosses I used to have the bosses and I was an employee and I got so upset at them until I realized God can speak through an unconverted boss and teach me lessons God is teaching us by the Holy Ghost to bring us into better relationships and betrayal is one of the worst things that can head a human spirit that they never trust somebody again how worse can it get I'll quit preaching at you and I'll preach at me how worse can it get when someone's been betrayed by a gospel minister how much worse or someone who believed did I read the scripture in Psalms 55 last week I think it was where David said I could have handled it if it had been my enemy who turned against me but it was a guy I walked to church with every witch cuts to the core of us but to preach about preachers who who abuse their Authority and abuse and maybe not live their life and then someone finds out years later they're not living the life and they're living an immoral life or some preacher who is abusing uh money women or popularity and and those are the three things ministers Fall by or to find out after 30 something years a brother has preached the message now denies the entire message and walks away from it that's difficult that's you know what that is that's betrayal to your human Spirit that's a betrayal and the human Spirit does not get over that too quickly people are suffering from it preachers that didn't stay faithful and the hundreds of thousands of people around the world that are suffering young people suffering because of the Betrayal betrayal it affects the human spirit we might as well raise our hand and admit it it cuts to the Corsa and if we don't if we don't get forgiveness and get these things that God has given us forgiveness and divine love in our hearts and say Lord I want to overcome this I want to become the right person I can't change that person but I want to get past my past I have got to get past my path Lord wash my sins and your forgetfulness wash my mistakes what they've done is between them and God but I by the grace of God have felt a flood and a wash of forgiveness in my soul I can say honestly I have forgiven that person completely and now this is not going to dominate my mind or dominate my sleep this is the past over a year and this is my future and when we mix the past with the future we are defeated all the time all the potential for the future it could be so great but we're blending it with the past and it's tainting us it's hurting us it's it's binding us because we want to go forward but we got all this baggage and this plague in our minds and and even though we've been forgive enough stuff and all these other things but you see maybe we haven't forgiven someone else of the portrayal they did to our lives and we haven't let it go yet and so we can't have the power because how many know that there's power that's in our past is a powerful sway over you if it's not washed away but the good thing is is your future has a power in it God called our families to be free God called our families to the Token God calls our families to be honest with one another God called our families to be in Oneness God called our marriages to be in Oneness being honest with one another being real with one another lifting one another up and encourage one another when we fail when we fall God gives us hope and strength and Joy about thinking about what's coming next thank you for watching our message
