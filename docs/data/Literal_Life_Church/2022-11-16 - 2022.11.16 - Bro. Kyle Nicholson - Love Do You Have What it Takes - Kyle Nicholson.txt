========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] if we'd want to turn to Luke 23 and verse 42 . just pray the Lord speaks to us and this ministers to you so he says and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom let's pray Lord we just we thank you for this opportunity Lord Lord we just pray that you open our hearts Lord of what you have to say Lord pray that you help me to get out of the way Lord and relax Lord and you just come through Me Lord Lord let us pray Lord this has the effect that you wanted to Lord pray comes forth like it should Lord Jesus in Jesus name we pray amen amen and you have receipts so this has a bit of a backstory I was actually supposed to preach about a month or so ago and I messed it up and I didn't preach so brother Paul had to throw something together and preach and he did a very good job but during that service I got the title to this and it's if I had a title it'd be love and do you have what it takes so the Lord we humans put titles on these things but if there's something on your heart that you need hold on to it the Lord knows what you need and he can bring whatever that is if it has to do with this title if it doesn't have to do this title he can bring it all we have to do is hold on our Harps and be accepting of it so love what is love and how do we love and what does love look like these are a lot of questions we have about love and love is a very tricky thing so if we start out with what does love look like we have so many places that we can go to to find out what love looks like we can go to Facebook we can go to Twitter the world makes it so much easier to go everywhere on the internet to find what love looks like but if we're going to love look where love if we're going to look for a good example of what love looks like we'd go to the scriptures and where I would start would be Mark 4 35 through 41. you bring that up it's Mark 4 35 through 31 41 35-41 sorry so it says in the same day when Eve was has was come he's saith unto them let us pass over onto the other side and then when they had sent away the multitude they looked they took him even and as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke him and say unto him Master careth though not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the Wind and Sea obey him so if we don't stop there and we keep going to mark five this is where the love comes in he did this in Mark 5 verse 1 it says and they came over onto the other side of the sea into the country of gatherine and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit so they crossed this whole thing for one man but if we go back a little bit if we can go back to the what I say 35 Mark 4 35. Jesus tells them that we're going to go across the other side it sounds super easy we're just going to go across the other side hop in boys this is going to be fun so they get in this boat so who's in this boat with the disciples are in this boat we can look further in the scriptures and it says the disciples are in the boat but the disciples are in the boat so out of the disciples there's fishermen in the boat there's that we know of Andrew Peter James and John are fishermen and there is some that say Thomas Phillip and Bartholomew were fishermen as well but the point is Andrew Peter James and John were fishermen their dad was a fisherman so they knew how to run a boat so they get in this boat we're going to go on to the other side that's all we're going to do it's going to be simple go to the next scripture next one and there came a great storm and the waves beat into the ship so that it was full so now the ship is starting to go down and you have four fishermen on there that have been doing this their entire lives on this ship so if there was a Rudder their Rudder in this thing as hard as they can render this thing if there was ropes they're pulling on the ropes if there's things that cut they're cutting these things they're doing everything they can to keep this ship afloat and they can't do it they realize we cannot do this so they go to Jesus they didn't go to Jesus and say hey man when you got a minute gonna need your help over here they were going to die they knew they were going to die they had done everything they could they were going to die so they were yelling at him come right now we're going to die we're gonna die and Jesus showed up and Jesus calmed the storm but they get to where they're going and they go for one man so these poor guys went through all of this stuff they're pulling things they're cutting things they're cutting sales off their ship they're trying to keep this thing afloat they're bailing it out they're doing everything they can to keep this ship afloat and Jesus said let's just go to the other side and they get there and there's one dude that they went for so they come off the ship they're shaking I'm sure it didn't go well at all they're pretty sure they're going to die the whole time and we come to mark five and he says he was come out of the ship immediately and there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not what chains because that he had been often bound with Fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the Fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day was in the mountains and in tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I had to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adjure Thee my God that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is Legion we are many so we know they went across this to get one man it's one man Legion so they get off this boat they're shaking they're cold they've almost died they've done all this stuff and they come up to a naked dude in a graveyard and that was the whole point of them showing up there they come up to a guy with 2 000 demons so if you've ever thought about it with two thousand demons can you name two thousand demons so if you can name two thousand demons can you name two thousand demons without putting murder in there can you name two thousand without putting abuse in there without putting a salt in there without putting the worst things you can come up with can you come up with two thousand demons that someone would struggle with without putting in these horrible things that they could have done so I can't I can't come up with that so they went across the sea they almost died to get one naked dude in the graveyard with two thousand demons that deserved nothing it's very likely that he was a murderer that he was an abuser that he had done horrendous things to people and should have been where he was that's why he was there he wasn't there because he served because he sold too many Girl Scout cookies he was there because he did really bad things and no one wanted him around and they couldn't keep him under control but Jesus crossed this Shore this this Pond to get to the other side for one man with two thousand demons that didn't deserve anything didn't say he was sorry didn't do anything but Jesus crossed the sea for one guy that is an example of love that's how far we push things as an example of love and it's good to think we don't always want to do that I I'm sure the disciples were not happy if you really think about it we almost died we came over to get the crazy guy and then we got back in the boat we got kicked out they didn't go there get the crazy guy straightened out everything is good everybody loves us parade we just walked away awesome no they got kicked out they Jesus delivered this guy and they got kicked out they had to go so we showed up for this crazy guy you helped him out and they don't even want us here but you wanted to do this because God wanted to do that for you we have to have the scriptures have to be real to us this is you this is you in the scriptures this is me in the scriptures this is this is the love that God has for all of us so that's an example that's one of my favorite examples in the Bible of what love looks like but love is hard it's complicated so why is it hard and why is it complicated so if we look back at the beginning this is kind of how I see it at the beginning of our Christian walk when we start off I feel like we get some things we get some tools if we go to Ephesians 6 and 13-17 we'll see about this so it says wherefore take unto thee the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand there for having your Lawrence girded about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked it says all the fire darts didn't say some of them says all the fire darts so if we go on and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of spirit which is the word of God so we got our helmet we got our Shield we got all the things we need to start off with and then we start to hear about love where God is love love is everything without without love you don't have God so we start to wonder where do we get What is love and if we look we want just a black and white example we looked at Corinthians 13. First Corinthians 13. so to paraphrase for time we've read First Corinthians 13. so if you read through Corinthians First Corinthians 13 you can do almost anything and if you do it without love it means literally nothing you can be a prophet you can be a pastor you can be a preacher you can be the best musician there is you can help everyone you can be Mother Teresa you can give away every nickel you have and you did it with the wrong Spirit it means nothing it means absolutely nothing so what happens we start to this sounds harsh right so we we want to look for love we find love in the Bible but it says if we don't do it with love we're nothing we're absolutely nothing and we start to skew our love we start to see things we the problem is we start to bring things with us we complicate our loves because we're a product of our making we're a product of our raising sorry we bring things with us as we come into this Christian walk and the problem is I see a lot like Moses when they start to leave Egypt so if you think about it this Moses guy comes we're going to leave Egypt he starts doing stuff nothing's happening nothing's happening nothing's happening so finally the guy shows up at the door knocks on your door and he says hey Billy Bob it's time we're finally going this Moses guy apparently it's real we're going this time I promise so you say okay I gotta grab my thing so you run and grab your thing and now you got your thing and you got your you got your sword you got your Shield but the problem is you brought this thing with you you brought this thing with you that is your past you brought this thing with you and you can pick it up along the way so you're so excited we're leaving we're going to leave Egypt but then things start happening as you leave things start happening as you become a Christian and it starts to hurt you and you don't know how to let it go because you got to Sting with you so then you start to try to look through this thing and do all the stuff that you have to do with this thing that you won't let go in it's complicated it's hard to let the thing go it's really big and it's in the way like this plant so we have this thing and it starts to mess up everything that we're doing because we're trying to do everything while looking through this thing and you can't see a thing because you have a thing so where do these things come from these things come from like I said they come from our past a lot of times we have so much trouble letting go of things that happen to us now why do we have trouble with letting know things that happen to us a lot of times because we want to have it handled in a certain way we want to make sure that God is going to get it right but you have no idea what you're doing in we can have the hardest part about it is it doesn't stop it's not just a little thing it can be big things it can be little things so can I tell you can tell you a story so there's this little boy he's four years old when he's four years old he's staying in this hallway and there's Green carpet and you stand in an endless hallway and there's a bookshelf and there's a TV in the living room it's on a swivel he thinks it's cool and he used to watch TV on there with his Dad he used to watch a cartoon called gargoyles but this night his parents are arguing his dad's sitting in a green recliner and they're arguing and they're arguing and arguing they're fighting and it's getting really bad and as dad goes he backs his things up and he goes and he starts to realize this little boy realizes when this happens that this is something Clicks in his head then he knows this is going to be the last time they see his dad for a while so his dad goes his parents divorced his dad goes down the road his dad develops a drug problem so his dad has this drug problem you got to get drugs but you got kids what do you do take the kids to the drug house so as this little boy is six years old he starts asking his mother why do you go to the pharmacy to get your medicine and dad goes to some guy's house and she said what do you mean and I and he said well when when Dad gets his medicine we go to this guy's house he's got dogs he's got all this cool stuff and that's where he gets his medicine so they realize that this man is taking kids with him his children with him to get these drugs so they get taken away and it starts a whole thing of them getting taken away from him he's getting custody for a minute getting visitations for a little bit then they get taken away constantly so this little boy has brothers and sisters he has older brother and sister he has lots of brothers and sisters so his older brother is in trouble all the time constantly in trouble all the time so he comes picks him up and they're driving down the road in these cops cars surround the vehicle and the older brother looks his little brother he's six at a time and he says don't worry they're here for me you'll be fine so the cops arrest his brother and come to find out that his brother had broken into their home and destroyed their house and they couldn't figure out who had done it and it was the oldest brother that had done it so this little boy gets taken home by the police and this just starts this whole thing constantly his brothers and sisters are in in and out of jail constantly he's seven years old and he used to get babysat by his Uncle Pat well you can't get babysit by Uncle Pat anymore and his mom explains to him that's because Uncle Pat's in prison Uncle Pat got in a fight with a man and killed him so he's in prison for the rest of his life he went away and he can't get out now so Uncle Pat's out of the picture now his oldest brother's out of the picture now and it just continues on this way to where you get this kid who down the road is getting in a little bit of trouble and things like that and he's 12 years old and he starts to chew tobacco so then he starts to get into more things because it just lets you let it go your dad don't want you everyone around you is either in jail or in prison no one really cares about you they got their own problems to deal with so it just gets easier to take pills and to drink and forget about it and this is 13 years old so don't think that it's too young this is 13 years old when this started so it just starts this whole deal he's encouraged by his brothers and sisters to do all these bad things it's easy to get things because he has older brothers and sisters it makes it way easier to get the things that you shouldn't be able to get and it becomes an Angry Kid a really angry kid who's in fights all the time he's constantly in fights in school constantly fights out of school wherever he can he's fighting because he has this thing he has this thing with his dad so it keeps going on and it just gets worse and worse and worse gets kicked out of career center expelled forever for fighting he's starting to fights with kids that don't deserve it and doing the worst things that you can do so this little boy his dad is in and out of his life everyone's constantly in and out of his life he gets a stepdad that makes things a little bit better for a little bit longer but then his mom divorces him as well so his dad comes in and out of his picture his whole life he's been in on his picture and there's been times where his mom had to hide the kids in the basement because the dad wanted him he just wasn't supposed to be there and she knew that if she didn't hide everybody in the basement if this man got through the door things were going to end badly it wasn't going to go very well for this family so this little boy goes down the road still doing all these things in car accidents in the drugs into fighting keeps going on and on everyone's going to prison constantly all the time so he gets down the road and he gets into a car accident and things start to change for him at the car accident so if we fast forward he gets married he has all these things but the dad comes back into his life and his dad comes back into his life and starts helping with things when he's 19 years old and he says I'm sorry for everything that happened I'm not pointing fingers at you but I just want you to know I forgive you and the little boy wasn't sure what he was forgiven for because he was a little boy when all these things happened and his dad put him through all these things says Dad would constantly use his children as a bank account so he would get money buy things up and then he'd run out of money so he'd invite the kids over to bring their toys and he would steal all their toys and take them sell them so you get more drugs and anytime he came around it was to get more drugs just to steal something it was to get something from these people to get more drugs so he comes back into his life and he says I forgive you for all the things you did I forgive you for being a bad kid and he says okay I was a child and the man still he just he wanted to let the kid know that he forgave him for being a bad kid so this just this little boy is just angry he's had to deal with all these things and he's just angry he's very angry and it just compiles all the time because you don't want to let it go because this person deserves to get what they have coming but that's not for us to decide so you probably most of you know this but this little boy is me so my dad came back in my life and it never got better it never got better it was constant problems with my dad he continued this until he died he died three years ago and it never stopped in it was constantly him stealing from us him taking things from us him doing all these things and it got really honestly worse and his dad was homeless for a long time so it came to the end of the road and he had nowhere to go my Grandpa died he was living with my grandpa living with whoever because at this point my uncle's dead my other uncle's in prison my dad's almost dead my grandpa's dead everyone that's in Nicholson is imprisoned or dead except for me and my brother so my dad come back into my life and when it got towards the end my brother agreed to let him move into his house so it was a constant problem you have a drug addict in a house that's on hospice where they give you as much drugs as you want which is okay until the drug addict figures out how to get into the medication and takes all of it so my dad took two months worth or sorry A month's worth of morphine in one sitting and then took all of his Dilaudid in one sitting and passed out for a week so the problem with that is you get in big trouble for that because they want to know where all the medication went and you have to prove where all the medication went so this is just a constant thing with my dad all the time so to make long story short that's always been my thing I have dad issues I I have since the start of and this is just a overview of what had happened it goes far deeper than this because in all this we need to understand people do the best they know how and Jesus says forgive them for they know not what they do why does he say that because you really don't know what you're doing people do the best they know how so you take my mom my mom has two children that are not hers my dad had them with somebody else my mom has two more children that hers with my dad and he leaves she has a four-year-old a six-year-old a 12 year old and a 14 year old and she has to work and take care of all four of these children two of which are not even hers and she didn't do some things she should have done but people do the best they know how and when we can actually see that people do the best that they know how we can start to understand where people are coming from so we take this baggage we take all these things in our Christian walk we get back in the Christian walk and we start to see things through all this and it messes with our heads we don't see anything clearly because you cannot let these things go because this is how it should be handled these people should pay for what they did they have you have legitimate things that happen to you and it has to be answered for it just has to because the world says it should and you think that's how it should be so you hold on to it you want to make sure that this gets handled a certain way so you're walking through this Christian walk with this thing constantly on our shoulder you have chips on your shoulder and it doesn't have to be daddy issues it can be that you're born and raised in the church and somebody said something against your family or somebody said something you don't like and you start to build up these complexes and you start to see everything through these complexes because we can't let it go and we start to wonder why are people the way they are the answer is everybody's weird and you have to figure out why they're weird and they're weird because they have a past because they've been through things that you haven't been through or you might have been through but it's still not the same we love the excuse of you have no idea what I'm going through you have no clue you don't know me you have no idea what I'm going through that I'm sorry but that's a dumb thing to say because I can never know what you're going through you're exactly right you have Gideon my buddy Gideon get in you got a great dad you had a great mom I did not have that you didn't do drugs right good I did so if there was somebody who didn't write it was Gideon Gideon was raised with a good family getting was raised in a good church he's always had it good I've had the opposite of that if you put Gideon in the same situation as me we'll handle a totally different ways because Gideon can never know what I've been through and I can never know what he's been through you can bring me into a drug house and I'll literally be at home because I've been there since I was six years old I know exactly what to say I know exactly what to do I grew up in it I didn't know that that was dysfunctional for a good portion of my life I did not know that that wasn't normal at all but you put Gideon in that situation it's not going to go well Gideon's a really nice kid and he's sensitive right it is born and raised in church they're going to realize he was born and raised in church and it's not going to go well for him at all but on the flip side of that you put me in a functioning family and I don't do well with it and that might sound dumb to you but that's the way it is I don't understand I didn't understand what I should say how is supposed to function I didn't understand how love was supposed to work because I had this thing that I didn't want to let go of and I've seen everything through this thing all the time and I didn't want to let it go because like everyone else whether we want to admit it or not we want to make sure that it gets handled in a certain way so we keep walking through this and we going back to why people are weird people are weird because they have complexes because something happened to them that didn't get dealt with properly and whether they know it or not they see everything through that complex my daddy hurt me my mommy hurt me my pastor hurt me my Deacon hurt me somebody hurt me and you have no idea what I'm going through I understand that I'm sorry that happened to you it shouldn't happen to you but it did and we have to come onto the other side of these things which is not fun at all I haven't told you the rest of the story it's not fun at all but as we go through these things we start to handle things the wrong way and we wonder why everyone's arguing all the time we want to argue all the time especially in the message we should know better but we're arguing all the time we want to fight about brother brennam said this brother Brenham said that brother Brenham this brother brought him this well that was thus saith the Lord that wasn't thus saith Lord that was an opinion we are so stuck on these complexes we constantly want to fight about everything that we can come up with to fight about we want to make sure that we're correcting different things in different places because in the end we're trying to constantly get things off of us and onto somebody else we have to make sure we correct them but you still have a moat or you still have a beam in your eye so we look at what brother Brenham said about it in conferences in 60 he says when we get to the place that we think we're the only ones that God can use we better call a conference God sent Jesus his son to die for every member of the body of Christ Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran catholic whatever they may be they are all God's children by The Promise how are we going to hear the message how are they going to heal the message unless we and he just he Fades off but he says then further down in that same one he says what the Pentecostal church and all the other churches need tonight it's a lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience and the race that sets before us we need a conference a universal prayer meeting for the churches of the Living God to be called together don't think I'm angry or beside myself I know what I speak of the need of the church tonight is a conference a prayer meeting a get-together called together ministers break down their middle wall of partitions church members that will forget the differences between the denominations of the churches church members and ministers hold to the horns of the altar with one Accord and pray until the fire of God begins to fall again God knows that stubbornness and differences of men he has broken up and god-fearingly gets broken up and god-fearingly and brotherly love it takes place in the human heart then you'll become salty then the message will have its parents in the heart it'll have its influence in the city and then further down he says we could scream and shout or do whatever we want and it will never influence men until they see the Life of Christ being projected in you someone who is tender and merciful and forgiving and ready to turn the other side of the cheek or give the second coat or go the Second Mile Christianity in action not just talking from the pulpit but acting among the members among the pastors that's when you see Christ Living in the church but I feel like we press pause in the wrong part of all these we don't want to pay attention because we have an agenda we keep looking through all of our things our complexes we have all of these problems on our shoulders that we've come up with we've come up with we're a little church we're this we're that where the other thing and it starts bringing these complexes and then you start to think that you can actually hold on to people in your church God you cannot hold on to anything you have no ability to do any of that God gave those people who take those people away there is nothing you can do about it it is in God's order that these things happen so in another message I don't have a title on this I can get it to you if you need it and how he says and how did this great pillar fire the angel of God the logos that went out of God that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness when it come among the people it separated itself and great looks of fire began to come upon each one as the pillar of fire began to break up and God dividing himself among his people oh that ought to tear tear the heart of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each of us that all together you see what it means can you see now why I'm standing for Unity of every church every Full Gospel Church every believer we ought to be one heart one mind and one Accord no matter how much we differ in scriptures that might be we might see it this way or see it that way that's nothing to do with it but in principle we ought to stand one Great Mighty Army of God marching on because each one of you in the particular in your peculiarities God has proven that he is ignoring your Doctrine because he gave you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he gave you the Holy Ghost that he gave the Holy Ghost to those who obey him now if I obey him in my peculiar way and you obey him in your peculiar way he give us both the Holy Ghost so we ought to be Christians brothers and sister enough to arm up together and March on for one great purpose the gospel I have come among them and among the brother and out of the Baptist Church and I have seen this great thing and I have never taken sides with any different ones just whatever their belief is is everything I try to stand right in the breach and say we're brothers we're brothers regardless if we can discern the spirit one another and realize if a man comes in I don't care what church he belongs to he's got the spirit of God on him he's my brother I don't care how great he is I don't care how intellectual he is I don't care how powerful he can speak if he's trying to achieve the wrong thing he's not my brother yet but if we are trying to do if we're trying to save souls and doing something for God then he is my brother if he is a Jehovah's Witness he is still my brother if he is a Pentecostal if he has Holiness if he's assume he's a God if he is Church of God if he has Oneness two in his threeness or whatever it might be it's all my brothers and sisters if we got our hearts right with God and we are trying to achieve the same thing for the kingdom and building the kingdom and then God will honor that now brother so we this is what brother Brenham says of it but the problem is we get stuck on things we get stuck on this one should do that this one should do this this is how things should be and the problem with that is is you've literally come up with a rule book in a non-denominational thing you've come up with a rule book of this is the message the message is not a rule book that's the problem is you've denominated you've how you say that word you know what I'm trying to say you've put you made a denomination out of the message because you have a rule book of you got to make sure you get this this and this and this and if your pastor doesn't do this this and this this away then he's not in the group you're not in the cool kids club because you haven't done it the way I've said to do it and you have a spirit no brother you have a spirit of denomination because you want to make a rule book about what is going to happen here and what is going to happen there every church is different every church is Sovereign and that's the way it's supposed to be it's supposed to be like that for a reason so you can go to where you need to get fed so brother Brenham talks about that as well and he says now so he's talking about I just it's really long so I cut out a piece of it but he's talking about speaking in tongues and someone was making fun of people at um Junior Jackson's church so he says now brother Junior Jackson had a right to disagree with that he wants his church the people all want to speak in tongues and things in the audience that's brother of Junior's troubles that's up to him but brother Junior Jackson believes this message is the same as the rest of us do he is one of us he is not a dead bird to go there Junior Jackson is a man of God that I love with all my heart it is not here tonight so I can really pour it out the way I want to and Don ruddle I don't think Don's here tonight either because they got a church of their own but if I seen every person come to this Tabernacle walk out and go to Don ruddles or brother JT Parnell or brother any anything Brothers here that's our brothers here and fellowship of the Kingdom I'd be so happy I wouldn't know what to do I'd say Lord fill this one up back again and let's pour it out again I'd love it I'd love to see those boys they're my children so he's saying that it doesn't matter what the church is doing so if you read this whole this is in questions and answers number 2 and 64. he's he goes to this whole thing about tongues speaking in tongues and brother Junior Jackson's they speak a lot of tongues and they do a lot of that type of thing so brother Branham literally goes through this whole deal of talking about how you don't speak in tongues here you do hear you don't hear he has this whole list of things the way he wants it done to his church and when he gets to the end of that list he says this that brother Junior Jackson can speak in tongues in his church that's fine he says we can they can do whatever they need to do in that church because they're their own church the all the churches are sovereign but we've come with our complexes and all these things and that's all we can look through because we can't let something go something happened to us that we can't let go someone said something to us or we developed it on our own that we've come up with we can handle these situations the problem is we can't handle any situation we have no control over it and if we push it long enough it's it's a hard one to learn but we'll learn it eventually so to go back to my original scripture as you're thinking why did you read that um Luke 23 42 and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when now cometh into thy kingdom so we have all these complexes that we've built up people have legitimately hurt us and they've done all these bad things to us and sometimes they haven't but most of the time these are legitimate things that people have done to us they've done very bad things to us and we want them to be handled in a particular way so if we can bring that up Luke 23 42 and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom so if we look at this this is one of the thieves that's on the cross so again with the same theme this guy is on the cross of Jesus so if you read back in Matthew he's on the cross of Jesus and he actually makes fun of Jesus he starts out by making fun of Jesus and it says in Matthew 27 this is out of the Amplified but it says 27 verse 44 the robbers who had been crucified with him also began to insult him in the same way so this guy is on the cross making fun of Jesus while he's on the cross but he says something changes in him he says Remember Me Lord that's all he says he says remember me so we think and if we go to the next verse verse 4 to 2 and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise so we love that right Jesus forgave this guy he's hanging on the cross he made fun of him and he'd done everything wrong so you can go into this whole we don't have time for it but if you go into a study of how they wrote that out they put thieves but they also call it robbers because in robbers you did something bad the Romans would keep crucifixion for the most part for slaves or if you did something against the Roman government so most likely this guy was a terrorist or he had caused death to Romans so they more likely think that he was a terrorist that caused a terrorist act and he killed a lot of Romans so he's on the cross next to Jesus while making fun of Jesus then turns to him and says remember me so we like this this dude did everything wrong and he's on the cross and Jesus says that he today shalt thou be with me in Paradise it's a beautiful thing but if you change it to your life in that cross what about your abuser on that cross what if this is your abuser what if this is the band that stood against your family what if this is the man that did everything terrible to you or the woman that did everything terrible to you down to everything that you can think of if you had a good childhood there's still things people do to you if you had a bad childhood what if that's your abuser what if that's the person that did the most heinous things to you on that cross it starts to change your mind a little bit about this man and you start to think of the people in the crowd as you're standing there's this man's on the cross and he says Lord remember me and then Jesus has the audacity to stay verily I say unto thee today shall thou be with me in Paradise how could he say that this man beat me this man killed my family this man abused me this man did horrible things in my family this man spoke against everything that we stand for you know what this guy has done do you understand that these people turned against the church do you understand that this person did these terrible things to my children do you understand what this man did that's why he's on the cross because he should be on the cross he deserves to be on the cross he's an abuser that's where he should be he should be there but then Jesus thinks that he's okay by saying verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise why did he say that does he not understand what this man put me through does he not understand that every time we had Christmas it hurt because I knew you were going to steal the toys from me do you not understand that every time you come around I'm worried about what I say because I know you're going to use it against me do you not understand that this is the man that came into our church and changed the whole atmosphere in our church how he poisoned everything that we're trying to do that this is the man that stands against me every time I'm trying to do something good did he not understand that and the short answer is Jesus did understand that and Vengeance isn't yours it's God's you were never supposed to have Vengeance on any of these things but that's the problem is we can never get rid of our thing we've always got this thing with us and we can get little pieces of it we can take little things away we can slowly start to heal up we can slowly start to take things out in to but we still have part of this thing that we can't let go because we don't want to give it to God and we say yes I give them to God but it comes back it came back because you gave it to God on a string you gave it to God and you said here you go you can have that lord I can't handle it anymore take care of it and you start to realize well you know that guy didn't get in any trouble well that guy no one is realizing how bad he is he went to a different church and they love him how can you love that guy you realize what he did in my church and you just pull that thing back lord I mean I tried but you weren't handling it you are handling it so I gotta do what I gotta do you know I gotta handle this thing I gotta make sure that I go to that church and tell everybody Hey listen just so you know I'm just putting it out there I'm just saying I'm not trying to gossip I'm just saying this guy's done some pretty bad stuff in our church I just want you guys to know in brotherly love that's all that's the only reason I'm seeing this there's no other reason I just want to say it because I love you that's why and you pull that thing right back and you can't handle it and the next thing happens and you're in the same situation again Lord here you go Lord I want to let these things go but then you pull it back because whoa Lord you know I gave that thing to you but I kind of thought that guy would get in a bunch of trouble or something like that would happen or you know it's House of burn or if you crashed his car or something bad would happen to him just to pay him back a little bit and you didn't so you bring that thing right back and you hold on to it and you have this thing that you will not let go of because you want it handled in a certain way you want God to do what you think is best but God's ways are not our ways and it's really hard to understand that so we have this man on the cross we've gone through all that he'd done all these terrible things and Jesus lets it go so then you start to think you just let this guy go he didn't say sorry he didn't apologize he didn't even say hey man I messed up a little bit you know kind of sort of you know I'm not saying that you were wrong but I'm saying you were wrong not me the guy didn't say anything right he has done nothing right he did everything wrong he made fun of me didn't apologize for it didn't make anything right and you still let him go to paradise what are you thinking this isn't right this is not how it's supposed to go that's because you've been listening to the world you haven't been listening to the Bible you found these things in your Facebook you found these things in his Twitter you found these things throughout life that have told you well you know that's not fair that's not fair at all this isn't fair it's just not how it's supposed to go is this 50 50. you came up with percentages the Bible never came with percentages if you're going to give 150 give 150 the answer to all these things is love them more you say well he robbed me the Bible literally tells you let him rob you more he sued me give him double what he asked for he wanted my coat give him two of them this dude wants me to walk with him for a mile I'm really tired I ain't got no shoes walk with him for two miles give them more but then we always want to come up with well you know brother you're going to get burned out you got to have balance brother you gotta have balance I completely agree with balance but the problem is you love balance too much you balance your way out of the hard stuff well I'm just being balanced you know it just burns me I want to do things I don't want to do too many things because I want to be balanced about it and I just you know if I keep letting things go people are going to walk all over me I just want to be balanced about it you know I just want to balance everything out you want to balance everything and the problem is you've accomplished nothing because you want to make sure the things you handle the way you want them to get handled and you will disguise it in whatever way you have to to make sure that it's balanced nothing in the Bible tells you to be to be logical nothing in the Bible tells you to be smart about things the Bible tells you to do more I have to be realistic we love this new realistic if I hear realistic one more time I don't know be upset nothing in the Bible told you to be realistic nothing told you nothing told it told you to believe when God walked up on that Shore with two thousand demons he didn't say oh man I really hope this works I don't know hey guy um if you could you know if you think I mean if you're ready if you're ready come down here I just want to have a talk with you put clothes on you know do whatever you got to do I just I just had something to say to you no he walked up on the shore and they came to him and said what are you doing what are you doing why were they doing that because they were scared the demons were scared God wasn't scared but the problem is we walk up with our complexes we weighed ourselves down so far with this complexes we start to walk into these things and we can't understand why these things aren't happening because we're not letting things go we can't walk up to these two thousand demons in confidence we welcome to two thousand demons and we say well you know it's just how it's going to be the rest of your life you got a medical condition no that's not how it's going to be for the rest of your life you know we're just this is the way it's going to go you know if the hopefully the Lord thinks this is the way it's supposed to go this is how it's going to go no it's supposed to go the way that God has it to go and if that's the way that you pray for it to go then it could be the way that it's that it needs to be but we get bound up with these complexes so we come up with all these complexes we come up with all these people should get what they deserve and people shouldn't get what they deserve because if they did you wouldn't be here none of us would be here and I know it's easy for me to say and if you're in church and things might be a little bit different but it's easy for me to say because I come from all this stuff and you start to think well why do they get away with all this stuff why are they allowed to do these bad things and then come in like nothing happened these people struggle with things and they're doing everything that you do with nothing they have don't know God try to do everything you do every single day without God do everything you do every single day without the people in this church you'd be a drug addict you'd be drinking you'd do all the bad things that these people do because we cannot handle it the problem is we constantly think we can handle it we got to make sure hey God just sit down for a second I'll show you how this is done it's not going to go well for you I promise so then we come up with well that's fine Brother you know I can let these things go I mean I've let these things go it doesn't bother me at all doesn't bother me one bit I don't even think about it don't think about it all I let this guy you know he's my brother I love him I let it go when's the last time you talked to him when's the last time you have gone into conversation with any of these people that have hurt you that you've let it go when you walk up to them how much do you hate them and be honest about it we hate people we do we don't understand it but we say things we'll say things like well you know I'm not mad at them you know and they're old and they're they're decrepit and this that and the other and you know I don't have anything against them but if they passed away I mean it wouldn't really mean anything to me don't I mean it's no big deal I'm just saying don't mean anything to me no it should mean something to you that's still a son or daughter of God that is the problem is we constantly want to pull people out of heaven we don't want to put people in heaven we're always well you know I don't want to put them in or out of Heaven well I would just go with they're probably going to heaven if they don't make it well then so what it's fine but if we go with they're probably going to make it to heaven we can start to look at things the right way the way God wants us to look at things so the problem is you won't talk to these people and you say well you know I've let it go brother I just got to be gotta hit my guard you know I just I want to get hurt again I want to this that and the other you came up with that the Bible says 70 times seven times why does it say that it says that because it says keep getting hurt it doesn't say get hurt one time I'm never talking to you again man but I forgive you I'm gonna stand over here in my side I'm not gonna talk to you anymore because you're gonna you're gonna hurt me no it says 70 times seven times it says keep getting hurt and you say Brother Kyle but you know I just I don't want to push it too far so you start to go back into balance again you want to balance things out which again I agree with we should balance things out but we're bouncing too far if you're stuck in this one spot you know I'm just an introvert I'm just introvert that's just not me that's not me I'm just supposed to stand over here in my corner and I just like it I like being alone I don't want to be around other people because I'm an introvert this is my thing no you have something that has hindered you to be an introvert you can be somewhat of an introvert I don't want to say that you can't but I'm just saying when you constantly want to avoid these things it's because you haven't let these things go you haven't learned to let these things go and it's tough It's really tough I can stand up here and tell you to let these things go but how do you do it you have to let give it to God and he has to handle it in whatever way he sees fit and if it's not the way you want which is most likely not the way it's going to go then you have to let it go and if you don't you will always be stuck right there wherever that happened if it's four-year-old you if it's 10 year old you a 15 year old you you will walk through life and you will be 50 years old and you'll get to his point and it'll stop why does it keep stopping because you won't let the hurt go because you are hurt when you're 15 years old because your pastor did something to you when you're 17 years old because someone said something about you when you're 18 years old because someone did something when they were nine and you will always walk back to nine-year-old hurt you you will never make it past that point because you didn't let it go so you say what does it matter I'm not hurting anybody I'm not doing anything I've just got my hurt and I'm I'm happy people say that I'm happy right here I'm just happy in my hurt little world I'm not doing anything the problem is every conversation you have every time you're around somebody that hurt comes out and you don't realize it it's always right there it always wants to come out every time you converse with somebody the way you say things if you can't let go of that hurt that hurt will come out and you could do things to people you have a sword and you have a shield and you can hurt people with that sword you can hurt people that steal because you're holding your thing you can't see through it so you have you're trying to wield your sword and you're trying to hold your Shield but the problem is you can't stop with that sword because you're looking through your thing you know if you would just straighten up if you would just do this it wouldn't have problems anymore if you would just do this and do this I ain't got the problem you got the problem if everyone would just do the right thing I wouldn't have issues anymore no the common denominator is you so you come down to it and this is where I come in my life my dad was a terrible person it just it is what it is in in my dad was never told that he was loved his whole entire life he didn't know how to function and then he had kids and he didn't know how to function and that's why my grandparents had to come get my older brother and sister out of the house because my dad had sold the furnace it's true story so the furnace for drugs and it was cold it was December so my grandparents took the kids out of the house but my dad didn't know how to function he had been hurt so badly in his childhood and he did everything without God he didn't know he did not know what to do and he turned to drugs and that's what he did so it went on we took care of my dad and he continually stole from us and you say Billerica why does any of this matter because if you don't let it go it will ruin your life it will it's the grace of God it's a miracle that I'm here if you don't let it go it will ruin your life so we went on and on with my dad he's stealing constantly stealing guns stealing whatever he could I was buying things from him because he was selling my grandparents stuff to try to get more stuff so I was buying the things from him and he was stealing them from me and reselling them and my grandma was helping them do all these things so we kept going on and on and on so finally he got my brother's debit card and he stole everything on the account it was like four thousand dollars and he said we got mad and we said what are you doing and he said well I'm going to get it back to you it's not a big deal he doesn't make any money he didn't have a plan to get it back he just took it and then he stole a bunch of stuff out of her car so he went to him confronted him about it and we said dad you know what are you doing you can't keep doing this you can't keep doing this and he said you know you kids have always been ungrateful you've been ungrateful your whole lives that's why we have these problems because you're money hungry all you guys want is money it's all you're ever worried about when we're worried about it because we didn't have a house payment to pay for the house that you're living in currently that was the worry big guy but he he blamed it on us it was our fault if we weren't such bad kids this whole time we wouldn't have this problem if you guys would just stop loving money so much I thought you were a Christian I thought you were Christian but all you care about is money as we're cleaning him up because he can't hold anything anymore so we're cleaning up her sheets and he's telling you you're worthless so you hold on to this he's a legitimate things that happen to people and you hold on to this and it makes you angry and you can't function right because you don't know how to love you don't know what love is because you haven't really seen it and you don't want to let these things go because what if somebody does it to me again what if they hurt me again if I let this thing go and let my walls down I have to get hurt again and you do the Bible tells you you have to get hurt again it tells you to get hurt more 70 times seven times it tells you to get hurt more it does so we keep but we keep holding on to these things in I don't it's not a part I want to tell you but I will so we keep going down this road with my dad and we're getting in trouble because he's stealing his own drugs which is weird but we're getting in trouble for it and you're stealing things from us constantly and then it comes down to the end and you think this guy deserves everything he gets when he married my mom he had two children he did not tell my mom about and when they got married he literally said Hey by the bye I kind of have another family just throwing it out there but it'll be fine they're good they're over there we don't have to worry about them no more we'll start a new family and this guy started this generational sin to where everyone is in prison everyone is dysfunctional and it starts from this man he robs from his children he robs everybody he does all these terrible things he does all these terrible things and he deserves to get what he gets he deserves it just like the people that hurt you in your life they deserve it and in the world side of it they do deserve it but the problem is they deserve it just like you deserve it so you keep going and you keep with this hatred I don't care if this guy dies it doesn't bother me one bit I don't care about that person doesn't bother me one bit I don't care what happens to them they did bad things they hurt my family they hurt everybody I don't care I don't care one bit the problem is God cares and you don't get to decide who you care about and don't care about and the problem is if you keep holding on to this it will ruin you it'll bring you to a point where you walk into a hospital and you take a watch off a man that abuse you for your whole life and you take this watch off of him as he's dying and they say this is what he's got this is his watch and you start to think this man deserves what he's getting he deserves what's coming to him and you want to see that like it's a satisfaction like when this person gets hurt it's going to be good for me it's not going to be good for you it'll lead you to a hospital room taking a watch off a man's dying and as this man's dying he can't breathe because he did too many drugs and he smoked too much and his lungs don't work so you sit there and watch him try to breathe for 18 hours and you start to think I just want this to end but you didn't want it to end you wanted it to happen you wanted to make sure that they paid for what they did to you you wanted to make sure that you've seen this thing out this person deserves to get this this person deserves it this is what I wanted but then when you start to go through the punishment that you wanted them to get so badly you start to realize that the love of God comes out and the love of God is telling you I don't want this to happen I want to stop please make it stop but you wanted it to happen so for 18 hours this man is trying to breathe and he's saying help me because he ain't got no help he can't breathe and every 20 minutes he breaks through his medication because his pain tolerances are so high that it does not affecting him at all so they give him more and it doesn't affect him and he pops up and he keeps saying Hell with me so you get to see this face that you wanted to see so bad say help me but the problem is now you're in the punishment side of this and you can't handle it because you were never supposed to handle it you were never supposed to see this part of it but you wanted Vengeance so badly that when you see it you'll realize that you can't handle it and you'll realize that no matter what you do this is not going well and you'll realize that that face you'll wake up and see it all the time you wake up and see this person hurt when you get that love of God you'll start to realize this isn't supposed to happen this way I don't want these people to hurt I hurt why do you continue the hurt it has to stop with you you will continue that through generations you're looking at Kyle West and Nicholson I'm the third generation of hurt my grandpa's dead my dad's dead my uncles are dead the one that's not dead is in prison for the rest of his life because he murdered a man and he murdered a man for the dumbest reason in the whole world but it's this hurt and it just continues on and it will continue on until you say no more I won't have this anymore and you start to realize the real love of God the real love of God that just lets it go it doesn't matter if they get what they deserve it doesn't matter the problem is we like to be the Pharisees we like to think of the adulterous woman that brings us adulterous woman before Jesus and they say hey we found her she was in the very act so she was more likely naked what do you want to do with her Moses says the stoner they were right they weren't wrong she deserved everything she got she was supposed to it's how the rules work Lord you have rules we have to follow him God doesn't have to follow him God does what he wants and the problem is you bring your adulterous woman before the Lord and you say deal with it but make sure you follow these rules but the problem is you're the Pharisee and you want to say I came to church every day I did everything I was supposed to do I know the scriptures inside now I know all this stuff I'm always in Sunday school I'm always staying after I'm making sure everything gets done the way it's supposed to get done and this woman shows up and thinks she can do whatever she wants to do and there's no consequences she needs to pay for what she did and Jesus says nope it's not the way it's going she's not gonna have to pay for anything she did you're still going to go to church you're still going to do all these things you're still going to be the best Christian ever in your eyes and she's not but she doesn't have to pay for these things because God said so and that part bothers us so bad but the problem is God said so in your life God said so in all of our Lives whether you come through this life like ranshack Meshach and Abednego not smelling like smoke or you come through this life doing all the stupidest things you can do I've done the dumbest things you can do I've snorted pixie sticks it's not a good thing don't do that but I've done all the dumb things and whether you come out not smelling like smoke or smelling horrible smoke it doesn't matter God is the one to answer that makes the rules for what happens and God changes them because he's Sovereign and he does what he wants so I'm saying brother why does all this matter the problem is this matters because you're holding on to things as you're walking onto a shore and you're walking on the shore of life and we're going up against two thousand demons every single day and we want this thing to work but the problem is we haven't let anything go we want to make sure we get Vengeance for every last thing that we do but we want to walk up on the shore if you want to walk up on the Storm be victorious let it go let it go right here right now let it go give it to God and whatever happens happens don't worry about it anymore you want to walk up on this Shore and you have a wayward child take them back you have sickness take it back because I said so because God said I could that's why I can come up on this Shore and show up with my shield with my sword and say devil no more I'm not doing it anymore this is done right here right now but the and that is why it matters so we can walk upon that Shore and say go if you read the different things that Jesus said the one who said a single word he walked up against two thousand demons and we can't walk up against one he walked up against 2000 and said go and they said how fast we're out of here if we let these things go and we let God have his way that's how we walk up on that Shore that's how we walk up there and say devil this is how it's going to go it's not going to go how you think it's going to go it's going to go like this this sickness is gone this child is coming back these things are gone these things that hurt me are gone this stress is gone this depression is gone these things are gone because God said they're gone and they're gone I'm not bringing them back I left it there it's all gone we're done with the devil because God said so and it will be a testimony that you tell about getting I don't know if you guys want to sing a song it'd be cool if you did that it's a testimony that you'll tell and you say Brother Kyle but you don't understand I know I can never understand but I can tell you through everything that I've been through that I can tell you for a fact that it's helped one kid and I don't know how much has helped him but I know it's helped him a little bit and I would live every second of my testimony over again I wouldn't change one single thing and you could say how why would you say that you wouldn't change anything just one little bit no because Kyle wouldn't be Kyle if I change any of those things did it hurt yeah it hurt the whole time did I do a lot of dumb things yeah I didn't know how to function with love I didn't like it I was locked up for years it took my dad dying to get me to come out of that locked upness to let them walls down that took my dad dying to do that I say praise God I would live every second of it again if it didn't help one person I would live every second of it again I wouldn't change one single thing because I wouldn't be who I am without it and that is what love looks like it looks like God saying verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise that's what love looks like it doesn't matter what you've done what you're doing I'm not putting people in and out of heaven God says verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise and that's if the musicians want to come that's about what I got but that's what we have leave it here we can leave it here right now there's no reason that we can't Let It Go just let it go let it be a testimony that you'll tell just let it go and you say it sounds so easy because it is God said give it to me he didn't say give it to me with strings he didn't say give it to me with this he didn't say give it to me on these certain terms you got to make sure you come to the altar you got to make sure you sit in your chair you got to make sure you do this that and the other he didn't say any of that stuff he said just give it to me this man's on the cross making fun of Jesus in he didn't do anything right he didn't see anything right and God said okay you'll be there because I said so that's why because I said so because God said so he said verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise because God said so amen let's pray Lord I just thank you Lord for this opportunity Lord I pray Lord that this made sense Lord and help someone Lord I just pray that we understand Lord love Lord a little bit more lord it's such a complex thing Lord but we can love fully Lord we're the only thing that stops us from doing that Lord Lord you have never stopped us from moving to that next level it's always been us to stop us Lord and it is so hard Lord I know that Lord I don't want to diminish from anybody's story Lord Lord but we have to let it go I pray Lord that you work through this Lord Lord we can just leave these things right here right now Lord that we can live Victorious Lord Lord we just praise you for all these things and give you all the glory in it in Jesus name amen amen good I don't know go ahead I surrender all I've seen that one [Music] uh surrender wrong [Music] to thee my blessed savior [Music] surrender [Music] All to Jesus All to Jesus I [Music] surrender all to him [Music] will ever love and trust him it's presence [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh surrender all come on [Music] praise the lord well we certainly been moved into a deeper Dimension and what it means to surrender by the word tonight and listen I don't know what title he Has but he could call that Divine Love or Let It Go and everybody here has something to let go of we heard that tonight can you say everybody here has something to let go of some plant that you're holding in front and you can only see through that plant but I'll tell you uh I don't think I don't know if too many people more qualified to talk about hurts and pains and what it means to Let It Go than what our brother has tonight not too many of us has been through a life quite like that and yet God's love is greater God loved God's love conquers can you say amen and to think that any anything storms that we have to go through in life if we could think of the love of God Jesus said let us go over to the other side because he before he knew the storm was coming how many knows Jesus knew the storm was coming disciples didn't know the certain was coming you didn't know the storms are coming you didn't know somebody was going to abuse you you didn't know the hard life you'd have you didn't know if you would have traded it you could you would have traded it and yet when you come to the love of God he said I wouldn't trade my life if it brought him to the love of God but Jesus knew why he was going to go through the storm and he would go there so he could say let us go over to the inside we're going to make it over no matter what Storm's in the middle and you know why he was getting over there for one Soul one soul that was had two thousand demons in them we're starting to learn more and more about this love of God how many would raise your hand we're starting to know where the depth of this love and I want it don't you I want it with all my heart and tonight you can receive you can let it go you can I I appeal to you tonight this is not just a win the Lord is present Among Us he's calling you to a greater life a Deeper Life in the love of God he's calling you to that and there's a reason why you're here tonight there's a reason why God's called you to this and he went for one Soul on the other side and sometimes our life and I'll just say this about Brother Kyle let me appreciate the word tonight let's give let's give the Lord a hand for this word this is special tonight amen [Music] sometimes we go through storms that are alive but God has maybe another soul in mind so wouldn't it be fine whatever our hurts and pains whatever storms we go through I would say this whatever I've been through and I've been through some of the things not similar to him Kyle and I are different Lifestyles like day and night maybe that's why we work well together because God's brought all types in the body of Christ I lived a pretty sheltered life but but I have my stuff I have my hurts I have my pains people said things against me so all of us got to come to this Victory to say I got to let it go and I gotta love people no matter what they've done and I gotta quit putting people out of heaven when Jesus my master is putting people in how much of this do we have in our own ranks of finding reasons to put somebody out when Jesus was looking for reasons to put people in but I would love it that I would go through all my hurts and pains in life and get to the end let it all go and I would love it that my life would bring one soul to the cross how may raise your hand if my life I live my all my trials all my storms it would bring one soul to the kingdom of God that'd be worth it to me and that's the way Jesus love is he's willing to go the whole clear cross for one soul I thank the Lord so much praise the Lord I'm just going to pray and I just thank the Lord for this tonight you you I don't care where you're at this evening I don't care where you're at this is something this was a message for everybody everybody he'll find you where you're at and like the brother said Sunday he'll call you he loves you he's calling you just respond to the call you don't have to do everything right yet you have to do anything right just respond to the call and let God's love do the rest he loves you tonight praise be to God I'm just going to pray and then he can sing this song I'll testify sing a couple courses of it before you go home and just to ponder these things we appreciate the word when I hear things like this he drops so many bombs tonight that I want to preach on every one of the points continue drop some bombs for sure praise the Lord Lord Jesus thank you we're certainly drawing you're certainly real you're here tonight we can't deny it and Lord it's by the testimony of someone like this impossible Paul in the Bible was an impossible Comfort there's no way he would come to Christ and yet he did some of the most impossible cases is the ones that you're trying to call because of their testimony will bring many others to Christ something changed the life that seemed like it was unchangeable some somebody got Divine love and Let It Go when there was absolutely no reason for them to let it go they had every right to seek Vengeance and your love was Stronger it's the greatest force in the world may we learn tonight Lord may we sit at your feet and learn to love nothing comes out of these vessels no response except Divine love I pray name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask him amen praise the Lord God bless you tonight sing a few courses a great song and I think it's a good capping to the service tonight God bless you [Music] oh and it's hard to see what you are doing here [Music] oh but I know but down through theirs I'll look on this
