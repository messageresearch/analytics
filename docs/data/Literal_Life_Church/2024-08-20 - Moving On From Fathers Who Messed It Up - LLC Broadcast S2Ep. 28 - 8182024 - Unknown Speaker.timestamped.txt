[5:48] Jesus
[5:53] Jesus
[5:56] oh Jesus
[5:59] [Music]
[6:06] come here to me
[6:10] closer to me
[6:16] [Music]
[6:18] Jesus
[6:22] Jesus here in Deuteronomy chap 1 and
[6:26] verse
[6:28] 34 says and the Lord heard the voice of
[6:31] your words and was wroth and swear
[6:32] saying surely there shall not one of
[6:35] these men of this evil generation see
[6:39] that good land which I swear to give
[6:41] unto your fathers now this is a pretty
[6:44] stern word from the Lord and if you if
[6:47] you know the setting this is speaking to
[6:49] the new generation and it's speaking
[6:51] also to the generation that came out
[6:53] under a prophet and they had acted so
[6:57] childish and dealt with the message so
[6:59] wrong that God says that generation
[7:02] they're not even going to be able to go
[7:04] into the land he says this he called it
[7:07] an evil generation I didn't but it
[7:09] became evil and these were people that
[7:10] had come under a prophet's message but
[7:13] they became an evil generation and they
[7:15] shall not see the good land which I
[7:17] swear to give unto your fathers save
[7:19] Caleb the son of Jep he he shall see it
[7:22] and Caleb was old so he's one of the old
[7:24] guys that got included and to to him
[7:27] will I give the land that which that he
[7:29] hath trotten upon and to his children
[7:33] because he hath wholly followed the Lord
[7:37] now here's the distinction an old man
[7:39] gets in out of the old generation for
[7:41] one thing he's wholly followed me in
[7:44] other words you can't do this by being
[7:46] one foot in and one foot out God knows
[7:49] that you can't be second guessing the
[7:51] rest of your life you got to be all in
[7:55] and all that old generation one day one
[7:58] day they were in one day they were out
[8:00] if they ran out of food they say oh we
[8:02] should have been back in Egypt and
[8:03] they're up and down you don't know where
[8:04] they stand from day to day but there's
[8:06] some old guys like Caleb and said I'm
[8:08] all in I'm ready to go to my
[8:11] promise so because he wholly followed
[8:14] the Lord and it's just that simple he
[8:16] was Allin I believe this thing
[8:19] 110% I believe the promise of us going
[8:22] in land I don't want to go there so
[8:24] Caleb you get included and also the Lord
[8:26] was angry with me for your sakes Moses
[8:29] said the the Lord got angry with me
[8:31] saying thou also shall not go in Moses
[8:34] said God told me I can't even go
[8:37] in Prophet can't even go in because of
[8:40] his anger but Joshua the son of none
[8:42] which shall stand standeth before me he
[8:45] shall go in thither encourage him for he
[8:48] shall Co cause Israel to inherit it so
[8:51] the the the Holy Ghost Ministry after
[8:53] the prophets gone will be used the
[8:55] Joshua ministry will be used to help
[8:58] encourage and bring the people into the
[9:00] land moreover there's another class
[9:03] included your little
[9:08] ones the new
[9:10] generation I'm including
[9:13] them they get to go
[9:15] in praise be to
[9:19] God your little ones which he said
[9:21] should be a prey remember back in Egypt
[9:24] and they ran out of water and they do
[9:26] and in front of their kids they said we
[9:28] should go back to Egypt our kids are
[9:30] going to be appr prey to all the animals
[9:31] and they're all going to die and and
[9:33] they were complaining that's what their
[9:34] fathers were saying but God said no
[9:36] they're still here and guess what they
[9:38] get to go in and you
[9:40] don't hate to be so Stern about it
[9:42] that's what God's saying your little
[9:44] ones that you said would be destroyed in
[9:47] the wilderness they weren't destroyed
[9:49] because I was watching over them and
[9:52] guess what I'm taking them into the
[9:53] Promised
[9:55] Land by the way they didn't earn
[9:57] anything those kids to get that place in
[9:59] the pr land God's grace just said I'll
[10:01] take them
[10:03] in he said which in that day had no
[10:06] knowledge between good and evil look at
[10:08] the children they had no knowledge
[10:10] between good and evil they shall go in
[10:12] thither and unto them will I give it and
[10:15] they shall possess it praise the Lord
[10:19] now I want to add in Hebrews chapter 3
[10:22] in Hebrews Paul refers to this
[10:25] generation that God was grieved with
[10:28] Hebrews chapter
[10:30] 3 and verse
[10:33] 8 and throughout the Bible God in Psalms
[10:38] in Proverbs All Through the Bible he
[10:40] refers to the fathers Jesus referred to
[10:43] the Jews fathers your fathers and most
[10:45] of the time it wasn't good your fathers
[10:48] because I want to talk about this
[10:49] morning moving on from fathers who
[10:51] messed it
[10:53] up that's my title moving on from
[10:56] fathers who mess it up because it keeps
[10:58] returning referring to the fathers the
[11:00] fathers did this so the new generation
[11:03] had a challenge that they had to respect
[11:06] their fathers but they could not move on
[11:08] to their promise unless they exited
[11:11] certain characteristics of their fathers
[11:14] and Jesus was Stern about it he looked
[11:16] at the Jews and says your fathers ate
[11:18] Mana in the wilderness and they're
[11:21] dead I am the bread of
[11:23] life I'm not a temporal
[11:27] blessing that you get and then when you
[11:29] don't get it oh what happened God
[11:31] where's the Mana they ate off a Mana but
[11:32] it's only a temporal blessing this group
[11:35] shall not eat off a temporal blessing
[11:37] they'll eat off the Eternal bread of
[11:38] life amen he said Harden not your hearts
[11:41] verse 8 as in the provocation that's
[11:44] from the word provoke the people
[11:46] provoking God in the day of Temptation
[11:47] in the wilderness when the your fathers
[11:49] tempted me your fathers I want you to
[11:51] remember that term your fathers tempted
[11:54] me proved me and they saw my works for
[11:57] 40 years wherefore I was grieved with
[12:00] that generation and said how do they do
[12:03] always air in their
[12:06] where there's something wrong with the
[12:09] heart there's air in their heart and
[12:13] they have not known my ways this is a
[12:17] generation that could celebrate the
[12:19] works they love the works of God but
[12:23] they never learn the ways of God his
[12:26] character so I swear in my wrath they
[12:29] shall not enter into my arrest take heed
[12:33] Brethren lest there be any of you an
[12:35] evil heart of unbelief and departing
[12:37] from the Living God but exhort one
[12:39] another daily while it is called today
[12:41] lest any of you be hardened through the
[12:44] deceitfulness of sin remember that's not
[12:46] sin smoking and drinking that's unbelief
[12:48] unbelief hardens your heart you start to
[12:52] disbelieve things of God you start
[12:53] getting your heart
[12:54] hardened don't do that don't let your
[12:56] heart become hard your heart's supposed
[12:58] to be free can you say Amen but unbelief
[13:02] if you keep holding on to it will harden
[13:04] your heart don't let that happen take e
[13:07] brotherr lest there be an evil any of
[13:08] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[13:10] departing from the Living God but exhort
[13:13] one another daily wi do called today
[13:14] lest any of you should be hardened to
[13:16] the deceitfulness of sin for we are made
[13:19] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[13:21] beginning of our
[13:22] confidence steadfast Until the End while
[13:25] it is said today if ye will hear his
[13:28] voice Harden not your hearts as in the
[13:31] provocation so I want to speak on the
[13:34] new generation a little bit last Sunday
[13:36] we talked about fathers and God being a
[13:39] father to you I will be a father to you
[13:41] but I do want to speak about the new
[13:43] generation in the relation to what they
[13:46] had to deal with in the their fathers
[13:51] and uh you know God always has his eye
[13:55] on the new generation am
[13:59] God does not hold the sins of the
[14:01] fathers on
[14:03] them uh but he gives them a chance to
[14:07] make it
[14:08] better I know the scripture many of you
[14:11] thought of when I said that is what
[14:12] about the scripture that says the sins
[14:14] of the fathers are visited upon the
[14:17] children to the third and fourth
[14:19] generation how many know that scripture
[14:21] some of you thought of that when I said
[14:24] that God doesn't hold the sins of the
[14:26] father on the new generation but he
[14:27] gives them a chance to make it better I
[14:30] know the scripture that says the sins of
[14:32] the fathers and actually that scripture
[14:34] shows us the power of a of the father's
[14:38] influence upon a life that if the
[14:40] father's not right or does some things
[14:42] wrong it has residual effects for many
[14:47] generations can you say amen that's
[14:48] Bible now it has the residual effects
[14:51] for many many generations and it it
[14:54] shows how powerful the residual effect
[14:57] can be the sins of the father fathers
[14:59] can be visited and that's why our family
[15:02] life in America is broke down today
[15:04] that's why marriages are broke down
[15:06] today many times it goes back to men who
[15:09] lose their place men who lose men who
[15:12] exit the home last Sunday we talked
[15:14] about God talking about the fatherless
[15:17] he always was concerned about the
[15:19] fatherless there's something about it
[15:21] that the fatherless whether by uh
[15:24] whether by death or whether by exiting
[15:26] the home or whether not being the right
[15:29] kind of father or whether it's Father's
[15:31] abusing the family or whether the
[15:33] father's provoking the children how many
[15:35] you know the Bible talks about that
[15:37] there's several reasons why a child can
[15:39] be fatherless even when a father is
[15:40] physically in the home and this has
[15:42] residual effects I'm I'm reading an
[15:44] article here that I will not comment too
[15:47] much about this morning because it's 27
[15:49] pages but I've been very moved by some
[15:51] of the statistics and the the the
[15:54] emphasis this man this professor gives
[15:57] about he calls this article a world
[16:00] without fathers and in the 1990s he goes
[16:03] goes back and does the statistics
[16:04] starting from the 1960s when we began
[16:07] with a lot of divorces we then the 70s
[16:10] and ' 80s we got into a lot of unwed
[16:12] mothers in other words there was
[16:14] somebody who fathered them but he was ex
[16:16] he wasn't a part of the family so now
[16:18] you keep going to abuse and you keep
[16:20] going to women now that live on their
[16:21] own and you got many scenarios that
[16:24] remove the father actually Hollywood uh
[16:28] discredit
[16:29] the position of a
[16:31] father seemed like I should be having
[16:33] some more amens here this morning this
[16:35] generation has had an attack and not
[16:37] only the families and the word of God
[16:39] but the residual effect of that is to
[16:41] attack the fathers that children most of
[16:43] us did not grow up with a perfect father
[16:46] most of us grow up fatherless even if
[16:48] you had a good father you're still
[16:50] spiritually fatherless because you
[16:52] haven't met your true Heavenly Father
[16:54] until you come back in contact with him
[16:57] and he tells you I will be a father to
[16:59] you glory be to God aren't you glad if
[17:01] you didn't have a good father this
[17:03] morning he said I will be a father to
[17:05] you you'll be my children I'll take you
[17:08] in my arms and I'll nurture you whatever
[17:10] you were missing I'll provide through my
[17:14] fatherhood glory be to God and so now
[17:17] this I I like I said I don't want to
[17:19] read much of it the decline of
[17:21] fatherhood is one of the most basic
[17:23] unexpected and extraordinary social
[17:25] trends of our time its Dimensions can be
[17:27] captured in a single statistic in just
[17:30] three decades between 1960 and 1990 the
[17:32] percentage of children living apart from
[17:34] biological fathers more than doubled
[17:37] from 177% to 36% by the turn of the
[17:40] century nearly 50% of American children
[17:42] may be going to sleep each evening
[17:44] without being able to say good night to
[17:46] their dads no one predicted this trend
[17:48] few researchers or government agencies
[17:51] have monitored it and is not widely
[17:53] discussed even today but the decline of
[17:56] fatherhood is a major force behind many
[17:59] of the most many of the most disturbing
[18:02] problems that plague American society
[18:05] crime and delinquency premature
[18:08] sexuality out of wedlock births to
[18:11] teenagers deteriorating educational
[18:13] achievement depression substance abuse
[18:16] an alienation among adolescents and the
[18:19] growing number of women and children in
[18:21] poverty and this is through research
[18:23] this many of these things came because a
[18:25] father wasn't present that's right
[18:29] the current generation of Children and
[18:30] Youth may be the first in our nation's
[18:32] history to be less well off
[18:34] psychologically socially economically
[18:37] and morally than their parents were at
[18:39] the same age the United States observes
[18:41] Senator Daniel Patrick he said may maybe
[18:44] this may be the first Society in history
[18:46] in which children are distinctly worse
[18:48] off than their adult than the adults
[18:51] even as This calamity unfolds our
[18:53] cultural view of fatherhood itself is
[18:55] changing few people doubt the
[18:57] fundamental importance of mothers but
[19:00] fathers more and more the question of
[19:02] whether fathers are really necessary is
[19:04] being raised many would answer no and
[19:07] maybe not and to the degree that fathers
[19:10] are still thought uh and to the degree
[19:13] that and to the to the degree that
[19:14] fathers are still thought necessary
[19:17] fatherhood is said by many to be merely
[19:19] a social role that others can play
[19:22] mothers can play it Partners stepfathers
[19:24] uncles and aunts grandparents perhaps
[19:26] the script can even be Rewritten and the
[19:29] whole role changed or dropped this is
[19:31] the devil's work because when you re
[19:33] remove the true image of a father you
[19:36] removing something that God created from
[19:39] the beginning and every human being
[19:41] needs
[19:42] it or they feel insecure they have fears
[19:47] they can't approach life with security
[19:50] when the father's
[19:52] absent or they don't have a right father
[19:54] they were abused by their father there
[19:57] was a time in past when father lessness
[19:59] was far more common than it is today but
[20:01] death was to blame back in the 17th
[20:04] century they hit a time and and when we
[20:06] went through the wars there was a lot of
[20:07] women a lot of men were killed so
[20:09] because of death the fathers weren't
[20:12] present but today not divorce dissertion
[20:15] out of wedlock births in early 17th
[20:17] century Virginia only estimated
[20:19] 31% of white children reached 18 uh with
[20:24] both parents still alive that percentage
[20:26] climbed to 50% by the early 18th century
[20:28] to 72 72% by the turn of the present
[20:31] century and close to its current level
[20:35] by 1940 today well over 90% of Americans
[20:39] youngsters reach 18 with two living
[20:41] parents almost all of today's fatherless
[20:43] children have fathers who are alive well
[20:47] and perfectly capable of shouldering the
[20:50] responsibilities of fatherhood but they
[20:52] have exited for many reasons they have
[20:55] exited they're physically alive
[20:57] somewhere but they're not not being
[21:00] fathers so you know I could go on and on
[21:04] but you you can read these things it's
[21:06] it's called A World Without fathers and
[21:08] we live in a world without fathers and
[21:10] so now I want to take the spiritual side
[21:12] today but most of the generation most of
[21:14] the generation has daddy issues and that
[21:18] affects them most of our generation
[21:20] including within the church has daddy
[21:23] issues sometimes unresolved from the
[21:26] past and besides all the the absent
[21:29] father the dead father the divorced
[21:32] father the father that's alive but he
[21:33] won't come and see his children then you
[21:35] have fathers living in the home that are
[21:38] not taking up their role as fathers
[21:40] they're they're they're they're working
[21:42] but they're not connected at all with
[21:44] their children so you got that issue so
[21:46] they're there but they're not really
[21:47] there then you have abuse which I have
[21:49] things that show the fruits from a
[21:52] father abusing the kids whether
[21:54] physically or abusing the mom physically
[21:56] or abusing them mentally or of using
[21:59] them economically where he's not
[22:00] providing so you have that and then let
[22:03] me bring up just one in the Bible That's
[22:05] not mentioned by this professor and that
[22:07] is fathers who provoke their children to
[22:11] anger this is
[22:13] detrimental and God said in Ephesians it
[22:15] says that fathers don't provoke don't
[22:17] stir up don't do the things that make
[22:20] more anger in your children teach them
[22:23] gu give them guidance rebuke them but
[22:25] love them can you say Amen give
[22:27] affection to them
[22:30] them but don't provoke them and God says
[22:33] that because even when he's pre present
[22:36] provoking the children this can have
[22:39] long-term effects by how the father acts
[22:43] is this okay with
[22:45] everybody so you know going back to the
[22:48] scripture the the is true that that the
[22:51] if you bring up Exodus 25 we have that
[22:53] scripture because some of you may be
[22:55] thought of it the iniquities of the
[22:57] fathers and sins of the fathers of built
[22:59] is is trickles down to the the uh the
[23:02] children to the third and fourth
[23:03] generation I want to just clarify it
[23:05] though because Exodus 20 and verse 5 if
[23:07] you guys have that back there we'll just
[23:09] read it I didn't have it here Exodus 20
[23:11] and verse 5 let's see if that's the one
[23:13] and thou shalt not bow thyself to them
[23:15] nor serve them for I the Lord God am a
[23:18] jealous God visiting the iniquity of the
[23:20] fathers upon the children unto the third
[23:23] and fourth generation of them that hate
[23:27] me now that's that let's skip to Exodus
[23:31] 34 and7 and see how it's worded Exodus
[23:35] 34:7 so these are saying that just
[23:38] because you're a third and fourth
[23:39] generation doesn't mean you get a free
[23:41] pass the sins of the fathers can be
[23:42] visited upon you how many's ever known
[23:45] people that can't stand their father but
[23:47] they start acting like him and they
[23:48] start abusing their
[23:50] children the power effect I don't want
[23:53] to do that I hate that and they start
[23:54] doing it themselves they start treating
[23:56] their children the same way because see
[23:58] without without the Holy Ghost without a
[24:00] power the life of Jesus Christ in you
[24:02] there's nothing to break that but
[24:05] thankfully for the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:07] there's something that can brace the
[24:08] curse this is but look how it's worded
[24:10] here keeping Mercy for thousands
[24:13] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[24:17] sin and that will by no means clear the
[24:19] guilty so in other words he's a loving
[24:21] father he's he forgives iniquity in
[24:24] transgression and sin will by no means
[24:26] clear the guilty visiting the iniquity
[24:28] of the fathers upon the children upon
[24:29] the children's children upon the unto
[24:31] the third and fourth generation it says
[24:33] it again but it's it's prefaced it's
[24:35] it's it's the verse thing he says is
[24:37] that God is a merciful god he forgives
[24:40] iniquity so when when the new generation
[24:43] can come to God and say God forgive me
[24:47] let me not continue
[24:49] this God forgives the iniquity of the
[24:52] fathers and doesn't visit it upon the
[24:54] children God's Mercy is the answer can
[24:56] you say amen amen in other words mercy
[24:59] and forgiveness has the power to break
[25:03] curses I'm going to say it again as
[25:05] simple as it is you were looking for a
[25:07] great Revelation this morning and a
[25:09] great thing here's a revelation for you
[25:12] take a hold of it can you say Amen that
[25:15] that that mercy and forgiveness true
[25:18] mercy and forgiveness with God and with
[25:21] fathers and with parents has the power
[25:24] to break curses if you go to the mercy
[25:27] and forgiveness of the father it can
[25:28] break curses generational curses are
[25:31] broken by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[25:34] Christ gener I don't care how deep it is
[25:37] I don't care how bad it is generational
[25:40] curses are broken by the blood of Jesus
[25:43] Christ God DS in in a realm of motives
[25:46] and intense the word of God is quick and
[25:48] powerful and sharper than any s and
[25:50] deserves the thoughts and intents of the
[25:52] heart the motives the intents the deeper
[25:54] part why am I doing this why do I have
[25:56] such nervousness it may be for other
[25:58] reasons why am I feeling insecure my
[26:01] whole life why am I fearful all the time
[26:03] and you have to go deep within yourself
[26:05] God reveal it to me so that something
[26:08] deep down there the motive the attent is
[26:10] just this thing that keeps irritating me
[26:12] and making me emotionally unstable for
[26:15] Life go to the core and go with God and
[26:17] say God reveal it to me and if something
[26:19] has been done in the past that is
[26:22] affecting me I need to find the power of
[26:25] the cross of Jesus Christ Lord you've
[26:28] forgiven me but I need more of the power
[26:30] of the cross I need it to help my
[26:33] anxiety can I get an amen this morning I
[26:36] need more than just to know I'm forgiven
[26:38] and that's good but I need the power to
[26:40] relieve me of past anxiety that I can be
[26:44] what I was supposed to be and that's
[26:46] free free in my heart free in my mind
[26:51] and then when I come up against it again
[26:52] because we can be set free and the
[26:54] devil's got something for something else
[26:57] tomorrow for us
[26:59] because he don't want you free so
[27:01] something else pops up that's when you
[27:03] have the courage to say the same God
[27:06] that delivered me yesterday is the same
[27:08] God can help me today and Christ can
[27:10] come and change impossible things I love
[27:14] to be around more and more a group of
[27:15] people and we have some sitting here

[27:24] divorced home they come from a father
[27:26] that didn't do it right but they're
