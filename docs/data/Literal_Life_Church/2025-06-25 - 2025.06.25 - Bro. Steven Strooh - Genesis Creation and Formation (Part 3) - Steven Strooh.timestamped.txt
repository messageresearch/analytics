[10:06] Lord. Let's sing this one. It gets
[10:08] sweeter
[10:10] as the days go by. Why don't we greet
[10:14] each other tonight in the name of love
[10:15] sweeter

[11:15] sweeter,
[11:16] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. As the days
[11:19] go by, first verse.
[11:22] The more that I trust him, the more that
[11:24] I love him. Nothing good for me will
[11:26] deny.
[11:28] The longer I know him, the better I can
[11:30] show him. Couldn't stop. Now if I try,
[11:33] oh, it gets sweeter
[11:36] as the days go by.
[11:40] It gets sweeter

[11:45] His love is richer, deeper,
[11:49] fuller, sweeter. Oh, sweeter, sweeter,
[11:53] sweeter. As the days go by, second
[11:56] verse. The moment he saved me, his good
[12:00] grace he gave me. His face is love in my
[12:03] heart. His great joy in knowing to him
[12:06] I'm going. And never more for him to
[12:08] depart. Oh, it gets sweeter
[12:12] as the days go by.
[12:15] Oh, it gets sweeter
[12:17] as the moments fly.
[12:21] Oh, love is richer, deeper,
[12:25] fuller, sweeter. Oh, sweeter, sweeter,
[12:29] sweeter as the day. One more time. Oh,
[12:33] it gets sweeter
[12:35] as the days go by.
[12:39] It gets sweeter. Oh, as the moments fly
[12:42] by.

[23:18] description
[23:22] majesty
[23:23] [Music]
[23:25] from
[23:27] above.
[23:29] Last time I stand and I stand.
[23:34] I stand
[23:36] in all of you.
[23:40] Yes, I stand.
[23:43] I stand
[23:45] in all of you.
[23:49] Holy God
[23:52] to whom
[23:54] all praise is due.
[23:58] I stand
[24:00] in all
[24:03] of you.
[24:08] Amen. Lord bless you all. Wonderful to
[24:11] be here. It's nice to see all the
[24:13] smiling faces.
[24:16] I'm just checking some of them are not
[24:18] smiling, but that's because they found
[24:20] out I was preaching. So, no, it's good
[24:23] to it's good to see everybody. And um
[24:26] I'm just going to get hooked up. Let's
[24:28] turn in our Bibles uh while we're
[24:29] standing. Uh Genesis chapter 2 and we're
[24:32] continuing in this um uh series um which
[24:38] uh I'm finding that um actually
[24:43] uh doing things or covering things I
[24:45] haven't done for either at all or for a
[24:48] long time. So it's been quite
[24:50] encouraging to me at least. I hope it
[24:52] will be for you too. uh Genesis chapter
[24:55] 2 and we'll just uh read the first three
[24:57] verses. And the heavens and the earth
[25:01] were finished and all the host of them.
[25:04] And on the seventh day, God ended his
[25:05] work which he had made. And he rested on
[25:08] the seventh day from all his work which
[25:10] he had made. And God blessed the seventh
[25:13] day and sanctified it because that in it
[25:16] he had rested from all his work which
[25:18] God created and made. So let's uh bow
[25:23] our heads. Heavenly Father, we just pray
[25:25] you would bless your word to our hearts,
[25:27] Lord. And as we heard on Saturday, Lord,
[25:30] we want to give you consent, Lord, to
[25:32] come this evening, Lord, to speak to us
[25:34] and to bring us into your presence,
[25:37] Lord, and to give us everything that we
[25:39] have need of, Lord. And may we just
[25:40] boldly claim those things that we need,
[25:44] Lord, from your abundance, Lord.
[25:47] We know that we can't even we can't even
[25:49] think or ask any more than you're able
[25:51] to provide us, Lord. And so, we just
[25:54] want to be bold and and be strong this
[25:56] evening in our faith, Lord, as we
[25:58] believe that you are a God that can do
[26:02] all the things that we need. From the
[26:04] very beginning, those attributes were in
[26:06] you. And so, Lord, even this evening, we
[26:08] we pray Lord for uh clarity of mind. We
[26:11] we pray Lord for for understanding and
[26:14] for revelation of your word Lord. We ask
[26:16] it all in Jesus name. Amen. You may be
[26:19] seated.
[26:21] Right. So
[26:25] um
[26:27] looks like we're making steps to
[26:33] get hooked up.
[26:35] And uh I just wanted to mention
[26:38] something which I I didn't u put in my
[26:40] in my notes. Um in verse three um if you
[26:44] look at that he says that he rested from
[26:47] all these works which he had made. And
[26:51] it looks like brother Ike's on his way.
[26:56] It it only it only doesn't work when
[26:58] brother Ike's here. If he's not here it
[27:00] works fine. So it looks like they're
[27:04] trying to keep you in a job, brother
[27:05] Ike. So maybe power or something down
[27:08] there. So what I find interesting from
[27:12] this is that we've been talking about
[27:14] Genesis 1 as a type um of uh as brother
[27:18] Renim says of the believer and um
[27:21] starting with seeing the light and then
[27:24] uh um the sanctification process and
[27:28] then of course the baptism of the Holy
[27:30] Spirit on the third day when life comes
[27:32] into the seed and then um you know and
[27:35] then on the fourth day he places us. He
[27:39] positions us. It's adoption. And it's uh
[27:43] it's it's clear it's clear from this
[27:45] pattern that's laid out in Genesis 1 um
[27:48] that uh that's the final stage before
[27:53] the creation of man. You see what I'm
[27:57] saying? So if we spiritualize that, if
[28:00] you like, then the creation of man would
[28:02] be that change in the body because
[28:04] that's a spiritual form. when we we
[28:06] heard something that brother Brandham
[28:08] said that I must say even at that time
[28:10] was a little bit uh new to me and that
[28:13] was um that when God uh expressed
[28:17] himself in the logos he he he wrapped
[28:19] that logos brother Renom says he he uh
[28:22] let's just use the word wrapped the
[28:24] logos in a physical form but he said not
[28:28] like his resurrected body that could eat
[28:30] and drink it's a physical form but it's
[28:33] a it's it's a theophonic form
[28:36] And uh that's what that that creation
[28:39] was there in Genesis chapter 1. And
[28:42] that's what we're going back to is we're
[28:44] going we're finding our way back to that
[28:47] theophony that was in the mind of God
[28:50] from the foundation of the world. Amen.
[28:53] And um how we doing? Aha. Thank you. Got
[28:57] it. Yep. Thanks, brother Ike. Yeah. I
[29:01] was going to ask for a round of
[29:02] applause, but I don't think so.
[29:05] So um oops.
[29:13] Oh no, not that again. Um let me uh exit
[29:17] here and um I just want to do this
[29:20] manually and see if it makes a
[29:21] difference.
[29:23] Uh yeah. Okay, it should be there.
[29:27] Nope, it's all the same. There we go.
[29:30] That was good. It should be that um that
[29:34] screen
[29:36] uh the lovely looks like a scene in
[29:39] Italy. So it's intermittent.
[29:43] Okay. Sure. Okay. I I can keep talking.
[29:48] I'm I'm good at that.
[29:51] So that's that um that pattern laid out
[29:55] in Genesis chapter 1 that ends with um
[29:58] man uh a couple of different things. One
[30:02] is uh coming back into the image of that
[30:05] God had for him from the foundation of
[30:07] the world, right? That that theophony.
[30:09] Um and then the second uh part of that
[30:12] is that if we if we understand that um
[30:17] uh that was male and female then we have
[30:20] a picture which is going to come up
[30:22] later on in the slides is that
[30:27] it's a picture of Christ and his bride.
[30:30] So when we when we when we read of this
[30:33] um we actually
[30:35] um get get a when we read chapter one we
[30:39] get this very clear picture of the way
[30:41] things are um going to be. It's almost
[30:44] like as I said last time it's like
[30:47] Genesis is a is the DNA of of the whole
[30:50] gospel. It's got all the things in it
[30:53] that are needed to bring the whole
[30:55] program of God to pass. And now we're
[30:57] going to look at that again here in
[30:59] chapter 2. But I wanted you to notice
[31:01] this verse three where he said he rested
[31:05] from all his works. Now if that's us at
[31:08] the end of chapter 1 when God makes
[31:12] creates man male and female and then he
[31:15] says he rested from all his works. And
[31:19] guess what? That's when God's going to
[31:21] rest from all his works is when we're
[31:23] united again with Christ. And then we
[31:26] actually are this one body that he
[31:29] envisaged from the beginning. Now when
[31:31] he splits Adam and Eve up um that was
[31:34] the beginning of trouble. We know that.
[31:36] So bringing it back together is going to
[31:38] be the end of the trouble. Right? And
[31:41] we'll get to that in a little while. But
[31:43] the point is he rested from all his
[31:45] work. Now I want to say this. If we
[31:47] believe where we're at, can we rest? Can
[31:51] we rest the way God rested? Now remember
[31:54] in Hebrews chapter 4 it says that um
[31:57] that we have now entered into his rest
[32:01] and we rest the way God rested. That's
[32:04] what Paul says. And how did God rest?
[32:06] What do we know about his rest? He never
[32:09] went back to his works of creation
[32:11] again. It was a done deal in the mind of
[32:13] God. And that's sometimes hard for us
[32:15] time time bound people to imagine is
[32:19] that this is all done. This is all done.
[32:22] everything that we're going through,
[32:24] it's it's all done. And all we're doing
[32:27] is going through a process to get to the
[32:30] all done part, but it's all done. And
[32:32] God rested and we can rest. Praise God.
[32:36] So, we can get started now with the real
[32:38] service. But that was enough. I think we
[32:40] can go home, brother Paul. Either that
[32:42] or we're here until 10:00. So, I'm going
[32:44] to have to um browse through these
[32:47] slides in normal uh uh battle speed. Um,
[32:51] but I may have to leave out some things.
[32:53] I told Brother Paul we may have a mutiny
[32:55] if you find out I've left out stuff. So
[32:58] anyway, but I think we'll have another
[32:59] mutiny if we go on too long. All right.
[33:01] So last time uh just to summarize, we we
[33:04] talked about things um that would help
[33:07] our understanding when we get to Genesis
[33:10] chapter 2 and then Genesis chapter 3,
[33:12] which we're not going to get to tonight.
[33:15] But notice that God says at the end of
[33:18] chapter one everything that um uh sorry
[33:23] before that at the end of when he's
[33:26] created all the all the vegetation all
[33:28] these things the fifth day the animals
[33:30] everything and he talks about the food
[33:32] that they would eat and then he says
[33:34] that it's all good. So problem is what
[33:38] about this bad tree that we're going to
[33:40] read about later?
[33:42] Where's that come from? Now, if this was
[33:44] a literal tree,
[33:47] then it would have to have been
[33:50] a actually identified here where he's
[33:54] making all the trees. But he says he
[33:55] made all the trees and they were all
[33:57] good. So, the bad tree is not a tree.
[34:01] All right? So, that that's that's a
[34:05] really good thing. Now, I want you to
[34:08] notice one other thing as we summarizing
[34:11] in the animal kingdom. He told every
[34:14] animal to bring forth of their own kind.
[34:18] You see how that could be a problem when
[34:20] we get to chapter three. And so we can
[34:23] see that there's many hints in chapter 2
[34:26] especially even in chapter 1 that uh God
[34:30] has um a picture of obviously what's
[34:33] going to happen. And here he's saying
[34:35] now watch out every animal must bring
[34:37] forth of his own kind. There should be
[34:39] no mixing of things between the animals.
[34:42] Right? So we know that human beings are
[34:45] made in the image of God even his
[34:47] supernatural form. That's what we talked
[34:49] about. Um but this uh supernatural Adam
[34:53] was given dominion over the earth and
[34:56] everything in it. So guess what? He had
[34:59] dominion when he went into the garden.
[35:02] when he was placed into the Garden of
[35:04] Eden and all these things transpired,
[35:06] uh, he had the authority to make the
[35:11] rules, if I can put it that way, or to
[35:13] keep the rules, and he chose not to do
[35:16] it. Now, there's a little uh trickiness
[35:19] here, and that's because supernatural
[35:21] Adam was Adam and Eve together. Once
[35:24] that got pulled apart, now there was
[35:27] something that Eve had to somehow learn,
[35:30] if I can put it that way. She had to
[35:32] become aware of something that must have
[35:35] been I want to say obvious to Adam. And
[35:39] when the command was given in chapter
[35:41] one to multiply and replenish, I have a
[35:45] very strong suspicion that this was a
[35:48] scripture which we saw when Jesus was
[35:51] tempted in the wilderness.
[35:53] uh he um h uh when Jesus was tempted in
[35:58] the wilderness uh he was tempted by
[36:01] Satan with scripture. And this is what I
[36:04] think is happening in in chapter 3 is
[36:07] when he's coming to Eve,
[36:10] he's not coming to him in the enticing
[36:12] words of man's wisdom. It's not that
[36:15] obvious. He's not coming to her with
[36:17] another gospel, but he's coming to her
[36:20] with exactly what God said. Amen. And
[36:24] now we know that the God's plan of
[36:27] multiplication,
[36:29] God's plan of replenishment
[36:32] is not what took place. That wasn't what
[36:34] God had intended. But Eve didn't have
[36:37] that revelation. And so, she's listening
[36:40] to the serpent and he's saying, "You
[36:43] know what? This is what God said. Now,
[36:46] he's keeping this this experience from
[36:49] you, this truth from you. He's he's he's
[36:52] keeping you in the dark. And and you
[36:55] know um by the way he didn't he say that
[36:59] you can't eat of any of the trees. She
[37:02] should have been triggered right away
[37:05] because that wasn't anything like what
[37:08] God had said. But she's setting it up
[37:10] that God's an ogre and that he's making
[37:13] all these beautiful things but you can't
[37:16] touch him.
[37:17] That's the picture that he's painting in
[37:20] her mind. And there's something about
[37:23] her response as we're waiting for the
[37:26] slides. There's something about her
[37:28] response that lets the serpent know,
[37:32] Satan, that he's got her right there. He
[37:37] says, "Yay, hath God said, you you may
[37:40] not eat of any of the fruit of the trees
[37:42] of the garden?" And she says, "Oh, no.
[37:45] He's a good God. He wouldn't do that. We
[37:48] may eat of all the trees of the garden,
[37:50] but of the tree that's in the middle of
[37:53] the garden.
[37:55] We may not touch it. Now, she made two
[37:57] mistakes. She made three mistakes now
[37:59] that I'm thinking about it. First of
[38:01] all, she said God said, and she wasn't
[38:03] there when God said it. All right? In
[38:06] the garden. Uh when when God told Adam,
[38:08] "You may not eat of it lest you die." He
[38:11] wasn't uh she wasn't there. and I'll
[38:14] make way for the other expert.
[38:20] Now, that would be you, brother.
[38:22] So, you're just going to pull out the
[38:23] HDMI. Good.
[38:26] All right. Oh, and this is the old
[38:28] version, right? All right. It's fine.
[38:30] It'll work. So, I had to email them the
[38:35] version, but until the last minute, it's
[38:37] never the right version. Oh, look at
[38:39] that. That worked like a charm.
[38:42] So,
[38:45] so going back to uh chapter 3 for for a
[38:48] minute as we talk about that. So, three
[38:51] things that she said that told Satan
[38:54] that he had her. Number one, she said
[38:58] God said
[39:00] God didn't say anything about um not
[39:04] touching it.
[39:06] He just said don't eat of it.
[39:09] But somehow she had gotten this picture
[39:13] of not touching it.
[39:16] Where did that come from?
[39:18] So here's the picture. Thank you,
[39:20] brother. There's two trees in the middle
[39:24] of the garden.
[39:26] She describes only seeing one tree.
[39:31] She says, "But of the tree that is in
[39:33] the midst of the garden, we may not eat
[39:35] of it, neither may we touch it, lest we
[39:38] die." And he goes, "God didn't say
[39:40] that." And what do you mean not touch
[39:43] it? That's not what God said. So when
[39:47] Satan starts off adding to the word when
[39:50] he said, "You'll not be able to eat of
[39:53] of, you know, any of the trees," she
[39:55] doesn't catch him on that. She just
[39:57] starts trying to defend God's
[39:59] reputation, all right, as not being a
[40:01] bad God. And Satan then goes one step
[40:04] further when he hears that she only sees
[40:07] one tree. He goes, "Hm."
[40:10] So he says to Eve, you know, you'll be
[40:12] like gods. You you'll know good and evil
[40:14] and and you know, all of these things
[40:16] that God's hidden away from you. You
[40:18] know, that's what he said, multiply and
[40:20] replenish. and she and he we you know
[40:24] whatever the word is into her thinking
[40:26] to get her away from what Adam had told
[40:29] her. So the reason she said don't touch
[40:32] it when she said God said don't touch it
[40:35] is because when Adam had brought her to
[40:38] when that was before she was uh created
[40:41] formed into a body and Adam must have
[40:44] been bringing her around showing her
[40:45] everything and then now he comes to the
[40:47] two trees if we picture them as trees
[40:49] and he says now Eve you see this one
[40:51] this one is good we can eat of that one
[40:53] but this one you must not eat of it and
[40:56] she looks and as brother Brennon says
[40:58] they were intertwined
[40:59] and she's looking at it and and then he
[41:03] says, "Well, go ahead, you know, reach
[41:04] out." Now, any any person in that
[41:07] position, if they say, "Do you
[41:08] understand?" Oh, yeah. I understand. So,
[41:11] he says, "Go ahead and, you know, take
[41:13] of it." And she reaches out and grabs
[41:16] for the wrong fruit. Oh. He says, "Whoa,
[41:20] just stop right there. If you want to
[41:23] eat of the tree of life, you come and
[41:24] ask me, and I'll give you to eat. But
[41:27] don't you go near it. Don't touch it
[41:29] because you don't understand. Now, you
[41:31] have to picture this in terms of what we
[41:33] know those trees represent. But because
[41:36] the Bible uses the symbolism, it's
[41:38] really helpful that we can sort of see
[41:40] this as as different fruit hanging from
[41:43] very similar looking trees. And if I had
[41:45] to speak on that subject tonight, I'd be
[41:49] talking about how that applies to us
[41:51] today because we still have two trees.
[41:56] And the thing we know about this
[41:58] Leodysian age is that we're as the bride
[42:03] being drawn back into Eden. They're
[42:06] being restored back to that Edenic
[42:08] condition. But guess what was in Eden?
[42:11] There were two trees.
[42:14] One was, let's say, good, one was bad.
[42:19] And today we now have two fully formed
[42:23] trees. the fully revealed word on the
[42:26] one hand and Satan's fully revealed plan
[42:29] on the other hand. We're in Satan's
[42:31] Eden. So that means that we're back in
[42:34] that condition where we have these two
[42:36] trees before us and now we are blessed
[42:39] with the revelation of the word to know
[42:41] which is which. But if you're in a if
[42:44] you're in a in a in a let's say in a in
[42:47] a in a in a faith um uh what are the
[42:51] words they use? community that uh
[42:54] doesn't have this revelation, you're
[42:56] still reaching for the wrong fruit
[42:59] because you don't have that revelation.
[43:01] So, you're thinking that God is going to
[43:04] uh use this organizational
[43:07] man-made system to bring about the
[43:10] catching away of the church and the
[43:11] change in the body. And it's absolutely
[43:14] not going to happen that way. And it's
[43:16] because we're at the stage where the two
[43:18] trees are now fully formed again. If we
[43:20] see them going through the church ages,
[43:22] we see them going through stages.
[43:24] Satan's plan going through stages, God's
[43:26] plan going through stages, but now
[43:28] they've both come to a head. And
[43:30] remember what Jesus said about the tears
[43:33] where he said, "Let them come to
[43:35] fruition. Let everything grow to and
[43:37] then we can start doing separating, but
[43:40] don't try and separate it before then."
[43:42] So, we're in the day that we now have to
[43:44] make a decision between the truth and a
[43:48] deception that's very close to the
[43:50] truth.
[43:51] Yes, sir. All right. Now, we got to
[43:54] chapter two. All right. So, we're going
[43:56] to back up a little bit. So, God gave
[43:59] them Adam and Eve as in one in the
[44:02] spiritual body complete dominion over
[44:06] the earth. So once again we get a
[44:08] picture of Adam uh a not being deceived
[44:11] but choosing not to exercise that right.
[44:15] He chose not to he could have he could
[44:18] have with complete dominion over
[44:20] everything the Bible says he could have
[44:23] um made the right um uh choice let's
[44:27] say. And the other thing we notice from
[44:30] chapter one is that there were no
[44:31] restrictions regarding the fruit. So if
[44:34] there were any bad fruit or any bad
[44:36] trees, then God would have used the
[44:38] restrictions. But the restrictions only
[44:40] appear in chapter 2 because that's when
[44:44] man was put into a body. And the other
[44:46] thing that happened is everything was
[44:48] very good at the end of chapter 1. But
[44:51] then at the beginning of chapter 2, the
[44:53] middle of chapter 2, God said it's not
[44:56] good. Now when Adam says when God comes
[45:01] looking for Adam and he says the woman
[45:03] that you gave me,
[45:05] [Music]
[45:06] he's not wrong. Obviously, it is the
[45:10] woman that God gave him. But it's
[45:12] fascinating that God wanted that to
[45:16] happen. He said it's not good that man
[45:18] is alone because if he's alone, we're
[45:20] never going to have the plan of
[45:21] salvation. We're going to never need a
[45:23] redeemer. We're never going to need a
[45:24] healer. I'm never going to be able to
[45:26] express these attributes. So, it's not
[45:28] good that man is alone. We need to have
[45:31] something in place that will allow my
[45:35] plan to go forward. So, now we're back
[45:38] uh to uh chapter 2. We have already read
[45:40] the first three verses, but I wanted you
[45:42] to notice this
[45:45] um creation and formation. I me I
[45:49] mentioned this in chapter 1 is that we
[45:52] often mistake um Genesis chapter 1 as as
[45:55] the six days of creation. It's just like
[45:57] come it's just an easy way to talk about
[45:59] it but it wasn't. There were only uh
[46:02] three creations in chapter 1. There was
[46:04] the creation of man going backwards and
[46:07] then there was the creation of animals
[46:09] and then there was the creation of the
[46:10] sun, moon and stars and the heavens and
[46:13] the earth in chapter 1 verse one. Those
[46:16] are the only creative acts in chapter
[46:17] one. So the rest of it was making or
[46:21] forming and that's what this verse says.
[46:24] All the things that he had made during
[46:26] that period which obviously would also
[46:28] include the things that he created
[46:30] obviously. But the fact that it uses the
[46:32] word made becomes apparent here in verse
[46:35] three where he says he rested from all
[46:37] his work which God created and made.
[46:42] not just created, not just made, but
[46:44] created and made. So we we do need to um
[46:48] be careful about how we think about that
[46:50] chapter one because if that's an
[46:53] illustration of our path, if that's
[46:57] God's plan of salvation, then there are
[47:00] things that um uh God's not creating
[47:04] sanctification in us, the separation of
[47:07] the waters from the waters. He's not
[47:09] creating a seed in us. He's bringing
[47:12] that seed to life. He's not creating the
[47:14] the sun, moon, and stars analogy of the
[47:17] church and and the and the sun and and
[47:19] and us as believers. He's not creating
[47:22] those things. Those were already in his
[47:23] mind from the foundation of the world.
[47:25] He's only positioning them. And the
[47:28] Bible says he made the sun to rule the
[47:30] day and he made the moon to rule the
[47:32] night and he made the stars also for
[47:34] signs and for seasons and for days and
[47:37] years. So what's he doing? He's making
[47:39] them do something. He's making the sun
[47:42] do this, making the moon do that. And if
[47:44] you listen to any of the young earth
[47:47] people, they completely miss that. They
[47:49] always have that fourth day as the
[47:52] creation of the sun, moon, and stars
[47:54] because it suits their agenda, but it's
[47:56] not scriptural at all. Now verse four,
[48:00] these are the generations of the heavens
[48:02] and of the earth when they were created
[48:05] in the day that the Lord God made the
[48:07] heaven earth and the heavens. He he
[48:10] reverses it. Why is that? Because he was
[48:13] making things happen on the earth. He
[48:16] was making things happen in the heavens.
[48:19] It wasn't the creation of earth and
[48:21] heavens. That was all chapter one. But
[48:23] it was at the end of this he's saying
[48:26] okay these are the different things
[48:28] creation and formation. And then he says
[48:31] and every plant of the field before it
[48:34] was in the earth and every herb of the
[48:36] field before it grew for the Lord God
[48:39] not cause it to rain. So in other words
[48:42] those seeds were laying there. So if we
[48:44] ever doubted that, this is the verse
[48:46] that actually uh cements that picture
[48:48] that brother Brandham has of a previous
[48:51] uh order system where these seeds had
[48:54] been carried over from that and uh of
[48:57] course without any moisture without the
[48:59] environment being right with the
[49:01] atmosphere and and the dry land those
[49:03] seeds couldn't grow. But once the
[49:05] atmosphere had been set, once the
[49:07] environment was set, those those seeds
[49:10] sprang to life. But it was before they
[49:13] were, and I just love that every every
[49:17] field before it grew. For the Lord God
[49:19] not caused to rain upon the earth, and
[49:21] there was not a man to till the ground.
[49:23] So this is brother Renom always uses
[49:24] this to say that must have been a
[49:26] spiritual creation in chapter one which
[49:29] again you'll find I don't know if I've
[49:31] ever read anybody else um you know maybe
[49:34] other than Scoffield or anybody say
[49:36] saying that oh it's a touchcreen h
[49:39] thanks brother.
[49:41] All right but says there there went a
[49:44] mist up from the earth and watered the
[49:46] whole face of the ground.
[49:48] Um, yeah, I was going to say things
[49:51] about that, but I'm going to try and
[49:52] move on. So, the Lord God formed man.
[49:56] This is the word yatsar in the Hebrew.
[49:58] Very important. All right. And it's the
[50:01] exact same word used for as a potter as
[50:05] he forms the clay. It's the exact same
[50:08] word. So, when the scripture comes up,
[50:09] remember this is the seed book. So,
[50:11] we're reading things in here that will
[50:13] get enlarged on later. And so when we
[50:15] read that the the the pot cannot say to
[50:18] the potter why have you made me thus all
[50:21] right? And so it's not that's not made
[50:23] up. I mean that comes right from this
[50:26] scripture. And the other thing I
[50:27] mentioned last time was that I always
[50:29] pictured Adam somehow on the ground
[50:31] getting getting sculpted but he wasn't.
[50:33] He was standing up in my my
[50:36] understanding. And so he formed men of
[50:38] the dust of the ground breathe into his
[50:40] nostrils a breath of life. Man became a
[50:41] living soul. Now, there's a few things
[50:42] we want to look at here because it's a
[50:44] teaching note. So, out of the ground
[50:49] is how he made Adam. It's also how he
[50:52] made all the plants, trees, and
[50:53] creatures in Eden. It says he brought
[50:55] them out of the ground. All right? And
[50:57] then in Ecclesiastes
[50:59] 12:7,
[51:02] he says, "Then shall the dust return to
[51:03] the earth as it was, and the spirit
[51:05] which shall return unto God who gave
[51:07] it." So now we're seeing the difference
[51:09] between the physical flesh and blood
[51:13] pieces and the supernatural part of
[51:16] Adam. So that supernatural part is the
[51:19] breath of life which in Hebrew is ruach
[51:23] and it's the same word used in the Greek
[51:24] which is panuma. And so it's got many
[51:27] meanings but the main ones are breath,
[51:29] spirit and wind. So the breath of
[51:32] animals in Genesis 7:15 is also the same
[51:36] word used for humans in Isaiah. It's the
[51:39] same word ru the breath. Why is that
[51:42] important? It's because brother Brennham
[51:45] goes on to talk about uh the form that
[51:49] Adam was in in chapter 2 when he's
[51:52] formed from the dust. And so the living
[51:55] soul that word is nephesh. This is also
[51:58] interesting because nephesh is mostly
[52:01] translated as creature. In fact, if you
[52:05] read most of the new translations, it
[52:08] says, "And man became a living
[52:09] creature."
[52:12] And that's interesting because that's
[52:13] the whole um the whole uh thrust of
[52:16] evolution is that we're just creatures.
[52:19] We we're just uh you know we just are so
[52:21] much uh animalistic
[52:23] uh you know um makeup and that goes to
[52:27] um our morals as well obviously.
[52:30] And now we know this from another
[52:32] scripture. The body is earthly but the
[52:34] soul is heavenly. So now we're seeing
[52:37] the the trouble that Adam has in this
[52:41] body is half of him if you like is
[52:45] earthly and half is spiritual. He has
[52:48] the memory of the spiritual things, the
[52:50] dominion and all these things, but he's
[52:53] also in a natural body. Brother Brandham
[52:55] says he was given five senses. So if we
[52:58] go back to Ecclesiastes, this is
[53:00] wonderful. Now time is against me. I
[53:03] said in my heart concerning the estate
[53:05] of the sons of men, that God might
[53:08] manifest them and that they might see
[53:10] that they themselves are beasts. Oh,
[53:13] this could have been any psychology
[53:14] professor today, by the way. for that
[53:17] which which my psychology professor did
[53:20] that to us as a class. He said, "Okay,
[53:22] what's the difference between animals
[53:23] and humans?" And whatever we came up
[53:25] with, he said, "Nope, that's no
[53:26] difference. For that," and if you said
[53:29] mind or soul, he would kick you out of
[53:31] the class. "For that which befalleth the
[53:33] sons of men befalls beasts, even one
[53:36] thing befalls them. As the one dies, so
[53:38] dies the other. Yay, they have all one
[53:42] breath, so that a man has no preeminence
[53:45] above a beast for all his vanity. All go
[53:49] unto one place, all are of the dust, and
[53:51] all turn to dust again. Now, he he poses
[53:55] an interesting question. Again, if you
[53:56] read new translations, you'll get this
[53:58] all mixed up. But this this verse 21
[54:02] says, "Who knows?"
[54:05] In other words, do you know how this
[54:07] works? Who knows the spirit of man that
[54:10] goes upward and the spirit of the beast
[54:13] that goes downward to the earth?
[54:18] In other words,
[54:20] he's asking the question why
[54:23] why is it that we believe as Sol S
[54:26] Solomon's kind of, you know, commenting
[54:28] here, how is it that we know that dust
[54:32] to dust, but the spirit goes back to
[54:34] God? Why is that? And I can just tell
[54:36] you in one in one second, otherwise
[54:39] we'll be here again all evening. Um
[54:41] because the spirit of man has a soul and
[54:47] that soul has to give account to God.
[54:49] The soul that sins that soul shall die.
[54:51] So that soul has to go back to God. But
[54:54] how does the soul get back to God?
[54:56] Because it's wrapped as uh as um um
[55:00] Abigail said, the soul of my Lord is
[55:02] wrapped in a bundle of life.
[55:06] So, it's because the soul is wrapped in
[55:08] the spirit that the spirit of man has to
[55:11] go back to God because it's got to take
[55:13] the soul with it. That's how the soul
[55:15] gets there for judgment or for for being
[55:18] recognized as being under the blood. But
[55:20] in either case, that soul has to be
[55:22] alive in order to go back into the
[55:25] presence of God. Animals don't have a
[55:27] soul. And that's why the spirit of a man
[55:31] goes up and the spirit of a beast goes
[55:32] down. But nevertheless,
[55:35] based on the previous verses, um, he's
[55:38] making a a very close connection between
[55:41] animals and humans. And the reason I'm
[55:44] So it wasn't my computer, brother. Um,
[55:48] so the reason I I'm I'm stressing that
[55:51] is because of this proximity, not the
[55:55] right word, this uh compatibility
[55:58] between the serpent, the beast, and uh,
[56:01] Eve. And you can see from these
[56:04] scriptures that there's all these
[56:06] similarities that you know we can we can
[56:09] ex you know make u make uh draw
[56:12] conclusions from but brother Brennham
[56:14] makes this conclusion here um you don't
[56:17] have it on your screen but in in
[56:18] questions and answers on Genesis which
[56:20] by the way is really good that that
[56:22] whole sermon this human man here and
[56:25] he's talking about Adam is made after
[56:27] the image of an animal. These human
[56:28] bodies are made in the image of animals.
[56:31] So Adam was made in the image of God but
[56:33] uh Adam in the flesh was made in the
[56:36] image of animals which is brings us to
[56:38] the point of why there could be this
[56:40] intermingling.
[56:42] All right why there could be something.
[56:43] So again brother Brennham says this in
[56:45] the sermon why is it that so many
[56:47] Christians find it so hard to live the
[56:49] Christian life. He says it took the Holy
[56:52] Spirit I love this. It took the Holy
[56:54] Spirit to bring me from the earth. And
[56:57] if the Holy Spirit made me what I am
[57:00] without me having any choice,
[57:05] we didn't choose to come into this
[57:07] world. All right? How much more can he
[57:09] bring me back out of the dust of the
[57:12] earth by choice? In other words, if we
[57:15] believe that it was the spirit of God
[57:18] that was moving on that on that earth
[57:20] and and and producing this this this man
[57:25] and his wife and we say, "Oh, if God can
[57:29] do that and I had no choice in the
[57:30] matter of coming into this world, what
[57:33] can he do by choice?" If we actually
[57:35] give him consent,
[57:37] if we actually say, "I want you to bring
[57:40] me out of the ground. I want you to
[57:42] bring me out of the dirt. I want you to
[57:44] bring me out of unbelief. And I want you
[57:46] you to bring me into your light. Wow,
[57:49] that's just fantastic. So now we're
[57:52] going to talk about Eden as a as a
[57:55] higher dimension.
[57:58] It looks like they're running it from up
[57:59] there. Is that right? Yeah. That's why
[58:01] the titles are wrong. That should say
[58:04] Eden, higher dimension. So in 1
[58:07] Corinthians chapter 15, he says it's swn
[58:09] a natural body, raised a spiritual body.
[58:11] There's a natural body, there's a
[58:12] spiritual body. And in other words,
[58:14] we're going back from Genesis looking
[58:16] that as the DNA, as the seed book. Now,
[58:18] we're seeing here in Corinthians, Paul's
[58:20] drawing on that. All right? That's why I
[58:23] believe Genesis is so important.
[58:25] Remember, Brother Brandham said Genesis
[58:26] and Revelation. So there is a natural
[58:29] body and there's a spiritual body. As so
[58:31] it is written, the first man, Adam, was
[58:33] a living soul. The last man was made a
[58:35] quickening spirit. How be it that was
[58:38] not first which is spiritual but that
[58:40] which is natural and afterward that
[58:42] which is spiritual. That can tend to be
[58:44] a little confusing
[58:46] because it was spiritual first as we
[58:48] believe. Ah thank you. So, it was
[58:50] spiritual first. That was Genesis
[58:54] chapter 1. And then it was natural. But
[58:56] now Paul's going backwards. And he's
[58:59] saying now if we're going backwards
[59:00] through the story, it was first the
[59:02] natural man that caused the problem and
[59:04] got into trouble and the whole world got
[59:06] into sin. And but before that was a
[59:08] spiritual man. And that's what Paul's
[59:11] saying we're going back to. That's
[59:13] that's the implication here. How does
[59:15] this work? There you go. Oh, put this
[59:18] down. It'll confuse me. Except I can't
[59:20] read that. All right. So, um I see we're
[59:25] a little behind.
[59:28] Okay.
[59:32] So, the first man is of the earthy.
[59:35] The uh the second man, oh, can't do it.
[59:40] Is the Lord from heaven. And as we have
[59:42] borne the image of the earthly, we shall
[59:43] also bear the image of the heavenly. And
[59:46] I just love the fact that he's saying
[59:48] because we look like Adam in the
[59:51] natural,
[59:52] we're also going to look like Adam in
[59:54] the spiritual.
[59:56] I just it's just incredible the way
[59:58] Paul's tying this back to Genesis in in
[1:00:01] such a a way that, you know, we we can't
[1:00:03] ignore it. So, carrying on in chapter 2,
[1:00:06] and the Lord God formed man of the dust
[1:00:08] of the ground, breathe into his nostrils
[1:00:09] a breath of life, and man became a
[1:00:10] living soul. And the Lord God planted a
[1:00:13] garden eastward in Eden.
[1:00:17] And there he put the man whom he had
[1:00:19] formed. And out of the ground, again,
[1:00:24] God made the um the ground made the Lord
[1:00:27] God to grow. Now, here's the thing.
[1:00:31] Every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[1:00:33] and good for food, here's where it
[1:00:36] becomes difficult if you're not a
[1:00:38] careful reader. the tree of life also in
[1:00:43] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[1:00:44] the knowledge of good and evil. It's
[1:00:46] because of the way the sentence is
[1:00:48] structured that it can lead you to think
[1:00:52] that this is uh two different you know
[1:00:55] completely different trees and just
[1:00:57] something completely different and not
[1:00:59] this intertwined uh picture that brother
[1:01:01] Brandham gives us of the two things
[1:01:03] being so close but it's that they were
[1:01:05] both in the middle of the garden and I
[1:01:08] can tell you there's only one middle by
[1:01:11] definition now you can draw a big circle
[1:01:14] and say well that's the middle but
[1:01:15] There's only one middle. So to be in the
[1:01:18] midst of the garden, both of the trees
[1:01:20] in the midst of the garden would put
[1:01:22] them so closely together that we
[1:01:24] couldn't tell the difference. Now
[1:01:26] talking about trees, have we all heard
[1:01:28] of Methuselah?
[1:01:30] Methuselah, the tree. All right. It's
[1:01:33] the oldest living organisms. 4,855
[1:01:37] years old this year.
[1:01:40] That's incredible. Think go back. So
[1:01:42] 2,000 years to Jesus. So 2 and a half
[1:01:45] thousand nearly 3,000 years before that
[1:01:48] this tree was growing.
[1:01:51] Why is that important? It's because the
[1:01:53] natural types are spiritual. So God had
[1:01:56] to have something that showed us that
[1:01:58] there could be a spiritual tree that
[1:02:01] would last
[1:02:04] for eternity. And here's an example of
[1:02:07] it. And it's it's just beautiful. And
[1:02:09] then we of course we know that this life
[1:02:11] is in his son. And he that hath the sun
[1:02:13] hath life, and he that hath not the son
[1:02:16] hath not life. So it's just a beautiful
[1:02:18] uh picture. I love that uh story about
[1:02:20] the bristle cone pine. Now we keep
[1:02:23] reading. And he put the man whom he had
[1:02:25] formed out of the ground Lord God to
[1:02:26] make every tree that's pleasant to the
[1:02:29] sight and good for food.
[1:02:32] You see how Satan's question was
[1:02:36] actually tying Eve up a little bit
[1:02:38] because if she knows this, if she
[1:02:41] understands if Adam's explained this to
[1:02:43] her that every tree is good for food and
[1:02:46] now she Satan's saying, "Well, you can't
[1:02:49] eat of any of the fruit of the tree."
[1:02:51] And she's going, "No, we can. We can."
[1:02:52] And guess what? She's quoting this
[1:02:54] verse. And good for food. All right.
[1:02:57] without realizing that there's a another
[1:03:01] approach to multiply and replenish that
[1:03:05] she hasn't cottoned on to yet and that
[1:03:08] we'll have to get to in the next
[1:03:10] session. Um, so the reason that I've got
[1:03:15] this scripture in there is verse 18. A
[1:03:17] good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,
[1:03:20] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[1:03:21] good fruit. So you've got the tree of
[1:03:23] good and evil. That's not a natural
[1:03:26] tree.
[1:03:29] So, if you don't like lemons, which of
[1:03:31] course I love lemons, but if you don't
[1:03:32] like lemons and you think you're going
[1:03:34] to eat an orange from an orange tree and
[1:03:37] you suddenly get a lemon, you're going
[1:03:39] to have some speaks with the uh with the
[1:03:42] farmer because that's not right. It
[1:03:44] shouldn't happen. Now, of course,
[1:03:45] brother describes, you know, grafting
[1:03:48] and so forth, but the point is in the
[1:03:49] natural that doesn't happen. So this is
[1:03:51] again just another example of why this
[1:03:53] isn't a natural tree because it can't be
[1:03:57] both. Now I will I will say this
[1:04:02] and I'm just going to mention this
[1:04:03] because hopefully we'll we'll get to
[1:04:04] this in chapter 3 at some stage. I just
[1:04:07] want you to know if you think about and
[1:04:10] brother Chris and I have had a bit of
[1:04:12] discussion on this. If you think about
[1:04:15] what is there in
[1:04:17] our experience,
[1:04:19] nature,
[1:04:21] any any any part of our experience
[1:04:24] that's both good and evil, the same
[1:04:26] thing.
[1:04:30] So, it's okay to steal,
[1:04:33] you know, if you really need something.
[1:04:37] You know, if you talk to the people that
[1:04:38] are robbing stores, oh well, we're very
[1:04:40] hungry and we're poor and that excuses
[1:04:42] us, but it doesn't make it right. So,
[1:04:45] what is there that we know that's good
[1:04:48] and evil simultaneously? The same thing.
[1:04:52] Not necessarily at the same time, but
[1:04:53] the same thing. And it's what happens
[1:04:56] when a young couple gets married. And
[1:04:58] the night before the wedding, the dad's
[1:05:01] at the door with his shotgun keeping
[1:05:03] away any strange guys. And the night of
[1:05:06] the wedding, he's at the same door
[1:05:08] keeping his daughter away and saying,
[1:05:10] "Go back to your husband.
[1:05:13] You get the picture. In other words,
[1:05:15] what was evil the night before is now
[1:05:18] perfectly good the following night." So,
[1:05:20] what changed?
[1:05:22] Nothing. It's the same exact thing. It's
[1:05:25] the knowledge. Remember that's a Bible
[1:05:27] word for intimacy, right? That Adam knew
[1:05:30] his wife. So knowledge
[1:05:33] of good and evil is exactly what's being
[1:05:37] described. And especially if you run it
[1:05:38] through to chapter 4:1 and Adam knew his
[1:05:41] wife and then we find later on Jesus
[1:05:44] saying you come to me and say Lord Lord
[1:05:46] but I never knew you. What does it mean?
[1:05:49] It means I had never planted my seed in
[1:05:51] you my word in you. I had never had an
[1:05:54] intimate relationship with you
[1:05:57] because it said I never knew you. So you
[1:05:59] can see how it's important that this
[1:06:01] word is knowledge. Now of course we can
[1:06:03] take brother random says many times you
[1:06:05] know knowledge like science and they
[1:06:07] invented gun power gunpowder and the
[1:06:09] atomic bomb and so forth and they're
[1:06:10] going to kill each other you know but
[1:06:12] yes so there is that natural aspect to
[1:06:15] knowledge but it's good and evil
[1:06:19] the same act. So each tree is told to
[1:06:22] reproduce after its own kind. Now we
[1:06:25] know that the tree symbolizes a person
[1:06:27] and in this case each person in the
[1:06:30] garden the two trees had a plan for the
[1:06:34] humans. Now I want to put it to you this
[1:06:36] way because brother Brennham doesn't say
[1:06:38] this exactly
[1:06:40] um but if you put it all together this
[1:06:42] is what he's saying is that because he
[1:06:45] always when he talks about the trees he
[1:06:47] talks about them in different ways.
[1:06:48] church age book he talks about as
[1:06:50] persons. Other times places he talks
[1:06:52] about it as as Adam and Eve as the good
[1:06:54] tree and the bad tree. So these trees
[1:06:56] are representative and obviously they
[1:06:57] could represent a number of different
[1:06:59] things. But in the in the in the Garden
[1:07:02] of Eden it represented two plans, two uh
[1:07:08] means by which God was going to multiply
[1:07:10] and replenish the earth through this
[1:07:12] couple.
[1:07:14] And we know now that the one plan was
[1:07:16] that Adam would speak the word. Eve
[1:07:19] would conceive behind the veil and she
[1:07:22] would then give birth to uh the Messiah
[1:07:25] or Jesus. He would raise up to 33 years
[1:07:28] of age and then speak the saints from
[1:07:30] the dust of the earth. And so the earth
[1:07:32] would be filled with his glory.
[1:07:36] And we know that's exactly what's going
[1:07:37] to happen. So God doesn't change his
[1:07:39] mind. He doesn't, you know, he could
[1:07:41] plan can get interrupted, but it's never
[1:07:43] going to never going to change. It's
[1:07:44] going to be the same plan. And so that
[1:07:47] was multiply and replenish the earth in
[1:07:49] chapter one.
[1:07:51] But now that she's no longer able to
[1:07:55] conceive behind the veil, now the plan
[1:07:57] is broken. So it's no use she her
[1:08:01] repenting if she goes back to God. Oh
[1:08:03] gosh, I'm so sorry. The problem is the
[1:08:06] the Jesus has to be conceived behind the
[1:08:09] veil. Every time we see Jesus appearing,
[1:08:11] it's from behind the veil. That's why it
[1:08:13] was important in the tabernacle, but it
[1:08:15] was also what happened when Jesus was
[1:08:17] intombed. He came out from the sealed
[1:08:20] tomb. Remember how they made a big deal
[1:08:22] of it being sealed and so forth and gods
[1:08:25] outside?
[1:08:26] And so that principle of uh how Satan
[1:08:31] was going to try and manifest himself in
[1:08:33] the flesh is um what God uh was
[1:08:38] planning. So remember in Ephesians 3:15,
[1:08:42] God's plan is to express his family. And
[1:08:44] you remember he says of whom the whole
[1:08:46] family in heaven and earth is named. So
[1:08:48] God's going to have a family, a spoken
[1:08:50] word family. Yes. And it's not going to
[1:08:53] be through natural processes. But
[1:08:57] there's a reason that Satan was so eager
[1:09:01] to do what he did. Brother Random says
[1:09:04] he was injecting himself into the human
[1:09:07] race. He wanted to do what? Let me see
[1:09:10] if that slide comes up.
[1:09:14] Yeah, this is the one about I never knew
[1:09:15] you. So, we'll go first past that. And
[1:09:18] let's read this slowly. Man could not
[1:09:20] directly come and partake of the tree of
[1:09:22] life in the midst of the garden. The
[1:09:24] tree of life had to become flesh first.
[1:09:28] But before God could raise and save a
[1:09:30] sinner, he had to have a sinner to raise
[1:09:32] and save. Man had to fall. The fall that
[1:09:35] Satan would cause had to have flesh to
[1:09:38] make them fall. And then he said Satan
[1:09:41] had to be had to come through flesh
[1:09:44] also.
[1:09:45] So what he goes on to say I think Satan
[1:09:49] could not come through human flesh to
[1:09:50] make them fall. In other words, he
[1:09:52] couldn't create himself a body. He
[1:09:54] couldn't become flesh like the word
[1:09:56] could become flesh even as Christ would
[1:09:59] come in human flesh to restore the
[1:10:01] fallen. But there was an animal serpent
[1:10:02] so close to man that Satan could get to
[1:10:05] that beast and through that beast he
[1:10:06] could get to human flesh and cause the
[1:10:09] fallen inject himself thereby into the
[1:10:11] human race. Even as Jesus would one day
[1:10:14] come and inject himself into the human
[1:10:16] race into human bodies even to the
[1:10:19] extent of a resurrection wherein we
[1:10:21] would have bodies like unto his
[1:10:23] glorified body. So that's the kind of
[1:10:25] synopsis of what this whole plan and
[1:10:28] purpose of God was with the tree of
[1:10:30] life. It was that Jesus would become
[1:10:33] flesh. He would be born and he would
[1:10:36] then speak the saints from the dust of
[1:10:38] the ground and that would be his plan.
[1:10:41] Now
[1:10:43] going to switch gears because we're not
[1:10:45] talking about chapter 3. So Eden was a
[1:10:48] higher dimension. I'm going to spend a
[1:10:50] two minutes on that from maybe from the
[1:10:52] last can't remember what I said last
[1:10:53] time. But um the reason that I'm saying
[1:10:57] Eden was a higher dimension is there's
[1:10:59] certain things by the random says that
[1:11:00] that that leads to that. But uh
[1:11:03] primarily it's that um he brought all
[1:11:07] the animals and all the fruit out of the
[1:11:10] ground
[1:11:11] after he had planted a garden
[1:11:15] on earth. He had planted Eden on earth
[1:11:18] and then he had brought these things out
[1:11:20] of the ground. He he didn't say he
[1:11:23] brought them like Noah did from from the
[1:11:25] different parts of the earth and you
[1:11:27] know sort of bring them in but God
[1:11:28] actually brought them out of the ground
[1:11:31] especially for Adam and Eve and I would
[1:11:33] say that this represents another
[1:11:35] dimension and which is why we cannot
[1:11:37] find any sign of Eden right no physical
[1:11:40] sign no remnants there's nothing about
[1:11:42] Eden that remains and the other thing is
[1:11:46] of course we know spiritually now if we
[1:11:48] go make it spiritual as a type is that
[1:11:51] um uh you know, we're going to this
[1:11:53] promised land as we see Israel doing and
[1:11:56] we know that that's the that's the word
[1:11:59] that that's the heavenly places in
[1:12:01] Christ Jesus. So, I think it's important
[1:12:03] that we understand this Eden that we're
[1:12:06] going back to is not going back to some
[1:12:09] place on earth. That would be a bit of a
[1:12:12] letdown, I think, cuz we've been there,
[1:12:14] done that, and didn't work out so well.
[1:12:16] All right. So, there's going to be a a
[1:12:19] new heaven and a new earth. And there's
[1:12:21] going to be this recreated, if you like,
[1:12:24] Eden, which we won't have time to get to
[1:12:26] tonight, but when we go to Revelation
[1:12:28] and we see the trees, the the the tree
[1:12:30] standing on both sides of the river, um
[1:12:33] there's an implication in that. But this
[1:12:35] is just like Eden, it's supernatural. I
[1:12:38] mean, imagine one tree sitting on both
[1:12:40] sides of a river. Um, but there's also
[1:12:42] this aspect of these uh of this river
[1:12:45] that went out of Eden that became two
[1:12:47] heads. If you look in other
[1:12:49] translations, it'll say and became,
[1:12:50] sorry, four heads. It became four
[1:12:52] rivers. Now, that's not the way rivers
[1:12:55] work in the natural. Uh, tributaries
[1:12:58] flow into a big river. The river doesn't
[1:13:01] flow into four big rivers. That's just
[1:13:04] not how the closest thing we have is a
[1:13:05] delta, but it's certainly no one would
[1:13:07] call that a river. So the thing is this
[1:13:10] is a supernatural realm
[1:13:13] and the reason that's important is
[1:13:15] because it would had to be that for
[1:13:17] Satan to operate.
[1:13:20] It couldn't have just been, you know, a
[1:13:22] completely natural situation. The other
[1:13:24] thing I wanted to bring to your
[1:13:26] attention is remember when God says to
[1:13:28] Adam, because we're going to have to
[1:13:29] kind of summarize this all. God says to
[1:13:33] Adam, "The day you eat thereof, that day
[1:13:34] you'll die."
[1:13:37] And I think I mentioned this last week.
[1:13:39] What's death?
[1:13:43] Uh, can you can you define that for me,
[1:13:47] please? I I don't get it. What's death?
[1:13:50] No, nothing's ever died. I mean, what
[1:13:52] what is what do you mean die?
[1:13:56] And I think uh it makes sense if this
[1:13:59] was a higher dimension. If this was some
[1:14:02] thing as we understand that the the road
[1:14:04] back to the Eden would be protected by
[1:14:06] the flaming sword and so forth and we
[1:14:09] understand that this is protecting
[1:14:11] another dimension. This is Christ in in
[1:14:13] in a different dimension. All right?
[1:14:15] then we would just picture it as some
[1:14:18] pretty place on earth. Is that if if
[1:14:21] that uh supernatural dimension is where
[1:14:27] uh Satan could operate
[1:14:30] in those days and that's why he operates
[1:14:34] in this supernatural dimension. Not just
[1:14:36] us but in our community of believers. We
[1:14:40] see this happening. It's because we're
[1:14:43] crossing over as it were into the
[1:14:45] supernatural realm. And that's why uh
[1:14:48] our battle is against powers and
[1:14:50] principalities of the air. That's why we
[1:14:52] have all these these these these these
[1:14:55] the demonic activities that that are so
[1:14:57] prevalent. Of course, the 200 million
[1:14:59] demons don't help, but it has to be a a
[1:15:03] similar situation. Now, we've got the
[1:15:05] two trees back in manifestation. We're
[1:15:07] now in a spiritual dimension as it were.
[1:15:10] And now we find Satan really having a go
[1:15:13] at us and it's completely different than
[1:15:17] just in an average church. I can assure
[1:15:20] you of that. There's one other point I
[1:15:22] wanted to bring up. Um if you look in
[1:15:24] your Bible since you have your Bibles
[1:15:26] most of you and it's wonderful to see um
[1:15:29] you notice I've started bringing my
[1:15:31] Bible because you got to walk the walk
[1:15:32] as well. Um, but if you look in your
[1:15:35] Bible, you'll see something really
[1:15:37] interesting.
[1:15:38] All through chapter one, and you don't
[1:15:40] do it now, but you can go back and and
[1:15:43] do it. Every time it refers to God, it
[1:15:47] just says, "And God said, it's always
[1:15:49] God in chapter one." But now look in
[1:15:52] chapter 2, right there in verse four,
[1:15:57] the day that the Lord God made the
[1:16:00] heaven and earth, heavens, earth and
[1:16:02] heavens. Now just keep going verse 5
[1:16:04] Lord God 78 13 times in that ch I think
[1:16:09] was it 11 times in chapter uh two and
[1:16:12] then notice in chapter 3 and it's not
[1:16:16] it's never just God in chapter 2 by the
[1:16:18] way it's always Lord God all right and
[1:16:21] reasons for that we can't get into
[1:16:23] chapter 3:1 the serpent was more subtle
[1:16:26] than any beast of the field which the
[1:16:27] Lord God had made and he said and and
[1:16:31] the serpent of course says to the woman
[1:16:33] has God said. So whenever he refers to
[1:16:36] him, he's always referring to him as
[1:16:38] God. But then if you jump down to verse
[1:16:40] eight and they heard the voice of the
[1:16:44] Lord God walking and then it's the Lord
[1:16:46] God, the Lord God another three times.
[1:16:50] Very interesting because if you want to
[1:16:52] read about it, um Scoffield has the
[1:16:55] explanation of Lord God. But it's very
[1:16:58] it's very interesting that Satan doesn't
[1:17:00] use that term. For him, it's just God.
[1:17:04] All right. Object of worship, the boss.
[1:17:07] But for for Moses writing this and he's
[1:17:11] seeing what's going, he says, "Oh, this
[1:17:13] is the Lord God." It's really beautiful.
[1:17:16] And and I we don't really have time to
[1:17:18] to go into it. So, let's see what else I
[1:17:19] have in the short time. Uh yes. So this
[1:17:23] is what I was saying in the ESV and many
[1:17:25] other translations. It divided and
[1:17:27] became four rivers.
[1:17:31] How much time do we have? I'm sorry. I
[1:17:32] don't know what time we started. Is it
[1:17:35] Oh, it's like 10 minutes. Is that right?
[1:17:38] We started about 7:30 usually. Okay.
[1:17:40] Let's see if I can scratch through this.
[1:17:42] This is uh really fascinating to me. So,
[1:17:45] Revelation 22, we read about the pure
[1:17:48] river of water of life, clear as crystal
[1:17:51] proceeding out of the throne of God and
[1:17:53] the lamb. And in the midst of the street
[1:17:55] of it, and on either side of the river
[1:17:57] was a tree of life. Guess what?
[1:17:59] Supernatural.
[1:18:01] All right? So, now this is, you know,
[1:18:02] Genesis, Revelation, this is like Eden
[1:18:04] again where there's these supernatural
[1:18:06] things going on with the with the
[1:18:08] rivers.
[1:18:10] And then in Ezekiel, we see some more
[1:18:13] information on this. And he brought me
[1:18:16] again unto the door of the house, and
[1:18:18] behold, waters issued out from under the
[1:18:19] threshold of the house eastward. For the
[1:18:21] forefront of the house stood toward the
[1:18:23] east, and the waters came down from
[1:18:26] under from the right side of the house
[1:18:28] and the south side of the altar. And now
[1:18:31] we know that there was water up to the
[1:18:33] ankles, up to the knees, up to the
[1:18:34] loins, and then waters to swim in. Verse
[1:18:36] six. And he said to me, "Son of man,
[1:18:38] have you seen this? Now when I returned,
[1:18:41] behold, at the bank of the river were
[1:18:44] very many trees on the one side and on
[1:18:47] the other." H
[1:18:50] So John sees it. He sees one tree.
[1:18:53] Ezekiel sees it and he sees many trees.
[1:18:56] What's not mentioned in this passage is
[1:18:58] that these were different varieties of
[1:19:01] trees. These aren't different species.
[1:19:03] This is he's not saying and of you know
[1:19:05] all manner of fruits like we have in
[1:19:07] revelation where we think of you know
[1:19:09] many diverse trees or something. Nope.
[1:19:13] So the river of water of life and the
[1:19:15] tree of life on both sides of the river
[1:19:19] is interesting because one tree on both
[1:19:22] sides and now we have the same river
[1:19:24] with many trees but nothing about
[1:19:26] different types of trees. So here's what
[1:19:29] I wanted you to read.
[1:19:33] So the bride tree and the bridegroom
[1:19:35] tree go back and become one. We'll show
[1:19:37] how brother Brandham says this in a
[1:19:38] minute. Like Adam and Eve who got
[1:19:40] separated by the fall and now come back
[1:19:42] as one. This water spiritually is the
[1:19:44] pure word of God. And whatever the water
[1:19:47] and wherever the water flows, it heals.
[1:19:50] And we see a bride living on either side
[1:19:52] of this river. So her roots are right
[1:19:55] into it. And she's just pulling life
[1:19:57] from the word. Let's read how brother
[1:19:59] Brandham says it. The word of God is one
[1:20:01] in his church today, making it the
[1:20:03] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:20:05] bring the message in the last day, be
[1:20:07] taken up from the dead in the
[1:20:09] resurrection to go back and restore
[1:20:11] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[1:20:13] in the garden of Eden. He says that tree
[1:20:16] of life is in Eden. Now, spiritually
[1:20:18] speaking, now when this tree that God
[1:20:20] planted, it was to bear different kinds
[1:20:22] of fruit. That was God's tree, he
[1:20:25] planted it in the earth on the day of
[1:20:27] Pentecost.
[1:20:29] Ah, now we're getting the picture. And
[1:20:33] as he being the groom, the bride has to
[1:20:36] come forth because it's part of him. And
[1:20:38] it can only be the manifestation of the
[1:20:40] fulfilling of all the revelations that
[1:20:42] others have spoken of. The bride, it can
[1:20:44] only manifest if it does something
[1:20:48] different from the groom. It isn't the
[1:20:50] bride because she is flesh of his flesh,
[1:20:52] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[1:20:54] power of his power. She is him.
[1:20:58] And if you hear him saying this, brother
[1:21:00] Brennham's really excited. She is him.
[1:21:03] So guess what? The one tree.
[1:21:07] Uh-oh. Go back. So the one tree in
[1:21:11] Revelation
[1:21:13] is Christ and the bride back as Adam and
[1:21:16] Eve were one in chapter one.
[1:21:20] And that's how there could be many trees
[1:21:23] as brother Brenham explains about the
[1:21:24] wives in the Old Testament. Every one of
[1:21:27] those women was his wife. And so when it
[1:21:30] says one tree, it's because the Christ
[1:21:33] and his bride have become one. Which if
[1:21:36] you, you know, we don't have time to
[1:21:37] know, but you can play that all the way
[1:21:38] through the scripture and even in the
[1:21:40] New Testament. I pray that you would be
[1:21:42] one, even as I and my father are one.
[1:21:45] And one doesn't mean we don't have an
[1:21:47] identity.
[1:21:49] We still have our individual identity.
[1:21:51] Why is that? Because we had that
[1:21:53] identity in Christ from the foundation
[1:21:56] of the world as an attribute of God. We
[1:21:58] were always who we are. We didn't morph
[1:22:01] into something else because we got born.
[1:22:03] No, he took that spirit that was you and
[1:22:06] I and put that into that physical body.
[1:22:10] And you say, "Well, that means I had
[1:22:13] like a pre-existence."
[1:22:16] And that's where a lot of churches
[1:22:18] struggle with this pre-existence idea.
[1:22:21] And yet Paul explains it so beautifully
[1:22:24] when he says Levi paid tithes in
[1:22:26] Abraham.
[1:22:28] Levi was the son of Jacob who was the
[1:22:32] son of Isaac who was the son of Abraham.
[1:22:36] So this speck that became Levi was a
[1:22:40] speck inside of the speck who was in
[1:22:43] speck inside of this speck who was a
[1:22:46] speck inside of this speck.
[1:22:50] But it was Levi that paid the tithes.
[1:22:53] And Paul even goes on to say why that
[1:22:55] is? Because he would have to live off
[1:22:56] the tithes. How did he know?
[1:23:01] It's in the same way that God tells Job,
[1:23:03] "Where were you when the morning stars
[1:23:06] sang together and the sons of God
[1:23:07] shouted for?" Tell tell me if you can
[1:23:09] can you tell me. Now God's not asking
[1:23:12] him an impossible question. He was
[1:23:14] there. He just doesn't remember it. Levi
[1:23:17] doesn't remember that he was the one who
[1:23:19] prompted Abraham to pay tithes to
[1:23:21] Melkazedc. And neither do we know what
[1:23:25] it is that prompts us in our daily lives
[1:23:29] when we make decisions. When we choose
[1:23:31] God, when we give him consent, when we
[1:23:34] throw ourselves on his mercy, what is
[1:23:36] that? It's that deep calling to the
[1:23:39] deep. And I like deep from way back
[1:23:43] where that that's where that deep was.
[1:23:46] And somehow that's not confined to space
[1:23:50] and time, right? It's like right here
[1:23:54] when we make that decision, when we get
[1:23:56] approached by the word, when we get con
[1:23:58] convicted, when something happens in our
[1:24:00] life, it's those two things come right
[1:24:03] up into the present tense. And that's
[1:24:07] exactly what those two trees were
[1:24:10] representing. Uh is that initially it
[1:24:13] was two different plans,
[1:24:16] but it was supposed to just be one plan.
[1:24:19] Then the serpent comes along and he
[1:24:22] says, "No, there's actually two plans.
[1:24:24] There's two ways to make babies,
[1:24:28] and I I I don't want you to miss out on
[1:24:31] anything." Hm. Yeah, it's not so
[1:24:35] different from today. And so the Lord
[1:24:37] God took the man, put him into the
[1:24:38] garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[1:24:40] it. And the Lord God commanded the man,
[1:24:42] saying, "Of every tree you may freely
[1:24:43] eat,
[1:24:45] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:24:47] and evil, you shall not eat of it. The
[1:24:49] day you eat of it, you shall surely die.
[1:24:51] What's death?" Told you these slides are
[1:24:53] not the right slides. It's okay.
[1:24:56] And so he said, "It's not good that man
[1:24:59] should be alone." And so out of the
[1:25:02] ground, now this is the next verse. He
[1:25:04] says, "Not good that man should be
[1:25:05] alone." But he carries on and he says,
[1:25:07] "Out of the ground the Lord God formed
[1:25:08] every beast of the field, every fowl of
[1:25:10] the air and brought them to Adam." Every
[1:25:13] beast,
[1:25:16] including the serpent.
[1:25:20] So who's behind all this? It's not
[1:25:23] Satan. He's a tool. God's setting him
[1:25:27] up. God knows what's in his heart.
[1:25:31] He knows what he wants. He knows how to
[1:25:34] manipulate him. He goes, "Okay, let me
[1:25:36] put Eve in a separate body. Uh, let me
[1:25:39] give them this special garden where
[1:25:41] everything looks funny and it looks
[1:25:42] lovely and then uh we'll bring the
[1:25:45] serpent along and uh we'll see what
[1:25:48] happens."
[1:25:50] But God knows exactly what's going to
[1:25:52] happen. And he actually has orchestrated
[1:25:57] the whole plan. And that's why we can
[1:26:00] have confidence
[1:26:02] in the word of God, in the spirit of
[1:26:05] God, in his plan and purpose for our
[1:26:07] life. He's never taken by surprise
[1:26:09] everything that happens. We heard um on
[1:26:12] was it Sunday? Sorry, I don't remember
[1:26:15] um maybe last Wednesday where um that
[1:26:18] tree that was planted at the Buddha
[1:26:20] waters of Mara. I love this example that
[1:26:23] that tree would have been planted like
[1:26:25] 30 years before they got there. In order
[1:26:28] to be a tree in the desert, it had to be
[1:26:30] there a long time. And here comes Israel
[1:26:32] and they need to have those waters
[1:26:34] sweetened. And guess what? Oh, this
[1:26:36] happens to be this tree here. God's
[1:26:38] provision always way ahead. In the same
[1:26:40] way, he can have his plan
[1:26:44] way ahead that we don't know what's
[1:26:47] happening. We look at this and we go,
[1:26:48] "Oh gosh, I'm in so much trouble." And
[1:26:51] yet God's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[1:26:53] It's all fine. Just have faith. Just
[1:26:56] believe that God is all right." And then
[1:27:00] you have to give him consent. Now, he
[1:27:02] brought forth every priest, every foul.
[1:27:04] The reason I emphasize foul is because
[1:27:06] birds in the parables are always bad. Uh
[1:27:09] you can look that up. All right? So, the
[1:27:11] birds are the one that came and took the
[1:27:12] seed, remember, um off the path. And
[1:27:15] then it says, "Adam gave names to all
[1:27:17] the cattle." Now, this is really just in
[1:27:20] my mind. He's naming the serpent
[1:27:23] and he's seeing this creature that looks
[1:27:25] just like him and he's giving it a name.
[1:27:29] It's almost like he's empowering, you
[1:27:31] know, if you name something, you've
[1:27:32] empowered it. And he could have gone, I
[1:27:36] don't like you. You know, I'm not going
[1:27:38] to give you a name. All right? Just
[1:27:41] that's just my silly silly way of
[1:27:43] thinking. So, what does Adam mean? The
[1:27:46] Hebrew word is adoma.
[1:27:48] What does adama mean? Means a man of the
[1:27:52] soil,
[1:27:53] right? So it's not that uh in not that
[1:27:56] difficult. And that we we consist of 21
[1:27:59] elements mostly oxygen, carbon,
[1:28:01] hydrogen, nitrogen. That's why we're
[1:28:03] called carbon life. And then uh the
[1:28:05] seeds require some things. This was what
[1:28:09] we were talking about in chapter one.
[1:28:11] Soil, water, air, sunlight to grow. And
[1:28:14] so that's why Jeremiah says our soul
[1:28:16] shall be as a watered garden. Why am I
[1:28:18] bringing this up? It's because to be in
[1:28:20] a body of flesh is exactly the pattern
[1:28:24] that God wants to bring about at the
[1:28:26] end. We're not going to be, as brother
[1:28:28] Brandham said, little like ghostlike
[1:28:30] wisps floating around. We are going to
[1:28:32] have physical bodies. They're just not
[1:28:35] like this physical body. Praise God. At
[1:28:37] least 100 pounds lighter. But it's going
[1:28:40] to be a physical body that can eat and
[1:28:43] drink and all the things that um God
[1:28:46] made us to do. But he said that it would
[1:28:49] our soul would be like a watered garden.
[1:28:52] And then of course he took one of his
[1:28:54] ribs and put him into a a deep sleep.
[1:28:56] And why is that important? Because
[1:28:58] that's close to his heart. And so now we
[1:29:02] read something else that I'm going to
[1:29:03] close on. Therefore shall a man leave
[1:29:06] his father and mother and shall cleave
[1:29:07] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:29:09] flesh. This seems out of place. There's
[1:29:11] been no marriage. There's been no
[1:29:13] children. There's been no fathers and
[1:29:14] mothers. So, what's this doing there?
[1:29:19] If you have your Bibles, you can flash
[1:29:21] back and we'll close our promise in a
[1:29:22] minute. Um, just one last thought. Um,
[1:29:26] let's see. Uh, it's in the last stages
[1:29:29] of chapter 1. Um, he says,
[1:29:34] uh, put my glasses on if I could find
[1:29:37] them. Oh, here we go. Um, so where is
[1:29:40] that? Ah, yes. Uh, verse, uh, 29.
[1:29:44] And God said, "Behold, I've given you
[1:29:46] every herbbearing seed which is upon the
[1:29:48] face of all the earth, and every tree in
[1:29:51] which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[1:29:52] seed, and to you it shall be for meat."
[1:29:57] You see, brother Brandham says that
[1:29:58] original creation, that spirit creation
[1:30:00] in chapter one couldn't eat or drink.
[1:30:04] So, this is why the the the commentators
[1:30:07] get confused because this looks like
[1:30:08] it's a natural man. Looks like it's a
[1:30:10] natural person because he says it shall
[1:30:12] be for meat. But the key is the word
[1:30:15] shall.
[1:30:16] In the same way that the key is the word
[1:30:19] shall when we get to uh the end of uh
[1:30:23] chapter two or or close to the end where
[1:30:26] he says that a man shall leave his
[1:30:28] father and mother and shall cleave. So
[1:30:31] you can see that this is this is this is
[1:30:34] Moses I suppose writing in his
[1:30:36] commentary about oh is this why it
[1:30:39] happens. Now I'm gonna uh see if I can
[1:30:42] swing to the very last um
[1:30:45] uh oh genie I need a pin. You can just
[1:30:51] shout it out. Oh it's actually brother
[1:30:54] brother James. Whose computer is this?
[1:30:57] Genie. Oh dear.
[1:31:04] Everybody got that?
[1:31:07] Thanks sister Genie. All right, let's uh
[1:31:11] shame. All right, let's just uh flash
[1:31:14] ahead here because I I want to get to
[1:31:16] this last part.
[1:31:18] Oh, see I told you there'd be a
[1:31:20] rebellion and they see all the things
[1:31:22] we're missing here. Um that's why I'm
[1:31:25] scrolling through. I could have just
[1:31:26] jumped. Uh
[1:31:30] uh
[1:31:33] yeah, 47.
[1:31:36] All right. Thank you.
[1:31:38] All right. So, when we get to this part
[1:31:40] Oh. Oh, this is Oh, this is my computer.
[1:31:44] Yeah, it's um it's 49.
[1:31:48] This is confusing.
[1:31:50] I'm glad you guys are staying with me.
[1:31:52] It's actually keeping you all awake. Did
[1:31:54] you get it? Slide 49.
[1:31:59] That's it.
[1:32:00] So, I just wanted you to see the
[1:32:02] difference between chapter 2 and and
[1:32:05] chapter 3. Chapter two ends with, "And
[1:32:07] they were both naked, the man and his
[1:32:09] wife, and were not ashamed."
[1:32:12] Chapter three, God comes
[1:32:16] to them and Adam says, "I was afraid
[1:32:20] because I was naked, I hid myself." So
[1:32:22] to go from not ashamed to afraid, and
[1:32:26] it's not just that, and it's not just
[1:32:28] that he's afraid,
[1:32:30] he no longer has the clothing of
[1:32:32] righteousness. Remember from Isaiah that
[1:32:35] that that he was clothed in
[1:32:37] righteousness. Now he no longer has that
[1:32:41] covering of righteousness because of
[1:32:43] sin. And what are those major symptoms
[1:32:46] of sin? We actually covered this in the
[1:32:48] in the adult Bible class. Shame, fear,
[1:32:52] and guilt. Those are the main things
[1:32:55] that you'll run into when sin lies at
[1:32:58] the door, so to speak, is that you will
[1:33:00] you'll feel shame. you'll have this this
[1:33:03] uh sense of fear of the word, fear of
[1:33:06] God. Remember, it was the voice of God
[1:33:08] in the garden. And they they were now
[1:33:11] afraid of the voice of God. Whereas it
[1:33:13] before it had been a wonderful thing and
[1:33:15] then of course they had the guilt.
[1:33:18] But we'll end with this. The son of man
[1:33:21] has come to seek and to save that which
[1:33:24] was lost. So we do not have to stay in
[1:33:28] the realm of shame, fear, and guilt.
[1:33:32] That's what Adam had to deal with. And
[1:33:34] he tried to cover it up with excuses,
[1:33:37] which is the subject we're covering now
[1:33:38] in the adult Bible class. Shameless plug
[1:33:40] as it is, but please feel free to come
[1:33:43] along and catch the second part of
[1:33:45] excuses. But the problem is their
[1:33:47] excuses didn't work. They were making
[1:33:50] excuses about how they could cover up
[1:33:53] their shame, fear, and guilt with
[1:33:55] excuses. God's not interested in your
[1:33:57] excuses. God just wants you to come
[1:34:00] honestly and throw yourself on his mercy
[1:34:03] because he came to seek and to save that
[1:34:05] which is lost. And he proved that in the
[1:34:08] garden in the garden of Eden. So you can
[1:34:10] see how this all ties together. So Lord
[1:34:12] bless you. Let's stand and uh thank you
[1:34:15] for your your time tonight.
[1:34:19] Amen.
[1:34:24] All right. I'll just leave that.
[1:34:27] Thanks, brother Paul. God bless you.
[1:34:31] That's all right.
[1:34:38] Praise the Lord. I was going to have
[1:34:40] Brandon in the service. I just wanted to
[1:34:42] get up and first of all apologize to
[1:34:44] brother Steve. Is nothing worse than the
[1:34:46] technical things uh messing up for a
[1:34:48] teacher, but we all want to say it
[1:34:51] didn't matter tonight. Uh there's a a
[1:34:55] just tons of material there and little
[1:34:58] revelations and nuggets that I hope we
[1:35:01] were all listening. So we apologize,
[1:35:04] brother, and we want you to, you know, I
[1:35:06] asked brother um Stephen, you know, how
[1:35:09] many Wednesdays he needed, which I'm
[1:35:12] open to however many it takes. Uh and he
[1:35:15] said, you know, Genesis 1 and 2, three
[1:35:17] services. And so, but I realized tonight
[1:35:19] I looked in my Bible, there's 50
[1:35:22] chapters to Genesis
[1:35:24] and I know he didn't feel like he, you
[1:35:27] know, I know a preacher and you just
[1:35:28] with these nervous things of these
[1:35:31] computers going on and and just and then
[1:35:33] not being able to just settle into it. I
[1:35:35] know that he could break down. I I
[1:35:38] wanted to say how blessed we are in this
[1:35:40] day, but also for the young people and
[1:35:42] everybody. I hope this builds a value in
[1:35:46] your Bible to not just skim over things
[1:35:49] because every word
[1:35:52] has a meaning. Every word, brother Rem
[1:35:55] says, everyone reveals Jesus Christ and
[1:35:58] his redemption. It's related to your
[1:36:00] life. And we look at this big old book,
[1:36:02] we think, oh my, there just so much
[1:36:04] there. But you got to settle down. And I
[1:36:05] like teachers to settle down, take their
[1:36:07] time, take each word because there's
[1:36:10] such depth in every word. We found it in
[1:36:13] first first uh of Genesis, 2 Genesis,
[1:36:16] and it's the seed chapter, and we have
[1:36:18] redemption, and we have all the themes
[1:36:20] running through there, running through
[1:36:22] the Bible. And I love when he goes into
[1:36:23] Ezekiel and those other because it ties
[1:36:25] it together with it. So, I just want to
[1:36:27] show my appreciation tonight. And I want
[1:36:29] him to, you know, that's the thing with
[1:36:31] a pastor, too. we have a lot of time to
[1:36:34] take serious and take our time with
[1:36:36] something. And I've had uh people say to
[1:36:39] me, "Take your time because we're in no
[1:36:42] hurry." Sometimes we have to get going
[1:36:43] on a Wednesday night, but as far as the
[1:36:45] series, we want to hear. We don't want
[1:36:47] to skip over things. We'd like to hear
[1:36:49] it. How many would say that? Amen. So,
[1:36:51] we'll give him some more services. if he
[1:36:53] wants to do the 50 chapters of Genesis,
[1:36:56] we I don't know how we'll figure that
[1:36:58] out because I know he didn't get to
[1:37:01] finish Genesis 2 like he wanted to. So,
[1:37:03] we'll work something out. But praise God
[1:37:05] for the word and just what I what I have
[1:37:08] received so much out of the the the what
[1:37:11] the Lord has shown brother Stephen in
[1:37:12] this is to see the f the difference in
[1:37:15] creation and formation
[1:37:17] to see how God created the things and
[1:37:20] then all of a sudden now he's going to
[1:37:23] take the thing he's already created and
[1:37:26] form it. That's our lives.
[1:37:29] So in other words, God doesn't have to
[1:37:30] create something. He's already created
[1:37:33] in you what he wants to do. But then he
[1:37:36] takes this flesh man and begins forming
[1:37:38] him into that original image that he's
[1:37:41] already created. You see, and it says
[1:37:44] all of that in first and second uh
[1:37:46] Genesis there. It's it's it's amazing.
[1:37:48] And and so then he goes through all the
[1:37:50] process. Then he says then he brings
[1:37:51] them to a positioning. All the things he
[1:37:53] created, he he brings them to a position
[1:37:56] because once they're in a position, then
[1:37:58] God can be again to form them into what
[1:38:00] he really wants. Let me say don't
[1:38:02] underestimate with all your past and
[1:38:05] with all your troubles. If it's today or
[1:38:07] the past, whatever it is, don't
[1:38:08] underestimate what God has already
[1:38:11] governed over your life to give you the
[1:38:13] right trials and to allow the certain
[1:38:15] things in your life to bring you to an
[1:38:17] expected end. And I'm not talking about
[1:38:19] the person next to you. I'm talking
[1:38:21] about you. I'm talking about you. There
[1:38:24] is a purpose in your life that's much
[1:38:27] bigger than you can even comprehend in
[1:38:29] this mind. You can't even comprement and
[1:38:31] hind. And these don't try to figure it
[1:38:33] out in your mind. That's why we need the
[1:38:35] mind of Christ. But when we get into
[1:38:37] these things, we're we're we're
[1:38:39] exploring into the very mind of God to
[1:38:42] see, wow, this is bigger than any of us.
[1:38:45] And he's got a plan. He's got a purpose.
[1:38:47] He's got an expected end. And he's
[1:38:50] forming you into something, whatever it
[1:38:52] takes. And God's committed to his word.
[1:38:55] That means he's committed to you. And it
[1:38:58] doesn't matter how many years it takes.
[1:39:00] It doesn't matter how low you've gotten
[1:39:02] to the myy clay that you would get into.
[1:39:04] He his redemption is going to pull you
[1:39:06] out and begin forming you into what you
[1:39:08] need to be. Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:39:11] you.
[1:39:13] God is good. Amen. Thank you, Father,
[1:39:16] for your word tonight.
[1:39:18] Thank you, Lord, for our brother that
[1:39:20] you have brought this gift to us, Lord.
[1:39:23] Him and his wife and daughter moving
[1:39:24] into us. and we have enjoyed what you
[1:39:27] show him, Lord, in the word. We
[1:39:29] appreciate it. Thank you, Lord, for all
[1:39:31] of the gifts that you have sent our way
[1:39:33] and so many uh wonderful things and ways
[1:39:37] they look at the word of God. We're just
[1:39:39] so blessed even in this in the bride
[1:39:42] worldwide and then we're blessed in this
[1:39:43] local congregation, Lord. And you you've
[1:39:46] given us such resources to be able to
[1:39:49] grow in our journey of faith with you,
[1:39:51] Lord, and grow in revelation. Lord,
[1:39:54] you've sent us so many good gifts and so
[1:39:56] many things. And you know, Lord, I've
[1:39:57] been through the summer taking some of
[1:40:00] these wind Wednesdays and giving them to
[1:40:02] these brothers and because we need to
[1:40:03] hear what you have shown them. We need
[1:40:06] to hear the things that you've dropped
[1:40:07] in their heart, Lord. So, we want to
[1:40:09] give them time as well. We appreciate
[1:40:11] this is not a a one-man show, Lord. If
[1:40:14] there is one man in all this, it's the
[1:40:16] man Christ Jesus. Every time we hear
[1:40:18] things, it makes you bigger in our eyes.
[1:40:21] Lord, I pray the young people tonight
[1:40:22] that are listening would get the value.
[1:40:24] Even if it's someone, Lord, that that
[1:40:27] it's they're older, but they haven't
[1:40:28] seen the value of their Bibles and the
[1:40:30] value of the word and how every word has
[1:40:34] such a powerful meaning behind it and
[1:40:36] revelation behind it. May it give them a
[1:40:38] hunger to be in the word of God. I pray
[1:40:41] you'd do that. Lord, bless us as we go
[1:40:43] to our homes tonight. Um know some have
[1:40:45] traveled, Lord, from Lima, different
[1:40:47] places. put your angels around us, Lord,
[1:40:49] as we go home with our families. We're
[1:40:51] thankful, Lord, for your grace and love
[1:40:53] in our lives. And we just live each day,
[1:40:56] Lord. Your mercies are new every
[1:40:58] morning. And we live on those mercies.
[1:41:00] Thank you, Father. And we just commit
[1:41:02] the evening to you now in Jesus name.
[1:41:04] Amen. I was remembering that song my
[1:41:07] sister Sherry wrote or one of I think it
[1:41:09] was Sherry. Um, it's all coming back to
[1:41:12] me now. Anybody ever heard that song?
[1:41:14] It's all coming back to me now. Where
[1:41:16] were you, Job, when the sons of God
[1:41:18] shouted for joy? And she says it's all,
[1:41:21] she said in the song, it's uh I remember
[1:41:24] the joy. I remember. Help me out,
[1:41:26] Sherry.
[1:41:28] Come up here real quick and help me out
[1:41:30] with this.
[1:41:32] I remember the joy. I Isaac sings it,
[1:41:36] but
[1:41:38] he's been up here enough tonight, I
[1:41:39] think. And
[1:41:42] you ever heard that one? Okay.
[1:41:46] If you don't remember the verses, just
[1:41:47] sing the chorus.
[1:41:50] I remember the joy
[1:41:54] and I remember the peace
[1:41:57] and I remember the worship. Pharaoh,
[1:42:00] what a sweet release.
[1:42:04] I remember the love.
[1:42:08] I was in the mind of God.
[1:42:14] I remember
[1:42:16] some way somehow
[1:42:19] it's all coming back to me now.
[1:42:24] I remember the joy
[1:42:27] and I remember the peace
[1:42:30] and I remember the worship there. Oh,
[1:42:34] what a sweet release.
[1:42:38] I remember the love
[1:42:42] I was in the mind of God.
[1:42:47] I remember
[1:42:50] some way somehow.
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:53] It's all coming back to me now.

[1:43:17] But when we start to tap into the mind
[1:43:18] of God, it's all starting to cuz we we
