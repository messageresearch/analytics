Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, "Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord, and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen." So it was very rough times down the road from when Elijah pronounced judgment on the whole generation, the whole nation. And so they're this this godly woman is living under the shadow and the the glooiness and the debt and all that's happening. And now they want to take her sons, take her family under the debt. Creditors are coming. She appeals to Elisha, not Elijah. Elisha. And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in thy house?" And she said, "Thy handmmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil." Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have anything but a little pot of oil. And then he said, "Go, borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels. Borrow not a few. And when thou when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full." So this is not a public show. The third pole is not a public show. Shut yourself in your house with your sons and start pouring that oil into these vessels. She went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out. And it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son, "Bring me yet a vessel." And he said, "There is not a vessel more." And the oil stayed. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the oil stayed. And then she came and told the man of God and he said, "Go sell the oil, pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest." Praise be to God. So in Matthew 25, we have three parables that are related to the seventh seal or the coming of the Lord. And that parable spoke about the first parable spoke about was about the oil that was essential to finish the journey. It's about five wise virgins, five foolish virgins. And the only difference in the two, there wasn't hardly there wasn't hardly any difference in those two groups gathering. They were virgins. Uh they were sanctified. They loved the Lord. They took the journey in the message to go meet the bridegroom. They were all in the same group, but the only difference is one had oil in their lamps. The other didn't have oil in their lamps. And so we were speaking about this oil that is needed at the end time. the last thing that they needed for the last leg of the journey was oil. The only thing, the main thing. And so if that's a theme right now in the last days for our lives, then we should be saying, "Lord, there's one thing most important in me and my family's life. Do we have the oil? And do we have enough of the Holy Spirit to finish the journey?" Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that should be dominating our minds more than any business adventure, more than any family problem, more than any sickness. Lord, do I have the oil? &gt;&gt; And he made it the most prominent thing in the parable of the seventh seal and the coming of the Lord. And so it became essential. Uh what I'm basically preaching is essential oil. &gt;&gt; This is the the real essential oil. that I'm preaching about. And so now the foolish virgins, they discovered that they didn't have it the last minute. They discovered they had everything and they loved the Lord and they had all this, but they discovered they didn't have the oil. They came in the message to pursue the bridegroom. They heard the midnight cry because when it says midnight, how many know when it says midnight, that's at the darkest time. So it was at the darkest hour when the world had become dark when it had become full of perversion and everything that it was at that time the midnight cry the final cry went out rise up it's time to meet the bridegroom and take the last the last step of the journey to meet the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And so they were virgins. They were sanctified. They they re they rejoiced in all this cry. They they actually woke up to the cry. It wasn't just the wise virgins that woke up. They woke up too. They all woke up. I heard the cry. I heard the midnight cry. They all were trimmed their lamps. All were the same as far as trim. They were pure good people. The prophet mentions they were pure good people, sanctified vessels of God, &gt;&gt; but lacking the oil to take the final leg of the journey. &gt;&gt; And that's pretty serious. I can't preach it any more serious than what the parable gives it. It's for our time. It's for right now. And so now, if that's the essential thing, there shouldn't be any other more essential thing in our lives. Except, Lord, every teenager ought to be saying, "I can't get in on my parents coattail." Every teenager should be going to God and say, "That's what the parable said. My God warned me that the only thing lacking was the oil. I better make sure, God, I'm seeking the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; for myself. If my dad don't have it, my mom don't have it, it doesn't matter. I've got to seek this for myself, it's more important than anything in life. &gt;&gt; How many would say amen to that? &gt;&gt; If Jesus said it was important and that's the parable we're living in right now and you're interested in the coming of the Lord and you're interested in meeting the bridegroom, if you're interested in that, then you have to have the oil. &gt;&gt; You have to have the Holy Spirit. You have to know that you have the Holy Spirit in your life. Not just that you love God, but there's an identification of the depth of your soul that I believe this word of this hour and I'm following it as best I can with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; It's gambling with your life to think that trimming your lamp every now and then is enough. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what the parable says? It is is gambling with your life to think that trimming my lamp every now and then in church or being stirred to wake up by the midnight cry is enough. It was not enough. It is not enough to depend on others. It's not enough today to only open your Bible just at church. It's not enough to overcome this midnight hour of darkness with just being a good boy. It's more than being a good boy. It's more than being a good girl. It's not enough to wear the right clothes. It's not enough just to attend a message church. You have to have the whole true Holy Spirit, the oil in your life. Excuse me for being so straight, but you can't get any more straight than what the parable preaches to you. Some were lacking oil and they discovered it and they said, "Oh, can" and then they tried to depend on and take from oil from the other ones and they said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute." And I feel like I have to say that to people sometimes because people can be so needy and they're clinging to something and what they're what they're clinging to clinging to sometimes is their own lack of the Holy Ghost themselves and they see the strength in you. But you see now I'm saying I've got enough just for myself to finish the journey. &gt;&gt; That's what they said. The wiser. We only have enough for oursel to finish this journey. &gt;&gt; Go to them that buy and sell. Go get it yourself. &gt;&gt; Come through the same thing. Do the same thing. Sell out to yourself to get what's needed. And I want to say this lastly about Matthew 25. It's about having what's needed to finish this journey. &gt;&gt; It's not that you started this journey in the message. &gt;&gt; It's about how you end. &gt;&gt; Can I get any help this morning? &gt;&gt; It's not that you start. Praise the Lord that you started. Praise the Lord that you believe. Praise the Lord that you set on a journey to see the bridegroom. Praise the Lord you started. But from my all the Bible things, Bible scriptures that I read and I'm going to read some to you this morning. It's not about just that you started. It's how you end. &gt;&gt; It's how the the the journey ends. Can you say amen? And how tragic it would be that you started the journey, but now you're kind of doubting and you're kind of phasing out. No. No. This is not the time to phase out. This is not the time to stop praying. It's the time to pray more. This is not the time to become more worldly and dabble in more worldly things. It's the time to become more sanctified. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you say amen? The last hour, the last leg of the trip, the last run of the race. It's not the time to be dillydallying around. It's time to run with all of our hearts. It's time to go forward. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's not the time to get lexadasical. It's not the time to get loose. It's not the time to look for things you can get by with. Is that the time I think of Jesus when he was in the garden? His last hours there, it got so dark and his disciples, he took them in to pray. They fell asleep in the garden. They all fell asleep because why did they fall asleep? They didn't recognize the hour that they were in. This is it. This is a wrap-up. And it's not a time to sleep. It's time to pray. Brothers, I need your prayers. But they couldn't do it because they didn't recognize the hour. Anybody who recognizes this hour right now, the final seconds, we're not three minutes before midnight. We're just a few seconds before midnight. And anybody who catches that revelation is not praying less. They're praying more. They're not they're not they're not pulling away and getting more bitter. They're saying, "Lord, heal my bitterness. Take me closer to you." &gt;&gt; Anybody who recognizes where we're at right now, there's going to be changes in their life. &gt;&gt; The oil is the most essential thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to live and I want to be filled with it. And so, you know, that's the thing is the is the final stage of the journey, the final life. This is not a time to be dabbling and playing around and playing church. It's not the time for it. And when Jesus was in that garden, that's what I was finishing. Jesus was in there. He come and woke him up. He said, "Go ahead and take your rest now." But he said, "This hour, the Bible says that Jesus, he prayed. He come and found them sleeping. He prayed again. And the Bible says he prayed more earnestly than he'd ever prayed. &gt;&gt; In Jesus' final hours, &gt;&gt; it was not this attitude. This is all wrapped up anyway. It's just about over. I'm predestinated to do this. &gt;&gt; Oh, how many predestinated people that think they're so predestinated? And we heard it Wednesday night from brother Rap. I love to say amen to the truths of predestination. I believe God knew me before the foundation of the world. But that doesn't justify laziness. That actually should build faith to say, "I'm one of them and I'm going to finish this journey." Well, I'm going to finish this journey filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's not a things that I'm predestined. Jesus say, "Well, this whole thing's predestinated anyway. I'm supposed to go to the cross." And and so he just lays back and he said, "You know why you guys are sleeping? Make make some room for me. I'm going to lay down and take a nap, too." &gt;&gt; Bible says he prayed more earners. He didn't pray less. He prayed more. &gt;&gt; He entered in more. Anybody hearing what I'm saying this morning? &gt;&gt; And so in the darkest hour, the final leg of the journey, that's not the time to play around. Can you say amen? That's not the time to be doing something less. That's not the time to be moving along in the social media with the direction that the defectors are going and the people who left the message and keeping your eye, man, look what they're getting to do now. Look at Oh, look what they get to wear now. This is not the time to be looking at them. They if they keep going, they're fitted for destruction. Are you called to that? No, you're not called to that. It's not a time to loosen up and say, "God, I need more of you." &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." This not a time to be just just say, "Oh, this we're here. We're going to finish it up. Let's finish well. Let's finish the last leg." Well, let's run with patience the race that sets before us. &gt;&gt; It's about finishing well. It's not that you had enough to start. It's about you had enough oil to start. It's about do you have enough to end. It's about finishing. It's not that you started. I'll come back to that in just a minute. With all the scriptures that talked about talk about God's interested in how we finish, not just that we start with the Lord. There's so many types about Elijah and Elisha concerning this day. I don't have time, but I want to bring out one first of all, and that is Elisha and Elijah both had meetings with widows, with women, &gt;&gt; and they were widows. And they were living in a dark time, both of them. And they had a need during the dark time. That's a type of the bride. Because we live in the darkest times. We live in a time of debt spiritually. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We're in in debt. The world's in debt spiritually. We're in a time that they want to take our children. How many raise your hand? They want to take our children. &gt;&gt; So all these scenarios are here. And both these women had some Elijah came to one, Elisha came to another one. And it's interesting how they dealt with them. They live they lived in famine. They lived in debt. They lived in depressing times. They lived in a time of loss. They were barely getting by. But then the scripture says in chapter four, I read to you, "But in the middle of that, there cried a woman." Under those conditions, a woman cried. Now, wasn't there other people crying during that time? Wasn't there other women crying? I'd say there was. I'd say because of the depressing times and the debt and all the the depression, there was probably other women that had tears. And and that's fine. God knows about that, too. But yet God, this this one, these women got God's attention. Their cry got God's attention. &gt;&gt; And so now that's a wonderful thing to recognize that they both went to widow women and that was to their that was their ministry because Elijah, he had a dispensational ministry. He spoke to the whole nation. He brought a curse on Jezebel. He brought a curse on Ahab and the whole house of Ahab, which was a Jehovah Gyra believing king. He was the king of of Israel. but he married the wrong woman. And so now Elijah came to put a curse on all that thing and he stopped up the heavens. There was no rain. There was famine in the land. All the conditions, a lot of the Oh boy, let me say it. A lot of the conditions we're in right now is because Elijah came in this hour and he spoke the word and our nation and our world rejected Elijah. And that's why we're in the conditions that we're in. &gt;&gt; So remember that. Can you say amen? It's because Elijah has come that we live in these conditions. But the bride has to live in it until the rapture time. The bride's living in these conditions. And so there was others crying, but this one got their attention and they went to these women. So now I want you to notice something else. There was a change in leadership from it was the same message, but there was a a bit of change in leadership from Elijah to Elisha because we know that Elijah had a double portion of the spirit of the prophet. Elijah called fire down from heaven. He spoke to the entire dispensation. and Elijah. He rebuked the whole generation. His indictment was to the whole religious system. He spoke boldly to Jezebel. But Elisha Elisha, he didn't do all that. He didn't speak judgment to the whole uh generation and dispensation. He didn't have to. Elijah had already done it. &gt;&gt; It's not to the whole generation. But Elisha's ministry was more to the personal effect. &gt;&gt; It wasn't to the nation. And it was more to the person. &gt;&gt; It was to non. It was to this widow woman. It was dealing personally. Anytime he got involved with preachers, it didn't go so well. Remember when he first was first finished there, they were looking for Elijah. They said, "We're we got to go find Elijah. Would you come with us?" He said, "You know, Elijah's gone on in the chariot. They're trying to bring Elijah back. &gt;&gt; They're trying to act like Elijah's still here." And there's a change in administration from the hymn to the she from Elijah to Elisha. And I'm telling you, Elijah spoke to the whole, he indicted the entire religious system. Not the people, but he indicted the entire religious system for crucifying the son of God. Aresh again. &gt;&gt; But Elisha when he came, he didn't do that. It was more of a personal level to meet the God meeting the personal needs, personal revival, not a national revival, a personal healing to individuals, a personal restoration to individuals, not judgment. Now, I want to say to you that God is still a God of judgment. And God may put us back in line when we're out of line, but for the most part, we're not here now to pronounce judgment like Elijah did. Anytime a a pastor or ministry today tries to be the prophet and pronounce judgment on everything, he's out of his office. He can give discernment. He can give counsel. But when he takes in his hand, pronounce judgment over the whole thing. He's taken the office of a prophet. And you're not a prophet. You're a pastor. Elijah, he pronounced judgment of the whole system. Jezebel, he wasn't afraid of judgment. He was bo just telling it like it is. And but but Elisha, his matter was more to the personal thing. And I just want to say once again about judgment. The bride is the true bride is no longer under the judgments of God. &gt;&gt; She has the Holy Ghost. She's pass judgment. &gt;&gt; So why do you keep bringing judgment on the bride? She's pass judgment. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "What about when Elisha called two she bears out of the woods because he got offended at his complex about his bald head?" Oh, I got another sermon. &gt;&gt; One of the things preachers needs to two or three things pre preachers have to grow out of personally in their walk with God, they've got to grow out of their complexes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes they preach their complexes and not the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that day, if you think that he was, that's the day that Elisha was acting like Elijah a little bit because he's going to call the she bears out and kill those kids. And brother Bram said he that was not the Holy Spirit. That was him acting &gt;&gt; in his own way. &gt;&gt; But it looked like Elijah. He's getting out of step. His ministry wasn't Elijah to pronounce judgment like that. It was Elisha. And so he acted out of place. He made a mistake. &gt;&gt; Did I say that on national? &gt;&gt; He made a mistake. &gt;&gt; And he preached his own complex. Amen. &gt;&gt; Should we go through the Bible and talk about Moses, the great prophet, who made a mistake &gt;&gt; and one day struck the rock twice because of his frustration with the people and his temper got up to the people so bad. He was supposed to strike it once and struck it twice, made a mistake. God said, "Your temper, that thing, you're not even going in the promised land." &gt;&gt; It's in your Bible. Everybody hold your Bible. It's It's in there. &gt;&gt; God's true prophet definitely. &gt;&gt; But he made a mistake there. He got in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And so Elisha, that's the one time, I don't know why I'm elaborating on this. It's not in my notes, but I like to say that he called them out. He shouldn't have done that because once again, it's this whole thing is that the administration or the leadership had changed under Elisha. Even though the spirit was a double portion, the administration of it changed a bit because it was not to speak to the nation. There was not to be a national revival. That was that day he called fire down and then Israel they all they come around that he did Elijah was to do that. Can you say amen? Around the country almost in every major city in this nation Elijah spoke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Elisha he ministers and he ministers personally. It's not a national revival. And so now one of the things that Elisha does clearly is when someone has a need, he always asks for them to do something first &gt;&gt; before he meets the need. Now Elijah had the power. Somebody was out of money or somebody had Elijah, he just say, "Okay, it's yours. That's it. It's yours." But somehow with Elisha, he's asking for them to do something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then they get their miracle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Non was struck with leprosy and he comes send he didn't even go himself. He said you you go and tell non he needs to dip seven times in the dirtiest river in all of Israel Jordan. He needs to go dip seven times and then he'll receive my healing. Now this is a great man and he's and he doesn't even come himself. My dad used to say that the servant knocked on the door and non came to the door and his servant he said I asked for Elisha to come. He said, "Elijah said he's not coming. He just sent me, his servant." &gt;&gt; Well, I want to see the man. I want to see the pastor himself. Good thing he didn't have that attitude. &gt;&gt; But he says, um, he said, "If you go down and dip seven times in Jordan, you'll be healed." &gt;&gt; Just at that moment is a test of your faith. But it's God asking you to do something dirty. Not dirty in the sense of sinful, but doing something that's not convenient, not easy. Go dip seven times. Okay. All right. I'll go do it. And maybe he was grumbling the whole time. I wanted to see Elijah. I wanted to see the guy. And he goes down. This is the muddiest river in in all of Israel, the Jordan. Why couldn't he pick this? How could he why? Oh, why do I have to do this? He dips. finish the story. He went ahead and dipped seven times and when he come out he was healed of his leprosy. &gt;&gt; So this prophet was asking you to do something first. A personal contact with God through Elisha, but he's asking for you to do something first. And he did that with this woman. He says,"Woman, what do you have need of? What can I do for you?" And she says, "They're going to take my sons. We're in debt. You know, my husband's gone. I'm a widow. He served you with the fear of God. He loved the message of the hour. He's gone. We're under the pressure of this famine and they're going to take my children. I have nothing. He said, "You have nothing." She said, "I have nothing." "Do you have anything?" Well, I've got a pot of oil left. Now, when Elijah dealt with the widow woman, she had a little a little meal and she had a little bit of oil. And he says, "I want you to take that and make a cake." She said, "Well, I'm making the cake. It's my last cake for me and my son to die. We're going to That's it. We're finished. It's our last meal. Go and make the cake. Take what oil you have, put it together, make a cake, and bring the cake to me so I can eat. &gt;&gt; God knows how to test you &gt;&gt; in what you won't give up. &gt;&gt; But she did it and she got a miracle. And this woman said, "All right." And he said, "Go get all the vessels. Empty them all. Make sure there's nothing in the vessels. Empty out the vessels." And and and then you start bringing this together and their son son started to do it behind closed doors in a secret place with God and they filled every vessel up. Every empty vessel vessel was filled with the oil. Can you say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; It's a type of our day. &gt;&gt; Bring your empty vessel to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Empty out of yourself. Empty out of your knowledge and your past bitterness and your past experiences. Empty out of your religious pride. Empty out of all of it and say, "God, fill it now with your oil." &gt;&gt; God is a completer. &gt;&gt; How many knows that God is a completer? &gt;&gt; God is not wanting to start something in you. He wants to finish something in you. He that hath begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete a work in you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
