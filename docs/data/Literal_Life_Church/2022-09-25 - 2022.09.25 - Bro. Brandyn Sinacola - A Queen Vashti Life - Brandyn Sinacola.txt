TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just a reminder that we have our fall Fellowship October 15th and there's a sign up sheet for the Sisters in the back on the bulletin board I believe it's down that hallway there so if you could look at that and sign up we'd appreciate that um adult Sunday school will start next Sunday and the boardroom or the Brothers Nursery it's got the big table with all the chairs around it so looks like a board room that's next Sunday that'll start um while our pastor and his wife are out don't worry I'm not bringing another Doctrine or something by saying starting that with that but October is Pastor appreciation month so just wanted to remind you of that like I always always like to do um we're not necessarily you know pulling together for anything but he does have a vacation scheduled for October so if you wanted to contribute to that and give a little I know we're also a reminder from the trustees trying to raise funds for the HVAC system so I know we got a lot going on just in that but do whatever you want just if you feel led to give a little something towards his vacation I know that would be appreciated and uh don't want to keep you standing too long but I just want to say thank you for all the texts and phone calls and the ones who were able to make it to my grandma's funeral and showing a lot of you wanted to and it was just too far and and to be honest that's why I didn't say nothing about it beforehand is because I knew it was just it was just a long drive for us so but I appreciate everyone it was kind of funny getting to the center Cola side I remember a get together years ago for something I was just little and they had they played it's called bocce ball I don't even know how to play it but a bunch of old guys with uh well I won't tell you everything but and just bocce ball and that's what I remember in my mind Italians they had a glass of wine and cigars and things and uh you know so we just never got together with them well it was it was just kind of funny comical because uh you meet uh great uncle Cosmo and uh cousin Luciano Cosmo Valenti and and uh so it was just kind of I mean we always joked you know my dad would do this voice you know like he was in the mob boss you know and and I kid you not I I always never in my life that I expect somebody to sound like that my Dad's cousin walks up and he walked in towards me and I said Dad I think that's cousin Jerry I just remembered him from being little and he walks up and you know shook his hand and he said should I know you I don't know the right answer to that question and then my my uh my dad's Godfather was about yay tall and uh I walked up and he looked at my dad and he looked at me and he said is that your boy my dad said yeah and he goes he reaches over and he just an old guy you know and he touches me he's a fine boy good looking boy so we I I there were some good times in there and some tears and things so but uh I do appreciate um everything my dad appreciated everything I passed all everything everyone said to him and so thank you for that so Esther chapter one and verse 9 and I don't I don't see I do I have this too high Hannah no I'm good okay okay also vashti the queen Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house with which belonged to King ahazarus on the seventh day when the heart of the King was Mary with wine he must have been Italian he commanded and I'm just going to skip the names for your sake the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahazarus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on and the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wrath and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner towards all that he that knew the law and judgment and the next unto him was and he lists these seven princes of Persia and Meda which saw the king's face in which sat the first in the Kingdom what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to the law because she hath not performed the Commandment of the king of zarus by the chamberlains and memican answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of King ahazarus for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands and their eyes when it shall be reported the king arthrus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of the Persia and Mita say this day unto all the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and Wrath if it pleased the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before King ahazarus and let the King give her Royal Estate unto another that is better than sheep and when the Kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his Empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honor both to Great and Small and the saying please the king and the princes and the King did according to the word of memokin for he sent letters and to all the king's provinces into every Province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people let's pray and just as we pray if if you want to be remembered in prayer just lift your hand before the Lord Heavenly Father we come before you father and Lord we love you and Lord I pray God that when we fail you father that you would listen to our hearts and and hear our spirit seeing as the song says father Lord we're just mortal men and women and and we fail much but we love you Lord and we're here to hear from you and so I pray God that you would help me to get out of the way and that and that you would speak to us Lord speak to our hearts receive our worship let us be pleasing in your sight Lord dress us now in your word we pray and bless every need behind every hand I pray as the word Goes Forth that you would answer everyone be with the brothers as they travel home from the men's meeting Lord give them traveling Mercies in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated I was I was wanting to go uh one One Direction and and I started in that direction but as I as I got to studying last night it just seemed like the Lord took me in this other direction so um I haven't done my notes how I usually do I hate notes anyway so if this just goes kaplop then um I don't know what to say but I've been real inspired um brother Paul got a new sign in his office and and it it's where Mordecai tells Esther for such a time as this and and that was inspiring enough and then and then I heard something in a message and I just want to save that because um it looks like Lord willin we might be speaking um January 1st and now I'll be speaking to an empty congregation because I gave the data just kidding um because I'd be preaching but I just want to hold that because it just felt like a good message for maybe the new year but I've been inspired by it and then just finding something wholesome to watch with with the family and if you've never seen or heard of Sight and Sound it's a it's a great production of of gospel stories and um and they did the Book of Esther and I I I I I pray that I could bring some inspiration like they brought because it was just so good and and watching it and um some of the just some of the songs and the different things and watching this story unfold um you read it you can be inspired but there's also something when you apply a visual to it that just seems to help and so it just it just lit a fire and so I started I started going through it and I was just kind of all over the place yesterday but there's in the message um searching for even the name of Esther I think it only came up 15 times and um one of the times was speaking to a woman in the prayer line and and then the majority of that was actually in one message I believe it was called marriage of the Lamb so I was went and listened to that and as I was listening that's where I got kind of a different direction and I just it it astonished me to see there's actually the way that the the books of the Bible line up Esther would have fallen in between the time of Ezra and Nehemiah she would have been queen during that time one of the things that just thrilled my heart might be an odd thing to throw the Heart by but is in that Sight and Sound they're bringing history at one point and one of the things that was that I would like to get to sometime maybe not today is we all know Esther's uh Nemesis so to speak was Haman and Heyman actually is a descendant from the King that Saul let live the Lord told Saul destroy everything destroy the the men the women the children the cattle destroy it all don't leave anything and and Saul thinking he was doing something great for some reason disobeyed the word of the Lord and he let a king live and the cattle Live Well The Descendant from that King is where Haman came from and so you see you know it's it's just it's astounding to me to see that one Disobedience to the word of God years later generations later had a huge effect that that God's people would almost be completely wiped out because one man's disobedience and we can apply that to our lives and and maybe I want to get into that just a little bit later too but um we'll see as we go here so there's a lot of parallels in the Book of Esther and I just I'm just really enjoying it King of zarus from what I can find in the scripture um in one history it says the word was too big so I had to look it up and it just basically meant he was one of the most notable Kings Persian kings this king ahazarus queen Esther's husband in Daniel 11 2 there's a couple Kings with the same names in in there and from what I can gathered it was this King but he was one of the richest of of the Persian Empire a queen and and uh vashti and the other women in the palace in defiance a queen put away and rejected for her rejection of the king's word a beautiful branch predestinated and elected to be Queen chosen for her character a new Queen granted half the kingdom an accuser trying to destroy God's people and I and I just I just wrote those down this morning because I know that there's more lying in there and and I'm just excited to get into it a bit but what I saw here in in talking about vashti it might seem like this is a harsh scenario the king calls he's he's drunk for one um not saying God's a drunk but typing this king with with God as as you see his Queen Esther is a type of the bride and and you can watch those parallels so to me this King you know the richest and the most notable well there's none bigger than God there's none greater than God there's there's he's the king of kings and Lord of lords so there is none above Jehovah amen and and so you see that to begin with and then it was interesting this morning as I was reading this and it talks about his seven princes well over in Revelations you see that God has seven stars in his hand and and that was his seven Messengers and that's the exact same thing that this king is doing as he's calling on his seven Messengers his seven princes to get to get counsel from them and not not necessarily that God get got counsel from His prophets but he had seven Messengers for seven Church ages and and God was counseling them and they were counseling God's people and then he tells them go tell go tell vashti to come here go go get the queen ready and bring her present her before me and before before my kingdom and and this this queen it sounds harsh she said no and you think well he was he was drunk I wouldn't go either but he disobeyed the word and and the thing about the medes and Persians we've been taught before is that that when there's a law and there's a word that is issued before the king that is that is the word that is that must be obeyed and it cannot be changed and we know that God's word it must be obeyed and it cannot be changed what it said in the Old Testament it says in the New Testament it can run you can run it back and through you can't change it anyone that adds or takes away from it is their name is taken from the book of life regardless of what you feel about the word regardless of what you feel about that portion that God is God has spoken to your life if you disobey it then I just say be careful you you should repent and come back to the word because this this queen vashti she she disobeyed the word of the king she denied the king uh uh her presence she denied him uh entry into her life and and for that she was put away and we know that you can now run this story over into into the Book of Revelations when when he says he calls the church a harlot in in in her daughters and she rejected the word of the Lord she would have been his bride but he had to put her away because she rejected his words she didn't obey she she killed the prophet she disobeyed the law she didn't she tried she's changed the law she's changed the word of God and God says for that I'm putting you away you you're a harlot you're going you're giving yourself to another and I can't have you that way so and and then you see Esther come into the picture and and she's a she's a she's a virgin you're you're dealing with all these these virgins in the story and we know that there's five wise virgins and five full foolish virgins and and and the the five wise have their lamps trimmed and ready to go they're ready to go see the king and and and then there's five foolish that are asleep and and and and they're put away in in other words so what sounds harsh is actually all throughout the word of God because of the reaction to the word and so I just want to look at vashti for a little bit this morning if if the Lord will help us and and like I said I just didn't intend that so it was just it's just different for me but um she had a lack of submission for God's word and and what this shows is she wasn't connected with the King the king made a request for the queen and and any Queen you think about it your king is the richest in all the land he's the most notable and and and he's he's all powerful and and you would think it would be a a privilege to go before the Queen the king but this this queen she wasn't connected she was she was called Queen she was called wife but yet there was no there was no relationship there was no connection and we know that God doesn't want us to just come to church this morning and just sit here and and and not have a connection and a relationship with him we don't we don't and I don't want to be a queen a a bride that that when when the king calls for me that I just say not you know ah you know forget it I don't want to be that kind of bride I want to be a bride that says when when when they look on me they see the Majesty of the king they see the glory of the king [Music] so she wasn't connected she didn't have that that connection with the King that would have drawn her into his presence being summoned and and we know that later on in the story that it was actually she couldn't come before him on her own accord she had to be summoned to become before the king otherwise she was put to death if the king didn't Grant her mercy vashti could put on the crown but the king wanted someone who was connected with him who loved him who reflected who he was in all of his glory who was was uh submissive not because she had to be but because she wanted to be because she loved him she loved him and that was the king's desire and that was that was maybe some of why that they looked at what the what the uh the messenger said and they said you know the saying is good and and let's let's put it in the law let's put it into action because because her heart is far from me I I never had her heart she's just after the the blessing she's after the benefits she's after she's after the Miracles she's after the sign she's after the Wonders but but I'm ahead of myself but but then when we come to God at the there will be those who come to him and said have not I done all these things in your name did I not portray the blessings of of of of of you of your majesty did not I show your glory through that way and he says depart from me you worker of iniquity I never knew you there's no connection there's no there's no are you with me this morning the king he thought maybe that he had her love he thought he had her loyalty he thought he had her submission and yet the King was deceived the queen she just wanted the the the Frills of being Queen she just wanted the title of being Queen but just because you're you're you're in the message just because you sit in a message church you've heard these things before that doesn't make you the queen that doesn't make you that doesn't make you anything but but someone who goes to church it was it was difficult for me because you know you go and you see you see family and and it's a sorrowful time and things and and uh you know you try to encourage them in the Lord and and so they had me they had me talk to him after the showing on um Wednesday and and then the it's Catholic background so the the priest came on Thursday but um you know it was difficult because you're you're you're telling them you know it's it's it was you know it's okay to cry it's okay to that's what we're here for we're here together we're let's you know the love is here it's it's okay it's a grieve and and then the uh priest wasn't there so he didn't hear what I had to say but he contradicted what I said the night before when he got up and spoke so I thought well that don't make me feel too good but and then you know it just the the Just The Way of the world you know so I'm encouraging him and I'm saying you know if grieving as a gospel Minister I said I'm going to encourage you turn to Christ and I read them scripture of Christ is the comforter he wants to comfort them and then we go that night to my aunt's house and they're all you know lighting things up and and drinking things and and I thought well that I must not be much of a minister because that didn't that fell over like a lead balloon but but I did have a thought and brother Dan reminded me this morning one man sows another man waters you know but God gives the increase so I thought well they they heard it they heard it and they looked receptive to it um you know fear not their faces some of them didn't but but they heard it so my prayer is that any time that they go to turn to something else that the words that were spoken would come before their ears and that's my prayer vashti made a vow because when there's when there's a marriage there's there's um I didn't write them down but there's there's a you know there's parts to be leading up to a marriage there's there's a there's a promise or and then there's an engagement and and um I'll have to write this down for next time but but uh you know all these things and when it comes to The Vow the you know you vow your life to each other you vow in sickness and in health until until death do you part and so vashti made a vow but her heart wasn't in it she didn't mean it and you know we we can make vows to the Lord and and oftentimes we do and and I and I thank God for his grace and mercy because oftentimes we can't keep those because we're we're we're fallible human beings and and we might forget that we made the vow we shouldn't but we might forget and and we don't have the capacity or or our heart wasn't where we thought it was yet and so we make these vows and and and and thank God for his grace and mercy but vashti made a vow and her heart wasn't in it Lord I'll serve you all of my days if you'll do this thing I'll serve you all of my days and and then we forget that and then we backslide and then we go and we we entertain things of the world and and and we didn't keep our vow to the Lord and and queen vashti she didn't keep her vow maybe maybe it was to come when the king calls and that was part of her vow and she didn't keep it all these things just showing that that that there's a church if I can say it that way that that their heart's not in it their their heart is actually is drawn to the things of the world and and and our hearts get in those states where we're drawn to the things of the world and we're coming to church and we're worshiping the Lord but when we leave here we we kind of check the time clock and then we go out back to the things that that really we want to do let's just be honest you're drawn away by your own lust amen we all are and it's and it's something that's it's what's in your heart that's coming out and and so it's the same thing that vashti was in so she she she did it for the benefits not the love we said that the king wanted someone who he could who he could be one with he wanted somebody to become part of him he wanted an and vashti by her her expression here by by her actions and her words she actually almost portrays an essence or or a a an air about her that says the king is actually here for me the king wants what what I have and I'm going to withhold that but the scripture tells us in in First Corinthians 11 that man was created uh I'm sorry woman man wasn't created for the woman but woman was created for the man now brother you can take that and you can you can try to treat her like a doormat but you're not catching the image of God there either you're just as wrong as she is by not coming into your world and connecting with you but he wanted a man a man and and just just think of the brothers here and and you know as sisters alike you want to be one with your spouse you want somebody who who your heart is connected with it's not just somebody who uh you know is just a a I don't even know if I had companions the right word but you you know you're not looking for that you're longing for somebody to give your heart to that that will love you and and respect you and honor you and cherish you and be interested in your interest be interested in your heart but hear vashti by her expression she shows she wasn't interested in those things she takes on the air and and I'm not going to say forgive me but sisters we can do that sometimes as we can we can we can express to our husbands that no you were created for me and and that's not scriptural that's not the scripture that's not the way that it is it's quiet that's all right whatever you think about it I would just ask you to to look into your heart and ask if you resist that why do you resist that what what lies let's let's quit playing games let's let's quit being Queen vashti's let's what is in your heart that makes you that puts up a wall against the word of God what's in your heart what is that what is that thing that makes you resistant when you hear the word of God I understand that sometimes it could be the way that maybe maybe a minister said it or maybe maybe it was the way it was presented to you but if you pick up your Bible and you see it in your word then you can't deny it you can try to deny it you can go on denying it but really you're only hurting yourself because the King has spoken and this is the word and it cannot be altered or changed this went into the house of the rules as they call it in the scripture The House of the rules where when they needed when they when the Persian kings wanted to remember something they said go get it go find it in the house of the rules go find the record of it and bring it here I want to make sure that that's what it says and when you do that when you take that regardless of the resistance that you feel in your heart when you take the word of God and you find it in the word then you should ask yourself but Lord be honest there is absolutely nothing was saying wrong with saying Lord I feel a resistance to this and I don't know why or maybe you do know why present it to the Lord talk to the Lord about it listen this is a person of Jesus Christ this isn't some religion this isn't some this isn't something that we come and like I said and and we just come and check in on Sunday so we can be seen or so we can say feel good about ourselves that's I'm I'm tired of that I'm tired of playing church I'm tired of playing games I'm I'm I'm tired of of seeing things of the world creep up in my life I'm tired go that's all right sit on that but I'm telling you the truth because it's in your life too and we should ask ourselves Lord what's the resistance what why do I feel resistant to that what is it that's what you may think I'm crazy you may think I don't care what you think but you should ask yourself what is it that's doing that to me because something's causing you to resist the word of God there's something laying down in there that that you need you who knows the heart and the mind the scripture says nobody knows it save God God tries God knows the heart God tries the Reigns I've been thinking of the scripture the word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and what's it do it pierces down to the dividing of Thunder of Soul and Spirit it goes down into the heart and it and it separates these things for us and it'll tell you it'll pinpoint what's in your life it'll pinpoint that thing that that you're resistant to you now we know that that women has a woman has her apart as well she she's called in Genesis the eve the mother of Life the mother of all living and and it's it's true the the uh I I saw a little smirk on my daughter's face so I that's what made me stop and smile she always says well Dad um you know women can do everything men can do but man can't do everything women can do because man can't have babies and um so we'll save that conversation for another time but but Christ Christ doesn't want you to just come to church Christ doesn't want just a queen that that is is Christ doesn't want a queen that has everything right on the outside but has nothing right on the inside that's not what Christ is after that's that's not why that's not why we get up and we speak about modesty we speak about modesty we speak about these things because because there's something in the heart of God that doesn't he does want you to look right he does want you to dress right men men alike he does want that but but he wants it to go deeper he doesn't want a vashti to just put it on he wants a vashti or a Esther that'll live it out from her heart Christ wants to inject himself into the bride and I'm going to get I'm not going to speak plain I'll be careful here but Christ wants to inject his life into the bride Christ wants his life you can't live this you say but I I've tried brother Brandon and I've tried and I've tried and I've tried and I'm tired I'm tired of trying listen I know that this sounds easier than than what it feels like sometimes but quit trying quit trying let ask God to inject his life into your life so he will live it through you so that there's something on the inside of your heart that that says but but Lord I did that but I really didn't want to do that please forgive me and and and not you know not going out and living a certain way and then coming in and then and then feeling condemned sitting here and and and then getting upset at the preacher because he's preaching that way but listen if we're speaking the law that that God wrote in his Bible then then this is what cannot be altered and it cannot be changed it has to be spoke forth we us as ministers we have to go to the house of the rules we have to find what God is telling us go get that and bring it and read it before the people because they need to hear it Christ wants to inject his life the man and injects his life into the bride not the other way around she takes on his life she takes on his name she takes on his identity the queen here vashti the the this this church that was claiming to be the queen of in claiming Christianity she was she was taking something and she was saying no I am queen vashti I'm the queen he might be the king but I'm the queen my name is vashti not ahu look at it ahazarus it's also called Xerxes it's the same King that's that's that that's not how this works when a woman gets married to a man she she should take the man's name because she she's coming into that man's world she's coming in as as a help meet she's a help meet for him not the other way around now this this Brothers this doesn't mean that's that's not a a green light to treat her any way you want to I'll tell you what you ought to treat her like your queen and then she'll treat you like you're the king just thinking of the scripture Sarah called him Lord but you have to be worthy of that title too the woman takes on the man's name she comes into his world she comes into into his into his life listen when the prophet said that when when a man comes home and he's tired now there should be understanding I'm trying to bring a balance here with these things because you know for so many years it's blessed God you know we're the men well you didn't act like it because the real men wouldn't treat his wife that way but there's nothing like when you come in from work or a hard day there's nothing like you know you you know that that the doctors say I have high blood pressure and this might sound weird but I can have my blood pressure can be up I can feel it's up but my wife can just come over and start touching my shoulders and I can feel my blood pressure start to drop sister that's that's the power that you have that's the attribute that God has given you is to take to take that King who's having who's having a hard day who's who's out fighting battles amongst the world we know you're fighting battles at home too sometimes worse than he has to fight because you're with the children but that's why I say brother you have to have you have to have an understanding for her too but in in and you know I don't I don't I don't believe in the man just coming home sitting down and and then you know he should get up and help a little bit but there were things in Adam that Adam couldn't portray he couldn't he couldn't show without Eve but when God made Eve he didn't make a separate being he took a portion of Adam took her out created Eve and then took another portion of Adam the feminine spirit and put it in her so in every way they were body of my body Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bones Spirit of my spirit Adam was not complete without Eve Christ isn't complete without the bride but she loses herself in him she loses her identity I don't want an identity just as a Christian I want an identity of Jesus Christ I want an identity I want to portray Jesus Christ I want to portray the literal life of Jesus Christ I believe it can be the actual literal life the reality of God in us I believe that we can portray that otherwise what are we doing here Christ poured himself out into the church to be one with her he wants all of her heart he's a jealous God he's he's a jealous King he he won't tolerate you giving your heart just portion of it to him God won't tolerate that he wants all of you he'll take what you give him but he wants all of you I don't want to get down to the end of the road and when I get up to the gates I want to hear well done my good and faithful servant not I don't want to hear well but you didn't give me all your heart where was the other portion of your heart I wanted everything and and you only gave me just a little bit and we can do that to our spouses too where you give just a little bit of your heart you you want to you want it your way not the way that the word says that the relationship should be you want you want you want to receive the benefits but you don't want to give anything in return God gave his life to be reality to us vashti wanted to control and Lead but it showed that something was wrong because control and Lead that's that's the masculine spirit that's the what the man is supposed to do that's what God does in our lives he leads he has control he has supreme authority and we want him to have that but we have to submit to it we have to give that to him God put the put the feminine spirit in the woman Adam and Eve were one in both body and spirit connected physically and emotionally Paul said we we should not withhold our bodies from one another uh and neither neither should we withhold our hearts from one another brother you can't expect her to give her body to you and you not give your heart back to her she wants your heart and and I'll just say this in a in a try to say it without being too plain is the one really doesn't work well without the other the one is really meaningless and and that's and that's one thing when you know just as as my wife and I you know were were getting engaged and and married and going through life and and now you know talking to other couples and things and I I don't I don't even like to say um I don't even like to call it I hope this is okay I don't like to call it sex because that's what the world does that's what anybody does but it's different when there's love there because that's actually an expression of love if it's if it's right and you need that emotion brother you have to you have to show emotion you have to give your heart to your wife your wife wants to see your emotion she wants to see you happy she wants to see you excited to see her she wants your heart and and you should give it to her and if you can't then you need to go back and find out why can't I give my heart to this woman why can't I give my heart to this man what is locking you up inside what's keeping you from experiencing the best relationship that God put here on Earth for you what's keeping you from that ask yourself why am I locked why why can't I why can't I receive what they're trying to give me why can't I show what they want why can't I give them what they desire and those are big questions and who can know the heart but God are you still with me so just as man as much as the man needs a sexual connection the woman needs emotional connection just as much as we want the spiritual blessings Christ wants your heart Christ wants you he he wants to give the blessings to you but he wants your heart just skipping some of this because we've covered it you know we can turn down the Practical things of God's word we want the blessings we want the Miracles we want to we want to see but you know the Lord really really spoke to me and you know you think well maybe maybe if I could just see a demon and cast it out then that would make me feel better about my Christian walk or if I could lay hands on the sick and they recover then then I could believe but in the scripture we find that they said they did that and they weren't found part of him and we also find that they were doing it before the Holy Ghost even came amen so we don't want to accept just parts of God's word and throw out other parts when it gets practical when it's I I I have no don't get me wrong by saying this but I have no need that I know of to live every day knowing the deeper mysteries of God's word it doesn't unless it puts into an action in in a demonstration in your life then it's really meaningless it's it's just it's just knowledge at that point and and I don't want knowledge I'm tired of knowledge I want the reality of Jesus Christ so and we can't turn down the Practical things of a true relationship either you know we can we can say Amen to you know you your your body's not your own and and you know uh defraud not each other and and don't withhold yourself from each other and amen you know we can amen but when it comes to the Practical things of you know when's the last time you told her you loved her when's the last time you brought her a gift when's the last time you took her out on a date when's the last time you came and and you just you just sat before the Lord and you just said Rain On Me Lord when's the last time that you expressed your heart to to God and Father I love you and and I I can't imagine if this is sounds funny but I I was thinking you know through all this I thought man how cool would it have been to be you know full-blooded Italian how neat would that be and then and then you know you great uncle Cosmo and cousin Luciano and and I get Brandon that's but then I got to thinking about it and I thought but what if it didn't go the way that it did I might not be standing here today I may not have come across the path of the message or I may not have come across all of you I might have been holding the bocce ball in the wine and the cigar and and that's just that's not life to me and I'm so thankful that that God and you know and we should express that to God we should we should sit down and and thank you Lord for saving me thank you for the word of God thank you even though sometimes it cuts and it's hard and and and and it hurts and I have a hard time accepting it Lord I may not I may not I may be resisting this right now but but I do I do love your word and I do want it to be me that's my heart's desire you should express that to God you should you should talk to father about those things that's what in in you know you're I'm just trying to parallel for you so we can understand but it's just it's just your wife wants to hear you whisper sweet nothings she wants you to look at her and she wants you to take a walk with her she wants you to hold her hand and not a not a not a hard cold hand neither why don't you give her a little bit of love in your touch amen this is completely different from how I expected it to go an order was given by the king for wives to honor their husbands and that reminded me of Ephesians 5. husbands love your wives respect your husbands Paul getting into the Practical things go read Ephesians 5 sometime and then ask yourself is this just a good writing to me or am I doing this am I living this am I respecting my husband am I loving my wife what's what's your wife's love language what's your husband's love language what's God's love language we expect God you know I'm here I need to receive from you I need to receive from you but then when the when the when the minister you know calls for a response and you just sit there or or the song leader is is you know lift your hands before the Lord and oh but I'm so tired when the king said to come to church and you stay home that's not giving your heart to God that's not speaking his love language that's not worshiping the Lord that's not bringing your look of fire to be encouraged it's oh Eeyore woe is me life is hard nobody at the church likes me anyway have you shown yourself friendly what have you done to express friendship what have you done to go walk up and talk to somebody what have you done to sacrifice bring the sacrifice of praise I just I just want to worship Him but I don't want to just worship Him in song and church I want my life to be a worship to the king I want the king to get Glory I want him to look and say I want to bring a tear to his eye how many times do we cry you know Lord You're So Good father I love you we bring we cry but I want to bring a tear to God's eye I want him to say you know what you were struggling with that thing but you laid it down because you love me because you want to do better you want to do right you want to live right so you laid that thing down you listen to my word when the when the when the Chamberlain read the read from the house of rolls when he read the word the law you something welled up inside like David like like our pastor spoke David I love your law Lord thank you for your law thank you for the boundaries that you put in place to protect me I want to tell you something and then and and I well whatever quit worrying about it when I was met Tiffany um I was dating a girl from school because that's what we did and and I got presented with a with a decision that I had to make and and I met Tiffany and I mean it was you know she was in the Fazoli's how could I not love her so the Italian restaurant but no I saw her and I you know thought I was joking and I jumped up and we had one of those vans that you could stand up in and I jumped up and I looked through the window and I said I'm gonna marry her and I was just all giddy you know and my dad told me I my head was in the clouds and I wasn't worth nothing for a couple years that shouldn't end listen when you go out and you get a getaway I don't know why I'm on marriage so much today but when you go out and you get a getaway that should be your sweetheart there's to me there's there well there was one time when I took her out and we were so tired that we we parked and we slept but most times when we get to get out I mean it's just it's like we're on our honeymoon again we just love being together if you don't have that in your marriage it's not too late it's not too late work on it put a little effort into it what love language what's a love language go find it come ask me I'll give you the book you can find out what yours is and then and then you can drop hints of what yours is but you better find out what hers is too I don't even know what I was talking about now oh the decision and I remember I still remember I have a terrible memory but I remember when the Lord revealed to me my decision and I was sitting on a four-wheeler and I was talking to brother Ken Boos he's come around a little bit and I was talking to Ken boose and it just hit me like a bolt of lightning and and I remember you know like well you know they're I just got to thinking and I thought well the one as mayor where and you know skirts that are real high up and tight fitting and all these things that you know opposite of modesty that we're trying to portray here we're trying to teach here opposite the word of God and there was sister Tiffany and she was portraying modesty she was dressed modestly and this is the thought that struck me that made the difference for me as I thought about the the girl at school and then just hit me and I said but she's not dressing that way for me everybody else is getting to enjoy that too that's not what I want and so I present that to you just to say that if you're struggling with something in the word of God maybe look at it different look at it from that aspect instead you know but Lord I'm dressing for you I'm dressing for the king how what what is God's expression how would that look like in clothing how would that look like in here how would that look like in what I drink how would that look like if I walked out of the pulpit and you know time out I'm gonna go out this door and take a smoke real quick how would that look that wouldn't that doesn't portray Christ that doesn't portray an overcoming life that doesn't portray his glory to me it it just doesn't it's opposite so I don't say those things to make you feel bad but let's just think about it for a minute I don't know how we got on that brother Branham said something that I thought was was real good and I'm almost to my quotes for them in the back this is just paraphrasing now he said when Jesus when when Queen vashti did that and it says in the scripture here it you could see it on his face it made him turn red he blushed he he was he was frustrated he was embarrassed the the king turned red he didn't know what to do he what do I do now she turned me down he was embarrassed how many times do we do things that makes Jesus's face turn red how many times do do we say things do we partake in something that it makes it makes Jesus embarrassed and I can imagine that the devil walks up and says yeah but that's your bride I know I give me a minute let me take that in I'm embarrassed I'm ashamed I want to read to you Daniel's prayer real quick Daniel chapter 9. are you still with me I know I slowed down I'm coming down to a close just bear with me a little bit longer I just thought this was a beautiful prayer Daniel Prayed Daniel 9 verse 3 and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications and with fastings and sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned if you don't know how to repent just follow Daniel's lead here we've sinned and we've committed iniquity and we've done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from the judgments neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in the name of our Kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the Land O Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us con uh confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries wither thou has driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee O Lord to us belong with confusion of Faith to our Kings to our princes to our fathers because we have sinned against thee he's acknowledging Lord we've we've embarrassed you we have absolutely embarrassed you you you the the even the Heathen expected more out of us and we've completely embarrassed you and he's saying Lord we deserve what you've given us we deserve everything that we're receiving right now we deserve to be scattered we deserve to not have Kings set up we deserve to not have our Jerusalem to the Lord Our God belongs mercies and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets yea all Israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they may not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured out upon us in the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him and he hath confirmed his words which he spake again against us and against our judges that judged Us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole Heaven hath not been done as have been done upon Jerusalem as it is written in the law of Moses all this evil has come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the Lord Our God that we might turn from our iniquity and understand thy truth let me just skip down here because verse 16. oh Lord according to all thy righteousness I beseech thee let thy anger and thy Fury be turned away from the city Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us now therefore o our Lord hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's Sake O my God incline thine ear and hear upon thine eyes and behold our desolation in the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies O Lord hear O Lord forgive O Lord hearken and do defer not for thine own Sake O my God for thy City and thy people are called by thy name Daniel's crying out to the Lord repenting father I'm sorry for the way that I've lived this life I'm sorry for the things I've done and called myself a Christian while doing it if you want to pull up that first quote I'll bring it down to a close here starts with but but now foreign but now what if this woman gets married takes all these vows and everything and she becomes this man's husband and she's heir to all he's got and so forth and then she goes wild she starts off on a tantrum she starts off running after other men not only that but she's sharing her love with others a man with his wife all the promises that they has made and then she goes out and starts sharing her life with others her love and her affection with others foreign that's what too many so-called Christians do sharing your love with the world playing dancing gambling staying home from prayer meetings to watch television all kinds of worldly things that took the place of the love of God and the church's heart she's gone on a tantrum she's gone wild she's gone out after other men she is sharing her love she'll take her tithing that she should give unto the church she'll spend it on other things out there in the world so instead of loving God the way she should do and living for God and loving to come to church you almost have to persuade her to come if you have to be persuaded to come to church there's something wrong there's something wrong there's something wrong in your heart and he told me next quote oh you had it I'm sorry at the bottom and he told me about that signing those pledges a minister had sent out cards to get pledges just trying to get people to come to church and I said Dr Brown do you think that Wildcat player on the radio some singer or something that was doing a concert do you think he'd have to make that girl sign a pledge that she would be over there that night not at all she would Pawn what clothes she had on to get there why it's something in her that's connected her a spirit to the worldly amusement and entered the Church of the Living God that's called the bride of Christ gets herself connected with God like that she'll still wallow in the world in the Miry clay of sin until she's connected with God in such a way till her heart is so filled with glory and power of God until she can't see nothing else but Christ that's right last part Esther cleaned herself she cleaned her heart that's what she cleaned that's what the church needs a heart cleaning how do you clean your heart brother Branham Washed by the Water of the word through the blood of Jesus Christ if the musicians would come and you you want to go ahead and stand there's nothing in my heart this morning that wants to make anybody feel bad and I'm not trying to persuade you by making you feel bad or putting fear I'm just this is this is my heart as is to be connected with Christ and to see you connected with Christ to see you get
