On March 26, 2023, Literal Life Church hosted a community outreach event, "Hymns and Classics Sing-Along". We pressed the record button that evening and received such positive response from the community afterward that we decided to make the audio recording available for free to the public. 

It Is Well

Verse 1
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
  When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,
  “It is well, it is well with my soul!”

Chorus 
It is well with my soul!
It is well, it is well with my soul!

Verse 2
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
  Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
  And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

Verse 3
My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought—
  My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more;
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

Verse 4
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;
  If dark hours about me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
  Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

Written by Horatio Gates Spafford
